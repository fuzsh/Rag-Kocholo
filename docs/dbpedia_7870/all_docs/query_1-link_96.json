        "text": "“I can’t pretend that growing older never hurts…” – Pete Townshend, “Slit Skirts”\n\nA few weeks back Pete Townshend – lead guitarist/vocalist/songwriter for the Who – released a massive 14 CD box set of live material that spans his solo performances over a 16 year span. I’ve been a big fan of Pete Townshend since junior high school when I bought Empty Glass on cassette no less, so who better than me your intrepid blogger to spend the last couple of weeks immersed in this music? It turns out these 14 CDs actually cover 7 concerts – 2 discs per show – and all of these shows were released in the early 2000s on Pete’s personal website but have all gone out of print and were unavailable. He packaged them all in one big tidy box and released them to sate desire for folks who wanted to pick up these live shows all in one fell swoop. I’ll admit, when I saw 14 discs of solo Pete, I sort of rolled my eyes. I fully expected to not love this stuff… and as usual my preconceived notions – like many people’s preconceived notions – were wrong.\n\nPete’s approach to his solo career is a lot different than most guys who choose to go solo. I’ve covered the topic of guys from popular bands who go solo before. Pete released his first, very low key, solo album in a very low key way. Who Came First was a tribute to Pete’s guru Meher Baba. I do love the song “Sheraton Gibson,” but when I started buying music in the late 70s, I didn’t even know Who Came First existed. His second foray into a solo project was a joint album with the Faces great bass player/singer Ronnie Lane, Rough Mix. It really is an understated gem but short of seeing it in the used record store, I was completely unfamiliar with that album as well.\n\nTo me, Townshend’s first solo album was the aforementioned Empty Glass. I loved that record. “Rough Boys” written in response to punk rock is such a great riff. The monster track “Gonna Get Ya” was epic. That album was so good, the then drummer for the Who (former Faces member) Kenny Jones accused Townshend of hording his best material for solo albums. That was something Kenny had previously accused Rod Stewart of doing in the Faces so he was familiar with that. The follow up was the wordy All The Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes – only Fiona Apple could come up with a longer title – and I loved the songs “Slit Skirts” and “Somebody Saved Me.” The lyric from the latter song, “Somebody saved me from a fate worse than Heaven, ‘Cause if I’d had her for just an hour I’d have wanted her forever…” still resonates with me.\n\nFor me, the last real solo album or at least the last solo Pete album that meant anything to me was White City. The songs “Give Blood” and “Second Hand Love” (which even the Rock Chick loves and she’s not a big solo Pete or blues fan) remain in high rotation here at the B&V labs. I did briefly own The Iron Man a rock opera based on a children’s book because I’d heard John Lee Hooker was on it. I sold it rather quickly. I didn’t even bother to investigate Psychoderelict although I recall seeing a performance of it on PBS that was excruciating. Hard to believe Townshend pulled the curtain on his solo career, in terms of releasing full albums of new material, in 1993.\n\nAs I said, Pete had a different approach to his solo career. Most guys do a band album and then tour. They then head back in the studio record their solo album and yes, tour. Rinse, repeat. I read something recently where Pete said of his solo career, he already had a job recording and touring with the Who and he didn’t want to have a second career doing the same thing. He said, “I tried that and it didn’t go well,” which I’d disagree with. That said, Pete never did massive solo tours. He played a show here and there, some for charity, and recorded them. He eventually released them all on his website but let them go out of print. He was very lackadaisical about his solo career. Of course he was busy over the years putting together theatrical performances of Tommy or compiling LIfehouse his lost rock opera that turned into Who’s Next so he wasn’t exactly idle.\n\nLuckily for us Pete recorded most of those solo performances. There is the full range of what Pete has done solo in this box. You have to remember that Pete suffers from tinnitus that causes him massive headaches. I think over the years he’s learned to deal with it, but he was relegated to playing acoustic guitar most of the time. There is some good ol’ Pete electric guitar but you’re not going to hear the kind of controlled anarchy you hear with the Who. There’s not a Live At Leeds hiding in here. It’s a mixed bag but I’d call it mostly superb. Here are out thoughts divided by each show:\n\nDisc 1 & 2: Live From The Brixton Academy, London, 1985 – This is the famous Deep End concert. Pete released an abbreviated version of this show as a single disc live album and it’s one of my favorites, although it didn’t make my list of Essential Live Albums for some reason. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd plays lead guitar. I love the version of “After The Fire,” a song he gave to Roger Daltrey, that’s performed here. I love that Pete delves into all his musical interests: the Who, solo, blues, jazz… He lets the band do a few instrumental jazz numbers which are “take it or leave it,” and Gilmour does three solo songs, “Blue Light” being the pick of the litter. This is an absolutely great performance and I am glad to finally hear the whole thing again.\n\nDisc 3 & 4: Live From The Brooklyn Academy, New York, 1993 – This show, for me at least, is the only real stumble in the whole box. Disc 3 is a full on performance of Psychoderelict complete with spoken word passages. I would have thrown myself out the window during this performance but I was on the ground floor and it would have just resulted in a broken window and an angry wife. I don’t know why anybody would return to this disc. Disc 4 is better in that it’s a great collection of Pete’s work from “Rough Boys” to “Eminence Front” to “A Little Is Enough.” I love hearing Pete take the lead vocals on “You Better You Bet,” but I’ve always loved that song. I will say Pete’s voice is a little ragged on Disc 4.\n\nDisc 5 & 6: Live At The Fillmore, San Francisco, 1996 – I was really surprised by this show, in a good way. It’s like an Unplugged performance with just Pete on acoustic guitar and Jon Carin on piano/keyboards. I was stunned at how charmed I was by the stripped down arrangements of these songs. Even without the bombast the Who classics come across.\n\nDis 7 & 8: Live At Shepherd’s Bush Empire, London, 1998 – Here we have Pete actually employing a back-up band unlike the stripped down previous show. I love that he opens with the old Canned Heat song, “On The Road Again,” that I’d forgotten to include on my Playlist: Songs About Driving/the Road. It’s on there now… There are a few missteps to this show… he employs a rapper, sigh. I don’t mind rap or hip hop but just like the Black Keys employing that on their latest album Ohio Players, it doesn’t fit here. He also turns lead vocal over to a female singer, who’s name escapes me, and it left me cold. Despite that there are some great performances here and I’m glad he included it.\n\nDisc 9 & 10: Live From Sadler’s Well Theater, London, 2000: This is a full performance of Pete’s lost rock opera, Lifehouse. I had seen stuff in the press about Lifehouse but hadn’t really delved into it… I mean, Who’s Next which was harvested from these sessions has always been enough for me, it’s a classic. Pete employs a backup band and full orchestra. This is an absolute highlight from these shows. I really loved it. It’s the first time I’d heard “Greyhound Girl” and it is now one of my all time favorite Pete Townshend songs. It’s a stunning ballad. This may be the best show of the entire box.\n\nDisc 11 & 12, and Disc 13 & 14: Live At La Jolla Playhouse, San Diego, 2001 – The final 4 discs in the box cover two concerts, recorded on successive nights in San Diego in June of 2001. The shows were for charity and come off a bit like one of those old VH1 Storytellers. Pete plays acoustic guitar and piano. In between each songs he chats with the crowd and is amazingly engaging. I really enjoyed both of these concerts. He puts in another performance of my new favorite “Greyhound Girl.”\n\nI don’t know many people who are like me who will want to sit down and listen to all 14 discs in a row. Well, all but disc 3… damn Psychoderelict… but I could see streaming the Deep End show or the Lifehouse performance while sipping a bit of wine. I mean, “The Sea Refuses No River,” after all. This is a great accompaniment to Pete’s fine early solo albums. I love that he plays songs from both Who Came First and Rough Mix. There’s no part of his solo work he doesn’t touch on. He does many of the great songs he wrote for the Who. He has a fabulous choice of covers and I was surprised how much blues he played. There are certain songs that he always comes back to in each show that you can just tell those tunes mean a lot to him. “I’m One” is here at almost every show and we’re all better for it.\n\nPete may not have wanted a traditional solo career but now with this live stuff to compliment his early LPs, we have a better, more complete view of him as a solo artist. This set takes a lot of work just in the sheer volume of material but it all pays off in spades. I realize that many true collectors have the original discs purchased through Pete’s website, but for those of us who weren’t paying attention 20 years ago, this is a great release. Kudos Pete and thank you for this gift.\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nJust when I thought I’d settled in on Slash’s new blues album Orgy Of The Damned as my “summer jam,” Mike Campbell & The Dirty Knobs arrive with their new album, Vagabonds, Virgins & Misfits, to give Slash a run for his money as “King of My Stereo.” Nothing will help me get over the loss of Tom Petty in 2017, but having Campbell and his Dirty Knobs putting out albums every two years is indeed some rock n roll consolation. We were huge fans of the Knobs debut in 2020, Wreckless Abandon and the 2022 follow up External Combustion. There have been some changes with the band’s lineup on this record. Joining former Heartbreakers Mike Campbell (guitar/vocals) this time around are: Steve Ferrone (drums) also a former Heartbreaker…he replaces Matt Laug who is playing with AC/DC on their tour in Phil Rudd’s spot; Chris Holt (guitar) who replaces Jason Sinay who departed for solo pastures; and finally Lance Morrison remains on bass guitar.\n\nSometimes when you change band members you get a shift in chemistry or sound. I can say, I don’t notice a significant change in sound or tone on this new Knobs’ album. I think I’ve commented on both previous albums by Campbell and his outfit that they sound remarkably like Tom Petty’s music. I think I’ve finally come to realize that Campbell was so much a part of the Heartbreakers’ musical DNA – whether co writing a song, or just playing guitar – that of course his solo music is going to sound Petty-esque. I mean, if you listen to Keith Richards solo albums you don’t think, “Hmmm, this guy sounds Stonesy, that’s a surprise…” So, yes, when I listen to Campbell’s music I do hear echoes of his former employer and that’s a good thing.\n\nThe music on Vagabonds feels slightly lighter in the previous albums. He layers more acoustic guitar with the electric to wonderful effect here. So many times when a lead guitarist strikes out on his own the music becomes all about riffs and solo’s like Jerry Cantrell’s solo record Degradation Trip, for instance. The guy played everything he’d ever thought of on guitar on that album. Or the new record from Liam Gallagher and John Squire, it’s a great album but you can tell it was written by a guitar player with all the epic soloing. Campbell writes more like Petty, he writes complete, melodic rock n roll with great guitar solo’s as a bonus. There’s something so elemental about the Dirty Knobs music. It’s a straightforward rock n roll attack with vocals, two guitars, bass and drums. Is it weird that fundamental rock music like this almost feels like “roots music” these days? We need more rock bands with this kind of sound. These guys rock but they certainly know how to roll as well.\n\nThere’s so much to love here. I’ve already written about the first single “Dare To Dream,” so I won’t continue raving about that one, only to pause to say Graham Nash is a valuable secret weapon on any song he adds a harmony vocals on. There are a few other guest spots on the album – much like External Combustion with Ian Hunter and Margo Price guesting – and they’re both sensational tracks. Lucinda Williams shows up and duets with Mike on the great acoustic, country-ish ballad “Hell Or High Water.” These two were made to sing together much like Norah Jones and Keith Richards. Great country weeper. Chris Stapleton, a country guy I’m really starting to like, shows up for “Don’t Wait Up.” I was also happy to see Benmont Tench plays keyboards on the song. “Don’t Wait Up” starts with a little crying guitar that grabs me like a hook in a fish’s mouth…after that it’s off to the rock n roll races. These guys gen up some great guitar heat on this song. And it’s always nice to hear Ben Tench playing some boogie-woogie piano… “Daddy won’t be home until way past dawn…” indeed.\n\nThe album is not by any stretch subsumed by the guest appearances. There are so many great songs, I’m not sure which one is my favorite. “Angel Of Mercy” is a great rolling rocker that has that great blend of acoustic and guitar that propels the song forward and has a great solo. “So Alive” is what Petty used to call an old school Heartbreakers rocker. It’s a great meet-me-at-the-finish-line rocker. Campbell’s solo is sublime. “Shake These Blues” is a stomping bluesy rocker that wouldn’t have been out of place on Mojo. It’s a super guitar work out. “Innocent Man” is a nice jangly rocker that brings the Byrds to mind.\n\n“Hands Are Tied” is a wonderful atmospheric ballad complete with spooky guitar. I will admit Campbell’s vocals sound like Petty… I can’t help it, Petty’s ghost is always close by for me. A contender for my favorite track is “My Old Friends,” which is a true B&V track. While it is a “farewell to drinking” song, Campbell manages to name check almost every liquor I can think of from Budweiser to Brandy Alexanders. It’s a very funny song…I love that Campbell has such a great sense of humor. Let’s just say I can relate to this song, “my misspent youth was nearly the death of me…” Yeah, I can’t deny that.\n\nThe album kicks off with “The Greatest” with crowd noise dubbed in. It’s a nice little tribute to the fans but probably would have worked better at the end of the album. It’s a bit of weird of a weird track to start the album on. I see “The Greatest” as a song they’ll likely play at the end of a set, or better yet, the end of their encore. The album concludes with “Amanda Lynn,” a short instrumental that sounds like mandolin? If I have any complaints about the album, if you take away “The Greatest” and “Amanda Lynn” you’ve really only got 9 tracks which feels a little slight. Other than that, this is a delight, start to finish.\n\nMike Campbell and the Dirty Knobs have a nice little rock n roll hot streak going here. I urge everybody to check out this album post haste. Turn this one up to 11. Between this album, the aforementioned Slash album and the Black Crowes’ Happiness Bastards it’s going to be a very rock n roll summer around the B&V labs…\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt appears the rumors I’ve been hearing are true and erstwhile Pink Floyd guitarist/singer David Gilmour is set to release his fifth studio album Luck And Strange this coming September. Today he’s released the first single from the album, “The Piper’s Call.”\n\nIt may seem odd that David Gilmour, a very famous musician, has only put out five studio albums (if I include Luck And Strange) over the years. Of course from the 60s through the early 80s he was busy in Pink Floyd with Roger Waters, Rick Wright and Nick Mason. And from the late 80s on he was busy… well, in Pink Floyd with only Rick Wright and Nick Mason. I don’t think there was a more contentious break up in rock n roll history as Pink Floyd’s split between Gilmour/Mason/Wright and Waters. These guys make the Beatles break up look like a slightly unruly evening at a bingo night at the local church.\n\nI have to admit, like most critics I’ve been up and down on Gilmour’s solo career. His guitar playing is some of the most melodic, recognizable, soulful sounds ever generated from the instrument. When Gilmour played guest guitar on a Pete Townshend or Paul McCartney record, you knew it was Gilmour. Pink Floyd ranks amongst Zeppelin and the Stones in the 70s pantheon of “cool” bands that every rock head loved. If you weren’t into those bands you might as well have been listening to disco. You were simply “uncool.”\n\nHowever, in his solo career Gilmour has been less successful. Of course a lot of Pink Floyd “purist” would say that A Momentary Lapse Of Reason and The Division Bell, Pink Floyd’s albums without Waters are merely Gilmour solo records disguised as Floyd records. Sigh… Most critics will tell you that About Face from 1984 is the “pick of the litter” in terms of his solo career. I would probably agree with that assessment but I really liked his last studio album, Rattle That Lock. One of the issues that most critics, and fans for that matter, bring up is that Gilmour’s songwriting partner and lyric writer is his wife Polly Sampson. You get the usual “Yoko” kind of complaints about that. Hey, the guy can partner with whomever he wants, and he chooses to partner with his wife. Although I’m not immune to the ol’ trope that it’s a bad sign when you invite your significant other into the band.\n\nHaving enjoyed Rattle That Lock, I’m actually sort of looking forward to Luck And Strange. I’ve been listening to this new track, “The Piper’s Call” all morning. It wouldn’t have been out of place on his last album. The track starts off with a quiet acoustic guitar, quite lovely actually. It’s almost a Spanish guitar thing. Suddenly Gilmour’s voice – which I’ve always loved – comes on. The guy has lost nothing vocally over the years. The track kind of meanders along until the chorus when some fabulous Gilmour electric guitar comes in. He’s so plaintive in the way he plays. The track is mellow for the first minute and a half. But that chorus with Gilmour’s distressed vocals and wonderful guitar drew me in. His guitar playing is the main reason to stick around. Here’s the track:\n\nIt’s not a track that’s going to change anybody’s life or reignite a career the way say, Billy Joel’s “Turn The Lights Back On” did, but it’s not a bad little song. And if you’re a Pink Floyd fan – and who among us isn’t? – you’ll probably dig this one.\n\nThe album isn’t out until September but rest assured B&V will be out there with our ear to the ground… heeding the piper’s call, so to speak.\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLast Friday the Queens of the Stone Age – Josh Homme (guitars/keyboards/vocals), Troy Van Leeuwen (guitars/keyboards), Dean Fertita (guitars/keyboards), Michael Schuman (bass) and Jon Theodore (drums) – returned after six years with their new album In Times New Roman. I’ve always been more of a Helvetica man myself, but I do love this hard rocking album.\n\nI’ve always thought of the Queens as more of a collective of musicians built around leader Josh Homme than a traditional band. I think that’s a mistake on my part. The current line up, listed above, has been in place for over 15 years (save for drummer Jon Theodore but he’s been around for a decade) which is pretty stable. I think I felt that collective vibe about the Queens because vocalist Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees) and drummer, original Foo Dave Grohl (yes, I know he does more than drum) have done stints in the band. And in my defense there was quite a few line up changes in the early days.\n\nI’ve made no secret I was late getting on the QOTSA bandwagon. I I was driving around in my car in 2013 when a local radio station went old school and played …Like Clockwork in it’s entirety. I loved that album. It came on the heels of a near death health situation for Homme and that music is dripping in an existential murk that I could not resist. I was also equally taken with Homme’s work on Iggy Pop’s Post Pop Depression as producer and guitarist. Naturally when Villains came out, I was a huge fan. That album was a pure rock n roll groove… it was almost dance-able… if you’re into that sort of thing. I’m a confirmed wallflower, so no thanks to the dancing. Naturally, since the Queens of the Stone Age have been around for a while, their old school fans who’d been on the bandwagon longer than I were dismayed by the new-ish musical directions Homme took the band on those latter two LPs.\n\nAfter …Like Clockwork and Villains I went back and picked up 2002’s Songs For the Deaf, another great album. Usually, at that point, three LPs in and digging what I’d heard, I’d have gone “whole hog” on their back catalog and devoured the other four of their first five albums. For some reason I didn’t do that. While I absorbed this LP to prepare my comments I went back and listened to that back catalog. Let me say, their debut LP is fabulous – but I’ve always loved debut albums – as is Lullabies To Paralyze. Don’t skip Rated R either, it’s a great second album, defying the “sophomore slump” that so often hits a band.\n\nHaving gone back and listened to the early stuff, I have to say In Times New Roman feels like a return to that heavy, alternative riff rock of say, Lullabies to Paralyze. Josh Homme has been through a lot in the last six years – a very public, messy divorce; a battle with cancer; legal issues stemming from kicking a camera into a camera woman’s face), and perhaps retrenching to their older, heavier sound was a way to center himself. Gone is the aforementioned murk of …Like Clockwork or the dance-able grooves of Villains. This album just plain rocks. That’s not to say it’s monochromatic in any sense of the word. Over great squalling guitars the vocals just soar. Also I love Josh’s word play: obscene scenery becomes “Obscenery,” motion sickness turns into “Emotional Sickness,” carnivore becomes “Carnavoyuer.” You can’t say Josh doesn’t have a sense of humor. One of his nicknames was “Ginger Elvis” after all…\n\nThere is a lot to love on this album. Especially if you like rock n roll and guitar. The riffs on this album feel heavier than the previous two albums, if that’s possible? The lyrics while not specific sound focused on the end of his relationship with his wife… and it was a bad ending. Although the singing on the record conjures more resolve than anger. Every listen to this album seemed to open up something new for me. I’ll admit, while the first single, “Emotional Sickness” didn’t grab me as hard as the first single from Villains, “The Way You Used To Do,” it is a great song and a fitting first single. It’s got a riff that reminds me of the White Stripes for some reason. Over a ferocious riff, Josh sings “Baby Don’t care for me, I had to let her go, oh…” I feel that in my bones, man.\n\nThere are two tracks that I believe rank amongst QOTSA’s best music. “Time And Place” may be my favorite. That song just grabs me by the lapels. Its got a nimble riff and great groove. Who doesn’t love a lyric like “I realize you’re like a bummed cigarette, suicide in slow motion…” Having bummed a cigarette or two in the 90s, I can relate. I can listen to this song alone on repeat and I’d say it’s worth the price of admission here. The other song I’d rank amongst their “best ever” would be “Carnavoyuer.” It’s almost Bowie-esque and has the most exquisite tortured guitar. The harmonies on the chorus will also draw you in.\n\nThere’s so much great, straight-up rock on this album. “Obscenery” is the first track and a great opener… tribal drums and guitar. “Made To Parade” which seems to be a jab at those who climbed the corporate ladder is a solid rocker and a favorite… perhaps for personal reasons. “Paper Machete,” whose title I misread as “Paper Mache” for the first few listens, has a driving riff and will get you out of your chair headed for your “air-guitar.” “Negative Space” is another great tune with a slower more grinding riff. “What The Peephole Say” is a twitchy, paranoid rocker. The albums ends with the epic, 9-minute plus “Straight Jacket Fitting,” with an acoustic guitar coda that is a fitting ending.\n\nIf you’re worried about rock n roll – especially on the heavier, harder end of the rock n roll pool – have no fear. Josh Homme and the lads in QOTSA are here to rock your world, hard, on In Times New Roman. This is an album best listened to at top volume and when was the last time you heard something like that?\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s no secret that we love the White Stripes around here at B&V. I was delighted to see the band release a deluxe version of their landmark 2003 album Elephant in celebration of it’s 20th anniversary. Included in Elephant – Deluxe is the original album and a concert recording from that tour recorded in Chicago. In the words of fellow Detroit native Bob Seger, I can only say, “20 years now, where’d they go, 20 years, I don’t know…” It seems like this record came out yesterday.\n\nThis deluxe set comes amidst some White Stripes controversy of late. I don’t feel I can post about the White Stripes without addressing the Elephant in the room. Apparently some idiot journalist wrote an article and made the audacious claim that White Stripes’ drummer Meg White was a terrible drummer. This of course caused a bunch of blow back on Twitter for the idiot. Leader of the White Stripes Jack White and Tom Morello, amongst others, immediately came to the defense of Meg. Let me state for the record that we here at B&V love Meg White’s drumming. She’s not going to get fancy like Neil Peart. She’s not all over the drum kit like Keith Moon. But her bedrock drumming was the foundation that allowed guitarist/singer Jack White to soar. Without Meg White’s drumming, there is no White Stripes. Her drumming is fierce, primal and visceral. Having listened to the White Stripes’ catalog thousands of times over the years and having seen them live I can testify (in my not so humble opinion) she’s one of the best drummers I’ve seen. You won’t see her floating in the air like Tommy Lee but she lifted me out of my seat more than once. Compare Jack’s solo work with his work in the White Stripes and you’ll hear the difference. And we dig most of Jack’s solo work, most recently Entering Heaven Alive.\n\nI think I’m like most people, I discovered the White Stripes when their third album White Blood Cells broke big on the strength of the singles “Fell In Love With A Girl” and “Dead Leaves On The Dirty Ground.” Like many bands, it was the magical third album that broke them big. The Stripes were riding the then current wave of “garage rock” that was supposed to have been to the 2000s what Grunge was to the 90s. I totally hear the “garage rock” part of the Stripes sound. With only the amazing Meg White on drums and Jack White on guitar/keyboards/vocals they were minimalists (to a degree). What I loved about the White Stripes is they have an old school, blues based sound. Most of what they did was rooted in the blues and we’re on record as loving the blues and blues rock here at B&V. Jack White plays the guitar with the grit and dexterity of Bluesmen from a generation (or two) before him. He made no secret of the fact that one of his biggest influences was legendary Bluesman Son House, who has influenced so many who came after him.\n\nI purchased White Blood Cells shortly after I saw the White Stripes on an MTV Awards show, which is embarrassing but I wasn’t listening to the radio that much in those days. The Rock Chick had heard these guys on the alternative rock station in town and was all in. I knew White Blood Cells was the White Stripes’ third album but for some reason I didn’t do my usual “buy the back catalog” thing. I didn’t go out and purchase either The White Stripes (their debut) or De Stijl (their second and perhaps my favorite album). It would appear I was only putting my toe in the water on the Stripes. But then Elephant came out and all of that changed. The first track I heard was “Seven Nation Army” and that’s all it took. I was at the record (er, CD) store the day the album came out with my dollars in my hand.\n\nAfter hearing Elephant those 20 years ago, I was blown away. It’s a blues rock bonanza. Jack’s musical vision finally came to full fruition. There were so many great songs on the record. “Ball And A Biscuit,” “The Hardest Button To Button” and the aforementioned “Seven Nation Army” are rock n roll standards in my book. “The Air Near My Fingers” and “Hypnotize” are epic guitar freakouts. “I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother’s Heart” was a piano driven, almost country rock thing that was great. Meg took a turn on vocals for the torch song, “In The Cold, Cold Night” and I loved it. Elephant, in a word, is the perfect White Stripes album. It’s what catapulted them in my mind from a curiosity to a great rock n roll band.\n\nBut beyond that, it was on that tour that I saw them in concert for the first time. OMG, as the kids say. They played venerable Memorial Hall over in Kansas City, KS. It seats only 3500 people and as I recall there wasn’t an empty chair. Memorial Hall has seen great acts over the years: Pink Floyd played Dark Side Of The Moon in it’s entirety there, 5 months before the album had come out… Led Zeppelin played two shows there in one day, and no they weren’t booed off stage. Memorial is a small venue but it’s a great place to see a show…not a bad seat in the house. I saw the Rossington Collins Band there but I’m off topic. The Stripes walked on stage with what appeared to be a body guard – a giant man in a three piece, pinstripe suit and a fedora. The stage was simple, just Meg’s drum kit and the amps and Jack’s guitars. They proceeded to bring down the sky. What a concert. I remember hearing their Dolly Parton cover “Jolene” for the first time that night. Apparently they played the Bob Dylan song “Isis” and for the life of me I don’t recall that. Jack strapped on a beat up, gray, wide-body guitar and played a blues riff that sounded eternal and then launched into a song I didn’t recognize. It turns out it was “Death Letter,” a Son House cover. Jack hopped around the stage, always close to Meg’s drum kit and they rocked the house that night. The energy on that stage was contagious… I was convinced Jack White was an unhinged genius that night. I walked out of that concert knowing that the White Stripes were one of the greatest bands of all time. And, yes, the next day I went out and bought their first and second albums to complete my collection (at the time).\n\nWith the deluxe version of Elephant the White Stripes have included a full concert, from Chicago, from that very same tour that I saw them on for the first time. I really liked the Stripes “official” live album, Under Great Northern Lights. It’s great, but it didn’t make my list of the greatest live albums ever. This live concert from Elephant – Deluxe would qualify to enter the discussion amongst the greatest live albums. The energy I experienced in Memorial Hall 20 years ago translate right through the speakers. From hard rocking songs “When I Hear My Name” and “Seven Nation Army” to the quiet moments like Meg’s turn on vocals “In The Cold, Cold Night” or “We’re Going To Friends” (that Jack says was written in the bedroom of a girl named Susie Lee who didn’t care about him at all) they just kill these performances. The setlist is similar but different from when I saw them on this tour. I was knocked out by the Dylan cover on this set, “Lovesick” from Dylan’s Time Out of Mind. They include “Stop Breaking Down” written by Robert Johnson (and covered by the Stones) that they’d included on their debut album. And then threw in another Robert Johnson cover “Stones In My Passway.”\n\nThere is so much rock n roll, blues and good times on this live disc it makes this Elephant – Deluxe set absolutely worth the price of admission. I’ve owned the album for 20 years and I’m buying this again just for the live show. This is a must hear, must have. The White Stripes were such a great band and their performances were legendary. I only saw them twice but it was enough to still make me long for Meg White to return from the wilderness, grab Jack by the hand and rock.\n\nCheers! And Jack, I knew plenty of women like Susie Lee…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“You check out guitar George, he knows-all the chords, Mind, it’s strictly rhythm he doesn’t want to make it cry or sing” – Dire Straits, “Sultans of Swing”\n\nI believe it was John Mellencamp who once sang, “Let me give you some good advice young man, you better learn to play guitar.” Every rock n roll fan wants to be the guitar player. Oh, sure I had those weird friends who played “air drums” but for the most part the guitar is the star. And I suppose a number of us have held a beer bottle in our hand and pretended it was a microphone as we lip-synced along. But for my friends and I, we all imagined being Hendrix and melting faces off with our epic, gnarly solo where we finish by playing the strings with our teeth. In most of our imaginations we were all the lead guitar player. Some of us – my friend Brewster or my friend Drew – actually owned a guitar. OK, Drew’s was a bass guitar but he owns a number of guitars now. Drew has what appears to be an awesome music room which unlike mine, has actual instruments in it. Brewster’s guitar had the neck snapped by a guy named Mickey (named changed to protect the guilty), karmic retribution for taking Mickey to see Springsteen on The River tour. My brother used to play an acoustic guitar but I don’t know if he still plays? I can’t play the radio.\n\nBut my utter lack of musical ability with an instrument didn’t stop me from dreaming. Other than lead singers – who often suffer from LSD, “lead singer disease” – when I was a teenager, I always held the dream of being the lead guitarist in a band. Whether I was Hendrix or Clapton in a power trio or Eddie Van Halen, the wizard, on guitar in a four piece, that was what I wanted to do… in my head at least. You’re in the spotlight but you’re sharing the spotlight with David Lee Roth, er, or whoever is singing. Some bands – the Allman Brothers Band, Thin Lizzy or the Paul Butterfield Band – had two lead guitar players. Oh, my… guitar nirvana. However, there are many, many bands that play as a five piece with two guitar players where there’s only one lead. That second guitarist is usually listed in the credits as playing “rhythm guitar.”\n\nThe Stones were always my gateway drug into rock n roll and while early on I had a Mick Jagger fetish, I quickly shifted my focus to Keith Richards. I couldn’t dance like Mick, but who can? At my most inexperienced, I assumed like most my guitar heroes, Keith was the lead guitar player. Paging Brian Jones… Mick Taylor… Ronnie Wood, but I digress. As time went on, the more liner notes I read taught me that there was such a thing as this fabled rhythm guitar player and that’s what Keith played (mostly). While playing solo’s gets all the attention the rhythm guy is just as important. He’s the guy that sets the riff which is the foundation of the song. It’s the riff that allows the soloist to soar, so to speak.\n\nI’ve always thought of the rhythm guitar player as being the linchpin in any five piece (with two guitarists). He’s part of the front line of any band along with the lead player and the lead singer. That front line is face to face with the crowd. But he’s also part of the rhythm section with the drummer and the bassist. And as any true rock fan knows, the rhythm section is the engine of any band. In the parlance of the restaurant industry, the rhythm player is working the front of the house and the back room. He’s helping set – with the aforementioned drummer/bass player – the foundation upon which the singer and the lead guitarist “stand” upon.\n\nSadly, true rhythm players never get the glory, outside of a very few. If you google rhythm players the lists you’ll find are littered with lead guys. And yes, there are plenty of lead guitar players – Eddie, Jimi, Angus Young – who play fabulous rhythm guitar. Many of the lead guys are the only guitar player in the band so they do double duty. For the purposes of my list, I wanted to focus on the guys who are dedicated rhythm guitar players. And yes, occasionally the rhythm guy might step forward and take a solo… heaven knows they’ve earned it. Without further adieu, these are my favorite (predominantly) rhythm guitar players. These guys might be hanging out in the shadows by the drum riser having a smoke, but they certainly deserve some attention and love… I’ve listed the player and the band(s) they played with below.\n\nKeith Richards, The Rolling Stones/Xpensive Winos – Keef! Well, any long time reader would know this would be where my list started… Keith is the self described “Riff Meister.” He’s got so many iconic riffs that he and Mick built into songs, “Satisfaction,” “Jumping Jack Woman,” and “Honky Tonk Woman” to name but a few. When I think of sublime rhythm this is what I think of. He’s admitted playing with a virtuoso like Mick Taylor allowed him to perfect the rhythm guitar. Indeed.\n\nMalcolm Young, AC/DC – We lost Malcolm only a few years ago which truly makes me sad. While his brother Angus gets all the glory in AC/DC for his amazing solo’s (check out “Whole Lotta Rosie”) it’s Malcolm whose the hero in that band. AC/DC is all about riffs and feel and that starts with Malcolm.\n\nStone Gossard, Pearl Jam – I feel Stone Gossard is sometimes the forgotten member of Pearl Jam. The chicks all dug Eddie Vedder and the guys like Mike McCready’s wicked solos but I always dug the riffs coming from Stone. He wrote most the music on their epic debut Ten. They’ve gone through a number of drummers but they couldn’t survive losing Stone in the engine of that band!\n\nIzzy Stradlin, Guns N Roses/solo – I’m still pissed the greedy Axl Rose hasn’t included his old Indiana buddy Izzy in the GnR reunion. When Slash, Duff and Adler first teamed up with Axl, he made Izzy’s being in the band a condition. Slash wasn’t too happy about it but Izzy wrote a lot of the songs and played fabulous riffs that Slash could play off of. He’s truly a great player. I saw Izzy and the Juju Hounds from right in front of the stage and oh, my, the riffs!\n\nJohn Lennon, The Beatles/solo – Sure John gets credit for his singing and songwriting and he was the front man of the Beatles, at least in the beginning, but he never gets credit for his great rhythm guitar. Ringo said he always played too fast but I love the way he plays. It’s an under appreciated part of the juggernaut of the Beatles.\n\nJoe Strummer, The Clash/solo – Much like Lennon, Joe sang most of the Clash tunes. He was another great songwriter. But he was also a great rhythm player. He didn’t adopt the last name “Strummer” for nothing. I love his playing on the early stuff like The Clash or Give ‘Em Enough Rope.\n\nJames Hetfield, Metallica – Hetfield is perhaps the greatest rhythm player in all of heavy metal. He plays some lead with Kirk Hammett but I love the aggressive, in your face rhythm the guy plays. When he and drummer Lars Ulrich lock into a groove, look out. I’m really digging the new songs they’re putting out from “Lux Aeterna” to “If Darkness Had A Son.”\n\nBob Weir, The Grateful Dead/various bands – The Dead were like the Allman Brothers in that they played rock n roll with an almost jazz sensibility. Bob Weir would probably have been a lead guy in other bands but he was in a band with genius Jerry Garcia. He developed into one of the most original, extraordinary rhythm players in the game. I’m not a huge Dead fan but I do dig Weir. I do like the Dead’s country rock stuff.\n\nBrad Whitford, Aerosmith/Whitford St. Holmes – Whitford is another guy who might have been the lead guy if he wasn’t in Aerosmith with Joe Perry. Indeed he was the lead player in his short lived band Whitford St. Holmes. Check out their tune “Sharpshooter.” And, in truth Whitford does play lead on songs he co writes. But for the most part he’s playing those dirty blues rock riffs that allow Perry to solo to his hearts content. When asked who his favorite guitar players were, Joe Perry included Whitford… rightly so.\n\nJoan Jett, Runaways/Joan Jett & The Blackhearts – Whether with the Runaways or solo Joan Jett’s rhythm guitar is the foundation of all her music. I saw her recently with Cheap Trick opening, and man does she play the riffs. She’s more known as the front woman of the Blackhearts but close your eyes and listen to that rhythm guitar, it’s super rich.\n\nNile Rodgers, Chic/producer/session player – Most of us rockers probably don’t own a lot Chic records. But Nile Rodgers who went on to become a big time producer started in that iconic band. The rhythm guitar that Nile laid down when he produced Bowie’s Let’s Dance with Stevie Ray Vaughn playing lead is enough to land him on this list. I love what he played on “China Girl.”\n\nChrissie Hynde, The Pretenders/solo – Like Joan Jett or John Lennon, Hynde is known more for her singing and songwriting. But, if you listen to the punchy punk rock of the Pretenders you know it’s all about her pugnacious riffs. I love the way she plays. I saw the Pretenders open for the Stones once and she was so impressive on guitar.\n\nBob Marley, Bob Marley & The Wailers – Bob is so iconic, he’s on posters and t-shirts everywhere I turn. Especially when I vacation in warmer climes. And he’s known for his singing and onstage dancing. But I really dug his rhythm guitar playing especially in the early days when Peter Tosh was playing the lead. “Positive Vibrations,” indeed.\n\nTom Petty, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers/solo – Petty always shied away from lead guitar because he was standing next to guitar maestro Mike Campbell in the Heartbreakers. But he was quite a good guitar player in his own right. He was such a great singer and songwriter nobody noticed he was playing all these iconic riffs. I can’t help but think of “Change Of Heart,” one of my all time favorite riffs…\n\nThat’s our list folks. It was high time we turned a bright, hot spotlight onto these great players. All of these rhythm guitar players are legends in my mind. Do you have a favorite I might have missed? Drop them in the comments section. I love to talk about the nooks and crannies of rock n roll. And sadly, I fear the rhythm guys have been wrongly pushed into the background of rock n roll.\n\nCheers and I hope everyone is recuperating from their St. Patrick’s Day festivities with Bloody Mary’s and bloody good rock n roll.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n*Image of Jeff Beck in 2014 above taken from the internet and likely copyrighted\n\nI was in my home office trying to knock out a laborious task for my corporate masters when I took a break to look on-line to see if anything of note had happened today. To be honest, I wanted to check the news and to look at some rock n roll stuff. It was then that I saw the sad news that guitar legend Jeff Beck had passed away from meningitis. Then I read it was a hoax, then I read it was the truth, Beck had passed. Damn internet. It was then that my friend, drummer Blake, reached out with the news. It is with a heavy heart I type these words: Jeff Beck has passed at the young age of 78 years old from a sudden bought of meningitis. He was simply one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Rolling Stone magazine had him in the top 5 all time if that means anything to you. He ranks up there with Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix for me. He could bend the strings…\n\nObviously, I am a huge fan of Jeff Beck. He had a guitar tone that was instantly recognizable. As most people know, he was one of the “Big 3” guitarist who played in the seminal English, blues rock band The Yardbirds. The Yardbirds started with Clapton on lead guitar but he quit because of his “blues purism.” He thought the band was moving too far into “pop.” Jeff Beck then came in to replace him. Eventually Jimmy Page joined the band. Imagine that dual lead guitar line up – Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck! Eventually they fired Beck and kept Page. Jeff could be, uh, mercurial. After the blues purism of Clapton, Jeff Beck really opened up what the Yardbirds’ sound. If you listen to “Heart Full of Soul” you can hear the psychedelia entering the picture. I think that was the song they’d hired a sitar player to play on, but they didn’t like the sound so Jeff just played the riff it on guitar. There was little he couldn’t do with the instrument. Coincidentally Ozzy Osbourne was able to recruit both Jeff Beck and Clapton to play on his album Patient Number 9 and had actually reached out to Page to play on the record, but he declined. As Meatloaf sang, “Two out of three (Yardbirds’ guitarists) ain’t bad.” Beck plays on the title track (Review: Ozzy Osbourne’s New Song Patient Number 9 With Jeff Beck! On Guitar) of the album and one other song.\n\nAfter leaving the Yardbirds Jeff formed his own band, The Jeff Beck Group. Guitarists were a huge draw and Beck was to be the focus of the band so they used his name to cash in on his Yardbirds fame. He recruited Ronnie Wood (later of the Faces and Rolling Stones) to play bass guitar and Rod Stewart as his lead vocalist. The theory was Jeff’s guitar would pull the guys into shows and good looking Rod Stewart would draw the women. Jimmy Page, who took Beck’s job in the Yardbirds stole that very blueprint for Led Zepplin with Robert Plant. I loved the Jeff Beck Group and posted on them years ago: Artist Lookback: The (Original) Jeff Beck Group: Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart & Ronnie Wood. They only hung together for 2 albums, Truth and Beckola before constant touring and treating Wood & Stewart like sidemen broke the band up. Ronnie Wood joined the Faces on his chosen instrument, guitar. Rod went solo but soon joined Woody in the Faces. The album Truth is one of the most influential albums in blues rock. It’s a stunning record. I could listen to their version of Howlin Wolf’s “I Ain’t Superstitious” and “Blues De Luxe” all day long. “Blues De Luxe” is on my “Rockers Playing the Blues” playlist. The Jeff Beck Group was supposed to play Woodstock but Jeff, who was fond of fast cars, was in a car accident and they couldn’t play. I still wonder to this day what would have happened if they’d made that iconic gig.\n\nAfter the Yardbirds and the original Jeff Beck Group a lot of people may have lost track of Beck. He formed a couple of different bands and put out records. He carried on as the Jeff Beck Group with an all new line up he put together that included Cozy Powell on drums and Bobby Tench on vocals. Then in 1973 he formed Beck, Bogert, Appice with Tim Bogert on bass and Carmine Appice on drums. Carmine’s little brother Vinny played with the Dio fronted Black Sabbath on Mob Rules. Beck, Bogart, Appice did a version of Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition” on that record that inspired Stevie Ray Vaughn to cover it years later.\n\nWhile that was already an incredible resume, in the middle 70s Beck decided to eschew working with a vocalist and put out two of the greatest guitar instrumental records ever. In 1975 he put out Blow By Blow which is another personal favorite. He covered the Beatles song “She’s A Woman.” He has a guitar solo titled “Constipated Duck” which may win the most preposterous song title award. He also covers Stevie Wonder’s “Cause We’ve Ended As Lovers” to wonderful effect. He worked with keyboardist Max Middleton who had been in the second incarnation of the Jeff Beck Group and it’s just a great LP. It almost feels like Jazz. He came back in 1976 with Wired, which I believe may be drummer Blake’s favorite. It was also produced by George Martin. They do a cover of Charles Mingus’ “Goodbye Porkpie Hat” which is worth the price of admission.\n\nAfter those highlights I have to admit my knowledge of Jeff’s work is spotty. I remember hearing his version of “People Get Ready” with Rod Stewart and it’s a sublime track:\n\nI know he also guested on Stewart’s LP Camouflage and joined the tour but quit only a few shows in. I know Rod and Jeff Beck talked about trying to record together again for years after that – up until just recently – but they couldn’t get it together. Rod wanted to do blues stuff and Jeff’s musical tastes couldn’t be confined to the blues. It was a missed opportunity if you ask me. Their relationship was a rocky one. As Jeff said when he inducted Rod into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame, “Rod and I have a love-hate relationship. He loves me and I hate him.”\n\nWhile I lost touch a bit with Jeff’s work over the years I know he did quite a few critically acclaimed records over the years like Jeff Beck’s Guitar Shop and Who Else!. Drummer Blake turned me onto the video – that I recommend highly – Live At Ronnie Scott’s. If you watch the audience on that DVD you’ll spot all kinds of rock royalty there to listen to Jeff’s guitar wizardry. While I didn’t keep up as much with his solo work, he was a guest guitarist on so many other artist’s records: Mick Jagger, Ozzy, Paul Rodgers and Roger Waters just to name a few. His amazing guitar skills were much sought after.\n\nRock and roll in the 60s was built on the backs of guitar giants like Jeff Beck. Of the three Yardbirds guitarists, Jeff probably gets the least attention. His records – from the Yardbirds to the Jeff Beck Group to his solo stuff – should be on everyone’s turntable.\n\nIt may be a Wednesday night – and I avoid drinking on weeknights – but tonight I see a tumbler of the good stuff with Truth, Blow By Blow, Wired and Beckola on the stereo. “I’ve been drinkin’ again, thinkin of when you left me.” We’ve lost a true legend today, and way too soon. As a friend of mine is fond of saying, “The guy could play.”\n\nRIP Jeff Beck, guitar legend, 24 June 1944 – 10 January 2023. It’s a sad day indeed. You will be missed.\n\nTime is short folks. Cherish every day.\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThose crafty guys in Metallica surprised me this week with a new song and have announced their new LP, entitled 72 Seasons, due out in April 2023. I keep a running list of upcoming albums in my head at all times – because I clearly have a problem – and early in 2022 I sort of took Metallica off that list. I had fully expected an album from them this year and I don’t really remember why I thought that. But then I read an interview with, I believe, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett where he said something along the lines of, “it would be impossible for Metallica to release an album any time soon.” I don’t know what the fascination is with these bands and acts wanting to surprise people with their album releases but kudos Metallica you caught me off guard!\n\nFrankly I think I can attribute some of my surprise around this new Metallica song to the fact that I haven’t quite recovered from Thanksgiving yet. I got back from Colorado fully intending to focus completely on Neil Young’s new LP World Record. But then the sad, shocking news about Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac passing away hit me. That was on the heels of guitarist Wilko Johnson finally losing his battle with cancer… it was a heavy week. I found myself going through all my Fleetwood Mac records pulling up the Christine songs. She really was fabulous. I even came across her version of “I’d Rather Go Blind” from when she was still Christine Perfect and it’s sensational. Everyone should hear that track.\n\nOn the flip side of all of that for some reason now that the holidays are actually here for real – not just Christmas music firing up on Halloween, the holidays are really upon us now – I find myself turning more and more to harder rock n roll. ‘Tis the season to crank up the righteous metal, I guess. I’ve been returning to the Guns N Roses Use Your Illusions box set to crank the live stuff (and I wake up with “You Could Be Mine” in my head most mornings), then I head to Aerosmith’s mid-70s LPs, and then it’s Ozzy’s new LP from earlier this year, Patient Number 9. I guess I’ve never been the biggest Christmas person, one might call me a bit of a reformed Grinch… but this year I’m skipping the carols and heading straight for the hard stuff, musically speaking. So this new Metallica song, “Lux AEterna” (you’ll have to excuse me misspelling the title I don’t have a key on my keyboard with a merged A and E), fits in perfectly with my holiday rocking.\n\nThis new track “Lux AEterna” is heavy. If I ever go into cardiac arrest, throw this track on the stereo, crank it up and throw my body onto the speaker. It should revive me. Hell, it could revive my grandfather and he’s been gone over forty years. But before we get to heavily into “Lux AEterna,” let’s look back and see how it compares to some of their more recent first singles. I have to admit to being more of a dabbler into Metallica prior to Death Magnetic. I liked the Black Album as did most people. I had the added benefit of seeing them at Lollapalooza and they played a bunch of songs from that LP so I went out and bought it the day after. I kind of liked Load but didn’t get into Re-Load at all. Then they went into total collapse – long time bassist Jason Newsted left, singer/guitarist James Hetfield ended up in rehab, and then they reached their creative nadir with St Anger. I was frankly kind of done with Metallica. And then I heard “The Day That Never Comes” from Death Magnetic. Something about Metallica just clicked for me in that moment. I was in the car when I heard that song and immediately diverted to the record store. That album took Metallica back to their early style of music – long epic tracks, intense guitar solos, multiple time signature changes – and I loved it. It was also the first LP to feature new bassist Robert Trujillo, formerly of Ozzy’s band. “The Day That Never Comes” is an almost 8-minute tour de force. It’s in my not so humble opinion one of their best songs. After I heard that LP, I went back and purchased all four of Metallica’s first albums and have been a big fan ever since. Sometimes it takes something weird to flip the switch in my head. That’s a hard first single to compare other stuff to, it’s that momentous.\n\nThen six years ago Metallica released “Hardwired” in anticipation of the LP Hardwired To Self Destruct. That was another awesome, heavy album. The track, “Hardwired” was one of the first things I reviewed for this blog. “Hardwired” was the opposite of “The Day That Never Comes.” It was hard and fast. It clocked in at only slightly over 3 minutes. It was so fast and hard it almost felt punk. Don’t get me wrong, I love the song, but it is a breakneck piece of rock n roll. The guitars snarl at you. Drummer Lars Ulrich hits the skins so hard you’d think he was mad at them. Although I have to admit with a chorus of “We’re so fucked, shit out of luck, hardwired to self destruct” the song seems a bit like self-fulfilling prophecy. Metallica always seems to deliver something special on those first singles.\n\n“Lux AEterna” is definitely more in the “Hardwired” category. It is also a short track, only three-and-a-half minutes long. I really like this song. I played it for the Rock Chick and after declaring it “very heavy,” admitted it’s “very good Metallica.” I think Metallica plays as many notes on these short tunes as they do on the long, epic songs they just play the notes much, much faster. Hetfield’s frantic cry of “Lux AEterna” for the chorus sounds more like an anguished spirit calling out to the Gods than a metal singer. Kirk Hammett’s guitar solo is so unhinged it sounds like he’s about to lose control of his instrument half way through. One of the things that draws me to Metallica is the amazing drumming of Lars Ulrich. He is the engine and the engine is overhearing on “Lux Eterna.” This song sounds like a prize fighting champion working on the heavy bag… It is what every metal head out there needs to get them through a difficult holiday season. Here’s the track:\n\nIf you’re like me, a Metallica fan, or a fan of hard rock or heavy metal, put this track on for the holidays to drowned out Mariah Carey. My advice on this one is to turn it up as loud as it’ll go but beforehand secure all the fine china and glassware. It’s going to be a rocking spring with 72 Seasons.\n\nCheers and Devil Horns to all of you!!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOnly a few days ago I posted about the new Guns N Roses box set celebrating the Use Your Illusions albums. I’m still waking up with the words “With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue you get noooooothing done…” lodged in my head every morning and yet here I am already posting again. Knowing I’m headed to points out West for the upcoming Thanksgiving Holiday I holed up all weekend in the B&V labs listening to the new archival live album put out by the folks down at Experience Hendrix – who really do a nice job with Jimi’s legacy – entitled Los Angeles Forum – April 26, 1969 so I could post before I leave. I think I’m like most folks when I think about Hendrix, I just think about Jimi the Guitar God. I tend to overlook the fact that it wasn’t just Hendrix, it was the Jimi Hendrix Experience. And the Experience were quite a band. Listening to this live album one might say that seeing them live was quite, well, an experience. Joining Jimi in the band were Noel Redding (a frustrated guitarist) on bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums. One of our very first posts was about a Hendrix live album/documentary, Freedom: Atlanta Pop Festival (Live). Although by that show in Hot’lanta on the Fourth of July 1970, Noel Redding had split and had been replaced by Billy Cox on bass. We do so love our live LPs here at B&V.\n\nAh, April 1969, what a time to be alive! Well, technically I was alive in 1969 but I was just an infant so not really cognizant. I’d have probably been frightened by the sound of an electric guitar turned up to 11. It was a stressful time for Jimi and the Experience. They’d released Electric Ladyland in 1968 and it was an absolute masterpiece. But the follow-up proved to be elusive. Jimi was searching for something. He had built his Electric Ladyland studio in New York, a state of the art facility which he felt he needed to get the sounds he wanted. However the recording process was terribly erratic. They’d go out on the road for a few days, fly back to New York and record for a day or two and then back out on the road. Touring was still a bit of a hodgepodge in those days, not the organized machine it is today. They couldn’t really just focus on making a record. Hendrix would often go out to clubs to party and end up at the studio in the wee small hours with a bunch of hangers on and try and record. It was tough to get anything done and Noel Redding for one was very frustrated with the chaos. By April of ’69 when this concert was recorded Redding was a mere two months away from leaving the Experience.\n\nI know that many of you are thinking, What another live album from Hendrix? At this point it seems like Jimi could have dropped a guitar in 1970 and if it made a sound through the amplifier that was recorded in anyway, it’s been remixed, remastered and released on a record. Every note the guy played that was committed to tape is out there somewhere – some on bootleg, some officially released. This show from the L.A. Forum has been around on bootleg for a long time but it’s new to me and I can only assume the sound quality is much improved over any boot. I love any live stuff we can get from Hendrix because every show and every solo was different. Listening to the Experience live – or later incarnations of Hendrix’s bands – is like listening to jazz masters jamming and improvising. Every nuance is wrung out of every song but different every time. Hendrix was a rock star with a jazz guy’s approach to live performing. So for me the short answer is, Yes! Another live album from Hendrix! If you’re a fan of Hendrix or a fan of guitar, this album is for you.\n\nI get the feeling from listening to Los Angeles Forum – April 26, 1969 that the crowd was pretty unruly that night. The cops come over the PA a few times and Hendrix himself addresses the crowd to mellow out so the band could keep playing. It was spring and I imagine that’s a pretty wild time in California. Especially in ’69. With Redding frustrated and probably contemplating leaving it’s not a stretch to suggest this is the sound of a band who weren’t getting along. Although even that doesn’t stop Hendrix from laying down some tasty riffs. Listening to this album what jumped out at me was how great a drummer Mitch Mitchell was. I don’t ever hear his name mentioned in the same whispered tones of reverence that Keith Moon or Charlie Watts are, but the guy is feral on the drums. He and Hendrix soar on this record while the aforementioned Noel Redding plays the bass almost like a time keeper. Redding’s bass acts as the foundation here while the Hendrix and Mitchell play off each other like Jimmy Page and John Bonham.\n\nI don’t know if it was the chaotic energy of the crowd pressing up against the stage but this album is a loose, jammy affair. There are several long (over ten or fifteen minute) jams. The band is introduced and much like another live LP by the Experience that I have, Winterland, Hendrix comes out and has to apologize while he gets his guitar sorted out. I don’t know if Jimi was too cheap to hire a proper guitar tech or they couldn’t find one but did he ever get on stage ready to play? Once he sorts out his instrument they launch into what must have been a live staple for them, a long, jammy instrumental “Tax Free.” It’s also the opener on the aforementioned Winterland. The song even come with a drum solo. It’s interesting to listen to the guys play off each other but it’s not going on the greatest hits album. I wonder if that tune is just how the band warmed up?\n\nAfter the jam, they launch into a compact, snarling yet slinky version of “Foxey Lady.” I love Hendrix’s solo at the end of the track. Hendrix was quite chatty that evening. He seems to be having a lot of fun despite the crowd issues. The version of “Red House” is worth the price of admission in my mind. It’s a long, extended blues tune and I am here for it. It gets almost jazz like in the middle. I could listen to that track all day on a repeating loop. Hendrix then dedicates “Spanish Castle Magic” to the police at the show. It’s an impressive version of the Axis: Bold As Love track. Hendrix then launches into his soon to be iconic “Star Spangled Banner” which segues into the righteous riffage of “Purple Haze.” Once again with the cops on his mind he sings, “Excuse me while I kiss this policeman.” The extended fiery solo could possibly melt your face off. After that searing song Hendrix has to ask the crowd to mellow out again. They must have been rushing the stage again. He asks everybody to sit down which I think would be impossible at a Hendrix show.\n\nMitch Mitchell unleashes some tribal drumming on “I Don’t Live Today.” This is a wildly chaotic version of the track which probably fit right in on this particular night in front of these unruly hippies. The show wraps up with my all time favorite riff from Hendrix on “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)” which segues into “Sunshine Of Your Love,” a Cream cover and then back into “Voodoo Child (Slight Return).” While the second half of “Voodoo Child” is only three minutes it’s some of Hendrix’s most ferocious solo’ing of the show.\n\nWhile the setlist is shorter than other live sets I’ve seen from Hendrix – I’m guessing they had to cut it short because of the lack of crowd control – there is still a lot to love here. I’m always up for a good Hendrix live concert recording. Like I said, if you’re a fan of the guitar – and especially hearing what the absolute farthest someone can take the instrument – or of Hendrix this will be essential listening when you’re trying to drowned out your fractious Thanksgiving dinner conversation. “What Uncle Tim, you think serving the meal family style is socialist? Frankly, I think Mitch Mitchell is a criminally underrated drummer…” Or something like that.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to all of you out there who are celebrating this week in the States. Even if you’re not celebrating Thanksgiving we have a lot of to be grateful for in this life not least of which is rock n roll music. Be kind to each other. Eat a whole lot this Thursday, drink something brown and murky and play this one loud!!\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“It’s one of those days that I don’t believe in Jesus…” – Ozzy Osbourne, “One of Those Days”\n\nI can’t tell you how good it feels to have a new Ozzy album out in the world. It’s like having your favorite, cool uncle who used to slip you beers at wedding receptions in town for a long visit. Ozzy went a decade between 2010’s Scream and his next album 2020’s surprise comeback LP Ordinary Man. We loved Ordinary Man here at B&V. But then we’ve been an Ozzy fan from the start. Well, almost from the start. I merely taped a friend’s copy of Blizzard of Ozz. At the time I was actually more into the Dio incarnation of Sabbath but there’s room for both in any record collection. My first Ozzy album purchase was actually Diary Of A Madman, his second LP. I had to wait until I was in college to finally see Ozzy live on the Ultimate Sin tour in Wichita. Jake E. Lee was his latest guitar wizard in 1986 and it was a great show.\n\nRather than waiting a decade for another album, apparently only four days after Ordinary Man came out, Ozzy grabbed producer/guitarist Andrew Watt and headed back into the studio to record the follow-up. I really like Andrew Watt as a producer. Besides Ozzy he also produced the fabulous Eddie Vedder solo LP, Earthling. The strategy on this LP was very similar to the last album – recruit top notch players and rock out. Much is being made about the all-star cast of guitarists who play on this album, but there are great musicians on every instrument here. While Chad Smith mans the drum kit for most of the songs on Patient Number 9, like he did on Ordinary Man, there are a few tracks where the late Taylor Hawkins drums. It makes me wonder if these songs were Hawkins’ last recorded tunes? Metallica’s Robert Trujillo, who actually played in Ozzy’s band before joining Metallica, plays bass on most of the tracks. But, Duff McKagan from Guns N Roses mans the bass on several of the tracks. And former Jane’s Addiction bassist Chris Chaney plays on “Nothing Feels Right.”\n\nWhen you have a bunch of guest stars playing on an album I always wonder about continuity. Will the songs hang together well as an album? Recently Edgar Winter did a fabulous tribute album for his brother Johnny, creatively titled Brother Johnny. There was a host of guitarists who showed up to pay tribute to the late, great bluesman. I felt the album, reviewed in these pages, held together well because all the tunes were in a blues framework. I think despite all the guest appearances Patient Number 9 holds together so well as an album because a) it’s all in a heavy metal framework which keeps everyone rocking in the same direction and b) the base band for this album: Andrew Watt/guitar, Robert Trujillo/bass, and Chad Smith drums – who all play on a majority of the tunes – hold the continuity together from Eric Clapton to Metal Viking Zakk Wylde. It doesn’t matter who plays lead guitar, they have to play with the band. Everybody, including Ozzy, plays with enthusiasm and gusto. Despite some heavy themes you can feel the joy coming off this album.\n\nIt’s clear Ozzy has mortality on his mind. With titles like “Dead And Gone,” “Immortal” and “Mr. Darkness” it’s not hard to figure out where Ozzy’s head is at. But in the years since Ordinary Man the Ozzman has “been through hell.” He was diagnosed with Parkinsons. He got Covid. It’s a wonder he got this album out. While I doubt he’ll ever tour extensively again I think having this wonderful metal LP is a blessing. I can understand after all he’s been through why Ozzy sings, as I quoted above, about it being “One of those days that I don’t believe in Jesus.” I think we’ve all had those moments when we feel abandoned by Fate. I will say, and it was the Rock Chick who noticed this first, Ozzy’s voice does sound a bit treated on this album. It’s auto-tuned in quite a few places. But hey, it’s Ozzy I can forgive that. And again, you can tell everyone including Ozzy had so much fun on this project the heaviness doesn’t get to you.\n\nI just love this album. If push came to shove I’d probably admit I liked Ordinary Man just a smidge more but that’s mostly because it’d been 10 freakin’ years since we’d heard from Ozzy and it was such a pleasant surprise. There is a lot to like here. As promised it’s a smorgasbord of guitarists. Ozzy managed to get two of the three former Yardbird guitarists to play on this record. Jimmy Page was approached and declined but I don’t think Jimmy plays that much any more which is a shame. Mercurial Jeff Beck plays lead on two of my favorite tracks here. I love the title track which features Beck’s fabulous solo’ing but I reviewed “Patient Number 9” already. Beck also plays on the power ballad “A Thousand Shades” and his playing is so melodic it’s one of the absolute highlights of the LP. Jeff Beck needs to rock out more. I was stunned when I read Clapton agreed to play on this album. He shows up on “One Of Those Days,” quoted above. I don’t know how they did it but Clapton plays like he’s still in Cream. It’s a great solo and perhaps the best solo Clapton has played since he guested on the Steve Winwood tune “Dirty City.” (Seriously, check that tune out).\n\nWhile much has been made of Ozzy getting the former Yardbirds to play on this record for me two of the best moments on this album are when Ozzy teams up with his erstwhile bandmate from Black Sabbath, Tony Iommi. Those two go together like peanut butter (a substance I was forced to give up) and jelly. “Degradation Rules,” reviewed previously, an ode to masturbation – although I can’t decide if it’s pro or con – is a wonderful, sludgy metal tune and sounds like an outtake from Masters of Reality. Iommi’s guitar is unmistakable. Ozzy even plays some harmonica on the track, which I love. The other Iommi track is the epic “No Escape From Now.” It starts off like the spooky “Planet Caravan” from Paranoid but then the band shifts through several time changes. They go fast, they slow down. Then the band falls away and Iommi drops some of the heaviest riffage I’ve heard since Vol 4. His solo’ing on this song is so epic and beautiful it belongs in an opera.\n\nPearl Jam’s Mike McCready shows up on the heavy track “Immortal.” His solo verges on Eddie Van Halen territory. Many notes are shredded. It’s wonderful. He really acquits himself well here. Dave Navarro of Janes Addiction (and briefly the Red Hot Chili Peppers) shows up on the other power ballad here “God Only Knows” and it’s actually one of my favorite tracks. There’s a track on here that doesn’t credit any lead guitarist, “Dead And Gone” that is also an absolute highlight. It takes me back to “Shot In The Dark” just a bit. I’m guessing Andrew Watt saved that solo for himself. Although I’ve heard that Josh Homme from the Queens of the Stone Age played on here somewhere – I can’t find him in the credits – and maybe it’s him. All of these are great moments.\n\nOzzy’s longest tenured guitarist Zakk Wylde shows up on more tunes than any other guest guitarist. The guy is just a Heavy Metal Viking. He’s got to be a head taller than Ozzy. I saw them together on the Black Rain tour and it sounded like an airplane landing in the arena. My favorite of the Zakk tunes is probably “Evil Shuffle.” That’s pretty much how the Rock Chick sees me walking through the house – with my evil shuffle. Its a typical, HEAVY Zakk tune. “Mr. Darkness” about an obsessed fan “stanning” over Ozzy is another Zakk highlight. “Nothing Feels Right” which was released as the third single could be seen as Ozzy giving us the state of his health over Zakk’s soaring guitar. It’s all great stuff.\n\nIf I had any complaint about this record – and I don’t really – it’s that it feels a little longer than the sixty minute running time. They likely could have edited a few things out. There’s a little bluesy throwaway at the end, “Darkside Blues,” where Ozzy again plays harmonica that they could have cut. It’s only a minute and a half long. Although I kind of wish they’d fleshed that out into an actual tune because well, I love the blues. They could have cut the “scary monster, b-movie, horror film” intro on the title track. And they likely could have cut one of the four Zakk tracks to streamline this thing a little bit. But again, complaining about too much Ozzy on an album is like complaining about too much money in your checking account.\n\nThis is a great album and a wonderful celebration of the man, the myth, Ozzy Osbourne. The Ozzy comeback or renaissance continues strong on Patient Number 9. I’ll probably spend most of my weekend up in the B&V lounge cranking this metal mayhem up to 11 and spilling Woodford Reserve on the carpet. This one is a must have for all you hard rockers out there. Enjoy this one at max volume!\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
