        "text": "British electronica outfit UNKLE have just finished recording their sixth album End Titles… Stories For Film. Depending on how cynical you are - the generous duo/doctors of pre-release hype - are giving away four new album tracks from four different websites to celebrate.\n\nIt's actually a fair chunk of the album (tracks 5, 6, 7 and 8 to be precise) and although you have to download them separately, they'll play as one extended mix of music when played consecutively - a nice touch.\n\nNew song Chemical features Queens Of The Stone Age's Josh Homme on vocals and Blade In The Back features unsigned acoustic fellow Gavin Clark."
