        "text": "Rick Shelley had a batch of songs unlike anything he had ever written.\n\nShelley, 50, was part of the low desert rock scene of the 1980s and ‘90s. He played with the jam band, Woodshed, and the Iggy Pop-influenced RagTag, featuring future Queens of the Stone Age bassist Nick Oliveri. But he had written some songs with a lonely weariness, like “Easy Lies” and “The Bed I Made,” singing like a forlorn guy who has benignly accepted his fate.\n\nShelley went to a well-known Palm Springs studio where many of his low desert colleagues, and even Doors guitarist Robby Krieger record. The owner-engineer liked his material but he wanted studio musicians to record the tracks and let Shelley lay down the vocals. It’s the way most major studios work. It didn’t feel right to Shelley. Not for those organic songs.\n\nA friend told him about a new studio off a dirt road in northern Joshua Tree called High Lonesome. It’s owned by Georgia native Chris Unck, who is playing in the Joshua Tree Music Festival next month and has also recorded with a group called Adobe Collective. Unck welcomed Shelley like a guy offering water to man lost in the desert.\n\n“The atmosphere of the place was unassuming and comfortable,” Shelley said. “It felt like I do when I’m at home. I knew instantaneously, ‘I’m going to record here.’”\n\nShelley recorded an EP and then an album released in February titled “Hope Wrapped in Razor Wire.” Both received CV Music Award nominations.\n\nINTRO: High desert, east valley music scenes are in full bloom\n\nThe singer-guitarist knows Joshua Tree's mystique. Woodshed recorded at Rancho de la Luna, a Joshua Tree studio made famous by the recordings of Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, and played GramFest: The Cosmic American Music Festival that saluted Gram Parsons annually from 1997 to 2006. He credits the quiet, embracing high desert culture for helping to bring his musical ideas to fruition.\n\n“The songs were written down here,” he said. “But I don’t know if (they) would have been realized in any other place with any other group of people. It came together magically with the right players at the right time.”\n\nMusicians have been moving to the high desert region of Morongo Valley to Twentynine Palms in gold rush fashion the past few years to mine its mystique. Barnett English, who has produced two Joshua Tree Music Festivals at the Joshua Tree Lake Campground since 2003, says there are 35 to 40 recording studios in the area.\n\nThe studios range from small home studios owned by the likes of Gram Rabbit co-founders Todd Rutherford and Jesika von Rabbit, and Masters of Reality leader and Queens of the Stone Age producer Chris Goss, to high grade studios owned by classical composer Jarrod Radnich, and the Pink Satellite studio owned by Motocross champion Chris Haines and operated by Queen music director Spike Edney.\n\nEdney’s primary home is England, but he’s had a small house in Joshua Tree since 2004. He says a gravitational pull draws him and other musicians to the high desert.\n\n“I’ve always wondered what it is that makes me want to come back here and think about it while I’m away,” Edney said inside his studio. “There is a magnetism and whether it’s a real, actual magnetism or whether it’s something imagined&mldr; We had some guests that came out here, musicians, and one of the wives stood looking out across the desert and said, ‘There’s something here that when you look out and see this view and breathe this air, it makes you feel that anything is possible.’ I think when you’re up here and you’re looking for creativity, you can find it.”\n\nMORE MUSIC: 20 albums to discover the high desert sound\n\nSpiritual legacy\n\nArtists, musicians and philosophers have long been drawn to the area.\n\nEdwin John Dingle, one of the first Westerners to study at a monastery in Tibet, founded the Institute of Mentalphysics (now the Joshua Tree Retreat Center) in Joshua Tree in 1941, at age 60, after saying he was spiritually guided to an energy vortex on Highway 62. Frank Lloyd Wright designed Dingle’s Joshua Tree home and his son, Lloyd Wright, completed the surrounding compound.\n\nArtists and expatriate movie studio “seekers” studied Dingle’s Science of Mentalphysics, espousing “the oneness of life embodied in all substance, energy and thought.” It was far from a narrow religious cult. Its metaphysical book store also sold Robert Collier’s volumes of “Secrets of the Ages” and Emmet Fox’s “Power Through Constructive Thinking.”\n\nMany of those same retired Hollywood actors, directors and producers built the Hi-Desert Cultural Center in 1964, incorporating it as a nonprofit in 1967 to promote “dramatic, musical, visual, and other forms of artistic expression.”\n\nA new generation of entertainers and spiritual seekers began arriving in the 1960s. The late Ted Markland, a co-star of “The High Chaparral” from 1967-‘69, was attracted to the high desert by a series of UFO conventions at the Integratron in Landers, built by former aircraft mechanic George Van Tassel after reportedly receiving telepathic instructions from Venus.\n\nMarkland was friends with a Chumash medicine man he knew from Hollywood named Grandfather Semu Huaute. He had participated in Indian peyote rituals since the late 1950s and studied the teachings of the 11th century Tibetan Buddhist, Milarepa.\n\nHe found a hill on the Yucca Valley side of the then-Joshua Tree National Monument where he had a series of metaphysical experiences. He began taking show biz friends to his hill to “hear the voice of God.” In 1967, he hosted the wedding of LSD guru Timothy Leary in that section of the Monument, and LSD was consumed liberally.\n\nAmong the celebrities Markland accompanied to Joshua Tree were Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and Gram Parsons of the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers. Markland said in 2006, “I can’t figure what the big thing about Gram was. He was just a singer. He OD’d on drugs.”\n\nHe overdosed in the Joshua Tree Inn in 1973, but, rather than let his family bury him, his friend and tour manager, Phil Kaufman, honored a pact they made to scatter his ashes in Joshua Tree National Monument. He stole the coffin containing Parson's body at Los Angeles International Airport before it could be shipped to his family home in Louisiana. Then he took it to the Monument and set it on fire at Cap Rock. His actions became so legendary, it was made into a 2003 movie titled “Grand Theft Parsons.”\n\nVON RABBIT: High desert hurdle may now give music priestess a lift\n\nArtists from The Doors and the Eagles to “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels took psychedelics, such as magic mushrooms, in Joshua Tree in the 1960s and '70s. But the working musicians and artists moved to the area more gradually.\n\nBritish folk-rock singer Donovan took a break from his career to raise his family there in the 1980s. Jim Yester, who sang the lead on “Along Comes Mary” with the Association, also bought a Joshua Tree home that decade. Victoria Williams and “King of Surf Guitar” Dick Dale moved to the high desert around 1990. Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Markland friend Eric Burdon, who had lived in the low desert since the 1960s, bought a house there in the early 2000s.\n\nWhen asked why psychedelics were so popular in the desert, Burdon said, \"It's easier to find God there than on Van Nuys Boulevard.\"\n\nMusical migration\n\nToday, the high desert is filled with working musicians. English said he’s featuring more local artists than ever at his festival next month with nine. He had previously averaged five to seven local musicians at that global festival and his roots festival in October.\n\n“I’d like to make more room because there are just so many,” he said. “The town has slowly been attracting artists over time and now it’s reached the point, ‘Hey, look around, there’s a lot. It’s not just Eric Burdon and Victoria Williams, who were here 20 years ago. It’s really become a thick scene.\n\n“People say, ‘What’s a big music town?’ and people say, Brooklyn and Portland, Austin and Seattle. But this definitely has something unique. If you consider the ratio of the population to the number of artists, our ratio is way higher.”\n\nRancho de la Luna owner Dave Catching was so busy when Shelley was looking for a studio, it inspired him to go to High Lonesome. Catching had been recording major acts like the Arctic Monkeys, the Hives, Unkle and Mark Lanegan since the late 1990s when Homme organized some jam sessions with studio founder Fred Drake known as the Desert Sessions.\n\n“Josh was a huge fan of Fred’s drumming – and of Fred – so he would come up and record with Fred,” said Catching, a guitarist with Eagles of Death Metal and Earthlings¿. “We started with people we knew and then it started growing to outside people. That definitely helped the studio. I think that’s why 95 percent of the people drawn here want to record here – because of Josh’s involvement.”\n\nJOSH HOMME AND JESSE HUGHES: Not letting Paris define them\n\nNow the Rancho is attracting international artists.\n\n“I just had a band from Norway called Motorpscyho,” Catching said. “The bass player has a country band called Sugarfoot and they just finished their second album here in January.”\n\nBritish musician Rocco Gardner recorded an album with Catching in 2012. He became so infatuated with the area, he bought a house on 40 acres near Pappy and Harriet’s and recently bought another 100 acres. He unveiled his Rancho V studio last year and added Airstream trailers for visiting recording artists. Chris Thorn of Blind Melon and Peaches are among the artists he’s recorded there.\n\n“When I first came here (in 2004), or even when I bought the ranch, it was just kind of rock and roll,” Gardner said. “It was Catching, Queens of the Stone Age and those guys. That’s what grabbed me about it. Then there was this sort of hipster arrival.\n\n“I have no negative feelings about more people arriving. La Copine (Kitchen) is getting reviewed nationally. When you see 40 people standing outside a café on Old Woman Springs Road at 9 o’clock in the morning, all looking quite trendy, you know it’s happening.\"\n\nUnck, Edney, Catching and Gardner all have studios accessible only by dirt roads. That's one of the attractions of having recording studios in the middle of nowhere. There's no one around to complain about the noise.\n\nEdney said he didn’t get excited about Haines’ idea to build the Pink Satellite until he discovered how much talent there was in the region.\n\n“I keep being introduced (to musicians) by our good friend Bobby Furgo, who is a high desert icon, and his musical mate, Robbi Robb, who is a producer and a bandleader,” he said. “They have extensive connections with the known musicians and the lesser musicians. I’m quite intrigued by the lesser known musicians.”\n\nEdney served as a judge at the last two Tachevah Music Showcases at Pappy and Harriet’s to find musicians he might like to record at the Pink Satellite. But he’s discovering talent all over.\n\nREAD MORE: East valley is an incubator for young musicians\n\n“The quality and singing and musicianship is very inspiring,” he said. “We had a little showcase and eight or nine people I’d never heard of, and they could all sing and play really well. I’ve seen similar events where people cannot sing and play, even though they think they can.”\n\nFestival boom\n\nThe explosion of studios has corresponded with a growth of boutique music festivals. Jon McKinney, who founded GramFest, folded his three-day Parsons tribute in 2006 because he said his festival had brought attention to the country rock progenitor, but it was now, “promoting all the products for Sony and Warner Bros.”\n\nDavid Lowery, leader of Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, started his Campout at Pappy and Harriet’s in 2005, featuring both bands and supporting acts like Gram Rabbit over a weekend in September. The Clean Air, Clean Skies Festival started at Pappy and Harriet’s in 2007 and, after a short hiatus, returned as the Desert Stars Festival, specializing in the psychedelic sound that is part of the high desert heritage. Its headliners included Krieger, the Dandy Warhols and Dinosaur Jr.*\n\nThe Joshua Tree Retreat Center, which had long produced retreats with speakers such as reincarnation advocate Shirley MacLaine, began promoting Eastern spiritual-oriented music and yoga festivals with its first Bhakti Fest in September 2009. Then it presented the female-focused Shakti Fest in May 2011, a UFO convention called Contact in the Desert and a “flow art” retreat fueled by fire games called the IgNght Conference in 2013. Earlier this month, a Sam Nam Fest focused on music and healing.\n\nThe Retreat Center expanded in a more secular direction last year with an event billed as a spiritual concert by hip-hop star Childish Gambino. The much-lauded Desert Daze Festival followed with diverse rockers including Primus, Television and Deerhunter.\n\nThe dizzying pace has required some adjustment for long-time residents like von Rabbit.\n\n“I’ve definitely seen this place get a lot more trendy,” she said. “I sound like a real old person: ‘Who are these kids coming in here?’ I have to catch myself. ‘Jesika, you sound like the people who own the farm by Woodstock.’ But you want to keep that little secret to yourself.”\n\nTHE TRIBESMEN: This east valley instrumental band does not need a vocalist\n\nTerry Taylor-Castillo, interim director of the Joshua Tree Retreat Center, said it may slow down a bit. The Childish Gambino concert was “a unique situation,” she said, and, “I don’t see that happening again.”\n\nIt may have been spiritual, but it provoked controversy in Joshua Tree. English said it was a bad fit for the area.\n\n“I think because of where the Retreat Center is,” he said. “It’s located right on the highway and there’s a neighborhood across the street with quite a few houses. So, to have outdoor music there past midnight really is a square peg in a round hole. They (also) ended up grading like three acres of supposedly protected desert land, and that just got everybody up in arms.”\n\nThe Desert Daze promoters have a contract for another fall festival at the Retreat Center, but Taylor-Castillo said, “It’s not something we really want to concentrate on in the future.”\n\nThe center is now reassessing its direction after parting company with executive director Victoria Gevoian. Taylor-Castillo said she’d like to have more community events with local musicians, but only spiritually-focused big events.\n\n“We are bringing in some new things, but they’re mostly like yoga retreats, shamanistic things, cleanses, personal growth, silent retreats,” said Taylor-Castillo, who runs the Taylor Junction art gallery in Joshua Tree in addition to serving on the Retreat Center board. “I really don’t see that our future will be (secular) music festivals.”\n\nThe Joshua Tree Lake Campground, which is now preparing for the May 18 Joshua Tree Music Festival, also has expanded its offering. It recently hosted a nudity-allowed “adult carnival” for the L.A. League of Arts, an organization associated with Burning Man that produces the Burning Man Decompression Arts and Music Festival in Los Angeles.\n\nSally Jayes, co-owner of the campground with her husband, Ken, was on the Joshua Tree Chamber of Commerce from the late 1990s to 2003-’04, and she says the chamber laid out a welcome mat for musicians and artists then.\n\n“I got off because the chamber was there for commerce, for business,” she said, “and the people that were there wanted to move to art. That’s fine for downtown, but it’s not commerce.”\n\nGenie out of the bottle*\n\nRobyn Celia and Linda Krantz recall the high desert as “a completely different animal in 2003.”\n\nCelia was performing in a New York rock band called Lava Baby in the 1990s and Krantz was a props mistress in the film industry. Krantz stayed at the Pioneertown Hotel and went back to New York and told Celia about this crazy saloon, called Pappy and Harriet’s, built as a movie set for cowboy actors back in 1946. Celia and Krantz bought it in 2003 with their credit cards.\n\n“When I came out here, (the music community) was only one family; everybody knew each other,” Celia said. “At that time at Pappy’s, everybody wanted country music. It took us a really long time to not get the phone calls, like, ‘Is it country? Oh, God, it’s not?’ Now my best nights are if (Seattle grunge progenitors) the Melvins are playing.”*\n\nThis is Pappy's busiest time of the year with Coachella bands playing sold-out shows between its two weekends. But Pappy's also has presented Robert Plant, attracted by a Wanda Jackson show, crooner Rufus Wainwright playing a cabaret show and, of course, Paul McCartney performing between Desert Trip shows last October.\n\nCelia says the rapid high desert growth began with the recession.\n\n“When everybody else was panicking, I feel this area exploded because people couldn’t afford to go overseas or couldn’t afford to take an expensive vacation,” she said. “So they started to discover this area. It all happened at the same time. When people discovered Pappy’s, they discovered the Integratron and the park. If you look at the park’s numbers each year, it’s amazing.”\n\nDESERT MAG: High desert artists shift a growing music scene\n\nLike Pappy’s, you can’t just roll up to Joshua Tree National Park and expect to get into a campsite anymore. The park set an attendance record with 2 million visitors in 2015, and then drew 500,000 more in 2016. Now it’s encouraging visitors to reserve private sites out of the park.\n\nThe Joshua Tree Music Festival also sets new attendance records every year, but last year it had its biggest jump ever – up more than 12 percent to 4,100 people. English says he’ll cap attendance at 4,500.\n\n“To be honest, that size would allow us to still keep the ticket price reasonable,\" he said. \"We could produce a really nice show and you and I could still run into each other instead of having to text. I don’t want to be in the business of running a big show because then I’m just in the port-a-(potty) and security business.”\n\nHidden scene\n\nDespite the rapid growth at Joshua Tree National Park and Pappy and Harriet’s, the music scene in between remains relatively invisible to outsiders. Pete Stahl, who began recording at Rancho de la Luna in the mid-1990s and then introduced his former Washington D.C. bandmate, Foo Fighters leader Dave Grohl, to the studio in 1997, says he gets the same feeling coming to Joshua Tree from L.A. that he did 25 years ago.\n\n“It still feels the same to me,” said Stahl, who had driven in for a session with the Earthlings¿. “Obviously there are more people coming in and out of the park, but it still feels special. There’s a certain quietness to the desert and a light, and that’s the same. It’s that kind of magical atmosphere that is attractive.”\n\n“For me, it’s quiet there and when I go, it’s not busy,” said Shelley. “Where Chris (Unck)’s place is, it’s out in the middle of nowhere. So you can let yourself dig into your thoughts a little bit deeper than maybe you would with a lot of the stimulus you might get in the city. And it is a beautiful place.”\n\nEven the musicians who live there are so isolated, they aren’t aware of all the local studios or even some significant musicians in the community. Edney praised Ted Quinn for being “a magnet for aspiring musicians of all ages and all genres” with his Tuesday open mic night at the Joshua Tree Saloon and online radio show from the Joshua Tree Lounge, where he recorded his recent album, “1.11” live – before doing overdubs at Jamie Hafler’s Ghost of Future Records studio in Joshua Tree.\n\nCatching had no idea how many other studios there were in the high desert. He said he doesn’t go out much in Joshua Tree because he’s either recording or decompressing from a tour. English said that’s typical of the working musicians.\n\n“Most people are very independent, DIY-type of people anyway,” he said. “That’s why they’re out here in the middle of nowhere with their own studio. So, people could be up here for years and not know someone that lives up on the other side of the rocks.”\n\nVon Rabbit hadn’t heard of Radnich, the 34-year-old president and chairman of the Hi-Desert Cultural Center, founder of the Joshua Tree Philharmonic, and an internationally known classical composer and pianist who has appeared on NBC’s “The Today Show.”\n\nRADNICH ON PIANO: See him play music from 'Pirates of Caribbean'\n\nRadnich, a Joshua Tree native, isn't surprised that there's a whole community of musicians who don't know each or realize how many studios there are in Joshua Tree.\n\n“There really is a dichotomy in the Joshua Tree music scene,” he said, “and, in fact, that name says a lot. There’s the scene with those who perform locally or semi-locally, and whose music income is driven by live entertainment – where one needs to literally be seen by your audience – and then there are industry professionals who produce product not dependent on live performance, but who have products that have captured a global market. There really is little mixing between these two groups of musicians, as their focus is so very different.”\n\nBut Radnich is excited about re-opening the Hi-Desert Cultural Center’s main theater and showing the local musicians its improved sound quality for recording and live shows.\n\n“The Cultural Center was almost exclusively live theater for most of its existence,” he said. “It wasn’t originally designed to be a great music venue. However, Joshua Tree and the surrounding areas will soon finally find itself with a world class music and performance venue.”\n\n*An earlier version of this story contained incorrect names."
