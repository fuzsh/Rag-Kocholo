        "text": "Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age will be offering a private workshop to students from the Fairfax School of Rock today and two other nearby Schools of Rock. Homme will play some of his songs with the SOR kids, then, they will play those same songs for him. Homme will then do a Q and A session for 20 minutes, followed by a meet and greet.\n\nBy inspiring the world to rock on stage and in life, The School of Rock transforms the lives of kids and adults through music. School of Rock performance-based music schools offer lessons in guitar, bass, keyboard, drums and vocals. Genres of music studied include, Rock, Reggae, Motown, Blues, Pop, Metal, etc. The schools offer individual lessons and performance classes, summer camps and workshops. School of Rock just hit its 15 year milestone and has more than 100 locations nationwide.\n\nThe School of Rock music programs are designed to create a supportive environment where music students of all skill levels are comfortable yet challenged. In addition to individual private music instruction, students also learn how to jam with their peers in a weekly practice session. The team dynamic creates a supportive and motivating environment where kids feel inspired to excel and, eventually, perform together as a rock band in front of live audiences.\n\nBecause of the School of Rock’s commitment to develop and nurture the next generation of rockers, often, famous musicians will visit the schools and offer workshops. This is the case Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and his visit to the School of Rock of Fairfax. Homme is the band’s singer, primary songwriter and guitarist. He is also a former member of the band, Kyuss.\n\nWHEN: Friday, March 22, 2013 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.schoolofrock.com."
