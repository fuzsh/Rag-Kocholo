        "text": "Sarah Banet-Weiser: Dean of Penn’s Annenberg School for Communication\n\nSarah Banet-Weiser has been named dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, effective August 14, 2023. The announcement was made on July 17 by Penn President Liz Magill and Provost John L. Jackson Jr.\n\nDr. Banet-Weiser, a globally renowned communication and media studies scholar, currently serves as the Lauren Berlant Professor of Communication at Penn’s Annenberg School. She also holds an appointment as a research professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. She is the founding director of the Center for Collaborative Communication, a first-of-its-kind partnership between the two Annenberg Schools.\n\nDr. Banet-Weiser has held leadership roles at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where she headed the media and communications department from 2018 to 2021, and at USC Annenberg, where she served as director of the School for Communication from 2014 to 2018 and vice dean from 2017 to 2018. In total, she was a member of the USC Annenberg faculty for 19 years.\n\n“Sarah Banet-Weiser has a stellar record as an astute, effective, and visionary leader and is a deeply respected voice in the field of communication,” said President Magill. “For more than 60 years, the Annenberg School has been at the forefront of this essential, dynamic, and ever-changing field. Sarah Banet-Weiser’s record of accomplishment and leadership qualities make her the ideal person to lead Annenberg into its next era of excellence.”\n\nDr. Banet-Weiser is a prolific, creative, and influential scholar. She has authored or edited eight books, as well as dozens of peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and essays. Her work focuses on how women, communities of color, and youth use media; how they create identity and culture, and engage in politics. Her latest book (co-authored with Kathryn Higgins), Believability: Sexual Violence, Media, and the Politics of Doubt (Polity, 2023), explores the convergence of the #MeToo movement and the crisis of post-truth.\n\n“It is a tremendous privilege to work at the University of Pennsylvania and the Annenberg School for Communication, and an honor to be appointed as Annenberg’s next dean,” said Dr. Banet-Weiser. “This is a moment of great importance and excitement in the field of communication and media, when thinking globally has never been more urgent, when political divisions and affiliations are shaped and enhanced by information and data, when we all inhabit an ever-changing world of media and culture, when we need to create policy about health practices, the climate crisis, and beyond. I could ask for nothing more than to work with the brilliant faculty, staff, students, and alumni of Annenberg on tackling the important issues of our time.”\n\nDr. Banet-Weiser’s leadership track record is especially notable for her global engagement, her success as a fundraiser, and her commitment to diversity, equity, and belonging. At USC, she created an institute on diversity and difference in media and communication, the Institute for Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg (IDEA). She led the London School of Economics and Political Science’s department of media and communications through the COVID-19 pandemic while championing cross-school collaboration and global engagement.\n\nA fellow of the International Communication Association (ICA), Dr. Banet-Weiser has received numerous scholarly, mentoring, and teaching awards, including the ICA Outstanding Book Award for her 2012 book Authentic™: The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture (NYU Press) and the Mellon Graduate Student Mentoring Award. She serves on the editorial board of several top journals in the field of communication and media studies, and she has held international fellowships and visiting professorships at, among others, the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme in Paris; the University of Lisbon, Portugal; and McGill University in Montreal.\n\nShe received her BA, MA, and PhD, all in communication, from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nDr. Banet-Weiser succeeds John L. Jackson Jr., who served as the Walter H. Annenberg Dean of the Annenberg School from 2019 to 2023. He became Penn’s 31st Provost on June 1, 2023. Michael X. Delli Carpini, the Oscar H. Gandy Emeritus Professor of Communication and Democracy, has served as the Annenberg School’s interim dean since Provost Jackson began his term as provost. Interim Dean Delli Carpini previously served as the Walter H. Annenberg Dean of the Annenberg School from 2003 to 2018.\n\n“I could not be more pleased to welcome Sarah Banet-Weiser as the next dean of the Annenberg School,” said Provost Jackson. “Her extensive leadership experience brings together the Annenberg School at Penn with the Annenberg School at USC, while encompassing global leadership at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Just two years ago, she founded our landmark Center for Collaborative Communication, which unites the two Annenberg Schools to advance the role of communications in addressing such critical contemporary issues as health care, data privacy, racial equity, and media literacy. I am excited to work with her as she shapes the global landscape of communications in the years ahead. We are also deeply grateful to Michael Delli Carpini for his invaluable service as interim dean since June 1.”\n\nIn making the announcement of Dr. Banet-Weiser’s appointment, President Magill also thanked Vijay Kumar, the Nemirovsky Family Dean of Penn’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, who chaired the Consultative Committee for the Annenberg School dean search, as well as the members of the committee: “I am grateful to Dean Kumar and the consultative committee for their dedication to helping us find the right leader for the Annenberg School for Communication.”\n\nReport of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility 2022-2023 Academic Year\n\nI would like to thank Steven O. Kimbrough, professor of operations, information and decisions in the Wharton School, for his leadership this past year as chair of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility. I also thank all committee members for their participation and thoughtful contributions.\n\nThe committee’s report for 2022-2023 is below.\n\n—Medha Narvekar, Vice President and University Secretary\n\nThe following report for the 2022-2023 academic year was sent to Medha Narvekar, Vice President and University Secretary, from Dr. Kimbrough, chair of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility (CMR), in accordance with the effectiveness of monitoring; review the state of compliance of the apparel licensees and review any alleged violations of the code.\n\nThe Code of Workplace Conduct for the Penn Licensed Product Manufacturers is attached hereto below and published of record.\n\nReport of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility 2022-2023 Academic Year\n\nIt is my pleasure to report on the deliberations of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility during the 2022-2023 academic year.\n\nCode Compliance\n\nAs of June 2023, 130 of 130 licensees were reviewed and found to be in compliance with the code or are actively working on resolution of known violations.\n\nAt the recommendation of the 2021-2022 committee, Penn Business Services sent thank you letters to licensees that indicated laudable achievements or shared details of instances where they were taking an active approach in addressing known violations.\n\nI would like to express my appreciation to all the committee members for their work on the committee.\n\n—Steve Kimbrough, Chair\n\nProfessor OIDD\n\nMembers of the Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility 2022-2023\n\nSteven Kimbrough (Chair), Wharton\n\nMark Stern, Social Policy & Practice\n\nKathleen Hall, Graduate School of Education\n\nJon Shaw, PPSA\n\nLorene Tran, Undergraduate Assembly\n\nFaith Bochert, Undergraduate Assembly\n\nJaydee Edwards, GAPSA\n\nEx Officio members\n\nLizann Boyle Rode, Office of the Secretary\n\nChristopher Bradie, Business Services\n\nSean Burke, Office of the General Counsel\n\nJessie Burns, Provost’s Office\n\nLeah Popowich, Office of the President\n\nOf Record: Code of Workplace Conduct for Penn Licensed Product Manufacturers\n\nI. Introduction\n\nWith a view to stimulating economic growth and development, raising living standards, meeting staffing requirements and overcoming unemployment and underemployment, the University of Pennsylvania has adopted this Code of Workplace Conduct (the Code) to promote full, productive and freely-chosen employment.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania expects its licensees to conduct their business in a manner consistent with this Code, and to follow workplace standards that adhere to this Code. The Code is subject to amendment to reflect any subsequently developed standards by the University.\n\nII. Notice\n\nThis Code shall apply to all trademark licensees of the University of Pennsylvania. Throughout this Code the term “licensee” shall include all persons or entities that have entered a written licensing agreement with the University to manufacture products bearing the name, trademarks and/or images of the University. Additionally, this Code shall apply to all of the licensee’s contractors. Throughout this Code the term “contractor” shall include each contractor, subcontractor, vendor, or manufacturer that is engaged in a manufacturing process that results in a finished product for the consumer. “Manufacturing process” shall include assembly and packaging.\n\nAs a condition of being permitted to produce and/or sell licensed products bearing the name, trademarks and/or images of the University, each licensee must comply with this Code and ensure that its contractors comply with this Code. All licensees and contractors are required to adhere to this Code, however, no licensee or contractor may represent that they have been certified as being in compliance with this Code.\n\nIII. Standards\n\nUniversity licensees and their contractors must operate workplaces that adhere to the following minimum standards and practices:\n\nA. Legal Compliance\n\nUniversity licensees and their contractors must comply, at a minimum, with all applicable legal requirements of the country in which products are manufactured. Where this Code and the applicable laws of the country of manufacture conflict or differ, the higher standard shall prevail. Such compliance shall include compliance with all applicable environmental laws.\n\nB. Ethical Principles\n\nLicensees shall commit to conducting their business according to a set of ethical standards that include, but are not limited to, honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and respect for the unique intrinsic value of each human being.\n\nC. Environmental Compliance\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors will be committed to the protection of the local environment, including their factories and their surroundings. They will protect residential areas around their factories, disposing of garbage and waste in such a way so as not to endanger the safety and health of nearby areas.\n\nD. Employment Standards\n\n1. Wages and Benefits\n\nLicensees and their contractors must provide wages and benefits which comply with all applicable laws and regulations and which match or exceed the local prevailing wages and benefits in the relevant industry, whichever provides greater wages and benefits. The University is strongly committed to the employees of licensees receiving a “living wage.\"\n\n2. Hours of Work\n\na. Except in extraordinary circumstances, or as required by business necessity, employees shall not be required to work (regardless of location) more than the lesser of:\n\ni. forty eight (48) hours per week and twelve (12) hours of overtime; or\n\nii. the limits on the regular and overtime hours allowed by the law of the country\n\niii. In addition to their compensation for regular hours of work, employees shall be compensated for overtime hours at such a premium rate as is legally required in that country, but not less than at a rate equal to their regular hourly compensation rate.\n\nb. Employees shall be entitled to at least one day off in every seven (7) day period.\n\n3. Homework\n\nThe employer must ensure that work not done at the place of manufacture is performed in a manner safe for the employee and any persons who may be in the surrounding vicinity.\n\n4. Child Labor\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors shall not employ any person younger than 15 (or 14 where the law of the country of manufacture allows) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education in the country of manufacture where such age is higher than 15. Young workers will not be forced to work overtime hours that would prevent them from attending school. Licensees agree to work with governmental, human rights and non-governmental organizations as determined by the University and licensee to minimize the negative impact on any child released from employment as a result of enforcement of this code.\n\n5. Forced Labor\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors shall not use any forced labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise.\n\n6. Harassment or Abuse\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors shall treat every employee with respect and dignity. Licensees and their subcontractors will not subject any employee to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse.\n\n7. Nondiscrimination\n\nLicensees and their subcontractors will not subject any person to any discrimination in employment, including hiring, salary, benefits, advancement, discipline, termination or retirement, on the basis of gender, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marital status, nationality, political opinion or political affiliation, union involvement, or social or ethnic origin. Because, historically, the overwhelming majority of workers in light industry are women, assuring and safeguarding women’s rights is of particular importance for all parties.\n\na. Women workers will receive equal remuneration for comparable work, including benefits, equal treatment, equal evaluation of the quality of their work, and equal opportunity to fill all positions as male workers.\n\nb. Pregnancy tests will not be a condition of employment, nor will they be demanded of employees. Workers will not be forced or pressured to use contraception.\n\nc. Women who take maternity leave will not, because of the maternity leave, face dismissal or threat of dismissal, loss of seniority or reduction of wages. Licensees must permit women returning from maternity leave to return to their prior position or comparable position at least at their prior wage rate and benefits. Local laws and regulations, or the prevailing practice in the relevant industry, whichever is greater, shall determine appropriate length of maternity leave.\n\nd. Licensees and their subcontractors shall provide, to the extent required by applicable law and regulations, or the local prevailing practice in the relevant industry, whichever is greater, services and accommodations to pregnant women, including but not limited to access to legally required healthcare provided by the employer, government or other provider.\n\n8. Health and Safety\n\nLicensees and their contractors must provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment free from recognized hazards and must, at a minimum, comply with local and national health and safety laws. If residential facilities are provided to workers, they must be safe and healthy facilities. Workers will not be exposed to conditions that may endanger their reproductive health without their informed consent.\n\n9. Freedom of Association\n\nLicensees and their contractors shall recognize freedom of association and collective bargaining with bargaining representatives of their own choice. No employee shall be subject to harassment, intimidation or retaliation as a result of his or her efforts to freely associate or bargain collectively.\n\nIV. Compliance\n\nPrior to the date of annual renewal of a license agreement, the licensee shall be required to provide the following to the University, as set forth in the license agreement.\n\nA. The Company names, owners and/or officers, and addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and the nature of the business association of all the licensees’ contractors and manufacturing plants which are involved in the manufacturing process of items which bear, or will bear, the name, trademarks and/or images of the University;\n\nB. Written assurances that it and its contractors adhere to this Code (except that in the initial phase-in period, licensee must provide such written assurances within six months of receipt of this Code); and\n\nC. A summary of the steps taken, and/or difficulties encountered, during the preceding year in implementing and enforcing this Code at each site.\n\nLicensees and/or their contractors are responsible for conducting regular inspections of each facility at which University products are manufactured to ensure workplaces are free from recognized hazards as established in consensus standards as well as hazards as defined by local law.\n\nV. Remediation\n\nIf the University determines that any licensee or contractor has failed to remedy a violation of this Code, the University reserves the right to terminate its relationship with any licensee in accordance with the terms set forth in the licensee agreement.\n\nVI. Public Disclosure\n\nA. The company names, owners, and/or officers, addresses, and nature of the business association, including the steps performed in the manufacturing process, of all the licensees’ contractors and manufacturing plants which are involved in the manufacturing process of items which bear, or will bear, the name, trademarks and/or images of the University shall be made public information.\n\nB. The Licensee shall be required to supply each year a list of all factory locations referred to in paragraph A above, and all locations Licensee anticipates will be used during the term of the License. Any additions or deletions to this list shall be reported to the University within two months of the effective date of such addition or deletion.\n\nVII. Monitoring and Oversight\n\nThe President will establish a Committee on Manufacturer Responsibility (“the Committee”) on the implementation of the University’s Code of Conduct.\n\nA. Composition and Selection\n\n1. Voting Members\n\na. Three members of the University faculty selected by the President in consultation with the Chair of the Faculty Senate, one of whom will chair the Committee.\n\nb. Four members of the student body, including two representatives chosen by the Civic House, and one undergraduate and one graduate student, to be chosen by the Undergraduate Assembly (UA) and the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA), respectively.\n\nc.

Member of the Office of the General Counsel\n\ne. Representative of the Office of the University Secretary\n\nAn administrative staff person and a work-study intern will staff the Committee. The intern will be appointed by the Committee, and paid by the President’s Office. The administrative staff person will be appointed by the President’s Office.\n\nThe division of responsibilities will be as follows:\n\n1. Staff Person\n\nThe administrative staff person will act as a liaison between the Committee and the Office of the President to ensure timely implementation of all decisions of the Committee. The staff person will also send out notices for committee meetings to ensure maximum participation, and work closely with the intern to coordinate all committee-related administrative tasks.\n\n2. Intern\n\nThe intern will to the best of his/her abilities research the University’s licensees in order to recognize violations of the Code. This responsibility will include the compilation of a list of licensees and the maintenance of any relevant records necessary to enforce the Code, including information received from monitoring organizations about licensees for consideration by the Committee. The intern will also actively work on developing mechanisms with other campuses who have signed Codes of Conduct to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Codes.\n\nB. Decision-Making\n\nA simple majority of the Committee (not including ex-officio members) must be present either by telephone or in person for a vote to take place. Only members who are present may vote, and decisions will pass by majority of members present and voting.\n\nC. Meeting Schedule\n\nThe Committee will meet no fewer than once each semester, with additional meetings to be scheduled as necessary in the determination of the Committee chair, in the chair’s discretion.\n\nD. Responsibilities\n\n1. Reviewing the Code of Conduct\n\nThe Committee will review the Code annually to evaluate its effectiveness.

Reviewing Violations\n\nThe Committee will review any alleged violations of the University’s Code of Conduct including consulting with monitoring organizations, such as the Fair Labor Association (FLA), and the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC), and determine whether they constitute violations. Based on this judgment, the Committee will recommend an appropriate course of action to the Trademark Licensing Unit. At the same time, should Trademark Licensing Unit identify any alleged violations, the department will consult with the Committee on an appropriate course of action.\n\nE. Public Accountability\n\n1. The University’s Code of Conduct will be published annually, and amendments as necessary in Almanac.\n\n2. The Trademark Licensing Unit will make available to any interested persons information regarding licensees’ working conditions, monitoring reports, and other relevant materials.\n\n3. The Committee will work with other schools and interested organizations to improve responsible business practices in the manufacture of licensed University products.\n\nF. Seeking and Rewarding Responsible Business Practices\n\n1. The Committee will work with the Trademark Licensing Unit to seek out manufacturers that have instituted proactive measures to insure the responsible production of goods and give them preference by encouraging the University to consider doing business with them, taking into consideration competitive price, quality, and style.\n\n2. Through the efforts of the Committee in seeking out manufacturers with demonstrated responsible business practices, the University commits itself to giving preference to those with responsible monitoring policies, particularly manufacturers that agree to sign disclosure agreements with the University, taking into account competitive price, quality, and style. Representatives of departments responsible for purchasing University products will keep in regular contact with the Committee.\n\nGiving and Volunteer Opportunities from the Netter Center for Community Partnerships\n\nDear Penn Community,\n\nThank you for your spirit of volunteerism.
