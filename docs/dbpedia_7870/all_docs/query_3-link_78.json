        "text": "Recording a new studio album usually brings old friends together. But in fact, these two haven’t even been much apart, them being crooked vultures and all. That’s right, we’re talking rock music gurus Josh Homme and Dave Grohl. On a late autumn night, back at the glorious Pink Duck Studios in Burbank, where …Like Clockwork was being recorded, the two guitar heroes took the shine off a great myth: both were starving – wow, rock stars really ARE human. Next thing you know we’ll probably find out they’re pissing and pooping. Confirmation awaited.\n\nAnyway, Dave and Josh decided it was time for a juicy steak with a smokey flavour. A two-hour drive separated them from Pappy and Harriet’s. Naturally, they decided to pick a much closer bbq place – Josh’s Studio City favourite, Uncle Andre’s.\n\nAs they picked a table, bystanding fans could tell Dave wasn’t in his usual “celebrate meee!” mood. He probably only had four fresh pots!!! of delicious coffee instead of five, which is the usual intake of fresh pots!!! needed for his system to function.\n\nJosh, on the other hand, was annoyingly cheerful. This old song by Will Smith, Getting Jiggy With It, was on the radio. The Ginger Elvis was bouncing in his chair to the rhythm.\n\n– Na-na-na-na-n’-na-nah, na-na-na-na-n’-nah, gettin’ jiggy with it! hummed Homme in his radiant manner, under the grumpy, almost murderous look on the face of his drummer friend, who pierced the song vociferating.\n\n– Joshua Michael Homme the third! Stop it! You’re too jiggly to get jiggy with it anyway!\n\nIt was the day Josh’s meals tragically transformed. Since then to this very day, he prefers salads. Bottom line is: every celebrity diva should worry about her weight. Before. It’s Too. Late!"
