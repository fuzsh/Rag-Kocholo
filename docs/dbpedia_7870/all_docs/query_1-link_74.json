        "text": "1. Christiane Kubrick\n\nRemembering Stanley, 1999\n\nChristiane Kubrick’s vibrant colourful paintings appear in the sets of Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut. This intimate and contemplative portrait depicts her husband of 40 years sitting quietly in their garden in Childwickbury, Hertfordshire.\n\n2. Mat Collishaw\n\nA Ω, 2016\n\nA primate’s face overlays a human skull encased in a space helmet. Collishaw’s allusion to Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey juxtaposes ape and astronaut to suggest a kind of reverse archaeology – the ancient past discovering the distant future.\n\n3. STUART HAYGARTH\n\nPYRE, 2016\n\nHaygarth’s glowing tower of electric fires refers to a scene in The Shining which Kubrick shot twice, once for Jack Nicholson’s take, and once to capture the roaring fireplace. Kubrick’s frequent use of fire as a motif in The Shining was echoed ironically in the coincidental accidental burning down of the film’s set during production in 1979.\n\n4. Iain Forsyth & Jane Pollard\n\nRequiem for 114 radios, 2016\n\nIndividual voices are broadcast to each set in a collection of 114 analogue radio sets. As the voices from some radios join together in harmony, others find the space between clear and broken reception. Collectively these unseen singers perform a new version of Dies Irae from the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, used by Kubrick in the soundtrack of The Shining and A Clockwork Orange. The number 114 refers to Kubrick’s fictional CRM 114 Discriminator device from Dr. Strangelove and coded references in A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Eyes Wide Shut.\n\n5. Marc Quinn\n\nHistory Painting (London, 8 August 2011), 2011 History Painting (Kiev, 22 Jan 2014), 2014\n\nThese images of social unrest are drawn from media reportage. Consonant with Kubrick, Quinn’s dramatic and contrasting use of colour in his depiction of violence serves to heighten a sense of unease in the viewer.\n\n6. Dexter Navy\n\nLliffe, 2016\n\nDexter Navy’s Lliffe is an uncensored representation of 21st century youth culture. His film is much inspired by Kubrick’s intricate use of colour to convey emotion.\n\n7. James Lavelle & John Isaacs, featuring Azzi GlasserIn\n\nConsolus – Full of Hope and Full of Fear, 2016\n\nWall illustration by Giovanni Estevez\n\nThis outwardly playful multimedia, olfactory environment, belies sinister undertones. Loss of innocence and abuse of power find expression through the over-scaled teddy bears, and the banal food produce boxes reference the pantry scene in The Shining. Perfume designer Azzi Glasser’s scent ‘A Space Odyssey’ evokes Kubrick’s film whilst also alluding to his optioning of Patrick Suskind’s classic novel Perfume.\n\nSoundtrack -\n\nA collaboration with Detroit techno pioneer Carl Craig, and Domenico “GG” Canu and Marco Baroni of Italian electronic dance ensemble Planet Funk, also featuring spoken word artist and designer Michele Lamy, and UNKLE collaborator Elliott Power. The piece was based on a conversation between two HALs from the original unreleased 2001: A Space Odyssey script.\n\n8. TOBY DYE\n\nThe Corridor, 2016 Duration: Infinite\n\nDye pays homage to Kubrick in this installation, applying his pioneering camera and narrative techniques. Each of the four endlessly looping films are set in the same location but feature a different character inspired by Kubrick’s filmography.\n\nSoundtrack -\n\nUNKLE’s Lonely Soul ft Richard Ashcroft accompanies Toby Dye’s moving picture. This was the original piece of music that James sent to Stanley Kubrick for the music video that never was. The track features on UNKLE’s critically acclaimed debut album Psyence Fiction.\n\n9. Adam Broomberg & Oliver Chanarin\n\nThe Shining Carpet (WT), 2016\n\nBroomberg and Chanarin’s installation translates the famous carpet design from the Overlook Hotel, the fictional location of The Shining, to the exhibition space. Crossing the boundaries of fiction and reality, this act recalls the ambiguous narrative of Kubrick’s horror masterpiece.\n\n10. Doug Aitken\n\nTwilight, 2014\n\nAitken’s sculpture recalls the public pay phone used, futilely, to avert nuclear catastrophe in Dr. Strangelove. Bathed in a luminous glow, this familiar object takes on a foreign nature, appearing as a relic from a bygone civilization suspended in time.\n\n11. Julian Rosefeldt\n\nSuprematism/Manifesto, 2015\n\nIn this film Cate Blanchett plays a factory girl reciting the Suprematist Manifesto in a Futuristic building. This is one of her 13 different roles performing provocative artists’ writings, originally shown on individual screens. It includes a scene with a mysterious black slab floating in mid air reminiscent of the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\n12. Jonas Burgert\n\nSUPREMATISM/MANIFESTO, 2015\n\nBurgert’s oil painting depicts a young girl holding a coloured balloon. This reference to childhood innocence surrounded by dark and sinister imagery alludes to the duality of human nature which Kubrick explored frequently in his films.\n\n13. Rachel Howard\n\nDarkness and Light, 2014–15\n\nHoward’s evocative painting is inspired by the sinister, symbolic imagery in Kubrick’s The Shining. From this seemingly abstract painting a ghostly creature emerges, as if to suggest that something dark and malicious is waiting to happen. Its title echoes his well known quote ‘However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light’.\n\n14. Michael NymaN\n\nA Phoney War, 2016\n\nNyman’s video deconstructs Kubrick’s narrative process in Dr. Strangelove and echoes his own memory of the terror he felt on first seeing the film. Its comedic phone calls are re-cut to induce fear and anxiety as characters appear to vibrate hypnotically. For the soundtrack he combines extracts from the film with his 1976 piano piece 1–100.\n\n15. Seamus Farrell\n\nTempest in (a) glass\\ a diaphanous arrangement, 2016\n\nInspired by the assemblages of Joseph Cornell and the still life paintings of Giorgio Morandi, Farrell describes his installation as ‘a swim in the Kubrick aquarium’. It features a ‘personal/domestic museum’ and diverse glass objects that are engraved with the titles of Kubrick’s films, addressing the ambiguity between art & craft.\n\n16. Mat Chivers\n\nEye, 2016\n\nThe form of Chivers’ marble sculpture derives from a digital manipulation of a ten second sequence from Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey: the moment when the camera focuses on the astronaut’s eye as he enters the ‘Stargate’. This data was then translated into stone, the two-tone pattern alluding to Kubrick’s love of chess.\n\n17. Gavin Turk\n\nThe Shining, 2007\n\nThis mirrored maquette of the infamous maze in the grounds of the fictional Overlook Hotel in The Shining creates a visual pun on the title of the film. Turk’s work frequently deals with illusion and the ambiguous relationship between representation and reality. Here the maze serves as a metaphor for being psychologically lost.\n\n18. NATHAN COLEY\n\nThe Grady Twins, 2004-16\n\nInspired by Kubrick’s penchant for symmetry, Coley has taken his title from the twin sisters in The Shining. These two almost identical models of Edinburgh churches evolved from his 2004 project Lamp of Sacrifice, a series of scale models of every ‘Place of Worship’ listed in Edinburgh’s Yellow Pages.\n\n19. Samantha Morton & Douglas Hart\n\nAnywhere Out Of This World, 2016\n\nActress, screenwriter and director, Morton’s semiautobiographical film draws on the experience she had as a child of first watching Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey sitting alone at the back of a vast and nearly empty cinema.\n\n20. Jane and Louise Wilson\n\nUnfolding the Aryan Papers, 2009\n\nFocussing on Kubrick’s unrealised project, Aryan Papers, the Wilsons’ film is as much about a movie that never happened as it is a portrait of Johanna ter Steege, Kubrick’s chosen lead actress. The Wilsons undertook extensive research re-photographing stills in the Stanley Kubrick Archive (UAL).\n\n21. Harland Miller\n\nGravity All Nonsense Now, 2016\n\nBoth an artist and a writer, Miller has based many of his paintings on classic Penguin book covers. With his acute sense of detail for the timeworn covers and fascination for typefaces, he often incorporates his own humorous and ironic phrases. Here he creates a cover for Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange.\n\n22. Jason Shulman\n\nGRAVITY ALL NONSENSE NOW, 2016\n\nThrough ‘durational’ photography, Shulman has condensed the entirety of Kubrick’s sci-fi epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey onto a single sheet of photosensitive paper. The complex accumulation of frames creates an abstract image out of what is ordinarily a linear cinematic experience.\n\n23. Jamie Shovlin\n\nPost, 2016\n\nThrough ‘durational’ photography, Shulman has condensed the entirety of Kubrick’s sci-fi epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey onto a single sheet of photosensitive paper. The complex accumulation of frames creates an abstract image out of what is ordinarily a linear cinematic experience.\n\n24. PINK TWINS\n\nOverlook, 2016\n\nJuha and Vesa Vahviläinen‘s film takes inspiration from both The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. It follows a group of animated creatures who, through collisions, conflict, transformative action, mayhem and chaos, are forced to either evolve or perish.\n\n25. INVADER\n\nWhat You Looking At, 2007\n\nThis portrait of Alex, the ultra-violent protagonist of A Clockwork Orange, is constructed from individually coloured tiles. A character so iconic as to be immediately recognisable.\n\n26. Futura\n\nWHAT YOU LOOKING AT, 2007\n\nLenny McGurr, whose graffiti pseudonym Futura, was inspired by Kubrick’s movie 2001: A Space Odyssey began painting on the New York subway system as a teenager in the early 1970s. His pioneering abstract style continues to draw influence from Kubrick.\n\n27. Warren Du Preez and Nick Thornton Jones\n\nParadise, 2016\n\nDu Preez and Thornton Jones’ sensual and stylish work, often made in collaboration with leading musicians, blurs the boundaries between the worlds of advertising and art. Here, their photography takes inspiration from the intensity and eroticism of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut.\n\n28. RUT BLEES LUXEMBURG\n\nTHE FINAL DUEL, (BARRY LYNDON), PILTON TITHE BARN, SOMERSET, 2016\n\nThis historic barn in Glastonbury, Somerset is the location that was chosen by Kubrick for the fateful duel in Barry Lyndon. The perfectly preserved interior contains something of the artifice of the film set.\n\n29. David Nicholson\n\nPortrait of Jade Vixen, 2016\n\nThe ostensibly erotic quality of Nicholson’s painting resonates with the themes of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Both painting and film feature imagery that suggest a decadent version of bourgeois romance, laced with implicit violence. Nicholson’s work echoes Kubrick’s commentary on a sexual power game that is at once exploitative and punishing.\n\n30. Paul Insect\n\nClockwork Britain, 2012\n\nPaul Insect, most famous for his street art, has been inspired by David Pellam’s Penguin book cover for A Clockwork Orange. This work alludes to the film’s portrayal of violent, disaffected youth. Insect combines bold colours and Union Jack motif with silk screen process to suggest a fusion between 1960s pop art and contemporary street art.\n\n31. Philip Castle\n\nVarious works, 2016\n\nCastle is an airbrush artist best known for designing the iconic poster for Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. In addition, he produced many illustrations, drawings and graphics especially for the film that have never been exhibited before. They reveal a vivid and surreal imagination commensurate with Kubrick’s extraordinary vision.\n\n32. Charlotte Colbert\n\nOdyssey 01, 2013\n\nColbert juxtaposes the character of the astronaut, which here symbolises human kind’s power to surpass its environment, with surroundings suggestive of decay. Photographed to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of Kubrick’s death, the work is an affectionate homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\n33. Polly Morgan\n\nMetanoia, 2016\n\nUsing taxidermy to create her trademark surreal sculptures and tableaux, Morgan draws her inspiration from the explicit and implicit sexual imagery of Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. Cramming a serpent within a triangular frame resonates with the suggestive symbolism of the bulging codpieces worn by Alex and his Droogs.\n\n34. Mark Karasick\n\nSK1928, 2016\n\nThis meditative installation comprises a vast painting with a marble inscription, accompanied by the sound of a vintage Adler typewriter. The haunting image recreates Kubrick’s baby photo painted in encaustic medium onto 220 paper sheets.\n\n35. Koen Vanmechelen\n\nEncounter – C.C.P., 2004\n\nKoen Vanmechelen explores the image of the eye that recurs frequently in Kubrick’s films. Combining the human eye with his own signature chicken motif, Koen invites us to consider the borders of our humanity, the fluidity of our perception and potential for hybrid states of consciousness.\n\n36. Norbert Schoerner\n\nDAS Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums, 2016\n\nA 360° Virtual Reality recreation of a scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey in which the character Dr. Francis Poole runs vertically through the circular centrifugal living area of the Discovery One space craft. The title refers to the 1929 book by Hermann Noordung whose visionary concepts for a space station inspired Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick.\n\n37. Nancy Fouts\n\nPROBLEM DER BEFAHRUNG DES WELTRAUMS, 2016\n\nThis 'breathing' camera, of the exact type used by Kubrick, suggests that his legacy lives on through the powerful films he created. Fouts has also installed a super-size director's chair on the River Terrace, Somerset House.\n\n38. Doug Foster\n\nBeyond the Infinite, 2016\n\nInspired by the famous ‘Stargate’ sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Foster’s installation takes the form of an endless widescreen ‘tunnel’. Rendered with luminous textures borrowed from nature that flow from a central vanishing point, this immersive installation draws in the viewer, aiming to momentarily suspend them in time.\n\nSoundtrack-\n\nA collaboration with composer, cellist and UNKLE collaborator Phillip Shepherd. Phillip is also working with James on the UNKLE Redux show for the Summer Series at Somerset House this July. Phillip has worked with the likes of Björk, Scott Walker and most recently Disney, scoring original music for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\n39. Haroon Mirza and Anish Kapoor\n\nBit Bang Mirror, 2013–2015\n\nThe skilful interplay of dissonant sound and controlled light to create a heightened sense of drama is central to Kubrick’s filmmaking. Mirza’s immersive installation incorporates a concave mirror by Kapoor, and uses the tension between sound and light to illicit both psychological and visual discomfort in the viewer.\n\n40. Paul Fryer\n\nThe Second Law, 2016\n\nThis work makes a direct reference to the iconic final scene in Kubrick’s The Shining. Encased within a glass-fronted upright freezer, Fryer has created a realistic waxwork figure covered in ice and snow. However, instead of depicting the film’s protagonist, Jack Torrance, it bears an eerie resemblance to the director himself.\n\n41. Sarah Lucas\n\nPriapus, 2013\n\nThe concrete penis lying on a crushed car dominates the room and is suggestive of the iconic murder weapon used by Alex, the ultra-violent protagonist of A Clockwork Orange. The industrial nature of Lucas’ sculptural materials reflect the bleak urban landscape of Kubrick’s film.\n\nSoundtrack-\n\nAccompanying Lucas’ sculpture is a collaboration between musician and producer Mick Jones (The Clash and Big Audio Dynamite) and UNKLE. Mick’s signature guitar sound is prominent throughout the composition.\n\n42. CHRIS LEVINE, MR KUBRICK IS LOOKING, 2016\n\nPRIAPUS, 2013\n\nA self-portrait by Kubrick is projected into the viewer’s peripheral vision using LED light technology. This ‘visual echo’ appears and disappears in a moment like a phantom. Levine is fascinated by the ‘sensory energy’ and ‘spiritual dimension’ of light.\n\nSoundtrack -\n\nChris Levine’s installation is accompanied by an original piece of music from Eyes Wide Shut composer Jocelyn Pook. The composition was an unreleased track from the Eyes Wide Shut sessions. A second piece of music comes from acclaimed composer Max Richter, an influential voice in post minimalist composition, and recently released Sleep; the longest continuous piece of recorded classical music in history. A third piece of music comes from long time UNKLE collaborator and critically acclaimed musician Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. A fourth piece of music comes from Mercury Rev, critically acclaimed psychedelic rock group from the States, featuring Simon Raymonde from ethereal dreamscape band Cocteau Twins. All four compositions are interspersed with the voice of actor Brian Cox, as well as an exclusive interview with Christiane Kubrick, recorded at the Kubrick family home in St Albans.\n\n43. Thomas Bangalter\n\nCamera A, Scene 136, Take 1, 2005–2016\n\nMusician and cinematographer Bangalter is best known for being one half of the electronic music duo Daft Punk. Taking his cue from Kubrick, Bangalter’s careful selection of camera equipment, particularly his choice of lenses, together with his use of natural light and an emphasis on the on-point perspective, is central to his work.\n\n44. Peter Kennard\n\nTrident; A Strange Love, 2013–16\n\nKennard’s installation juxtaposes images of characters from Dr. Strangelove with world leaders charged with nuclear arsenals. Using imagery of the film’s famous War Room, he shows that the ghosts of the past still inhabit the present.\n\n45. Joseph Kosuth\n\n(‘A Grammatical Remark’ #9, London), 2016\n\nKosuth chose Somerset House’s historic Nelson staircase to install his work. It aptly comprises a transcript of the confrontation between Jack and Wendy on the stairs in a key scene from The Shining. This work is the ninth installation in a series begun in 1989, which to date has included exhibitions in eight countries."
