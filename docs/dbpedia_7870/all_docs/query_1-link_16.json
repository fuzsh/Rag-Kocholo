        "text": "It’s hard to put a needle on the point exactly where it all went wrong for James Lavelle.\n\nThe DJ turned A&R man was undisputedly one of the hippest kids in 1990s London.\n\nHis club nights – the stuff of dance music legend – led to him launching his uber cool Mo’Wax record label in 1992 which fast established itself at the forefront of the alternative hip hop scene.\n\nTo it, Lavelle was to sign one of the most important records of the decade in DJ Shadow’s groundbreaking trip hop sample album, Endtroducing.\n\nAnd off the back of it he was to launch his own supergroup he fronted, UNKLE.\n\nHe had it all. And anyone who was anyone wanted to be a part of it. At one point this cocky upstart from the Home Counties could pick up the phone and ask a revolving door of collaborators from Radiohead’s Thom Yorke to Beastie Boys’ Mike D to guest on a record – and they would invariably drop everything to do so.\n\nA force of nature from seemingly nowhere, Lavelle was a musical Midas; everything he touched turned to gold.\n\nAnd then, before he knew it, in his own words, everything he touched “turned to sh*t”.\n\nLavelle’s meteoric rise and bumpy fall back to earth – amid his struggles with money, relationships, talent, control and ego – is charted in the new music documentary The Man from Mo’Wax.\n\nThe movie begins by explaining how the exceptionally creatively-gifted geeky 14-year-old Oxfordshire kid with a passion for Star Wars had his mind blown by watching Grandmaster Flash on Top of the Pops. He subsequently asked his mum for his entire year’s worth of pocket money in one lump sum so he could buy turntables.\n\nLavelle was soon wearing oversize T-Shirts with hip hop logos, DJing in pubs and bunking off school to come to London to find new tunes to play before moving to the capital to soak up everything it had to offer a teenage upstart.\n\nAmid his thirst to find new music he built up an encyclopaedic knowledge in his brain which led to him getting his own column in Straight No Chaser magazine and quitting a business course to get a job in a record shop where tastemakers like Pete Tong and Norman Jay were soon turning to him to find their new tunes.\n\nHe was also DJing eclectic club nights all over London – from Bar Rumba in Shaftesbury Avenue to Brixton’s The Fridge. Inspired by his idols, not least Bristol collective Wild Bunch (which spawned Massive Attack), by 18 he launched his own indie label with graffiti-led artwork on sleeves as desirable to collectors as the vinyl they contained inside.\n\nLavelle’s cockiness and “get this done attitude” meant he thought nothing of jumping on a plane to anywhere in the world to sign what he thought should be the next big thing: Money Mark, Blackalicious, Rob Douggan…\n\nLavelle broke conventions, delivered success within the burgeoning trip hop scene and major record labels took note. Attracted by the spending power it would deliver him, he did a deal to place Mo’ Wax within A&M Records and in retrospect the timing couldn’t have been more fortuitous.\n\nHe met Josh Davis, aka DJ Shadow, and before Lavelle knew it, Entroducing came along – a landmark record he had been born to release. Composed almost entirely of samples borrowed from vinyl records, the 1996 release is still considered one of the decade’s greatest albums – and with major label backing Lavelle was able to deliver it the success it deserved.\n\nBut being a force of nature behind the scenes wasn’t apparently enough for Lavelle. He wanted to be as much the star as the artists who recorded for him became – if not bigger. Indeed, he craved the recognition and adulation, and so with Davis he formed UNKLE and the pair set about making one of the most anticipated records in years – because everyone wanted to hear what on earth this could sound like.\n\nHowever, while Lavelle was now an artist – half the act – behind the scenes it soon became clear his skills lay in A&R and not in songwriting, performing or playing any instrument. While he could attract everyone from Richard Ashcroft to Ian Brown to sing on one of their tracks, the film suggests Lavelle would be more likely found partying with Kate Moss or Oasis’ Gallagher brothers than in the back of the recording studio making the record, largely emerging only to promote it.\n\nIt clearly irked Davis who put a firm stamp on himself being the talent when he insisted on being credited as the songwriter instead of jointly 50/50 with Lavelle. Their 1998 debut album Psyence Fiction (which was meant to take three months but took nearer five years to make) was then slated in the music press – most notably the NME, which labelled it as bloated and egotistical – and Davis quit after a Top of the Pops appearance which saw Lavelle hitting notes on a keyboard next to him.\n\nBy now the wheels of steel were well and truly coming off the Mo’ Wax wagon. A&M merged with Island Records and all the Mo’ Wax artists Lavelle had signed (including UNKLE) automatically went with it – essentially leaving him owning nothing he had himself started.\n\nThe film continues painfully, first by showing how Lavelle later tried to resurrect Mo’ Wax under a new deal with XL Records. A slew of signing mistakes and other errors of judgment cost his new backers around £2million with little to show for it.\n\nAnd then it continues uncomfortably, by detailing how Lavelle repeatedly attempted to continue UNKLE without Davis – determined they could still be the biggest act in the world – but with each album selling less than its predecessor and getting him further into debt.\n\nMost damning, it soon becomes clear how collaborations with big names like Pulp’s Jarvis Coker, uber producer Brian Eno, QOTSA’s Josh Homme or The Prodigy’s Keith Flint weren’t able to compensate for either Davis’s absence or Lavelle’s own lack of musical talent.\n\nLavelle was forced to reinvent himself as a House music DJ to just pay the bills, but while he was capable of inspiring and electrifying audiences in front of the decks, behind the scenes he was clearly an inwardly very sad, desperately lonely person – a five-year weekend residency at London’s Fabric particularly taking its toll.\n\nInevitably his personal relationships took a pounding. Eventually there’s a point about two-thirds into the film where you get this sinking feeling this isn’t going to end well, because it simply can’t.\n\nWallowing in debt, everything he owns in storage, relationship break-ups, talk of problems with drink and drugs, unresolved lawsuits, old friends at best no longer friends, nobody famous returning his phone calls, nobody wanting to help him finish a record let alone help him put one out…\n\nIn The Man from Mo’ Wax, Lavelle is portrayed as a washed-up rock bore who has plummeted into a hole and has no way of getting out – largely because of his failure to face up to the real reasons which led to his downfall and acknowledge his time was ‘in the moment’.\n\nYet it’s fascinating viewing for anyone who wants to try to figure out how someone who ‘had it all’ could have let it all go so horribly wrong.\n\nSomething does – and did – eventually come right for Lavelle though, when he is asked to curate the 2014 edition of the Meltdown Festival on London’s South Bank – following in the footsteps of David Bowie, Patti Smith and John Peel.\n\nIt was the fastest selling Meltdown in history and while, much to his chagrin, he failed to get his idols Massive Attack to appear, Lavelle did achieve the apparently impossible in getting Davis back on stage to perform with him in a very special guest appearance as DJ Shadow with UNKLE.\n\nHowever, it’s doubtful that will ever be enough of denouement for someone like Lavelle who is probably already planning the next chapter."
