        "text": "On a recent night in Williamsburg, an ecstatic crowd jammed the dance floor of the club Brooklyn Bowl to see one of the world’s greatest living blues guitarists. He doesn’t hail from the Mississippi Delta or Chicago’s South Side, but from the dusty outpost of Agadez, Niger, in the Sahara. Oumara Moctar, better known as Bombino, is already a star among the Tuareg — the nomadic Berbers who traverse the countries along the desert — and as he releases his sixth album, “Deran,” he’s on the verge of becoming one internationally.\n\nNorth African desert blues (or tichumaren in Tamasheq, the Tuareg language), has become arguably the most successful world music genre to break through since reggae, and few have wielded the guitar with such mastery and majesty as Bombino. His spellbinding virtuosity and urgently dynamic live shows have made fans of fellow musicians from Keith Richards and Robert Plant to Josh Homme and Win Butler, and built him a following that’s crossed over from the world music community to the jam-band circuit.\n\n“My objective is to get people moving,” he said in French through his manager, Eric Herman, who also serves as a translator, a few days before the concert, at his record label’s nearby offices in Brooklyn. “It’s really context dependent, whether I feel the pull to play on the softer romantic side or the high energy side, but I want to make people move.”\n\nAfter making his previous three albums primarily in Boston, Nashville and Woodstock with producers including the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach and Dirty Projectors’ David Longstreth, Bombino recorded in Africa for the first time in nearly a decade, since the field recordings that introduced him to world music audiences on the 2009 compilation “Guitars From Agadez Vol. 2.”\n\nRecorded in Casablanca at a studio owned by the king of Morocco, “Deran” was produced by Mr. Herman, and presents what Bombino considers to be his true voice, without being filtered through the sheen of a famous producer. “Deran” displays the breadth of Bombino’s stylistic approaches: the electrifying “Imajghane” is a rollicking blues-rock anthem, while “Midiwan” sounds like an acoustic desert campfire singalong and “Tehigren” features a lilting bounce that the band has called “Tuareggae.”\n\nAt the Brooklyn concert in honor of “Deran,” the guitarist was dressed in a plum-colored knee-length waxed-cotton bazin robe and matching pants. Sporting a white tagelmust — the traditional Tuareg head wrap — worn around his neck as a scarf and dangling precariously close to the tops of his leather loafers, he resembled what “Purple Rain”-era Prince might have looked like if Minneapolis were closer to North Africa than North Dakota. His guitar playing was nearly as incendiary as the Purple One, too: When his backing band leavened their hypnotically funky desert blues with an amiable reggae beat, Bombino kicked up his knees in a high-stepping skank, his spindly fingers a dizzying blur on the strings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
