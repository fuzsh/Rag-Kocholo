He claimed at one point, Josh grabbed his arm, dug his fingernails in his hand and tried to pull him over the barrier, leaving him in fear for his life.\n\nGunner called police but they didn't arrive until the singer had left the mall.\n\nHe also claimed that he thinks Josh broke into the home he shares with Brody and their respective children and even slashed his tyres.\n\nA judge has granted a temporary restraining order that requires Josh to stay at least 50 yards away from Gunner and his two daughters.\n\nLast year, Josh's 15-year-old daughter Camille secured a temporary restraining order against him, while the Distillers singer had also previously applied for temporary restraining orders for their two sons, Orrin, 10, and five-year-old Wolf, claiming they were scared to see him and had been \"abused physically and emotionally\" by their dad but the request was denied.\n\nAnd in December, Brody was fined $1,000 and sentenced to 60 hours of community service for contempt of court after being convicted for \"willfully\" refusing to hand Wolf over to Josh as agreed.\n\nShe was acquitted over the same offence in relation to Orrin, while Camille was not included in the charges."
