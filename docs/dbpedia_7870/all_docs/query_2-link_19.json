        "text": "Rock band Queens of the Stone Age is canceling its upcoming tour dates as frontman Josh Homme needs emergency surgery.\n\n“QOTSA regret to announce that Josh Homme must return to the United States immediately for emergency surgery,” a statement said. “Every effort was made to push through and play for you, but it is no longer an option to continue.”\n\nDetails of Homme’s health issues were not specified.\n\nThe band said it had to pull out of eight performances in Europe, including festivals and concerts in France, Denmark, Austria and Greece. Ticketholders for shows Queens of the Stone Age were scheduled to headline will be contacted directly about possible refunds, the band said.\n\n“Queens are gutted we aren’t able to play for you,” the group added. “We apologize for any inconvenience and share in your frustration and disappointment.”\n\nQueens of the Stone Age are next scheduled to perform Aug. 24 in Sweden. The band is promoting its 2023 album, “In Times New Roman,” their first release since 2017′s “Villains.”\n\nHomme, 51, is a singer, guitarist and drummer best known for his work with Queens of the Stone Age. He has also performed with Eagles of Death Metal, Screaming Trees, Kyuss, Them Crooked Vultures (with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones), Arctic Monkeys, Sound City Players, U.N.K.L.E. and Iggy Pop.\n\nHomme reportedly told fans last year he was diagnosed with cancer in 2022, but said it was successfully removed with an operation. He did not elaborate on what kind of cancer or any related health issues.\n\n“I’m extremely thankful that I’ll get through this, and I’ll look back at this as something that’s f---ed up — but will have made me better. I’m cool with that,” he told Revolver in 2023. “There’s a lot of stuff I want to do. And there’s a lot of people I want to do that with.”\n\nQueens of the Stone Age is a Grammy-nominated alternative rock band founded by Homme in 1996. The group, which has released eight albums, has featured different lineups over the years with Homme as the sole constant member.\n\nClassic rock band postpones tour, including Upstate NY concerts, due to health\n\n‘90s rock band reuniting for first time in 25 years: See tour dates"
