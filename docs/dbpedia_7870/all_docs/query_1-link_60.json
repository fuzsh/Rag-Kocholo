        "text": "\"Taylor Hawkins was the most passionate musician I have ever know, he lived and breathed music from the moment he woke up until he fell asleep. He made me a better musician and had an energy that drew out the best in everybody. He never settled for anything less than great. Although he was known for his otherworldly drumming, most people didn’t realize what a prolific and accomplished songwriter he was. In our 27 years as friends and musical collaborators I cherish all of our experiences and look back with only the greatest memories. He was also one of the most quick witted and funniest people, never holding back a hilarious comeback or jab if given the opportunity. He had an encyclopedia-like mind for music in all genres and pushed everyone to the limit of their musicality. He was a once in a lifetime friend and I’m hurting everyday over his passing. I love the Hawk more than words can ever convey.\"\n\n​\n\nChris Chaney has been a touring and session bassist for over three decades. His first major gig was playing with Alanis Morissette on her Jagged Little Pill tour in 1995. He then went on to become a member of Jane’s Addiction in 2002. In addition to his band and tour work he has played on countless records, with everyone from Joe Cocker, Elton John, Miley Cyrus, Joe Satriani, Slash, Glen Campbell, Sara Bareilles, Shakira, Avril Lavigne, Regina Spector, Beth Hart, The Pretenders, John Fogerty and many others. Film scores include, The Hangover, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Get Him To The Greek, 300, Fifty Shades of Grey, Spy, Horrible Bosses, The Greatest Showman and many more. He first met Taylor Hawkins in 1995, and was a collaborator and group member in Taylor Hawkins & The Coattail Riders. They recorded several records and had a strong bond as a rhythm section that would last 27 years. His latest project was NHC with Taylor and Dave Navarro.\n\n\"Over the past 17 years I’ve been lucky enough to be Taylor Hawkins’ record producer, recording engineer, co-songwriter, drummer, tour manager, and friend.\n\nI started working for Foo Fighters as an assistant engineer in 2006, and Taylor and I were instant friends. In 2009 Taylor asked me to record his next Coattail Riders album (Red Light Fever), and from there, he and I continued to make all of his solo music up until March of 2022.\n\nStarting around 2010, Taylor asked me to tour manage his cover band “Chevy Metal.” I can honestly say that Chevy Metal weekend trips were some of the best times of my life. We would fly all over the world to play gigs, (Hawaii, Chili, Milwaukee!!, to name a few). We would travel with just the band, myself, and sometimes Tim-Fly. We would play on rental gear, that we would all set up ourselves, and we would “eat at Denny’s and stay at motel-6’s” as Taylor would often say. He loved it.\n\nOne day we were driving to do a Chevy Metal show in San Diego at an amphitheater, and Taylor said to me “can you play “you really got me”, and “ziggy stardust” today? I want to go up front and\n\nsing.” I had played drums in a lot of bars, clubs, and studios, but I had never played at an amphitheater or festival in front of a lot of people like that. I ended up playing drums and singing at almost every Chevy Metal show from that day forward. We played in a few different countries, and in front of some really large audiences. I’d always wondered what that feeling was like to perform to big crowds, and my friend Taylor was the guy who handed me that opportunity. I am forever grateful for that.\n\n…and just look at Chevy Metal now, here we are playing Wembley Stadium and The Forum, and it’s all because Taylor Hawkins brought a couple of his buddies along for the ride. That’s just the way Taylor was. Love and miss you every single day, dude….\"\n\n\"I’d known Taylor since I moved to Orange County in 1990. I used to see him at the local guitar store. I was shocked when one day Def Leppard was performing on Top Of The Pops, a British music television show, and I heard a voice yelling, “Phil!”. It was Taylor. I asked him, “What are you doing here?!\" and he said, “I’m playing drums with Alanis Morissette!” From that moment on he just kept moving onwards and upwards. Later it was the Foo Fighters and we’d still see each other. I’d see Taylor boogie boarding at Laguna Beach, at rehearsals or at event shows or wherever. We’d just always bump into each other but no matter where we were Taylor was always his same wonderful, humble self - that guy I first met who worked in the local music store that preceded Guitar Center in Laguna Hills. He was a lovely guy with a monster talent and not just for drums but for everything, singing included. He was also the ultimate fan.\n\nAs Taylor’s superstardom grew his ego didn’t. That’s what was so amazing about him. He was able to channel all of that energy of his favorite artists, songwriters, singers, and drummers into his own personal vibe which is such a rare thing. It was what was so great about him. I’d seen and spoken to Taylor just before they went out on tour. I’d gone down to their rehearsal to hang with the guys. For me it’s a shock and terrible thing that he’s just not here anymore so I’m still reeling from all of this.\n\nI will gladly honor everything that was Taylor at the LA Forum show.\n\nTaylor gave SO much so THIS ONE’S FOR YOU.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\ndefleppard.com\n\n\"Taylor and I first met in 1981. He was 9 and I was 10. His family had recently moved into my neighborhood in Laguna Beach. We were immediately best friends.\n\n​\n\nLike it was yesterday, I have this vivid memory of Taylor calling me and expressing such excitement at discovering the album, The Game by Queen. From that moment on, he became completely enamored with Roger Taylor, who was not just a drummer, but a songwriter and a singer. He convinced his parents to buy him a drum set and from there, he never looked back. Drumming became everything to Taylor.\n\n​\n\nSide by side we learned our instruments and honed our craft. All through school we had cover bands and played anywhere we could.\n\n​\n\nWe came of age and experienced together all the rites of passage of teenagers and aspiring musicians.\n\n​\n\nTaylor took a sincere interest in my development as a lead singer and was instrumental in helping me land the gig of lead vocalist for Yes. I’ve been in Yes now for 10 amazing years and I owe it all to my faithful friend.\n\n​\n\nTaylor has always been and will forever continue to be such a personal and close part of my life. Nearly every significant memory I have includes him in some way.\n\nUp until the time he passed away, we were talking at least once a week. I think we each found solace in the fact that we were both going through a lot of the same musical and lifestyle experiences, yet also had a unique and long term connection to an earlier, simpler time as childhood best friends. We always ended our often lengthy phone conversations by telling one another, “I love you”. In fact, “I love you” were the last words Taylor ever spoke to me.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nJon Davison, is Lead singer and songwriter of progressive rock band ‘YES’. Davison joined YES in 2012, and is also known as the former lead singer of progressive rock band GLASS HAMMER (2009 to 2014), and the former bass guitarist and multi-instrumentalist of SKY CRIES MARY (1993 to 2016), in which he was credited under his nickname of \"Juano\" Davison.\n\n​\n\nDavison's earliest involvement with music began when he sang in the church youth choir led by his mother. Soon after he took up guitar and bass, which eventually led him, during High School, to perform in various bands with his childhood best friend, Taylor Hawkins (the drummer for FOO FIGHTERS). It was Hawkins who gave Jon the nickname \"Juano\" that has stuck to this day. During this time, Davison and Hawkins discovered progressive rock, and in particular for Davison, his future band ‘YES’.\n\n​\n\nIn February 2012, Davison was announced as the new lead singer of YES, replacing Benôit David who left the group because of illness. YES were due to leave for a tour of Australia, and a race was on to find the perfect replacement. Chris Squire, the bassist for YES, is quoted as saying that Jon's name came up when they first started working with Benoit as his friend, Taylor Hawkins, had told him 'If you ever need a replacement (singer), I know exactly the guy'. At the same time the manager for YES had also heard Davison’s work with GLASS HAMMER, and appealed to Steve Howe and the other members that he should be approached.\n\n​\n\nIn 2014 ‘Heaven and Earth’ was released, and Davison wrote or co-wrote seven out of the eight tracks, cementing his role within the band. Numerous tours and live albums followed, including their headline appearance on six ‘Cruise to the Edge’ festivals at sea.\n\n​\n\nIn the Summer of 2019 YES went out on tour as the headline act on THE ROYAL AFFAIR. The four-hour epic progressive rock festival also included CARL PALMER, ARTHUR BROWN, ASIA, and JOHN LODGE OF THE MOODY BLUES, and toured across the United States to the delight of fans.\n\nSummer of 2020 saw the release of the Steve Howe album ‘Love Is’, Davison performed bass guitar and background vocals on the album.\n\n​\n\nIn December 2020, ‘Arc of Life’ was released. This album was a progressive rock ‘supergroup’ comprising Davison on vocals and guitar, Billy Sherwood on Bass and shared lead vocals, Jay Schellen on Drums, Dave Kerzner on Keyboards and Jimmy Haun on Lead Guitar.\n\n​\n\nIn October 2021, YES released their new album ‘The Quest’. The first single, ‘The Ice Bridge’ was released on July 23rd, and was co-written by Davison and Geoff Downes. Davison wrote or co-wrote six of the tracks on the album.\n\nAs touring restarted after the pandemic, March 2022 saw Davison join John Lodge of The Moody Blues on a tour of the USA, and on the Flower Power Cruise. Then in the Summer of 2022, YES undertook their 2020 postponed tour of the United Kingdom, and then a sold-out tour in Japan. They are currently rehearsing for a 30 date USA tour due to start on October 7th in Glenside, PA, and travelling across the entire States. 2023 will see the release of a new YES studio album, and further tours in Europe, the UK and USA.\n\n​\n\nyesworld.com\n\n“Taylor and I were acquaintances for a while but really became better friends in the past 6 or 7 years. We just had so much in common….it’s a miracle we weren’t closer sooner. We were basically the same age, both from Orange County, both hyper drummers, both songwriters and really grew up loving the same stuff. In recent years he’d FaceTime me out of the blue. We’d sit there talking and an hour would just blow by! Sometimes it was shorter, sometimes longer but eventually one of us would have to run. We’d geek out over Alex Van Halen and Stewart Copeland (total fan boys) but then switch up and share our experiences with having kids….being Dad’s and trying to balance family and our careers. Of course with all of this, a lot of laughing. Always lots of laughing. His humor, enthusiasm, and obvious zest for music and life was infectious. I always answered the phone if I saw him calling. I knew it would put me in a better mood…no matter HOW I was feeling at that moment. I hate that he’s gone. I really fucking do.”\n\n​\n\n​\n\nJosh Freese is a drummer and songwriter from Southern California. He’s appeared on over 400 records and is known for working with a wide variety of bands and artists for over 3 decades. He’s spent most of his career recording and touring with A Perfect Circle, Devo, Nine Inch Nails, Sting, Weezer, Danny Elfman, The Offspring and The Vandals. In addition he’s recorded with artists ranging from Guns n Roses to Michael Buble. Suicidal Tendencies to Bruce Springsteen. Miley Cyrus to 100 Gecs, Chris Cornell, Evanescence, Ween, Katy Perry, Glen Campbell, Sublime, Avril Lavigne, The Replacements and many others. Josh joined the musicians union when he was 12 and after working in a cover band at Disneyland for 3 years, started making records and touring at the age of 15.\n\n\"When I met Taylor, it kinda felt like I had known him forever. He is so easy to talk to, open, and inquisitive. Taylor was able to inhabit both worlds as a HUGE exuberant music fan, who didn’t look down on any genre of music and yet a superstar both behind the drum kit or stepping out and singing lead.\n\nI have very special memories of a tour we did w the Foo’s in South America in 2012. On a day off, Taylor, myself, Kenny Laguna and some band and crew took a boat into the jungle. Taylor and I decided we were forming a supergroup and started writing music. We played guitar and dropped anchor at a beautiful spot and had dinner. We never got around to doing our supergroup because you always think you'll have time. I will never forget that day, that tour and all the other times after. Or Taylor. 🖤\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nJoan Jett grew up during a time when rock ‘n’ roll was off limits to girls and women, but as a teenager, she promptly blew the door to the boys’ club right off its hinges. After forming her band the Blackhearts in 1979, with whom Jett has become a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, she has had eight platinum and gold albums and nine Top 40 singles, including the classics \"Bad Reputation,\" \"I Love Rock 'N' Roll,\" \"I Hate Myself For Loving You,\" and \"Crimson and Clover.\" With a career that has spanned music, film, television, Broadway, and humanitarianism, Joan Jett remains a potent force and inspiration to generations of fans worldwide. As a producer, she has overseen seminal albums by Bikini Kill, and the Germs' LA punk masterpiece ‘GI.’ Jett and Kenny Laguna (her longtime producer and music partner) co-founded Blackheart Records from the trunk of Kenny’s Cadillac after rejections from no less than 23 labels. 40 years later, Blackheart is a thriving entertainment company producing music, film and television, and continues to champion emerging bands. Jett, along with the Blackhearts, perform around the globe and have toured alongside fellow rock legends like The Who, Green Day, Heart, and Foo Fighters. Most recently the band completed The Stadium Tour with Def Leppard and Motley Crue in the summer of 2022. The group's newest release, 'Changeup,' is their first-ever acoustic album. These stripped-down recordings are at once intimate while capturing all the ferocity and menace for which Joan and the band are known. 'Bad Reputation,' a documentary about Jett's life, premiered to critical acclaim at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n​\n\njoanjett.com\n\n\"The first time I ever met Taylor the first thing I noticed about him was his playfulness. He took the time to say hello to me backstage at Madison Square Garden before they played. Tik Tok had just come out and I was definitely not comfortable in the role of being backstage talking to my idols. All the boys in the band were so happy. I think he could sense that I was kinda nervous so he made it a point to include me in the conversation. He offered me some of Dave’s homemade moonshine. He was so funny and easy to talk to. I was playing a festival in Rio and we ended up having a late night hangout on the rooftop with my band and dancers till the sun came up. The Foo Fighters was his family, the guys were his brothers. The love and respect between these guys was palpable. He was so fucking funny! His hair was always overly bleached to hell and his skin tanned from years in the California sun. He always looked ready for an outdoor adventure. He was always laughing. My favorite memory of Taylor was in Japan. We ended up at the same underground rock bar in Tokyo the night my album ‘Rainbow’ came out. We had all played a festival in Tokyo together earlier that day and I had watched him drum from the side of the stage. He was a monster on drums. That night I ended up downstairs in one of my favorite bars in the world, with one of my favorite people, celebrating another massive show for him and massive career milestone for me. He always was so humble and made sure to make other people feel special in their victories, to the point that you could almost get over the nerves of talking to one of the best drummers of all time. His spirit lives on in the music, in every song he touched. There is an infinite amount of people he has influenced in his life and he will never be forgotten.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nKesha attracts a diverse, passionate, and socially-engaged global audience who believe in the messages behind her music.

There was such unbridled JOY coursing through his veins coupled with that megawatt grin…I thought he was going to jump right out of his shoes! That was the Taylor I knew. First and foremost, a deeply passionate music lover to his very core. Despite his own obvious monster talents and tremendous success, he never lost that youthful enthusiasm - and I loved and admired him all the more for it.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nGeddy Lee is a Canadian musician and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist, bassist, and keyboardist for the Canadian rock group Rush. Lee joined Rush in September 1968, at the request of his childhood friend and guitarist Alex Lifeson, followed by drummer and lyricist Neil Peart that formed the acclaimed rock trio for over four decades. Inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame in 2013, he has also been made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1996 and received the Governor’s General Performing Arts Award in 2012. In addition to their commercial success, Rush has also been recognized with a number of JUNO Awards and multiple GRAMMY® nominations, including one for the acclaimed documentary Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage and the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award. Lee has also made cameo appearances in the film, I Love You Man and documentary The Mind of the Collector.\n\nAn award-winning musician, Lee’s style, technique, and skill on the bass guitar have inspired many rock musicians. An avid collector of many things, Lee added author to his list of accomplishments when releasing “Geddy’s Big Beautiful Book of Bass” in 2018 that landed on best-seller lists in Canada, UK and USA and was followed by an unprecedented sold-out book tour in 5 countries that was cut short by the pandemic. His memoir is set for release in 2023.\n\n\"I first met Taylor at Nick Raskulinez’s home in Los Angeles in early 2007. We were all invited to watch the Super Bowl and celebrate Nick’s birthday. As is often the case with casual encounters, they can be fleeting but Taylor had that special ability to make you feel like an old friend. He had such an easy smile and his eyes truly sparkled when he spoke about his love of being a musician and the joy of performance. Over the years, our paths would cross and each time it was like connecting with an old, dear friend; the warmth, the smile and the generosity of spirit that marked the man he was. It was my privilege to be his friend.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nWhen Alex Lifeson was growing up in Toronto, Canada, he received a guitar for Christmas and by the summer of 1968 had co-founded the band that would become Rush.\n\n​\n\nIn 1971, Lifeson made his film debut as himself under his birth name, Alex Zivojinovich, in the Canadian documentary film Come on Children by Allan King. King’s film enjoyed a resurgence when decades later an amazing clip was featured in the documentary Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage, that captured Alex having a teenage argument with his parents on the merits of leaving high school to pursue his dream to play guitar in a band as a career.\n\nClearly his dream paid off as he has been the lauded guitar player for Rush for over 45 years. The bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, although he has contributed to a body of work outside of the band as a guitarist and producer including his latest project Envy of None. In addition to music, Lifeson is a painter, a keen golfer, and licensed aircraft pilot. He is also known for his comedic virtues, which have been highlighted in various cameo film roles over the years including one in the Canadian-cult mockumentary series The Trailer Park Boys.\n\nAlong with his bandmates Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, Lifeson was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1996, received the highest Canadian artistic honour by receiving the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award in 2012, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Lifeson ranks third in the Guitar World Readers poll of ‘100 Greatest Guitarists’ and is also included in Rolling Stone’s ‘100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time’.\n\n​\n\nRush.com\n\n“My favourite memory of Taylor is our session for recording ‘Have a Cigar”. Taylor had this vision for a hard- rock version of the Pink Floyd classic, and he and Dave descended on my little studio in the country to make it happen. We set up Mr Grohl’s drum kit in my dining room and my amps in the hallway, with everything wired up to the control room - which is a converted snooker room. We crashed away at deafening volume until we felt we had everything ‘on tape’. Taylor singing, joyfully tearing his throat to bits. Me using multiple preamps to get more gain than I’d ever used, to make the guitar scream. Dave a massive powerhouse - like no other. I had to leave at the end of the evening to go to an astro meeting 100 miles away. When I got back at 5am Taylor was still mixing the track - squeezing every last drop out of it. So I joined him, with a kind of euphoria that comes when you feel you are going some place that nobody’s ever been. I love the track. I forgot to say —- we laughed the whole way through … great times.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nBrian May, CBE, PhD, FRAS is a founding member of Queen, world-renowned guitarist, songwriter, producer and performer, also a Doctor of Astrophysics, 3-D stereoscopic photographic authority and advocate for animal rights.\n\nQueen remains one of the most successful bands to this day with five decades of staggering sales and awards.

Taylor Hawkins called me that morning at my hotel, wanting to know if I could switch songs with him. He was singing the Day I Tried to Live, which he had renamed (in true Taylor form) “The Day I Tried to Sing” in celebration of Chris Cornell. I said “no way”. We talked and laughed for a while about the difficulties of singing and playing Soundgarden songs and nicknames we were given when we were kids as we share the same name. It was “Tay Tay” that we ended up endearingly calling eachother. To now sing that same song he asked me to sing that night, standing on the same stage with his friends and band mates is surreal and heartbreaking, but in my heart I know it’s the best way I can honor one of the most amazing musicians and sweetest human beings I’ve ever met. Taylor Hawkins was and stays a treasure in this world.

I was producing Villains for Queens of the Stone Age and The Foos were making Concrete and Gold next door and Dave and Taylor would come crash our sessions. Josh and Dave would instantly fall into a rap because they have so much history and they’re essentially rock n roll deities and I would end up talking to Taylor the whole time. It feels so redundant to say this because everyone reading this program will know it but he was just about the most warm, engaging, funny, non-judgey and enthusiastic dude I’ve ever met. Plus, he’s one of the greatest rock n roll drummers of all time. Groove, chops, shred, taste – he had all of it. I loved his solo records because they encapsulated all that energy, the drummer and the man.\n\n​\n\nWe did a few records together over zoom during the pandemic. Listening to him pound skins from 2500 miles away and then run and jump on Facetime all sweaty and ask in his kind, effusive way, “Was that any good?” was my musical highlight of 2020. I wish I could tell him a hundred more times, “Any good?

I said “Taylor, do you think you can be the godfather to Beckett?” and he goes “Yeah, of course, what do I gotta do?” I go “Not really anything” and he goes “Ok great. I can do that.”\n\nHe was beautiful and we all miss him. I love him.\n\nI’d love to tell a story of one of Taylor and I’s many escapades, but those wouldn’t be probably appropriate for this so I want to tell you one that warms my heart.\n\nThe 606 studio, those guys have the Foo Fighters and around the corner is a music store called, “Guitar Center” and so I think Dave and Taylor used to go in there all the time and just go in there to see what’s going on and maybe get some stuff.\n\nBut Taylor would always go on back to the drum room, the percussion section and if there were little kids in there or wannabe drummers trying out stuff, he’d be in there and of course they’d be all excited like “Oh my god, Taylor Hawkins is here! This is so cool!” And he always took the time to talk to them and hang out with them. And they would do this over time.\n\nOne day, the manager came to the guy that ran the percussion section and said, “you know I think something’s going on with Taylor Hawkins’ credit card. There must be some fraud or something because I see thousands of dollars over months of charges and I’ve never seen Taylor buy anything ever here.”\n\nAnd the guy that worked the counter in the percussion section said, “No, they’re not fraud. Taylor would actually buy drum equipment, drum sets, sticks, cymbals, whatever was needed of any of the kids that he was hanging out with that they needed stuff and they needed equipment and he knew how important it was to have good equipment and he would just buy it for ‘em and never tell anybody and wouldn’t tell obviously the store and the kids would walk out with the stuff and that’s the kind of guy that Taylor Hawkins is.\n\nAnd I love him and I miss him everyday. And I know he’s really happy about this right now. So I love you guys.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nChad Smith is an American musician who has been the drummer of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers since 1988.

He was, my wife called him, sunshine in human form. He was the most wonderful man and I can’t quite believe that I’m not going to see him again.\n\n“He’s done a lot to help my son, who’s a great drummer, and he actually sort of mentored him. We’re going to miss him so much.”\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAlthough best known for his powerhouse role in Queen, Roger Taylor is anything but a drummer confined to his kit. With rock n’ roll in his veins he has always been a highly active member of Queen. He famously wrote Queen’s landmark hits “Radio Ga Ga” “A Kind Of Magic”, and “Sheer Heart Attack”, among other of Queen’s best known tracks.\n\nDrummer, multi-instrumentalist, Taylor became fascinated with music at a young age. He enjoyed a brief taste of things to come in a pre-teen skiffle band.\n\nIn 1968 Taylor formed the group Smile with Middlesex guitar ace Brian May. Smile played sporadically over the next few years. With the additions to the line-up of John Deacon and Freddie Mercury in 1971, Smile became known as Queen, and the rest, as they say, became history making.\n\n1977, the landmark year in which Queen released “We Are The Champions” and “We Will Rock You”, Roger became the first member of Queen to launch a solo career with the single “I Wanna Testify”.\n\nHis solo album “Fun In Space” followed in 1981, tailed in 1984 by “Strange Frontier”. Both reached the Top 30. In 1987 Roger formed his own band The Cross, after more than 20 years finally resuming the role of lead singer. The band released three albums between 1987 and 1991.\n\nFollowing the loss of Freddie Mercury, Taylor assumed a solo career, releasing the album “Happiness”. “Electric Fire” followed in 1998. The most active of the Queen members as a solo artist, Taylor returned in 2013 with the more politically and socially conscious “Fun On Earth”. Taylor has also released a series of solo singles all rooted in his observational songwriting style, most recently, “Isolation”.\n\nTaylor and fellow band member Brian May returned to touring under the name of Queen in 2005 adding vocalist Paul Rodgers and performing extensively between 2006 -2009 releasing one album together.\n\nThese days Taylor and May perform mega shows across the world fronted by Adam Lambert. To date Queen + Adam Lambert have played 218 shows to an audience close on 4 million.\n\nMarking his first live performances outside Queen in over two decades, 2022 saw Taylor return to touring to play 14 shows across October shows coinciding with the release of his latest solo album Outsider.\n\nRoger also oversees and produces The Queen Extravaganza, the official Queen Tribute act. The Queen Extravaganza is a spectacular touring concert show designed to take the music and live experience of Queen and bring it to generations of fans.\n\n​\n\nrogertaylorofficial.com\n\n“It is truly an honor to be asked to take part in this incredible event to celebrate Taylor with so many talented artists and amazing people. Taylor’s influence on me and so many others is immeasurable.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFirst impressions last a lifetime. Wolfgang Van Halen has prepared a lifetime to make his first impression. The songwriter, vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist worked tirelessly towards the introduction of MAMMOTH [Explorer1], his self-titled 2021 debut album. Playing every instrument and singing each and every note, his music presents a personal and powerful perspective, balancing memorable hooks and tight technicality. As many times as audiences have experienced his talent alongside the likes of Tremonti, Clint Lowery, and of course, Van Halen, they meet Wolf as an individual for the very first time now.\n\n​\n\n“You only have one chance to make a first impression, and I wanted to do so to the best of my abilities,” he affirms. “Throughout the whole process, I was finding who I am musically and by the end, I got a pretty good handle on a sound I can claim for myself.”\n\n​\n\nHis father often played guitar against his mother’s pregnant belly, and Wolf absorbed those vibrations from the womb. At the age of 10, his Pop gave him a drum kit for his birthday. To this day, Wolf considers himself “a drummer before anything else.” As he developed as a musician, he learned how to play guitar in order to perform “316” — which his father penned for him — at a 6th-grade talent show.\n\n​\n\nIt may come as a surprise, but outside of his father teaching him one drumbeat from an AC/DC song, Wolfgang taught himself every instrument. “My dad wasn’t the best teacher,” he laughs. “I would ask him to play something, and then he would just proceed to be Eddie Van Halen. He would look at me and say, ‘Do that.’ to which I would laugh and sarcastically reply, ‘Sure thing, no problem.”\n\n​\n\nIn the summer of 2006 when he was 15 years old, Wolf grabbed a bass and began noodling. While at the legendary 5150 Studios, his impromptu woodshedding inspired Eddie and Uncle Alex. Endless family jam sessions followed. By summer’s end, Wolfgang phoned David Lee Roth’s manager and by winter Roth showed up for rehearsal. They rocked “On Fire,” and “That’s how the 2007 tour began,” says Wolf.\n\n​\n\nNot only did Wolf canvas the world with Van Halen while in high school, but he also held down the low end on 2012’s A Different Kind of Truth—which debuted at #2 on the Billboard Top 200. When not on tour with Van Halen, he cut bass for Tremonti’s critically acclaimed Cauterize [2015] and Dust [2016] in addition to joining the band on the road. In 2019, Wolf handled drums and also played bass on half of the 10 songs for Clint Lowery’s solo debut, God Bless The Renegades.\n\nIn the midst of all this, at the beginning of 2015, Wolf broke ground on what would become MAMMOTH with producer Michael “Elvis” Baskette [Alter Bridge, Slash] behind the board. Wolf began to embrace his voice, inspired by everyone from his father, to bands like AC/DC, Foo Fighters, Nine Inch Nails, TOOL, and Jimmy Eat World. “I’ve been singing my whole life, but it wasn’t until MAMMOTH that I really found my voice. Elvis was great, and he helped me gain the confidence to become a lead vocalist.”\n\n​\n\n“The name Mammoth is really special to me.” says Wolf. “Not only was it the name of Van Halen before it became Van Halen, but my father was also the lead singer. Ever since my dad told me this, I always thought that when I grew up, I’d call my own band Mammoth, because I loved the name so much. I’m so thankful that my father was able to listen to, and enjoy the music I made. I!m really proud of the work I!ve done and nothing made me happier than seeing how proud he was that I was continuing the family legacy.”\n\n\"The first time I met Taylor he was playing with Chris Cheney for Alanis Morissette at a festival in Europe with RATM. I was blown away by his drumming and incredible will and energy. We instantly connected as drum nerds and fans of a lot of the same music growing up.\n\n​\n\nTaylor had the ability to be competitive in the most playful way… self deprecating and confident at the same time. It was always incredibly endearing and fun.\n\n​\n\nI will miss our phone conversations laughing our asses off and also supporting one another’s journey and family life. I swear I think he called every time he heard me on the radio to give me some love… a rare and special person, I would come to find out eventually that Taylor was like this with SO many people. Taylor made you feel special… but we all know that he was truly the special one. A true music lover and incredible musician. I’m going to miss him more than he will ever know. All love to Taylor Hawkins, his band mates, his family, friends, and all of his fans.\"\n\n​\n\nBrad Wilk is the drummer and founding member of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave.
