        "text": "Ann Wilson isn’t a fan of selfies at Heart shows, particularly ones where fans turn their backs to the stage. The reason for her annoyance makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe powerhouse singer recently appeared on the Broken Record podcast when the topic of seeing cell phones in the audience came up. Wilson said it’s “really distracting” when fans turn their backs to the stage and essentially use the band as a photo background. She noted that when that happens ” … you just want to sort of jump out of the way.”\n\nWilson added, “To be fair, it’s a big night for them, and they want to preserve some little memory of it. However, she noted, “I’m not a backdrop.”\n\nHeart has a slew of tour dates this year, which are listed below. If you do attend one of these shows, maybe take Wilson’s words about selfies to Heart.
