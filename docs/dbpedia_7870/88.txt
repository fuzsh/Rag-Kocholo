Josh Homme, the Cult’s Ian Astbury, Massive Attack’s 3D, Autolux, Nada Surf’s Matthew Caws, Jeordie White and the Duke Spirit are among the guests on the third UNKLE album, “War Stories,” due July 24 in North America via group leader James Lavelle’s new Surrender All label.

Astbury sings on first single “Burn My Shadow,” while Homme augments “Restless.” Lavelle also makes his vocal debut here, singing “Hold My Hand” on his own and dueting with Richard File on “Morning Rage.” The album was co-produced by Lavelle and Chris Goss and recorded in part at Rancho de la Luna Studios in Joshua Tree, Calif., home to Homme’s long-running Desert Sessions projects.

“War Stories” is the follow-up to 2003’s “Never, Never, Land,” which reached No. 6 on Billboard’s Top Electronic Albums chart. It will also be available in a limited-edition two-disc set, featuring an instrumental version of the album. The artwork features paintings from 3D.

UNKLE will tour inernational festivals this summer, and in the fall, visit North America with a full band for the first time. Dates have yet to be announced.
