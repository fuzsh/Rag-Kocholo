James George Janos[1] (born July 15, 1951), better known by his stage name Jesse Ventura, is an American actor, author, media personality, ex-Navy SEAL, former politician and retired professional wrestler who played Blain in the 1987 film Predator. Predator was Ventura's first film role. Other notable films Ventura has appeared in include The Running Man (1987), Demolition Man (1993) and Batman & Robin (1997).

Ventura was part of the U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team 12 during the Vietnam War and received a Vietnam Service Medal, although he has since disclosed that he did not see combat.[2] Following his military service, he went on to embark on a professional wrestling career lasting from 1975 to 1986. There, he claimed the ring name Jesse "The Body" Ventura. In addition, Ventura has also had a career in politics; he served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003.[3]

On television, Ventura is perhaps best-known for hosting the show Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura (2009-2012), where he and his team of investigators attempt to unravel modern-day conspiracy theories.
