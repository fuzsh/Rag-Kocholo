'Prey' has been a hit with fans and critics alike since it launched on Disney+ last Friday, and one of the stars of the original 'Predator' has sung their praises of the film.

Jesse Ventura, who starred alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in the original 1987 classic, took to social media to praise the film.

Ventura hailed 'Prey' as a "great, great film" and welcomed star Amber Midthunder "to the Predator family".

He thanked director Dan Trachtenberg for "making such a thoughtful, creative and wonderful film,".

Midthunder and Trachtenberg were delighted to receive the stamp of approval from the action movie star.

Midthunder was stunned, saying "I just… I don’t how to… thank you," while her director Dan Trachtenberg replied "Thank you sir! Thanks for watching and so glad you appreciated what we did!"

Ventura, also known for his roles in the likes of 'The Running Man', 'Demoliton Man' and 'Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe' briefly turned his hand to politics, serving as Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003.

'Prey' has enjoyed major praise from fans and critics, with fans quick to take to social media to praise the film, and our own Brian Lloyd giving it a glowing 4-star review.

His review hailed the film for its efficiency of storytelling, saying "there's not an ounce of fat on this movie, and it's far too lean to be saddled with needless world-building or exposition because the action, the tension, and the thrill of it all is more than enough to sustain it."

'Prey' is streaming on Disney+ now.
