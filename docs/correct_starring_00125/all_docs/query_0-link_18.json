        "text": "Carl Weathers' passing shook the entertainment world as he passed away on Friday. Former Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura posted a heartfelt message on X regarding the famous actor's passing.\n\nJesse Ventura shares a message about Carl Weathers via X\n\nVentura posted \"We lost an icon. Carl Weathers was a phenomenal talent, a true professional, and a dear friend. All my sympathies and love to his family. I loved working with him on Predator and then celebrating that film with him at various conventions in the ensuing years. Thank you, Carl.\"\n\nWeathers and Ventura shared the silver screen on Predator. The blockbuster hit starred Arnold Schwarzenegger where a team of mercenaries including Ventura and Weathers hunted the alien creature.\n\nWeathers died \"Peacefully in his sleep\" according to information from his family\n\nHis family shared a statement with many news outlets that read \"Carl was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life, through his contributions to film, television, the arts, and sports, he has left an indelible mark and is recognized worldwide and across generations. He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner, and friend.\"\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Weathers stated his inspiration to make it in Hollywood was from others, \"There are so many people that came before me who I admired and whose success I wanted to emulate, and just kind of hit the benchmarks they hit in terms of success, who created a pathway that I've been able to walk and find success as a result,\"."
