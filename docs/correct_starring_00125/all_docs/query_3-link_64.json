        "text": "Charisma\n\nA 12 and a half year-old girl, Melanie (Holliston Coleman), arrives at the hospital, pregnant, and won't give anyone information about herself. Benson (Mariska Hargitay) persuades her to write down her address, and gets the name of the baby's father - Abraham (Jeff Kober), Melanie's husband. When Benson goes to the address, she sees numerous children inside and a very strange and dangerous looking Abraham at the door. He slams the door on the police - then they hear shots fired. All of the children in the house are found dead and Abraham has escaped.\n\nPolitical Animal\n\nWhen three roommates are found dead in their apartment, Detectives Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin and Cyrus Lupo's (Jeremy Sisto) initial examination of the crime scene suggests a murder-suicide amongst jealous lovers. This notion is quickly dismissed when the detectives discover one of the victims, Todd Stewart (guest star Jonathan Sale) an environmental attorney, had a closeted relationship with a prominent political figure. After the politician's fingerprints don't match the prints on the murder weapon the investigation shifts focus to Victor Vargas, a political fundraiser who gave the detectives their first lead. When Vargas' address turns out to be bogus and then a little background research uncovers a past of illegal activities including fraud, the detectives realize they've got their guy. But no one is prepared for the lengths to which Vargas will go and who among his political allies he will turn on to keep his freedom. Also starring: Sam Waterston, S. Epatha Merkerson, Linus Roache and Alana De La Garza.\n\nStory Four\n\nChristy (Jaime Pressly) heads up to the mountains to try and bond with her new boyfriend, Paul (John Ortiz), and his 8-year-old daughter. However, when she self-medicates to deal with her anxiety she ends up revealing some skeletons in her closet."
