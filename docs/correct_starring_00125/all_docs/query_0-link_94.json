        "text": "The next phase of the “Predator” franchise was previously announced as they’ll be making a follow-up to director Dan Trachtenberg‘s “Prey” with “Badlands.” However, its been said the new movie is going to be set further into the future and won’t be a direct sequel to “Prey” (But one is also in the works).\n\nA big casting update has been shared by Deadline, as they have announced that Elle Fanning (“The Great”) is in talks to take the lead role in the new sci-fi actioner.\n\nThe studio is in negotiations with a popular actress like Fanning could suggest that 20th Century Studios may attempt to release the film in theaters after “Prey” headed to Hulu/Disney+.\n\n20th Century Studios is also about to release Fede Alvarez’s “Alien Romulus” which is said to be a standalone story set between the events of Ridley Scott’s original “Alien” (produces the film) and James Cameron’s “Aliens” as the filmmaker hopes to find a balance where “Romulus” invokes a balanced tone of both those movies. “Romulus” was originally meant to be a Hulu exclusive until the studio changed its mind after how well-received “Prey” was (the studio missing out on box office dollars on that one).\n\nThere is the potential that “Alien Romulus” and “Badlands” future settings could eventually lead audiences to a new, more faithful take on “Aliens vs Predator,” where a boring/dull Earthbound setting is avoided to go completely off-world as seen in the video games and comics books which the crossover originally took place. Some of the more common occurrences where humans, androids/synthetics, predators/yautja, and xenomorphs interact with each other happen on off-world colonies/mining operations connected to Weyland-Yutani.\n\nSOURCE: DEADLINE\n\n“Prey” seemed like a big success for both 20th Century Studios and director Dan Trachtenberg as they attempted to infuse new blood into the “Predator” franchise after Shane Black‘s “The Predator” seemed to feel like they were running on fumes. The Hollywood Reporter has revealed that a second film from Trachtenberg and the sixth franchise installment is indeed on the way under the working title of “Badlands.”\n\nWhile details are scarce they are quick to point out that the film isn’t a direct sequel to “Prey” (Set in 1719) but will continue the last film’s angle of using a female protagonist and is said to jump into the future, which seems like a cue to the studio’s “Alien” franchise. This should give “Predator” fans hope that the franchise might start pushing toward the comic book and video game incarnations of the “Alien vs Predator,” where the hunters would bump into humans trying to colonize planets that happened to be gaming preserves.\n\nHow far into the future remains to be seen and if this will be another Earthbound adventure.\n\nPatrick Aison (“Prey”) wrote the screenplay for “Badlands” with Trachtenberg working with Aison on the story. The report also mentions that more “Predator” projects are in the works that involve Trachtenberg, without dishing on exact details of what that means. Perhaps, we could end up getting a streaming series on Hulu/Disney+ not unlike what is happening with the “Alien” prequel show that hails from Noah Hawley (“Legion,” “Fargo”), but that is just an early assumption on our part.\n\nUPDATE: Deadline adds in their version of the story that while it’s only in early development, “Prey 2” is still in the works and that Midthunder is expected to reprise the Naru role in it.\n\nRumors had pegged that a “Predator 6” would be a direct sequel to “Prey” with actress Amber Midthunder returning after a cliffhanger ending that teased the alien hunters’ return and potentially inducting Naru into one of the clans. Mirroring other humans that have joined Predator clans after proving themselves to be great warriors, similar to Machiko Noguchi (A character from the “AVP” comics). Given this reported time-jump there is nothing stopping them from bringing back Midthunder to play an ancestor of Naru, depending on the actual setting of the film as there is a good chance with a “future setting” they could move forward enough into this universe where there are off-world colonies (“Alien: Romulus” will feature a colony of humans fighting off a Xenomorph).\n\nWe’ll keep our fingers crossed that we’ll eventually get “Prey 2” but sounds like “Badlands” might be moving the franchise in a different direction. Perhaps, the ultimate goal is to lead directly in a futuristic off-world crossover between the “Alien” and “Predator” universes after the lackluster attempts with less-than-impressive “AVP” movies that took place in a contemporary Earthbound setting (Yawn, boring).\n\nSOURCE: THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\n\nHollywood is looking at a bunch of various copyright lawsuits, one of the most notable ones is focused on Friday The 13th with the film’s producer and writer fighting in court claiming rights to the franchise.\n\nToday, it was announced via The Hollywood Reporter that Friday The 13th screenwriter Victor Miller has won an appeal to secure the domestic rights to the horror franchise from producer Sean Cunningham.\n\nOn Thursday, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a win for him in a copyright termination battle. As a result, he’s set to reclaim the domestic rights to the franchise.\n\nCunningham had claimed Miller’s script was work for hire, which was refuted by a federal judge back in 2018.\n\nIt’s a big win for Marc Toberoff, who is representing other screenwriters trying to get the rights/copyright to their material.\n\nThe original killer in the 1980 film was Pamela Voorhees, the mother of Jason, who had drowned at Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of the camp staff. At the end of the film, an undead Jason leaps from the water and became the staple killer for the franchise moving on.\n\nCrystal Lake’s history of murder doesn’t deter counselors from setting up a summer camp in the woodsy area. Superstitious locals warn against it, but the fresh-faced young people — Jack (Kevin Bacon), Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) and Ned (Mark Nelson) — pay little heed to the old-timers. Then they find themselves stalked by a brutal killer. As they’re slashed, shot and stabbed, the counselors struggle to stay alive against a merciless opponent.\n\nAttorney Marc Toberoff, is also representing John and Jim Thomas with their own attempt to get the rights to their 1987 script that was turned into the Predator franchise. One of the handful of keystone IP properties at 20th Century Studios that Disney inherited when they purchased 21st Century Fox.\n\nThere is a possibility that this appeals win for Victor Miller, might lead to the Thomas Brothers also getting participation with the domestic rights to Predator. However, we’ll have to see how things shape-up in the courtroom, as each one of these copyright cases aren’t apples-to-apples.\n\nSOURCE: THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER\n\nFriday marked the 25th anniversary of German director Roland Emmerich‘s alien invasion film “Independence Day,” but it wasn’t the only big sci-fi spectacle he had been working on for 20th Century Fox.\n\nIn the wake of David Fincher‘s “Alien 3,” it felt like 20th Century Fox was over the “Alien” franchise, and Sigourney Weaver leading it. Ellen Ripley had killed herself at the end of the film making subsequent sequels seemingly moot after their lead character’s death and flopping at the box office. Thinking they were done with the Ripley saga, between “Alien 3” and “Alien Resurrection” the studio tried to develop an early incarnation of an “Alien vs. Predator” movie years before the Paul W.S. Anderson version.\n\nScreenwriter Peter Briggs (“Hellboy“) wrote a spec script in 1991 to impress producer Joel Silver.\n\nA rumor appeared in 1992 (same year that “Universal Soldier” is released) that Emmerich was going to direct an “AVP” film based on the popular Dark Horse Comics run, this wasn’t hard to imagine because 1990’s “Predator 2” had given audiences a nod to the comic book crossover as they added a xenomorph skull on a wall of trophies in the predator ship at the end of the film. In 1994, “Stargate” is released and that success leads to another original humans vs. aliens project with the 1996 box office juggernaut “Independence Day,” Toho and TriStar Pictures feel confident enough to allow Roland Emmerich to direct a modern “Godzilla” reboot using CGI special effects.\n\nIn 1996, “Alien Resurrection” begins shooting in Los Angeles with French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet overseeing the sequel and Ellen Ripley is brought back via the wonders of cloning (originally going to be a clone of Newt), thanks “Jurassic Park.” The film ends with the survivors landing in Paris and leaves the door open for a fifth installment.\n\nIn the November 1997 issue of Starlog Magazine, screenwriter Dean Devlin (“Stargate,” “Independence Day,” “Godzilla“) was interviewed about his Fox Television series “The Visitor” and asked about the status with “Alien vs. Predator” he replied, “For the time being, it’s dead. We wanted to do it if they had not just decided to do ‘Alien Resurrection,’ and now we’re all just waiting around to see how that film does. If it really works, the studio is going to want to continue the franchise with just the alien. If that were to happen, then we won’t be involved at all.”\n\nThis interview taking place before “Alien Resurrection”s late November release and while the sequel made slightly more than “Alien 3,” it still didn’t meet studio expectations. The following year, Roland and Dean released their critical disaster “Godzilla,” which was ridiculed and likely could have been a reason why 20th Century Fox ultimately didn’t want them handling a crossover to their two lucrative sci-fi franchises.\n\nSpeaking of “Predator 2,” Arnold Schwarzenegger was originally going to return as Dutch in the sequel before the role was reworked as Peter Keyes for actor Gary Busey and there has been a longstanding rumor that Arnold was going to star in this “AVP” movie, there might be something behind that.\n\nIn 1991, before Emmerich’s “Universal Soldier” starring Jean-Claude Van Damme was released in 1992, Schwarzenegger visited the film’s set, and we have a bunch of photos that documented that visit. There is a possibility that Arnold was there to get a read on Roland Emmerich and speak to Jean-Claude Van Damme about his experience working with him.\n\nJCVD’s star was rising in the 1990s and had played the first incarnation of the alien hunter in “Predator” before leaving during Stan Winston‘s redesign of the creature (with some help from James Cameron) to lead his action film “Bloodsport” instead of being hidden behind a predator costume.\n\nProducers had been trying to lure him back to the “Predator” franchise every chance they got and a crossover with a huge budget along with the right director could be attractive enough for Arnold to get involved. A reminder, the studio was looking to move past Weaver since Ripley was dead and Schwarzenegger was hot as a pistol at the box office, Dutch was theoretically still alive and every “Predator” sequel since there have been attempts to have him appear.\n\nIt wouldn’t be the last time Arnold Schwarzenegger hypothetically got involved with a project connected to the “Alien” franchise, as James Cameron had wanted to bring in his “Terminator 2” and “True Lies” actor to co-star with Sigourney Weaver on the first incarnation of “Alien 5” that was abandoned when 20th Century Fox decided to go with an Earthbound PG-13 project from “Resident Evil” director Paul W.S. Anderson.\n\n“Something similar to what we did with Aliens. A bunch of great characters, and of course Sigourney [Weaver]. I’ve even discussed the possibility of putting him [Arnold Schwarzenegger] into the Alien movie,” Cameron told the BBC in 2003 about the possibility of adding Schwarzenegger to his “Alien 5.”\n\nPaul W.S. Anderson begins shooting “Alien vs. Predator” in Prague at the end of 2003 and essentially kills “Alien 5,” finally ending the Ellen Ripley saga for good.\n\nJames Cameron pivots to “Avatar” and the film still holds the global box office record thanks to a re-release with four sequels on the horizon.\n\nThe original version of “Alien 5” would see Ridley Scott direct with Cameron producing and co-writing (possibly with “Alien Resurrection” screenwriter Joss Whedon writing too) and would take Ripley to the homeworld of the xenomorph. The project was never made, but Ridley Scott returned to tackle his prequel “Prometheus” attempting to explore the origin of Space Jockey (engineers) and was a producer on Neill Blomkamp‘s new “Alien 5” incarnation (approved by James Cameron) that would have acted as a direct sequel to “Aliens” (ignoring the other two sequels) before that also stalled, “Alien: Covenant” stepping in to fill the void.\n\nScott is currently producing Noah Hawley‘s “Alien” series at FX that will be set on Earth and return the franchise to its class warfare root. He’s also talked-up a third prequel film still being in the works that has previously used the working title of “Alien: Awakening.”\n\nThe Ronin is hearing that a trio of unknowns might have roles in 20th Century Studios’ next installment of the Predator franchise. The project directed by Dan Trachtenberg shares the same casting director as Martin Scorsese’s Killers of The Flower Moon, which hinted to unknowns potentially joining Predator 5’s cast. Production began recently in Calgary and creature effects house Studio ADI confirmed their return to the franchise.\n\nThose three unconfirmed names are model/activist Quannah Chasinghorse, musician Dakota Beavers, and Harlando Khat.\n\nUPDATE: We’ve learned two more names with Cree actor Tymon Carter and Skye Pelletier.\n\nThe Ronin mentioned almost a full month ago they might be pursuing unknowns for the sci-fi movie.\n\nWe’re still waiting on casting announcements concerning who’ll be playing the humans in the new film, but we’re hearing that Dan might end up hiring unknowns for some of the lead roles.\n\nFilming is expected to wrap in August.\n\nWe’ve confirmed a while ago that Kyle Strauts (The Predator) would be back in the predator suit and mentioned Amber Midthunder (Legion, The Ice Road) as the potential lead actress on the project, the latter was backed-up by Discussing Film.\n\nThe film is reportedly going to involve a group of Comanche warriors with a female protagonist, assumed to be played by Amber Midthunder and would suggest this could be the first Predator installment that entirely takes place before the events of John McTiernan’s original installment. Given the project’s setting, it wouldn’t be shocking to see them fill out roles with a bunch of new actors.\n\nPredator 5’s production team consists of cinematographer Jeff Cutter (10 Cloverfield Lane), production designer Kara Lindstrom (Den of Thieves), and stunt coordinator Steven McMichael (Damnation).\n\nA big thanks to Nicholas Whitcomb, who has been helping with our recent Predator and Alien franchise coverage. Please give him a follow over on Twitter and subscribe to his channel on YouTube. Nick and I previously worked together at HN Entertainment, we both share a mutual passion for these two sci-fi franchises.\n\nDisney hasn’t given Predator 5 an official release day but trades had suggested a possible drop next summer.\n\nPREDATOR – Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a soldier of fortune, is hired by the U.S. government to secretly rescue a group of politicians trapped in Guatemala. But when Dutch and his team, which includes weapons expert Blain (Jesse Ventura) and CIA agent George (Carl Weathers), land in Central America, something is gravely wrong. After finding a string of dead bodies, the crew discovers they are being hunted by a brutal creature with superhuman strength and the ability to disappear into its surroundings.\n\nPredator 5 started production this week in Calgary and we finally know who will be tackling the creature effects on the fifth installment. Studio ADI, who tackled Alien vs. Predator, Alien vs. Predator: Requiem, and The Predator, is officially back for the latest project.\n\nSome folks over at Studio ADI have confirmed on Instagram they’ll be returning to handle predator creature effects on Predator 5, including Alec Gills himself. The film is being directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane’s Dan Trachtenberg and it’s said that the alien hunter will clash with a group of Comanche warriors, something that the crew shirt reflects.\n\nThe Ronin first revealed that The Predator’s Kyle Strauts (we’ve now confirmed) would be reprising the role of the titular predator with Legion actress Amber Midthunder potentially taking a lead role (still unconfirmed by Disney/20th Century Studios).\n\nPredator 5’s production team consists of cinematographer Jeff Cutter (10 Cloverfield Lane), production designer Kara Lindstrom (Den of Thieves), and stunt coordinator Steven McMichael (Damnation).\n\nNeither Disney nor 20th Century Studios have announced a release date but trades had been speculation it would land a spot in the Summer of 2022.\n\nA big thanks to our pal Nicholas Whitcomb for sending this our way, please give him a follow over on Twitter and subscribe to his channel on YouTube. Nick and I previously worked together at HN Entertainment. So, if you like what we’re doing here at The Ronin, I would advise you check him out as well as he’s equally as passionate about genre projects, if not more.\n\nPREDATOR – Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a soldier of fortune, is hired by the U.S. government to secretly rescue a group of politicians trapped in Guatemala. But when Dutch and his team, which includes weapons expert Blain (Jesse Ventura) and CIA agent George (Carl Weathers), land in Central America, something is gravely wrong. After finding a string of dead bodies, the crew discovers they are being hunted by a brutal creature with superhuman strength and the ability to disappear into its surroundings.\n\nThe Disney-owned 20th Century Studios is moving forward with a fifth Predator film directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane’s Dan Trachtenberg and is said to be a large departure from previous installments. As instead of muscle-bound soldiers or cops, it’s rumored that the main human protagonist is going to be a young female Comanche warrior.\n\nDan will be reuniting with cinematographer Jeff Cutter, the two previously worked together on Bad Robot’s 10 Cloverfield Lane.\n\nThe Ronin has now learned that two more folks have joined Predator 5’s production team with Den of Thieves production designer Kara Lindstrom and stunt coordinator Steven McMichael (Damnation, Wynonna Earp) have boarded the sci-fi action flick. Steven was once Hugh Jackman’s stunt double in the original X-Men movie and has moved up the ranks in the stunt world since.\n\nKara has been posting amazing landscape pictures from Alberta on Instagram. There has been talk they’ll be using beautiful and remote areas in Alberta for various exteriors needed for the shoot.\n\nProduction in Calgary, Alberta, Canada is confirmed to begin June 7 and wrap by August 20. There is an assumption we’ll start hearing some casting news with the production less than a month away.\n\nThe previous installment The Predator from director Shane Black was meant to lead to multiple contemporary sequels as teased with that ridiculous predator-killer suit post-credit scene. However, this next film isn’t expected to continue that story or characters, which might relieve a lot of fans that weren’t thrilled with how The Predator turned out.\n\nEvery Predator sequel since Predator 2 has attempted to coax Arnold Schwarzenegger to return as his iconic franchise character Dutch, but it remains to be seen if they’ll even attempt that if Predator 5 is going to taking place too far in the past for that to make sense.\n\nNeither Disney nor 20th Century Studios have officially given the Predator sequel an official release date or announced the film’s release date."
