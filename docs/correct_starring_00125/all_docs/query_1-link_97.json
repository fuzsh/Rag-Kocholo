        "text": "The Predator prequel Prey hit Hulu this weekend, and it’s revitalized a sometimes troubled franchise. It’s scored the best reviews of the series and it’s even got a great (if sometimes pesky) movie dog. Among the fans is one of the actors from the 1987 original who went on to become a governor. No, not Schwarzenegger. The other thespian-turned-politician (who was also a wrestler).\n\nOn Saturday, Jesse Ventura — the WWF star who played one of the original film’s victims and went on to become the governor of Minnesota — took to Twitter to offer fulsome praise of the latest addition to the Predator franchise.\n\n“Great, great, film,” Ventura wrote, saying that star Amber Midthunder, who plays a Comanche warrior who battles the well-armed alien hunter, “definitely ain’t got time to bleed.” He also welcomed director Dan Trachtenberg “to the Predator family,” adding, “Thank you for making a such a thoughtful, creative, and wonderful film.”\n\nVentura can be a hard moviegoer to please. He once slammed American Sniper, Clint Eastwood’s biopic about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, albeit without seeing it. But he didn’t exactly have to: He’d known the real Kyle and he disputed claims made about him in the book that inspired the movie, which ended with him winning a defamation suit. In a statement, Ventura implied that Kyle was a man without honor.\n\nPrey now streams on Hulu."
