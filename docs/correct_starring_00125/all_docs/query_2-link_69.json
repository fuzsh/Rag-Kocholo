        "text": "In addition to his powerful persuasive abilities, Jesse was good at promoting the heels he defended on-air, plying heat to those who needed it and extolling those who were already red hot. Some heels desperately needed the extra boost\n\nJesse’s approval could provide, others not so much. Regardless, everybody benefitted from Jesse’s commentary because WWF broadcasts were now somewhat fair and balanced, if such a phrase can even be applied to pro wrestling at all.\n\nLet’s face it; most of pro-wrestling consists of looking the other way. The referees do it all the time when the rules are being broken. Was a set of brass knuckles used in the ring? Whoops—didn’t see it! And neither did Jesse. He was good at overlooking the rule-breaking and even better at justifying it whenever McMahon called him out on his willful ignorance. This brings us to the why element of expressing an opinion.\n\nAs biased as Jesse’s commentary was, he still managed to listen and acknowledge McMahon’s pro-good guy take on everything happening in the ring. In other words, Jesse listened long enough to create the illusion (if indeed it was an illusion) that he and McMahon were having a real heated discussion and didn’t much like each other.\n\nAlthough the apparent animosity never went beyond some amusing bickering, I could always sense the joy in Jesse’s voice whenever he one-upped McMahon during a verbal exchange (which happened a lot owing to Jesse’s quick thinking). Jesse once remarked his job basically consisted of telling his boss off every week. Now that sounds like a dream job most of us poor working stiffs would love to have.\n\nIf the why element is all about the conversation, the where is all about the platform. I can’t imagine watching a sporting competition on TV without commentators. It would be like watching a movie without a music soundtrack.\n\nI need to see the fans, read their clever homemade signs, hear their roars and chants. It’s wrestling, and the opinions expressed usually stay confined to the world of wrestling. And because Jesse never mentioned politics or current events during his color commentary, I didn’t have an inkling politics was in his blood.\n\nActing, yes, because wrestling is theatre, wrestling is acting, but not politics. Politics has real consequences.\n\nJust because you have a platform doesn’t mean it is the right setting to wade into deeper waters. Jesse eventually moved from the wrestling ring to the political ring, where his heretofore-unknown political opinions found their proper context. Using his former pro-wrestler credentials to boost his outsider standing with voters, Jesse turned his wrestling platform into a springboard for victory.\n\nSiskel & Ebert were talking to moviegoers about movies, and yes, occasionally they expressed their opinions about bigotry, sexism, and violence, but always in the context of the movies they were reviewing, or the film industry in general. And yet, just from the nature of their discourse—passionate and articulate—I could tell Roger and Gene probably held thoughtful opinions on a lot more than just movies.\n\nTurning to Meenakshi Narayanan again, she wrote in her article:\n\n“Beyond these three vital elements, I’ve discovered the elixir of the art of expressing opinions: choosing peace over arguments when a conversation won’t lead to significant change.”\n\nWhen I was a kid I co-opted the opinions of Jesse Ventura, and Siskel & Ebert and made them my own. Anybody who watched wrestling with me had to hear me echo Jesse’s takes on why the good guy didn’t deserve to win, and how he robbed the supposed “bad guy” of a victory. And like Jesse, I tried to convince my friends the dirty tricks they thought they saw the heel wrestlers do didn’t actually happen. I didn’t convince a single one of them, but over time I became a better debater. And all that meant was I was able to defend opinions that weren’t truly mine.\n\nAnybody who wanted to go to the movies with me had to see what I wanted to see because if the movie hadn’t earned two thumbs up from Siskel & Ebert, I wasn’t going to see it. Through sheer will, I managed to get a few of my friends to begrudgingly go along with my picks. Frankly, it’s a wonder anybody stayed friends with me.\n\nAs I grew older and learned to mellow out (for the most part), I became less of a snob. I also became less interested in persuading anybody they were wrong about anything. Any political debating that took place was done in a very sporting manner. If it got out of control, I’d bow out. Let’s agree to disagree is what I say. It is much more important to me today “to choose peace over arguments when a conversation won’t lead to significant change.”\n\nSiskel & Ebert are no longer with us, but I still watch them on YouTube regularly to revisit old reviews. On YouTube, I also watch old interviews of the always-opinionated Frank Zappa and watch old segments of Andy Rooney ranting on the evils of daylight savings time. Opinionated people—those who do it right, anyway—will always have a gravitational pull on my mind. It’s the how, why, and where of their persuasion.\n\nWhile watching videos of Jesse “The Body” Ventura on YouTube, I felt the same gravitational pull I felt when I was a kid. Jesse was railing on the nation’s two-party political system and the need to overturn it and start over. The more I watched him, the more sense he made. And just like that “The Body” was changing my mind. Like my mother-in-law is fond of saying: “It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it.” I have to remember that one all the time.\n\nOn that note, I’ll leave you with a Jesse quote that pretty much sums him up in a nutshell:"
