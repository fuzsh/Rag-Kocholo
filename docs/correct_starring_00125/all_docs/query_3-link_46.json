        "text": "THEMES\n\nMcTiernan seems to have used PREDATOR as a testing ground for the themes he would explore in DIE HARD and the ideas he would use to dismantle the typical Eighties action film and move the genre into the Nineties with the Bruce Willis classic. Not only in terms of the aesthetics discussed already but in the themes of political critique and the skewering of the macho. Much has been made of PREDATOR as an allegory of the Vietnam War and there have been several essays and Youtube videos on the subject. The parallels are obvious: American soldiers sent into the jungle on a mission where the objective is not clear and is morally compromised by political intrigue, where they are picked off by an unseen, unstoppable enemy using guerrilla tactics. The mid-Eighties led to resurgence in Vietnam War movies but unlike the films that depicted that conflict in the 1970s (COMING HOME, THE DEER HUNTER), the 80s Vietnam’s films often seemed to find solutions for the flaws of the war. RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART 2 basically restaged the war, allowing Rambo to defy his superiors’ motives to rescue abandoned POWs and defeat the North Vietnamese Army (and their Soviet backers.)ALIENS suggested that if the military was allowed to use the full force of their arsenal (one of the conservative criticisms of the Vietnam War was that the US was fighting with one hand tied behind its back) and rooted out the bad apples in the industrial-military complex the “good guys” can annihilate the enemy. PLATOON and HAMBURGER HILL illustrated the futility and misguided objectives of the war. Perhaps it was the fact that enough time had passed for some of the psychological and social wounds of the war had begun to heal and/or the bombastic optimism of the Reagan administration, that audiences and filmmaker seemed ready to explore and try to confront the perceived mistakes of the Vietnam War.\n\nPREDATOR also critiques both the objectives and the execution of the military campaign. The character of Dillon (played by Carl Weathers), an old friend of Dutch’s and now an CIA operative who has master minded the rescue/assassination mission, is depicted for much of the movie as the secondary villain. He is portrayed as slippery, secretive and totally out of his depth. He is mistrusted and mocked by the rest of the team, he struggles to physically keep up with the battle hardened heroes and it is eventually revealed that he has lied and manipulated Dutch into carrying out the mission. Dillon stands as a symbol for the morally questionable military-industrial complex whose machinations some felt where responsible for the failings of the war. Dutch and his men stand for the “Good soldiers” that are lied to about the operations true objectives and are morally just in their actions. In the opening scene, Dillon asks Dutch why he has rejected previous missions at the request of the CIA and Dutch responds:\n\n“We are a rescue team, not assassins.”\n\nWhen the mission’s true objective is revealed, that they are not there to rescue diplomats captured by guerrillas but to take out a Communist army about to launch a military coup, Dutch admonishes Dillon for his subterfuge. It is suggested that Dillon, and the shady characters he symbolises, who is responsible for the failures of the war, not “true” soldiers like Dutch. Dillon tries to explain the moral complexities of his motivations but this falls on deaf ears.\n\nDUTCH: What happened to you, Dillon? You used to someone I could trust.\n\nDILLON: I woke up. So should you.\n\nBut the film suggests that Dillon (and those like him) are the ones that need to wake up. Dillon is given redemption of sorts, when he joins forces with the team, setting aside his differences for his own survival and dies in an attempt to hold off the Predator so Dutch can escape. PREDATOR suggests that if those at the top, the ones making the decisions would act like “good” soldiers that disasters like the Vietnam War would not happen.\n\nMcTiernan and the writers also suggest another way that the Vietnam War could have been won. The character of the Predator could be taken as a symbolic representation of the Viet Cong, an enemy who is invisible, blending in with its surroundings, use guerrilla tactics and sneak attacks to psychologically batter its enemies. Much like James Cameron’s 1986 film ALIENS, which also used its creature as a metaphor for the Viet Cong, the use of monstrous aliens as representations of the North Vietnamese is problematic. The Predator is coded as something Other, as ethnic, with its dreadlock like tendrils and tribal attire. (PREDATOR 2 actually carried on this theme of racial coding to the character, set in a futuristic LA boiling over with racial tension.)PREDATOR offers a solution to the failures of the Vietnam War in that Dutch eventually defeats the Predator by learning from his enemy. When Dutch is left as the only survivor of his team and decide to take on the alien one on one, he abandons his previous attempts of fighting the creature head on and the scorched earth approach seen in the earlier mini gun scene, where the team level a whole area of jungle with their heavy weaponry. In the final act, Dutch copies the tactics of the Predator, after discovering that by covering himself in the clay like jungle mud he is invisible to the alien’s heat vision. Dutch creates his own primitive weapons- bows and arrows, spears and traps- whilst using the foliage to blend in with his surroundings. That’s right; Dutch has become a Viet Cong soldier, using guerrilla tactics to take out a technologically superior enemy. Dutch even appears like a VC guerrilla, with his mud covered camouflage. It’s an incredible reversal, as McTiernan depicts the American soldier coded as a Viet Cong guerrilla.\n\nPREDATOR AND THE MACHO\n\nThis leads to the final theme I will discuss.; McTiernan’s skewering of the overblown machismo of the Eighties action movie. The Eighties was the era of the body builder and the action hero of the time was defined by being the definition of hyper masculinity. The biggest stars were the biggest men; physically imposing men with the bodies of an Adonis and limited acting ability. No one could claim that Schwarzenegger, Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lungren were particularly great thespians but they weren’t required to be. These heroes didn’t show emotion or vulnerabilities, they were killing machines that would crack a joke whilst cracking bad guy’s spines. Schwarzenegger’s signature role as THE TERMINATOR even saw him playing a literal killing machine. Even protagonists who didn’t quite fit this physical mould like Sigourney Weaver in ALIENS or Peter Weller in ROBOCOP, used armour and heavy firepower to become an invulnerable machine. Perhaps this was a reflection of the way Reagan era America now saw itself: big, bad and unstoppable. At first PREDATOR seems to be taking this image to the extreme. McTiernan fetishizes the bodies of the pumped up cast, with numerous shots of their naked, sweaty torsos. The director leans into the homoerotic charge that is latent in this era and PREDATOR features such loving shots of men’s bodies that they would look out of place in Kenneth Anger’s avant-garde Queer classic SCORPIO RISING. There is undoubtedly some gay subtext in the film, with this close knit group of men who are resistant to outsiders (the team are suspicious and threatening towards Dillon) and the incredibly close relationship between Mac and Blain hints at something more than just being brothers in arms. Mac weeps and grieves for Blain, tenderly standing vigil over his body and is driven to a deranged quest for vengeance. The relationship between Dillon and Dutch share these homoerotic undertones. Perhaps it is due to Schwarzenegger’s limited expressiveness as an actor that when he sees Dillon in the first scene his reaction is more reminiscent of someone greeting an old flame. When Dillon betrays Dutch there is the overtones of a betrayal in a relationship given Dutch’s hurt reaction. In the final scene before Dillon’s death, when Dillon finally proves that he is a heroic, “good” soldier, they gaze at each other as Dillon’s sweaty, undulating midriff is exposed. Dutch even throws Dillon a phallic gun as he leaves. There is also the fact that a woman is brought into the cast of characters, a prisoner from the rebel camp called Anna (Elpidia Carrilo), the team reluctantly bring her along and only do so under the orders of Dillon. It is telling that there is no sexual tension between the team and Anna, with the only exception being a brief scene where Anna smiles flirtingly at Poncho (Richard Chaves), however this is only as a prelude to an escape attempt. Dutch and the others seem uninterested in her as a sexual object or even for the most in anyway. It is only when she shares her knowledge of the Predator that the men start to show any interest in her and by the end of the film Dutch (almost) see her as an equal. This homoerotic tension and lack of heterosexual desire in the characters has also lead to some reading the film as an AIDS allegory. In the mid to late Eighties the AIDS crisis gripped America and undoubtedly the societal anxiety regarding the disease was reflected in the cinema of the time (Croneberg’s THE FLY is the definitive text of AIDS metaphors in Eighties horror). There are some elements in PREDATOR that do fit with an AIDS allegory reading, the (for the most part) all male cast are attacked by an unseen, unstoppable enemy that brings certain death despite the characters physical strength. (I’m aware that this is a reductive view of the AIDS crisis, the disease was an equal opportunity killer but in the media it was often coded as a “gay plague.”) I’m not sure this was intentional in the way that some of the other themes are and the reading doesn’t quite hold water as there is little to code the Predator as a disease although perhaps the way the alien is coded as foreign or Other is a nod to the fears that AIDS was brought to America by a foreigner from an exotic land. (See the demonization of Gaetan Dugas, falsely identified as Patient Zero during the AIDS crisis in America.)\n\nThis digression into the homoerotic subtext found in the film leads into the more prominent theme of the death of the macho that I think was intentional on McTiernan’s part. It is right there in the film’s opening scene with the famous image of the mid-air arm wrestle between Dutch and Dillon. The shot drew laughter in the screening I attended and there is a sense of comic book ridiculousness to the shot almost surreal in its depiction of bulging biceps. That sets the tone for the rest of the movie in particular the more comic first half. McTiernan leans into the hyper masculinity that is typical of the Eighties action genre and ramps it up to the point of parody. The macho posturing of the rescue team is played for laughs in particular the character of Blain played by wrestler turned actor Jesse Ventura. Blain is a parody of the alpha male, his pumped up muscles, handle bar moustache and cowboy hat is visually representative of a certain type of masculinity. His dialogue and character interactions also highlight his masculine credentials. Blain chews tobacco, spitting disgusting black goo on Dillon’s shoes to emasculate him. He calls the others in the team “slack jawed faggots” and refers to himself as “a sexual tyrannosaurs(sic)”.\n\nAgain this links to the homoerotic subtext discussed earlier, Blain could be seen as a closeted gay character overcompensating with macho bravado by accusing others of being less manly. In the rescue/assassination sequences he is shot which he dismisses with “I ain’t got time to bleed.” McTiernan also visualises Blain’s hyper-masculinity by giving him the largest weapon, a mini gun which according to the filmmakers is normally mounted to the side of a helicopter. Blain carries this around on his side pushing his masculine capabilities to the extreme. Blain however is one of the first to die, shot in the back with a laser bolt from the Predator. That moment is followed by a scene McTiernan has actually stated was an intentional parody of the gun lust of the Eighties action movie. Mac finds Blain’s body, sees the Predator and grabs the mini gun, firing wildly into the jungle. The rest of the team join him and what follows is a few minutes of nothing but gunfire as the team level an entire portion of the jungle. The sequence lasts just a few moments too long, just long enough fir the scene to become comical. The final twist is that despite the amount of destruction, the Predator escapes completely unscathed. McTiernan is showing the ridiculousness and futility of gung ho machismo. McTiernan also delights in dismantling the macho posturing of the heroes when the Predator begins to pick them off one by one. It’s surprising how far McTiernan goes in skewering the hyper-masculinity of the characters: Mac is torn apart by grief over Blain’s death that he completely unravels, Billy (a Native American character who has some lazy qausi-mystical insight into the Predator) becomes convinced of the team’s impending doom “We’re all going die”; Poncho is badly wounded and spends the remainder of the film a whimpering wreck before being shot in the back by the Predator.\n\nThe final face-off between Dutch and the Predator in the third act features one last comment on hyper masculinity from McTiernan. Has there ever been a sequence in Schwarzenegger’s career than the final battle in PREDATOR? Due to his imposing physical stature, Schwarzenegger’s nemeses are usually more cerebral threats, normally well-spoken European bad guys who use armies of henchmen to try and take out the Austrian Oak. Rarely is Schwarzenegger’s physically outmatched and watching the final fight in PREDATOR, it was surprising to see a beaten and bloodied Schwarzenegger, cowering and whimpering at the hands of the Predator. McTiernan has always taken great pains to depict his action heroes as flesh and blood human beings who bleed and cry and show their fear. McTiernan took this idea even further with DIE HARD but the seeds of this approach can be seen in PREDATOR, although no doubt he was hampered in any attempt to create a more human character by Schwarzenegger’s limitations as an actor. McTiernan is a capable director of actors and he does get a decent performance out of Schwarzenegger in PREDATOR, mainly by playing to his strengths and by not asking him to emote too much. (LAST ACTION HERO, Schwarzenegger and McTiernan’s second collaboration was less successful as the actor struggled with the more comic elements of the film.) The final fight between Dutch and The Predator also features one other comment by McTiernan on hyper masculinity. Stripped off his reliance on weaponry, Dutch must use his wits to survive, learning from the Predator’s guerrilla tactics. The wordless, suspenseful final battle becomes a cat and mouse battle of wills between two warriors and Dutch defeats the Predator by luring the creature into a trap. McTiernan’s view on macho posturing is clear: it isn’t guns or brawn but brains that is the most important quality in a hero.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPREDATOR is one of the best action movies of the Eighties and is the perfect example of the big is better philosophy of Hollywood genre filmmaking of that era. It certainly checks all the boxes of the 80’s action movie: muscle bound stars, big guns, over the top action, cheesy one-liners. However, whereas a lot of similar Eighties action movies did little more than check the boxes, John McTiernan’s approach to PREDATOR is anything but by-the-numbers. Not only is McTiernan a master craftsman, with a great eye for composition and a knack for careful camera movement, he is a canny storyteller. McTiernan had more ambition than your average Hollywood action director and not only knew how to strip the story to the bone into something fast paced and muscular but also brought a subversive edge to PREDATOR. McTiernan clearly wanted to elevate the action genre with his work not only with his aesthetics but also with the themes of his films. He obviously wanted to use PREDATOR to critique both the macho posturing of the genre but also to highlight the homoeroticism latent in the genre. McTiernan achieved this PREDATOR by leaning into these genre tropes, exaggerating them to the point of ridiculousness then skewering the hyper-masculine posturing typical of the Eighties action film. This meta textual element of the film and its metaphorical underpinnigs 9such as its critique of American foreign policy) raised PREDATOR above the level of ALIEN knock off that it could so easily have been. However, that isn’t to say the film is perfect. PREDATOR was only the director’s second film and McTiernan had yet to have a hit. Therefore there was a lack of trust from the studio in the relatively untested director, coupled with his own inexperience as a filmmaker. There is a tension within the film that is never quite resolved and it feels like there are two films fighting with each other. There is the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger film, with its silliness and cheesy one liners and the more ambitious, suspenseful movie the director was trying to make. Watching the film now it is the former aspect that seems most dated, in particular the A-Team style first act and set piece and moments like “Stick around”( a one liner that seems totally out of character for the taciturn Dutch.) These cheesy moments clash with McTiernan’s more elegant style and the taut atmosphere he is trying to create. PREDATOR seems now like a good attempt by a talented but inexperienced director to elevate the action genre but it doesn’t quite manage it. The film was a commercial success which allowed McTiernan another chance at his goal with 1988’S DIE HARD. This time McTiernan was given the freedom to make the fim he wanted to make and he not only delivered one of the greatest action films ever made but one that revolutionised the genre. McTiernan managed to achieve with DIE HARD all of the things he wanted to do with PREDATOR: the sharp script makes satirical points about rampant capitalism and authority, John McClane was a more human and vulnerable kind of action hero, played by Bruce Willis an actor with far more range than Schwarzenegger and visually McTiernan was able to create a new aesthetic for the action movie (helped considerably by extraordinary photography by Jan De Bont.) However, many of the ideas and visual techniques found in DIE HARD are seen in nascent form in PREDATOR.\n\nPREDATOR may not quite achieve the ambitions of the director and is a somewhat schizophrenic mix of a generic Eighties action movie and a taut, witty sci-fi thriller but it is still head and shoulders above most other action films. Thanks to John McTiernan’s atmospheric visuals, lean storytelling, impressive creature design by Stan Winston and at least some attempt to give some depth to typical monster movie, PREDATOR is a classic sci-fi action film and is intelligent enough to deserve its reputation as one of the best action movies of the Eighties."
