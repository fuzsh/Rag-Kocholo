        "text": "Don't let this fact get your hopes up, but NBC didn't have permission from the subject for The Jesse Ventura Story.\n\nThat's because this 120-minute unauthorized biopic is about as close to a TV love letter as you'll find on the outspoken ex-wrestler, ex-actor, ex-talk radio personality-turned governor.\n\nAnd the movie's star, Mims, Fla., homeboy Nils Allen Stewart, knows it.\n\n\"He couldn't have paid to have a better script written for him than this,\" said Stewart, who plays Ventura, from his days as a 22-year-old Navy SEAL to his election as governor of Minnesota at age 47.\n\n\"Officially, (Ventura) might say some of the things are inaccurate . . . But I think, privately, he'll put his feet up, (watch it) and wind up liking it.\"\n\nOn its face, shoehorning Ventura's life into a TV movie seems a futile task. After all, this is a guy who trained as a Navy SEAL, fought in the Vietnam War and served as a bodyguard to the Rolling Stones before taking the jobs that brought his greatest fame.\n\nSo it's no surprise that the NBC movie's greatest weakness is a lack of depth, with wafer-thin characters and a pace too fast for sophisticated storytelling.\n\nFor those who must know details, The Jesse Ventura Story outlines the experiences that supposedly shaped Minnesota's musclebound chief executive _ from a boyhood love of professional wrestling to a lifelong quest for approval from his loving, if laconic, dad.\n\nAlong the way, Jim Janos of South Minneapolis becomes Jesse Ventura _ first, a wrestler known for his love of the spotlight and bad-boy behavior, later a politician known for his love of the spotlight and bad-boy behavior.\n\nIf it sounds like a thinly veiled ripoff of two-dozen TV movies that have come before, that's because it is.\n\nIt doesn't help that Stewart _ who filmed this $3.6-million movie in March and April from a quickie script written after Ventura was elected governor _ cuts a much lower-key figure than the high-energy, outspoken man he plays on TV.\n\nMaybe it's Stewart's laid-back style. Or a stilted _ some might say wooden _ acting technique.\n\nEither way, the Jesse Ventura you'll see on NBC is no cardboard cut-out imitation. No half-hearted attempts are made to cop Ventura's gruff Midwestern twang or his oversize mannerisms.\n\nStewart, who competed in the late' 80s during International Wrestling Federation bouts telecast from Universal Studios in Orlando, didn't even bother studying biography materials on the star.\n\n\"They were adamant about me not being a clone,\" he adds of the film's executive producers, TV movie veteran Bruce Sallan and Dr. Doolittle producer John Davis _ who also produced Predator, the action movie that featured Ventura and pal Arnold Schwartzenegger.\n\n\"My main objective in the story is to (get) people to like me _ or at least like the character,\" he adds.\n\nTapping a technique also seen in HBO's 1997 biopic on boxing promoter Don King, Stewart's Ventura narrates the entire story, appearing as a suit-and-tie clad governor in a variety of settings _ from the hospital in which Ventura recovered from a blood clot that ended his wrestling career to the jungles of Vietnam.\n\nBut, unable to evoke Ventura's larger-than-life charisma, Stewart's effort to play the generic bad guy in most every World Wrestling Federation matchup falls flat.\n\nAfter an hour or so watching The Jesse Ventura Story, you'll have no idea how this guy drew so many wrestling fans or inspired Minnesota voters _ a problem guaranteed to put any biopic about Ventura down for the count.\n\nAt a glance\n\nThe Jesse Ventura Story airs at 9 p.m. tonight on WFLA-Ch. 8.\n\nGrade: D\n\nRating: TV-14"
