        "text": "When Prey first released on Hulu, I heard nothing, but good things about the movie. I was sick a few weeks ago, so I found plenty of time to sit on the couch, isolate, and watch movies. I wanted to watch Prey, but then I decided that I should just do a Predator marathon, so I could watch all the movies in the franchise which I think would make watching Prey that much better. Predator is a classic and I found it to still be enjoyable to watch years later.\n\nFor those who have never watched Predator, Predator stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Major Alan Dutch who is called into action along with his rescue team. Alan reunites with a former colleague, Al Dillon (Rest in Peace Carl Weathers!) who agrees to help assist. When Alan and his team investigate, they realize Al lied to them about their mission. In the meantime, a creature is shown in the trees, stalking Alan’s team. After killing Billy (played by Sonny Landham), Alan realizes they are being hunted and what’s hunting them may not be human.\n\nI think there are a lot of reasons that Predator is still highly regarded, but I think what I like the most is how Predator capitalizes on the fear of the unknown. The idea that something is stalking their group and not feeling confident that this being is human, that’s scary. Combining that with being in unfamiliar territory and not being able to see the creature, it’s unsettling. I think the tone of the film changes when Blain Cooper (played by Jesse Ventura) is killed because the Predator’s plasma cannon is so powerful. While Predator is considered a sci-fi film, I think an argument can be made that Predator could be a horror film too.\n\nAnother thing that I liked about Predator was how all the characters stood out from each other. Alan is clearly the protagonist and the hero of the story. Al is shady but then ends up sacrificing himself to help Mac (played by Bill Duke). Speaking of Mac, I think his reactions to losing Blain are completely valid. Mac starts to lose it a bit and I thought that this was not only realistic but also added to the horror element of the film. I’d also argue that Rich Hawkins (played by Shane Black) was the wisest one in the group because he put it together first that whatever is stalking them might not be from Earth. I think it’s easy for a group of characters to blend together and come across as forgettable, but Predator doesn’t fall into that.\n\nWatching Predator so many years later, I think it’s interesting. The first thing I always laugh at is how Jesse Ventura was once our governor which feels like such a Minnesotan thing to say, but I can’t help it. In many ways, Predator is a product of its time. There are a few slurs thrown in by some of Alan’s men and one of the men makes an off-color joke about going down on his girlfriend and her vagina. The script for Predator wouldn’t fly in today’s society, which I think shows how much we have grown. We still have a ways to go, but still.\n\nI’m looking forward to watching the other Predator films because honestly, I don’t think I have seen any of them. Predator can be streamed to watch on Hulu."
