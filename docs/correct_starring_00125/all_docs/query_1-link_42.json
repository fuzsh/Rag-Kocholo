        "text": "Jesse Ventura's role alongside action star Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1987 science-fiction blockbuster, Predator, cemented Ventura's career as a Hollywood film actor. The film features Ventura as Blain, a member of Schwarzenegger's commando unit sent to a Central American jungle to take out a gun-running gang. When the commandos are picked off one by one by the extraterrestrial predator of the film's title, Blain and his remaining comrades are drawn into the fight of their lives, their original mission forgotten. Roger Ebert, writing on the Chicago Sun-Times Web site, called the film \"a slick, high-energy action picture.\""
