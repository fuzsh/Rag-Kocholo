Predator was Ventura's first film role. Other notable films Ventura has appeared in include The Running Man (1987), Demolition Man (1993) and Batman & Robin (1997).\n\nVentura was part of the U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team 12 during the Vietnam War and received a Vietnam Service Medal, although he has since disclosed that he did not see combat.[2] Following his military service, he went on to embark on a professional wrestling career lasting from 1975 to 1986. There, he claimed the ring name Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura. In addition, Ventura has also had a career in politics; he served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003.[3]\n\nOn television, Ventura is perhaps best-known for hosting the show Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura (2009-2012), where he and his team of investigators attempt to unravel modern-day conspiracy theories.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Notes 1987 Predator The Running Man With Mar√≠a Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Thomas Rosales, Jr., Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sven-Ole Thorsen 1989 Thunderground No Holds Barred With Diana James 1990 Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe With Sven-Ole Thorsen 1991 Ricochet With Alex Chapman, George Christy, Tom Finnegan, Jim Ishida and Thomas Rosales, Jr. 1993 Demolition Man With Alex Chapman, Steve Kahan, Henry Kingi, Thomas Rosales, Jr. and Pat Skipper 1994 Major League II 1997 Batman & Robin With William H.
