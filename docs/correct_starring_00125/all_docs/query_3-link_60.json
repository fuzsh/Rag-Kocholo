        "text": "When it comes to having a roster of some of the most well-conditioned, shredded athletes in the world, the WWE is at the top of the charts. While most WWE superstars remain in the squared-circle as pro wrestlers, many of its biggest stars over the years have shown they are multifaceted talents, working as actors in some of the Hollywood’s biggest movies.\n\nOf all the WWE superstars who have made the evolution, no one has been more successful than Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. After becoming one of the most popular wrestlers in the world, Johnson has now become the highest-paid actor on the planet. From major movie franchises like the Fast & Furious—and his new spinoff Hobbs & Shaw—and the Jumanji films to original action flicks like Skyscraper, Rampage, and San Andreas, Johnson has the power to make any movie happen. On top of acting, he’s flexed his power into producing with his Seven Bucks Production company, which has branches in TV, films, video games, internet videos, and much more. Not bad for a guy who once only had “seven bucks” in his pocket before breaking big. But Johnson isn’t the only massive success to come out of the WWE.\n\nJohn Cena has been closely following Johnson’s footsteps, even joining the Fast & Furious franchise for the ninth film, F9, which will be released in 2021. On top of that, Cena starred in the Transformers franchise with his role in Bumblebee and showed off his range by flexing his comedic chops in films like Blockers and Trainwreck.\n\nDave Bautista has carved out his own successful run in Hollywood, parlaying his WWE stardom into a major role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing Drax in the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers films and a Bond villain in Spectre. But like both Cena and Johnson, Bautista has shown that he’s more than just an action star, appearing in sci-fi movies like Blade Runner 2049 and Dune, as well as comedic films like Stuber and My Spy.\n\nHere are 10 WWE performers who have turned in great acting careers, from the modern-day to the originals."
