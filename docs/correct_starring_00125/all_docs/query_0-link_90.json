        "text": "Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is undoubtedly a jack of all trades. Throughout his career, Schwarzenegger has proved his mettle not only in acting but in bodybuilding and politics as well. Today, the actor is a reputed figure in the film industry with a massive fanbase. However, little do his fans know that he was once a big prankster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the initial phase of his career, the actor used to play petty tricks on his peers, and he often succeeded in them. Previously, while filming his 90s film Predator, he played a trick on his co-star, Jesse Ventura that won him a bet. According to Schwarzenegger his harmless trick actually boasted his co-star’s ego a bit when he lied about his arm size.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger played a trick on his co-star that boasted his ego\n\nDuring the initial phase of his career, young Arnold Schwarzenegger was a full-on, energy-packed human who, apart from acting and bodybuilding, spent his time playing tricks with his fellow actors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the filming of his 1987 film, Predator, the actor played a trick on his co-star Jesse Ventura, which initially gave a little boost to his ego, but later when he got to know about Schwarzenegger’s trick, his ego was brought to his knees.\n\nSince the film starred actors like Schwarzenegger and Ventura, who are still known for their impressive physiques, it’s quite obvious that there must have been some internal rivalry between the co-stars.\n\nDuring a behind-the-scenes video, Schwarzenegger shared how he tricked his co-star, Ventura into believing that his arm size was smaller than Ventura’s. The actor said,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The biggest thrill for me was when we hit wardrobe and I happened to view Arnold’s wardrobe tape, and when my arms taped out one inch bigger than Mr. Olympia’s, that made Jesse Ventura feel pretty good.”\n\nKnown for his psychological tricks, Schwarzenegger created this scenario where he asked the Wardrobe department to lie about his arm size, just to win a bet from Ventura. Ventura was duped into believing his arm size was bigger than Schwarzenegger’s, which boosted his ego for a short time.\n\nAlso Read: Despite Being a 6 ft 2 in Austrian Giant, Arnold Schwarzenegger Was Rejected for Being Too Short for Marvel Role That’s Now a $1.3B Franchise\n\nLittle did he know, Schwarzenegger was setting a trap for him. When he approached Schwarzenegger, to show off a little about his supposedly bigger arm, he was confronted with a harsh reality. The Terminator actor recalled,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“He came to the gym two days later and says, “You know something, Arnold, we should measure our arms. Who has bigger arms?” I said, of course, we should. Let’s bet a bottle of champagne. He said, of course, we should. And then we measured and my arm was three inches bigger than his.”\n\nPoor Ventura lost a bet and had to buy Schwarzenegger a bottle of champagne.\n\nAlso Read: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s All 5 Kids and Who Has the Closest Physique to 7x Mr. Olympia Winner\n\nSylvester Stallone also became a victim of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s pranks\n\nToday Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger share a great bond, however, this narrative wasn’t the same a few years back. Since both actors are big names in the film industry, there was a time when they considered themselves nothing less than a rival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to The Things, their rivalry once took an intense turn when Schwarzenegger tricked Stallone into appearing in two films that poorly failed at the box office.\n\nHowever, tricking Stallone was a piece of cake for Schwarzenegger, as all he had to do was convince him that he was interested in those two projects. Schwarzenegger’s supposed inclination towards those two films was enough to entice Stallone to opt for the role.\n\nAlso Read: “I was poor because I didn’t have anything”: Arnold Schwarzenegger Felt He Was Rich Even When He Didn’t Have Any TV or Refrigerator\n\nAdvertisement"
