        "text": "Get to the convention! There was a mini Predator reunion over the weekend as Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura met up at a convention, bringing together two of the key cast members of the fan favorite action flick. If only we could have gotten Bill Duke and that other guy…\n\nVentura — who played minigun-lovin’ Blain Cooper in Predator — plugged the event on Facebook, writing, “Come on down to the Mad Monster Party in Atlanta! I’ll be here today and tomorrow signing autographs and taking pictures with all the fans. Plus it’s a Predator reunion! Got to see Carl Weathers.” Weathers played Al Dillon (you son of a bitch!).\n\nThe original Predator, which came out in 1987, spawned a full-blown franchise for better or worse, with the first sequel, Predator 2, arriving in 1990. The series took a lengthy break before crossovers Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) and eventually returning to standalone fare Predators (2010), The Predator (2018) and last year’s Prey. Regarding that movie – which stands as the best-reviewed of the bunch – Jesse Ventura called it a “great, great, film,” particularly praising director Dan Tratchtenberg and the performances of Amber Midthunder and Dane DiLiegro, saying, “It is not an easy task following the late great Kevin Peter Hall’s performance as the Predator. My hat off to you. Fantastic job.”\n\nMeanwhile, Predator star Jesse Ventura may not have time to bleed but he does have time for Cameos, something he also promoted on his Facebook page recently. So if you want a personalized message from Ventura (…), you can scrounge up $150 and click the “Wrestlers” tab…As for Carl Weathers, the actor most recently turned up as Greef Karga in The Mandalorian, a performance that earned him his first-ever Emmy nomination, in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor…Did the nominating committee not see Arrested Development?!\n\nPredator grossed just under $60 million domestically and a shade under $100 million worldwide during its run after a $12 million opening weekend, making it Arnold Schwarzegger’s biggest movie up to that point.\n\nWhat is your favorite scene from Predator?
