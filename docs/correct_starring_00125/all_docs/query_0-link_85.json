        "text": "A movie adaptation of the popular video game franchise. A ragtag group of fighters are selected to defend Earth from being conquered by warriors from another dimension.\n\nA general from the invading forces is portrayed by former WWE Superstar Nathan Jones. The Colossus from Boggo Road is involved in a couple of big action scenes where he wields a giant sledgehammer to batter his foes.\n\nFeatured Wrestler:\n\nNathan Jones as Reiko\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n3/5 boys and a girl with a dragon tattoo\n\nA fairly faithful adaptation that tries to re-create the beat ‘em up format of the game and includes a lot of game references without ever feeling too forced. The former WWA champion’s size helps him look dominating enough but he does feel like a hapless giant, his death scene however is memorably gory.\n\nA highly stylized gothic retelling of the Little Red Riding Hood fairly tale about a girl why becomes the prey of a wolf on whilst visiting her grandmother.\n\nWorld of Sport veteran Leon Arras appearance as the father of a boy who’ll go to any lengths to woo the young heroin.\n\nFeatured Wrestler:\n\nLeon Arras/Brian Glover as Amarous Boy’s Father\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n2.5 out of 5 werewolves\n\nA very stylish movie with lots of very artistic flourishes and the inclusion of werewolves instead of the traditional wolves is a nice addition. However, it’s fairly dull and plodding. The Man From Paris steals every scene he’s in as ever but its a relatively small role so alone isn’t enough to entice people to watch.\n\nA legacy sequel to the fish out of water action comedy franchise about a street wise detective solving crimes whilst visiting the more glamorous Beverly Hills District. In this 4th movie corrupt police officers try intimidating his estranged daughter after she comes to the defence of one of their patsies.\n\nDuring one interrogation scene, the criminal can be seen watching wrestling on a portable TV in the background. The footage on screen is obscured and distant so is hard to work out but it appeara to be a tag team match and looks like it could be from 80s WCW, a cross body and a drop kick can be seen in 2 very brief clips.\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n3.5 out of 5 Rambo knives\n\nEddie Murphy doesn’t appear to have missed a beat in the 30 years since the previous installment and while the move doesn’t live up the the expectations of the original it is a fine addition to the series. The wrestling connection is a blink and miss it affair and adds nothing to the movie.\n\nFormer ECW, Impact, AAA and Lucha Underground Champion John Morrison stars as a reality TV bounty hunter who travels to Mexico to capture a drug kingpin’s son and save his ailing show.\n\nThe Shaman of Sexy is involved in a lot of action sequences where he does a lot of his own stunts and shows off a lot of his parcore skills.\n\nOne of his teammates is portrayed by former UFC lightheavyweight champion and ome time TNA Wrestler Quinton “Rampage” Jackson who spends most of the film behind a desk but does also unleash a cheeky Randy Savage impression at one point.\n\nThroughout the movie there are clips of celebrities being apprehended by Boone amongst these is Tiny Lister who previously wrestled as Zeus to promote No Holds Barred, his movie with Hulk Hogan. During the end credits Rampage and JoMo are shown apprehending former WWE tag team champion Chavo Guerrero.\n\nFeatured Wrestlers:\n\nJohn Morrison as Boone\n\nQuinton Jackson as Jackson\n\nChavo Guerrero Jr as himself\n\nTiny Lister as himself\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n3.5 out of 5 sleeper holds\n\nA fun parody on the successful Dog: The Bounty Hunter series whilst simultaneously being its own thing. The Guru of Greatness is a great lead and is both comical and kickass in equal measure and is able to portray a self obsessed TV star perfectly.\n\nA low budget and not very subtle Charlie’s Angels parody about a trio of alien shape shifters who land on Earth to be its protectors and stunt performers.\n\nAn escaped alien convict also lands on Earth with the aim of building a machine that could destroy it. This villainous maniac is portrayed by The 9th Wonder of the World Chyna.\n\nFeatured Wrestler:\n\nChyna as Rex\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n2 out of 5 Whorizon phones\n\nThe former WWF Intercontinental cha.pion is excellent as the comedically over the top evil mastermind but other than that this film is a dud, the jokes are unoriginal the cinematography is bizarre at times and ultimately its just not very funny.\n\nA top government agent, who just happens to be a small dog with a secret identity has to rescue the woman who invented the technology that enables him to talk to humans.\n\nFormer ECW champion Tommy Dreamer stars as one of the canine agents spy team, the majority of his screen time is taken up with him giving cheesy one liners and pulling elaborate faces but he does also get into a fight late in the movie where he easily takes out a hired guard twice, once with a clothesline. The aforementioned guard is played by 3 time Ring Of Honor 6 Man Tag Team Champion Vinny Marseglia.\n\nFeatured Wrestlers:\n\nTommy Dreamer as Agent Hawk\n\nVinny Marseglia as Nicky\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n2.5 out of 5 gummy worms\n\nA silly children’s romp with a ridiculous premise but is a lot of fun and if your going to watch a talking dog film with your kids you can do a lit worse than this. It’s cool to see The Innovator of Violence in such a goofy role and while is acting is incredibly over the top so is everyone else’s in the movie, it is good to see him facing off against the former Kingdom member though.\n\nThis installment of the continuing adventures of a group of street racers turned thieves turned secret agents, the gang travel across the globe to prevent terrorists collecting the components that will help them controll all of Earth’s satellites.\n\nFormer WWE Champion John Cena takes a starring role as the movie’s lead’s estranged brother and rival.\n\nFeatured Wrestler:\n\nJohn Cena as Jakob/Jake Toretto\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n2.5 out of 5 returning characters\n\nThis series has always required a lot of suspension of belief but this film really stretches that concept to its limits with some unrealistic CGI stunts, James Bond style gadgets and a sports car modified to fly in space. The Champ plays a good villain with a sympathetic enough back story to allow his character to be redeemable.\n\nFormer WWE Champion Batista reprises his role as Drax the Destroyer in a Christmas special based on the Marvel sci-fi franchise. The hero’s try to provide Star Lord with the greatest Christmas even by bringing him the man he considers Earth’s greatest hero, Kevin Bacon.\n\nFeatured Wrestler:\n\nBatista as Drax\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n5 out of 5 funny little guys\n\nA really funny and heartwarming tale that’s a fine addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy series and holiday season viewing schedules. The Animal takes a lead role in the first half and excels in a comedy role.\n\nThe 4th movie in the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe to focus on the adventures of Norse God Thor. In this movie the God of Thunder must team up with an ex partner to fight against a foe who has a God Slaying sword.\n\nIn the first act the titular hero is shown in a comedic retelling of one of his recent adventures where he has teamed up with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Amongst the ranks of the Guardians is Drax the Destroyer, who is played former WWE Champion Batista.\n\nFeatured Wrestler\n\nBatista as Drax\n\nWrestle Rating:\n\n3 out of 5 Giant screaming space goats\n\nA different take on the hero that’s a bit hit and miss in places but ultimately a quite fun movie. The Animal’s appearance is wasted as he’s a background character at most with the majority of the Guardians of the Galaxy’s interactions revolving around their leader Star Lord.\n\nThe music video for the fourth single by country music artist Sarah Darling features her playing a woman who deliberately breaks items around her house as an excuse to invite the local handyman who is portrayed by The Phenomenal AJ styles to her home.\n\nThe former NWA, TNA and WWE Champion puts in a very cheesy performance but one that is perfect for the tone of the video.\n\nFeatured Wrestler:\n\nAJ Styles as Mr. Handy"
