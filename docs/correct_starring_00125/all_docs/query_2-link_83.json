Plans to prosper you, to give you hope and a future, declares the Lord” — reads Jeremiah 29:11.

In his place, the party appointed stand-up comedian and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann to articulate its views in the lower House.\n\nSangrur MP Bhagwant Mann replaces Dharam Vira Gandhi as AAP leader in Lok Sabha\n\nTNN / Apr 22, 2015, 07:20 (IST)\n\nThe Patiala MP gave considerable grief to Arvind Kejriwal and his aides when he endorsed the version of Bhushan and Yadav that the dominant faction resorted to strong-arm methods to intimidate dissidents and stifle their protest."
