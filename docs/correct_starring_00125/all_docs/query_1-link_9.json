Free shipping for many products!\n\nNot entirely sure where to start, so I'll start by giving home states.\n\nSonny Landham actually tried running for Governor of Kentucky.\n\nCarl Weathers, I'm not sure why but I think his best chance would be in Louisiana where he grew up.\n\nRichard Chaves similarly would probably do well in Florida.\n\nBill Duke, I'm going to suggest Massachusetts for him as it's where he went to college.\n\nShane Black, I'm going to suggest Pennsylvania which is again where he grew up.\n\nAs mentioned before, Sonny Landham did try to run for office in Kentucky a few times and may be the easiest to get elected. Maybe have him run for Governor of Kentucky earlier than he did, in 1995 where Paul Patton barely won the election. If Landham can avoid too many gaffes and take advantage of Republican discontent with Clinton, he may be able to squeak out a win there. Whether he wins re-election or not is probably up for debate, but he'd be elected.\n\nLooking into Carl Weathers, I can't quite place his political views but he did seem to be for getting out the vote, etc. I think he could run either in Louisiana (in the 90s) or in California at some point and potentially do well. If LO, he may be limited to just being in the House though.\n\nAs for Bill Duke, Richard Chaves, and Shane Black? I'm.. not too sure.\n\nDuke currently lives in California (according to Wikipedia) but is from New York, maybe for some reason or another he runs for Governor of NY in 2006 or 2010? He'd definitely be a longshot but could be an interesting timeline. I'm not sure when he moved to California, but he could also run for Governor there sometime. Again, House Seat is also possible, or maybe a Senate seat in either state.\n\nChaves is from Florida, and I'm not really sure what his politics would be. I guess maybe he could run as a Crist type independent (either for the GOP or the Dems) and win sometime in the 2000s though I don't know if he could win re-election unless he veers to the Right in the 2010s.\n\nBlack is from Pennsylvania but also lived in California. I have no idea his politics either, though my gut is saying that he may be more suitable for Pennsylvania, though of course could maybe get a House seat in Cali.\n\nI'll be honest, most of my thoughts primarily are gut feelings outside of Landham and Weathers, who I think both have the best shots at actually being elected."
