Rutgers Life Still OK: Poll By BILL NEWCOTT Most Rutgers University students at the New Brunswick campuses actually like pursuing higher education despite the drastic budget cuts, a poll released yesterday shows. Akhee Saliba, the student complaints officer who conducted the poll of 640 students, reported that 92.5% of all students said either that campus life was enjoyable "some of the time" or "most of the time." The Eagleton Institute of Political Science at Douglass College took the survey .

Seek Problem Pattern Kenneth Wheeler, university provost, said he was pleased with the results but warned that such areas as student services still needed improvement. "This poll will help determine patterns of problems facing students," Wheeler said. "The students seem content, but we don't want to project the image that they are all happy as clams We have a lot of work ahead of us as a result of this poll." Responding students also voiced concern about rising tuition costs and the need for improved security on campus. IN MEMORIAM BARRETO 0-Kathryn. To Mom: Memories and love always .
