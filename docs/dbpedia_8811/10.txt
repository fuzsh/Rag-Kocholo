1965: WILLIAM ZECKENDORF’S FIRM THROWN INTO BANKRUPTCY

The weakened real estate empire of one of Manhattan’s leading property owners and developers, William Zeckendorf Sr., was forced into involuntary bankruptcy 45 years ago this month.

Webb & Knapp — which Zeckendorf controlled as president, chairman of the board and majority stockholder — had been losing day-to-day control of properties for months and had been paying creditors late. The flamboyant dealmaker who backed dozens of Broadway plays and frequented nightclubs formally lost control of the company on May 18, 1965, when a federal bankruptcy court named a trustee to take over operations.

Zeckendorf, who was 59 at the time, had built the Midtown-based firm into a national powerhouse, at times owning the Chrysler and Graybar buildings and developing L’Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C., and Century City in Los Angeles.

But Webb & Knapp was highly leveraged with unsupportable debt. And Marine Midland Trust, one of the company’s creditors, filed in federal court to force Webb & Knapp into bankruptcy, seeking to protect its $4.3 million in unsecured debt that it feared it would lose if other lenders filed first.

The realty empire had been unraveling for more than a year. Owners of the Commodore and Astor hotels in Manhattan evicted Zeckendorf affiliates as operators within the previous 12 months and were seeking millions of dollars in judgments.

In 1968, Zeckendorf filed for personal bankruptcy, showing assets of $1.9 million and debts of $79 million, nearly all derived from his ownership of Webb & Knapp. He died in September 1976 at the age of 71.
