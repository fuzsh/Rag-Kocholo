        "text": "Chinese-born American architect I.M. Pei has died at the age of 102. Pei was credited for designs including the National Gallery of Art's East Building in Washington, the Louvre's controversial Glass Pyramid in Paris, the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.\n\nPei's love of architecture began in 1935, when he made the decision to study the subject in the United States. He attended the University of Pennsylvania and earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from MIT as well as a master's from Harvard University, where he then served as an assistant professor of architecture. His wife, Eileen Pei, along with their sons, Chien Chung (Didi) Pei and Li Chung (Sandi) Pei, also studied at Harvard's Graduate School of Design.\n\nPei worked briefly for the U.S. National Defense Research Committee near the end of the second World War. He honed his craft working for American real estate developer William Zeckendorf and in 1955, Pei went on to found his own his architecture firm, I. M. Pei & Associates, which is currently known as Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. Pei won the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 1983, and he was also the recipient of the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal.\n\nHe once told The Guardian: \"As a young man, of course I had been looking for something new, even revolutionary. I knew what Le Corbusier was doing. I wanted to go his way. But, after some years, I began to think differently. I became interested in a modern architecture that made connections to place, history and ­nature. Modern architecture needed to be part of an evolutionary, not a ­revolutionary, process.\n\nIn recognition of Pei's impressive contributions to the architecture field, we're sharing eight of his most acclaimed designs below."
