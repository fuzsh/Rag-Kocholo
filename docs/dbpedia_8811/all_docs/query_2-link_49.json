        "text": "I had lunch with Sam Zell. We talked for over 2 hours. I could ask him any question I wanted. At 81 he is still *ferociously* intelligent and completely authentic. Here are 7 key ideas I learned from our lunch: 1. Go for freedom Freedom allows you to control what you work on. If you control what you work on, you can work on what you love. If you love it you will do it for a long time. If you do it for a long time you will get really good at it. Money will come as a result. 2. It's extremely important to be obsessive about understanding everything you possibly can about your craft. Consider it an obligation. Hold yourself accountable. Keep learning over time. Study the history and know the pioneers. — Bill Gurley Sam Zell has been doing this for 60 years. Every time I mentioned some obscure figure from the history of business Sam -knew who the person was -knew what company they had built -and had read their biography Every. Single. Time. He has all this information stored in his head. He never looked at any notes or had to Google anything. It was all in his brain. 3. The right information is priceless It can save your life (the right information helped Sam’s family escape the Nazis) and help you build a wonderful business (Sam used an idea he found in William Zeckendorf’s autobiography in both his real estate and business career) 4. Have fun You’d be surprised how many rich people don’t have any fun. Don’t be like these people. Sam is still curious and is seeking adventures all over the world. 5. You have an obligation to share what you have learned Sam flies all over the world to talk to other entrepreneurs (at his expense!) just to teach everything he has learned. He considers it an obligation to pass knowledge onto the next generations. 6. When you have a few decades of experience —write an autobiography Sam hated writing his. It was difficult. But it is one of the best things he ever did. His favorite day of the week is Monday. That is the day Sam and his team go over the messages people send Sam telling him how his book changed their life. He finds this deeply satisfying. You will too. 7. If you love what you do the only exit strategy is death Sam will be doing deals, building businesses, and sharing everything he learned until he dies. - - - - “People sometimes ask me when I’ll retire. Retire from what? I love what I do.” — Sam Zell - - - - A scene from our lunch: David: I bought Zeckendorf’s book because you mentioned reading it in your autobiography Sam Zell: Did you read it? David: Not yet Sam Zell: READ IT! David: Yes sir The first 30 minutes of episode 298 is what I learned from having lunch with Sam Zell. I go into a lot more detail than I can fit here. The rest of the episode is what I learned from reading the book Sam Zell told me to read. You can listen in any podcast player right now: https://lnkd.in/e6UvvwYi!"
