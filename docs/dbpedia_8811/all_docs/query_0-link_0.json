        "text": "“That’s him! Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod!”\n\nWe were cruising the streets of Tijuana in August 2005, looking for a man named Stephen Michael Cohen, a fugitive from American justice, a lifelong thief and a silver-tongued con artist so gifted that even his victims and the lawmen who have pursued him for 30 years admire him.\n\nThe man shouting in a high-pitched voice was one of those victims — Gary Kremen, a 42-year-old millionaire who, 11 years ago, had been the mark in a bold and elaborate scheme in which Cohen took from him the most valuable domain name on the Internet, Sex.com. Kremen has been pursuing Cohen for more than a decade, first trying to get his property back, then seeking to enforce a federal order that would return to him $65 million in lost proceeds from the website. In the process, Kremen spent almost everything he had — about $5 million — on lawyers.\n\nHands on the wheel, head swiveling, face reddening, Kremen kept on shouting as he swerved to the curb. “Get out of the car!” he screeched. “Get out! Go talk to him!”\n\nKremen’s eyes were wild. He hadn’t seen Cohen face-to-face in more than four years, not since the day they had first met, at a legal deposition, and failed to settle their differences. Kremen wanted a confrontation but clearly didn’t want any part of it himself. That was to be my job.\n\nAcross four lanes of Tijuana traffic, outside a black-glass office building and standing next to a soccer-mom-style Honda CR-V was a pasty guy in dumpy jeans and a Beverly Hills Polo Club T-shirt, carrying two cell phones on his hip. Cell phones, I already knew, were his weapon of choice.\n\n“Steve Cohen?” I asked as I trotted up to him, notepad in one hand, the other outstretched. He seemed to flinch, and his eyes swept the street as he tentatively shook my hand. Walking into a cloud of his cologne, I studied the man who’d been avoiding me with elaborate lies. When we’d spoken a few days earlier, he’d claimed he was in Monte Carlo running a casino, extending credit to high rollers, getting his private Citation jet fueled up for a jaunt.\n\n“Uh, what are you doing here?” he asked, struggling for composure. Cohen, 57, looked as unimpressive as a man can look and sounded very little like a canny international fugitive.\n\nFor the next 10 minutes I peppered him with questions, sure that I was safe because Kremen and a private investigator he had brought along were nearby in a Grand Cherokee. But then Cohen recovered and gradually nudged me into the building, guiding me into a cracked-leather chair in a dimly lit conference room in the office of his attorney, Gustavo Cortes Carbajal, known in Tijuana as El Sapo, the Toad.\n\nThe Toad’s hand gripped my shoulder, his pockmarked face inches from mine. “Mi casa es su casa,” he said. “Please don’t steal anything.” Cohen, the world-class thief, seemed to smirk too. The fear was gone, the color back in his face. The con man’s vaunted confidence returned, and his words poured out in a honeyed flood. “I don’t live here. I live in Europe,” he said. “I’m normally in Europe. Tell Kremen you saw me. No, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t. I don’t want my whereabouts known to him. The days between Kremen and me are totally over. Kremen spends his life on this. I don’t have the time and energy. If the Supreme Court rules in my favor, I’ll give you the exclusive.”\n\nIn the middle of his speech, I felt my cell phone vibrate with a text message from Kremen: cohen shooting in black building.\n\nJarred, confused and certain I’d hear nothing more of value from Cohen, I got out of there as fast as I could. Back in Kremen’s Jeep, I asked what the message was all about.\n\n“Just fucking with you,” Kremen said.\n\nWhen the history of the Internet is written, the taking of Sex.com will be one of its most entertaining chapters, not just because it was the biggest theft in Internet history but because the decadelong tragicomedy established a simple but vital legal principle: Internet domain names, unlike song titles but like songs, are property subject to conversion; in other words, they can be stolen. Open a property-law book. It’s in there.\n\nThat such an important precedent arose from a legal spit-ball fight between two social misfits like Cohen and Kremen is but one of the ironies here. Aside from the law and the vast sums involved, the real story is the human one, with all the complexity and confusion that color relationships. This was the greatest duel ever fought on the world’s newest lawless frontier, once upon a time out there in the ever-morphing ether of cyberspace, the ultimate morals-free zone.\n\nKremen and Cohen, white hat and black hat, turned out to be as similar as they are different, not just brilliant, pudgy nerds, not just multitasking, tech-obsessed, stay-up-all-night geeks with the ambition to make bags of money, but remorseless, opportunistic competitors determined not just to win but to delight in the other’s losing — and also get famous and laid in the process. “Cohen is someone just as twisted and smart as Gary,” says Sex.corn’s resident porn star, Kym Wilde, who began consulting for Kremen in 2001. “It’s what Gary admires and appreciates.”\n\nIn a phone call before we tracked him down in TJ, as the locals call his border-town home, Cohen had refused to talk about Sex.com at all. “In the circles I run in,” he said, claiming he’d invested in hotels and casinos, “sex doesn’t mix. I made millions in the sex business. I make more today. You move on.”\n\nOf course, those are all lies. For 11 years Cohen and Kremen have been locked together as tightly as Holmes and Moriarty, or the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. In the struggle both men embraced with gusto, they not only came to define each other but nearly became the same person. Cohen grew to respect Kremen’s dogged pursuit of justice; Kremen couldn’t help but emulate Cohen’s ability to damn the consequences and go full speed ahead.\n\nYet one crucial difference remains: Kremen wants to win while playing by the rules. Cohen thinks flouting them makes life worth living.\n\nKremen doesn’t look the part, but he’s some kind of genius. Born in 1963, he grew up in Skokie, Illinois, “part geek,” he says, “but definitely a hell-raiser.” We’re sitting in a conference room in Sex.com’s vast, underpopulated office in San Francisco, after a staff meeting so full of techie jargon I’ve managed to understand only that the company sells clicks: When he wrested back control of the site in 2001, Kremen turned it into a Wal-Mart of porn, but the only products he offers are links. Each time a surfer clicks on one, the target website pays Sex .com a few cents from an escrow account. The amount the target agrees to pay, which is arrived at via a complex bidding system, determines how high on the page its link appears. When a customer types, say, “redhead blow job” on the Sex .com home page, the top position naturally costs the most. But don’t search for violence, kiddie porn or bestiality. Kremen is like Wal-Mart in that way, too. He lists only what’s relatively decent to look at. As a result he has gained an oxymoronic reputation as online porn’s Mr. Clean, who neither produces nor distributes the stuff himself.\n\nPart of his story is that he has been one of the good guys since he learned his lesson as a kid. “I hung out with this group of stoner, heavy metal, break-into-the-school-and-trash-things people,” Kremen says. “We took all the money from the Coke machines. They called my parents, and they said, ‘Put him in the jail cell for 10 minutes.’ I became a good child.”\n\nHis father was a driver’s-ed instructor and ham radio operator; his mother taught accounting. It’s appropriate, then, that Kremen studied science and dreamed of money, but during his years of studying and working he also developed a pent-up desire for kink. This somewhat explains the presence of B&D star Wilde, who is not just a Sex.com consultant but also Kremen’s occasional chauffeur. Yet sex isn’t his priority: When Wilde was late picking us up from the Oakland airport, he banished her to the backseat for the trip back to San Francisco. He even ignored her when she flashed her breasts.\n\nSkokie was a competitive environment for smart kids, and Kremen learned that he liked winning. He now lives in an 8,900- square-foot, six-bedroom San Diego mansion on three acres in the city’s exclusive Rancho Santa Fe community; the home once belonged to Cohen. It’s the first and so far the only significant asset Kremen has seized from “die bad guy,” as he calls his adversary. Framed and mounted on a wall in his home are the circuit boards that made up his first hand-built computer, which won him first prize in a seventh-grade science contest. It’s next to the popcorn machine and the red London phone booth, around the corner from the server room.\n\nSomething of a nervous man, Kremen sleeps in a small bedroom down the hall from the master suite; the bad guy’s room makes him uncomfortable, he says. But as a kind of taunt, he keeps all the legal papers relating to Cohen in the big bedroom’s huge walk-in closet.\n\nKremen always wanted to make money. “I missed out on 15 years of having fun, going to rock concerts, having girlfriends,” he says. “That’s why I had my little drug crisis.” After winning back Sex.com Kremen also got into crank, or methamphetamine, which led to indulgences with porn stars, too.\n\nKremen enrolled at Northwestern in 1981, and in the era of the yuppie he fit right in with his double major in electrical engineering and business and his after-school job. “He took it on himself to be the guy with the most job offers for the highest salaries,” says Steve Laico, who has been his best friend ever since. “He got all that.” But he wasn’t averse to fun. “I don’t want to call him a crazy genius, but that’s close,” says Philip van Munching, a brewery heir who was another friend. “If he owed you $10, he’d give you a check with a statement you vehemently disagreed with written above the endorsement line, so you’d have to endorse it. It wasn’t malicious. He was contentious for fun.”\n\nAfter graduating, Kremen got a job with a government aerospace contractor, where he first encountered the earliest version of the Internet, then called Arpanet. He enrolled in Stanford business school, in Silicon Valley, to learn to be an entrepreneur, and he kept his nose to the grindstone. “I lost my virginity at a normal guy time,” he says, hesitating briefly before adding, “you know — 13 or 14. I had a girlfriend in college.” That’s right, just one. His final project was a study of bankruptcy.\n\nConcurrently, a few hours’ drive south in Orange County, his future nemesis, Cohen, was moving up the criminal food chain, with a specialty in bankruptcy fraud.\n\nCohen grew up in Van Nuys, in the San 134 Fernando Valley outside Los Angeles. When he was little, his father, a successful accountant, left home, married his secretary and moved to Beverly Hills, where he drove a Rolls, inspiring admiration and envy in his son. “His mother was sweet, but he thought she was a real nutcase,” says Susan Boydston, the third of Cohen’s five ex-wives. “She kept the house spick-and-span, and he was a rebellious slob. He tuned her out at an early age. He felt he had only himself to count on, and everyone in his path would pay.” Cohen’s ex-wives aren’t the only bitter people left in his wake. By phone from her home in Las Vegas, his mother, Renee Cohen, says, “I don’t have anything to do with him. Sorry.”\n\nCohen started cutting corners young. When he bought his mother roses at 16, she thought she’d perhaps misjudged him until the florist’s charge showed up on her credit card. High school friends remember him as abrasive and cocky, always talking about sex but never getting any, a “strange duck” who sat in the back of class with “a perennial smirk, as if he knew what was going to happen and we didn’t.”\n\n“His posture was slinky and dastardly,” says schoolmate Penny Campbell. “I know that sounds a little cartoonish, but he presented a Snidely Whiplash persona. Interesting how much a person’s body language can reveal, isn’t it?”\n\nNot long ago the fugitive Cohen reconnected by phone with another school pal and told him about his holdings in Tijuana, “his shrimp farm, his titty bar, his ISR” Steve Fischler says. “Then I heard him say, ‘Get my jet ready.’” Cohen said it was a Citation. “Then another phone rings.” Fischler next overheard half a conversation in which Cohen appeared to approve a credit line for a casino gambler. But Cohen has had the same second-line conversation almost word-for-word with others — including me when he tried to convince me he was calling from Monte Carlo, where, he claimed, he was too busy running casinos to give an interview. He was in TJ at the time.\n\nCohen married young twice and had three kids. He was later jailed for failure to support his oldest, a daughter who later became a police officer. Her father had long since turned to crime. “When I was a kid, I was involved in a multimillion-dollar check-kiting scheme,” Cohen admitted to me that day in TJ. Through the mid-1970s he was constantly in legal trouble. His first arrest was for passing bad checks — all under $300, by the way. He avoided prison by pleading guilty, but while on probation he was arrested again, for stealing a car.\n\nCharges of forgery, impersonation and grand theft followed, and in 1977 Cohen was sure he was going to jail. While awaiting sentencing, he met and married Boydston, because, she thinks now, he needed someone on the outside to protect his interests. She was in court the day his then lawyer won a venue change from L.A. County to Orange County, where Cohen lived. He was thrilled. He had a judge there “in his pocket,” Boydston says.\n\nIn the 1980s Cohen continued his life of cons. He used Boydston’s money to buy a house in a gated Orange County community and began moving in and out of businesses as fast as a three-card monte game. When the heat was on one, he’d open another: repossessions, key chains and gewgaws, computer time-shares, computer sales and import-exports; there was a liquor store, a limo service, a telephone-answering service and more — many with similar names incorporated in different states. Boydston learned later that she was listed as an officer of many of them, as were family members and friends. Evicted for nonpayment of rent, Cohen would vandalize the offices on his way out.\n\nHe had five passports, three driver’s licenses, locksmith and private investigator licenses, a plane, a sailboat, a Cadillac, a Porsche and that Rolls he’d always wanted, though it was never clear whether he owned, leased or had stolen the vehicles, and they seemed to have a habit of crashing or sinking or just disappearing — like the Rolls, which was registered in Boydston’s name. He convinced Boydston he worked with the CIA to explain his frequent trips to South and Central America, booked through his agency, Confidential Travel — all free and first-class, of course, scammed somehow with travel agent vouchers. He would actually go with friends such as Jack Brownfield, a convicted cocaine trafficker.\n\nAn electronics nut since childhood, Cohen forged documents in the garage on his own copying machine, wired his own phones and had seven lines in the bedroom where he worked all night and slept all morning behind a locked door. Cameras were trained on the door of the house for good reason. Aggrieved victims of his frauds, marshals, process servers and investigators regularly rang the bell. Boydston wasn’t allowed to answer the door or the phone. When a process server got past Boydston one day, Cohen pushed the woman down a spiral staircase and then started “slamming on me with his fists,” Boydston says.\n\nCohen’s lies were ceaseless and shameless. He told people he had studied at West Point and been an admiral, and he claimed to be one of the three Stephen M. Cohens on the California bar. He also borrowed his own lawyers’ names — making fake letterhead on his computer, often with the same telltale layout and typeface (he was lazy that way), with word-processing software he’d then return for a refund.\n\nYet despite all this, Cohen charmed powerful people — like lawyers and judges. “I don’t know what credentials he showed,” says Roger Agajanian, his first lawyer and still a friend, “but he even impersonated a judge in Colorado for several years. He let people off all the time.”\n\nCohen was sued and arrested so often that neither Agajanian nor Boydston could keep count, and he so frustrated his victims, creditors and the law by playing procedural games and hiding assets that they would eventually just give up.\n\nAlso during the 1980s Cohen discovered swinging, pressuring Boydston into wife swapping and group sex. By then she had learned he’d drained all her equity from the house and was perpetrating scams in her name. She finally divorced him in 1985 after he had sex with two of his answering-service operators in their bed. He had discovered computers, scamming to get one for free, of course, and using it to start a computer bulletin-board system for wife swappers called the French Connection. He would sit up all night, impersonating women (he posted under both Boydston’s name and that of his elder daughter) to lure men to pay a fee and join.\n\nThe company that owned the BBS was called Ynata, an acronym for “you’ll never amount to anything.” Some who know him think his mother used to say that to him and he’s been determined ever since to prove her wrong. Cohen calls it a private joke and told Boydston, who returned to her house in 1987 (though she moved into a separate bedroom), that he used it to mock his victims: When they came after him, all they’d find would amount to nothing.\n\nWhen Boydston discovered that he was still using her name, this time in bankruptcy frauds, she finally had enough. She began going through his papers, hiding incriminating documents. Unbeknownst to her, she wasn’t the only one investigating him. Gary Jones, an Orange County sheriff, had been trying to get the goods on Cohen ever since he’d gotten a tip that Cohen was stealing luxury cars from owners who were behind on their payments. He then learned Cohen was also running a fake law firm out of the towing companies he used to steal the cars. The thief who stole them for Cohen turned against him — yet he still got off.\n\nThen Jones heard about the Club. In July 1988 Cohen opened his own swingers club in a four-bedroom house cut up into crawl spaces and tunnels lined with mattresses. It was so successful that it became a neighborhood nuisance.\n\nAfter the slew of complaints reached a crescendo, Jones arrived on the Club’s doorstep in 1989. Cohen was outraged and went on TV to plead for his free-speech rights. But then he telephoned Jones, pointedly mentioning the sheriff’s wife and children by name, and threatened to buy the deed to Jones’s house, “I came unglued,” Jones says. “He made it personal, so every time that guy sneezed, I knew.”\n\nJones finally charged him with zoning and fire-code violations, but the trial ended in a hung jury. Even before that, however, Cohen’s troubles had begun to mount: He was ordered out of Boydston’s house for\n\nfailure to pay the mortgage, was arrested for hitting one of his daughters and finally came under investigation for far more serious crimes than running a sex club. He’d flimflammed his way into a bankruptcy involving an elderly woman whose son had run up large debts. Cohen impersonated an attorney, created false documents and loans to hide what he’d done and then convinced his “client” to invest her hidden assets in his shrimp farm.\n\n“They arrested him seven times,” says Boydston. Still, he was cocky and sure he’d never be convicted. When he learned one of the DA’s law clerks had failed her bar exam, he called and told her she’d passed, just to mess with her mind. Then Boydston went to the FBI with her evidence, and Cohen was on his way to federal prison for 46 months.\n\nOnce again, he married first. He met wife number four at the Club, where West Virginia-born Karon Poer was a member. Though she’d later say Cohen wore the same clothes for days, never brushed his teeth and was tight with money, she married him at a swingers convention in Las Vegas and moved into the house Cohen bought using Boydston’s money. Cohen promptly made Poer an officer of Ynata.\n\nPoer soon came to agree with Cohen’s other ex-wives. “He never wanted to do anything legal,” she said. Cohen took tens of thousands of dollars in benefits she’d received on the death of a previous husband and invested it in his own name. As the law closed in on the bankruptcy fraud, Cohen’s father dropped dead. At the funeral his family told him to leave and stay away.\n\nCohen gave Poer the French Connection to run while he was inside. But when the BBS computers disappeared, allegedly stolen by his cronies, she also had enough and sued Cohen for divorce. Cohen countersued from prison, charging she’d stolen the French Connection from him. When he got out of jail in 1995, Cohen stalked her, Poer claimed, and flattened her tires.\n\nWhen I reach her to ask about Cohen, Poer will say only, “You can kiss mah ass.”\n\nKremen spent a couple of years learning the ropes in Silicon Valley before he launched his first businesses in repackaging open-source, or free, software and then selling security programs for computers hooked up to the newborn Internet. He hardly had a personal life. “I dated a couple of girls, but I was working hard,” he says. “I wasn’t dysfunctional; I was just focused on other things.” He spent hours looking — mostly unsuccessfully — for dates in newspaper personals columns. And that led to an epiphany. “I wished there were a database you could sort through in order to find a person to marry. That’s the absolute stone-cold truth.” It didn’t exist, so he invented one.\n\nIn 1993, having noticed that more and more people had e-mail addresses, Kremen foresaw that classified advertising would eventually migrate to cyberspace, and he formed a company called Online Classifieds. He moved to San Francisco’s Haight district, hired a programmer and, in May 1994, shrewdly registered a batch of classifieds-style domain names — Jobs.com, Housing .com, Autos.com and Sex.com. Kremen also bought a defunct domain callcd Match .com for $2,500. He was going to start by selling romance. “I just have the vision,” he said. “Gonna raise venture capital.”\n\nKremen, then 32, raised $200,000, then another $2 million, then $7 million more. Two months after the launch of Match.com, when it claimed 7,000 members and a 10 percent weekly growth rate, he turned down an offer to merge with the company that became Excite.com. “I probably left $2 billion on the table there because of my ego,” he says. “I didn’t do it, because I wanted to be the CEO.” He had that title at Match.com.\n\nAlmost immediately, though, he was forced out by his investors, who didn’t think he was as good at managing businesses as he was at conceiving them. He stayed on long enough to see his stock vest and then left to develop an early form of ad- and spyware that he later sold to Microsoft for a stash of its stock. By the fall of 1995 Kremen was rubbing shoulders with some of the biggest names in the Internet business when a friend discovered, just days after it happened, that the Sex.com domain had somehow been transferred to Cohen.\n\nReleased from custody in February 1995, Cohen was determined not only to regain his footing in the cybersex business but to move to a higher level. In prison he’d met and befriended Marshall Zolp, a convicted con man, securities fraudster and expert in offshore money laundering. “Zolp was his professor,” says Luke Ford, a blogger known as the Matt Drudge of porn. “He took Cohen to school.” Back on the street, Cohen applied his new knowledge to his old interests in sex and scams.\n\nIn the early 1990s sexual images were shared over the Internet with no profits at stake. Computer programmers scanned photos from magazines and uploaded them for tech-savvy nerds to download for free. With the release of Netscape, in 1994, everything changed. The web turned as lawless as the Wild West. Fledgling entrepreneurs snatched up corporate domain names from a company called Network Solutions, which was charged with registering all legal claims to this new digital territory. Ransom was often the idea. Others saw the future in commercial porn.\n\nBy 1998 adult websites accounted for almost 70 percent of the $1.4 billion spent on online content. In 2003, when the market had grown to more than $5 billion, pornography still made up almost 60 percent of the total. In 1995 high school dropout Seth Warshavsky started the Internet Entertainment Group, an adult site that reportedly grossed $20 million in 1997, the year he marketed the renowned Pamela and Tommy Lee video.\n\nThe next year he marketed the infamous nude photos of Dr. Laura Schlessinger. He is now reportedly living in Thailand, on the run from various creditors.\n\nRon Levi, owner of Cyberotica.com, possibly the biggest early innovator, is credited with inventing pay-per-click advertising revenue in 1996, which charged for productive clicks rather than raw clicks. In the first six years of operation Levi paid out $250 million to webmasters for his advertising — and he was still a very rich man.\n\nNone of this was wasted on Cohen, who had been given a desk at a company called Midcom, a placement service for technology professionals, many with top-secret government clearance. It was owned by Barbara Cepinko, a Good Samaritan who took a chance on Cohen and would soon regret her kindness.\n\nIn the fall of 1995 Cohen launched his greatest scam. First he contacted Network Solutions, the industry administrator of domain names, and then followed up with a forged letter purportedly written by the president of Kremen’s company Online Classifieds. The letter claimed that, despite its name, Online Classifieds had no Internet access and slated that Kremen, a mere employee, had been fired. The company was therefore relinquishing its ownership of Sex.com and giving Cohen the right to take it. Cohen then forged an e-mail that gave his phone number as the one to call to confirm the transfer. With this flimsy pretext Network Solutions handed the prize to the con man.\n\nA few weeks later Cohen incorporated Sporting Houses Management and assigned the company the rights to the domain. A few months later when he offered shares to the public through a San Diego brokerage that specialized in so-called pump-and-dump penny stocks, Sporting Houses announced plans to build Wanaleiya, an X-rated Disneyland cum Club Med, a brothel resort boasting 500 on-site hookers, golf, tennis, skeet, a race track and its own airport on 300 acres, including a whorehouse called Sheri’s Ranch, outside Las Vegas. For $7,000 a weekend, clients would have all they could eat, drink, smoke and screw. But after the owner of Sheri’s told the press it was not for sale and Nevada announced it would investigate the scheme, Wanaleiya fizzled. Meanwhile one of the banks that financed Midcom cut off its credit because, unbeknownst to her, Cepinko was named in the offering as an officer of Sporting Houses.\n\nEarly in 1996 Cohen struck again. This time he transferred the license for Sex .com to a new company he’d set up in the British Virgin Islands. Sir William Douglas was named as its chairman according to corporate documents, but Douglas had nothing to do with it. The real William Douglas was the chief justice of the Barbados Supreme Court; years before he had refused to extradite England’s great train robber Ronald Biggs, who had been on the run for 16 years.\n\nWhen Network Solutions brushed off Kremen’s complaints about his stolen domain, Kremen let the matter slide for a few months, unsure if he wanted to be identified with online porn. By then Cohen had put up what’s known as a banner farm at Sex.com — a page of banner ads for porn purveyors who paid Sex.com to send surfers their way. He also posted articles such as “Adventures in Anal Erotica,” by Stephen M. Cohen.\n\nFinally furious that his domain was enriching Cohen, Kremen found a young lawyer who agreed, in 1998, to file suit against Cohen and Network Solutions. Kremen says the adversaries spoke for the first time when Cohen called him that spring, claiming to be an attorney with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and tried to scare Kremen off by saying he’d locked up the name.\n\nIn fact, Kremen couldn’t afford what he knew would be a huge legal undertaking, so it was a stroke of luck when Cohen started threatening some of the biggest names in online porn by filing infringement lawsuits against anyone using the word sex in a domain name. Kremen decided to find litigation partners who would pay for his lawyers in exchange for a share of any eventual winnings; he spammed the online porn world with e-mails seeking anyone who had been threatened by Cohen. Serge Birbrair, a Russian-born porn-traffic broker who bought clicks from small website operators and sold them in bulk to bigger ones via a domain called Sexia.com, had just been sued by Cohen.\n\n“I knew the biggest sharks on the Internet,” says Birbrair, and he called the two biggest, Levi of Cybererotica .com and Warshavsky, who agreed to bankroll Kremen in exchange for 45 percent of Sex.com.\n\nKremen’s partnership of porn moguls soon fell apart. Warshavsky got in trouble with creditors and stopped paying his share of the legal bills. Levi then dropped out of the litigation too. But Kremen had found a new weapon: Charles Carreon, a burned-out Buddhist public defender with a ponytail. Carreon was smart, scrappy and well-spoken and considered himself a warrior in search of a just cause. He decided to portray Kremen as a woman-friendly good guy who had planned to turn Sex.com into an educational website and argued that the domain was a piece of property. If Carreon won the day, he would not only stop Network Solutions from disavowing its responsibility (the company claimed domain names were services like phone numbers, not property like a car), he might pave the way to Kremen recovering the profits Cohen had siphoned off.\n\nIn 1999 Carreon won a big round in Oregon, where he convinced a three-judge panel to stay all of Cohen’s trademark cases while he rewrote Kremen’s federal complaint. He resubmitted it almost four years to the day after Cohen had snatched Sex.com. The litigation kept the case alive, albeit on life support. Kremen had no money and had agreed to pay Carreon only if he won.\n\nMeanwhile Cohen, who was making $750,000 a month from Sex.com and had almost no overhead, was revving up his lifestyle. By that time, Sex.com was making a fortune, so much that Cohen was able to hire one of the best-known trademark attorneys in the country, Leonard Duboff, a disgraced academic with a shady past. (Duboff declined to talk to playboy, calling questions about his past insulting.) Cohen also bought the mansion in Rancho Santa Fe and started moving his Sex.com proceeds offshore. He changed the name of his British Virgin Islands corporation to Ynata, began building a network that illegally sent microwave signals across the Mex-ico-California border and issued a press release claiming that he was taking over Caesars Palace.\n\nDepressed, Kremen began taking crystal mcth, which turned out to be his drug of choice. He’d begun, like “a lot of software guys,” with caffeine, then moved on to cocaine, he says. “But you can’t program on coke because it makes you too jittery.” Then someone gave him his first hit of speed. “I didn’t touch drugs until I was 35,” he says, “when someone said, ‘Take this and you can stay up all night and have fun.’” Fun was not going to clubs and meeting good-looking women, though. It was sitting at the computer for three days straight. “Which is kind of pathetic, if you think about it,” Kremen says. “Speed is a coder’s drug.”\n\nHe also began having affairs with “women who thought I was a little Internet star,” he says. “I had no time for the long chase after good-looking women, but I wouldn’t throw away low-hanging fruit.” One catch was Ana Belinda, Carreon’s doe-eyed 19-year-old daughter, who’d come to San Francisco to help with the lawsuit.\n\nOver the next year the case began to turn slowly in Kremen’s favor. When Cohen countersued for defamation, Carreon, a former insurance lawyer, had another brainstorm. If Kremen had homeowners insurance, his carrier, State Farm, would be obliged to defend him. Kremen did, State Farm agreed, and suddenly there were far more powerful lawyers and investigators in the fray, taking depositions and serving subpoenas to sniff out Cohen’s assets, perforating the corporate shells that had always protected him and analyzing how he moved his money around. “It was going to Liechtenstein in $100,000 chunks,” Carreon says.\n\nLuckily for Kremen, some of his early investments began paying off at that point and he decided to, as he puts it, “liquidate the dot-com stock I had and put it all on red to beat this guy.” When Judge James Ware, who was hearing the federal case in San Jose, granted a motion dismissing the suit against Network Solutions, Kremen q hired Jim Wagstaffe, a noted appellate attorney, to mount an appeal. Wagstaffe had a crucial advantage: Unlike Carreon, he looked like the kind of lawyer a federal 4 judge might take seriously, and he could balance out Kremen, who admits he was, at the time, in his “drug-addled state.”\n\n“Courts don’t traditionally respond well to eccentricity,” says Wagstaffe. “Gary was perceived as wacky, and the con man was seen as a businessman surrounded by men in suits. Plus he’s got Network Solutions on his side. You’re a judge. Who do you think is crazy?”\n\nKremen’s team knew where Cohen had hidden his money, but it wanted to keep Network Solutions in the case; it was the proverbial pot of gold. Wagstaffe proposed narrowing Kremen’s argument to a single issue that would give them a wedge to reopen the case against Network Solutions. So they did. In mid-2000 Wagstaffe replaced Carreon as the lead attorney and asked the court to issue a summary judgment declaring Cohen’s claim to Sex .com invalid because the letter Cohen had used to take it was an obvious forgery that couldn’t be authenticated and thus could not be introduced as evidence.\n\nCohen’s deposition, which followed that motion, was a revelation to Kremen. “I’m sitting there listening to this guy, and I knew about the criminal record,” Kremen says. As Cohen went on and on, Kremen realized “this guy’s a complete, total bullshitter. It’s all made up, and if I can just stay the course, he’s gonna lose. I’m gonna beat him. And then he panics.”\n\nCohen had fought like a legal demon to keep Kremen’s side from seeing certain of his bank records. When they were finally produced, in October 2000, he made his biggest mistake. He waltzed into the Kinko’s where they were being copied, claimed to be one of Kremen’s lawyers and, demonstrating the audacity that had brought him so far, walked out with them. When the documents finally appeared a few days later, 113 pages were missing. So Kremen’s lawyers asked if the Kinko’s had security cameras. Sure enough it did, and the tapes showed Cohen absconding with the records.\n\n“You’d think he’d at least wear a hat or something,” Kremen says.\n\n“That was it,” says Cohen’s lawyer Robert Dorband, who worked for Duboff. “I pretty much threw up my hands and said, ‘We’re in damage control.’”\n\nWagstaffe immediately made a second motion asking Ware to restrain Cohen from disposing of any of the assets they’d uncovered and ordering him to repatriate $25 million they could already prove had been sent offshore. A few days later Ware granted both of Kremen’s motions effective immediately.\n\nOn that victorious morning of November 27, 2000 Cohen was not in court. Kremen says that while he went into a courthouse bathroom to snort some celebratory coke, 138 the bad guy worked the phones and managed to send another $1.3 million out of the country before he hightailed it to Tijuana. A few months later a trial to determine damages was held in Cohen’s absence. When his lawyer claimed Cohen had failed to appear because he’d been put in jail in Mexico for trying to bring some of his ill-gotten gains back to America, Ware was outraged and issued an arrest order, citing Cohen for civil contempt. As a fugitive Cohen lost his right to present a defense. A month later Ware ruled that Cohen owed Kremen $65 million.\n\nIn the years since, as he appealed Ware’s rulings from Mexico, even taking his case to the U.S. Supreme Court and always sticking to his story that he’d been thrown into a Mexican jail for trying to repay Kremen, Cohen again resorted to playing lawyer, representing himself. And true to form, when the court finally seized his only significant asset in America, the Rancho Santa Fe mansion, Cohen filed a phony bankruptcy to disrupt the process; when that failed he had his lackeys vandalize the place. On September 10, 2001 a furious Ware ordered that the house be restored within a week. Seven days later Kremen moved in.\n\n“I bought a building in San Francisco and had all these people doing heroin, squatting with me. Eventually it comes to my dull mind that I gotta clean this up.”\n\nAlas, the Internet porn boom was over by then, and the dot-com bubble had burst. Though Kremen made $500,000 in each of the first few months he owned Sex.com, the revenue soon plunged. For a moment Cohen, who had founded Earthstation 5, a peer-to-peer file-trading network (a la Napster and Kazaa), seemed more prescient than Kremen, but the network was exposed as a fraud in The Washington Post and the geek community turned against it.\n\nDepressed because he’d won so little so far and would have to fight like crazy to get anything else, more than a little boggled by his turn from litigant to porno clickmeister and still fielding regular taunting phone calls from Cohen, Kremen went a little crazy too. He offered a reward for Cohen’s capture but withdrew it after Cohen claimed it led to a shoot-out with bounty hunters in Tijuana.\n\nKremen’s lifestyle backslid then as well. “He had to date the porn star, you know?” says Margo Evashevski, his private investigator, speaking of Wilde, who ever so briefly passed through Kremen’s bed. “I did some dabbling and tasting in the world of porn,” Kremen says. “I went to that zone, checked out the dark side, had a litde fun and came back to the business side.” His drugging escalated again, and a year later his parents induced his sister to move in with him. She redecorated the mansion, and he kicked his drug addiction and got on an even keel.\n\n“My customers are websites,” Kremen says, settling in front of one of his computers to give a lesson in online porn. Porn purveyors can log on to Sex.com and see what it costs to get a porn consumer’s attention: 18 cents for the home page, 3 cents “for the top listing on the pee page,” Kremen says. If people ask for child porn, Sex .corn’s software sends them to an anti-kiddie porn website. “No one says it’s pretty,” Kremen says, surfing to WiredPussy.com. “Water bondage? What the fuck! I don’t even know what that is.”\n\nIn January 2001 Kremen started his new life with a Fear and Loathing-like road trip with his lawyer to a Vegas online-porn trade show where he ate naked sushi and first encountered Cohen’s world. “I had fun,” he says, “but in a voyeuristic, out-of-my-league way.”\n\n“Gary had zero friends,” says Carreon. “The next day he was God.”\n\nFor a moment he lost his mind again. “I bought a building in San Francisco and had all these people doing heroin, squatting with me,” Kremen says. One of them, a carpenter, offered to build a dungeon in the basement, and Kremen agreed. “I never got to use it,” he says sheepishly. “Not my style. Some other people did, though. Eventually it comes to my dull mind that I gotta clean this up. So I spend the next two years cleaning up.”\n\nBy then Kremen had learned enough to think he might indeed have a case against Network Solutions. After an appeals court reinstated that suit in 2003, he did some math, realized he might be able to win $120 million and decided to pursue it. The defendant must have realized it too, since the company (which has been sold several times and has few connections to what it was in 1995) settled in exchange for a confidentiality agreement and a sum, a knowledgeable source says, in the neighborhood of $15 million.\n\nKremen began to feel he was free from his own form of bondage. He actually laughed when Cohen called to offer him a share of Earthstation 5 in lieu of the $65 million he owed him (which with interest has now risen to $82 million). Kremen’s learned to laugh at himself, too. Asked if he’s come to love litigation — he sues so frequently now it seems like a hobby — he replies, “They don’t teach you about the use of law at Stanford business school.”\n\nKremen moved full-time to Rancho Santa Fe, where he didn’t know any drug addicts, and he came up with the idea that Sex .com would henceforth sell dirty searches to squeaky-clean search engines. “You type in, like, ‘lesbians,’ and it’s really our listing,” he says. “We’re doing a revenue share. I want a sustainable business that, at the end of the day, someone will buy. This is about ad sales. This has nothing to do with porn.”\n\nWith perfect timing, Kym Wilde serves lunch as he says this. She keeps her clothes on this time.\n\nLast year Kremen turned his attention to Cohen’s hidden assets, and by the fall his latest push against the bad guy began to bear fruit. In San Jose Judge Ware issued a series of orders that let Kremen seize not just the U.S.-based hard assets Cohen had put in the names of his fifth ex-wife and several straw men, but even his mail, or at least whatever of it was directed to the postal drops Kremen’s team had managed to identify. His people also seized several computers that showed, among other things, that Cohen had hacked into Kremen’s voice mail more than 300 dmes.\n\nKremen’s lawyers subpoenaed and froze the bank accounts, domain names, e-mail accounts and credit cards of everyone close to Cohen, paralyzing their lives. A similar effort was under way in Mexico.\n\nStill Cohen appeared to be no less powerful on the lam. His ISP sent bandwidth by microwaves from the U.S. to Mexico and provided Internet connectivity to, among other customers, the U.S. consulate and government buildings in Tijuana.\n\nThe pressure on Cohen’s associates worked, though. Just after Kremen sued them all to recover those assets, his fifth wife Rosa’s daughter Jhuliana was arrested while driving through a special easy-clearance lane at the border near TJ with 200-plus pounds of marijuana in her car. She was served with Kremen’s suit while she was in jail. Her mother was served at Jhuliana’s arraignment. Former drug dealer Jack Brownfield, who’d remained a friend and Cohen frontman, had begun negotiations on behalf of himself, Rosa and Jhuliana to give Kremen title to Cohen’s Mexican shrimp farm, his TJ strip club, his ISP and more.\n\nAt the end of October the hunt was still on when Kremen got a lucky break. A top officer with the U.S. Marshals Service’s Mexican cross-border unit had been following the case and trading information with Kremen’s team; even though civil contempt warrants aren’t a priority, someone in the government had at last taken an interest in Cohen. When one of Kremen’s lawyers told the marshal something he didn’t know, that Cohen had divorced Rosa, the marshal quietly took action.\n\nPost-divorce, Cohen had fewer legal rights in Mexico and needed a different kind of visa to remain in TJ. Though he could have paid a lawyer $ 100 to get it for him, he characteristically chose to save the money and do it himself. When he arrived at the local immigration office for his appointment on October 27, Mexican officials arrested him and turned him over to agents of the U.S. Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs\n\nEnforcement and the marshals, who walked him across the border at 2:45 that afternoon and locked him up in the same San Diego jail as his stepdaughter.\n\nThe next day, dressed in a green prison jumpsuit, Cohen was arraigned in a wood-paneled courtroom. With a “very amused, smug, shitty-ass, you-think-you-got-me grin,” says Evashevski, who was there with Kremen’s sister, Cohen surveyed the crowd, “staring us down, looking for Gary,” who, to his obvious disappointment, was in Illinois visiting his parents.\n\nThe next step would have been a hearing 10 days later, when the government would have had to prove its man was in fact Cohen. But over the objections of the judge and oblivious to the rolling eyes of his public defender, Cohen confirmed his identity, claimed poverty and asked for a court-appointed lawyer. Then, incredibly, the con man added that since he already had another lawyer trying to settle with Kremen, he wanted to be released on bail to facilitate their talks. The judge refused and ordered Cohen’s transfer to San Jose, where he would face a choice: Repatriate $25 million of the money he’d moved offshore before 2001 or, as Kremen’s attorney Tim Dillon puts it, “rot in jail.”\n\nBut no one was ready to declare victory yet. “Cohen never stops working you, ever,” says Wagstaffe. “He thinks if he keeps talking, eventually you’ll be persuaded. Gary’s a worrier, and Cohen plays on Gary’s insecurities.” And as Wagstaffe admits, “when Kremen dies, Cohen’s name will be in his obituary. They are linked for the ages.”\n\nKremen is well aware of this. Indeed, within hours of Cohen’s arrest, Kremen said he fully expected to pick up a ringing phone and find Cohen on the other end, calling from prison just to fuck with him. In Mexico Kremen’s team has uncovered about $5 million in real property in addition to the ISP, which it thinks is a $1 million business. Millions more are hidden in Europe, the Caribbean and Vanuatu, and Kremen hopes to get some, if not all, of it. “I tell him it’s going to happen with or without lube, so lie down and get it over with,” says Kremen. “I don’t think we’ll see $82 million, but a couple million’s better than a sharp stick in the eye. Don’t you agree?”\n\nStill, Kremen’s not ready for his 11-year war with Cohen to end. “Clearly,” he says, “this story is not over.” I can’t help but think I hear relish, not dread, in his voice.\n\nTHERE’S A TV NEWS CREW LURKING IN A VAN outside Jesse and Polly Rothstein’s modern house in the bucolic burg of Purchase tonight. Across the street, two women in towering hair and Lurex sweaters twist under a car’s dome light, working their Revlon in the rearview before heading up the Rothsteins’ driveway convulsed in laughter. A sign stuck outside says this is a fund-raiser for Andy Spano, candidate to become the second-ever Democratic county executive of Westchester. It goes without saying that Spano, while an able local politician, does not ordinarily attract news crews and giggling women. Nor does another of the evening’s featured guests, Congressman Chuck Schumer, who hopes to run against Alfonse D’Amato for the Senate next year. But in the dining room, there is a man who looks positively presidential-well fed, impeccably turned out in a boxy gray suit, white shirt, brown tie, and black oxfords but with the sort of five o’clock shadow that bespeaks along day of campaigning.\n\nYears ago, studying acting with Lee Strasberg, Alec Baldwin learned how to become one with the role he was playing. Now, as he steps before the small crowd to speak, he plays the part of the crusading politician seamlessly, with real conviction. “I’m tired of Democrats being doormats,” Baldwin says, his gravelly D.J. voice filling with emotion. “If Andy Spano wins, it will send a chilling message to our opponents who think the Democrats are dead … ‘ — he pauses a beat — “under the table … flatlined. Next year, there’s a Senate race, and if we don’t put a stake in Big Al [D’Amato]’s heart, we might as well all change parties.”\n\nWhile the talk of stakes in hearts and flatlining might not be exactly the way Mario Cuomo would phrase it, the performance is undeniably compelling, and it relegates Schumer and Spano, who follow, to the roles of supporting players. Afterward, pausing briefly in the doorway Baldwin squeezes my arm with a politician’s practiced sincerity. “I’d really rather be home with my kid,” he says. But instead, at 9 P.m., he climbs into Schumer’s car and heads north to Rockland County to meet and greet and pose and speak at another fund-raiser for another Democrat running for county exec.\n\n* * *\n\nALEC BALDWIN HAS DONE SOMETHING MOST POLITICIANS ONLY dream about-he has attacked a member of the press, a video cameraman who was lying in wait as he and his wife, Kim Basinger, brought their baby daughter home from the hospital.\n\nAnd his political explorations have opened him up to new areas of conflict with the media. Every time he tries to do something good-as when a couple of weeks ago he led 250 volunteers on a sixteen-hour bus ride through pouring rain to Massachusetts to collect 8,000 signatures on petitions for a campaign-finance-reform initiative-reporters make him sound like another silly celebrity who’s in over his head. “I’m an easy target,” he’ll admit.\n\nAt first, Baldwin declined to cooperate for this article, delivering set-piece speeches about a press that refuses to take him as seriously as he takes himself. But having perhaps realized that an aspiring politician needs the press even more than an aging leading man does, he relented and, two nights before Election Day, talked with surprising candor about his long-standing aspirations to run for office. “You don’t think I’ve thought about this?” he asks. “I’ve thought about it. Is this something that I want to do? Yes. Is this something that I believe is possible? I doubt it. The men and women that run the world are in their fifties. It takes time to build that kind of thing. I’m 39.”\n\nSo the clock is ticking. Baldwin, in fact, is in the midst of a kind of mid-life crisis; he’s worried that his best movie roles might be behind him, and he doesn’t have the stomach he once did for the Hollywood rat race. Sure, he’ll be playing Macbeth at the Public in February, is in a movie co-starring Bruce Willis that’s in the can, is making several more, and may soon team up with his three acting brothers, Billy Daniel, and Stephen, for a Baldwin Western mini-series jamboree. But truth be told, Baldwin’s film career hasn’t been stellar in some time. He peaked in 1989, when he starred as lack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October. And while it hasn’t exactly been downhill from there, he has demonstrated a remarkable ability to infuriate the very powers he needs to rise to the top again. Just as the brass ring came into reach, he seemed to go off the deep end, playing the prima donna so well that instead of ending up on acting’s A-list, he was blacklisted by such minor movie players as the occupants of the executive suites at Walt Disney and Paramount. He’s more careful these days about biting the hand that feeds him. But he makes his own intentions perfectly clear. “Am I going to give up acting?” he asks. “Yes. I almost can’t wait to give up acting, in one sense. I’m never going to get it right. I’ve resolved this with myself. I’ve made tons of money and seen the world and worked with all these great people, and still feel like a failure out there.”\n\nSo, politics. Which, after all, also involves performance. And at politics, Baldwin is no dilettante. He was an activist long before he took the helm of the Creative Coalition, an advocacy group for progressive entertainers and arts executives: At 10, he and his father went to Washington for Bobby Kennedy’s funeral; at 16, Alec was president of his high-school class; at 18, he interned for a Long Island congressman; at 26, he campaigned for Walter Mondale; and at 30, he accompanied Tom Hayden and Rob Lowe-among others-to the notorious (for Lowe, at least) 1988 Democratic Convention in Atlanta. Chuck Schumer is just the latest in a long line of Democrats he has endorsed, including Michael Dukakis, Ted Kennedy and Senator D’Amato’s last challenger, Robert Abrams.\n\nNot surprisingly, Baldwin has the ego to believe he has learned from their mistakes. No lily-livered, Clintonian consensus politics for him. “Democrats of the seventies and eighties are too tolerant, too open-minded, not feral enough,” he says. “I want to be the ferocious liberal.”\n\nGiven Ruth Messinger’s recent travails, it’s unclear whether Baldwin’s brand of politics will seize New York’s imagination. But even if you don’t agree with him, it’s hard to doubt his conviction. Even if you think he sounds like a pugnacious jerk, you have to admit he’s a New York kind of jerk, cut from the same cloth as the disparate likes of Cuomo, Koch, D’Amato, and Giuliani. A real jerk-not a phony jerk. But he’s also good at spouting what a friend of mine calls “yesterday’s idealistic crackpot garbage,” the whole politically correct litany. For now, the Democratic tent is big enough for both Alecs, and the party’s welcome mat is out for him. Not long ago, a state Democratic spokesman made it clear that Baldwin’s Hollywood-escape plan isn’t necessarily a fantasy.Though Alec’s indicated he isn’t running for office yet, Peter Ragone told the Daily News, “that doesn’t mean he will not run.”\n\nWhile Baldwin’s ambitions haven’t yet focused on any one goal, he has clearly spent some time weighing his options, and he’s definitely not thinking small. “Moynihan’s 2000. That’s too quick,” he says. “Could I run against [Long Island congressman Michael] Forties next year and win? I think I could beat the crap out of Forties. Would I want to be a congressman from the East End of Long Island, and go to Washington and be one of 435 people down there in a Republican controlled Congress? No. What’s the job I’d want to have? I’d say Senate. Governor. I would love to be governor of New York. It would be great. You can do a lot of things for a lot of people. Would I ever want to run for governor? Not on your life-with no political background. Where do you get the background and experience to be able to ramp up to that kind of thing? If someone could help me figure out a way I might do it.”\n\nIf Baldwin now talks as if acting were a mere detour on the road to his true calling, that’s because he has been steeped in these ideas all his life. What’s the source of Alec’s driving, nearobsessive political passion? “Two words,” says brother Billy. “My father.” Alec hasn’t tilted at Tinseltown windmills for ten years for no reason. He’s the eldest son of Alexander Rae Baldwin, Jr., a man who died thinking he’d failed, a beloved teacher whose brilliant career was stymied because he took on a machine-in his case, the Republicans of Long Island-and lost. Baldwin, in a very real sense, is destined to complete his father’s work.\n\n* * *\n\nA PICKET LINE OF TEACHERS MAKES A GHOSTLY CIRCLE in front of the flat expanse of Massapequa High School, where the Baldwin clan is gathering for the opening of the school’s refurbished, renamed Baldwin Auditorium, named for Alec’s father. Inside, guests are reminiscing about the days when Alec’s father walked the halls of the school, a lonely but popular progressive in a town where, says local politician Dal LaMagna, “if you wanted your garbage picked up, you registered Republican.”\n\n“We’re already late, and if I introduced every Baldwin, we’d be here till tomorrow,” says Dr. Jan Holdridge, the school district’s arts director. Jane Baldwin Sasso, Alec’s younger sister, reads a letter to their father, who died of cancer in 1983 at 55, recalling dinner-table debates; his days as a history, currentevents, and government teacher; his coaching junior-varsity football and riflery. “You taught us to stand up for what we believe in, even if it’s not popular,” she says. Then it’s Alec’s turn to speak. “My father passed away very young,” he says somberly, “and achieved JFK-like status in my family as a result … My father would be embarrassed by this. He was not into self-aggrandizement or a self-referential lifestyle … He had holes in his shoes, but he gave us what we needed. My father, my family, constantly overextended themselves trying to be of service. When I see myself stretched thin, trying to do things beyond acting, I know it is genetic.”\n\nNot much has changed in suburban Massapequa since Sander, as Alec was called, left for college in September 1976. In the lower-middle-class Nassau Shores neighborhood where the Baldwins grew up, tidy little houses sit on quarter-acre lots in neat rows on streets with names like Pocahontas, Algonquin, and West Iroquois, the last where the Baldwins lived in a small shingled Cape Cod house. Across the street is a golf course where, Baldwin once told a reporter, he lost his virginity on the third fairway to a local girl who celebrated the occasion by vomiting Boone’s Farm apple wine all over him.\n\nAlec’s father was the son of a Black Irish lawyer from Brooklyn who, Baldwin says, “stopped practicing, and the family’s economic fortunes turned sour.” After a stint in the Marines, Al Baldwin attended Syracuse University, earning a master’s degree before becoming a social-studies teacher at Massapequa High School. Baldwin was ambitious. He quit his job and headed back to Syracuse, his wife’s hometown, to study law, tuition paid by his father-in-law, a successful insurance man. But it didn’t work out, and he returned to Massapequa, hat in hand, begging for his old job back.\n\nThis was Al Baldwin’s first encounter with the hard hearts that ruled Massapequa. Alec’s great uncle Charlie Noble, the athletic director of Massapequa High, interceded. Noble says the assistant superintendent of schools responded, “Sure, you can have your job back, but you’ll never go any further.” From that day until his death, Baldwin hoped in vain to become a department head, a principal, or a school superintendent. Colleagues say he crossed swords with everyone from his principal to J. Lewis Ames, a former FBI agent who was head of the local school board. “Al would say what he believed,” recalls teacher AL Midura. “He certainly was not gonna let somebody on the school board tell him how to run his classroom. Had you known Alec’s dad, you’d see very strong similarities.”\n\nAl Baldwin’s politics didn’t help. “At first glance, you would have thought he was the classic right-wing football coach,” says teacher Joe McPartlin, “but his leanings were liberal.” When John F. Kennedy was killed, Baldwin went to Washington to stand on line to view the body in the Capitol rotunda. Four years later, he became a Democratic committeeman. None of which was likely to endear him to a school board that “owed a lot of favors to the Republicans,” says Martin H. Schwartz, political analyst for the Massapequa Post.\n\nAlec remembers Massapequa as “the manifestation of white flight from the city. Ames and all of those people embodied that. If you sold a house to black people in the sixties, your realestate company was never going to get another listing.” As recently as 1986, the New York Times reported that a schoolboard member could not remember a single black student who’d ever graduated from Massapequa High. “Back then,” he says, “the town fathers, particularly the school board, were racist bastards who wanted to keep it a lily-white town. My father grew up in downtown, working-class, bad-ass Brooklyn, and he didn’t have a racist bone in his body. He wouldn’t oppose them, but he wouldn’t be one of them. And he suffered the consequences to his career.”\n\nThe elder Baldwin was obsessed with Massapequa High. Besides teaching and coaching, Baldwin led trips, chaperoned dances, moderated battles of the bands, handled crowd control at school sports events, mentored athletes, visited families of troubled students. “He was a very selfless guy-I mean selfless to a fault,” Alec says. “You would almost say pathologically selfless.”\n\nAs Alec approaches 40, he has realized that his father’s heart was broken partly by politics. “My dad turned 40 in October 1967,” he says. “In April ’68, Martin Luther King was killed. In June ’68, Robert Kennedy was killed. And in the fall of ’68, my dad’s mother died. He was left, on an existential level, saying, `This is what I am. I’ve got the love of my students and I’ve got nothing else. My country is going to hell.’ After 1968, he was never the same again. All the air went out of him.” Teachers remember Xander Baldwin as a good, outgoing student who played sports, always sat in front of the class, and was encouraged by his educated parents to be well read and issueconscious. He had a vague interest in theater, which his father encouraged by sitting up late with him watching old movies on television and taking him to Broadway. But show business was merely a pastime. “He was unavailable to you emotionally unless you could speak his language,” Alec says. “When I was 10 years old, unless I learned what Dien Bien Phu was, unless I learned about the Tet Offensive, unless I learned who Gordon Liddy was, I was out.”\n\nBaldwin was programmed by his parents to go to law school and become a prosecutor, a public servant, maybe president. So in 1976, he enrolled in George Washington University and declared a major in political science. His first year, the bearded Alex Baldwin-as he was now known-worked on Capitol Hill opening a congressman’s mail and helped pay his tuition by working odd jobs.\n\nThe next year, Baldwin ran for chairman of the university’s Program Board, which produced campus events; a perk of the job was a 50 percent tuition discount. He booked Bonnie Raitt, Kenny Loggins, Mel Blanc, Bob Woodward , and British prime minister Harold Wilson, who regaled him with stories of Charles de Gaulle’s cheating at poker. He attracted attention. “He was handsome, very charming, he had an assurance, a commanding personality, women were attracted to him,” says Pete Aloe, an exroommate. “We said he should be an actor. He said, `No, no, no.’”\n\nGWUSA, the student government, controlled Baldwin’s budget. After a year, he ran for its presidency, hoping to seize control of the funding process (and not coincidentally, have his tuition paid entirely). The student newspaper, The Hatchet, editorialized against him. “Alex Baldwin has not demonstrated the capacity to listen to other viewpoints and cooperate with others,” it wrote.\n\nIn the first round of elections, Baldwin came in third, losing a place in a runoff by a single vote. He’d stopped campaigning when his girlfriend broke up with him. “I understand she didn’t vote,” says Jeffrey Nash, who replaced Baldwin on the Program Board.\n\nCrushed by these losses, he was primed to change course. So when a friend suggested he had what it took to be an actor, he went to audition for the head of NYU’s drama program. “There was a possibility that I could do this-a slight possibility” he says. “I walked away from it all. I walked into acting school.”\n\nBaldwin says that decision helped him find himself. It certainly helped him find fast success. Within months, he was discovered at a cattle-call audition for the movie The Idolmaker. He didn’t get that part, but it led to an audition for the soap opera The Doctors “We were looking for a young maverick,” says casting director Susan Scudder. “The ne’er-do-well son, a little dangerous, so mothers watching the show would say, `No, don’t go with him.’ Alec did it more naturally than most.”\n\nScudder’s producer put him on camera, fed him lunch, and sent him home with a signed contract and the name of an agent, J. Michael Bloom. The newly christened Alec Baldwin stayed on the low-rated soap until it was about to be canceled in 1982, when he and Tuck Milligan, another actor, piled into Alec’s Kharmann Ghia and headed to Los Angeles for pilot season.\n\nHe left a mess behind. His parents had separated a year earlier, and his father had taken off to drive cross-country. Father and son had words about family responsibility. No one told Alec, who was busy taping a pilot in March, that his father was dying of cancer; a longtime pipe smoker, he’d exacerbated his condition coaching riflery in the school’s unventilated basement range. “He lied to me,” says Alec. “And my mother lied to me, too. They did not tell me how bad off he was.”\n\nOn April 1, Alec finally saw his father in a Philadelphia hospital. “It was horrible,” he recalls. “I could not recognize him.” Two weeks later, Al Baldwin was dead.\n\n* * *\n\nIN 1984, BALDWIN-WHO’D TURNED DOWN MORE INTERESTING work for a lucrative recurring role on the primetime soap Knots Landing-wandered into the headquarters of onetime radical leader Tom Hayden, then a California assemblyman, and answered phones anonymously until someone recognized him. Hayden and his wife, Jane Fonda, then lured him into Network, a group of young Hollywood stars who’d discovered that their celebrity could focus attention on progressive issues-and pay a dividend in P.R.\n\nA pattern was soon established. Baldwin alternated between politics and acting, and when he was acting, between the bigmoney movie where you were embarrassed by the script and the wonderful play that paid only in satisfaction. He did a TV mini-series, Dress Gray, in 1986. Then he came back to the New York stage in Joe Orton’s Loot and the Broadway production of Caryl Churchill’s Serious Money. He and Bloom decided to seek supporting roles in lower-budget films by top directors-he did Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice, She’s Having a Baby by John Hughes, Oliver Stone’s Talk Radio, Jonathan Demme’s Married to the Mob, and Mike Nichols’s Working Girl, then won his first lead in a cool, quirky thriller, Miami Blues. He attended the 1988 Democratic Convention, flew across the country to attend a Dukakis fund-raiser, and went to Washington to lobby for arts funding. He was developing The Fugitive, auditioning for the likes of Spielberg and Scorsese, dating Holly Gagnier of Baywatch. He was the next leading man.\n\nBaldwin calls where he was the Lottery. “To become Nicholson, Brad Pitt-that’s an act of God,” he says. “It has nothing to do with your ability. I had an excellent chance at the Lottery. And I did not do what I was supposed to do. I was angry, very bitter that my father had died. I didn’t have anyone to advise me.”\n\nAnd as much as he loved national politics, he hated Hollywood’s. “You had to pretend that you liked all these people and wanted to be their friend,” he says. Six years in L.A. had turned him into a phone-throwing, rage-spewing Los Angeles-hater, and he took every opportunity to disparage the town: “A godless place.” “I fucking hate L.A.” “Rich and famous in L.A. is more toxic than anything.” “The whole poison cocktail in one glass.”\n\nHe had his price, though. Cast in The Hunt for Red October, he dove right back into the toxic swamp. The film, which grossed $120 million, was his biggest hit. “It changed everything,” he says. “I got on that big-movie-studio ride.” Baldwin met his future wife, Kim Basinger, herself a newly minted star, at a 1990 script reading. Afterward, they went to Morton’s, where his car died. “‘Alec Baldwin, you make too much money to have car trouble,’ ” the valet said. “I think that helped my cause of seducing Kim,” who drove him home that night, he says.\n\nLove led him directly into career hell. Baldwin and Basinger were accused of going on a rampage on the set of The Marrying Man, a Neil Simon comedy in 1990 and 1991. In articles in People and Premiere, Basinger was accused of habitual lateness, flashing the crew, talking filthy on open walkie-talkies, refusing to shoot in sunlight, demanding that no one look at her. Baldwin supposedly smashed the cell phones of Disney executives because he didn’t have one, punched dents in walls, kicked over a case of lenses, and threw his director’s chair.\n\nBaldwin, who denies many of the charges, says that promises made to the couple were not kept. He railed against the studio, called its cost-cutting executive Jeffrey Katzenberg “the eighth dwarf, Greedy,” and fired his publicist for counseling him not to respond to the bad press. No one’s behavior on The Marrying Man was politic. “It becomes a sticker on your luggage,” Alec says. “A stamp in your passport. But it never stopped me.”\n\nSoon afterward, Paramount offered Baldwin $10.5 million for two more Jack Ryan movies. But then came an offer to do A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway, an irresistible prospect for a Strasberg-trained actor. The window during which the play could be put on was limited, and Alec wasn’t happy with the next Ryan script, so he played tough and made demands, apparently hoping the studio would delay the picture to suit him.\n\n“It was attitude,” says a former employee. “He always had attitude. He’s full of self-doubt-that’s why his movie choices are right down the middle, not good, not bad-but his insecurity doesn’t manifest itself as shyness. He’s full of rage and resentment. He’s arrogant and cocky. He has a terrible temper. He’s very impatient. It’s his big foible, and it’s gonna dog him. I always wondered how someone so political couldn’t see the damage he does.”\n\nAlec played chicken with Paramount; he refused to sign his contract. “It became in their interest to move on to somebody else,” Baldwin says. “I began to believe that winning the Lottery meant just more face time with people I found it increasingly difficult to communicate with. You get tired of the problems. I want to have a good time. I’ve had enough of difficult situations.” So in August 1991, Baldwin flew east to start Streetcar, and Harrison Ford stepped into Jack Ryan’s shoes.\n\n“I don’t know that Alec ever considered the politics of it,” says Gregory Mosher, who directed Streetcar. “I admired the shit out of him for making the decision he made.” Asked whether Baldwin’s behavior hurt his reputation, Red October’s co-producer Mace Neufeld, who hasn’t spoken to him since, lets out a small laugh. “He’s a very talented actor,” Neufeld says. “I like his brothers. They’re very nice boys.”\n\nIn the wake of Red October, Baldwin fired his agent and jumped to CAA. “His exact quote to me was, `I don’t need a Cadillac or a Mercedes to dig me out of the hole I’ve dug my career into; I need a tow truck,’ ” Bloom says. “Someday he will come to terms with his anger.”\n\nStreetcar opened on April 1992, to mixed notices. His reviews were even worse when he testified before the New York City Council supporting a law restricting the city’s horse-drawn carriages, which he decried as animal cruelty. As he left the hearing room, he got into a shouting match with a carriage driver.\n\n“His exact words were,” Baldwin says, affecting a brogue,”`Takin’ the food out of our fuckin’ mouths-and your nigger lovin’ wife, too — you fuckin’ faggot!’ He said that about my wife because she dated Prince. I guess that pushed a button because of my retarded middle-class upbringing, so I turned and I said, `Fuck you, faggot.’ And there was a battery of reporters outside.” They reported Baldwin’s outburst, pointedly adding that he was scheduled to speak at an AIDS rally later that week. Needless to say, he was disinvited. “And [that] made things difficult for me for a long time,” Baldwin says. “Aside from the negative P.R., I was even more sorry that people who believed I was on their side thought me just like everybody else.”\n\nThe bad press continued after he stopped giving interviews. During the next four years, the few movies he made were ritually panned, he was embroiled in a zoning dispute in Amagansett that kept cropping up in gossip columns, he married Basinger (who’s had some bad press of her own — over her purchase of a Georgia town, her lawsuit over the film Boxing Helena, as well as her recent beagle rescue mission) in August 1993, and two years later came the notorious cameraman-attack incident. When he left CAA for William Morris that year, neither Hollywood trade paper covered the switch. It was clearly time for a reappraisal. “I would turn to friends and say, `I’m starting to sound like Richard Nixon,’ ” Baldwin says. “I was tired, very tired, of not getting it right in Hollywood.”\n\n* * *\n\nBALDWIN IS BACK IN HIS POLITICIAN’S SHIRT AND TIE at 5:50 a.m. on a foul fall Saturday, the predawn of his last major effort as president of the Creative Coalition: a campaign-finance-reform petition drive. As volunteers and a handful of reporters fill two buses parked on 42nd Street, Baldwin and his brother Billy stand hatless in the pouring rain, worrying about where the third bus is. It finally arrives, and as the caravan departs, Alec takes to the P.A. system. “Did anyone not get coffee, tea, or fatty, greasy baked goods?” he asks. “Somebody already spilled their coffee? We’re going to ask them to get off the bus. Things you got away with in high school will not be tolerated here.”\n\nLater, he gives a speech we’ll hear over and over that day, about how campaign-finance laws have turned politicians into money junkies. “They’re not getting the job done because they’re too busy raising money” he says. Somehow he connects military spending, pollution, big tobacco, and cancer to campaign-finance reform before someone hands him a cell phone and he heads to the back of the bus to do radio interviews. He’s still on the phone at 9:30 as the buses pull into Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nFor the next two hours, Alec and Billy work the crowd, answering questions, posing for pictures, even kissing babies. People hover, stare, make small talk, and take photos with the stars as the volunteers eat breakfast and pick up T-shirts and petition kits, and local news crews get footage of the action. On the sidelines, Katie Pierce, an angel-faced junior-high student in jeans, a nubby sweater, and a chenille hat, stares at Billy Baldwin. “They asked in our government class if we wanted to help out,” she explains. “I’m more interested in getting to know him. Why is he married? He’s a Baldwin. They shouldn’t be married. They’re so cute and hot. We wanted to drool awhile.”\n\n* * *\n\nLATELY, THE EPICENTER OF BALDWIN CONTROVERSIES HAS BEEN NOT Hollywood but Amagansett. Trouble has been percolating there since 1988, when Baldwin bought his house and got to know his neighbors by way of a minor zoning squabble, blown out of proportion by his celebrity. Ever since, he has made regular appearances in the letters columns of the East Hampton Star, where, Republican congressman Michael Forbes says, “he’s never shied away from taking on the Bonackers,” under his own and several assumed names. He’s made enemies all over, ranging from Montauk’s feistiest right-winger, restaurant owner Bill “the Last American” Addeo (who once challenged Baldwin to a charity boxing match), to Jerry Della Femina, the outspoken adman who publishes the Star’s competition, The Independent. “He’s abusive, a bully,” says Della Femina, who repeatedly poked fun at Baldwin in print after the actor accused him of having an interest in a land-gobbling golf-course development. Alec was equally opinionated about local politics. “I began to see that the town Republican power structure out there was completely full of shit in every way. They want to build more hotels, have casino gambling, have ferries-they don’t care about water quality.”\n\nLocal Democrats were more to his taste. East Hampton town supervisor Tony Bullock, now Senator Daniel P. Moynihan’s chief of staff, helped Baldwin with his zoning spat, and they became fast friends. “That’s what you’re supposed to do in local government, make it sensitive,” Bullock says. Baldwin would later fly cross-country to appear at a Bullock fund-raiser.\n\nThese days, East End Democrats are aching for him to run against Forbes, who, though a scion of a powerful Democratic family, is the area’s first Republican congressman in 26 years. “I think he might [run],” Bullock says. “I’ve talked to him and he’s made it pretty clear he wants to run for office. Either Congress or the Senate would make sense for him.” Dominic Baranello, the top Democrat in Suffolk County, agrees. “He’d make a very attractive candidate,” Baranello says. “We suspect he may be interested. All that’s needed is his consent. I hope he will consider it, but that’s not a commitment to support him.”\n\nAt the moment, Forbes isn’t worried. “Alec thinks Congress is beneath him. The question is timing. If there’s ever an opportunity to mix it up, he will. He sees the Democrats don’t have much going on. And he clearly has a statewide ego.”\n\nBaldwin’s political profile has ratcheted up since Creative Coalition president Christopher Reeve fell off a horse two years ago and Baldwin replaced him. He put his career on hold to work on issues like health care, gun control, and reproductive rights as well as arts advocacy. “We’ve been on the bus, literally and figuratively, for two years,” says Sharon O’Connell, the coalition’s executive director. “Alec has been extraordinarily committed.”\n\nIn the past few years, Baldwin has been in Washington as often as he’s been in Hollywood. It was there that he first met Chuck Schumer, whom he endorsed for the Senate this fall. “I’m in overwhelming agreement with Chuck about the overwhelming majority of his stands on issues,” Baldwin says. “I think he’s the best candidate, I think he gets it, he has the better record, he would make the best senator.”\n\nSchumer sought his advice when he began considering a run in 1998. “Alec’s a class act,” Schumer says. “He doesn’t want attention on this. He just wants to do the right thing, he cares about things, he has good judgment, he’s willing to put his time and energy where his mouth is. I’ve rarely-please quote me on this-met anyone more selfless than Alec.”\n\nSchumer declines to speak on the record about Baldwin’s political ambitions. But party sources guess that Schumer’s office has been the source of many of the Baldwin-for-Anything rumors. “Chuck needs statewide credibility” says Michael Forbes. “He needs to get his name in the press.” Baldwin does that for him and gets something in return, an experienced hand guiding him as he builds his own political base. “He wants a Spano to remember him,” Forbes continues. “Any good politico collects chits.”\n\nForbes says Baldwin’s even learning diplomacy. Forbes and Al D’Amato turned up at the opening of the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center, named for Alec’s mother, a mastectomy survivor turned breast-cancer activist. D’Amato was carrying a check for $20,000. “Alec was truly appreciative,” Forbes says. “It was very collegial, very friendly-a couple times, we were all yukking it up.”\n\nBaldwin’s activities with Schumer haven’t pleased everybody, though. “We have the better Baldwin,” snipes a source in Mark Green’s camp, referring to Alec’s younger brother Billy, who has endorsed Green, also a contender for D’Amato’s seat. Sources say that Judith Hope, another former East Hampton supervisor, now chairman of the flailing state Democrats, was annoyed when Baldwin showed up unannounced at Schumer’s side at the party’s midterm convention in Rye in September. But when she asked him, he stood up and offered his fund-raising and propaganda services to Democrats statewide. “He electrified the room” when he offered to help retire Al D’Amato, is all Hope will say about that. “He’s ferociously political. As political as anyone I’ve met, and it’s my business.” She reports that she asked him, “When are you going to run?” He demurred, but she hasn’t given up hope.\n\n“We need some stars,” she says. “I recognize that.”\n\nIf Baldwin’s Hollywood career is any indication, he has not been motivated by gain but compelled by his passions-passions that sometimes boil over into anger, a failing that stymied him as a star. “He’s gonna have to learn to master diplomacy and compromise,” says brother Billy, “but he’ll still speak his mind.” If Baldwin can turn his passions productive, and communicate his interest in the greater good without the arrogance that has, until now, too often betrayed celebrity politicos, he may well become the man his father wanted him to be, the candidate he wasn’t in college, the mensch he didn’t know how to be in Hollywood.\n\n* * *\n\nIN THE HALLWAY OF BALDWIN’S CENTRAL Park West apartment is an Eisenstadt photo of John E Kennedy, the sort of image that no amount of Camelot-bashing revisionism can efface. Wearing soft, expensive clothes, Baldwin sits in his Art Deco office, talking about his father and his family and his potential future in politics. “The most important thing for my father in the end was family, and that is what has happened to me,” he tells me.\n\n“I tell you what,” he says. “Write anything that will make people believe I have a political future. How’s that? I think it’s amusing if you keep that alive. But I have all these doubts about it. I don’t want to get divorced. It’s time away from my wife and my kid.” How does Basinger feel about all this? “She fluctuates,” he admits.\n\nAfterward, Baldwin walks me to the lobby. During the interview, he’d been calm, serious, and-dare I say it-politic. But while we’re shaking hands, the old Alec Baldwin emerges to get in the last word. “On the other hand,” he says, “when someone says, ‘Aren’t you worried how nefarious politics can be?,’ I say ‘Nothing is worse than the movie business.’ And I mean that from the bottom of my soul.\n\n“Nothing is worse than the movie business,” he says, almost gleefully. “Washington is just like the Boy Scouts compared to the movies.”\n\n©1997 Michael Gross\n\nTHE FIRST SIGN THAT CALVIN KLEIN HAD ARRIVED was the pair of bulky men moving down the escalator onto the main floor of Saks Fifth Avenue. Guns bulged under their blazers as they eyed the lunchtime crowd-about 400 people who’d come to see the fashion designer at his first public appearance since he’d spent the month of May in the Hazelden Rehabilitation Program, a Minnesota drug-and-alcohol clinic. Klein’s partner, Barry K. Schwartz, and dozens of employees of Calvin Klein Industries milled nervously around a gray marble platform on which brushed-steel letters spelled out ETERNITY, the name of the perfume Klein had come to introduce.\n\nHe rode down the escalator moments later, dressed in a tan bespoke suit, red tie, and penny loafers. Though pink from the sun, Klein’s face was drawn. He spoke briefly (“I hope I get a chance to meet all of you”), then stepped behind a drafting table, picked up a pen, and began signing autographs.\n\nBehind a rope, fourteen reporters strained to hear what he said to his fans. Though they’d been told no questions would be answered, some shouted them anyway, asking about his problems with vodka and Valium. Finally, Klein turned. “I feel fine,” he said. “Good. Just really good.” Then he put his hand up beside his head like Ronald Reagan does when he’s ignoring Sam Donaldson. “I have a problem with my ear,” he said, returning to his autographs.\n\nThe Saks and Klein people wanted only to talk about how well Eternity was selling, so the reporters quickly got bored. “Why are we here?” Newsday asked.\n\nForty minutes later, as the fans thinned out, Marilyn Berkery, a UPI reporter, joined the line of autograph seekers, still hoping to get in a question. As she reached Klein, his P.R. man, Paul Wilmot, blocked her way, but Berkery pushed past and approached the designer. “I’m just here for signing,” he said, looking befuddled.\n\n“What about the new morality?” Berkery pressed.\n\n“I’d need a press conference to do that one,” Klein said.\n\n“In and out fast,” said Wilmot, stepping in to lead Klein away.\n\n“In and out,” Klein repeated, smiling thinly as he left.\n\n* * *\n\nTHAT JUNE MONDAY, AS HIS LABEL PASSED ITS twentieth anniversary, Calvin Klein embarked on the latest leg of an extraordinary odyssey-a sort of one-man pilgrimage through the social history of modern America. In his journey from P.S. 80 on Mosholu Parkway in the Bronx to a summer place on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Klein, 45, has ridden America’s bucking Zeitgeist with remarkable skill, using his instinct for sensing-and reflecting-new mores to sell products from shoes to shampoo. While almost every other successful designer has found a style and stuck to it, Klein has built a billion-dollar business in his own evolving image. When he started his label, in the anti-fashion sixties, he wore long hair and publicly disdained his craft. “What can be great about designing fashion?” he asked in 1969. “Being a doctor, now, that’s great.” He lived in a rent-controlled Forest Hills apartment with the teenage sweetheart he’d married and their baby daughter. And he designed clothes-Trevira blouses, polyester print dresses-for people who shared his unsophisticated taste.\n\nBut within a few years, he had pronounced polyester “slimy,” moved to the Upper East Side, and started wearing Yves Saint Laurent suits.. He still designed simple careerwear but now with better fabrics.\n\nThen, in the late seventies, Klein emerged from the cocoon of middle-class propriety and began testing his wings. He shed his wife and changed the package that his most important product-Calvin Klein-came in. Gone were his wide ties and flared pants, traded in for Levis, T-shirts, and exercisewear. He still worked long days, but now he danced his nights away in drug-soaked discos with a new pack of fast-lane celebrity friends. He threw parties in his sleek, new bachelor apartment with its black-leather-covered bed; made the scene with models, both male and female; and vacationed in Key West and Fire Island Pines. The clothes he designed reflected the times: He set styles for gay men, his women’s clothes grew still more expensive and elegant, and his status jeans served a growing fashion fascination among the masses.\n\nIn the eighties, with Reagan occupying the White House, a new Gilded Age descending on the country, and AIDS ravaging the gay community, Klein could be found dressed in charcoal suits and white shirts, hanging out either with a new, preppy girlfriend, his design assistant Kelly Rector, or with the decade’s new heroes, freshly minted corporate raiders and highyield-junk-bond traders. He was still selling himself-appearing in his own ads-and still trading in sex in promotions for a perfume and androgynous underwear. But his sex-in-advertising had become newly ambivalent.\n\nAs the decade progressed, Klein reinvented himself yet again. He married Rector, now 31, and-inspired by a word written inside a ring he’d bought her from the duchess of Windsor’s collection-conceived his new scent, Eternity. At his shows, old friends like Bianca Jagger and Steve Rubell now rubbed shoulders with new ones like Gayfryd Steinberg and Jerry Zipkin, as models paraded past in extravagant evening clothes that were a far cry from his signature sportswear.\n\nNow comes the Eternity promotion campaign. In September, when the fragrance is nationally released, Klein will saturate the airwaves and periodicals with a reported $5.3 million worth of ads-ten-page photographic portfolios and ten 30second TV spots-selling, Klein told Women’s Wear Daily last month, “spirituality … love … marriage … commitment. I think that is a feeling that is happening all across the country.”\n\n* * *\n\nTHOUGH PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM ARE SYMPATHETIC about his problems with drugs and alcohol, some of them are cynical about this latest turn in the Calvin Klein journey. They claim Klein and Schwartz are positioning their company to sell it or expand it with other people’s money. In either case, they argue, Klein still has to establish that he’s in good health and condition to lead the company into the future. “It’s all about publicity,” says a fellow designer. Even Robin Burns, the president of Calvin Klein Cosmetics, acknowledges that Klein’s admission of his drug problems might help sales. “Calvin once told me there’s no such thing as bad publicity.”\n\n“He’s the consummate P.R. guy,” says Stanley Kohlenberg, who was the first president of Calvin Klein Cosmetics and now runs Sanofi Beauty Products. “It’s harder to create an image than a fall look. He created an image. He was everyone’s fantasy of style, sophistication, and creativity. It was the life-style of the times. You could be any sex you wanted. The more outrageous you were, the better. He pushed the edge of the envelope. He had the drive, intelligence, and creativity to make a dreamworld come true.”\n\nThough Klein continues to use himself and his realized “dreamworld” to sell his products, he refused to be interviewed for this article. ” `My Story,’ by Calvin Klein-that’s the only thing to be done,” said Wilmot, the P.R. man. But neither the designer’s official story nor the rumors that endure in the absence of a fleshed-out portrait do justice to the tale of his rise, fall, and recent revival. Interviews with more than 50 people, including current and former employees, close friends of Klein and his two wives, and retailers and financiers involved in his ventures, consistently paint a portrait of a contradictory man whose outsize life has caused him personal and professional problems.\n\n“He used to be a sweetheart,” says an ex-employee who worked close to Klein for years. “He used to be able to separate his private life from his business life.” But then? “There were so many changes.”\n\n“He knew he had to pay the piper for his celebrity,” another friend says sadly. “But he’s been paying all along.”\n\n* * *\n\nTHE FIRST MAJOR ARTICLE TO FEATURE CALVIN Klein appeared in the New York Times in 1969 under the headline-ironic in retrospect — FASHION DESIGNERS WHO SHUN THE FASHION SCENE. The outlines of his story, first told in that piece, are now well known. He was raised in the Bronx, the son of a Harlem grocer and a mother who liked nice clothes. Klein would join her on forays to Loehmann’s, where he’d study marked-down Norman Norell designs. He attended the High School of Industrial Art and the Fashion Institute of Technology, graduating at twenty in 1962 and going to work as a $75-a-week sketch artist for the late Dan Millstein, an oldline cloak-and-suit manufacturer. Klein worked there two years, leaving when Millstein refused him a $25-a-week raise. “Biggest mistake Dan made in his life,” says Edward Millstein, his brother and co-owner of the firm. “We wanted to keep him but he was very ambitious.”\n\nToday, Alan G. Millstein, Dan Millstein’s nephew and publisher of the Fashion Network Report, recalls that in 1964, his uncle lent Klein $400 so he could honeymoon in the Catskills with his bride, Jayne Centre, a textile designer who’d also been raised in the Bronx and attended P.S. 80 and F.I.T. “Jayne’s father was very concerned” about Klein’s income, recalls Jeffrey Banks, an ex-assistant.\n\nOver the next few years, Klein had several jobs, including a stint as a copyboy at Women’s Wear Daily. In 1968, he borrowed $10,000 from his boyhood pal Barry K. Schwartz (who had inherited a Harlem grocery from his father) and set up Calvin Klein, Ltd., a cloak-and-suit firm. Soon after, during the riots following Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, Schwartz’s store was looted, and he joined Klein as an equal partner.\n\nThey had some quick successes: The story of Klein’s rolling a cart of coats uptown to win his first $50,000 order from Mildred Custin, president of Bonwit Teller, is a garment-center legend. Meanwhile, he, Jayne, and their daughter, Marci, who had been born in 1966, lived in Queens in three and a half rooms decorated with pink silk chairs, a green couch, a handme-down chest, and some Picasso lithographs. Klein drove a Plymouth to work at his tiny office in a suite in the York Hotel. He and Schwartz “worked like slaves,” says an early employee. The effort paid off in 1973, when Klein won the first of his three Coty awards. By then he had expanded his line from coats to a 74-piece collection of clothes for women, and the award cited his “nonconformist” but “classic” styles.\n\nThe marriage, however, was troubled. “They were so young,” says Gina Epworth, his first P.R. woman. “Calvin grew up so fast. They grew at different paces. She pushed him hard. If he got to the office at 8:20, she called at 8:22. The marriage started going bad because she couldn’t bear to not always know where he was. The first time he went to Europe, she called half a million times. He used to say nobody should be married. She was very unhappy. I don’t think he blamed her. I think he realized something was wrong with him.” Klein himself hinted at what had happened in a 1984 Playboy interview: “If you have to go somewhere else for sex, then why be married?”\n\nEpworth’s husband, a lawyer, represented Klein in the divorce, which took effect in 1974. “It was the best divorce in history,” says someone who knows both parties. “He was incredibly generous with her. He bought her an apartment and several cars. It was all to do with his daughter.” (Klein is said to be devoted to Marci, who graduated in May from Brown. When she was kidnapped, in 1978, he paid $100,000 ransom and personally rescued her. Three kidnappers, including a former Klein baby-sitter, were later captured and convicted.)\n\nAfter the first Coty, Klein cut back from more than 1,000 outlets to 250, at the same time upgrading his fabrics and his image. “I remember him understanding that something was marketable besides the clothing,” says an early Klein assistant. “There was something going on besides design and shipping.”\n\nAs the seventies progressed, Klein spread his wings. Before their divorce, the Kleins had moved to the East Side, and there Klein met a boyhood hero, designer Chester Weinberg. After his divorce, Klein dated several women, but he also often went dancing in gay discos like Le Jardin, 12 West, and Flamingo and shared a house with another designer, Giorgio di Sant’Angelo, in the predominantly gay community Fire Island Pines. Weinberg and di Sant’Angelo introduced him to the sophisticated, anything-goes fashion world, teaching him “about society, about travel, about the world,” a friend says. “Calvin was growing and learning, freeing himself finally.”\n\nKlein also changed his looks-so dramatically that many people wondered whether he had had plastic surgery. He has denied this, and some acquaintances say he simply started working out and treating acne scars with silicone injections. Fashion photographer Richie Williamson recalls meeting Klein in Fire Island Pines in the old days. “I’ve never seen such a transformation in my life,” he says. “One year he was bland Calvin. The next year, he looked incredible.”\n\nStill, Klein was overshadowed-both by day, in the fashion world, and at night, in clubs like Hurrah and Studio 54-by Halston, a designer who was about ten years older. “Calvin was jealous of Halston,” says an acquaintance. “Halston created an aura, a mystique. What Halston had, Calvin wanted.”\n\nThe mystique that Klein then created for himself was in large part sexual. Speculation about his preferences started in those days-and Klein didn’t discourage it with his behavior. Over the years, he was often seen in gay hangouts like Rounds and Private Eyes. But he was just as often seen with beautiful women as with men.\n\nOne artist who spent many hours in Studio 54 in the late seventies, before owners Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager were arrested for skimming proceeds, says he came to know Klein well. The artist says that Klein, along with Halston and a fast-track pack of bi-coastal fashion- and entertainment-world bachelors, would stand near the club’s bar dispensing free drinks. “They referred to themselves as the inner circle,” the artist says.\n\nKlein has never commented publicly on his sexual preference. But in Playboy, when talking about “a very wild period” he went through, he said, “I’ve fooled around a lot. I stopped at nothing. I would do anything” (his emphasis).\n\nHe has also denied that he was heavily involved with drugs in the seventies. But acquaintances say he ran with a crowd that took Quaaludes and snorted cocaine to stay up.\n\n* * *\n\nKLEIN’S EMPIRE, MEANWHILE, WAS EXPANDING with his fame. Beginning in the late seventies, he and Ralph Lauren, another Bronx-born designer, took Halston’s celebrity-designer stance and raised it to an art form. Their careers ran parallel (though family man Lauren was and is more private) and their rivalry has always been intense. They used similar advertising shots by photographer Bruce Weber. Klein hired his first contract model, Jose Borain, away from Lauren. Kelly Rector, too, came to Klein’s employ from Lauren’s studio.\n\nStanley Kohlenberg was at the center of an early struggle between the two fashion titans. He met Klein through his wife, who was a nurse for a doctor who treated the designer. Klein had decided he wanted to compete in the cosmetics-and-fragrance arena, and Kohlenberg-then an executive vicepresident of Revlon-went to work for him early in 1977.\n\nLauren had signed a fragrance license about six months before, and Klein and Schwartz wanted their products out no later than his. To find out what perfumes Klein liked, Kohlenberg says, “I bought every fragrance in the United States, masked them, and sprayed him with three a day. He hated everything except musk.” So Kohlenberg asked a fragrance house, International Flavors and Fragrances OFF), to develop a scent. Klein’s advisers rejected it, though, and IFF got Kohlenberg’s okay to offer the reject to Lauren. (A spokesman for IFF wouldn’t comment.)\n\nA Klein aide finally found a fragrance in Paris that the designer liked. Meanwhile, both Klein and Lauren were negotiating with department stores that wanted to introduce their lines. Bloomingdale’s had set a date in early 1978 for Lauren and offered Klein a launch a week later. “Calvin couldn’t break after Ralph,” Kohlenberg says, “so we went to Saks.” But the fragrance Klein had chosen didn’t sell well, Kohlenberg says. “A week later, Barry called me screaming-his usual tone of voice.” Lauren’s fragrance was outselling Klein’s.\n\n“Have you smelled it?” Kohlenberg asked Schwartz.\n\nFive minutes later, Schwartz called back, screaming, “This is our fragrance!”\n\n“We turned it down,” Kohlenberg reminded him. Looking back now, he laughs. “It was downnill from there.”\n\n“Schwartz, with his Midas touch, was used to seeing money being made,” says another ex-employee. “I think he got impatient. He didn’t want to be bothered.” In November 1979, he ordered Kohlenberg to close the cosmetics company, fire his staff, and even cancel the airplane tickets of salesmen who were on the road. Frank A. Shields, the head of sales, had a contract, but when he took a few days off at Christmas, Schwartz fired him too. (He later sued and collected on his contract.) In an interview with Fortune, Shields recalled having lunch with his fifteen-year-old daughter, Brooke, and telling her that he was suing the Klein company. Later during the meal, he asked her what she was doing the next day. “I wish you hadn’t asked that, Daddy,” Brooke Shields replied. “I’m shooting six 30-second TV shots for Calvin Klein. He makes the only designer jeans I like.”\n\n* * *\n\nTHE CLOSING OF THE COSMETICS COMPANY WAS SERIOUS, but the growth of Klein’s business had been impressive nonetheless. By 1978, Klein was offering hundreds of designs each season. Though not known for innovation, he helped define what came to be known as “the American look.” Typically, that meant understatement and a complete absence of gimmickry. He has used luxurious fabrics-cashmere, suede. fine wool, tissue-thin linen, and crepe de Chine in subtle colors, for example-but always in an easy, sexy, elegant, and modern manner. Though best known for daytime clothes, he is a master of the little black cocktail dress. And at the other end of the fashio"
