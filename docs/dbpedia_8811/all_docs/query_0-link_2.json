The area already contained the port towns of Alexandria and Georgetown, but the new nation needed a federal center with space dedicated for government buildings. Washington asked L'Enfant, by then an established architect, to survey the area and recommend locations for buildings and streets. This astonishing plan for the city continues to define Washington’s built form today. L’Enfant’s plan translates European models to American ideals. A central mall was designed as open to all (in contrast to European traditions of enclosed open spaces). L'Enfant placed “Congress House” on a hill with commanding views, rethinking European customs of reserving such sites for the leader's palace. From this central site, diagonal avenues, later named after U.S. states, radiated, cutting across a grid street system. One diagonal avenue (later named Pennsylvania) extended northwest from Congress House to the “President’s House.” Public squares and parks were evenly dispersed at intersections. These wide boulevards facilitated cross-town transportation and offered long-distance views of important buildings and common squares.\n\ncode47\n\nFederal Development Maps National Mall and Core Transportation Waterfronts\n\nProclamation Establishing First Building Regulations\n\nOctober 1791\n\nPresident George Washington\n\nWashington's proclamation specified building setbacks, heights and materials, among other related concerns.

This proclamation is understood to be primarily concerned with aesthetics e.g., it specifies buildings on the Avenues shall be at least thirty-five feet. (Many of the preliminary planning decisions regarding the capital’s design are discussed in correspondence between Jefferson and Washington. Washington had not travelled outside of North America and therefore relied heavily on Jefferson, who was widely travelled and had seen some of Europe’s national and provincial capitals.) Thomas Jefferson’s notes from March 1791 indicate that he was concerned about building heights as a means of controlling fires and considered a recommendation to Washington to limit building heights For example, Jefferson suggested building height limits “[t]o provide for the extinguishment of fires, and the openness and convenience of the town, by prohibiting houses of excessive heights.”\n\ncode94\n\nLegislation National Mall and Core Transportation Zoning and Housing\n\nEllicott Map of the City of Washington\n\nJanuary 1792\n\nAndrew Ellicott\n\nThis map, which reflects minor revisions to the L’Enfant Plan, became the first broadly circulated plan for Washington city.

After Pierre L’Enfant’s planning stirred political complications, he resigned and his surveyor, Andrew Ellicott continued the planning work. Ellicott straightened or eliminated some radial avenues in this map. To facilitate implementation, it numbered the blocks designated for private development. The L’Enfant Plan and the Ellicott Map established the framework for the nation’s capital city and influenced Washinton’s development for more than 200 years.\n\ncode48\n\nFederal Development Maps National Mall and Core Transportation Waterfronts\n\nAn Act to Provide a Permanent System of Highways Lying Outside of Cities\n\nMarch 1893\n\nFifty-Second U.S. Congress\n\nCongress directed the DC Board of Commissioners “to prepare a plan for the extension of a permanent system of highways over all that portion of said District...\n\nCongress directed the DC Board of Commissioners “to prepare a plan for the extension of a permanent system of highways over all that portion of said District not included within the limits of the cities of Washington and Georgetown.” The act conveyed that the system “shall be made as nearly in conformity with the street plan of the city of Washington as the Commissioners may deem advisable and practicable.” It specified that new highways shall not be less than ninety feet nor more than one hundred and sixty feet. Further, it specified the Commissioners should “lay out at the intersections of the principal avenues and streets thereof circles or other reservations corresponding in number and dimensions with street intersections in the city of Washington.” Note that at this time, highways referred to present day streets and avenues, not freeways.\n\ncode131\n\nLegislation Transportation\n\n1894 District of Columbia Building Regulations Amendment\n\nJuly 1894\n\nDistrict of Columbia Commissioners\n\nThis amendment restricts building heights in DC to generally the width of the street at the building front.

In 1872, a year after Congress established a territorial government, its public works board introduced Washington’s first comprehensive set of building regulations which focused on health and safety. Five years later, the board established a seventy-five-foot height limit, with some exceptions. The 1894 regulations established maximum height limits of 90 feet in residential areas and 110 feet in commercial areas. The regulations, when published in 1897, added an allowance for buildings on 160-foot-wide business street: enabling them to rise to 130 feet. Spires, towers, and domes could be erected to a greater height than the limit proscribed, when approved by the District Commissioners. On corner lots, the limitations of the broader street applied. The law follows advancements in construction technology, including the use of iron and steel frames, along with veneer facades. Public safety, monetary, and aesthetic surrounding the 164-foot Cairo Hotel building, completed in 1894 at 1615 Q Street, NW, particularly spurred the legislation. Paper by Alison K.

In the late nineteenth century, Washington was developing beyond the original L’Enfant City. As small municipalities and subdivisions emerged, the street system became poorly connected. Congress authorized the federally appointed DC Board of Commissioners to plan “a permanent system of highways in that part of the District of Columbia lying outside cities” in its Highway Act of 1893. Before the twentieth century, highways generally referred to main pathways connecting urbanized areas. This plan extended many of the streets contained in the original L’Enfant City to the outlying areas of Washington, while specifying some curvilinear streets or parkways, particularly where difficult topographic conditions existed.\n\ncode21\n\nMaps Transportation\n\nAct to Regulate the Height of Buildings in the District of Columbia\n\nMarch 1899\n\nFiftieth U.S. Congress\n\nMore commonly known as the Height of Buildings Act of 1899, it mirrors the restrictions adopted by the D.C.

Commissioner’s in 1894, with additional limitations for non-fireproof buildings. It limited these structures to seventy-five feet for commercial uses and sixty feet for residential, apartment, and hotel uses. Congress amended the Act on nine subsequent occasions, with the most significant being the Height of Buildings Act of 1910.\n\ncode95\n\nLegislation National Mall and Core Zoning and Housing\n\nReport of the McMillan Senate Committee\n\nJune 1902\n\nU.S. Senate Park Commission\n\nNow commonly known as the McMillan Plan, the report reinforced L’Enfant Plan concepts with recommendations to formally develop the monumental core. It also...\n\nNow commonly known as the McMillan Plan, the report reinforced L’Enfant Plan concepts with recommendations to formally develop the monumental core. It also proposed a system of parks and parkways, including an arrangement encompassing the Civil War-era fortifications encircling the city. In the late 19th century, various groups including the American Institute of Architects, local and state authorities, and members of Congress, formed to plan a centennial celebration of the capital city. Participants created a special committee to make final recommendations, choosing Senator James McMillan as chairman. One key goal was to resolve conflicting development visions, particularly around the National Mall. Despite Congressional legislation in 1893 and 1898 to develop an official plan extending the L’Enfant Plan’s roadway system to the Washington city boundary, concerns about growth patterns persisted. The location of railroads, particularly on the Mall, was also a concern. Senator McMillan introduced a joint Congressional resolution in 1901 to study public building arrangements and develop a comprehensive park system. The subsequent Senate Park Commission report became known as the McMillan Plan. It proposed an expanded “modern park system” so that the plan’s two elements would together form “one great composition designed to comprehend the entire District of Columbia.” Addressing environmental, viewshed, and quality of life concerns (e.g., water quality and seasonal heat), the plan called for an increase in the quantity and quality of parks, parkways, and fountains. The Commission’s 1902 exhibition of the plan at the Corcoran Gallery of Art generated broad interest; but when implementation lagged Congress established new agencies to oversee development. It designated the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 to review and advise on the design of new structures, and the Public Buildings Commission (a predecessor to the General Services Administration) in 1916 to facilitate federal office construction. It established the National Capital Park Commission in 1924, before reestablishing it as a planning agency as the National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1926.\n\ncode49\n\nFederal Development Maps National Mall and Core Parks Transportation Waterfronts\n\nBuilding Height of Act of 1910\n\nJune 1910\n\nSixty-first U.S. Congress\n\nThis act amends the 1899 building height act to provide more comprehensive regulations.

Most notably it sets a formula whereby the maximum building height is generally equal to the fronting street width plus 20 feet, measured from the sidewalk. It enabled buildings on the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue between 1st and 15th Streets, NW to rise to 160 feet, the height of the Willard Hotel. Particularly mindful of impacts to preeminent federal buildings, the Act requires a Schedule of Heights that places further height restrictions on structures near specified federal buildings.\n\ncode97\n\nFederal Development Legislation National Mall and Core Zoning and Housing\n\nBuchanan v.

In reviewing a Kentucky city ordinance, the U.S.Supreme Court found that it surpassed the legitimate grounds of police power, as it interfered with individuals' rights of property. The “effect of the ordinance under consideration was not merely to regulate a business or the like, but was to destroy the right of the individual to acquire, enjoy, and dispose of his property.” The ruling did not address the right of owners or developers to restrict housing based on private agreements. Later, in a 1948 St. Louis case known as Shelley v. Kraemer, the court determined that racially restrictive housing covenants violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\ncode176\n\nZoning and Housing\n\nAct creating a Zoning Commission\n\nMarch 1920\n\nSixty-sixth U.S. Congress\n\nAn Act to regulate the Height, Area, and Use of buildings in the District of Columbia and to create a Zoning Commission.

Zoning Commission composed of the District Board of Commissioners, the Superintendent of Public Grounds, and the Superintendent of the Capitol.

Following Congress’ enabling legislation, the Zoning Commission hired Harland Bartholomew to devise a regulatory framework. The resulting 18-page text was accompanied by a map for each element. The area map specified four different lot occupancy allowances (40, 60, 75 and 90 percent). The height map included four categories of height limits (110, 85, 55, and 40 feet). The use map depicted a residential, an industrial, and two commercial districts. The regulations’ development signaled the importance of planning for the non-park areas of the District, although building regulation precedents existed as far back as George Washington’s 1791 proclamation, “Establishing First Building Regulations, Including a Height Limitation, for All Private Construction in the Federal City.” Restrictions on uses dated to the 1870s when “business” and “residential” streets were identified. These terms facilitated allowances for certain commercial uses on portions of the L’Enfant Plan’s generous right-of-way or “public parking.” Street designations were later tied to building height limits.\n\ncode100\n\nLegislation Maps Zoning and Housing\n\nNational Capital Park Commission Act\n\nJune 1924\n\nSixty-Eighth U.S. Congress\n\nCongress established the National Capital Park Commission to plan and acquire a comprehensive park, parkway, and playground system for the National...\n\nCongress established the National Capital Park Commission to plan and acquire a comprehensive park, parkway, and playground system for the National Capital. This legislation followed congressional concerns that Washington had made limited progress toward implementing the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans, and that it’s park system lagged far behind other U.S. cities. Congress reported interest in the government acquiring Rock Creek valleys and tributaries, Klingle Ford Valley, lands fronting on the Capitol Grounds and along Pennsylvania Avenue, and lands in Washington’s outskirts for parks and playgrounds. Congress was also interested in creating a Fort Boulevard connecting the Civil War forts, expanding Piney Branch Parkway; and developing an arboretum in the vicinity of Mount Hamilton. Recognizing that the “Capital City” expanded into the surrounding states, Congress also expressed interest in securing lands in Maryland and Virginia, including the Rock Creek valley; both banks of the Potomac River up to Great Falls, Sligo Valley, and areas encompassing the Civil War forts. It conveyed interest in developing park boulevards to Mount Vernon and Fort Washington; forested parkways extending north along 16th Street; a park boulevard toward Baltimore; and three park boulevards radiating from the Memorial Bridge terminus in Virginia. To accomplish these tasks, the act designated a seven-member commission “composed of the Chief of Engineers of the Army, Engineer Commissioner of DC, the Director of the National Park Service, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, the officer in charge of public buildings and grounds, and the chairmen of the Committees on the District of Columbia of the Senate and House of Representatives…The officer in charge of public buildings shall be the executive and disbursing officer.” Note: the commission composition generally reflected the prevailing classification of park and recreation facilities as public works.\n\ncode1\n\nFederal Development Legislation Parks Regional Planning Transportation\n\nAnnual Report of the National Capital Park Commission\n\nJune 1925\n\nNational Capital Park Commission\n\nThe Commission prepared annual reports that conveyed early activities and were submitted to Congress.

The Commission’s annual authorization was $1,057,106, based on its enabling legislation, which authorized “a sum not exceeding one cent for each inhabitant of the continental United States as determined by the last preceding decennial census.” Nine months after its enabling legislation, the Commission received its first appropriation of $600,000. The report noted that the Commission used funding to address “urgent cases of natural habitat destruction” which were attributed to dumping, filling, tree-cutting and building operations, particularly in the Piney Branch and Klingle Ford Valleys. The Commission authorized a “Planning Committee” to plan for park extensions and coordinate the Commission’s authorities with other stakeholders. The committee prioritized McMillan Plan recommendations, noting concerns about available funding. It reported that it had successfully coordinated Highway Plan modifications and other activities. However, park development and acquisition proceeded slowly. The report conveyed that the Commission needed additional authorities “to develop the National Capital along the proper lines and in accordance with the best principles of city and regional planning developed in this country and in Europe.”\n\ncode51\n\nParks Regional Planning Transportation Waterfronts Zoning and Housing\n\nAnnual Report of the Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital\n\nJanuary 1926\n\nOffice of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital\n\nAn annual report on the activities of the agency authorized to build and maintain public grounds, parks, monuments, and memorials in Washington.

Its reports (see separate cards for the years 1925-1932) identify disbursements to NCPC’s predecessors for land acquisitions and review the year’s developments and activities on acquired lands. • Memorials, statues, and monuments include National Memorial (building) to Colored Race, Women of the World War (building), Nuns of the Battlefield (sculpture), Pennsylvania Memorial Foundation (fountain). • Facilities include Community Christmas trees, golf-croquet court, hurdling field, medicine ball courts, archery courts, roque courts, quoit courts, schlag-ball courts, speed-ball courts, tea houses, sand boxes, • Activities include community singing, roller skating races, tourist camp, field meets, tug-of-war, easter egg rolling, Child Health Day, May Day exercises, ceremonies at various statues, Cherry blossom fete, and a ceremony on Decoration Day. Photos illustrate construction progress. Diagrams distinguish agency expenses and Park Police arrest volumes e.g., for speeding, drunkenness, operating an auto while intoxicated, reckless driving, and disorderly conduct.\n\ncode99\n\nFederal Development Infrastructure and Services Parks Preservation\n\nCity Planning Procedure\n\nJanuary 1926\n\nFrederic A.

Including additions to Rock Creek Park and miscellaneous parks, the plan’s park acreage totaled 2,608 acres, compared to the system’s 2,442 acres in 1924. However, the park commission lacked sufficient funds for implementation. It was also powerless to influence the city’s plan except for structuring growth within the configurations created by the protected parklands. Civic interests, specifically the Washington Board of Trade, conveyed that Washington needed an agency with broader authorities. Congress established NCPPC with the “duty of preparing, developing, and maintaining a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National Capital and its environs.” It specified that the “plan shall include recommendations…as to traffic and transportation; plats and subdivisions; highways, parks, and parkways; school and library sites; playgrounds; drainage, sewerage, and water supply; housing, building, and zoning regulations; public and private buildings; bridges and water fronts; commerce and industry; and other proper elements of city and regional planning.” It conveyed that NCPPC’s purpose was “to obtain the maximum amount of cooperation and correlation of effort between the departments, bureaus, and commissions of the Federal and District Governments.” The act conferred to NCPPC the duties of the Highway Commission, (specified in an 1898 act to provide a “permanent system of highways” in Washington). The act also conferred the authorities of the National Capital Park Commission (established in a 1924 act to create a park and playground system for the national capital) to NCPPC.\n\ncode12\n\nFederal Development Infrastructure and Services Legislation Parks Regional Planning Transportation Zoning and Housing\n\nPublic Buildings Act of 1926\n\nMay 1926\n\nSixty-Ninth Congress\n\nThe act authorized and funded federal developments, including the Federal Triangle, Supreme Court, and Government Printing Office.

Congress authorized the federal government to clear and close streets in the triangle bounded by Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW and President’s Park. The project displaced a central market and a range of more modest government, commercial and residential buildings. A community of Chinese merchant immigrants relocated to other sites, and eventually to present-day Chinatown. New buildings in this area between the White House and Capitol Building were to “combine high standards of architectural beauty and practical utility.” It specified “suitable approaches to said buildings and beautifying and embellishing their surroundings as nearly in harmony” with the L'Enfant Plan. The siting and design standards reflected those advanced in the McMillan Plan. Along with NCPPC’s establishment in the previous month, this act represented the federal government’s renewed commitment to fulfilling the McMillan Plan. As a newly-established agency, NCPPC facilitated the Triangle's development (see article).\n\ncode14\n\nFederal Development Legislation National Mall and Core Transportation\n\nA Standard City Planning Enabling Act\n\nMay 1926\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce\n\nThe act established the foundation for planning and zoning enabling legislation in the U.S. For many states, the Standard Acts, as they are known, still...\n\nThe act established the foundation for planning and zoning enabling legislation in the U.S. For many states, the Standard Acts, as they are known, still provide institutional structure, although some procedural and substantive components may have changed. An advisory committee on zoning appointed by Secretary of Commerce (and later President) Herbert Hoover developed the first model language: A Standard State Zoning Enabling Act. The act reflects future NCPPC consultant Harland Bartholomew’s guidance. He suggested the term “comprehensive” to replace the less meaningful “well-considered” in a key section. This eventually provided the often used “in accordance with a comprehensive plan” language. A second model, A Standard City Planning Enabling Act, was published in 1928. This covered six subjects: (1) The organization and power of the planning commission, which was directed to prepare and adopt a \"master plan.\" (2) The content of the master plan for the physical development of the territory. (3) Provision for adoption of a master street plan by the governing body. (4) Provision for approval of all public improvements by the planning commission. (5) Control of private subdivision of land. (6) Provision for the establishment of a regional planning commission and a regional plan.\n\ncode58\n\nLegislation Parks Transportation Zoning and Housing\n\nNCPPC Coordinating Committee\n\nJune 1926\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nThe National Capital Park Commission, on March 18, 1925, authorized a City Planning Committee composed of representatives of federal and District agencies that...\n\nThe National Capital Park Commission, on March 18, 1925, authorized a City Planning Committee composed of representatives of federal and District agencies that made or implemented planning decisions, for the purpose of recommending plans for park extensions, changing the highway plans, and coordinating the work of the different authorities whose jurisdictions would be reached by the activities of the Commission. The newly authorized National Capital Park and Planning Commission (NCPPC), at its meeting on June 18, 1926, directed that the Committee--then acting as the City Planning Committee--be continued as a \"Coordinating Committee” to review various projects prior to their submission to the Planning Commission, with a view to proper coordination of the various interests involved. NCPC, at its first meeting on August 8, 1952, passed the following resolution: “Be it Resolved, that there is hereby established and reconstituted a committee to be known as NCPC’s Coordinating Committee NCPC, as authorized in Section 2 (d) of the National Capital Planning Act of 1952. The Committee, hereby established and reconstituted, has the official duty to perform functions similar to those performed by the previously existing Coordinating Committee.” Today, an interagency Coordinating Committee provides NCPC with information and recommendations on projects in the District before they come before the Commission.\n\ncode23\n\nFederal Development Legislation Parks Transportation\n\nRegional Planning Organization and Legislation Memorandum\n\nOctober 1926\n\nHarland Bartholomew\n\nThis memorandum recognized the growing Washington area and recommended that the national capital have an authority that controlled regional planning and...\n\nThis memorandum recognized the growing Washington area and recommended that the national capital have an authority that controlled regional planning and development. The memo followed the guidance document “A Standard City Planning Enabling Act,” which Bartholomew helped the U.S. Department of Commerce develop. It observed that NCPPC’s enabling legislation focused on park concerns, but insufficiently addressed other city planning elements and ongoing development patterns that extended well beyond the historic L’Enfant City. Foreshadowing future legislation, it recommended creating a metropolitan agency to plan and control physical improvements. It also recommended creating regional planning authorities to cooperate with NCPPC in Maryland and Virginia.\n\ncode113\n\nLegislation Parks Regional Planning Transportation Zoning and Housing\n\nAnnual Report of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission\n\nNovember 1926\n\nNational Capital Park and Planning Commission\n\nThe Commission reported its updated composition (following the 1926 National Capital Park and Planning Commission Act) that included four citizens appointed by...\n\nThe Commission reported its updated composition (following the 1926 National Capital Park and Planning Commission Act) that included four citizens appointed by the President: Frederick Law Olmsted (a landscape architect noted for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, McMillan Plan, and U.S. Capitol Building grounds design); Frederic A. Delano (a railroad engineer, Federal Reserve vice-chairman, and leader behind newly-established regional planning programs in Chicago and New York City and the uncle of future President Franklin Delano Roosevelt); J. C. Nichols (a Kansas City-area developer known for his residential subdivisions and Country Club [shopping] Plaza); and Milton B. Medary (an architect who served as chairman of the U.S. Housing Corporation and as a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts). Lt. Col. Ulysses S. Grant, III (grandson of President Ulysses S. Grant), directed the commission’s ten-employee administrative office. The report noted that Charles Eliot II (an Olmsted Brothers employee noted for conceiving what became Boston’s Emerald Necklace of parkland) was hired; in 1930 Eliot became staff director. Fred G. Coldren, who as chairman of the Washington Board of Trade’s parks committee drafted NCPPC’s enabling legislation, became NCPPC’s secretary. The Commission engaged Harland Bartholomew (a St. Louis-based consultant who prepared the 1920 DC zoning ordinance) to prepare a regionwide thoroughfare plan. The Commission reported that it met monthly, with meetings generally lasting two days. It also reported reconstituting its predecessor’s City Planning Committee as the “Coordinating Committee,” and authorized it to recommend for or against federal agency development plans. The Committee met weekly. Among a brief program overview, the Commission noted the lands it acquired for parkland.\n\ncode50\n\nFederal Development Parks Regional Planning Transportation\n\nPreliminary Report on Relocation of Produce Markets\n\nJanuary 1927\n\nBartholomew and Associates\n\nTo accommodate what would become the Federal Triangle development, this report to NCPPC recommends constructing two Farmers Markets, one north of the municipal...\n\nTo accommodate what would become the Federal Triangle development, this report to NCPPC recommends constructing two Farmers Markets, one north of the municipal fish market in Southwest. Alongside a second market in Northwest, in the vicinity of New York and Florida Avenues, the report recommended securing land for a potential Eckington railroad produce terminal. As NCPPC reported in 1926, the Federal Triangle project area encompassed multiple facilities: (“1) A wholesale market, patronized by grocers, hucksters, hotel and boarding-house keepers, and (2) A retail market. The wholesale market in turn comprises two features: (a) The Farmers’ Market (including retail businesses), and (b) The Commission Houses and Peckers’ sales-rooms. The Farmers’ Market is operated under the direction of the Board of Commissioners. The retail market is located in the so-called Center Market building. It is U.S. property and is operated by the Department of Agriculture. The Farmer’s Market and the commission houses together constitute the District’s wholesale market. The committee found that because of their common patronage, the Farmers’ Market and the commission houses can not be far separated without injury to the…Farmer’s Market. The Center Market proper, a retail establishment, can be more reasonably separated…though its patronage is common…with that of the Farmers’ Market.” The area between the monumental core southwest to the waterfront was suggested by the McMillan Commission and other civic boosters for public improvements (see McMillan Plan and Waterfront Advantage). However, Bartholomew determined the available area in Southwest was relatively confined, while most consumers and food goods originated from the north (e.g., an estimated 1.5% were water-borne). Congress asked the Commissioners of the District of Columbia to recommend a site in a March 1927 act. Two years later, in Public No. 927, President Coolidge approved the Commissioner’s recommendation for a Farmers’ Produce Market bounded by 10th, 11th, E, and G Streets, SW, citing proximity to the municipal fish market and cold storage railroad facilities.\n\ncode312\n\nLegislation National Mall and Core Transportation Waterfronts\n\nPark System for the National Capital Washington Region\n\nFebruary 1927\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nThis report recommended five major regional park projects: Lower Potomac, Upper Potomac, Indian Creek, Rock Creek, and Northwest Branch.

The report also included Fort Boulevard and several sites of more local interest, particularly along stream valleys. The report anticipated open spaces being used for motor roads, bridle paths, hiking trails, picnic groves, observation towers, “properly ordered tea houses,” and “refreshment places.” It advised preserving “natural beauty,” points of historic interest, wildlife and “natural wonders of the area.” It suggested that spaces “may be very useful in the teaching of botany, zoology, etc.” Report sections on “Methods of Procedure” and “Division of Costs and Responsibilities” described processes and costs for “withdrawing lands from urban occupation.” The reports outlined the “factors governing [the] choice of open space areas” which included the region’s physical features, chiefly the “Y” shape of the rivers and its stream valleys. Other factors included existing open spaces; previous regional park proposals; and areas of special interest including natural history, “aborigines” (referencing archaeological materials), scientific, historic, architectural, and engineering features.\n\ncode56\n\nMaps Parks Regional Planning Transportation Waterfronts\n\nFort Drive: Plan for a Parkway Connecting the Civil War Forts and Encircling the City of Washington\n\nFebruary 1927\n\nNational Capital Park and Planning Commission\n\nDescribing what is now known as the Civil War Defenses of Washington, this plan explored connecting the lands that were once used as military installations on...\n\nDescribing what is now known as the Civil War Defenses of Washington, this plan explored connecting the lands that were once used as military installations on the high ground surrounding Washington with a “park drive.” It envisioned “a wide right-of-way, curving roads, and bits of existing woodland along the way,“ which would be integrated with local streets. Associated cost estimates were provided. The plan followed a December 1926 Commission action to develop such a plan as a supplement to NCPPC’s “Park System for the District of Columbia.” NCPPC’s actions built upon the McMillan Plan’s preservation of the fort sites and the 1898 Highway Plan’s inclusion of a Fort Drive. The circumferential corridor concept also complemented NCPPC’s emerging bypass and thoroughfare planning.\n\ncode112\n\nMajor Plans Parks Transportation\n\nRailroad Report for Washington D.C.\n\nApril 1927\n\nNational Capital Planning Commission\n\nThis report, prepared by Harland Bartholomew & Associates, advanced eleven major recommendations that ranged from addressing prevailing grade crossings to...\n\nThis report, prepared by Harland Bartholomew & Associates, advanced eleven major recommendations that ranged from addressing prevailing grade crossings to expanding capacity at the Long Bridge crossing, enlarging the Virginia Avenue tunnel, and consolidating rail yards. The report explored numerous considerations. For example, it anticipated that Washington would need limited industrial facilities as most production would be oriented toward the region’s residents, except for fuel production. To avoid these facilities marring “the beauty of Washington and its environs” the report encouraged investing in smokeless fuels. Plates conveyed maps of railroad lines; volumetric diagrams of train movements through Washington; rail yard diagrams; Washington Union Station’s train schedule; passenger miles; railroad engine and car volume; perishable freight volume; and the number of loaded and empty carloads.\n\ncode75\n\nMaps Regional Planning Transportation\n\nAnnual Report of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission\n\nJune 1927\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nNCPPC reported that its work program consisted of eight “functional groupings:” 1.

Highways (including thoroughfares of regional importance, thoroughfares of secondary importance, and local streets); 2. Railroads and terminals 3. Mass transportation 4. Water supply and drainage 5. Parkways 6. General parks 7. Neighborhood centers; and 8. Zoning, etc. The report conveyed that NCPPC generally adopted the McMillan Plan recommendations and determined that developing a regional park system was the most urgent implementation activity. Specifically, it identified a lower Potomac shoreline project between Washington and Mount Vernon, VA; a Potomac River gorge park; a broader Potomac River and Chesapeake & Ohio Canal reservation; an Anacostia River park system; an extension of Rock Creek Park into Maryland; and a water supply reservoir. Recognizing that population growth and other conditions evolved since the McMillan Plan, NCPPC also developed two major new projects: Neighborhood Recreation Centers and the Fort Boulevard. The report identified several additional projects along watersheds, including Piney Branch which it noted encompassed a historic Native American quarry. The annual report noted the successful development of counterpart agencies that would help to facilitate and advance NCPPC’s goals. Virginia formed a state planning commission and Maryland established the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.\n\ncode53\n\nMaps National Mall and Core Regional Planning Transportation Waterfronts Zoning and Housing\n\nPreliminary Transit Report: Washington, DC\n\nNovember 1927\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nIn this report to NCPPC, Harland Bartholomew & Associates proposed two alternative transit plans.

Its “Intermediate Plan” combined “through-routes” streetcar lines, with the intent to reduce inefficiencies stemming from two separate streetcar systems and amend traditional routing practices that looped or “stub-ended” in congested areas. Its “Ultimate Plan” encompassed the intermediate recommendations and several broader improvements. Recognizing that completion of the Federal Triangle and Arlington Bridge projects would increase transportation demand south of the White House and west of 15th Street, this plan recommended tunnelling under the Ellipse and improving B Street (Constitution Avenue) to provide a wide, continuous east-west route on downtown’s south end. Later, in its 1927 Annual Report, NCPPC noted giving “special thought to streetcar facilities” but opposed any surface car lines on B Street “because it would impede car and bus traffic.”\n\ncode55\n\nMaps Transportation\n\nA Report Upon a Major Thoroughfare System and Traffic Circulation Problems of Washington\n\nDecember 1927\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nThis report prepared by Harland Bartholomew & Associates for NCPPC surveyed the city’s transportation system and recommended a five-tiered roadway...\n\nThis report prepared by Harland Bartholomew & Associates for NCPPC surveyed the city’s transportation system and recommended a five-tiered roadway system. NCPPC, led by Commissioner J. C. Nichols, was cognizant of surging automobile use and increasingly intensive urban functions within suburban areas. Earlier leaders envisioned that the 1893 Highway Act would establish “a permanent system of highways.” However, deviations from the associated 1898 Highway Plan became routine. Builders encountered difficulties applying the 1898 plan to the undulating terrain, while homebuyers conveyed interest in curvilinear streets that weren’t necessarily contiguous. To address the identified problems, the report proposed a five-tiered roadway system: 1. Radials to the dominant center e.g., Massachusetts Avenue, Connecticut Avenue, 16th Street, Bladensburg Road, New York Avenue, Benning Road, and Pennsylvania Avenue, SE. 2. Direct connections between subcenters, or inter-center routes e.g., Conduit Road, Wisconsin Avenue, New Hampshire Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, and East Capitol Street. 3. Bypass routes around points of possible congestion e.g., Iowa, Alaska, and Idaho Avenues. 4. Gross routes or interchange routes e.g., Columbia Road. 5. Minor streets.\n\ncode54\n\nMajor Plans Maps Transportation\n\nA Major Thoroughfare Plan\n\nJanuary 1928\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nThis plan conceived a “comprehensive system of wide, direct arteries in which the vital traffic flow of the community may freely move.” Following earlier...\n\nThis plan conceived a “comprehensive system of wide, direct arteries in which the vital traffic flow of the community may freely move.” Following earlier studies, including “A Report Upon a Major Thoroughfare System” and “Traffic Circulation Problems of Washington,” the plan identified three major thoroughfares: radial arteries, interchange routes, and cross-town routes. It distinguished radial arteries into a primary and secondary classification, with the former being District of Columbia sections of the primary regional highways. The interchange routes facilitated shifts between the arterial corridors. NCPPC envisioned that cross-town routes would provide better east-west connectivity north of the historic L’Enfant City grid. High bridge crossings over Rock Creek Park would align with corridors identified by the Olmstead brothers in 1918.\n\ncode60\n\nMajor Plans Maps Transportation\n\n“Round Points” in the Plan of Washington\n\nJanuary 1928\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nIn this paper, NCPPC’s Charles Eliot explores the open spaces anchoring star-shaped intersections that characterize the Plan of Washington (the L’Enfant...\n\nIn this paper, NCPPC’s Charles Eliot explores the open spaces anchoring star-shaped intersections that characterize the Plan of Washington (the L’Enfant and McMillan Plans). Eliot relayed that L’Enfant distinguished sites on the “most advantageous ground commanding the most extensive prospects:” e.g., Dupont, Washington, Iowa, and Thomas Circles. Eliot noted that the concave vistas that radiated along avenues, to points (e.g., to and from the White House) brought unity to the corridor, regardless of architectural variance was expressed in the street wall (L’Enfant’s “reciprocity of sight”). L’Enfant designed sites “proportional in magnitude to the number of avenues leading to them.” Unfortunately, Elliot noted, corresponding sites developed later are either poorly located or disproportionately sized. “We have Grant Circle sliding down a hillside, and Sherman Circle sunk in a hollow.” Rather than closing a vista, they are “incidents along the way” – so large as to disrupt the street composition. “From the traffic standpoint,” Eliot noted, “a four-way intersection seldom justifies gyratory control, and a circle is hardly an accurate expression in design of the end of the avenue.”\n\ncode76\n\nCommemoration National Mall and Core Parks Transportation\n\nPark System of the District of Columbia\n\nJanuary 1928\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nFollowing several earlier studies and reports, NCPPC delineated its plan for the District’s Park System in its 1928 Annual Report.

The plan incorporated two project categories: Neighborhood Recreation Facilities and City Parks. NCPPC’s neighborhood recreational facilities concept followed a study of Chicago’s parks conducted by Commissioner Frederick L. Olmstead and the University of Chicago (summarized in NCPPC’s 1928 Annual Report supplement, “Plans and Studies Washington and Vicinity”). With housing demand, automobile volume, and recreational barriers intensifying, NCPPC concluded that it was no longer tenable to assume children’s physical exercise demands could be fulfilled in underutilized streets, vacant lots, and unused private open spaces. The report grouped a set of more broadly oriented park facilities into four groups: Rock Creek Park Stream Valleys, Fort Drive, Potomac River Parkways, and miscellaneous undertakings (e.g., valley acquisitions to reduce storm sewer demands).\n\ncode84\n\nInfrastructure and Services Maps National Mall and Core Parks Transportation Waterfronts\n\nThe Regional Park Projects\n\nJanuary 1928\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nNCPC presented five regional parks, planned around natural, scenic and historic resources.

While most of the units consisted of small children's playgrounds, it featured a smaller number of major recreation centers. To facilitate planning and implementation, NCPPC established the Committee on the Recreation System for Washington (later becoming the Committee for Coordination of Plans for the District of Columbia Recreation System, before its 1962 dissolution). Charles Elliot advised the committee, which included members from all local and federal agencies that contributed to Washington’s recreation, school, and library facilities. As described in its 1931 Annual Report, NCPPC recommended 25 10-20 acre recreation centers, together with multiple smaller playgrounds, scattered through the area served by each center. Recreation centers that served all age groups would be spaced at approximate two-mile intervals and local playgrounds would be arranged at quarter-mile intervals. Where possible, recreation centers would be arranged next to high schools, junior-high schools, and/or branch libraries, while local playgrounds would be co-located with elementary schools. Maps distinguished White and “Colored” (Black) facilities. The plan advanced Elliot’s 1929 proposal to officially differentiate between parks owned and maintained by the municipal government and those by the federal government. Parks were to be “more than local service, each more or less unique, and such as are appropriate to the Capital of the United States.\"\n\ncode32\n\nInfrastructure and Services Maps Parks\n\nMaintenance and Operation of the Washington, D.C.

It found that Washington had 438 reservations that are one acre or less, of which 342 are “improved:” 106 reservations between one-quarter to one acre, of which 72 are “improved;” and 41 reservations between one to five acres, of which 22 are improved. Out of the 41 large reservations, 28 are between five and 25 acres. Noting that it cost approximately $164 per acre to cut grass at large parks such as Lafayette, Lincoln, and Garfield– as compared to approximately $289 per acre for smaller spaces, such as Dupont and Iowa Circles – the report noted concerns with the government managing a high proportion of small parks. It suggested that small center “parkings” and circles within development subdivisions were of more interest to developers selling properties.\n\ncode59\n\nInfrastructure and Services Parks\n\nStudy for System of Airports: Washington and Environs\n\nDecember 1928\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nThis study recommended a four-tiered system of airports, including the siting of what became Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

NCPPC described the study, which it submitted to the Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions, in its 1929 annual report. “For the central airport, sites at Gravelly Point for commercial use, and at Bolling Field extended for military use, are shown on the plan.” NCPPC particularly suggested Gravelly Point. It recommended several “emergency landing fields” near the central airport and a secondary ring of “auxiliary fields” suitable for local use or schools. Fifteen to 30 miles from the central airport, “intermediate fields” would provide [airline] service along principal roadways. In 1929, through Public Law 1806) Congress authorized the extension of Bolling Field and through Resolution 106the formation of a special congressional committee on an airport for Washington (Res. No. 106). Spurred by wartime exigencies, and tired of Congressional delays, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced in 1938 that a central airport would be built at Gravelly Point.

NCPPC conveyed the committee’s report in its supplement to its 1930 annual report, “Reports and Plans Washington Region.” Among its conclusions, the Committee suggested that Congress call for experts to advise on a treatment plant for Washington. It noted “[t]he condition of the [Potomac] river is a matter of great economic interest to the shellfish industry as well as to the people of the Washington region.” The report highlighted several recommendations: 1.

President Herbert Hoover conveyed a supportive message, while the Governors of Maryland and Virginia provided verbal remarks. The American Society of Landscape Architects, which subsequently devoted its whole annual meeting to the topic, adopted seven supportive resolutions. The 1930 annual report reflected an expanding agency program. In addition to new activities related to the Capper-Crampton Act, several sections addressed roadway and building development. NCPPC proposed standard street cross sections, including sidewalk widths and street tree spacing. It encouraged the Zoning Commission to restrict buildings to no higher than the width of the street. Reflecting concerns with street capacity in the core, the report called for Federal Triangle buildings to accommodate employee and visitor parking demand. It also recommended a well-coordinated program of bridges and entries to the District.\n\ncode102\n\nFederal Development Infrastructure and Services Maps National Mall and Core Parks Regional Planning Transportation Zoning and Housing\n\nPublic Buildings Act of 1930\n\nMarch 1930\n\nSeventy-First U.S. Congress\n\nPublic Law No. 85, commonly known as the Keyes-Elliot Bill, amended the Public Buildings Act of 1926 to authorize an additional $100 million for public...\n\nPublic Law No. 85, commonly known as the Keyes-Elliot Bill, amended the Public Buildings Act of 1926 to authorize an additional $100 million for public building construction in Washington and extended the area within which the government could purchase for development, including a portion in Southwest Washington. The Washington Post mapped NCPPC's plan in relation to the Act. (see Article). NCPPC noted in its 1930 annual report that the public law generally reflected the agency’s recommendations. The amendment also increased the ability of federal agencies to contract with private architects, which facilitated a broader range of federal building architecture.\n\ncode334\n\nFederal Development Legislation National Mall and Core\n\nReports and Plans of the Washington Region: National Capital Park and Planning Commission Supplement\n\nMarch 1930\n\nNational Capital Park and Planning Commission\n\nThis supplement to NCPPC’s 1930 Annual Report began with a textual record of the annual report presentation, including a message from President Herbert...\n\nThis supplement to NCPPC’s 1930 Annual Report began with a textual record of the annual report presentation, including a message from President Herbert Hoover.

The report (which followed 1914 Congressional legislation calling for the elimination of alley housing by 1918) found that “The primary purpose of the National Capital is…to provide facilities for carrying on the Federal Government's work. The development of the city should be such that this work can be carried on with the greatest possible efficiency and economy...The Government's buildings and the city, which is the environment of those buildings, should be dignified, spacious, comfortable-for both the Government buildings and the Capital City typify to us and to foreigners alike the standards and the aspirations of the American people. There should be nothing here that is mean or small or degrading.” Space-related concerns reflected emerging automobile congestion along with interest in automobile garages, parks, and private yards. The report recommended that alley clearance activities should replace dwellings and effectively reutilize land for public purposes. Land reutilization should uphold neighborhood fabric and best serve public welfare. A “constructive program,” it noted, would reflect schools, playgrounds, small parks, and other public building efforts. After Congress passed the District of Columbia Alley Dwelling Act in 1934, Ihlder became director of the DC Alley Dwelling Authority. The report included some race-based data, specifically, statistics on the number of White versus “Colored” (Black) deaths per 100,000 residents, and rehousing efforts.\n\ncode25\n\nInfrastructure and Services Urban Renewal Zoning and Housing\n\nShipstead-Luce Act\n\nApril 1930\n\nSeventy-First Congress\n\nAuthorized the U.

Commission of Fine Arts’ (CFA) review of private and semi-public buildings within District of Columbia areas of significant federal interest, including the height, appearance, color, and texture of materials for exterior construction. CFA’s 1910 enabling legislation limited its review to the siting of statues, fountains, and monuments on public property. Concerned with the nature of development and the slow pace of public land acquisition, particularly with respect toward the McMillan Plan, NCPPC led a multi-year advocacy effort that culminated in this act. NCPPC Secretary Fred G.

The act, including sections providing a 50-50 funding basis, served as a model for similar grant programs later instituted in other parts of the country. The act represented one of several legislative efforts to implement the McMillan Plan. During the late 1920s, NCPPC and its predecessor developed a regional park plan which encompassed McMillan plan recommendations. However, implementation lagged due to acquisition costs. U.S. House Representative and NCPPC ex officio member Louis Crampton and Senator Arthur Capper (who also had a crucial role in forming DC’s Alley Dwelling Authority) co-sponsored the legislation. Implementation represented a significant amount of NCPPC’s focus during the 1930s. Maryland and Virginia’s need for federal acquisition approval and their relatively undeveloped planning staffs resulted in NCPPC assuming a large measure of responsibility for suburban planning. The act’s legacy includes the George Washington Memorial Parkway, and a significant proportion of the District’s park and recreation properties. The act enabled the acquisition of multiple stream valleys, including Anacostia River and Rock Creek tributaries and headwaters in Maryland. Apart from the Mount Vernon Parkway, parkway acquisition lagged in Virginia, attributable to the slower pace of development and its regional planning organization. A significant proportion of land acquired pursuant to the act occurred by 1933; after which, the economic depression refocused government activity.\n\ncode2\n\nLegislation Parks Regional Planning\n\nReport on the Motor Vehicle and Street Traffic Problem of the District of Columbia:\n\nJanuary 1931\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nNCPPC contracted with Dr. Miller McClintock, the director of Harvard University’s Albert Erskine Bureau, for street traffic research to report on emerging...\n\nNCPPC contracted with Dr. Miller McClintock, the director of Harvard University’s Albert Erskine Bureau, for street traffic research to report on emerging transportation complexities. The growth of private motor vehicles brought challenges related to the “safe and expeditious movement of street traffic.” The District Commissioners asked NCPPC to review the conclusions of a Traffic Advisory Committee chaired by D.C. Highway Engineer Captain H.C. Whitehurst. The report considered street-traffic control and motor vehicle administration within the framework of the District’s local and state-level frameworks. It recommended that Congress and the District adopt multiple legislative and administrative measures. In February 1931, Congress authorized a District of Columbia Department of Vehicles and Traffic (Public No. 742) and authorized the District to make motor vehicle and traffic control regulations (see Hearings and Act). The District of Columbia Department of Transportation traces its origin to this department (see DDOT).\n\ncode332\n\nInfrastructure and Services Transportation Zoning and Housing\n\nThe Preparation of Zoning Ordinances\n\nJuly 1931\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce\n\nThe Department of Commerce published this pamphlet by its Advisory Committee on City Planning and Zoning to advise municipalities on formulating zoning codes,...\n\nThe Department of Commerce published this pamphlet by its Advisory Committee on City Planning and Zoning to advise municipalities on formulating zoning codes, especially inaugural ordinances. This followed the committee’s development of standard planning and zoning enabling acts in the 1920s.

Among other guidance, it conveyed the concept developed by Harland Bartholomew that zoning ordinances should be developed in accordance with a comprehensive plan.\n\ncode114\n\nZoning and Housing\n\nThe President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership: Committee on Housing and the Communi\n\nDecember 1931\n\nHerbert Hoover Presidential Administration\n\nThis conference report conveyed strategies for the federal government to increase home building and ownership, including by facilitating long-term, amortized...\n\nThis conference report conveyed strategies for the federal government to increase home building and ownership, including by facilitating long-term, amortized mortgages; lower interest rates; reducing construction costs; and indirectly supporting low-income families. Significantly higher home mortgage defaults and corresponding decreases in residential housing investment characterized this Great Depression period. Many middle-class families experienced impoverishment for the first time. The conference assembled several hundred specialists into 31 specialized committees. Former NCPPC Chair Frederic A. Delano, president of the American Civic Association led the City Planning and Zoning Committee. NCPPC consultant Harland Bartholomew, president of the National Conference on City Planning, chaired the Subdivision Layout Committee. NCPPC consultant John Ihlder, executive director of Pittsburgh Housing Association chaired the Types of Dwellings Committee. Abram Garfield, a U.S. Commission of Fine Arts member led the Blighted Areas and Slums Committee. Nannie H. Burroughs, president of National Training School for Women and Girls on Washington chaired the Negro Housing Committee. The Subdivision Layout Committee recommended that all new neighborhoods should have ‘appropriate restrictions.’ To define ‘appropriate,’ the Bartholomew report referred conference participants to an earlier document, a 1928 review of deeds showing that thirty-eight of forty recently constructed developments barred sale to or occupancy by African Americans. The review observed that racial exclusion clauses were ‘in rather general use in the vicinity of the larger eastern and northern cities which have experienced an influx of colored people in recent years.” The conference adopted a resolution endorsing the President’s proposal for a system of home loan discount banks.\n\ncode181\n\nZoning and Housing\n\nFlood protection – “B” Street, South\n\nMarch 1932\n\nNational Capital Park and Planning Commission\n\nNCPPC’s chairman Ulysses S.

Grant, 3rd addressed a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers letter requesting views on a proposal to raise B Street, South (Independence Avenue, SW) to protect the Federal Triangle, among other areas. Following an 1889 flood, studies recommended a barrier 20 feet above sea level. Noting that it would be difficult to construct a reliable temporary levee of more than five feet, Grant suggested reconstructing B Street at an elevation of not less than 19 feet. An April 18 report by NCPPC’s landscape architect Thomas C. Jeffers contemplated three design possibilities (see Report). Two involved realigning B Street between the Ericsson Memorial and the U.S. Agriculture Building (at 14th Street, NW). The third involved “an ingenious idea” to erect hinged slabs along the sidewalk of South B Street to reduce the amount the street would need to be raised. Four days later the chief of NCPPC’s engineering division advised the solution is a levee at the approximate location of the present 17th Street levee closure (see Memorandum). It would be constructed when the government removed the “temporary” war-time buildings.\n\ncode335\n\nFederal Development Infrastructure and Services National Mall and Core Parks Transportation\n\nHousing Study\n\nMarch 1932\n\nJohn Ihlder\n\nFollowing Washington’s development of planning and zoning functions, this report to NCPPC advocated for better housing standards.

It reveals perceptions of the period and of the author. For example, one section on improvement methods lists three obstacles to any rebuilding scheme for “Negros” housing: “1. A lack of desire among a large portion of the population for something better than they are accustomed to. 2. The conviction among most landlords that Negroes as a class, are poor tenants. 3. The general public apathy and lack of understanding of the Negro’s problems.” It figures, [i]f it were possible to create among the negro masses a real desire for decent accommodations, the slums would automatically eliminate themselves as it would be impossible for the owner of rundown property to obtain tenants unless he made such improvements that would attract them.…All of which leads to the conclusion that some form of large-scale slum clearance and rehabilitation is the only real cure.”\n\ncode182\n\nZoning and Housing\n\nReconstruction Finance Corporation and Slum Clearance in the District of Columbia\n\nOctober 1932\n\nNational Capital Park and Planning Commission\n\nRecognizing the costs involved in clearing land and rehousing residents, this report contemplates how Washington could utilize the Corporation’s authorities...\n\nRecognizing the costs involved in clearing land and rehousing residents, this report contemplates how Washington could utilize the Corporation’s authorities to improve housing conditions.

It notes NCPPC’s authorities, members, and recent activities: from transportation plans, land acquisition, technical services, to project coordination and legislation.\n\ncode340\n\nNational Mall and Core Regional Planning\n\nNational Housing Act (1934)\n\nJanuary 1934\n\nSeventy-Third U.S Congress\n\nPublic Law 73-479 created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) with the authority to insure long-term mortgage loans made by private lending institutions...\n\nPublic Law 73-479 created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) with the authority to insure long-term mortgage loans made by private lending institutions on homes and rental housing, and to insure lenders against loss on smaller loans financing home alterations, repair, and other improvements. Part of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal program, the act’s two central policy goals were to: 1) create an economically sound, publicly sponsored, mortgage insurance system; and 2) revive the residential construction industry that collapsed during the Great Depression. In addition to FHA, it established the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation under the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which administered deposit insurance for savings and loan institutions in the United States, a function Congress transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1989. It also authorized the chartering of national mortgage associations to provide a secondary mortgage market. The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae) was originally chartered under this authority. The act had significant, but disparate, impacts on residents and development patterns. In advancing the single, low down payment, long-term, low interest rate amortized mortgage, real estate became a major source of wealth for some Americans. To encourage (particularly to insure) “economically sound” loans, as the act specified, many went toward new construction, especially to White families in developing suburban areas.\n\ncode184\n\nLegislation Zoning and Housing\n\nDC Alley Dwelling Act\n\nJune 1934\n\nSeventy-Third Congress\n\nAuthorized the U.S. President to designate an agency to clear alley dwellings and redevelop this land for any purpose that served the city. President...\n\nAuthorized the U.S. President to designate an agency to clear alley dwellings and redevelop this land for any purpose that served the city. President Herbert Hoover recognized the Federal Triangle and the expansion of the Legislative Group around the U.S. Capitol as successful examples of replacing dilapidated dwellings. First Ladies Ellen Wilson and Eleanor Roosevelt were also actively engaged in efforts to end Washington’s alley dwellings. The legislation built on a 1918 law that focused on housing war workers and represented the first federal legislation providing housing for low-income families. In establishing an Alley Dwelling Authority (ADA) that utilized eminent domain to clear and replace dwellings the 1934 act was considered pioneer public housing legislation. Previously, dilapidated housing was simply condemned and demolished. The ADA essentially became the nation’s first local housing authority. NCPPC advocated for this act in various ways, including John Ihlder’s 1930 housing report. From 1934-1943, the ADA functioned as a federally controlled special authority. Ordered in 1941 to prioritize housing for war workers, it and the U.S. Housing Authority constructed Barry Farm Dwellings, among other projects. The ADA later evolved into the DC Housing Authority which is now an independent DC Government agency. Congress repealed the 1934 act’s alley dwelling ban in 1955, following zoning complications and concerns from residents in relatively prosperous areas who had improved alley dwellings. Similar to later urban renewal efforts, clearing alley dwellings disproportionally impacted low-income and/or minority residents.\n\ncode33\n\nFederal Development Legislation Urban Renewal Zoning and Housing\n\nExperiences with Zoning in Washington, DC 1920-1934\n\nJanuary 1935\n\nS.G.

It noted that the prevailing “preponderance of the \"A\" areas reflects both the popularity of the restriction and the bias of the Zoning Commission in favor of home (residential) Sections.” However, it noted “serious overcrowding in zones allowing apartment houses. It noted that the “down-town district is on the down grade, old, settled sections surrounding it touched by obsolescence.” Quoting a 1934 Harland Bartholomew speech, it concluded that too many residential areas were designated for commercial and industrial use. The report recommended multiple revisions, with the most significant being administrative reform. Noting the volume of cases petitioning for exceptions, the report suggested an adjustment board as contemplated by the Standard Zoning Enabling Act. In 1938, Congress expanded the District of Columbia Zoning Commission’s authority, and authorized a Board of Zoning Adjustment.\n\ncode46\n\nInfrastructure and Services Maps Transportation Urban Renewal Zoning and Housing\n\nThe Value of a Highway Plan and Program to a Municipality\n\nJanuary 1935\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nIn this presentation to the American Road Builder’s Association convention, NCPPC’s Director of Planning reported on the value of highway...\n\nIn this presentation to the American Road Builder’s Association convention, NCPPC’s Director of Planning reported on the value of highway planning.

Bartholomew conveyed underlying concerns that “overcrowding” and “blight,” which he found to be associated with apartment buildings and older areas of the city, may affect broader sections of the city. He observed some unintended consequences of early zoning. For example, an early amendment to DC’s code to establish a residential district prohibiting apartment buildings had unintentionally created (overcrowded) apartment districts, and as he noted, were in most of Anacostia. He recommended that DC adopt a single map; a single set of districts combining use, height, and area regulations; and lot occupancy/population density controls.\n\ncode103\n\nLegislation Zoning and Housing\n\nDinner…in Honor of the Senate and House (Congressional) Committees on D.C and Public Buildings...\n\nMay 1936\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nThis program highlighted an event, including “exhibits, motion pictures and lantern slides” that NCPPC’s chairman Frederic A.

It authorized a new U.S. Housing Authority to provide loans and other assistance to state and local agencies for low-rent housing and slum clearance projects. A 1932 Harland Bartholomew report on cities served as a basis for formulating the Act’s guidelines. Bartholomew’s theoretical and empirical analyses suggested that the housing solution for American cities was “horizontal” (characterized by low-rise buildings), especially with terraced houses for lower-income classes and detached houses for the higher-income classes.\n\ncode10\n\nLegislation Urban Renewal Zoning and Housing\n\nFederal Highway Map\n\nFebruary 1938\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nPresident Franklin D.

Roosevelt marked five transcontinental routes (in blue) on a 1935 U.S. highway system map showing the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved U.S. numbered highways (in red). The United States’ Interstate Highway System was initially conceived as a network of tolled “superhighways” or expressways, that would be rented or sold to combine with toll revenue to pay the bills, including the use of right-of-way. Recognizing that the roadway concept would also create jobs while mitigating federal costs, President Roosevelt dictated a memorandum as early as 1934. In February 1938, after proposals stalled, the President met with the Bureau of Public Roads’ (the Federal Highway Administration predecessor) director. Asking for a feasibility study, the President conveyed this routing map. It envisioned intercity routes that ended before the terminal points. For example, the route approaching Washington, DC ended in a junction in Virginia. The Bureau submitted its report to the White House in April. Having heard of the study, Congress requested a similar report in its July 1938 Federal-Aid Highway Act.\n\ncode42\n\nMaps Transportation\n\nZoning Act of 1938\n\nJune 1938\n\nSeventy-Fifth Congress\n\nThis act expanded the DC Zoning Commission’s authority, which was established by the Zoning Act of 1920.

It authorized the Commission to promulgate regulations that were consistent with a Comprehensive Plan designed to meet prevailing public goals. To advise the Commission on zoning text or map amendments, it specified a three-member Zoning Advisory Council, that included an NCPPC representative. It also established a five-member Board of Zoning Adjustment, which included one NCPPC member. The Act noted that its provisions did not apply to federal properties, which were subject to NCPPC review and approval.\n\ncode13\n\nLegislation Zoning and Housing\n\nFederal-Aid Highway Act of 1938\n\nJune 1938\n\nSeventy-Fifth US Congress\n\nPublic No. 75-584 expanded the authorities for those governing the District’s , among other provisions.

The Federal Highway Act of 1921 designated two highway classes eligible for federal-aid funds: primary or interstate and secondary or intercounty, with the total limited to seven percent of the rural road mileage within each state. Recognizing the District was entirely urban, the 1938 Act exempted it from the mileage clause. Another provision enabled the District to receive federal highway funding, similar to how states receive them. This enabled the District to commence a regular road planning program, releasing its first highway plan in 1941. This was a more specialized and strong-minded highway effort compared to the 1893 highway plan and NCPPC’s 1930 thoroughfare plan. Nationally, the act authorized the use of regular federal-aid funds for highway landscaping and to eliminate road and railway grade crossings. It requested the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads report on the feasibility of a nationwide network of six tolled superhighways. The resulting Reporting in Toll Roads and Free Roads (1939) showed that demand was insufficient and the Bureau recommended a non-toll network. Access would be limited; within large cities, the routes would be depressed or elevated. Where traffic was modest, the network would utilize existing roadways.\n\ncode183\n\nLegislation Transportation\n\nMap of the Metropolitan Area of Washington, DC: Showing Division…into Residential Sub-Areas\n\nJune 1938\n\nFederal Housing Administration\n\nTo facilitate “economically sound” loans, as Congress authorized, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) developed this racially discriminating...\n\nTo facilitate “economically sound” loans, as Congress authorized, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) developed this racially discriminating map. Lengthy underwriting manuals detailed FHA’s techniques for determining mortgages insurance eligibility under its authorizing legislation. Appraisals included ratings of the borrower, property, and neighborhood. The 1938 manual specified eight criteria, and associated weights, for rating neighborhoods: “relative economic stability; protection from adverse influences; freedom from special hazards; adequacy of civic, social, and commercial centers; adequacy of transportation; sufficiency of utilities and conveniences; level of taxes and special assessments; and appeal.” Most of the weight was associated with the first two categories. A reoccurring neighborhood analysis principle was \"inharmonious racial or nationality groups.\" The 1938 manual noted: If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes. A change in social or racial occupancy generally contributes to instability and a decline in values. The manual recommended \"enforced zoning, subdivision regulations, and suitable restrictive covenants,” (the latter of which the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated in its 1948 Shelley v. Kraemer decision.) The manual advised underwriters to use FHA maps and other data sources to “check probable eligibility of locations.” Maps defined multiple grades of neighborhood quality. FHA described the grades for this 1937 map in an associated Housing Market Analysis document. Two of the lowest grades emphasized the presence of Black residents; “Type F” is “showing the effects of negro occupancy” and “Type H” does “not include sections originally intended for white occupancy and now occupied by negroes.” Other FHA maps used a color-coded grading, with the “Red” category similar to Type H; this practice later became known as “red-lining.”\n\ncode185\n\nMaps Zoning and Housing\n\nThe Rehabilitation of Southwest Washington as a War Housing Measure\n\nJanuary 1939\n\nArther Goodwillie\n\nIn conjunction with John Ihlder, the Washington Housing Association, Howard University faculty, and the District of Columbia Commissioners, Goodwillie laid out...\n\nIn conjunction with John Ihlder, the Washington Housing Association, Howard University faculty, and the District of Columbia Commissioners, Goodwillie laid out the case for developing war housing in Southwest Washington. Arthur Goodwillie led the Conservation Service of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, a government-sponsored corporation that President Franklin Roosevelt established in 1933 to refinance home mortgages in default. In line with the government’s emphasis on resource conservation, it proposed considering existing housing in old neighborhoods as resources. Using property assessment data, the memorandum demonstrated it would cost less to rehabilitate than raze Southwest’s buildings (fronting the street) . The memo also conveyed that greater housing density could be achieved by constructing apartment houses in the interiors of city blocks where alley dwellings stood. Goodwillie, who consulted with NCPPC as he prepared the memo, formally presented it to NCPPC in 1942. NCPPC used its diagrams in a 1942 report and the 1950 comprehensive plan, Washington Present and Future. NCPPC’s 1950 work is set within the framework of the more intensive 1945 and 1949 Redevelopment Acts.\n\ncode34\n\nFederal Development Maps Urban Renewal Zoning and Housing\n\nProposed Recreation System: District of Columbia\n\nMarch 1939\n\nNational Capital Park & Planning Commission\n\nThis illustrated the recreation system plan with revisions to 1939, including “White” and “Colored” (Black) recreation centers, as recommended to NCPPC...\n\nThis illustrated the recreation system plan with revisions to 1939, including “White” and “Colored” (Black) recreation centers, as recommended to NCPPC in 1930 by its multi-agency recreation committee. The Great Depression stalled facility development after a productive period of planning. In a 1933 executive order, President Franklin Roosevelt transferred management of the District’s parks to the newly established National Park Service Office of National Capital Parks (NCP). Two years later, NCP received a $1,000,000 allocation from the Public Works Administration. Later that year, NCP, NCPPC, the District of Columbia Commissioners , and the District Board of Education created the District of Columbia Recreation Committee to coordinate facility development. To reassert its planning function, NCPPC commissioned a comprehensive analysis of Washington’s recreation system. Authored by Lebert Howard Weir, the 1934 “National Recreation Association Report on Public Recreation in Washington, DC and Environs” found the system woefully inadequate. It recommended establishing more effective and unified administration, as well as 91 new playgrounds.\n\ncode212\n\nMaps Parks\n\nMemorandum on 110’ Building Height Zoning District Regulations\n\nNovember 1940\n\nHarland Bartholomew\n\nDocument summary coming soon.
