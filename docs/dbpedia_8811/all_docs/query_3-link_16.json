        "text": "The crudely lettered sign on the pushcart at Third Avenue and 29th Street says: “The hot dog man is in the candy stand.” Correct; he is don't know why anyone should take a quizzical attitude toward that simple statement of fact. But several things in my neighborhood puzzle me. In the A & J supermarket at Second Avenue and 30th Street, Jake Rabinowitz says: “I work the half‐day shift—from 12 to 12.” Absolutely correct; twelve hours is half of twenty‐four.\n\nThe ownership of Kips Bay Towers, where I live, is also complicated. William Zeckendorf—who is or was, gather, not William Zeckendorf but Webb and Knapp—built these elitist apartment houses in 1961. About ten years ago he or they sold them to Alcoa, which is in the aluminum business. Last September Zeckendorf, father and son, overcome with nostalgia, bought them back. But that was ages ago; time goes fast in the real estate business. Frankly, I don't know who owns them now, although I have been told that University Centers, Inc., owns them and (are you ready for this?) owned them originally.\n\nIt's impossible to be sure of all the facts because real estate is a maze that cannot be understood by a civilian. All I'm sure of is that once month we send all our accumulated savings, not to the proprietors, but to Mehlman Management Corporation in Elmhurst to be applied against our rent. Otherwise, everything is the same except that the name of the project has been changed from Kips Bay Plaza to Kips Bay Towers and the package room has been moved into the basement where it was originally. Is this a rational world or is it fantasy?\n\nSince I last wrote about this neighborhood—and I apologize for the delay—things have been normal, which is to say relaxed. There has been one epochal change. The four Affronti sisters have sold the family pastry shop on Second Avenue and retired into their apartment upstairs. The shop was in the family for seventy years and carried on a tradition founded by their great‐grandfather in Palermo. Recently the Affronti sisters have been entertaining a family honeymoon couple. “Where do they come from?” asked. “Palermo!” Josephine replied with a touch of asperity as if I ought to know an obvious thing like that.\n\nIncidentally, the Bayview drug store, under new management, is a roaring success. Apparently there's something “derogatory,” to use Fluther Good's word, about the health or the personal appearance of just about everyone. There is so much stock now that only a ballet dancer could make his way through the store without knocking things off the counters.\n\nRoz and Fred Feldman are still the social arbiters of the neighborhood and the chief source ‘of personal information—otherwise known as gossip. Their sign outside reads “Cards n’ Sweets,” Fred being the card, Roz being the sweet. They have recently moved up one notch in the hierarchy of retailing. They have completely renovated the store—new walls, new counters and racks, new lighting, new equipment, and they have moved the cash register up to the door where they can take closer look at their regular shoplifters.\n\nAlthough they still sell the city newspapers they have eliminated the magazines. People used to read them at the rack but not many people bought them. Magazines are not worth the space or the trouble.\n\nI might note in passing that their son, Larry, recently brought in a classmate from New York University. The classmate assumed that Larry's mother was Larry's sister. Roz was impossible to get along with for several days after that flattering social error.\n\nNearly everybody in the neighborhood is flip. When I walked into Chris Laskas’ flower shop the other day I said he was lucky to be working in such a fragrant atmosphere. “I thought it was me,” he answered went into the Miller Brothers’ ramshackle hardware store to buy a package of vacuum cleaner bags. As Leonard handed them to me and I was about to leave he said: “Before you leave can I ask you a personal question?” “Why, of course,” I said, beginning to feel important and magnanimous. “Have you got 79 cents on your person?” he asked impishly. Don't get pompous in the Miller store.\n\nIn our neghborhood the young generation has considerable enterprise in directions nobody would anticipate. Robert Ohnigian, son of the boss of the Commodore Valet dry cleaning establishment, has graduated from Pratt Institute where he studied art and he is now a painter. He still helps his mother and father in the store but his mind is somewhere else. I saw a copy of D. H. Lawrence's “Sons and Lovers” lying on the counter in the middle of a pile of unclean clothes yesterday, and one of Robert's best paintings—an Armenian church in Russia—hangs by the door. There are always a lot of pictures in the store.\n\nRena Robbins, daughter of Abe and Miriam Robbins of the A & J supermarket, is a brilliant student at the University of Wisconsin. She made Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year and is well up toward 400 in her grades nearly perfect. She has her own ideas of the future. After frantically beating on the doors of several medical schools last winter she has just been accepted by the Downstate Medical Center and will charge into that school next autumn. Everybody around here will be in perfect health when Rena starts making house calls as a qualified doctor.\n\nSince Larry Feldman took his undergraduate work at Baruch College everyone assumed that he would go into the family business. Everybody was wrong. He still helps out in the store but his real job is the teaching of deaf children in the 23d Street School. In May he expects to get his M.A. in education at New York University. He finds teaching deaf children an exciting experience.\n\nSo everything is the same around here—amiable. We did have a bit of a crisis a year or two ago., Jake Rabinowitz got married and tried to stop smoking at the same time. The combi nation nearly finished him. The whole family had to shut the store and go to Florida for a week.\n\nBefore I close perhaps I should report the graffiti on the fence surrounding an excavation at Third Avenue and 29th Street: “Live For God,” “Pray Always,” “Go To Church,” “Read Bible.” In one vestpocket park at 29th Street and Second Avenue one graffito reads: “The devil spelled backwards means lived. Jesus now lives in the hearts and minds of men.”\n\nThat's all for now."
