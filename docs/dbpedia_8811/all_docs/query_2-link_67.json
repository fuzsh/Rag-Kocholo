        "text": "What does a view that costs $45m look like? Is it quietly seductive, or jaw-droppingly loud? Does it beg to be described in metaphors or expletives? Above all, is it worth it? To find out, you have to don a hard hat and ride up to the 38th floor of a new block of apartments being erected by William Lie Zeckendorf and his brother Arthur in the Columbus Circle area of Manhattan.\n\nIf you are wondering about the \"Lie\" in the elder brother's name, here's a short parenthesis. William Lie Zeckendorf's father is a big Manhattan property developer called William Zeckendorf who had a substantial hand in the shaping of Times Square. His grandfather was a legendary Manhattan property developer called William Zeckendorf who once owned the 17-acre site the United Nations building now stands on, as well as the Chrysler building. With antecedents like that, you've got to do something.\n\nThe Zeckendorfs' Fifteen Central Park West is still a year from completion but has already broken the US residential sales record. Eighty per cent of its 201 flats have been sold for a total of $1.4bn. Among the residents-to-be are a small army of hedge fund managers mixed with a sprinkling of celebrities. (Sting and Denzel Washington have been mentioned.)\n\nAnd so to the $45m penthouses. There are two of them; both have been sold, and each occupies an entire storey of the new building.\n\nWilliam Lie Zeckendorf takes me up to look around the 38th-floor penthouse - 8,000 square feet of unenclosed New York air. The apartment is not glazed yet, so we are exposed to the elements with just a strip of netting separating us from the pavement of Central Park West 525 feet below.\n\nThere is dust and rusty scaffolding everywhere, but none of that matters when you take in the View. To the south we look over Columbus Circle and its looming Trump Tower. To the west the canvas widens over the Hudson river and New Jersey beyond. To the north the eye is carried 10 blocks up to the Dakota building, which wears its John Lennon-died-here notoriety with stately indifference. And then there it is, the real $45m view: to the east, over Central Park.\n\nAnd so?\n\nWell, it isn't quietly seductive; it is awe-inspiring in scale and breathtaking as it sweeps along Park Avenue. Nor does it raise its voice; the colours are rich and intense but not loud, dominated by the lush green of the park. Rather, it's the detail that amazes. The sheepless Sheep's Meadow, the baseball fields, the reservoir, are all there to be picked out and wondered at for hours. But is it worth it?\n\nOnly someone with $45m could meaningfully answer that. All I can say is, if the current owner ever gets bored, I'll take it."
