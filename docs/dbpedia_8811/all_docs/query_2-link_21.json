The complaint charged that Postal Service employe Aida Rodriguez, along with Bronx grocers Joseph Rivera, operator of Cosmo Fruits Vegetables, and Andres Collazo, operator of Collazo's Grocery, obtained the stolen cards. Another defendant, Jose Rosado, operator of Rosado's County Fresh Eggs, allegedly took the cards to check-cashing stores which converted them to food stamps.
