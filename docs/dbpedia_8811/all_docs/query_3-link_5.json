        "text": "Mr. Zeckendorf, 54, is a principal, along with his brother, William Lie Zeckendorf, of Zeckendorf Realty, developer of luxury condominiums and retail space in Manhattan, like 15 Central Park West and 18 Gramercy Park, both in partnership with Global Holdings.\n\nThe Zeckendorf brothers also serve as co-chairmen of Terra Holdings, the parent company of several real estate services companies.\n\nInterview conducted and condensed by\n\nVIVIAN MARINO\n\nQ. How do you and William divide up responsibilities for running your companies?\n\nA. Co-chairs, co-owners, equal footing, co-decision-making. I wish he was here for this interview, but apparently you have a policy that you only have one brother at a time.\n\nQ. I’m familiar with your titles, but what is your main focus, or strengths, versus your brother’s?\n\nA. If you look at 15 Central Park West, I might have been more involved in the apartment design and he might have been more involved in the retail. We both work on the lobbies. He might have been more involved in the finance; I was more involved in the construction aspect. But it might’ve been 60-40, versus 50-50.\n\nQ. Speaking of 15 Central Park West, did you ever think it would be as successful as it has been?\n\nA. That was one project that I’ve never lost any sleep on.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
