Summary

A chromogenic photograph by Adrian Gillard, depicting twin men and a boy on the set of "On the Black Hill" (1987). The twin men are dressed in very similar clothing of cardigan, collarless shirt, waistcoat and trousers. They are the actors Mike and Robert Gwilym who play Benjamin and Lewis Jones in the film. Standing between the men is a young boy in dark sweater, shorts and wellington boots. He is actor Rhys Baker, who plays Benjamin aged 6 in the film. They are standing outside a rural building. The twins have been made up so as to look older than their real age of 21 - the film requires them to age several decades. The image is by Adrian Gillard, Stills Photographer for the 1987 British film "On the Black Hill", directed by Andrew Grieve. Further information about the film in General Note.
