My current and ongoing areas of research focus on Welsh film (both Welsh and English language), Welsh film history, contemporary Welsh film, cultural policy and cultural institutions including S4C and the Arts Council of Wales. Current and recent projects include an exploration of location, space and place in Hinterland / Y Gwyll, a study of Welsh language music documentaries, landscape and the concept of the border in the film On the Black Hill (1987), and cultural policy since devolution.
