(You won’t want to miss them!)\n\nPin it for later:\n\nThe 4 Top Attractions to Visit in the Black Hills\n\nWhile countless outdoor (and indoor) attractions exist in the Black Hills, these four are the heavy hitters.\n\n1. Black Hills National Forest\n\n“Entering Black Hills National Forest on Route 87 (Needles Highway)” by daveynin is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nThe Black Hills National Forest is the crown jewel of South Dakota’s outdoor recreation, with over 1.25 million square miles of dense forest, craggy peaks, and pristine mountain streams.\n\nThe national forest has 450+ miles of hiking trails to explore, 30 national forest campgrounds, some of the best fishing in the state, abundant wildlife, and much more!\n\nMany of the hikes, attractions, and places to stay mentioned below are within Black Hills National Forest.\n\nHow much does it cost to go to the Black Hills National Forest?\n\nThe Black Hills National Forest is open year-round, 24 hours a day, and is free to visit.\n\nThere are some spots with a $5/vehicle per day fee, like the Deerfield Reservoir Complex.\n\nA list of areas with day-use fees can be found here.\n\nA Motorized Trail Permit Annual Pass is $25 and required for ATV, motorcycle, 4WD/truck, and UTV off-roading.\n\nYou can order that here.\n\n2. Mount Rushmore National Memorial\n\n“Mount Rushmore” by jimbowen0306 is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nHands down, South Dakota’s most well-known attraction is Mount Rushmore National Memorial, with an estimated two million visitors a year.\n\nThis mountain of rock was famously carved with dynamite into four 60-foot tall busts of our most prominent Commander in Chiefs – Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, to depict the first 150 years of American history.\n\nIt’s an American icon and the biggest (literally) reason that most tourists come to South Dakota.\n\nDoes it cost money to see Mount Rushmore?\n\nMount Rushmore National Memorial has no entrance fees.\n\nThere is, however, a $10 parking fee for cars, motorcycles, and RVs. $5 for seniors. Once purchased, it is good for one year of return visits.\n\nIs Mount Rushmore lit up at night?\n\nSunset is a great time to visit Mount Rushmore. After the sun goes down, lights shine on all four faces and stay on until closing, which varies depending on the time of year.\n\nWhat is the best time to visit Mount Rushmore?\n\nSeason-wise: Fall.\n\n🍁 The leaves are changing, and the crowds are smaller. Spring months can be wet, but April and May are still less crowded and not winter-cold.\n\nTime of day: Sunrise or sunset!\n\n🌅 As far as what time of day, sunrise can be dramatic. While everyone else sleeps in, you can take in the sculpture with the sun peeking out from the mountains and then grab breakfast at Carvers Cafe to start your day.\n\n🌅 Sunset is another excellent option, and you can see the Evening Lighting Ceremony while you’re there, but it will be more crowded than sunrise.\n\nEither way, starting or ending your day here is a great way to go.\n\nHow Far is Mount Rushmore from the Black Hills?\n\nMount Rushmore is in the Black Hills, just outside Keystone (about 30 minutes from Rapid City).\n\n3. Crazy Horse Memorial\n\n“Crazy Horse Memorial” by jimbowen0306 is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nVisiting the Crazy Horse Memorial provides the opportunity to see a sculpture in progress.\n\nThis memorial was commissioned in 1948 by Lakota Chief Henry Standing Bear as a monument of the Lakota warrior Crazy Horse, a prominent figure in the Battle of Little Bighorn, to the Sioux people.\n\nWhen finished, it is expected to dwarf Mount Rushmore at 563 feet and be the largest sculpture in the world.\n\nThe memorial (also home to the Indian Museum of North America, which hosts artifacts from hundreds of Native Nations) is privately funded. Admission fees and donations support the memorial’s creation.\n\n4. Black Elk Wilderness\n\n“Aerial of Black Elk Wilderness” by Black Hills National Forest is marked with Public Domain Mark 1.0 .\n\nBlack Elk Wilderness is easily the wildest place in the Black Hills. No roads exist within Black Elk Wilderness’ 13,000 acres of forest. And only non-mechanized transportation is permitted.\n\nThis wilderness area, wedged between Highways SD 87, SD 244, and US Route 16A, is excellent for backcountry camping, with one- or two-night backpacking trips being the most common.\n\nSeveral trails cross the wilderness to trailheads on the other side. If you have two vehicles, you can use that as an option. Otherwise, it’s best to plan a loop hike.\n\nPeace, quiet, and solitude are findable within this area. However, if you are looking for that, avoiding Harney Peak Trail #9 is advised. This is far and away the area’s most popular route, which heads up to Black Elk Peak (mentioned further down in the hike section of this guide), the highest point in South Dakota.\n\n5 Cave Choices to Visit in the Black Hills Region\n\nThere’s no shortage of caves to explore in the Black Hills. I recommend making sure you visit at least one.\n\nHere’s some information to help you pick which one:\n\n5. Jewel Cave National Monument\n\n“Inside Jewel Cave National Monument – (15096023561)” by Murray Foubister is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 .\n\nWhile Wind Cave (mentioned next) gets more attention as a national park, Jewel Cave is the world’s third-longest cave, with over 200 miles of discovered passageways.\n\nThe cave system was discovered in 1900 and is still being surveyed by researchers.\n\nJewel Cave is more open and prominent in scale, with tours that are smaller in size and have shorter distances between stops.\n\nAn hour-and-a-half-long guided Scenic Tour takes visitors half a mile into the cave, where they can see the shimmering calcite crystals that give the monument its name.\n\nThe tour isn’t too strenuous, but there are several hundred stairs, and the cave floor can be slippery.\n\nTickets for the tour are limited, so purchasing your ticket ahead of time is best.\n\nThere are also two hiking trails outside the cave: a quarter-mile stroll through a field of wildflowers with panoramic views and wildlife viewing that covers the highest point in the park (Roof Trail) and a relatively easy three-and-a-half-mile hike that’s popular for birding, through open meadows surrounded by canyon cliffs (Canyons Trail).\n\nClick here to learn more about 2023 tour options.\n\n6. Wind Cave National Park\n\nWind Cave National Park was the US’ eighth designated national park, the first cave named a national park, and is free to visit.\n\nAnd with over 150 mapped miles, Wind Cave is one of the longest caves in the world.\n\nVisitors tend to regard this cave’s honeycomb-like boxwork features as slightly less beautiful than the jewel-like features found in its neighbor, Jewel Cave.\n\nCave group tours also tend to host more people here than Jewel Cave tours due to a significantly larger number of visitors (because of its National Park status). And it’s a tighter cave.\n\nAll of that said, though, this park is much more than a cave. With over 33,000 acres to explore, this park hosts a ton of open free-range hiking and biking through prairie and forest.\n\nIf you want a planned and marked hike, there are four easy, two moderate, and five strenuous trails within the park (no bikes on these trails).\n\nWind Cave National Park is also prime for seeing bison, elk, pronghorn, coyote, prairie dogs, and birding, and has a campground within the park.\n\nClick here to learn more about 2023 tour options.\n\n7. Rushmore Cave & Rush Mountain Adventure Park in Keystone\n\nIf you can’t get to Wind Cave National Park or Jewel Cave National Monument, Rushmore Cave is the next best thing.\n\nA scenic walking tour of this show cave takes about an hour and is suitable for any age and fitness level.\n\nYou can kick it up a notch in June and July and enjoy some proper cave crawling on your spelunking tour by signing up for an Xpedition Adventure Tour.\n\nAnd while the cave is the original attraction at Rush Mountain Adventure Park, it isn’t the only one anymore.\n\nRush Mountain Adventure Park also hosts a mountain coaster, zipride, an aerial obstacle course, and a 7-D thrill ride.\n\nThere’s something for everyone here, so it’s a good choice for families where everyone might want to do something different.\n\n8. Wonderland Cave\n\nWith their first commercial tours taking place in 1930, if you want to stay close to Rapid City, Wonderland Cave is a good alternative for cave exploration.\n\nYou’ll see a wide variety of crystal formations and boxwork here.\n\n9. Black Hills Caverns\n\nBlack Hills Caverns is another cave option in the Rapid City area, with half-hour and hour-long tour options.\n\nTheir first commercial tour was back in 1939, and they claim to have “the most complete variety of formations that exist in any cave in the Black Hills.”\n\nLearn more about booking a tour here.\n\nThe 2 Best State Parks to Visit in the Black Hills Region\n\nYou won’t want to miss these state parks while in the area.\n\nOne is another major attraction for the Black Hills area, and the other is a state park and a much-respected spiritual destination for many Native American tribes.\n\n10. Custer State Park\n\nCuster State Park is 71,000 acres, which makes it South Dakota’s largest state park.\n\nIt’s one of those rare state parks that could easily be a national park in its own right, with its soaring granite peaks, pristine mountain lakes, and varied wildlife, including donkeys, elk, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and a massive bison herd.\n\nThis article will dig deeper into many of the adventures in the park below, including the Wildlife Loop, Sylvan Lake, and Needles Highway.\n\nA seven-day park entry pass to Custer State Park is $20 per vehicle.\n\n11. Bear Butte State Park\n\n“bear butte poles” by kiszka king is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nDespite being only thirteen minutes northeast of Sturgis, Bear Butte State Park has a vastly different vibe than Sturgis’ roaring motorcycles.\n\nBear Butte is a sacred mountain and spiritual place for many Native American tribes.\n\nHiking the park’s 2.8-mile out-and-back Summit Trail to the top of the butte takes less than an hour and a half, with about a thousand feet of elevation gain. The views from the summit are incredible, with the mighty Black Hills to the west and vast stretches of rolling prairie and plains to the east.\n\nBear Butte State Park is also home to a diverse range of wildlife species, including deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and prairie dogs.\n\nIt costs $8/vehicle to visit.\n\n8 Stunning Hikes to Enjoy in the Black Hills Region\n\nHiking is a fantastic way to see everything the Black Hills has to offer.\n\nHere are a few trails you shouldn’t miss:\n\n12. Thru-Hike The Centennial Trail\n\nThe Centennial Trail is a 123-mile trail stretching across the Black Hills that passes through Wind Cave National Park, Custer State Park, Black Elk Wilderness, Black Hills National Forest, Fort Meade Recreation Area, and Bear Butte State Park.\n\nThis hike is for anyone looking for the biggest bank for your buck thru-hiking adventure in the area.\n\nOn this hike, you’ll encounter open prairie land, pine forests, and granite towers.\n\nIf you’re considering the hike, check out Hiking Centennial Trail: A Guide to Hiking South Dakota’s Centennial Trail as a guidebook option and the Centennial Trail brochure.\n\n13.

The 1-mile loop trail around the lake is epic and provides an Instagram opportunity around every corner.\n\nSylvan Lake’s beauty, surrounded by smooth jutting rocks, pine, and spruce, and its proximity to the Black Elk Peak trailhead, make it easily one of the most popular spots in Custer State Park.\n\nDue to the area’s popularity, it boasts the historic Sylvan Lake Lodge, cabins, a campground, a general store, fine and casual dining options, fishing, hiking trails, a swimming beach, and non-motorized boat rentals.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to see this picture-perfect location hosting weddings or even movie crews, such as National Treasure: Book of Secrets.\n\n14. Roughlock Falls Nature Trail in the Spearfish Canyon Nature Area\n\n“File:Roughlock Falls, Spearfish Canyon, South Dakota.jpg” by KLindblom is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 .\n\nAlltrails Rank: #2 in the Black Hills Area, 4.5\n\nDistance: 2.1 miles\n\nRoute Type: Out & Back\n\nElevation Gain: 242 Feet\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nDuration: 1 hour\n\nPet-Friendly: Dogs are allowed, and there are some off-leash areas.\n\nParking and Fees: Parking is available at the trailhead.

Black Elk Peak and Little Devil’s Tower Loop in the Black Elk Wilderness\n\n“Black Elk Peak, South Dakota” by sbmeaper1 is marked with CC0 1.0 .\n\nAlltrails Rank: #1 in the Black Hills Area, 4.9\n\nDistance: 7.7 mile\n\nRoute Type: Loop\n\nElevation Gain: 1699 Feet\n\nDifficulty: Moderate\n\nDuration: 4 hours\n\nPet-Friendly: Dogs are allowed on leash.\n\nParking and Fees: Parking is available at the trailhead (near Sylvan Lake Beach in Custer State Park).

The large rocks may also be submerged in a waterfall, depending on the season.\n\nOnce you reach the base, you’ll be in a beautiful narrow granite canyon, seeing lots of moss and hiking along a creek.\n\nSince the hike is a loop trail into a canyon, you will also have a steep uphill hike at the end to get back out.\n\n18.

Here are a few of the best:\n\n22. Pactola Reservoir in the Black Hills National Forest\n\n“Pactola Lake at a Glance” by puroticorico is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nPactola Lake is an outdoor lover’s dream. It’s the largest body of water in the Black Hills, so it’s a natural choice for kayaking, boating, water skiing, sailing, or fishing.\n\nIt’s only fifteen miles from Rapid City and has fourteen miles of shoreline, a marina with food, campsites, a swimming beach, trails (including part of the Centennial Trail), and picnic areas.\n\nThe lake’s southeast end has a great swim area, and boat launches are on the northeast, southwest, and northwest sides. The marina has rental options if you’re not traveling with a boat.\n\nSome record-setting lake trout have been caught here, and there’s said to be outstanding fly fishing just below the Pactola Dam’s spillway.\n\nThere’s a $7 fee for parking in the day-use areas around the lake.\n\nThis should be your go-to spot if you need a place to cool off while exploring the Black Hills.\n\n(Sheridan Lake is a comparable lake worth checking out in the area with similar amenities.)\n\n23. Stockade Lake in Custer State Park\n\n“Quiet, Foggy Morning at Stockade Lake” by Dave Bezaire is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 .\n\nWithin Custer State Park, Sylvan Lake gets a lot of visitor concentration.\n\nHowever, Stockade Lake is the largest of the park’s lakes, and it has many of the same amenities, including kayaking, canoeing, fishing, swimming, and hiking options.\n\nIt is also the only lake in the park that allows all boat types.\n\nIf you want to stay in the area, the lake has cabins, RV camping, and tent camping options.\n\nNearby attractions include trails to Cathedral Spires and Little Devil’s Tower, and the Gordon Stockade.\n\n24. Center Lake in Custer State Park\n\n“Center Lake” by U.S. Department of the Interior is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 .\n\nFor those looking to camp, fish, swim, or boat (no wake boating – i.e., kayaks, rowboats, and canoes are okay) within Custer State Park but have a quieter experience, Center Lake is a small alpine lake option with a non-electric campground that supports small RVs and tent camping.\n\nThere’s a 1-mile loop around the lake, a fishing dock, and a swimming beach.\n\n4 Spots to Cool Off in the Black Hills Region\n\n25. Evans Plunge in Hot Springs\n\nEvans Plunge, in Hot Springs, South Dakota, was built all the way back in 1890, making it the Black Hills’ oldest tourist attraction and one of its most popular.\n\nThe mineral-rich hot springs that feed the plunge were once said to have healing powers that could cure everything from gout to skin conditions.\n\nThese days, Evan’s Plunge serves as a great family-friendly outing while cruising the Black Hills’ southern end.\n\nThe pool is naturally heated to a soothing 87 degrees. There’s a jet slide, whale slide, two kids’ pools, hot tubs, and a sauna to luxuriate in after a long day of hiking.\n\n26.

Be sure to follow all safety rules for each of these areas.\n\n29. Spearfish Rock Climbing\n\nThe abundance of steep vertical slab limestone in Spearfish Canyon makes the area admired by rock climbers of all skill levels, with just under 600 rock climbing routes (mostly sport climbing).\n\nPopular climbing areas include the Sunshine Wall, the Elephant Wall, the Dark Side, and Shadowlands.\n\n“Bugs Bunny” at Sunshine on the Bunny Slope wall would be a great starter climb.\n\n30.

Spearfish Canyon National Scenic Byway\n\n“Spearfish Canyon Scenic Byway” by jimmers54 is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nThis eighteen-mile stretch along US Route 14A between Spearfish and Cheyenne Crossing (near Lead), Spearfish Canyon National Scenic Byway, is often called one of America’s most scenic drives (and bike rides).\n\nThe highway traverses the Spearfish Canyon, paralleling Spearfish Creek and providing breathtaking vistas, waterfalls, hiking trails, and opportunities for wildlife viewing along the way.\n\nIt’s a popular route for leisurely drives, photography, and immersing oneself in the tranquility of nature.\n\nFall is the best time to drive the canyon when the thousand-foot-high limestone walls light up with gold, orange, and red shades. The leaves usually start to turn sometime between mid-September and the beginning of October.\n\nAnother option is cycling the scenic byway. The road’s speed limit is only 35 mph, and much of the road has a 4′ wide shoulder on either side.\n\nTraveling south on the road entails a relatively gentle up, averaging a 1.8% grade over 18 miles and gaining 1700 feet in elevation.\n\nAnyone wanting to add 2.5 miles beyond that will have much more of an incline the rest of the way, averaging a 6.4% grade and 800 feet of elevation gain just in those last few miles.\n\n32. Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway\n\n“Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway” by Black Hills National Forest is marked with Public Domain Mark 1.0 .\n\nThe Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway, a 68-mile highway route that traces a figure eight between Keystone and Custer, with the Needles Highway providing a cut-across in the middle, is frequently referred to as one of America’s most scenic drives.\n\nThis byway is comprised of four numbered highways (two of which I’ll go into greater detail about next): SD 87 (Needles Highway), SD 244, US Route 16A (Iron Mountain Road), and SD 89 (or US Route 16/385 as another connector option that includes Crazy HorseMemorial along the way).\n\nAlong the route, you’ll pass through picturesque tunnels, climb spiraling bridges, and make hairpin turns through the craggy peaks of the Black Hills. You’ll also encounter Custer State Park, Black Elk Wilderness, and Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n\nThe views are spectacular, with granite pinnacles framing the route and shaggy mountain goats peering down on its travelers.\n\n33. Needles Highway (SD 87)\n\nNeedles Highway is a 19.5-mile stretch of SD 87 between US Route 385 and US Route 16A.\n\nBut this is no ordinary highway. This route was built with the tourists in mind.\n\nAlong the way, you’ll experience the incredible engineering that went into creating the route while preserving the surrounding beauty. You’ll encounter switchbacks, hairpin turns, and narrow rock tunnels.\n\nPlease be aware of the following clearance restrictions:\n\nNeedles Eye Tunnel: Width: 8’0″ & Height: 9’9″\n\nIron Creek Tunnel: Width: 8’9″ & Height: 10’10”\n\nHood Tunnel: Width: 8’9″ & Height: 9’8″\n\nThe route includes scenic pullovers with stunning views of granite rock spires that resemble needles, canyons, and sometimes even wildlife, including elk, deer, bighorn sheep, and mountain goats.\n\n34. Iron Mountain Road (US Route 16A)\n\n“Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway” by Black Hills National Forest is marked with Public Domain Mark 1.0 .\n\nIn a region full of scenic drives, none are as famous as Iron Mountain Road.\n\nIron Mountain Road is an 18-mile portion of Highway US Route 16A (which runs for 37 miles and passes Custer State Park, Black Elk Wilderness, and Mount Rushmore National Memorial).\n\nThis road is iconic Americana at its finest for two prominent reasons:\n\n🏍️ Three one-lane tunnels that line up with views of Mount Rushmore.\n\nFor a one-of-a-kind photo opportunity, drive Iron Mountain Road from south to north, so you can see Mount Rushmore framed through the one-lane tunnels along the route!\n\nWhile you can see Mount Rushmore from all three tunnels, the Doane Robinson Tunnel provides the best view, where the jet-black tunnel perfectly frames all four presidents on Mount Rushmore as you pass through.\n\nPlease be aware of the following clearance restrictions:\n\nDoane Robinson Tunnel: Width: 12’0″ & Height: 11’4″\n\nC.C. Gideon Tunnel: Width: 13’0″ & Height: 11’0″\n\nScovel Johnson Tunnel: Width: 10’9″ & Height: 11’0″\n\n🏍️ Spiral bridges, known as “pigtail bridges,” that help vehicles tackle elevation changes without disturbing the natural features and stunning scenery.\n\nThe road is twisty on purpose to limit the speed of drivers. With countless curves and twists to navigate, not to mention the occasional bison herd, antelope, or deer spotting, Iron Mountain Road is not the fastest way to get from Point A to Point B, but undoubtedly the most beautiful.\n\nPeter Norbeck, the US Senator who led the way in getting Iron Mountain Road built, once said, “This is not meant to be a super highway, to do the scenery justice you should drive no more than 20 mph and to do it full justice you should simply get out and walk.”\n\n35. Wildlife Loop\n\nThe Wildlife Loop is your best chance to glimpse all the different species living in Custer State Park, including elk, pronghorn, prairie dogs, coyotes, deer, and fan favorites: the “begging burros” and the massive bison herd.\n\nThis 18-mile U-shaped route drive meanders through grasslands and some lightly forested hills carpeted in vibrantly-colored wildflowers during the spring.\n\nIt only actually becomes a loop when connected with Iron Mountain Road (US Route 16A), for a total of 30 miles.\n\nWhile this loop detours from the Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway, its proximity to it makes the Wildlife Loop easy to fold into a day you had already planned on driving the Needles Highway or Iron Mountain Road.\n\nIn fact, this loop is a great spot to start a day or end your day traversing the roads mentioned above. The wildlife is most active during sunrise and dusk hours.\n\nPlan for at least 2 to 2.5 hours on the Wildlife Loop, more if you intend to stay and watch the animals for a while. Custer State Park is home to over 1,000 bison, often many of which can be spotted along this route. Bison roadblocks are not uncommon.\n\nAnd lastly, keep an eye out for the “begging burros,” a famous group of feral donkeys that descend from domesticated pack animals that used to bring visitors from the Sylvan Lake Lodge up to Black Elk Peak.\n\n3 Off-Roading Adventures to Do in the Black Hills Region\n\n36. Spearfish Canyon Lodge Off-Road Adventures\n\nIf you’re not traveling with a UTV, Spearfish Canyon Lodge offers off-road UTV rentals for half-day or full-day.\n\nThe extensive miles of trails, breathtaking views, and formidable terrain in this area make it a great location to consider a rental.\n\n37. ATV to Historic Gold Mountain Mine in Black Hills National Forest\n\nATV to a historic landmark, the Gold Mountain Mine.\n\nMany conservation groups have banded together to preserve this gold mine site with a standing mill frame.\n\nIt can be found at GPS coordinates: 43.985217 W, -103.6088\n\n38. ATV Pilot Knob to South Box Elder Creek (64)\n\nThis popular Pilot Knob to South Box Elder Creek section of the 123-mile Centennial Trail is good for viewing wildlife. It is mainly used by hikers, but keep in mind that e-bikes, cyclists, and ATVs use the trail too, and traffic has made it a bit rugged in spots. If you don’t want to hike this one, 2-, 4- and 6-seater ATV rentals are nearby!\n\nYou can reach the trail on Forest Rd 140, west of Nemo, or off Merritt Estes Rd in Deadwood.\n\nIf you start and end from Pilot Knob, the trailhead is a mile away from Sugar Shack, where you can reward yourself with a delicious half-pound burger for all your hard work!\n\n2 Historical Activities in the Black Hills Region\n\nWhile this blog focuses on outdoor adventure, there’s a ton of history in this area, and I would be remiss to not include a bit about the best historical experiences and museums in the area.\n\nThe following four sections cover the best interactive historical experiences, mining attractions, anthropological museums, and geology museums in the Black Hills.\n\n39. Explore Historic Deadwood\n\nWhether you love the Old West or the HBO series, you’ll fall hard for this little town’s charm.\n\nThis is where all the stories you’ve heard about Sheriff Seth Bullock, Wild Bill Hickok, and Calamity Jane come to life.\n\nTo experience Deadwood’s history, you need only wander down Main Street.\n\nAll the storefronts have maintained their historic facades. During the summer, you can watch a reenactment of the town’s famous gunslinger battles.\n\nSee a complete list of the shows put on across Deadwood here.\n\nThose looking to travel the town like they did in the 1800s can jump a stagecoach ride.\n\nTwo of Deadwood’s most popular attractions include:\n\nMount Moriah Cemetery\n\nEvery outlaw’s number is up at some point, some sooner than others.\n\nThe most famous ones laid to rest at Mount Moriah Cemetery are Seth Bullock, Calamity Jane, and Wild Bill Hickok.\n\nDeadwood’s early days had much bloodshed, so the cemetery filled up quickly.\n\nAdams House\n\nDeadwood is often remembered for its rougher characters. However, the gold rush didn’t only lure working-class prospectors to South Dakota but also wealthy business types who could profit from the mining boom.\n\nHarris and Anna Franklin were one such wealthy couple, and they had a lavish Queen Anne-style house built for them in Deadwood that was said to be the most luxurious home west of the Mississippi.\n\nNow, their opulent Adams House residence is open for tours, where you can glimpse monogrammed silverware and crystal wine glasses.\n\nIt’s a chance to see the more civilized history of Deadwood without all the gunfights and barroom brawls.\n\n40. Take a Ride from Keystone to Hill City on the 1880 Train\n\n“Black Hills Central 160x4RP” by drewj1946 is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nWhile the scenic highways around Hill City are magnificent, another fantastic way to see the Black Hills is as travelers did almost 150 years ago – out the window of a thundering steam-powered train.\n\nThe Black Hills Central Railroad operates the 1880 Train from Keystone to Hill City (or vice versa), a distance of only ten miles that takes about an hour to complete each way.\n\nThe whole ride is narrated, with staff pointing out interesting sights, such as old mining facilities and wildlife along the way, as well as explaining the history of the railway and the challenges of building it in such a rugged territory.\n\nMost visitors book a round-trip ticket with various stopover options. However, another option is purchasing a one-way afternoon ticket from Keystone and then getting shuttled back in a vehicle if you don’t have the time for a round-trip locomotive journey.\n\n4 Spots to Learn About Gold Mining in the Black Hills Region\n\nMaking a fortune prospecting for tiny flecks of gold is no easy task.\n\nWhile it may have started with a sparkling stream and a simple pan, gold mining quickly turned into big business requiring serious infrastructure.\n\nAll of these mining exhibits mentioned next are rated equally on Tripadvisor. If they all sound similar, make choosing easier by picking whichever is along your trip route.\n\nHere are four spots where you can learn more about gold mining in the Black Hills:\n\n41. Broken Boot Gold Mine in Deadwood\n\nMuch of the focus in Deadwood is on the wild west atmosphere and rebels. The gold mining history often gets left out.\n\nHowever, if you’re in the area and looking for a mine tour, look into the Broken Boot Gold Mine. This mine opened in the 1870s, ran for 26 years, shut down, and was eventually reopened as the tourist attraction it is now.\n\nOn their mine tour, you get to descend into the dusty caverns where dynamite and a trusty pick excavated the Black Hill’s gold (and fool’s gold), seeing the risks and hardships these men faced to get just a sliver of the wealth that was streaming out of the mountains.\n\nThis mine also has a candlelight ghost tour for those interested in a more spooky tour experience.\n\nYou can pan for gold here as well.\n\n42. Homestake Mine in Lead\n\n“Homestake Mine” by Gunnar Ries zwo is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 .\n\nThe Homestake Mine was once North America’s largest and deepest gold mine!\n\nFrom 1878 until 2002, the Homestake Mine churned out an absolutely massive amount of gold and silver, making Lead one of the most important towns during the Black Hills gold rush.\n\nIts subterranean passageways also advanced science, helping researchers understand the nature of solar neutrinos in the 1960s.\n\nWhile the mining equipment went silent two decades ago, Homestake Mine has been transformed into a state-of-the-art laboratory, the Sandford Underground Research Facility.\n\nThe Sanford Lab Homestake Visitor Center is free to visit. While there, you can learn about the mine’s history and contributions to science, see the mine from an observation deck, and virtually travel underground in a mine cage.\n\n“Homestake” by Gunnar Ries zwo is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 .\n\nTo get a guided tour of Lead and the research facility, jump aboard one of their Trolley Tours (for an additional fee).\n\n43. Big Thunder Gold Mine in Keystone\n\nThe Big Thunder Gold Mine in Keystone was established initially in the 1890s by German immigrants (back then, it was known as Gold Hill Lode).\n\nNowadays, it’s an all-in-one gold mining tourist attraction where you can tour a mine, visit a mining museum, and pan for gold.\n\nThe highlight of a visit here is donning a hard hat and going on an underground tour to learn about the history of the Big Thunder Gold Mine.\n\nFor a less claustrophobic experience, museum guides run workshops teaching visitors how to pan for gold.\n\nThe mining museum contains machinery from three area mines that have since been torn down. It includes a stamp mill and other crushers used to pulverize the ore before smelting it into gold.\n\n44. Black Hills Mining Museum in Lead\n\nThe non-profit Black Hills Mining Museum is devoted to maintaining and honoring the history of the area’s mining industry and educating new generations on the mining boom that occurred in the Black Hills over a century ago.\n\nThe museum has exhibits and artifacts which allow you to step back in time and get insight into the miners’ working conditions, lives, and challenges, and an underground mining tour in an authentic mine recreated by former miners.\n\nThis is also another location visitors can go panning for gold.\n\n4 Best Museums to Visit in the Black Hills Region\n\n45.

Its Historic Main Street is loaded with historic sites, restored buildings, attractions, and live entertainment that are guaranteed to keep you busy when you’re not checking out one of the nearby parks.\n\nThis is a popular tourist town, so prices will be higher than in the neighboring towns.\n\nWhere to Stay in Deadwood\n\nLUXURY CONDOS IN THE HEART OF DEADWOOD: The Bank Hotel Deadwood\n\nHISTORIC BED & BREAKFAST: 1899 Inn\n\nAFFORDABLE OPTION: Cedar Wood Inn\n\nVARIETY OF CAMPING OPTIONS: Hidden Valley Campground\n\nFREE SPOT: Mount Roosevelt Road Dispersed Campsite\n\nWhy Stay in Lead\n\nMost people staying in Lead are looking for a quiet spot that avoids the crowds and commotion in the famed Wild West town of Deadwood (less than ten minutes away) yet remains central to most Black Hills attractions.\n\nLead has its own historic charm and is situated in the heart of the Black Hills, offering easy access to various outdoor activities.\n\nLead’s history leans more towards mining than cowboy shootouts, being the world’s most productive gold mining town.\n\nSince the town isn’t swarming with tourists trying to catch a confrontation between Sheriff Bullock and Al Swearengen, you get a little more for your money in Lead than in Deadwood.\n\nWhere to Stay in Lead\n\nVARIETY OF CAMPING OPTIONS AND AMENITIES: Whitetail Creek Camping Resort\n\nHISTORIC BOUTIQUE HOTEL: Town Hall Inn\n\nAFFORDABLE ROOMS: Ponderosa Pines Inn and Cabins\n\nAFFORDABLE & WELL-REVIEWED HOTEL: Hampton Inn Lead\n\nWhy Stay in Spearfish\n\nSitting at the northwestern end of the Black Hills, located between Mount Rushmore and Devils Tower National Monument, is Spearfish, known as the adventure capital of the Black Hills.\n\nNot only does it have one of the most scenic byways in the country, but outdoor adventure also seems to be around every bend up here, with dozens of hiking and biking trails, ATVing, rock climbing, golfing, and fishing opportunities. And in the winter, downhill skiing and snowboarding.\n\nThis area is shrouded in natural beauty and is heaven for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts. Staying here is all about enjoying the great outdoors.\n\nMany visitors to this area choose to camp close to Spearfish Canyon and the scenic byway that runs through it. But there are also B&B and lodge options in town for travelers who prefer having four solid walls and a roof over their heads at night.\n\nWhere to Stay in Spearfish\n\nRESORT AMENITIES: Elkhorn Ridge RV Resort & Cabins / Spearfish Canyon Lodge\n\nCAMPING WITH A POOL & PLAYGROUND: Spearfish / Black Hills KOA Holiday / Chris’ Camp & RV Park\n\nAFFORDABLE RV AND TENT SITES: Spearfish City Campground\n\nHOTEL: Best Western Black Hills Lodge\n\nWhy Stay in Sturgis\n\nSturgis is a town that attracts global attention with its legendary 500,000-strong motorcycle rally.\n\nThe town also has many other events bringing together vehicle enthusiasts, including the Sturgis Camaro Rally, Sturgis Mustang Rally, and Sturgis Off-Road Rally.\n\nHowever, you don’t need your own Harley to visit Sturgis!\n\nOutside of early August, Sturgis is a relatively quiet small town on the Northeast edge of the Black Hills.\n\nIt’s a good jumping-off point for hiking and mountain biking adventures.\n\nThere’s also a fantastic motorcycle museum (Sturgis Motorcycle Museum & Hall of Fame and the Sturgis Historical Museum) to explore if you need a rainy-day activity.\n\nHowever, Sturgis does experience a substantial increase in population and becomes considerably busier during the rally. Planning your stay outside the rally dates may be best if you prefer a more peaceful visit.\n\nWhere to Stay in Sturgis\n\nCHEAP DRY CAMPING: Bear Butte State Park\n\nRV & TENT CAMPING WITH AMENITIES: No Name City Luxury Cabins & RV Park\n\nTHE ONLY HOTEL ON MAIN STREET: The Hotel Sturgis\n\nWhy Stay in Hill City\n\nIt doesn’t get as much attention as Deadwood, Custer, or Keystone, but Hill City is an excellent place to stay in the south-central Black Hills region (and one of my favorites!)\n\nIt’s close to Mount Rushmore, some of the best hiking in Black Elk Wilderness, and the scenic Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway.\n\nSo, it provides a great central location, with amenities and restaurants, much like Rapid City, but with a much more outdoorsy and laid-back vibe.\n\nWhere to Stay in Hill City\n\nLARGE, SPREAD-OUT FACILITY: (RV park and cabins) Rafters J Bar Ranch Camping Resort\n\nCOTTAGES WITH A COMMUNITY FEEL: Black Elk Resort Cottages and RV Park (If they’re booked: Mountain View Lodge & Cabins)\n\nBEST BUDGET HOTEL: Comfort Inn & Suites Near Mt. Rushmore\n\nBEST BUDGET RV PARK: Firehouse Campground\n\nIN THE CENTER OF THE ACTION: Harney Peak Inn\n\nNATIONAL FOREST CAMPING: Ditch Creek Campground, Dutchman Campground, Custer Trails Campground, Whitetail Campground.\n\nWhy Stay in Custer\n\nCuster is the oldest town in the Black Hills region, but most attractions are nature-based rather than historical.\n\nCuster State Park, South Dakota’s largest state park and one of America’s largest, is only fourteen miles east of town. It rivals many national parks with its roaming herds of bison, the incredibly scenic Needles Highway, and rugged hiking opportunities.\n\nCuster’s location also makes it a great jumping-off point for visiting Wind Cave National Park, 20 miles to the south, and Jewel Cave National Monument, 13 miles to the east.\n\nThe park has ample camping options, but the town of Custer also has various accommodation options.\n\nWhere to Stay in Custer State Park\n\nRUSTIC OPTION CLOSE TO NEEDLES HIGHWAY: Center Lake Campground\n\nCLOSE TO WILDLIFE LOOP & WIND CAVE: Blue Bell Campground\n\nOTHER ADMIRED CSP CAMPGROUNDS: Stockade Lake South Campground, Game Lodge Campground, Grace Coolidge Campground, and Sylvan Lake Campground.\n\nWhere to Stay In Custer\n\nWhy Stay in Keystone\n\nStay in Keystone if you want to be closest to Mount Rushmore. However, most activities will be elsewhere.\n\nSince the town is only ten minutes from Mount Rushmore, expect hotels and campgrounds to book early here.\n\nJuly and August bring in big crowds, but it’s less congested outside the summer road-tripping months.\n\nWhere to Stay in Keystone\n\nLUXURIOUS GLAMPING: Under Canvas Mount Rushmore\n\nNATIONAL FOREST SETTING: Horsethief Lake Campground\n\nLODGE AMENITIES: Powder House\n\nHOTEL WITH A PUB: K Bar S Lodge\n\nAFFORDABLE HOTEL NEAR MOUNT RUSHMORE: Comfort Inn & Suites Mt Rushmore\n\nWhy Stay in Hot Springs\n\nSitting in the state’s southwest corner, Hot Springs tends to get less attention than some other Black Hills area cities.\n\nHowever, thanks to a few natural hot springs and a location fifteen minutes from Wind Cave National Park, Hot Spring is more than worth the stop on a Black Hills road trip.\n\nWhere to Stay in Hot Springs\n\nWhy Stay in the Badlands Region\n\nThe Badlands region is east of the Black Hills. It’s home to Badlands National Park, the Minuteman Missle National Historic Site, the Prarie Homestead Historic Site, the Oglala Lakota Living History Village, and more.\n\nIf you’re driving to the region along I-90, this area deserves at least a day of your time.\n\n👉 Click here to check out my Ultimate One Day Badlands National Park Road Trip Itinerary!\n\nStopping for the night here entails considering Wall and Interior as lodging options.\n\nWall is a small town with basic amenities. You’ll know it’s coming for hundreds of miles before you actually get there. Signs all along the Interstate remind you how far away Wall is and point out if you’ve “accidentally” gone past it.\n\nWhile Wall has a history of being a kitschy tourist town, it’s also home to the National Grasslands Visitor Center.\n\nInterior is a much quieter option. This area is about as small and peaceful as places come.\n\nAmenities are scarce. Ensure you hit up a grocery store in either Wall or Kadoka (each about 40 minutes away) before staying in this area.\n\nWhere to Stay in the Wall, Interior, & Badlands National Park Area\n\nFREE CAMPING: Buffalo Gap National Grasslands, Nomad View Dispersed Camping. Find this spot at GPS coordinates 43.8898, -102.227. Other nearby free options include Sage Creek Campground and Backcountry Camping.\n\nBUDGET HOTEL: Super 8 by Wyndham Wall\n\nANOTHER HOTEL OPTION: Best Western Plains Motel\n\nYOUNG\n\nThe Best Places to Eat and Drink in the Black Hills\n\nWhile there are numerous dining options in the Black Hills, these are spots you shouldn’t miss:\n\nFirehouse Brewing Company in Rapid City\n\n“Firehouse Brewing Company” by nick.amoscato is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nFirehouse Brewing Company is one of South Dakota’s oldest microbreweries and possibly the coolest location for one, inside the original Rapid City Fire Station, built over a hundred years ago.\n\nThey have nearly a dozen of their own beers on tap, and outside is a patio with a band shell for summer concerts.\n\nBe sure to arrive hungry because Firehouse’s burgers are a full half-pound, and they have other mouthwatering treats straight from their smoker, like andouille sausage, pulled pork, and whole ribs.\n\nFort Hays Old West Town Square & Chuckwagon Supper and Music Variety Show in Rapid City\n\nShopping, dinner, and a show, what more could you ask for?\n\nUpon arriving at this spot, first explore Fort Hays Old West Town Square, the set piece from the Kevin Costner movie “Dances with Wolves” that has been relocated to the restaurant grounds.\n\nWhile there, you can shop along the boardwalk and see artisans creating tools such as ropes and knives. You can also visit the South Dakota movie museum while there. Both are free.\n\nOnce you’re good and hungry, sit down for a delicious Chuckwagon Supper like baked chicken or sliced beef in BBQ sauce, all served on handmade tin plates!\n\n(Or, if you’re there in the morning, fill up on all-you-can-eat cowboy pancakes for 99 cents.)\n\nThen the Fort Hay Wranglers will take the stage for a Live Musical Performance that’ll get you up and dancing.\n\nLeone’s Creamery in Spearfish\n\nLeone’s Creamery is a must-visit spot for ice cream lovers in Spearfish, South Dakota. Their handcrafted flavors, commitment to local sourcing, and inviting atmosphere offer a delightful experience for anyone looking to indulge in a sweet treat.\n\nPrairie Berry Winery & Miner Brewing Company in Hill City\n\nPrairie Berry Winery and Miner Brewing Company are within steps of each other and owned by the same owners.\n\nWinemaker and Brewmaster Sandi Vojta comes from a long line of family members handcrafting beverages.\n\nPrairie Berry’s wines have won over 1,000 awards collectively.\n\nEither location is a great place to wind down after a long day of exploring, with various beverage options made from local ingredients, welcoming atmospheres, scenic views, and a shared kitchen to order sandwiches and small bites.\n\nThe Alpine Inn in Hill City\n\nThe Alpine Inn resides in what was originally the historic Harney Peak Hotel, built in 1886.\n\nInitially, a spot where mining executives wined and dined; these days, it’s known for authentic German cuisine, including schnitzel and kaes spaetzle.\n\nThere are two choices for dinner: Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon or Kaes Spaetzle Primavera.\n\nIf you, or people in your group, like options, though, skip dinner and opt for the lunch hours when they have a much more extensive menu full of German delights and a wide range of sandwiches, soups, and salads.\n\nPlease take note: No reservations are accepted here, and it’s cash only.\n\nBlack Hills Burger and Bun Co. in Custer\n\nIn 2014, TripAdvisor ranked Black Hills Burger and Bun Co. as the best burger joint in America!\n\nThis spot is known for its fresh ingredients, homemade baked buns, reasonable prices, and delicious burger concoctions.\n\nThose looking for a no-frills, classic, all-American meal will be satisfied here.\n\nSkogen Kitchen in Custer\n\nFoodies visiting South Dakota must plan to eat a meal at Skogen Kitchen.\n\nSkogen Kitchen is known for offering creative, unique, and delicious dining options.\n\nThe restaurant’s chef Joseph Raney was a 2023 James Beard semifinalist in the Best Chef in the Midwest region category.\n\nPurple Pie Place in Custer\n\n“Purple Pie Place Custer, SD” by puroticorico is licensed under CC BY 2.0 .\n\nYou cannot miss Purple Pie Place‘s bright purple house on the west end of Mt. Rushmore Road in Custer.\n\nTheir famous homemade pies include fillings like blueberry, rhubarb, peach, cherry, the classic apple, and a half dozen others.\n\nIt’s not just a desert destination, though. They also have pretty tasty sandwiches, salads, paninis, and mac & cheese.\n\nAs importantly, a photo in front of the house is Instagram gold!\n\nThings to Do in the Black Hills: FAQs\n\nHere are the answers to some frequently asked questions about the Black Hills area:\n\nWhat is the biggest attraction at the Black Hills?\n\nWhile it is not size-wise the largest attraction, Mount Rushmore National Memorial is the Black Hills’ most prominent attraction, with over two million annual visitors.\n\nWhat are the Black Hills famous for?\n\nIn no particular order, the Black Hills are most famous for:\n\n❇️ Mount Rushmore National Memorial\n\n❇️ Sturgis Motorcycle Rally\n\n❇️ Deadwood\n\n❇️ Gold Mining\n\n❇️ Bison\n\n❇️ Crazy Horse Memorial\n\n❇️ Native American Culture and Heritage\n\n❇️ Scenic Drives\n\n❇️ Caves\n\nWhat should I not miss in the Black Hills?\n\nThere’s an abundance of attractions in the Black Hills, indeed something for everyone.\n\nIf you can make it to Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Crazy Horse Memorial, the Black Elk Wilderness, Custer State Park, a cave, a gold mine, see a buffalo, and drive on a scenic highway, you’ve hit the highlights!\n\nWhen should I go to the Black Hills?\n\nLike most favored vacation destinations, you will find fewer crowds if you can go off-season.\n\nGoing in late May, September, and October is best unless you enjoy winter activities.\n\nThe Busiest Time to Visit\n\nHands down, summer.\n\nSummer will always be the most convenient time for families in the United States, bringing out the most substantial amounts of tourists.\n\nWeekdays may be less crowded from June through August. Try to see the more touristy sights then and save hikes and scenic drives for the weekends.\n\nThe Best Time to Visit\n\nFall (August – November) is the best time to visit.\n\nDuring our most recent visit, we were there in August (right after the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally). The weather was mild and lovely, and the crowds were minimal.\n\nThe Second Best Time to Visit\n\nSpring.\n\nLike fall, the weather will be beautiful, and the crowds will be thinned out.\n\nHowever, this is second because South Dakota is known to have some pretty intense rainstorms and hailstorms in the spring. I’ve even heard stories of RV roofs becoming ruined from the intensity of the hail they get!\n\nThe Worst Time to Visit\n\nWinter.\n\nIt will be freezing, and you could run into snowy conditions. Furthermore, much of the wildlife will hide due to the winter weather.\n\nAlso, if motorcycles aren’t your thing, I recommend not going while the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is going on (August 4th – 13th for 2023). You will be surrounded by bikes. But if that’s your jam, that would be the best time to go!\n\nHow do I get to the Black Hills?\n\nThe Black Hills are in the Southwest corner of South Dakota.\n\nRapid City is conveniently located off I-90, the major highway that cuts east to west through the state, and is in the middle of the eastern portion of the Black Hills.\n\nTo visit, you can either road-trip from your home or fly into Rapid City, SD and then drive to your first destination.\n\nFlying to the Black Hills\n\nThe closest airport is Rapid City Regional Airport. The graphic below (from their website) shows each city and airline that flies into Rapid City and during what time of year. Click here to find further info on seasonal flights.\n\nFor those on a tight budget: If you’re traveling as a family, purchasing numerous plane tickets, another option is to fly into the larger Denver International Airport. They serve many more airlines.\n\nIt would be a 6-hour drive from the Denver airport to Rapid City. (If you start your trip in Hot Springs, you can cut thirty minutes off that drive.)\n\nDriving to the Black Hills\n\nDistances from Rapid City:\n\nRental Car\n\nYou will need a car to get around the Black Hills. If flying in, you will need to rent a car or RV. (I gave a shout-out to a couple of our favorite RV parks above!)\n\nConclusion: Things to Do in the Black Hills\n\nI hope you wonder no more about what to do in the Black Hills!\n\nThe area is spectacular, and it only takes a short time to see why people come from worldwide to see its natural beauty and animals, revel in its history and learn about its natural resources and spirituality."
