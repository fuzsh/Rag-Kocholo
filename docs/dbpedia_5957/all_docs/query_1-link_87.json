        "text": "What are the benefits of the AA-T or AS-T at a CSU?\n\nBenefits include:\n\nPriority admission to the CSU system into a similar major as a junior as long as the you meet all of the eligibility requirements.\n\nOnce admitted, you will only be required to complete 60 additional units to qualify for the baccalaureate (BA or BS) degree.\n\nA special GPA advantage when applying to CSU impacted campuses or majors.\n\nEligibility for Winter/Spring Admission for CSU campuses that require completion of the AA-T or AS-T.\n\nWhat the degree does not do:\n\nThese degrees do not guarantee a student admission for a specified major or campus, but requires the CSU to grant a student priority admission to the local CSU campus and to a program or major that is similar to the AA-T or AS-T as determined by each specific CSU campus. Please see the links below labeled Associate Degree for Transfer Major & Campus Search for additional information.\n\nReturn to top\n\nWhich CSUs will accept my AA-T/AS-T?\n\nNot all CSUs will accept all AA-T/AS-T degrees. In order to determine which campuses will accept the degree for your major, follow the instructions in the bullet below. Be sure to match your degree with the specific concentration, not just major. If you have questions, see a counselor or stop by the Career and Transfer Center for more information.\n\nAssociate Degree for Transfer Major & Campus Search - Once on the page, click on the Major of Interest and CSU to see which DVC's ADTs are deemed similar with a specific Major Emphasis or Concentration and at which campuses.\n\nReturn to top\n\nWhat are the benefits of the AA-T or AS-T at select private schools?\n\nThe ADT Commitment for partner AICCU campuses is:\n\nGuaranteed admission for the ADT students meeting admission requirements;\n\nGuarantees a minimum of 60 semester/90 quarter units will transfer;\n\nGuarantees the student starts with junior standing.\n\nRead more about which AICCU private colleges/universities in California provide these with an ADT, and for which majors/degrees, at AICCU's Transfer Commitment website.\n\nNote: The ADT Commitment is the Independent California College and University sector’s adaptation of the ADT pathway. While similar to the CSU ADT, there are also some differences due to the independent nature of the state’s nonprofit institutions:\n\nUnlike CSU, AICCU institutions are not part of a system and each campus has its own admission and graduation requirements.\n\nIf an ADT transfer student meets all the requirements of admission to a participating institution, admission is guaranteed to that college as opposed to a system.\n\nReturn to top\n\nWhat do I need in order to be eligible?\n\nIn order to be eligible for an AA-T or AS-T, students must complete the following:\n\n60 semester units or 90 quarter units of coursework that would be eligible for transfer to the California State University, including IGETC or CSUGE with Oral Communication.\n\nCoursework in a major as defined in the DVC Catalog.\n\nEarn a minimum grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 in all CSU-transferable coursework and a \"C\" or higher in all courses required for the major. Completion deadlines vary by campus, but typically require that all degree requirements be completed by the end of Spring for Fall admission.\n\nWhen completing your CSU application, state that you are completing the AA-T or AS-T in the \"Extended Profile\" section of the CSU application - select \"First Bachelor's Degree\" and \"Transferring with an Associate Degree for Transfer (AA-T/AS-T) awarded by a California Community College\".\n\nApply for your degree by the required filing deadline! Find the application/filing deadline under Important Dates for your final semester (\"Deadline to file AA/AS degree or certificate\"). As early as the final semester in which you are completing your degree requirements, submit your degree application at InSite Portal's \"Graduation\" tile or at Admissions & Records. Electronic verification (E-Verify) occurs automatically with each CSU that you apply to once you complete this step so long as there is no outstanding balance showing on your \"Payment\" tile (students receiving Veterans and FT3 aid excluded).\n\nReturn to top"
