        "text": "The God of Small Things\n\nBy Arundhati Roy,\n\nFrom my list on transporting you across time and place.\n\nBy Jawahara Saidullah Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nTravel and writing are my two great passions. Since I was a child, I escaped reality by escaping into my own mind. I had relied on my stories of the warrior queens ever since I learned about them as a child. It was only a few years ago, when I lived in Geneva, that I had a memory flash at me of the statue of Queen Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi on a rearing horse with a curved sword held in one hand. I knew then that it was time to tell a story—my own story and that of my favorite warrior queens.\n\nJawahara's book list on transporting you across time and place\n\nWhy did Jawahara love this book?\n\nAs a sucker for beautiful writing, this book had me from the first page, and I couldn’t put it down. So many issues that had been part of my childhood culture resonated with me while it also showed me many others from a part of India that I had never even visited.\n\nThough sweeping in its scope, it drills down into a very human story with all its pain and love. It weaves myth, story, real life, love, loss, and the meaning of family. It was one of the first novels by an Indian woman that transcended cultures, gender, and any preconceived notions.\n\nBy Arundhati Roy,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked The God of Small Things as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'They all broke the rules. They all crossed into forbidden territory. They all tampered with the laws that lay down who should be loved, and how. And how much.'\n\nThis is the story of Rahel and Estha, twins growing up among the banana vats and peppercorns of their blind grandmother's factory, and amid scenes of political turbulence in Kerala. Armed only with the innocence of youth, they fashion a childhood in the shade of the wreck that is their family: their lonely, lovely mother, their beloved Uncle Chacko (pickle baron, radical Marxist, bottom-pincher) and their sworn enemy, Baby Kochamma (ex-nun,…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Jew in the Lotus\n\nBy Rodger Kamenetz,\n\nFrom my list on Zen and Judaism.\n\nBy Brenda Shoshanna Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nA lifelong practitioner and teacher of both Zen and Judaism, I am also a psychologist, who has constantly grappled with human needs, suffering, and the craving for meaning. The focus of my life has been to integrate the profound teachings of East and West and provide ways of making these teachings real in our everyday lives. An award-winning author, I have published many books on Zen and psychology, and have been the playwright in residence at the Jewish Repertory Theater in NY. Presently, I offer two weekly podcasts, Zen Wisdom for Your Everyday Life, and One Minute Mitzvahs. I also provide ongoing Zen talks both for Morningstar Zen and Inisfada Zen, workshops, and other talks for the community.\n\nBrenda's book list on Zen and Judaism\n\nWhy did Brenda love this book?\n\nWhile on a trip to Dharamsala, India, for a Buddhist–Jewish dialogue with the Dalai Lama, the author, Rodger Kamenetz, comes to understand the incredible connection between Buddhist and Jewish thought. Along the way he encounters many Jews who have become distanced from their roots and tradition, seeking meaning in other practices. Through the author’s amazing journey into Tibetan Buddhism, he is finally able to come to an appreciation of the power and beauty of his own Jewish practice and roots.\n\nBy Rodger Kamenetz,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Jew in the Lotus as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nKamenetz, a poet and a Jew, was invited to attend and write about a historical meeting between a delegation of American Jews and a group of Tibetan Buddhists that included the Dalai Lama. This interfaith get-together was inspired, in part, by the increasing number of Jews who have become Buddhists as well as the Dalai Lama's perception of Jews as survival experts. The Dalai Lama felt that the Jews, experts in exile and the preservation of faith and practice, would offer advice and comfort; participating rabbis were intrigued by the surprising similarities between the two religions, including esoteric traditions and…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Revolt of Owain Glyn Dwr\n\nBy R.R. Davies,\n\nFrom my list on the late medieval crisis: war and plague in Britain and France.\n\nBy David Green Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI was drawn into the study of medieval history through an interest in chivalry and this led to a PhD and various publications on the career and household of Edward the Black Prince (1330-76). He lived through the heart of what’s become known as the late medieval crisis: a period which many contemporaries thought was a prelude to the apocalypse. I’ve been teaching and writing about this period for more than 20 years now and remain fascinated by the contrasts between creativity and utter devastation that characterise the later middle ages.\n\nDavid's book list on the late medieval crisis: war and plague in Britain and France\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nRees Davies was one of the first historians to seek to explore the histories of Britain and Ireland as both unique and intertwined narratives. Although this book focuses on the Welsh revolt of the early 15th century it shows the author’s formidable understanding of the relationship between England and Wales in the century after the Edwardian conquest. An object lesson in academic history written with the general reader in mind.\n\nBy R.R. Davies,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Revolt of Owain Glyn Dwr as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOwain Glyn Dwr is arguably the most famous figure in the history of Wales. His revolt (1400-1409) was the last major Welsh rebellion against English rule. It established a measure of unity such as Wales had never previously experienced and generated a remarkable vision of Wales as an independent country with its own native prince, its own church, and its own universities. In the event, Owain's rebellion was defeated or, perhaps more correctly, burnt itself out. But\n\nOwain himself was not captured; and soon after his death he became a legendary hero among the Welsh people. In more recent times…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Long Field\n\nBy Pamela Petro,\n\nFrom my list on travel memoirs for those who love to wander.\n\nBy Kyoko Mori Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAlthough two of my nonfiction books—The Dream of Water and Polite Lies—are about traveling from the American Midwest to my native country of Japan, I'm not a traveler by temperament. I long to stay put in one place. Chimney swifts cover the distance between North America and the Amazon basin every fall and spring. I love to stand in the driveway of my brownstone to watch them. That was the last thing Katherine Russell Rich and I did together in what turned out to be the last autumn of her life before the cancer she’d been fighting came back. Her book, Dreaming in Hindi, along with the four other books I’m recommending, expresses an indomitable spirit of adventure.\n\nKyoko's book list on travel memoirs for those who love to wander\n\nWhy did Kyoko love this book?\n\nWhen Pamela Petro traveled to Lampeter, Wales for the first time to enroll in a year-long master’s degree program, she had no idea that the open vista of sheep pastures and low hills around the town would strike a chord in her—she found herself nodding as if she was in agreement with the landscape—or that she would spend the rest of her life returning to Wales from the various American cities where she made a life as a writer and a teacher. The Long Field takes us on a journey through time and ideas as well as of places.\n\nThe book masterfully weaves together the accounts of various trips to Wales and elsewhere, the childhood spent in suburban New Jersey where, in spite of the family she loved and was loved by, Ms. Petro was overcome by a desire not to stay in one place, and most important of all,…\n\nBy Pamela Petro,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Long Field as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Long Field burrows deep into the Welsh countryside to tell how this small country became a big part of an American writer's life. Petro, author of Travels in an Old Tongue, twines her story around that of Wales by viewing both through the lens of hiraeth, a quintessential Welsh word famously hard to translate. It literally means \"long field,\" but is also more than the English approximation of \"homesickness.\" It's a name for the bone-deep longing felt for someone or something--a home, culture, language, a younger self--that you've lost or left behind. Hiraeth is embodied by Arthur, King of…\n\nPreview\n\nSunken Cities. Some Legends of the Coast and Lakes of Wales\n\nBy F.J. North,\n\nFrom my list on submerged lands.\n\nBy Patrick Nunn Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGrowing up in post-WWII Europe, young people’s anxiety was often channelled into searching for ‘lost worlds’, places hope could be nurtured and ancient solutions revived. So I encountered Atlantis and Lemuria and other imagined places but also learned, from training as a geologist, that once-populated lands had actually been submerged. Myths and legends often contain grains of observational truth at their heart. The more ‘submergence stories’ I research, from Australia through India and across northwest Europe, the more I realize how much we have forgotten about undersea human pasts. And how our navigation of the future could be improved by understanding them.\n\nPatrick's book list on submerged lands\n\nWhy did Patrick love this book?\n\nWritten in the 1950s by a museum curator-geologist, Sunken Cities is one of the earliest expositions of ‘myth and legend’ and their plausible geological meanings. The author marries his deep knowledge of Welsh traditions about submerged places with contemporary geological understandings. Of course, geology was transformed the following decade but North’s book remains insightful and grounded in ways that many more recent accounts are not. If I lived in Wales, I would be off every weekend with it in hand!\n\nBy F.J. North,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Sunken Cities. Some Legends of the Coast and Lakes of Wales as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Valley of Lost Secrets\n\nBy Lesley Parr,\n\nFrom my list on England’s World War II evacuations.\n\nBy Kate Albus Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been fascinated by England’s World War II evacuations since I was a child. Appropriately enough, I first learned of this extraordinary historical event in a story: it’s the reason the Pevensies are sent to the Professor’s house in C.S. Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. In the dark days of World War II, more than a million English children boarded trains, buses, and ships, to be picked up and cared for by strangers, in some cases for the duration of the war. It’s a historical event that is as astonishing to me now as it was when I first read of it all those years ago.\n\nKate's book list on England’s World War II evacuations\n\nWhy did Kate love this book?\n\nNot only is this a heartfelt evacuee story, it’s also a brilliant mystery. When Jimmy and his brother, Ronnie, are sent to the Welsh countryside to escape the bombings, Jimmy is angry at the adults responsible – “They think they know everything but all they do is leave or make wars or send their children away.” The boys eventually warm to their kind foster parents, but some of the villagers aren’t so welcoming. When Jimmy finds a skull in a hollow tree, he has no idea how it’s tied to an unsolved mystery, and the reader has no idea how it will figure in this story’s gripping, satisfying, and emotional conclusion.\n\nBy Lesley Parr,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Valley of Lost Secrets as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Beautifully told. This appealing book is about losses healed, lies uncovered, cruelty defeated and goodness rewarded.\" The Sunday Times\n\nSeptember 1939.\n\nWhen Jimmy is evacuated to a small village in Wales, it couldn't be more different from London. Green, quiet and full of strangers, he instantly feels out of place.\n\nBut then he finds a skull hidden in a tree, and suddenly the valley is more frightening than the war. Who can Jimmy trust? His brother is too little; his best friend has changed.\n\nFinding an ally in someone he never expects, they set out together to uncover the secrets…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Eyre Affair\n\nBy Jasper Fforde,\n\nFrom my list on humorous sci-fi books with female protagonists.\n\nBy A.C. Huntley Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I was a child, the thing that plagued me most about my favorite genre, sci-fi, was that none of the protagonists were women! As a daughter to doctors and research scientists, it felt strange that the only female characters in sci-fi were these buxom, mystical healers or seamstresses who meekly repaired their crewmates’ uniforms. While that problem has been remedied over the last two decades of excellence in mainstream sci-fi with some truly unforgettable female heroines, they’re not as plentiful in the niche market of humorous sci-fi. I am thrilled to share this list of my favorite lighthearted, humorous sci-fi reads with female protagonists.\n\nA.C.'s book list on humorous sci-fi books with female protagonists\n\nWhy did A.C. love this book?\n\nI enjoyed the silly and irreverent humor in this book and was happy to hitch a ride along with protagonist Thursday Next, a literary detective for an English government agency that safeguards literary masterpieces against time travelers.\n\nHaving majored in English literature myself, I was delighted by the characters’ discussions on literature, including the evergreen debate on the true author of Shakespearean plays. I also relished the setting–an alternative England in the 1980’s. All in all, this novel is a classic and well worth the read.\n\nBy Jasper Fforde,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n9 authors picked The Eyre Affair as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMeet Thursday Next, literary detective without equal, fear or boyfriend\n\nJasper Fforde's beloved New York Times bestselling novel introduces literary detective Thursday Next and her alternate reality of literature-obsessed England-from the author of The Constant Rabbit\n\nFans of Douglas Adams and P. G. Wodehouse will love visiting Jasper Fforde's Great Britain, circa 1985, when time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously: it's a bibliophile's dream. England is a virtual police state where an aunt can get lost (literally) in a Wordsworth poem and forging Byronic…\n\nPreview\n\nThe History of Wales in Twelve Poems\n\nBy M. Wynn Thomas,\n\nWhy did Helen love this book?\n\nM. Wynn Thomas is the foremost literary critic writing in Wales today, and a writer I particularly admire.\n\nHe pioneered the concept of ‘Welsh writing in English’ as distinct from ‘Welsh writing’ (in Welsh), honouring the bilingual culture of Wales. Thomas’s twelve poems are selected from three key periods of Welsh history, the Middle Ages, the pre-modern period, and our own time.\n\nEach poem is read in the context of its social and political background, educating us about the politics of Welshness, the cultural assumptions written into the literature, and above all what it means to be Welsh in a nation that is not a state.\n\nThis is such an elegant and original way to foreground the creativity of Welsh poets alongside the cultural forces that shaped them.\n\nBy M. Wynn Thomas,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The History of Wales in Twelve Poems as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDown the centuries, poets have provided Wales with a window onto its own distinctive world. This book gives the general reader a sense of the view to be seen through that special window in twelve illustrated poems, each bringing very different periods and aspects of the Welsh past into focus. Together, the poems give the flavour of a poetic tradition, both ancient and modern, that is internationally renowned for its distinction, demonstrating how Wales boast one of the oldest and yet continuing vibrant poetic traditions, the former in the Welsh language and the latter in English and bilingually.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Song of Heledd\n\nBy Judith Arnopp,\n\nWhy did Theresa love this book?\n\nThis is another historical novel set in my favourite time period AD 600’s, this time in Powys. The main character is Heledd – a peace-weaver bride, she is human, flawed, compelling, and courageous. The background detail is vivid and well researched, but what I love most about this book is the lyrical style of writing, which may almost give the reader the sense that the story is being sung, reflecting with feeling and humanity, the real Anglo-Saxon poetry that has come down to us. Here is a powerful sense of sadness, regret, and gathering doom, lifted by moments of pure joy – a true lament!\n\nBy Judith Arnopp,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Song of Heledd as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn seventh century Powys at the hall of King Cynddylan of Pengwern, the princesses, Heledd and Ffreur attend a celebratory feast where fifteen-year-old Heledd develops an infatuation for a travelling minstrel. Their illicit liaison triggers a chain of events that will destroy two kingdoms and bring down a dynasty. Set against the backdrop of the pagan-Christian conflict between kings Penda and Oswiu The Song of Heledd sweeps the reader from the ancient kingdom of Pengwern to the lofty summits of Gwynedd where Heledd battles to control both her own destiny and those around her. Judith Arnopp has carried out lengthy…\n\nPreview"
