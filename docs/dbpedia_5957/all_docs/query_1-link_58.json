        "text": "Badlands National Park and the Black Hills area are destinations not to be missed.\n\nThe goal of this guide is to share why the Badlands are so impressive and to give you a guide for exploring the area on your own.\n\nHi there! I’m Cindy. My husband and I lived full-time in a fifth wheel for three years and continue to travel and adventure.\n\nWe spent a handful of days at the park. While there and before our arrival, I spent a lot of time gathering information to make our trip the best possible.\n\nThis post serves as a highlight reel composed of everything I learned. It’s a one-stop shop for what you need to know and nothing you don’t!\n\nI LOVED our time in the Badlands and want to go back soon!\n\nRead on to find out why you should make the stop, especially if you have kids!\n\nLet’s start with… what are the Badlands, and why are they called the Badlands?\n\nHistorically the Lakota people were the first to call the area “land bad” (or “mako sica”). This was due to the rough living conditions in the area due to topography, temperatures, and lack of water. Next, French-Canadian fur trappers came along and felt similar about the land, calling it “bad lands to travel through” (or “les mauvais terres pour traverse”).\n\nThese days though, the term Badlands has more of a geologic description. Wikipedia describes Badlands as “a type of dry terrain where softer sedimentary rocks and clay-rich soils have been extensively eroded by wind and water. They are characterized by steep slopes, minimal vegetation, lack of a substantial regolith, and high drainage density.\n\nThey can resemble malpaís, a terrain of volcanic rock. Canyons, ravines, gullies, buttes, mesas, hoodoos, and other such geologic forms are common in badlands. They are often difficult to navigate on foot. Badlands often have a spectacular color display that alternates from dark black/blue coal stria to bright clays to red scoria.”\n\nAll of this is precisely what you get at Badlands National Park. So if that sounds interesting and like something you’d like to see at some point in your life, then let’s continue!\n\nAre the Badlands worth a visit?\n\nYes!\n\nYou may be thinking, “Okay… This sounds interesting, but what makes this park so awesome?”\n\nIt’s the unique nature of the Badlands!\n\nWhile there, you can basically run wild anywhere you please. It’s such a fantastically freeing feeling. The list of National Parks that allow you that sort of freedom is short.\n\nWhether you stay for one day or more, you have plenty to explore at this park. But it doesn’t take long to see that it’s beautiful.\n\nWhen is the best time to visit the Badlands?\n\nThe great news about this particular park is that it is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day! So no matter when you’re taking your trip, there’s a way to fit it in.\n\nThe busiest (& hottest) time to visit:\n\nHands down, summer is the busiest time to visit Badlands National Park.\n\nThat’s going to be the same for a lot of National Parks. Summer will always be the most convenient time for families in the United States and always brings out the most substantial amounts of tourists.\n\nThe best time to visit:\n\nFall (August – November) is the best time to visit Badlands National Park.\n\nDuring our visit, we were there in August (right after the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally). The weather was mild and lovely, and the crowds were minimal.\n\nThe second best time to visit:\n\nSpring is the second best time to visit Badlands National Park.\n\nSimilar to fall, the weather will be beautiful, and the crowds will be thinned out.\n\nHowever, this is second because South Dakota is known to have some pretty intense rainstorms and hailstorms in the spring. I’ve even heard stories of RV roofs becoming ruined from the intensity of the hail they get!\n\nThe worst time to visit:\n\nWinter is the worst time to visit Badlands National Park.\n\nIt will be freezing, and you could run into snowy conditions. Furthermore, due to the winter weather, a lot of the wildlife will be hiding.\n\nAlso, if motorcycles aren’t your thing, I would recommend not going while the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is going on. You will be surrounded by bikes.\n\nBut if that’s your jam, then that would be the best time to go!\n\nHow do I get to the Badlands?\n\nBadlands National Park is in the Southwest corner of South Dakota. It’s conveniently located right off I-90, the major highway that slices east to west straight through the state.\n\nTo visit, you are either going to have to road trip from your home or fly into Rapid City, SD, and then drive one hour east.\n\nAirport\n\nThe closest airport is Rapid City Regional Airport.\n\nThe graphic below is from their website. It does a great job of showing which airlines fly into Rapid City, from where, and during what time of year. More information on the seasonal flights shown below can be found here.\n\nFor the budget-conscious: If you’re traveling in a big family and looking at purchasing many plane tickets, another option worth considering is flying into the Denver International Airport. They are a much larger airport serving many more airlines.\n\nIt would be about a 6-hour drive from the Denver airport to Badlands National Park, but it still might be worth the added travel time in the long run.\n\nRental Car\n\nYou will need a car to access Badlands National Park. So once you land, you will need to either rent a car…\n\n…or… why not be like us and rent an RV? (I give a shout-out to one of our all-time favorite RV parks down below!)\n\n👉 Save up to 25% on your travel costs by booking an RV through RVshare!\n\nDriving to Badlands National Park\n\nOkay, so now you have your rental car! Or perhaps you drove all the way from home. Next is getting to the park.\n\nBadlands National Park has three entrances, the Pinnacles Entrance, Interior Entrance, and Northeast Entrance.\n\nVisitors from the west (including those coming from the Rapid City airport) will enter the park through the Pinnacles Entrance. Take 90 east to exit 110 in Wall, SD, then continue south on 240 for 8 miles.\n\nVisitors from the south will enter the park through the Interior Entrance. Take 44 north until you hit 377 in Interior, SD. At the 377 junction, turn right, and you’ll be in the park in less than 2 miles.\n\nVisitors from the east will enter the park through the Northeast Entrance. Take 90 west to exit 131 in Cactus Flat, SD, then continue south on 240 for 3 miles.\n\nWhat’s the cost associated with visiting Badlands National Park?\n\nAs of March 2024, the entrance fees are as follows:\n\nPrivate Vehicle: $30 – Valid for 7 days\n\nMotorcycle: $25 – Valid for 7 days\n\nIndividual (hike, bicycle, etc…): $15 per person 16 and older – Valid for 7 days\n\nBadlands National Park Annual Pass: $55\n\nAmerica the Beautiful Annual Pass: Or, for $80, you can get an America the Beautiful Annual Pass and have access to all of the nation’s National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, National Forests, and National Grasslands for one year (or for a lifetime if you’re over 62)!\n\nFree Days: For the budget-conscious (who also aren’t afraid of crowds), the National Parks always offer free admission a few days a year. Here’s a link to check out the dates for 2024.\n\nOne Day Badlands National Park Itinerary:\n\nNow, let’s get into how to spend the perfect day at Badlands National Park!\n\nBadlands National Park can be easily explored in one day. Many choose to spend a long weekend or week split between Badlands National Park and the Black Hills area.\n\nI recommend spending at least one day in each spot. Both are beautiful and offer different experiences.\n\n👉 Check out my Black Hills guide here.\n\nThe parts of the park that are easily accessible via your car are not overwhelming. It is very possible to hit up all the highlights in one day. Also, as you will see, most of the popular trails are short and don’t entail much time at all.\n\nThis itinerary is best for people coming in through the Northeast Entrance or the Interior Entrance.\n\nIf you’re entering the park from the airport through the Pinnacles Entrance, you may choose to mix a couple of things up.\n\nBen Reifel Visitor Center\n\nWe almost always go to the park’s Visitor Center first before going anywhere else.\n\nI generally walk in with a plan, lay it down in front of a ranger, and ask them if my schedule is insane or doable.\n\nFor the most part, this has worked out well for us, and the rangers are generally happy to help. (I did once wait in line only to be greeted by an angry ranger at Yosemite, but we don’t talk about him.)\n\nI also tell them our hiking skill level and ask them if there’s anything unique they think we’re missing out on that I haven’t included. We’ve found some really amazing hikes this way! I listed out a ton of them in this blog post.\n\nCliff Shelf Nature Trail\n\nAlltrails Rank: #7 of 10 in Badlands National Park\n\nDistance: 0.5 mile\n\nRoute Type: Loop\n\nElevation Gain: 65 Feet\n\nDifficulty: Easy (There are stairs)\n\nDuration: 1 hour\n\nPet-Friendly: Pets are not allowed on hiking trails, public buildings, and in backcountry areas in all of Badlands National Park.\n\nParking: There is a parking lot at the trailhead.\n\nNext, after the Visitor Center, I would head on over to the Cliff Shelf Nature Trail. This short loop hike is an excellent introduction to the park. This hike gets you elevated a bit and gives you a lookout over the park.\n\nIt should be noted there are some stairs involved on this hike, but it’s a loop, so you can turn around when you hit them if they’re not for you.\n\nAlso, this is rattlesnake country, so be on the lookout while hiking.\n\nFood Break\n\nIf you were to ask my father, I am notoriously bad at planning times to eat into my trip plans. I find planning lunch and dinner as one of the most challenging things to organize for a group because everyone has their own eating habits they are accustomed to.\n\nSo, if you’re like my dad and like to know that food has been thought out, I’m going to point out a few good stops for food breaks along the way.\n\nIf you’re hungry for lunch at this point, I propose taking a quick drive back to the Ben Reifel Visitor Center picnic area since you’re still close.\n\n(You’ll also still be close after the upcoming Notch & Door Trail hikes.)\n\nIf you did not bring lunch, there is also a restaurant in the Cedar Pass Lodge directly next door to the Visitor Center.\n\nNotch Trail\n\nAlltrails Rank: #1 of 10 in Badlands National Park\n\nDistance: 1.3 miles\n\nRoute Type: Out & Back\n\nElevation Gain: 131 Feet\n\nDifficulty: Moderate (Mostly due to the ladder.)\n\nDuration: 1 hour\n\nPet-Friendly: Pets are not allowed on hiking trails, public buildings, and backcountry areas in Badlands National Park.\n\nParking: There is a parking lot at the trailhead.\n\nNext, take a quick ride north to the next parking lot, which serves as the main parking area for five separate trailheads.\n\nIn this area, I suggest starting with the best of the best, the Notch Trail!\n\nAs you start this hike, you’re surrounded by some hills, greenery, and shrubs. But before you know it, the green all starts to disappear, and you’re in the middle of what appears like a small white rock canyon. It starts to feel like you’ve been transported to another planet.\n\nThen you reach the ladder.\n\nFor anyone freaked out by the ladder, there is a roundabout option, but the ladder honestly looked easier to me.\n\nYou then get to walk up to the tops of the Badlands hill peaks.\n\nEventually, you will come to a spot where you can go left or right. I suggest giving both a try.\n\nHere’s the view from the left:\n\nAnd the view from the right:\n\nDoor Trail\n\nAlltrails Rank: #2 of 10 in Badlands National Park\n\nDistance: .25 mile + a .5 mile extension\n\nRoute Type: Out & Back\n\nElevation Gain: 36 Feet\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nDuration: 1 hour\n\nPet-Friendly: Pets are not allowed on hiking trails, public buildings, and backcountry areas in Badlands National Park.\n\nParking: There is a parking lot at the trailhead.\n\nNext, stay parked in the same parking lot and make the short walk to the opposite end where the Door Trail begins.\n\nIt starts with a very short boardwalk trail. But, at .25 of a mile in, that part ends quickly.\n\nYou can then continue along, following an unmaintained trail with numbered poles scattered all around, marking the ground. Eventually, you’ll reach a sign that says “End of Trail,” with an epically expansive view of all the colors and mountain peaks behind it.\n\nThis trail is neat because you are entirely free to roam, and you feel as if you’re in the middle of the canyon.\n\nBadlands Loop Road Scenic Drive\n\nAfter you’ve got a few of the park’s short yet stunning hikes under your belt, I recommend taking a ride on the Badlands Loop Road.\n\nBadlands National Park is relatively small in comparison to many other National Parks.\n\nOne amazing thing about it, especially for families, is that a lot of what it offers can be seen directly from the beautiful 31-mile two-lane Badlands Loop Road. (About 28 miles of it being within the park boundaries). And there are so many spots along the way that you can stop for a closer look and a leg stretch.\n\nBelow is a combination of recommended stops (from east to west) via various bloggers, park rangers, and some of my personal favorites.\n\nBig Badlands Overlook\n\nCedar Pass\n\nNorbeck Pass\n\nPanorama Point\n\nFood Tip: There is a picnic area right before this overlook at Bigfoot Pass Overlook\n\nConata Basin Overlook\n\nYellow Mounds Overlook\n\nThere will always be spots we didn’t get to explore. If I went back tomorrow, I’d make sure this made it onto our schedule.\n\nFood Tip: There is another picnic area right past this overlook. Once leaving, you’ll see Conata Road (509) to your left. Turn down that unpaved road; the picnic area is less than 1 mile down the road.\n\nPinnacles Overlook (skip this for now, come back for sunset)\n\nRoberts Prairie Dog Town\n\nRoberts Prairie Dog Town\n\n(SWITCH ONTO SAGE CREEK RIM ROAD)\n\nA short distance after passing Pinnacles Overlook, you’ll arrive at a point where you can either turn right or left.\n\nTurning right will take you out of the park via the Pinnacles Entrance/Exit. Turning left will take you onto the unpaved Sage Creek Rim Road.\n\nIf you’re hoping to see animals, we saw a ton here! Bison, Prarie Dogs, and Bighorn Sheep galore!\n\nSo I would recommend taking the unpaved road, at least to Roberts Prarie Dog Town, to see all of the animals along the way.\n\nDinner Break\n\nNow would be a great time to take a short 8-mile drive outside of the park to Wall, SD.\n\nYou can’t really come to this part of the nation without a stop at Wall Drug. No matter which direction you came from, you definitely saw the billboards luring you toward their free ice water & 5 cents hot coffee.\n\nI visited as a kid, and now I’ve visited as an adult. It’s your typical roadside attraction with plenty of food and shopping. It’s also been turned into an Instagram Funland in the backyard.\n\nIf you’ve never been, you probably want to walk in just so you can say you’ve done it, so why not also jump on a barrel and grab dinner while you’re there?!\n\nPinnacles Overlook\n\nLastly, come back in and take in all that the Pinnacles Overlook has to offer during sunset.\n\nGoogle Maps Link\n\nTo make your life a bit easier, below is a Google Maps link, including every spot that has been referenced in this blog post.\n\nIf you have more time, other things to do in Badlands National Park\n\nIf you have more time, I suggest taking a trip down Old Northeast Road and exploring either Castle Trail, Medicine Root Trail, or Saddle Pass Trail.\n\nMy husband and I did a marathon training run on the Castle Trail in the evening, and it was just stunning. Another one that you feel inside the canyon.\n\nSomething additional that would be cool for kids is a stop at the Fossil Exhibit Trail. It’s a .4 mile round trip out and back trail that is wheelchair friendly and good for hikers of any skill level. Along the way, there are educational displays and fossil replicas.\n\nTours of Badlands National Park\n\nIf you’ve read through all of this and decided you’d rather be guided around the Badlands, then I am always a fan of being guided by a local!\n\nBadlands Tours offered by locals:\n\nTours By Locals – Tour Options:\n\n⭐️ Badlands National Park Tour by Kevin Q.\n\n⭐️ A Day in the Dakota Badlands Tour by John E.\n\n⭐️ The Badlands – Daylight, Sunset & Night Sky Tour by John E.\n\n⭐️ Badlands of South Dakota by Day Tour by Cynthia P.\n\n⭐️ Daylight and Sunset in the Badlands of South Dakota Tour by Cynthia P.\n\n👉 Book tour guides from Tour By Locals who are available in the Rapid City area.\n\nGet Your Guide – Tour Options:\n\n👉 Book available tours in the Badlands area from Get Your Guide.\n\nViator – Tour Options:\n\n👉 Find and book South Dakota tours and activities on Viator.com\n\nWhere to stay near Badlands National Park\n\nBadlands National Park RV or Tent Lodging\n\nRV or Tent Lodging in the Park\n\nIf you’re looking to camp within the National Park, there’s the Cedar Pass Campground and the Sage Creek Campground, as well as Backcountry Camping options available.\n\nRV or Tent Lodging near the Interior Entrance\n\nBehold the camping paradise known as Badlands Motel & Campground!
