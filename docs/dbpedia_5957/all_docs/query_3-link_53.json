The memorial is in South Dakota, about 1,500 miles from either coast but only 50 miles from the geographic center of the nation.\n\nBut embarrassment is not the only reason for the chuckles about Mount Rushmore. Even people who have been there may have reasons to consider it lightly. I have lived practically in the shadow of the memorial for many years, and at least once a summer friends or relatives come for a visit. Since I have been to Mount Rushmore about 400 times, I try to put off going there for as long as possible. I do my best to interest my guests in other South Dakota activities: fly fishing, hiking, drinking wine as the sun sets. But there is no escaping it -- eventually we pile into the car and join the two million other tourists who visit the monument each summer.\n\nMount Rushmore is South Dakota's Statue of Liberty, its Bourbon Street, its Disneyland -- and therein lies a problem. It is in the Black Hills, and as you wind your way south from Rapid City, you can see the stark and beautiful Badlands 60 miles off to the east. For me, the trip is more pleasant in the wintertime, after the crowds have receded, but still bearable in the summer -- until you get to the town of Keystone, just two miles from the memorial. If it is around the Fourth of July, you will suspect you have stumbled onto a set for one of Chevy Chase's \"Vacation\" movies.\n\nThe town is a strip of storefronts erected in an otherwise lovely mountain valley for the sole purpose of siphoning off a few tourist dollars as the annual run, like salmon in a stream, winds its way to Mount Rushmore. Keystone is part of the Rushmore experience. It is a tasteless place, with a booming seasonal economy, once described by a friend as an exotic bazaar for tacky people. You can get cheap jewelry, fake Indian artifacts, saltwater taffy, cotton candy, corn dogs, stuffed buffaloes, cowboy hats, a million kinds of T-shirts and photographs of real gunslingers. There are arcades, a museum dedicated to Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of the monument, and a dozen fast-food restaurants.\n\nTO MY ETERNAL amazement, Keystone is often the zenith of my guests' vacation. The kids go crazy and, though the adults try to stay cool, you can see in their eyes that this, after days or weeks of travel, scenery, fresh air and history lessons, is what they are looking for. They seem to love Ms. Piggy's Burger Pit, where they can get their choice of a Hundred Percent Pure Buffalo Burger or a Ms. Piggy's Monstrous Mammoth Burger. There are several buffalo ranches nearby, which explains the buffalo meat. Where Ms. Piggy gets the mammoth meat, I'll never know.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
