        "text": "\"Only the thinnest layer of flesh was tautly stretched and strained across her bones and her eyes seemed sunken back intoher head.\" That's a quote from The Woman in Black. Don't you love a good ghost story?\n\nThe Woman in Black by Susan Hill is a Gothic ghost story. It's set in an isolated house, surrounded by marshland, where amysterious woman casts a shadow over the nearby village and haunts a young man.\n\nThe story is told by Arthur Kipps. He remembers how, when he was a young lawyer, he was sent to settle an elderly lady's will. At the funeral, Arthur notices a strange young woman dressed in black. Her face is withered and thin. But he soon realised he wasthe only person who could see her.\n\nAt the dead lady's house, Arthur sees the young woman again. This time he is taken aback by the wicked expression on her face.Over the next few days, Arthur hears spooky noises in the house and on the surrounding marsh. Is he alone or is something or someone with him?\n\nWhen Arthur finds a bundle of letters, he learns the truth behind the ghostly visions. But is he caught up in the Woman in Black'scurse himself?\n\nArthur Kipps, the narrator, is reserved and secretive as an older man. But before his ordeal with the Woman in Black he was open,adventurous and outgoing.\n\nJennet Humfrye, the Woman in Black, suffered a cruel injustice when she was alive. She seeks revenge in the afterlife and hauntsher victims without pity.\n\nThis novel uses the Gothic themes of physical and psychological isolation. These themes play on the mind of the reader as Arthuris driven to question what is real and what is not.\n\nThe Woman in Black by Susan Hill â I could not put it down and read it all in two nights but I did need to sleep with the light on."
