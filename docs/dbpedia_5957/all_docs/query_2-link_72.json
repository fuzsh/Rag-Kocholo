        "text": "People often say that college\n\nis the best four years of your life,\n\nbut it was also likely that it was some\n\nof the best architecture you've been around as well.\n\nI'm Michael Wyetzner,\n\nand I've been an architect for over 35 years.\n\nAnd today we're going to look at the five most common styles\n\nof university architecture.\n\nSo what is it about university architecture\n\nthat gives you a feeling you can only get on campus?\n\n[bright music]\n\nThere are some things\n\nthat nearly all college campuses have in common.\n\nFor one thing, they all work like a self-contained city,\n\nand that's because nearly all\n\nof them share a common design starting point,\n\nthe quadrangle, or as it's known today, the quad.\n\nFor centuries learning was largely the monopoly\n\nof the religious orders\n\nand architecturally this manifested itself in the cloisters\n\nand monasteries of monks.\n\nThese monasteries were self-contained groups\n\nof buildings typically connected to a cathedral,\n\nand also providing housing, study chambers and dining halls.\n\nAnd all of these buildings were connected\n\naround an interior courtyard,\n\nknown as a cloister or a garth.\n\nThis later became the model\n\nfor today's college quadrangle or quad.\n\nTwo of the earliest universities founded\n\nin the western world used these cloisters as a model.\n\nSo Oxford was founded nearly a thousand years ago in 1096,\n\nand Cambridge followed just a hundred years later in 1209.\n\nIn fact, Jesus College at Cambridge\n\nstarted off as a monastery.\n\nBut even though almost all universities\n\nshare these elements, campus architecture\n\ncomes in a wide variety of styles.\n\nSo let's take a look at some of the most common styles\n\nof collegiate architecture in the US.\n\nFirst up, the colonial style.\n\nThe first university founded in the United States\n\nwas Harvard in 1636,\n\nwhich means it wasn't even the United States yet,\n\nit was still Britain.\n\nIn fact, Cornell was the only Ivy League school\n\nbuilt after the Declaration of Independence.\n\nSo it makes sense that all these universities\n\nwere built in the British style of the time,\n\nwhich was Georgian, named after the kings George.\n\nAnd speaking of the Declaration of Independence,\n\nthe author of that great document was Thomas Jefferson,\n\nwho was also the founder\n\nand architect of the University of Virginia.\n\nThomas Jefferson was a great and flawed\n\nand complicated human being.\n\nHe was a lawyer, he was a scientist, a philosopher,\n\na writer, a revolutionary, an ambassador, a governor,\n\na secretary of state, a vice president and a president.\n\nAnd he was also a slave owner.\n\nAlthough he wrote the Declaration of Independence,\n\nhe never lived up to its strong words\n\nabout equality and freedom.\n\nDespite his well-documented moral failings,\n\nhe was also indisputably one\n\nof the greatest architects of the colonial era.\n\nSo let's take a look\n\nat Thomas Jefferson's University of Virginia.\n\nSo this was built in 1819.\n\nSo here's everything that jumps out at me.\n\nJefferson designed it in this quasi Georgian style,\n\nbut it's really more Palladian,\n\nreferring to the great Italian architect Andrea Palladio,\n\nand Palladio based his architecture on classical Greek\n\nand Roman architecture.\n\nStraight away is the Rotunda,\n\nwhich is obviously based on the pantheon in Rome\n\nwith its dome and its columns impediment over the entrance.\n\nThe other thing Jefferson did\n\nwas he built what he called an academical village,\n\nand he built it around this stepped courtyard,\n\nand you could see this courtyard stepping up.\n\nAnd in the other direction, he opened it up\n\nto the view of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia.\n\nLater that view was blocked by a building\n\nby McKim, Mead and White, which is really one\n\nof the most regretful architectural mistakes.\n\nThese buildings were made from red brick.\n\nIn fact, the columns, which appear to be stone,\n\nare actually built from brick as well,\n\nplastered over and then painted.\n\nAnd many buildings in colonial America\n\nwere built from red brick.\n\nIn fact, in Britain at the time,\n\nthe term red brick University\n\nwas used to describe newer schools\n\nthat came after the venerated Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nSo let's take a look at the plan of the university.\n\nSo what we just saw in that previous photograph\n\nwas that Pantheon-like building\n\ncalled the Rotunda right here, which is the library.\n\nAnd then there were those arcade wings\n\nthat were built around this stepped lawn in the center.\n\nAnd then he built two outer wings\n\non either side called the Hotels where people live.\n\nIn fact, Edgar Allan Poe lived there\n\nwhen he attended the university.\n\nAnd between these wings\n\nand the Hotel wings was called the Range,\n\nwhich was just filled with these gardens,\n\nand within that Range,\n\ncreated his famous undulating brick walls.\n\nThe other thing that Jefferson does\n\nwhich is so interesting, is he creates these pavilions\n\nto interrupt the long arcade.\n\nAnd each pavilion references a building\n\nfrom the Roman forum.\n\nJefferson had helped with the design of the university\n\nfrom Benjamin Latrobe and Dr. William Thornton.\n\nIn fact, Benjamin Latrobe\n\nis considered the first professional architect\n\nin the United States.\n\nBut ironically, after the US declared independence,\n\nnewer schools wanted to look older.\n\nSo let's take a look at the next wave\n\nof university styles in the US, Collegiate Gothic.\n\nThe Collegiate Gothic style\n\nis probably one of the most familiar\n\nto the over 170 million Americans who hold a college degree.\n\nThere are countless examples of university buildings\n\nfrom every decade built in this style,\n\nincluding Duke University Chapel,\n\nWashington University in St. Louis,\n\nthe City College in New York City,\n\nthe University of Chicago,\n\nand the Cathedral of Learning\n\nat the University of Pittsburgh,\n\nwhich is actually the tallest educational building\n\nin the Western Hemisphere.\n\nAs recently as 2017, Yale built yet another building\n\nin the Collegiate Gothic style.\n\nBut although these buildings wanted\n\nto make themselves appear older and more prestigious,\n\nmany of them didn't even use a lot of the gothic elements\n\nother than making themselves out of masonry and stone.\n\nSo typically what became the Collegiate Gothic style\n\nwere buildings that were built out of masonry, brick,\n\nlocally sourced stone whose openings were trimmed\n\nwith limestone and had limestone ornament at the roof\n\nand other places on the building.\n\nAnd really the first Collegiate Gothic building\n\nin the United States was the building known as Old Kenyon,\n\nthe residence hall at Kenyon College in Ohio in 1824.\n\nOkay, so here's everything that jumps out at me.\n\nThe pieces that employ gothic architecture\n\nreally only include the series of windows\n\nat the uppermost floor that use the pointed gothic arch.\n\nThe spires that you see on all the corners\n\nand at the top of the gable\n\nand this mains spire that you would also see on a church.\n\nIt's also built out of stone,\n\nwhich nearly all gothic architecture was built out of.\n\nAnd these windows at the top\n\nthat use the pointed gothic arch\n\nand also use the gothic tracery\n\nin the uppermost sash of the window.\n\nThe parts of the building that are not gothic\n\nare much more abundant.\n\nMost of the windows actually are not gothic at all.\n\nIn fact, they just have a trabeated opening\n\nusing a flat lintel.\n\nThey also have these very pronounced dormers\n\nalong the roof line,\n\nand they also have these crenelated chimneys.\n\nCrenelations became part of the Collegiate Gothic language,\n\nbut were never really part of gothic architecture.\n\nThey're more medieval, they created these slots for soldiers\n\nto use bows and arrows against their enemies.\n\nSo this is an example of a building\n\nthat uses sort of a sprinkling of gothic elements,\n\nbut it's a far cry from a true Collegiate Gothic building.\n\nSo let's take a look at a building\n\nthat was built almost a hundred years later\n\nthat's far more faithful to the gothic style.\n\nIn fact, it looks like it could be the bell tower\n\nof a gothic church in Germany or France.\n\nWell, first off, it's made out of stone.\n\nSecondly, it has these buttresses that hold up the building,\n\nwhich was traditional in all gothic architecture.\n\nIt has these statues, which were also used\n\nto ornament gothic churches.\n\nIt has the pointed arch windows\n\nwith the fine tracery stonework between them.\n\nAnd you can even see the gargoyles sticking out\n\nalmost at the top.\n\nSo this really looks like an old fashioned gothic tower.\n\nIn fact, there was a legend at the campus\n\nthat they used acid to wash the stone\n\nto make it look even older, when in fact,\n\nmost people believe they just used dirty construction water.\n\nSo if you compare these two buildings,\n\nyou could really see the great range\n\nof Collegiate Gothic style on campuses.\n\nBut not every college wants to look like a piece of history.\n\nSo let's take a look at the next major style\n\nto take campuses by storm, modernism.\n\nLet's talk about the Illinois Institute of Technology,\n\na new campus designed from scratch in the 1940s\n\nby Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.\n\nMies had run the Bauhaus in Germany after Walter Gropius\n\nand Hannes Meyer from 1930 to 1933\n\nuntil it was shut down by the Nazis,\n\nwho viewed its curriculum as degenerate and un-German.\n\nAt that point, Mies fled to the United States,\n\nwhere he was courted\n\nby the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nNot since Thomas Jefferson's University of Virginia in 1819\n\nhad an American campus been the work of a single architect.\n\nInstead of designing the buildings\n\naround a central open space or quad,\n\nhe embraced the idea of the Chicago street grid\n\nand created two separate groupings of buildings,\n\none north of 33rd street and one south.\n\nOkay, so this is a typical building on the IIT campus.\n\nAnd you could see they're all two to three stories tall.\n\nThey employ brick and glass.\n\nHe uses a 24 by 24 foot module that you could see here,\n\nand you could see how the steel is expressed.\n\nSo you know how the building is constructed,\n\nthey all have flat roofs.\n\nAnd this style of architecture was so influential,\n\nnearly every high school in the United States\n\nthat was built in the '50s\n\nand '60s looks almost exactly like this.\n\nYou can see it's completely stripped of ornament.\n\nIt's very rational, which was a hallmark\n\nof architectural modernism.\n\nFor 16 years, between 1929 and 1945,\n\nbasically no new ground was broken on new buildings\n\nin the US and Europe because of the war\n\nand the Depression before it.\n\nAnd when building resumed,\n\ndesign and public appreciation\n\nof architectural aesthetics jumped from imitating antiquity\n\nto cutting edge modernism.\n\nCampuses were no longer interested in looking old.\n\nIt was a new world and time to embrace the future.\n\nAnd to some, the old world became associated\n\nwith the atrocities of the war.\n\nAnd so many schools started to build more\n\nand more modernist buildings.\n\nEarly modernism was political as well as aesthetic\n\nand associated with utopianism.\n\nIt endeavored to create a clean,\n\nhealthy, egalitarian, new world.\n\nBut that idea was wrecked by the realities of World War II.\n\nSo modernism now was no longer\n\nabout this sort of utopian world,\n\nand modernism just became another style.\n\nIt was about rationalism, functionality and hygiene.\n\nIn fact, many of these buildings were criticized\n\nfor looking all the same and looking like factories.\n\nSo let's talk about the most famous building\n\non the campus, which really stands out,\n\nand that's the architecture school called Crown Hall.\n\nCrown Hall is one of the most famous modern buildings\n\nin the world, and it was completed in 1956.\n\nAnd what's different about this building\n\nis that it's made out of glass.\n\nBut the most distinctive thing he did at Crown Hall\n\nwas he put the beams that support the roof\n\non top of the roof.\n\nSo the interior has absolutely no columns.\n\nAnd when you walk in, it is this one soaring plane\n\nof a ceiling, which creates this really exhilarating effect.\n\nMies is famous for sort of breaking open the box.\n\nSo before to create space or a room,\n\ntypically architects used four walls.\n\nYou entered in and you were in a room.\n\nBut Mies did something different.\n\nHe broke those walls apart and he just used planes.\n\nSo to create space, he put a wall here,\n\nand then he put a wall here,\n\nand then he put another wall here\n\nlike he did at the Barcelona Pavilion.\n\nAnd all of a sudden you've created a whole new way\n\nof space making.\n\nAnd he was the son of a stone mason.\n\nAnd so quite often he employed these beautiful materials,\n\nsome of them stone, some of them exotic woods.\n\nAnd he created these beautiful meandering spaces defined\n\nby these beautiful planes.\n\n[dramatic music] Next up, brutalism.\n\nThe Richards Medical Laboratory\n\nat the University of Pennsylvania,\n\na building that paved the way for the plethora\n\nof brutalist buildings on campuses across America.\n\nSo this building was completed in 1961\n\nby another giant of late 20th century architecture\n\nby the name of Louis Kahn.\n\nAnd the thing about Kahn was he was almost like this guru,\n\nand he was an existentialist who believed in the power\n\nand the poetry of architecture, and that's significant.\n\nHe had all these great aphorisms about architecture,\n\nand perhaps his most famous was,\n\nWhen you ask a brick what it wants to be,\n\nit responds, 'I like an arch.'\n\nThe building was completed by 1961,\n\nand it's made out of brick.\n\nAnd he took sort of the precepts of modernism,\n\nresponse to programmatic need, functionalism\n\nand an honest expression of materials\n\nand created a new kind of architecture.\n\nAnd one of the significant things he did here\n\nwas he separated served and servant spaces.\n\nHe created places for the technologies\n\nthat are required to serve modern buildings.\n\nSo exhaust towers and fresh air intakes\n\nand electrical bus duct runs\n\nwere all taken outside on the building.\n\nAnd you could see that in these towers\n\nthat run on the outside.\n\nAnd that was actually an idea that he derived from,\n\nbelieve it or not, Palladio from the 16th century\n\nwhere he was looking at Palladio's famous Villa Rotunda\n\nand realized, wow, that central space is actually served\n\nby the spaces around it.\n\nAnother thing that really influenced the design\n\nof this building was the Italian hill town of San Gimignano,\n\nwhich had all these beautiful towers of which these towers\n\nthat he created on the outside of the building\n\nfor the exhaust and intake of air, are very reminiscent.\n\nThis building was so influential\n\nthat there was an exhibition devoted entirely\n\nto this one building at the Museum of Modern Art,\n\nwhere they stated it\n\nwas probably the single most consequential building\n\nconstructed in the United States since World War II.\n\nIt certainly became one of the most influential.\n\nNearly every college campus in the US\n\nhas a building that was imitating it.\n\nThe other thing this building does\n\nis it sort of opens the door to brutalism.\n\nAnd by that I mean it's got large expanses\n\nof undifferentiated material, in this case it's brick.\n\nBut of course, the term brutalist was coined\n\nby another influential architect, Le Corbusier.\n\nSo this is the Carpenter Center at Harvard by Corbusier.\n\nIt was completed in 1963.\n\nIt's constructed from poured-in-place concrete,\n\nand it's considered an example\n\nof brutalism in the United States.\n\nCorbusier sort of coined the term for brutalism\n\nwith his poured-in-place concrete housing project\n\nin Marseille.\n\nIn fact, the term brutalism comes from the term Beton Brut,\n\nwhich means raw concrete in French.\n\nSo Corbusier essentially invented this brutalist style,\n\nand it became wildly popular on college campuses.\n\nSo these two buildings by Khan\n\nand Corbusier were hugely influential,\n\nbut some of Kahn's later buildings\n\nwhere he started to incorporate historical more obviously\n\nleads to a whole other style of architecture.\n\nAnd that's postmodernism.\n\nSo the progression into postmodernism is best exemplified\n\nby Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown's Gordon Wu Hall\n\nat Princeton University.\n\nVenturi wrote a book called Complexity\n\nand Contradiction in Architecture,\n\nwhich was a real groundbreaking work in 1966.\n\nOne might say it changed the aesthetics\n\nof architecture from minimalism to maximalism.\n\nPostmodernism is sort of a return\n\nto using historical references in architecture.\n\nSome people did it really quite cleverly,\n\nlike Venturi and Scott Brown,\n\nand others did it more clumsily\n\nwhere it just became sort of a watered down version\n\nof historical architecture.\n\nSo this building was built for Butler College,\n\nand it contains a dining hall,\n\nand it contains some offices, a lounge\n\nand spaces like that and a library.\n\nAnd the idea of it was\n\nto unify the different buildings of Butler College.\n\nAnd right next door, you could just catch a glimpse\n\nof one of the existing Collegiate Gothic buildings\n\nthat had already existed.\n\nThe first thing they did\n\nwas they created these big bay windows\n\nthat relate to that Collegiate Gothic building.\n\nThese sort of bay windows with the stone dividers\n\nbetween them is a classic motif\n\nof Collegiate Gothic architecture.\n\nAnd then they also throw in this Palladian window,\n\nanother reference to Palladio,\n\nat the center above the shed roof, which is really funny\n\nbecause you don't really see that\n\nin Collegiate Gothic architecture.\n\nAnd then they also have this sort of band\n\nof ornamented brick that terminates,\n\nor is interrupted, I should say, by this scupper\n\nthat's circular and outlined in stone trim as well.\n\nAnd then above the entrance, they overlap different images\n\nand they take these sort of cartoon versions\n\nof historic forms, some of which can be seen\n\nat Khan's building at Dhaka\n\nin these triangles and circles, for instance.\n\nOne of the funniest things they do in the building\n\nand most clever thing, they recess the entry\n\nand then that entry sort of becomes this huge expanse\n\nof glass along the ground floor.\n\nAnd that opening is obviously held up\n\nby this very long concealed steel lintel,\n\nwhich is out of view.\n\nBut what they do to be sort of clever and funny\n\nis then they put these sort of cartoon versions in stone\n\nof a keystone that would normally be the centerpiece\n\nof an arch that would support an opening like this.\n\nBut obviously that arch\n\nis not necessary 'cause of the steel.\n\nSo they're sort of making references to history\n\nof how buildings used to be built,\n\nhow buildings are currently built,\n\nand they're very clever the way they do it.\n\nSo in the same way that Venturi pulls\n\nfrom all different styles in one building,\n\ntoday, campuses are composed of buildings\n\nin a variety of styles.\n\nAlmost every campus has expanded\n\nfrom the day it was first founded,\n\nand as they grow, they tend\n\nto incorporate more architectural styles depending\n\non the fashion of the day,\n\nthe type of education happening inside,\n\nor even the type of students\n\nand donors they want to attract.\n\nIn fact, it is most likely that any given campus\n\nof a certain size will feature at least one building\n\nin each of these five styles.\n\nLet us know what your favorite collegiate style is\n\nin the comments below.
