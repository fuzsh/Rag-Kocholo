        "text": "Ilhan Abdullahi\n\nIlhan Abdullahi is a dedicated community organizer, storyteller, and advocate residing on the unceded traditional territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations. Committed to addressing health and social inequities, she focuses particularly on Black youth and newcomers. Drawing inspiration from her family's journey as newcomers in Canada, she actively engages in community outreach, research, and organizing efforts to contribute to the collective liberation of the communities she is a part of.\n\nIn addition to her advocacy work, Ilhan has a background as an educator in public health and currently teaches courses at Simon Fraser University. In 2020, she was nominated for the Top 100 Black Women to Watch in Canada, and in 2021, she was shortlisted for the Woman of the Year Award hosted by Muslims Achieving Excellence (MAX).\n\nWith a passion for storytelling that reflects the lived experiences of the communities she is a part of, Ilhan made her directorial debut in 2021 with the short documentary \"Dreamers\" through the Being Black in Canada program. This short film follows the aspirational journey of two Somali refugee youths aiming to become soccer professionals. In 2022, Ilhan received the Telus StoryHive Black Creator's Edition grant, co-creating her short comedy film, “Not For Us”, currently making its way through the film festival circuit. The film has screened at festivals across Canada and internationally, receiving award nominations. A recent alumna of the notable Whistler Film Festival Screenwriters Lab, she is currently working on her feature script, \"Lifeline,\" with the hopes of bringing it to the screen.\n\nIlhan recently embarked on a Ph.D. journey to center Black refugees in her research and explore the role of community organizing and social innovation in public health systems transformation. Through her work and research, she hopes to continue exploring how grassroots community organizing and the process of decolonization through systems change lens can contribute to the liberation of these communities.\n\nGloria Baylis (1929-2017)\n\nGloria Leon Baylis (born Clarke) was born on June 29, 1929 in Barbados. She was a British-trained, Caribbean migrant nurse who played a pivotal role in a landmark Canadian case. Baylis sought a part-time nursing position available at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel (QEH). The hotel was operated by Hilton of Canada at the time. She was denied the position. The timing coincided with the introduction of the Act Respecting Discrimination in Employment in Quebec, in September 1964. Baylis filed a complaint with the support of the Negro Citizenship Association. The ensuing legal battle lasted 11 years, culminating in the 1977 ruling by the Court of Appeal of Quebec. It marked the first instance in Canadian history where an institution was found guilty of racial discrimination in employment.\n\nBaylis, born into a middle-class family in Barbados, pursued her education as a means of upward mobility. She trained as a nurse in England and, in 1952, migrated to Montreal, Canada. Despite facing disparities in pay, she embraced her nursing career and, in 1964, applied for a position at QEH, sparking the historic legal case. The trial, known as Her Majesty v. Hilton, resulted in a $25 fine for Hilton of Canada. While the amount itself was insignificant even for that time, the case was a significant victory against racial discrimination in employment.\n\nCarrie Best\n\nCarrie Best was born on March 4, 1903, in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, to James and Georgina Ashe Prevoe.\n\nIn 1925, she married Albert T. Best and had a son, J. Calbert Best. Later, she became a foster mother to Berma, Emily, Sharon and Aubrey Marshall.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Mrs. Best and her son Cal were arrested for sitting downstairs in the whites-only seats at the Roseland Theatre in New Glasgow. Consequently, the pair was charged with disturbing the peace, convicted and fined.\n\nIn 1946, Mrs. Best founded The Clarion, the first Black-owned and published Nova Scotia newspaper. In 1952, her radio show, called The Quiet Corner, went on the air. It aired for 12 years and was broadcast on four radio stations throughout Canada’s Maritime Provinces. In 1968, she was hired as a columnist for the Pictou Advocate, a newspaper based in Pictou, Nova Scotia. The column ran until 1975 under the heading of “Human Rights.”\n\nThe following are some of Carrie Best’s most important achievements:\n\nMember of the Order of Canada in 1974\n\nAwarded the Queen Elizabeth Medal in 1977\n\nOfficer of the Order of Canada in 1979\n\nAwarded an honorary doctor of civil laws (DC.L.) from the University of King’s College, Halifax, in 1992\n\nFounded the Kay Livingstone Visible Minority Women’s Society of Nova Scotia in 1975\n\nInducted into the Nova Scotia Black Wall of Fame in 1980\n\nReceived the Harry Jerome Award in 1986\n\nReceived the Harambee Membership Plaque in 1987\n\nReceived the Black Professional Women’s Group Award Certificate in 1989\n\nReceived the Minister’s Award of Excellence in Race Relations—Minister of State for Multiculturalism, in 1990\n\nReceived the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission Award in 1991\n\nReceived the Town of New Glasgow Award for work in race relations in 1992\n\nReceived the Congress of Black Women Certificate in 1993\n\nCarrie Best died in July 2001 in New Glasgow.\n\nAbraham Beverley Walker (1851-1909)\n\nAbraham Beverley Walker was Canada's First Canadian-Born Black lawyer. Walker was also the first law student of any colour enrolled at University of New Brunswick (UNB), as well as the first Black New Brunswicker to Publish a Magazine.\n\nWalker was born in Belleisle, NB in 1851 and was of Loyalist descent. He appears to have attended school in Kingston, on the Kingston peninsula, the former shiretown of Kings County. As a young man, Walker worked as a stenographer and secretary for a touring lecturer in various provinces of Canada. Walker attended the National University in Washington, DC, a small institution that became part of George Washington University. He then studied law with a lawyer in Saint John and supported himself as a shorthand reporter. Walker was recognized as an attorney by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in 1881; a year later he was admitted to the bar as a barrister. Walker was unable to earn a living representing Saint John’s small Black community where he also faced racial discrimination from his white colleagues. Undeterred, Walker was active in the community, including the African Methodist Episcopalian Church, and his many letters were published in local newspapers. His wife operated a shop in Saint John. For a brief period, he tried his prospects in Atlanta, Georgia, where he published the pamphlet, The Negro Problem or The Philosophy of Race Development. He returned to study at the Saint John Law School, enrolling as its first student. The school was later absorbed by the University of New Brunswick. It would take almost 70 years before another Black student would enter the UNB Law School. Between 1893 and 1899 he served as the librarian for the Saint John Law Society. Walker was active in federal politics and worked for both the Conservative and the Liberal parties. In 1903 he was responsible for another ‘first’: the literary and public affairs magazine Neith, named after the ancient Egyptian goddess of war, the hunt and wisdom. The publication, which was advertised as a Canadian, not a Black journal, folded after five issues. His last crusade was his interest in the African Civilization Movement, which aimed to recruit educated and skilled Black people from Canada and other developed nations to build a model colony for Black people in Africa.\n\nAbraham Beverly Walker died of tuberculosis in 1909. He was posthumously awarded the Order Of New Brunswick in 2019.\n\nWesley Hall\n\nAs the chairman and founder of WeShall Investments, a private equity firm with a diverse portfolio of companies predominantly supporting BIPOC entrepreneurs, Wes Hall comes from humble beginnings in rural Jamaica.\n\nHe grew up in a plantation worker's shack as one of several children supported by his grandmother. Despite these challenges, his grandmother instilled in him the value of hard work, ambition, and industriousness. In 1985, Wes immigrated to Canada, where he set about to become the businessman you see today.\n\nDressed daily in a suit, Wes started as a mail clerk at a leading law firm in Toronto. His curiosity, intelligence, and ability to spot opportunities allowed him to turn a $100K loan from the bank to start his first business, Kingsdale Advisors, into becoming Canada's most preeminent shareholder advisory firm. Wes' expertise was invaluable on the complicated dispute between Toronto-based Goldcorp and Nevada-based Glamis Gold from 2004 to 2006, Xstrata PLC's USD 18-billion takeover of Falconbridge in 2006, and the $19-billion merger between Suncor and Petro-Canada in 2009.\n\nA staunch philanthropist, Wes is deeply committed to community upliftment. He founded the ambitious and highly successful BlackNorth Initiative to help end systemic anti-Black racism in Canada. He has instructed Black Entrepreneurship and Leadership at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, a first-of-its-kind course in North America. Wes is the vice-chair of the Board of Governors at Huron University College, a member of the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce, and sits on the board of directors for SickKids Foundation, TIFF, and Pathways to Education Canada.\n\nIn 2021, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce awarded him the Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce awarded him the Canadian Business Leader of 2022. Wes has received Honorary Doctorates from the University of West Indies, the University of Ottawa, Toronto Metropolitan University, Queen's University, the University of Toronto, and York University. He received the Medal of Distinction from Huron University in 2022 and the Nation Builder Award from the Empire Club in 2024. Wes was named one of Bay Street's top 40 most influential figures in the past 4 decades by the The Globe and Mail in 2024. Wes' other accomplishments include penning a bestselling memoir, \"No Bootstraps When You're Barefoot,\" which was a finalist for the 2023 National Business Book Awards. He launched a podcast in partnership with the Toronto Star, \"Between Us with Wes Hall,\" and is also on the hit CBC series, The Exchange Tower \"Dragons' Den.\" Wes is also an in-demand speaker invited to speak across Canada and a frequent guest on BNN Bloomberg.\n\nPiercy Haynes (1911-1992)\n\nPiercy Haynes came to Winnipeg with his family in 1912. As a young man, he excelled at sports and was a member of numerous championship softball and basketball teams and he was the city’s amateur welterweight champion in 1933 and 1934. He was also a gifted piano player and vocalist and soon became a fixture on Winnipeg’s music scene.\n\nDuring the Second World War, he tried to enlist with the Royal Canadian Navy but was told that minorities were not allowed. The close confines of ship life, it was thought, made it a potentially unsafe place for them. In protest, he repeatedly wrote to officials in Ottawa, including the Naval Secretary. The rules were changed, and Haynes became the first Black person in the modern Royal Canadian Navy. After the war, he began a 29-year career as a night porter with the Canadian Pacific Railway and continued to pursue a musical career. In 1943, he married Zena Bradshaw (1910-1990), a jazz singer from Edmonton.\n\nIn 1952, Zena Haynes and her sister Alva Mayes opened Haynes Chicken shack at the family home on Lulu Street. It became famous not only for its fried chicken but as a musical hotspot, even attracting internationally renowned visitors such as Billy Daniels, Oscar Peterson, and Harry Belafonte.\n\nHe was a Liberal candidate for the Logan constituency in the 1977 Provincial general election, a candidate for Winnipeg city council in 1980, and a member of Royal Canadian Legion and Winnipeg White Ensign Naval Club.\n\nWeyni Mengesha\n\nWeyni Mengesha is an award-winning film and stage director known for her ground-breaking work and community engagement.

Alexander was born in 1922 in Toronto. He served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War, between 1942 and 1945. He was educated at Hamilton’s McMaster University where he graduated in Arts, and Toronto’s Osgoode Hall School of Law where he passed the bar examination in 1965. Mr. Alexander was appointed a Queen’s Counsel and became a partner in a Hamilton law firm from 1963 to 1979. He was the first Black person to become a Member of Parliament in 1968 and served in the House of Commons until 1980. He was also federal Minister of Labour in 1979–1980.\n\nIn 1985, Lincoln Alexander was appointed Ontario’s 24th Lieutenant Governor, the first member of a racialized community to serve as the Queen’s representative in Canada. During his term in office, which ended in 1991, youth and education were hallmarks of his mandate. He then accepted a position as Chancellor of the University of Guelph. In 1996, he was chair of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation and was also made Honorary Commissioner for the International Year of Older Persons Ontario celebrations.\n\nThe Honourable Lincoln Alexander was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada and to the Order of Ontario in 1992, and in June 2006, he was named the “Greatest Hamiltonian of All Time.”\n\nMr. Alexander died on October 19, 2012, at age 90.\n\nOn December 2013, the Province of Ontario proclaimed January 21 (Lincoln Alexander’s birthday) as \"Lincoln Alexander Day\" and the following year, the Day was nationally recognized.\n\nMarie-Josephe Angélique (c.1705- June 21, 1734)\n\nAngélique was born in Madeira, Portugal around 1705, where she was enslaved and sold multiple times before being purchased by French merchant François Poulin de Francheville in 1725. She was brought back to Montréal to provide domestic labour. When Francheville died in 1733, ownership of Angélique was passed to his widow, Therese de Couagne.\n\nDuring her period of enslavement, Angélique had three children – some historians have said she was likely forced to do so, with another enslaved person, Jacques César. None of her children lived beyond infancy. Angélique also had a lover, an indentured white labourer named Claude Thibault. After asking for freedom and being denied, Angélique ran away with Thibault after setting fire to her bed. They were caught two weeks later in nearby Chambly.\n\nOnce Angélique returned to Montréal, she threatened to burn down the house of her mistress. On April 10, 1734, 46 buildings in Montréal’s merchant quarter were burnt down, including the convent and the hospital of the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal. The next day, Angélique was accused of starting the fire and arrested by police. She was charged with arson, punishable by death, and in a period where the accused were presumed guilty, had very little chance to prove herself innocent. Throughout her trial, she denied setting the fire.\n\nShe was brought before judge Pierre Raimbault, and six-week long trial started. Out of 23 people, 22 testified against Angélique, stating that although they did not see her start the fire, they were sure she did it. One witness testified for her innocence, the mistress herself, Therese de Couagne. It not until the 24th witness that the trial ended. A five-year old Amable Lemoine Monière, swore under oath that she saw Angélique going to the attic of the Francheville house with a shovel full of coals just before the fire. With such a testimony, the judge was able to find Angélique guilty.\n\nShe was to have her hands cut off and be burned alive, but the sentence was appealed to be less gruesome. The death penalty still remained, and Angélique was to be tortured, hanged and then her body burned. On the day of her execution, she was tortured by means of brodequins, and forced to confess to her crimes, and begged the pardon of God, the king, and the people. Angélique was then hanged and her body displayed on a gibbet for two hours, burned and her ashes scattered to the wind.\n\nOn one hand, Angélique, as an enslaved person living in New France with no rights, may have been an innocent, unfortunate victim of circumstances, rumours, and discrimination. On the other hand, Angélique may have set the fire as a message of rebellion, a cry for freedom of enslaved Black people. We will likely never know if Angélique was guilty or not, but her story and what she represents is well worth remembering.\n\nIn 2012, a public square in Montreal, Quebec, facing City Hall, was named Place Marie-Josèphe-Angélique.\n\nGeorges Anglade\n\nBorn on July 18, 1944, in Port-au-Prince, Georges Anglade was a Haitian-born geographer, politician and writer from Montreal.\n\nIn 1965, Anglade obtained a law degree and a diploma in Social Sciences from the Faculty of Law in Port-au-Prince. His opposition to the Duvalier dictatorship led him to leave Haiti for France. Between 1965 and 1969, he studied at the Center of Applied Geography in Strasbourg, where he obtained his doctorate. He also obtained a degree in literature at the University of Strasbourg in 1967. Between 1968 and 1969, he was a professor at the Institute of Demography in Strasbourg. His move to Canada, to Montreal, in September 1969, led him to be one of the co-founders of the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM), which contributed to the creation of a network of universities across the province where he taught social geography until 2002.\n\nAnglade was a staunch anti-Duvalierist, twice exiled in 1974 and 1991, and repeatedly threatened with death for opposing the Haitian authorities. He spent much of his adult life in exile in Quebec, where he founded the Haitian Solidarity Movement (MAS) in Montreal in the 1980s, and in 1990 published La Chance qui passe, a manifesto calling for democracy in Haiti. In the 1990s, he served as advisor and Minister of Public Works under the governments of Jean Bertrand Aristide and René Préval. In 1994, he chaired the Miami International Political Conference, which initiated the return to democracy in Haiti.\n\nAfter his government career, he intensified his literary activity, focusing on lodyans, which he theorized by writing stories of this genre.\n\nGeorges Anglade and his wife Mireille died suddenly, along with other family members, in the earthquake that devastated Port-au-Prince on January 12, 2010.\n\nThe Honourable Dr Jean Augustine\n\nJean Augustine is a trailblazing politician, social activist, and educator. She was the first African-Canadian woman to be elected to the House of Commons, the first African-Canadian woman to be appointed to the federal Cabinet, and the first Fairness Commissioner of the Government of Ontario.\n\nBorn in 1937 in Happy Hill, Grenada, Augustine overcame personal and economic adversity from an early age to excel academically, and began her career as a teacher. After arriving in Canada in 1960, she advanced her education and career prospects, participated in grassroots organizations to strengthen minority and women’s rights, and served her community and the City of Toronto with great passion and charisma. Augustine carried her roots and convictions in community service, education, and advocacy as she entered politics in 1993 as a Member of Parliament. In 1995, her proposed motion before Parliament to recognize February as Black History Month passed unanimously, thereby establishing a lasting tradition of celebrating the important contributions of Black Canadians to Canada’s history, culture, development, and heritage. Augustine continued on to serve in such key positions as Minister of State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women, member of the Queen’s Privy Council of Canada, and member of the Citizenship and Immigration Committee.\n\nAugustine has received numerous awards and recognitions for her work, including being inducted as Member of the Order of Canada in 2007, appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, as well as receiving honorary degrees from the University of Toronto, University of Guelph, McGill University, and York University.\n\nDr. Alexandra Bastiany\n\nDr. Alexandra Bastiany is a cardiologist at Thunder Bay Regional Health Centre.\n\nShe earned her medical degree and completed her Internal medicine and Cardiology training at the Université de Montréal (UdeM). She graduated with honors, as the UdeM Faculty of Medicine first Black valedictorian.\n\nDr. Bastiany then successfully completed a fellowship in Interventional Cardiology at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute (University of Alberta) in Edmonton, making her the first Black female Canadian Interventional Cardiologist.\n\nDr. Bastiany is fluent in English, French, and Haitian Creole.

Her twin brother died at birth, her father left when she was seven, and when Black was ten, she unexpectedly lost an older sister. Black started singing in church at age six, and with the inspiration of her late sister, Sharon, and the lack of women in Canadian media, Black decided to pursue a career in music by age twelve. After winning a local talent show and singing at numerous events, Black began travelling to New York to record by age 14. She later attended C.W. Jefferys Collegiate Institute, then Oakwood Collegiate for their music program. She went on to earn a degree in law enforcement at Seneca College, “I've always loved law because I experienced injustice . . .

Black released a number of independent songs, including “Rally’n”, which was nominated for a Juno Award and a MuchMusic Video Award in 1999. Her collaboration with 2 Rude and Grimmi Grimmi, “Dissin’ Us”, won Best Soul/R&B Video at the MuchMusic Video Awards in 2000.\n\nBlack’s debut album, I travelled, set for release in 2003, was delayed due to her label, MCA, being absorbed by Interscope. She then signed with Universal Music Canada and released her first album, This is Me (2005). Her single “Sweat of Your Brow” peaked at no. 16 on the Canadian charts, and won Dance/Recording of the Year at the Canadian Urban Music Awards (2005).\n\nBlack’s next album, Revival (2007), was dedicated to her late sister Sharon, and features her best-selling single to date, “Seven Day Fool”, which peaked at no. 9 on Billboard’s Canadian Hot 100 chart.

However, their former owner tracked them down there and tried to return them to slavery. In a highly publicized escape that left Detroit engulfed in riots, the Blackburns were able to make it to Canada. The Canadian Courts defended them against the threat of extradition. This was seen nationally and internationally as a symbol of Upper Canada’s role as a safe haven for Black refugees.\n\nThe Blackburns settled in Toronto and, in 1834, built their home on what are now the grounds of the old Sackville Street School. Thornton operated the first cab in the young city of Toronto. The Blackburns worked tirelessly in their new community for the abolition of slavery and to help other Underground Railroad refugees settle in Canada.\n\nIn 1985, archaeologists in downtown Toronto discovered what would become the most highly publicized dig in Canadian history: the remains of a house belonging to the Blackburns.\n\nKarolyn Smardz Frost spent years researching this era of the Underground Railroad. Her book, I’ve Got a Home in Glory Land: A Lost Tale of the Underground Railroad, which recounts the saga of Lucie and Thornton Blackburn, from slavery in Kentucky to freedom in Ontario, won the Governor General’s Literary Award for non-fiction in 2007.\n\nMeasha Brueggergosman\n\nMeasha Brueggergosman is a Canadian Soprano born June 28, 1977 in Fredericton, New Brunswick.

However, the staff refused to serve them because Fred Christie was Black. Fred Christie sued the tavern and the case eventually ended up in the Supreme Court, which ruled that the York Tavern had the right to refuse service to customers because of their race. Disappointed in losing his case, Fred Christie left Montreal in the mid 1940’s and settled in Saranac Lake, New York. The case is emblematic of an era of legalized racism, while its facts reveal the subtle ways in which racism unfolded in early 20th-century Canada.\n\nMiali-Elise Coley-Sudlovenick\n\nMiali-Elise Coley-Sudlovenick was born in Iqaluit (Frobisher Bay at the time of her birth) and her first language is Inuktitut.

Dr. Ligoure also became the publisher of The Atlantic Advocate, Nova Scotia’s first African Canadian newsmagazine, which played an important role in the lives of Black people during the First World War and a voice for immigrants from the West Indies in Eastern Canada.\n\nAs a Black man in Halifax, Dr. Ligoure was denied hospital privileges, so he established a private practice in his home in Halifax’s north end called the Amanda Hospital. His hospital served as a dressing station for the injured in the aftermath of the Halifax Explosion on December 6, 1917, the largest human-made explosions prior to the detonation of the first atomic bombs in 1945. Dr. Ligoure treated upwards of 180 people day and night, at no charge, including those who were turned away from hospitals. This carried on until December 28, 1917. Dr. Ligoure lived in Halifax for several years and died in 1922 at the age of 37.\n\nDr. Ligoure’s heroism and legacy have largely been overlooked. Artist and historian David Woods discovered Dr. Ligoure’s story in the 1990s.\n\nKathleen “Kay” Livingstone\n\nKathleen “Kay” Livingstone (1918-1975) was born in London, Ontario, in 1918. Her parents, James and Christina Jenkins founded the Dawn of Tomorrow, a pioneering publication for Canada’s Black community in 1921. From a young age, she was interested in the performing arts, studying music in Toronto and Ottawa.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Kay Livingston worked at the Dominion Bureau of Statistics in Ottawa. It was in Ottawa that she began a career as a radio host with \"The Kathleen Livingstone Show.\"In 1942, she married George Livingstone, and they moved to Toronto where they raised their children. Livingstone maintained her acting career, hosted radio programs on several stations, including the CBC and was called “one of Canada’s leading Black actresses” during this time.\n\nLivingstone worked to break down prejudice and promote equality of individuals of all origins and contributed to the development of a more tolerant society. She was deeply involved in expanding a collective awareness and pride in the Toronto Black community in the post-Second World War period. As well, she worked with the United Nations Association – Toronto Branch Women’s Auxiliary, the local YWCA Foreign Affairs Committee, the National Black Coalition of Canada, the Canadian Council of Churches, the Legal Aid Society, and Heritage Ontario.\n\nLivingstone was a founder of the Canadian Negro Women’s Association (1951). An early Canadian Negro Women's Association (CANEWA) undertaking, and one which would continue throughout the group's existence, was the provision of scholarships to deserving Black students. Later activities included the organization of the Calypso Carnival (forerunner of the Caribana Festival) as a fundraiser for other service projects.\n\nKay Livingstone actively engaged in creating a Canada-wide network of African-Canadian women. She was the driving force behind the first National Black Women’s Congress (1973), providing a national forum to address the concerns of Black women and advance their causes. Perhaps most importantly, the Congress inspired the delegates to maintain close ties with each other, leading to further conventions at Montreal in 1974, Halifax in 1976, Windsor in 1978, and Winnipeg in 1980. It was at the Winnipeg meeting that the Congress of Black Women was formed, an organization which today has over 600 members and is one of Kay Livingstone's legacies.\n\nIn the last years of her life, Kay worked as a consultant to the Privy Council of Canada, travelling the country in preparation for a conference on visible minorities in Canada (a term with which she is credited with coining). One of the people she met on these travels was Carrie Best; it is a credit to Kay Livingstone's influence that after her death in 1975, Ms. Best formed the Kay Livingstone Visible Minority Women's Society in her honour, an organization which to this day provides educational funding for deserving young women.\n\nGinella Massa\n\nAfro-Latina Muslim journalist Ginella Massa is a Canadian Screen Award-winner and is known as the host of Canada Tonight with Ginella Massa and a Special Correspondent for The National on CBC News Network.\n\nBorn in Panama, Massa immigrated to Canada in 1988. Massa, who was raised in Toronto and still call the city home, graduated with an Honours BA in Communication Studies from York University and has a diploma in Broadcast Journalism from Seneca College.\n\nIn 2015, Massa made history as the first television news reporter in Canada, and likely in North America, to wear a hijab on-air as a video journalist for CTV News in Kitchener, Ontario. She made international headlines again after anchoring the evening newscast at CityNews Toronto in 2016.\n\nWith over a decade of experience in news behind the scenes and on-air, Massa has worked for both local and national news outlets, in television and radio. Her on-air credits include CTV News, CityNews, Newstalk 1010, Rogers TV, and her writing has been published in the Globe and Mail, National Post, Chatelaine Magazine, and Refinery29 Canada.\n\nIn 2021, Massa received the Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Award. Massa and her husband welcomed their first baby girl in October 2022.\n\nMattie Mayes (1850-1953)\n\nMattie Mayes was the matriarch of Saskatchewan’s first and only Black pioneer settlement. Following the end of the American Civil War in 1865, thousands of formerly enslaved Africans migrated to Oklahoma, but following the introduction of segregation in 1907, dozens of African-Americans decided to make their way to Saskatchewan based on the Canadian Government’s offer of free homestead land for settlers in the West.\n\nTwelve families took up settlement in Eldon, 13 kilometers west of Maidstone, while others continued to Alberta. Mattie Mayes was a part of the twelve families who settled in Eldon, who became known as the “Shiloh People”, named for the tiny church that they worshipped. The church itself later became a graveyard and a school.\n\nThe Mayes family is perhaps the most famous of the Shiloh people. Mattie, who had been enslaved before she was freed and moved to Canada, began practicing as a midwife and became a well-respected member of the community. With her husband Joseph Mayes, they raised a family of 13 children.\n\nThe Shiloh settlement is home to the only Black cemetery in Saskatchewan, which was permanently closed in 1987. The Shiloh church and cemetery are now provincially protected heritage sites.\n\nElijah McCoy\n\nBorn in Colchester, Ontario, to parents who had escaped from slavery in Kentucky and arrived in Canada via the Underground Railroad, Elijah McCoy showed an early interest in machines and tools and an aptitude for mechanics. At a time when it was difficult for Black people to obtain training in the United States, his parents sent him to Edinburgh, Scotland to study mechanical engineering.\n\nUpon his return to North America, he took a job as a fireman with the railroad in Michigan. The “fireman” was the person who shovelled the coal to power the locomotive and who lubricated the moving parts during frequent stops. Elijah soon saw that he could put his knowledge and education to work by improving this lubricating process. He developed and patented a particular type of lubricating cup that dripped oil onto the moving parts of a train while it was in motion. While the origin of the expression is probably somewhat older, it is said that buyers of the lubricating oil cup asked specifically for the “Real McCoy” because it was extremely reliable and they wanted no substitutes.\n\nThat was just one of the products he developed and patented. For example, in response to his wife’s desire for an easier way to iron clothes, he invented and patented the portable ironing board.\n\nElijah McCoy held more than 50 patents, not just in Canada and the U.S. but also in France, Austria, Germany, Great Britain and Russia.\n\nDr. Onye Nnorom\n\nOnyenyechukwu (Onye) Nnorom was born on February 27, 1981 in Montreal to immigrant parents who arrived in Quebec in the 1970s. Her father, Eugene Nnorom, is from Nigeria and her mother, Patricia Nnorom, is from Trinidad and Tobago.

As an activist, she fought to remove discriminatory barriers that restricted education and employment opportunities for Blacks and other minorities in the 1940s and 1950s. She co-founded the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People alongside her husband, Rev. Dr. William P. Oliver.\n\nShe was also a strong advocate for Black women in Nova Scotia, and in 1947 she campaigned to end the exclusion of Black women from nursing training in Canada, leading the Board of the Children's Hospital in Halifax to take two Black women as nursing students. In 1953, she founded the African United Baptist Association (AUBA) Women’s Institute and was the first woman elected moderator for the AUBA in 1976.\n\nDr. Pearleen Oliver wrote a number of books, including A Brief History of the Coloured Baptists of Nova Scotia, 1782- 1953 (1953) and Song of the Spirit (1994).\n\nFor her work, Dr. Pearleen Oliver received several honours, including Honorary Doctorates from Saint Mary’s University (1990) and Mount Saint Vincent Univeristy (1993), the Woman of the Year Award, YWCA (1981 and 1991), and the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal (2002).\n\nWillie O’Ree\n\nOn January 18, 1958, Willie O’Ree stepped on the ice at the Montreal Forum to play his first game in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Boston Bruins — and made history.\n\nLike any Canadian kid, as a young boy Willie played hockey with his friends. And out there on the ice, he probably pretended to be his favourite player, deking around the defence taking shots, scoring goals. Actually playing in the NHL was something most of these kids only dreamed about. For O’Ree that dream came true. In fact, he became the first Black player in the NHL. Known for his speed and checking abilities, his career was cut short by an injury.\n\nToday, Willie O’Ree is the director of the NHL’s diversity program. He travels across Canada and the United States promoting and teaching the game of hockey to children from all cultural backgrounds.\n\nIn January 2008, fifty years after his NHL debut, Willie O’Ree’s home town of Fredericton, New Brunswick, named its new hockey arena Willie O’Ree Place, in honour of his achievements.\n\nOscar Peterson (1925-2007)\n\nOscar Peterson was a Canadian jazz pianist, composer and educator who is considered one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time. He was born in Montreal, Quebec, on August 15, 1925. He was raised in the poor St. Henri neighbourhood of Montreal, also known as Little Burgundy.\n\nOscar Peterson has 4 siblings. His parents hailed from the British Virgin Islands and St. Kitts. His mother, Kathleen, was a domestic worker. His father, Daniel, was a boatswain in the Merchant Marines and then a porter with the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nOscar began playing trumpet and piano at age 5. He focused solely on piano at age 8 following a year-long battle with tuberculosis. Oscar’s first instructor was his sister, Daisy.\n\nPeterson's early influences included jazz pianists such as Art Tatum, Nat King Cole, and Teddy Wilson. He began his professional career in the 1940s, playing with jazz bands in Canada and the United States. His first big break came in 1949, when he was invited to play with the Norman Granz Jazz at the Philharmonic tour.\n\nIn the 1950s, Peterson formed his own trio, which included bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis. The trio became one of the most successful and influential jazz groups of the era, performing and recording together until 1957. Peterson then formed a new trio with bassist Sam Jones and drummer Bobby Durham, which also gained great success.\n\nHe was renowned for his remarkable speed and dexterity, meticulous and ornate technique and dazzling, swinging style. He earned the nicknames “the brown bomber of boogie-woogie” and “master of swing.” By virtue of his many world tours he has become Canada's musical ambassador. He is a staunch champion of the equality of ethnic minorities.\n\nThroughout his career, Peterson recorded more than 200 albums and received numerous awards, including eight Grammy Awards. He collaborated with many other jazz musicians, including Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, and Ella Fitzgerald. Peterson is among the handful of jazz greats who resided outside the United States throughout his career.\n\nHe was made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1972, and promoted to Companion, its highest rank, in 1984. He was also a member of the Order of Ontario, a Chevalier of the National Order of Quebec, and an officer of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He also received numerous other honors from around the world.\n\nPeterson passed away on December 23, 2007, in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, but his music continues to be celebrated and enjoyed by jazz fans around the world.\n\nRichard Pierpoint\n\nRichard Pierpoint was a lad of 16 in Senegal, Africa when he was seized and sold into slavery in 1760. He was purchased by an English officer named Pierpoint who had settled in New York’s Hudson Valley. Richard became this officer’s servant and adopted his surname. The officer and Richard were mustered during the 1763 Aboriginal uprising in British North America, but likely saw no action.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the American Revolution, Richard was given his freedom and eventually became a soldier, joining John Butler’s corps of Rangers operating out of Fort Niagara. When the war of the revolution ended in 1783, Butler’s Rangers were disbanded and the men were provided with land grants in what would become the Niagara region of Ontario. Richard received 200 acres of land in present-day St. Catharines and became somewhat of a community leader among Niagara’s Black population.\n\nWhen the War of 1812 broke out Richard Pierpoint petitioned Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, proposing the formation of an all-Black company of militia to fight alongside the British during the war. Brock agreed with the proposal and ordered the formation of what was known as the “Coloured Corps,” a small company of about 40 men from the Niagara and York districts mustered under white officers. The 68 year-old Richard Pierpoint served as a private in the corps and served on active duty throughout the conflict, including the Battle of Queenston Heights on October 13, 1812 when the corps was mentioned in dispatches as having played a key role in that British victory.\n\nThe Coloured Corps fought at the Battle of Fort George in May 1813, and were active in the Niagara campaign of 1813. In 1814 they worked on construction of fortifications, many of the men of the company having skills in carpentry and masonry.\n\nWhen the war ended, the British offered land grants to the veterans of the Coloured Corps, establishing settlements in Oro and Garafraxa Townships. He petitioned the government to provide passage for him back to Senegal in Africa but this was never granted. He was given another land grant of 100 acres in Garafraxa in 1822 and was able to build a house and clear a few acres there but he was too old to farm it properly. Pierpoint died there in 1838.\n\nWatch the story of Richard Pierpoint, a key player in the War of 1812.\n\nMairuth Sarsfield\n\nMairuth Sarsfield (1925-2013) led a remarkable life as a storyteller, diplomat, television personality, and community activist.

Born on February 17, 1856, in California, Emma arrived in Salt Spring Island with her parents Sylvia and Louis Stark and her brother Willis at the age of 4. On Salt Spring Island, 4 other siblings were born: John Edmond, Abraham Lincoln, Anne Serena and Marie Albertine. In 1875, the family moved to Cedar, in the Nanaimo area, where her youngest sister Louisa was born in 1878.\n\nEmma attended Salt Spring Island Central School, and she completed high school at Nanaimo High School at a time when a high school certificate was the required qualification for teaching.\n\nOn August 1, 1874, at the age of 18, Emma became the first black teacher on Vancouver Island. A notice was published in the local newspaper and she was hired to teach in a one-room schoolhouse in the Cedar district.\n\nShe stayed in the teacher's cabin and boarded with children who lived away from the school. Mary, her younger sister, was one of these children.

Louis and their two small children migrated to British Columbia.\n\nThe Starks lived on Saltspring Island for fourteen years. Sylvia worked on the farm, took care of her family and acted as a volunteer nurse and midwife. In 1875 the Starks moved to the Nanaimo district where Sylvia remained until her husband’s death in 1895. She returned to live with her son, Willis, on Saltspring where she was quite active, hardworking and alert almost until the time of her death at the age of 106 in 1944.\n\nEmma Stark is the oldest daughter of Louis and Sylvia Stark, Emma Stark is the eldest daughter of Louis and Sylvia Stark, was appointed the first teacher in the new North Cedar School in 1874, thereby becoming the first Black teacher on Vancouver Island.\n\nSenator Wanda Thomas Bernard, PhD, C.M., O.N.S,\n\nSenator Wanda Thomas Bernard is a highly regarded Nova Scotian educator, social worker, researcher, and community activist.

In 2016, she was appointed a Special Advisor on Diversity and Inclusiveness at Dalhousie University. In November 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed her to the Senate as an independent Senator representing Nova Scotia and as a result, Senator Thomas Bernard became the first African Nova Scotian woman to serve in the Senate Chamber.\n\nSenator Thomas Bernard is the first African-Canadian to hold a tenure-track position at Dalhousie University and to be promoted to full professor. She is a founding member of the Association of Black Social Workers, which helps address the needs of marginalized citizens, especially those of African descent.

For her work, she has received many honours, including the Order of Canada in 2004 and the Order of Nova Scotia in 2014.\n\nHarriet Tubman\n\nHarriet Tubman, a formerly enslaved individual from Maryland, became known as the “Moses” of her people and the “conductor” who led hundreds of enslaved Blacks to freedom along the Underground Railroad. In 1850, when the far-reaching United States Fugitive Law was passed, she guided runaway enslaved people further north into Canada. When angry slave owners posted rewards for her capture, she continued her work despite great personal risk.\n\nSt. Catharines, Ontario (a town close to the border with the United States) was on the route and offered employment opportunities, making it a common destination for the former fugitives, including Harriet Tubman, who lived there from 1851 to 1857. Many of the people she rescued were relatives of those already in St. Catharines including her own parents, brothers and sisters and their families.\n\nLater, Harriet Tubman became a leader in the Abolitionist movement. During the Civil war she worked as a nurse and served as a spy for the Union forces in South Carolina.\n\nJohn Ware\n\nJohn Ware was born into slavery on a South Carolina cotton plantation in 1845. After gaining his freedom in the emancipation, he moved to Texas and learned the tough life of a cowboy. In 1882, he settled in Alberta where he was immediately hired by Fred Stimpson of the Bar U and Quorn ranches.\n\nMr. Ware started his own ranch in 1891 in the Millarville area and became a successful rancher and farmer. By the end of the 19th century, he was one of the most well-known and respected ranchers in Western Canada. It is said that his skills at bronco and busting were legendary. He created “steer wrestling” 20 years before the Calgary Stampede—an event that has now become an integral part of the western festival.\n\nMr. Ware met the former Torontonian Mildred Lewis and they married, settling on a ranch just north of the village of Duchess along the Red Deer River. They had five children. In 1902, his home was washed away in a flood. They rebuilt the cabin on higher ground overlooking a stream, referred to today as the Ware Creek.\n\nJohn Ware continued to operate a ranch in southern Alberta until his death in 1905 from a horse-riding accident.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Ware’s two sons joined the No. 2 Construction Battalion, the only segregated Battalion in Canada’s history. The Battalion celebrates its 95th anniversary in 2011.\n\nMildred (Lewis) Ware (1871-1905)\n\nAlthough most stories written about the Wares are about John Ware, Mildred is not to be disregarded despite living a short life. She was born in 1871 in Toronto, and moved to Alberta in her late teens, marrying John in 1892, who was working for the well-known Bar U and Quorn Ranches.\n\nThe family moved to the Rosebud area in 1902, where their first home was destroyed by a flood. They rebuilt the ranch and ran a prosperous ranching operation with their herd increasing to over 1000 cattle. Mildred was responsible for the bookkeeping and taught her family of five children to read and write.\n\nIn 1905, Mildred died of pneumonia and typhus, and John died soon after. Despite the short life of the Wares, they have a lasting legacy with their Rosebud log house being preserved in Dinosaur Park as a tribute to one of Alberta’s most noteworthy ranching families.\n\nDorothy Williams\n\nDorothy Williams is a historian, author, educator, researcher, and community consultant specializing in Black Canadian history.
