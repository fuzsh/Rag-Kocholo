        "text": "Jennifer Saunders (“Absolutely Fabulous”), Laurence Olivier Award-winner Hiran Abeysekera (“The Life of Pi”) and Pippa Bennett-Warner (“Gangs of London”) have joined the cast of the film adaptation of Enid Blyton‘s “The Magic Faraway Tree,” which is currently in production.\n\nThe film, based on Blyton’s beloved “The Faraway Tree” series, follows the Thompson family as they move to the English countryside and discover a magical tree. The fantastical tree’s residents transport visitors to distant lands, setting the stage for a series of whimsical adventures.\n\nSaunders has been cast as the children’s grandmother, Abeysekera as the Angry Pixie, and Bennett-Warner as the grandmother’s assistant, Hannah. Newcomers Delilah Bennett-Cardy, Billie Gadsdon and Phoenix Laroche will play the Thompson children.\n\nThese actors join previously announced cast members Andrew Garfield, Claire Foy, Nicola Coughlan, Jess Gunning, Nonso Anozie, Dustin Demri Jones, Mark Heap, Oliver Chris, Lenny Henry, Simon Russell Beale and Michael Palin.\n\nPrincipal photography has begun, with filming taking place across the South of England and at Shinfield Studios, Reading. The screenplay is by Simon Farnaby (“Wonka,” “Paddington 2”), with Ben Gregor (“Britannia,” “Black Ops”) directing.\n\nNeal Street Productions, Elysian Film Group and Ashland Hill Media Finance are behind the project. Producers include Pippa Harris and Nicolas Brown of Neal Street Productions, Danny Perkins of Elysian Film Group, and Jane Hooks. Ashland Hill Media Finance is fully financing the film, with Palisades Park Pictures handling worldwide sales and CAA Media Finance co-repping U.S. rights.\n\nHarris said: “Just when we thought our casting line-up couldn’t get any more thrilling, we have been joined by these hugely gifted actors. I know they will bring wit, wonder and warmth to their performances and we’re delighted that they are joining us for this magical adventure.”\n\nAshland Hill’s managing partner, Simon Williams, added: “It’s a remarkable opportunity to have gathered such a stellar and magnetic cast. We couldn’t be more excited for audiences of all ages to be transported into a world they’ve never seen before, and to experience this wondrous story come to life.”"
