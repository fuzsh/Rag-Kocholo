        "text": "Tammy was an 18-year-old trans woman who, like Stormé and Marsha, was one of the first people to fight back.\n\nShe had lived with mob owner Fat Tony so was one of the few allowed to enter the bar in full women’s clothing. The bar was mostly made of a third white, third black and a third Hispanic with only a few trans women and drag queens allowed in, according to David Carter’s Stonewall biography.\n\nArrested and put in the paddy wagon for drag queens, Tammy escaped during the confusion.\n\nAccording to researchers, it is unknown what happened to her after 1969.\n\nStonewall riot veteran and gay rights activist Craig Rodwell, now deceased:\n\n\"There was a very volatile active political feeling, especially among young people,when the night of the Stonewall Riots came along, everything came together at that one moment. People often ask what was special about that night-there was no one thing special about it. It was just everything coming together, one of those moments in history that is: you were there, you know this is it, this is what we've been waiting for.\""
