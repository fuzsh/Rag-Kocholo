        "text": "As we celebrate Pride Month, itâs important to educate ourselves on events that have played a major role in paving the way towards equality for the LGBTQ community.\n\nOn June 28, 1969, police violently raided the Stonewall Inn, a predominantly gay bar in Manhattan, New York and proceeded to roughly haul employees and patrons out of the bar. This sparked six days of protests and clashes, many of which led by Black transgender women, like Marsha P. Johnson, between bar patrons and neighborhood residents and law enforcement.\n\nThe Stonewall Riots served as a catalyst for the gay rights movement and led to the creation of various gay activist groups in the United States and around the world. The day is now celebrated globally to honor the brave individuals who stood up to the system and protested for equality in 1969.\n\nWhile there is still more work to do, itâs important to remember this event and the people who helped set the foundation for the progress thatâs been made.\n\nD.C. United remain committed to equality for all and continuing to educate ourselves and our supporters. As we celebrate Pride Month and honor the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, we also celebrate our LGBTQ family who are such integral supporters of our club.\n\nLove is Love."
