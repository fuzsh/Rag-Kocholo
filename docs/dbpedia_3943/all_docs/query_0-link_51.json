        "text": "On June 12, 2016, while Gay Pride celebrations reveled across the country, a gunman opened fire inside a gay nightclub and massacred over 50 people in Orlando, Fla. Nearly 50 years ago, before Pride celebrations were even a blip on anyone’s radar, police raided a gay bar, supposedly for serving liquor without a license, and days of riots ensued. This month, as a campaign is underway for President Obama to name the Stonewall Inn a National Monument, EBSCO librarians Gabi Toth and Henry Armitage from the Core Collections and History Reference Center teams decided to take a look at the Stonewall Riots and the ensuing gay liberation movement.\n\nIn June of 1969, police raids on gay bars were frequent. During that time period, it was illegal to cross-dress or dance with a partner of the same sex. Police would often raid and subsequently close down gay bars and clubs. The close-knit community of gay men, drag queens and lesbians had had enough by the time the police attempted to shut down Stonewall. As patrons of the bar were arrested and hauled into police vans by the cops, a crowd gathered and started throwing objects, flames and coins at the police, who barricaded themselves inside the bar. The beloved space was no longer safe for its patrons to be themselves, and days of riots, protests and arguments with the police continued. One year later, the first Gay Pride Marches assembled in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nReflective of the time period, after the riots, the Deputy Police Chief of New York City had this to say: “For those of us in [the] public morals [division], things were completely changed ... Suddenly they were not submissive anymore.” Some four months after the riots, national news media began to take notice, and publications such as Time Magazine and Newsweek were writing articles detailing the rise of gay culture. In the aftermath of the riots, in October 1969, Time published an article titled “The Homosexual: Newly Visible, Newly Understood.” The author (who is not named) mentions what were then called “homophile organizations,” the culture of “fag hags,” and even a computer dating service. Although the article was not entirely favorable towards the new culture of out and proud gays (the author wonders whether there is a gay conspiracy to take over the media and theater), it was one of the first of its kind.\n\nThe legacy of Stonewall remains strong and still incites the fight for gay rights. In 2010, in a speech he made to LGBT activists during Pride Month, President Obama affirmed his commitment to repealing unfair laws (i.e. Don’t Ask Don’t Tell), making sure LGBT partners are afforded the same rights as straight couples, and passing hate crime legislation (the Matthew Shephard act). The events of Stonewall are often credited for paving the way to the reforms listed above, as well as the repeal of DOMA and the legalization of same-sex marriage across the US.\n\nPresident Obama also became the first president to address the GLBT community in an inaugural address, saying, “We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths — that all of us are created equal — is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma and Stonewall. . . Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.” In just 40 years, the events of Stonewall changed cultural thinking from referring to homosexuals as “militants” and “inverts,” to our President declaring his commitment to equal rights. However, with hate crimes still abounding, the fervor that fueled the spirit of the Stonewall Riots is alive and well."
