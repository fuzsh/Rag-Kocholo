And I could look at a guy and say, \"Well, objectively he's good-looking,\" but I didn't feel anything.\n\nJust didn't make any sense to me.\n\nWhat finally made sense to me was the first time I kissed a woman, and I thought, \"Oh, this is what it's about.\"\n\nAnd I knew that I was a lesbian.\n\nAnd, it was...\n\nI knew that I would go through hell, I would go through fire for that experience.\n\nFor those kisses.\n\n(yelling) FILM NARRATOR: Note how Albert delicately pats his hair, and adjusts his collar.\n\nHis movements are not characteristic of a real boy.\n\n♪ ♪ BOYCE: I wasn't labeled gay, just \"different.\"\n\nSomehow, being gay was the most terrible thing you could possibly be.\n\nAnd I just didn't understand that.\n\nI just thought you had to get through this, and I thought I could get through it, but you really had to be smart about it.\n\nClever.\n\nRemember everything.\n\n'Cause I really realized that I was being trained as a straight person, so I could fool these people.\n\nAs kids, we played King Kong.\n\nI would wait until there was nobody left to be the girl, and then I would be the girl.\n\nIf anybody should find out I was gay and would tell my mother, who was in a wheelchair, it would have broken my heart, and she would have thought she did something wrong.\n\nI could never let that happen, and it never did.\n\nO'BRIEN: I knew that the words that were being said to put down people was about me.\n\nI learned, very early, that those horrible words were about me, that I was one of those people.\n\n\"He's a faggot, he's a sissy, queer.\"\n\n\"Queer\" was very big.\n\n\"Homo,\" homo was big.\n\nMy last name being Garvin, I'd be called \"Danny Gay-vin.\"\n\nI was in the Navy when I was 17, and it was there that I discovered that I was gay.\n\nHomosexuality was a dishonorable discharge in those days, and you couldn't get a job afterwards.\n\nSo, I attempted suicide by cutting my wrists.\n\nI met this guy and I broke down crying in his arms.\n\nSaying, \"I don't want to be this way, \"this is not the life I want.\n\nI'm losing everything that I have.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church, be damned to hell.\n\nBecause to be gay represented to me either very super-effeminate men or older men who hung out in the upper movie theaters on 42nd Street, or in the subway tearooms, who'd be masturbating.\n\nFILM NARRATOR: Sure enough, the following day, when Jimmy finished playing ball, well, the man was there waiting.\n\n(engine starts) ♪ ♪ Jimmy hadn't enjoyed himself so much in a long time.\n\nThen, during lunch, Ralph showed him some pornographic pictures.\n\nJimmy knew he shouldn't be interested, but, well, he was curious.\n\nWhat Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick-- a sickness that was not visible, like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious.\n\nA sickness of the mind.\n\nYou see, Ralph was a homosexual.\n\nOne never knows when the homosexual is about.\n\nHe may appear normal, and it may be too late when you discover he is mentally ill. ♪ ♪ O'BRIEN: I was a poor, young gay person.\n\nAll I knew about was that I heard that there were people down in Times Square who were gay, and that's where I went to.\n\nAnd I found them in the movie theaters, sitting there, next to them.\n\nBOYCE: I had cousins ten years older than me, and they had a car sometimes.\n\nAnd I would get in the back of the car, and then they would say, \"We're going to go see faggots.\"\n\nThat was one of the things you did in New York, it was, like, the Barnum and Bailey aspect of it.\n\nIt was fun to see fags.\n\n(dog barking in distance) Two out of three Americans look upon homosexuals with disgust, discomfort, or fear.\n\nA CBS News public opinion survey indicates that sentiment is against permitting homosexual relationships between consenting adults without legal punishment.\n\nThe severity of the punishment varies from state to state.\n\nThe homosexual, bitterly aware of his rejection, responds by going underground.\n\nThey frequent their own clubs and bars and coffee houses, where they can escape the disapproving eye of the society that they call straight.\n\n♪ ♪ FILM NARRATOR: This is one of the county's principal weekend gathering places for homosexuals, both male and female.\n\nThe scenes were photographed with telescopic lenses.\n\n♪ ♪ It is usually after the day at the beach that the real crime occurs.\n\nAnd it's interesting to note how many youngsters we've been seeing in these films.\n\nJOHN SORENSON: There may be some in this auditorium.\n\nThere may be some here today that will be homosexual in the future.\n\nThere are a lot of kids here.\n\nThere may be some girls here that will turn lesbian.\n\nWe don't know.\n\nBut it's serious.\n\nDon't kid yourselves about it.\n\nThey can be anywhere.\n\nThey could be judges, lawyers.\n\nWe ought to know, we've arrested all of them.\n\nSo if any one of you have let yourself become involved with an adult homosexual, or with another boy, and you're doing this on a regular basis, you better stop quick.\n\nBecause one out of three of you will turn queer.\n\nAnd if we catch you involved with a homosexual, your parents are going to know about it first.\n\nAnd you will be caught-- don't think you won't be caught, because this is one thing you cannot get away with.\n\nThis is one thing that if you don't get caught by us, you'll be caught by yourself.\n\nAnd the rest of your life will be a living hell.\n\nVIRGINIA APUZZO: I grew up with that.\n\nI grew up in a very Catholic household.\n\nAnd the conflict of issues of redemption, of, is it possible that if you are this thing called a homosexual, is it possible to be redeemed?\n\nIs that conceivable?\n\nAnd that, that was a very haunting issue for me.\n\n(choir singing on film) APUZZO: I entered the convent at 26 to pursue that question, and I was convinced that I would either stay until I got an answer, or, if I didn't get an answer, just stay.\n\n♪ ♪ ESKRIDGE: The Stonewall riots came at a central point in history.\n\nED KOCH: Gay rights, like the rights of blacks, were constantly under attack.\n\nAnd while blacks were protected by constitutional amendments coming out of the Civil War, gays were not protected by law, and certainly not the Constitution.\n\nThis is a nation of laws.\n\nThese homosexuals glorify unnatural sex acts.\n\nEvery arrest and prosecution is a step in the education of the public to the solution of the problem.\n\n♪ ♪ O'BRIEN: If a gay man is caught by the police and is identified as being involved in what they called lewd, immoral behavior, they would have their person's name, their age, and many times their home address listed in the major newspapers.\n\nYou were alone.\n\n(door slams) MAN: We

SMITH: It was an age of experimentation.\n\nIn the sexual area, in psychology, psychiatry.\n\nAlmost anything you could name.\n\nThings were just changing.\n\nAll the rules were off in the '60s.\n\nIt was tremendous freedom.\n\nAPUZZO: It was free, but not quite free enough for us.\n\nYou had no place to try to find an identity.\n\nAnd when you got a word, the word was homosexuality, and you looked it up.\n\nIt said the most dreadful things.\n\nIt said nothing about being a person.\n\nIt was as if they were identifying a thing.\n\n♪ ♪ FRED SARGEANT: In the '60s, I met Craig Rodwell, who was

from people who objected to the wrongful behavior of some gays who would have sex on the street.\n\nAnd the Village has a lot of people with children, and they were offended.\n\nESKRIDGE: In states

Like a Hydra.\n\nYou cut one head off, for the first time, the next person stood up.\n\n(yelling, clamoring) O'BRIEN: All of a sudden, the police faced something they had never seen before.\n\nMAN: Stay back!\n\nO'BRIEN: Gay people were never supposed to be threats to police officers.\n\nThey were supposed to be weak men, limp-wristed.\n\nNot able to, to, you know, do anything.\n\nAnd here they were lifting things up and fighting them and, and attacking them, and beating them.\n\n(yelling and clamoring) BOYCE: And I remember moving into the open space and grabbing onto two of my friends and we started singing and doing a kick line.\n\nAnd we were singing, ♪ We are the Village girls, we wear our hair in curls ♪ ♪ We wear our dungarees above our nellie knees ♪ This was in front of the police.\n\nI mean, the riot squad was used to riots.\n\nThey were not used to a bunch of drag queens doing a Rockettes kick line and sort of, like, giving them all the finger in a way.\n\n(yelling and clamoring) And the cops just charged them.\n\nAnd then started smashing their heads with, with the clubs.\n\nBOYCE: And then more police came, and it didn't stop.\n\nWindows had started to break.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, pandemonium broke loose.\n\n(yelling, screaming) TRUSCOTT: What they did in the Stonewall that night, I went in there, and they took bats and just busted that place up.\n\nThe mirrors, all the bottles of liquor, the jukebox, the cigarette machines.\n\nCASTRO: There was mesh garbage cans being lit up on fire and being thrown at the police.\n\nTires were slashed on police cars, and it just went on all night long.\n\nO'BRIEN: Cops got hurt.\n\nIt must have been terrifying for them.\n\nI hope it was.\n\nIt gives back a little of the terror they gave in my life.\n\nLANIGAN-SCHMIDT: Those of us that were the street kids, we didn't think much about the past or the future.\n\nWe were thinking about survival.\n\nSo anything that would set us off, we would go into action.\n\nAnd it's that hairpin trigger thing that makes the riot happen.\n\nThe police weren't letting us dance.\n\nIf there's one place in the world where you can dance and, and... feel yourself fully as a person, and that's threatened with being taken away, those words are fighting words.\n\nBOYCE: The day after the first riot, when it was all over, and I remember sitting, the sun was soon to come, and I was sitting on the stoop, and I was exhausted.\n\nAnd I looked at that street.\n\nIt was dark enough to allow the street lamps to pick up the glitter of all the broken glass, and all the debris, and all the different-colored cloth that was in different places.\n\nIt was as if an artist had arranged it-- it was beautiful, it was like mica, it was like the streets we fought on were strewn with diamonds.\n\nIt was like a reward.\n\nI really thought that, you know, we did it.\n\nBut we're going to pay dearly for this.\n\n♪ ♪ SARGEANT: When it was clear that things were definitely over for the evening, we decided we needed to do something more.\n\nWe knew that this was a moment that we didn't want to let slip past, because it was something that we could use to bring more of the groups together.\n\nLeaflets in the '60s were like the internet today.\n\nThat night, we printed a box-- we had 5,000.\n\nIt was a leaflet that attacked the relationship of the police and the mafia and the bars that we needed to see ended.\n\nHOOSE: I was afraid it was over.\n\nAnd there was, like, this tension in the air, and it just, like, built and built.\n\nTRUSCOTT: Saturday night, there it was.\n\nThe Stonewall had reopened.\n\nThe mob was saying, you know, \"Screw you, cops.\n\n\"You think you can come in and bust us up?\n\n\"We'll put new liquor in there, we'll put a new mirror up, we'll get a new jukebox.\"\n\nAnd gay people were standing around outside and the mood on the street was, \"They think that they could disperse us last night \"and keep us from doing what we want to do, \"being on the street saying, 'I'm gay and I'm proud'?\n\nJust let's see if they can.\"\n\nBOYCE: People in the neighborhood, the most unlikely people, were starting to support it.\n\nMy father said, \"About time you fags rioted.\"\n\nHOOSE: Gay people who had good jobs, who had everything in life to lose, were starting to join in.\n\nEven non-gay people.\n\nLEITSCH: There were Black Panthers and there were anti-war people.\n\nBOYCE: There were these two black, like, banjee guys, and they were saying, \"Well, what's goin' on, man?\"\n\nAnd then someone would say... (stammering): \"It's still... \"They're still fighting the police, let's go,\" and they went in.\n\n♪ ♪ SARGEANT: The tactical patrol force on the second night came in even larger numbers, and were much more brutal.\n\nThere were occasions where you did see people get night-sticked.\n\nOr disappear into a group of police and, you know, everybody knew that was not going to have a good end.\n\nO'BRIEN: You know, they went for the head wounds.\n\nIt wasn't just the back wounds and leg ones.\n\nLEITSCH: And that's when you started seeing, like, bodies laying on the sidewalk, people bleeding from the head.\n\n♪ ♪ TRUSCOTT: They started busting cans of tear gas.\n\nAnd there was tear gas on Saturday night, right in front of the Stonewall.\n\nGARVIN: There was more anger and more fight the second night.\n\nThere was no going back now.\n\nThere was no going back.\n\nThere was no-- we had discovered a power that we weren't even aware that we had.\n\n(crowd chanting) TRUSCOTT: And then the next night.\n\nI mean, it didn't stop after that.\n\nOnce it started, once that genie was out of the bottle, it was never going to go back in.\n\n(crowd chanting) SMITH: It really should have been called Stonewall uprising.\n\nThey really were objecting to how they were being treated.\n\nThat's more an uprising than a riot.\n\n♪ ♪ LANIGAN-SCHMIDT: As much as I don't like to say it, there's a place for violence.\n\nBecause if you don't have extremes, you don't get any moderation.\n\nAnd as awful as people might think that sounds, it's the way history has always worked.\n\nI don't know if you remember the Joan Baez song: \"It isn't nice to block the doorway, \"it isn't nice to go to jail, there're nicer ways to do it, but the nice ways always fail.\"\n\nFor the first time, we weren't letting ourselves be carted off to jails.\n\nGay people were actually fighting back just the way people in the peace movement fought back.\n\nIt was thrilling.\n\nIt was the only time I was in a gladiatorial sport that... You know, I stood up in.\n\nI was proud-- I was a man.\n\nTRUSCOTT: \"The New York Times,\" I guess, printed a story, but it wasn't a major story, I mean... You got a major incident going on down there, and I didn't see any TV cameras at all.\n\nIf there had been a riot of that proportion in Harlem, my God, you know, there'd have been cameras everywhere.\n\nWell, I famously used the word \"fag\" in the lead sentence.\n\nI said, \"The forces of faggotry.\"\n\nAnd the first gay power demonstration, to my knowledge, was against my story in \"The Village Voice\" on Wednesday.\n\nThey put some people on the street, right in front of \"The Village Voice,\" protesting the use of the word \"fag\" in my story.\n\nAnd, you know, and \"The Village Voice\" at that point started using the word \"gay.\"\n\nSARGEANT: The press did refer to it in very pejorative terms as a night that the drag queens fought back.\n\nAnd it was nonsense, it was nonsense.\n\nIt was all the people there that were reacting and opposing what was occurring.\n\nGARVIN: We became a people.\n\nWe didn't necessarily know where we were going yet.\n\nYou know, what organizations were going to be or how things would go.\n\nBut we became something I, as a person, could all of a sudden grab onto, that I couldn't grab onto when I would go to a subway tearoom as a kid, or a 42nd Street movie theater, you know?\n\nOr being picked up by some dirty old man.\n\nYou know, all of a sudden, I had brothers and sisters, you know, which I didn't have before.\n\n♪ ♪ SHELLEY: The riot could have been buried.\n\nIt could have been a few days in the local newspaper and that was that.\n\nBut we had to follow up.\n\nWe couldn't just let that be a blip that disappeared.\n\nAnd I hadn't had enough sleep, so I was in a somewhat feverish state, and I thought, \"We have to do something, we have to do something,\" and I thought, \"We have to have a protest march of our own.\"\n\nAnd they were having a meeting at town hall, and there were 400 guys who showed up, and I think a couple of women, talking about these riots, 'cause everybody was really energized and upset and angry about it.\n\nAnd I raised my hand at one point and said, \"Let's have a protest march.\"\n\nAnd Dick Leitsch, who was the head of the Mattachine Society, said, \"Who's in favor?\"\n\nAnd I didn't see anything but a forest of hands.\n\n(traffic humming) SARGEANT: The effect of the Stonewall riot was to change the direction of the gay movement.\n\nWe were going to propose something that all groups could participate in, and what we ended up producing was what's now known as the gay pride march.\n\n(whistle blows, car horn honking) WILSON: In those days, the idea of walking in daylight, with a sign saying, \"I'm a faggot,\" was, nobody, nobody was ready to do that.\n\nSo I got into the subway, and on the car was somebody I recognized, and he said, \"I've never been so scared in my life.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, please let there be more than ten of us.\n\nJust please let there be more than ten of us.\"\n\nBecause it's all right in the Village, but the minute we cross 14th Street, if there's only ten of us, God knows what's going to happen to us.\n\nO'BRIEN: We had no idea we were gonna finish the march.\n\nWe had no speakers planned for the rally in Central Park, where we had hoped to get to.\n\nWe didn't expect we'd ever get to Central Park.\n\nWe assembled on Christopher Street at Sixth Avenue to march.\n\nWILSON: And we were about 100, 120 people, and there were people lining the sidewalks ahead of us to watch us go by-- gay people, mainly.\n\n(people chanting) HOOSE: And we were going fast.\n\nPeople that were involved in it like me refer to it as the first run.\n\nWe had been threatened-- bomb threats.\n\nWe had been, you know-- people could take shots at us.\n\nWe were scared.\n\nBut as we were going up Sixth Avenue, it kept growing.\n\n(music playing, people cheering) (people cheering, whistles blowing) WILSON: And I looked back, and there were about 2,000 people behind us.\n\n(voice breaking): And that's when I knew it had happened.\n\nI say-- I cannot tell this without tearing up.\n\nAnd Vito and I walked the rest of the whole thing with tears running down our face.\n\n(sniffles): But, that's when it, that's when we knew we were ourselves for the first time.\n\n(drums beating) (chanting): The people united will never be defeated.\n\nThe people united will never be defeated.\n\nThe people united will never be defeated.\n\nWILSON: America thought we were these homosexual monsters, and we were so innocent, and oddly enough, we were so American.\n\n♪ ♪ APUZZO: It's very American to say, \"This is not right.\"\n\nIt's very American to say, \"You promised equality, you promised freedom.\"\n\nAnd in a sense, the Stonewall riots said, \"Get off our backs, deliver on the promise.\"\n\nSo in every gay pride parade every year, Stonewall lives.\n\nBOYCE: It was another great step forward in the story of human rights, that's what it was.\n\nAnd it was those loudest people, the most vulnerable, the most likely to be arrested, were the ones that were doing the real fighting.\n\nThey were the storm troopers.\n\nPINE: And they were, they were kids.\n\nYou knew you could ruin them for life.\n\nAnd you felt bad that you were part of this, when you knew they broke the law, but what kind of law was that?\n\n♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪"
