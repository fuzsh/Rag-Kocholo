        "text": "[Read more from outside the Stonewall Inn on Friday night.]\n\nThe crowd of thousands that gathered outside the Stonewall Inn on Friday, packing the streets around the most famous gay bar in the world, assembled to pay tribute to the pioneers who 50 years ago led a protest that galvanized the modern gay rights movement.\n\nThe emotional rally, held on a warm summer night in Greenwich Village, commemorated the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. Around a stage at the corner of Christopher Street and Waverly Place, candy-colored wigs and bright apparel mixed with a sea of rainbow flags like the ones that have been festooned around New York City in June for the monthlong Pride celebrations.\n\nBut amid the festive atmosphere, advocates and politicians, in their remarks, took a tone of staunch resistance, making it clear that they believed the fight for equality was far from over and emphasizing that a host of national and global policies still discriminated against the L.G.B.T. community.\n\n“We as an L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.-plus community need to fight now, more than ever, as the rights of our community are rolled back,” said Marti Gould Cummings, a New York City drag performer and activist.\n\n“As transgender people aren’t allowed to serve in the military; as 28 states tell us we can be fired for being who we are; as six trans women of color have been murdered this month alone — it’s an epidemic, and we must fight for our community now,” Mr. Cummings said, to cheers.\n\nIt was a message repeated by other speakers and enthusiastically received by the crowd.\n\n“Fifty years ago, those brave activists stood on this street and fought back,” said Corey Johnson, the openly gay and H.I.V. positive City Council speaker. “Let’s keep fighting.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
