        "text": "It wouldn’t be LGBT+ Pride Month without mentioning Stonewall. On the evening of June 28, 1969 NYC police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. Before we go further in this story, it is important to understand the historical context. The 1960s where not a very friendly time for the LGBT+ community. There where laws against activities like kissing, dancing, and holding hands. A lot of people felt that the only safe place they had to be themselves was inside gay bars.\n\nHowever, being out of sight did not mean being out of mind. The New York State Liquor Authority often went as far as to shut down businesses that served alcohol to known or suspected LGBT+ patrons until as recently as 1966 – as it was considered disorderly. Even when those rules where overturned, it still wasn’t uncommon for police to raid bars for suspected homosexual activity.\n\nThe Stonewall Inn was purchased 1966 by the Genovese crime family. It wasn’t uncommon for mobs or other organized crime groups to own and operate gay bars. For them, money was money, and if there where any wealthier patrons, they could be blackmailed for additional funds. Even with police corruption, and enough greased palms, raids still happened – but the owners usually got tipped off in advance so they could hide any unlicensed alcohol they where hiding on premise. One of those tip offs happened for a raid three days before June 28th, and I imagine that the staff and patrons of the Stone Wall Inn where not anticipating another ‘visit’ from the NYPD. This unwarned raid may have been the straw that broke the camels back. You go through all of these hoops to have a safe place to be yourself, and you can’t even go a week without another raid. It didn’t take long for crowds to form, throwing gravel, coins and other objects at the police. A fire was started at the Stonewall Inn, and quickly put out before morning – but, was quickly put out. While this event didn’t start the Gay Rights Movement in The United States, it was a beacon for more people to gather together and fight for a more just future.\n\nOn June 28, 1970 thousands of people gathered and marched from The Stonewall Inn to Central Park. The resounding chant was “say it loud – gay is proud“.\n\nLearn More\n\nBefore Stonewall: Activist for Gay And Lesbian Rights In A Historical Context\n\nThe Stonewall Riots: Coming Out In The Street by Gayle Pitman\n\nAnd Then I Danced: Travelling the Road to LGBT Equality by Mark Segal\n\nChapter on Marsha P.
