        "text": "The Stonewall Riots were a critical turning point in the gay rights movement.\n\nThe LGBTQ+ community amplified the fight for equality during and after the Stonewall Riots.\n\nMarsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera are among the most notable leaders.\n\nThe impact of the Stonewall Riots continues today, inspiring activists worldwide.\n\nA raid by the New York City police department led to one of the most influential uprisings in LGBTQ+ history. The Stonewall Riots, also known as the Stonewall Uprising, became a pivotal point in the gay rights movement during the 1960s.\n\nThe impact of the Stonewall Riots remains strong today. Inspired by LGBTQ+ leaders of the 1969 uprising, present-day student activists find strength in this major historical moment.\n\nHistory of the Stonewall Riots\n\nThe Stonewall Riots occurred in 1969, beginning at the Stonewall Inn. Located in New York City, the Stonewall Inn was one of the few bars catering to the city's LGBTQ+ population. People risked police confrontation in order to spend time in establishments that allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to peacefully share space together.\n\nFor people visiting gay-friendly establishments, the risk was high. Individuals risked losing their jobs, encountering police brutality, and experiencing community hardships.\n\nOn June 28, 1969, the New York City police issued a warrant and raided the Stonewall Inn. The police raid resulted in physical altercations between officers and patrons, bodily checks of adherence to New York's gendered clothing law, and the arrests of 13 individuals.\n\nMany within the LGBTQ+ community were fed up with the ongoing discrimination and harassment. Yelling and throwing small objects led to rioting by a growing crowd outside the Stonewall Inn.\n\nThe riots lasted five days, bringing thousands of people to the New York City streets near the Stonewall Inn. A critical point in the gay rights movement, the Stonewall Riots inspired the founding of new gay rights organizations and increased political activism.\n\nImportant Leaders of the Stonewall Riots\n\nThousands of people took part in the Stonewall Riots. Stonewallers, those who participated in the riots, banded together around the expressed need for better treatment of the LGBTQ+ community. Solidarity and allyship brought many people to the streets of New York City, including the leaders who led many of the crowds.\n\nSome of the most notable leaders of the Stonewall Riots include Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Both leaders participated in the uprising and were steadfast organizers and activists throughout the gay rights movement.\n\nMarsha \"Pay it no mind\" Johnson was integral to the Stonewall Riots. She marched, rallied, and advocated for the equal rights of the LGBTQ+ community throughout her life. Johnson was considered an icon as a longtime activist and leader in her community.\n\nSylvia Rivera participated in the Stonewall Riots, led protests, and advocated for the equal treatment of all historically excluded people. From a young age, Rivera spoke out against discrimination against people of color and the gay community. She supported the Black Liberation Movement and pushed for transgender people to be included in the gay rights movement.\n\nTogether, Johnson and Rivera founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), building a home and community for gay and transgender people living on the streets. Their legacies live on and continue to inspire the LGBTQ+ community today.\n\n6 Ways Colleges Can Honor Stonewall and Celebrate LGBTQ+ Students\n\nHonor the legacy and continuing impact of the Stonewall Riots on campus. Acknowledging Stonewall's leaders, the gay rights movement overall, and the changes that arose from the uprising contribute to understanding the influence of Stonewall on students today.\n\nConsider these six opportunities for colleges and universities to honor the Stonewall Riots and the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nShare stories of connection and inspiration.

Wear college gear and wave collegiate banners to show ongoing support and solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nHost a movie-viewing party — like Jackson College's online viewing of \"Stonewall Uprising\" — where students and faculty can gather together. Movies about the Stonewall Riots provide historical background and discuss the long-term impacts of the gay rights movement.\n\nEngage faculty in the history of Stonewall.
