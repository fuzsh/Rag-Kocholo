        "text": "2019 is an iconic and historic year for SAGE and the LGBTQ+ community as it marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, known as the birth of the modern LGBTQ+ movement.\n\nLGBTQ+ elders fought for years for LGBTQ+ acceptance before 1969, but Stonewall incited a cultural shift. Although progress has been made for LGBTQ+ equality, LGBTQ+ elders—the very ones who started the movement and led it through the AIDS crisis and the battle for marriage equality—are still fighting for their right to live their lives openly and with dignity and respect as they age.\n\nAs we honor Stonewall’s 50th anniversary, we lift up and celebrate the fact that the milestones achieved in the LGBTQ+ movement were only possible because of the trailblazers who first stood up for their rights. That’s why SAGE is committed to fighting on behalf of LGBTQ+ elders by advocating for their right to age with dignity and respect. Our pioneers are Still Out in Front and paving the way forward."
