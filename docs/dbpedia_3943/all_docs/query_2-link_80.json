In order to better inform you, my peers of what happened, where they took place, and why they are so important to American history. The 1960’s were not a welcoming time for those who fell into the LGBT community, ally or not. So those in the community who were affected came together and turned Inns into a place of refuge. Therefore, the Stonewall Riots were an important event in American History because it brought to the attention of the people; social injustices, police corruption, and sparked a social movement for peace and rights for all.\n\nThe riots started at around 3 am on June 28th, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in Brooklyn, New York City when police raided the inn, on the pretense of the bar’s lack of a liquor license. They began checking identification and taking people into the bar’s bathroom to determine their sex. The patrons of the bar were held outside as police threw the bar’s unstamped alcohol into patrol wagons. A crowd of Greenwich Village residents and the area’s homeless youth gathered to watch as the bar’s patrons were arrested.\n\nBefore the Stonewall Uprising, homosexuals were hidden and repressed living as their own interest group. Homosexuals met in secrecy, for example, in meat trucks and only in certain neighborhoods. This would be referred to as Karl Marx’s term minority in itself because it was an unidentified community. Legal issues affected how homosexuals lived their lives, for example, the federal government and school boards would fire anyone who became homosexual and their license would be denied. Homosexuals they were caught during a homosexual act, they would be punished. This erupted into the Stonewall riot, police came to shut down Stonewall, but instead, the homosexuals fought for their rights to be a member of the mainstream society. By the end of the uprising, everyone was fighting to support the change. In regards to lawmaking, the gay rights movement is considered a conflict perspective because of the inequality and the fight for the norms of the society. Homosexuals could also be considered part of an interest group because the interest group thesis states that laws are produced because of distinctive interests of certain groups in the population. After the Stonewall uprising, the conclusion was established and the gay pride parade was created for everyone to participate in. In reference to Karl Marx’s concept, this would now be entitled minority for itself. Considering social change in relation to the\n\nThe Stonewall Inn was a gay bar in New York City and it was the starting place of the Gay Liberation Movement. In the 1970s gay men and lesbians started wanting equality because they faced lots of legal discrimination. They didn’t have equal rights because they couldn’t even have consensual sex with their partners and it was illegal in almost all states. So in 1969 police raided the Stonewall Inn and gay men fought the police and proclaimed “Gay Power.” This event caused riots between the New York City police and all the gay residents.\n\nThe next major event was the birth of the movement, The Stonewall Riots, which was the mother of all LGBT-themed associates and groups. There have been a large number of eyewitness accounts, articles and stories of how the riot began and ended, as well as what it immediately brought about. People began to start doing “radical” acts, one man decided to begin writing his college papers in terms of having a prominent gay\n\nThe Stonewall Riots in 1969 leading to the first Gay Pride Parade in 1970 started a public discourse on LGBT rights (The Stonewall Riots). In the years to follow, two opposing mass movements manifested: the LGBT movement and the Religious Right movement. The LGBT movement aimed to get equal rights for homosexuals. The Religious Right focused on stopping the perceived moral decay of America and protecting children from lesbians and gays. While these movements had polar opposite goals, they used surprisingly similar methods to get their messages across.\n\n\"Liberation for gay people is to define ourselves how and with whom we live, instead of measuring our relationships by straight values To be free territory, we must govern ourselves, set up our own institutions, defend ourselves, and use our own energies to improve our lives\" (Wittman, 75). Carl Wittman's Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto, drew together many of the themes dealing with gay liberation. This quote demonstrates the goals of the gay and lesbian movement, a movement which many believe started with the Stonewall riots. The Stonewall riots proved to homosexuals that a sufficient amount of time had passed that they were persecuted and maltreated and it was time to speak up for their rights, resulting in the\n\nDo you believe it is okay to judge someOne on what they like. The things that are in this document will try to persuade you to accept gay marriage. Too many people look down upon others who don’t prefer the same-sex partners as they do. In this paper, i will show you reasons why you should learn to accept gay marriage.\n\nIn the book Gay Rights it states, “In 1969, the year the stonewall rebellion occurred, there were only 50 gays and lesbian organizations with a few thousands of members in the entire country.” It means that they were finally taking a stand and ready to fight back. What happened in the Stonewall is in June 28 1969 there was a gay club called the Stonewall. Police started to attack the gay and lesbians. Then after that the crowd of people started to throw bottles at the police. If I was there I would have done so much worse than that. There is one of the main events in the 1960’s Gay\n\nGay rights movements in the US can be traced back to the Stonewall Riots that occurred following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in New York City at 3a.m on June 28th, 1969 (“Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?”). In the 1950’s and 1960’s, gay Americans were faced to a harsh anti gay legal system, thus taking away their rights for marriage. This resulted in the Stonewall Riots. Nowadays, 92 percent of the LGBT youth say they hear negative messages about the LGBT, their top sources being school, the internet, and their peers (Growing Up LGBT In America). American youth tends to have many hardships thrown at them by those who aren't like them creating a barrier between each other. F The hate against the LGBT is a major problem in america, stopping us from being a united\n\nUnfortunately, although the Stonewall Riots and subsequent demonstrations helped to start a movement for the LGBTQ community, those who also additionally identified as belonging to an ethnic minority group found that their voices were lost in the crowd. The community in which the riots began housed a large population of New York’s African-Americans, especially those who also identified as LGBTQ, as the neighborhoods had become an established safe space for people of all kinds to express themselves (Farrow). The riots were no different from other protests in history that had broken out between white authority\n\nGay Americans had enough and were no longer going to live in fear or repression that society put on them. The riots took place at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village and are considered to be the single most important event that led to the liberation of homosexuals. Because of the police raid and the proceeding violent acts, it ignited a fire within the LGBT community that they were no longer going to stand for what they had gone through. They began building alliances with other civil rights groups and protesting in the streets. The Stonewall riots finally gave them a platform to make their voices heard and so began the start of working toward LGBT\n\nIt has been said that gay rights and gay right movements are traced back to the Stonewall Riots. The riot occurred at Stonewall Inn in New York City on June 28, 1969 after a police raid at a gay bar-and note that at this time it was illegal to even have a homo-sexual relationship at all except in Illinois-. As a result of this riot the number of gay organizations in the country sky rocketed. The numbers went from a small fifty something to thousands all in a span of four to five years. Shortly after that in nineteen seventy-three the gay liberation movement"
