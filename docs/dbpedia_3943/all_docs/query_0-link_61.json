        "text": "The Stonewall Uprising was a six-day conflict between police and LGBTQ+ protesters that took place beginning June 28, 1969 at the the Stonewall Inn (now a national monument) in New York City.\n\nToday, Stonewall is considered a landmark event, one that gave birth to what is now Pride Month. In fact, the first Pride march was held in New York City only one year later, on June 28, 1970, to honor the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising.\n\nIn this episode of Music 101, Margot explores the story of Stonewall through music.\n\nNow considered one of the transformative events in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality, Stonewall inspired a generation, including influential musicians who longed to contribute music known as “Songs of the Stonewall.“\n\nThe musicians featured in this episode of Music 101 come from just after the Uprising, and those inspired by the lasting impact of those fateful days in New York.\n\nFor more information on contributing support to the Stonewall Uprising, visit the Stonewall Veterans’ Association.\n\nSongs featured in this week’s episode\n\nNilsson | “Everybody’s Talking”\n\nDavid Bowie | “John, I’m Only Dancing”\n\nLou Reed | “Walk On The Wild Side”\n\nDonna Summer | “I Feel Love”\n\nTim Curry | “Sweet Transvestite”\n\nJobriath | “Rock Of Ages”\n\nTom Robinson Band | “2-4-6-8 Motorway”\n\nPete Shelley | “Homosapien”\n\nBronski Beat | “Smalltown Boy”"
