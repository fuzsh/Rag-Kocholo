Newspapers report that 26 year old Dorothy U. Killman was fined on two charges of assaulting policemen who, \"...tried to load her into a paddy wagon.\"[8][9] May 1959 Los Angeles To protest police harassment Transgender women, drag queens, lesbians, and gay men clashed with police at Cooper Do-nuts, a hang-out for them and street hustlers who were frequently harassed by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Police arrested three people, including John Rechy, but other patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for back-up and arrested a number of rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees were able to escape.[10] August 5, 1961 Milwaukee To fight back against Navy gay-bashers when police could not be trusted to help When four Navy servicemen jumped the bouncer at Milwaukee's Black Nite gay bar, drag performer Josie Carter used beer bottles to fight off the men attacking her husband, sending two to the hospital. The remaining Navy servicemen left to round up additional servicemen and returned to the bar for revenge. They were met with a counterattack of more than 70 LGBTQ patrons who fought back in what became known as the Black Nite Brawl. The interior of the bar was largely destroyed and three people were hospitalized. Milwaukee police, who had beaten a gay man to death during a park raid only a year earlier, arrested the attackers and did not arrest bar patrons.[11][12][13] September 19, 1964 New York City To protest the US military's treatment of gay people Organized by activist Randy Wicker, a small group picketed the Whitehall Street Induction Center after the confidentiality of gay men's draft records was violated. This action has been identified as the first gay rights demonstration in the United States.[14] December 2, 1964 New York City To protest the disease model of homosexuality Four gay men and lesbians picketed a lecture by a psychoanalyst espousing the model of homosexuality as a mental illness. The demonstrators were given ten minutes to make a rebuttal.[14] January 1, 1965 San Francisco To protest police action The Council on Religion and the Homosexual held a costume party at California Hall on Polk Street in San Francisco to raise money for the new organization. When the ministers informed the San Francisco Police Department of the event, the SFPD attempted to force the rented hall's owners to cancel it. At the event itself, some of the ministers and ticket takers were arrested, creating a brief riot.[15] April 17,[4] and April 18, 1965[16] Washington, D.C., New York City To protest Cuba and the United States' policies on homosexuality Homophile activists picketed the White House on April 17 and the United Nations[17] on the 18th after learning that Cuba was placing homosexuals in forced labor camps.[18] April 25, 1965 Philadelphia To protest a restaurant's gay-exclusionary service policy An estimated 150 people participated in a sit-in when the manager of Dewey's restaurant refused service to \"a large number of homosexuals and people wearing non-conformist clothing.\" Four people were arrested, including homophile rights leader Clark Polak of Philadelphia's Janus Society. All four were convicted of disorderly conduct. Members of the society also leafleted outside the restaurant the following week and negotiated with the owners to bring an end to the denial of service. Three people staged another sit-in on May 5, occupying a table for a few hours. The police were also called for this sit-in, but left after taking no action, Polak was quoted saying, \"we could stay in there as long as we wanted as the police had no authority to ask us to leave.\"[19] May 29, 1965 Washington, D.C.

They invited reporters to follow the \"sip-in\" as they sought refusal of service.[25] After being served in three bars despite announcing their homosexuality, the group was finally refused service at Julius', a gay bar that had been raided ten days prior. Although Leitsch's complaint to the State Liquor Authority resulted in no action, the city's human rights commission declared that such discrimination could not continue.[26][27] May 21, 1966 Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. To protest the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States armed forces A coalition of homophile organizations across the country organized simultaneous demonstrations for Armed Forces Day.[28] The Los Angeles group held a 15-car motorcade (which has been identified as the nation's first gay pride parade)[29] and activists held pickets in the other cities.[30][31] The protest grew out of the first meeting of the organization that would become the North American Conference of Homophile Organizations.[29] July 18, 1966 San Francisco To protest a restaurant's harassment and denial of service Around 25 people picketed Compton's Cafeteria when new management began using Pinkerton agents and police to harass gay and transgender customers.[32] August 1966 San Francisco To protest continued harassment Gay and transgender customers rioted at Compton's in response to continued police harassment.

The Tribune gave the event no coverage.[33] January 1, 1967 Los Angeles To protest police raids on gay bars The LAPD raided the New Year's Eve parties at two gay bars, the Black Cat Tavern and New Faces.
