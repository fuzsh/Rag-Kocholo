The Stonewall uprising was a protracted struggle in which the LGBTQ community in New York City fought back against what had become regular, city-sanctioned harassment by the police. The spontaneous six-night conflict gained national attention and inspired a new movement for full equality and acceptance. Stonewall National Monument is the first national park site dedicated to LGBTQ history.

NPCA played a lead role in organizing community support and lobbying for the national monumentâ€™s creation in 2016. NPCA continues to support the site and worked for years with its partners to open a visitor center in 2024 to house exhibits, provide amenities for park rangers, and help more visitors and locals connect with the historical significance of the site.
