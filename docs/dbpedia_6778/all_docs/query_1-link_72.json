        "text": "WASHINGTON | Ralph Nader announced Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he is running for president again as a third-party candidate, dismissing residual anger from many Democrats that his 2000 showing cost Vice President Al Gore the election.\n\n\"You have to ask yourself as a citizen, should we elaborate the issues that the two (parties) are not talking about?\" Nader said. He said voters are feeling \"locked out, shut out, marginalized, disrespected\" on issues ranging from the Middle East, Enron and Katrina, to bungling by both parties.\n\n\"In that context, I have decided to run for president,\" said Nader, who turns 74 this week.\n\nThe long-time consumer advocate ran for president as an independent in 2004 and as the Green Party standard-bearer in 2000 and 1996.\n\nIn 2000, Nader won2.7 percent of the vote, including more than 97,000 votes in Florida, ground zero of the presidential election. Nader vehemently defended his right to run and denied that he was a spoiler. \"Let's get over it and try to have a diverse multiple choice, multiple-party democracy the way they have in Western Europe and Canada,\" he said.\n\nAsked about concerns that he might hurt Democratic prospects this year, he said, \"If the Democrats can't landslide the Republicans this year, they ought to just wrap up, close down, emerge in a different form.\"\n\nNader now faces formidable challenges to get on the ballot as an independent. In 2004 he was on the ballot in 34 states and the District of Columbia, and won 465,000 votes."
