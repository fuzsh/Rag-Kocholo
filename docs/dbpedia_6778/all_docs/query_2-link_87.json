        "text": "MISSOULA, Montana -- This year's presidential race is not just a contest between the two major parties. Attorney Ralph Nader, Green Party candidate for president, is making a surprising showing in some states and igniting substantial discussion of environmental issues.\n\nThis is not the first time Nader has run on the Green Party ticket. In 1996, he lost to President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, landing on the ballots of just 21 states and spending only $5,000 on his entire national campaign.\n\nThis time, Nader is hoping to spend $5 million, and has already raised at least $350,000. He wants to get on the ballot in at least 45 states, and steal significant numbers of votes from the Gore campaign and that of Texas Governor George W. Bush, who is running on the Republican ticket.\n\nHe could do it. He is already doing better in the polls than Reform Party candidate Patrick Buchanan, who has millions to spend. Celebrities including Warren Beatty, Bonnie Raitt, Paul Newman, and Susan Sarandon have contributed to Nader's campaign.\n\nIn a recent California poll, Nader took 9 percent of the vote. In Oregon, he gathered 7 percent of the vote. These Western states are among the strongest in the traditional Democratic base.\n\nThe race between Gore and Bush is considered close enough that neither candidate can afford to lose votes. In some states, Nader could snag votes in large enough numbers to tip the scale. The likely victim would be Gore, as Nader speaks out strongly on many of the issues that Gore has adopted as his own -- including the environment.\n\nIn a speech Thursday in Missoula, Montana, for example, Nader targeted commercial logging in national forests, calling the practice a \"national disgrace.\"\n\n\"America's taxpayers are being forced to spend $1.2 billion annually in handouts to timber corporations so they can deforest our forests,\" Nader charged.\n\nNader said a century of subsidized logging on public lands has \"resulted in 40 million acres of taxpayer-financed clearcuts and over 400,000 miles of taxpayer financed logging roads -- eight times the length of the interstate highway system.\"\n\nThe results of this policy, Nader said, include devastating mudslides that have destroyed homes and taken lives, destruction of critical habitat for endangered species, degradation of water and air, destruction of fisheries, and the loss of almost all of America's old-growth forests.\n\nNeither Bush nor Gore is likely to change this policy, Nader argues. His campaign centers on one basic idea: that the Democratic and Republican parties are essentially identical, and both are tools of big business.\n\nCorporate dominance has created what Nader described Thursday as a \"crisis of democracy\" in the United States.\n\n\"Over the past two decades, big business has increasingly dominated our political process in state legislatures and the Congress,\" Nader said. \"Many politicians have been hijacked, becoming brokers for their corporate masters.\"\n\nCivil society's right to participate in politics and shape critical policy issues has been \"increasingly blocked because of the domination of the corporate government over our political government, creating a widening democracy gap,\" Nader said.\n\nIn another recent speech in Michigan, Nader pulled no punches in criticizing the link he perceives between government and big business.\n\n\"On the big issue of whether our corporate government is going to take over our political government in Washington, you know what the difference (between the parties) is,\" he said. \"The difference is the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when the corporations come knocking on the door.\"\n\nRalph Nader is not a traditional politician. He is a consumer advocate, lawyer, and author. Over the past 30 years, Nader has lobbied on the public's behalf on issues related to health, safety, economics, environmental pollution, worker rights and excessive corporate influence. Nader's influence has prompted the enactment of laws and regulations to correct the problems he has uncovered.\n\nIn his career as a consumer advocate, Nader founded organizations including the Public Interest Research Group, the Center for Auto Safety, Public Citizen, Center for Women's Policy Studies, Connecticut Citizen's Action Group, the Disability Rights Center, the Pension Rights Center, and the Multinational Monitor, a monthly magazine.\n\nThe next step, Nader has decided, is to take control of the political reins himself.\n\n\"I'm running for president because the only way we are going to regain control of our political institutions is to help build a progressive political movement that will break up the concentration of the wealth and power movement -- a plutocracy that reigns over our democracy,\" Nader said Thursday.\n\nNader promised to lead a \"sustained effort to wrest control of our democracy from corporate government and restore it to the political government under control of citizens. Widespread reform will not flourish without a fairer distribution of power for the key roles of voter, citizen, taxpayer, and consumer,\" he said.\n\nNader has the power to reach a number of voters, particularly young people who might otherwise skip this year's election. On the plus side for Democrats, Nader's presence on the ballot is expected to draw voters who also will support Democratic candidates for Congress, which could help the Democrats regain control of the House and Senate.\n\nSo, while Nader is not likely to win the presidential election, his campaign could still have a far-reaching effect on the face of American politics as usual.\n\nCopyright Environment News Service (ENS) 2000*\n\nFor full text and graphics visit: ENS"
