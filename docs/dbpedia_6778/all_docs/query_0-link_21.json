        "text": "When Ralph Nader ran as a third-party candidate in 2000 and drew 96,837 votes in Florida, he was widely derided by Democrats, who saw him as a spoiler who siphoned crucial votes from Al Gore and tipped the election to George W. Bush. When he ran again in 2004, Democrats in many states tried to keep him off their ballots.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Nader officially announced that he would seek the presidency as a third-party candidate one more time  driven in part by his frustration over the efforts to thwart his last run.\n\n“If there was no other reason to run  other than the civil liberties, civil rights issue of ballot access  it’d be worth it,” Mr. Nader said in a telephone interview after announcing his candidacy on “Meet the Press.”\n\nMr. Nader, a consumer advocate who made his mark by taking on the car industry more than 40 years ago, turns 74 this week, making him the oldest candidate in the race. In two of his three previous presidential bids, he ran on the Green Party ticket, but he said in the interview that he had not yet worked out his party affiliation for this time.\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Nader explained his candidacy by saying Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush were nearly indistinguishable on many important issues. On “Meet the Press,” he conceded that “there are differences” between Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Senator Barack Obama, who has an edge in delegates as the Democratic race heads to the next nominating contests on March 4.\n\nBut Mr. Nader said that issues like single-payer health insurance, labor law reform, the Iraq war and “cracking down on corporate crime” had been “taken off the table” by the major-party candidates.\n\nHe described Mr. Obama as a “person of substance” whose record, nonetheless, had “not been a challenging one.”\n\nMr. Nader also said ballot access had become a central issue for him. He received 0.38 percent of the nationwide vote in 2004, down from 2.7 percent in 2000  a drop caused by being on the ballot in only 34 states, he said.\n\nHe recently filed two complaints, in Superior Court in Washington and in Federal District Court in Virginia, accusing the Democratic National Committee of conspiring in 2004 to deny him ballot access and prevent him from running for president. The party sued and challenged the signatures on his petitions in many states, keeping him off the ballot in Pennsylvania, Ohio and elsewhere.\n\nMr. Nader compared the marginalization of independent candidates to the discrimination against blacks in the South maintained by the Jim Crow laws.\n\n“One is based on race,” he said, “and the other is based on status. They are basically discriminating against us because they think we’re going take votes away from them.” He added, “Look at it from the voter point of view: They’re denying us a free choice of candidates.”\n\nReactions from the Democratic candidates on Sunday ranged from disdainful to dismissive.\n\nTold of Mr. Nader’s announcement on her campaign plane, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said: “Wow, that’s really unfortunate. I remember when he did this before. It’s not good for anybody, especially our country.”\n\nMr. Obama, campaigning in Ohio, said: “Ralph Nader deserves enormous credit for the work he did as a consumer advocate. But his function as a perennial candidate is not putting food on the table of workers.”\n\nMr. Obama also criticized Mr. Nader for equating Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush: “Eight years later, people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about.”"
