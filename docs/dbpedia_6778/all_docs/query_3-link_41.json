        "text": "1934-\n\nConsumer Safety Activist\n\nConsumer crusader Ralph Nader was born in Winsted, Connecticut, to a Lebanese immigrant father who owned a bakery and restaurant. After receiving a scholarship to Princeton University, he graduated at the top of his class and continued on to Harvard Law School.\n\nAt Harvard, the intense young man became interested in cases of car injuries, and wrote an article entitled \"American Cars: Designed for Death.\" After graduating from law school, he began to practice law as a specialist in car safety, and worked for Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Abraham Ribicoff.\n\nIn 1965, Nader published his book, Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-in Dangers of the American Automobile. As a result of the book, Nader became a celebrity and launched his career as a activist in the cause of product safety.\n\nUnsafe at Any Speed contained charges against General Motors, and Nader followed up on his accusations by testifying before Ribicoff's Senate committee. General Motors hired people to investigate Nader, dig up potentially damaging information on him and ruin his career.\n\nNader sued GM and received $280,000. In 1966, Congress passed a car safety law, largely due to Nader's efforts. He used the royalties from his book and other funds for research, extending his studies to the meat-packing industry, unsafe trucks, polluting paper mills, dishonest banks and cheating supermarkets."
