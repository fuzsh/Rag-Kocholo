You may be familiar with the real-world changes his work sparked: the Clean Air Act, automobile safety laws, regulation of the tobacco industry and more. Tracing the arc of his time advocating for change, Nader shares how he helped catalyze social progress against overwhelming odds -- and shows how you can participate in advancing the common good for generations to come.",
