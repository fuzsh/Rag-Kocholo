        "text": "Ralph Nader, 74, ran for president in 2000 and 2004. Born in Winsted, Conn., in 1934, he graduated from Princeton University with a major in East Asian studies, and earned his law degree from Harvard. After a stint in the Army, he made his name as a consumer advocate with exposes on the auto industry, notably the 1965 book \"Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile.\" He and his activist-disciples, known as \"Nader's Raiders,\" successfully advocated consumer-banking laws, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Freedom of Information Act and a host of other reforms. A bachelor, he still resides in Winsted, though he spends much of his time in Washington, D.C.\n\nFact-checking journalism is the heart of PolitiFact. Our core principles are independence, transparency, fairness, thorough reporting and clear writing. The reason we publish is to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy."
