        "text": "(born 1934). Credit for launching the late–20th-century consumer movement probably cannot be given to Ralph Nader, but he is responsible for much of the momentum it gained worldwide from the late 1960s. His book Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-in Dangers of the American Automobile, published in 1965, made him famous and led to the passing of auto-safety legislation (see consumerism).\n\nNader was born in Winsted, Conn., on Feb. 27, 1934. He graduated from Princeton University in 1955 and received his law degree from Harvard in 1958. He settled into a law practice in Hartford, Conn., where he devoted most of his time to studying auto accident cases and writing about the issue of auto safety.\n\nConvinced that he could make no headway against automobile manufacturers by working at the local level, Nader became a consultant for the United States Department of Labor. There he worked on a study about federal responsibility for auto safety. Publication of his book in 1965 made him an instant celebrity. The book became a best-seller and led directly to the passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in 1966, which gave the government the power to enact safety standards for all automobiles sold in the United States. By 1969 the General Motors (GM) Corvair, the object of most of Nader’s criticisms, had been withdrawn from production.\n\nGM went to exceptional lengths to discredit Nader, including hiring a private detective to follow him. Nader sued for invasion of privacy. The case was settled after GM admitted wrongdoing before a Senate committee. With the funds he received from the lawsuit and aided by impassioned activists, who became known as Nader’s Raiders, he helped establish a number of advocacy organizations, most notably his Washington, D.C.-based Public Citizen. Nader’s Raiders became involved in such issues as nuclear safety, international trade, regulation of insecticides, meat processing, pension reform, land use, and banking. Among his other books are The Menace of Atomic Energy (1979) and Who’s Poisoning America? (1981).\n\nAlthough Nader and his associates did not invent the idea of consumer advocacy, they did radically transform its meaning, focusing on fact-finding research, analysis, and governmental lobbying for new laws on key consumer issues. Nader was also instrumental in the passage in 1988 of California’s Proposition 103, which provided for a rollback of auto insurance rates.\n\nNader, who collected only 700,000 votes when he ran for U.S. president in 1996, was the Green party’s nominee for the 2000 U.S. presidential election. His campaign focused on universal health care, environmental and consumer protections, campaign finance reform, and strengthened labor rights. Realizing that he had little hope of winning the election, Nader concentrated on obtaining 5 percent of the national vote, the minimum necessary to secure federal matching funds for the Green party for future presidential campaigns. To meet this goal, some Nader supporters initiated a vote-swapping program on the Internet. Nader Traders, as they were called, agreed to vote for Democratic candidate Al Gore in states where the race was close between Gore and Republican candidate George W. Bush and in exchange Gore’s supporters would cast ballots for Nader in states where the contest was uncompetitive. Nader was opposed to the plan, and in the end it had little impact on the election as he managed to win only 3 percent of the national vote."
