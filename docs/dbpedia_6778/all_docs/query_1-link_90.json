        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Electoral College consists of 538 electors, who are representatives typically chosen by the candidate’s political party, though some state laws differ. Each state’s number of electors is based on its congressional delegation (one for each member in the House of Representatives and one for each member in the Senate). Currently, a total of 270 electoral votes is required to win the presidency.\n\nBefore the 1804 election the first runner-up became vice president, as spelled out in the US Constitution. As a result of the Election of 1800, the method of electing the vice president was changed with the Twelfth Amendment, and led to separate ballots cast for the president and vice president, with the winner in each race gaining the seat. Popular vote statistics are not available until the 1824 election.\n\nA PDF of the results is also available for download.\n\nElection Results, 1789–2020\n\nNote: Election data is taken from the University of California, Santa Barbara American Presidency Project.\n\nElection Year: 1​789\n\nWinner and Vice President: George Washington, John Adams\n\nElectoral College Votes\n\nWinner: 69\n\nOpponent(s): 34\n\nCandidates: George Washington, John Adams*\n\n*Although theoretically John Adams could have won, everyone knew George Washington was the choice for president; Adams was never expected to win the election.\n\nElection Year: 1792\n\nWinner and Vice President: George Washington, John Adams\n\nElectoral College Votes\n\nWinner: 132\n\nOpponent(s): 77\n\nCandidates by Party\n\nDemocratic-Republican: Aaron Burr, George Clinton, Thomas Jefferson\n\nFederalist Candidates: George Washington, John Adams\n\nElection Year: 1796\n\nWinner and Vice President: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson\n\nElectoral College Votes\n\nWinner: 71\n\nOpponent(s): 68\n\nCandidates by Party\n\nDemocratic-Republican Candidate: Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson\n\nFederalist Candidate: John Adams, Thomas Pinckney\n\nElection Year: 1800\n\nWinner and Vice President: Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr\n\nElectoral College Votes\n\nWinner: 73*\n\nOpponent(s): 73\n\nCandidates by Party\n\nDemocratic-Republican Candidates: Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson\n\nFederalist Candidate: John Adams, Charles C.
