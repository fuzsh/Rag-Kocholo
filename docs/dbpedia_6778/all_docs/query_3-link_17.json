        "text": "April is Arab American Heritage Month, and this year, we are recognizing it by sharing a story each week of an Arab American who has made a meaningful contribution.\n\nFor the last 60 years, Arab American Ralph Nader has dedicated himself to public service. Nader was born in 1934 in Connecticut to Nathra and Rose Nader, both Lebanese immigrants. Nader would go on to attend Princeton University and Harvard law school.\n\nIn 1965, Nader wrote his first book Unsafe at Any Speed. The bestselling book advocated for seatbelts and other improvements in car safety. Nader’s work on this issue was so impactful that then Speaker of the House John McCormack attributed the passing of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act to the “crusading spirit of one individual who believed he could do something: Ralph Nader.” This catapulted Nader into the public eye and started his long and distinguished career in consumer rights activism. In 1971, Nader founded Public Citizen a consumer rights activist organization which has advocated for government accountability. Nader was an important advocate for the creation of federal oversite agencies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nWell before most of the general public and policymakers understood the importance of climate change and environmental justice, Nader was working to pass critical legislation for our collective well-being, including the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act. He also pushed for the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn 2000, Nader ran for president receiving 2.8 million votes and enjoying strong support from the Arab American community. He would run two more campaigns, each time infusing the presidential race with discussion and debate of key issues that would most improve people’s lives. For his impact, Nader would be named one of the 100 most influential figures in American history by The Atlantic in 2006."
