        "text": "I.\n\nChicago, Illinois. August 29, 1968. Hubert Humphrey has just been nominated for President. The local police are rioting in the streets. \"Maybe,' I said to a celebrated leader of the Democratic Party, \"the only thing that can save us is a President who isn't a politician.\" You know, who's onto what's wrong but isn't part of it.\" Not the most tactful thing to say to a pro, but he saw the point. \"Yeah.\" He bit down hard on his pipe (cigars are bad for the image). \"Funny thing, too. I know all these guys pretty well and there isn't one of 'em who could run a small numbers racket, much less the country. Who you got in mind?\" At random, I said, \"Ralph Nader.\" The professional politician blinked. \"The seat-belts man?\" Then he shrugged. \"Well, forget it. You can't nominate anybody from outside. The ball game's rigged.\" That was three year's ago.\n\nII.\n\nGrand Forks, North Dakota, a month before the first Tuesday in November, traditional voting day for the citizens of that great Republic whose borders in the year of our gentle Lord 1970 stretched from the periphery of China in the west to the marches of old Persia in the east, from Arctic Circle to South Pole, an empire whose flag could be seen flapping in such odd places as the island of Diego Garcia (necessary to the security of the Indian Ocean), and offshore Guantanamo.\n\nIn Grand Forks, one of the election issues was a classic environmental confrontation between the Army Corps of Engineers and the local conservationists. The Army wanted to change the course of a river, altering disastrously the local ecology (North Dakota is still astonishingly pristine, a rolling wild countryside, seen at its vivid best on that blue-gold October day).\n\nOn a windy morning, the advocate in his role as Co-Chairman of the New Party arrived in North Dakota, to be greeted by press, television, and a crowd of literally tens of supporters, re-creating his recent airport arrivals in Iowa, Minnesota, Texas. The bandwagon was rolling.\n\nCrowds had been gratifyingly large, as they say, and interest keen. After all, what was the new party, and what do you call it? Oh, it's called the New Party, too, and a slight shadow would pass over certain faces, wanting to see celebrated in a name some future international, some blunt acknowledgment that the Republic was no damned good for most of the people who lived in it and downright hell for those caught in the sweep of its military disasters.\n\nThe Co-Chairman had his spiel: \"At Chicago, in 1968, the day after Eugene McCarthy was defeated by Humphrey and the party hacks, a thousand of us met at the University of Chicago in order to start a new party which would be just that.\"\n\nStanding before the television camera at the airport, the Co-Chairman was suddenly aware that his voice was sounding hollow again, a recent and disturbing phenomenon, something to do—he thought nervously—with talking out-of-doors, for he was a product of the cathedral quiet of the television studio (and the loving mother-eye of Camera Two) where, for what now seemed centuries, he had responded contentedly to several generations of television interviewers, their glazed eyes forever on clock, monitor, cue card. Oh, he was the fines, and knew it—at least, on his own ground. A mug's game maybe (joke on Muggeridge) but all his own.\n\nBut at Grand Forks there were only local television, an eager young candidate for the State Legislature, a pleasant cousin not met until now (the Co-Chairman's father was from nearby South Dakota, a fact he was to make much of through the day, though his father had got out early with a West Point appointment).\n\n\"Mr. Vidal, your Co-Chairman is Dr. Benjamin Spock, isn't he….\"\n\n\"That's right. And today he's campaigning in Massachusetts.\"\n\n\"Wasn't he convicted for supported draft dodgers….\"\n\nThe Co-Chairman's hearing is that of a lynx, whatever a lynx might be. On the word \"convicted,\" he overlapped his own voice with that of the interviewer, deliberately raising the decibel rate, an old television trick which, done swiftly enough, effectively erases the other person's dialogue. \"But we're here to talk about Mark Thornton, our candidate for the Eighteenth Legislative District seat. He is a first-rate environmentalist who's been getting considerable support….\"\n\nThat evening two thousand students and townsmen were gathered in a college auditorium. Politely they listened as I described the New Party, pondered ways of salvaging the environment, ending the American Empire. Then, deliberately, I played off the audience, let them lead me where they wanted to go, which is as good a way as any of finding out what \"the people\" are thinking, though a way seldom followed by the conventional politician with a set speech. Before Jack Kennedy's nomination in 1960, he delivered at least a thousand times an eloquent twenty-three minute speech to which he himself never listened. Struck by one of the quotations he used (from the \"Divine Dante\"), I asked him, a year later, for the exact quote. He looked blank. Then he shut his eyes and began the entire speech from the beginning until we finally got to the section containing the Divine Dante's wisdom. It was all on tape.\n\nI unspoiled a tape or two, which gave me time to study the audience. They were every bit as handsome as the countryside which sustained them. Blue-eyed Scandinavians of the sort for whom we Tonio Krogers would give (and come to think of it, did give) the world. Politically they were not liberal. Most were Republicans. Yet there was something tough and practical and reassuring about them, in the old American way. When I attacked the Democratic and Republican parties as two of a kind, and a kind bad for the Republic and the world it was spoiling, they cheered. Incidentally, this was to be my constant experience wherever I went last October. No one liked Nixon. No one liked Humphrey. Muskie was dim. While for every fan McCarthy retained, there were at least a dozen avenging angels ready to burn our poet-philosopher's ass if he ever again picked up his pipe and sought us to leave Hamelin Town.\n\n\"It is time for a new party.\" Yes, it is time all right but is the New Party that party? You ran Dick Gregory for President in 1968. That wasn't such a good idea. \"No, but not such a bad one since McCarthy wouldn't make the move.\" You have no money. \"True. Only grass-roots candidates here and there, bucking the system in order to save a local river or stop the mindless military conquest of the earth.\"\n\n\"Are you really the solution?\" was the constant question, and since the Co-Chairman cannot lie (but occasionally takes briefs under advisement, suggests changes of venue, has been known to disqualify himself at inconvenient moments…usually, when growth is genocide, forcing the Co-Chairman to hunker down like Julie Hoffman and to mutter \"f--- off,\" and they do), he points out virtues of a new party whose Presidential candidate would not be supported by those corporations who do the polluting of the atmosphere, who benefit from defense (sic) contracts.\n\nAs it is, 1972 will present us with the usual choice: on the one hand Nixon, on the other Muskie (or another like him). And the money each will get to campaign (some $30,000,000 apiece)…. Where will that come from?\n\nThe audience knows the answer. Just outside Grand Forks, A.B.M. missiles are being set up by Nixon in order to benefit those industrialists who gave him money in 1968 so that he could buy time on television in order to tell us that he would not continue with a war he had every intention of continuing since that is the deal, gentlemen, the bloody quid for the golden quo, and it is every bit as binding for a Democratic President as it is for a Republican President, even though that Democrat might be George McGovern, but won't be George McGovern because the party (which is flat broke as of March, 1971) won't get a blessed dime with the kind of peace talk he is prone to, while a Muskie, outspokenly evasive on the war (not unlike Nixon in '68) could pick up some money, particularly if he goes easy on all that clean-up-the-environment talk, as he is bound to do for the excellent reason that a principal source of money for either party comes from the oil men who do so much polluting, directly and indirectly, and have no intention of mending their ways. Why should they? This is America, isn't it?, where we have socialism for the deserving rich, and free enterprise for the undeserving poor.\n\nIn the past new American parties have been the result of some real or imagined flaw in national policy (the Republicans in 1856). Today the flaw which makes a new party a necessity is not one of policy but of structure. To put it simply, the wrong people dominate the two parties which in turn dominate our affairs. A familiar cry of Americans both left and right: We never have a choice! The military-industrial-media complex effectively keeps out of electoral politics those who would make substantive changes in the society. Such useful figures as Paul Ehrlich, Cesar Chavez, Nicholas Johnson, Margaret Mead (to name at random four), are each assigned a public niche and expected to stay there. On rare occasions, with luck, they may bring pressure to bear upon those who control the levers of power, but nothing more. Yet they are needed now in a way that most U.S. Senators are not, for they wrestle with actual problems. I stop abruptly.\n\nDubious looks from the audience. Questions begin. Speeches break out on the floor. Let's reform the Democratic Party. Support McGovern. Work within—all will be well. I listen, and wait (as I've done ever since the tour began) for someone to say something revelatory. And, truth to tell, to enjoy realizing that I am no longer alone. The desperation one has felt for the last five years is being shared at last. Everyone can now see the end of man, swiftly in a cobalt vapor, or slowly through poisoned air, water, earth, people.\n\nThe mood is now upon them and, as always, when tension builds, jokes get made. Silliness is in the air—a pleasant human safety valve. Can a Fourth Party ever really do anything (George Wallace is the third)?\n\nI pounce on that one. Take the environment. There exist solutions to most of our problems, including incontinent breeding. But they must be worked out, in detail. The New Party would go to the trouble of showing exactly how much it would cost to keep Lake Michigan from dying, and—a big point as more and more people are out of work—how many jobs will be needed to save the country's water.\n\nParenthetically, the Co-Chairman had once been a Democratic candidate for Congress in upstate New York and got the most votes of any Democrat in fifty years—something he insists upon reminding people of since he is not loved by The Media who serenely maintain that since he ought not to have done well in such an election, he did not do well. As a candidate, he had talked about the pollution of the Hudson River on whose banks he lived, about detergent suds appearing in local streams, about unemployment in Beacon, Hudson, Kingston, and he suggested that the cleaning up of the river would provide jobs…and so eloquent was he that he put everyone to sleep and didn't get their attention again until he agreed to talk about a movie he once wrote for Elizabeth Taylor, and what Jack Paar was really like.\n\nBut 1970 was as different from 1969 as Disneyland is from defoliated Vietnam. Like the rest of us, the North Dakotans know in general what is wrong, and why, and they can even—tentatively—connect themselves with great events…those Nixon A.B.M. nuclear missiles outside town are plainly bugging them. Wryly they joke about how they'd always counted on surviving a nuclear war (so long, New York City, Chicago, L.A.). But now we'll get the first attack. They found this unjust.\n\nThen: O.K. A new political party is a good idea (though some of your ideas sound a bit like socialism but even so…). Yet could anything really be changed? You've already told us you don't have any money, and it takes millions of dollars to get elected President. So what do you to?\n\nI go for blue sky, as the sportswriters say. \"You nominate a candidate for President a year before the election. You give him the best possible programs to dramatize. Where the others make themselves absolutely clear they're against the war, pollution, the works, he will make it absolutely clear what it's going to cost, and indicate—sadly, of course—that money can only come from one place, the Pentagon, which currently takes fifty cents of every tax dollar while only seventeen cents go to services for the people. Now if you reverse these statistics….\"\n\nYes. Yes. Yes. The audience is now way ahead of me. Ecological pie-in-the-sky is their daily dessert. So who are you going to run for President? Who can be trusted to do what we all agree needs to be done? You can't start with an unknown. Your new party carries no weight. And you've already said you don't want a discredited national politician. You've even turned your back on the sweet singer from Minnesota. So who, in God's name, is there who could run and be elected?\n\n\"Ralph Nader.\" A brief stillness. Then the applause begins. And goes on. And on.\n\nIII.\n\nThe despicable 1970 election came and went, and the New Party candidates all failed to be elected (though the young man in North Dakota did very well) and we are still alive, busily preparing now to get on the ballot in all fifty states in time for the 1972 Presidential election—quite an undertaking since in a free country only certain interests may present themselves for election. All others must be prepared to go through a Byzantine maze of local election requirements, on the order of that lily-white pipe-fitters union which keeps out blacks with a questionnaire that includes, among other recondite requests for information, \"Who wrote the 'Divine Comedy'?\"\n\nThe reaction I got to Ralph Nader in Grand Forks was repeated throughout the Middle West, as well as in the whole country when I proposed him for President on national television.\n\nNader's image is unique in a way that no politician's can be. Millions think him to be \"people-oriented,\" as they say along Madison Avenue; also, he strikes them as entirely lacking in that lust for personal gain which is what the American way of life is all about. In a land of mangy carnivores, he is true unicorn.\n\nRecently an advertising executive explained to me the state of the union (yes, wisdom may enter at any door). \"There is only one issue: the economy.\" The executive looked at me severely. \"People out of work. High prices. Inflation. That's why your idea about Nader is right on.\"\n\nPause. Then, briskly: \"Every week we prepare in-depth surveys of who is buying what and why. That's our business. Our bread and butter.\" I waited for \"our jam, too\" but he has just put his house in Westport on the market. \"And do you know what we are finding week after week? That price is everything.\" I looked blank: wasn't that always the case? He spelled it out for me. \"Some products we sell on sex appeal. Greasy Soap makes you irresistible to chicks. Or Gin with Genuine Juniper Berry Tang will make you the life of the party. Stuff like that. Convince the schmucks that there really is a difference between getting drunk on gin instead of vodka. Well, baby, none of that works today.\" Pain sat on his brow. \"They're looking for bargains. They want their money's worth. And if rubbing alcohol is a cheaper drunk than Genuine Juniper Berry Tang, then they buy the rubbing alcohol. As for sex appeal, forget it. They're all grooving alone anyway, the single. I mean who can afford to go out to dinner, the movies? So this is where your idea about Nader is good thinking. He's identified with the only thing they care about: cost of living and whether or not what they buy is crap. They know he's on their side against the big companies that steal them blind with faulty appliances and super-enriched food with goodness-added you can starve to death on. Of course, they like him, maybe love him. He's the only one there is like him and then—get this! They've heard of him! Nader falls, I'd say, in the fifty to sixty percent recognition range.\"\n\nFor those ignorant of demographics, \"recognition range\" simply means how many Americans have heard of a given person or product. Except for the President, the Kennedys, two or three Presidential candidates, a handful of television and movie personalities, the American public is quite unaware of who—or what—are the Secretary of State, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Maria Callas, Birch Bayh…you name 'em and they don't know 'em. How this state of affairs could arise in a nation supposedly welded into a single electronic village (Canada's most famous seer probably has an R.R. in the ten-percent range) is one of the diviner mysteries of our declining civilization; the result, perhaps, of an educational system instinctively devised to keep everyone at exactly the same state of democratic ignorance. In any case, over half the adult population will never read a book during their lifetime, and close to twenty-five percent are functionally illiterate. It is a chastening experience for those of us who stare into the bright lights of the media year after year and are known finally to a mere ten percent of the population. After Norman Mailer's highly publicized race for Mayor of New York, he was, on election day, quite unknown to sixty percent of the voters in that city, and generally unknown to the rest of the country.\n\nRalph Nader has the distinction (the March, 1971 Gallup survey) of being known to fifty percent of American men and thirty-seven percent of American women among a national sample of 1571 adult. He is well-regarded by the thirty-to-forty-nine-year-olds, who are most likely to vote.\n\nNader's image is positive while those of Nixon and Muskie are—how shall I put it?—blah. Or in the tactful prose of the Harris Survey (2/18/71): \"Basically, Mr. Nixon is viewed as 'cool-headed' and 'sincere' but not particularly 'up-to-date' or 'exciting.'\" Parenthetically, the electorate has a positive genius for missing the point to public men. Demonstrably, Nixon is not \"cool-headed\" (weeping in public on Knowland's shoulder after the little dog Checkers speech, snarling and spitting at the press after his 1962 defeat for governor in California, etc.). While not even Nixon's most devoted associated have ever thought him \"sincere\" (\"now I am a Keynesian,\" he told us recently, discarding with five easy words a lifetime's devotion to a laissez faire system of economics that made Adam Smith look like Harry Hopkins). But the people—like the media which shape them—tend to believe that a President's character is what it ought to be; and evidence to the contrary is simply ignored. Just before Jack Kennedy was killed, a cross-section of the electorate was offered a long list of \"good,\" \"bad,\" and \"wishy-washy\" adjectives and asked to check off the ones most applicable to the 35th' magistrate. Astonishingly, Kennedy's wit (the one thoroughly unique, not to mention obvious thing about him) scored last while a majority agreed that his most positive, attractive trait was excellence as husband and father, hardly the Prince's strongest suit—but let us not anticipate the next generation's favorite reading.\n\nHarris found that Senator Muskie's profile with the people was as dull as Nixon's, with the added \"disadvantage [?] that roughly one in four people simply do not feel they are familiar enough with him to pass judgment.\"\n\nNot long ago, an executive of the New Party discussed the Presidential matter with Nader. Nader said he did not want to be a candidate. For one thing, he would lose all usefulness as a consumerist. For another, he would probably split the \"liberal\" vote and so reelect Nixon.\n\nFebruary 28, 1971 in an interview with Henry Brandon of the London Sunday Times, he added to his argument: \"Most people think there are only two ways to create power in the U.S.: to acquire economic power or to achieve political power. I think it's important to…see if power cannot be developed to work on these institutions (the corporations, the existing federal and state bureaucracies) from nothing but a will, determination and creativity.\" Certainly in five years, Nader has made a profound impression on such mighty corporations as General Motors. Yet the automobile industry is still responsible for much of the nation's air pollution, and no matter how many dedicated young lawyers join Nader's various crusades, they will never have sufficient clout to force the indolent magnates of Detroit to produce a non-polluting engine (estimated by Nader to cost $150,000,000 or seventy-four hours of G.M's gross company revenue). But an American President might just be able to do the trick.\n\nNader's arguments as to why he ought not to run for President are understandable but hardly compelling. As a non-politician running for President on a platform he has himself assembled and made popular over the years, Nader could hardly be mistaken for a professional power-seeker. Incidentally, between now and fall, he will publish eight carefully researched reports on such subjects as water pollution (The Water Lords), nursing homes (Old Age: The Last Segregation), uses and abuses of paper and pulp in Maine (preface by Senator Muskie?), California land practices, and the impact, Heaven help us, of the Duponts on Delaware. No one can say he is evasive about the issues.\n\nAs for reelecting Nixon, Nader might just as easily help make him San Clemente's favorite librarian. After all it will be a four-way race in 1972. Ole George will take the solid South; Muskie (with the support of George Meany and Mayor Daley) will try to hold the center, though things fall apart; and the President—demonstrating his legendary sincerity—will grab onto whatever looks like a winning issue, probably an invasion of China (to protect, naturally, our withdrawal from Indochina) on the ground that, historically, the American people never change horses in midstream…preferring, in this case, to drown with mad Phaeton at the reins. Against such a trio, fourth-party candidate Nader would look like Lincoln.\n\nMore to the point, in a four-way race, with a President no one particularly likes, a failing economy, an Army on the point of mutiny in the field, there is no reason why a non-politician who said he would curb the Pentagon and meant it, said he would clean up the environment and meant it, might not sweep to victory. There are no rules in American politics today. The thing is there to be put together by anyone shrewd enough and—let us pray—noble enough to take on the job.\n\nI told the New Party not to be discouraged by Nader's no. \"How becoming,\" I noted, \"to find a man who does not want the office. Not to mention traditional.\" In the old days politicians always feigned reluctance. Now they open an office eight years in advance of election day. Meanwhile an associate of Nader told me: \"You want cold turkey? Well, Ralph might want to be President some day. Why not? All the reasons you think he's right for it, he does too—to make a drastic change in the whole style of the country. But he doesn't want to be a fourth-party candidate, and he thinks 1972 is too soon. \"\n\nThis sounded more like it. I sent back word (to this day I have not met Ralph Nader: Platonic essence is sufficient for the moment) that it was 1972 or never. Time is running out for us. The United States is fast becoming the sort of society our ancestors fled. Tell Nader, I said, that since neither the Democrats nor the Republicans will nominate him he ought to run as a fourth-party candidate. That was that. In January I went to Japan. Nader was also there. For five days what he did and said filled the front pages of every newspaper in the country. \"Nader's arrival here,\" said a Japanese journalist, \"has had the most extraordinary effect. You know, we are governed by a very stupid consortium of politicians and industrialists, interested only in profits. As a result, our islands are being wrecked environmentally. Now Nader comes and talks about real problems. Shows us solutions. No foreigner has had such an impact on Japan since MacArthur….\"\n\nMy friend was impressed. I was, too: this thirty-seven-year-old American lawyer, with nothing going for him except intelligence and will, was able to command the attention of two hundred million Japanese who have for some time regarded the United States as an imbecilic power, deservedly on the skids. It was an extraordinary display, and one felt better about being an American. Incidentally, the Japanese were most impressed by Nader's prowess as a linguist. He is fluent in Arabic and has a working knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Chinese. I told the Japanese that I was even more impressed by his mastery of English, a language many of our recent Presidents have found difficult.\n\nI came back to America in February to learn that something very odd had just happened in Chicago (after the convention of '68, I thought it doubtful that the Second City would ever surprise anyone again, but it has). On November 23, Mike Royko, a columnist for the Chicago Daily News, put a coupon at the foot of his column with five names and room for write-ins. The names were Muskie, Kennedy, McGovern, Humphrey and Nader. In his column of December 1, Royko wrote that \"political popularity polls don't really reflect public sentiment because the citizens are offered a limited selection of politicians by the pollsters.\" He then gave the coupon tally. \"So far 2067 people have responded. This is how they voted: Nader 1614, Muskie 148, Kennedy 42, McGovern 41, Humphrey 11. Another 211 votes were scattered among scores of other individuals, none receiving enough to itemize.\n\nMost impressive, Royko found, were \"the accompanying letters. I've never received that much mail about any political figure I've written about except when the readers suggested that one of them be put behind bars…. Throughout the letters ran a common theme: Nader is honest; Nader cares about ordinary people; Nader won't sell out the people for the good of a political party.\"\n\nThe Royko poll has been much discussed privately by politicians of every party. One Democratic leader allowed himself a daydream. \"Okay, Muskie doesn't catch fire. Teddy never gets dried off after that midnight swim. McGovern scares away the money and Jackson scares away the voters. There is a real grass-roots sentiment for Nader. It's 1940 all over again when honest Wendell Willkie, the simple Hoosier Wall Street lawyer, goes to the convention at Philadelphia and knocks off the pros, like Dewey, Vandenberg, Taft. Oh, it's possible, no doubt of that.\" The Democratic leader puffed on his cigarette. \"Why, the kid's already got the makings of an organization. Out in Minnesota. Oregon. Those college kids who kick in a dollar or whatever it is to hire lawyers to give big business hell.\" Some sixth sense (can I be psychic?) told me that the Democratic leader might not at heart approve of Nader's lifework. But it didn't matter. The subject was winning an election. \"So we nominate him. People's choice. The party that denied you Gene McCarthy, because we were ignorant blue meanies, now gives you Ralph. Go to it, kids! Yes. There's mileage there.\" Slow happy smile—an artist getting an effect right. \"Then we nominate a Vice-President for the grown-ups. And that'd be Scoop Jackson. Good liberal domestically but strong on the war, strong on defense. Nader and Jackson versus Nixon and Agnew.\" Eyes opened very wide. \"You know we'd win.\"\n\nI hope \"we\" don't, I thought to myself. The whole point to a Nader candidacy would be not making an accommodation with someone like Jackson…after all, the country that gave us Lee Harvey Oswald would dearly love another go at making a fool of history. But I was satisfied. A professional politician, known for his nuts-and-bolts practicality, could at least imagine a major party endorsing and nominating Nader.\n\nAre the American people sufficiently alert to their true interest to realize the value of rejecting the conventional politicians in favor of someone like Nader who might actually do something? Evidence is confused. On the one hand, a Gallup survey shows that only eleven percent would be willing to make the plunge…on the ground that the top political job should go to someone who has won his spurs as a professional politician, et cetera. This is a natural response to a certain kind of question. Yet recent Harris polls reveal a general indifference to—and often dislike off—all the known Presidential candidates, and suburbia is currently looking for a hero.\n\nFor Nader to be the Democratic nominee for President there must, first, be a grassroots movement on every campus, in every old-age ghetto (thirty-five percent of the electorate is over fifty-five…and he's their man), among conservationists, consumerists, zero-population growthers, and (second) an all-out attempt to win the Democratic primary in California, a long shot but by no means an impossibility in the light of Eugene McCarthy's experiment four years ago: known to hardly anyone outside Minnesota, he won New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Oregon and only lost California to the fully marshaled ranks of a tardy revival of Camelot. It is more likely, however, that the Democrats will continue in their usual folly at convention time and allow the usual power brokers to nominate Hubert Humphrey. At that point all those concerned with the future of our sad Republic will have to face up to the inadequacies of the present three party system which is really one and a half—the Democrat-Republicans versus George Wallace—and the need for a fourth party to spell out what is wrong and how it can be fixed. For that reason alone, Nader is the ideal new-party candidate for 1972: a figure around whom those disgusted with traditional politics can rally, a point of hope, a new beginning in our tangled affairs. As for those of moderate disposition who say with horror: but you'll only split the liberal vote and reelect Nixon! the plain answer is that between a Nixon and a Muskie there is but a smile's difference. Besides, is it not of far greater urgency for at least one Presidential candidate to say the unsayable, to propose drastic measures which our masters may not like but the governed, in time, will respond to? Certainly the alternative is a revolutionary situation which the powers that govern us are eager to exploit since to them, not the weather people (their best weapon), goes the victory. Already the secret police are everywhere, the means of repression are at hand, and the will to use those means is not lacking in high places."
