He received his highest percentage of the popular vote in 2000 (3%).\n\nDuring the 1960s, was a major campaigner for laws requiring the existence and use of seatbelts, padded dashes, shatter proof windshields in every car in America, saving literally hundreds of thousands of american lives.\n\nWas once chosen to be the keynote speaker for a convention of Chevrolet Corvair collectors.\n\nSept 2003: \"It is fascinating to watch legislators turn away from their usual corporate grips when they hear the growing thunder of the people.\"\n\nJuly 2003: \"We need to stimulate communities all over our land to start arboretums, not just as oases of beauty and tranquility but as living teachers of plant life and conservation.\"\n\nNov 2003: \"The nation is faced with one of the most corporate-orientated anti-consumer Congresses in our history.\"\n\nI once said to my father, when I was a boy, 'Dad we need a third political party.' He said to me, 'I'll settle for a second.'"
