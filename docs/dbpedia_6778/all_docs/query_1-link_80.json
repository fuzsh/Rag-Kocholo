        "text": "Ralph Nader has announced that he will be a candidate in this year's US presidential race, running as an independent.\n\nIt's not the first time he has thrown his hat in the ring. In the 2000 election he was accused by many Democrats of stealing their votes and allowing George Bush to take the White House.\n\nMr Nader has been an influential figure in American public life for 40 years.\n\nThe 74-year-old campaigns against what he sees as corporate greed and wasteful defence spending as well as championing consumer rights and the need to protect the environment.\n\nHis supporters argue that he is a kind of grassroots visionary whose ideas start life on the fringes of political debate then move to the centre, but he achieved only 2.74% of the popular vote in 2000.\n\nSo what is the point of him running again this time?\n\nListen Listen to Ralph Nader\n\nSo could Mr Nader's candidacy draw crucial votes away from the left and help the Republican party in this year's elections?\n\nOr was Mr Nader's part in Al Gore's defeat overblown? Bob Zelnick is a political commentator and author of a biography on Al Gore.\n\nListen Listen to Bob Zelnick\n\nFirst broadcast 24th and 25th February"
