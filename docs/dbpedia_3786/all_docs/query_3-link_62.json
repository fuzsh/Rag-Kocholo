        "text": "If a police officer has ever pulled you over, you may have noticed them running your license plate through their database. But what exactly do cops see when they run your plates? Most people don’t realize that when police officers run your plates, they are able to access a lot of information about you and your vehicle.\n\nLet’s take a look behind the scenes to see what cops check when running your license plates. If you’ve been charged with a crime after the police ran your plates, reach out to White Law PLLC’s Michigan criminal defense lawyers for help with your case.\n\nWhat is License Plate Scanning?\n\nLicense plate scanning is the use of cameras and technology to scan and read license plates on vehicles. Law enforcement officers use these systems to run checks on vehicles and their drivers.\n\nThe technology used in license plate scanning has advanced significantly over the years. Police officers used to have to manually enter license plate numbers into a computer to run a check. Now, license plate scanning systems can automatically read plates from a distance, even while the car is moving.\n\nThese scanning systems use optical character recognition (OCR) technology to capture and interpret the numbers and letters on the license plates. The system then runs the information through various databases to find any relevant information.\n\nIncreasing Prevalence\n\nLicense plate scanning is becoming more prevalent in law enforcement, with many police cars now equipped with license plate scanning systems. While it may seem invasive, it can effectively find stolen vehicles, locate suspects, and enforce traffic violations.\n\nWhat Information Do Cops Get When They Run Your Plates?\n\nWhen a police officer runs your license plate, they receive a range of information about you and your vehicle. The main information provided is your license plate number, which allows them to access the vehicle’s registration details and owner information.\n\nThey also have access to criminal databases, allowing them to check if the vehicle is stolen or the owner has a criminal record. They can also find out if the driver has any outstanding warrants or if the vehicle is associated with any recent crimes.\n\nHow Is this Information Used?\n\nThe information obtained from a license plate check can be critical in helping law enforcement officers catch criminals and keep the public safe. However, it is important to remember that not all license plate checks are carried out with malicious intent. Routine checks can be conducted to ensure that the driver and vehicle are complying with the law and to prevent potential violations.\n\nRegardless of the purpose of the check, it is crucial for drivers to always follow traffic laws and ensure that their vehicles are properly registered and maintained to avoid any unwanted consequences.\n\nThe Purpose of Running Plates\n\nThe main purpose of running license plates is to gather information about the vehicle’s registered owner and ensure that the vehicle is not stolen, uninsured, or involved in any criminal activity. It also helps police officers identify any outstanding warrants or citations for the owner or other individuals associated with the vehicle.\n\nIn addition to identifying the owner, license plate scanning is used to monitor traffic, detect any traffic violations, and provide valuable information to law enforcement agencies to help them solve crimes. This includes:\n\nGathering data on the whereabouts of suspects\n\nSuspect vehicles\n\nKnown associates with the suspect\n\nLicense plate scanning is an effective tool in law enforcement, but it also has its limitations. Police officers are not able to access private information such as personal data or financial information from license plate scanning. The use of license plate scanning technology is regulated to ensure that it is not used to invade the privacy of individuals without reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.\n\nCommon Reasons for License Plate Checks\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why cops might run your license plate. One of the most common is to check if the vehicle has been stolen. When a car is reported as stolen, its license plate information is entered into a national database that law enforcement can access. This means that when cops run a license plate check, they can quickly determine if the vehicle they are looking at has been reported as stolen.\n\nAnother reason why cops might run a license plate check is to see if the vehicle is associated with any outstanding warrants or unpaid fines. These checks are often automated and can alert law enforcement officers if a vehicle is flagged in their system. This can help them identify drivers who may have unresolved legal issues.\n\nFinally, license plate checks are often used in situations where a car has been involved in a hit-and-run or other crime. By checking the license plate information, cops can quickly identify the owner of the vehicle and gather important evidence that may be used in a criminal investigation.\n\nUnderstand What Cops See When They Run Your License Plates\n\nLicense plate scanning has become an essential tool for law enforcement agencies. The technology has revolutionized how police officers check for information on a vehicle and its driver."
