        "text": "What is Mapbox Traffic Data?\n\nMapbox Traffic Data is a dataset of estimated road speeds. It includes live speeds representing current traffic conditions and typical speeds with typical traffic conditions throughout the week.\n\nâ\n\nWhy is Mapbox Traffic Data useful?\n\nPowering custom routing engines: Mapbox Traffic Data is designed to integrate with routing engines (e.g., OSRM or Graphhopper) to generate traffic-aware ETAs, and find the most efficient routes including traffic data.\n\nTraffic analysis and simulation: Mapbox Traffic Data can be used for traffic analysis, urban planning, and other use cases that require analysis of raw traffic data.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the difference between Typical and Live speeds?\n\nTypical: Estimated speeds throughout the week based on historical observations. Typical traffic is available in 5 minute increments for a typical day of the week (e.g., 1:30-1:35pm Monday).\n\nLive: Current speed based on live data, where available. Live speed profiles are updated every 5 minutes, based on data not more than 15 minutes old.\n\nSince Live data is not available for all roads, many customers fall back to Typical speeds when live data is not available. Offline routing, planning, and simulation only use Typical speeds.\n\nâ\n\nHow is Mapbox Traffic Data calculated?\n\nMobile applications that use a Mapbox SDK send location data (only where permitted by the end user through their mobile deviceâs operating system, which they may opt-out of at any time). Mapbox then anonymizes and aggregates such location telemetry and then calculates speed statistics for the road network, producing traffic updates.\n\nâ\n\nWhere is Mapbox Traffic Data available?\n\nMapbox Traffic Data has global coverage, including\n\nNorth America\n\nWestern Europe\n\nMiddle East\n\nAustralia &Â New Zealand\n\nJapan &Â Korea\n\nFor coverage information in specific geographic markets, please contact us.\n\nâ\n\nHow do I get started?\n\nSee our documentation for details on sample data and format. If youâd like to evaluate in a specific area, contact our sales team.\n\nHow is Mapbox Traffic Data stored and formatted?\n\nMapbox Traffic Data is stored in files specific to the intersection of a time zone and a Zoom 7 tile, as described in this specification. Each Zoom 7 tile is large enough to capture a major metropolitan area, small US state, or small European country. You can view tiles using an interactive tool here.\n\nTo see our full format, you can view our documentation.\n\nâ\n\nHow can I use Mapbox Traffic Data with another map like HERE or TomTom?\n\nMapbox Traffic Data is available using openLR encoding, which can be used for any map. See http://www.openlr.org for more information on openLR.\n\nâ\n\nHow large is Mapbox Traffic Data?\n\nData size per tile depends on road density. For a highly-populated area (e.g., city center):\n\ntypical data: Traffic Data for a dense urban tile is approximately 2GB compressed or 20GB uncompressed. Most tiles are much smaller than this.\n\nlive data: Approximately 5 MB per tile, and covers only roads with live traffic estimate.\n\nâ\n\nHow often is the data updated?\n\nlive traffic files are updated every 5 minutes, based on data not more than 15 minutes old.\n\ntypical traffic is updated monthly.\n\nHow much does Mapbox Traffic Data cost?\n\nMapbox Traffic Data is only available through an Enterprise plan, and is licensed annually for a specific geographic region (city, state, or country). Contact our sales team for more information.\n\nâ\n\nWhat are the contractual limitations?\n\nThere are two contractual limitations on Mapbox Traffic Data:\n\nResell and creation of similar datasets: As described in our standard terms of service,\n\nYou cannot resell or redistribute Mapbox Traffic Data\n\nYou cannot develop, test, validate and/or improve any service or dataset that is a substitute for, or substantially similar to Mapbox Traffic Data\n\nFor clarity, comparisons of Traffic Data to ground truth are allowed for testing and evaluation purposes. However, automated of Traffic Data to other datasets (for instance, training a similar dataset) is prohibited.\n\nData Sharing: Because traffic data relies on aggregate statistics generated by Mapboxâs customersâ anonymized users, location telemetry (generated by a licensed application powered by Mapbox traffic data) comes to Mapbox servers and is promptly anonymized. For instance, if traffic data is used in a route planning application in the United States, location telemetry will come to Mapbox and then be promptly anonymized prior to generating aggregate statistics.\n\nâ\n\nCan I use Mapbox Traffic Data without a Mapbox map?\n\nYes - you may use Mapbox Traffic Data in conjunction with any map (or without any map at all)."
