        "text": "Your Traffic Overview displays traffic patterns over time, identifying trends as well as highlighting opportunities for growth.\n\nCheck your site's traffic metrics, like sessions by device, country, new vs. returning visitors and more. In this article, you'll learn about all potential metrics you may see.\n\nYou can find the Traffic Overview page under Analytics in your site's dashboard.\n\nView your Traffic Overview.\n\nNote:\n\nTraffic from any visitors who have not accepted the site's cookies (or are using certain types of ad blockers) will not appear in these reports. If you see discrepancies in your site (e.g. someone purchased an item from your store but you can't see the site session) this could be why.\n\nSite sessions and unique visitors\n\nA session is a web visit of a site visitor. A session starts when a visitor reaches your site, and ends after 30 minutes of inactivity. In each session there can be multiple page views and actions performed by a visitor, and each visitor can visit more than once.\n\nA unique visitor is a person who visited your site, unique by device and browser. Therefore, if the same person visits from 2 different devices, they will be counted as 2 different visitors.\n\nThe trend shown next to the metric demonstrates how the metric has changed compared to the previous period (equivalent to the selected period). A red trend indicates a decrease in activity, while a green trend indicates an increase in activity.\n\nSessions over time\n\nThis graph allows you to view your site sessions over time. View seasonal trends and pinpoint spikes in traffic to determine the most impactful time to share new content, plan promotions or launch new campaigns.\n\nHover over the graph to see the exact number of sessions on each date.\n\nSessions and visitors by source and category\n\nUnderstand where your site visitors are coming from to effectively tailor your content, reach your target audience and take your traffic to new heights.\n\nSee which external sites are driving traffic to your site, as well as the category they belong to. Click the drop-down to filter by source, category, or both.\n\nTraffic source: The sites that people are navigating to your site from (e.g. X.com, Medium.com).\n\nTraffic category: The category of sites that people are navigating to your site from (e.g. social, email, organic search).\n\nNew vs. returning visitors\n\nThis chart shows the amount of new visitors, returning visitors, and the total Unique Visitors to your site. Gauge audience retention and loyalty while developing your knowledge of the site's appeal to new visitors.\n\nSessions by device\n\nThis chart shows the amount of visitors to your site using a desktop, mobile, or tablet. Explore the devices used by visitors to optimize your site layout, enhance accessibility and expand your site reach.\n\nWhat else can I learn about my visitors?\n\nA visitor's details are unknown except for their device and browser. If you wish to capture more information, consider adding a form to your site so visitors can provide information about themselves.\n\nSessions by country\n\nThis metric shows you the countries your visitors are located in when they visit your site. Explore the countries with the highest engagement, give your marketing efforts specific focus and customize your content to suit different cultures.\n\nClick on the map to explore sessions by city and (when applicable) by state.\n\nAverage sessions by time\n\nMake informed decisions about the best day and time to update your content, post your new blog or add exciting products to your store.\n\nView a graph of the average number of sessions your site gets per day. Hover over a day to see the exact number. Click the day drop-down to change the metric to average sessions per hour.\n\nTraffic insights\n\nDiscover a range of information and identify the areas that you can grow your site the most. Insights are takeaways based on your data from the last 30 days. In this section, you can see insights from the most popular page to the page where most of your traffic drops off.\n\nOpen the Insights page to see more traffic insights and other types of insights regarding different areas of activity.\n\nLooking for more data?\n\nClick the date picker drop-down at the top of the Traffic Overview to change the time period that data is pulled from (the default is 30 days).\n\nClick See full report in a section to see an in-depth report about that activity."
