        "text": "If you ever needed to get something important from the government in a timely manner, you know that it can be a headache. Outdated and unhelpful websites, spending what seems like hours on hold, and ambiguous forms make the task daunting. In order to cut through some of the confusion, see below for some helpful guidelines in getting your police report, traffic video, or red light camera stills.\n\nHow to Order Traffic Camera Footage\n\nTypes of Traffic Camera Footage\n\nTraffic camera footage of an accident or traffic violation can come from a variety of sources including:\n\nactual traffic cameras, like red light cameras or automated speed enforcement cameras\n\nbusiness surveillance cameras\n\ndash cameras from police vehicles\n\nother cameras like witness cellphones or home surveillance systems\n\nThe process for requesting traffic camera video varies depending on the type of footage that recorded your car accident or speeding violation.\n\nHow do I obtain traffic camera video or images from red light cameras in Chicago?\n\nThink you saw a flash as you creeped up to an intersection? Worried that a red light camera may have gone off? A ticket along with a notice should arrive to the registered owner’s address within five to seven business days. If you think you received a red light ticket in the City of Chicago but cannot wait to see if you got a ticket in the mail, you can also check online. The Chicago Parking and Red Light Administration website allows you to gather some information about the alleged violation. You can search for parking tickets, view photos, view speed videos, view red light videos, and can even contest a ticket.\n\nOnce you have a ticket from Chicago’s red light cameras in hand, you can log in at chicagophotociteweb.com to view videos and/or stills of the alleged red light camera violation. You will need your ticket number and license plate number to access this type of footage from red light cameras.\n\nHow do I see videos or images from speed traffic cameras in Chicago?\n\nTo see photos, video, and speed of the alleged violation captured by speed traffic cameras in Chicago, visit violationinfo.com/Chicago/ and have your ticket number and license plate number handy.\n\nHow long do traffic cameras keep footage?\n\nFootage of the constant stream of the intersections with cameras is available for 30 days. Alleged violations caught on a red light camera or speed camera is available for viewing up to two years. However, keep in mind that you only have a set amount of time to contest a ticket.\n\nHow do I get other types of video footage of a car accident?\n\nIf you want to get video footage from other sources including business surveillance cameras, home surveillance cameras, or police dash cameras, you may need to enlist the help of an experienced attorney to assist with your accident claim. They will act fast to ensure that any potential footage from traffic cameras is saved and preserved so it can be used as evidence in your favor. These are the steps they will take to get the footage of your auto accident quickly and efficiently:\n\nIdentify\n\nIdentify the type of camera footage that is trying to be obtained.\n\nIs it a traffic camera? If so, then the municipality controls the footage, see instructions above.\n\nIs it police dash camera footage? If so, then the police agency controls the footage.\n\nIs it private surveillance camera footage? If so, then the business or homeowner controls the surveillance camera footage.\n\nYou can also watch our step by step guide to submitting FOIA requests for access to things like the City of Chicago’s 24-hour streaming video from red-light cameras or video from Chicago police observation device cameras.\n\nConfirm\n\nContact the person, business, or municipality and confirm whether potential footage exists.\n\nGive Notice\n\nContact the person, business or entity with a written document demanding that the footage be preserved and saved. This document is customarily called a “Spoliation Letter.”\n\nSpoliation Letter must identify the date, approximate time, location, and language demanding that the video be preserved in anticipation of litigation. The letter should be sent certified mail to confirm receipt.\n\nConfirm Again\n\nContact and confirm that the person, business or entity received the Spoliation Letter requesting that any footage be preserved.\n\nWhat if obtaining footage from traffic cameras requires a subpoena?\n\nIf a subpoena is required before any video footage for the incident is released, then you should contact an experienced personal injury attorney to help. If you were involved in an accident and believe there is video footage, call The Kryder Law Group for a free consultation. Our personal injury attorneys are ready to answer your questions about obtaining footage from traffic cameras that are relevant to your case.\n\nHow to Order a Police Report\n\nPolice Report Contents\n\nThe first document created following a motor vehicle accident of any sort is a police report. The police report is a document written by the police officer investigating the accident. The purpose of the report is to memorialize all relevant details concerning the accident. This may include the names of all drivers involved, addresses, and contact information of all drivers and witnesses. The police report also details points of contact on the vehicles, weather conditions, and whether any tickets were issued.\n\nWhy do I need a copy of the police report?\n\nHaving a copy of the police report is essential to your accident claim and is needed to:\n\nProvide to your insurance company and the other driver’s insurance company to assist with their evaluation;\n\nProvide to the hospital to assist in determining the severity of your injuries;\n\nAssist your attorney with notifying the proper insurance company of your personal injury and/or property damage claim;\n\nAssist your attorney with drafting the complaint for your lawsuit naming the proper at-fault driver.\n\nWhat do I need to get a copy of the police report?\n\nBefore starting the process of getting a police report, you need to make sure you have:\n\nthe date of crash\n\nthe other driver’s first and last name\n\nthe intersection or location of where the crash happened\n\nAlternatively, if you have an RD number, you can provide that to responsible agency.\n\nHow long before the police report is available?\n\nGenerally, it takes a few business days before the police report is officially completed and is available to the public. Trying to obtain a police report before it is in the system will lead to frustrating dead ends.\n\nHow do I request a copy of the police report?\n\nEach agency will handle requests differently. For accidents investigated by the Chicago Police Department, you can get police reports two ways (if you are looking for a police report for a car accident, traffic crash reports are also available online):\n\nYou can make the request in person at the Central Police Headquarters located at 3510 S. Michigan, 1st Floor, Room 1043 in Chicago, Illinois. Make sure you have the information needed as described above.\n\nYou can mail your request to the Chicago Police Department, Attention Records Inquiry and Customer Service Section, Unit 163, 3510 S. Michigan Ave. in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nIf you request the police report by mail, you will need a self addressed stamped envelope and a check or money order made payable to the “Department of Revenue, City of Chicago.”\n\nHow much does it cost to order a police report in Chicago?\n\nIt is .50 cents for each copy of the case report, $5.00 for each copy of the traffic crash report, and $20.00 for a report that is generated by an accident reconstruction officer or their team."
