        "text": "Public roads are those that can be driven by anyone. Naturally, they are by far the most important roads on the Waze map.\n\nThe Freeway and Ramp road types each have their own special rules. The Major Highway , Minor Highway , and Primary Street types are designated using a set of minimum criteria, as explained below.\n\nPublic roads are designated by a series of minimum criteria.\n\nIf a road meets any one criterion for a type, the road must be at least that type.\n\nFor example,\n\na county highway (Waze: at least primary street) that is classified as a principal arterial (Waze: at least major highway) would be classified in Waze as a Major Highway .\n\na state highway (Waze: at least minor highway) that is classified as a major collector (Waze: at least primary street) would be classified in Waze as a Minor Highway .\n\na locally maintained road (Waze: at least street) that is classified as an other arterial (Waze: at least minor highway) would be classified in Waze as a Minor Highway .\n\nIf a road meets the criteria for multiple types, the highest of those types must be used, to satisfy every \"at least\" rule.\n\nA hybrid system\n\nPublic road types in the United States are determined through a hybrid system of FHWA functional classification and U.S., state, and sometimes county highway systems. These systems work together to create a harmonious Waze map with excellent routing characteristics. Neither of these two facets of the road type system should be considered sufficient on its own, without the other. The road type guidance has been carefully crafted to join these two systems into one single contiguous Waze road type system.\n\nFunctional classification\n\nFunctional classifications (FC) are determined using a set of criteria selected by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). These criteria include not only the physical attributes of the road but also efficiency of travel, number of access points, speed limits, route spacing, actual usage, and continuity. This can lead to quite different classifications for roads that appear similar. For example, a six-lane divided road in an urbanized area may be a Collector (Primary Street); a two-lane road through the middle of a town may be a principal arterial (Major Highway).\n\nFunctional classification is a national standard, but functional classification maps are published by state departments of transportation. Links to functional classification maps for each state can be found on the functional classification page.\n\nHighway systems\n\nThe Interstate Highway System (formally, the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways) is a nationwide network of freeways designated by Congress and administered by the FHWA and AASHTO, a nationwide organization of state departments of transportation with governmental support. The system facilitates high-speed travel throughout the nation.\n\nThe United States Numbered Highways, or U.S. Highways, system is a nationwide integrated network of roads also designated by Congress and administered by the FHWA and AASHTO. While many of the routes in this system have been superseded by the Interstate Highway System, they remain important as direct links between regions not served by the new system, and as alternatives to Interstate travel in the case of heavy traffic or incident.\n\nEach of the fifty states (along with the District of Columbia and some of the United States's overseas territories) has a numbered state highway system. These systems are designated and administered by their respective state legislatures and departments of transportation as statewide networks of important travel links between cities and communities of those states. The roads in these systems, while of lesser national importance, are nevertheless essential for travel within the state.\n\nIn addition to their state highway systems, some states designate county routes which are important for travel within a county. These routes serve important functions in a short-distance capacity.\n\nHighways\n\nA highway is an arterial road.\n\nHighway roads are the backbone of the traffic network. They serve a dual purpose:\n\nto carry traffic over long distances, from one city to another, and\n\nto carry traffic from collector roads to freeways, where applicable.\n\nSeveral systems of numbered highways exist in the United States:\n\nthe Interstate Highway System\n\nthe United States Numbered Highways\n\nvarious State Highway systems\n\nvarious County (or Parish) Highway systems, in some states\n\nWaze's definition of \"highways\" includes Interstate, US and state highways, but it also includes all other roads that are classified as arterial roads under the FHWA functional classification lists maintained by state governments, even though they may not be part of any numbered highway system.\n\nFunctional classification of roads is determined more by how the roads are used than by how they are constructed, and the criteria are slightly different between urban and rural areas. Because of this, some urban roads may be classified as arterials and have highway types in Waze, even though they appear very similar to other non-highway roads. In using functional classification and numbered highway systems, the decision on which roads should be classified as highways rests ultimately with the governments that build and maintain the roads.\n\nWaze distinguishes three classes of highway: Freeway , Major Highway , and Minor Highway .\n\nFreeway\n\nA freeway is a highway designed for high speed traffic, with fully controlled access over entrance to, and exit from, the highway.\n\nFreeway is the highest functional class of road.\n\nThe following roads shall be classified as Freeway :\n\nAll Interstate Highways.\n\nThis includes all roads classified in FHWA's functional classification as Interstates.\n\nThis includes three-digit Interstate spurs and loops (e.g., I-610; I-585).\n\nThis includes the few grade-intersected, undivided, and/or narrow portions of the Interstate Highway System.\n\nThis does not include Interstate Business Loops and Business Spurs (e.g., I-69 Business Loop), unless they meet the standards for Other Freeways and Expressways defined below.\n\nRoads classified in FHWA's functional classification as Other Freeways and Expressways which meet the criteria of a controlled-access highway:\n\nNo at-grade crossings.\n\nNo at-grade intersections.\n\nNo direct property access.\n\nNo stop lights (except sometimes on ramps).\n\nNo stop signs.\n\nExcept at the beginning or end of the controlled-access roadway, connected to other roads exclusively by interchanges:\n\nEntrance via ramps only, typically with acceleration zones.\n\nExit via ramps only, typically with deceleration zones.\n\nNote: Many freeways continue as non-controlled-access roadways; the road should be set as Freeway until the point at which access becomes non-controlled.\n\nNote: Some states refer to this class as Other Freeways. In these states, every road in this class is a Freeway.\n\nFor information on how to best layout freeways and their junctions, please review the section on freeways in the Junction Style Guide. For specific guidelines in other countries refer to this page for more information.\n\nMajor Highway\n\nPrincipal arterials are the primary routes for traveling throughout the country, from one city to another, over long distances. Many principal arterials are freeways or expressways, but many others are not.\n\nAs a nationwide system, the United States Numbered Highways, or U.S. Highways, system provides a direct links between regions not served by the Interstate Highway System, and as alternatives to Interstate travel in the case of heavy traffic or incident.\n\nThe following roads are to be classified, at minimum, as Major Highway :\n\nRoads classified in FHWA's functional classification as Principal Arterials or Other Principal Arterials.\n\nRoads classified in FHWA's functional classifications as Other Freeways and Expressways which do not meet the criteria for Freeway.\n\nThis includes partially-limited-access roadways (or \"expressways\"). These are roads that have a lot of the characteristics of freeways, but also have occasional at-grade intersections with other roads.\n\nNote: Every partially-limited-access roadway is a Major Highway; this does not mean that every Major Highway must be partially-limited-access.\n\nNote: \"Expressway\" is used as a shorthand term for partially-limited-access roads. This does not mean every road named \"Expressway\" is a Major Highway.\n\nNote: Some states refer to this class as Other Freeways. In these states, every road in this class is a Freeway.\n\nRoads in the United States Numbered Highways system (US Highways).\n\nThis includes Alternate (ALT), Bypass (BYP), Connector (CONN), Truck, and Scenic US Highways.\n\nThis does not include Business, Spur, and Loop US Highways.\n\nBusiness routes (Spurs and Loops) in the Interstate Highway System (e.g., I-69 Business Loop).\n\nMinor Highway\n\nMinor arterials (or other arterials) are secondary routes for traveling between cities over moderately long distances. Minor or other arterials are classified in Waze as Minor Highways.\n\nEach of the fifty states (along with the District of Columbia and some of the United States's overseas territories) has a numbered state highway system. Roads in these systems are designated and selected by their respective State Departments of Transportation as part of statewide networks of important travel links between cities and communities of those states. These roads, while of lesser national importance, are nevertheless essential for travel within the state.\n\nThe following roads are to be classified, at minimum, as Minor Highway :\n\nRoads classified in FHWA's functional classification as Minor Arterials or Other Arterials.\n\nSigned, numbered routes in state, D.C., and territorial highway systems.\n\nThis includes Alternate (ALT), Bypass (BYP), Connector (CONN), Truck, and Scenic state highways.\n\nThis includes Spur state highways when they are used to connect state highways with other state highways, US Highways, or Interstates; i.e., Spur highways which are used like Connector (CONN) highways.\n\nThis does not include Business (BUS), Loop, and other Spur state highways.\n\nBusiness (BUS), Loop, and Spur US Highways.\n\nNote: Not every state highway system is the same. Some state systems may be overinclusive, whether because of differing standards or because of political corruption and pork barrel spending; as such, your state may make exceptions where some lesser state highways are better represented by the Primary Street type. Contact your regional coordinator before making these decisions.\n\nRamps\n\nThe following are to be classified as Ramp .\n\nRoads which connect roadways to other roadways as part of an interchange. This includes all freeway exits and entrances.\n\nRoads connecting freeways and highways with Rest areas, parking areas, and service plazas (e.g., \"to Service Area\").\n\nJughandles.\n\nMedian U-turn Intersection (MUTI) and \"Michigan left\" segments.\n\nJ-turn (RCUT/\"Superstreet\") segments.\n\nDisplaced Left Turn (DLT) left turn segments.\n\nThe following are not to be classified as Ramp .\n\nAt-grade connectors, unless they fit into one of the exceptions (see article).\n\nTurn lanes.\n\nRamp names do not appear on the client application map, but do appear in the text for routing directions. Entrance and exit ramps often contain a lot of text which is duplicative of roads already in the area, so this text is suppressed until the user actually needs it. This is also the reason for using the ramp type for named MUTI and jughandle segments—the text is needed for effective navigation instructions but would needlessly clutter the ramp.\n\nInformation on how to lay out ramps and set the proper angles from the main road can be found in the Junction Style Guide.\n\nStreets\n\nThe Street types are for local and short-distance travel. Street types are used at the beginning and end of long routes as well.\n\nPrimary Street\n\nCollectors are roads used with medium-low traffic densities which are used to bring traffic from local streets to arterials and vice versa. Collectors are classified in Waze as Primary Streets.\n\nSome states designate county routes which are important for travel within a county. These routes serve important functions in a short-distance capacity.\n\nThe following roads are to be classified, at minimum, as Primary Street :\n\nRoads classified in FHWA's functional classification as Major Collectors or Minor Collectors and paved with a hard surface.\n\nSigned, numbered county routes (and, in Louisiana, parish routes) paved with a hard surface.\n\nBusiness (BUS) and Loop state highways, and Spur state highways which are not used as connectors, paved with a hard surface.\n\nFrontage roads which serve as the means of access between freeways/expressways and surface streets, if not otherwise classified.\n\nSome functional classification maps are not produced in high enough detail to determine the class of frontage roads. On maps that are produced in high detail, frontage roads are almost universally classified as Major Collectors or higher.\n\nUnpaved roads – including gravel, macadam, and dirt roads – are considered on a regional basis. Check your state page or contact your regional coordinator.\n\nNote: Some states or counties may designate county routes differently than others. Check your state's page for possible exceptions to this rule.\n\nAs stated above, frontage roads should generally be set to at least Primary Street , if not marked as a higher type on a functional class map.\n\nMany frontage roads are used as \"feeder roads\" or \"access roads\", often the primary or only means of entering and exiting a freeway. Setting these to the \"street\" type, as has been done in the past, has the potential to invalidate good routes which use freeways and major/minor highways. To ensure that routing works, always use at least \"primary street\" for frontage roads that are used in this way. It may be desirable to set the entire frontage road to the same type to achieve a more contiguous map appearance.\n\nStreet\n\nAny road for public travel which does not meet the criteria for any other type shall be classified as a Street . Shown as \"local roads\" in some functional classification maps; not shown at all in others.\n\nPassageway\n\nAs of October 31, 2018 ( ) , the road type Passageway should not be used in the USA. This road type is designed for other parts of the world, where some public roads accommodate only vehicles narrower than cars. At this time, DO NOT use the Passageway road type in the USA without explicit champ approval for each instance.\n\nService Road\n\nThe Service Road type is no longer available. Use other road types for service roads.\n\nFor guidance on mapping service roads AKA frontage roads, see the service road page and the section above.\n\nQuick reference chart\n\nRefer to this chart to determine the road type of a given paved public road based on the functional class.\n\nTo use this chart, first determine the functional class of a road, and whether it is a signed, numbered highway in a particular highway system.\n\nWhere the column for the road's highway system and the row for the road's functional class meet, you will find the proper road type for that particular road.\n\nA number of examples are given below the chart.\n\nExceptions\n\nIf a road has a higher or lower type than what's specified in these rules, there may be a reason for it. Special rules are used to determine the road types of roundabouts and at-grade connectors.\n\nRouting road type\n\nApart from changing the nominal road type, level 4 editors can also change the routing road type (also known as routing preference) to one type higher or lower, which only affects long-distance aspects of road type behavior while maintaining the same appearance, best continuation and detour prevention behavior of the nominal road type. These exceptions to the rules should be reviewed with local leadership before implementation.\n\nContinuity\n\nOne common reason for a road to be set to a higher type is for the purpose of maintaining continuity between two roads with higher types. Promotion for continuity is usually indicated by signage: A certain less important road is signed as the way to get between two different more important roads.\n\nFor example, a freeway exit from I-70 is signed as \"Exit 142: US-40 / Gratiot\", indicating that this is the intended way to get to US-40, with Principal Arterial functional class. Between the ramps and US-40 is CR-30 with Local functional class. The rules on this page would normally dictate that this road be set to Primary Street, but in long-distance routing it may be removed from consideration, or pruned. This can be prevented either by assigning the Major Highway type outright or by assigning the Minor Highway type with a +1 routing road type, which would cause it to be treated like a Major Highway for long-distance routing. Use of routing road type is preferable to avoid unintended side effects on the behavior and display of the road.\n\nCertain situations may require continuity upgrades even without signage to support them. Examples include but are not limited to:\n\nSparsely populated areas connected by long roads with lower functional class\n\nPlaces where highway designations end abruptly, such as jurisdictional boundaries\n\nAlternate routes used as detours for main highways subject to frequent or long-term closures\n\nUrban or suburban areas in the midst of redevelopment, where functional class may be out of date\n\nConnecting roads that may be too short to be noticed during state functional class assignment\n\nWhen promoting for continuity, the effective road type of the connecting road should match the lower of the two roads that it connects, similar to type selection for at-grade connectors, up to Major Highway. Since Major Highway is never pruned, there is no need to promote something to Freeway with routing road type for continuity reasons alone, and the nominal Freeway road type should only be used for controlled-access highways that meet the criteria above.\n\nContinuity upgrades prevent Waze from pruning out valid routes, and in extreme cases they can mean the difference between getting a good route and getting no route at all.\n\nUnpaved checkbox\n\nThe checkbox is an attribute that can be applied to any road type. It indicates that a road is not paved with asphalt or concrete. The unpaved attribute affects routing over drivable road types; it does not really affect non-drivable road types, since the client does not use them for routing. Based on user preference, destination, and other settings options, the Waze client may avoid routing them over otherwise drivable segments when the 'unpaved' attribute is checked.\n\nWhen to select the Unpaved attribute\n\nAny drivable road which is not paved with asphalt or concrete should have the Unpaved attribute box checked.\n\nCheck your state's page for details on whether there are additional guidelines for roads that are in uncommonly poor condition by local standards or contact your Regional Coordinator for further guidance.\n\nUser setting options for the Unpaved attribute\n\nThis attribute has the unique property in that Waze users may select when not to be routed over unpaved road segments. Users may choose:\n\n'Dirt roads - Don't allow' - Avoids through-routing on all unpaved roads\n\n'Dirt roads - Avoid long ones' - Avoids through-routing on long unpaved roads\n\n'Dirt roads - Allow' - Allows through-routing that could include unpaved road(s) (i.e. ignores whether roads have the unpaved attribute checked)"
