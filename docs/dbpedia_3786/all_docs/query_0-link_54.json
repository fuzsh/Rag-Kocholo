        "text": "The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to anthropogenic U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990–2022 (the national inventory that the U.S. prepares annually under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), transportation accounted for the largest portion (28%) of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2022. Cars, trucks, commercial aircraft, and railroads, among other sources, all contribute to transportation end-use sector emissions.\n\n2022 U.S. GHG Emissions by Sector\n\n2022 U.S. Transportation Sector GHG Emissions by Source\n\nNote: Totals may not add to 100% due to rounding. Transportation emissions do not include emissions from non-transportation mobile sources such as agriculture and construction equipment. “Other” sources include buses, motorcycles, pipelines and lubricants.\n\nFor more information on U.S. GHG Emissions from Transportation and what the numbers in these pie charts represent, please see: Fast Facts: U.S. Transportation Sector GHG Emissions 1990 - 2022 (pdf) (328 KB, May 2024, EPA-420-F-24-022)\n\nPrevious versions of Fast Facts\n\nLearn More\n\nGHG Emissions from a Typical Passenger Vehicle"
