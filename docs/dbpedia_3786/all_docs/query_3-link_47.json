        "text": "Chapter 4\n\nChapter 4: Signals, Signs and Pavement Markings\n\nTraffic Control Signals\n\nTraffic signals are placed at intersections to keep traffic moving and avoid accidents. Drivers, pedestrians, and bicycle riders must obey these signals except when an officer is directing traffic. Stop on the stop line if your car is nearest the signal. Some signals change only when a car is at the stop line. If traffic signals are out of order, stop as you would for a four-way stop sign.\n\nRED\n\nCome to a complete stop at the marked stop line or before moving into the crosswalk or intersection. After stopping, you may turn right on red at most intersections if the way is clear. Some intersections display a \"NO TURN ON RED\" sign, which you must obey. Left turns on red from a one-way street into a one-way street are also allowed.\n\nYELLOW\n\nStop if you can. The light will soon be red.\n\nGREEN\n\nGo — but only if the intersection is clear. Yield to pedestrians and vehicles still in the intersection. If turning left, wait for gap in oncoming traffic to complete turn.\n\nRED ARROW\n\nCome to a complete stop at the marked stop line or before moving into the crosswalk or intersection. After stopping, you may turn right on red arrow at most intersections if the way is clear. Some intersections display a \"NO TURN ON RED\" sign, which you must obey. Left turns on red arrow from a one-way street into a one-way street are also allowed.\n\nYELLOW ARROW\n\nStop if you can. The light will soon be red. The yellow arrow means the same as the yellow light, but applies only to movement in the direction of the arrow.\n\nGREEN ARROW\n\nA green arrow, pointing right or left, means you may make a turn in the direction of the arrow. If the red light is burning at the same time, you must be in the proper lane for such a turn, and you must yield the right-of-way to vehicles and pedestrians within the intersection.\n\nFLASHING SIGNALS\n\nA flashing red light means the same thing as a stop sign. It is used at dangerous intersections.\n\nA flashing yellow light means you may move forward with caution. It is used at or just before dangerous intersections, or to alert you to a warning sign such as a school crossing or sharp curve.\n\nLANE SIGNALS\n\nLane signals are used:\n\nWhen the direction of the flow of traffic changes during the day.\n\nTo show that a toll booth is open or closed.\n\nTo show which lanes are opened or closed.\n\nYou must never drive in a lane under a red X. A yellow X means that your lane signal is going to change to red. Prepare to leave the lane safely. You may drive in lanes beneath the green arrow, but you must also obey all other signs and signals.\n\nTraffic signs — Standard Shapes and Colors\n\nThere are eight shapes and eight colors of traffic signs. Each shape and each color has an exact meaning, so you must acquaint yourself with all of them.\n\nGREEN: Guide, directional information.\n\nRED: Stop, do not enter or wrong way.\n\nBLUE: Motorist services guidance. Also used to identify parking spaces for disabled drivers.\n\nORANGE: Construction and maintenance.\n\nBROWN: Public recreation areas and scenic guidance.\n\nYELLOW: General warning.\n\nWHITE: Regulatory.\n\nBLACK: Regulatory.\n\nThe shape of a road sign can tell you as much about the sign's message as its color.\n\nOCTAGON: Exclusively for stop signs.\n\nHORIZONTAL RECTANGLE: Generally for guide signs.\n\nTRIANGLE: Exclusively for yield signs.\n\nPENNANT: Advance warning of no passing zones.\n\nDIAMOND: Exclusively to warn of existing or possible hazards on roadways or adjacent areas.\n\nVERTICAL RECTANGLE: Generally for regulatory signs.\n\nPENTAGON: School advance and school crossing signs.\n\nROUND: railroad advance warning signs.\n\nCROSSBUCK: Railroad crossing.\n\nOctagon: Stop\n\nStop signs are always octagonal (8 sided). A stop sign means that you must bring your vehicle to a complete halt at the marked stop line.\n\nIf there is no marked stop line, stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection. If there is no crosswalk, stop at a point nearest the intersecting roadway where you have a clear view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.\n\nA four-way stop sign means that there are four stop signs at this intersection. Traffic from all four directions must stop. The first vehicle to reach the intersection should move forward first. If two vehicles reach the intersection at the same time, the driver on the left yields to the driver on the right.\n\nTriangle: Yield\n\nSlow down and give vehicles crossing your path the right-of-way. If the way is clear, you may move forward slowly without stopping. Yield signs are usually placed where auxiliary roads lead into major roads.\n\nPennant: No Passing\n\nYou are entering a no passing zone. This sign is placed on the left side of the road, facing the driver.\n\nDiamond: Warning\n\nNarrow bridge. These signs warn you of special conditions or dangers ahead. Words or symbols on the sign will show why you need to use caution. See pages 58-60 for typical warning signs.\n\nPentagon: School Sign:\n\nThis five-sided sign means you are near a school. Watch for children.\n\nSchool Crossing\n\nAs you approach this sign, slow down, watch for children crossing the road. Stop if necessary. Obey signals from any crossing guards.\n\nChildren Crossing\n\nSlow to posted speed. Watch for children!\n\nWarning Signs\n\nHere are some common warning signs. These signs give you advance notice of possible hazards ahead. Drive with caution.\n\nSLIPPERY WHEN WET. In wet weather, drive slowly. Do not speed up or brake quickly. Make sharp turns at a very slow speed.\n\nDIVIDED HIGHWAY AHEAD. The highway ahead is divided into two one-way roadways. Keep to the right.\n\nDIVIDED HIGHWAY ENDS. The divided highway on which you are traveling ends 350 to 500 feet ahead. You will then be on a roadway with two-way traffic. Keep to the right.\n\nLOW CLEARANCE. Do not enter if your vehicle is taller than the height listed on the sign.\n\nBICYCLE CROSSING. Warns you in advance that a bikeway crosses the roadway ahead.\n\nMERGING TRAFFIC. You are coming to a point where another traffic lane joins the one you are on. Watch for other traffic and be ready to yield the right-of-way when necessary.\n\nPEDESTRIAN CROSSING. Watch for people crossing the street. Slow down or stop if necessary.\n\nNARROW BRIDGE. The bridge is wide enough to accommodate two lanes of traffic, but with very little clearance.\n\nDIP. There is a low place in the road. Go slowly and be ready to stop if the dip is filled with water.\n\nSOFT SHOULDER. The dirt on the side of the road is soft. Don't leave the pavement except in an emergency.\n\nONE LANE BRIDGE. The bridge is wide enough for only one vehicle at a time. Make sure the bridge is clear of oncoming traffic before you cross.\n\nPAVEMENT ENDS. Road surface ahead changes from a hard surfaced pavement to a low-type surface or earth road.\n\nRIGHT CURVE. Slow your speed and keep well to the left. The road will curve to the right.\n\nDOUBLE CURVE. The road will curve to the right, then to the left. Slow your speed, keep to the right, and do not pass.\n\nWINDING ROAD. There are several curves ahead. Drive slowly and carefully.\n\nTRUCK CROSSING. Watch for trucks entering or crossing the highway.\n\nCROSS ROAD. A road crosses the main highway ahead. Look to the left and right for other traffic.\n\nSIDE ROAD. Another road enters the highway from the direction shown. Watch for traffic from that direction.\n\nSHARP RIGHT TURN. The road will make a sharp turn to the right. Slow your speed, keep to the right, and do not pass other vehicles.\n\nREDUCTION OF LANES. There will be fewer lanes ahead. Traffic must merge left. Drivers in the left lane should allow others to merge smoothly. Right lane ends.\n\nADVISORY SPEED SIGN. The highest safe speed you should travel around the curve ahead is 25 miles per hour. Advisory speed signs may be used with any diamond-shaped warning sign.\n\nHILL/DOWNGRADE. Slow down and be ready to shift to lower gear to control speed and save brakes.\n\nYIELD AHEAD. Warning of yield sign ahead. Slow down and be prepared to stop at yield sign or adjust speed to traffic.\n\nTRAFFIC SIGNAL AHEAD. Warning of traffic signals at intersection ahead. Slow down, poor visibility is likely.\n\nSTOP SIGN AHEAD. When you come to this sign, slow down to be ready to stop at the stop sign check.\n\nTWO-WAY TRAFFIC AHEAD. The one-way street or roadway ahead ends. You will then be facing oncoming traffic.\n\nRectangle: Regulatory or Information\n\nThese signs tell you the law, so you must follow their instructions.\n\nRemember that a red circle with a slash means NO. The sign shows you what is not allowed.\n\nNO U-TURN. — You cannot make a complete turn to go in the opposite direction where this sign is displayed. No U-turn.\n\nYou must not make a right turn at this intersection.\n\n50 miles per hour is the highest safest speed you can travel in this area.\n\nYou cannot go straight ahead. You must turn either to the right or left.\n\nYou are going the wrong way on an expressway exit ramp. Do not drive past this sign. Turn around immediately.\n\nA divided highway is ahead. Stay on the right side of the divider.\n\nParking only for vehicles displaying an official permit and transporting a disabled person.\n\nYou may travel only in the direction of the arrow.\n\nThis sign lists the maximum recommended safe speed for an entrance or exit on an expressway. Slow down to whatever speed is shown.\n\nYou may not turn right or left during the red light. You must wait for the signal to turn green.\n\nA diamond-shaped marking shows that a lane is reserved for certain purposes or certain vehicles. The lanes are usually reserved for buses or car-pool vehicles during rush hour traffic. Other diamond signs are used to designate bicycle lanes.\n\nThe center lane is shared for left turns in both directions of travel.\n\nYou must not pass any other vehicles going in the same direction as you are, while you are in this area.\n\nWhen you have passed this sign, you are again permitted to pass other vehicles with care.\n\nTraffic in left lane must turn left at the intersection ahead.\n\nStopping permitted only for emergencies.\n\nYou are approaching an area where a reduced speed zone has been established.\n\nAt the intersection ahead traffic in left lane must turn left and traffic in adjoining lane may turn left or continue straight ahead.\n\nThis sign is used on multiple lane highways to advise slower driving traffic to stay in the right hand lane; and also to do so when approached from behind by other traffic even if you are doing the speed limit.\n\nThis marks a one-way roadway with traffic coming toward you. You must not enter the one-way roadway at this point.\n\nYou must not turn either to the right or to the left at this intersection.\n\nIf you park, you must always park off the pavement of the highway.\n\nWhen entering a right turn lane motorists will conflict with bicycle through movements. Always yield.\n\nANIMAL CROSSING. The animal pictured on the sign is common in this area: watch for this species crossing the road particularly during twilight and nighttime hours.\n\nRailroad Crossing Signs and Signals\n\nThere are several signs, signals and pavement markings that indicate highway railroad crossings. When you see one of them, slow down and be ready to stop.\n\nREMEMBER:\n\nTrains cannot stop quickly. An average freight train traveling at 30 MPH needs a stopping distance of more than half a mile. Longer trains moving at faster speeds can take one and a half miles or more to stop.\n\nAny pedestrian or person driving a vehicle and approaching a railroad highway grade crossing must stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the the railroad when the electrical or mechanical warning devices are flashing, the crossing gate is lowered, a human flagger is warning of an approaching train, or an approaching train is clearly visible and is in close proximity to the railroad highway grade crossing. Do not proceed until you can do so safely.\n\nPAVEMENT MARKING\n\nPavement markings, consisting of an RXR followed by a stop line closer to the tracks, may be painted on the paved approach to a crossing. Any person walking or driving a vehicle must stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet of the crossing. Stay behind the stop line while waiting for a train to pass.\n\nADVANCE WARNING SIGN\n\nThe advance warning sign is usually the first sign you see when approaching a highway-rail intersection. The advance warning sign advises you to slow down, look, and listen for a train, and be prepared to stop if a train is approaching.\n\nCROSSBUCK SIGN\n\nCrossbuck signs are found at highway-rail intersections. They are yield signs. You are legally required to yield the right of way to trains. Slow down, look and listen for a train, and stop if a train approaches. When the road crosses over more than one set of tracks, a sign below the crossbuck will indicate the number of tracks.\n\nFLASHING RED LIGHT SIGNALS\n\nAt many highway-rail crossings, the crossbuck has flashing red lights and bells. When the lights begin to flash, stop! A train is approaching. DO NOT STOP ON THE TRACKS OR WITHIN SIX FEET OF EITHER RAIL. Do not move forward until you can do so safely. If there is more than one track, make sure all tracks are clear before crossing. In heavy traffic make sure there is room for your vehicle on the other side before starting to cross.\n\nGATES\n\nMany crossings have gates with flashing red lights and bells. Stop when the lights begin to flash, and before the gate lowers across your side of the road. Do not move forward until the gates are raised and the lights stop flashing as there may be a train approaching on an adjacent track.\n\nAlways approach highway-railroad crossings at a reasonable speed — and be prepared to stop if you have to. Be especially alert when you are following buses or trucks which may have to stop at highway-railroad crossings even if any gates are up and the warning lights are not flashing.\n\nIf your car stalls on the tracks don't hesitate. Get yourself and your passengers out and away from the car immediately. If a collision is imminent, the safest direction is toward the train but stay off the tracks. That way you will be least likely to be hit by your vehicle or any debris from the collision.\n\nConstruction and Maintenance Traffic Control Signs\n\nVarious traffic control devices are used in road construction and maintenance work areas to direct drivers and pedestrians safely through the work site and to provide for the safety of highway workers.\n\nBe prepared to reduce your speed and use caution when directed to do so by a sign, flagger and/or police officer.\n\nConstruction and maintenance signs are used to notify drivers of unusual or potentially dangerous conditions in or near work areas. Most signs used in highway and street work areas are diamond shaped.\n\nChanneling Devices\n\nBarricades, vertical panels, drums, and cones are the most commonly used devices to alert drivers of unusual or potentially dangerous conditions in highway and street work zones. These devices are used to guide the drivers safely through the work area, and at night, they may be equipped with warning lights. When a Road Closed sign is displayed, do not drive on this road. Look for a detour or another route.\n\nStripes on barricades and panel devices slope downward in the direction traffic must travel.\n\nFlashing Arrow Panels\n\nFlashing arrow panels are used both during the day and at night to give advance warning and directional information to drivers where it is necessary to move to the right or to the left into another lane.\n\nA horizontal flashing bar indicates a warning — use caution approaching the work area.\n\nFlaggers\n\nFlaggers are often provided in highway and street work zones to stop, slow, or guide traffic safely through the area.\n\nFlaggers wear orange vests or jackets and use red flags or stop/slow panels to direct traffic through work zones.\n\nSpecial Signs\n\nSLOW MOVING VEHICLE\n\nVehicles going less than 25 miles per hour (such as farm equipment) must display this sign on the rear when using public highways.\n\nGREEN GUIDE SIGNS\n\nGreen and white signs give information about directions and distances. Guide signs on expressways show you which lanes to use to get where you want to go.\n\nRoutes that run generally East-West have even numbers and those running North-South have odd numbers.\n\nBLUE SERVICE SIGNS\n\nBlue and white signs direct you to services, such as gas, food, motels and hospitals. Brown and white signs point out scenic areas and parks.\n\nPavement Markings\n\nLines, symbols and words are often painted on a roadway to help direct drivers and control traffic flow. You must know what the different lines and colors mean and obey them as you would traffic signs or signals.\n\nWhite and yellow lines are used along pavement edges and between lanes to keep vehicles in line. These lines may be solid or broken (long dashes), single or double.\n\nUnless you are turning, exiting a highway, or changing lanes, always stay between the lines marking your lane.\n\nYellow Lane Lines\n\nYellow lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. Single yellow lines may also mark the left edge of the pavement on divided highways and one-way streets.\n\nA Broken Yellow Line\n\nA broken yellow line separates lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions. Stay to the right of the line unless you are passing a vehicle in front of you. When passing, you may cross this line temporarily when it is safe to do so.\n\nDouble Yellow Lines: One Solid, One Broken.\n\nA solid yellow line to the right of a broken yellow center line means passing or crossing is prohibited in that lane, except when turning left. If the broken line is closer to you, then you can the broken line only to pass another vehicle and only when it is safe to do so.\n\nDouble Solid Yellow Lines\n\nDouble, solid yellow lines prohibit vehicles moving in either direction from crossing the lines. You may not cross these lines unless turning left when it is safe to do so.\n\nWhite Lane Lines\n\nWhite lane lines separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. Single white lines may also mark the right edge of the pavement.\n\nBroken White Line\n\nBroken white lines separate lines of traffic going in the same direction. They may be crossed with care.\n\nSolid White Line\n\nA solid white line marks the edge of the roadway or separates lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. You may travel in the same direction on both sides of this line, but you should not cross the line unless you must do so to avoid a hazard.\n\nDouble Solid White Line\n\nDouble solid white lines indicate that changing lanes is not allowed.\n\nSolid with Turn Lane Arrow\n\nSolid white lines are used for turn lanes and to discourage lane changes near intersections. Arrows are often used with the white lines to show which turn may be made from the lane.\n\nIf you are in a lane marked with a curved arrow and the word ONLY, you must turn in the direction of the arrow. If your lane is marked with both a curved and straight arrow, you may either turn or go straight.\n\nReversible Lanes\n\nSome highways have reversible traffic lanes to help handle rush-hour traffic. The direction of traffic is normally reversed at set times each day. These pavement markings are used along with special lane signals and other signs and symbols.\n\nA solid white line marks the edge of the pavement on most roads. Stop lines, crosswalks and parking spaces are also marked by white lines. Symbols such as arrows are in white also. A single yellow line marks the left edge of all divided or one-way roadways. Curbs are often marked yellow in no-parking zones near fire hydrants or intersections.\n\nIt is unlawful to park in or drive through areas that have pavement markings indicating fire lanes or safety zones.\n\nThe lane marking arrow, in the center lane in the diagram below, indicates that traffic in this lane can be reversed in accordance with local traffic controls due to \"rush hour\" traffic or other special traffic conditions.\n\nTwo-Way Roadway with Center Lane\n\nTwo-way roadway with a center lane for left turns in either direction of travel. The specially marked center turn lane is intended for slowing down and for sheltering of turning vehicles and may not be used for passing."
