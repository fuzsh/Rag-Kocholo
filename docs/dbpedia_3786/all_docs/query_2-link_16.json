Every side of the device needs to have your company’s name and a 24-hour telephone number to reach the device’s owner. The print needs to be big enough to read from a distance.\n\nSeven days before you set up the device, you need to put together a list that contains:\n\nthe locations and color of the devices\n\na sample of the print size and type on each device, and\n\nany other useful information to help identify the devices.\n\nGive us your information\n\nBring that list to the Transportation Department in Room 721 and the Public Works Department in Room 714 at Boston City Hall:\n\n1 City Hall Square\n\nBoston MA 02201\n\nOffice hours: Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\n\nIf you change your devices or move them around, you need to let both departments know. If you have any questions about the program, call the Transportation Department at 617-635-4680."
