        "text": "The ‘open’ category is the main reference for the majority of leisure drone activities and low-risk commercial activities.\n\nAs a drone operator, remember to check if you need to register yourself. See the registration FAQ.\n\nThe ‘open’ category is in turn subdivided in three sub-categories – A1, A2, A3 -- which may be summarised as follows:\n\nA1: fly over people but not over assemblies of people\n\nA2: fly close to people\n\nA3: fly far from people\n\nEach subcategory comes with its own set of requirements. Therefore, in the ‘open’ category, it is important to identify the subcategory of operation your activities will fall under, to determine which rules apply to you, and the type of training the remote pilot needs to undertake. See the FaQ ‘Which training I need to fly my drone in the open category’\n\nStart by identifying the type of drone you own.\n\nTable for ‘Open’ category applicable since 1 January 2024\n\nDrones with a class identification label (i.e. , , , , , , ) are already available on the market. Please see the list below of drones that received the class identification label. If you want to purchase a drone with class identification, please check that the drone shows on its body the class identification and make sure that the drone has an EU Declaration of Conformity. Several versions of the same drone may be available, with and without class mark. You can find additional information on drones with a class identification label in the Drones Information Notices webpage.\n\nOperations in the open category must be conducted with a drone:\n\nbearing a C0 to C4 class identification label, or;\n\nbeing privately built (built for your own use), or;\n\neven without class identification label, but only if placed on the market before 31 December 2023.\n\nDrones bearing a class identification label can be already utilised in accordance with the conditions shown in the menus below. Be aware that ‘privately built’ means that you built the drone for your own personal use, so it was not purchased; it does not refer to UASs assembled from sets of parts placed on the market as a single, ready-to-assemble kit.\n\nHow to operate drones in the open category\n\nPrivately built and drones placed on the market before 01/01/2024 (under 250 g)\n\nSubcategory A1 (can also fly in subcategory A3) Operational restrictions\n\nMay fly over uninvolved people (should be avoided when possible)\n\nNo flight over assemblies of people\n\nDrone operator registration No, unless camera / sensor on board and a drone is not a toy Remote pilot competence No training required Remote pilot minimum age No minimum age\n\nC0 (under 250 g)\n\nSubcategory A1 (can also fly in subcategory A3) Operational restrictions\n\nNo flight over assemblies of people;\n\nMaintain flight altitude below 120m above ground level.\n\nDrone operator registration No, unless camera / sensor on board and a drone is not a toy Remote pilot competence Read carefully the user manual Remote pilot minimum age 16*, no minimum age if drone is a toy\n\nC1 (under 900 g)\n\nSubcategory A1 (can also fly in subcategory A3) Operational restrictions\n\nNo flight expected over uninvolved people (if it happens, overflight should be minimised);\n\nNo flight over assemblies of people;\n\nMaintain flight altitude below 120m above ground level.\n\nDrone operator registration Yes Remote pilot competence\n\nRead carefully the user manual\n\nObtain a ‘Proof of completion for online training’ for A1/A3 ‘open’ subcategory by:\n\nCompleting the online training\n\nPassing the online theoretical exam\n\nRemote pilot minimum age 16*\n\nC2 (under 4 kg)\n\nSubcategory A2 (can also fly in subcategory A3) Operational restrictions\n\nMust not overfly uninvolved people;\n\nMaintain a horizontal distance of 30 m from uninvolved people (can be reduced to 5 m if the low-speed function is activated);\n\nMaintain flight altitude below 120m above ground level.\n\nDrone operator registration Yes Remote pilot competence\n\nRead carefully the user manual\n\nObtain a ’Remote pilot certificate of competency’ for A2 ‘open’ subcategory by:\n\nHaving a ‘Proof of completion for online training’ for A1/A3 ‘open’ subcategory\n\nConducting and declare a practical self- training\n\nPassing an additional theoretical exam at the NAA or proctored online\n\nRemote pilot minimum age 16*\n\nC3 (under 25 kg)\n\nSubcategory A3 Operational restrictions\n\nMust not overfly uninvolved people;\n\nMaintain a horizontal distance of 150 m from uninvolved people and urban areas;\n\nMaintain flight altitude below 120m above ground level.\n\nDrone operator registration Yes Remote pilot competence\n\nRead carefully the user manual\n\nObtain a ‘Proof of completion for online training’ for A1/A3 ‘open’ subcategory by:\n\nCompleting the online training\n\nPassing the online theoretical exam\n\nRemote pilot minimum age 16*\n\nC4 (under 25 kg)\n\nSubcategory A3 Operational restrictions\n\nMust not overfly uninvolved people;\n\nMaintain a horizontal distance of 150 m from uninvolved people and urban areas;\n\nMaintain flight altitude below 120m above ground level.\n\nDrone operator registration Yes Remote pilot competence\n\nRead carefully the user manual\n\nObtain a ‘Proof of completion for online training’ for A1/A3 ‘open’ subcategory by:\n\nCompleting the online training\n\nPassing the online theoretical exam\n\nRemote pilot minimum age 16*\n\nPrivately built and drones placed on the market before 01/01/2024 (under 25 kg)\n\nSubcategory A3 Operational restrictions\n\nMust not overfly uninvolved people;\n\nMaintain a horizontal distance of 150 m from uninvolved people and urban areas;\n\nMaintain flight altitude below 120m above ground level.\n\nDrone operator registration Yes Remote pilot competence\n\nRead carefully the user manual\n\nObtain a ‘Proof of completion for online training’ for A1/A3 ‘open’ subcategory by:\n\nCompleting the online training\n\nPassing the online theoretical exam\n\nRemote pilot minimum age 16*\n\n‘Open’ category using drones with a class identification label\n\n* A State may lower the remote pilot minimum age to 12. In that case, the lowered age limit will apply only in that State.\n\nYou are invited to consult the Provisions applicable to both ‘open’ and ‘specific’ category FAQs as well as Understanding the ‘open’ category FAQs for more details. These FAQs take you through all the steps you need to take to be fully compliant and help you identify the regulations that are applicable to the drone operations you intend to conduct.\n\nFor all our amateur drone pilots, Paul and his new drone Donnie will help you see how easy it is to become a safe and responsible drone pilot.\n\nRemote identification\n\nAll drones operating in the open category (with limited exceptions) need to be equipped with a remote identification system. Some companies have already placed on the market modules providing a direct remote identification system, providing the ‘EU Declaration of Conformity’ and you can find a list below. Please be aware that EASA did not verify the compliance of such components and the declaration of conformity is submitted under the sole responsibility of the manufacturer.\n\nEU Declaration of Conformity list"
