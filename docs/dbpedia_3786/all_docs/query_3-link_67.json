        "text": "WSF operates 20 terminals throughout Puget Sound, the San Juan Islands and Sidney, B.C. For each terminal the following information is available: terminal address with aerial photo, street map and directions, Ferry Cams, amenities, parking and ADA information.\n\nTerminal Status\n\nFor some terminals, we provide an estimate of available drive-up spaces on the vessel for upcoming sailing departures. This information is intended to help customers make more informed travel decisions.\n\nThe estimated remaining drive-up spaces is calculated by subtracting the number of vehicles that have been processed through the tollbooth from the vessel capacity of the upcoming sailing. We estimate the size of each vehicle that is processed through the tollbooth based on the vehicle fare purchased or redeemed. That is why this information is an estimate only. For reservation routes, we also subtract the number of vehicle reservations that have been made for that sailing. In addition, for multi-destination routes, we calculate the estimated drive-up spaces based on destinations.\n\nFor Orcas Island and Friday Harbor, the estimated drive-up spaces is based on the number of vehicle reservations made for that sailing. We are unable to calculate the estimated drive-up spaces based on the number of vehicles at the terminal in real time due to vehicles not purchasing a fare for their travel."
