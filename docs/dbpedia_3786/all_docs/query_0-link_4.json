        "text": "Roadside Inspection\n\nOur Safety Objective\n\nThe primary objective of the New York State Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) is to promote highway safety and reduce commercial vehicle related crashes and hazardous materials incidents by removing unsafe trucks, unsafe loads, and unqualified drivers from the highways. Safe trucks and competent drivers are cost-effective investments that reduce operating and accident costs. It's good business!\n\nSafety Inspections Are Conducted By NYSDOT & The New York State Police At Roadside Sites\n\nThe New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) is the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) lead agency. The New York State Police is the primary participating police agency. A number of local police agencies also participate on a periodic basis.\n\nWhen a vehicle has been selected for a safety inspection, the driver must help by staying behind the wheel and following the inspector's instructions. Inspectors will follow an inspection procedure established by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) to inspect the driver and vehicle. These procedures are used throughout North America. Please follow the instructions of the inspector so that no unnecessary delays will be experienced. After the inspection, the inspector will explain the defects, if any, and provide the driver with a copy of the safety inspection report.\n\nWhat Happens If Defects Are Found?\n\nIf defects are discovered, one or more of the following things will happen:\n\nIf serious defects are discovered, the vehicle will be placed out-of-service and the repairs must be made before the vehicle can be driven again. If a vehicle that has been placed out-of-service is operated before the necessary repairs have been made, a penalty of $1,000 - $5,000 may be assessed.\n\nAll non out-of-service violations must be repaired prior to the vehicle being re-dispatched. Within 15 days after the inspection, the carrier must go to www.dot.ny.gov/modal/truck and click “CERTIFY ROADSIDE INSPECTION REPORT” to certify with NYS Department of Transportation that violations were resolved.\n\nA driver in violation of some requirements regarding hours of service (such as not having a log book when required, or exceeding the driving time limitations) may be placed out-of-service and assessed a penalty.\n\nAdditional penalties of up to $500 may be assessed for each hazardous materials violation.\n\nA Uniform Traffic Citation may be issued for some violations.\n\nWhat the Inspectors Will Look For?\n\nRepair and Maintenance\n\nEvery motor carrier, its officers, drivers, agents, representatives, and employees directly concerned with inspection or maintenance of commercial motor vehicles must comply and be conversant with these rules.\n\nGeneral requirements\n\nEvery carrier shall systematically inspect, repair, and maintain all commercial motor vehicles under its control. (Systematic means a regular or scheduled program to keep vehicles in a safe operating condition.)\n\nMaintenance Files\n\nMotor carriers must maintain the following information for every vehicle they have controlled for 30 days or more:\n\nThese records must be retained for one year at the location where the vehicle is garaged, and maintained for six months after the vehicle leaves the carrier's control (via sale, trade-in, or scrap).\n\nView a sample Maintenance Record here .\n\nRoadside Inspection Reports\n\nAny driver who receives a roadside inspection report must deliver it to the motor carrier.\n\nCertification of Roadside Inspection Reports\n\nAn official of the motor carrier is to examine the roadside inspection report and ensure that any violations or defects noted on the report are corrected prior to next dispatch. Within 15 days after the inspection, the carrier must go to www.dot.ny.gov/modal/truck and click “CERTIFY ROADSIDE INSPECTION REPORT” to certify with NYS Department of Transportation that violations were resolved.\n\nPost-Trip Inspection Report\n\nEvery carrier must require its drivers to prepare a daily written post-trip inspection report at the end of each driving day. (If the motor carrier only operates one commercial motor vehicle, the report is not required.) Every driver is responsible for preparing such a report for each vehicle driven. This report must cover at least the following parts and accessories:\n\nThe report must list any condition that the driver either found or had reported to him/her that would affect safety of operation or cause a breakdown. If no defect or deficiency is reported or found, the report should state this. The driver must sign the report in all cases. Before dispatching the vehicle again, a carrier shall ensure that a certification has been made as to any defect or deficiency, that they have been corrected, or state those deficiencies that do not require immediate correction. Carriers must keep the original post-trip inspection report and the certification of repairs for at least three months from the date of preparation.\n\nView a sample Driver Vehicle Inspection Report here .\n\nBefore starting out, the driver must be satisfied that the motor vehicle is in safe operating condition. If the last vehicle inspection report notes any deficiencies, the driver must review and sign to acknowledge that necessary repairs have been completed.\n\nPeriodic Inspection\n\nEvery commercial vehicle, including each segment of a combination vehicle requires periodic inspection that must be performed at least once every 12 months. At a minimum, inspections must include all items enumerated in the Minimum Periodic Inspection Standards, Appendix G to Subchapter B . The New York State Heavy Duty Vehicle Inspection fulfills the annual inspection requirements. Carriers may perform required annual inspections themselves; however, if the vehicle is registered in New York, the vehicle must have a New York State Inspection. The original or a copy of the periodic inspection report must be retained by the motor carrier for 14 months from the report date.\n\nDocumentation of Inspection\n\nDocumentation (report, sticker, or decal) of the most recent periodic inspection must be kept on the vehicle.\n\nInspector Qualification\n\nMotor carriers must ensure that persons performing annual inspections are qualified. Inspectors must:\n\nBrake Inspector Qualification\n\nThe motor carrier is responsible for ensuring that all inspections, maintenance, repairs, and service to brakes of commercial motor vehicles comply with these regulations. The carrier must ensure that the employees responsible for brake inspection, maintenance, service, or repairs meet minimum brake inspector qualifications.\n\nBrake Inspection\n\nBrake Inspector Qualification\n\nThe motor carrier is responsible for ensuring that all inspections, maintenance, repairs, and service to brakes of commercial motor vehicles comply with these regulations. The carrier must ensure that the employees responsible for brake inspection, maintenance, service, or repairs meet minimum brake inspector qualifications.\n\nQualifications for Brake Inspectors\n\nThe brake inspector must:\n\nMaintaining evidence of brake inspector qualifications\n\nMotor carriers must maintain evidence of brake inspector qualification at the principal place of business or the location where the inspector works. Evidence must be retained for the period during which the brake inspector is employed in that capacity, and for one year thereafter.\n\nView a sample vehicle/brake inspector certification form here .\n\nRear Object Detection Devices\n\nNew York State Law requires all \"cube style\" box trucks or motor vehicles with enclosed walk-in delivery bays registered in this state in which the cargo box or delivery bay's length is between 8 feet 6 inches and 18 feet are required to be equipped with a cross-view back up mirror system, rear video system, or a rear object detection device.\n\nCross-view mirror system- must allow the driver to view a minimum distance of 6 feet to the rear of the vehicle and encompass the entire width of the vehicle.\n\nRear video system- refers to a video monitor mounted inside the cab. This monitor must allow the driver to view a minimum distance of 6 feet to the rear of the vehicle and encompass the entire width of the vehicle.\n\nRear object detection system- refers to a device that will alert the driver by means of a visual or audible warning indicator inside of the cab if a person or object is within a minimum distance of 6 feet to the rear and must encompass the entire width of the vehicle.\n\nFor more information and/or clarificataion visit New York State Legislature Website .(Once connected to the website click on \"Laws\" then scroll down and click on TRA for the Transportation Law - VAT for the Vehicle and Traffic Law\n\nHeavy Duty Diesel Emission Testing\n\nThe Diesel emission inspection programs for New York State are administered by the Department of Environmental Conservation .\n\nDEC has two emission inspection programs for Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicles (HDDVs):\n\nAn annual emission inspection program for HDDVs registered in the New York City Metropolitan Area (New York City, Long Island, Westchester and Rockland Counties)\n\nA roadside emission inspection program for HDDVs operating on New York State roadways\n\nHDDV emission inspections are authorized by NYSDEC Subpart 217-5 regulation, \"Heavy Duty Inspection and Maintenance Program.\"\n\nHDDVs are defined as diesel engine powered vehicles with a GVWR exceeding 8,500 pounds. Some vehicles in this weight class are exempt including authorized emergency vehicles, agricultural trucks and farm vehicles, off-road construction vehicles and military vehicles. Both the annual and the roadside emission inspections conducted by a certified inspector can include a visual inspection to verify that the vehicle's emissions control equipment is functioning, a check for tampering and an opacity (smoke) test using an approved opacity meter."
