        "text": "accident\n\nevent\n\naccident, unexpected event, typically sudden in nature and associated with injury, loss, or harm. Accidents are a common feature of the human experience and result in injury or permanent disability to large numbers of people worldwide every year. Many accidents also involve damage to or loss of property. Accidents can occur anywhere, including in the home, during transportation, in the hospital, on the sports field, or in the workplace. With appropriate safety precautions and awareness of one’s actions and environment, many accidents can be avoided or prevented.\n\nMotor vehicle accidents\n\nWorldwide, motor vehicle accidents are a major cause of death, and, despite improvements in automobile safety, projections have indicated that deaths from traffic crashes will increase significantly by 2030 because of increased motor vehicle ownership. Examples of causes of traffic accidents include speeding, drunk driving, distracted driving, and inexperienced driving. Although seat belts can save lives, millions of people fail to use them. Likewise, helmets are an effective means of protecting motorcyclists from traumatic brain injury and death, yet many riders choose not to wear a helmet.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nchildhood disease and disorder: Accidents\n\nMotor vehicle accidents result in a wide range of injuries and often in permanent disability. In an attempt to limit some of this damage, laws in places around the world have been enacted specifically to improve road safety. For example, some U.S. states have imposed universal helmet laws, requiring all motorcycle riders and passengers to wear protective helmets. Some governments impose fines on automobile drivers and passengers who do not use seat belts. Accidents involving buses are also responsible for injuries to large numbers of people, and this has led to mandatory seat belt use in some places. Safety features on cars, including seat belts, side-impact reinforcement, and air bags, have contributed to fewer injuries and deaths. Certain changes in the design of car bumpers and windshields have been aimed at causing less harm to pedestrians who may be hit. Preventive measures, such as campaigns on the dangers of drunk driving, enforcement of speed limits, the use of cameras to catch traffic law violators, and education of children about road safety, have helped raise public awareness about the importance of safety precautions on the road.\n\nSports accidents\n\nAccidents during sports have long been the cause of debilitating injuries. Since the rise of modern organized sports in the 18th century, all sports—especially those involving contact, such as boxing, American football, and rugby—have witnessed crippling injuries, disability, and death. Sports in which an individual is elevated off the ground, such as horseback riding, mountain climbing, and rappelling, account for a high number of head and spinal injuries as well as fractures. From the latter part of the 20th century, the number of sports that deliberately court danger, the so-called extreme sports, grew rapidly and resulted in a concomitant number of injuries.\n\nFor some sports, changes in rules and safety equipment have helped to reduce the incidence and severity of accidents on the sports field. However, such action does not eradicate injury. For example, despite more stringent penalties for illegal checking in ice hockey and helmet-to-helmet contact in American football, concussion remains a major source of long-term disability in those sports.\n\nAccidents in the home\n\nThe home is a site for many accidents. Stairways, bathrooms, and kitchens pose special hazards, as do utility closets, medicine cabinets, gardens, and swimming pools. Among children under age five, falls, burns, choking, poisoning, and drowning are common causes of injury or death at home. Falls are also common among older individuals.\n\nA number of factors may precipitate accidents in the home. Poor supervision or poor housing conditions can increase the risk of accidents in the home for children. For example, unsupervised children may choke on small objects that have been within their reach. Likewise, poor electrical wiring and a lack of fire safety can result in significant injury and loss of property to fire.\n\nAccidents in the hospital\n\nAccidents involving procedures or medication can occur in hospitals and sometimes lead to permanent disability. For example, the use of instruments such as forceps can in rare instances result in brain trauma at birth. In some cases, medication errors may occur in which patients are given the wrong medication or too much or too little of a medication while in a hospital. Such errors can have severe adverse effects on patients. Hospitalized individuals also are susceptible to nosocomial, or health care-associated, infections, which in extreme cases can end in death.\n\nAccidents in the workplace\n\nOccupational hazards have always existed, but they became especially pronounced with the rise of modern factories, mines, and foundries in the 19th century. Industries such as construction and mining, in which heavy equipment is used, are associated with an elevated risk for severe injury. Constant and repetitive work can produce injuries such as prepatellar bursitis (or beat knee, caused by constant kneeling) and hand-arm vibration syndrome (or vibration white finger, caused by the handling of vibrating tools for long periods). Long-term exposure to materials such as asbestos can lead to chronic diseases such as mesothelioma. Occupations that involve sitting for long periods or typing constantly come with their own sets of risks. Carpal tunnel syndrome, for example, which can be caused by leaning the wrists on a desk while working at a computer, is one of the most-common repetitive stress injuries in the modern workplace.\n\nHistorically, there was little in the way of safety equipment to prevent accidents, and long-term exposure to dangerous chemicals could cause severe disablement and death. Before factory owners were called on to make their workplaces safer, many workers were injured in accidents. When permanent disability was the result, often that worker was doomed to a life of poverty, since there was often little in the way of compensation for his or her injury. The rise of occupational medicine in the industrial era, accompanied by an increased recognition of occupational hazards, led to improved measures of protection for workers.\n\nJulie Anderson The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
