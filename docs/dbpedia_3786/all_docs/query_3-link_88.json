        "text": "The road between Mammoth Hot Springs and the northeast entrance is the only park road typically open to regular traffic year-round, weather permitting (closes in winter east of Cooke City, MT). All other park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles (cars, vans, motorcycles, etc.), and open to limited snowmobile and snowcoach travel from mid-December to mid-March. Before coming to the park, be sure to check the following:\n\nPark roads: the current road status, seasonal road opening/closing dates, and road construction information.\n\nWebcams: a live look at traffic approaching the north and west entrances to the park.\n\nThe Natural Resource Conservation Service offers an interactive map that displays current data on snow depth, snow water equivalent, and more from SNOTEL stations in and around Yellowstone. Avalanche forecasts and other winter safety information are available from the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center and the Bridger Teton Avalanche Center.\n\nThe fishing season runs from the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend (usually the last weekend in May) and extends through October 31. You are strongly encouraged to purchase a required fishing permit online before arriving in the park.\n\nBoiling River: No swimming at Boiling River. Currently, swimming is not possible at Boiling River because of the impacts to the river from the 2022 floods.\n\nFirehole River Swim Area: Closed for the season\n\nPark waters are swift and cold, so use caution around all rivers and streams. Find out more about swimming and soaking in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nNever approach animals or block traffic to view them. The animals in Yellowstone are wild and unpredictable, no matter how calm they appear to be. Always stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards (23 m) away from all other animals, including bison and elk. Read more about safety in bear country and learn about bear spray, a highly effective, non-lethal bear deterrent."
