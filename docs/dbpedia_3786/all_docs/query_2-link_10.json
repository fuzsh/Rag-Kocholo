TRF plays a pivotal role in the Departmentâ€™s constant efforts to accomplish zero fatalities on Texas roads, such as the Road to Zero program.\n\nThe division assists and supports TxDOT districts in the research, development, and implementation of the statewide Traffic Management Systems Program designed to improve the safety and efficiency of the state highway system and provides the districts with equipment, support, and maintenance for traffic signals, intelligent transportation systems, and roadway illumination. The Traffic Safety Division also administers the Texas Traffic Safety Program, the Highway Safety Improvement Program, the Texas Highway Safety Plan, the Texas Traffic Assessment Program, and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. The division develops, publishes and distributes the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which is used by all road authorities in Texas."
