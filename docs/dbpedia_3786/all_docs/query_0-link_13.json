        "text": "As you might imagine, ensuring the safety and maintenance of roads and transportation networks can be very complex. Issues such as taxation of vehicles, maintenance of roadways, commercial transportation, and the issuance of driver’s licenses require cooperation and coordination between many state and local entities. In Kansas, these entities currently share the primary responsibility for oversight and regulation:\n\nKansas Department of Transportation\n\nKansas Department of Revenue\n\nKansas Highway Patrol\n\nKansas Turnpike Authority\n\nKansas Corporation Commission\n\nKansas Insurance Commissioner\n\nEach entity owns a unique piece of the puzzle and manages different aspects of licensure, compliance, regulation, planning, and oversight for their areas of specialization.\n\nOnce you buy a vehicle, you’ll need to be sure that it is legally registered and properly insured. Whether your vehicle is new or used, you’ll need to visit your local county treasurer’s office to obtain tags and titles — this includes obtaining personalized or distinctive license plates. In addition to registering your vehicle, you will need to pay an annual renewal fee for your vehicle tags. Renewal notices are sent by your county treasurer’s office in the weeks preceding your renewal date. You can renew via paper or online through the iKan app.\n\nAnother requirement of a road-worthy vehicle is purchasing and maintaining automobile insurance. The Kansas Insurance Department provides drivers with information on the basic coverages required in Kansas, as well as an “Auto Shopper’s Guide” that can help give you the confidence you need to navigate the sometimes intimidating process of obtaining proper coverage.\n\nFor those who finance their vehicles, a lien will be placed on the vehicle title. The lien is filed by the Lienholder and acts as form of security until you pay off your loan in full. The Kansas Department of Revenue Division of Vehicles has provided answers to some of the most frequently asked questions related to liens.\n\nBusinesses with a need to verify titles, liens, and registrations of vehicles can take advantage of Kansas.gov’s Title, Lien, and Registration service.\n\nFor drivers who need to obtain a “Disabled Parking Placard/Plate/Decal,” you will need to:\n\nPrint a copy of a TR159 form\n\nHave it certified by a health care professional who is licensed through the Kansas Board of Healing Arts\n\nTake the completed form to your local county treasurer’s motor vehicle office\n\nWhether you drive for a living or live to drive, you need to have a valid license before you hit the road.\n\nIf you are an adult and have never been issued a Kansas license, you will need to prove your identity and residence, pass the necessary examinations (written, driving, and vision) and pay the applicable fees. KDOR publishes driver’s handbooks (English and Spanish) to help you study. There is also an Alexa skill that you can download to practice taking your test. There are special requirements for teen drivers who want to obtain a license.\n\nApplying for your driver’s license must be done in person at a Driver’s License Exam Station. Several locations participate in the Q-Flow Wait Line Management System. This service allows you to reserve an appointment in advance and skip the line when you arrive. Be sure to review the checklist to make sure that you have brought all the necessary documentation with you when you arrive at your appointment.\n\nOnce you have your license, you will need to keep an eye on its expiration date. Your license is no longer valid once the date has passed, even if you have a good driving record. The good news is that many drivers are eligible to renew their licenses online.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Revenue may suspend a driver’s license for a variety of reasons, including failure to provide proof of insurance, driving under the influence, or accumulation of unpaid fines. If this happens to you, you will need to contact the Division of Vehicles – Driver Solutions office. Special action is required to apply for restricted driving privileges or to have your license reinstated."
