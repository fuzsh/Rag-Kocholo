This information is confidential and used strictly for the purpose of sending relevant information about New Mexico road conditions for road segments requested by the subscriber. The email and phone information provided will not be provided to any other agencies or third parties for advertising or any other purpose.\n\nSubscribing to receive email and or text messages from the NMRoads.com site is entirely voluntary.

Because incidents and road conditions, whether attributable to traffic crashes or are weather-related, can rapidly change, this website may not reflect all incidents or road conditions for every route and should not be your only source for information. It should also be noted that reported road conditions are limited to those routes maintained by the NMDOT.\n\nIn some instances the information being provided is through a third party (i.e., weather conditions through the National Weather Service).
