M/MS/OMD determines agency-wide policy and criteria for USAID-owned and leased motor vehicles, in compliance with COM policies at post; makes the decisions on missions’ requests to standardize vehicle makes; and compiles and submits USAID’s annual vehicle reports to other agencies (see USAID ADS Chapter 536).\n\nc. For USAID-owned vehicles that are managed by ICASS, the service provider will submit to USAID - M/MS/OMD specific data on USAID-owned vehicles so that USAID can compile its annual reports submission to FAST, etc.\n\nd. Posts and the ICASS service provider must ensure that proceeds of sales of vehicles owned by USAID are properly recorded to ensure credit to the appropriate USAID account.\n\n14 FAM 431.5-3 Other Agencies\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. To the extent that other agencies have dedicated vehicles overseas, the in-country operations of those vehicles must comply with the chief of mission’s motor vehicle policy. In cases where another agency's mission necessitates special uses of its dedicated vehicles at post, which would require a specific deviance from the chief of mission's motor vehicle policy, that agency's headquarters must provide written justification that describes the proposed deviance, cites any relevant authorities, and is signed by the agency's headquarters to the chief of mission and the Department of State's MVAO at post (see 14 FAM 431.6-2). The COM must have the opportunity to object to any proposed deviance from the motor vehicle policy. If the chief of mission does not object, the motor vehicle policy should be amended to note any special uses, which apply only to the operations of the other agency's dedicated vehicles. Any disputes should be resolved by agency headquarters and the relevant regional bureau. Agencies with oversight of their own dedicated vehicles must also designate a Vehicle Accountable Official (VAO) responsible for those vehicles (see 14 FAM 431.6-2).\n\nb. Other agency legacy armored vehicles, including aftermarket and factory armored vehicles that are already deployed overseas as of January 2020, may continue to be used for the protection of other agency/department personnel under the security responsibility of the COM until January 2026. Replacements for these armored vehicles must be OSPB-compliant. Other agencies may not transfer noncompliant armored vehicles between posts.\n\n14 FAM 431.6 Responsibilities – Overseas Posts\n\n14 FAM 431.6-1 Chief of Mission\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. As provided in 22 U.S.C. 3927 and the President's Letter of Instruction to Chiefs of Mission (see 2 FAH-2 H-110), unless otherwise provided in law or presidential directive, the chief of mission has authority over all U.S. Government executive branch employees, activities, and operations (with certain exceptions) in their country/area of responsibilities.\n\nb. Chiefs of mission, in consultation with the heads of agencies at posts, will prescribe the mission-wide written motor vehicle policy for the safe and equitable use of official vehicles for business purposes and other authorized uses in accordance with this subchapter. See 14 FAM 435.1 for the elements that must be incorporated in the COM mission motor vehicle policy.\n\nc. The chief of mission should also consider the needs of all agencies at post when developing the motor vehicle policy. The policy, which applies to all personnel under COM authority, must be enforced consistently across agencies and provide for uniform, fair, and equitable treatment. The motor vehicle policy must be reviewed at least annually and revised, as needed, to incorporate any updates to the FAM or post policy.\n\nd. Each vehicle at post presents a risk to the COM. It is the COMs who are responsible for ensuring official motor vehicles at post are used and managed in accordance with the motor vehicle policy. Additionally, COMs should include mechanisms in their motor vehicle policies for agencies to request exceptions to such policies (14 FAM 431.5-3). The COM policy may be more restrictive than U.S. government agencies' policies to address local conditions.\n\ne. The COM at each post designates a U.S. direct-hire American employee (usually the management officer (MO) or general services officer (GSO) to serve as the mission vehicle accountable officer (MVAO) to manage both State Program and ICASS vehicles. In locations where USAID manages its own motor vehicles or is the ICASS service provider for motor pool services, the COM may designate the USAID executive officer (EXO) as MVAO.\n\nf. At missions with consulates, and where agencies or individual Department of State sections (i.e., RSO, OBO, INL) either own, or are assigned, dedicated Program or ICASS vehicles falling outside of the MVAO's ability to provide daily oversight, the head of each agency or section must designate a Vehicle Accountable Officer (VAO) by informing that individual and the MVAO in writing.\n\n14 FAM 431.6-2 Mission Vehicle Accountable Officer (MVAO)\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. The MVAO must be designated in writing by the COM and is responsible for managing the mission-wide fleet program, to include oversight of the programs at any constituent posts.\n\nb. Responsibilities of the MVAO include:\n\n(1) Managing and operating the motor pool (where applicable) and complying with the Department’s Motor Vehicle Safety Management Program (MVSMP) (14 FAM 433);\n\n(2) Preparing and submitting required reports including motor vehicle mishap reporting, in coordination with the post occupational safety and health officer (POSHO), as required in 15 FAM 964;\n\n(3) Formulating policy and operational guidelines for approval by the COM and ICASS council (as applicable) for efficient fleet operations as well as communicating such policy/guidelines, and monitoring for compliance;\n\n(4) Controlling vehicle use, including a key control system and a vehicle key control log for pooled vehicles showing the operator’s name, tag number, and date/time when keys are picked up and returned, excepting those dedicated program vehicles under the direct purview of a VAO (14 FAM 431.6-3);\n\n(5) Overseeing overall fleet composition and size to include conducting the Vehicle Allocation Methodology (VAM) study, and making recommendations on vehicle replacement and fleet adjustments;\n\n(6) Conducting annual inventories of all State armored and unarmored vehicles using the Integrated Logistics Management System Asset Management (ILMS-AM) module;\n\n(7) Ensuring use of the Fleet Management Information System (FMIS) to track daily trip reports, record maintenance and fuel costs, and review vehicle and driver utilization, and periodically verifying integrity of data in the FMIS;\n\n(8) Coordinating and overseeing vehicle disposals; and\n\n(9) Establishing a schedule of inspections to meet safety, security, and warranty requirements.\n\n14 FAM 431.6-3 Vehicle Accountable Officer (VAO)\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. Vehicle accountable officers (VAO) are responsible for compliance with the mission's motor vehicle policy.\n\nb. Responsibilities of the VAO include:\n\n(1) Managing and operating vehicles in compliance with the Department’s Motor Vehicle Safety Management Program (MVSMP) as required in 14 FAM 433;\n\n(2) Preparing and submitting required reports including motor vehicle mishap reporting, in coordination with the POSHO, as required in 15 FAM 964;\n\n(3) Controlling vehicle use (including host government-owned vehicles under USAID custody);\n\n(4) Providing the MVAO with vehicle and driver information to respond to mandatory reports, conduct utilization analyses, and monitor compliance with post policies;\n\n(5) Making recommendations on vehicle replacement and fleet adjustments;\n\n(6) Coordinating and overseeing vehicle disposal;\n\n(7) Preparing and/or reviewing the trip report, which consists of the driver trip ticket report and the driver's daily and weekly preventative maintenance checklist to monitor vehicle use. This is especially critical for armored vehicles per 12 FAM 380;\n\n(8) Reviewing monthly fuel consumption reports; and\n\n(9) Establishing a schedule of inspections to meet safety, security, and warranty requirements. This is especially critical for armored vehicles per 12 FAM 380.\n\n14 FAM 431.6-4 Motor Pool Supervisor\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAID)\n\na. The motor pool supervisor is an employee with first-line supervisory responsibilities over the motor pool staff who generally reports directly to the MVAO or VAO. In addition to supervisory duties, the motor pool supervisor responsibilities include:\n\n(1) Managing requests for motor pool services in FMIS, assigning drivers and vehicles to trip tickets and reviewing daily trip records;\n\n(2) Managing preparation and/or reviewing required operational forms, to include the Daily Vehicle Use Record;\n\n(3) Monitoring the accuracy and timeliness of data put into FMIS and preparing fleet reports such as the annual Motor Vehicle Survey (MVS) and Vehicle Allocation Methodology (VAM);\n\n(4) Implementing and monitoring compliance with safety program requirements;\n\n(5) Overseeing preventative maintenance and a repair program for vehicles under the supervisor's jurisdiction; and\n\n(6) Ensuring vehicles that do not pass all inspection items in the daily and weekly preventative maintenance checklists are removed from service until all items are corrected.\n\nb. If no motor pool supervisor position is established, the duties under paragraph a of this section must be assigned to another employee or assumed by the MVAO or VAO.\n\n14 FAM 432 USE AND CONTROL OF OFFICIAL VEHICLES\n\n14 FAM 432.1 Overview\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. All posts or agencies having two or more vehicles available for general use should operate such vehicles as a motor pool; that is, make them available for the use of all personnel who need a vehicle for official purposes. Motor vehicles from more than one agency may be pooled with the agreement of the COM or principal officer and the ranking officer of another agency at the post.\n\nb. Official vehicles are authorized to be used for all business purposes described in 14 FAM 432.2. Official vehicles may also be used for an “other authorized use” outlined in 14 FAM 432.3, but only where the specific use is explicitly authorized by the COM in the mission’s motor vehicle policy and consistent with 22 U.S.C. 2700. As described in 14 FAM 431.5-3, if another agency has dedicated vehicles at post, the agency's headquarters must provide a written justification for any proposed deviances from the motor vehicle policy, and the COM must have the opportunity to object.\n\n14 FAM 432.2 Business Purposes\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. Official vehicles are authorized for use in the transport of personnel and property in the conduct of U.S. Government business which is defined as:\n\n(1) Any transportation for the chief of mission (COM), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week within country of assignment, and any transportation of the Principal Officer (PO) within the PO's assigned consular district, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. NOTE: In instances where the COM or PO utilizes a dedicated vehicle, family members may ride in the vehicle only when accompanying the COM or PO, unless the purpose of that trip is authorized under another provision of 14 FAM 432.2 or 14 FAM 432.3;\n\n(2) Transportation of U.S. Government employees, including individuals hired by the U.S. Government under personal services agreements/personal services contracts, and U.S. Government property which is directly related to the conduct of U.S. Government business; this provision extends to the transportation of employees in-country to monitor foreign assistance development projects;\n\n(3) Transportation of U.S. Government contract workers when considered necessary to further the purposes of the contract unless the terms of the contract require the contractor to provide such transportation;\n\n(4) Transportation of family members in furtherance of an official U.S. Government activity where the presence of a family member will further U.S. Government interests, such as official government functions by or for representatives of foreign nations;\n\n(5) Local transportation of Marine Security Guards (MSG) for official purposes, including group recreational trips, as authorized in the Vehicle Assignment, Support, and Control Annex of the Memorandum of Agreement between State and the U.S. Marine Corps (12 FAM Exhibit 431(B));\n\n(6) Transportation of on-call duty personnel outside normal duty hours to perform official business, including vehicles designated for rapid response. The mission motor vehicle policy may include a listing of those positions requiring such use (e.g., embassy duty officer and regional security officer for after-hours response; regional medical officer for medical emergencies). Heads of other agencies must provide written approval for home-to-work transportation to the MVAO for positions falling under this provision (14 FAM 432.6);\n\n(7) Transportation of public diplomacy artists, speakers, grantees, journalists, etc., in support of the Public Diplomacy program; and\n\n(8) USAGM only: Transportation of correspondents of the Voice of America and transportation of International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) transmitting station managers. When a transmitting station is outside of the vicinity of a post, transportation of IBB transmitting station personnel is authorized while in a formal duty or on-call status, as confirmed by their listing as such on the written, periodic transportation plan and shift schedule prepared by the International Broadcasting Bureau transmitting stations. Approval of such transportation by the COM must be documented in the mission motor vehicle policy.\n\nb. Taxicabs, transportation network companies (TNC), and other means of public transportation may be authorized for business purposes when official vehicles are not available, unless the regional security officer (RSO) and/or emergency action committee (EAC) determines that the use of taxicabs, TNCS, and/or public transportation is not allowable. The employee may be reimbursed for the authorized use of transportation according to procedures established by post. Alternatively, post may pay the transportation company directly.\n\n14 FAM 432.3 Other Authorized Use (OAU)\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. Transportation for other than business purposes is normally an employee responsibility. Privately owned vehicles are shipped to most posts at U.S. Government expense in consideration of such responsibility. The COM, however, may approve other authorized use (OAU) of official vehicles consistent with the requirements of 22 U.S.C. 2700, as enumerated below. An OAU will only be available where the COM authorizes it in the mission motor vehicle policy.\n\nb. The use of official vehicles for purposes listed in this section is not a mandate or entitlement. OAUs are subject to the availability and prioritization of post’s resources. OAUs are also subject to the charges set forth in 14 FAM 432.8.\n\nc. Under 22 U.S.C. 2700, the COM may approve OAUs where such uses are advantageous to the U.S. Government or where public transportation is unsafe or unavailable. The following is an exhaustive list of OAU purposes that the COM may authorize in a mission motor vehicle policy:\n\n(1) Transportation of eligible family member K-12 school children, as defined by the DSSR, to and from a U.S.-sponsored school when transportation provided by the school, or other commercially provided transportation is unavailable, unsafe, or inappropriate, provided that the COM deems use of official vehicles for this transportation to be advantageous to the U.S. Government. NOTE: The ICASS council must approve this additional function and associated allocation of resources incurred to provide such support;\n\n(2) Transportation for employees at post on temporary duty status to and from their temporary quarters;\n\n(3) Home-to-work (HTW) transportation, depending on available post resources, for U.S. direct-hire (USDH) employees when arriving on assignment or upon departure of assignment for a maximum of 30 days, when such use will be provided equitably to employees whether they have shipped a personally owned vehicle (POV), given that a lack of transportation options would affect all personnel at post. In lieu of providing official vehicles, post policy may allow approved taxi or TNC services, public transportation, and/or rental cars to meet personal transportation requirements. For posts with a need for U.S. Government-provided transportation extending beyond the 30-day time limit, see 14 FAM 432.4;\n\n(4) Home-to-work (HTW) transportation for the DCM where the COM determines that such use is required by diplomatic necessity, security, or safety. Such usage will incur a charge absent a waiver under the exception noted in 14 FAM 432.8. Other agency headquarters may authorize HTW transportation for their in-country heads of agency, subject to COM approval. Such authorization must be provided in writing to the MVAO consistent with 14 FAM 431.5-3;\n\n(5) Transportation of U.S. citizen employees and/or their family members where such transportation is needed due to driver restrictions arising under local law or custom or where an individual is not permitted to import a POV and alternate transportation options do not exist;\n\n(6) Transportation of locally employed (LE) staff who are dependent on public transportation for officially ordered work outside regular working hours, and who must travel between an authorized work site and their home during hours of infrequently scheduled public transportation or darkness. Such transportation must support a specific operational objective and be authorized in advance by the COM, MVAO, or U.S. supervisor on a trip-by-trip basis;\n\n(7) Post community activities sponsored by the community liaison office (CLO) and approved by the MVAO;\n\n(8) One-time school orientation visit for which the eligible family member (EFM) student’s tuition is paid by the U.S. Government. The student will only be transported for this orientation if the legal guardian is present in the vehicle;\n\n(9) Employee relocation to U.S. Government-provided quarters for interagency housing board-directed moves that are not for the employee's convenience;\n\n(10) Emergency medical requirements when validated by the regional medical officer or medical provider;\n\n(11) Transportation of official residence employee staff in direct support of official events; and/or\n\n(12) When public transportation is formally documented by the COM as unsafe, unavailable, or inherently dangerous (14 FAM 432.4).\n\n14 FAM 432.4 Public or Alternate Transportation Unsafe or Unavailable\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\nWhen the use of official vehicles is justified for nonbusiness purposes on the basis of unsafe or unavailable public transportation, the following additional certifications are required prior to inclusion in the mission motor vehicle policy:\n\n(1) Public and/or alternate transportation (including taxicabs, TNC, and rental cars) deemed unsafe: Post’s RSO must submit a recommendation to post’s emergency action committee (EAC), citing the reasons why official vehicles must be utilized in lieu of all forms of public transportation and/or POVs. Such recommendation must include whether armored or unarmored vehicles must be used and locations/circumstances for such use (which may include home-to-work transportation), and projected length of time for such use. With EAC concurrence, the RSO must issue a security directive cleared through the MVAO and approved by the COM outlining the exception to authorized usage. The security directive will be considered an addendum to the mission’s motor vehicle policy and remain in force until such time as conditions no longer require an exception to policy; and\n\n(2) Public and/or alternate transportation (including taxicabs, TNC, and rental cars) is unavailable: Post’s MVAO must submit a written recommendation to post's ICASS council with market survey information showing public or reasonable alternate commercial transportation options either do not exist or cannot serve areas where U.S. direct-hire employees live and work; the parameters of the services that will be provided through motor pool; and the cost to agencies at post in providing such services. If the recommendation is supported by the ICASS council, the COM must approve the policy and the parameters for usage to be included in the mission motor vehicle policy. This provision must be reviewed annually by the MVAO for continued need.\n\n14 FAM 432.5 Shuttle Services\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. Consolidating vehicle passenger services provides economies of scale and should be used to the maximum extent possible to meet recurring needs for multiple passengers. Transportation for CLO-sponsored events, personnel newly arrived or scheduled to depart post, and temporary duty (TDY) personnel, should be supported in this manner.\n\nb. Outsourcing shuttle services to commercial entities should be considered first, where the local market can meet the mission’s transportation needs. Posts may acquire these services through post’s employee association, where applicable.\n\nc. When alternate forms of commercial transportation are unavailable or unreliable, post may establish a motor pool shuttle service operation. To the maximum extent possible, posts should use shuttle bus services in lieu of individual dispatch of motor pool vehicles.\n\nd. If shuttle services are provided by post, such usage must be outlined in the mission motor vehicle policy.\n\ne. Charge: Costs charged to users of post shuttle services must be in accordance with 14 FAM 432.8, Charges for Use of Official Vehicles.\n\n14 FAM 432.6 Home to Work Transportation (HTW)\n\n(CT:LOG-305; 01-28-2021)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. Home-to-work (HTW) transportation is for official use only and therefore is not permitted for personal use, or for the convenience of the employee. Transportation of employees to and from their residences may only be authorized by the COM if meeting one of the provisions listed under sections 14 FAM 432.2, 14 FAM 432.3, and/or 14 FAM 432.4, and documented in the mission motor vehicle policy.\n\nb. In instances where another U.S. Government agency permits HTW transportation for its personnel using its own dedicated vehicles, that agency’s headquarters must provide written approval for HTW to the MVAO. The authorization must include, at a minimum: the legal authority for HTW transportation; the category of employees to which the authorization extends; and any specific parameters or restrictions on the usage of official vehicles for home-to-work transportation.\n\nc. All employees authorized HTW transportation through dedicated official vehicles are responsible for meeting all requirements in documenting daily vehicle and fuel usage. If permitted by post policy to self-drive, employees must meet all U.S. and host-country legal and safety requirements for operating a vehicle in that country.\n\nd. Locally employed staff (LES) are not authorized home to work transportation.\n\n14 FAM 432.7 Dedicated Vehicle Assignments\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na.

To reduce the potential for motor-vehicle mishaps caused by operator sleep deprivation and fatigue, operators of official vehicles and POVs used for official business shall not normally be required to perform more than 10 hours on duty, and only after a minimum eight-hour sleep period. Duty time means total shift duration, not total driving time.\n\nb. Only in exceptional circumstances, such as unanticipated security requirements (e.g., there is no safe place to stop), may the duty limit be exceeded with approval of the MVAO/VAO.\n\nc. Supervisors must plan and staff trips so as to not exceed the 10-hour limit. When day-to-day requirements lead to shifts exceeding 10 hours on duty, supervisors must make arrangements for another operator to cover any time that exceeds 10 hours. This requirement also applies to dedicated chauffeurs.\n\nd. When exceptional circumstances require an on-duty shift greater than 10 hours, the operator must spend 14 hours off duty before returning to driving duties.\n\ne. Local guard mobile patrol drivers and MSG chauffeurs operating GOVs may operate on a 12-hour shift in compliance with MVSMP guidelines as follows:\n\n(1) An alternate workday schedule is in place (one day on duty followed by one day off duty);\n\n(2) Within each 12-hour shift, the operator drives no for more than 10 hours; and\n\n(3) An operator may not work a scheduled off-duty day unless 14 hours have passed since the prior shift ended; and\n\n(4) An operator may not return for duty until spending 14 hours off duty.\n\n14 FAM 433.9 Distraction Controls\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na.

Claims: 2 FAM 281 (for the Department of State) and ADS Chapter 152 (for USAID) outline the administrative authority for the Secretary of State to settle and pay tort claims to third parties for property damage, bodily injury, and death resulting from the operation of official vehicles by their employees acting within the scope of employment. Post has authority to settle claims for amounts less than $2,500 as specified in 2 FAM 281.5. Claims exceeding this amount must be reported immediately in accordance with paragraph c of this section.\n\nb. Liability through court action: The U.S. Government and the individual may be sued in a U.S. or foreign court for damages and injury or death stemming from an individual’s use of an official vehicle. It is critical that individuals use U.S. Government vehicles strictly in accordance with FAM requirements and the mission motor vehicle policy, and that all required authorizations for such use be properly documented. Operation of U.S. Government vehicles outside of these policies could result in the employee incurring personal liability for monetary damages.\n\nc. Reporting: Report of claims and court action as follows:\n\n(1) Any claim in excess of $2,500 received by post must be immediately reported to the Office of the Legal Adviser for International Claims and Investment Disputes (L/CID) pursuant to 2 FAM 281.5. L/CID will provide consultation and guidance to post regarding investigation and is the primary office responsible for adjudication of such claims; and\n\n(2) Any action in foreign courts or tribunals concerning an overseas vehicle accident involving a U.S. official vehicle must be immediately reported to the Office of Diplomatic Law and Litigation (L/DL) and to L/CID. See 2 FAM 226 and 2 FAM 284 for more information.\n\nd. Insurance: The United States Government generally self-insures for property damage, bodily injury, and death resulting from the operation of official vehicles by their employees acting “within the scope of employment.” Under 22 U.S.C. 2670(a), however, the Department of State may obtain insurance on official motor vehicles operated by the Department in foreign countries and pay the expenses incident thereto. Adequate third-party liability insurance must be purchased by post where required by local law. In addition, where the post motor vehicle policy permits the self-drive of official vehicles for specific approved OAU purposes by other than a designated post chauffeur or incidental operator, post is allowed to purchase such insurance. The MVAO or designee is responsible for determining the amount of liability insurance required and which vehicles to insure, if any. The MVAO should consult with A/LM/PMP/OF as needed for guidance prior to the purchase or renewal of such insurance. The MVAO is also responsible for advising individuals authorized to drive vehicles for OAU purposes to consider obtaining their own individual insurance to protect themselves against such liability amounts as required by local law or as deemed advisable by the MVAO, other officials, or their own assessment.\n\n14 FAM 434.2 Loss or Extensive Damage to Official Vehicles\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. The repair of all official vehicles is a post responsibility and does not require prior approval from A/LM/PMP/OF. Any repair involving the armor or armored vehicles must be coordinated with DS/PSP/DEAV.\n\nb. The MVAO must report motor vehicle-related and shop-related mishaps to the POSHO in accordance with 15 FAM 964. Motor vehicle accidents involving armored vehicles must also be reported to Diplomatic Security (DS) through the DS Command Center. USAID: the USAID EXO must submit to the POSHO and the USAID/W safety and health officer a copy of all mishap reports involving USAID-related mishaps that involve injury, illness, death, or property damage exceeding $1,000.\n\nc. For State: If a vehicle is lost, stolen, or damaged beyond repair, the MVAO must complete Form DS-132 and follow the disposal process outlined in 14 FAM 436.7 (the MVAO sends Form DS-132 to the Chief, Overseas Fleet (A/LM/PMP/OF)). For USAID: After survey action is complete, Form AID-534-1, Personal Property Disposal Authorization and Report, must be sent to the appropriate agency headquarters office in Washington, DC, that owns the vehicle. For USAID ICASS vehicles: Submit Form AID-534-1 to M/MS/OMD.\n\n14 FAM 435 FLEET OPERATIONS\n\n14 FAM 435.1 Mission-Wide Motor Vehicle Policy\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. The COM, in consultation with the heads of agencies at post, will prescribe the mission policy for use of official vehicles in a written memorandum. The policy must provide for uniform, fair, and equitable treatment and applies to all agencies under COM authority. The motor vehicle policy must be reviewed at least annually and revised, as needed, to incorporate any updates to the FAM or post policy.\n\nb. The policy must incorporate at a minimum the following elements, as applicable:\n\n(1) Identification of the MVAO and VAO for each established motor pool. NOTE: Identification by position only;\n\n(2) The categories of employees authorized to drive official vehicles as defined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as either a chauffeur or incidental operator; training, safety and medical requirements for such personnel to be authorized to drive official vehicles (14 FAM 433);\n\n(3) The business purposes and other authorized uses for which the mission’s official vehicles may be used. Any and all offices/positions/categories of personnel permitted HTW transportation (14 FAM 432.6);\n\n(4) Designated/dedicated vehicle authorizations;\n\n(5) Determination that public or commercial transportation is unavailable, or unsafe if OAU is authorized by COM under the provision of 14 FAM 432.3, subparagraph (11);\n\n(6) Availability and use of shuttle services;\n\n(7) Charges for specific purposes under OAU;\n\n(8) Motor Vehicle Safety Management Program requirements for both drivers and passengers to ensure safe vehicle operations, to include mandatory seat-belt use;\n\n(9) Post insurance coverage for official vehicles; and\n\n(10) Process for requesting a specific deviation from the policy for another agency's dedicated vehicles when the needs of that agency so require.\n\n14 FAM 435.2 Vehicle Inspections\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. Preventative vehicle inspection and maintenance must be conducted to ensure operative reliability, to maximize vehicle life cycle, and to reduce factors that can contribute to vehicle collisions and mishaps.\n\nb. Operators of official vehicles must perform vehicle inspections as required in the Driver’s Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist Daily Vehicle Usage Report (or other agency equivalent form that captures the same information). The inspection must be completed on a daily basis by the employee operating or servicing the vehicle. The MVAO must periodically review driver checklists for each vehicle, checking for the accuracy of odometer readings and for any unreported vehicle damage.\n\nc. All official vehicles must be inspected at least once a year by a qualified mechanic for safety and environmental defects. If an annual official inspection (i.e., federally mandated) is required for a vehicle that meets or exceeds these requirements, those inspections will be considered in compliance with this standard. Unarmored motor vehicles that have not received preventive maintenance inspection within 13 months should not be dispatched until the scheduled maintenance is performed.\n\nd. Deficiencies identified in daily, weekly, or annual inspections must be corrected before the vehicle can be placed into service. Safety-related problems, such as nonfunctioning lights, horns, windshield wipers, brakes, inadequately inflated tires, and tires in visibly poor condition, which the driver cannot correct, must be marked for action by the post mechanic or service garage. NOTE: Armored vehicle tire condition and pressure must be checked and corrected each day before the vehicle is placed into service. Only tires having the appropriate weight rating may be installed on armored vehicles. Armored vehicle tires may not be repaired. When replacing armored vehicle tires, all tires on a single axle must be replaced at the same time. This information is described in detail in the DS/PSP/DEAV Annual Maintenance ALDAC and includes other tire-specific requirements such as maximum age of tires and the need to keep a manual tire inflation gauge in each armored vehicle.\n\n14 FAM 435.3 Parking of Official Vehicles\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. Official vehicles must be parked overnight at a central U.S. Government-controlled location for security concerns, accountability, and safekeeping purposes unless an alternate arrangement is approved by the MVAO.\n\nb. Armored vehicles must be parked under a covered structure to prevent delamination and other damage to the transparent armor. If covered parking is not available, post must coordinate with OBO/PDCS (Project Development, Coordination and Support) for the construction of covered parking. Until covered parking can be constructed, exterior front and rear sun shields or car covers can be used to temporarily protect transparent armor. Interior sun shields or screens must not be used, as they will damage the transparent armor.\n\n14 FAM 435.4 Diplomatic License Plates at Foreign Service Posts\n\n(CT:LOG-305; 01-28-2021)\n\n(All agencies under COM authority)\n\na. The MVAO is responsible for the control and issuance of diplomatic license plates, which must be recorded in FMIS for accountability.\n\nb. Posts may only obtain host-government-issued diplomatic license plates (including consular and administrative/technical license plates at missions where the host government makes such distinction) for the following vehicles:\n\n(1) U.S. Government-owned vehicles;\n\n(2) U.S. Government-leased vehicles that are solely and directly operated by the leasing U.S. Government agency; and\n\n(3) Personally owned vehicles of diplomatically accredited employees subject to COM authority.\n\nc. USAID in Washington will coordinate its requests with the Department. In advance of posing any such waiver request, USAID EXOs will consult with M/MS/OMD.\n\nd. Noncompliance or expressed unwillingness to comply with the mission motor vehicle policy may result in non-issuance or revocation of diplomatic license plates.\n\n14 FAM 435.5 Vehicle Telematics Program\n\n(CT:LOG-351; 06-03-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. Posts are prohibited from acquiring and installing commercial off-the-shelf telematics equipment and software for any Department of State or ICASS vehicles, outside of Department-approved telematics devices. Posts with questions about telematics should contact A/LM/PMP/OF.\n\nb. OBO/OPS/SHEM implements the Event Data Recorder (EDR) program at posts determined to have an increased risk of serious motor vehicle collisions based on collision history, host-country risk factors, and fleet size. EDR programs include the GOVs of all agencies under COM authority, with the exception of those owned by the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security and operated primarily by American law enforcement personnel working for those agencies. Other outside agencies may apply to the COM in accordance with 14 FAM 431.5-3 for waivers that allow temporary or permanent removal or disabling when enhanced operational security requires and U.S. direct-hire employees are driving.\n\nc. All diplomatic-plated official Department of State vehicles will be included in the program, and are not subject to blanket exemption by the COM.\n\nd. AVs in selected countries equipped with mandatory, active DS electronic countermeasure (ECM) devices must not have an event data recorder installed.\n\n14 FAM 436 Motor Vehicle Acquisitions, Disposals and Transfers\n\n14 FAM 436.1 Authority to Acquire Official Vehicles\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. The General Services Administration (GSA) is the preferred procurement source for all Federal Agencies in the acquisition of U.S.-manufactured vehicles and should be considered as the first source for acquiring vehicles (41 CFR 101-26.501-1). Requests for the purchase of new vehicles must be submitted to A/LM/PMP/OF by August 1, requests dealing with extenuating circumstances may be processed after August 1.\n\nb. Locally sourced and acquired vehicles must adhere to the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR), to include required sources and competition in contracting (see 14 FAH-2 H-200).\n\nc. Vehicle replacement, fleet size, and composition are determined by the appropriate program office in Washington, DC and with the approval of A/LM/PMP/OF.\n\nd. State/ICASS: Posts must obtain prior approval from A/LM/PMP/OF before acquiring any official vehicle:\n\n(1) Vehicle replacement, within post's target fleet size, which is established through a Vehicle Allocation Methodology (VAM) survey, will be approved with appropriate justification. Requests for new vehicle acquisitions above the target fleet size require thorough justification by post and approval of the A/LM/PMP/OF Division Director. A/LM/PMP/OF will coordinate review with post’s regional bureau executive office, or the funding bureau as applicable (e.g., OBO, INL);\n\n(2) Vehicles acquired for post’s local guard (LG), surveillance detection (SD), and bodyguard (BG) programs are not part of the post motor pool. They are assigned for exclusive security purposes as directed by the RSO and the Office of Overseas Protective Operations (DS/IP/OPO). The LG, SD, and BG vehicle fleet size and composition is determined by the RSO and DS/IP/OPO. Vehicles approved for a post residential security (RES) program are assigned exclusively for security purposes as directed by the RSO and the Office of Physical Security Programs (DS/C/PSP). The purchase of these vehicles also requires pre-approval by A/LM/PMP/OF, which will be coordinated through the DS Washington offices;\n\n(3) Armored vehicle replacements are procured by DS/PSP/DEAV in coordination with A/LM/PMP/OF and respective coordinating partners (e.g., ICASS councils, etc.). Overseas posts are required to submit an annual armored vehicle requirements cable to DS/PSP/DEAV, A/LM/PMP/OF, and their respective regional bureau and DS regional directorate by October 1 of each year, outlining their armored vehicle replacement requirements for the upcoming procurement cycle (12 FAM 383); and\n\n(4) Requests for unarmored GSA and local purchase must be submitted through the ILMS Ariba module and meet all Federal Acquisition Regulations. Requests must be pre-approved by A/LM/PMP/OF, with additional approvals from the respective program office and the ICASS council, if required. Local purchases must be completed within 90 days of approval.\n\ne. USAID: M/MS/OMD - see ADS Chapter 536 for policy on acquisition of vehicles.\n\nf. Other federal agencies at post:\n\n(1) Acquisition of U.S.-manufactured vehicles: GSA does not allow the Department of State to order vehicles on behalf of other agencies. Any agency intending to purchase official vehicles from the U.S. through GSA must place an order directly. Non-State agencies at post requiring purchase of U.S. manufactured vehicles must contact their agency headquarters for assistance; such purchases may not be handled through local ICASS procurement services; and\n\n(2) Acquisition of non-U.S. manufactured vehicles: Non-State agencies requesting post to purchase vehicles of any type on their behalf overseas must have approval from their parent agency’s headquarters procurement and motor vehicle program authorities. All federal agencies are responsible for annual reports to Congress concerning vehicle acquisitions within their agency which include those used overseas; individual federal agencies may also have different policies than the Department of State governing the acquisition and use of their vehicles. The MVAO and ICASS procurement office may not acquire such vehicles without approval from the funding agency headquarters for these purchases on its behalf.\n\n14 FAM 436.2 Fleet Size, Composition and Life Cycle\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. The Department uses a standard Vehicle Allocation Methodology (VAM) survey to set target fleet size based on industry fleet standards. A/LM/PMP/OF works with posts’ MVAOs and the regional bureau executive offices to validate the VAM against post necessity, with special consideration given to armored vehicles and posts with hardship and danger pay allowances. The Department uses the VAM to control rightsizing and right-typing of the composition of the overseas fleets. Approximately one-third of overseas posts and domestic bureaus participate in the VAM each year. Posts and domestic bureaus participating in the VAM must complete VAM surveys in ILMS by October 31.\n\nb. All requested increases to ICASS fleet size and composition beyond the VAM must be approved by the post’s ICASS council (see 14 FAM 436.3) and justified in the ICASS budget. A/LM/PMP/OF and the relevant regional bureau executive office will review and provide final approval for any requests that increase or change the fleet size or composition prior to acquisition of a vehicle.\n\nc. The fleet size and composition for non-ICASS vehicles is determined by the appropriate funding program office. The MVAO must be apprised of any proposed changes by the funding office to fleet size and composition to ensure local circumstances (e.g., host-government limitations, availability of parking on official facilities if required) will support the proposed changes to the overall mission fleet size:\n\n(1) State-owned/managed armored vehicles: Requirements for the armored vehicle program must be reviewed by post's emergency action committee (EAC) and submitted for ICASS council consideration annually, (12 FAM 383). Please consult DS/PSP/DEAV; and\n\n(2) USAID only: Any USAID armored vehicle program at post is done in coordination with the post's EAC and RSO. Refer to ADS Chapter 563 for more information.\n\nd. Posts must develop local vehicle life-cycle schedules that maximize value for the U.S. Government, when considering factors such as resale value, maintenance costs, and new replacement vehicle acquisition costs. The government’s general replacement cycle for passenger sedans and SUVs is five years or when the mileage exceeds 100,000 miles for standard vehicles and seven years for hybrid electric vehicles. Posts may choose to diverge from this baseline in view of local conditions, resale values, and maintenance costs. Utility vehicles and trucks with higher acquisition costs generally have a longer life cycle that should be determined based on a local cost-benefit analysis. Posts should replace passenger sedans and SUVs over 10 years in age to ensure that the local fleet continues to offer updated standards in safety technology and fuel economy.\n\n14 FAM 436.3 Review of Assigned Vehicles and Usage\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\nThe ICASS council, in consultation with post's MVAO, must review the Fleet Insights dashboard to analyze fleet use and composition annually to ensure the right mix of passenger and cargo-carrying vehicles are assigned and used properly. NOTE: The emergency action committee (EAC), (12 FAM 383), must also review the armored vehicle program annually and submit requirements to the ICASS council, or the appropriate program office in Washington, for consideration. If any vehicles are found to exceed agency fleet requirements, the MVAO or designee must notify the owning agency of the need for appropriate disposal, providing the vehicle description, inventory number, condition, age, and mileage.\n\n14 FAM 436.3-1 Vehicle Purchase Methodology\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAID)\n\na. State/ICASS only:\n\n(1) GSA should be considered as a first source for all vehicle acquisitions at post. All vehicle purchase requests will be submitted to A/LM/PMP/OF, who will procure U.S.-manufactured vehicles through GSA on behalf of post; and\n\n(2) If a U.S. manufactured vehicle available through GSA will not meet local conditions, or mission requirements, A/LM/PMP/OF approval is required prior to every local purchase of official vehicles, per the priorities below:\n\n(a) U.S. company-made vehicles: Post must first consider purchase of vehicles manufactured by U.S. companies, subsidiaries, or affiliated manufacturers; and\n\n(b) Foreign-made vehicles: These vehicles may be purchased abroad by post. Requests to purchase non-U.S. manufactured vehicles must include justification under one of the following conditions:\n\n(i) Special requirements exist which cannot be met with a U.S.-manufactured vehicle, (such as right-hand drive, or host-country/mission-specific conditions that U.S. domestically manufactured vehicles cannot meet); or\n\n(ii) Non-U.S. manufactured vs. U.S.-manufactured vehicles: A cost-benefit analysis must be submitted to A/LM/PMP/OF for review, to determine whether acquisition of a non-U.S. manufactured vehicle is justified. The total cost of acquisition, life cycle expenses, availability of parts and services, plus suitability to local conditions should be included in the analysis.\n\nb. USAID only: Refer to ADS Chapter 536 for guidance on criteria for purchasing vehicles.\n\n14 FAM 436.3-2 Vehicle Lease\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAID)\n\na. State only: Posts may lease or rent a vehicle to meet temporary requirements not to exceed 120 days. Leases in excess of 120 days must be approved in advance by the appropriate funding agency when a vehicle is leased to supplement its respective fleet or by the ICASS council when the vehicle is being leased to support the ICASS fleet, based on the following considerations:\n\n(1) For reasons of economy, long-term vehicle requirements are normally met by purchase rather than lease. However, if the MVAO believes that unusual circumstances favor leasing motor pool vehicles, a proposal must be submitted to A/LM/PMP/OF with a cost analysis. The analysis should be made for similar makes and models of vehicles. The provision of 14 FAM 436.3-1, concerning vehicles of foreign manufacture apply to lease as well as purchase;\n\n(2) All long-term leased or rental vehicles (more than 120 days) will be recorded in the ILMS Asset Management (ILMS-AM) module, and appropriately coded as a leased vehicle; and\n\n(3) Armored vehicles may not be rented or leased.\n\nb. USAID only: Refer to ADS Chapter 536 for guidance on criteria for leasing vehicles.\n\n14 FAM 436.3-3 Vehicle Transfer Into or Out of State/ICASS Inventory\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. State only: The transfer of an official vehicle (armored or unarmored) from or to another federal agency may be appropriate under certain circumstances and conditions. NOTE that the transfer of ICASS-funded vehicles must have OF and ICASS council approval as ICASS assets are paid for (gaining post to pay fair mark value) by ICASS customer agencies through ICASS invoices.\n\nb. A/LM/PMP/OF (and DS/PSP/DEAV for armored vehicles) approval is required for all vehicle transfers into or from the Department of State and ICASS fleets. The request for approval (found in the motor vehicle request module in ILMS) must provide a complete description of the vehicle, including standard and optional equipment, accumulated mileage, and condition. The request must state which vehicle the transferred vehicle is intended to replace within post’s inventory. If the vehicle is a net fleet increase, justification and a fleet survey report must be submitted as part of the transfer request.\n\nc. In instances where a non-U.S. Government entity offers to replace a vehicle damaged from local circumstances such as natural disaster or civil strife, the vehicle must be inspected by the:\n\n(1) RSO, security engineering officer (SEO), or the security technical specialist (STS) for security requirements; and\n\n(2) MVAO or appropriate employee for suitability and safety requirements. Then A/LM/PMP/OF must approve. Complete details relating to the circumstances behind the replacement must be provided, including a full description of the vehicle proposed as a replacement, and a copy of Form DS-132, Property Disposal Authorization and Survey Report.\n\nd. For other agencies: Title (ownership) to other U.S. Government agency owned personal property, including motor vehicles, remains with that owning agency when DOS post property disposal officer conducts competitive sales under ICASS services for the owning U.S. Government agency. In rare circumstance, when owning agency does not have an employee at post, DOS support staff may take custodial control of the property while conducting competitive public sale.\n\n14 FAM 436.4 Vehicle Standardization Policy\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. Department policy requires full and open competition in all vehicle procurements (GSA-approved sources excluded). Therefore, vehicles are provided to posts based on vehicle type rather than specific make and model. Posts that have an approved standardization for a specific make and model (see Department of State Acquisition Regulation - DOSAR 606.370) may limit their acquisitions to that make and model; however, competition must still be sought among various sources that provide that make and model. A standardization agreement does not exempt post from applicable statutory price limitations, pertaining to passenger vehicles (e.g., sedans and station wagons). NOTE: Posts may not standardize foreign vehicles.\n\nb. USAID: See ADS Chapter 534 and 536, which provides specific guidance for posts wishing to standardize a particular make of vehicle.\n\n14 FAM 436.5 Recording Official Vehicles as Capitalized Assets in ILMS-AM/MV\n\n(CT:LOG-366; 01-25-2023)\n\n(State/USAID)\n\na. All State Department on-road motor vehicles are capitalized assets, whether purchased through GSA or locally, and must be tracked as accountable property using ILMS. Motor vehicle assets must be recorded in the ILMS-Asset Management module (ILMS/AM) no more than five business days after State takes ownership, including those received but not yet in service, vehicles acquired without prior approval from OF (including used vehicles), or vehicles exceeding post’s target fleet size. To the extent possible, the asset records for locally purchased vehicles should be created via the ILMS Final Receipt module by post’s receiving clerk. For locally acquired vehicles, including transfers from other Federal agencies, post must attach a certificate of origin, title, or similar document containing the vehicle’s identification number (VIN) to the ILMS AM record.\n\nb. All armored vehicles belonging to the Department, as well as to all other agencies and departments under the security responsibility of the chief of mission, must be entered into ILMS.\n\nc. For post-procured vehicles: The MVAO or designee is responsible for creating a vehicle’s asset record through the Final Receipt module in ILMS and must validate the data to be recorded, i.e., acquisition cost, make, model, etc. Posts are also responsible for maintaining purchase documentation for all offshore vehicle purchases including:\n\n(1) Form DS-2076, Purchase Order, or Form OF-347, Order for Supplies or Services;\n\n(2) Form DS-0127, Receiving and Inspection Report, or completion of the receiving portion of Form DS-2076;\n\n(3) Vendor invoice;\n\n(4) Vehicle title; and\n\n(5) Waiver justification.\n\nd. For A/LM/PMP/OF purchased vehicles: The Overseas Fleet Division staff will create the inventory records for all vehicles purchased through GSA AutoChoice and received in Washington, DC. for shipment to posts. Once created, posts will have direct access to the asset record through the MV worksheet in ILMS and can use it to modify and dispose of vehicles.\n\ne. USAID only: The Agency must adhere to the reporting requirements established in ADS Chapters 534 and 629.\n\n14 FAM 436.6 Funding for Vehicles\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. State only: Funding for ICASS vehicles is provided through the ICASS budget process. For ICASS armored vehicles, ICASS councils are required to fund the base vehicle and shipment to post. DS only funds the armoring costs for ICASS armored vehicles. Armored vehicles for DS programs are fully funded by DS, to include the base, armoring, and shipment costs. Vehicles for non-DS programs are funded by the offices requiring their dedicated use (e.g., INL, OBO, regional bureaus).\n\nb. USAID: Refer to ADS Chapter 536 for guidance on criteria covering USAID motor pool fleets.\n\n14 FAM 436.7 Disposal of Official Vehicles and Miscellaneous\n\n14 FAM 436.7-1 Methods of Disposal\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. State only: Posts must notify and obtain pre-approval from A/LM/PMP/OF and the respective program office (such as Diplomatic Security or Overseas Buildings Operations) to dispose of all program-funded armored and nonarmored vehicles.\n\nb. Normally, vehicles are to be sold on a competitive basis as replacement property. An exception involves all armored vehicles (see 14 FAM 417.2 and 12 FAM 388). Replacement vehicles must be disposed.\n\nc. Disposal of vehicles should be accomplished within six weeks after receipt of disposal authorization from A/LM/PMP/OF or assignment of an \"eliminate\" final action during a VAM study. If disposal action cannot be completed within two months, the MVAO should notify the owning agency, explaining the reason for delay and describing corrective action.\n\nd. The DS/PSP/DEAV SharePoint site contains standard operating procedures for armored vehicle disposal.\n\ne. USAID only: See ADS Chapter 534 for the policies and procedures for disposing of USAID OE and program-funded vehicles.\n\n14 FAM 436.7-2 Proceeds of Sale\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. Funds for purchase of vehicles are obtained through Congressional appropriations or indirectly through Working Capital Fund operations. Sale proceeds must be deposited back into those respective accounts in accordance with instructions provided by the owning agency, or the ICASS Working Capital Fund as applicable.\n\nb. For all State nonarmored vehicles: Complete Form DS-132 in ILMS-AM as documentation. The ILMS-AM asset record should show the vehicle as disposed within five business days after possession of the vehicle has passed to the new owner.\n\n14 FAM 437 Records and reports\n\n14 FAM 437.1 Accountability, Use, Fuel, and Maintenance Records\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\na. Accountability, use, fuel, and maintenance records must be kept on file in ILMS (including FMIS) for all official vehicles, including USAID-owned vehicles under the control and use of a post’s motor pool section. Post must set up preventive maintenance intervals and schedules in FMIS for all armored and nonarmored vehicles. This data must be routinely reviewed for effective fleet management and management controls. All maintenance work orders must be entered in FMIS within 72 hours of work completion.\n\nb. All individual fueling transactions and corresponding odometer readings must be logged in FMIS within 30 calendar days.\n\nc. USAID only: The overseas vehicle inventory is maintained in ILMS. USAID’s annual inventory report is certified by the EXO and/or their designate. USAID’s CFO requirement for the quarterly capitalized asset depreciation report and M/MS/OMD’s annual vehicle inventory reporting requirements are managed within ILMS. The vehicle records (formerly Form AID 5-197, Motor Vehicle Record) for USAID-funded vehicles are electronically maintained in ILMS. All vehicle acquisitions and disposals must be recorded in ILMS within five days of receipt or disposal of a vehicle. Vehicle disposal documentation (Form AID 534-1) must be properly completed and provided to M/MS/OMD for all vehicle disposals.\n\n14 FAM 437.2 Daily Vehicle Use Record\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\nOperators of official motor vehicles must use, as required in subparagraphs below, either the Daily Vehicle Use Record (parts 1 and 2) or a Driver Trip Ticket Report to document vehicle use:\n\n(1) Non-dispatched Vehicles: Operators of dedicated and ICASS utility vehicles must complete and sign the Daily Vehicle Use Record which consists of Part-1 Trip Record and Part-2 Driver's Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist:\n\n(a) Program offices with dedicated vehicles and operators of ICASS utility vehicles must return completed Daily Vehicle Use Records (parts 1 and 2) to the office supervisor or designee. The supervisor should review the tickets as needed to confirm appropriate vehicle usage;\n\n(b) Daily Vehicle Use Records (parts 1 and 2) for all dedicated and ICASS utility vehicles must be retained for three (3) years; and\n\n(c) Maintenance issues reported on a Driver’s Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist must be entered onto a work order in the Maintenance Module of the FMIS application for resolution before the vehicle is used again for transportation purposes; and\n\n(2) Dispatched Vehicles: Operators of dispatched vehicles must complete a Driver Trip Ticket Report (printed from FMIS or on the mobile app) for each trip and a Driver’s Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist must be completed daily before operating the assigned vehicle. In cases where a vehicle is unexpectedly used outside of normal business hours and a Driver Trip Ticket Report and Driver’s Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist cannot be obtained, a hard copy of the Daily Vehicle Use Record (parts 1 and 2) may be used to track the information so it can be entered into FMIS the next business day:\n\n(a) Operators of dispatched vehicles must return the completed Driver Trip Ticket Report and Driver’s Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist to post dispatchers by the end of the day;\n\n(b) Dispatchers must record trip information from the Driver Trip Ticket Report in the FMIS Dispatch Module as soon as practicable or no less than the next business day after trip completion; and\n\n(c) Maintenance issues reported on a Driver’s Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist must be entered in the Maintenance Module in FMIS for resolution before the vehicle is dispatched again for transportation purposes; and\n\n(3) Armored Vehicles: In addition to completing the Driver’s Daily and Weekly Preventative Maintenance Checklist, drivers must inspect the wheels and tires, to include a pressure check with gauge for each tire, before operation; and\n\n(4) Agriculture only: The detailed information required above may be maintained in a hardbound book with nonremovable pages.\n\n14 FAM 437.3 Annual Motor Vehicle Inventories\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State/USAGM/USAID/Commerce/Agriculture)\n\nThe mandatory requirements for completing an annual physical inventory of motor vehicles worldwide follow:\n\n(1) The physical inventory process of all State program and ICASS motor vehicles worldwide must start no earlier than October 1, and the inventory of the on-hand motor vehicle report must be submitted to the Property Management Division (A/LM/PMP/PM) by March 15 through the Certification Submission Center (CSC) of the same fiscal year to ensure financial integrity;\n\n(2) The inventory of the on-hand vehicle report reflects all State program and ICASS vehicles authorized at post and must be generated through the Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS);\n\n(3) Post personnel conducting the annual inventory must account for all vehicles and where there are discrepancies, they must adjust the MV records through the ILMS-AM/MV module;\n\n(4) The A/LM/PMP/OF regional desk officers review and conduct quality assurance and quality control of the on-hand motor vehicle inventory report through the CSC module; and\n\n(5) USAID only: The Overseas Vehicle Inventory is reported online via the Financial Data Collection Tool – Quarterly Vehicle Inventory Report. The report is certified by the EXO and/or their designee. This report fulfills the CFO requirement for the Quarterly Capitalized Asset report for vehicles only and the M/MS/OMD annual requirement for an Overseas Vehicle Inventory Report.\n\n14 FAM 437.4 Motor Vehicle Survey\n\n(CT:LOG-349; 05-25-2022)\n\n(State Only)\n\nThe MVAO or designee must complete the motor vehicle survey in ILMS by October 31 for all Department of State vehicles annually in ILMS by both the supervisory and constituent posts each year.
