Contains the FLHSMV crash data post-processed by FDOT to provide location coordinates and roadway data that allow users to integrate roadway and traffic characteristics/contributing factors to crashes, to support safety analyses and studies, systemic crash analysis. Fatal and serious injury crashes are post-processed immediately upon receipt from FLHSMV.\n\nChallenges: Over 500,000 crashes per year must be post-processed, so the location verification for non-fatal, non-serious injury crashes may take a few months, which may be a challenge for safety analysis requiring accurate location information for all crash severity levels. Does not include short forms and only shows locations that have been post-processed by FDOT.\n\nAddressing this challenge: Currently the CAR System is being upgraded to merge with Signal 4, so the fatal and serious injury level crash locations will soon be immediately available in one system, and the speed of the processing of the data will be faster.\n\nOpen Data Hub\n\nhttps://gis-fdot.opendata.arcgis.com/\n\nAccess: Publicly available\n\nPurpose/contents:\n\nTo provide in GIS format for analysts\n\nGIS data portal for exploring and downloading open geospatial data\n\nContains crash data on all public roads in addition to other geospatial data from FDOT SSOGIS\n\nTypes of crashes: All traffic crashes reported by law enforcement\n\nRoadway types: All public roads\n\nMapping and/or analytics capabilities:\n\nPerforms heat mapping\n\nOverlay GIS layers for visual analysis\n\nExports Excel and Shape files\n\nCan link data to other applications\n\nLatest date of information: Displays all location verified data from FDOT for fatal and serious injury crashes, refreshes weekly on weekends (other severity levels post-processed and available within 10 months)\n\nData source: Crash Analysis Reporting (CAR) System (FLHSMV data post-processed by FDOT to support safety analyses)\n\nMaintained by: FDOT\n\nAdvantages: Publicly available mapping and query tool, with access to additional data layers for analysis. Contains the FLHSMV crash data post-processed by FDOT to provide location coordinates and roadway data that allow users to integrate roadway and traffic characteristics/contributing factors to crashes, to support safety analyses and studies, systemic crash analysis.
