        "text": "Everything you need to know to pass your tests is located in these sections. It is important that you study the material for each topic. Sample questions are provided to help you test your knowledge.\n\nOn This Page\n\nSigns\n\nTraffic Signals\n\nSample Test Questions\n\nYou must obey all official signs, signals, and markings unless you see a police officer or road worker redirecting traffic.\n\nSigns\n\nSigns often use symbols or pictures rather than words. Each type of sign has a special color and shape to help you easily recognize the sign at a glance.\n\nRegulatory Signs—Prohibitive\n\nTraffic signs that prohibit certain actions or movements are red in color and increase safety by controlling the flow of traffic through intersections.\n\nStop—Octagon\n\nThis sign means you must come to a complete stop. Yield to other vehicles and stop and stay stopped for pedestrians crossing in marked or unmarked crosswalks. When it is safe, you may enter the intersection.\n\nYield—Triangle\n\nThis sign means you should reduce speed and yield right of way. If needed, stop the same as you would for a stop sign.\n\nDo Not Enter—Square\n\nThis sign warns you not to enter a road or freeway. You will see this sign if you are going the wrong way. Study For Your Tests\n\nThe signs below prohibit certain actions. When you see a sign with a red circle and a slash mark, it means do not make the turn shown.\n\nRegulatory Signs—Other\n\nRegulatory signs are rectangular with black words or symbols on a white background and tell you what to do. They are posted at or near where the requirement applies. Not all regulatory signs are shown here.\n\nSpeed Limit\n\nThis indicates the maximum speed in miles per hour. Signs may be electronic and may change based on current conditions.\n\nOne Way\n\nTraffic flows only in the direction of the arrow.\n\nRight Turn Permitted Without Stopping\n\nThis sign may appear below a stop sign. Traffic turning right may turn without stopping. Other traffic must stop and yield right of way.\n\nLane-Use Control\n\nThese signs are used where turns are required or permitted from lanes as shown.\n\nKeep Right\n\nA traffic island, median or obstruction divides the road ahead. Keep to the right.\n\nCenter Lane Turn Only\n\nShare the center lane for left turns from both directions\n\nDo Not Pass\n\nThis sign indicates that you may not pass.\n\nNo Turn on Red\n\nYou may not turn during the red light. You must wait for the signal to turn green.\n\nHigh Occupancy Vehicle\n\nThe lane is reserved for vehicles carrying at least two or more persons as noted on the sign. A white diamond may be painted on the lane.\n\nLeft Turn Yield on Green:\n\nOn a green circular signal, yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic and pedestrians until it is safe to turn.\n\nStop Here for Pedestrians:\n\nThis sign may appear near a crosswalk. Stop at the stop line when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk.\n\nWarning Signs\n\nWarning signs are yellow and alert you to known possible hazards or a change in road conditions ahead. As a driver, you are ultimately responsible for recognizing and reacting correctly to changing conditions, signed or not. Not all warning signs are shown here.\n\nPedestrian Crossing\n\nBe alert for people crossing your path. These signs may include a flashing yellow beacon that indicates a pedestrian is crossing, has recently crossed or is about to cross.\n\nMultiuse Path Crossing\n\nBicyclists and pedestrians regularly cross the road in the area.\n\nIn-Street Pedestrian Crossing\n\nThis sign may appear at a crosswalk. Stop when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk.\n\nCurve\n\nThere is a curve ahead.\n\nSharp Turn\n\nThere is a sharp turn in the road ahead.\n\nChevron\n\nA sharp curve or change in the direction of the road is at the sign.\n\nWinding Road\n\nThe road contains a series of turns or curves.\n\nReversing Curves\n\nThe road ahead curves to the right, then left.\n\nCrossroad\n\nA four-way intersection is ahead. Cross traffic may enter the road.\n\nSide Road\n\nA “T” intersection is ahead. Traffic may enter the road from the left or right.\n\nMerge\n\nTraffic is merging from the side shown.\n\nAdd Lane\n\nTwo roadways join together. You do not need to merge.\n\nLane Reduction\n\nThe indicated lane ends soon. Vehicles in that lane must merge into the through lane.\n\nTwo-Way Traffic Ahead\n\nThe one-way road joins a two-way road ahead. You will be facing oncoming traffic.\n\nDivided Highway Begins or Ends\n\nThese signs indicate the beginning or end of a divided highway. Keep to the right.\n\nStop Ahead\n\nThere is a stop sign ahead. Slow down and prepare to stop.\n\nSignal Ahead\n\nA traffic signal is ahead. Slow down and be ready to stop.\n\nReduced Speed Limit Ahead\n\nA reduced speed limit is ahead. Prepare to slow down..\n\nRoundabout Ahead\n\nThere is a roundabout intersection ahead.\n\nRailroad Advance\n\nA railroad crossing is ahead. You may have to stop.\n\nLow Clearance\n\nThe overpass ahead has low clearance. Do not proceed if your vehicle is too tall to pass under it.\n\nHill\n\nA steep grade is ahead.\n\nAdvisory Speed\n\nAdvises the safe speed for freeway ramps and curves. This sign may be used with other signs. Signs may be electronic and may change based on current conditions.\n\nSlippery When Wet\n\nThe pavement is unusually slick when wet.\n\nDeer\n\nDeer often cross the road in this area. Be alert. Slow down if you see deer or other wildlife.\n\nRoute, Guide, and Information Signs\n\nRoute signs show you which route you are on and if the road is an interstate, U.S. route, or state highway.\n\nInterstate Route U.S. Route State Highway\n\nGuide or information signs are green. They give exit information or show the direction of roads or cities.\n\nThe number on an exit sign helps you know which exit to take.\n\nSafety Corridors\n\nSafety corridors are designated stretches of highway with more fatal and serious injury collisions than the statewide average. Turn on your lights for safety. Signs identifying safety corridors may include diamond shaped flags.\n\nHistoric, Cultural and Recreational Signs\n\nThese brown signs point to historic and cultural locations. They also point to scenic areas, picnic grounds, and parks.\n\nMotorist Service Signs\n\nThese blue signs tell you about services or facilities along the highway. These signs may indicate gas, food, and lodging are available at the next exit, a rest area is ahead, an electric vehicle charging station is available or a facility or parking area is accessible to a person with a disability. They can also indicate the road to a hospital.\n\nTraffic Signals\n\nTraffic signals control the right of way and provide for a smooth, orderly flow of traffic. If a signal appears dark, such as during a power failure, you should stop as if there are stop signs in all directions. When a traffic signal is out of order and flashes yellow or red, you must obey that signal.\n\nSteady/Circular Red\n\nA steady red signal means stop and remain stopped until the signal changes.\n\nYou are allowed to make the following turns on red after coming to a complete stop unless a sign or police officer states otherwise:\n\nWhen entering a two-way road, you may turn right.\n\nWhen entering a one-way road, you may turn right or left in the direction of the one-way road.\n\nFlashing Red or Dark Signal\n\nA flashing red or a dark signal is treated the same as a stop sign.\n\nRed Arrow\n\nA steady red arrow means stop and remain stopped until the signal changes, except for allowed turns on red. The same turns allowed for a steady red signal are allowed for a red arrow.\n\nSteady Yellow\n\nA steady yellow signal warns you that the signal is about to turn red. Stop before entering the intersection. If you cannot stop safely, drive carefully through it.\n\nFlashing Yellow\n\nA flashing yellow signal means slow down and proceed with caution.\n\nYellow Arrow\n\nA steady yellow arrow warns you that the signal is about to turn red. Stop before entering the intersection, or if you cannot stop safely, drive carefully through it.\n\nFlashing Yellow Arrow\n\nA flashing yellow arrow means that you may make the movement indicated by the arrow, but first you must yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic. Oncoming traffic has a steady green signal.\n\nSteady Green\n\nA green signal means all movements—straight ahead, left or right turns—are permitted, unless prohibited by a sign. Left turns must first yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic. Right turns must first yield to pedestrians.\n\nGreen Arrow\n\nA steady green arrow means you have the right of way and may make the movement indicated by the arrow.\n\nSample Test Questions\n\nWhat does this sign mean?\n\nCurves ahead.\n\nSlippery when wet.\n\nObstacle in the road.\n\nRegulatory Prohibitive signs are red and white. Which one of these signs is a regulatory prohibitive sign?\n\nDo Not Enter.\n\nRailroad Advance.\n\nHospital Ahead.\n\nIf a traffic signal is dark because of a power outage, you should:"
