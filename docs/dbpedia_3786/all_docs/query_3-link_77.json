        "text": "All drivers in New Jersey must provide proof of insurance when operating any vehicle. Failure to do so can result in hefty fines and suspension. Having insurance is just as important as having a title on your car or registering it with the MVC.\n\nAll vehicles registered in New Jersey require three types of mandatory insurance:\n\nLiability insurance pays others for damages that you cause if you are responsible for an accident. It does not cover medical expenses.\n\nPersonal injury protection (PIP) pays medical expenses if you or other persons covered under your policy are injured in an automobile accident. Often called No Fault coverage, it pays your medical expenses if you were or were not at fault.\n\nUninsured motorist coverage protects you if you are in an accident with someone who doesn’t have proper insurance coverage.\n\nContact your insurance company for the different insurance coverage choices or check the Department of Banking and Insurance web site\n\nSee a list of approved companies approved to write automobile liability insurance in the State of New Jersey.\n\nRequired documents\n\nYour insurance company must issue you a paper or electronic New Jersey Insurance Identification Card for each vehicle under your policy. N.J.S.A. 39:3-29. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:3-29.1 and N.J.A.C. 11:3-6.1 â 6.5, New Jersey insurance identification cards must meet the following specifications:\n\nThe dimensions of the paper card must be between three inches by five inches and five and a half inches by eight and a half inches;\n\nThe white cardstock must be at least 20 lbs in weight; and\n\nThe front of the card must contain the insurance company’s name, the insured’s name and address, the policy number, effective date, expiration date, vehicle description (make, model and VIN), the heading “State of New Jersey Insurance Identification Card,” the insurance company code, and the name and address of the insurance company or the office or agency issuing the identification card. The reverse of the card shall include the address established by the insurer for the filing of notification of the commencement of medical treatment by treating medical providers.\n\nIn New Jersey, the insurance identifiction card may be displayed or provided in either paper or electronic form. For these purposes, \"electronic form\" means the display of images on an electronic device, such as a celular telephone, tablet or computer. Paper insurance card specifications have not changed.\n\nYou must keep the card in the vehicle, or be able to produce the electronic format:\n\nBefore an inspection.\n\nWhen involved in an accident.\n\nWhen stopped for a traffic violation.\n\nWhen you are stopped in a spot check by a police officer.\n\nFailure to present the card or electronic form may result in fines.\n\nDriving an uninsured vehicle may result in fines, community service, license suspension and insurance surcharges.\n\nInsurance fraud\n\nInsurance fraud is defined as providing false information to an insurance company while making a claim or submitting an insurance application, resulting in:\n\nIncarceration.\n\nUp to $15,000 in civil fines for each violation.\n\nLoss of driver license.\n\nHow to report fraud\n\nTo help the Office of Insurance Fraud Prosecutor (OIFP), report fraud by e-mail, online or by calling (877) 55-FRAUD (553-7283). Fraud increases the cost of insurance for all New Jersey drivers â please don't hesitate if you suspect something.\n\nAll tips are kept strictly anonymous and confidential."
