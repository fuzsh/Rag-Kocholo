Overall, rates of motor vehicle traffic deaths decreased from 14.7 per 100,000 in 1999, stabilized (with a low point of 10.3 in 2014), and then increased in recent years to 11.1 in 2019. Rates were higher for males than for females throughout the period. In 2019, the rate for males (16.0) was roughly 2.5 times that for females (6.3). Although rates declined for all age groups from 1999 through 2019, the pace of change differed for each group. For example, the rate for males aged 15–24 in 1999 (35.0) was 1.7 times that for males aged 25–64 (20.6). By 2019, the rate for males aged 15–24 (19.0) was lower than that for males aged 25–64 (19.7) and 65 and over (21.8). For females, the rates for those aged 15–24 (15.7) and 65 and over (15.8) were similar in 1999 and then decreased to 8.2 and 9.3, respectively, in 2019. In 2019, persons aged 65 and over had the highest rates for both males and females.\n\nThroughout the study period, rates were highest for motor vehicle occupants compared with other types of road users (i.e., motorcyclists, pedal cyclists, and pedestrians). The rates for motor vehicle occupants decreased 37% from 12.0 in 1999 to 7.6 in 2019. Rates for motorcyclists doubled from 0.8 in 1999 to 1.6 in 2007, then remained stable in recent years. Rates for pedal cyclists were stable over the study period, while rates for pedestrians increased from 1.7 in 1999 to 2.0 in 2019.\n\nData source and methods\n\nNVSS multiple cause-of-death mortality data from 1999–2019 (6) were used to examine motor vehicle traffic deaths by sex, age group, and type of road user. Numbers and rates from analysis of NVSS mortality data might differ from those obtained from analysis of data from the National Highway Traffic Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) due to differences in case inclusion criteria, reporting sources, and other factors (7).\n\nMotor vehicle traffic deaths were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD–10) underlying cause-of-death codes (8) V02–V04 (.1, .9), V09.2, V12–V14 (.3–.9), V19 (.4–.6), V20–V28 (.3–.9), V29–V79 (.4–.9), V80 (.3–.5), V81.1, V82.1, V83–V86 (.0–.3), V87 (.0–.8), and V89.2. These codes include deaths to motor vehicle occupants, pedestrians, pedal cyclists (bicyclists), motorcyclists, and other road users from injuries sustained in an unintentional motor vehicle-related event that occurred on a public roadway (traffic). Deaths of motor vehicle occupants were identified using ICD–10 codes V30–V79 (.4–.9), V83–V86 (.0–.3), V87 (.0–.8), and V89.2. Codes V87 (.0–.8) and V89.2 were included as motor vehicle occupants based on a comparison of FARS and NVSS data that suggested that unspecified road users are likely occupants (7). Deaths of motorcyclists were identified using ICD–10 codes V20–V28 (.3–.9) and V29 (.4–.9); pedal cyclists, V12–V14 (.3–.9) and V19 (.4–.6); and pedestrians, V02–V04 (.1, .9) and V09.2.\n\nAge-adjusted death rates were calculated using the direct method and adjusted to the 2000\n\nstandard population (9). Trends in age-adjusted death rates were evaluated using the Joinpoint Regression Program (Version 4.8.0.1) (10). Joinpoint software fitted weighted least-squares regression models to the rates on the log transform scale (11) . The permutation tests for model (number of joinpoints) significance were set at an overall alpha level of 0.05 (11). Pairwise comparisons of rates (e.g., age-adjusted rates for males compared with females) were conducted using the z test with an alpha level of 0.05 (9).\n\nAbout the authors\n\nMerianne Rose Spencer, Holly Hedegaard, and Matthew Garnett are with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Division of Analysis and Epidemiology.\n\nReferences\n\nOlaisen RH, Rossen LM, Warner M, Anderson RN.
