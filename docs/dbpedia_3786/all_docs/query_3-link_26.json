        "text": "What Air Traffic Controllers Do About this section\n\nAir traffic controllers coordinate the movement of aircraft, including within the vicinity of airports and between altitude sectors and control centers, so that they maintain safe distances.\n\nDuties\n\nAir traffic controllers typically do the following:\n\nMonitor and direct the movement of aircraft on the ground and in the air\n\nControl all ground traffic at airport runways and taxiways\n\nIssue takeoff and landing instructions to pilots\n\nTransfer control of departing flights to other traffic control centers and accept control of arriving flights\n\nInform pilots about weather, runway closures, and other critical information\n\nAlert airport response staff in the event of an aircraft emergency\n\nAir traffic controllers’ primary concern is safety, but they also must direct aircraft efficiently to minimize delays. They manage the flow of aircraft into and out of the airport airspace, guide pilots during takeoff and landing, and monitor aircraft as they travel through the skies. Air traffic controllers use radio equipment to communicate with pilots. They also use radar, computers, and other visual references to monitor and direct aircraft movement in the skies and on airport grounds.\n\nControllers usually manage multiple aircraft at the same time. For example, a controller might direct one aircraft on its landing approach while providing another aircraft with weather information.\n\nThe following are examples of types of air traffic controllers:\n\nTower controllers direct the movement of aircraft and other vehicles, such as snowplows, on runways and taxiways. They check flight plans, give pilots clearance for takeoff or landing, and direct the flow of aircraft and ground traffic in their area of responsibility. Most observe from control towers, managing traffic from the airport to a radius of 3 to 30 miles out.\n\nApproach and departure controllers ensure that aircraft traveling within an airport’s airspace maintain minimum separation for safety. These controllers give pilots clearances to enter controlled airspace and hand off control of aircraft to en route controllers. They also inform pilots about weather conditions and other critical notices. Terminal approach and departure controllers work in buildings known as Terminal Radar Approach Control Centers (TRACONs). They assist an aircraft until it reaches the edge of a facility’s airspace, usually about 20 to 50 miles from the airport and up to about 17,000 feet in the air.\n\nEn route controllers monitor aircraft that leave an airport’s airspace. They work at en route traffic control centers located throughout the country, which typically are not located at airports. Each center is assigned an airspace based on the geography and air traffic in the area in which it is located. As an aircraft approaches and flies through a center’s airspace, en route controllers guide it along its route. They may adjust the flight path for safety reasons, such as to avoid collision with another aircraft. En route controllers direct aircraft for the bulk of the flight before handing off oversight to terminal approach controllers.\n\nSome air traffic controllers work at the Air Traffic Control Systems Command Center, where they monitor traffic within the entire national airspace. When they identify a bottleneck, they provide instructions to other controllers to help prevent traffic jams. Their objective is to keep traffic levels manageable for the airports and for en route controllers.\n\nWork Environment About this section\n\nAir traffic controllers held about 23,000 jobs in 2022. The largest employers of air traffic controllers were as follows:\n\nFederal government 91% Support activities for air transportation 5\n\nMost controllers work for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nMost air traffic controllers work in control towers, approach control facilities, or en route centers. Many tower controllers and approach and departure controllers work near large airports. En route controllers work in secure office buildings across the country, which typically are not located at airports.\n\nMost controllers work in semidark rooms. The aircraft they control appear as points of light moving across their radar screens, and a well-lit room would make it difficult to see the screens properly.\n\nAir traffic controllers must remain focused and react quickly to conditions that change frequently. Being responsible for the safety of aircraft and their passengers may be stressful and exhausting. To prevent burnout, the FAA requires controllers to retire at age 56.\n\nWork Schedules\n\nMost air traffic controllers work full time. The FAA regulates the hours that an air traffic controller may work. Controllers may not work more than 10 straight hours during a shift, which includes required breaks, and must have 9 hours of rest before their next shift.\n\nMajor airports may operate control towers on a 24-hour basis. Controllers who work at these facilities may work day, evening, or night shifts that include weekends and holidays. Small airports or those that are less busy may have towers that do not operate around the clock. Controllers at these facilities may have standard work schedules.\n\nHow to Become an Air Traffic Controller About this section\n\nThere are several different paths to becoming an air traffic controller. Candidates typically need an associate's or bachelor’s degree through a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) program, several years of progressively responsible work experience, or a combination of education and experience.\n\nIn addition, prospective air traffic controllers must be U.S. citizens and must pass a medical evaluation, background check, and FAA preemployment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA). They also must complete a training course at the FAA Academy and apply before the FAA's age cutoff.\n\nOnce hired, controllers typically complete on-the-job training that lasts more than 12 months. They also must pass a physical exam each year, a job performance exam twice a year, and periodic drug screenings.\n\nEducation\n\nAir traffic controllers typically need an associate's or a bachelor's degree. To qualify with an associate's degree, candidates must complete their studies in an AT-CTI program. A bachelor's degree may be in any field, including transportation, business, or engineering.\n\nThe FAA sets guidelines for schools that offer the AT-CTI program. AT-CTI schools offer 2- or 4-year degrees that are designed to prepare students for a career in air traffic control. The curriculum is not standardized, but courses focus on subjects that are fundamental to aviation, including airspace, clearances, chart reading, and federal regulations.\n\nTraining\n\nMost newly hired air traffic controllers are trained at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. The length of training varies with the candidate’s background. Candidates must apply before the FAA's age cutoff.\n\nAfter graduating from the Academy, trainees are assigned to an air traffic control facility as developmental controllers until they complete requirements for becoming a certified air traffic controller. Developmental controllers begin their careers by supplying pilots with basic flight data and airport information. They then may advance to positions within the control room that have more responsibility.\n\nWith additional training, controllers may switch from one area of specialization to another. For example, a controller may complete training to transfer from working in an en route center to an airport tower.\n\nOther Experience\n\nAir traffic controllers sometimes qualify through work experience instead of a degree. Candidates either need up to 3 years of progressively responsible generalized work experience that demonstrates the potential for learning and performing air traffic control work or must have specialized work experience in a military or civilian air traffic control facility.\n\nAir traffic controllers who learn their skills in the military are eligible to become civilian air traffic controllers even if their age exceeds the FAA cutoff for applicants.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nAll air traffic controllers must hold an Air Traffic Control Tower Operator Certificate or be appropriately qualified and supervised as stated in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 65.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCommunication skills. Air traffic controllers must be able to give clear, concise instructions, listen carefully to pilots’ requests, and respond by speaking clearly in English.\n\nDecision-making skills. Controllers must make quick decisions. For example, when a pilot requests a change of altitude to avoid poor weather, the controller must respond quickly to ensure the aircraft’s safety.\n\nDetail oriented. Controllers must be able to concentrate while multiple conversations occur at once. For example, in a large airport tower, several controllers may be speaking with different pilots at the same time.\n\nMath skills. Controllers must be able to do arithmetic accurately and quickly. They often need to compute speeds, times, and distances, and they recommend heading and altitude changes.\n\nOrganizational skills. Controllers must be able to coordinate the actions of multiple flights and to prioritize tasks, because they may be required to guide several pilots at the same time.\n\nProblem-solving skills. Controllers must be able to understand complex situations, review changing circumstances, and provide pilots with appropriate alternatives.\n\nTeamwork. Controllers must be able to work as members of a team, cooperating with and assisting others in and around their area of responsibility.\n\nPay About this section\n\nAir Traffic Controllers\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2023\n\nAir traffic controllers\n\n$137,380\n\nAir transportation workers\n\n$97,320\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n$48,060\n\nThe median annual wage for air traffic controllers was $137,380 in May 2023. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $76,190, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $200,990.\n\nIn May 2023, the median annual wages for air traffic controllers in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:\n\nFederal government $146,540 Support activities for air transportation 81,110\n\nThe salaries for development controllers increase as they complete successive levels of training. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the salaries for more advanced controllers who have completed on-the-job training varies with the location of the facility, the complexity of the flight paths, and other factors. A full explanation of the pay ranges for air traffic controllers can be found on the FAA Pay & Benefits page.\n\nMost air traffic controllers work full time. The FAA regulates the hours that an air traffic controller may work.
