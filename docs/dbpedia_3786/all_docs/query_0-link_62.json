        "text": "A road classification system designates streets into different groups or classes according to the type of service each group is intended to provide. This is a fundamental tool for urban development and road management. Grouping roads with similar functions can improve transportation planning, road infrastructure design, maintenance, traffic and road operations.\n\nBut while road classification can help meet the needs of communities for transportation services, just as importantly, it can help protect against the adverse impacts of motorized traffic in neighbourhoods. Some roads should carry higher volumes of traffic at higher speeds, while others (the majority) carry lower volumes at lower speeds. This allows neighbourhoods to flourish between main traffic corridors. The absence of a hierarchy of roads would result in less efficient routes for traffic with associated increases in the time and cost of transporting people (whether by foot, bike, bus or car) and goods. The quality of urban life would also decline as motorized traffic would increasingly infiltrate into neighbourhoods to avoid mounting congestion.\n\nEvery street owned by the City of Toronto has been given one of five classifications (with the exception of public laneways)."
