Unfortunately, each year thousands of Missouri citizens are involved in automobile accidents with drivers who have not maintained the required automobile insurance. This results in unpaid damage claims and higher insurance premium rates for all Missourians.\n\nMissouri motor vehicle owners are required to show proof of insurance when registering a vehicle and renewing their license plates. Liability insurance covers your legal liability when injuries or property damage happen as a result of your actions. The minimum level of coverage required by state law is:\n\n$25,000 per person for bodily injury\n\n$50,000 per accident for bodily injury\n\n$25,000 per accident for property\n\nThe law also requires you to have uninsured motorist coverage of $25,000 for bodily injury per person and $50,000 for bodily injury per accident.\n\nNonresidents must maintain insurance that conforms to the requirements of the laws of their state.\n\nYou must keep some proof of insurance in your vehicle at all times. If a law enforcement officer asks for proof of insurance and you cannot show it, the officer may issue you a ticket.\n\nThe Department of Revenue will be notified that you do not have insurance on your vehicle or the vehicle you drive if you are in an accident or a police officer asks you to show proof of insurance. At any time, the Department of Revenue may also ask you to prove you have insurance.\n\nTypes of Insurance\n\nStatutory reference: Section 303.160, RSMo.\n\nMissouri Residents\n\nThere are three ways you can meet the requirements of the insurance law. For each type of insurance, you will receive an insurance identification card that must be kept in the vehicle at all times. You must have one of the following in effect on each motor vehicle you own or operate:\n\nA motor vehicle liability insurance policy that meets the minimum liability insurance limits of â25/50/25â. Contact an insurance agent for further details.\n\nProof of financial responsibility filed with the Department of Revenue.\n\nA certificate of self-insurance (for a Company or Religious Organization) issued by the Missouri Department of Revenue.\n\nNonresidents\n\nYou must maintain insurance that meets the requirements of the laws of your state.\n\nDrivers' Responsibilities\n\nIt is illegal to drive a motor vehicle in Missouri without automobile liability insurance. The vehicle driver must show proof of insurance to any law enforcement official, upon request, or a traffic ticket may be issued to the driver. Three things may occur for failing to show proof of insurance:\n\nThe court will send the conviction to the Driver License Bureau. The conviction will be entered on the driverâs driving record and four points will be assessed. It only takes a total of eight points within an 18-month period to lose your driving privilege in Missouri.\n\nThe court may enter an order of supervision. This order is sent to the Driver License Bureau so that the driver can be monitored to ensure automobile liability insurance is being maintained.\n\nThe court may enter an order suspending the driverâs driver license for failing to show proof of insurance. This order is sent to the Driver License Bureau at which time the driver is notified of the suspension of his or her driver license.\n\nMotor Vehicle Ownersâ Responsibilities\n\nMissouri law requires that all motor vehicle owners maintain some type of motor vehicle liability insurance coverage. Missouri residents are required to show proof of insurance when registering a motor vehicle or renewing their license plates. All motor vehicle owners must also keep proof of insurance in their vehicle(s). If a law enforcement officer asks for proof of insurance and the driver cannot show it, the officer may issue both the driver and the owner a ticket.\n\nAt any time during the period of vehicle registration in Missouri, the Driver License Bureau may request that a vehicle owner show proof of insurance. If the vehicle owner cannot provide proof of insurance, a driver license suspension is imposed.\n\nSuspension/Reinstatement for Failure to Maintain Insurance\n\nStatutory references: Sections 303.042 through 303.044, RSMo.\n\nIf your driving privilege and/or license plates are suspended for not having insurance, the following suspension periods will apply:\n\n1st suspension = 0 days\n\n2nd suspension in two years = 90 days\n\n3rd and subsequent suspension = 1 year\n\nAfter you serve the period of suspension, your driver license and/or license plates can be reinstated if the Driver License Bureau receives the following:\n\n1st suspension\n\nProof of insurance\n\n$20 reinstatement fee\n\n2nd suspension\n\nProof of insurance\n\n$200 reinstatement fee\n\n3rd and subsequent suspension\n\nProof of insurance\n\n$400 reinstatement fee\n\nProof of insurance must be maintained and filed with the Department of Revenue for a period of three years following the end of the suspension. If you fail to maintain proof of insurance, the Driver License Bureau will again suspend your driver license and/or license plates. The suspension will remain in effect for the remainder of the three years unless you refile proof of insurance and pay a $20 reinstatement fee.\n\nNOTE: If an accident is involved, an SR-22 filing is required for proof of liability insurance. An identification card is not acceptable.\n\nInsurance Companiesâ Responsibilities and Penalties\n\nInsurance companies licensed to provide personal automobile insurance in Missouri are required to supply the Driver License Bureau with insurance information on drivers and vehicles principally garaged in Missouri that they insure.\n\nInsurance companies must update their file before the 7th working day of each month. This information is then used to determine the insurance status of Missouri motor vehicle owners and operators.\n\nWhat to do When Involved in an Accident\n\nYOU MUST STOP if you are involved in an accident. Leaving the scene of an accident is a crime. Move your vehicle if it may cause other drivers to have an accident. Otherwise, do not move your vehicle until a law enforcement officer tells you to.\n\nHelp anyone who is hurt.\n\nContact the police.\n\nUse flares, reflectors, or flashlights if the accident happened at night or in bad weather to warn other traffic.\n\nExchange name, address, driver license number, vehicle identification, license plate number, name of insurance company, and policy number with everyone involved.\n\nDo not leave the accident until a law enforcement officer tells you that you may.\n\nFiling an Accident Report\n\nStatutory reference: Section 303.040, RSMo.\n\nYou must report accidents that happen in Missouri to the Driver License Bureau if:\n\nThe accident happened less than one year ago,\n\nThe accident involved an uninsured motorist, and\n\nThe accident caused property damage costing more than $500, or someone was injured or killed.\n\nNOTE: If the accident did not cause $500 in property damage or personal injury or death, you may still file an accident report if there was an uninsured motorist involved. The bureau will only be able to take action under Section 303.041, RSMo (see below).\n\nYou can get a Motor Vehicle Accident Report form from:\n\nThis website, Motor Vehicle Accident Report (Form 1140);\n\nYour insurance company;\n\nThe Driver License Bureau; and/or\n\nAny license office.\n\nMail completed forms to:\n\nDriver License Bureau\n\n301 West High Street - Room 470\n\nPO Box 200\n\nJefferson City MO 65105-0200\n\nNotice of Suspension\n\nStatutory reference: Section 303.041, RSMo.\n\nIf the Director of Revenue determines that the operator or owner of a motor vehicle involved in an accident has not maintained liability insurance, the operator or owner, or both, will be mailed a Notice of Suspension. The notice will include the reason for suspension, effective date of suspension, and the procedure to request a hearing.\n\nSuspension for Failure to Maintain Insurance â Accident Involved\n\nStatutory references: Section 303.042 through 303.044, RSMo.\n\nIf your driving privilege and/or license plates are suspended for not having insurance and an accident was involved, the following suspension periods will apply:\n\n1st suspension = 0 days\n\n2nd suspension = 90 days\n\n3rd suspension = 1 year\n\nAfter the driver and/or owner serves the period of suspension, his or her driver license/license plates can be reinstated if the Driver License Bureau receives the following:\n\n1st suspension\n\nProof of liability insurance.
