        "text": "The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere contributes to climate change. The most prevalent of those gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), is released when fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) and the derivatives of oil that are frequently used to power transportation (namely, gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel) are burned. Climate change imposes costs on people and countries around the world, including the United States.\n\nTransportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and CO2 emissions represent roughly 97 percent of the global warming potential of all greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. Before the coronavirus pandemic, CO2 emissions from transportation had risen (in amount and as a share of emissions) for several years.\n\nIn this report, the Congressional Budget Office provides an overview of CO2 emissions and identifies the sources of those emissions in the transportation sector. The report also discusses factors that determine transportation-related emissions and presents the agency’s projections of their path over the next 10 years.\n\nCarbon Dioxide Emissions From Transportation and Other Sectors\n\nIn 2021, worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases from all sources amounted to 40.8 billion metric tons (BMT). Greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are estimated to account for almost one-sixth of that amount—6.4 BMT. Of those U.S. emissions, 5.0 BMT (or 80 percent) were CO2; methane, nitrous oxide, and other (mainly fluorinated) gases from agriculture, industry, energy production, and waste management accounted for the remaining amount.\n\nAbout 92 percent (or 4.6 BMT) of U.S. CO2 emissions stemmed from burning fossil fuels to produce energy. The remaining 8 percent of those emissions were unrelated to energy production; they resulted from industrial, agricultural, and waste management processes. Historically, about 15 percent of total CO2 emissions in the United States were offset by the net absorption of CO2 by the nation’s forests and soil.\n\nIn 2021, CO2 emissions from transportation in the United States totaled 1.7 BMT—the most from any sector of the economy. With CO2 emissions of 1.5 BMT, the electric power sector was the second largest source that year. (For more information about emissions in that sector, see Congressional Budget Office, Emissions of Carbon Dioxide in the Electric Power Sector [December 2022], www.cbo.gov/publication/58419.) Together, the remaining energy-­related sources—the industrial, residential, and commercial sectors—contributed an additional 1.4 BMT.\n\nTrends in Carbon Dioxide Emissions\n\nIn 2017, CO2 emissions from transportation, which had peaked in the mid-2000s, surpassed emissions from electric power. After the 2007–2009 recession, transportation-related emissions declined, but they had rebounded and were heading toward their prerecession peak when the pandemic hit in early 2020.\n\nTotal energy-related emissions of CO2 in the United States peaked in 2005 and declined by about 20 percent by 2021—an average reduction of roughly 0.07 BMT per year. Three-quarters of that reduction came from the electric power sector. Emissions from the transportation sector declined by 6 percent over the same period—an average of 0.01 BMT per year. That change accounted for only one-tenth of the overall reduction in energy-related emissions. The industrial, residential, and commercial sectors were responsible for the rest of the decline.\n\nWhereas reductions of emissions in the industrial sector may be offset by corresponding increases in emissions in other countries, reductions in the transportation sector are not likely to be. Policies that lower emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States but lead to offsetting increases in emissions elsewhere—say, by causing activity in carbon-intensive industries to shift to other countries—would leave global emissions (and thus climate change) largely unaffected.\n\nChallenges in Reducing Emissions From Transportation\n\nReductions in emissions from transportation have been harder to achieve than those in the electric power sector for three main reasons. First, the demand for transportation services is not very sensitive to the price of such services. Demand for transportation is built into the places that people live, work, and socialize and the places that businesses produce and sell their goods. Those locations can change, but such change typically happens slowly. Second, the transportation sector is overwhelmingly dependent on a single fossil fuel, petroleum. Although the price of petroleum is higher than that of other fossil fuels per unit of energy (in part because of the cost of refining it into usable fuels), few cost-effective alternatives are currently available. In fact, the price of embedded CO2 (what final users pay for energy per metric ton of CO2 released) in the transportation sector is more than twice the price in the other sectors. Third, people tend to own vehicles for a long time, delaying the effects of improvements in the fuel efficiency of new vehicles.\n\nThe difficulty in reducing transportation emissions can be illustrated by considering the effects on different sectors of an emissions tax—for example, one that would start at $25 per metric ton and grow at an inflation-adjusted rate of 5 percent per year. The transportation sector would experience a smaller reduction in CO2 emissions than other sectors would as a result of such a tax—a 3 percent reduction compared with a reduction of 34 percent in the electric power sector and of 6 percent in the industrial, residential, and commercial sectors combined, CBO estimates.\n\nSources of Transportation-Related Emissions\n\nPersonal vehicles—cars, light-duty trucks (including sport utility vehicles, crossover utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup trucks), and motorcycles—were responsible for 58 percent of emissions in the transportation sector in 2019. (Although data for 2020 were available, CBO used 2019 as its reference year because emissions in 2020 were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.) Emissions from commercial trucks and all buses accounted for 25 percent. Together, the following modes of transportation accounted for the remaining 17 percent: air (including commercial passenger aviation, general aviation, air cargo, and military aviation), pipelines (for which fuel is burned to power compressors that keep oil and natural gas flowing at a steady rate), rail (passenger railroads, rail transit, and freight railroads), and water (including ships and boats).\n\nThis report focuses on motor vehicles (personal vehicles as well as commercial trucks and buses) because they account for the bulk of emissions. But emissions reductions could be achieved in the other modes of transportation. For instance, improvements in aircraft design have led to emissions reductions in aviation, and alternative fuels could someday reduce emissions from other forms of transportation.\n\nThe figure below reflects all transportation regardless of whether people or goods are being transported; in the rest of this section, passenger and freight transportation are discussed separately.\n\nPassenger Transportation\n\nIn 2019, most passenger travel—81 percent of all passenger-miles—took place in personal vehicles. (A passenger-mile represents one person traveling one mile. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics cautions that the mileage may reflect some double-counting and may exclude small amounts of self-propelled travel from walking and biking.) For long-­distance travel, air travel was the primary alternative to motor vehicles; for local travel, bus and rail transit were the main alternatives.\n\nRail transit systems fall into two categories: heavy rail and light rail. Usually in urban centers and often underground, heavy-rail transit (commonly called a subway or metro) serves a large volume of passengers. Light-rail transit (such as streetcars and trolleys) serves fewer passengers than heavy rail and is typically at street level. Passenger railroads include Amtrak and commuter railroads, which operate on railroad tracks and typically provide service between the center of a metropolitan area and its outlying areas.\n\nEmissions From the Different Modes of Passenger Transportation\n\nIn 2019, CO2 emissions from personal vehicles averaged 0.47 pounds per passenger-mile. Average emissions from other modes of passenger transportation—heavy- and light-rail transit, passenger railroads, commercial air travel, and bus—were all lower per passenger-mile. Emissions from bus transportation averaged 0.39 pounds of CO2 per passenger-mile in 2019; that average encompasses several kinds of bus operations with varying emissions. Transit buses, for example, averaged 0.95 pounds per passenger-mile, largely because they often operated at only a fraction of their capacity. (Emissions per passenger-mile decline as the number of occupants increases.) Emissions of CO2 from intercity buses (including charter buses and tour buses, which are sometimes referred to as motorcoaches) were much lower, averaging 0.15 pounds per passenger-mile, slightly less than the average for rail transit.\n\nTraffic congestion and travel speeds, which are influenced by travel growth, can affect the efficiency with which motor vehicles burn fuel and produce emissions. An extra 0.04 BMT of greenhouse gases—about 2 percent of all transportation-related emissions—were emitted in 2019 as a result of congestion.\n\nDifferences in Emissions Within Modes of Passenger Transportation\n\nAverage emissions obscure substantial differences within each mode of transportation. Several factors—including vehicle size, average occupancy, the type of fuel used, and fuel efficiency—affect emissions per passenger-mile. Conventional cars typically have greater fuel economy than light duty trucks. Newer vehicles are usually more fuel efficient than older ones. And smaller vehicles get better mileage, on average, than larger ones. The most popular size car in 2020 emitted 0.60 pounds of CO2 per vehicle mile, whereas one category of large pickup trucks built in that year had average emissions that were nearly twice that amount—1.18 pounds of CO2 per vehicle mile.\n\nA transit system’s emissions depend on the average carbon content of the electricity used to power it (that is, the amount of CO2 released in the process of generating that electricity) as well as the system’s load factor (the percentage of the system’s seats that are filled, on average). Emissions from heavy-rail transit systems in 2019 varied greatly, ranging from 0.09 pounds of CO2 per passenger-mile to 0.99 pounds. Some public transportation systems may offer frequent service and a large network of routes to provide greater mobility for their users; those offerings can reduce a system’s load factor and thus increase its emissions per mile traveled.\n\nFreight Transportation\n\nEmissions from freight transportation depend on the weight of the cargo. In 2019, trucks carried 43 percent of all ton-miles; railroads, 29 percent; and pipelines and water transportation, most of the rest. (A ton-mile represents one ton of freight transported one mile.) Measured in terms of weight, air cargo accounted for less than 1 percent of freight transportation. (When the value of cargo is used instead of its weight to measure freight transportation, trucking still accounted for the largest share of such transportation. But whereas the weight of goods shipped by railroad exceeded that of goods shipped by air, the value of goods shipped by air was greater.)\n\nEmissions From the Different Modes of Freight Transportation\n\nCO2 emissions per ton-mile from the different modes of freight transportation vary greatly—far more than those from the different modes of passenger transportation. Per ton-mile, trucking produced more CO2 emissions, on average, than most other modes of freight transportation but far less than air cargo.\n\nTrends in Transportation Sector Emissions\n\nChanges in the volume of motor vehicle transportation and changes in vehicles’ fuel efficiency are the two factors that have most influenced emissions. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, improvements in the fuel economy of light-duty vehicles (that is, passenger cars and light-duty trucks) partially offset the substantial increase in vehicle miles traveled by road. In the mid-1980s, fuel economy plateaued and then decreased slightly as consumers shifted from traditional automobiles to less efficient trucks and sport utility vehicles; as a result, emissions generally rose as highway use increased.\n\nA two-decade stretch of travel growth from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s stopped with the 2007–2009 recession. Because of that break in the trend and further improvements in fuel economy, transportation emissions in 2019 were slightly lower than their prerecession high. Emissions fell sharply in 2020 as a result of the pandemic but rebounded in 2021.\n\nGrowth in Motor Vehicle Travel\n\nThe demand for passenger and freight transportation by motor vehicle has historically not been very sensitive to the cost of such transportation and has typically declined only during economic recessions. From 1990 to the mid-2000s, vehicle miles traveled by passenger and freight motor vehicles grew steadily. The 2007–2009 recession disrupted that long-term growth: Freight transportation by truck, in particular, fell—dropping by 14 percent from 2008 to 2011—before slowly climbing back toward its 2008 level.\n\nIn 2020, the growth of motor vehicle travel was temporarily reversed by the pandemic. As economic activity slowed and people traveled less during the first year of the pandemic, the number of vehicle miles traveled by passenger motor vehicles dropped by 12 percent.\n\nChanges in Fuel Economy\n\nCorporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) govern fuel consumption for light-duty vehicles. The standards require each auto manufacturer to meet annual targets for the fuel economy of its entire U.S. fleet, weighted to reflect the sales of different models. Those fleet-wide targets account for different standards for vehicles of different sizes. The fuel economy ratings that are used to determine compliance with CAFE standards are calculated using a series of laboratory tests of fuel consumption under specific conditions.\n\nEstimated “real-world” data about fuel economy and emissions are measured using tests that incorporate a wider range of conditions than those used to determine compliance with CAFE standards. That wider range of conditions—including hot and cold weather, higher speeds, and faster accelerations—better reflects the conditions the average driver is likely to encounter. The fuel economy values found on the window stickers of new cars, which are roughly 20 to 30 percent lower than the values used to determine compliance with CAFE standards, are based on the same tests as those used for the real-world data, though the calculations of the two measures differ slightly: Highway driving is weighted more heavily in the mix of driving between city and highway conditions used to calculate the real-world measure than it is in the calculation of the sticker value.\n\nAverage real-world fuel economy for new light-duty vehicles increased from an average of 20 miles per gallon in 2005 to an average of 25 miles per gallon in 2021. (By comparison, the average fuel economy of the largest trucks in service was 6 miles per gallon in 2019.) Emissions of carbon dioxide per vehicle mile for new light-duty vehicles dropped accordingly—from an average of 0.99 pounds per vehicle mile in 2005 to an average of 0.77 pounds per vehicle mile in 2021.\n\nProjections of Carbon Dioxide Emissions From Transportation\n\nDrawing on estimates from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and adjusting them for subsequent changes in relevant laws and regulations, CBO projects that transportation emissions of carbon dioxide will decline over the next decade as electric and other more fuel-efficient vehicles (including those produced in accordance with the 2022 increases to the CAFE standards for model years 2024, 2025, and 2026) constitute a larger share of the vehicle stock. The reductions in emission rates are projected to outweigh increases in vehicle miles traveled, reducing total CO2 emissions from transportation, on net. In CBO’s projections, transportation-related emissions of CO2 fall by 9 percent from 2021 to 2032—from 1.74 BMT to 1.59 BMT, which is 15 percent less than the 1.86 BMT of such emissions produced in 2005. (For a discussion of the method that CBO used to make its projections, see Appendix A.)\n\nChanges in Standards, Electric Vehicle Incentives, and Emissions\n\nIncreases in CAFE and greenhouse gas emissions standards and changes in incentives for purchasing electric vehicles take time to improve the average fuel economy of vehicles on the road because the stock of vehicles is replaced slowly. The average age of passenger vehicles driven in the United States is 12 years, so even several years after a new standard is adopted or electric vehicle sales are boosted, most vehicles on the road will still be older models that produce more emissions. In CBO’s projections, regulatory and legislative changes adopted in 2021 and 2022 result in transportation-related CO2 emissions in 2032 that are 0.16 BMT (or about 10 percent) lower than the agency estimates they would have been without those changes.\n\nFederal agencies are considering additional changes to CAFE and greenhouse gas emissions standards, but those plans have not been incorporated into CBO’s emissions projections because the proposals remain preliminary. In August 2022, NHTSA announced its intent to analyze the potential environmental impacts of new CAFE standards for passenger cars and light-duty trucks starting with model year 2027 and of new fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans starting with model year 2029. Similarly, EPA has begun work to establish new emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles for model years 2027 through 2030 or later.\n\nCAFE Standards\n\nCAFE standards were first applied to model year 1978 vehicles and increased through the early 1980s. The standards remained unchanged for many years thereafter. In accordance with energy legislation enacted in 2007, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration set higher standards, which were implemented in two phases, one for model years 2012 to 2016 and the second for model years 2017 to 2025.\n\nIssued in 2020, the Safer, Affordable, Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule replaced those standards with lower standards: Whereas the earlier Phase 2 standards required an increase in fuel economy of about 5 percent each year, the revised standards mandated a 1.5 percent increase each year starting in 2021 and were projected to result in an industry-wide average fleet fuel economy of about 40 miles per gallon in 2026. In 2022, NHTSA raised standards once again, bringing them closer to the original Phase 2 standards by requiring increases of 8 percent annually for model years 2024 and 2025 and an increase of 10 percent for model year 2026; NHTSA projected that those new standards would result in an industry-wide fleet average (among cars and light trucks) of approximately 49 miles per gallon in 2026.\n\nA fleet’s average fuel economy depends not only on the fuel economy of each model of car and truck but also on the mix of vehicles sold. Light-duty trucks, which include popular compact sport utility vehicles, represented only half of sales of new light-duty vehicles as recently as 2013 but outsold cars 3 to 1 by 2021. (Although only standards for light-duty vehicles are shown below, NHTSA has set additional Phase 2 standards that currently apply to commercial trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, and all buses and work trucks of model years 2021 to 2027.)\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Standards\n\nNew motor vehicles are also subject to greenhouse gas emissions standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act. For many years, EPA aligned its standards with NHTSA’s CAFE program, but the two sets of standards diverged with the latest regulatory changes announced by the agencies for the 2023–2026 period. EPA states that the model year 2026 emissions standard of 161 grams per mile is equivalent to a 55 mile per gallon fuel economy standard if the emissions standard was met solely by reducing tailpipe emissions. But manufacturers can reduce their emissions to meet the standard in a number of ways, including by producing alternative-fuel vehicles, improving the integrity and efficiency of air-conditioning systems, and implementing other technologies that improve the operating efficiency of their vehicles. (Such technologies can also be used to meet CAFE standards.) The different pathways to compliance make it difficult to determine whether the fuel economy standards or emissions standards have the greater effect on emissions; CBO expects that the changes in CAFE standards and emissions standards will have similar effects on CO2 emissions.\n\nThe timing of changes in emissions in relation to changes in the standards is affected by a system of emissions credits. Manufacturers can earn credits by achieving lower average annual emissions than required under the standard and accumulate them for use in future years. They can also sell those credits to other automakers that would otherwise fall short of the standard. Such trading lowers the overall costs for the industry of meeting the standards. Credits can even be applied retroactively: Firms have three years in which to bank or acquire the necessary amounts to achieve compliance. (The CAFE standards program has a similar credit system.)\n\nAfter accumulating a stockpile of credits in the early years of the program, manufacturers used an average of 0.02 BMT of credits per year from 2016 to 2020. As a result, vehicles of those model years will emit an average of 0.02 BMT of CO2 more over their lifetime than the standards would suggest. A bank of 0.10 BMT of credits is expected to carry over from 2021 to 2022.\n\nDemand for Electric Vehicles\n\nElectric vehicle sales (including sales of plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles) have grown substantially over the past few years as the cost of batteries has declined, their storage capacity has increased, and charging infrastructure has expanded. In 2021, 610,000 light-duty electric vehicles were sold, and three-quarters of them relied entirely on electricity to operate. The number of charging stations, small for many years, roughly doubled from 2019 to 2021. About 6,600 stations offered the fastest charging rates (providing roughly 300 miles of charge in one hour and 15 minutes) in 2021. (By comparison, approximately 130,000 stations sell gasoline. )\n\nElectric vehicles are expected to make up a growing share of light-duty vehicle sales in coming years. Projections of electric vehicle sales in 2030 vary widely because federal subsidies for charging stations and electric vehicles changed in 2021 and 2022. Among the changes were up to $7.5 billion in federal funding for new charging infrastructure and a revised income tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle for buyers of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles. Many states also provide financial incentives for purchasing electric vehicles. And in California, by 2035, all new cars sold are required to be free of CO2 emissions.\n\nEmissions Attributable to Electric Vehicles\n\nEven as sales of electric vehicles are expected to rise substantially, the effect of that increase on overall CO2 emissions depends on interactions with CAFE standards and greenhouse gas emissions standards. Auto manufacturers might delay the adoption of fuel-saving and emission-reducing features or lower the prices of their non-electric offerings in response to greater sales of electric vehicles and still meet stricter fuel economy and emissions standards. Those changes could offset reductions in emissions from sales of electric vehicles.\n\nWhen comparing emissions from operating different types of vehicles, the emissions from producing and distributing the power to operate the vehicles are relevant. A car getting 59.4 miles per gallon (the standard for new cars in 2026) will emit about 0.33 pounds of CO2 per mile from burning motor fuel. Producing and distributing the fuel also creates greenhouse gases. On average, those emissions add roughly 30 percent to the emissions released from the tailpipe of a light-duty vehicle.\n\nNo emissions are produced by the motor of a vehicle powered by electricity. However, generating electricity results in emissions, so the reduction in emissions represented by an electric vehicle also depends on where its battery is charged. Some regions of the country have much lower CO2 emission rates from electricity production than others. For example, in 2020, generating one megawatt-hour of electricity in the California subregion of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council resulted in an average of 514 pounds of CO2, whereas generating the same amount of electricity in the Rockies subregion yielded 1,145 pounds of CO2, on average. Such differences can lead to substantial variation in electric vehicle emissions. For instance, a popular model of all-electric sedan powered in California in 2020 was estimated to result in emissions of 0.15 pounds of CO2 per mile, but charged in Colorado, that same vehicle was estimated to result in 0.33 pounds of CO2 per mile.\n\nAs the generation of electricity becomes less carbon intensive in the future, emissions attributable to driving electric vehicles will decline accordingly. CBO projects that by 2030, CO2 emissions in the electric power sector will fall to half their 2021 level.\n\nEffects of Economic Growth and Oil Prices on Future Emissions\n\nEconomic growth and the price of motor vehicle fuels affect total vehicle miles traveled and, in turn, total CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. Growth that was faster or slower than anticipated could cause emissions to be higher or lower than projected. In 2032, if real GDP was 8 percent higher than it is in the Energy Information Agency’s baseline scenario, transportation emissions would be 6 percent higher than projected, CBO estimates. If, instead, real GDP was 6 percent lower than it is in EIA’s baseline scenario over that period, emissions from transportation would be 5 percent lower.\n\nUncertainty about oil prices is estimated to have less of an impact on transportation emissions. If higher-than-anticipated global demand for liquid fuels and lower-than-expected supply resulted in oil prices in 2032 that were roughly half what they are in EIA’s baseline scenario, transportation emissions would be 2 percent higher than projected, CBO estimates. Alternatively, if oil prices in 2032 were double the projected amounts, emissions from transportation would be 1 percent lower."
