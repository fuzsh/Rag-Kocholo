A server can use them to retrieve information from a client about devices, networks, users, and user-agent-specific preferences. Currently, â€‹Akamaiâ€‹ reports get OS and browser data through User Agents reported by the browsers. This is why you may observe inconsistency in Traffic by Browser and OS reports for users with Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers. We recognize this limitation and look forward to a solution. The change to extract the browser and OS details from the Client Hints response headers and include them in the Traffic by Browser and OS report is set to happen later in the year 2024.\n\nPage Views report\n\nðŸ“˜\n\nThe Page Views report is being discontinued\n\nThis report is deprecated and will be deactivated on January 16, 2025.\n\nThe Page Views report returns page view (text/HTML) file data over time.

You can choose to view this report by hits or bytes.\n\nKey performance indicator (KPI) results are different for URL Traffic and Traffic report. The KPIs are based on all URL data.\n\nHTTP URL data is stored only for URLs with at least 50 hits per day for either edge hits or origin hits. This means that URLs with less than 50 hits per day are excluded from single day reports and reports that span multiple days will under-report the traffic for some URLs. The 50 hit requirement is in place to prevent customers with a large number of distinct URLs with few hits from overwhelming the reporting systems. This requirement has an impact on data returned by the report. This explains why you may observe differences between URL responses and URL traffic reports.\n\nA cache-key is the only thing stored for a given object, post-request. This means that if the cache-key setting is set to origin hostname within an origin behavior for the CP code you're reporting on, the report will show the origin hostname rather than the end-user-requested hostname.\n\nFilters\n\nSelect at least one required filter in every report.

However, no responsibility for either the accuracy of the information or the precision of the methodology will be assumed, and no liability for any decisions made or actions taken in reliance on the report will be accepted.\n\nEdge emissions methodology summary\n\nâ€‹Akamaiâ€‹ has developed a methodology to attribute Greenhouse Gas Emissions (CO2e) to units of platform capacity measured against gigabytes (GB). This methodology was applied to every edge region across the â€‹Akamaiâ€‹ Global Intelligent Platform and rolled up by country to give a detailed analysis of emissions output based on actual customer utilization. This method can calculate emissions output per GB of traffic accounted for on the platform. This granularity provides our customers visibility into their total CO2e emissions impact using â€‹Akamaiâ€‹ Edge services globally. The emissions calculation is in line with the following globally accepted standards:\n\nWorld Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 2).\n\nWRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 3).\n\nCarbon emissions calculator general assumptions\n\nA 3rd party verifier has not audited data displayed in each customer's carbon calculator. Data is assumed to be accurate based on the data sources from our network, renewable energy production, and our clean data center partners. All reports are subject to change at any time.\n\nBaseline emissions factor data includes all â€‹Akamaiâ€‹ Global Intelligent Edge network operations. The factors include hardware operations and related facility power usage effectiveness (PUE) adhering to greenhouse gas protocol Scopes 2 and 3.\n\nPUE is calculated using our annual colocation survey, and results are averaged across our facilities to ensure proper emissions impact is appropriately allocated.\n\nData for our operations globally are broken down by network region and rolled up by country to create a unique emissions factor for each individual country.\n\nOur emissions reductions are translated for our customers to view the overall impact. These reductions include attributions from our renewable energy projects, data center partners, and other emissions reduction sources based on our market-based emissions for Scope 2 and extended network Scope 3 in each country.\n\nAll emissions measurements are shown in Carbon Emissions Equivalency (CO2e)\n\nâ€‹Akamaiâ€‹ platform emissions factors are calculated against the most current and validated sources, including:\n\nUS-eGRID\n\nLocation Marginal Emissions (LME) - When applicable, US Only\n\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA)\n\nAustralia Government Industry\n\nEU AIB European Residual Mix\n\nCanada ECCC National Inventory Report\n\nUK DEFRA GHG Conversion Factors\n\nâ€‹Akamaiâ€‹ yearly emissions statement follows the ISO 14064-3 Second Edition 2019-04: Greenhouse gasses -- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the verification and validation of greenhouse gas\n\nNetwork utilization totals are pulled directly from our distributed data collected (DDC) by customer to calculate Edge traffic emissions. The traffic totals are calculated by country to provide an overall emission impact by country.\n\nTraffic by Hostname report\n\nThe Traffic by Hostname report allows you to see key traffic stats, in near real-time, by dimensions that are relatable to your business and easy to use. The report offers edge metrics by end-user-requested hostname, which is the sub.domain.com section of the URL that an end-user types into their browser, and represents the value from the Host header.\n\nHostname reporting lets you:\n\nSee log-based data in near real-time (5-10 minutes).\n\nMonitor the health of your applications by hostname and status code.\n\nUnderstand traffic levels by hostnames without creating extra variables.\n\nDetermine the traffic consumed by individual hostnames (for example, brands) or groups of hostnames.\n\nEnd-user requested hostname is an additional dimension of the Traffic by Hostname report. While the CP code dimension is still required for authorization purposes, you can both filter and view data by hostnames in this report. Relative to hostnames, one CP code can contain multiple hostnames, or, one hostname can contain multiple CP codes. Therefore, hostnames make it easier to understand the scope of the data presented.\n\nðŸ“˜\n\nIf multiple CP codes are assigned to a given hostname and you are authorized for a subset of them, you will only be able to see data for that hostname belonging to the CP codes that you are authorized to see.\n\nThere are two versions of the Traffic by Hostname report:\n\nTraffic by Hostname. The older report version, which gets data from the Reporting API v1.\n\nTraffic by Hostname (new). The latest report version, which gets data from the Reporting API v2 . With this report you can:\n\nMonitor midgress, origin, and offload metrics.\n\nView max and min KPIs reflecting 5 minute peaks and lows.\n\nSee data on coherent visualizations for Hits and Bytes tabs.\n\nFilter bytes by GET/HEAD requests.\n\nSee annotations on activating and deactivating Property Manager configurations.\n\nUse the Traffic by Hostname report\n\nFrom the Reports menu, select the Traffic by Hostname report.\n\nSelect filters. Recommended filters are:\n\nDate range. Click the date picker icon to adjust the date and time.\n\nGroups and Properties. These are parent filters for both hostnames and CP codes.\n\nTop Hostnames. You can see up to 20,000 hostnames by the hits in the last ten days. The list includes only hostnames that had at least two hits per 5 minutes, over the last 10 days. The hostname list filters results starting from hostnames with the most hits. Select specific hostnames you want to see data for. Enter keywords that match your search criteria to narrow your search.\n\nCP codes (required filter). Use the CP code filter to get a part of the traffic on a given hostname. If you select hostnames first, corresponding CP codes are selected automatically. You can use a regex filter or not filter by hostnames at all, and the report will still return data as long as CP codes are selected.\n\nHostnames. You can narrow down results by using a regex filter or select a hostname that is not visible in the top 20,000 hostnames. The following match criteria apply: Contains, Starts with, Ends with, Does not contain, Does not start with, Does not end with, Match a regular expression, Does not match a regular expression, or Is an exact match).

The completeness is at least at 95% within 5-10 minutes, but is not guaranteed to reach 99%.\n\nðŸ“˜\n\nWith 95% completeness, the Traffic by Hostname report should be treated as incomplete monitoring information and should not be expected to match the Traffic report or Billing invoices. Furthermore, use of Hostname data to generate financial information should acknowledge the incomplete nature of the report.\n\nHostname hits threshold\n\nThe Hostname report and API includes hostnames with at least two hits in any 5-minute period. After 7 days, hostnames with only one hit in any 5-minute period are aggregated into the bucket \"Others\", and this will appear in the hits / bytes by hostname table.\n\nRetention\n\nThe hostname report has a retention period of 92 days, from the start of data collection.\n\nHostname filter\n\nBoth UI and API currently limit the list of hostnames in the hostname filter to 20,000 objects for the last ten days, only including hostnames with at least 2 hits.\n\nIn both the UI and the API, it is not recommended to use filters to get the majority or all of the hostname data. For example, with *.com.\n\nData by hostname\n\nIn the UI, the Edge hits/bytes by hostname tables are limited to the top 5000 hostnames (sorted in descending order by hits or bytes). This limit is 25000 hostnames for API requests. Pagination of API results is not yet available.\n\nNew hostnames and CP codes\n\nBeing able to see data for new hostnames that have been recently added to delivery configurations depends on the CP code assigned. If an existing CP code has been assigned, data should be visible in the Traffic by Hostname report within 5-10 minutes after traffic occurred. If a new CP code is assigned, it may take up to 6 hours for data to appear while the processing system picks up an updated list of CP codes.\n\nAPI rate limiting\n\nRead about the rate limiting for:\n\nThe Hostname report API (Reporting API v1)\n\nThe Hostname report (new) API (Reporting API v2)\n\nChina CDN traffic\n\nThe China CDN traffic is only visible on source CP codes. China CDN specific CP codes - CP Codes that are paired with source CP codes in the CP code configuration - will not show traffic.\n\nBest practices for retrieving hostname monitoring data\n\nRetrieve monitoring data only for the latest few time buckets.\n\nFor monitoring the health of delivery at the Edge, only data for the most recent few time buckets is sufficient. As the Traffic by Hostname data is populated in near-real time, the metrics for the older buckets are not expected to be updated. For monitoring the health of digital properties, you are encouraged to query only the last 30 minutes of data or less.\n\nAvoid repeated calls to retrieve the same reporting data.\n\nThe performance of the API or reporting system is affected by the amount of data retrieved from the data store for populating the reports. In cases where you expect to make multiple scans of the same data for analysis, we recommended that you retrieve the data once from the report API, store it in a staging database and analyze further. This approach will ensure good performance of the hostname reporting system."
