        "text": "What is the Purpose of Incident Reporting?\n\nAs part of Incident Management, the purpose of incident reporting is to record an incident, determine its possible cause, document any actions taken, and make it known to stakeholders. An incident report can be used in the investigation and analysis of an event or as safety documents that indicate potential risks and uncontrolled hazards found on the work site for future assessments (e.g., ergonomic assessments).\n\nAn incident report is utilized by:\n\nan authority to create a report of an incident;\n\na worker to report an incident he/ she has witnessed;\n\nany member of the organization to raise awareness about an incident that has occurred in the worksite.\n\nTop 3 Benefits of Incident Reporting\n\nThe management and their workers should know why incident reporting can not only improve an organization’s safety but also help the business stand out from others and, most importantly, can help create a sound and healthy working environment and culture for workers.\n\n1. Immediate Reinforcement of Actions\n\nIn the event that an incident happens at work, documenting and reporting the details to management can induce immediate and necessary measures to be taken (e.g., providing first aid). This also heightens the seriousness and gravity of any incident, reminding all workers that these events should be reported, whether big or small. Immediate action also helps leaders magnify their responsibilities in ensuring a safer place for their workers.\n\n2. Communication on Hazards and Threats\n\nCommunicating threats, risks, and hazards to all concerned and affected workers in an organization helps raise awareness of possible dangers that may arise. This could be an essential tool for industries in which tasks are associated with the highest risks, such as the construction, manufacturing, mining industries, and even offices, which are prone to accidents because of the potential hazards that can be overlooked.\n\n3. Continuous Improvement of Processes\n\nAn incident report provides a clear picture of what an organization should focus on resolving, changing, improving, or eliminating. This also helps the management implement new policies to determine the efficacy of these changes for safety and quality.\n\nWhat are the 4 Types of Incident Reports?\n\nHere are 4 types of incidents you should report:\n\nSentinel events – these are unexpected occurrences that resulted in serious physical or psychological injury or death (e.g., slips, trips and falls, natural disasters, vehicle accidents, disease outbreak, etc.).\n\nWorker injury incident\n\nEnvironmental incident\n\nProperty damage incident\n\nVehicle incident\n\nFire incident\n\nNear misses – these are situations where the people involved had no injuries but could have been potentially harmed by the risks detected.\n\nAdverse events – related to medicine, vaccines, and medical devices (in compliance with ISO 14971). These events occur when an act of commission or omission harms a patient rather than the existing disease or condition.\n\nNo harm events – these are incidents that need to be communicated across an organization to raise awareness of any harm that may happen.\n\nAdditionally, there are two major ways to create a comprehensive incident report: list type and narrative type. List-type reporting allows users to enumerate all the relevant information in a straight-to-the-point approach. Narrative reporting, meanwhile, involves documenting events in a descriptive or storytelling manner. As the keyword suggests, it narrates the whole incident from start to finish.\n\nWhat to Include in an Incident Report\n\nTo ensure an effective incident reporting, it should be accurate, factual, complete, graphic, and valid. Here’s a list of elements that would guide you during the documentation of an incident:\n\nGeneral information\n\nSetting or environment\n\nAffected people\n\nInjuries and the severity\n\nWitnesses\n\nAdministered treatment\n\nProperty and equipment damages\n\nEvents\n\nActions of people involved during the incident\n\nTake a look at some incident report examples here\n\nFormat\n\nThe layout of information in an incident report form may vary depending on a number of factors. But should generally include the following elements:\n\nIntroduction – The first part of the incident report form covers the who, what, when, and where of the incident.\n\nBody – Talk about the incident from start to finish, ensuring details are laid out in chronological order to avoid confusion.\n\nConclusion – Was the incident resolved? How? If the incident was not resolved, explain why, and provide the steps that need to be taken in order to resolve it.\n\nSign off – Include the full name and signature of the incident report writer for accountability and record-keeping.\n\nHow to Write an Incident Report: A Step-by-Step Guide (with Examples)\n\nNow that we have an idea of what information should be included in an incident report, here’s a sample walkthrough through an incident report PDF sample to give you a clearer picture of how you can create an effective incident report.\n\nStep 1: Provide Fundamental Information\n\nFollowing the outline of an incident report form, the first thing you would want to collect are fundamental information. You can do this by answering the following questions:\n\nWhat type of injury was caused, if any? Was it fatal or non-fatal?\n\nWas there any property damage?\n\nWhen and where did it take place?\n\nWhat task was being done at the time when the incident occurred?\n\nWhat was the environment like?\n\nUsing the scenario above, the first section of your report would begin to look something like this:\n\nIn our incident report example, we took advantage of adding photo evidence to better illustrate the environment where the incident took place. Notice that the photo attached had an annotation. Annotating gives the reader(s) of your report a clearer idea of what to look at.\n\nStep 2: Take Note of Any Damages and Injuries\n\nThe next thing you would want to do is determine the results of the incident. Did it cause any damage or injure anyone? If so, you should describe it in detail and, if appropriate, provide photo evidence of the damage.\n\nStep 3: Identify Affected Individual(s)\n\nProvide the names of the people involved along with their job details, such as title, shift arrangement, and other relevant information.\n\nStep 4: Identify Witnesses and Take Their Statements\n\nRecord the names of people present during the incident and gather their statements. These will be valuable in understanding the sequence of events that led to the incident and may even provide you a better insight into whether or not the behavior of the affected employees was a factor that contributed to the injury or damage. Witnesses’ statements can be noted verbatim or paraphrased. Remember to have the witnesses sign off on their statements to verify the accuracy of what has been recorded.\n\nStep 5: Take Action\n\nThis refers to the actions that should be taken after the incident. It includes corrective actions that will eliminate recurrence of the incident. The corrective actions section of your incident report can also include the actions that you need to take in order to complete the report.\n\nStep 6: Close Your Report\n\nUpon completion of the previous sections, you may collect management’s comments on the incident. For accountability measures, you, as the reporter, and someone from upper management should sign off. This will validate that the information stated in the incident report is truthful and unquestionable."
