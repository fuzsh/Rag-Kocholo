        "text": "Analytics\n\nThe Analytics page displays key sales, orders, and online store visitor data. You can use the Analytics page to determine how your store is performing across all of your sales channels, and for any date range.\n\nFor example, on the Analytics page you can do the following activities:\n\nCheck the value of your recent sales and compare them to a previous time period\n\nCompare how well your sales channels are performing\n\nTrack your average order value\n\nReview where your visitors are coming from by region or by social media source\n\nMonitor the trends over time\n\nAnalytics overview dashboard\n\nThe dashboard displays the most valuable metrics that give you insight into the performance of your store and the behavior of your customers. The metrics are displayed in numeric format and also as graphs where appropriate. For all the metrics, the percentage change from the previous date range can also be displayed.\n\nSteps:\n\nCustomizing your Analytics overview dashboard\n\nCustomizing your dashboard is only available on a desktop computer. However, changes made to your dashboard display on both desktop and mobile devices.\n\nTo edit the metrics that are displayed on your dashboard, click Customize. The metrics that are available to add to the dashboard are displayed in the Metrics library sidebar.\n\nYou can make the following customizations to the dashboard:\n\nRemove a metric from the dashboard by clicking the ⊗ next to the metric you want to remove.\n\nAdd a metric to the dashboard by doing any of the following actions:\n\nDrag and drop the metric from the sidebar into the dashboard.\n\nHover over the metric you want to add in the sidebar, and then click ⊕ Add to dashboard.\n\nRearrange a metric by clicking the ⠿ and then drag and drop the metric to your preferred location on the dashboard.\n\nUndo all layout changes and restore your metrics to the default view by clicking the Undo icon in the Metrics library sidebar.\n\nClick Save to confirm your changes.\n\nMetrics library\n\nThe Metrics library contains a list of all of the available metrics that can be included in your Analytics dashboard. The display format of the metric (for example: bar graph, line graph, list) is indicated by the icon next to each metric in the library. You can add any number of the available metrics to your dashboard, but each metric can be included only one time.\n\nAlthough nearly all of these metrics have corresponding reports you can navigate to by clicking the View report icon, there are many reports that don't have a corresponding metric to add to the dashboard. Some metrics correspond to the same report, and the difference between the metrics is based on the way the data displays on the dashboard. For example, the Top staff and Retail sales by staff at register metrics both correspond to the Retails sales by staff at register report, but the Top staff metric displays the number of orders per staff member, and the Retail sales by staff at register metric displays the total value of sales per staff member.\n\nMetrics for each of the following categories can be displayed on the Analytics dashboard:\n\nSales\n\nAcquisition\n\nOrders\n\nFinances\n\nBehavior\n\nCustomers\n\nInventory\n\nMarketing\n\nSales\n\nSales metrics give insight into your customer's orders and the value of products purchased.

This is commonly known as the conversion funnel, and it's typical to have a decrease from one step to the next:\n\nAdded to cart: Number and percentage of sessions in which shoppers added one or more items to their shopping carts.\n\nThis amount is usually smaller than the total number of shoppers because some shoppers view the products in a store without adding any items to their cart.\n\nReached checkout: Number and percentage of sessions in which shoppers added one or more items to their shopping cart, proceeded to the checkout, and performed an action (for example, a key press or mouse click).\n\nThis amount is usually smaller than the Added to cart amount because some shoppers add items to their cart but don't go to the checkout or don't submit their contact information.\n\nSessions converted: Number and percentage of sessions in which shoppers added one or more items to their shopping carts, proceeded to the checkout, and then purchased the items.\n\nThis amount might not match your order count, because shoppers can make multiple orders within a single session.\n\nThis amount is usually smaller than the Reached checkout amount because some shoppers leave the checkout without purchasing anything.

This includes marketing campaigns and activities managed through the Marketing section in your Shopify admin and external methods that use Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) parameters.\n\nData on the dashboard\n\nWhen you open the Analytics page, the data is up to date, within about 1 minute. You can reopen the dashboard or refresh the browser page to display newer data. You can also activate Auto-refresh which refreshes the dashboard every 60 seconds.\n\nThe daily data on your Analytics page might update within a 48 hour period after it's initially processed and published. For example, your Sessions over time and Online store conversion over time reports might update because your traffic data is calculated within a minute, and unwanted bot traffic can end up included in the data. Tests to determine this type of traffic are run, and can take up to 48 hours to complete. If these tests find unwanted traffic, then the unwanted data is removed from your reports.\n\nIf you don't use the Online Store channel, then the metrics related to online store sessions aren't displayed. Similarly, if you don't use the Point of Sale channel, then those metrics aren't displayed.\n\nThe data in the dashboard might vary slightly from the data gathered by analytics and reporting tools and services from other companies. For information on why the data can vary, review Report discrepancies.\n\nSessions and visitors\n\nThe number of sessions and the number of visitors are based on cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored on a shopper's device, such as a desktop or smartphone, when they visit your online store. One cookie identifies the device (the visitor). Another cookie keeps track of the length of the session.\n\nA session ends after 30 minutes of no activity, and at midnight UTC. Because the same visitor can have multiple sessions, the number of sessions is usually higher than the number of visitors.\n\nExample: A shopper views products on your store for 20 minutes, then returns to your store 2 hours later for another 10 minutes. Two sessions and one visitor are reported. If the shopper instead views your store for 5 minutes, leaves, and returns 10 minutes later, then one session and one visitor are reported.\n\nIf you want to view your online store and not have it count as a session in your acquisition reports, then on your desktop Shopify admin, click the eye icon to open your store. Any other method of viewing your online store on desktop counts as a session in your reports.\n\nIf you view your online store from the Shopify app on iPhone or Android, then it counts as a session in your acquisition reports."
