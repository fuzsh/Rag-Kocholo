        "text": "The Oregon Traffic Monitoring System (OTMS) is an online interactive tool where you can access count data. Count locations are featured on a map. You can zoom in, zoom out, and pan to an area of interest. Or if you know a Location ID already you can look it up that way using the Search box. The available data includes common annual statistics, such as Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and truck percentages. At most sites, it also allows you to access more detailed count data. The OTMS pages are optimized for use in a Chrome browser.\n\nThe public can go to Transportation Data Management System to access the public portal. This is limited to data years that have been finalized. Newer data is still subject to edits.\n\nODOT employees can go to Transportation Data Management System to access the internal portal. The first time you log in, you will have to use the blue button that says ‘Log in with ADFS’ and then enter your ODOT login data. In subsequent visits, this blue button will take you straight in to the TCDS.\n\nIn the public and internal portals, you have access to three modules. The Traffic Count Database System (TCDS) module is the main data system with our straightaway counts and includes the raw data and annual statistics. The Turning Movement Count (TMC) module holds our intersection counts. The Non-Motorized Database System (NMDS) module holds counts from permanent or short term bicycle and pedestrian counts. Below you will find documents to help with various aspects of the system. But each of the modules has a Help button at the top with access to much information. The Help button in the TCDS is context sensitive. So if you hit that when you first open the TCDS, it will give you good information on ways to search for locations and their data.\n\nQuick start guide for the TMC module\n\nQuick start guide for the NMDS module\n\nA mobile-friendly public version called Traffic Viewer is also available."
