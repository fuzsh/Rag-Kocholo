        "text": "What's on the site usage page\n\nUnique viewers\n\nShows the total number of individual visitors to the site, regardless of how often they've visited. Usage data accounts for user activity for site content such as pages, documents, and news, including 'news for email' inbox viewers. This data is presented using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nYou can review daily unique viewer trends on your site for the last 7 days, last 30 days, and last 90 days. The overall unique viewer count is available for the last 7 days and the last 30 days.\n\nIn the example below, the 7 day view for this site tells us there have been 168 unique views which is a 30% increase in traffic from last week. On the right-hand side of the graph, you'll see the lifetime unique viewers which is the total number of people who viewed content on this site since February 2018 and in this example is 3,468.\n\nSite visits\n\nShows the total number of visits to content on this site for the last 7 days, last 30 days, and last 90 days. Site content includes pages, documents, and news, including 'news for email' inbox views. This data is presented using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nThe algorithm used to calculate Site visits is designed to filter out repetitive, continual operations by the same user on the same item (page, document, or news). For example when a user repeatedly refreshes a page, document, or news post.\n\nIn the example below, the 7 day view for this site tells us there have been 567 site visits which is a 10% decrease in traffic from last week. On the right hand side of the graph, you'll see the lifetime site visits which is the total number of people who viewed content on this site since February 2018 and in this example is 125,498.\n\nAverage time spent per user\n\nShows the trend of actual time spent on modern SharePoint site pages and news posts by users. The report calculates the time when users are actually active on the page or news post, not counting the time when the page is minimized or when the user has the page open but is inactive. The average metric for 7 and 30-day period is calculated by measuring the total time spent on that page and the number of the unique visitors on that page in the given timeframe. This data is presented using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nThis report currently does not provide the average value for 90-day period and does not support lists, documents, administrative pages (such as the site usage or site permissions page), or News for Email inbox views. Usage on mobile app is currently not incorporated in calculation of this report.\n\nIn the example below, the 7 day view for this site tells us average user spends 6 minutes and 45 seconds actively engaged with your site which is a 40% decrease from last week. There is no lifetime average time spent per user metric.\n\nPopular content\n\nShows the most popular content on the site sorted by site pages, news posts, and documents. Popular content can be sorted by unique viewers, total views, or time spent for site pages and news posts. This report is available for the last 7 days.\n\nFor popular documents, sorting is available by unique viewers or total views.\n\nSite traffic\n\nShows the hourly trend of visits to the site over the last 7 days, last 30 days, and last 90 days for the viewer's local time zone. Darker shades on the chart refer to time slots when there are more views on the content in the site. Use this map to determine to best time to post news and big announcements.\n\nPopular Platforms\n\nShows the distribution of visits to the sites' content organized by the platform (desktop, mobile web, mobile app, tablet. This data is available for the last 7 days, last 30 days, and last 90 days.\n\nThis report is generated based on \"user agent\" headers which are part of the received metadata when a user visits any site content.\n\nExport site usage data in excel file\n\nSite owners can export the 90-days site usage data in an excel file by going to the download button on site usage page. Select the button to download 90-days data for unique viewers, site visits, popular platforms and site traffic. For popular content on the site (news posts, documents and pages) the report will be for last 7 days.\n\nTo export a site usage report, select the download icon near the right hand corner of the page:\n\nShared with external users\n\nList of files that you have access to that are shared with users outside your organization through a sharing link that requires them to log in before they can view the file."
