Movements are primarily long-distance, interstate and intrastate traffic.\n\nRural Interstates are multiple-lane (usually four) facilities and have full access control.\n\nThe goal is to be free of height restrictions and provide for the unrestricted movement of legal loads.\n\nRide and distress scores are generally in the good to excellent categories. High volumes of traffic, as well as a high percentage of trucks, are relatively consistent year round.\n\nTravel speeds average 65 to 75 miles per hour.\n\nRural Interstates demonstrate a high degree of safety, with crash rates below the statewide average.\n\nAccordion Section Title\n\nInterregional System\n\nMaintaining a high degree of reliability and mobility on these highways is critical, since they support and promote international, national, regional and statewide trade and economic activity. Movements on these highways are primarily long-distance, interstate and intrastate traffic.\n\nInterregional System highways are either two-lane or multiple-lane facilities.\n\nSegments or specific locations may have partially controlled access.\n\nThe goal is to be free of height restrictions, provide for the unrestricted movement of legal loads and have limited passing restrictions.\n\nAccommodating truck traffic is a priority. Ride and distress scores are generally in the good to excellent categories.\n\nModerate to high volumes of traffic, as well as a high percentage of trucks, are relatively consistent year round.\n\nDaytime travel speeds average 60 to 70 miles per hour.\n\nThe Interregional System demonstrates a high degree of safety, with crash rates below the statewide average.\n\nAccordion Section Title\n\nState Corridor\n\nMaintaining a moderately high degree of reliability and mobility on these highways is critical, since they support the movement of agricultural commodities, freight and manufactured products within the state. State Corridors provide connectivity between lower and higher level roadways.\n\nState Corridors provide connectivity between lower and higher level roadways. Movements on these highways are primarily medium-distance intrastate traffic.\n\nState Corridors are typically two-lane facilities and have segments or locations with partially controlled access.\n\nThese highways have either paved or aggregate shoulders, some segments may have limited passing zone restrictions, and load limits are restricted by legal weights.\n\nBridges and overhead structures provide for the unrestricted movement of legal loads. Ride and distress scores are generally in the good category.\n\nModerately high volumes of traffic are relatively consistent year round.\n\nDaytime travel speeds average 60 to 65 miles per hour.\n\nState Corridors demonstrate a moderately high degree of safety, with crash rates less than the statewide average.\n\nAccordion Section Title\n\nDistrict Corridor\n\nMaintaining a moderate degree of reliability and mobility on these highways is desirable.\n\nMovements on these highways are primarily short- to medium-distance intrastate traffic.\n\nDistrict Corridors are two-lane facilities.\n\nGenerally, access control is not purchased.\n\nThese highways have narrow paved or gravel shoulders and segments with restricted passing zones. They may be restricted to 8- or 7-ton seasonal load limits.\n\nBridge structures provide for the unrestricted movement of legal loads.\n\nRide and distress scores are generally in the fair and good categories.\n\nModerate volumes of traffic are relatively consistent year round.\n\nOccasional increases in seasonal traffic volumes and truck movements occur. Daytime travel speeds average 55 to 65 miles per hour.\n\nDistrict Corridors are safe highways, with crash rates at or near the statewide average."
