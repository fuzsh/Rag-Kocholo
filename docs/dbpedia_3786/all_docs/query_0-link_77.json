May be entered into evidence in any court proceeding for a violation of this section.\n\n(e) Violation and proof of violation. â\n\n(1) For a violation to occur, a motor vehicle must exceed the posted speed limit by 11 miles per hour or more in the residence district or work zone.\n\n(2) Proof of a violation of this section may be evidenced by information obtained from an electronic speed monitoring system approved under this section. A certificate, or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images produced by an electronic speed monitoring system shall constitute prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein, if the certificate, or facsimile thereof, is sworn to or affirmed by an operator or a technician employed by a state agency or entity designated by a state agency for the purpose of carrying out this subsection. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recoded images evidencing a violation shall be made available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate liability for violation of this section.\n\n(f) Notice of violation, procedure to contest violation, and orders subject to appeal. â\n\n(1) Any resident or nonresident owner or operator of any motor vehicle driven on the public streets, roads, turnpikes or highways of this State will be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts in this State for purposes of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, a summons for a violation of this section may be executed by mailing to any resident or nonresident, by first-class mail, a copy thereof to the address of the owner of the vehicle as shown in the records of the Division of Motor Vehicles of this or any other state. Collection actions, including default judgment and execution, may proceed based upon jurisdiction obtained through the mailing, by first-class mail, of a summons and subsequent court notices pursuant to this subsection. Every initial mailing shall include the following:\n\na. Name and address of the owner of the vehicle.\n\nb. Registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation.\n\nc. Violation charges.\n\nd. Location where the violation occurred.\n\ne. Date and time of the violation.\n\nf. Copies of 2 or more photographs, microphotographs, or other recoded images, taken as proof of the violation.\n\ng. Amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid.\n\nh. The length of time and location for contesting liability and notice that the failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability, in a timely manner, is an admission of liability and may result in a judgment being entered against the summonsed person and the denial of the registration or renewal of registration of any of the ownerâs vehicles.\n\ni. The ability to rebut the presumption under this section that the summonsed person was the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation and the manner of rebutting said presumption.\n\n(2) A person receiving the summons pursuant to this subsection may request a hearing to contest the violation by notifying, in writing, the entity designated on the summons within 20 days of the date of the summons. Upon receipt of a timely request for a hearing, a civil hearing shall be scheduled, and the defendant notified of the hearing date by first-class mail. A civil hearing shall be held by the Justice of the Peace Court or other court with competent jurisdiction as designated by the Department of Safety and Homeland Security or county or municipality in which the speed camera was located. There shall be no right of transfer to the Court of Common Pleas.\n\n(3) Any person found, by the court, to be responsible for a speeding violation, under this subsection, shall have a right of appeal only in those cases in which the civil penalty exceeds $100, upon giving bond with surety satisfactory to the judge before whom such person was found responsible, such appeal to be taken and bond given within 15 days from the courtâs order. Such appeal shall operate as a stay or supersedeas of all proceedings in the court below in the same manner that a certiorari from the Superior Court operates. The taking of such appeal shall constitute a waiver by the appellant of the appellantâs right to a writ of certiorari in the Superior Court.\n\n(g) Civil penalties. â\n\n(1) The owner or operator of a vehicle who has failed to comply with the posted speed limit, as evidenced by information obtained from an electronic speed monitoring system, shall be subject to a civil penalty consistent with those established under Â§ 4169(c) of this title. Assessments defined under Â§ 4105 of this title, Â§Â§ 4101 and 9016 of Title 11 and Â§ 8505 of Title 10, shall only be assessed for violations occurring in a âwork zoneâ as defined in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(2) Court costs, or similar administrative fees, not to exceed $35, may be imposed against an owner or operator of a motor vehicle who requests a hearing to contest a violation and is either found at fault or admits to fault at the hearing. No costs may be assessed against a prevailing party.\n\n(3) No additional assessments or court costs, other than those specified in this subsection, shall be assessed or collected against the owner or operator of a vehicle who has violated this section.\n\n(4) Persons electing to pay by voluntary assessment shall make payments to the entity designated on the summons for payment. Such entity may be the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, or the city or county in which the speed camera was located. Procedures for payment under this subsection shall be as provided by court rule or policy directive of the Justice of the Peace Court, or by regulation of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, or by regulation, code, or ordinance of the applicable city or county, and shall be in lieu of the procedures set forth in Â§ 709 of this title.\n\n(5) A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section is not a criminal offense and is not to be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed.\n\n(6) A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section shall not be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance.\n\n(h) Presumption of ownership. â\n\n(1) The owner of any vehicle found to be in violation of this section shall be held prima facie responsible for such violation in the same manner as under Â§ 7003 of this title unless the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, in the care, custody or control of another person. Such presumption may be rebutted if the owner:\n\na. Provides an affidavit, by regular mail, to the entity indicated on the summons that the owner was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and provides the name and address of the person or company who leased, rented, or otherwise had care, custody or control of the vehicle, or attaches a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle or license plate or plates thereof had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the alleged violation of this section; or\n\nb. Provides proof in court or to the entity handling the administrative appeal process that the owner was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and identifies the operator at the time of the violation. If the owner granted multiple persons permission to use the vehicle and is unable to identify the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the owner will remain liable for the violation.\n\n(2) A summons may be issued to any person identified by affidavit or evidence in court as the actual operator of the vehicle alleged to have violated the speed limit. There shall be a presumption that the person so identified was the operator; this presumption may be rebutted as described under this subsection.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, if the motor vehicle which is documented by the electronic speed monitoring system in violation of subsection (e) of this section is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time, and location of the violation with 2 photographs thereof. Within 10 days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide the law-enforcement agency which has issued the summons with the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time, and location of the violation and, within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with the photographs of the violation. After receipt by the law-enforcement agency which has issued the summons of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation in the same manner as provided for under Â§ 7003 of this title and shall be subject to the provisions of this section. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of this section to provide the name and address of the driver, within the prescribed time period, shall cause the owner to be held responsible as set forth in this subsection.\n\n(i) Failure to pay civil penalty. â\n\n(1) If the owner or operator identified by the owner fails to pay the civil penalty by voluntary assessment, request a hearing within the required time or submit an affidavit stating that the owner or operator identified was not the driver, the Division of Motor Vehicles shall refuse to renew the registration of the ownerâs vehicle operated at the time the summons was issued. If the owner or operator identified by the owner is found responsible at a hearing and fails to pay the fine as ordered by the court, or requests a hearing and fails to appear, the Division of Motor Vehicles shall suspend the license of the owner or operator.\n\n(2) Upon receiving a record of failure to comply, a court clerk may enter a civil traffic judgement against the owner or operator in the amount of the civil penalty, costs, and any applicable additional assessment, giving credit for any amount paid. Such judgement may, upon motion, be transferred by the court to the civil docket. Any judgement so transferred may be executed and enforced or transferred in the same manner as other judgements of the court and the Division of Public Safety, or its designee, shall have authority to seek such execution, enforcement or transfer.\n\n(j) Funding sources and use of revenue. â\n\n(1) The Department of Transportation, New Castle County, and any municipality, may contract with the approved system vendor for carrying out any tasks related to the use of an electronic speed monitoring system by using any eligible funding source.\n\n(2) Revenue generated through the use of electronic speed monitoring systems may be used to pay costs of the system vendor, staff required to implement this section, and any consultant fees for administration of the electronic speed monitoring system.\n\n(3) Any revenue collected above what is required for the operation of the electronic speed monitoring system, as set forth in this subsection, shall be managed by the Office of Highway Safety and may be used only for transportation safety purposes under any of the following categories:\n\na. Education.\n\nb. Enforcement.\n\nc. Engineering.\n\nd. Administrative expenses.\n\n(k) Annual report. â\n\n(1) The Department of Transportation shall be responsible for preparing an annual report on the electronic speed monitoring system as implemented statewide. The report shall include all of the following:\n\na. Where and when the system was used.\n\nb. Citation data.\n\nc. Crash data.\n\nd. Readily-available speed data.\n\ne. Financial data including expenditures and revenues.\n\n(2) Police agencies shall cooperate with the Department of Transportation regarding the collection of data necessary to prepare the annual report. In the event a police agency does not provide requested information, in a timely manner, to the Department of Transportation, the police agency will no longer be eligible for use of the electronic speed monitoring system.\n\n84 Del. Laws, c. 74, Â§ 1;Â\n\nÂ§ 4172. Speed exhibitions; drag races and other speed contests.\n\n(a) No person shall drive any vehicle in any race, speed competition or contest, drag race or acceleration contest, test of physical endurance, exhibition of speed or acceleration and no person shall aid, abet, promote, assist or in any manner participate in any such race, competition, contest, test or exhibition.\n\n(b) No person shall accelerate or try to accelerate a vehicle, or any of its tires, regardless of whether the vehicle is stationary or in motion, at a rate which causes the drive wheels to spin or slip on the road surface, to produce smoke from tire slippage, or to leave visible tire acceleration marks on a highway, ground, or other surface. This subsection shall not apply during periods of inclement weather, unless such conduct is done in wilful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\n\n(c) No owner or person in charge of a vehicle shall permit that vehicle or any vehicle under the personâs control to be used by another person for any of the purposes listed in subsection (a) or (b) of this section. If any vehicle is used in violation of this section and the identity of the operator is not otherwise apparent, the person in whose name such vehicle is registered as the owner shall be held prima facie responsible for such violation.\n\n(d) (1) A violation of this section is an unclassified misdemeanor for the first offense. For a first offense, any sentence shall also include 16 hours of community service either as a condition of probation or pursuant to Â§ 4204(m) of Title 11. A subsequent like offense is a class A misdemeanor. For a subsequent offense, any sentence shall also include 40 hours of community service either as a condition of probation or pursuant to Â§ 4204(m) of Title 11. Any fine imposed may not be suspended. Upon receiving notice of a conviction for a first offense, the Secretary shall forthwith suspend the driverâs license of the person convicted, for a period of 6 months. Upon receiving notice of a conviction of a subsequent like offense, the Secretary shall suspend the driverâs license for a 1-year period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall not be a suspension of driverâs license upon conviction for a first offense under subsection (b) of this section.\n\n(2) a. Whenever a person is arrested or issued a citation for a violation of this section, the issuing or arresting law-enforcement agency shall impound the vehicle used in the offense. A law-enforcement officer may elect not to impound the vehicle, if there is an emergency or medical necessity jeopardizing life or limb, or if the law-enforcement officer is presented with exigent circumstances, including resource constraints.\n\nb. A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall be impounded for a period of 72 hours after the time of arrest or citation, or until such later time as the person claiming the vehicle meets the conditions for release listed in paragraph (d)(2)d. of this section. This section does not otherwise limit any other provisions of the Code that govern the lawful seizure of vehicles or evidence.\n\nc. A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section may be released to a person other than the arrestee prior to the end of the impoundment period only under 1 of the following conditions:\n\n1. The arrestee does not own and has not leased the vehicle, and the person who owns or leases the vehicle claims the vehicle and meets the conditions of release set forth in paragraph (d)(2)d. of this section.\n\n2. The vehicle is owned or leased by the arrestee and the arrestee gives permission to another person, who has provided written acknowledgment that he/she is responsible for not allowing the arrestee to drive the motor vehicle during the balance of the impoundment period, and the conditions for release in paragraph (d)(2)d. of this section are met. Should another person obtain the early release of an impounded vehicle under this paragraph and the arrestee thereafter drives, operates, or is in actual physical control of the vehicle during the balance of the 72-hour period of impoundment, the person that obtained the early release of the vehicle shall be guilty of a violation and subject to a $200 fine, which shall not be suspended. In any such prosecution under this paragraph, the State does not need to present a copy of the written acknowledgement.\n\nd. A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall not be released unless all of the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The claimant presents a valid driverâs license or other photo identification, proof of ownership or lawful authority to operate the motor vehicle, and proof of valid motor vehicle insurance for that vehicle. If the vehicle will be driven out of impoundment, the claimant must have a valid driverâs license or be accompanied by a person with a valid driverâs license. If the vehicle is an ATV or OHV, proof of insurance is not necessary.\n\n2. The claimant is able to operate the vehicle in a safe manner and would not be in violation of Â§â4177(a) of this title.\n\n3. Any other conditions for release established by the law-enforcement agency have been met.\n\n4. All reasonable towing and storage fees connected to the vehicle have been paid. The State and the arresting law-enforcement agency shall not be liable for any expenses incurred in connection with the towing and storage of said vehicle.\n\n(e) (1) This section applies on highways and elsewhere throughout the State including all of the following:\n\na. On any driveway or premises of a church, school, recreational facility, or business or governmental property open to the public.\n\nb. On the premises of any industrial establishment providing parking space for customers, patrons, or employees.\n\nc. On any highway under construction or not yet open to the public.\n\n(2) This section does not apply on any raceway, drag strip, or other place customarily and lawfully used for speed exhibitions or contests, or any nonresidential commercial, industrial, or other property where the participants have received express permission from the owner or the ownerâs agent.\n\n(3) For the purpose of this section, the term âvehicleâ includes âall terrain vehicle,â âATV,â âOff-highway vehicle,â and âOHVâ as those terms are defined in Â§ 101 of this title.\n\n(4) For purposes of this section, a âsubsequent offenseâ means a new violation of either subsection (a) or (b) of this section occurring within 5 years of the date of any former offense under this section.\n\n(f) (1) If a person is found in violation of this section and the vehicle used in the violation is registered to that person or where the registrant permits the use of the vehicle, the court, at the time of sentencing the operator for violating this section, may, upon motion by the State, order said vehicle be impounded for up to 90 days for the first violation of this section, and for up to 1 year for a subsequent violation, provided that a public or private secure storage area may be obtained by the arresting law-enforcement agency for said vehicle. The court shall permit any party with a legal or equitable interest in the vehicle an opportunity to show cause why the impoundment of such vehicle should cease. Prior to releasing said vehicle, the person to whom the vehicle is released shall pay all reasonable towing and storage fees connected therewith. The State and the arresting law-enforcement agency shall not be liable for any expenses incurred in connection with the towing and storage of said vehicle.\n\n(2) In lieu of impoundment under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the court may order that the number plate or registration plate of any Delaware-registered vehicle used in connection with a violation of subsection (a) of this section be surrendered to the Department within 72 hours of the issuance of the order, or in accordance with the Departmentâs procedures, for up to 90 days for the first violation of this section, and for up to 1 year for a subsequent violation. The court shall permit any party with a legal or equitable interest in the vehicle an opportunity to show cause why the surrender of said plate should cease. After a person is convicted for a violation of this section, no person shall sell, transfer, or encumber the title to a Delaware-registered vehicle that the person knows is subject to a court order, except in the case of salvage, repossession, or unless first approved by the court that issued the order. The Department may not issue any alternate number plate or registration plate to that vehicle during the period of surrender, unless approved by the court that entered the order or upon presentment of proof of salvage or repossession. Anyone convicted of a violation of this section is prohibited from driving, operating, or being in physical control of the vehicle during the period of surrender absent specific court approval, regardless of any legal or equitable interest they might have in the vehicle.\n\n(g) Whenever any vehicle has been used in, or in connection with, the commission of a violation of this section, or in connection with the flight or escape of any person convicted of a violation of this section, and any vehicle involved causes serious physical injury or death to another person during the course of the violation, or its operator is in violation of Â§ 4177(a) of this title as a second offense or higher, the State, pursuant to the procedure governing set forth in Chapter 23 of Title 11 may seek to have forfeited any vehicle involved, whether it be the vehicle or an accomplice vehicle.\n\n(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude or otherwise limit prosecution of or conviction for a violation of this chapter or any other provision of law. A person may be prosecuted and convicted of both the offenses of speed exhibitions, drag races and other speed contests and any other offenses as defined elsewhere by the laws of the State.\n\n21 Del.
