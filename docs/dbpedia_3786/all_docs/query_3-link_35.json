        "text": "Road & Entrance Status\n\nFor up-to-date information, check out the live road status map (above), call (307) 344-2117 for recorded information, or sign up to receive Yellowstone road alerts on your mobile phone by texting 82190 to 888-777 (an automatic text reply will confirm receipt and provide instructions). Before traveling, it's also a good idea to:\n\nCheck road conditions outside of Yellowstone in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Grand Teton National Park.\n\nView the park webcams to see current traffic conditions at the North and West entrances to Yellowstone.\n\n2024 Road Opening & Closing Dates (Projected)\n\nClick on the arrows below to expand the selection and find out projected road dates. All dates are subject to change depending on weather conditions.\n\nOpen year-round: North Entrance to Northeast Entrance\n\nOpen April 19 - October 31, 2024: West Entrance to Madison, Madison to Old Faithful, Madison to Norris, Mammoth Hot Springs to Norris, Norris to Canyon Village\n\nOpen May 3 - October 31, 2024: East Entrance to Lake Village (Sylvan Pass), Canyon Village to Lake Village\n\nOpen May 10 - October 31, 2024: South Entrance to West Thumb, West Thumb to Old Faithful (Craig Pass), West Thumb to Lake Village, Tower-Roosevelt to Tower Fall\n\nOpen May 24 - October 31, 2024: Canyon Village to Tower Fall (Dunraven Pass). This is a high elevation pass that generally experiences winter weather earlier than other roads in the park â€” as with all other roads, the closing date is subject to change.\n\nTBD: Beartooth Highway (US-212), Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (WY-296)**\n\n**See below for more information on these roads outside of the park's Northeast Entrance.\n\nOpen year-round: North Entrance to Northeast Entrance\n\nOpen December 15, 2023 - March 3, 2024: Mammoth Hot Springs to Norris\n\nOpen December 15, 2023 - March 5, 2024: Norris to Madison, Norris to Canyon Village, Canyon Village to Washburn Hot Springs Overlook\n\nOpen December 15, 2023 - March 10, 2024: Canyon Village to Fishing Bridge\n\nOpen December 15, 2023 - March 15, 2024: West, South, and East entrances, and all remaining groomed roads\n\nCurrent Traffic Delays\n\nIt's important to be aware of all planned road improvement projects, as they can cause major traffic delays throughout the park. Drive slowly through construction zones and be alert to workers, heavy equipment, wildlife, and other hazards. The following road improvement projects in Yellowstone will cause traffic delays:\n\nLocation: Nearly 10 miles north of the South Entrance on the South Entrance Road\n\nAccess: Expect up to 20-minute delays while South Entrance Road is open to wheeled vehicles in 2024. Nearby pullouts and the trail to Lewis River Falls will be closed during construction.\n\nImprovements: This project began in 2022 and will conclude in fall 2024. The existing Lewis River Bridge will be removed, and a new bridge will be constructed immediately downstream. The project will also include additional parking and viewing opportunities.\n\nLocation: Near Tower Junction along the Northeast Entrance Road\n\nAccess: Expect up to 30-minute delays during 2024. Hiking trails in the area may close temporarily during the duration of the project (visit the Backcountry Situation Report for more details).\n\nImprovements: This project began in 2023 and will conclude in fall 2026. It includes the replacement of the structurally deficient Yellowstone River Bridge originally built in 1961. A new 1,285-foot-long, 175-foot-high steel girder bridge upstream will replace the existing 604-foot-long bridge to preserve year-round access to/from the Northeast Entrance and communities of Silver Gate and Cooke City, Montana. New pullouts, paved parking areas, and dedicated route across the new bridge will increase access to trails, fishing, and viewpoints. Additionally, the Yellowstone River Picnic Area will be enlarged to accommodate increase visitor use.\n\nAdditionally, chip sealing occurs every summer and preserves Yellowstone's roads. Plan for delays of up to 30 minutes. Drive slowly and maintain the recommended speed limit on chip seal pavement to reduce the risk of loose gravel damaging cars or windshields.\n\nFind out more about road and infrastructure improvement projects and the park's plan to address the deferred maintenance backlog.\n\nRoads Outside the Northeast Entrance\n\nAfter initial opening, weather causes occasional closures. Please check locally or at WY DOT and MT DOT before traveling.\n\nBeartooth Highway\n\nUS-212, Cooke City to Red Lodge, Montana\n\nOpen the Friday of Memorial Day weekend to mid-October.\n\nChief Joseph Scenic Byway\n\nWY-296, Cooke City, Montana, to Cody, Wyoming, or Laurel, Montana\n\nOpen year-round from WY-120 to Pilot Creek Parking Lot (4 miles toward Cooke City from the junction of WY-296/US-212). In winter, 9 miles of road are closed to wheeled vehicles (oversnow travel only) from Cooke City to Pilot Creek. This segment of road is open to wheeled vehicles mid-May through early November. Please check locally or at WY DOT.\n\nDirections & Transportation\n\nLearn how to get here, check the status of roads, and view park maps.\n\nGrand Teton Road Information\n\nCheck road conditions and construction updates around Grand Teton National Park.\n\nMaps\n\nFind your way with an official park map.\n\nGPS Coordinates\n\nMake sure your navigation system is sending you to the correct location."
