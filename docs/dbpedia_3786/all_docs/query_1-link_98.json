The relationship between on-road transportation and PM2.5 concentration varies temporally and spatially, and the estimation for this variation is important for policymaking. Here, we reveal the quantitative association of PM2.5 concentration with on-road transportation by the spatial panel Durbin model and the geographical and temporal weighted regression. We find that 6.17 billion kilometres (km) per km2 on-road transportation increase is associated with a 1-μg/m3 county-level PM2.5 concentration increase in the contiguous United States. On-road transportation marginally contributes to PM2.5, only 1.09% on average. Approximately 3605 premature deaths are attributed to PM2.5 from on-road transportation in 2010, and about a total of 50,223 premature deaths ascribe to PM2.5 taking 6.49% from 2003 to 2016. Our findings shed light on the necessity of the county-level policies considering the temporal and spatial variability of the relationship to further mitigate PM2.5 from on-road transportation.",

        "text": "Air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), is a severe issue globally that adversely affects human mortality1,2,3,4, well-being5,6, physical health7,8, mental health9, among others. Several diseases of pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, and neurological systems, including acute lower respiratory illness, cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer, are related to PM2.510. About 3.3 million premature deaths per year worldwide are attributable to outdoor air pollution, mostly PM2.5, and 54,730 of them in the contiguous United States (CONUS, 54,905 in the whole U.S.)2. Additionally, other studies demonstrate a more negative situation that roughly 200,000 premature deaths per year are estimated to be caused by PM2.5 from combustion emission, and approximately 53,000 deaths are associated with PM2.5 from road transportation11. Moreover, another report indicates that PM2.5 is responsible for 107,000 premature deaths in 2010 in the U.S., and 28% is attributed to transportation12. Therefore, PM2.5 negatively impacts human health, and road transportation is one of the main reasons for air pollution11,12.\n\nOn-road transportation is considered one of the primary sources of toxic air pollutants, especially PM2.513,14. However, the quantitative association of on-road transportation with measured county-level PM2.5 concentration in the CONUS varies temporally and spatially, and the estimation for this variation is important for policymaking. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims that transportation is responsible for less than 10% of PM2.5 emissions15. According to the EPA, the emission sectors of hazardous air pollutants are classified into four types: biogenics, fires, mobile, and stationary16. Mobile type of the air pollution emission sectors is generally deemed transportation, which includes aircraft, commercial marine vessels, locomotives, non-road equipment, and on-road vehicles. Previous studies point out that roughly a quarter of PM2.5-related mortalities is linked to road transportation in the U.S.11,12. Nevertheless, the number of researches on the contribution of the emission sector, on-road vehicles, to PM2.5 regarding the U.S. is still limited.\n\nTo abate the public health burden, controlling and reducing air pollution emissions from fossil-fuel traffic are practical and beneficial ways17,18. The widely implemented strategies include air pollution removal and source control measures. Natural areas, such as forestlands and shrublands, are deemed effective in removing air pollution19,20. For instance, 17.4 million tons of air pollution are removed by the trees and forests in the U.S. in 201020. Moreover, the emission source control measures, such as the end-of-pipe control policies and the energy-climate policies, are successful approaches to improve air quality21,22. In fact, the average county-level PM2.5 concentration in the CONUS continues to decrease obviously from 2001 to 2016, even though counties’ average on-road carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions remain relatively stable during this period (as shown in Fig. 1). By the beneficial air pollution control policies, air pollution declined dramatically in the U.S. over the past twenty years, without strongly adversely affecting human daily life23. To further mitigate air pollution in future, more detailed information regarding specific emission sectors, e.g., on-road transportation, is desired12. Determinations of the primary air pollution sources and estimations of the effectiveness of reduction methods enable policy-makers to formulate reasonable environmental policies without strongly influencing daily human life.\n\nThe contribution of transportation to PM2.5 concentration varies spatially12. Previous studies intensively understand the association of transportation with air pollution in the atmosphere. For example, in Guangdong Province, China, mobile type takes 19.3% responsibility of ambient PM2.524; in four main cities in China, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xi’an, on average 7% PM2.5 comes from traffic in January 201325; in a Central European city, Warsaw, Poland, traffic emits about 21% PM2.526; and in Hamburg urban area, Germany, traffic contributes with 18% to PM2.5 exposure27. Furthermore, during different periods, the contributions of on-road transportation to PM2.5 concentrations are dissimilar, i.e., the relationship between on-road transportation and PM2.5 concentration temporally varies. For instance, because of the advanced end-of-pipe control technologies, air pollution declines in the past 50 years in the U.S., even though the vehicles miles travelled increase23. Therefore, both spatial and temporal variation of the relationship between on-road transportation and PM2.5 should be considered in the analysis.\n\nThe relationship between annually county-level PM2.5 concentration and on-road CO2 emissions per square kilometre (km2) in 3017 counties of the CONUS is investigated based on the panel data from 2001 to 2016. The counties’ geographically average on-road CO2 emission each year is employed as the indicator of on-road transportation. As the areas of the counties are noticeably different, the on-road CO2 emission per km2 is more reasonable than the total value. Because forests and other natural lands reduce air pollution20, the land cover data are also controlled. Additionally, the county-level population density, average temperature and relative humidity are taken into account. In the statistical analyses, the fixed effects model (FEM) is performed at first. However, according to previous studies, air pollution significantly impacts distant places rather than only within a region28. Spatial dependence tests are applied to the FEM, and the test results show that significantly spatial lag and error correlations exist. The spatial panel Durbin model (SPDM) based on FEM is utilised to estimate the association of air pollution with on-road transportation (detailed reasons for using SPDM in the “Methods” section). Because the SPDM is a typically global model, the estimated parameters are spatially and temporally stationary. The spatial and temporal variability of the relationship between on-road transportation and PM2.5 concentration is detected by the geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR), based on the spatio-temporally weighted matrix. The results of the GTWR model illustrate that the relationship does vary spatially and temporally. Accordingly, the air pollution mitigation and reduction policies should be adapted to the local situations.\n\nMaterials\n\nCounty-level PM2.5 concentrations\n\nThe county-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration in the contiguous United States (CONUS) is applied as the dependent variable in all regression models. The data are obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as estimated with the downscaler model by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (more details about this dataset: https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/tracking/topics/AirQuality.htm). The data include the estimated daily PM2.5 concentration in each county from 2001 to 2016. We calculate the mean annual PM2.5 concentration in each county, and the unit is microgram per cubic metre (μg/m3). Because the on-road carbon dioxide (CO2) emission data, land cover data, and population density data are annual, lacking daily variation, the PM2.5 concentration is converted into an annual average value.\n\nOn-road county-level CO2 emissions\n\nThe average annual CO2 emissions per square kilometre (km2) in each county are adopted as the critical independent variable. First, we obtain the annual on-road CO2 emissions at a 1-km resolution from 2001 to 2016 from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (more details about this dataset: https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1735)32. The county boundaries in the CONUS are acquired from the U.S. Census Bureau, created in 2016. The on-road county-level CO2 emissions are expressed in units of million tons per km2. Because the areas of the different counties vary dramatically, the total CO2 emissions in each county cannot be compared. In this case, the total CO2 emissions in each county are not strongly associated with the air pollution concentration, but the CO2 emissions per km2 in each county are. Additionally, CO2 emissions are predicted based on data retrieved from the Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Performance Monitoring System expressed in roadway-level vehicle miles33,34. In other words, the CO2 emissions in the counties indicate vehicle usage35.\n\nLand cover data\n\nWe exploit in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2016 land cover datasets36,37 with a 30-m resolution in the CONUS acquired from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD: https://www.mrlc.gov/data/nlcd-land-cover-conus-all-years). The NLCD includes 16 land types: open water, perennial ice, developed open spaces, low-intensity developed areas, medium-intensity developed areas, high-intensity developed areas, barren areas, deciduous forestlands, evergreen forestlands, mixed forestlands, shrublands, grasslands, pastures, cultivated croplands, woody wetlands, and emergent herbaceous wetlands. The land cover variables are the percentages of each land type in every county. We linearly interpolate the data in missing years.\n\nOther control variables\n\nThe population density, mean daily summer and winter temperatures, and means of relative humidity in summer and winter in every county are also controlled. The population density data are the raster data provided by the University of Southampton from 2001 to 2016 with a 100-m resolution and estimated via unconstrained top-down methods (details about WorldPop: https://www.worldpop.org/project/categories?id=18). The unit of the population density is thousand people per km238. Meteorological variables are also the grid data, such as the temperature and relative humidity in winter and summer, from 2001 to 2016 with a 4-km grid size in each county (more details about meteorological variables: http://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html, a statistical data summary is provided in Table S1, and the data sources are listed in the Table S2).\n\nMethods\n\nTo explore the role of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between vehicle usage and county-level PM2.5 concentration, five regression models are employed in our research, including the fixed effects model (FEM), spatial panel autoregressive model (SPAM), spatial panel error model (SPEM), spatial panel Durbin model (SPDM)39, and geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR)40.\n\nFEM\n\nThe FEM is the basic regression model among all five models. The FEM is preferred in this research, according to a series of statistical tests. Based on the F test for individual effects, the results are significant, adopting PM2.5 concentration as the dependent variable, which indicates that the FEM is better than the ordinary least square (OLS) method. According to the Breusch–Pagan Lagrange Multiplier Test for balanced panel data, the significant results indicate that the random effects model (REM) is also better than the OLS method. Finally, in the view of the Hausman test, the significant results demonstrate that the FEM performs better than the REM. The FEM can be expressed as:\n\n$$AP_{it} = {\\varvec{\\beta}}_{1} {\\varvec{X}}_{it}^{\\prime } + \\alpha_{i} + { }\\mu_{it}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\(AP_{it}\\) denotes the mean PM2.5 concentration (μg/m3) in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), \\({\\varvec{X}}_{it}\\) denotes a vector of the independent variables in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) denotes the unobserved time-invariant individual effect, \\(\\mu_{it}\\) denotes the idiosyncratic error, and \\({\\varvec{\\beta}}_{1}\\) is a vector of the parameters to be estimated. The vector, X, of independent variables includes on-road CO2 emission (million tons/km2), open space developed area (%), low intensity developed areas (%), medium intensity developed areas (%), high intensity developed areas (%), open water (%), woody wetlands (%), emergent herbaceous wetlands (%), deciduous forest (%), evergreen forest (%), mixed forest (%), shrub (%), grassland (%), pasture (%), cultivated crops (%), population density (thousand capita/km2), mean of daily temperature in summer (K°), mean of daily temperature in winter (K°), mean of relative humidity in summer (%), and mean of relative humidity in winter (%) (the data statistic summary is shown in Table S1).\n\nThe FEM assumes that the observations and error terms are independent, similar to the OLS method. However, air pollutants can diffuse in air, resulting in cross-county and even cross-state impacts28. In other words, the observations exhibit spatial correlations, which the FEM ignores. Therefore, we also apply four other models, including the SPAM, SPEM, SPDM, and GTWR, to investigate the spatial relationships among the variables.\n\nSPAM\n\nThe SPAM assumes that a spatial correlation exists between the dependent variable of a given observation and its neighbours39. In our research, the average PM2.5 concentration in a county is related to the county-level air pollutant concentration in its surrounding counties. As an improvement of the FEM, a spatial autoregressive part is added to the SPAM. According to the locally robust Lagrange Multiplier test to determine spatial lag correlations, the result is significant, adopting PM2.5 concentration as the dependent variable. Therefore, the SPAM for analysing our dataset to detect the relationship between on-road transportation and the PM2.5 concentration in the counties is reasonable. The SPAM is expressed as follows:\n\n$$AP_{it} = \\lambda {\\varvec{W}}_{i} {\\varvec{NEAP}}_{it}^{\\prime } + {\\varvec{\\beta}}_{1} {\\varvec{X}}_{it}^{\\prime } + \\alpha_{i} + \\mu_{it}$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\({\\varvec{W}}_{i}\\) is a vector of the spatial weights of the neighbours of county \\(i\\), \\({\\varvec{NEAP}}_{it}\\) is a vector of the county-level PM2.5 concentrations (μg/m3) in the neighbouring counties of county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the spatial lag parameter to be estimated. The Queen method is employed to calculate the spatial weight vectors of each county. If two counties share only one point, they are deemed contiguous in the Queen method41. The spatial weights in vector \\({\\varvec{W}}_{i}\\) is the quotient of 1 and the count of the elements in vector \\({\\varvec{NEAP}}_{it}\\). In the SPAM, the neighbouring counties affect county \\(i\\), but the county \\(i\\) also reversely influences these neighbouring counties. Therefore, the SPAM involves an iterative calculation process to figure out the spatial spillover function42. According to the recommendation of the package maker, the number of iterations is generally set to 500 to estimate the regression coefficients correctly39.\n\nSPEM\n\nThe SPEM supposes that there is a spatial dependence in the error term of the FEM39. Thus, the error term of the FEM is divided into a spatially related part and a spatially unrelated part. According to the locally robust Lagrange Multiplier test to determine spatial error correlations, the result is significant, adopting PM2.5 as the dependent variable. The SPEM is, thus, reasonable for the analysis. The SPEM is expressed as follows:\n\n$$AP_{it} = {\\varvec{\\beta}}_{1} {\\varvec{X}}_{it}^{\\prime } + a_{i} + \\rho {\\varvec{W}}_{i} {\\varvec{\\varepsilon}}_{it}^{\\prime } + \\nu_{it}$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \\({\\varvec{\\varepsilon}}_{it}\\) denotes the spatially related error term of county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), \\(\\upsilon_{it}\\) denotes the spatially unrelated error term of county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), and \\(\\rho\\) is the spatial correlation parameter to be estimated.\n\nSPDM\n\nThe SPDM accepts the assumptions of both the SPAM and SPEM. The SPDM is expressed as:\n\n$$AP_{it} = \\lambda {\\varvec{W}}_{i} {\\varvec{NEAP}}_{it}^{\\prime } + { }{\\varvec{\\beta}}_{1} {\\varvec{X}}_{it}^{\\prime } + \\alpha_{i} + \\rho {\\varvec{W}}_{i} {\\varvec{\\varepsilon}}_{it}^{\\prime } + \\nu_{it}$$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\rho\\) are the spatial correlation parameters to be estimated. Additionally, because of the spatial spillover effect, the number of iterations is set to 500. When the results of the locally robust Lagrange Multiplier tests to determine spatial lag and spatial error correlations are significant, the SPDM is considered the best global model.\n\nGTWR model\n\nTo account for the local effects of the independent variables in our research, the GTWR model is also exploited. The GTWR model is extended from the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model based on spatial panel data. The current GWR model generally employs the OLS method as the basic algorithm to estimate local coefficients. However, our dataset contains balanced panel data, so any local effects in time should also be considered. In contrast to the GWR model, the GTWR model assumes that the relationships between the dependent and independent variables are spatially and temporally non-stationary40,43. The GTWR model divides the total sample into numerous subsamples according to the spatial context and temporal extent. The critical issue of this division is to decide the subsample size, namely, the bandwidth40. In this study, the cross-validation method is applied to minimise the sum of the squared error44. In addition, the bandwidth is an adaptive spatio-temporal distance, rather than a fixed spatio-temporal distance, to guarantee that each subsample exhibits the same size. The GTWR model is expressed by:\n\n$$AP_{itk} = \\beta_{0itk} { } + { }\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{k} {\\varvec{\\beta}}_{itk} {\\varvec{X}}_{itk}^{\\prime } + \\varepsilon_{i} ,\\;i = 1, \\ldots ,n$$\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \\(AP_{itk}\\) denotes the annually average PM2.5 concentration (μg/m3) in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\) in the \\(k\\) th subsample, \\({\\varvec{X}}_{itk}\\) denotes a vector of the independent variables in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\) in the \\(k\\) th subsample, \\(\\beta_{0itk}\\) is the intercept in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\) of the \\(k\\) th regression, \\({\\varvec{\\beta}}_{itk}\\) denotes a vector of the parameters in \\(k\\) th regression in the county \\(i\\), \\(n\\) denotes the number of observations in the \\(k\\) th regression, and \\(\\varepsilon_{i}\\) is the error term.\n\nThe coefficients of the GTWR are estimated as follows:\n\n$${\\varvec{\\beta}}_{itk} = \\left[ {{\\varvec{X}}^{T} {\\varvec{W}}_{itk} {\\varvec{X}}} \\right]^{ - 1} {\\varvec{X}}^{T} {\\varvec{W}}_{itk} {\\varvec{Y}}$$\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \\({\\varvec{W}}_{itk}\\) is the spatio-temporally weighted matrix of county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\) in the \\(k\\) th regression to estimate the coefficients. \\({\\varvec{W}}_{itk}\\) is based on the spatio-temporal distance among the records40. There are 49,712 records in the dataset pertaining to 3,107 counties, from 2001 to 2016, so the size of \\({\\varvec{W}}_{itk}\\) is roughly \\(2.47{ } \\times { }10^{9}\\), which unfortunately exceeds the limitation of R. Thus, we have to eliminate the data of two years, namely, 2001 and 2002. The spatio-temporally weighted matrix is calculated as follows:\n\n$${\\varvec{W}}_{itk} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {exp\\left( { - \\frac{{{\\varvec{d}}_{it}^{2} }}{{b_{it}^{2} }}} \\right),} \\hfill & {if\\;element\\left( {it} \\right) \\in subsample\\;k} \\hfill \\\\ {0,} \\hfill & {if\\;element\\left( {it} \\right) \\notin subsample\\;k} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \\({\\varvec{d}}_{it}\\) is a vector of the combination of the geographical and temporal distances between county \\(i\\) and its neighbouring counties in the \\(j\\) th subsample, and \\(b_{it}\\) is the largest distance in the vector \\({\\varvec{d}}_{it}\\). \\(b_{it}\\) is determined based on the optimal bandwidth because we use the adaptive bandwidth. The Euclidean distance is determined to obtain the spatio-temporal distance, and the spatio-temporal distance is calculated as follows:\n\n$${\\varvec{d}}_{it}^{2} = \\user2{ }\\varphi_{S} {\\varvec{dS}}_{it}^{2} + \\varphi_{T} {\\varvec{dT}}_{it}^{2}$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \\(\\varphi_{S}\\) is the scale factor of the spatial distance, \\(\\varphi_{S}\\) is the scale factor of temporal distance, \\({\\varvec{dS}}_{it}\\) is a vector of the spatial distance between county \\(i\\) and its neighbouring counties in the \\(j\\) th subsample, and \\({\\varvec{dT}}_{it}\\) is a vector of the temporal distance. Moreover, \\(\\varphi_{S}\\) and \\(\\varphi_{T}\\) can be determined once the bandwidth is selected.\n\nModels selection\n\nThe FEM and SPEM results are summarised in Table S3, and the R2 values of the FEM and SPEM are 0.366 and 0.491, respectively. The direct, indirect, and total impacts on the county-level PM2.5 concentration are estimated by the SPAM and SPDM, respectively (listed in Tables S4 and S5). The so-called impact here is a term obtained from R package “spdep”42, but its real meaning is the coefficient. The direct impacts indicate the direct relationships between the independent and dependent variables of a given county. In other words, direct impacts are the coefficients estimated by Eqs. (2) or (4) without any iteration. The indirect impacts arise from the changes in the \\({\\varvec{NEAP}}_{it}\\), which is the dependent variable of a specific county’s neighbourhoods. For example, New York county’s PM2.5 concentration affects Kings county’s, but Kings county’s also influences New York county’s. In mathematics, this spillover would be endless. However, the spatial spillover function is monotonically increasing concave function and converges towards a certain value. The coefficients estimated according to spatial spillover function are called indirect impacts42. Simply speaking, the indirect impacts can be deemed that New York county’s on-road transportation causes PM2.5, which partially diffuses to Kings county and then come back again. The coefficient of the on-road transportation on the PM2.5 spread back is its indirect impact. The total impact is the accumulative value of the direct and indirect impacts. According to the locally robust panel Lagrange Multiplier tests, the spatial correlations of both dependent variable and error term are significant at 0.1% level when adopting the PM2.5 concentration as the dependent variable. In this case, the SPDM is the most reasonable global model. In light of the abovementioned statistical tests and findings, the SPDM is deemed the best global model to analyse the relationship between the county-level PM2.5 concentration and on-road transportation CO2 emissions (R2 of each model and statistical tests for models selection are recorded in Tables S6 and S7, respectively). Additionally, to detect the spatial and temporal variability, the GTWR model is also considered. Among all five models, the interpretation of the GTWR is the highest (R2 = 0.808, listed in Table S6).\n\nContribution of on-road transportation to PM2.5\n\nThe coefficient of on-road CO2 emission is 0.646 (0.593–0.699) based on the SPDM (see Table S5). This coefficient is the total impact, the sum of the direct and indirect impacts. The coefficient means a 1 million tons on-road CO2 emission increase per km2 in a specific county is related to a 0.646 μg/m3 increase in the county’s PM2.5 concentration. In other words, 1 μg/m3 PM2.5 from on-road transportation in a certain county is associated with about 1.55 million tons on-road CO2 emission per km2. According to the EPA (https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle), the average passenger vehicle emits approximately 404 g of CO2 per mile (1 mile = 1.61 km). It must be noted that here the conversion factor is on the basis of the passenger vehicle. Thus, 1 million tons on-road CO2 emission is equivalent to 3.99-billion-km mileage of the average passenger vehicle. Finally, according to the all numbers listed above, a 6.17 (5.70–6.71) billion km per km2 increase in total mileage in a specific county is associated with a 1-μg/m3 increase in the county’s annually average PM2.5 concentration.\n\nThe contribution of on-road transportation to air pollution based on the GTWR model is estimated as follows:\n\n$$Con_{it} = \\frac{{\\beta_{it} \\times {\\text{CO}}_{2it} }}{{Concentration_{it} }}{ } \\times 100{\\text{\\% }}$$\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \\(Con_{it}\\) denotes the contribution (as a percentage) of on-road transportation to air pollution in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), \\(\\beta_{it}\\) is the estimated coefficient of the impact of on-road CO2 emissions per km2 on air pollution in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\) with the GTWR model, \\({\\text{CO}}_{2it}\\) denotes the average on-road CO2 emissions per km2 during the 14-year study period in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), and \\(Concentration_{it}\\) is the average concentration of air pollutant concentration in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\). The average contribution of on-road transportation to annually county-level PM2.5 concentration is 1.09% (range from 0% to 60.68%, 95% CI: 1.06–1.11%).\n\nImpacts of PM2.5 from on-road transportation on premature mortality\n\nThe results obtained from the GTWR model are applied to estimate the effects of air pollution on PM2.5-related mortality. Different from the coefficients estimated by the global models, the GTWR model indicates that the relationship between on-road transportation and PM2.5 concentration is temporally and spatially non-stationary. According to the calculations with Eq. (9), the contribution of on-road transportation to air pollution might either exceed 100% or be lower than 0%. Due to the effects of the other control variables and regression residuals, the contributions might exceed 100%. Additionally, a contribution lower than 0% suggests that on-road transportation emissions are a method to reduce air pollution, which is impossible and irrational. To estimate the mortality in the CONUS, we normalise the contribution of on-road transportation from 0 to 100%, as follows:\n\n$$C_{it} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {0,} \\hfill & {if\\;Con_{it} < 0} \\hfill \\\\ {Con_{i} ,} \\hfill & {if\\;0 \\le Con_{it} \\le 100\\% } \\hfill \\\\ {100\\% ,} \\hfill & {if\\;Con_{it} > 100\\% } \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \\(C_{i}\\) denotes the contribution of on-road transportation to air pollution ranging from 0 to 100% in county \\(i\\) and \\(Con_{it}\\) denotes the contribution (as a percentage) of on-road transportation to air pollution in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\) calculated with Eq. (9). It must be noted that all the \\(Con_{it}\\) based on the results of the GTWR are larger than 0 and smaller than 100%. The mortalities caused by air pollution originating from on-road transportation are also estimated as follows:\n\n$$MAPOR_{it} = MAP_{it} \\times C_{it}$$\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \\(MAPOR_{it}\\) is the number of mortalities caused by air pollution originating from on-road transportation in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), and \\(MAP_{it}\\) is the number of mortalities caused by PM2.5 in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\). \\(MAP_{i2010}\\) data are extracted from the previous study2. The premature deaths \\(MAP_{it}\\) in the CONUS are estimated as follows:\n\n$$MAP_{it} = MAP_{it - 1} \\times \\left[ {1 + CPD \\times \\left( {AP_{it} - AP_{it - 1} } \\right)} \\right]$$\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \\(MAP_{it - 1}\\) is the number of mortalities caused by PM2.5 in county \\(i\\) during year \\(t - 1\\), \\(CPD\\) is the coefficient between the increase of premature deaths and the increase of PM2.5 concentration, \\(AP_{it}\\) denotes the mean PM2.5 concentration (μg/m3) in county during year, and denotes the average PM2.5 concentration in county during year. The basic data for this process are 2010 data extracted from the previous research, which are approximately 54,730 in the CONUS in 2010, 54,905 in the whole U.S.2. The previous EPA report indicates a 1 μg/m3 decrease in annual average PM2.5 concentration is associated with a from 0.7% to 1.6% decrease in annual all-cause mortality45. Another study claims that a 10-μg/m3 decrease in PM2.5 is related to a 6%—7% decrease in mortality among elderly individual each per year46. Since the basic data in 2010 is about premature deaths, we assume that the coefficient of the relationship between premature deaths and annual PM2.5 concentration, in Eq. (12), is 1.2%/(μg/m3), the roughly average value of 0.7%/(μg/m3) and 1.6%/(μg/m3). The percentage of the premature deaths due to PM2.5 from on-road transportation is estimated as follows:\n\n$$PTA_{t} = MAPOR_{t} /MAP_{t} \\times 100\\%$$\n\n(13)\n\nwhere is the percentage of premature deaths due to PM2.5 from on-road transportation, is the total number of premature deaths due to PM2.5 from on-road transportation in the CONUS during year, and is the total number of premature deaths in the CONUS during year."
