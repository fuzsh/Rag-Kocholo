They had one child, Alice Lee Roosevelt.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early Life and Courtship by Theodore Roosevelt\n\n2 Marriage to Theodore Roosevelt\n\n3 Death\n\n3.1 Burial\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nEarly Life and Courtship by Theodore Roosevelt\n\nAlice was born in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts to banker George Cabot Lee and Caroline Watts Haskell. She was tall for the era at 5'6\", and seen as charming and strikingly beautiful. With \"blue-gray eyes and long, wavy golden hair\", she was called \"Sunshine\" by her family and friends, because of her cheerful disposition.[2][3] Theodore was quickly smitten by her.\n\nShe met Theodore \"T.R.\" Roosevelt, Jr. on October 18, 1878, at the home of her next-door neighbors, the Saltonstalls; T.R. was a classmate of young Richard Middlecott \"Dick\" Saltonstall (her cousin) at Harvard University. Of their first encounter, he would write, \"As long as I live, I shall never forget how sweetly she looked, and how prettily she greeted me.\"\n\nFor young T.R. it was \"love at first sight.\" By Thanksgiving (only a month after meeting her), he had decided Alice was to be his wife; the following June he proposed. She put T.R. off, however, taking another eight months before saying \"yes\".[4] It is unknown why she declined Theodore's first offer, but a classmate's fiancé later described him as being, \"studious, ambitious, eccentric — not the sort to appeal at first.\" Theodore then recruited his popular mother and sisters, whom he was very close to, to help court her.[5] Marriage to Theodore Roosevelt Alice left, with her sisters-in-law, Corinne and Anna (Bamie) Roosevelt\n\nOn February 13, 1880, an ecstatic Roosevelt recorded in his diary his great joy that the woman of his dreams, whom he had actively courted for more than a year, had finally accepted his proposal of marriage. Knowing that his love was reciprocated and that he could now \"hold her in my arms and kiss her and caress her and love her as much as I choose\" gave the enraptured young Roosevelt enormous satisfaction. They announced their engagement on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1880.\n\nAt age 19, Alice married Theodore on October 27, 1880 (his 22nd birthday), at the Unitarian Church in Brookline, Massachusetts. Among the guests at their wedding, and at the reception in the home of the bride's parents, was Edith Carow, later to become Roosevelt's second wife. The couple's \"proper\" honeymoon was delayed until the following summer by Theodore's acceptance into Columbia Law School and after two weeks at the family home in Oyster Bay the couple went to live with Theodore's widowed mother, Martha Stewart \"Mittie\" Bulloch.[6] Death\n\nAlice gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Alice Lee Roosevelt at 8:30pm on the night of February 12, 1884. Theodore was in Albany attending business on the Assembly floor because he was positive that the baby would be born on Valentine's Day, the four-year anniversary of their engagement. He received a telegram the next morning notifying him of the birth, and made arrangements to take leave from his duties that afternoon. When he later received another telegram informing him that Alice had taken ill, the commute was such that he did not arrive to his home until midnight, by which time Alice was in a semi-comatose state. He held her for two hours until alerted to his mother's deteriorating condition, two floors below in the Roosevelts' Manhattan home. Theodore's mother Mittie had been ill for several days with what would later be determined to be typhoid fever and died February 14, 1884 at 3:00 am. Theodore then rushed upstairs to his wife, whom he held for several hours until she died that afternoon from a case of undiagnosed kidney failure. Her pregnancy had masked the illness.[7] Her death occurred on Valentine's Day, the four-year anniversary of when their engagement was announced. She was 22 years old.\n\nTheodore was so distraught by Alice's death that except for a diary entry (\"The light has gone out of my life\"), he hardly ever spoke of her again, much to the frustration of their daughter. In a short, privately published tribute to Alice, Roosevelt wrote:\n\nShe was beautiful in face and form, and lovelier still in spirit; As a flower she grew, and as a fair young flower she died. Her life had been always in the sunshine; there had never come to her a single sorrow; and none ever knew her who did not love and revere her for the bright, sunny temper and her saintly unselfishness. Fair, pure, and joyous as a maiden; loving, tender, and happy. As a young wife; when she had just become a mother, when her life seemed to be just begun, and when the years seemed so bright before her—then, by a strange and terrible fate, death came to her. And when my heart's dearest died, the light went from my life forever.[8]\n\nRichard Nixon made reference to these comments upon his resignation from the presidency in 1974. Paying tribute to Roosevelt and his inner courage, he remarked that \"only when you have been in the deepest valley can you know how magnificent it is to reach the highest mountain\".\n\nTheir daughter Alice primarily got information on her from Theodore's elder sister Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt. So final was his decision to try to put Alice's loss out of his life, that she is not even mentioned by name in his autobiography.[9] Her own daughter, Paulina, was coincidentally born on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1925.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of his wife's death, Theodore turned the care of their newly-born infant daughter to his sister Bamie, and embarked on a period of self recovery. He went to his ranch in the badlands of Dakota Territory. From this interlude Roosevelt would emerge a renewed man and would go on to the Presidency of the United States in 1901. He and his second wife Edith Kermit Carow would take custody of young Alice at three years old.[10] Burial\n\nAlice Hathaway Lee was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, next to her mother-in-law Mittie, after a double funeral.
