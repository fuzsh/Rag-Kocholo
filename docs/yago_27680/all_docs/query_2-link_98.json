        "text": "Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. was the father of President Theodore Roosevelt and the grandfather of Eleanor Roosevelt, first lady and spouse of President F. D. Roosevelt. He was the son of Cornelius Van Schaick Roosevelt [1794-1871] and Margaret Barnhill. He also was a grandson of James Jacobus Roosevelt [1759-1840], the great grandson of Jacobus Roosevelt [1724-1777] and the great great-grandson of Johannes Roosevelt [1689-1750], head of the Oyster Bay Branch of the Roosevelt family.\n\nRoosevelt was a businessman and active in the family business of plate-glass importing. The family was wealthy and he was thus able to participate in philanthropy. He helped found the New York City’s Children’s Aid Society, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital. He was also a generous contributor to the Newsboys’ Lodging House and the YMCA.\n\nRoosevelt became active in the management of several charitable organizations. He organized the Bureau of United Charities and was a commissioner of the New York State Board of Charities. He was also a director of the Metropolitan Museum and of the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, Sr. married Martha Bulloch [1835-1884] of Rosswell, Georgia on December 22, 1853 when he was 22 and she was only 18. The marriage took place in Martha’s home, the family mansion named Bulloch Hall in Rosswell. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the mansion in 1905, a momentous and historic event for Rosswell.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, Sr. passed away at the all too young age of 46 on February 9, 1878. He apparently had been suffering from a gastrointestinal tumor which had been very painful. It was probably cancerous. At the time of his death, his son Theodore was at Yale as a student and was on his way to visit his father, but arrived too late.\n\nFor more detail on the Roosevelt family relationships see the appendix at the end of President Theodore Roosevelt’s personal bio profile.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nSeveral web sites including Wikipedia.org, oldnewyork.blogspot.com and randomhouse.com\n\nE-BOOKS AVAILABLE FROM AMAZON; GOOGLE: Kindle Store Pegels\n\nPROMINENT DUTCH AMERICANS, CURRENT AND HISTORIC\n\nEIGHT PROMINENT DUTCH AMERICAN FAMILIES: THE ROOSEVELTS, VANDERBILTS AND OTHERS, 2015\n\nFIFTEEN PROMINENT DUTCH AMERICAN FAMILIES: THE VAN BURENS, KOCH BROTHERS, VOORHEES AND OTHERS, 2015\n\nPROMINENT DUTCH AMERICANS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP POSITIONS, 2015\n\nDUTCH PEGELS INVOLVED IN WARS\n\nALLIED EUROPE CAMPAIGN—1944/1945: TACTICAL MISTAKES, 2017\n\nTHE SECOND WORLD WAR IN THE NETHERLANDS: MEMOIRS, 2017\n\nFRENCH REVOLUTION, NAPOLEON AND RUSSIAN WAR OF 1812, 2015"
