        "meta_description": "1878. Teddy Roosevelt, his first love, Alice Lee on the left, and her cousin Rose Saltonstall on the right. Theodore was 19, Alice was 17. Teddy was considered quite a dandy in his day, and always wore the latest fashions. I personally like his mutton chops a la Wolverine. Alice was wearing her hair in the latest \"waterfall curl\" style, later to become fashionable again in the 1920's. Note Rose's neat little reticule, attached by two chains to her skirt under her bodice.",
