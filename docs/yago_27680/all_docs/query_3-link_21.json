She was the eldest child of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and the only child he had with his first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee.\n\nLongworth led an unconventional and controversial life. Her marriage to Representative Nicholas Longworth III, a Republican party leader and 38th Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, was shaky, and her only child, Paulina, was from her affair with Senator William Edgar Borah.\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nWikipedia"
