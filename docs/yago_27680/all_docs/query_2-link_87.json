        "text": "June 21, 2024\n\nThis was a fascinating look at Theodore Roosevelt and the strong women that surrounded and bolstered him to become the historical icon that he is today.\n\nJune 19, 2024\n\nThank you Simon & Schuster Audio for the ALC and Simon Books #partner, for the finished copy of The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt in exchange for my honest review.\n\nAs soon as I saw this book, I knew I had to read it. I’m a huge fan of anything related to the Roosevelts, especially Teddy Roosevelt and I loved that this book in particular focused on the women who had an impact in his life. I love going deep into the lives of those who shape our leaders and this one ended up being just as fascinating and insightful as I hoped!\n\nThis book focuses on the strong women that Theodore Roosevelt was lucky to have in his life and how they helped shape him to be the man he ultimately ended up becoming. We learn a bit about his mother, Mittie; his first love and wife, Alice; his older sister, Bamie; his younger sister, Conie; and his second wife, Edith. I had come into this book already knowing a bit about Alice, having already read a historical fiction book about Teddy and her love, which I really loved. The other women I had a passing knowledge of and loved learning more about them. And I loved how Teddy wasn’t afraid to lean on these women, especially his sisters, when he was running for office or in office.\n\nThis book was very readable and engaging. It also has me wanting to do deep dives on each of the women themselves, which I love! I’m so glad to have this one in my collection…and I highly recommend picking it up!\n\nAudio thoughts: I love listening to nonfiction and I love when the author is able to narrate them. In this case, the author was able to effectively tell the story just the way he wanted. And the bonus content included at the end, the Roosevelt family recordings, was a cool bonus!\n\nYou can see all my reviews at: https://www.alwayswithabook.com/\n\nJuly 4, 2024\n\nThis was an interesting read about the six women who supported, advised, and loved TR through all his life.\n\nCharging up San Juan Hill, his South American exploratory expedition, living on a cattle ranch in the Badlands, hunting big game in Africa, TR as the macho and alpha male had the freedom to pursue his dreams because the women around him were the tight village whose opinions and loyalty he had faith in.\n\nMay 29, 2024\n\n3.5 stars\n\nThe O’Keefe mostly proves his thesis regarding the instrumental role of women in defining his political vision. However, he did not prove that Alice Lee had any influence on him. We are supposed to assume she’s smart because of her family’s progressive background. We all know that even the most brilliant families can have kids without that spark. Maybe she was a dud.\n\nThe only words we hear from Alice are from two letters. The first: “Teddy I long for some nice quiet little evenings with you alone. It makes me homesick to think I shall not see you for so long, for I love to be with you so much.… Don’t you think I am pretty good to write you every day? I suppose you laugh and say, these funny letters, they sound just like Alice.… I suppose you start today for Minnesota. Do keep well & enjoy yourself. Good night and sweet dreams. Your loving, Alice”. In the second she wrote to “My own dearest Teddy” with the wish it were the day of their wedding, adding: “I just long to be with you all the time and never separate from you, even for three weeks. Teddykins, I know you can make me happy and you must never think it would have been better for me, if we had never met; I should die without you now Teddy and there is not another man I ever could have loved in this world.”\n\nNeither letter speaks to either intelligence or political acumen. That doesn’t stop the O’Keefe, who then highlights a passage from one of Teddy’s letters: “I love to talk over everything with Baby,” Roosevelt wrote after the election. “From Politics to Poetry, and to read aloud to her, either from a History or standard novel or from the daily newspaper that forms our only intercourse with the outside world.” Again, the author claims, “Alice was clearly a woman sufficiently mature and intelligent to discuss politics and poetry and to share an interest in both history and the daily news. She was, in short, a Lee.” —Do note, in Teddy’s letter, that he reads TO her, and Teddy makes no mention of actually discussing things with her.\n\nThe author dismisses the baby talk that riddles Teddy’s letters to Alice, which, are a far cry from the intellectually lofty, albeit tender, correspondence between John and Abigail Adams. His missives are thickly sown with a mixture of infantilizing and idealizing epithets used to address and describe her. “Pretty,” “sweet,” “baby”—which became “baby wife” after the couple wed—alternate with “queen,” “purest queen,” “my pure flower,” “my pearl,” and “my sweet, pretty queen.” He also applied the more frankly erotic “witch” and “bewitching.” Such terms are fair fodder for those biographers and commentators who dismiss Alice and Theodore’s marriage to her as one-dimensional, but Roosevelt’s letters were never intended to be seen by anyone except her.” Um, I can’t imagine the Adamses wrote their letters primarily for posterity.\n\nI understand that Edith probably burned every letter between Teddy and Alice she could find. I have to believe, though, that Alice wrote letters to her family in Boston. Surely some of those letters survive. If so, they would quickly prove or disprove the O’Keefe’s belief in Alice’s intelligence and influence. In the meantime, I tend to agree with Edith’s summation of Alice Lee to stepdaughter Alice, that Alice 1.0 would have bored Teddy to tears if she had lived.\n\nO’Keefe’s extensive research illustrates the influence of the other women in Teddy’s life, even if he does quote from (Sylvia?) Morris and Dalton too frequently.\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nThe subtitle of the book describes the contents. I have read several biographies of Theodore Roosevelt covering his entire life or specific events such as Mexican American War, Amazon River, his lifelong interest in Conservation, etc. This is the first that has focused on the women in his life versus them playing a smaller role in other biographies. The author presents a well written and researched history of the role that his mother, wives and sisters played in his life and the development of his character. This is well worth the read especially for those interested in the live of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nI received a free Kindle copy of this book courtesy of Net Galley and the publisher with the understanding that I would post a review on Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon and my nonfiction book review blog. I also posted it to my Facebook page.\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\nThanks to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for the ARC of this book; I am leaving this review voluntarily.\n\nI've read a LOT about the Roosevelt family, and I'm happy to say that more attention is being paid to the women in Theodore's life, who helped shape him. First, there was his mother, Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt, who is said to have been the inspiration for Scarlett O'Hara. It's also been said that TR was more a Bulloch than a Roosevelt.\n\nThen there are his strong-willed sisters, Bamie and Corinne. Many who met her said Bamie could have been President. Both sisters would prove to be good sounding boards as Theodore rose in the ranks of political positions. Their influence is finally being looked at because TR was quite progressive for his time.\n\nBoth of Roosevelt's wives' effect on his life are explored. I'm glad more attention is being paid to Alice, his first wife, who died tragically after giving birth to her namesake. Most biographers gloss over the relationship and focus on her death. As for Edith, Teddy's lifelong love, she does not come across all too well, implying that she kept Theodore from his sisters and their influence.\n\nThis is not the first book I've read that revisits Roosevelt's history and takes a closer look at the women in his life and is an admirable work to add to the Roosevelt library.\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\nThis is a fantastic story told from the viewpoint of the many women behind the man. Wonderfully researched and flows so well. I could not stop listening! The author narrates and has a wonderful voice. (We all know that narrated books live and die with the speaker!) Love reading Presidential biographies and while I have only read the McCullough book on TR, this one has me intrigued to read more. The Roosevelt recordings at the end were a fabulous bonus. Highly recommend!\n\nAugust 4, 2024\n\nWhat a fascinating and much needed book! There are endless TR books, but none have the thesis that it was the women in his life that most helped shaped the man, the president. While the book predominantly focuses on TR, the author does a good job (admittedly, the author could have tied TR’s life to one of these 5 women’s little more often, but I acknowledge that he had limited primary sources to get his info from) connecting Teddy Roosevelt’s actions and thoughts to one or more of the most influential women in his life. Makes me proud to be a woman, and proud to have named my son after such an amazing man!\n\nJune 19, 2024\n\nNot me learning while reading! In my historical BAG rn\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nThis was a very interesting book about the woman in Teddy Roosevelt's life that helped him become who he was.\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nContrary to the impression given by the title, \"The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,\" this is not a book about TR's love affairs and romances. It's about the women in his life that helped him in his political life. Obviously, his wives and sisters were more to him than political operatives, but this book zeroes in on the critical roles they played in his rise to the presidency and his accomplishments while in the White House. His first wife was very ambitious for him, but she died young, after giving birth to their first child, Alice. His second wife, less ambitious, was a reluctant advisor, but once she accepted TR's political aspirations, was extremely helpful in obvious ways (First Lady duties), and less obvious ways (charming information out of potential allies and adversaries). TR's sisters Corinne and Bamie were even more helpful, especially Bamie, who in addition to helping to raise Alice, was even more politically-minded than TR. It can be argued that she set the path to the Presidency and TR followed it. This is a readable and well-researched book that focuses on a less-studied aspect of the Roosevelt Presidency, and high time, too! (Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for a digital review copy.)\n\nJune 29, 2024\n\nI want to thank Netgalley and Simon & Schuster Publishing for a copy of this book.\n\nO’Keefe has written an excellent biography of Theodore Roosevelt. Integrating personal events, first-hand sources, and providing historical context he paints a vivid picture of his subject. The book is written to follow Roosevelt from childhood to his time as a wayward college student to Roosevelt's rise to the highest levels of political power in the United States. If you are interested in Roosevelt and USA history this is an excellent read. However, if I am honest, I struggled with this book. While it is well written and the amount of research that went into this book is truly something to be commended, I did not feel that it was entirely what the title and blurb advertised. I wanted to learn more about the women who had important roles in Roosevelt’s life and political career but often felt that they were lost in the historical facts and Roosevelt’s thoughts. My struggles were compounded by the fact that I found everyone central to this book is inherently unlikable, which is nearly the exact opposite of what O’Keefe believes.\n\nThe focus of this book is Roosevelt and his place in history and how people and events shaped his worldview. While some interesting sections focus on how these women contributed to events, they are far from the focus of these sections or the book. They do make more of an appearance in the later part of the book when Roosevelt is ill and after his death, but it takes a long time to get to that part.\n\nMy favourite part was the sections that discussed Roosevelt’s courting of Alice Hathaway Lee and Edith Kermit Carow. I have read about Edith before, but this was my first exposure to Alice and the way that she became the wife of Roosevelt. These sections of the book made me dislike Roosevelt even more as the book went on. In many descriptions, it felt like he was spiteful toward Edith and then love-bombed Alice because he liked her family and she was just the gateway he could use to become a member of the family. O’Keefe also continues to highlight how Edith felt some level of anger that Roosevelt married Alice at all, and it truly felt like there was an insidious component to this dynamic that is entirely lost to history. Yes, Edith could have simply been jealous, but it’s clear from the evidence presented by O’Keefe that something happened with Edith that hurt Roosevelt's pride and that is why he even started to pursue Alice.\n\nFurthermore, in many sections, it felt a bit that Edith’s impact was undercut and that she was not discussed in a well-rounded fashion throughout the book. Many of the sources highlight the support of her husband’s decisions and while I do not doubt that she did support Roosevelt’s decisions to varying degrees some of the situations seem a bit like she just acquiesced to Roosevelt’s desires. For instance, she has a baby and experiences a complication. Roosevelt then decides that this is an excellent time to fight in Cuba. However, before disembarking Edith comes from her sick bed to see her husband and “give her blessing” to Roosevelt going off to fight. O’Keefe then argues that Roosevelt goes off knowing he had Edith’s support, but then quotes that Roosevelt had every intention of fighting even if his wife (and son who was also ill) might have died. Perhaps it is because no first-hand accounts of the sources survive, but the picture of Edith in this book is that she was overbearing to Roosevelt and highly influential, but it didn’t read that way. One thing that is clear about Edith is that she did not enjoy the spotlight as much as her in-laws did and because she had a strong personality people may have read a bit too much into her influence or motivations.\n\nI did appreciate how O’Keefe did not shy away from the fact that Roosevelt’s wives and sisters played an important role in his political career, even if they were not the central focus. However, their overall impact feels rather glossed over in many sections. For example, Conie’s, his sister's, influence is hardly mentioned in great detail until the last two chapters of the book. Discussing her within the context of events, Conie is highlighted as being present for meetings that Roosevelt had as governor and that she married a man she did not love. Most of her appearances are in quotes from her book about her brother. Therefore, it feels as if Conie may have played a greater role in the legacy of her brother rather than having an impact during Roosevelt’s career. In many ways, Conie is eclipsed by Bamie, Roosevelt's older sister. Arguably played a greater role in Roosevelt’s political rise as she was unmarried for a longer period of her life and was physically located closer to Roosevelt. I would argue that the interplay between Bamie and Roosevelt in the pursuit of politics was the only real relationship to highlight how Roosevelt had the support of women in his pursuits.\n\nO’Keefe also seems to undercut the book's central argument that these women helped make Roosevelt president, by highlighting that neither his sisters nor his wife wanted him to take the Vice President nomination. Granted the assassination of McKinley thrust Roosevelt into the presidency, but it highlighted something that I felt throughout the book, that the women in Roosevelt’s life were simply trying to make lemonade out of the lemons that Roosevelt continued to hand them. Especially since Roosevelt tended to run when confronted with grief. (See Bamie raising her niece Alice Lee Roosevelt while Roosevelt went off to farm in North Dakota.)\n\nOverall, if you are interested in learning about Theodore Roosevelt and/or the history of the United States during his lifetime I would highly recommend this book. O’Keefe accomplishes the hard task of balancing personal interest in the subject matter and evaluating the person’s flaws, successes, and motivations. However, if you want to learn about the Roosevelt women you might be a little disappointed by reading this particular book as they are more supporting characters rather than the focus of this book.\n\nContent Warnings\n\nGraphically described in text: Alcoholism, Death, Xenophobia, Toxic relationship, War, Racial slurs, Racism, Alcohol, Chronic illness, Emotional abuse, Gun violence, Sexism, Terminal illness, Cursing, Grief, Injury/Injury detail, Miscarriage, Animal death, Child death, Classism, Colonisation, Death of a parent, Genocide, Misogyny, Pregnancy, and Addiction\n\nModerately described in text: Drug use and Slavery\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\nEdward F. O'Keefe's The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt is a well-researched and unique insight into some of the key players into the character and actions of President Theodore Roosevelt. O'Keefe starts off with Roosevelt's parents, grandparents, etc. to set the stage for his birth and early life. After the introduction of his family history, it follows Roosevelt through his life and the women whom he loved including his sisters, mother, friends, and lovers. It details the sway that the women surrounding Roosevelt had on his opinions and actions in politics and throughout his life.\n\nAlthough I am an admirer of Teddy Roosevelt in regards to his progressive thoughts and actions regarding the environment, I knew very little about himself and his life. This probably wasn't the best book to start in terms of getting to know the man, but it was a fascinating read that displays a different side of the president and the impact others made on his life. His sisters, wives, and mother were obviously strong, determined, and incredibly intelligent women who shaped Roosevelt and American politics in a way few realize.\n\nIt is a great read for anyone interested in women's history, Theodore Roosevelt, and the Gilded Age-era politics.\n\nThank you Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for the ARC in return for my honest review.\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\nThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President is author and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation Edward F. O’Keefe’s first book. And if this one is any indication, I can’t wait to read many more from him. So often, TR is characterized by his masculinity, often to a point of parody. But Roosevelt is remarkable not solely based on his “manly” exploits, but because of his drive, passion, courage, and empathy. All traits which were seen, bolstered, and inherited from by the women in his life. Here we have a definitive account of the many women in Roosevelt’s life and how each of them—from his mother to his sisters to his wives and daughters—impacted him and made him the Roosevelt we know and love (or at least I do!) It’s heartening to see this book be added to the Roosevelt library as we see in O’Keefe’s pages a keen sense in highlighting the importance of these women and illuminating each of their complex personal and public roles, character, and beliefs. Of particular note, I loved the details with Alice Lee Roosevelt (often overlooked in Roosevelt’s life aside from her death) and his sister, Bamie. Of course, it is Edith Kermit Roosevelt who dominates the pages here, as she did in Roosevelt’s life from their childhood days to his final ones. My one qualm with this is I wish I could have heard more from O’Keefe’s own voice. So often we read here quotes or full passages from the texts of other Roosevelt scholars and historians. As much as I enjoy re-reading from the likes of David McCullough and Edmund Morris, I would have loved to read more of O’Keefe’s own perspective and insight. Still, the compiling of research here is exceptional and the prose is easy and enjoyable to digest. A strong recommendation from me and I can’t wait for others to learn about the remarkable lives and experiences of the women behind the president. Thank you Simon & Schuster for the copy!\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\nI enjoy reading about our historic Presidents and Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite subjects. I was very interested in reading this particular book due to the author's prestigous position. The author is particulary well versed in Roosevelt history as he is the CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation . His research here is exemplery. This reader appreciates the time and research the author put into writing this book. This is outstanding work.\n\nThank you to the publisher, to Net Galley and to the author for the opportunity for review. My review opinons are my own.\n\nThis book is fascinating as it features the women who shaped his life. From his Mother Mittie who was a independent thinker and brave enough to stand up for her beliefs in her time. Then to his sisters who influenced Roosevelt politically and otherwise. He had strong intelligent outspoken women in his upbringing. You are given a sense of where he gained his compassion, care for the enviornment and passion for causes he believed in. I appreciate how the author features the women each indepedent of each other and their profound impact on Roosevelt . This gives them a rightful place in history that they are deserving of. His two wives are featured of their contributions especially his first wife Alice who is often forgetten in history. Both wives impacted the man he came to be.\n\nI found this book a exemplary historical read and highly recommend this body of work for all who enjoy Roosevelt and our early Presidential history. Well done to the author and thank you.\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nIn this excellent biography of Mittie Roosevelt, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, Bamie and Conie Roosevelt, and Edith Roosevelt, O’keefe brings Theodore Roosevelt’s mother, sisters, wives, and eldest daughter to life. Giving these important and educated women a central place in the 26th president’s life, O’Keefe focuses on the lives of these women and where their influence appears in Theodore Roosevelt’s life and career. Focusing on how these women’s stories interact and intersect with each other and with Theodore Roosevelt, this complex narrative highlights their centrality to his life and appropriately acknowledges their importance. A distinctly different approach from other biographies of Roosevelt (which focus on his hypermasculinity and macho-ness), these women’s roles and O’Keefe’s analytical lens create a new perspective for viewing Roosevelt which could easily apply to the stories of other prominent men from history. O’Keefe’s prose is engaging and descriptive, supplemented by historical documentation, and this book is readable for historians and casual fans alike. Books such as this are critical to reinterpreting history and giving women close to power their due diligence in the historical record. While Roosevelt’s wives often get covered in biographies about him, his mother and sisters are less documented, and O’Keefe does an excellent job including Mittie, Bamie, and Conie Roosevelt throughout this book and his life.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for the advance copy.\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\nThanks to Simon and Schuster for an advanced copy of The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt by Edward F. O'Keefe. This book is all about the amazing women in Teddy's life.\n\nI love Presidential biographies and Teddy is one of my favorite Presidents so seeing a book focused on the women in Teddy's life I was intrigued. I already love his daughter Alice and knew a little about his first wife Alice, so I was excited to read more about Roosevelt's mom Mittie, his older sister Bamie, younger sister Conie and second wife Edith.\n\nI found this book interesting and engaging. I really enjoyed learning more about Bamie and Conie's influence and how much he relied on Bamie's advice as one of his key advisors and that Conie served as his Press Secretary before the role even existed.\n\nI was impressed with the author's research - he is the CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation.\n\nIf you're a history, presidential or TR fan you'll enjoy this book!\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nTheodore Roosevelt is my favorite President, probably because I went to TR High School. This is the first biography I’ve read that focuses on the women in his life: his mother, two sisters, and two wives. Author Edward F O’Keefe shows how these women supported him in traditional ways, but also challenged him. While at Harvard TR wrote in favor of equal pay for women, the influence of his first wife, Alice. As Governor of New York and President of the United States, his sisters, Bamie and Conie, and second wife, Edith, would often be in the room when serious matters were discussed. The other men would ignore the women, thinking they didn’t understand the matters under discussion, but they would listen and then counsel Roosevelt. In fact TR’s niece, Eleanor Roosevelt, believed that if her Auntie Bye (Bamie) had been a man, it would have been her and not TR elected President so astute was she when it came to politics.\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\nAn exhaustive account of the women in TR's life who influenced his decisions and career. If there was ever doubt that spouses and siblings impact a presidency, this book will put that notion to rest. TR's wives and particularly his sisters played significant roles. O'Keefe points out that when he ignored their advice, TR often found himself on the wrong side of history. I came away with a complex understanding of the man who I knew as a 'rough riding' republican politician. But he was so much more: a sensitive and cultured romantic, a devoted husband, loving brother and father, a poet and author... O'Keefe could be the next David McCullough (who died in 2022) and who he quotes several times. I'm left with what TR had to say about democracy and the presidency. I paraphrase: The U.S. can't truly claim to be a democracy until a Black and a Jew serve as president. His attitude toward women was equally inclusive, due largely to the importance of the women in his life.\n\nJuly 19, 2024\n\nAnyone that knows me knows that I am no stranger to the life and times of Theodore Roosevelt. Outside of teaching him to 16 and 17 year-olds each year for 15 years, I have read about 10 books on my own about him. There's not a ton of ground that I haven't covered. As Julia Child is Julie's inspiration in one of my favorite movies, Teddy has become my person (much to my son, Theodore's, recent eyerolls).\n\nUnfortunately, the study of history can be reduced to self-important (mostly white) men who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps to build the country or their company or both. The study of Theodore Roosevelt is no different. That is why Edward O'Keefe's book was refreshing. It did the overview of the life of Teddy, but focused on the women in his life and how they impacted him from birth to death. We all have been shaped by our moms, sisters, wifes, daughters, and nieces. It was cool and significant to see those fingerprints on Teddy. It made him even more relatable.\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nI first learned of this book when I heard the author being interviewed on PBS. The premise of the book was interesting; the women in his life who influenced him including his mother, his sisters and his wives. The book was well written and the author had clearly done his research that included reading TR's diaries and letters written to and from him. The hardback book was 464 pages but I read the Kindle version and only managed to make it through 14% of the book. When I left off, TR still hadn't finished college. I couldn't manage to read more although I suppose if I were a true TR follower/researcher I would have plowed my way through the book. There are so many other books to read it's a matter of priorities and which books you choose to finish.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nAugust 2, 2024\n\nI won this book in a Goodreads giveaway. I was pretty excited to win this book. I can’t say I knew too much about Theodore Roosevelt so I was glad to get the opportunity to at least learn about the women in his life. This book was the opposite of what I thought it would be. I think this book is more about TR than the actual women in his life. It tells the story of TR with sprinkles of the history of the women in his life. I thought it would follow the women and sprinkle TR into their story. The author does explain that a lot of the history was destroyed through the years and I know history hasn’t been known to follow “side characters” of someone’s life very often. Ultimately, I did like the book because it did tell me a lot about TR that I didn’t know before I read this book.\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nWhat a perfect read! This book was very different from any TR book that I have read. I mean, it mentions things like San Juan Hill and the Presidency, but this book focuses on the women that shaped TR. We first meet his dear mother, Mittie , who was so strong and laid the foundation of what we know of the man, Teddy Roosevelt. Then there is the love. He didn’t know was his soul-mate, Edith, who was true to him all through her life. His beautiful first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee, who left him too soon and left him a daughter that was a lot like TR himself. And finally, his dear sisters, Conie and Bamie, both of whom would do so much for him from cradle to the highest office in the land. I adored this look from the female side and not his rough, rugged, naturalist side.\n\nJanuary 25, 2024\n\nIm usually intimidated when it comes to books of this genre but I must say I was fully immersed and the writing style was not just informational but it had a story like flow that held my attention. It had wit, it was easily digestible and Im glad to have learned the woman who shaped Theodore Roosevelt. I particularly loved all the quotes before each chapter. Thank you Simon & Schuster, NetGalley and Edward O'Keefe for this advance copy in exchange for honest review.\n\nJune 13, 2024\n\nPerhaps more than any other President, Theodore Roosevelt commands a macho, swashbuckling persona from the Dakota badlands to seizure of the Panama Canal. This unique and new entry onto the shelf of T.R. lit reminds us of the pivotal role played by women in the formation and direction of Teddy's robust life and career. A Georgia born belle of a mother raising a family in Civil War New York City, confederate sympathies and relatives intact. A powerful character of an older sister, Bamie, and an adoring younger sibling, Corinne. While the sisters have been well researched and written in a wealth of histories, mother Mittie appears in these pages kinder and gentler shepherding her delicate and asthmatic son. Friend Edith Carrow appears early, and somewhat exits center stage in her late teens after a still mysterious romantic break with Teddie. Enter the willowy and beautiful Bostonian Alice Lee, and Teddy is besotted. An early marriage, a career rising like a rocket, the birth of a daughter and a double tragedy: Mother Mittie and new mother Alice die within hours of one another, in a gloomy, fog shrouded New York City. But it is Alice who sticks in my mind and remains with the reader in the authors rescue and retelling of her story. NOT the pretty dimwit of history often portrayed. Not the bore damned in memory by her successor, the formidable and history defining second wife and First Lady Edith Roosevelt. O'Keefe paints an Alice of firm opinion on women's rights, influencing Theodore, and a prophet of her young husband's ability, destiny as a leader, a special place in history. I will never look at Alice Lee again in the same way. For me, mother Mittie and tragic Alice Lee are newly discovered and defined. The others, sisters Bamie and Corinne, I have known through Betty Boyd Caroli's excellent 1998 The Roosevelt Women. Edith I enjoyed forty years ago in the pioneer and perhaps very best of all First Lady biographies, Sylvia Juke Morris' Edith Kermit Roosevelt. Firm but more personally flawed(human?) in O'Keefe's telling, down from the pedestal. Tart tongued daughter Alice and good niece Eleanor are here, but in minor supporting roles. I especially enjoyed Eleanor's observations on her relatives. O'Keefe did his original research, in the Harvard collection and others, but he notes in detail his indebtedness to those who went before: Caroli, Sylvia and Edmund Morris, and Kathleen Dalton who has penned the best single volume Theodore. O'Keefe stands on their shoulders but defines his own new ground in this enjoyable and important new read.\n\nRead\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\nLoved the historical details and deep dive into the women who made Theodore Roosevelt into the larger-than-life president who looms large in history. He was surrounded by women who shaped and molded him into a man who could endure immense pain and suffering, both physically and mentally. The women behind the making of a president don't get enough praise, and I am glad the author chose to highlight these formidable women in their own right!\n\nJune 25, 2024\n\nThis book is a great example of why I read history even though I've been out of school for a VERY LONG TIME. Theodore Roosevelt never really captured my attention until a few years ago and now I like to read everything I can find about him. He'd be so interesting to have around today. This book really shows his humanity and provides some good insights into his personality. Well worth your time to read.\n\nJuly 7, 2024\n\nA gift for Mother's Day from my husband :-)\n\nI have read two other period pieces about Theodore Roosevelt so I was pleasantly surprised to learn much more from this book. A dear mother and sisters; and two wives. Female influence in the late 19th century into 1900's. A full biography of TR's childhood, early adulthood, adventures in the Dakota's, as well as President. I also found so much inspiration in the Roosevelt women that surrounded his life."
