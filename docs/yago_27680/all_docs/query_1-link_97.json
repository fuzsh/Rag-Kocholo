        "text": "It uncorked a whole flurry of questions and semi-related tangents. If you have any additional questions (or any answers!), pop them into the comments below. üëá\n\nWould she have been Theodore‚Äôs namesake instead of her brother?\n\nAlice was the only child of Theodore and Alice Roosevelt. Her brother Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. (born Theodore Roosevelt III, confusingly. See Exhibit A below for more), Edith Roosevelt‚Äôs first born, was named after their father. But if Alice was a boy, would she have been named Theodore instead since she was first?\n\nAnd if Theodore, Jr. wasn‚Äôt the namesake‚Ä¶ would he have made different decisions during his life, feeling less pressure to live up to his father‚Äôs name‚Ä¶?\n\nWould Male Alice have carried around a snake?\n\nOr cut her wedding cake with a sword?\n\nAs a Roosevelt male, she would possess power and attention and possibility ‚Äî and perhaps wouldn‚Äôt need big dramatic attention-grabbing gestures‚Ä¶?\n\nWould Warren G. Harding have died so young?\n\nThough spry and downright youthful compared to the sickly Woodrow Wilson he succeeded, Harding died of a heart attack at 57 years old. Maybe if he wasn‚Äôt president, Harding wouldn‚Äôt have died so soon. Maybe it was too taxing on his heart to flirt with all of the young ladies when traveling the country. See Exhibit B\n\nCalvin Coolidge finished the rest of his Harding‚Äôs term.\n\nWould Calvin Coolidge‚Äôs son have lived?\n\nIf Harding was never president and Coolidge never took over for him, Calvin, Jr. wouldn‚Äôt have come ‚Äúhome‚Äù from college to the White House. Nor would he have played tennis there. Or developed a blister from it. He wouldn‚Äôt have died from blood poisoning.\n\nWould Cal have been so silent?\n\nAccording to one biography I read, Silent Cal wasn‚Äôt as silent before his son died.\n\nIf Coolidge was never president, would Hoover have been‚Ä¶?\n\nI mean, the whole trajectory of the country could have changed!\n\nWhat about FDR?\n\nWhat if Male Alice actual ran against FDR? Can you even imagine an election with two relatives ‚Äî with the same last name! ‚Äî pitted against each other? When Ted Roosevelt ran for governor, Eleanor Roosevelt campaigned for his opponent Al Smith. Not only that ‚Äî she had a ‚Äúteapot‚Äù with steam on her car ‚Äî a dig at her cousin‚Äôs alleged involvement in the Teapot Dome Scandal. See Exhibit C\n\nFor more on the Teapot Dome Scandal and the 20s in general, watch this Crash Course on The Roaring 20s and maybe your brain will spiral into even more possible outcomes.\n\nIf FDR was never president, what would have happened in World War II?\n\nSimilar to Harding, FDR had a heart condition. Unlike Harding, it wasn‚Äôt undiagnosed. His doctor advised him to work only four hours a day. (The position of Leader of the Free World ‚Äî during a world war no less! ‚Äî as a part-time gig? Yikes.) Despite knowing he was sick, he continued to run for reelection ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt fill in his third vice president (Harry Truman) on his condition or the goings-on of the war. Truman was only vice president for 82 days and attended just two meetings (not counting cabinet meetings) with FDR before he died. (Henry Wallace, FDR‚Äôs second vice president, was ousted from the ticket in ‚Äò44 for being too into astrology/mysticism, too short-fused, and too liberal.) See Exhibit D\n\nIf FDR never was never elected president an unprecedented four times, would we have term limits today?\n\n[cue shiver running down spine]"
