        "text": "FARGO — Ed O’Keefe’s original literary ambition was to write a book about Theodore Roosevelt’s formative adventures in the American West.\n\nHe admired Roosevelt, an inescapable figure encountered on family vacations in Medora and Theodore Roosevelt National Park, and at home at Grand Forks’ Red River High School, home of the Roughriders sports teams.\n\nThe book idea crystallized when O’Keefe had the opportunity of a lifetime: access to Harvard's Houghton Library, a major repository of records and artifacts chronicling Roosevelt’s eventful life, which came through a fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nSo, he stole away to the library whenever he had free time, packing a lunch so he wouldn’t have to leave, and combed through letters between Roosevelt and his family.\n\n“As I did the research, I kept encountering these amazing women,” O’Keefe said. The image of “Rushmore Roosevelt, chiseled in stone” began to break apart as Roosevelt’s struggles and vulnerabilities emerged in the letters, where he was nurtured by support from his mother, two sisters and two wives.\n\n“He was made of flesh and bone,” O’Keefe said. “He needed help at many points in his life.”\n\nThat realization sparked inspiration for a very different book, “ The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women who Created a President ,” published Tuesday, May 7, by Simon & Schuster.\n\nWhile conducting his research, O’Keefe discovered a cache of letters that had become available since seminal biographies by historians David McCullough and Edmund Morris. The letters were locked in a safe for 70 or 80 years and, when discovered, donated to Harvard, Roosevelt’s alma mater.\n\nThe private letters yielded a fuller understanding of the important role women played in Roosevelt’s life — an understanding at odds with the decidedly masculine image of Roosevelt, famous as the Dakota Badlands cowboy, big-game hunter, Rough Rider and proponent of the “strenuous life.”\n\nThe letters revealed that each of the essential women in Roosevelt’s life played a distinct and important role.\n\n“He’s leaning on each of these people in his life for a totally different purpose, and he did this his whole life,” O’Keefe said in an interview with The Forum.\n\nThe “sharp-tongued and witty” letters from Martha Bulloch Roosevelt, known as Mittie, came alive with “coy turns of phrase and strong personality” that “practically leaped from the page,” leaving no doubt that she was the mother of the 26th president, he wrote.\n\nAnna Roosevelt Cowles, known as Bamie, was her younger brother’s “key political advisor and strategist” — a woman whose political acumen was so sharp that Roosevelt’s oldest daughter believed that if she had been a man she would have risen to the presidency.\n\nCorinne Roosevelt Robinson, called Conie, was Roosevelt’s “confidante and emotional outlet,” as well as his younger sister, “her brother’s press secretary before there was such a thing.”\n\nConie was especially helpful to Roosevelt when he served as governor of New York. In a letter to her brother, Conie wrote, “Haven’t we had fun being governor of New York?”\n\n“That’s pretty extraordinary,” O’Keefe said.\n\nAt many points, when it seemed Roosevelt’s political career was over, he consistently turned to Bamie for advice and Conie for support, O’Keefe said.\n\nBamie also served as an example of gritty determination to Roosevelt. She was born with a spinal defect that was the source of chronic, debilitating pain. But she didn’t allow the condition to hold her back.\n\nRoosevelt’s two wives also played critical supportive roles. Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, who family called “Sunshine,” was strong-willed, “strikingly beautiful” and infused Roosevelt with the ambition to make his mark in life.\n\nRoosevelt, whose first aim was to become a naturalist, concluded that he had to pursue a more distinguished career to win her hand in marriage. O'Keefe concluded that was why Roosevelt took a sharp swerve into politics and law school.\n\n“Pretty much everyone writes her off as inconsequential, and that’s just not true,” he said.\n\nAs an undergraduate at Harvard, Roosevelt came off to many of his classmates as a comical figure, but Alice saw something in him that others missed, according to O’Keefe.\n\nInterestingly, it took help from Roosevelt’s mother and sisters to win over Alice, “who was completely and totally out of his league,” he said\n\nAlthough brief, Roosevelt’s four years with Alice were some of his most successful. “In his own words, he rose like a rocket,” becoming an influential state legislator despite his young age, O’Keefe said.\n\nAlice died at the tragically young age of 22, however — on the same day as Roosevelt’s mother, a dual calamity that famously prompted him to seek solace in the rugged desolation of Dakota Territory’s Little Missouri Badlands.\n\nTwo years after becoming a young widower, Roosevelt quietly married his childhood sweetheart, Edith Kermit Carow, who became his partner and closest adviser, able to deliver stern guidance and manage the family’s finances — and cleverly manage Roosevelt in ways he didn’t seem to notice, O’Keefe found.\n\nEdith watched helplessly as her alcoholic father failed in business, diminishing the family’s finances and standing. “It hardened her,” O’Keefe said.\n\nRoosevelt and Carow had known each other since age 3, and she was his first love. But something happened when they were 17 that caused them to abruptly end their relationship.\n\n“They were a gas can and a match at age 17,” O’Keefe said. “And then fate intervened,” through Alice’s death.\n\nThe impression among those who have studied Roosevelt is that the devastating loss of Alice caused Roosevelt to banish her from his thoughts in order to function. The letters — and the discovery that he kept a lock of her hair in a box — reveal otherwise.\n\n“It showed that he had not purged Alice from his memory,” O’Keefe said.\n\nO’Keefe, who studied government and psychology at Georgetown University, sought to examine overlooked inner aspects of Roosevelt’s life.\n\n“I was really interested in the emotional life and vulnerability of such a strong man,” he said.\n\nIn writing the book, O’Keefe tried to “present a flesh and blood TR, the real person. Not the caricature. He was a deeply complex person.”\n\nTo submerge his sorrows, Roosevelt occupied his mind and body with vigorous pursuits throughout his life. A maxim in his life: “Black care rarely sits behind a rider whose pace is fast enough.”\n\nBlack care was a euphemism. “I think it’s another way to say, 'I’m depressed,'” O’Keefe said.\n\nAfter losing the presidential election in 1912, when he ran as a “Bull Moose” candidate trying to return to the White House, Roosevelt experienced serious depression, according to his daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longworth.\n\n“That doesn’t diminish TR,” O’Keefe said. “In fact, it deepens my respect. He found his way through in the way he needed to survive.”\n\nThroughout his life, Roosevelt took physical risks and placed himself in dangerous situations, but he didn’t have a death wish, O’Keefe said.\n\n“I think of it as a life wish,” he said. “He knew life was precarious and not of his own design.”\n\nWhile still at Harvard in 2019, O’Keefe sold his book proposal to Simon & Schuster. Later that year, he became CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation which is building the library on a bluff in Medora .\n\nResearching and writing a book while also holding a demanding job along with family responsibilities proved challenging. While traveling, he packed minimal clothes to leave room in his suitcase for books and research materials.\n\n“I stole time at nights, on weekends, on airplane rides,” he said.\n\nDuring his research, O’Keefe gained fresh insights into Roosevelt’s time in the Badlands.\n\nThe cache of letters that recently became available includes some letters from 1885, the year after Roosevelt went to Medora to begin the life of an open-range stockman, a period of his life that has been a blank spot for biographers and historians.\n\n“We just don’t have much for that time,” O’Keefe said. “These letters are extraordinary. They fill in the gaps.”\n\nAs shown by his restorative time in the Badlands, Roosevelt found renewal from being outdoors.\n\n“He used nature as the tonic in his life,” O’Keefe said. “Dakota and the Badlands are the place that saved his life.”\n\nAt Theodore Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch north of Medora, the wives of his two ranch hands gave birth to children, adding a decidedly domestic aspect to what otherwise was a masculine environment. “His Elkhorn Ranch became a veritable day care in his time in North Dakota,” O’Keefe said.\n\nIn fact, shortly after they were married in December 1886, Edith considered taking up the life of a ranching wife.\n\n“Edith contemplated moving to Medora,” O’Keefe said. “That was a surprising thing.”\n\nBut those plans died when the killer winter of 1886-87 wiped out much of Roosevelt’s cattle herd — and changed the course of his life, including a return to politics."
