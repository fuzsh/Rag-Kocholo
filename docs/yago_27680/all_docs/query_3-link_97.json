        "text": "On this day, February 12th, 1884, Alice Lee Roosevelt Longworth was born to Alice Hathaway Lee and future US President Theodore Roosevelt. She was born in the family home at 6 West 57th St.\n\nTwo days after her birth, her mother died of undiagnosed Bright's disease, and the same day, her paternal grandmother, Martha Bulloch Roosevelt died of Typhoid. This combination of events caused her father to be extremely distraught and the newborn Alice was taken care of by Theodore's sister, Anna Barnie Roosevelt, who would long be a great influence in her life.\n\nIn 1886, Theodore re-married and Alice was then raised by her father and step-mother, though Barnie would continue to be actively involved with raising the independent Alice.\n\nAlice eventually became quite the socialite and during her father's presidency he was said to have commented, \"I can either run the country or I can attend to Alice, but I cannot possibly do both.\"\n\nAlice eventually married Nicholas Longworth, a Republican US Representative from Cincinnatti, a city for which Alice had little love. Their marriage was far from a happy one, and the two even campaigned on behalf of opposing presidential candidates in the 1912 Presidential Election.\n\nShe was a political force in Washington throughout her life, and was even referred to as \"The other Washington Monument.\"\n\nShe died in 1980."
