        "text": "It’s sad to admit, but I buy vynils only for the sake of collecting and showing them off (plus they look great on the wall of any college kid) One thing is for sure, labels never send promotional vynils because that’s what’s hot right now, but you need some friends from La Madre Patria so they can send you the goodies, because unlike any other country in Iberoamerica, the Spaniard labels are on top of the business offering vynils to the market. In some cases, such as Anntona’s En La Cama Con Anntona, the album is given for free as a digital release and they produce a limited number of copies to sell to those people, who like me, want to have the physical thing but will be hearing the songs on the iPod.\n\nWell, there’s that, I received Single’s latest 7’’ titled “Mr. Shijou” but never listened to it, although the artwork cover always intrigued me. But then yesterday, Rulo from Reactor tweeted that the song was the best he had heard this month and maybe the whole year, and he’s not kidding, it is one of the songs to keep in this 2009. For those not aware of this band, this is the project by Teresa Iturrioz and Ibon Errazkin, whose previous works have been featured on our now gone Rocolas. They’re everything Fangoria isn’t, and that’s why I like them so much, don’t get me wrong Fangoria is had its interesting time but now I find them boring? Teresa has a thing for birds, they’re always present and although this time the cover doesn’t feature this animal, you’ll hear plenty of them as they are the soul of this track.\n\nWho is Mr. Shoji? He’s a Japanese DJ who has collaborated with the act on previous albums. “Yo y Mr. Shoji tenemos un asunto” the band explains the reason behind creating the track, they have an issue to resolve, it’s a well-kept secret but seems like they always wanted to do this song and finally got the chance to do it, that’s the easy/lazy interpretation. The song ask for exaggerated guesses, I’d like to think it’s a combat between a man in a horse (Mr. Shoji) and the girl surrounded by birds (Teresa), kind of a dazzling fight a la Kill Bill.\n\nCALIDOSOUND, SUPERLITIO\n\nVolumen 7, Colombia\n\nRating: 63\n\nBy Carlos Reyes\n\nSuperlitio is according to a majority, the new most important alternative band from Colombia, but it took them almost five years to release another album after the highly acclaimed Tripping Tropicana which earned them a Latin Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Colombian rock seems oddly overlooked, thing is, most of the attention goes to popstars Shakira and Juanes, or the tropi-pop sounds of Fanny Lu and Fonseca. A very good friend from Bogota tells me he is “ashamed” (harsh word) to see that such a mediocre act as Don Tetto is seen as the present and future of his country’s alternative scene, and it really is ridiculous, starting with the fact that Aterciopelados is continuing to make tremendously enchanting albums, too good to start making plans to pass the crown.\n\nIs there is an alternative scene? Yes, (they do run Rock Al Parque, the second biggest music fest in Latin America), but with few picks worthy to check; Colombian press has been fussing around Doctor Krapula but I’m not buying it, Sanalejo is better but not particularly great, so I would point to Cabas, Monareta, Choc Quib Town, Bomba Estereo and Superlitio as the true stars to be proud of. Now getting back to Superlitio, it is nice to see them back; their obscure ska underlined by some colorful synths is their big asset, and expect more of it in Calidosound, which was kindly sponsored by a beer brand and so it was released as a free download. Its biggest strength, the warmth and fluency of their grooves taken to the emergency room by very Ozomatli-like robotic beings that pop up from nowhere. Its biggest weakness, lyrically and vocally the songs sound like those popular wanna-be funny hits by Juanes.\n\n“Perro Come Perro” is a great tropical song, it was written for the film by the same name; let me tell you that movie is not fun, but it’s so raw and completely bonded to this piece of music that is skillfully ornamented by the vigor of its trumpets as if it was a pure salsa, plus the crude story recaps a state of mind in a country known for its violence. Also operating from this theme is the opening track “El Cartucho”, where they want to tell everyone to get those ammunitions out of the eye, to keep them rolling until they’re inexistent, only then they’ll be able to smile and get the good times rolling. “Favorite Song” sums up the album as a common place, it aims for freedom but it doesn’t quite get there, but it does release a couple of tracks that merit a dance floor and the attention of those looking for optimism.\n\nUntil this morning we had no plan to cover this year’s Vive Latino (today and tomorrow) but Juan Manuel Torreblanca will be there! For those of us not attending, Telehit always has live stream, if like me you don’t have that channel, wait a few hours and video rips will start to show up on YouTube. Reactor also has great coverage through their live radio stream, go have fun! Most promising acts today: Enjambre, Niña Dioz, Gepe, Los Bunkers, Kinky, Simplifires, Zoe, Andres Calamaro, Hello Seahorse!, Ximena Sariñana, Disco Ruido! And Instituto Mexicano del Sonido.\n\nUPDATE:\n\n<\n\nLive Video Stream Via Justin.TV >UnionRockerTV>Telehit @ Escenario Verde\n\nReactor's Live Stream\n\nIt shouldn’t surprise anyone that Pitchfork is our biggest influence; we can really call them the evangelicals of avant-garde music, we may not always agree with their reviews (like in their Aterciopelados review when they argued Colombia didn’t need rock music) but they’re the main filter to discover the truly worthy releases to check out (I would also recommend Slant Magazine and The A.V. Club for album reviews). Unfortunately there’s not much attention towards any of the stuff coming from Iberoamerica, but it’s kind of exciting when one of those does pop up.\n\nThey gave a big boost to El Guincho’s Alegranza! last year when they gave him a BestNewMusic tag, perhaps because they didn’t need to understand his words, for the rest of the latin artists, among them Juana Molina and Café Tacvba, they always confess that they don’t really understand the language, and that’s a letdown because Spanish is Beautiful.\n\nI visit the FrontPage every single night and today there it was, the album cover of Bestia stood up immediately, they’re known to be really strict with their scores and Hello Seahorse! gets a 7.1 rating, which is pretty good for an album “sure to kill a lot of stereotypes” and hopefully bring more attention to our exciting pool of music. Congrats to the trio, the whole world is watching!\n\nCarlos Pesina (Pepepe, Los Amparito, Pesina Siller) sent us an album by Cyane, a girl from Guadalajara with a beautiful voice and who collaborates with Pepepe in Roba Orgon de Plantas y Animales. Not too long ago I had given up with ‘good vocals’ but with emerging artists like La Bien Querida, Carla Morrison and now Cyane, I must say I missed the great taste of engaging vocals surrounded by equally engaging musical accompaniment. He posted the song “Burbuja” over at I See Noises (the reincarnation of Turn That Shit Off, but not really?) and calls it his favorite song, we agree! Reminds us of Maria Rita, she's a fonograma favorite, don't miss out.\n\n♫♫♫ \"Burbuja\"\n\nMySpace\n\nAnother post linked to Ximena Sariñana, we really like her for a bunch of reasons (mainly because Mediocre is a beautiful album and “Normal” is a jewel), but this collaboration with Jason Mraz is a bore, because the guy is not very interesting (good voice though…) She looks cute in the video but nothing else to really care about, it’s not upsetting or anything, but just plainfully ‘meh’ and yes she finally gives us something worthy to call Mediocre. I can’t put it in better words than those of Josh Kun, “Ximena Sarinana has recorded a duet with Jason Mraz. Yikes. For a Spanish version of his latest album. Double Yikes.”\n\nTHE LAST, AVENTURA\n\nSony, USA/Dominican Republic\n\nRating: 43\n\nBy Carlos Reyes\n\nI don’t usually take the time to listen or write about such unconvincing artists like Aventura, but The Last is one of those releases we can’t ignore as they’re firm spots of the music tendencies surrounding the music we like. If you live outside the U.S. there’s a slight possibility that you’re unaware of Aventura, for us Hispanics in the states, they’re the successors of RBD in terms of popularity and fan-rage. But there’s more to Aventura than being the latest boy band storming across their Bachata-meets-R&B. They are giving Bachata a new face, injected some personality into contemporary tropical music and have a legit and quite talented leader with a voice that is perhaps too sweet to shine but effective nonetheless. It’s been 10 years since their highly ambitious but loopy debut Generation Next; since then, they’ve been walking themselves as the representatives of both, the Dominican Republic and The Bronx, New York. Their biggest strength comes with Anthony Romeo Santos; the singer, writer and producer that is fully aware of pop culture and still holds a hand reaching out to the state of mind of the urban Hispanic teenager. But, is it our answer to the “the definitive 21st-century New York musical act?”, Joey Rosen from The New York Times jumps in to answer that question for us, and although it hurts to agree with him, he’s not too far out claiming the ‘common’ radio-hit listener thinks of New York when listening to Aventura. Based on this assumption, it would be predictable to see Aventura as the one Latin act our Hispanic youth is embracing, and that’s just abominably sad.\n\nThe Last continues to bring very poorly constructed melodies; they don’t lack any passion but surely sound so sensationalistic even in Romeo’s overly sweet vocals. The sound did get better but they don’t grow a bit, it’s all very adolescent in composition and still terrified to step out of its zone or make anthem-songs. Bachata might not have enough performers and so media has given approval to a work that is overly flawed, but the most important thing to realize here is that Aventura is pop and they are making pop music, they’re not too far away from Reik in musical formation, they’re just wearing different clothing. “Intro” reminds me of those uncharismatic A.B. Quintanilla Presents Kumbia Kings skits that tried too hard to reaffirm their ego; Aventura manages to use their albums’ titles to make sure everyone knows they are “God’s Project.” Leading track “Por Un Segundo” is the common place Aventura visits in every single; a heartbroken song with diminutive wording with some bouncing covering plot holes. If they wanted a more notable song “Yo Quisiera Amarla” would’ve done the job just by the accurate spacing it gives itself after every sequence. This is the album to make ‘the breakthrough’ and so they have invited Ludacris, Wyclef Jean, Akon and Wisin & Yandel along, every guest falls short adjusting themselves to the swamp of melancholia that invades the quartet. For all these reasons The Last is tremendously tiring, I’m wishing for them to at least go back to “Mi Corazoncito”, their last and perhaps only great song in their catalog."
