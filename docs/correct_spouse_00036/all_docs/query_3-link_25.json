That’s why I’m all about getting to know each other BEFORE the big day.\n\nTo get you started I’ve put together this handy “about me” page which sums me up pretty well, complete with some quick facts, photos and even music.\n\nI’m a lively Argentine living on a boat with my English husband, Stephen. Shyness is not one of my many qualities I’m afraid! Technically, I’m French but you can ask me more about that over coffee.\n\nStephen and I are taking a leap of faith, in search of freedom. In 2021 we bought my dad’s sailboat – the one he built with my mum before I was born – to liveaboard so we can travel and discover new places without leaving our cosy home.\n\nI love dancing, chocolate (who doesn’t? – I did actually have a boyfriend who hated it and our relationship didn’t last) and I’m addicted to speciality coffee.\n\nMy parents built a sailboat and I spent half of my time sailing while growing up so that explains my obsession with the sea.\n\nStephen and I go to a lot of concerts because we love music. If you have any recommendations get in touch, we’re into the melancholic and wistful (a nice way of saying “depressing”) like Nina Simone, Bon Iver, Laura Marling, Andrew Bird… all that stuff.\n\nI have a pretty eclectic taste when it comes to music – and books and movies actually. It ranges from classic rock to reggaeton and includes classical music, folk, easy listening and everything in between.\n\nBut anyway, I digress… When planning our wedding, photography and music were our top priorities so I made a playlist for the entire day myself.\n\nWe ended up with a total of 8 playlists for different parts of the day and I made one with an extra 2 hours for the party, just in case (better safe than sorry!)."
