        "text": "It is common to connect with the lyrics and tunes of certain songs when they describe a situation or state with which we feel identified. They tell us about emotions and sometimes help us evade those situations that cause us pain.\n\nAt ASV Group Funeral Services, a few months ago, we set up a playlist with 10 songs for the grieving process — a selection of songs with messages full of emotion you can find in our Spotify account. And now we've created a new list of songs in Spanish for grief that we want to introduce to you here and which can help us better cope with what we feel in such difficult moments.\n\nSongs for grief\n\nThe songs that make up this playlist with Spanish songs for the grieving process are:\n\nSus ojos se cerraron — Andrés Calamaro\n\nThis song, performed by Andrés Calamaro, reflects the pain felt when losing a loved one, how their memory survives and the lack of comfort that exists at certain times in which the feeling of loneliness predominates.\n\nEl cielo de los perros — Dani Martín.\n\nSinger Dani Martin dedicates this song to his older sister, who died at the age of 34 because of a brain stroke. The composer reflects on the fact that ‘we are only a microscopic point in the universe’, that life does not belong to us and it sometimes gives us things and sometimes takes them away. The title is a nod to his sister, a vet who said that when she died she would go to Dog's Heaven.\n\nEras tú — Merche\n\nA clear example of when a song takes the form of a tribute. Merche, singer and composer of this lyrics, thanks one of the most important figures in her life, a friend of the family whom she considered as a second father. In this songs, she gives value to this person through his acts, which led him to be surrounded by people who loved him until the moment he left.\n\nHistoria de un sueño — La oreja de Van Gogh\n\nThe dream as a meeting point for mother and daughter⁣. A sweet melody accompanies this story that comes to us in a calm and moving way with lyrics full of poetry and remembrance. On this occasion, it is the person who is gone who devotes a last word of encouragement to the one who cries the loss.⁣\n\nProfundo valor — Marta Sánchez\n\nMarta Sánchez is inspired by the memory of her twin sister, Paz, who died of cancer, to create one of her most intimate songs. This song transmits a message full of sadness after loss, but it also expresses the certainty of moving forward and being strong.\n\nAlgo se me fue contigo — Rocío Jurado\n\nWith this song, artist Rocio Jurado pays homage to one of the fundamental pillars in her life: her mother. With deep lyrics, and full of emotion, we discover a song that shows the feeling of having lost a loved one and, with this person, part of our own being.⁣\n\nJamás — Monica Naranjo\n\nThese complicated and tragic lyrics tell the hardest experience a person can live: a child’s death. Monica Naranjo reflects in this song how joy is erased from the life of a mother who has to say goodbye to her teenage son, who is taken by a serious illness.⁣\n\nTe digo adiós — Laura Pausini\n\nIt is said that friends are the family we choose. This song is a tribute to friendship beyond death through simple lyrics that show how a send-off is not complete a farewell. When the pain of loss is intense, we can rely on the memory of all the shared moments and thus feel the strength necessary to move forward.\n\nAmor eterno — Rocío Durcal\n\n‘Eternal and unforgettable love’ is a love-filled claim that completes a piece written with deep feelings. Rocio Durcal sang to her mother after her death and made her one of the most popular tributes in the history of music sung in Spanish.\n\nManías — Thalia\n\nWhen loved ones leave, their oddities and customs stay alive inside those people who shared their lives. This song speaks of a person's absence and memory, details, gestures and those things that make that person's essence difficult to forget.\n\nTodavía puedo oírte — Andrés Suárez\n\nThis song is a clear example of how songs are synonymous with real stories where experiences are described while expressing feelings. In these lyrics, Andrés Suárez shares the difficult story of how he lost his best childhood friend at a very early age.\n\nShare your music with us\n\nEach of these songs has an intention and that is why, at Grupo ASV Funeral Services, we wanted to present this selection of songs in Spanish for grief. Some of them have been recommended by the bereavement support community on social networks such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIf you also want to help grow these lists, do not hesitate to comment about your recommendations on social media and tell us what they meant for you. Discover the comforting power of sharing your experiences and emotions with people who are also walking along the path of grief."
