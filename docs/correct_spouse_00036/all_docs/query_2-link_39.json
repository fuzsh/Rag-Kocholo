        "text": "The singer and composer Andres Calamaro became a trend again this weekend after expressing his position regarding the presidential runoff that will define the next president on November 19. With criticism against the ruling party, which represents Sergio Massa (Unión por la Patria), El Salmón polemicized with progressivism, supported the change that promotes Javier Miley (Freedom Advances) and defined: “They are a meme, I am a man. No more, no less”.\n\nThere are eight days left until the country knows who will be the next ruler, who will begin his duties on December 10, and in the middle of the campaign, different supports are beginning to be seen for the candidates. In this case it was Calamaro’s turn, who argued his position and generated a stir on social networks.\n\n“Many colleagues choose not to give their opinion and they do well, asking for a vote for a candidate or tendency is not serious or wrong either, but a reverse vote or ‘fear’ vote is strange. I have no interests at stake, but I am a resident in Argentina and pay taxes. The SIDE and the AFIP (sic) operate together in a kind of extortion mafia; This is on the front pages of the newspapers right now. Of course it’s better for me not to say anything. I can be cynical and demagogue and stir up fear of the return of dictatorship or the loss of rights, but I would be cynical and a liar”the singer began.\n\nHe also made reference to one of the issues that the public agenda is discussing in the middle of the election year: human rights and the civil-military dictatorship that was established in the country between 1976 and 1983. “It is impossible for a dictatorship to return for several reasons, The United States and the ruling parties were partners of the dictatorships and it depends on them,” he expressed. Part of the discussion for the de facto government was established by Victoria Villarruel, the candidate for libertarian vice president, who defends the victims of terrorist groups such as Montoneros and is also accused of vindicating the government of Jorge Videla.\n\n“Earning the applause of progressive Instagram makes me ashamed of how easy it is, too simple and stupid. I work a lot and for a long time. I never asked for anything nor did they give me anything. I pay my taxes and I am sensitive to the operettas you buy. The drunken teetotaler. Drugs… All that pack of lies that you enjoy because you are masks and informers. I’m not armored, nor would I bet against me. I am tolerant and cultured, you are lazy, resentful, mistaken and hypocritical. They believe in the internet and television. They are a meme, I am a man. No more, no less,” Calamaro pointed out.\n\nThe messages that Calamaro deleted\n\nWithin his posts in favor of Milei, Calamaro decided to unpublish one of them, with forceful definitions. “We can choose between something other than more shots in the feet until there is nothing left. I don’t have all the hairs of the donkey, but I am intelligent and experienced, it is almost impossible for me to be wrong with these questions because I was exquisitely educated among social gatherings and intellectuals, people from all over the political spectrum in the 60s and 70s, in tolerance and without television,” said one of them.\n\n“Change for change’s sake is an option that makes sense in our country… As reality is far from perfect (it’s quite the opposite) it is then when a change makes sense and results in a desired option. The opponents of change are not opposition, although they do not look favorably on the ‘no change’ candidate, they only assume or imply that it is a lesser evil, stirring up the fear of ‘losing rights’ or privilege,” said El Salmón, who then deleted his words.\n\nIn another post, Calamaro spoke about Hebe de Bonafini, Charly García and Cristina Kirchner\n\nIn another post, which this time he did not publish as a temporary story, the author of “Flaca” spoke about Peronism and different relationships with leaders in the space.\n\n“I am a good friend of Peronists from various fronts and of people from the rationalist left who are not exactly Peronists. Hebe de Bonafini was a great friend of mine. She was very critical of contemporary Peronism. I have to say that she sympathized with Axel [Kicillof] y He had a friendship with Cristina Fernández de Kirchnerbut it was an ungovernable team that, like so many others, would be opting for Sergio Massa out of rejection rather than sympathy,” he wrote.\n\nActresses, academics, journalists and writers asked not to vote for Javier Milei in a statement\n\nAnd then he gave temporal context to his arguments and criticisms: “Then the issue of the dictatorship is what it is, each de facto government came to power with the complicity of politics, radicals and Peronists, in addition to technocrats of what we now call liberalism. I don’t know if it is real liberalism or a way of calling things without knowing what they are. In ’55 it is a conspiracy against Juan Domingo Perón, rather than against the socialist or communist left. In the 60s there were civil-military plots, which displaced Arturo Frondizi. In the 70s, an agreement was made with Puerta de Hierro with tragic results. In 1975 it is a paper signed by the interim Justicialista Italo Argentino Luder and in 76 the arsonists called the firefighters. The 90s are what they are, a non-prosaic liberalism. Human rights were violated in confinement as in every act of corruption, strange poverty or impudence of the civil service. Mafia methods do constitute a violation of human rights.”\n\nFinally, he stated: “Be careful with me… I was always a good friend of some of my colleagues and a good companion with those who know each other less. Neither [Charly] García nor Luis Alberto [Spinetta] They voted for progressivism. Since they were very far to the left, they were sympathizers of [Raúl] Alfonsin. That is to say: not Peronists. That’s a mild way of putting it. Neither conservative nor reactionary, but not one centimeter to the left of these thoughts of mine today. Not a millimeter. Plus we love each other… Forever”.\n\nGi"
