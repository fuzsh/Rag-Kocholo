        "text": "UPDATED: There has been another round of content removal from Disney+, this time in the EMEA region, which consists of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. More than 120 titles have been taken off this week, primarily Disney Channel original movies and vintage Disney live-action films, as well as a few series, including Zeke and Luther, Pepper Ann, So Random and the first three seasons of Nat Geo’s Genius and ESPN/Nat Geo docs.\n\nAccording to sources, the takedowns were a result of a library title review. There have been several content purges at Disney+ over the last year amid cost-cutting, most notably the removal of a slew of original series last May.\n\nHere is a list of movie titles that are said to be gone from Disney+ in EMEA, compiled by Drew Ryan."
