        "text": "Downtown is the financial center of the city of Buenos Aires, the main artery of the area is the pedestrian street Florida.\n\nNext is the Plaza de Mayo, surrounded by historical buildings in the area of Montserrat, which includes the historic center of the capital of Argentina.\n\nPINK HOUSE\n\nLa Casa Rosada, the Presidential Palace, seat of the Executive, where the offices of the president of the republic.\n\nFrom the First Meeting in 1810 on these grounds is the seat of national government, but the current building was completed in 1884. Sarmiento was the president who decided to paint it pink.\n\nThe main facade, with the balcony where the politicians were going to the people is the opposite of Plaza de Mayo.\n\nThe entrance is on the street presidential Rivadavia, and Hipólito Yrigoyen is the entrance to the museum, where objects of the presidents.\n\nMuseum: Mon-Fri 8.00-19.00 and 14.00-18.00 Sun Circuits 15.00 and 16.30 Sun Free admission.\n\nSubway: Plaza de Mayo (A).\n\nCOLUMBUS PARK\n\nThis park is located off the facade of the Casa Rosada, the opposite of Plaza de Mayo, and in the center stands a monument to Christopher Columbus, made by Italian Arnaldo Zocchi.\n\nSubway: Plaza de Mayo (A)\n\ndevelopment of their children / grandchildren during the military dictatorship.\n\nIn the center is a small obelisk, the Pyramid of May, marking the first anniversary of independence.\n\nSubway: Plaza de Mayo (A), Cathedral (D), Bolívar (E).\n\nPOST OFFICE\n\nThe Palace of Post and Telecommunications, known as \"post office\" is a magnificent piece of architecture that occupies the entire block, so it was named a National Historic Landmark in 1997.\n\nIts construction took 20 years and is inspired by the New York office.\n\nIn 2003, ceased to function as a central mail office to convert it into a cultural center. Today it houses a small museum of post and telegraph.\n\nSarmiento 151.\n\nMon-Fri 8.00-20.00 and Sat 9.00-13.00.\n\nSubway: Leandro N. Alem (B).\n\nPLAZA DE MAYO\n\nLocated between the streets Rivadavia, Balcarce, H. Yrigoyen and Balcarce, this place was and is the scene of major political events in Argentina, the May Revolution in 1810, the oath to the declaration of independence in 1816, the National Constitution in 1860, the meeting of mothers Plaza de Mayo from 1977. Today, every Thursday at 15:30 the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo still gather to demand\n\nMETROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL\n\nThe baroque church was consecrated as a cathedral in 1836. It has five ships, and major side chapels, one of them is the mausoleum of José de San Martín.\n\nThe main facade is the year 1822, neoclassical style, which makes it look a civilian building a house of worship, exhibits twelve Corinthian columns and pediment represents the arrival of Jacob into Egypt.\n\nThe interior houses works of art as the main altar, Isidro de Lorea, the choir stalls, the Santo Cristo de Buenos Aires century XVII or images of the Virgen de los Dolores.\n\nRivadavia and San Mateen.\n\nMon-Fri 8.00-19.00 and 9.00-19.30 Sa and Sun.\n\nSubway: Cathedral (D).\n\nSeven-thirty in the afternoon. On the other side of the line hears the sound of a TV that rattles the serious events in the Constitution. Diego Maradona attends and knows the reason for the call. \"Yes, and Vero (for Veronica Ojeda, his partner) told me everything. I know what he (Grondona), but I will not respond further. I will go straight to the lawyers: I'll sue for all he said. I already contacted and are investigating the case. This is not cause for more. (Grondona) is beside himself. \"\n\nHe stresses that can cause more damage. Julio Grondona, interviewed by Fox Sports, spoke of \"what everybody knows\" in reference to problems affecting the life of Maradona.\n\n\"Grondona did not know\" what everybody knows \"when they hired? Maradona responds: \"That is why I'm going to do me all the analysis as appropriate.\n\n6 years ago I do not take a glass of wine.\n\nThis goes directly to my lawyers. I do not speak anymore, my lawyers will speak now. People say \"happy holidays\" and that in football we all know. \"\n\nHalf an hour later, Maradona again from the other side of the phone: \"I just talked to my lawyers and (Grondona) got into an ugly. He got the worst ... Because if you talk about my illness, I would remind you that it is within the technical staff at Cheche (Batista) and Rodríguez (Alberto, brother and field assistant coach of the national team) who went through what I went through. And Altafini told me when he came to Italy to play for Milan against Estudiantes, Bilardo was drugged up to the eggs.\n\nAt that time there were no doping controls in the Libertadores and the Intercontinental. Three on the coaching staff that had the same problem that I had. \"\n\nThe war was already installed.\n\nDiego again branding the president of the AFA and The Standard in an interview with Clarin published on Monday. And pulled gruresa ammunition \"Grondona is gaga.\n\nIf you are the Prairie (for the Swiss clinic) three times a year for something will be. I have the illusion of returning to the selection. But when will these (Grondona and Bilardo). They have little ...\".\n\nBilardo, whom Maradona branded a traitor and a wimp - came out to answer in his radio program. And Grondona did not last much longer. \"No wonder,\" what Maradona said, \"because such fluctuations are normal is.\n\nOne day you love, another hates you ...\n\nThere are reasons why that happens all we know, \"said FIFA vice-president again alluding to the old Diego personal problems. \"It's ugly to say that pity. But feel sorry for what he says. More because he knows that 80 percent do not.\n\nI see this guy talks a lot of codes but he has the least, \"he added.\n\nGrondona noted that \"I spoke at his home (Ezeiza) with President of Tristan Smith (Gaston Granados) as a witness.
