        "text": "Joaquín Sabina's song 'Juana La Loca' delves into the life of an individual who has lived a double life, concealing their true identity and desires from society. The lyrics paint a picture of someone who has spent their entire life adhering to societal norms and expectations, maintaining a facade of respectability while suppressing their authentic self. The song's protagonist has been a model worker, spouse, and parent, but has always felt different and has had to hide their true inclinations.\n\nThe turning point in the song comes when the protagonist decides to stop worrying about what others might think ('Pasaste de pensar que pensarían') and embraces their true identity. The reference to 'Juana la Loca' (Joanna the Mad), a historical figure known for her intense emotions and unconventional behavior, serves as a metaphor for the protagonist's liberation from societal constraints. The transformation is symbolized by the act of wearing makeup and adopting a new name, which signifies a break from their previous life as 'Don Juan' to a more authentic existence as 'Juana la Loca.'\n\nSabina's storytelling is rich with cultural references and human emotions, exploring themes of identity, societal pressure, and the courage to embrace one's true self. The song resonates with anyone who has felt the need to hide who they are for fear of judgment, and it celebrates the liberation that comes with self-acceptance and the rejection of societal norms."
