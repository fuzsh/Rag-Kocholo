        "text": "We’re just about a week into the training camp/preseason and things don’t look drastically different for the Rangers than what we all thought going in. The top-end guys are all upright and seemingly ready. The goaltending looks prepared. The battle is really for the last couple of regular lineup spots and, through a few scrimmages and two preseason games, some Ranger hopefuls are starting to emerge.\n\nLet’s take a snapshot of where things stand on this off day, before two more preseason games and some obvious roster cutdowns:\n\nOn the rise\n\nJimmy Vesey: He was a good soldier during his initial three-year run in New York and showed he could score (16, 17 and 17 goals), but perhaps he was a bit miscast then or trying to be someone he wasn’t at the NHL level. After a bit of wandering through four teams the last three seasons, the 29-year-old seems to have sharpened his skill set to what he can do well: Play strong positional hockey, work for pucks, kill penalties and contribute some on offense.\n\nHe scored a neat, no-angle power-play goal against the Islanders on Monday but, as he pointed out, “I don’t know if that’s going to keep up.” Vesey is an NHL player and a versatile one, something that was in short supply in the bottom six for the Rangers last season. It certainly feels like Vesey’s tryout is going to turn into a contract, but there’s still time to go in this preseason.\n\nGustav Rydahl: The 28-year-old center was the biggest unknown among just about anyone that came to camp, having spent the last decade in the Swedish Hockey League. But he’s been a nice little find and doesn’t seem thrown by the smaller North American ice so far. He plays a bottom-six style game, hasn’t been caught out of position much, and is built solidly enough to compete with NHLers. He’s unlikely to beat out Ryan Carpenter for the No. 4 center spot, but through the first week Rydahl has shown the drop-off to the No. 5 center isn’t very far at all. That’s what you need.\n\nBrennan Othmann: There doesn’t seem to be much of a path to a season-long roster spot for the 19-year-old wing but it’d be fun to see him stick around. He had an eventful first period at the Garden on Monday, taking a knock from Alexander Romanov that caused a bloody nose, giving a knock right back to Robin Salo later, and dishing out two assists, including a nice feed to K’Andre Miller for a shorthanded goal in the closing seconds.\n\nOthmann is a true rink rat, a kid who loves to talk hockey, gives compliments to teammates, and generally exudes an air of youthful exuberance at all times. There’s not much left for him to do in the OHL even if that’s where he’s almost certainly headed at some point — hopefully for him, Othmann can stick around, get in a game or two and then head back.\n\nIgor Shesterkin/Jaroslav Halak: The No. 1 and No. 2 goalies look good? You don’t say! They combined to give up one goal in their half-games Monday and Tuesday, which is just where you want to see the very clear NHL tandem out of the gate. There’s a lot riding on these two, with the pressure on Shesterkin to put up a sequel to one of the best goaltending seasons in NHL history and on Halak to show at 37 he’s capable of carrying a decent-sized workload. Good start for both. All hail Benoit Allaire.\n\nK’Andre Miller: Another no-surprise entrant here, but the confidence he gained during last season seems to be brimming now. Using his stride and skating ability to the fullest, strong in his own end — 2022-23 may be Miller Time.\n\nLeveling off\n\nZac Jones: He did have a goal on Monday and when he’s in the offensive zone, Jones is dangerous. His best asset is his ability to weave around the offensive zone and he’s got the skating skills to pull that off on the regular. But the struggle in his own end, especially when he’s required to use his body to clear the net front, is still apparent and there may be nothing more to do shy of round-the-clock protein shakes. When you can’t clear Cole Bardreau out from in front of your goalie in a preseason game, can you clear Anders Lee? Bryan Rust? Andrei Svechnikov? It’s a question the coaching staff and front office are asking as cuts start coming around the league.\n\nLibor Hajek: The other contender for the third-pair left defense spot went through last week’s scrimmages alongside Braden Schneider, then moved to pair with Andy Welinski, who’s ticketed for Hartford. Maybe a sign, maybe not, but Hajek’s game is a complementary one for the most part, so it’s hard to see how he will shine playing with non-NHL roster defensemen. As much as Gerard Gallant and Chris Drury say they like Hajek, the dozens of healthy scratches last season say otherwise.\n\nVitali Kravtsov: He played both games Monday and Tuesday and showed flashes of skill, but also some flashes of inexperience, getting caught in bad spots a few times along the wall on Monday that resulted in turnovers. He’s a raw talent for sure — can Drury and Gallant live with the mistakes that are inevitable when the season starts? Kravtsov has more talent than most other wings on the roster, so maybe that’s worth the growing pains.\n\nFalling\n\nJulien Gauthier: He’s actually had a decent week so far, though he committed a few violations of Gallant’s “no big hits” mandate during the scrimmages. He looked fine in Tuesday’s game in Boston. But fine isn’t going to cut it for a player who couldn’t stick last season when given ample opportunity, and certainly now when Vesey and Gallant favorite Dryden Hunt are ahead of him.\n\nRyan Reaves: Gallant insisted that Reaves is still “a big part of our team,” and that’s clearly true on a team level — Reaves is a force inside a room that doesn’t have a ton of outsized personalities. On the ice, though, there seem to be better fits for a potential fourth line. If everyone’s healthy, would you rather have Vesey-Barclay Goodrow-Carpenter or a line with Reaves on it? He’s been good this week and shown that at 35 he’s still fit enough to keep up. But if he’s your choice over some younger players who skate better and have a bit more all-around games, that might raise some eyebrows.\n\nBarclay Goodrow: His spot isn’t in question, of course. And if Goodrow gets into one of the games Thursday or Friday and comes away feeling fine, then there’s no worry. But for now, there has to be some concern that a broken bone from nearly five months ago is still limiting Goodrow as players need to ramp up their on-ice work for the season.\n\nSammy Blais: Same as with Goodrow, though Blais’ recovery from a torn ACL was expected to be slow. Blais may get one of these next two games, look fine and then he’s in the mix for a spot on opening night. But if there’s some rust — and there definitely was in the scrimmages — then Blais may get crowded out as the season draws near. This is a good problem for the Rangers to have, but they seemingly want Blais to fill a key, top-nine role.\n\n(Photo: Jessica Alcheh / USA TODAY Sports)"
