        "text": "Conducting a multicentre and multinational qualitative study on patient transitions.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Julie K; Barach, Paul; Vernooij-Dassen, Myrra\n\n2012-12-01\n\nA multicentre, multinational research study requires careful planning and coordination to accomplish the aims of the study and to ensure systematic and rigorous examination of all project methods and data collected. The aim of this paper is to describe the approach we used during the HANDOVER Project to develop a multicentre, multinational research project for studying transitions of patient care while creating a community of practice for the researchers. We highlight the process used to assure the quality of a multicentre qualitative study and to create a codebook for data analysis as examples of attending to the community of practice while conducting rigorous qualitative research. Essential elements for the success of this multinational, multilanguage research project included recruiting a strong research team, explicit planning for decision-making processes to be used throughout the project, acknowledging the differences among the study settings and planning the protocols to capitalise upon those differences. Although not commonly discussed in reports of large research projects, there is an underlying, concurrent stream of activities to develop a cohesive team that trusts and respects one another's skills and that engage independent researchers in a group process that contributes to achieving study goals. We discuss other lessons learned and offer recommendations for other teams planning multicentre research.\n\nEconomic Evaluation alongside Multinational Studies: A Systematic Review of Empirical Studies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOppong, Raymond; Jowett, Sue; Roberts, Tracy E.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose of the study This study seeks to explore methods for conducting economic evaluations alongside multinational trials by conducting a systematic review of the methods used in practice and the challenges that are typically faced by the researchers who conducted the economic evaluations. Methods A review was conducted for the period 2002 to 2012, with potentially relevant articles identified by searching the Medline, Embase and NHS EED databases. Studies were included if they were full economic evaluations conducted alongside a multinational trial. Results A total of 44 studies out of a possible 2667 met the inclusion criteria. Methods used for the analyses varied between studies, indicating a lack of consensus on how economic evaluation alongside multinational studies should be carried out. The most common challenge appeared to be related to addressing differences between countries, which potentially hinders the generalisability and transferability of results. Other challenges reported included inadequate sample sizes and choosing cost-effectiveness thresholds. Conclusions It is recommended that additional guidelines be developed to aid researchers in this area and that these be based on an understanding of the challenges associated with multinational trials and the strengths and limitations of alternative approaches. Guidelines should focus on ensuring that results will aid decision makers in their individual countries.

Hypertension-related costs are classified according to four major cardiovascular events: (i) acute myocardial infarction; (ii) congestive heart failure; (iii) stroke; and (iv) renal failure, which was subdivided into renal failure treated by dialysis and renal failure treated by kidney transplantation. To make cross-country costs comparisons, we used the DRG codes used in the US and DRG-like codes from each country. US cost information was obtained from hypertension data available from the literature and health economics researchers. For costs in other countries, we consulted with national health economics experts in each country, used analyses by the Research Triangle Institute, and performed Medline and international literature searches. When available, we obtained information from the countries' public and private nationally representative data sources. For cross-country currency adjustments, all currencies were converted using the Purchasing Power Parities from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and then converted into inflation-adjusted year 2000 US dollars. There exists considerable variation in hypertension-related costs from multinational clinical studies. This study documents that costs are generally higher in the US than in other countries; however, this is not always true. In particular, costs of treating heart failure in France and the costs of renal failure without transplantation in Germany and the UK are relatively high. While analysing multinational hypertensive cost data, this study also addresses the impact of cross-country cost variations on cost analyses. During the last decade, drug-development researchers have drawn extensively upon multinational trials to resolve enrollment problems and\n\nStilwell’s North Burma campaign: a case study in multinational mission command\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-05-25\n\nhistory of providing multinational leadership , publications from the Army Press and Combat Studies Institute have not explored the use of the mission...the campaign.

Yet, spatial priorities for marine conservation are still often based solely on biodiversity hotspots, species richness, and/or cumulative threat maps. This study aims to provide an approach for including cost when planning large-scale Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks that span multiple countries. Here, we explore the incorporation of cost in the complex setting of the Mediterranean Sea. In order to include cost in conservation prioritization, we developed surrogates that account for revenue from multiple marine sectors: commercial fishing, noncommercial fishing, and aquaculture. Such revenue can translate into an opportunity cost for the implementation of an MPA network. Using the software Marxan, we set conservation targets to protect 10% of the distribution of 77 threatened marine species in the Mediterranean Sea. We compared nine scenarios of opportunity cost by calculating the area and cost required to meet our targets. We further compared our spatial priorities with those that are considered consensus areas by several proposed prioritization schemes in the Mediterranean Sea, none of which explicitly considers cost. We found that for less than 10% of the Sea's area, our conservation targets can be achieved while incurring opportunity costs of less than 1%. In marine systems, we reveal that area is a poor cost surrogate and that the most effective surrogates are those that account for multiple sectors or stakeholders. Furthermore, our results indicate that including cost can greatly influence the selection of spatial priorities for marine conservation of threatened species. Although there are known limitations in multinational large-scale planning, attempting to devise more systematic and rigorous planning methods is especially critical given that collaborative conservation action is on the rise and global financial crisis\n\nOn the topological structure of multinationals network\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJoyez, Charlie\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis paper uses a weighted network analysis to examine the structure of multinationals' implantation countries network. Based on French firm-level dataset of multinational enterprises (MNEs) the network analysis provides information on each country position in the network and in internationalization strategies of French MNEs through connectivity preferences among the nodes. The paper also details network-wide features and their recent evolution toward a more decentralized structure. While much has been said on international trade network, this paper shows that multinational firms' studies would also benefit from network analysis, notably by investigating the sensitivity of the network construction to firm heterogeneity.\n\nMultinationals, state-owned corporations, and the transformation of imperialism: a Brazilian case study\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEvans, P.\n\n1977-10-01\n\nThe Brazilian petrochemical industry is used as a case study in cooperation of state-owned and multinational corporations in bringing capitalism into the Third World. The petrochemical industry was chosen because it entails enormous transfers of capital investment and technology and the development of internal industrialization. Active participation by the host state, while it modifies the capitalization process, also is seen to provide a mutually beneficial partnership. A chronological account is given of the process by which Brazil evolved a system for encouraging multinationals to bring basic industries while participating directly in production. Multinationals have found that state-owned corporations do notmoreÂ Â» destroy capitalism, while the state-owned corporations have adapted to a profit orientation. A new ruling class has emerged in the process to provide technical and managerial skills. A disappointing social record developed at the same time and indicates the capitalization process was not able to provide the expected social benefits.

In a cross-sectional study of 110,428 interventional trials registered in Clinicaltrials.gov, we characterized the evolution, trial demographics, and network properties of multinational clinical research. We reveal that the relative growth of international collaboratives has remained stagnant in the last two decades, although clinical trials have evolved to become much larger in scale. Multinational clinical trials are also characterized by higher patient enrollments, industry funding, and specific clinical disciplines including oncology and infectious disease. Network analyses demonstrate temporal shifts in collaboration patterns between countries and world regions, with developing nations now collaborating more within themselves, although Europe remains the dominant contributor to multinational clinical trials worldwide. Performances in network centrality measures also highlight the differential contribution of nations in the global research network. A city-level clinical trial network analysis further demonstrates how collaborative ties decline with physical distance. This study clarifies evolving themes and highlights potential growth mechanisms and barriers in multinational clinical trials, which may be useful in evaluating the role of national and local policies in organizing transborder efforts in clinical endeavors.

We surveyed investigators from North America, Europe, and Australia about existing JIA cohort studies and registries. We excluded cross-sectional studies. We captured information about study design, duration, location, inclusion criteria, data elements and collection methods. We received survey results from 18 studies, including 11 national and 7 multi-national studies representing 37 countries in total. Study designs included inception cohorts, prevalent disease cohorts, and new treatment cohorts (several of which contribute to pharmacosurveillance activities). Despite numerous differences, the data elements collected across the studies was quite similar, with most studies collecting at least 5 of the 6 American College of Rheumatology core set variables and the data needed to calculate the 3-variable clinical juvenile disease activity score. Most studies were collecting medication initiation and discontinuation dates and were attempting to capture serious adverse events. There is a wide-range of large, ongoing JIA registries and cohort studies around the world. Our survey results indicate significant potential for future collaborative work using data from different studies and both combined and comparative analyses.\n\nMultinational Activities of Major U.S. Automotive Producers : Volume 1.

Patients hospitalized with definite or possible infective endocarditis by the International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study in 64 hospitals from 28 countries were included and characteristics of HE patients compared with IE due to other pathogens. Of 5591 patients enrolled, 77 (1.4%) had HE. HE was associated with a younger age (47 vs. 61 years; p<0.001), a higher prevalence of immunologic/vascular manifestations (32% vs. 20%; p<0.008) and stroke (25% vs. 17% pâ=â0.05) but a lower prevalence of congestive heart failure (15% vs. 30%; pâ=â0.004), death in-hospital (4% vs. 18%; pâ=â0.001) or after 1 year follow-up (6% vs. 20%; pâ=â0.01) than IE due to other pathogens (nâ=â5514). On multivariable analysis, stroke was associated with mitral valve vegetations (OR 3.60; CI 1.34â9.65; p<0.01) and younger age (OR 0.62; CI 0.49â0.90; p<0.01). The overall outcome of HE was excellent with the in-hospital mortality (4%) significantly better than for non-HE (18%; p<0.001). Prosthetic valve endocarditis was more common in HE (35%) than non-HE (24%). The outcome of prosthetic valve and native valve HE was excellent whether treated medically or with surgery. Current treatment is very successful for the management of both native valve prosthetic valve HE but further studies are needed to determine why HE has a predilection for younger people and to cause stroke. The small number of patients and observational design limit inferences on treatment strategies. Self selection of study sites limits epidemiological inferences.

As more and more organizations realize the significance of becoming customer-centric in today's competitive era, they embrace CRM as a core business strategy. CRM an integration of information technology and relationship marketing provides the infrastructure that facilitates long-term relationship building with customers at an enterprise-wide level. Successful CRM implementation is a complex, expensive and rarely technical projects. This paper presents the successful implementation of CRM in a multinational organization. This study will facilitate in understanding transition, constraints and implementation of CRM in multinational enterprises.\n\nLeadership styles of nurse managers in a multinational environment.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuliman, Wafika A\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis is a descriptive study conducted at a multinational working environment, where 1500 nurses representing 52 nationalities are employed. The study aimed at exploring the predominant leadership style of nurse managers through self-evaluation and staff nurses' evaluation and the impact of working in a multinational environment on their intention to stay or quit. The value lies in its focus on leadership styles in an environment where national diversity among managers, staff, and patients is very challenging. The study included 31 nurse managers and 118 staff nurses using Bass and Avolio's (1995) Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. The results showed that nurse managers and staff nurses reported transformational leadership as predominant with significant difference in favor of nurse managers. Participants' nationality and intention to stay or quit affected their perception of transformational leadership as a predominant style. The implications highlight the need for senior nursing management to set effective retention strategies for transformational nurse managers who work at multinational environments.\n\nMultinational corporations and culture in Liberia\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBonaparte, T.H.\n\n1979-07-01\n\nThe proportion of multinational corporations (MCs) in a developing country (DC) has little to do with the degree of corruption of local culture that takes place. Rather, policy decisions taken by governments of DCs determine whether or not multinationals have a positive or negative impact, according to the author's research in Liberia among foreign managers, African supervisors, and Liberian workers. Even though Liberia has an open door policy toward MCs, very little violence has been done to Liberian culture. The reason is two-fold: 1) multinationals have maintained tight enclaves and have generally refused to integrate their values, managerial and otherwise,moreÂ Â» with those of the Liberian society; and 2) Liberian government officials have done little to generate Liberian interest in the business field or to force multinationals to play a more participative role in the society. The result has been growth without development, in the sense that the country's growth rate has increased over the years, but the Liberian people remain very much underdeveloped. A change of policy could bring about continued growth with development and without cultural disintegration.Â«Â less\n\nSharing the Burden: How Effective is a Multinational Force in the Contemporary Operational Environment\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2007-06-01\n\nmultinational setting justifies a reassessment of the benefits and costs of multinational operations and that the solution may lie in a âmodular...Nonetheless, Brown identifies benefits from multinational commitments, relevant to this study: legitimacy, burden sharing and access to the battlefield and...require more robust tools and would benefit if supplemented by alliance and cooperative partnerships.

This evolution necessitated a change in the perspective of the international companies. The survival of the multinational corporations depended on its world profit perspective. Initially, the European countries provided the American multinational with world trade avenues while the European multinationals established subsidiaries in Africa. Recently, both the American and the European subsidiares have become interested in Nigeria because of its prospect as a potential market in Africa. The major objective of the research is to inquire about executive judgements and decision criteriamoreÂ Â» for marketing mix considerations and decisions. Also because of the uniqueness of Nigeria from the Western World in terms of its socio-cultural, legal, economic and political environments,executive decision criteria in the area of manufacturing was also investigated.Â«Â less\n\nConsumption of alcohol during pregnancy-A multinational European study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¥rdby, Ann-Charlotte; Lupattelli, Angela; Hensing, Gunnel; Nordeng, Hedvig\n\n2017-08-01\n\nAlthough single-country studies indicate alcohol consumption among some pregnant European women, it is difficult to interpret European differences. Few multinational studies exist using the same methodology. To estimate the proportion of women consuming alcohol during pregnancy in Europe, and to analyze whether between country variations could be explained by sociodemography and smoking. An anonymous online questionnaire was accessible for pregnant women and new mothers in 11 European countries during two months between October 2011 and February 2012 in each country. The questionnaire covered alcohol consumption, sociodemographic factors, and smoking habits during pregnancy. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were conducted. The study population consisted of 7905 women, 53.1% pregnant and 46.9% new mothers. On average, 15.8% reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The highest proportion of alcohol consumption during pregnancy was found in the UK (28.5%), Russia (26.5%), and Switzerland (20.9%) and the lowest in Norway (4.1%), Sweden (7.2%), and Poland (9.7%). When reporting alcohol consumption during pregnancy, 39% consumed at least one unit per month. In Italy, Switzerland, and the UK, over half consumed at least one alcohol unit per month. Higher education and smoking before pregnancy were predictors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Almost 16% of women resident in Europe consumed alcohol during pregnancy with large cross-country variations. Education and smoking prior to pregnancy could not fully explain the differences between the European countries. A united European strategy to prevent alcohol consumption during pregnancy is needed with focus on countries with the highest consumption. Copyright Â© 2017 Australian College of Midwives.

Analyzing data from Financial Times Global 500 firms, it examines the influence on types and process of multinationals' political strategies, reckoning with institutional contexts and issue saliency. Findings show that the type of political activities can be characterized as an information strategy to influence policy makers toward market-based solutions, not so much withholding action on emission reduction. Moreover, multinationals pursue self-regulation, targeting a broad range of political actors. The process of politicalmoreÂ Â» strategy is mostly one of collective action. International differences particularly surface in the type of political actors aimed at, with U.S. and Australian firms focusing more on non-government actors (voluntary programs) than European and Japanese firms. Influencing home-country (not host-country) governments is the main component of international political strategy on climate change.Â«Â less\n\nHerbal medicine use in pregnancy: results of a multinational study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground The use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) is growing in the general population. Herbal medicines are used in all countries of the world and are included in the top CAM therapies used. Methods A multinational study on how women treat disease and pregnancy-related health ailments was conducted between October 2011 and February 2012 in Europe, North and South America and Australia. In this study, the primary aim was to determine the prevalence of herbal medicine use in pregnancy and factors related to such use across participating countries and regions. The secondary aim was to investigate who recommended the use of herbal medication in pregnancy. Results There were 9,459 women from 23 countries participating in the study. Of these, 28.9% reported the use of herbal medicines in pregnancy. Most herbal medicines were used for pregnancy-related health ailments such as cold and nausea. Ginger, cranberry, valerian and raspberry were the most commonly used herbs in pregnancy. The highest reported rate of herbal use medicines was in Russia (69%). Women from Eastern Europe (51.8%) and Australia (43.8%) were twice as likely to use an herbal medicine versus other regions. Women using herbal medicines were characteristically having their first child, non-smokers, using folic acid and consuming some alcohol in pregnancy. Also, women who were currently students and women with an education other than a high school degree were more likely to use herbal medicines than other women. Although 1 out of 5 women stated that a physician had recommended the herbal use, most women used herbal medicine in pregnancy on their own initiative. Conclusions In this multinational study herbal medicine use in pregnancy was high although there were distinct differences in the herbs and users of herbal medicines across regions. Most commonly the women self-medicated with herbal medicine to treat pregnancy-related health ailments.

This study aimed to examine patterns and factors associated with medications use in pregnancy from a multinational perspective, with emphasis on type of medication utilised and indication for use. Cross-sectional, web-based study performed within the period from 1 October 2011 to 29 February 2012. Uniform collection of drug utilisation data was performed via an anonymous online questionnaire. Multinational study in Europe (Western, Northern and Eastern), North and South America and Australia. Pregnant women and new mothers with children less than 1 year of age. Prevalence of and factors associated with medication use for acute/short-term illnesses, chronic/long-term disorders and over-the-counter (OTC) medication use. The study population included 9459 women, of which 81.2% reported use of at least one medication (prescribed or OTC) during pregnancy. Overall, OTC medication use occurred in 66.9% of the pregnancies, whereas 68.4% and 17% of women reported use of at least one medication for treatment of acute/short-term illnesses and chronic/long-term disorders, respectively. The extent of self-reported medicated illnesses and types of medication used by indication varied across regions, especially in relation to urinary tract infections, depression or OTC nasal sprays. Women with higher age or lower educational level, housewives or women with an unplanned pregnancy were those most often reporting use of medication for chronic/long-term disorders. Immigrant women in Western (adjusted OR (aOR): 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.87) and Northern Europe (aOR: 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.83) were less likely to report use of medication for chronic/long-term disorders during pregnancy than non-immigrants. In this study, the majority of women in Europe, North America, South America and Australia used at least one medication during pregnancy.

This study uses large-sample hydrology to identify major catchment controls on daily runoff simulations. It is based on a conceptual lumped hydrological model (GR6J), a collection of 29 catchment characteristics, a multinational set of 1103 catchments located in Austria, France, and Germany and four runoff model efficiency criteria. Two analyses are conducted to assess how features and criteria are linked: (i) a one-dimensional analysis based on the Kruskal-Wallis test and (ii) a multidimensional analysis based on regression trees and investigating the interplay between features. The catchment features most affecting model performance are the flashiness of precipitation and streamflow (computed as the ratio of absolute day-to-day fluctuations by the total amount in a year), the seasonality of evaporation, the catchment area, and the catchment aridity. Nonflashy, nonseasonal, large, and nonarid catchments show the best performance for all the tested criteria. We argue that this higher performance is due to fewer nonlinear responses (higher correlation between precipitation and streamflow) and lower input and output variability for such catchments. Finally, we show that, compared to national sets, multinational sets increase results transferability because they explore a wider range of hydroclimatic conditions.\n\nCoalition Logistics - The Multinational Force and Observers Model\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1986-05-19\n\nMISSION The mission of the MFO, as specified by the protocol , is to supervise implemeutation of the peace treaty and to employ its best efforts to prevent ...result, a protocol was -- negotiated, calling for a multinational military force and civilian- ---- observer unit to serve in the Sinai--outside the...auspices of the United Nations.2 In this way, the protocol of 3 August 1981 created the Multinational Force and Observers and directed Lhat it be\n\nClinical trial allocation in multinational pharmaceutical companies - a qualitative study on influential factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nDombernowsky, Tilde; Haedersdal, Merete; Lassen, Ulrik; Thomsen, Simon F\n\n2017-06-01\n\nClinical trial allocation in multinational pharmaceutical companies includes country selection and site selection. With emphasis on site selection, the overall aim of this study was to examine which factors pharmaceutical companies value most when allocating clinical trials. The specific aims were (1) to identify key decision makers during country and site selection, respectively, (2) to evaluate by which parameters subsidiaries are primarily assessed by headquarters with regard to conducting clinical trials, and (3) to evaluate which site-related qualities companies value most when selecting trial sites. Eleven semistructured interviews were conducted among employees engaged in trial allocation at 11 pharmaceutical companies. The interviews were analyzed by deductive content analysis, which included coding of data to a categorization matrix containing categories of site-related qualities. The results suggest that headquarters and regional departments are key decision makers during country selection, whereas subsidiaries decide on site selection. Study participants argued that headquarters primarily value timely patient recruitment and quality of data when assessing subsidiaries. The site-related qualities most commonly emphasized during interviews were study population availability, timely patient recruitment, resources at the site, and site personnel's interest and commitment. Costs of running the trials were described as less important. Site personnel experience in conducting trials was described as valuable but not imperative. In conclusion, multinational pharmaceutical companies consider recruitment-related factors as crucial when allocating clinical trials. Quality of data and site personnel's interest and commitment are also essential, whereas costs seem less important. While valued, site personnel experience in conducting clinical trials is not imperative.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis using data from multinational trials: The use of bivariate hierarchical modelling\n\nPubMed Central\n\nManca, Andrea; Lambert, Paul C; Sculpher, Mark; Rice, Nigel\n\n2008-01-01\n\nHealthcare cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) often uses individual patient data (IPD) from multinational randomised controlled trials. Although designed to account for between-patient sampling variability in the clinical and economic data, standard analytical approaches to CEA ignore the presence of between-location variability in the study results. This is a restrictive limitation given that countries often differ in factors that could affect the results of CEAs, such as the availability of healthcare resources, their unit costs, clinical practice, and patient case-mix. We advocate the use of Bayesian bivariate hierarchical modelling to analyse multinational cost-effectiveness data. This analytical framework explicitly recognises that patient-level costs and outcomes are nested within countries. Using real life data, we illustrate how the proposed methods can be applied to obtain (a) more appropriate estimates of overall cost-effectiveness and associated measure of sampling uncertainty compared to standard CEA; and (b) country-specific cost-effectiveness estimates which can be used to assess the between-location variability of the study results, while controlling for differences in country-specific and patient-specific characteristics. It is demonstrated that results from standard CEA using IPD from multinational trials display a large degree of variability across the 17 countries included in the analysis, producing potentially misleading results. In contrast, âshrinkage estimatesâ obtained from the modelling approach proposed here facilitate the appropriate quantification of country-specific cost-effectiveness estimates, while weighting the results based on the level of information available within each country. We suggest that the methods presented here represent a general framework for the analysis of economic data collected from different locations.

A postal questionnaire had been sent, between August 2002 and September 2002, to multinational corporations in Korea. A double standard company was defined as those who answered in more than one item as adopting a different standard among the five items regarding double standard identification. By comparing double standard companies with equivalent standard companies, determinants for double standards were then identified using logistic regression analysis. Of multinational corporations, 45.1% had adopted a double standard. Based on the question naire's scale level, the factor of 'characteristic and size of multinational corporation' was found to have the most potent impact on increasing double standard risk. On the variable level, factors of 'number of affiliated companies' and 'existence of an auditing system with the parent company' showed a strong negative impact on double standard risk. Our study suggests that a distinctive approach is needed to manage the occupational safety and health for multinational corporations. This approach should be focused on the specific level of a corporation, not on a country level.\n\nMedication use in pregnancy: a cross-sectional, multinational web-based study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLupattelli, A; Spigset, O; Twigg, M J; Zagorodnikova, K; MÃ¥rdby, A C; Moretti, M E; Drozd, M; Panchaud, A; HÃ¤meen-Anttila, K; Rieutord, A; Gjergja Juraski, R; Odalovic, M; Kennedy, D; Rudolf, G; Juch, H; Passier, A; BjÃ¶rnsdÃ³ttir, I; Nordeng, H\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjectives Intercountry comparability between studies on medication use in pregnancy is difficult due to dissimilarities in study design and methodology.

We sought to understand how multinational pharmaceutical companies currently engage in CSR activities in the developing world aimed at global health impact, their motivations for doing so and how their CSR strategies are evolving. We conducted a small-scale, exploratory study combining (i) an in-depth review of publicly available data on pharmaceutical firms' CSR with (ii) interviews of representatives from 6 firms, purposively selected, from the highest earning pharmaceutical firms worldwide. Corporate social responsibility differed for each firm particularly with respect to how CSR is defined, organizational structures for managing CSR, current CSR activities, and motivations for CSR. Across the firms studied, the common CSR activities were: differential pharmaceutical pricing, strengthening developing country drug distribution infrastructure, mHealth initiatives, and targeted research and development. Primary factors that motivated CSR engagement were: reputational benefits, recruitment and employee satisfaction, better rankings in sustainability indices, entrance into new markets, long-term economic returns, and improved population health. In terms of CSR strategy, firms were at different points on a spectrum ranging from philanthropic donations to integrated systemic shared value business models. CSR is of increasing importance for multinational pharmaceutical firms yet understanding of the array of CSR strategies employed and their effects is nascent. Our study points to the need to (i) develop clearer and more standardized definitions of CSR in global health (2) strengthen indices to track CSR strategies and their public health effects in developing countries and (iii) undertake more country level studies that investigate how CSR engages with\n\nLearning Experiences of Nurses as Part of a European Union Project on Complementary Therapies: A Multinational Qualitative Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoz, Ä°lkay; Ãzer, Zeynep; Teskereci, Gamze; Kavradim, Selma Turan\n\nThe objectives of this study were to investigate learning experiences of the nurses who participated in transnational and multinational occupational training.

Since the international nature of the activities of multinational companies brings them within the scope of the domestic tax provisions of different countries, the authors outline the principles behind the domestic tax treatment of companies, and then assess the economic impact of this treatment. They subsequently examine the international taxation of multinationals, paying special attention to the OECD modelmoreÂ Â» treaty which seeks to remove the problem of international double taxation; reactions of governments to each other's fiscal policies are also examined, with special attention being paid to tax havens. Finally, they look at the EEC proposals for the harmonization of corporate tax systems within the Community and postulate how these proposals would operate if put into effect. There are numerous examples throughout the book of international taxation at work, and these together with the clear text provide a readily comprehensible account of a subject that can seem highly complicated to the uninitiated.Â«Â less\n\nâA question of balanceâ: addressing the public health impacts of multinational enterprises in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, Joshua S.; McDaniel, Patricia A.; Malone, Ruth E.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground The global community is beginning to address non-communicable diseases, but how to increase the accountability of multinational enterprises (MNEs) for the health impacts of their products and practices remains unclear. We examine the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentâs (OECD) efforts to do so through voluntary MNE guidelines. Methods We developed a historical case study of how the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises were developed and revised from 1973â2000 through an analysis of publicly available archived OECD and tobacco industry documents. Results The first edition of the Guidelines was a purely economic instrument. Outside pressures and a desire to ward off more stringent regulatory efforts resulted in the addition over time of guidelines related to the environment, consumer interests, sustainable development, and human rights. Conclusion Despite their voluntary nature, the Guidelines can play a role in efforts to help balance the interests of MNEs and public health by providing a starting point for efforts to create binding provisions addressing MNEsâ contributions to disease burden or disease reduction.

This development, ostensibly benign and nutritionally advantageous to infants in developing countries, has serious public health consequences, due to the high relative cost of purchased formula and the paucity of hygienic facilities essential to the sterile preparation of bottle formula. This paper delineates in detail economic and contraceptive advantages of breast-feeding, and examines the role of health personnel and multinational advertising techniques which have catalyzed the decline in breast-feeding. In addition, the paper focuses on the question of cultural imperialism and current efforts to regulate the multinational firms through both United Nations groups and stock-holders' suits. Finally, some suggestions are made concerning ameliorative public policy approaches to the breast-feeding controversy.\n\nKnowledge Sharing in an American Multinational Company Based in Malaysia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLing, Chen Wai; Sandhu, Manjit S.; Jain, Kamal Kishore\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPurpose: This paper seeks to examine the views of executives working in an American based multinational company (MNC) about knowledge sharing, barriers to knowledge sharing, and strategies to promote knowledge sharing.

This analysis was performed using typologies proposed in the theoretical framework, which help us to have an overview of the network. The methodology is grounded on one extended case study that involves a local R&D unit (Portugal), a foreign R&D unit (Netherlands) and the headquarters (Norway) - developed on a multinational from the electronics industry. This case is an example of a multinational company where R&D is developed mainly in the headquarters but it is also delocalised to some subsidiaries with a certain level of autonomy.\n\nReducing Proliferation Rick Through Multinational Fuel Cycle Facilities\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAmanda Rynes\n\n2010-11-01\n\nWith the prospect of rapid expansion of the nuclear energy industry and the ongoing concern over weapons proliferation, there is a growing need for a viable alternative to traditional nation-based fuel production facilities. While some in the international community remain apprehensive, the advantages of multinational fuel cycle facilities are becoming increasingly apparent, with states on both sides of the supply chain able to garner the security and financial benefits of such facilities. Proliferation risk is minimized by eliminating the need of states to establish indigenous fuel production capabilities and the concept's structure provides an additional internationally monitored barrier against themoreÂ Â» misuse or diversion of nuclear materials.

However, these models have assumed that the INBs are exchangeable and that there is a common variance across all centres. This paper examines the plausibility of these assumptions by comparing various MLMs for estimating the mean INB in a multinational CEA. The results showed that the MLMs that assumed the INBs were exchangeable and had a common variance led to incorrect inferences. The MLMs that included covariates to allow for systematic differences across the centres, and estimated different variances in each centre, made more plausible assumptions, fitted the data better and led to more appropriate inferences. We conclude that the validity of assumptions underlying MLMs used in CEA need to be critically evaluated before reliable conclusions can be drawn.

We tested the hypothesis that thromboprophylaxis is infrequently used in critically ill children even for those in whom it is indicated. Design Prospective multinational cross-sectional study over four study dates in 2012. Setting Fifty-nine PICUs in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, and the United States. Patients All patients less than 18 years old in the PICU during the study dates and times were included in the study, unless the patients were 1) boarding in the unit waiting for a bed outside the PICU or 2) receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Of 2,484 children in the study, 2,159 (86.9%) had greater than or equal to 1 risk factor for thrombosis. Only 308 children (12.4%) were receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (e.g., aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or unfractionated heparin). Of 430 children indicated to receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis based on consensus recommendations, only 149 (34.7%) were receiving it. Mechanical thromboprophylaxis was used in 156 of 655 children (23.8%) 8 years old or older, the youngest age for that device. Using nonlinear mixed effects model, presence of cyanotic congenital heart disease (odds ratio, 7.35; p < 0.001) and spinal cord injury (odds ratio, 8.85; p = 0.008) strongly predicted the use of pharmacologic and mechanical thromboprophylaxis, respectively. Conclusions Thromboprophylaxis is infrequently used in critically ill children. This is true even for children at high risk of thrombosis where consensus guidelines recommend pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis.

The military medical services are in essence a people organisation; the purpose of the organisation is primarily to support the people engaged in military operations, and also the people providing healthcare to them. Increasingly, supporting the latter also includes preparation for the ethical dilemmas that they will face. Providing health advice and healthcare on operations is now usually undertaken on a multinational basis, in order to generate sufficient medical capacity to meet the requirement with assets of the appropriate (and NATO mandated) capability. This will be an enduring feature, particularly in light of increasing costs of providing high quality healthcare and the operational and logistic challenges of delivering this capability in adverse environments, and in the context of medical personnel being a limited resource. The key to overcoming the challenges, often the result of the \"people issues\" such as cultural differences, is to recognise the value that the inherent diversity of multinational healthcare provision brings. The benefit is realised through sharing best practice, and the lessons from challenges met, as well as through burden sharing, and to understand that challenges are most commonly the result of misunderstandings, such as those inherent in language differences. The advice for those bringing a multinational team together includes considering the implications of culture (noting differences in national and military perspectives, and in medical processes such as clinical governance), to ensure effective communication, and to utilise feedback to confirm understanding. It is important not to prejudge or denigrate others. Share information and knowledge, provide positive reinforcement when things go well, and recognise that there will inevitably be challenges and use these as an opportunity to learn.

The increasing trend of MUD transplants across countries has been largely facilitated with the conspicuous growth of volunteer HSC donor noted in the last decade i.e. 8 million HSC donors in 2002 to more than 22 million in 2013 registered in 71 member registries of the Bone Marrow Donor Worldwide (BMDW). Some populations of the world are still very poorly represented in these registries. Since, the chances of successful engraftment and disease free survival are directly proportional to the HLA compatibility between the recipient and the prospective donor, the diversity of the HLA system at the antigenic and allelic level and the heterogeneity of HLA data of the registered donors has a bearing on the probability of finding a volunteer unrelated HSC donor for patients from such populations. In the present study 126 patients were identified suffering from hematological diseases requiring MUD transplant. Their HLA typing was performed and search was done using BMDW database. The search results for these Indian patients in the multinational registry as well as in the Indian Registries were analyzed using mean, range, standard deviation and finally evaluated in terms of probability for finding matched donor (MUD). Total Asian population is only 11Â % in the BMDW making it difficult to find a MUD for an Asian patient. The current study supports this, experimentally; revealing that the probability of finding an allele match for an Indian patient in the multinational Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) registries is 16Â % and a dismal 0.008Â % in the Indian registries (donors in Indian registries is just 33,678 as compared to 22.5 million in BMDW). This greatly, emphasizes on enhancing the number of Indian donors in Indian and multi-national registries.\n\nCurrent Status of Diversity Initiatives in Selected Multinational Corporations.

Cross-cultural comparative research can make a significant contribution in areas such as epidemiology, genetics, psychosocial modulators, symptom reporting and interpretation, extra-intestinal co-morbidity, diagnosis and treatment, determinants of disease severity, health care utilisation, and health-related quality of life, all issues that can be affected by geographical region, culture, ethnicity and race. To identify methodological challenges for cross-cultural, multinational research, and suggest possible solutions. This report, which summarises the full report of a working team established by the Rome Foundation that is available on the Internet, reflects an effort by an international committee of FGID clinicians and researchers. It is based on comprehensive literature reviews and expert opinion. Cross-cultural, multinational research is important and feasible, but has barriers to successful implementation. This report contains recommendations for future research relating to study design, subject recruitment, availability of appropriate study instruments, translation and validation of study instruments, documenting confounders, statistical analyses and reporting of results. Advances in study design and methodology, as well as cross-cultural research competence, have not matched technological advancements. The development of multinational research networks and cross-cultural research collaboration is still in its early stages. This report is intended to be aspirational rather than prescriptive, so we present recommendations, not guidelines. We aim to raise awareness of these issues and to pose higher standards, but not to discourage investigators from doing what is feasible in any particular setting.

As a result of the Guideline revision in Nov., 2005, overseas' Phase III data is now usable as pivotal data for NDA submissions. Therefore, acceleration of \"hollowing out of clinical trails for registration in Japan has been the significant concern. Under such circumstances, the possible solution would be to participate in the Multi-National Clinical Trials.\" While other Asian countries, EU and the US have rich precedents and experiences in conducting Multi-National Clinical Trials, Japan was left alone and other Asian countries do not need any collaboration with Japan. It is proposed that Japan take initiative to set up the network such as \"Asian Clinical Trial Group\" and collaborate with other Asian countries from the beginning of early stage development. Eventually, Asia should become the third region to create clinical evidence, same as to EU and the US.\n\nCurrent Status of Diversity Initiatives in Selected Multinational Corporations.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWentling, Rose Mary; Palma-Rivas, Nilda\n\n2000-01-01\n\nInterviews with eight diversity managers in multinational corporations revealed a variety of domestic and international diversity initiatives, especially in leadership and management.

The company provided a database, removing any identifiers, of investigations by the corporate Threat Management Teams in 2009 and 2010. Rates were calculated using worker population data. During the 2-year study period, the company investigated threat management cases at a rate of 13.9 per 10,000 employees per year. Cases that activated a Threat Management Team were more likely to lead to corrective action (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% confidence interval = 1.08 to 3.87) and referral to the Employee Assistance Program (odds ratio = 4.8; 95% confidence interval = 3.00 to 7.77), but were not related to likelihood of termination.

Since the Government of China launched the health care reform in 2009, the issue of growing pharmaceutical expenditure continues to grasp policy makers' attention. Since 2015, an ongoing series of drug-related policies have been revised or developed, resulting in profound impact on the overall pharmaceutical market in China, and the dynamic is still evolving. As China has become the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world, any volatility in the Chinese pharmaceutical market may have great implications to multinational pharmaceutical markets that have had their products launched in China or plan to extend their business to the Chinese market. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the most recent health care reform policies in China, the objectives of this study were to identify the major opportunities appealed to and the challenges confronted by multinational pharmaceutical enterprises in the current Chinese pharmaceutical market.\n\nDouble standards: the multinational asbestos industry and asbestos-related disease in South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCulloch, Jock; Tweedale, Geoffrey\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThis study documents and contrasts the development of knowledge about asbestos-related disease (ARD) in South Africa and the United Kingdom. It also contributes to the globalization debate by exploring corporate decision-making in a multinational industry. Between the 1930s and 1960s, the leading U.K. asbestos companies developed a sophisticated knowledge of ARD, though in South Africa, where the leading companies such as Turner & Newall and Cape Asbestos owned mines, there was little attempt to apply this knowledge. Asbestos mines (and their environments) in South Africa were uniquely dusty and ARD was rife. Social and political factors in South Africa, especially apartheid, allowed these companies to apply double standards, even after 1960 when the much more serious hazard of mesothelioma was identified. This shows the need for greater regulation of multinationals. Because of the lack of such regulation in the early 1960s, an opportunity was lost to prevent the current high morbidity and mortality of ARD both in South Africa and worldwide.\n\nMultinational corporate penetration, industrialism, region, and social security expenditures: a cross-national analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nClark, R; Filinson, R\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis study examines the determinants of spending on social security programs. We draw predictions from industrialism and dependency theories for the explanation of social security programs. The explanations are tested with data on seventy-five nations, representative of core, semipheripheral and peripheral nations. Industrialization variables such as the percentage of older adults and economic productivity have strong effects in models involving all nations, as does multinational corporate (MNC) penetration in extraction, particularly when region is controlled; such penetration is negatively associated with spending on social security. We then look at industrialism and dependency effects for peripheral and non-core nations alone. The effects of all industrialization variables, except economic productivity, appear insignificant for peripheral nations, while the effects of region and multinational corporate penetration in extractive and agricultural industries appears significant. Models involving all non-core nations (peripheral and semi-peripheral) look more like models for all nations than for peripheral nations alone.\n\nECOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE LARGE-SCALE BIOSPHEREâATMOSPHERE EXPERIMENT IN AMAZONIA: EARLY RESULTS.\n\nTreesearch\n\nM.

The study describes a framework for the collection and analysis of international resource cost data that can contribute to a consistent and accurate intercountry estimation of cost. Of the 15 countries that participated in the clinical trial, we collected cost information in the following seven: Australia, France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. The collection of cost data in these countries was structured through the use of worksheets to provide accurate and efficient cost reporting. We converted total average costs to average variable costs and then aggregated the data to develop study unit costs. When unit costs were unavailable, we developed an index table, based on a market-basket approach, to estimate unit costs. To estimate the cost of a given procedure, the market-basket estimation process required that cost information be available for at least one country. When cost information was unavailable in all countries for a given procedure, we estimated costs using a method based on physician-work and practice-expense resource-based relative value units. Finally, we converted study unit costs to a common currency using purchasing power parity measures. Through this costing exercise we developed a set of unit costs for patient services and per diem hospital services. We conclude by discussing the implications of our costing exercise and suggest guidelines to facilitate more effective multinational costing exercises.\n\nPre-Interaction Management in Multinational Companies in Central Europe\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNekvapil, Jiri; Sherman, Tamah\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis article is devoted to the linguistic, communicative and sociocultural situation in branches of multinational companies located in the Czech Republic and Hungary.

Of course, internal policies in the poorer countries help to determine how fast and how widely prosperity is dispersed and shared throughout their populations. But the significant fact is that foreign direct investment has been critical in creating large increases in per capita output, and without that it would be only the poverty that could be shared. A related conclusion suggested bymoreÂ Â» this analysis is that foreign direct investment has been a far more important promoter of growth than has foreign economic aid. To be sure, some forms of aid were not meant to promote economic expansion, but simply humanitarian relief from hunger or disease. Even so, much aid has been explicitly intended to stimulate development, and sometimes with considerable fanfare. Investment is more effective than aid in another strategic respect. The former actively encourages capitalist enterprise, both directly and indirectly. It does so by example, and through enlisting a portion of the local population in its activities. It does so, also, through the higher incomes it generates for consumers and the business it activates among local suppliers, processors, and others.Â«Â less\n\nMultinational Limited Objective Experiment II (MN LOE II)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2003-06-01\n\nmultinational ONA development to the international players for the first time.

A diagnosis of a chronic illness such as multiple sclerosis (MS) can influence a person's employment status. Previous studies have reported that demographic and disease-related aspects can predict whether a person with MS will leave their job. The aim of the study was to assess the factors that people with MS believe to contribute to their employment status and to determine whether any of these differentiate people with MS who are employed from those who are not employed. A multinational questionnaire assessed aspects related to employment that facilitate or hinder job maintenance. Data was collected in 18 European countries. A total of 1,141 questionnaires were completed. Of those responding, 694 (61%) subjects were employed and 477 (39%) were unemployed. The items that significantly differentiated the groups were related to MS symptoms, workplace environment and financial considerations. While MS influences employment status for many people who face difficult symptoms, aspects like a flexible work schedule and financial security are important and perhaps key to promoting job maintenance among people with MS.\n\nSafety and Health in Multinational Enterprises: What Have We Learnt?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRomero, Ana Teresa\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAnalyzes the practices of multinationals in the sphere of occupational safety and health and poses the question of safety and health and industrial risks in terms of environmental problems.

The guidelines suggest that response (i.e., success of initial empirical antibiotic therapy without any modification) be determined at 72 h and again on day 5, and the reasons for modification should be stated. Blinding and stratification are to be encouraged, as should statistical consideration of trials specifically designed for showing equivalence. Patients enrolled in outpatient studies should be selected by use of a validated risk model, and patients should be carefully monitored after discharge from the hospital. Response and safety parameters should be recorded along with readmission rates. If studies use these guidelines, comparisons between studies will be simpler and will lead to further improvements in patient therapy.\n\nThe Mission Partner Environment: Challenges To Multinational Information Sharing\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-02-15\n\nHarvey , Royal Air Force 15 February 2016 DISTRIBUTION A.

The motivation for a human rights approach is clear: poverty and inequality create conditions for infectious diseases to thrive, and the diseases, in turn, interact with social-ecological systems to promulgate poverty, inequity and indignity. Governments and intergovernmental organisations should be concerned with the control and elimination of these diseases, as widespread infections delay economic growth and contribute to higher healthcare costs and slower processes for realising universal human rights. These social determinants and economic outcomes associated with infectious diseases should interest multinational companies, partly because they have bearing on corporate productivity and, increasingly, because new global norms impose on companies a responsibility to respect human rights, including the right to health. We reviewed historical and recent developments at the interface of infectious diseases, human rights and multinational corporations. Our inv"
