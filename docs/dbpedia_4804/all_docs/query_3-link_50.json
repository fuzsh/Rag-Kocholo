        "text": "Perfetti (upper-body) will be back in the Jets lineup on Friday.\n\nPerfetti has been out since Dec. 22nd due to an upper-body injury but will return to the Jets' lineup Friday vs. Tampa Bay. The 2020 1st round pick (10th overall) had been enjoying a strong breakout season prior to his injury, with six goals, 14 assists, 62 SOG and a +5 plus/minus through 33 games.\n\nWheeler (abdomen) will play Friday vs. the Lightning.\n\nWheeler has been out since Dec. 15th due to an abdomen injury but will return to the Jets' lineup Friday vs. Tampa Bay. The 36-year-old was having yet another strong season prior to the injury, with nine goals, 17 assists, 66 SOG, and 20 PIMs through 29 games played.\n\nEhlers (abdomen) will return to the Jets lineup on Friday.\n\nEhlers has not played since Oct. 17th due to an abdomen injury but will be back in the Winnipeg Jets' lineup Friday vs. Tampa Bay. The 26-year-old was off to a great start with three assists, seven SOG and one PPP through the first two games before his injury took away 36 games from his season.\n\nMarkstrom is expected to start Friday vs. the Islanders.\n\nMarkstrom allowed three goals on 25 shots (.880 SV%) for his second loss in three starts as he was defeated by Winnipeg in his last start. The 32-year-old has fought the puck all season long, with his 12-10-4 record, 2.79 GAA and .895 SV%. He takes on the New York Islanders, who have lost two of their last three games after a 4-2 loss to Edmonton yesterday.\n\nBrandon Duhaime will draw back into Minnesota's lineup Friday.\n\nDuhaime will get his first taste of NHL action since Nov. 23rd as he replaced Mats Zuccarello (upper body) in the Wilds' lineup. The 25-year-old has three goals, four points, 21 SOG and 20 PIMs through 14 games played earlier in the season.\n\nHedman (personal) will not play Friday in Winnipeg.\n\nHedman has a goal, 24 assists, 73 SOG, 14 PIMs and a +9 plus/minus through 35 games this season but will miss Friday's matchup vs. Winnipeg due to personal reasons. There is no timetable for Hedman's return at this time.\n\nMats Zuccarello is day-to-day and will miss both Wilds games this weekend (upper body).\n\nZuccarello has 16 goals, 24 assists, 105 SOG, 16 PIMs and 16 PPP through 37 games but will be forced to miss at least the Wilds' next two games as he recovers from an upper-body injury. Minnesota has stated they have hopes he will return by next weekend's road trip.\n\nPatrick Kane is day-to-day and will not play Friday (undisclosed).\n\nKane left Chicago's previous contest vs. Tampa Bay after just 13 shifts and 12:57 TOI due to an undisclosed injury and will sit out Friday as well. Kane has stated it is not a bad injury, just a lingering one, which is good news as the 34-year-old is leading the Blackhawks in both points (27) and assists (20) this season.\n\nBobrovsky will start Friday in Detroit.\n\nBobrovsky allowed five goals on 28 shots (.821 SV%) for his third loss in four starts as he was defeated by the New York Rangers his last time out. The 34-year-old has been struggling all season, with his 8-12-1 record, 3.32 GAA and .894 SV%. He will take on the Detroit Red Wings, who lost their last game 5-1 vs. New Jersey and are 21st in the NHL in goals per game (3.06).\n\nStalock is in the starter's crease at the Blackhawks morning skate.\n\nStalock allowed three goals on 28 shots (.893 SV%) for his third straight loss as he was defeated by Tampa Bay in his previous start. The 35-year-old has been one of the Blackhawks' best stories this season, with his 4-5-1 record, 2.77 GAA and .916 SV%. He will face the lowly Arizona Coyotes, who have lost three straight after a 6-2 loss to Philadelphia on Thursday.\n\nKaiden Guhle will be out a minimum of eight weeks with a knee injury.\n\nGuhle had been having a fantastic rookie season, with two goals, 12 assists, 36 SOG, 21 PIMs and a -14 plus/minus through 36 games but will miss at least a minimum of eight weeks due to a knee injury.\n\nBrendan Gallagher is expected to miss a minimum of two weeks (lower body).\n\nGallagher has four goals, five assists, 57 SOG, 31 PIMs and a -6 plus/minus but is expected to now miss at least two weeks due to a lower-body injury. It is the second time this season Gallagher has been forced to miss a chunk of time.\n\nConnor Hellebuyck missed Friday's optional skate and is expected to start vs. Tampa.\n\nHellebuyck stopped 33 of 35 shots (.943 SV%) for his third straight win as he defeated Calgary in his previous start. The 29-year-old is a leading Vezina Trophy candidate this season due to his 19-9-1 record, 2.31 GAA and .928 SV%. He will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, who just snapped a four-game winning streak with a 5-1 loss to Minnesota last game.\n\nFilip Gustavsson is considered day-to-day as he deals with illness and will not travel to Buffalo.\n\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled Zane McIntyre after it was announced Filip Gustavsson was feeling under the weather Friday. The Wilds' backup has been the better of their two goalies, with his 9-5-1 record, 2.25 GAA and .924 SV% and will hopefully not miss anytime due to illness.\n\nZane McIntyre has been recalled from Iowa (AHL).\n\nMcIntyre has a 7-7-0 record, .888 SV% and 3.32 GAA with Iowa (AHL) and has been recalled Friday after it was announced Filip Gustavsson will miss some time due to illness. McIntyre last played in the NHL in 2016-17, where he picked up eight games played, with a 3-4-1 record, .858 SV% and 3.97 GAA.\n\nShane Wright has been reassigned to the Kingston Frontenacs (OHL).\n\nWright is one day off from scoring one of the goals of the World Junior Tournament as he helped lead Team Canada to a gold medal victory over Czechia but will now head back to Kingston (OHL) instead of Seattle (NHL). In 8 games with the Kraken, he had a goal and an assist but will make a massive addition back to Kingston after 32 goals and 62 assists in 63 games in 2021-22.\n\nGustav Rydahl has been reassigned to Hartford (AHL).\n\nRydahl has four goals, nine points, 24 PIMs and a +2 plus/minus through 24 games with the Hartford Wolf Pack (AHL). He did not make his NHL debut during his call-up and will be hoping for another shot to do so later in the year.\n\nGeorgiev starts Thursday in Vancouver.\n\nGeorgiev allowed three goals on 28 shots (.893 SV%) for his fourth straight loss as he was beaten by Vegas in his previous start. The 26-year-old has been faltering as of late, but still holds a strong 15-6-3 record, with a .915 SV% and 2.68 GAA. He will hope for better fortunes against the Vancouver Canucks, who have lost their last three games after a 6-2 loss to the New York Islanders last game.\n\nPoehling (upper-body) is not on the ice for warmups and will not play in Vegas."
