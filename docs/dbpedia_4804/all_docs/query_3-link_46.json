        "text": "Following the Hartford Wolf Pack's practice on Dec. 20, head coach Kris Knoblauch was asked if he thought Will Cuylle was close to being NHL ready.\n\nWhile the question was specifically about the 20-year-old forward, Knoblauch's thoughtful answer shed light on a concern that could be applied to several New York Rangers' prospects.\n\n\"I don't think there's ever been a time where (the Rangers) have been too patient with a player and end up saying, ‘We missed our opportunity. We should have had this guy up,’\" he said during lohud.com's visit with the Blueshirts' American Hockey League affiliate.\n\n\"I think there's been a lot of times where we call them up (too soon) and ruin their confidence, then we had to send them back down and we're playing this yo-yo game,\" Hartford's fourth-year bench boss added. \"That's been an issue.\"\n\nThat critical analysis resonated as both blunt and inescapably true.\n\nWhat Knoblauch said out loud echoed what many others have tip-toed around. As an organization, the Rangers have struggled to develop prospects − specifically forwards − and properly acclimate them to the NHL.\n\nThat's led to the aptly put \"yo-yo game\" − a disconcerting cycle of young players being bounced around in the Rangers' lineup, yanked up and down from the minors, or even traded for diminished value.\n\nZac Jones:Prospect opens up about demotion and what comes next\n\nWill Cuylle:Prospect making progress, but when is his ETA?\n\nThat trend dates back for decades. How many first-round picks since 2000 have turned into legitimate impact players on Broadway? Marc Staal (2005) and Chris Kreider (2009) definitely fit the bill. To lesser degrees, you can argue Michael Del Zotto (2008), J.T. Miller (2011) and Brady Skjei (2012). But the overall success rate is subpar.\n\nIt should be noted that the Rangers went from 2013 through 2016 without any first-round picks, as they traded one after another to try and build a win-now team around Henrik Lundqvist. And the jury remains out on many recent picks, including nine first-round selections from 2017 through 2021.\n\nThat rebuild era began with center Lias Andersson (No. 7 overall in 2017), who turned out to be a swing-and-miss pick. He was ultimately traded to the L.A. Kings for a 2020 second-rounder (which, ironically, turned into Cuylle) and has failed to hold down an NHL role there, too.\n\nTo their credit, it looks like the Rangers hit on defensemen K'Andre Miller (No. 22 overall in 2018) and Braden Schneider (No. 19 overall in 2020). Those two have already become staples on the blue line, as have D prospects they traded for in Adam Fox and Ryan Lindgren.\n\nBut it's the stagnant development from many skill players that's most troubling. Four first-round forwards from the rebuild are on the current roster − Filip Chytil (No. 21 overall in 2017), Vitali Kravtsov (No. 9 overall in 2018), Kaapo Kakko (No. 2 overall in 2019) and Alexis Lafrenière (No. 1 overall in 2020) − yet none have come close to reaching their full potential.\n\nThere's still ample time, with Chytil and Kakko both showing signs of growth this season, even if their point totals leave much to be desired. But there's been reluctance to trust Kravtsov with a regular place in the lineup (following a roller coaster of drama and mismanagement in previous seasons) and Lafrenière continues to fall short of lofty expectations.\n\nThe latest example came last week, when Rangers head coach Gerard Gallant made the shocking decision to healthy scratch their most prized draft pick for Thursday's 2-1 shootout loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning. He's hoping it will be \"a wake-up call\" for the 21-year-old winger − but even if the motivational tactic works, the fact that it reached the point where he felt it necessary to bench Lafrenière during his third season is a red flag.\n\nThe organization’s previous failings don’t fall at the feet of team president Chris Drury, who has been in charge for less than two years. But the onus is on him to learn from past mistakes and make the proper course corrections, so that current and future crops of young talent − including 2021 first-round pick Brennan Othmann, who will begin his entry-level contract next season − are more successful than those of years past.\n\nSome of the internal questions they should be asking include:\n\nDespite their can’t-miss draft status, would Kakko and Lafrenière have benefited from further development at lower levels before they were thrust into the NHL spotlight?\n\nHow could the Rangers have improved communication to set expectations and avoid the disappointment that ultimately led to trade requests from Andersson, Kravtsov and Nils Lundkvist?\n\nIs there more they can do to prepare young players to make the leap to the NHL? Why aren't their perceived high-end skills translating?\n\nAnd once they arrive in New York, how can they foster − not fracture − their confidence? Wouldn’t it be best to give them consistent roles and avoid the constant lineup juggling? And is it that crazy to allow them some power-play opportunities?\n\nWithout that kind of introspection, the same old yo-yo game is destined to continue.\n\nLack of firepower for AHL Hartford\n\nKnoblauch's preference for patience with the next wave of prospects is a step in the right direction, but the Rangers' system isn't as bountiful as it was when the coach first arrived in 2019.\n\nThe Wolf Pack entered the new year with an uninspiring 11-13-1-5 record. They've been better of late, with a 6-4-0-1 mark in their last 11 games, but still sit in last place in the Atlantic Division.\n\nAt various points this season, their roster has featured nine different players who were drafted in that 2017-2021 window. Two have been reassigned − forward Ryder Korczak and defenseman Hunter Skinner − while the remaining seven aren't exactly knocking down the NHL door.\n\nHartford's top forward prospect is Cuylle, who's tied for the team lead with eight goals. But his 0.5 points per game average over 30 appearances backs Knoblauch's opinion that there's more work for him to do at the AHL level.\n\nThe Wolf Pack's other rebuild-drafted forwards include Karl Henriksson (2019 second-round pick), Lauri Pajuniemi (2018 fifth-round pick) and Matt Rempe (2020 sixth-round pick), but none have eclipsed Pajuniemi's modest total of 10 points. Undrafted winger Bobby Trivigno has been more productive than any of them, with 13 points (five goals and eight assists) through 26 games.\n\nQuite frankly, there aren't any numbers that jump off the page. Turner Elson, a 30-year-old journeyman with three NHL games on his résumé, is the team's leading scorer with only 17 points. Scoring has been Hartford's biggest shortcoming so far this season, ranking 29th out of 32 AHL teams in goals scored.\n\n\"For a team that's struggling, our defensive play is pretty good. We have not been giving up very much in the last 15 games,\" Knoblauch said. \"Now, we've been spending a lot of time on goal scoring and how we're going to be able to generate offense. One thing we've been doing well is breaking the puck out, so we've been having a lot of offense off the rush. But in the offensive zone, we’re trying to find ways to generate offense.\"\n\nGustav Rydahl 'progressing very nicely'\n\nThe offense has received a significant boost from the addition of Ryan Carpenter.\n\nA veteran with 329 games of NHL experience, the 31-year-old has replaced Jonny Brodzinski − who was recalled by the Rangers last month − as Hartford's No. 1 center. He's been far and away their most dangerous player since clearing waivers and arriving on Dec. 9, tying Cuylle for the team lead with eight goals in only 10 games played.\n\n\"He's been great for our group,\" Knoblauch said. \"He’s been playing on a line with Elson and (Austin) Rueschoff, and those two play their best hockey when they play with Carpenter. I don't think that's a coincidence.\"\n\nCombined with the second line of Cuylle, Pajuniemi and Tanner Fritz, the Wolf Pack have benefited from keeping the same top-six forwards for the past few weeks. But some of Knoblauch's highest praise was directed at Gustav Rydahl, who has been centering the third line in between Trivigno and Alex Whelan.\n\nThe 28-year-old has a unique background, having played his entire career in Sweden before deciding to finally take his chances across the pond this season. He was one of the final cuts from Rangers' training camp and has quickly become an all-situations player for Hartford after an early adjustment period and brief injury absence.\n\nRydahl has never been a big offensive producer, as evidenced by nine points (four goals and five assists) through 24 games. But he's a well-rounded forward with defensive instincts and strong physical traits. Knoblauch referred to him as \"one of the best skaters\" in the AHL.\n\n\"Rydahl has been getting better every single day,\" he added. \"There was a transition to playing the North American game, as opposed to what he was doing in Europe, and also systems. Our system is completely different than when he played last year. He was a man-on-man; we’re more zone. ... But he's starting to understand those (concepts) and becoming a really important player for us. He's on our second power play and he's one of our top-four penalty killers. I’ve been using him for a lot of key D-zone faceoffs, so Rydahl has been progressing very nicely.\"\n\nMatthew Robertson update\n\nWhile Knoblauch noted the improving health and depth at center as a key to better results in December, he made it clear the strength of the team has been its defense.\n\nZac Jones (2019 third-round pick) and Matthew Robertson (2019 second-round pick) are Hartford's top blue-line prospects, with the former already appearing in 38 career games with the Rangers. Meanwhile, the latter is still awaiting his first NHL opportunity.\n\nThe fact that it hasn't come yet raises questions about whether the organization views Robertson as a realistic option to fill the left-handed void on the Blueshirts' bottom pair. He said \"the consistency part is probably the biggest thing\" he needs to prove to them, with Knoblauch acknowledging that the 21-year-old had \"ups and downs\" during his first professional season last year.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 201-pounder dealt with an injury early in his second pro season, but he's been healthy for a two-month stretch now while logging big minutes for the Wolf Pack.\n\n\"We've relied on him quite heavily, and the consistency has been much, much better,\" Knoblauch said. \"You can see that he’s understanding the program. It’s obviously a big transition from junior hockey, where there’s less physicality and you have a lot more time to make plays. Here in the American League, it's a lot different, and I think he's had a lot of really strong games.\"\n\nRobertson has posted 10 points (three goals and seven assists) through 27 games, but his minus-10 rating is tied for second-worst on the team with D partner Andy Welinski. By contrast, Jones leads Hartford with a plus-11 rating while appearing in only 12 games so far.\n\nLearning curve is steep for Dylan Garand\n\nThe most-used goalie for the Wolf Pack has been veteran Louis Domingue, who's posted a .906 save percentage and a 2.53 goals against average through 18 appearances. If the Rangers needed a recall at any point, the 30-year-old would be first in line.\n\nThe focus for prospect Dylan Garand is purely development and adapting to the pro game. Those growing pains are evident in his .889 SV% and 3.31 GAA, showing what a leap it can be for a goalie who's still only 20 years old.\n\nComing from the WHL, where Garand was named the best goalie in the league and lived in a communal setting with teammates, to being an AHL backup in a foreign city has been a culture shock.\n\n\"The biggest adjustment is kind of off the ice – living on your own, being on your own, doing all that stuff,\" he said. \"It's nice to have people to talk to and see someone every morning and every night, that kind of thing. When you don't have that, it's a little different.\"\n\nThe other challenge has been staying sharp while typically only starting one game per week.\n\nWith the Kamloops Blazers or Team Canada in the World Juniors, Garand was the man in the net. But now he's playing less and trying to navigate a new routine − and with the reigning Vezina Trophy winner, Igor Shesterkin, residing in New York, the 2020 fourth-round pick knows being a backup is a role he needs to get used to.\n\n\"It’s been hard and kind of puts more pressure on yourself to perform, because you're only getting a little bit of opportunity,\" he said. \"That's been different and definitely a challenge here that I'm still trying to figure out and learn. Obviously, when I do make that next step, it's going to be important to learn how to do that because the situation up there will probably be the same. ... When you don’t play as much, practice becomes kind of like your games.\""
