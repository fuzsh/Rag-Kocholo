        "text": "Here is the Inside The Rink FULL NHL Trade Deadline breakdown. It was a wild Trade Deadline week and was an enjoyment for all NHL fans. We have compiled all of the moves for you below and give a small analysis for all 32 teams. If you prefer to listen to a breakdown of all these trades, give a listen to our 2023 NHL Trade Deadline stream HERE.\n\nAtlantic Division\n\nBoston Bruins\n\nIN: Dmitry Orlov, Garnet Hathaway, Tyler Bertuzzi, Shane Bowers, Andrei Svetlakov(signing rights)\n\nOUT: 2023 1st, 2024 5th, 2025 2nd, 2023 5th, Craig Smith, Keith Kinkaid, 2024 1st(conditional), 2025 4th\n\nGrade: A-\n\nDon Sweeney kept his word and went all in at the deadline. The Bruins addressed their needs by adding a top-four left-shot defenseman in Dmitry Orlov, a fourth-line grinder in Garnet Hathaway, and a skilled grinder in Tyler Bertuzzi, who has shown he can score 30 goals in a season. The Bruins also made a minor move as they cleared the path for young goaltenders in their system by swapping Keith Kinkaid for center prospect Shane Bowers.\n\nBuffalo Sabres\n\nIN: Riley Stillman, 2023 3rd, Future Considerations, Austin Strand, Jordan Greenway, 2025 7th\n\nOUT: Rasmus Asplund, Chase Priskie, Anders Bjork, Erik Portillo, Josh Bloom, 2023 2nd(VGK), 2024 5th\n\nGrade: B\n\nThe Sabres stayed busy as they made several minor deals. Their biggest acquisition was forward Jordan Greenway from the Minnesota Wild. He provides a big body and defense from the wing position, which should help this young team. They also acquired defenseman Riley Stillman, known for his physicality, which this team lacks. The Sabres are still missing a few pieces but are on the right path to becoming a contender with their young core.\n\nDetroit Red Wings\n\nIN: 2023 1st(NYI Conditional), 2023 2nd(VAN), 2024 1st(BOS Conditional), 2025 4th(BOS), 2025 7th(STL), Dylan McLaughlin, 2023 4th(MIN)\n\nOUT: Filip Hronek, Tyler Bertuzzi, Jakub Vrana, Oskar Sundqvist\n\nGrade: B-\n\nThe biggest deal for the Red Wings was signing team captain Dylan Larkin to an eight-year extension. After months of stagnant negotiations, Steve Yzerman finally got a deal done to keep Larkin in Detroit. They also made a couple of deals as they sent Tyler Bertuzzi to Boston for a first and fourth-round pick. Yzerman also flipped Filip Hronek to the Canucks for a first and second-round pick. Detroit continues to stock up on draft picks to use for future deals.\n\nFlorida Panthers\n\nIN: N/A\n\nOUT: N/A\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe Panthers have accepted their fate this season as they sit on the outside looking in on the Eastern Conference playoff race. It has been a disappointing season for a team that was the Presidents Trophy winner last year. The Panthers’ front office will have plenty to address this offseason as they must improve.\n\nMontreal Canadiens\n\nIN: Denis Gurianov, Frederic Allard, Tony Sund(signing rights), 2024 5th(SJS)\n\nOUT: Evgeni Dadonov, Nathan Schnarr, Arvid Henrikson(signing rights)\n\nGrade: C\n\nFor a team many thought would be sellers, the Canadiens and Kent Hughes stayed pretty quiet as they focused more on retaining salary in exchange for draft picks. It seems the Habs think they are closer to competing than the rest of the league, as they kept a handful of veterans who were sought after by contenders. It should be noted the League Office sent out a memo warning against adding players with the purpose of adding them to LTIR. This did not help Hughes regarding Monahan.\n\nOttawa Senators\n\nIN: Jakob Chychrun, Patrick Brown, Future Considerations, Julien Gauthier, 2023 7th(NYR Conditional)\n\nOUT: Tyler Motte, Nikita Zaitsev, 2023 2nd, 2026 4th, 2023 1st(Conditional), 2024 2nd(WSH Conditional), 2026 2nd, 2023 6th\n\nGrade: B+\n\nThe Senators went all in again as they emerged as the winners of the Jakub Chychrun sweepstakes. This was a great follow-up move after acquiring star forward Alex DeBrincat in the offseason. Chychrun addresses a significant need for defense and helps accelerate Ottawa’s rebuild. The Senators are one step closer to becoming a playoff contender but must still address their need for a goaltender in the offseason.\n\nTampa Bay Lightning\n\nIN: Tanner Jeannot, Michael Eyssimont\n\nOUT: Cal Foote, Vladislav Namestnikov, 2023 3rd, 2023 4th, 2023 5th, 2024 2md, 2025 1st(Conditional)\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe Lightning did one thing, and one thing only, overpaying for a bottom-six forward. This seems to be turning into a theme in Tampa. While Jeannot fills a need for Tampa Bay, they still gave up a haul for a 25-year-old with 34 career goals in 154 games. Even with this move, they still didn’t move the needle enough to keep up with all the other contenders in the division and conference.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs\n\nIN: Ryan O’Reilly, Noel Acciari, Josh Pillar(signing rights), Jake McCabe, Sam Lafferty, Erik Gustafsson, Luke Schenn, Radim Zohorna, 2023 1st(BOS), 2024 5th(conditional), 2025 5th(conditional),\n\nOUT: 2023 1st, 2023 3rd(OTT), 2024 2nd, Adam Gaudette, Mikhail Abramov, Joey Anderson, Pavel Gogolev, 2025 1st(conditional), 2026 2nd, Rasmus Sandin, 2023 3rd, Dryden Hunt\n\nGrade: A+\n\nThe busiest team at the deadline by far as they revamped their defense, bringing in three new defensemen in McCabe, Schenn, and Gustafsson. On top of that, they added Stanley Cup champion Ryan O’Reilly to their forward group, making the Leafs one of the most improved teams in the NHL. Honorable mentions Sam Lafferty and Noel Acciari will add the depth and “gritty” style of play that will help this Toronto squad compete with Tampa and Boston. Kyle Dubas indeed went all out, as his job is on the line, as he still doesn’t have a new contract for next year. Hopefully, with all these moves, the Leafs can finally get out of the first round and make some noise in the playoffs.\n\nMetropolitan Division\n\nCarolina Hurricanes\n\nIN: Jesse Puljujarvi, Shayne Gostisbehere\n\nOUT: Patrik Puistola, 2026 3rd\n\nGrade: F\n\nWhile the Hurricanes made two additions with Jesse Puljujarvi and Shayne Gostisbehere, they failed to make any significant additions. While Gostisbehere provides offense from the blue line, his defensive metrics are not the greatest. The pressure is on Puljujarvi now as he is finally free of Edmonton and has the chance for a new start, but he must find a way to produce. Carolina watched the competition in the Metropolitan Division go add significant pieces. Yet they continued to hold true to their methods, taking players squeezed out of other teams due to cap implications and plugging them into their lineup. Carolina struck out on Meier and seemed to have folded.\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n\nIN: 2023 5th(BOS), Jonathan Quick, 2023 1st(LAK Conditional), 2024 4th, Jon Gillies, Michael Hutchinson, 2025 7th(VGK)\n\nOUT: Jonathan Quick, Gustav Nyquist, Joonas Korpisalom Vladislav Gavrikov, Jakub Voracek, 2023 6th\n\nGrade: D\n\nAfter being misled by the Boston Bruins, the Blue Jackets fell into panic mode as they tried to find a new buyer for Gavrikov. While they finally found a trade partner in LA, they had to include goaltender Korpisalo and take back Jonathan Quick in return for the same price Boston would pay just for Gavrikov. Quick made it clear he didn’t want to be in Columbus, and within 24 hours, he was sent to Vegas. While Columbus did acquire some draft picks, they are still a ways off from competing for a playoff spot, and this trade deadline did nothing to help speed that up. CBJ also did a tidy bit of business moving Nyquist to the Wild for a 2023 5th-round pick(BOS) and moving the Voracek contract to Arizona for AHL goalie Jon Gillies. Columbus is set to have a lot of cap flexibility this offseason which could help fuel this retool.\n\nNew Jersey Devils\n\nIN: Curtis Lazar, Timo Meier, Scott Harrington, Zacharie Emond, Santeri Hatakka, Timur Ibragimov, 2024 5th(COL)\n\nOUT: Andreas Johnsson, Fabian Zetterlund, Nikita Okhotiuk, Shakir Mukhamadullin, 2023 1st(conditional), 2024 2nd(conditional), 2024 7th, 2024 4th\n\nGrade: B\n\nThe Devils may have had one of the best trades of the deadline by acquiring Timo Meier and not giving up any of their top prospects. Meier is the answer to the Devils’ top-six winger need, and once Fitzgerald can get an extension in place, this trade will look even better. With the under-the-radar move of Curtis Lazar, the Devils’ bottom six will have the speed and grit to get through a playoff series. The Devils are set up to be a threat for years as they are the new face in the Metropolitan Division.\n\nNew York Islanders\n\nIN: Bo Horvat, Pierre Engvall\n\nOUT: Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Raty, 2023 1st(conditional), 2024 3rd\n\nGrade: C+\n\nThe Islanders’ biggest deadline deal came before the All-Star break as they acquired Bo Horvat. While they were able to sign him to an eight-year extension, the Islanders still lack the pieces to make a serious playoff run. A few more deadline acquisitions by general manager Lou Lamoriello would have been nice to see, especially with his team holding on to the top Wild Card spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nNew York Rangers\n\nIN: Vladimir Tarasenko, Niko Mikkola, Tyler Motte, Willaim Lockwood, 2026 7th(VAN), Future Considerations, Patrick Kane, Cooper Zech, Anton Blidh, Wyatt Kalynuk\n\nOUT: Samuel Blais, Hunter Skinner, 2023 1st(conditional), 2024 4th(conditional), Julien Gauthier, 2023 7th(conditional), Vitali Kravstov, Austin Rueschhoff, Andy Welinski, 2023 2nd(conditional), 2025 4th, 2025 3rd(conditional), Gustav Rydahl, Future Considerations\n\nGrade: A+\n\nThey finally got their man Patrick Kane, which barely cost them anything. On top of that, they acquired Vladimir Tarasenko as they transformed their top six into one of if not the most dangerous top six in the league. They also added a handful of depth pieces that will come in handy for their highly anticipated playoff run. This team has a lot of pressure as they truly went all in and must deliver in the playoffs.\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n\nIN: Future Considerations(NSH), Brendan Lemieux, 2024 5th, 2023 6th\n\nOUT: Isaac Ratcliffe, Zack MacEwen, Patrick Brown\n\nGrade: F\n\nThe deadline was a complete fail as the Flyers had several players they should have moved and failed to. The biggest two being James van Riemsdyk and Kevin Hayes. It seemed JVR was on the move, but the deal with Detroit fell through ten minutes before the deadline closed. One thing is clear the Flyers need turnover, and the deadline was the perfect opportunity to kickstart the rebuild.\n\nPittsburgh Penguins\n\nIN: Peter Diliberatore, 2024 3rd, Mikael Granlund, Nick Bonino, Dmitry Kulikov\n\nOUT: Teddy Blueger, 2023 2nd, 2023 7th, 2024 5th(conditional), Brock McGinn, 2024 3rd\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe Penguins made a fleury of minor deals that really didn’t move the needle. With their core past its prime and the playoff window fastly closing, many would have thought general manager Ron Hextall would have been more aggressive to get this team over the hump.\n\nWashington Capitals\n\nIN: Craig Smith, 2023 1st, 2024 3rd, 2025 2nd, Andrei Svetlakov(signing rights),2024 3rd, Rasmus Sandin, 2025 2nd\n\nOUT: Dmitry Orlov, Garnet Hathaway, Andrei Svetlakov(signing rights), Marcus Johansson, Erik Gustafsson, 2023 1st(BOS), Lars Eller\n\nGrade: B+\n\nThe Capitals and general manager Brian MacLellan did an excellent job recouping assets on pending free agents. They accepted defeat and realized a playoff berth was becoming bleak and went the seller’s route as they retool the roster for next season. They turned five pending UFAs and Boston’s first-round pick into three third-round picks, two second-round picks, and defenseman Rasmus Sandin.\n\nCentral Division\n\nArizona Coyotes\n\nIN: Shea Weber, 2023 5th(VGK), 2025 3rd(NYR conditional), Patrick Kane, 2026 3rd(CAR), 2023 1st(OTT conditional), 2024 2nd (WASH conditional), 2026 2nd, Jakub Voracek, 2023 6th(CBJ), Michael Kesselring, 2023 3rd(EDM), Brett Ritchie, Connor Mackey,\n\nOUT: Dysin Mayo, Vili Saarijarvi(signing rights), Shayne Gostisbehere, Jakob Chychrun, Jon Gillies, Nick Bjugstad, Cam Dineen, Nick Ritchie, Troy Stecher\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe Chychrun saga is finally over, but it didn’t end as the Coyotes had hoped. After the reported price being two first-round picks plus a prospect, the Yotes settled for a first and two second-round picks. Besides moving on from Chychrun, they didn’t do much else as the disaster in the desert continues.\n\nChicago Blackhawks\n\nIN: Nikita Zaitsev, 2023 2nd(OTT), 2026 4th(OTT), Hunter Drew, Andreas Englund, Joey Anderson, Pavel Gogolev, 2025 1st(TOR conditional), 2026 2nd(TOR), Vili Saarijarvi(signing rights), Andy Welinski, 2023 nd(NYR conditional), 2025 4th, Anders Bjork, Maxim Golod, Anton Khudobin, Austin Wagner\n\nOUT: Future Considerations, Josiah Slavin, Jack Johnson, Jake McCabe, Sam Lafferty, 2024 5th(conditional), 2025 5th(conditional), Patrick Kane, Cooper Zech, Dylan Sikura, Max Domi, Dylan Wells\n\nGrade: C+\n\nThe Patrick Kane era in Chicago is finally over as they moved on from their long-time winger in hopes of helping with the rebuild. Due to Kane only wanting to play for the Rangers, Chicago’s hands were tied as they didn’t receive the return they hoped they would get. They also moved on from several other players, including Max Domi, as the Blackhawks now field one of the worst lineups of all time as they tank for Connor Bedard.\n\nColorado Avalanche\n\nIN: Keith Kinkaid, Jack Johnson, Lars Eller, Gustav Rydahl\n\nOUT: Shane Bowers, Andreas Englund, 2025 2nd, Anton Blidh\n\nGrade: B-\n\nThe defending Stanley Cup champions didn’t need much to bolster their lineup but understood they needed to add some pieces. Their most significant addition was Lars Eller, a veteran center with one Stanley Cup to his name and scored in the biggest moments on the biggest stage. Adding a depth forward like Eller is the deal that pays off when it matters the most.\n\nDallas Stars\n\nIN: Evgeni Dadonov, Max Domi, Dylan Wells, Scott Reedy\n\nOUT: Denis Gurianov, Anton Khudobin, 2025 2nd, Jacob Peterson\n\nGrade: D-\n\nWhile the Stars acquired Max Domi, who is having a career year, they didn’t move the needle that much. Adding a defenseman should have been their top priority, but they failed to address that need. Now they must hope their offense and goaltender Jake Oettinger can carry them to a deep playoff run.\n\nMinnesota Wild\n\nIN: 2025 4th(TOR), 2023 5th(BOS), Marcus Johansson, Gustav Nyquist, 2023 2nd(VGK), 2024 5th(BUF), Oskar Sundqvist, John Klingberg\n\nOUT: Josh Pillar(signing rights), Andrei Svetlakov(signing rights), 2024 3rd, Jordan Greenway, 2023 4th, Andrej Sustr, Nikita Nesterenko(signing rights), 2025 4th\n\nGrade: B+\n\nWhile the Wild didn’t add any major names to their roster, they were highly active at the deadline as Bill Guerin took advantage of the team’s deadline cap space. The Wild, on several occasions, took on salary as a third team in exchange for draft picks. The biggest deal came when they shipped Jordan Greenway to the Buffalo Sabres without having to retain salary. This was a huge win as it freed $3 million in cap space each of the next two years. The Wild can now extend players or bring in free agents this off-season.\n\nNashville Predators\n\nIN: 2024 2nd(WPG), Cal Foote,2025 1st(TBL conditional), 2023 3rd(TBL), 2023 4th(TBL), 2023 5th(TBL), 2024 2nd(TBL), Isaac Ratcliffe, Austin Rueschhoff, Tyson Barrie, Reid Schaefer, 2023 1st(EDM), 2024 4th(EDM), 2023 2nd(PIT), Rasmus Asplund\n\nOUT: Nino Niederreiter, Tanner Jeannot, Future Considerations, Mattias Ekholm, 2024 6th, Mikael Granlund, 2025 7th\n\nGrade: A-\n\nOne of the biggest winners of the 2023 NHL Trade Deadline, the Preds stocked piled picks thanks to the overpay by the Tampa Lightning. It has been an average season for Nashville, as they haven’t played up to their usual standards. They turned to secure the future with a playoff berth not looking likely. This was an excellent deadline for them as they can now use those picks in the draft or in trades to bring in NHL-ready talent. They now have 13 picks in the upcoming draft in June.\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n\nIN: Samuel Blais, Hunter Skinner, 2023 1st(NYR conditional), 2024 4th(NYR conditional), Adam Gaudette, Mikhail Abramov, 2023 1st(TOR), 2023 3rd(OTT), 2024 2nd(TOR), Zach Dean, Jakub Vrana,\n\nOUT: Vladimir Tarasenko, Niko Mikkola. Ryan O’Reilly, Noel Acciari, Ivan Barbashev, Dylan McLaughlin, 2025 7th\n\nGrade: B+\n\nOne of the busiest teams this deadline as they unloaded veteran players Ryan O’Reilly and Vladimir Tarasenko while bringing in a young talented forward in Jakub Vrana. The Blues cashed in on O’Reilly and Tarasenko as they got a first-round pick for each player, plus more. St. Louis now has three first-round picks in the upcoming draft, which is set to be extremely deep.\n\nWinnipeg Jets\n\nIN: Nino Niederreiter, Vladislav Namestnikov\n\nOUT: 2024 2nd, 2025 4th\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe Jets kept it simple at the deadline as they addressed their secondary scoring need. They didn’t go big but brought in a player capable of scoring and providing valuable playoff experience. Niederreiter should fit in well on this team, as his style of play is exactly what this top or middle six can use, depending on where they want to slot him in.\n\nPacific Division\n\nAnaheim Ducks\n\nIN: Josiah Slavin, 2024 3rd(SJS), Chase Priskie, Brock McGinn, 2024 3rd(PIT), Andrej Sustr, Nikita Nesterenko(signing rights), 2025 4th(MIN)\n\nOUT: Hunter Drew, Henry Thrun, Maxim Golod, Austin Strand, Dmitry Kulikov, John Klingberg\n\nGrade: C-\n\nThe Ducks were destined to be sellers from the beginning of the season, as this team is still faring contenders. Their biggest focus is losing enough games to be in the hunt for Connor Bedard. They did unload the two names many expected to be moved as John Klingberg was moved to the Minnesota Wild and Dmitry Kulikov to the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was nothing special as the team did exactly what they were expected to do.\n\nCalgary Flames\n\nIN: Dryden Hunt, Nick Ritchie, Troy Stecher\n\nOUT: Radim Zohorna, Brett Ritchie, Connor Mackey\n\nGrade: F\n\nThe Flames failed to make any significant moves as they are unsure they will even make the playoffs this season. Their biggest move came swapping one Ritchie brother for the other as they sent Brett to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for Nick.\n\nEdmonton Oilers\n\nIN: Patrik Puistola, Mattias Ekholm, 2024 6th(NSH), Nick Bjugstad, Cam Dineen\n\nOUT: Jesse Puljujarvi, Tyson Barrie, Reid Schaefer, 2023 1st, 2024 4th, Michael Kesselring, 2023 3rd\n\nGrade: A-\n\nThe Oilers finally improved their defense by bringing in Mattias Ekholm from the Nashville Predators. Ekholm is a high upgrade on the blue line and has term left on his contract. Another plus for the Oilers is they finally moved on from Jesse Puljujarvi, ending that saga. The Oilers are now better set up for a playoff run, as Connor McDavid now has a solid player on his blue line.\n\nLos Angles Kings\n\nIN: Joonas Korpisalo, Vladislav Gavrikov, Erik Portillo, Zack MacEwen, Nathan Schnarr, Future Considerations\n\nOUT: Jonathan Quick, 2023 1st(conditional), 2024 3rd, 2023 3rd, Brendan Lemieux, 2024 5th, Frederic Allard, Austin Wagner\n\nGrade: B+\n\nThe Kings were busy this deadline as they moved on from a few players and finally got that top-four defenseman they had been missing. On top of acquiring Gavrikov, they swapped 37-year-old Quick for 28-year-old Joonas Korpisalo in the deal. The Kings now have two young goalies in Korpisalo and Pheonix Copley. The biggest takeaway for the Kings was being able to upgrade without unloading any of their top prospects, as many thought they would have to.\n\nSan Jose Sharks\n\nIN: Andreas Johnsson, Fabian Zetterlund, Nikita Okhotiuk, Shakir Mukhamadullin, 2023 1st(conditional), 2024 2nd(conditional), 2024 7th, Henry Thrun, Vladislav Namestnikov, Arvid Henrikson(signing rights), 2023 7th(PIT), 2024 5th(PIT conditional), 2025 4th(WPG), Jacob Peterson\n\nOUT: Timo Meier, Scott Harrington, Zacharie Emond, Santeri Hatakka, Timur Ibragimov, 2024 5th(COL), 2024 3rd(SJS), Michael Eyssimont, Nick Bonino, Tony Sund(signing rights), 2024 5th, Vladislav Namestnikov, Scott Reedy\n\nGrade: B\n\nThe Sharks had no choice but to move Timo Meier, and they got a major return for him. On top of draft picks, they got a handful of players to fill out their NHL lineup and prospect pool. There was no chance Meier would stay in San Jose long term, and they got the best possible return for him. They also did good by veteran forward Nick Bonino by sending him back to Pittsburgh for barely anything.\n\nSeattle Kraken\n\nIN: N/A\n\nOUT: N/A\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe Seattle Kraken could have a higher grade as doing nothing could be considered the right choice by general manager Ron Francis. After all, the Kraken is still in just its second season as a franchise and is already enjoying success. If they were still in first place in the Division, I think fans would have seen Francis make some moves. But with how tight the Pacific is and the Kraken sitting in third with the Oilers on their heels, Francis is keeping the future in mind before compromising it for the present.\n\nVancouver Canucks\n\nIN: Anthony Beauvillier, Aatu Raty, 2023 1st(NYI conditional), Vitali Kravstov, Josh Bloom, 2023 3rd(TOR), Filip Hronek, 2023 4th(DET), 2024 4th(NJD, Future Considerations\n\nOUT: Bo Horvat, William Lockwood, 2026 7th, Riley Stillman, Luke Schenn, 2023 1st(NYI conditional), 2023 2nd, Curtis Lazar, Wyatt Kalynuk\n\nGrade: F\n\nThe Canucks have been a mess all season, and that continued at the trade deadline as they didn’t move any of the players that wanted out. The trend stems back to last year when they failed to move JT Miller. While they unloaded Bo Horvat and Luke Schenn, they failed to move Brock Boeser, a hot name with a handful of teams interested. The Canucks have a lot of issues to work out, starting from the management level down.\n\nVegas Golden Knights\n\nIN: Dysin Mayo, Ivan Barbashev, Teddy Blueger, Jonathan Quick\n\nOUT: Shea Weber, 2023 5th, Zach Dean, Peter Diliberatore, 2024 3rd, Michael Hutchinson, 2025 7th\n\nGrade: C+\n\nSitting atop the Pacific Division, you could say the Knights don’t need much, but with the amount of LTIR, this team has many expected them to do more. They did address their need for a veteran goaltender, as all of their goalies are injured, but they acquired Jonathan Quick, who is having the worst year of his career. If Quick can turn it on in the playoffs like Kings fans had seen in the past when he won two Stanley Cups, this deal will be a steal, but for now, there are still a lot of what-ifs."
