        "text": "LOVELAND, Colo. – As the Eagles start their 16th straight run in the playoffs, they meet a familiar foe in the Ontario Reign. This year, the Eagles finished 4-4 in the regular season against their division rival, but when it comes to playoffs, they went 3-0 last postseason against Ontario. And with the third seed, they have the home ice advantage through the first round. Colorado knows how to play rough and tumble hockey if they need to. A gritty victory in overtime last night helped prove that.\n\nFirst Period\n\nThe first of what could be three games against the Ontario Reign started out heavy. Lots of hits were thrown by both teams. Alex Galchenyuk was one of the players that stood out, throwing several hits himself including one in open ice.\n\nFor the most part, the Eagles would dominate puck possession in the frame, keeping the puck in the Reign’s zone a lot of the time. There were only three penalties in the period, two of which were at the same time to cause a four-on-four. Around the halfway point of the second, T.J. Tynan and Gustav Rydahl had a bit of a scuffle, so they both went off for roughing. With just over two minutes left, Sam Malinski would receive his first pro penalty with a delay of game infraction. Colorado would go on to kill it off and no one would score in the period.\n\nSecond Period\n\nOntario started to push back hard against Colorado from the beginning of the second. It didn’t take too long for Ontario to capitalize, as the Reign would throw one on the board within the first two minutes of the period. Colorado tried to clear it from their zone, but it hit Callahan Burke and stayed in. Cole Krygier gathered it up and snapped it on goaltender Justus Annunen. The puck died and Nate Thompson chipped it over Annnunen’s shoulder to open the scoring.\n\nAbout five minutes later, Colorado evened it up when Malinski was able to keep the puck in the zone. He took a step back and shot through the crowd to have Charles Hudon redirect it past goaltender Cal Petersen to tie it up. Halfway through the period, the Reign would rush into the Eagles zone, constantly moving the puck. Tyrell Goulbourne would then snap one from the slot to make it 3-2.\n\nAround The AHL\n\n[catlist name=AHL]\n\nThird Period\n\nColorado started to push the pace and throw more rubber on net during the third period. The Eagles would tie the game up with a power play goal only about four minutes in. Malinski started at the top of the slot and passed it to Cedric Paré. He would wrist it from the right circle with no problem to tie the game early.\n\nThe game would become even more physical (if that was possible). Paré would get lit up trying to enter the Ontario zone, but Keaton Middleton had something to say about it. He jumped right on the Ontario player and gave him a few shoves. Later on, Aidan Dudas gave Ryan Wagner a few pokes and they immediately dropped mitts. Despite the increased physicality, the game remained tied at 2-2 at the end of regulation.\n\nOvertime\n\nOntario had the puck for most of the overtime and there were a few moments that frightened Eagles fans. A shot by Ontario hit Annunen, rolled up his shoulder, and bounced to the top of the net and over. You could literally hear the arena take a breath in and hold it.\n\nJust a minute or so later, the Reign would get a shot in the slot and hit the post. The puck dribbled to the neutral zone without being able to get true control. Suddenly, it was kicked up to Rydahl for a breakaway and wrister to the back bar. The Eagles would win in overtime, 3-2.\n\nConclusion\n\nColorado’s special teams made the difference Wednesday night. They were one-for-one on the power play and killed all four power plays that Ontario had. The only thing that the Eagles could have improved on would be the dump and chase. They were doing the same thing that the Avalanche did in their first playoff game and it didn’t work for either team. Once the Eagles realized they needed to shoot from the blue line or carry it in, things started to click. Colorado’s passing was sloppy to start. Then, it came together, and you could tell the team was calming down."
