        "text": "In their final game of the season and the last for Coach Roy Sommer in his career, the San Diego Gulls looked to end things on a high note.\n\nWith Chase De Leo now confirmed as injured the Gulls went with the exact same line-up as the night before with Calle Clang surprisingly given the back to back start.\n\nFirst Period:\n\nDespite being awarded a Power Play earlier the Eagles took control early and piled on shots via the Hudon line.\n\nThe Gulls were able to hang with the Eagles but as the physicality picked up were drawn into penalty trouble as Drew Helleson was called for high sticking just after the midway point before the infraction was matched by the Eagles veteran Alex Galchenyuk for tripping.\n\nWhile skating at four on four the home team struck first – using the additional space to execute on the rush, beating Clang from the slot on a passing play that had the Gulls back-checkers looking incredibly ordinary.\n\nA few minutes later Michael Del Zotto appeared to have had enough of the one-sided physicality and took matters into his own hands – picking up consecutive minors for both interference and roughing in an encounter with Eagles leading scorer Charles Hudon.\n\nA minute into the resulting man advantage the Eagles punished him for the emotional outburst via a Player Goal for newly signed Ryan Sandelin. 2-0 Eagles.\n\nSan Diego down 2-0 after the first period and trailing in shots 12-5.\n\nSecond Period: Colorado Eagles 2 – San Diego Gulls 0\n\nGroundhog day was in full effect as much like yesterdays action the Gulls took control at five on five and piled on the shots throughout much of the second period.\n\nWith the Eagles gaining the odd foray into the San Diego zone it was one such intrusion that resulted in a 3-0 lead as the Gulls left the Eagles danger-man Charles Hudon alone in the slot at their own peril. 3-0 Eagles.\n\nSan Diego came back with a push and looked good retrieving loose pucks while attempting perimeter shots through traffic but the Eagles also did a stellar job of using those layers to prevent shots getting on net.\n\nOnce again the Gulls taking a multi goal deficit to the second intermission but leading in shots on the period 11-7 with an overall shot total of 19-16 to Colorado.\n\nThird Period: Colorado Eagles 3 – San Diego Gulls 0\n\nThe third was again much the same as yesterdays affair – with the Eagles clogging the neutral zone and daring the Gulls to try gain a footing in their end by running the gauntlet.\n\nWith time winding down in the game and my eyes starting to droop once again for the extremely joyless hockey the Eagles are so well known for a rare shining star appeared in the form of Jacob Perreault making an individual effort to go behind the Colorado net and flick the puck all in one motion into the top corner on his backhand from a severe angle. 3-1 Eagles.\n\nThat was essentially a microcosm of the Gulls season as the very brief moment of triumph was short lived and they eventually went down 3-1 to the Eagles in the final game of the season of another terrible year.\n\nPost Game Notes:\n\nAndy still AWOL\n\nI hope we find out soon what the story is with Andy Zilch missing the last four games of the season. Again I don’t want to speculate but I will say that the replacement was terrible. Seagulls? Boo Gruel? Josh Perreault? Could they not get Craig Elsten back? Having this mystery hanging over the end of this season is not a great feeling heading into next year – I really hope Andy is still here next season.\n\nPerreault fashionably late\n\nWhere was that Jacob Perreault for the rest of this season? That is all he had to do on a regular basis and what I have been writing about him needing to do over and over and over again. Shoot. The. Puck.\n\nYes that was a magical shot and the circumstances may have been one of those unrepeatable unicorn moments but at the same time – he took the shot. That is all he had to do and all he should ever be doing. That is essentially the only positive I am taking out of this game going into next season – that and Clang was given the back to back start indicating the net is essentially his to lose in the fall.\n\nSo long but not goodbye\n\nThe season may be over but keep an eye on here! Given how exciting the group of kids coming through next season I plan to finally get my podcast going on a regular basis, please give it a follow! I will have the following coming over the next few months for your reading pleasure!\n\nEnd of season grades\n\nFA list/under contract/how next years roster could look\n\nGoaltenders breakdown (requested via Twitter)\n\nWhy were the Gulls so bad this year (if I get time)\n\nCoach search and any updates I get\n\nLikely graduates (Perreault, Tracey, Groulx and Helleson focus)"
