        "text": "The New York Rangers roster will be down two more players after last night’s exhibition loss to the Boston Bruins.\n\nGustav Rydahl and Jonny Brodzinski will trim the roster down to 26 players come tomorrow afternoon.\n\nRydahl, who does not need to clear waivers was assigned to the Hartford Wolf Pack on Thursday. Brodzinski is on waivers and will be sent down once he clears to resume being captain of the Rangers’ AHL affiliate.\n\nNew York Rangers assign Gustav Rydahl to Wolf Pack\n\nRydahl, 28, signed a one-year, one-way contract over the summer as a free agent out of the SHL. The fact that he’s waivers exempt played a key role in why he was sent down.\n\n“We liked everything he brought,” Gerard Gallant said via Vince Mercogliano. “For a guy we didn’t know at all, I was very impressed with him. He might be a guy that’s going to see some time up here.”\n\nIn his four preseason contests, he registered an assist and picked up two shots. Last season for Färjestad BK of the Swedish Hockey League, he recorded 15 goals and 15 assists for 30 points.\n\n“This is what I have always wanted,” he said. “I got a really good feeling from the Rangers before I signed with them and now I am getting such good support from the players and staff.“I’m working hard to play the body and make plays. I knew it was going to be tough. But I’m doing everything I can and putting 100 percent of myself into it.”\n\nNY Post\n\nBrodzinski, 29, played in two preseason games and register no points on 6 shots. Last season, he played 22 games for the Blueshirts picking up a goal and an assist.\n\nNew York Rangers training camp roster\n\nPer the Rangers Press Release the remaining players at camp are as follows:\n\nForwards (16): Sammy Blais, Jonny Brodzinski*, Ryan Carpenter, Filip Chytil, Julien Gauthier, Barclay Goodrow, Dryden Hunt, Kaapo Kakko, Vitali Kravtsov, Chris Kreider, Alexis Lafrenière, Artemi Panarin, Ryan Reaves, Vincent Trocheck, Jimmy Vesey, Mika Zibanejad\n\nDefensemen (9): Matt Bartkowski, Adam Fox, Libor Hajek, Zac Jones, Ryan Lindgren, K’Andre Miller, Braden Schneider, Jarred Tinordi, Jacob Trouba\n\nGoaltenders (2): Jaroslav Halak, Igor Shesterkin\n\n*Brodzinski is on waivers for the purpose of assignment to the Wolf Pack.\n\nThe New York Rangers last preseason game is Saturday night against the New York Islanders.\n\nNHL DIVISION PREVIEWS\n\nMETROPOLITAN DIVISION PREVIEW.
