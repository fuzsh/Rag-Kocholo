        "text": "By: The New York Rangers\n\nNew York, NY â€“ New York Rangers President and General Manager Chris Drury announced today that the team has agreed to terms with defenseman Brandon Scanlin on a one-year contract.\n\nScanlin, 24, tallied four goals and 11 assists for 15 points and a plus-21 rating in 61 games with the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2022-23. He added an additional assist in nine playoff games for the Wolf Pack.\n\nIn a combined 76 contests over parts of two seasons in Hartford, Scanlin has notched four goals and 12 assists for 16 points and a plus-20 rating.\n\nPERSONAL HISTORY\n\nThe Rangers signed the Hamilton, Ontario native after a successful career at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, where he accumulated 11 goals and 51 assists for 62 points in 98 games stretched over three seasons. In his final season, he registered six goals and 25 assists for 31 points in 38 games, ranking tied for second among NCAA defensemen in assists and tied for sixth in points. 2020-21, Scanlin was named to the Honorable Mention All-NCHC Team, and in 2019-20, he was named to the NCHC All-Rookie Team.\n\nBefore playing at the college level, Scanlin played two seasons for the Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), where he registered 84 points (24G-60A) in 98 games. In 2018-19, he helped guide the Bandits to an AJHL championship and, later, a victory in the Canadian Junior A National Championship game.\n\nNEW YORK RANGERS\n\nHOME"
