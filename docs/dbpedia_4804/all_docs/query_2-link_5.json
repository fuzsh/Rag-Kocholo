        "text": "Lämnar Färjestad efter guldet – flyttar till NHL\n\nKARLSTAD. NHL-flytten har det ryktats om under stora delar av säsongen. Nu är den klar. Enligt uppgifter till SportExpressen har en av guldhjältarna i Färjestad, Gustav Rydahl nu bestämt sig. Han spelar nästa säsong för New York Rangers. – Nej, det kommer sen, säger Rydahl.\n\nGustav Rydahl to the New York Rangers after the Swedish Championship gold\n\nKARLSTAD. The NHL move has been rumored for much of the season.\n\nNow it's ready.\n\nAccording to information to SportExpressen, one of the gold heroes in Färjestad, Gustav Rydahl, has now made up his mind.\n\nHe will play next season for the New York Rangers.\n\n- No, it will come later, says Rydahl.\n\nText Johan Svensson, Hugo Höglund\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nAlready after the 2019-2020 season, there was talk of an NHL move for the now 27-year-old center.\n\nBut then he chose to nob the NHL offers and stay in Färjestad.\n\nFBK also chose to extend the contract and give Rydahl an increased salary. Then came a long-term injury, which meant that he played only nine games the season after.\n\nBut he has fought back and is now coming from perhaps his best season of his career. Leading player for Färjestad, Olympic games and one of the team's best scoring players during the Swedish Championship play-offs.\n\nNow the career goes on.\n\nI like these signings, especially if there looks to be some developing offence when they're playing over there. You never know when the next Panarin might show up !!\n\nOr the next Zuccarello and we need all the help at center ice. Has some grit. even if he is a 4th like PK faceoff guy those are still value. Physical player too. wish he was a little younger."
