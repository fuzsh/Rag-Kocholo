        "text": "Jesper Olofsson, older brother of Buffalo Sabres forward Victor Olofsson, has signed a one-year AHL deal with the Rochester Americans. The team announced the deal on Wednesday afternoon, just one day after reports surfaced that the Sabres were interested in or close to signing the winger.\n\nOlofsson, 28, spent this past season with Färjestad BK in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL). In his second season with the team, he recorded 28 points in 44 games. Olofsson finished the season seventh on the team in scoring, but his 17 goals were tied for second-most, behind only center Gustav Rydahl.\n\nHis final game before this season ended was a five-goal performance in a 7-4 victory for his team on March 12. Check out the highlights:\n\nOlofsson has appeared with several SHL teams over the years, including MODO Hockey, Karlskrona HK and Skellefteå AIK. He’s recorded 125 points in 254 games in the league dating back to 2010, although he’s also played elsewhere – including in Denmark – since then.\n\nThe below video is a few years old – it’s from the 2015-16 season – but still gives a glance at what Oloffson is capable of.\n\nBy signing him to an AHL contract, the Sabres aren’t using an NHL contract on the developing forward but will give him an opportunity to come over to North America and get his feet wet in Rochester.\n\nThe brothers have never played together professionally over the course of their careers, but perhaps they’ll get the chance sooner rather than later. If nothing else, this will bring their living situations much closer.\n\nVictor and Jesper’s father, Tony, played for a handful of seasons in the SHL and Division 1 hockey in Sweden between 1988 and 2002."
