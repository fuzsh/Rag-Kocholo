        "text": "The Rangers announced on Thursday morning that theyâ€™ve agreed to terms with forward Anton Blidh on a two-year contract extension.\n\nNew York acquired Blidh from the Colorado Avalanche back on March 3 in exchange for fellow AHL forward Gustav Rydahl.\n\nBlidh never appeared with the big-league team, but he played well for the Hartford Wolf Pack down in the AHL.\n\nThe winger recorded seven goals and four assists across 17 regular season games. He carried that success over to the Calder Cup Playoffs, where he posted two goals and five assists, finishing third on the team in points and assists.\n\nBetween the Avalanche and Boston Bruins, Blidh has appeared in 84 games at the NHL level in his career. He's recorded four goals and eight assists over that span for a total of 12 points.\n\nThe 28-year-old has 111 points (59 goals and 52 assists) in 331 career AHL games."
