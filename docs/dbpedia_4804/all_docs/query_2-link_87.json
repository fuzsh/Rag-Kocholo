        "text": "Heading into the preseason, we knew the major training camp competitions would be at 3LD and 4C, with a lesser competition at 3LW. The 3LW spot was always open, but the Rangers seemed to have multiple bodies on the roster lined up for that spot. But now Jimmy Vesey and Brennan Othmann have made that Rangers bottom six battle perhaps the most interesting training camp competition this year.\n\nHeading into camp, we perceived the Rangers bottom six battle, at least at 3LW, to be between Alexis Lafreniere, Sammy Blais, or Barclay Goodrow. This all was dependent on how the top six played out. It made logical sense that the odd man out from the top six would go to the third line with Filip Chytil and one of Kaapo Kakko or Vitali Kravtsov. In fact, the kid line was the third line to start camp.\n\nVesey was an afterthought on a PTO, and Othmann, despite the hype and obvious talent, was likely headed back to the OHL. There’s no need to rush him, after all. One game changed that.\n\nOne game also changed how Gustav Rydahl was viewed. That’s less about Rydahl and more that he was a big unknown to most fans as a 28 year old career SHLer. But now he’s inserted himself into the 4C discussion.\n\nRangers bottom six battle changed after last night’s win\n\nThe Rangers bottom six battle completely changed overnight, with one very strong game from Vesey and Othmann. Vesey looked good and scored from a sharp angle. Othmann had a pair of assists and was noticeable all over the ice. Vesey is a known entity, capable of playing PK minutes and a bottom six role. Othmann has a huge ceiling, and was used on the PK last night.\n\nAll of a sudden, things aren’t so clear. Could Vesey actually break camp with the Rangers? It seemed like a longshot two days ago. Now, not so much. Goodrow’s injury to start camp is also throwing a wrench into all the plans and predictions from the offseason, as we don’t know where Gerard Gallant pictures Goodrow playing.\n\nOthmann, as great as he’s been in camp and last night, is still likely to be a victim of the numbers game. He may, and most likely will, outplay a good number of guys in the Rangers bottom six battle. But Othmann is 19, can’t go to the AHL, and will have his ELC slide a year if he doesn’t play 10 NHL games. The Rangers need cap space and need to be shrewd about it, thus delaying Othmann’s arbitration clock is a smart move.\n\nWhat is the ideal scenario?\n\nThe Rangers bottom six battle will certainly give them options and depth. Even if (when?) Othmann gets returned to the OHL, the Rangers will have options. Ideally though, the third line plays out as a scoring line, with the fourth line serving as a shutdown line.\n\nAddressing the fourth line first, as a shutdown line, the ideal line is Goodrow and Dryden Hunt flanking one of Rydahl or Ryan Carpenter. Ryan Reaves would join Rydahl or Carpenter as the 13/14F. This also seems to be where the Rangers are going, with Rydahl and Reaves playing together last night with Bobby Trivigno. Trivigno played well enough to get more looks, but he also seems to be a victim of the numbers game for now.\n\nIf that’s how the fourth line shakes out, and if we assume that Lafreniere will stick in the top six, then the third line will have multiple players vying for one spot. Blais, Vesey, and Othmann are the main guys in the Rangers bottom six battle for now. Maybe Julien Gauthier too?\n\nIt would certainly behoove the Rangers to keep more than 2 depth forwards in the organization, especially considering the drop off once you get to the on-ice play (Reaves). What seems more likely is the Rangers won’t have any of these battles truly settled until injuries and regular season games start happening. We may not see a “final” Rangers lineup until December."
