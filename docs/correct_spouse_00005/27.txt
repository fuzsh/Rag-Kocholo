Classic Celebrity Quote

"Three years ago, back before I was pregnant, I never thought I'd be married now. I was scared because a lot of people who marry young end up divorcing within a year. My mom and dad married, divorced, remarried and divorced again. I don't want my girls to have to go through that. My mom talked to me because she first wed at sixteen and didn't want me to go through a divorce like she did."
