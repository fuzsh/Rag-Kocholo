        "text": "For a ‘90s teen show, Dawson’s Creek featured a lot of future stars: James Van Der Beek has made a second career out of self-referential roles, Katie Holmes weathered a high-profile marriage to Tom Cruise, Joshua Jackson is steaming up the Showtime drama The Affair, and Michelle Williams has racked up four Oscar nominations. But what about Kerr Smith, who played Jack McPhee for five seasons on the WB drama? Where’s he these days?\n\nTurns out, Kerr has been working steadily on TV. You may have seen him on Freeform’s The Fosters, for example (he plays Robert Quinn, Callie’s biological father). If not, you might be surprised to find out that the 45-year-old is a total silver fox now!\n\nElsewhere on the TV dial, Kerr has popped up in recurring roles on Charmed, NCIS, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Doubt. He also starred in The CW’s two-season drama _Life Unexpected _alongside fellow WB alum Shiri Appleby. (As for his own “life unexpected,” Kerr married actor Harmoni Everett in 2003, but they divorced in 2009.)\n\nAside from those roles, the Pennsylvania native does boast a couple other claims to fame. He was the last person to be Punk’d by Ashton Kutcher’s MTV hidden-camera show, for example. Even more impressively, he was one half of TV’s first gay male kiss, when Jack smooched boyfriend Ethan on a 2000 episode of Dawson’s Creek."
