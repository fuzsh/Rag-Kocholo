        "text": "_\n\nIt feels like just yesterday we were checking in on the dramatic personal lives of our favorite Capeside teens on \"Dawson's Creek.\" The hit series didn't just introduce us to some of the greatest characters in the history of soapy teen melodrama — it also helped usher many of its fans from the awkward teenage years to full-fledged adulthood. Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jen became our friends, and now the actors and actresses who played them are among Hollywood's biggest stars. In honor of the 25th anniversary of the show's premiere on Jan. 20, 2023, Wonderwall.com is taking a look back at what the main and supporting cast is up to now.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about what they've been doing since \"Dawson's Creek\" came to an end in 2003…\n\nMORE: \"Smallville\" cast: Where are they now?\n\n_\n\nKatie Holmes almost passed on the role that made her a star: The Ohio native refused to drop out of her high school production of \"Damn Yankees\" to audition in person for The WB. Fortunately, the network allowed the aspiring model and actress to audition via videotape for girl-next-door Joey Potter. With only a role in Ang Lee's \"The Ice Storm\" under her belt, Katie won the part — and the title of America's sweetheart.\n\nMORE: Stars with their kids in 2023\n\n_\n\nKatie Holmes matured from America's Sweetheart to leading lady. The actress has had a string of prominent film roles in projects including \"Pieces of April\" in 2003, Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" in 2005, the comedy satire \"Thank You for Smoking\" in 2006 and the horror film \"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\" in 2011. She received worldwide attention when she welcomed a daughter, Suri Cruise, and married Tom Cruise in 2006. The super-couple, known as TomKat, divorced in 2012 after five years of marriage. Katie has since appeared in high-profile projects such as the TV miniseries \"The Kennedys\" and the acclaimed Showtime series \"Ray Donovan.\" In 2016, she made her directorial debut with \"All We Had,\" in which she also starred. She also starred in, wrote and directed 2022's \"Alone Together.\" She was in a long, low-key relationship with Jamie Foxx from 2013 to 2019 and dated New York City chef Emilio Vitolo Jr. in 2020 and early 2021. In 2022, Katie romanced composer, producer and instrumentalist Bobby Wooten III.\n\nMORE: Shocking photos of Jamie Lynn Spears when she was young\n\n_\n\nMichelle Williams started her career as a tween appearing in small television roles. At 14, she made her feature film debut in \"Lassie.\" The next year, the aspiring actress graduated early from high school and became legally emancipated from her parents as a way of getting around child labor laws so that she could more fully focus on her career. The hard work at an early age paid off: Michelle booked the part of reformed New York City party girl Jen Lindley on \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\n_\n\nMichelle Williams went from \"Dawson's Creek\" to Academy Award nominations and Golden Globe wins! The actress has starred in a number of critically acclaimed films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Blue Valentine\" and \"Manchester by the Sea,\" earning Oscar nominations for all three movies. For portraying the actress Marilyn Monroe in \"My Week with Marilyn\" in 2011, Michelle won a best actress Globe. She also starred in Martin Scorsese's thriller \"Shutter Island,\" the fantasy film \"Oz the Great and Powerful,\" the musical \"The Greatest Showman,\" the superhero flick \"Venom\" and its sequel as well as, more recently, Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical film \"The Fablemans\" in 2022. In 2019, Michelle starred in the FX biographical miniseries \"Fosse/Verdon,\" for which she earned an Emmy and Globe in 2020. The Montana native began dating Heath Ledger in 2004 and they welcomed daughter Matilda in 2005 before calling it quits in 2007. Heath died of an accidental drug overdose just a few months later in early 2008, leading to increased media attention for Michelle, which she actively avoided. After dating boldface names including Jason Segel and Spike Jonze, the actress surprised fans when she secretly married indie musician Phil Elverum, a widowed father of one, in 2018, but it was over by 2019. Eight months after their split, it was revealed that Michelle was pregnant and engaged to \"Hamilton\" and \"Fosse/Verdon\" director Thomas Kail. The pair, who secretly wed in 2020, welcomed their first child together the same year. Their second child was born in 2022.\n\n_\n\nA 20-year-old James Van Der Beek had just a few credits on his resume when he scored the lead role of high school student and aspiring film director Dawson Leery. James dropped out of Drew University, where he was studying English, to pursue his acting career. And the rest, as they say, is history!\n\n_\n\nSince \"Dawson's Creek\" wrapped, James Van Der Beek has been steadily working. He took his talents to the big screen, starring in \"Varsity Blues\" and \"The Rules of Attraction,\" but is still best known for his television work. James played leading characters on hit TV shows such as \"Don't Trust the B**** In Apartment 23\" and \"CSI: Cyber.\" In 2018, he starred on Ryan Murphy's FX series \"Pose.\" He was also a contestant on the 28th contestant of \"Dancing With the Stars\" in 2019. James found success in his personal life after divorcing his first wife, actress Heather McComb. He married Kimberly Brook in 2010. The couple have since welcomed six children and moved to Texas.\n\n_\n\nJoshua Jackson started his career as a child star thanks in part to his casting director mom. The Canadian actor had already amassed a small cult following from his days starring as adolescent hockey player Charlie Conway in the \"Mighty Ducks\" trilogy when he was cast as Dawson's BFF, class clown Pacey Witter.\n\n_\n\nJoshua Jackson has maintained a low profile since his \"Dawson's Creek\" days but is still a successful working actor. He starred in projects including \"Bobby\" and \"Fringe\" after \"Dawson's Creek\" wrapped. From 2014 to 2018, he was a series regular on Showtime's Golden Globe-winning series \"The Affair\" and appeared on Hulu's \"Little Fires Everywhere\" in 2020. In 2021, he starred on the first season of the Peacock crime-drama series \"Dr. Death,\" which is based on the podcast of the same name. Josh previously made headlines for his high-profile 10-year relationship with actress Diane Kruger. In 2019, he married actress Jodie Turner-Smith, whom he began dating in 2018. They welcomed a daughter in 2020.\n\n_\n\nBusy Philipps already had one of pop culture's most beloved cult series (\"Freaks and Geeks\") under her belt when she joined \"Dawson's Creek\" as Audrey Liddell, Joey's college roommate with a drinking problem, during the fifth season in 2001. Before she took on the role, the actress studied at Loyola Marymount University, where she dated actor Colin Hanks.\n\n_\n\nBusy Philipps is still enjoying a successful career after taking leading roles in \"White Chicks,\" \"Made of Honor,\" \"He's Just Not That Into You,\" \"The Gift,\" and, more recently, 2018's \"I Feel Pretty.\" She also starred on the TV series \"Cougar Town,\" for which she won a Critics' Choice Television Award for best supporting actress, and HBO's cult hit \"Vice Principals.\" Since 2021, she's starred on Peacock's musical-comedy series \"Girls5eva.\" The Illinois native wed screenwriter Marc Silverstein in 2007 and the pair welcomed kids in 2008 and 2013; in 2022, Busy announced they'd separated a year earlier. She's still best friends with \"Dawson's Creek\" co-star Michelle Williams today.\n\n_\n\nAfter attending the University of Vermont, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration, Kerr Smith got a late start in the acting game when he booked his first gig on \"As the World Turns\" at age 24. Kerr appeared on the soap for a year and a half before joining the second season of \"Dawson's Creek\" as Jack McPhee, the shy guy struggling with his sexuality. Kerr went on to make television history in the third season of \"Dawson's Creek\" when his character shared a passionate kiss with another male: It was the first time a kiss between two men was aired on network television in the U.S.\n\n_\n\nKerr Smith has enjoyed a string of guest roles on hit TV shows such as \"CSI: NY,\" \"Life Unexpected\" and \"NCIS\" since wrapping \"Dawson's Creek.\" In addition to landing a recurring role on Freeform's \"The Fosters\" from 2014 to 2018, he popped up on episodes of The CW's \"Riverdale\" from 2019 to 2020. In 2021, he appeared in three episodes of FOX's \"The Resident.\" He also runs a holistic health and wellness business, TerraLife Wellness, with his second wife, Lisa. Kerr was married to actress Harmoni Everett from 2003 to 2009.\n\n_\n\nThe oldest member of the \"Creek\" crew, Meredith Monroe, was almost 30 when she joined the second season of the series along with Kerr Smith as his mentally unstable sister, Andie McPhee. Like her on-screen brother, Meredith got a late start in the business, launching her career with various small roles in the year before she booked \"Dawson's.\" Before that, the Houston native attended Millikin University and was a cover model for several Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys books.\n\n_\n\nPost-\"Dawson's Creek,\" Meredith Monroe established her career as a television actress with guest spots on popular shows such as \"Californication,\" \"NCIS,\" \"Psych,\" \"The Closer,\" \"CSI: NY,\" \"Hart of Dixie\" and \"Castle.\" The Houston native was also well known for her recurring role as Haley Hotchner on \"Criminal Minds.\" In 2016, she landed a role in the Hailee Steinfeld-led film \"The Edge of Seventeen,\" and from 2018 to 2020, she appeared on Netflix's \"13 Reasons Why.\" Meredith has reportedly been married to talent manager Steven Kavovit, with whom she had twins in 2015, since 1999.\n\n_\n\nMary Beth Peil began acting in the 1960s, starring in Broadway shows such as \"Kiss Me, Kate\" and \"The King and I,\" the latter of which earned her a Tony Award nomination. She continued to star in popular plays, shows and movies before being cast Evelyn \"Grams\" Ryan, Jen Lindley's grandmother, on \"Dawson's Creek\" in 1998.\n\n_\n\nMary Beth Peil has since returned to Broadway and the small screen. The actress starred in the Broadway adaptations of \"Nine,\" \"Follies\" and \"Anastasia,\" the last of which earned her her second Tony Award nomination in 2017. Mary Beth also memorably played Jackie Florrick, the mother of Chris Noth's politician character, on the CBS drama \"The Good Wife\" from 2009 to 2016. In 2021, she appeared on an episode of the Netflix biographical miniseries \"Halston.\" The Iowa native is a divorced mother of two and grandmother of two.\n\n_\n\nJohn Wesley Shipp starred as Barry Allen on CBS's \"The Flash\" before securing his role as Dawson's father, Mitch Leery, on \"Dawson's Creek\" in 1998.\n\n_\n\nToday, John Wesley Shipp is still a successful television actor. His career has truly come full circle as he is now starring as Barry Allen's father, Henry Allen, on The CW's reboot of \"The Flash.\" The Virginia native has also enjoyed guest appearances on \"CSI: NY,\" \"The Closer,\" \"One Life to Live,\" \"Teen Wolf,\" and, more recently, the DC superhero series \"Stargirl\" in 2022.\n\n_\n\nMary-Margaret Humes had guest roles on hit shows such as \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"Blossom\" before securing her role as Dawson's mother, Gail Leery, on \"Dawson's Creek\" in 1998."
