The action picks up right from that instant with this week's new episode (airing tonight at 9 pm/ET). Jensen Ackles, who plays Dean, shared with TVGuide.com a preview.\n\nTVGuide.com: Were you happy when Supernatural got picked up for a full season so early on?\n\nJensen Ackles: Yeah, it's always a crapshoot with the whole television thing in general, so the fact that we had a nice little buzz and had the powers-that-be pushing for us gave us the confidence we needed to move ahead and put us in the frame of mind we needed to be in for the remainder of the season.\n\nTVGuide.com: Especially since there is so much mythology to delve into. You must have been like, \"This could be a really awesome show if....\"\n\nAckles: If we get the right support and it's done right. And so far, I think everybody has made every effort they can to really get this show off and running the way we all want it to be.\n\nTVGuide.com: I have to wonder, does it get lonely being just you and Jared [Padalecki, Sam] in every damn episode? Do you corner the writers and go, \"Can't we get a bartender buddy or something?\"\n\nAckles: [Laughs] Oh, trust me. When [Warner Bros. Television president] Peter Roth and I had dinner about a month ago, he said, \"So, the show's doing really, really good, everybody's really happy.... How do you think we can make the show great?\" \"Add. More. Characters.\" is the first thing I said. [Laughs] But that's what we signed on for — we knew it would be just Jared and I, and that it would be a very demanding schedule, and it definitely has been. It hasn't let up. I think I've had one day off since July. The cool thing about it is that Jared and I really get to work hard and, in the same breath, we get to meet and see and work with new people each week. It's a new town, a whole new story, new people, so in a sense that's something kinda cool that we have that a lot of shows don't.\n\nTVGuide.com: Do you guys never film during the day, or does the show just do a great job of simulating darkness and murkiness?\n\nAckles: Everything that you see inside is generally done during the day and then, of course, our night shoots are either cheated a bit or we wait until the sun drops. But we shoot in Vancouver, where the sun goes down quite early. It will be 4:40 in the afternoon and it's dark already.\n\nTVGuide.com: I thought my ears spied Canadian accents on some of the guest stars. I was watching \"Asylum\" and that blonde girl.....\n\nAckles: What, did she throw in an aboot?\n\nTVGuide.com: Something like that. I was like, \"A-ha, I see we're shooting in Canada.\"\n\nAckles: It's funny, I've actually had to grab the script supervisor — who is Canadian, so it doesn't register to her the way it does to me — and tell her, \"You've got to watch these accents, they're starting to kick up,\" and then she'll go tell the actor. There are only a few of us who can really catch it, and if we're not around....\n\nTVGuide.com: What bogeymen are left to tackle this season? Can you tease anything about what's coming up?\n\nAckles: I know that there's some good stuff coming up with the father....\n\nTVGuide.com: At the end of \"Asylum,\" he's on the other end of the telephone.\n\nAckles: Exactly, so that's going to start becoming much more relevant. There's such a pool of these [bogeyman] stories that Erik Kripke, the writer and creator, has come up with....\n\nTVGuide.com: And you don't want to burn through them all in Season 1.\n\nAckles: And we're not, either. Erik is just this mad genius in L.A. who kind of locks himself in the writers' room and comes up with all of this awesome stuff. I have every confidence in him in the world.\n\nTVGuide.com: What did you and Jared get for a Christmas bonus? Your own '67 Chevy Impalas?\n\nAckles: [Laughs] That would have been nice! I think that's maybe the fifth season, if we get there.\n\nTVGuide.com: You got some wimpy Supernatural wall calendar, didn't you?\n\nAckles: We all got jackets and stuff... and we also got a couple of days off earlier than we were supposed to.\n\nTVGuide.com: Let's talk about your three previous extended runs on television: Dark Angel, Smallville and Dawson's Creek.\n\nAckles: I kind of felt like a bit of a pinch hitter on those shows. They were already established, and I was just kind of coming in to do whatever they needed to be done.\n\nTVGuide.com: It was almost a \"prolonged screen test\" until the day got your own show, wasn't it?\n\nAckles: Yeah, exactly. [Laughs] They were just kind of \"using and abusing\" me to make sure I could handle the pressure and the whole situation. But it was good. After Dark Angel, [Fox] made me the lead of a series called Still Life. We shot the pilot, they picked it up for seven episodes, and then they decided to shelve it. There was a big change in command, and [the new entertainment president] cleaned the slate of anything that was pending, so we got lost in the shuffle.\n\nTVGuide.com: They should put the seven episodes out on DVD, cash in on your Supernatural buzz.\n\nAckles: Hey, that'd be the smart thing to do. But who knows what the suits are thinking these days?\n\nTVGuide.com: Getting back to Supernatural, do you ever worry that Dean is too quippy? That maybe his attitude undercuts the tension?\n\nAckles: That's a very delicate balance you've got to find, because at the end of the day this is a horror show, and you really have to make it believable. To do that, you have to really be scared and you have to really react to these things. The only difference between Dean and anybody else reacting to it is that this is what he's been living, breathing, eating and sleeping for most of his life.\n\nTVGuide.com: Plus, the humor is probably a sort of coping mechanism.\n\nAckles: He's definitely got the cocky facade covering up a lot of what's going on underneath. That's a cool thing about him — he's a bit of an onion, and in each episode you start peeling layers and layers off. Sometimes I really have to think, \"OK, I'd like to make this nonchalant and funny, but I don't want to miss the point that this is a very serous issue I'm dealing with.\" It's a delicate balance.\n\nTVGuide.com: Have you ever been to the funky official Supernatural website?\n\nAckles: Yeah, that's cool as hell. I pop around in the trunk, the glove compartment....\n\nTVGuide.com: I was just there for the first time and it's crazy!\n\nAckles: It is crazy. In fact, I do these things every now and then where I'll go and record a voice-over or an outgoing [phone] message, or a message to my dad, that they'll play on the webpage. They're really going to make that an integral part of the show. I know they've set up an actual phone number and an e-mail address that are used on the show, and people are calling and leaving messages and e-mails. People at Warner Bros. are going through them. It's been a really cool response.\n\nTVGuide.com: Is your girlfriend too scared to watch the show?\n\nAckles: I'm currently a single guy, so the only women in my life are my sister and my mom, and yes, they definitely watch the show and yes, they definitely get scared!\n\n1.5.06 - Michelle Williams was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for her role in \"Brokeback Mountain.\" The 12th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony will be on January 29th, 2006, and will air live on both TNT and TBS.\n\nArnaldo Magnani/Getty Images\n\n12.19.05 - E!Online Fashion Police: Great Expectations It just wouldn't be Christmas without this heartwarming look at the winners of the 2005 Fastest Romance Contest.

Coleridge\n\nDawson's Creek graduate Kerr Smith, 32, is a bona fide hit on Charmed (Sundays, 8 pm/PT on WB). In his recurring role as Agent Kyle Brody, he's won over the witchfest's devoted fans by splitting his time between probing occult mysteries and cuddling Rose McGowan's Paige Halliwell. Will this temp go perm and stay long-term? A setside source tells TV Guide Online that Smith's expected to say buh-bye in early 2005. Let's see what the studlet himself has to say....\n\nTV Guide Online: Kerr, you've signed up for 10 episodes of Charmed. [The sixth one airs this Sunday.] Any chance you'll stay as a series regular?\n\nKerr Smith: They've actually asked me. It's something I would entertain. I love the group and it's a good show. On the other hand, it'd take me out of pilot season; that is usually January through April. It's a very difficult decision because you want to try and get your own show, but then, working on a show as good as theirs is also a really good deal.\n\nTVGO: I don't hear you saying no for sure.\n\nSmith: I guess it's still up in the air. It's a tough decision. I'd love to stay, but you've also got to move forward into the black unknown. Staying in the nice cushy job is not taking a chance.\n\nTVGO: How's life behind the scenes? We've all heard tales of backstage drama.\n\nSmith: You gotta understand, I come from the most amazing crew family on Dawson's Creek. I didn't think I'd ever have that again. [My TV sister] Meredith Monroe and I are still great friends. After getting to know everybody on Charmed, it was unbelievable. They welcomed me right into this friendly atmosphere with great working conditions. It's the kind of job you really don't want to leave  which is why, I'm sure, they've been there for seven years.\n\nTVGO: So Kyle's a federal agent who's into the supernatural. Sounds familiar...\n\nSmith: He's Fox Mulder but he's not as somber. He's more charming. But he is a mysterious FBI agent who's into the supernatural. (Chuckles)\n\nTVGO: At least your sister wasn't abducted by aliens, right?\n\nSmith: No  though you never know with this show.\n\nTVGO: You're romancing Rose McGowan on Charmed. Her ex, Marilyn Manson, must be a tough act to follow.\n\nSmith: (Snickers) A tough one, huh? Let's just keep it at a different act to follow.\n\nTVGO: Ouch! Burn. So tell us more about Rose and Kyle's budding love.\n\nSmith: At first, Rose's character got curious about my character because she didn't know if I'm a demon or an actual agent. Once she found out I'm good, we started working closely together against the big bad threat of this season, the Avatars. We've started to get too close, especially in the '30s noir episode we did in black-and-white last week.\n\nTVGO: Yeah, I wondered about that. Was life actually black-and-white in the '30s?\n\nSmith: Yeah, right. Rose and I got sucked into this magical book that was made by a couple of witches. It was a lot of fun to shoot and looks really cool. You'd think they'd run out of story lines after seven years of this crazy stuff, but they don't!\n\nTVGO: UPN didn't pick up the pilot for Silverlake, another Aaron Spelling series you were to star in.\n\nSmith: We shot it back in the spring. That's a bummer because we thought it would be picked up. It's set in the Silverlake neighborhood of L.A. Dead people came to me for guidance or advice to solve crimes and mysteries or save a loved one who's still alive.\n\nTVGO: Hmm... Sounds suspiciously similar to Fox's Tru Calling.\n\nSmith: It's similar to Tru Calling, but we made ours less serious. (Chuckles) I did say \"I see dead people\" at one point, but I didn't steal Haley Joel Osment's [style of] line reading.\n\n11.11.04 - Zap2It.com: Kerr Smith is Happy to Be a Grownup on 'Charmed' - After playing a gay teen on The WB's \"Dawson's Creek,\" Kerr Smith is happy to be playing an adult -- and having a different sort of on-screen romance....\n\n11.9.04 - TV Guide Online: Glamour girl: Katie Holmes looks red-hot in a sizzling frock at the 15th annual Glamour Women of the Year Awards.\n\n11.1.04 - Maggie Friedman is writing a new pilot for the WB. The show is a drama that, when it first made the rounds in 2002, was called Spy Girl (Warner Bros. TV/25C Prods). The project is based on Amy Grey's \"Spygirl: True Adventures from My Life as a Private Eye\" about a 20-something detective.\n\n7.7.04 - From TV Guide Online: How Katie Holmes Keeps It Real\n\nby Angel Cohn\n\nFor six seasons on Dawson's Creek, Katie Holmes played doe-eyed dreamer Joey Potter  and became America's sweetheart in the process. Since the teen sudser's swan song last year, the 25-year-old brunet's been focused on the big screen.\n\nShe's had her hits and misses: There's the critically acclaimed Pieces of April, the recently bombed First Daughter and the upcoming Batman Begins. Still, despite all the fame and fanfare, she considers herself that \"girl next door\" we all knew and loved on the Creek.\n\n\"I've been in North Carolina for six years, so I was pretty far removed from any spotlights,\" Holmes says. \"Also, I have a very influential father who constantly reminds me how much more I could do for the world and it puts it all in perspective. Whenever he thinks that perhaps I might be getting a little excited about myself, he pulls me back. So I go about my day and don't worry.\"\n\nThe down-to-earth Holmes also says her Catholic education was nothing like WB's glamorous take on high school. \"[My life] was one big, embarrassing moment,\" she laughs. \"I had a really good time. In an all-girls school, the more kind of gross you can be, the cooler you are.\n\n\"If your boxers are hanging out,\" she says, \"and your skirt is way up and just dirty, you just don't care. My friends and I are still really close, and whenever we get together on the holidays, we slip right back and talk for hours. It is a pretty great bond.\"\n\nHolmes sometimes wonders if eschewing college for an acting career was the right move. \"I have asked my good friends, who went off to college when I went to do Dawson's Creek, 'Did I miss a lot? I feel like I'm socially a little bit behind.' They are like, 'It wasn't your path. Get over it. You didn't miss much. I got drunk for four years.'\n\n\"They are very frank,\" she smirks. \"In some ways, I think [college] would have been nice, but I'm thankful for the way my life turned out, so I can't really say that I regret anything. I know if I do go back [to school], it will be completely different for me, but that's okay.\"\n\n8.31.04 - Kerr Smith will be joining the cast of Charmed as a love interest for Paige, the character played by Rose McGowan. Smith's character will be a homeland-security agent who believes in the supernature, a sort of Fox Mulder from The X-Files. Smith will debut on the show in October.\n\n8.19.04 - Kristin at E!Online reports that Katie Holmes was seen at the House of Blues with her \"Batman Begins\" co-start Christian Bale. They were there for a country concert, and Bale tried to get her to two-step, but apparently she's not so much the rhythm queen.\n\n7.7.04 - From TV Guide Online: Looking stylish during Paris' fashion week was just a walk in the park for actress Katie Holmes. -->\n\n4.15.04 - Kristin at E!Online reports that Pacey's Back! Glamour held its celeb-studded \"Don't\" party this week at the hottest Hollywood hot spot with hot sauce--Del Taco. Our too-faboo Hollywood Party Girl, Lara Morgenson, will bring you more details next week, but for now, I must share with you this case of heartthrob heartburn: I saw Pacey Whitter. (Or Josh Jackson, if you really must call him that.)\n\nFirst things first: He was there with Eve. You remember, Brittany Daniel, who played Dawson's love interest for a few episodes. I hear the former Capeside flames may be rekindling some kind of romance. (And just to set the record straight, Jackson tells me the report in Us Weekly that he's expecting a baby with his former girlfriend is \"not true.\")\n\nThe party marked Jackson's first appearance at such an Industry party in years; perhaps he's stepping out now because he has an indie flick coming out. Or quite possibly because he's no longer swarmed by shrieking girls. \"When I get recognized now,\" he says, \"it's more like, 'Didn't I go to high school with you?' And I think, 'In a way, yes.'\"\n\nJ.J. tells me he has kept in touch with all of his castmates: \"After six years, we're like family.\" But he advises against holding our breath for a reunion special. \"I think the final episode accomplished that,\" he says. \"It was a finale and a reunion all at the same time. However, in 20 years, if I'm bitter and unemployed and have completely lost any sense of self worth? Maybe. It'd be like, 'Who stole my dentures?' So, it might not be so sexy.\"\n\n3.31.04 - Kerr Smith has taken the lead in UPN's drama presentation \"Silver Lake,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter. He'll play a record-store owner in the L.A. hipster enclave of the title who can communicate with the dead.

Fresh-faced Klein looks every square inch the leading man in a three-button slim-cut slate Hugo Boss suit with a khaki shirt and striped tie. And check out the duo's matching dimples! Jeez, these kids are so wholesome we're getting a major sugar rush. Somebody pass the insulin!\n\n10.8.03 - Ted Casablanca at E!Online reports that Katie Holmes and Chris Klein were spotted doing the sweaty-palm date thang at the AMC Century City Theaters. Lost in Translation, 2:15 p.m. Looking snuggly as they watched the preview for K.H.'s upcoming flick Pieces of April, the cozy duo was playing it low-key. Katie was quietly luscious in low-rise jeans and an olive tank top, while cool Chris was clad in jeans and a gray tee. Afterward, the darlings got all kissy-face on the escalator down to the parking garage. Think her Dawson's Creek dude would've been jealous? Doubt it, since...\n\nJoshua Jackson was busy stuffing his face full of pancakes. The Griddle Café Sunset and Fairfax. Chattering nonstop while shoveling in the breakfast grub, Mr. J. was looking nasty, though totally humpable. Sporting his best fresh-from-the-sack look with puffy, bed-head hair, rumpled jeans and a short-sleeved striped shirt, J-squared was joined by guy 'n' gal pals.\n\n10.6.03 - TV Guide Online: Katie Holmes Fashion Scare!\n\nFor six seasons on Dawson's Creek, Katie Holmes was America's sweetheart, the WB's dream girl next door. Well, forget Miss Joey Potter, kids. As the title character in Pieces of April  in limited release Oct. 17  she's more like the foul-tempered skank next door!\n\nApril's talented cast of kooks includes Patricia Clarkson, Sean Hayes and Oliver Platt. The sitch: A Thanksgiving Day in the life of April, a rebellious twentysomething who's trying to cook dinner for her estranged family. For the role, Holmes streaked her brunette locks with hot pink, painted her nails black and wore funky punk clothes and Goth jewelry. Yuck! Has April seen too many Pink videos or what?\n\n\"April is not what she seems,\" Holmes tells TV Guide Online. \"Her whole look is very strong in its message. It gives off an 'I don't give a s---' attitude, but really she can be very caring. I give a lot of credit to wardrobe, makeup and hair. I have friends who are very cool and edgy and can get away with a look like that. But I put that stuff on, and I feel like a dork.\n\n\"I don't think I could pull it off in real life,\" she laughs. \"Katie is all about jeans and a T-shirt and whatever's clean, really.\"\n\nHow's life after the Creek for Holmes, who's now focused on a film career? \"I'm excited about it,\" the 24-year-old says. \"It's kind of a reality check when you're used to doing something for six years, and then suddenly, it's over. You're back to what feels like square one. You have to go out and keep auditioning and you don't have that safety net [of having a TV job] to land in.\n\n\"I feel a definite void in my life, because we are all so close,\" she says, thinking of her Creek castmates. \"I think this whole first year after the show will be filled with odd feelings because it's a huge change. At the same time, it's really thrilling and freeing. It's nice to be starting a new chapter.\"\n\n10.6.03 - Don't miss Katie Holmes in the new movie \"Pieces of April,\" in theaters October 17th.\n\n9.19.03 - E!Online Out & About: Katie Holmes and Chris Klein prove that the couples who play together, stay together.\n\n9.15.03 - From TV Guide Online: Remember Meredith Monroe from Dawson's Creek? She spent two-and-a-half years on the teen soap as neurotic good girl Andie McPhee. This year, ABC sent TV journalists the pilot for its new fall sitcom Married to the Kellys, starring Monroe as Breckin Meyer's new bride, who drags her New Yorker hubby home to Kansas to live near her tight-knit family. Later, ABC gave her role to Kiele Sanchez from That Was Then, a sitcom it axed last year. But why?\n\n\"Yes, I got replaced,\" Monroe tells TV Guide Online. \"I don't know why. We heard so many different things. Ultimately, they said they weren't 100 percent sure that Breckin and I were the right match. One of the things I heard was that I seemed more like the New Yorker and he seemed more like the Midwesterner, and it's supposed to be the reverse. I'm from the Midwest, so who knows?\n\n\"But I heard lots of other people [at ABC and 20th Century Fox] loved us together,\" the 25-year-old adds. \"Who knows what the real story is. Tom Hertz, who's the executive producer, called me personally and said, 'We loved you. We would've loved to make it work. Hopefully, we'll work together somewhere down the road.' So I think, 'Great! Start writing me my own series!'\n\n\"I enjoyed trying my first sitcom,\" she says cheerily. \"It was all good. Maybe it just wasn't meant to be.\"\n\nMonroe can currently be seen in The Year That Trembled, an indie film in limited release. Fred Willard and SeaQuest DSV's Jonathan Brandis co-star in this fictional tale, based on the 1970 tragedy at Kent State University, where student activists were killed during a Vietnam War protest. \"I didn't know much about it,\" the actress admits. \"So I went to the bookstore and got The Vietnam War for Dummies. Yeah, that's a real book!\"\n\n9.3.03 - From TV Guide Online: Warner Bros. and director Christopher Nolan are thisclose to settling on an actor to take over the role of the Caped Crusader in the next Batman film.

When his father died in a car accident, Dawson was thrown on an emotional roller coaster  one that he's still riding.\n\nThe young man's grief has unfolded in believable stages. First, there was blame. Dawson revealed his intention to drop out of USC and move to Boston, but a disappointed Mitch didn't accept the decision. When Mitch was killed shortly after, Dawson believed he caused the crash. He shut out loved ones and became the man of the house without showing an ounce of emotion. Why? A guilt-ridden Dawson didn't think he deserved to mourn. A breakdown eventually occurred when he discovered that his father was proud of him before passing away. Finally, Dawson was able to give in to his feelings and cry.\n\nThe death of Mitch has charted Dawson's course for the season and given the character, who had far too little to do last year, a meaty storyline. He has many decision to make (was leaving film school the right move?) and must attempt to find himself. Right now, Dawson is confused, directionless and despondent; a return to normalcy seems impossible. But grief, like growing up, is a process that must be worked through. It will be intriguing to watch Dawson try to do both things at the same time.\n\n12.4.01 - Wanda at E!Online reports that Gilmore Girls is working to get Chad Michael Murray (Tristin) back for one or two more episodes later in the season, but it really depends on what goes down with yet another WB show craving his God-like goldilocks.

Cirmo told Newsweek that if the FRC ran TV, \"We definitely wouldn't want to glorify the [gay] lifestyle. Every program that has a homosexual character in the show, he or she is often the most stable character. He or she is not promiscuous or entangled in a bad relationship most of the time. A lot of times, he or she is the most comedic person. That's kind of strange.\" (Note from TK: what's strange about that?)\n\n5.8.01 - TV Guide Online: The Forsaken's Gay Subtext - Though he's straight offscreen, there's no denying that playing gay has made Kerr Smith's acting career thus far...\n\n5.4.01 - Summer plans for the WB include a movie on either Tuesday or Wednesday night with movies borrowed from TBS.

The 5th annual Prism awards, hosted by Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis, were taped April 4th. No word yet when or where they will air.\n\n3.1.01 - Don't miss the article on Kerr Smith in this month's Out magazine.\n\n2.20.01 - Soap Opera Digest has a bit of a problem with a recent \"Dawson's Creek\" scene. It's been established that: 1) Pacey, Joey and Dawson grew up together, and 2) Joey dines with Pacey's family, the Witters, every Sunday. So at Pacey's surprise birthday party, why did Mrs. Witter act like she didn't know Joey very well, calling her by the wrong name not once, but twice? (This from the woman who phoned Joey to ask for help planning the fete.) It seemed like the writers wanted to show how out of touch Mrs. Witter is with her son's life, but instead it just left us shaking our heads.\n\n2.20.01 - Mark Matkevich (Drue) has been made a contract player on \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\n2.20.01 - Look for Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes on the cover of Soap Opera Weekly.\n\n2.12.01 - From the February 13th issue of Soap Opera Digest: Dawson's Creek surges forward this week with a series of super-eventful February sweeps episodes (Joey and Pacey attend the class ski trip; Dawson remains at home wrestling with whether to remove his dying mentor from life support). But as the fourth season of the popular program heads toward a graduation ending, is there life after high school for Creek's citizens?\n\nOnline speculation from fans has placed some or all of the primary characters heading off to college next year in the same town (likely Boston, which is nearest to the fictional Capeside). According to Executive Producer Paul Stupin, fans aren't the only ones thinking about the future. \"We've given it a lot of thought. In our minds, we know where we're going next season. But our discussions have been very general because clearly, we're still in the midst of focusing on all of the specifics and all of the twists and turns of the second half of this year.\"\n\nTwists and turns that will keep fans guessing. Teases Stupin, \"This is their senior year. All of them are looking not only at their present, but also at their future.\"\n\nSpeaking of which, so far Stupin won't confirm that Creek will even have a season five. \"We haven't been officially picked up, but I'm certainly hopeful and optimistic. We're pretty confident. I mean, we're doing well this year, so knock on wood, things will be in good shape.\"\n\n1.29.01 - The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) today announced the nominees for its 12th Annual GLAAD Media Awards presented by ABSOLUT VODKA.
