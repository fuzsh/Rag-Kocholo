        "text": "Singer/songwriter and producer Caitlyn Smith goes independent with the release of “Static,” a soothing balm for those of us who feel a little lost.\n\nfollow our Today’s Song(s) playlist\n\nStream: “Static” – Caitlyn Smith\n\nSinger/songwriter, musician, producer, Nashville innovator, Caitlyn Smith who released her self-produced record High & Low in 2023 decided to part ways with her record label, Monument Records after three critically acclaimed and successful albums, and go it alone to release her first single “Static.”\n\n“I’m so excited for this one, because it’s right where I’m at right now,” Smith says of the song. “Trying to navigate the creative waters after parting ways with my label, having my third baby, and being in this business for over 20 years… I found myself so weighed down by the “business” and losing the magic of it all. So, I turned around and created something beautiful out of the struggle. I love this song so much… can’t wait for you to hear it.”\n\n“Static” is a soothing balm for those us who feel lost in life and little jaded. Over a slow jam of guitars with Smith’s vocals bending to the music, she asks if the magic’s gone, and if static is the only channel left to listen to.\n\nAll I hear is static\n\nAll I feel is numb\n\nI don’t know what happened to the magic\n\nTell me is it gone?\n\nSmith writes about the human experience well. She can create cinematic landscapes in her songs full of ache, passion, and regret. Smith is married to a fellow musician and a mother of three boys, but despite this, she manages to conjure feelings of heartbreak and ‘what ifs’ that feel just as real and as immediate, as if she was living them\n\nThe beauty of “Static” is it could be about any situation. A job, a relationship, family, or just a state of mind. Smith talked about walking away from her label after feeling like the business of music was taking away what’s important about art. So, in true Caitlyn Smith style, she decided to “write it all down and listen to my heart.”\n\n“Static” is out now.\n\n— —\n\n:: stream/purchase Static here ::\n\n:: connect with Caitlyn Smith here ::\n\nStream: “Static” – Caitlyn Smith\n\n— — — —\n\nConnect to Caitlyn Smith on\n\nFacebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram\n\nDiscover new music on Atwood Magazine\n\n© Jace Kartye\n\n:: Today’s Song(s) ::\n\nfollow our daily playlist on Spotify"
