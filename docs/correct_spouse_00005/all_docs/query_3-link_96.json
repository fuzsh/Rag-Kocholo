Burial was in Chatham Hill Memorial Gardens. Vanessa was a woman who loved her family. She displayed her love for them by devoting herself to them and their needs. She was a home-maker: To her, that meant taking care of the obligations in front of her. No matter how little the family had she always made sure that there was a meal on the table. She always put the needs of her family above her own. Vanessa loved her husband. After 45 years of marriage, she never wanted to be any-where without him. He was an over the road truck driver and when he was shifting those gears she was always on his “RIGHT” side telling him how to drive. He was the love of her life and she wanted to spend every moment with him that she could.\n\nVanessa loved her grand-children dearly. She always reminded them of how proud of them that she was. She talked about them to every-one that she met. She told them often that she loved them and every time she saw them she had a little token of some sort for them.

She cherished photographs and would display them with great pride.\n\nVanessa was a woman of prayer, if she said that she was praying for you, she did it. She would pray for anyone anywhere. She never met a stranger. If you came in contact with her you encountered grace. She always saw people through the lenses of goodness. She saw the positive attributes of others no matter how messy their lives were. She was an encourager. She had a way of knowing when others were hurting and she would make the necessary sacrifices to help make them feel better. She was a trusted friend to many. She was a person that you could confide in and tell your deepest secrets to.\n\nVanessa loved holidays, especially Christmas. Her idea of a wonderful Christmas did not come in a beautifully wrapped package with a fancy bow. Her idea of Christmas was being surrounded by her family, sharing laughter, and enjoying good food. When the family would come together she would entertain them with her stories where she would laugh hysterically. She would laugh so hard that she could not complete her own sentences. She was full of life that made you feel so loved and so special. She was a woman with a grand heart and a gentle touch. She was simply amazing.

A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” Mark Twain. Born on June 10, 1934 in Mason City, Iowa, Jim was the son of the late Carl Manly Anderson and Gladys Harrison Anderson. Jim was the husband of Barbara Westre Anderson for 55y ears. (Barbara preceded him in death in 2014 and we are sure she waspatiently awaiting his arrival in heaven.) After serving in the Korean War Jim attended the University of South Dakota where he majored in Biology and Zoology. One of his activities at USD was working lighting in the drama department. He often reflected that he met and quickly fell for Barbara, who was majoring in drama. Jim proposed to her behind the chemistry building. They leave behind three grateful children, Gus (Gamble), Trish (Andy) and Elizabeth (Andy) and five amazing grandchildren, Lauren, Lindsay, Savannah, Christopher and George. There are so many others in his life that he considered to be his family.\n\nJim’s job with the US Fish and Wildlife Service took his family on amazing adventures throughout the southeast, and they chose Cheraw as their forever home.\n\nNot one to be limited to travels in the US, Jim accepted a job with The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and packed his brave family up to move to the Philippines in 1969 for 2 years. He enjoyed it so much that he accepted another job offer with the UN and returned to the Philippines again for a few years in 1979. Jim’s love and appreciation for all that the world had to offer would later encourage his children and grandchildren to open their minds to the world.\n\nGardening was another passion of Jim’s and all that knew him were fortunate to enjoy vegetables from his garden and delicious food from his kitchen. He also enjoyed cooking for others and taking care of his neighbors and friends. He penned a family cookbook after continued requests for his recipes.\n\nJim was an avid reader and served on the Chesterfield County library board for several years. When any of his children wanted to know more about a subject he often said “look it up”! Jim encouraged debate, and to know your views and be able to defend them intelligently. He enjoyed reading to his children and grandchildren and as they grew he often read whatever books they were reading.\n\nAfter he retired from the Federal Government, Jim opened Carl’s Yard Maintenance. He and Barbara enjoyed being outside in customers’ yards and sharing his knowledge and love of plants and trees. He was never far from God’s many creatures and plants. Jim was a faithful servant of God and served on the Vestry, The School Board and the Altar Guild at St. David’s Church in Cheraw, SC.\n\nJim was also passionate about the preservation of Old St. David’s Church in Cheraw. During the restoration of Old Saint David’s, Jim helped procure the current bell from a retired Navy ship.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family asks that you make a donation to Chesterfield County library or a library of your choice or To St. David’s Church. In his memory you are encouraged to plant a tree, read a book, take care of your neighbor, and encourage reading in children. “Let us endeavor to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry” Mark Twain. A memorial service for Jim was held at St. Davids Church on February 8, 2020 at 10:00 am Cheraw, SC followed by interment at Old St. Davids Cemetery.
