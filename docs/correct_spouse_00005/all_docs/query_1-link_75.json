        "text": "It’s hard to believe it has been fourteen years since Dawson’s Creek came to an end.\n\nNearly two decades since its finale, Life & Style is going behind the scenes of the teen series — and finding out what the famous cast was really like on set.\n\nMORE: Jamie Foxx Gets Into Brawl Amid Romance With Katie Holmes — Get His Side of the Story!\n\nJames Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson all got their start on the popular WB show, and while Joshua was described as “Mr. Popular” and James was deemed “an ordinary guy,” one crew member did not have fond memories of Katie.\n\n“She was the least warm of all of them,” says set costumer Rosalida Medina of Katie’s tendency to skip fittings. “I was not close to her.”\n\nHowever that did not stop her from finding love on set, as it was also revealed that Katie, 38, and Joshua, 38, were secretly a couple on and off-screen.\n\n“Most of the crew didn’t know they were dating,” said makeup department head John R. Bayless.\n\nMORE: Never Miss a Life & Style Exclusive by Signing up for Our Newsletter!\n\nToday, the cast is still in the spotlight. Michelle who was described as the “quiet one” was just nominated for an Oscar and raising her 11-year-old daughter with the late Heath Ledger. James, 39, is a father-of-four, and Joshua recently ended his 10-year-old relationship with actress Diane Kruger.\n\nMeanwhile, Katie, who shares daughter Suri with ex Tom Cruise is reportedly dating Jamie Foxx — and things are heating up for the low-key couple.\n\n“Jamie is someone she can trust and have fun with,” an insider said of the brunette beauty. “She’s getting everything from Jamie that she didn’t get with Tom.\n\nAnother source adds, “They’re very serious.”"
