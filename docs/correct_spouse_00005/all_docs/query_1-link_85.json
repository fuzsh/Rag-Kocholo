Croatoan, the Icehome Beach…neither place is home to me. So when a group heads off to the fruit caves to investigate thievery, I go with them. Any excuse to get away from the beach, where I’ve made a fool of myself in front of my ex and his new mate. Things go from bad to worse as I’m kidnapped by strangers. These new people have four arms, long fluffy tails, and arching horns. They aren’t like any aliens I’ve seen before, and they live in the warm caverns below the mountains. They should be the enemy. I should hate them for snatching me. But the chief’s son says I’m the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen…New plan: I romance the chief’s son until he frees me. What could possibly go wrong? AmazonKU\n\nXALAN MATED: XALANITE MATES BOOK THREE by A J Mullican\n\nT’raat crash-lands in the strangest of places: a Midwest farm. The pale-skinned humans are weird enough, but the beasts they befriend and tame are even more unbelievable! To top it all off, the farmer’s daughter, Leigh Hall, sets his hearts aflutter and his n’ril into hyperdrive. T’raat will have to make a decision, though, when the Xalanite elders arrive to bring their wayward pilot home. AmazonKU\n\nCHANCE (MINDSET DUET BOOK TWO) by C J Dragon\n\nIt’s an arduous task to start over on a new, unexplored planet, but that’s what Chance Bradford signed up for. As a Mindset Two, his empathy and training helps his fellow colonists, allaying their fears and bolstering their confidence. At least, until the dragons were seen flying high above the colony dome. Discovering that only he can communicate with the telepathic ‘dragons’ comes at a price, their first meeting full of terror and pain. Trying to understand a completely alien race strains Chance’s abilities and puts him in the sights of the humans that want the planet for themselves alone. Will Chance be able to forge a peace between the colony and the dragon’s Flight? Is friendship even possible between the two species? Will humans become the dragon’s prey, or perhaps something else altogether?\n\nAmazon Apple Books Kobo\n\nALIEN WARRIOR VINDICATED (GALACTIC GLADIATOR GAMES BOOK SIX) by Margo Bond Collins\n\nHe’s an assassin who works for his planet’s government, a silent shadow who kills without compunction. She’s a crisis-intervention counselor who’s certain any emotional damage can be healed through talking about it. Now they’re in each other’s heads…and determined to free themselves from one another. Welcome to the Galactic Gladiator Games, where the toughest aliens in the galaxy fight for the most prestigious titles. But these games come with a twist: every alien warrior is mentally and emotionally bound to a potential Earth mate, forced to work with her to overcome their enemies–and sometimes each other. AmazonKU\n\nHIS LITTLE MORGANITE (ELEADIAN MATES BOOK EIGHT) by Paige Michaels\n\nAva has it all. Great job. Great friends. Great apartment. She’s also got a body men drool over, and she knows it. She’s a little-black-dress, high heels, perfect makeup kind of gal. She’s pretty bored with her life though, so who cares if a trip to Club Zoom finds her chosen by an Eleadian male? As a science fiction author, Ganrax spends his days sequestered in his office. He hasn’t had much of a social life for years. It’s time to make changes, starting with procuring a mate, someone who will liven things up and bring him out of his shell. Ava’s heart nearly beats out of her chest when her best friend is instantly chosen by one of the tallest men she’s ever seen. In a near panic, it takes her a while to realize Mia isn’t the only one of them who will be leaving Earth tonight. The blond giant blocking Ava from getting to her friend is also sucking the oxygen out of the room, and when he touches her, she knows her life is about to undergo a drastic change. AmazonKU\n\nCONFLICT LESSENS: SAPPHIC SPACE FANTASY (MAGIC OF THE GALAXY BOOK THREE) by Harlowe Frost\n\nThe Krottel have been found on Earth, yet the officials don’t seem worried.
