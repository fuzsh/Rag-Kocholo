        "text": "It's been 25 years since fans were first introduced to Dawson, Joey and Pacy on \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\nThe show focused on Dawson Leery and his group of friends as they navigated high school and he pursued his dream of making it in Hollywood. One of the main storylines followed the love triangle between him, Pacy and Joey, starting in the third season, which put Dawson and Pacy's friendship to the ultimate test.\n\nThe TV series aired six seasons, from 1998 to 2003.\n\nMany of the show's stars were just starting out when \"Dawson's Creek\" premiered. They quickly skyrocketed to fame with the success of the show. Some in the cast later earned Academy and Emmy Award nominations for other projects.\n\nHere is what the cast is up to today.\n\nJAMES VAN DER BEEK SAYS FUTURE HOLLYWOOD CAREER WOULD HAVE TO 'FIT AROUND' HIS FAMILY AFTER MOVE TO TEXAS\n\nJames Van Der Beek\n\nStarring as the main character, Dawson Leery, James Van Der Beek quickly became a household name.\n\nHe landed a role in \"Varsity Blues\" in 1999, just one year after the show premiered, and he won an MTV Movie Award.\n\nWhile the show was still airing, Van Der Beek starred in a number of high-profile movies such as \"Scary Movie,\" \"Texas Rangers,\" \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" and \"The Rules of Attraction.\"\n\nOnce \"Dawson's Creek\" ended, he transitioned to guest appearances in various TV shows, such as \"How I Met Your Mother,\" \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Ugly Betty,\" \"One Tree Hill\" and \"Medium.\" In 2010, Van Der Beek was cast in a major recurring role in \"Mercy,\" starring alongside Josh Lucas and Jon Hamm as an ICU doctor who is hiding a dark secret.\n\nVan Der Beek has never been one to take himself too seriously, later starring as a fictional version of himself in \"Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23.\"\n\nJAMES VAN DER BEEK SAYS MOVING FROM LOS ANGELES TO AUSTIN WAS ‘GROUNDING’ FOR HIS FAMILY\n\nThe actor had a five-episode arch on the popular FX show \"Pose,\" a small part in Matt Damon's film \"Downsizing\" and produced, wrote and starred in \"What Would Diplo Do.\" In 2019, he participated in the 28th season of \"Dancing with the Stars,\" finishing in fifth place.\n\nVan Der Beek married his first wife Heather Ann McComb in 2003, but they divorced in 2010. That same year, he married his second wife Kimberly Brook. The two are still married and have six kids: Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn and Jeremiah.\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nKatie Holmes' audition for the role of Joey Potter on \"Dawson's Creek\" was reportedly so amazing she won the part instantly. Once the show premiered, she quickly caught the attention of the nation and graced the covers of \"Seventeen,\" \"TV Guide\" and \"Rolling Stone.\"\n\nWhile still playing Joey, Holmes began a career in movies, starring in \"Disturbing Behavior,\" for which she won an MTV Movie Award. She also starred in films alongside big-name actors, including Michael Douglas in \"Wonder Boys,\" Colin Farrell in \"Phone Booth,\" Robert Downey Jr. in \"The Singing Detective\" and Cate Blanchett in \"The Gift,\" in which Holmes did her first nude scene.\n\nHer first role after \"Dawson's Creek\" ended was in \"Pieces of April,\" which critics agreed was Holmes' best work. Variety wrote that it was \"one of her best film performances.\" Holmes followed this up with major roles in the movies \"First Daughter,\" \"Batman Begins,\" \"Thank You For Smoking\" and \"Mad Money.\"\n\nHolmes dipped her toe into the world of directing in 2015 with a short documentary about Olympic gymnast Nadia Comăneci, \"Eternal Princess.\" Holmes directed her first movie, \"All We Had,\" in 2016.\n\nTOM CRUISE, KATIE HOLMES' DAUGHTER MAKES BIG SCREEN DEBUT\n\nAs for the actress' personal life, she got engaged to actor Chris Klein in 2003, but they called it quits in 2005. That same year, she began dating Tom Cruise, who she had previously gushed over to Seventeen magazine, saying, \"I think every little girl dreams about her wedding. I used to think I was going to marry Tom Cruise.\"\n\nAfter only seven weeks of dating, her dream came true in Nov. 2006 when she and Cruise got hitched. They had one daughter, Suri Cruise, born that same year.\n\nHolmes and Cruise opted to keep Suri out of the public eye for a majority of her childhood.\n\nIn June 2012, Holmes filed for divorce. At the time, they released a joint statement requesting privacy as they worked through the terms of both their divorce and custody agreement for their daughter, according to a report from People magazine.\n\nThe statement seemed to confirm reports that Holmes filed for divorce because she did not agree with Cruise’s religious beliefs and his approach to raising their daughter in the Church of Scientology. Their divorce was finalized in July 2012, with Holmes receiving full custody of Suri.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2019, Holmes was rumored to be dating actor Jamie Fox and had a brief romance with chef Emilio Vitolo Jr. from 2020 to 2021.\n\nMichelle Williams\n\nMichelle Williams had a few credits to her name before getting cast as Jen Lindley in \"Dawson's Creek.\" She has since gone on to win numerous awards, including a Golden Globe and an Emmy.\n\nHer first big role in a movie came in 1998 when she appeared alongside Jamie Lee Curtis in \"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,\" the seventh installment in the Halloween franchise.\n\nWhile she starred in a few films during and after her time on \"Dawson's Creek,\" her big break came when she landed a supporting role in the drama \"Brokeback Mountain.\" The part garnered Williams her first Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 2010, she received her second Oscar nomination for her role in \"Blue Valentine\" alongside Ryan Gosling.\n\nHer third nomination came the following year for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in \"My Week With Marilyn.\" She followed that up with \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" and \"Manchester by the Sea,\" for which she received her fourth Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 2019, the actress won an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of dancer Gwen Verdon in the miniseries \"Fosse/Verdon.\"\n\nMICHELLE WILLIAMS SHARES WHY SHE HASN’T WATCHED ANY OF HER MOVIES OR TV PROJECTS IN OVER A DECADE\n\nWhile filming \"Brokeback Mountain,\" Williams became romantically involved with co-star Heath Ledger. The two dated three years and had a daughter together, Matilda. The couple broke up just a few months prior to the actor's tragic death caused by an accidental overdose in 2007.\n\nEight years after Ledger's death, Williams told Newsweek losing her daughter's father doesn't get any easier. \"It’s just that the more time passes, the more you miss someone. In some ways it gets worse. That’s what I would say,\" she told the outlet.\n\nThrough all the heartbreak, Williams never gave up on love. She married her first husband, Phil Elverum, in July 2018, but they divorced a year later.\n\nIn December 2019, she announced she was engaged to theater director Thomas Kail. She also revealed she was pregnant with their first child. They were married in March 2020, and their son was born in June of that year. In May 2022, she announced she was pregnant with their second child.\n\nJoshua Jackson\n\nJoshua Jackson had already made a name for himself as Charlie Conway in \"The Mighty Ducks,\" and its two sequels before signing on to play Pacey Witter on \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\nDuring his time on the show, Jackson also appeared in a few films, including \"Cruel Intentions\" with Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"The Skulls\" alongside Paul Walker, \"Gossip\" with Kate Hudson and \"The Safety of Objects\" alongside Glenn Close.\n\nOnce the TV series ended, he continued appearing in films, including \"Bobby\" with Anthony Hopkins and Demi Moore, \"Cursed\" with Christina Ricci, and \"Inescapable\" alongside Marisa Tomei.\n\nJackson also starred in the popular science fiction series \"Fringe\" for five seasons, from 2008 until 2013. His time on \"Fringe\" was quickly followed by a lead role in Showtime's hit show, \"The Affair,\" which he starred in from 2014-2019.\n\nThe actor also had a leading role in the miniseries \"Little Fires Everywhere\" in 2020, and \"Dr. Death\" in 2021.\n\nThe next year, it was announced he would be starring in \"Fatal Attraction,\" a show on Paramount+.\n\nJOSHUA JACKSON AND JODIE TURNER-SMITH WELCOME FIRST CHILD TOGETHER\n\nJackson has also had some trouble with the law. After getting into a fight with a security guard in 2002 while at a hockey game, he was arrested and charged with assault, affray and public intoxication and disruption. However, the charges were dropped after he agreed to go to an alcohol education program and do community service.\n\nAs for his love life, Jackson was in a relationship with Katie Holmes while filming \"Dawson's Creek,\" but they broke up after two years together. He later dated Diane Kruger for 10 years, from 2006 to 2016. In December 2019, he married actress Jodie Turner-Smith. The couple welcomed their daughter in April 2020.\n\nMary Beth Peil\n\nMary Beth Peil was an accomplished opera and soprano singer and stage actress before she decided to take her talents to the small screen.\n\nShe starred as Evelyn \"Grams\" Ryan in \"Dawson's Creek,\" becoming the only actress outside the main four young stars to be credited as a series regular.\n\nSome of her early acting credits include \"The Odd Couple II,\" \"The Reagans,\" \"The Stepford Wives,\" \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and \"The List.\" During this time, she also appeared in the off-Broadway play \"As Thousands Cheer,\" as well as the Broadway plays \"Sweeney Todd\" and \"Nine.\"\n\nFrom 2009 to 2016, Peil played a role in another successful TV show, \"The Good Wife,\" starring as the mother of Chris Noth's character.\n\nShe also continued to work on stage.
