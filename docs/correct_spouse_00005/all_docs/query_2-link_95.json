        "text": "I have for you a gorgeous dual-time book revolving around an art mystery chocked full of mostly set in Gibraltar–quite an unusual setting, not sure I’ve seen #ChristFic set there before. Welcome Erin to the Index!\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Erin’s Story\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about writing this book?\n\nThe research! I have always been interested in art, both viewing and creating it. So to write a book focused on painters and painting was an absolute delight. I got to plunge myself into the biographies of female painters, both famous and (more often) obscure, and histories of particular art movements. I learned about the discovery and adoption of the pigments artists have used over the centuries (which is fascinating and occasionally horrifying stuff). I visited several special exhibits and collections of world-famous paintings and painters at top-tier museums (you know, the stuff you see in books and on posters, but the real thing). I did a lot of painting myself (more on that later).\n\nIt’s one of the things I like most about writing all of my novels: I get to go deep into subjects I’m curious and passionate about and all the while I’m also getting stuff done. Win-win.\n\nWhy did you choose the geographical location in which your book is set?\n\nMuch of the book, in both the past and present timelines, is set in Gibraltar, a setting I have not personally encountered in my own fiction reading. Beyond it being unique and not overdone as a setting, I chose Gibraltar for several story-based reasons. It is a crossroads of different cultures, a gateway to two seas and two continents, a geological structure that is both solid and riddled with caves and tunnels, and a piece of land that has been fought over for millennia. All of those characteristics are things I explore in my characters and the place itself becomes a metaphor and a touchpoint for my two main characters, Viviana and Esther. Its peculiar history also allowed me to consider issues of conquest, colonization, and control in both history and in my characters’ lives. I became interested in Gibraltar through conversations with a former professor of mine who is Gibraltarian, and I was able to rely on him to provide many books, conversations, and other resources that were vital to my research. I hope after reading this book you want to travel there!\n\nWhat research did you do to make your character(s) authentic?\n\nBeyond reading many, many books about Gibraltar, painting and painters, colors and pigments, and mental illness (one character in the story suffers from schizophrenia), I did a lot of hands-on research. For all of 2022, I painted one self-portrait a month since the story centers around a portrait and two characters (one in each timeline) paints self-portraits regularly. I shared these all on my social media channels—the failures and the successes. Though I’ve been painting since I was a child, I have been intimidated by the idea of painting people, so this was a fun, eye-opening, and ultimately successful experiment in learning how to accurately depict the human face. I also participated in a life drawing class, both as an artist and as a model, to understand what it feels like to draw a nude person or to sit for long periods, totally exposed, while strangers draw you. Oddly, it’s not as weird or uncomfortable as you might think.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Erin’s Reading\n\nErin is giving away either a paperback (USA Only).

Steampunk is a delightful mix of history and fantasy, I think. And there’s a brand new one this month! Welcome Angela Bell to the Index!\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Angela’s Story\n\nWhat inspired this story?\n\nThis story was inspired by the grand adventure of Around the World in 80 Days and the enchanting whimsy of The Nutcracker. While Verne’s Phileas and Passepartout set forth on a race around the world, the characters in my book embark on a merry scavenger hunt across Europe. In every city they explore, my characters enjoy a regional dessert inspired by the confectionary citizens in the Land of Sweets who dance to honor young Clara in Tchaikovsky’s ballet. It was such fun to draw inspiration from these stories! I hope readers will enjoy finding the little head nods, easter eggs, and references to them I sprinkled throughout the book.\n\nWhich scene is your favorite, the one you never tired of working with? Give us a reason to look forward to it.\n\nWhat a fun question! Let’s see…oh, there’s a delightfully funny scene in Chapter 27, which never failed to make me laugh out loud with every reading. It takes place in a magnificent European cathedral. All is hushed and somber until something rather unexpected happens thanks to the antics of my heroine’s animal-loving mum, Mrs. Stanton. Then the grandiose silence is abruptly shattered, and the fur quite literally flies as absolute hilarity ensues! Just thinking of the scene makes me smile.\n\nWhy did you choose the geographical location in which your book is set?\n\nLike my heroine, I’ve always been fascinated by faraway places, especially Europe, but unexpected life circumstances have prevented me from traveling as much as I’d like. As I plotted the course of my fictional scavenger hunt, I specifically chose cities and landmarks I hope to see in real life one day, and through the magic of YouTube, travel blogs, and virtual online tours, I was able to visit them in my imagination. I learned about the cultures. Experienced the sights, sounds, smells, and local cuisine. Now, through this whimsical story, I hope to give readers a sensory experience that allows them to explore the world from the comfort of home.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Angela’s Reading\n\nAngela is giving away a paperback (USA or Canaday Only).

I love when the heroes are on covers instead of only the heroines. Welcome Jody Hedlund to the Index!\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Jody’s Story\n\nWhat inspired this story?\n\nSince I love romance more than anything else, I thought the matchmaker idea would be a fun way to tie a series together. As I began researching matchmaker stories, I realized that there is a long tradition of Irish men being matchmakers. So, the Irish matchmaker takes the stage in all of the books.\n\nKnowing I wanted to use the Irish, I researched places that had large Irish populations in the 1800s, and St. Louis was one of them. As the Gateway to the West, St. Louis was full of danger, disease, and disaster—all of the things that make for a great story and the perfect setting for the Shanahan family.\n\nIn particular, I chose the year 1849 as the starting point for this series because a number of tragedies occurred in St. Louis at that time, including a deadly cholera epidemic and a tragic fire along the riverfront.\n\nWhat character in your book turned out to be your favorite?\n\nObviously I love the hero and heroine! But aside from them, Bellamy McKenna, the matchmaker, is one of my favorite characters in this series. He is in the process of beginning to take over the matchmaker duties from his father and has some different, less conventional ways of bringing about matches. He’s not only intuitive, but he’s also very clever. Readers will hopefully fall in love with Bellamy (and maybe, just maybe, he’ll get his love story eventually too!).\n\nWhy did you choose the year in which your book is set?\n\nA story set in St. Louis in 1849? What’s so special about that? Why read a story set there?\n\nLots of reasons, actually! Let me tell you just a few:\n\n• 1849 St. Louis was a year for DIVERSITY. As the “Gateway to the West,” people from all over the world were arriving every day, many with the hope of traveling to California to get rich from the gold that had just been discovered.\n\n• 1849 St. Louis was a year for DEATH. A deadly cholera epidemic plagued the city for months and thousands died.\n\n• 1849 St. Louis was a year for DISASTER. An enormous fire broke out among steamboats on the levee and destroyed large portions of the city.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nJody is giving away either a paperback.

Perhaps an ensemble cast book about friendships? Then try Cathy’s latest. Welcome to the Index, Cathy!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Cathy’s Story\n\nWhat inspired this story?\n\nWhen I first read of the Halifax Explosion (December 6, 1917), I was astonished that I’d never heard of it, considering that before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in WWII, this was the biggest man-made explosion that had ever occurred.\n\nReading of the devastation, of lives lost and those forever changed by burns, crippling, and blindness in the Halifax Explosion, I was reminded of all my mother endured as a small child after being badly burned, how she overcame that tragedy, and yet how those injuries affected her throughout her lifetime.\n\nIt was fascinating to me that with so many disappearing in the explosion some took the opportunity to reinvent themselves and change their identity. I asked, why would a person do that? What would make a person choose to leave everything and everyone behind and forge a new life?\n\nAlso, the growing disregard for others and increased bullying that I witness through social media and in our society greatly concerns me. I wanted to show through story that such things—to which we may turn a blind eye—can go beyond rudeness and can have serious and lasting consequences that we may never intend or imagine.\n\nI was inspired by Joseph’s handling of those who wronged him in the Bible, how he reacted when faced with the opportunity to retaliate or to forgive and embrace, and I wanted to see how that could play out through fictional characters.\n\nLastly, I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of young people growing up in boarding schools, so I looked for a girls’ boarding school in New England, knowing that I wanted to set the main part of the story in the US. That’s when I discovered Miss Porter’s School and its long and interesting history. I could well imagine four girls growing up as close friends in such a setting and together facing numerous challenges—many like challenges we face today.\n\nIs there anything in this book that is inspired by/modeled after something in your own life or someone you know in real life?\n\nI am blessed with a precious natural sister who was my very first friend and lifelong confidante, and dear longtime women friends, each a true sister of my heart. Those relationships have taught me the importance of sharing faith, truth from our hearts, trust, integrity, of championing one another’s successes, of comforting through trials and sorrow, and of refusing to allow jealousy, envy, or competition to worm their way between us.\n\nClose relationships can be challenged when years, courses and stages of life, or miles come between us. Love is not fragile, but it does require nurturing. Staying connected through letters or emails, cards, phone calls, and visits requires diligence and commitment. The value, the joy, and the strengthening of those relationships is worth every investment for ourselves, for those who observe our relationships, and for the generations that will follow.\n\nSo while the experiences of the women in Ladies of the Lake are far from my own, the love and support they ultimately offer one another are things that my sister and friends and I have grown into through the years.\n\nWhat character in your book turned out to be your favorite?\n\nAddie is my favorite character. I understood her shyness, her desire to fit in with other girls, her feelings of shame and vulnerability as a young person and her eagerness to grow into her desired gifts of teaching and writing. I understood her desire for friendship, her sacrificial loyalty to those she embraces as family, as well as her desire to disappear when the thought of returning to the world she’d known became conflicted and difficult, and when duty called her in a new direction.\n\nI appreciated Addie’s/Rosaline’s sacrifice, her determination to raise her niece as her daughter, and her great love and desire to protect her. I was inspired by Addie’s courage in overcoming her fear to return to the school years later for her daughter’s sake, even though she knows it will cost her everything to confess her secrets, to remember and confront all those she’s left behind, especially the man she’s always loved. I loved writing Addie’s character arc, witnessing her growth into the woman she was meant to become.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Cathy’s Reading\n\nCathy is giving away either a paperback (USA Only) or an ebook (Internationals Entry welcome).

Welcome Renee Ryan to the Index with her newest release!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Renee’s Story\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nIn my research about British Immigration Policy during the interwar years, I stumbled upon the daring Cook sisters, Ida and Louise. These brave women orchestrated the rescue of 29 Jews from Nazi Germany in the 1930s. What drew me to their story was my indirect connection to the younger sister. Between 1936 and 1985, Ida wrote 112 romance novels as Mary Burchell for Mills and Boon, many of which were later reissued by my publisher Harlequin. Like the fictional Hattie and Vera, the Cook sisters were civil servants with a strong passion for opera. In fact, they first learned of the persecution of Jews through their association with Austrian conduction, Clemens Krauss, and his wife, Viorica Ursuleac. If you’re interested in finding out more about Ida and Louise Cook, I highly recommend Ida’s autobiography, We Followed Our Stars, which was reedited and expanded in 2008 as Safe Passage.\n\nWhat research did you have to look up to make your character(s) authentic?\n\nI wasn’t much of an opera fan before I wrote this book, which was a challenge since one of my two main heroines is an international opera star and the catalyst for the heroine’s first meeting. After spending hours watching video clips and learning about vocal control, I am a true devotee. I highly recommend any version of The Queen of the Night’s aria from the second act of Mozart’s The Magic Flute.\n\nMy personal favorite rendition is by Diana Damrau from her performance with The Royal Opera. The Flower Duet from Lakmé by Delibes is another recently discovered gem. Check out Elīna Garanča & Olga Peretyatko’s performance.\n\nDid you stumble upon anything in your research for this book that you thought was strange or surprising?\n\nA particularly twisty path down a rabbit hole landed me at the gates of the Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp. Located in northern Germany in the town of Bergen, the facility began its life as a prisoner of war camp during the second world war. The official opening date is somewhat in question. However, in 1943, a portion of the facility became an “exchange camp” where valuable Jewish inmates were held with the intention of exchanging them for German prisoners of war. Estimates claim that some 2500 Jews were released or exchanged between the summer of 1943 and December 1944, though it may have been more. By March of 1944, a portion of the facility was designated as a “recovery camp” and inmates too sick to work were brought there from other camps. With them came innumerable diseases. In November of that same year a section was dedicated solely to women and, sometime in the spring of 1945, both Margot and Anne Frank died at Bergen-Belson.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Renee’s Reading\n\nRenee is giving away either a paperback (USA Only) or an ebook (Internationals Entry welcome).

Welcome Amy Lynn Green, once a lady who helped market my books and now writing her own!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Amy’s Story\n\nDid any of the characters in this book “surprise” you?\n\nSince I start writing with only a vague idea of what will happen next, the character of Louise Cavendish, heiress and owner of the library building, turned out much differently than I’d planned. Throughout the book, we see glimpses of her past that shaped who she is in the present, and the ideas that came to me suddenly helped me understand her and feel more sympathy toward this somewhat-difficult character. From her lost love to her desire to serve as a nurse in WWI and then in the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918, her past was much more complicated than I’d realized at the start.\n\nWhich scene is your favorite, the one you never tired of working with? Give us a reason to look forward to it.\n\nIn chapter 27, my feisty Rosie the Riveter character, Ginny, talks herself into a pancake eating contest with a local man at a war benefit breakfast. It was one of the first scenes I wrote to understand who she was, and it still makes me laugh every time, although later in the writing process I added some devastating news to the end of the chapter that puts more of the plot into motion.\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nThere were many real WWII home front details I got to sneak into the story, but my favorite was this can’t-believe-it’s-real detail: the Hooligan Navy. That was the nickname for a ragtag group of civilian volunteers who were commissioned to patrol up and down the Atlantic Coast in borrowed yachts and other crafts on the lookout for U-boats. I included some of the actual comical hijinks that ensued, including a city slicker who almost had the crew radio in a German sub sighting, but found out that the “periscope” he’d seen was just a surfacing porpoise. They did have a few moments of heroism along the way that made it worth the effort, but the majority of the days were filled with tedium and sunburn.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Amy’s Reading\n\nAmy is giving away either a signed paperback (USA Only).

It was a dark time for me, personally, as I went through some health challenges. I felt a lot of discouragement about the future. I decided to write a story about someone who felt like they had lost all hope that the future would be good again. But in the process of writing, I rediscovered my own hope for a fulfilling future! Like me, my heroine Keren found that just around the corner from the worst life has to offer, you will often run right into God’s best.\n\nIf you could be one of your characters, who would you choose to be and why?\n\nI would probably choose to be Keren. She is strong and vulnerable at the same time, has a great sense of humor, and is incredibly nurturing. She is resourceful and manages to crawl out of the pit to face her fears! Unlike me, she is also a great traveler.\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nThere are several historical characters in this novel. King Cambyses of Persia and his wife Mandana; Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon; King Astyages of Media (he is mean!); and the Prophet Daniel to name a few.\n\nWhy did you choose the geographical location in which your book is set?\n\nI was born in the Middle East, and the Persian Empire, especially, remains an important part of my heritage. Although several Persian characters are named in the Bible, most Christians know very little about this fascinating kingdom. I loved discovering more about an important part of our history as God’s people.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Tessa’s Reading\n\nTessa is giving away either a (signed paperback) (USA Only) (or an ebook)(Internationals Entry welcome).

It was a lot of fun for Nora to share my love of horses and a few of my more interesting debacles with training!\n\nDid any of the characters in this book “surprise” you?\n\nSilas Cavallero turned out to be different than I expected him to be.

He continued to insist that he wasn’t the character I’d originally planned him to be and he ended up be the perfect complement to Nora’s strong spirit.\n\nWhat research did you have to look up to make your character(s) authentic?\n\nThere were a lot of things to research for this book, including horse training methods and tack of the time as well as how harness racing would have been in the early 1900s.\n\nI also spent a lot of time researching the Neshoba County Fair, which is a tradition that continues in Philadelphia, Mississippi, to this day. Every July, an entire population moves into a small city of fair cabins for a full week of horse races, contests, the midway, and time spent with family and friends. Cabins have been passed down for several generations, and it’s a place where you almost feel as though you’ve stepped back in time.\n\nFor this story, I got to go back to the early days of the fair when two hotels stood around the square with the original founders’ cabins. I dug through the Mississippi historical archives and studied maps laid out from the early 1900s fair. I was also able to find several newspapers from around the state advertising both the Neshoba County Fair and the Mississippi and Alabama Fair, which heavily publicized their harness races.\n\nWhat research book or website used to write this book was your favorite to peruse?\n\nI bought a reproduction copy of Gleason’s Horse Book, which Nora studies during the novel, an original copy of Correct Social Usage—these are the things Nora’s mother insists upon and Nora chafes against—and I have an original copy of a Mississippi State Fair premiums list from 1927. While this one was a few years past the time of the story, it gave me great ideas for the types of prizes that would have been offered. There were a lot of other research materials, but these were my favorites.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Stephenia’s Reading\n\nStephenia is giving away either a signed paperback (USA Only) OR an ebook to (Internationals entries welcome).

But in this novel, I am not just focusing on Atlanta or even Buckhead, the neighborhood where I grew up and the setting of The Swan House. This time, I focus on the house and property where I grew up in Atlanta. I weave a fictional tale around my parents’ home on Nancy Creek Road as I ask questions about the worth of land, family history, memories, and shared dreams.\n\nThe inspiration for the Atlanta part of the novel came from growing up in the middle of Atlanta with a barn filled with horses in my backyard and several buried in the riding ring. Our five-acre property has been in the family since 1938, when my grandfather built a small house and a two-horse barn out in the boonies of Buckhead on a dirt road for his only child, my mom, to keep her horse and indulge her in her love of riding and showing. My mother was a great equestrian, showing and jumping until she was seventy, and I rode and showed as a child and teen.\n\nOver the years, the house and barn have evolved into something of a rustic private paradise for our family. But estates like my parents’ are being bought up and sold to contractors who implode the house and create cluster mansions on the property. That was my mother’s worst nightmare, and I feel the same way. So I’ve wrestled in my mind for years with the question of “How can we keep this property after my parents are gone?” My novels often touch on themes that mirror events and ruminations in my own life, and so I began to pen a novel about finding alleged dinosaur bones in the backyard of an estate.\n\nAt the same time, I serendipitously happened on a photo of a group of military men galloping their mounts along the beach of Hilton Head Island—my family’s favorite vacation spot for the past fifty years. But this photo was taken during the Battle of the Atlantic in WWII when the island was mostly deserted. I found myself cantering into the world of the Coast Guard Mounted Patrol, affectionately called the Sand Pounders, and what a wild ride that was!\n\nSo I created a dual-time novel that highlights the wonder and adventure of my mother’s life as a young equestrian star, referring to real events but scooting the storyline back to the 1930s and ’40s (Mom’s heyday was in the ’50s)—the heroine is called Dale in the novel—combined with the intrigue of the Battle of the Atlantic, and then brought in my present-day protagonist, Allie, as her granddaughter, who has dreamed for all her life of turning Nana Dale’s estate into an equine therapy center.\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nAfter finding that photo of the Sound Pounders, I started doing research in earnest. I discovered an article about a father-daughter team who reenact the famed Beach Patrol horseback units. Wayne Ormsbee, a civilian employee at Coast Guard Base Boston, and his daughter, Petty Officer Keisha Kerr, a coast guard active-duty boatswain’s mate, make appearances at parades, civic celebrations, veterans’ events, and horse shows, helping to rekindle interest in the storied Beach Patrol units.\n\nKeisha was kind enough to do a Zoom call with me while she was on duty in Guam. She also pointed me to the book, Prints in the Sand by Eleanor Bishop. From there, I dug down many rabbit holes and learned about the two US tankers who were sunk by a German U-Boat off the coast of St. Simons Island. Then my husband and I journeyed to the island and spent hours perusing the excellent displays at the World War II Homefront Museum. We met a docent historian, Dr. George Cressman, who also provided previously classified documents detailing the creation of the Coast Guard Mounted Patrol and the different stations along all of the coasts of the United States. We also spent an afternoon on the grounds of what was Camp McDougal on Hilton Head Island, where the military camp and horses were housed during WWII.\n\nSuffice it to say, I spent many, many hours understanding the Battle of the Atlantic and found it inspiring and fascinating. Especially the heroism of so many Stateside civilians doing their part to construct Liberty ships and guard the coasts when the German threat was at its height.\n\nWhat do you hope readers learn from this story?\n\nAllie and her Nana Dale are both strong women who are courageous, savvy businesswomen with a deep respect for family and a deep love for horses. One of the themes in the novel is about obsession. I wanted to examine the thin line between fighting for what you believe in and developing an unhealthy obsession. Both women learn important lessons about pursuing dreams at all costs, which may cause them to sacrifice something or someone they love.\n\nWhile I was writing this story, my beloved father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He passed away last February. My mother passed away six years ago. Suddenly, I was not only dealing with deep grief, but also all the questions that had originally inspired the story—how to keep the property—became very real. I have had to consider that theme of obsession for myself. My novel is preaching a sermon to me, and I hope it will also give my readers a lot of food for thought. A few other ‘takeaways’ I’d love to leave my readers are:\n\n• Be kind and courageous.\n\n• Find joy in helping others.\n\n• Fight for what you believe in but fall on your knees often to make sure the Lord has the last say.\n\n• Hold tightly to those you love.\n\n• In life, you often have to take the risk of being misunderstood.\n\n• Practice gratitude—Husy, Dale’s nursemaid, says it well: “It will never be enough, Dale, until you decide that you already have it all. You settle in your mind a grateful heart, a content spirit, and everything else will be gravy, girl.”\n\n• Embrace paradox—Nana Dale tells Allie, “Life is paradox, Allie. When you learn to embrace it all, let it mix together like molasses in oats, well, the sweet fragrance comes out. Even when life stinks.”\n\nAnd my favorite, which I found myself doing over and over as I wrote this novel:\n\n• When life gets hard to stand, kneel.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Elizabeth’s Reading\n\nElizabeth is giving away either a paperback (USA Only).

And the first book in this series I saw was just nominated for a book award recently, you should check this one out!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Amanda’s Story\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about writing this book?\n\nThe Songs That Could Have Been is the second in my Sedgwick County Chronicles series, and my favorite part of writing it was fleshing out supporting characters from the first book. The free-spirited, sentimental Lauren was a perfect foil to her type A uber-planner brother, Garrett, in Roots of Wood and Stone; I fell in love with her and was thrilled to be able to explore her character more and give her a story of her own. Similarly, Garrett and Lauren’s grandmother Rosie always fascinated me, and I wanted to dig into her background. It was also a blast to bring back Garrett and Sloane in supporting roles in this book; turns out having a character who works in a historical museum is pretty handy when you’re writing split-time.\n\nWhat was the hardest part of your book to write?\n\nBasically the entire past timeline was the hardest part! Most of the scenes depicting racism were emotionally difficult for me to write as well as tricky: how do I portray the past accurately without causing unnecessary pain to present-day readers? I’m very grateful to my amazing sensitivity reader, Jayna Breigh, for helping me do the best I can to achieve that balance.\n\nIn my research, I also uncovered some of the Scriptures used to justify racial prejudice, and it made me think about how we modern-day Christians might also be misinterpreting or outright twisting Scripture. It’s alarming to think about, and caused me to pray for wisdom!\n\nWhy did you choose the year in which your book is set?\n\nWhen I first started kicking around ideas for this story, I thought it might be interesting to set it in 1958 and include the sit-in at Wichita’s Dockum Drug, which—unbeknownst to many—was the country’s first successful lunch counter sit-in. However, as Rosie and Ephraim’s story unfolded, it became clear that I needed to set it in a time when there was very little hope for change and no reason to believe that an interracial romance would ever be accepted in mainstream society. The decision was for practical reasons, as well; I specifically stated Rosie’s age and high school graduation year in Roots of Wood and Stone, so that definitely limited my flexibility with her character!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Amanda’s Reading\n\nAmanda is giving away a signed paperback (USA Only).

Welcome Naomi Musch to the Index, bringing us another heroine of World War II book!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Naomi’s Story\n\nWhat inspired this story?\n\nWhen I learned that there were thirty-eight prisoner of war branch camps in Wisconsin during WWII, and that German prisoners of war were sent to work on the farms and in the factories of my home state, I could hardly wait to write a story about the “what-ifs” of such a time, especially after reading some of the true stories told by those who lived through those experiences. Enemies really did become life-long friends and sometimes more.\n\nSome people might think that to be impossible, or even that I was looking at that period through rose-colored glasses. After all, we’re talking WWII here. Atrocities. Horrors. Man’s evil to man. But the historical record is full of accounts where Germans and Americans sat down and ate together, shared a cold drink, and sometimes kept up a correspondence after the war—and more. There were a large number of prisoners that later immigrated to the United States to begin a new life.\n\nOf course, one of the great difficulties in writing this story was in realistically being able to bring my characters together in situations where they, as enemies, could get to know each other a little bit more. I also needed to create an atmosphere where they might even develop an attraction. All this while keeping true to the narrative of mistrust and other historical nuances of the war, such as fear of sabotage.\n\nWhich scene is your favorite, the one you never tired of working with? Give us a reason to look forward to it.\n\nIn trying to introduce attraction between the hero and heroine while also not overlooking the antagonism and suspicion inherent to the situation, I had to create a few scenarios that brought the characters into close contact—and gave them the opportunity to see each other through different lenses than they expected. Throughout the first part of the book, my heroine Fanny is mistrustful and even hateful toward the Germans. She resents needing to have their help on the farm, and she only sees them as having evil intent. Then one day she and her siblings are taking a much-deserved respite with a swim in the nearby creek.\n\nFannie has almost set aside her worries about the farm, until the rustle of bushes announces the presence of the prisoners, then she and her younger brother and sister are caught swimming by themselves while a host of Germans stand on the embankment, watching them.\n\nFannie immediately feels vulnerable and angry at once. They’re all staring at her. Some are stripping off their shirts, getting ready to swim, and she can’t get her and her siblings out of the situation fast enough. She’s especially abashed by the German captain who speaks to her as she passes and another German prisoner who has shown her special attention.\n\nBut later on, when the prisoners also return from their respite, the captain asks permission of his American guard to speak to Fannie. She has no idea he’d been learning English, and she’s taken aback—especially when she learns he was a teacher back in Germany, something she desires to become. Even that some of the other prisoners were his students. Meanwhile, there’s the other prisoner who pays close attention to the discourse between Fannie and the captain.\n\nThis was a fun scene to write, and I think readers will enjoy the underlying sense of romance and suspense it entails.\n\nWhat research book or website used to write this book was your favorite to peruse?\n\nMy favorite research book for this story was an out-of-print book called Stalag Wisconsin: Inside WWII Prisoner-of-War Camps by Betty Cowley. It was filled with historical accounts of those who remembered the prisoners staying in Wisconsin and working among them. Every PW camp in the state is described, and accounts of each are written about.\n\nI tried to convey the same sense of reality in Season of My Enemy that I read about that I read about in those stories—many of which had very happy endings! I also included a few instance that were unusual, such as some I learned about in the book also.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Naomi’s Reading\n\nNaomi is giving away either a (signed paperback) (USA Only).

At least, that’s what I tell people. I did spend two days there, visiting the historical sights, especially the Alamo, tasting the food, just getting the feel and the flavor of the city because I had never been there. The bonus is that my son lives in Austin, so I managed to sneak in a two-day visit with him!\n\nWhat was the hardest part of your book to write?\n\nThe hardest part was that this was my first dual time novel. From learning about how to write two timelines, getting the stories to fit together in the end, how to tie the two stories together, and so much more, it really was a huge learning experience for me. I’m so grateful to Melanie Dobson for guiding me along the way.\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nThere are many historical characters in this book, including Santa Anna, Jim Bowie, William Travis, and Davy Crockett. Then there are the battles of Gonzales, Concepcion, and the Alamo. I don’t go into too much detail about these battles (except for the Alamo), but they do play a very important role in the book. If you read all the way to the end, I have historical notes in there. I don’t want to say too much because some might be spoilers!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Liz’s Reading\n\nLiz is giving away a paperback (USA Only).

Look no further, we’ve got a Faberge egg designer in this one! A dual time line of treasure hunting and artistic secrets. Welcome Kelli to the Index!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Kelli’s Story\n\nWhat inspired this story?\n\nI stumbled across a news article a few years ago about a Russian imperial crown, and buried in the article was a side note about an American scrap metal dealer who had purchased what he thought was an innocuous piece of art at an auction, and he planned to melt it down and sell the gold. As he cleaned it up, however, he realized he had something much more valuable on his hands. He soon learned that he had found one of the missing Faberge Imperial Easter Eggs, and its value was estimated at $33 million. Immediately, I had my story. Where were the missing eggs, and what would happen if someone set out to find one?\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about writing this book?\n\nThe research! The House of Faberge was magical and opulent, and in its glory days was the center of Russian advances and culture. I loved exploring the making of the eggs and the life of Peter Karl Faberge. And when I discovered that he employed female master craftsmen, very advanced for his time, I was even more intrigued.\n\nWhat was the hardest part of your book to write?\n\nI often felt underqualified for this story. It felt much bigger than me and intimidated me quite a bit. It was the most challenging story I’ve written to date.\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nThe historical timeline is very accurate to real events, minus a few creative liberties. Did Peter Karl Faberge really design a mystery 53rd egg that he never told anyone about? Maybe. I don’t actually know. But it’s possible. He was a deeply creative man. But all the events and facts of the other designs, and the historical rumblings that led to the Russian Revolutions and ultimate demise of the Romanov family were all very accurate.\n\nWhy did you choose the geographical location in which your book is set?\n\nI have a deep fascination with Russian culture and history, and on my bucket list is to visit St. Petersburg someday. Visiting it through fiction was step one!\n\nWhat research did you have to look up to make your character(s) authentic?\n\nI read extensively about the Faberge family and the House of Faberge. I ordered every book I could get my hands on, and I studied every picture of each Imperial Egg in detail.\n\nWhat do you hope readers learn from this story?\n\nI hope readers walk away a little intrigued about the history of the eggs. There are still 11 Imperial eggs missing. Perhaps one of my readers will take it upon themselves to find the next one.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Kelli’s Reading\n\nKelli is giving away either a paperback (USA Only).

One relationship is warm and loving. The other … let’s just say “warm and loving” aren’t words I would use to describe it, but they were both so important that they provided what authors call the inciting incident that led both my hero and heroine to the same little town in Texas.\n\nWhy did you choose the geographical location in which your book is set?\n\nThe majority of my books are set in the Texas Hill Country. Why? It’s arguably one of the most beautiful parts of Texas, but even more than that, it’s a location with a rich history that just begs to be explored.\n\nWhat research did you have to look up to make your character(s) authentic?\n\nAlthough Alexandra is a skilled painter, my artistic skills are best described as nonexistent, so I spent a fair amount of time researching painting techniques, specifically working with watercolors. The research was enjoyable and left me with an even greater appreciation for artists’ talents.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Amanda’s Reading\n\nAmanda is giving away either a paperback (USA Only).\n\nEnter the Rafflecopter below! **If you don’t want to enter the Rafflecopter, tell me in a comment below: “I’m not entering the Rafflecopter, but please throw me in the hat” so I can manually put you in there for a chance.**\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\nMary’s problems with hurricanes in this book reminds me of the time I had to move my story by year’s to avoid a snowstorm that would have ruined my whole plot! This story sounds like a great testament to the resilience of women, hope you check it out!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Mary’s Story\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nJacqueline “Jackie” Cochran was an American female pilot and a pioneer in women’s aviation. She conceived of and headed the WASP (Women Airforce Service Pilots). I mention her a few times and have her show up in a scene near the end. She was rather a high-level person working with the military brass, generals, and our country’s leaders, so I didn’t feel she would be working directly with my ladies. I also included hurricanes which took place during my story. I knew once I realized my story happened during and where hurricanes were, I needed to deal with them one way or another. (More about hurricanes in my next answer.)\n\nWere there any historical facts that you discovered in your research that made you change something in your story?\n\nYes, the 1944 East Coast Hurricane season. I was working through some of the details of my plot, minding my own business—or rather the business of my characters—when a stray thought popped into my head. When is hurricane season? Being a West Coast gal—born and bred—I don’t think much about hurricanes until a big one hits and makes the news. So, I researched the 1944 hurricane season and cringed. I needed to either move my story to earlier in the year to avoid the hurricanes, move my story to a different part of the country, again, to avoid hurricanes, or plunge headlong into one of the worst ones that year. Who wants to race into a hurricane? With all the challenges I had planned for my WASPs, the last thing they needed was a hurricane to content with. Also, I really didn’t want to do extensive hurricane research. On a cursory scan of 1944 hurricanes, I found the perfect storm, the Cuba/Florida hurricane. What’s an author to do but shift the timeline and throw her characters into the thick of it? “Watch out hurricane, here come the WASPs.” I don’t know if Peggy has quite forgiven me yet.\n\nWhat research did you have to look up to make your characters authentic?\n\nI researched a lot about WASP (Women Airforce Service Pilots). I needed to know how they were affiliated with the military, what duties they had, their uniform, where they might have been stationed, and so much more about them, as well as how things might have worked. Every time I turned around, there was something else I needed to know, most of them were little things. I couldn’t always find the exact answer I needed and had to extrapolate from what I could learn. One of those little things was what color of flashy lights did the military emergency vehicles on base have?\n\nDid you stumble upon anything in your research for this book that made you sad?\n\nOne of the things that made me sad—and also mad—was how poorly some of the military men treated the WASPs. The WASP were given the worst aircraft to fly. They would refer to them as “bucket of bolts,” because they were planes deemed unfit for the men to fly and were poorly maintained. One story I recall from one of the books I checked out of the library was about a WASP in training who was waiting for her final test flight to be certified to fly the military planes. She was told to wait in the hangar for her instructor even after asking multiple times if she should go out to the aircraft. A few hours later, she went out to the aircraft anyway, only to be told she was too late and would have to reschedule her test flight. She had one last opportunity, days later, to take and pass her test. This time she sat in the aircraft and waited. And waited. And waited. She sat for several hours in the Texas heat in the aircraft on the flight line, waiting for her instructor to arrive to test her. Her fellow WASPs brought her a bottle of soda because she had been there so long in the heat. Finally, the instructor showed up and grudgingly tested her. She passed and officially became a WASP. However, it wasn’t only men, women also didn’t think women should be flying, and certainly not military aircraft. When the WASPs were in a parade (I think it was in Boston) both men and women threw things at them in protest to them flying. The WASPs did a huge and great service for our country and the military but didn’t get credit for it. If asked if they would serve again, knowing they wouldn’t get acknowledged and would be treated poorly by some, I believe they would all say, “Yes, sign me up!” They were patriotic and wanted to serve our country.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Mary’s Reading\n\nMary is giving away either a paperback (USA Only).

The book crosses spying with Lobster catching, what’s not to love!\n\nHave you read any that have come before this one? This is #6 in the series already! All can stand alone.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Candice’s Story\n\nWhat did you learn about yourself while writing this book?\n\nI learned that God is so vital to my writing. I knew this already, of course, but more so with this book. I’ve never written a WWII-era story and I knew that I had to give my very best to the manuscript or I would fail miserably. I prayed over this manuscript more so than any other, and I was amazed at how God provided in so many areas during the journey. That’s what I love most about Christian Fiction. Whether you’re a reader or a writer, God is in the midst.\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nYes! While researching the SPARs, I discovered that the military reached out to Dorothy C. Stratton and asked her to consider directing the reserve. I believed there had to be something special about her that made them go to her, so I began diving deeper into her life. She was a fascinating, highly-intelligent woman with a rich background who could command and stand up for what was right while being a classy lady at the same time. She was the essence of the SPARs, and I knew right away she needed to be in my book. I adore the interaction she has with Shirley (the heroine) and Dorothy soon became one of my favorite characters.\n\nWhy did you choose the geographical location in which your book is set?\n\nThough I’ve never lived anywhere other than Indiana, Maine is the home of my heart. Therefore, many of my books are set in Maine. I chose this location for a WWII-era story because when my agent called to let me know about the opportunity for the Heroines of WWII collection, I had just finished writing the first draft of a contemporary story set in Maine that revolved around the lobster industry. I had researched that subject so deeply it was branded on my brain, and I knew I wouldn’t have enough time to research anything else thoroughly enough to create a proposal before the deadline. I started wondering if I could somehow tie lobstering with a WWII-era home front story and before long, I had a plot that coupled lobstering with espionage.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Candice’s Reading\n\nCandice is giving away either a paperback (USA Only).

In particular, the courageous women working in the munitions industry, making shells, packing them with TNT, and making propellant for ammunition. Extremely dangerous work, but most of the women were patriots and their work literally changed the direction of the war for Britain toward victory. I’ve wanted to write about them, and As Dawn Breaks gave me that chance.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about writing this book?\n\nI wrote this novel during the outbreak of Covid-19, and the sudden quarantine that most of us experienced. My own family lives on the other side of the country and I wasn’t able to see them during this time, so writing about the fictional Baird family in my story and my heroine’s longing for a real home made it special for me.

Though this is Patricia’s first novel, she’s not a stranger to being an author, and her use of Sherlock Holmes quotes has me intrigued! Welcome, Patricia, to the Index!\n\nColorado , Denver , Rocky Mountains , 1920s , 1900-1930 (US Early American), Roaring Twenties , Clergy, Teacher , Amateur Detective, Non-White Main Characters, Orphan/Loner , Mystery, Returning to Hometown, Upstairs/Downstairs , Racial Discrimination, Secrets , Raybon-Patricia\n\nAll That is Secret\n\nFrom award-winning author Patricia Raybon comes a compelling new historical mystery series, a riveting puzzle about a young Black theologian–and Sherlock fan–trying to solve her father’s cold-case murder in a city ruled by the KKK.\n\nIt’s the winter of 1923 and Professor Annalee Spain―a clever but overworked theologian at a small Chicago Bible college–receives a cryptic telegram calling her home to Denver to solve the murder of her beloved but estranged father.\n\nFor a young Black woman, searching for answers in a city ruled by the KKK could mean real danger. Still, with her literary hero Sherlock Holmes as inspiration, Annalee launches her hunt for clues, attracting two surprising allies: Eddie, a relentless young orphan boy searching for his missing father, and Jack, a handsome young pastor who loves nightclub dancing and fast cars–awakening Annalee’s heart to the surprising highs and lows of romance and love.\n\nWith their help, Annalee follows clues that land her among Denver’s powerful elite. But when her sleuthing unravels sinister motives and long-buried lies, will clever Annalee become a victim, too?\n\nPatricia’s Website\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Patricia’s Story\n\nWhat inspired this story?\n\nFirst, I love clergy mysteries—Father Brown by G. K. Chesterton, Grantchester, and the like. My hope was to introduce a faith character in Colorado—a beautiful “sunshine” place, and my home state, but during one of its darkest times, the 1920s. Good fiction needs a threat element, even if it’s only hovering in the background. So that’s how I used the Klan in my mystery. The story’s foreground centers not on the Klan, but on my lead character—a young Black theologian who’s a fan of Sherlock Holmes—whose amateur sleuthing to solve her father’s murder is impacted at every turn by the threat of the Klan. I hope it makes for good tension.\n\nWhich scene is your favorite, the one you never tired of working with? Give us a reason to look forward to it.\n\nMy lead character—the young theologian—has a love interest, a handsome young pastor. I loved writing their scenes together: their meet-cute, their facing danger together (as he teaches her to drive his car while they’re being shot at), their first kiss, big blowup argument, his coming to her rescue, their hopeful reconnection for the future (book 2). As I learned, the love archetype in a novel isn’t just for romance. The love archetype is a helping character—the person who cares more than anyone else about the well-being of the lead character, so he bends over backward to try to help her in ordinary life and in their adventure together. As it turns out, helping is a powerfully romantic thing to do.\n\nIn my real life, the day after I met a young man, he came over to my apartment to help repair the manifold on my car. A few months later, we were married—and we’ve been married now for forty-plus years. So I loved finding ways for my novel’s love interest to show help and concern—and I loved writing those scenes.\n\nWere there any historical facts that you discovered in your research that made you change something in your story?\n\nWith regard to the Colorado Klan of the 1920s, the big surprise was how many white citizens actively resisted it. For research, I scoured countless historical newspapers from the Colorado Historic Newspapers site and listened to hours of oral histories available digitally from the Denver Public Library’s Digital Collections, both true treasures. Both shed light on “the story behind the story” of the Klan—that while it became a powerful political bloc in Colorado, with the state having the second-largest Klan membership per capita than any state in the US, with leaders from the Colorado governor to county sheriffs as dues-paying members, many ordinary Klan members felt pressure to join, ditching the organization the second it started to fall out of favor.\n\nOpponents included prominent citizens, of course, but also countless nameless citizens who simply didn’t buy into the hype.\n\nThe whole Klan trajectory in Colorado teaches us about the mundane nature of homegrown hate and how it can take root—but also how good people help it die.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Patricia’s Reading\n\nPatricia is giving away a paperback, US entrants only.

What did you enjoy most about writing the book?\n\nThe hardest aspect of writing Shiloh was also the one I most enjoyed—moving main characters Ian Cameron and Seona, along with several others from the first Kindred book, Mountain Laurel, from North Carolina to the village of Shiloh, the setting of my debut novel, Burning Sky, on the New York frontier. By doing so I was able to revisit the characters from that earlier novel twelve years beyond the point where it ended, as well as continuing Ian and Seona’s story begun in Mountain Laurel. Weaving those two story-worlds together was painstaking work, requiring many drafts of huge chunks of the book. While Shiloh is primarily a sequel to Mountain Laurel, I wanted to do more than give a few characters from Burning Sky a cameo appearance. I wanted them to be integral to the storyline without overshadowing Ian and Seona’s continuing journey. Being as close to both sets of characters as I naturally am as their creator, I’m thankful for my editing team at Tyndale for helping me find the right balance and a satisfying conclusion to multiple story threads. I couldn’t be more pleased or proud of how we pulled this off.\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nI did, and he’s a gem of a character, too. Since it was partly Last of the Mohicans (the book and latest movie version) that ignited my interest in the New York frontier years ago, I was thrilled to discover that author James Fenimore Cooper had a father who was instrumental in settling vast tracts of the New York frontier during the 1790s, the time of Shiloh’s setting. William Cooper rose from a humble wheelwright to become a successful merchant, land speculator, and a politician. He founded Cooperstown in the 1780s and spent the next decades working to entice men to take up farms across the surrounding countryside and elsewhere in New York, including some tracts north of the Mohawk River. Because of a wonderful book called William Cooper’s Town by Alan Taylor it was possible to place the elder Cooper in the path of Ian Cameron when he was on the move north, in search of a new place to settle. And of course I couldn’t resist giving his inspiring author son, James, a cameo in the story, even though he was only a little boy at the time\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Lori’s Reading\n\nLori is giving away TWO SETS of this series in paperback, US entrants only.

What kind of people once populated the community? Who were the last to live there? What loneliness did they suffer? Joanne brings us the story of a young mother whose husband disappears, leaving her to fend for herself in a threadbare mining town. Welcome to the Index, Joanne!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Joanne’s Story\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about writing this book?\n\nMost definitely the real-life research! This was the first time that I got to explore the geography of a setting while writing the story and it’s all captured on video for readers to get a sense of Kenworthy and the heart behind the story.\n\nWhy did you choose the geographical location in which your book is set?\n\nThe Gold in These Hills is set about 20 minutes from my home town in California. Once I discovered that there used to be a gold mine and ghost town nearby, I quickly realized that it would be the perfect place for this story to reside. Not only is the real historical events shrouded in mystery, but because of that, the story is too.\n\nDid you stumble upon anything in your research for this book that you thought was strange or surprising?\n\nYes! While researching the gold mining town of Kenworthy, California, I discovered that the reason why the boom town soon vanished, was because the mine held no gold—instead, prospectors had taken a worthless mine and salted it: loading gold dust into a shot gun and firing it off inside the mine. They found a wealthy businessman, Herold Kenworthy, who purchased the mine and eventually spent $50,000 to build the town and within five years, only made about $10. It’s a sad story for sure, and is what sparked The Gold in These Hills, as I suddenly longed to unravel the story behind all of that and dig into what motivated the characters to be a part of this historic event.\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Joanne’s Reading\n\nYou can check out this cool Mercantile Giveaway on Joanne’s website, but first, enter the rafflecopter below for a copy of Joanne’s book!\n\nJoanne is giving away a paperback, US entrants only.

Yes, please! Tracy Higley is here to tell us about her new series, The Time Travel Journals of Sahara Aldridge. Welcome to the Index, Tracy!\n\nEgypt, Italy , Foreign Setting (Not USA or England), Roman Empire , 0060s, 1920s , 0031BC-476AD (Roman Empire), 1900-1930 (US Early American), 1900s Foreign, Multiple Time Periods, Roaring Twenties , Archaeologist , Suspense, Time Travel , Higley-TL\n\nA Time to Weep\n\nSometimes the only way forward is back.\n\nSahara Aldridge, a young Egyptologist in 1922, is chasing down the trail of her parents through the unknown corridors of time.\n\nBut when all clues point to Ancient Rome as the next place to search, Sahara retreats into the safety of her archaeological work, cataloguing treasures from the newly-discovered tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun.\n\nAs the discovery of the intact tomb propels the world into a frenzy of “Tut-mania,” the ever-present Jack Moretti is there to help, but what is his agenda?\n\nAnd it appears Tempus Vigilia isn’t going to leave her alone. The secret society has sent others, tracking her movements and asking too many questions.\n\nNow it seems her family is in danger. Sahara must once again put her career on hold, to find what she has lost. But will Ancient Rome hold the answers, or only one more reason to grieve?\n\nTracy’s Website\n\nOther books in this series:\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Tracy’s Story\n\nWhat inspired this story?\n\nI’ve been a Downton Abbey fan since the show premiered. When I learned that Highclere Castle, the real estate where the show was filmed, was actually the home of Lord Carnarvon, who funded the discovery of King Tut’s tomb, I thought what fun it would be, to set part of a story there on the “Downton Abbey set,” and part of it at the digsite in Egypt. Mix in a little time-travel, which I’ve been wanting to write more of for years, and this series was born!\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about writing this book?\n\nSince most of my other books have been strictly historical, with the occasional contemporary storyline, writing this book set partially in the ancient past, but also partially in the 1920s, was really fun for me. I’d never done much research into the 1920s, so researching the clothes, the music, the cars, and even the golden age of archaeology was really enjoyable for me!\n\nDid you include a real historical character or incident in your story?\n\nThis book is chock-full of historical characters! Sahara works on the digsite with Howard Carter, who discovered King Tut’s tomb, and his patron, Lord Carnarvon, who lived at Highclere Castle in England. Then we have Sahara heading back in time to ancient Rome, where she meets up with a whole cast of historical characters, including the crazy Emperor Nero!\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nQuestions about Tracy’s Reading\n\nTracy is giving away an e-book copy.
