        "text": "Quick Links\n\nTim Curry\n\nDiego Luna\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nMatthew Morrison\n\nJames Franco\n\nEric McCormack\n\nKerr Smith\n\nEric Stonestreet\n\nArmie Hammer\n\nRichard Jenkins\n\nPeter Sarsgaard\n\nJared Leto\n\nJonathan Rhys Meyers\n\nFinn Jones\n\nNelsan Ellis\n\nWhile we don't care who sleeps with who where or when, we do care about celebrities, especially those that are actors or actresses. Whenever folks ask if an actor identifies as homosexual, bisexual, or instantly, you often listen people say, \"Does it matter?\" Well, that depends. Will it trade our opinion of the individual? No. Do we, as the celebrity-obsessed public, wish to know about celebrities' private lives? Yeah, kinda. There are entire channels dedicated to presentations about movie star lifestyles. Of route, folks care. We need to know the whole lot about celebrities, and that includes their love lifestyles.\n\nIf the big name has mentioned it, we're going to touch upon it. We don't presume to know the rest as opposed to what the actors themselves have addressed, so unless we ignored something, each and every classification on this record is in line with what the actor has said. Now, one thing we spotted about lists like this that debate the sexuality of stars is that there appears to be an either-or stanceâboth the actor is immediately or homosexual, with nothing in-between. Well, since we're not giant lovers of bi-erasure, each and every actor on this list considers themselves heterosexual. No Andy Dick, David Bowie, or another bisexual actor is integrated (unless they're closeted bisexual, and we're none the wiser).\n\nReally, what we're coping with lately is public belief. Whether it is because of the actor's incredible performances, rumors, or simply one thing concerning the actor's persona or mannerisms, folks believe the actors and actresses on this checklist to be gay. They don't seem to be. There is also the PR means of \"queerbaiting,\" which refers to an actor hinting that they is also homosexual so as to entice in a greater fanbase. This is extra common than you may think in Hollywood. It may be very efficient, which is why there may be so much discussion about the sexuality of sure stars. So, let's undergo some of the most mysterious or misunderstood actors in the business. Here are 15 Actors You Always Thought Were Gay Who Are Actually Straight.\n\nTim Curry\n\nTim Curry's sexuality has always been assumed however never actually confirmed. The actor is extremely non-public and questions on his non-public life were sidestepped for many years. Still, most people guessed that he was homosexual or bisexual as a result of his characters. Of direction, much of that comes from Dr. Frank N. Furter of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, one of the most famous and iconic characters in musical theater. Other characters, like Wadsworth from Clue, leaned gay without ever explicitly addressing it. Curry did, at one point, say that he used to be relaxed together with his sexuality, but the implication was once that he was once immediately however not afraid or ashamed of being noticed as gay.\n\nDiego Luna\n\nThroughout his occupation, Diego Luna has demonstrated that he is an unbelievable performer. We believe each single one in every of his characters. Perhaps, it is because of this that Luna has been rumored to be gay for moderately some time. It's now not true. He used to be married to a woman, and the only evidence we have of his non-public life is of the heterosexual selection. Still, his characters in Y Tu Mama Tambien with Gael Garcia Bernal and Milk with Sean Penn had been very, very convincing. Because other people see Luna on screen taking part in a homosexual persona, they believe it must be who he is in his everyday lifestyles. Nope, he is simply a superb actor.\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nRumors of John Travolta being gay have surrounded the actor for decades. While Travolta is also a closeted homosexual or bisexual, he has simplest ever denied these reports, so we will take his phrase for it. Some actors have had rumors like this around them which were confirmed false, whereas others eventually got here out, like Kevin Spacey. With Travolta, it sort of feels that it is all just communicate at this level. There had been accusations via men towards Travolta that claim the actor assaulted them, but Travolta suggests that these were extortion efforts and nothing more. Since 1991, Travolta has been married to the pretty Kelly Preston, so no matter he's doing is working.\n\nMatthew Morrison\n\nMatthew Morrison has a massive homosexual following who want the rumors that he is homosexual were true, however they're no longer. Despite playing the tremendous homosexual, albeit it sounds as if immediately, character of Will Schuster on Glee, Morrison is solely performing. He is married. When requested about it, Morrison mentioned, \"I know my own truth. Iâm in a great relationship with a woman. Maybe before, it used to bother me. Then I was like, 'This is so stupid that this bothers me. Some of my best friends in the world are gay, and if this is bothering me, then that means I have an issue with that.' Once I figured that out for myself, I thought, 'I donât care what anyone thinks about me.' Thatâs why I think Iâve become an ally for the gay and lesbian community. I just got [an Ally for Equality Award] the other day in Atlanta. Iâve very proud of my role in the community. So say what you will.\" Though Morrison once took it as a jab, seeing him as homosexual is a compliment to his performing. He used to be on moderately in all probability the gayest show on television and performed a very homosexual model of a directly guy. It's a logical step for people to no less than question it.\n\nJames Franco\n\nJames Franco has been homosexual on film a choice of occasions. He played homosexual characters in Milk, Howl, and Blind Spot. He's additionally played a bisexual in nearly every position, save maybe The Disaster Artist; and even that one is questionable. In real existence, Franco is just like the vast majority of his charactersâopen to the rest. Or no less than, that's what he would like us to consider. In the past, Franco has mentioned that he is \"kind of gay,\" but he later would clarify and describe himself as a \"tease.\" He is not homosexual and, by all accounts, has never been gay, but he's flirtatious and seems to revel in getting attention from everyone. By leaving the door open that he may well be homosexual, he additionally leaves the door open for more passion and a greater fan base.\n\nEric McCormack\n\nDespite the fact that Eric McCormack might have performed (and is as soon as once more playing) one of the most famous homosexual characters in the historical past of television on Will & Grace, he's in truth immediately. McCormack has been married to Janet Leigh Holden for more than 30 years now. He may be a main supporter and advocate of gay rights and the LGBT community. After Will & Grace went off the air, the rumors about McCormack's sexuality fizzled out a bit, but now that the show has returned, we be expecting there to be plenty of at a loss for words fanatics in the market once once more. This man is simply a nice actor taking part in a position that he is very at ease taking part in.\n\nKerr Smith\n\nKerr Smith will always be referred to as Gay Jack McPhee who had probably the most first gay onscreen kisses in TV historical past on Dawson's Creek. Now, it might shock folks, but Smith is not gay in actual existence. He was once married to Harmoni Everett for years, but they've since divorced. There were rumors at the time that James Vanderbeek from Dawson's Creek was gay as well, so perhaps this had one thing to do with the debate about Smith. Either approach, Smith (and/or Vanderbeek) never got here out of the closet, so it seems that they are both thankfully directly. One thing that has modified about Smith is that he now has a full head of silver, which looks superb. Gray however now not gay.\n\nEric Stonestreet\n\nWith the success of Modern Family, Eric Stonestreet has turn out to be a familiar face on our televisions. Although he's achieved different paintings, it's his position as Cameron Tucker that has been the function we all know him for. Now, since Cameron is gay and Stonestreet is so rattling excellent within the section, folks have simply assumed that he is homosexual. While that is a pretty well-known issue, meaning all the big lovers of Modern Family already know that Stonestreet is in fact heterosexual, it's nonetheless reasonably unknown to those that have only seen the show and no longer learn anything else about the actors. In the previous, Stonestreet has joked in regards to the misconception, saying that he's, in reality, \"openly straight.\" That being mentioned, Stonestreet is a giant supporter of the LGBT group and has embraced his role type status in the homosexual community.\n\nArmie Hammer\n\nYou might not be at the \"Armie Hammer is homosexual\" teach simply yet, but it exists, and it is only choosing up steam. Despite the fact that Hammer is thankfully married to the beautiful Elizabeth Chambers and has never hinted in his public or non-public life that he is gay, many consider that he is as a result of his performing. In fact, it comes down to 2 of his greatest roles. The first got here in the movie J. Edgar, by which Hammer played Clyde Tolson, a s*xual hobby of J. Edgar Hoover's. Most recently, we got the incredible efficiency from Hammer in Call Me through Your Name. Now, just because an actor plays a gay role, does not make him homosexual. But, Hammer is so rattling just right in these roles that it is sure to drum up some discussion. As the latter movie will get more attention this awards season, we are expecting more people will confuse appearing with real existence.\n\nRichard Jenkins\n\nRichard Jenkins has been married to the similar lady since 1969. That's almost 50 years of heterosexuality. Still, there are lots of other folks out there that have just approved Jenkins to be gay. Now, much of this belief is as a result of Jenkins has such a huge gay following. In Flirting with Disaster, he played a homosexual FBI agent with Josh Brolin and received a lot of consideration. He then were given concerned with Six Feet Under, which was once a groundbreaking display for homosexuality in mainstream tv. Even regardless that his persona used to be no longer homosexual within the show, it was once very important for the LGBT neighborhood. Now, Jenkins is touring the award circuit for his role in The Shape of Water. Even even though Jenkins isn't gay, we be expecting that the misunderstanding that he is homosexual will pick up relatively a bit over the following couple of months.\n\nPeter Sarsgaard\n\nFor close to a decade now, Peter Sarsgaard has been married to (*15*), however that hasn't ever stopped the homosexual rumors from swirling. Sarsgaard has played several gay characters in his lifestyles, possibly up to some other heterosexual actor. He performed homosexual in Kinsey, The Dying Gaul, and in The Mysteries of Pittsburgh. He was once even kind of gay in Boys Don't Cry and a number of other other movies. Now, when he's not enjoying gay, he's performed a super creepy man, so he's more than likely ecstatic that he's extra frequently flawed as homosexual than this his other function kind. Sarsgaard has always sought out diverse roles, so taking part in a gay man when he isn't is a challenge that he enjoys. He's additionally very well-spoken and proper and some people have a tendency to see these as homosexual qualities, for no matter reason why.\n\nJared Leto\n\nIt's to be expected that Jared Leto is considered gay within the public eye. Some of his greatest roles had been gay, or misunderstood as homosexual, reminiscent of Black and White, Alexander, and Dallas Buyers Club (a transgender lady). Now, Leto is slated to play Andy Warhol, any other gay guy, in an upcoming biopic. When requested about how he feels taking part in gay characters and if Hollywood is \"ready\" for a leading gay male actor, Leto stated, \"I definitely donât think a gay leading man would have the same opportunities as a straight leading man. I donât think that. Not for a single second,\" Leto said. \"I donât know if thatâs offensive or not, but thatâs my thought right now. It shouldnât be that way. I donât think youâll have as many opportunities. And I think you could say the same for minorities. What a word, minority. Have we taken that word off the list yet? âCause it should be. Anyway, no, I think that this is still a very conservative business.\"\n\nJonathan Rhys Meyers\n\nJohnathan Rhys Meyers has performed gay on TV and in film. He used to be homosexual in B. Monkey, Stonewall, and Velvet Goldmine. He was closeted in The Tudors and ambiguous in different roles. This is a guy who is so attractive and so apparently fluid in his sexuality that each gender is attracted to him, and Meyers likes it that manner. He's refreshingly open-minded about maximum of everything, especially with regards to who folks choose to go to bed with. He has a large gay following who are nonetheless retaining out hope that he comes out in the future. But, if it hasn't came about already, it doesn't look like it's going to ever happen.\n\nFinn Jones\n\nIt's all because of Loras Tyrell. Well, a little as a result of Danny Rand/Iron Fist as effectively, but most commonly on account of Loras Tyrell from Game of Thrones. Finn Jones used to be in order that convincing in that part. He played the position with such conviction. There was once both energy and femininity in his efficiency, a mixture that appeared very fair. This led many Game of Thrones fans to imagine that Jones should in fact be gay in real lifestyles. It's not true, however he claims to grasp and strengthen the LGBT neighborhood wholeheartedly. We admire him for that.\n\nNelsan Ellis\n\nIt was unhappy information remaining year to learn that Nelsan Ellis had passed away. The actor was once most effective 39 and gave the impression to have finally hit his stride within the performing international when he died. Ellis used to be absolute best identified for his portrayal of Lafayette on True Blood. It used to be also this persona that led to many to consider that Ellis used to be gay in real life. He wasn't, however he embraced the controversy. This is because for Ellis, the rumors have been the ultimate compliment for his portrayal of a gay man. Lafayette was once so convincing and cute that folks simply accepted that the actor used to be merely enjoying himself. For many, that was more straightforward than believing that Ellis was such a excellent actor. In truth, Ellis and Lafayette have been very other other people of their outward appearances.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; IMDB; Biogrpahy; Reddit: The Data Lounge\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2WsLW70axksJ1dlrm4rdisZKyto6WypMDEnWStp5%2BgeqJ50q2Yp5xf"
