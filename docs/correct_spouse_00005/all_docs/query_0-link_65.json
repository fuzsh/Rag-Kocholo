        "text": "Ever since Dawson's Creek premiered in 1998, the show became a favorite among fans and remains one of the most popular teen dramas to ever hit the small screen.\n\nThe series followed the life of Joey Potter (Katie Holmes), a tomboy who is just trying to make it through high school following the death of her mother. Luckily, she had best friend Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) and his sidekick, Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson). In the premiere episode, Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams) arrived in town — a new girl from New York City who not-so-seamlessly made her way into the group and changed everything. The series was created by Scream writer Kevin Williamson, who based the script off his own experiences growing up in a small town.\n\nOver the six seasons, many new characters came and went. Jen's grandmother, Grams (Mary Beth Peil), appeared in all six seasons. Brother and sister duo Jack and Andie McPhee, played by Kerr Smith and Meredith Monroe, respectively, joined in season 2. Dawson's parents, Mitch and Gale Leery (John Wesley Shipp and Mary-Margaret Humes) were also key parts of the show. For the final two seasons, Busy Philipps' Audrey Liddell joined as Joey's college roommate.\n\nThe show didn't shy away from hot topics, tackling everyday situations in a way shows hadn't done previously. In 2000, the show aired the first passionate same-sex kiss between two men — and it wasn't an easy task.\n\nScroll through the gallery below to see where the cast is today:"
