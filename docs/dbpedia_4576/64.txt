The Arch of Hadrian, Athens, Greece. Artist: Samuel Magal

The Arch of Hadrian, Athens, Greece. The Arch of Hadrian is a monumental gateway resembling a Roman triumphal arch. It has been proposed that the arch was built to celebrate the arrival of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and to honour him for his many benefactions to the city. It is not certain who commissioned the arch, although it is probable that the citizens of Athens or another Greek group were responsible for its construction and design.
