Hadrian's Arch, located in Athens, a significant ancient that you can visit while having a tour on one of our Greece Travel Packages and a monument that dates back to the 2nd century AD. Here are the key details about the Hadrian Arch:

The Hadrian Arch was built to honor the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who visited Athens in 131-132 AD during his extensive travels through the Roman Empire. The arch is made of Pentelic marble and spans an ancient road that led from the center of Athens to the Olympieion (the Temple of Olympian Zeus). It consists of a single monumental archway with Corinthian columns and is adorned with reliefs and inscriptions.

The Hadrian Arch served both a practical and symbolic purpose. It marked the boundary between the old city of Athens and the new Roman city that Hadrian envisioned. It also symbolized the gratitude of the Athenians towards Hadrian, who was a great admirer of Greek culture and philosophy.

Today, Hadrian's Arch stands near the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the historic district of Plaka in Athens. Despite centuries of wear and damage, it remains largely intact, showcasing the architectural prowess and cultural integration of the Roman period in Greece.
