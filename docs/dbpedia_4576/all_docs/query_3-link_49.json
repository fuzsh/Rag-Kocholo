        "text": "Everything you need to know about spending 3 days visiting Athens, Greece including what to see, do, and eat.\n\nSteeped in ancient history and the birthplace of democracy, Athens is filled with historic landmarks, cultural experiences, and delicious food!\n\nGreece has been on our bucket list for a long time and with my daughter having a huge interest in Greek Mythology we knew now was the perfect time to visit. We spent four nights and three days in an Airbnb in Athens at the base the Acropolis Hill. I feel like this was the perfect home base to visit the city from because we were close to everything that we wanted to see and a variety of restaurants.\n\nWith so much to see in Athens, here is a list of some of the top things to do and see along with additional ideas to fill out your trip.\n\nThings to See in Athens\n\nAcropolis – Pantheon\n\nThe most famous and significant ancient site in the Western world is the Acropolis. This is the site of the architectural masterpiece, the Pantheon which can be seen from all over Athens. Dedicated to Athena, the patron goddess of the city, the Pantheon was built between 447 and 432 B.C. On the top of the Acropolis are several other major sites besides the Pantheon including the Erechtonius, the Temple of Athena Nike, and the Propylaea. On the south slope of the Acropolis Hill are a couple of other sites to see including the Theatre of Dionysos and the Theatre of Herodes Atticus.\n\nIt takes about 10 minutes to walk up from the base of the Acropolis to the top. While there are many paths that lead up, the only entrance (and ticket office) is located on the western end of the hill. Be sure to come prepared by wearing appropriate shoes (paths are steep and uneven) and because it gets very hot at the top bring sunscreen, a hat, and water. There are WCs and water fountains inside the ticketed area.\n\nAncient Agora\n\nThe Ancient Agora was the social and commercial center of ancient Athens where people like Socrates and Plato would have spent time. Very little remains from the original Agora except for the well-preserved Temple of Hephaistos and the rebuilt stoa which now houses a museum.\n\nRoman Forum\n\nThe Roman Forum is an ancient marketplace with rows of columns framing the former piazza. The mosque located in the forum is one of the oldest and best-preserved Ottoman structures. The intact Tower of the Winds built in the 1st century BC has carved reliefs that depict human personifications of the 8 winds of Athens. You can see both the ancient marketplace ruins and the tower from outside the fence and do not have to enter the forum unless you want to.\n\nHadrian’s Library\n\nLocated in Agoa Square is Hadrian’s Library built in the 2nd century AD. It was once a cultural center in Athens with a library, art gallery, and lecture halls.\n\nMonastiraki Square\n\nOne of the main squares in Athens, Monastiraki Square has a flea market nearby, the 12th-century Byzantine church, the Church of the Virgin, and Souvlaki Row with lots of shops to get souvlaki (grilled, skewered meat). The square also has Athens’s original train station built in the 19th century, Monastiraki Metro Station.\n\nWhile you should always be aware of pickpockets in the touristy and busy areas of Athens, Monastiraki Square is notorious for pickpockets.\n\nTemple of Olympian Zeus and Arch of Hadrian\n\nHadrian Arch was built in AD 131 by the Roman emperor Hadrian to celebrate the completion of the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Its grand archway faces Vasilissis Amalias Avenue and marks the dividing line between the ancient city and Hadrian’s new “Roman” city. The Temple of Olympian Zeus is located just beyond the Arch. The 15 remaining standing columns out of the original 104 are what is left of the largest temple in ancient Greece. It took almost 700 years to complete this temple.\n\nSyntagma Square and the Tomb of the Unknown Solider\n\nThis public space, Syntagma Square, is where the changing of the guard for the Tomb of the Unknown Solider happens five minutes before the hour, every hour. The parliament building, once the royal palace, faces the square and is the spot where King Otto agreed to change from a monarch to a democratic government.\n\nAnafiotika\n\nThe area of Anafiotika is a charming village on the edge of the Acropolis with white-washed houses and narrow lanes. Start at the Church of St. George of the Rock and start winding your way upwards following the signs to the Acropolis. This neighborhood was originally built by people from the Cycladic island of Anafi.\n\nLittle Kook\n\nLittle Kook is a dessert cafe with over-the-top decorations both inside and outside. They change the decorations based on the time of the year that you visit. It has become one of the most Instagrammable places in Athens.\n\nMore Options\n\nNational Archaeological Museum\n\nThe National Archaeological Museum has the world’s best collection of ancient Greek artifacts from 7000 BC to AD 500. It also has an Egyptian collection worth seeing. The artifacts are arranged in chronological order and can be seen by following the numbered rooms. This museum is a little bit away from the rest of the tourist sites and you may want to use a taxi/Uber to get there.\n\nPanathenaic Stadium\n\nHome to the first modern Olympic games and the world’s only stadium made of marble, the Panathenaic Stadium is fantastic to see. For amazing views climb to the upper tier of stand #21, from there you will be able to see the Acropolis, the Parthenon, Filopappos Hill, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Zappeion, the National Gardens, and Lycabettus Hill.\n\nIf have time and want to continue touring Athens, consider adding more museums, such as the Acropolis Museum or the Museum of Cycladic Art. The Acropolis Museum showcases artifacts from the Acropolis and an extensive archaeological excavation site that lies beneath the building. The Museum of Cycladic Art preserves ancient cultures of the Aegean and Cyprus with special emphasis on Cycladic Art.\n\nOr consider taking a day trip from Athens. We visited Delphi on our trip to Athens and I highly recommend it. Delphi was an ancient religious sanctuary dedicated to Apollo and was considered the site of the center of the world. The sanctuary was home to the Oracle of Delphi and the priestess Pythia who foresaw the future.

This charming and quaint island has no cars and plenty to explore."
