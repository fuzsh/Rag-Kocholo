        "text": "Description\n\nGreek Jews played a very important role in early Christianity and Greek history. Their communities became a source of education and commerce in Byzantine and Ottoman-ruled Greece until their almost complete devastation during the Holocaust when Greece was invaded by Axis forces.\n\nBefore World War II, approximately 80,000 Jews lived in Greece in 31 different communities. By war’s end, only 10,000 Jews survived. Two-thirds of the Jewish population (approximately 55,000 Jews) lived in Saloniki. There are approximately 5,500 Greek Jews today living in Greece with 2,500 living in Athens and the rest spread out in other areas of Greece but with the highest concentration in Northern Greece.\n\nIn 1943, 46,091 Greek Jews from Thessaloniki were sent to Auschwitz. Only 1,950 survived. The Greek community and the Greek Orthodox church fervently tried to protect the Jewish community that was being hunted down by the Nazis during the Second World War. Some were saved and some escaped to cities that were under Italian Axis rule or to the United States.\n\nThe Jewish landmarks in Athens are the Ancient Synagogue in the Ancient Agora, the Beth Shalom Synagogue, the Etz Hayyim Synagogue built-in 1904, the Jewish Museum, the First Cemetery of Athens, the Cemetery and Monument for the Victims of the Holocaust, the Monument to Young Jews, the Jewish Elementary School, the Cultural Center of the Jewish Community and the Holocaust Monument.\n\nStart: Pick up from your hotel in Athens, address in Athens, or cruise ship pier at Piraeus port.
