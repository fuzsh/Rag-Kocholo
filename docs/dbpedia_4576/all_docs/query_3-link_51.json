        "text": "THE ACROPOLIS (0,5 KM)\n\nLocated on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens, the Acropolis (acro – edge, polis – city) is the most important site of the city and contains one of the most significant and recognizable monuments of the world, the Parthenon. This monument is an ancient building of great architectural and historic significance dedicated to Athens’ patron goddess Athena. It was built 2.500 years ago and is being surrounded by other temples. It is the most significant reference point of the ancient Greek culture, as well as the symbol of the city of Athens itself since it represents the apogee of the artistic development in the 5th century BC.\n\nTHE ARCH OF HADRIAN (0,2 KM)\n\nHadrian’s Arch was constructed in 131 AD. It was built to honor the Roman Emperor Hadrian for his many benefactions to the city. It is believed that the gateway was a boundary marker stating where ancient Greek Athens ended and the new Roman Athens began.\n\nTHE NEW ACROPOLIS MUSEUM (0, 3 KM)\n\nThe New Acropolis Museum is an archaeological museum focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis. This simple and precise museum was designed by Bernard Tschumi and Michael Photiadis. It consists of a total area of 21,000 square meters. The transparent glass used is really impressive, since all the excavations can be seen from there. The new Museum offers more than 4.000 exhibitions, which will make you feel ‘on top of the world’ and at the same time incredibly small. Thus, this is a unique historical “place to be”.\n\nTHEATRE OF HERODES ATTICUS (0, 5 KM)\n\nThis monument was built in 161 AD by the Athenian magnate Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, Regilla. Herodes Atticus (A.D.101-177) was a Greek philosopher, rhetorician and a teacher. What was also known is that he was a renowned offspring of an important Athenian family and a benefactor, who contributed to adorn Athens.\n\nTEMPLE OF OLYMPIAN ZEUS (0,3 KM)\n\nThe massive temple of Olympian Zeus was built 1.500 years ago. As the name suggests, it was dedicated to Zeus. The temple housed the renowned statue of Zeus, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The Chryselephantine (gold and ivory) statue was constructed by the sculptor Phidias in his workshop on the site of Olympia.\n\nANCIENT AGORA (0,7 KM)\n\nThe Agora was the heart of ancient Athens. In this open square, citizens could assemble for a wide variety of purposes. On any given day the space could be used as a market, or as an election field, a dramatic performance, a religious procession, a military drill, or an athletic event. Here political, social, cultural, and religious activities had all found a place together. Additionally, in the Agora the concept of democracy was first developed and practiced.\n\nROMAN AGORA (0,5 KM)\n\nThe Roman Agora (Market of Caesar and Augustus) is located on the north side of the Acropolis, just between Monastiraki and Plaka. It was built between 19 and 11 B.C, with a donation of of Julius Caesar and Augustus. During Roman Times, it was the center of commercial activity of the city. Not only that, the place at the time was full of shops and offices.\n\nPANATHENAIC STADIUM (0,7 KM)\n\nThe Panathenaic Stadium also known as Kallimarmaro is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble and one of the main attractions of Athens. It was primarily for hosting the Panathenaic Games, one of the largest ceremonies in the ancient Greece, in which fair play took part. Although, the stadium was ruined and lost, this wasn’t the end for it. In the year of 1870 in was rediscovered, under an excavation. Later, after being refurbished, it accommodated the first modern Olympics in 1896.\n\nHELLENIC PARLIAMENT (0,7 KM)\n\nThe Parliament is located in Syntagma Square and is characterized by the Evzones of the Presidential Guard. This massive building was established only in 1840. Initially, it served as the palace of Prince Otto. Onwards, due to have been severely damaged, it underwent several restorations and finally came to accommodate the Greek Parliament in 1929.\n\nTHE NATIONAL GARDEN (0,5 KM)\n\nThe best place to escape from the city and enjoy some peaceful time is the National Garden, created in 1839. Since, it is only a few meters from Syntagma metro station and next to the Greek Parliament, it can be easily accessed.\n\nFILOPAPPOU HILL (1 KM)\n\nThe best view of Athens and a breathtaking view of the Parthenon can be acquired from this Hill, without question! The Saronic Gulf and the Argolic Gulf can also be seen from the hill top. The hill is named after a monument (an ancient Greek mausoleum) erected at the top of it in honor of the Roman senator Filopappos.\n\nMONASTIRAKI (0,7 KM)\n\nMonastiraki is a flea market neighborhood in the old town of Athens, and is one of the principal shopping districts in Athens that extends from Monastiraki square to Thission. Some of the buildings there are dated back to Byzantine and Ottoman period. This area is home to antique and collectable shops, souvenir stalls, jewellery and handicrafts stores,and a major tourist attraction for Athens."
