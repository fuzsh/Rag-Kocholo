        "text": "Plaka is considered the most romantic neighborhood of Athens and you can see the Acropolis from various angles just strolling through the streets. The shadow of this magnificent monuments falls over old and new buildings, over the temples and the ruins, the cafes and restaurants, the shops and stalls. Lysicrates monument on a central street is one of the best preserved monuments in Athens and is a landmark in the area. The impressive Tower of the Winds, or Aerides as it is called in Greek, stands out for its beautiful frieze depicting the different winds. The temple of Olympian Zeus, dedicated to the father of all the ancient Greek gods, is an impressive structure which still exudes power and magnificence. Hadrians Arch, on the western side of the temple of Zeus, was built in 131 A.D. by the Athenians as a triumphal arch in honor of the great Roman Emperor Hadrian, benefactor of the city. The Theatre of Dionysus, right below the Acropolis, played an important role in the entertainment of ancient Athens. The Ancient Agora, with the renowned Attalus Stoa, includes a complex structure of buildings, which in ancient times were used to deposit the state archives. The temple of Hephaestus in Thission, built in Doric style, is dedicated to the ancient Greek god of fire and Athena, goddess of wisdom. The churches of Saint Nicholas Ragavas and Metochion of the Holy Sepulcher are of great historical interest\n\nAdvertisement"
