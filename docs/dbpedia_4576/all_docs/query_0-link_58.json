        "text": "As you leave the Temple of Olympian Zeus, or the Olympieion, the Arch of Hadrian becomes is visible just a short distance away, standing tall and proud, pristinely preserved through its nearly nineteen hundred years of existence, an extraordinary feat for any ancient monument. You probably know a lot about Hadrian's love of all things Greek, and his impact on Ancient Greek structural development during the Roman years by now. However, opinions collide on whether the Arch was commissioned by Hadrian himself, or if the Athenians or a group called Panhellenes erected the Arch in Hadrian's honor, to celebrate his arrival in Athens, in the early 2nd century AD. The latter seems more likely, according to historians and archaeologists.\n\nThe Arch was made of Pentelic marble, its columns designed in the Corinthian style, giving it a distinct grace and beauty. That is owed to the ornate nature of the Corinthian style, containing elaborate carvings of scrolls or leaves, and fluted columns. A fluted column is one with small, shallow grooves running along its length.\n\nOn the Arch there are two inscriptions, which have created a lot of speculation as to how they can be interpreted. On one side of the Arch, the inscription says \"this is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus\". On the other side, the inscription reads: \"This is the city of Hadrian, and not of Theseus\".\n\nTheseus was the mythical king and founder of Athens, son of a mortal woman and Poseidon, god of the sea. Theseus completed many heroic acts, slaying monsters and fighting for what was right and just, and was the one to slay the Minotaur that dwelled in the depths of the labyrinth that King Minos of Crete had built. Legend has it that Theseus escaped the Labyrinth with the help of princess Ariadne, who gave him a ball of yarn to mark his way. Having to leave Ariadne behind upon returning to Athens, Theseus, in his distress, forgot to lift up the white sails that would signal he was alive, as his father, King Aegeas had asked him, and raised the black sails, which meant he had died. In this confusion and misunderstanding, the grieving Aegeas committed suicide by throwing himself into the sea. This was how the Aegean sea got its name.\n\nSome say the inscriptions indicated the division of the city into the ancient, Greek part, and the newer, Roman part. Others claim it was simply a way to consolidate Hadrian's dominion as Emperor. No matter what, it will always remain a landmark and a reminder of one of the more beloved and peaceful Roman Emperors to have ever ruled Athens.\n\nLink to the Image: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pelican/3918762779/in/photolist-6YhFDv-94F9hP-4e1xgo-5qwH8i-a3tUYU-9hEJJ8-bNiooB-6s3xM2-Aozjrh-a5cgU3-98MSR9-9i1GNC-o6xAqb-6Zog2R-98JLcT-cc6GFy-cc6GqC-g8KhGd-4uVp51-g8KbTF-pJRXn9-pZ6Az1-a82rUT-6HRygb-oRQWVT-g8KnVQ-ecHsHC-g8Kjuy-9GcFQD-g8KPYF-g8K7WU-dPwGM-autPdX-g8KXmM-iVpoQ-auwwWq-p9kc9i-ecBPnT-55o2ZN-autPBZ-ecHsc1-ecHtJy-bNiee6-aEsLNB-rB4h9G-6HMDSc-cmroph-cmr8Hy-7UG21n-4CH4BT"
