        "text": "Travel allows you to witness many magnificent engineering and architectural structures. Some of the most prominent landmarks you will see in many cities around the world are huge monumental arches standing proudly. These are called triumphal arches, also known as memorial or honorific arches. It seems almost every country has one or more of these arches to commemorate events or individuals of great significance. Such as, battles won, soldiers lost, religious milestones, the royal family or royal visits, unification, and independence.\n\nThe world’s love of triumphal arches is something I find quite fascinating because each one has a remarkable story behind it. As well as telling a story they were also used to mark conquered territory.\n\nI’m going to share some information about them and show you some of the famous triumphal arches, and some you may not have heard of, to inspire you to see them on your travels around the world. It’s interesting to visit these grand monuments when going to a new place. They don’t take a lot of time, are usually conveniently located and are free to visit.\n\nAll through the ages, and across the globe, these architectural structures have been erected after hugely important events or milestones, to commemorate grand achievements or triumphs, hence the name triumphal arch. It’s a proud statement piece of the city and the nation, gracing the landscape to show the world.\n\nIn many cases the arch doesn’t really have a definite purpose as such, other than being ornamental.\n\nIn some instances the arch provides a formal gateway to the city.\n\nOften it’s a central landmark standing all on its own in the middle of the city. However, sometimes they have been built in ridiculous places, such as in the middle of a huge roundabout, like the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nAs well as being a huge decorative feature, the triumphant arch has become an iconic tourist attraction that people flock to see and photograph.\n\nTriumphal arches were first built during ancient Rome to celebrate triumphant warriors, and symbolise power and greatness.\n\nThere are dozens of Roman arches still in existence around the world, remnants of the Roman Empire in Europe, Africa and Asia. Some of these are Trajan Arch in Algeria, Arch of Galerius in Greece and Arch of Hadrian in Jordan.\n\nThere were once 36 triumphal arches in ancient Rome, but only 3 of them exist in Rome today. They are Arch of Titus, Arch of Septimius Severus and Arch of Constantine, all found in the Roman Forum, Italy.\n\nMost triumphal arches built after the Roman era have been modelled on Roman arches.\n\nThe world really does love triumphal arches, as you can see, both old and new, traditional and modern.\n\nToday triumphal arches are used for events and processions, and of course are major tourist attractions. They are normally free to visit and walk around. So be sure to check them out up close.\n\nSome, like the Arc de Triomphe, have public access to the top of the arch, for a small fee."
