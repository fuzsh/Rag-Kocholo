        "text": "Greece, more specifically Athens, is considered the birthplace of Western Civilization. Arriving in the city well after dark in mid-summer, we sipped wine from a rooftop bar while looking at the Parthenon sitting on the Acropolis. It is a stunning sight that gives you a sense you are in the land of the ancients.\n\nAthens is a city of approximately 700,000 which has all the sights, smells and feel of Greece. Located on the southern edge of the Aegean Sea, the weather is warm in the summer and temperate in the winter months. Staying near the town’s historic center allows easy access to the ancient ruins as well as a bevy of shops and eateries. The people of Athens are very friendly and the food is bountiful and delicious. Many family-owned restaurants offer a wide variety of food and drink.\n\nAscending the well worn path of the Acropolis on the way to the Parthenon gives a real sense of just how old the stone walkway is and how many millions of people have followed that same path over the last 2,000 years.\n\nUpon reaching the Parthenon, the view of Athens below and the surrounding mountains is surreal. How such a formidable stone structure could have been designed, built and still be standing some 2,000 years later almost defies belief.\n\nBesides the Parthenon, there are also a number of other notable ruins easily accessible in the historic district. Hadrian’s Arch, The Temple of Olympian Zeus and a host of others all sit intermingled among apartments and small villas making it easy to see the sites as well as day-to-day Greek living.\n\nJump on an airplane or boat and head 171 miles southeast of Athens and you will find yourself among the brightly painted houses and shops of the island of Santorini. The island was formed by volcanic eruptions 3,500 years ago. The caldera of the volcano can easily be seen from the hills of Santorini and makes for an interesting day trip on one of the many tour boats.\n\nIt is difficult to put into words how brilliant the colors and contrasts are on Santorini. The ocean is a deep blue. The sand on the beaches is black and the stuccoed homes and churches are often painted a bright white, aqua blue or peach to help reflect the sun.\n\nFood on the island is fresh, plentiful and very affordable at most venues. Like the food, lodging can be found for a very fair price. There are a number of family-owned motels, homes and rooms for rent on the island. Come before June or after August if you want to avoid the European summer crowds.\n\nTouring the mountain roads, towns and beaches by scooter is a great way to see the island. The roads are small and parking can be difficult to find in the larger villages, which makes two wheel transport a plus. There are countless little bars and restaurants with great views of the ocean all around the island. And the sunsets… they are an event every evening and can best be seen from the village of Oia (pronounced ee-a).\n\nIf you are looking for a faster, more party-like atmosphere, Mykonos may be for you. Just 80 miles from Santorini. Mykonos is known for its dance clubs, booming music and DJs. Celebrities and college students alike are drawn to the up-beat, ocean-side dusk to dawn atmosphere.\n\nBecause Mykonos is such a popular destination, expect to pay a bit more for food and lodging than other destinations in Greece. All in all visiting the Greek islands and mainland is a destination worth the effort."
