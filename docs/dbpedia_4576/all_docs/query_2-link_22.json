        "text": "Thursday, 16-04-2015 — Sunday, 19-04-2015.\n\nDay 239 — Day 242.\n\nOur day started in Barcelona with an early morning plane ride to Athens. The whole flight was fairly uneventful, although the seats the Vueling flight were pretty cramped. But by Noon we had landed in Athens, Greece.\n\nWe used a service called Welcome Pickups, a service that provides a taxi from the airport for a flat fee. As an additional feature, the driver speaks English and during the drive to the city will give you hints and tips about where to go and what to do. It’s a great service, and our driver, Alekos, gave us a lot of good tips for authentic Greek dishes (including local beers) to try.\n\nMuseum of the Acropolis\n\nWe read there was a free walking tour of Athens every day at 10:00 a.m., and we were planning on taking it the next morning. We had a little time after we got settled into our apartment, so we walked up to the Museum of the Acropolis to make sure we could find the yellow mailbox where the tour started.\n\nAs long as we were there, we decided to check the museum. When we visited, the building was relatively new. As they were building it, they stumbled across some ruins of an ancient Athenian neighborhood (which seems to happen a lot in Greece). But unlike other places, where they relocated the construction, they built the museum right on top of the ancient neighborhood. As you walk into the museum, you can see the remarkably preserved old neighborhood underneath your feet through a glass floor. It was pretty cool.\n\nThe west side of the Arch is inscribed with “This is Athens formerly the city of Theseus” while the east side reads “This is the city of Hadrian and not Theseus.” There’s some controversy over what this means, exactly. Some scholars believe it to be a dividing line between the old and new parts of the ancient city, while others believe it honored the unification of Athens under Hadrian’s rule.\n\nAfter a brief look at the Temple of Olympian Zeus (a place we would investigate on our own later), we walked to the Panathenaic Stadium, the world's only all-marble stadium and the location of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. It is named for the length of the stadium, which is about 185 meters.\n\nWe only got a glimpse of it from the outside, but we'd return to it later during out stay in Athens when we got the chance to run a lap on the track, which was pretty cool. The stadium is located on the site of an earlier ancient stadium dating back to 330 BC where nude male athletes competed.\n\nAt the far end of the track, there are some statues that are male busts on square columns. One of those columns, however has penises sticking out of it. I’m guessing this is a homage to the nude male athletes of yore. But it was really weird looking.\n\nA quick walk later had us looking at the Zappeion, a very Greek-style building where the first and only Intercalated Games were held in 1906.\n\nThese games, which had been in the planning since 1901, were created to fill the gap in the even years between Olympic Games. The idea never quite took off, and after a few years of planning the whole concept was abandoned (World War I was one of the contributing factors in its demise).\n\nBut even though the Intercalated Games never quite took off, the tradition of the Olympic Village, a tradition that continues to this day, started here.\n\nThe Evzoni wear the traditional uniform of an 1800s-era Greek infantryman. Their kilts are said to have 400 pleats, one for each year of Ottoman rule.\n\nLike London's Queen’s Guard and the palace guard in Seoul, these gentlemen don't move while on duty. You’re invited to take pictures with them, but a guard wearing modern fatigues guards the guards and will warn you if you get too close. Our guide told us he only saw one move once, and that was to give someone who was taking a selfie next to him a hard elbow. So don't take selfies with the Evzoni.\n\nThere’s an elaborate changing of the guard ceremony they do every Sunday. We were lucky enough to see it a few days later.\n\nThe last stop on our tour was at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, a 5,000 seat venue (an odeon, has a roof, but the roof here was destroyed in, again, 267) on the southern slope of the Acropolis. It dates back to the year 161. It was restored (somewhat) in the 1950s and since then has been the major venues venue for the Athens Festival, which takes place from May through October.\n\nAnd that was the end of the tour. We considered heading up to the Acropolis right after our tour ended since we were so close, but some of us were tired of walking, so we went down the hill where we met our new friend Katerina (who works at Welcome Pickups) and her two kids for some ice cream and an enjoyable afternoon.\n\nThe Acropolis\n\nThe next day we went back to the Acropolis, where, much to our surprise, we learned that admission was free that day.\n\nIt takes some walking to get up to the Acropolis, and that walk takes you past a number of excavated sites adjacent to the path that leads up the hill. The first major one visitors encounter is the Theatre of Dionysus."
