        "text": "How can I book flights for my tour?\n\nWhen booking online, you'll be offered the option to add flights once you've selected your travel dates and room type. You can add your cabin preferences when searching for your flight.\n\nAlternatively, you can get in touch with our team. Our Travel Experts or your local Travel Advisor will be able to assist with your requirements.\n\nCan I add additional hotel nights before or after my tour?\n\nMany guests choose to add extra hotel nights to spend a little more time in their chosen destination. You can reserve additional hotel nights before or after your tour once you've selected your preferred departure.\n\nAlternatively, you can get in touch with our team. Our Travel Experts or your local Travel Advisor will be able to assist with your requirements.\n\nWhere can I find room options?\n\nSelect your departure date, then review the available room options under the ‘Trip Overview’ section and choose the one that best suits your group. We have options for solo, twin and triple room configurations.\n\nIf you a traveling in a party of three adult guests, please note triple rooms may have a fold out bed, or limited space for three beds. If you prefer more individual space, you may prefer to book a single room and twin room for your group of three.\n\nHow much is the solo supplement?\n\nInsight Vacations tours are the perfect option if you're traveling solo, combining the camaraderie of a smaller group with the independence of a solo trip. Many tours offer solo room share options, or a competitive solo supplement.\n\nSelect your departure date and review your solo travel options in the ‘Trip Overview’ section.\n\nWhat is a definite departure?\n\nA departure is shown as 'Definite Departure' once it has reached a minimum number of guests. That particular departure will definitely run, barring any extraordinary circumstances. It is highly unlikely a departure won't meet the minimum number of guests. But if this is the case, you will be offered the best alternative dates or a full refund of any payment made.\n\nIf there are ever any changes to your departure, one of our Travel Experts will contact you.\n\nHow many guests will be on this tour?\n\nA personal experience is at the heart of what you can expect. Choose from 2 group sizes, where you’ll always enjoy dedicated attention and access to unique experiences thanks to all groups being smaller than the mainstream tour companies. With both group sizes you’ll travel on custom ‘Business Class’ style coaches that offer more leg room and larger window spans.\n\nChoose an average group size of just 33 travelers, capped at a maximum of 40 guests. These groups offer an enhanced experience versus larger mainstream tours of 50 or more.\n\nOr, choose an average of just 20 guests, capped at a maximum of just 24 guests, this choice is perfect if you prefer an even more individualized experience.\n\nChoose your preference at the top of the tour page or speak to one of our Travel Experts or your local Travel Advisor.\n\nHow much walking is involved on this tour?\n\nWith your comfort in mind, Insight Vacations assigns every tour an activity level. The activity level for your chosen tour is displayed in the tour introduction.\n\nLeisurely: Tours with typically 1-2 miles of walking per day on primarily flat surfaces and with some stairs.\n\nBalanced: Tours with up to 1-3 miles of walking per day, which may include some uneven surfaces such as cobblestones and stairs.\n\nDynamic: These journeys can feature 4+ miles of walking on some days and may involve some steep hills.\n\nHow can I apply my past guest discount?\n\nAs a valued past guest, you're eligible for a discount on your next booking through our loyalty program, Global Tour Rewards.\n\nYou will be asked to enter the details of your previous tour with Insight Vacations, or any of our Travel Corporation sister tour brands, during the booking process. Your past guest discount will then be applied automatically. You do not need to enter a code.\n\nWhat if I'm traveling in a group of 10+?\n\nWe have many options available for larger groups. You can select to reserve space for your entire group on one of our existing departures, book an entire departure out for your group, or our Groups Specialists can design a bespoke itinerary for you tailored to your group’s interests, and your budget.\n\nFind out more."
