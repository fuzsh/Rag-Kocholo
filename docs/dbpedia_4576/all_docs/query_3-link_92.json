Notice the Latin inscriptions on each side of the arch. The first one, facing Acropolis, says \"this is the city of Theseus\" while the other, turned towards the area constructed under Hadrian's reign, reads \"this is the city of Hadrian, not Theseus.\"\n\nMade of Pentelic marble, the arch is still well-preserved today and is popular among visitors as a great photo shoot location.",
