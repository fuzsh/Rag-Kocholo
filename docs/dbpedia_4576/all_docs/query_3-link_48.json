While the periods align with the historical chronological timeline to a great extent, it's important to note that the selection also takes into account significant architectural and city planning changes. Each period includes a list of monuments and areas. Within each monument, you will find a concise description and historical information, and its corresponding 3D reconstruction.\n\nPrepare yourself to explore the rich history of Athens as you immerse yourself in unique visuals and educational content.
