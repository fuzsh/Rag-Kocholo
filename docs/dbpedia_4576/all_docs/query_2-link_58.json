        "text": "Athens is much more than the ancient ruins like the Acropolis; it’s a melting pot of cultures forged by civilization that marked the city and the whole of Greece for centuries.\n\nWe had the pleasure of exploring cute corners, something special that inspired us to write this guide all about things to do in Athens besides the Acropolis.\n\nFrom fantastic food tours to alternative districts of Athens that you will not often find in the common guides. Athens guide beside the Parthenon is all you need to plan the perfect off the beaten path itinerary.\n\nAlternative Athens – Key Takeaway\n\nOf course, thinking about Greece’s Capital, you will immediately go with the mind to the popular historic Acropolis, the centrepiece of this fantastic depiction. As stunning as it is, you can’t truly experience the real Athens without venturing into the city’s hidden gems, from the fantastic hill of Filopappou, where to admire the ancient ruins, to the local gem of SNFCC, the newest cultural centre of Athens.\n\nWe walked along with our guides to discover the flavours and tales of the city, forging this guide with the 20 most interesting alternative sights of Athens that are not the Acropolis. String on your best walking shoes and get beyond the major tourist sights, from charming neighbourhoods to creative hubs. Read on for the best local tips to experience Athens like a real city insider.\n\n20 Things to do in Athens Besides the Acropolis\n\nIs Athens worth visiting?\n\nAbsolutely! Even with a limited time, Athens offers diverse attractions beyond Ancient monuments, from vibrant markets to contemporary galleries. Foodies will love the local cuisine, from street souvlaki to Michelin-star dining. With year-round mild weather, lively nightlife districts and affordable prices, Athens surpasses expectations.\n\nThings to do in Athens that are not the Acropolis\n\nThings to do in Athens for foodies\n\nSample traditional Greek food at Plaka\n\nNestled under the Acropolis lies the charming Plaka district. As one of Athens’ oldest residential areas, Plaka gives you a taste of traditional Greek life. It was impressive the people sitting at the bars and restaurants during the weekend. Planning a trip to Athens, you should get lost in its labyrinth of cobblestone alleyways and neoclassical houses.\n\nStop at tiny churches, poke around quirky shops filled with ceramics and jewellery, and admire remnants of ancient history, like sections of the ancient city wall. Don’t miss the Roman Agora with its Tower of the Winds. The ruins are in plain sight, and we include them in the list of free things to do in Athens.\n\nSignup for a Greek food tour\n\nThe best way to taste your way through Athens is to take a specialised Greek food tour. We were escorted all over the picturesque neighbourhoods of Monastiki and Plaka.\n\nEarly in the morning, we were attracted by the smells of fresh bread from local bakeries, signature bites and coffee. Sign up for a gastronomy tour with Alternative Athens, which will lead you to authentic eateries in neighbourhoods like Plaka, Psyrri or Keramikos, rarely visited by tourists, with Local guides.\n\nTry juicy grilled souvlaki, flaky Bulgatsa (Sweet and savoury) hot from the oven, rich Greek yoghurt drizzled with thyme honey, and sweet baklava pastries, all washed down with smooth local wine or coffee.\n\nBetween the stops, the guide will offer a glimpse into daily life in Athens as you wander off-the-beaten-path spots. Expect to walk away fully enlightened and already planning a return trip!\n\nOlive Oil tasting\n\nThe Olive Oil taste was our first stop on the gastronomy tour with Authentic Athens. Greek olive oil is renowned as some of the best in the world, and Greece accounts for 275,000 tons produced every year. While in Athens, visit Molotira, a speciality shop offering guided olive oil tastings that will leave your tastebuds rejoicing.\n\nSit down at a rustic wooden table and sample a flight of extra virgin olive oils derived from various regions around Greece. We appreciate the diverse aromas, flavours, and textures that range from peppery to buttery under the expertise of knowledgeable staff.\n\nBefore leaving, pick up a few bottles of the “green gold” or products like olive oil soap to bring some Greek goodness back home with you!\n\nEat at a Michelin Restaurant\n\nAs you get from the previous, most of the alternative things to do in Athens revolve around culinary heritage and cultural findings in the open air. Combining the both, you need to reserve your table at a Michelin Awarded Restaurant. One of our choices is the renowned Athenee.\n\nThe buzzing restaurant was Christmassy, with a fantastic atmosphere. Actually, Athens in winter is the perfect time to enjoy the city and take advantage of the favourite climate.\n\nThe top pick of my lunch was definitely the wine, the pasta with shrimp and their signature Christmas dessert buffet. Book in advance your brunch in Athens, as it gets filled quickly.\n\nGrab a coffee with the Acropolis view\n\nIf you made it here, you get that I love coffee, and most of our trips are around that. In Athens, it was the same, and the best to sip local coffee and the perfect Acropolis view. I enjoyed the moment. While walking along Ermou Street, you will find plenty of open-air cafes with views of the famed Acropolis. Climb up to the stone-paved neighbourhood of Anafiotika for the most iconic vantage point – its whitewashed houses and labyrinthine lanes evoke a Greek island village transplanted onto Athens’ hills.\n\nEnjoy a drink from the Hotel rooftop\n\nApart from sipping a Freddo cappuccino with the view of the Parthenon, another way to take in the cityscape is by having an evening drink on the rooftop bar or restaurant of a luxury Athens hotel. We stayed at the Electra Metropolis Athens Hotel, at 15 Mitropoleos str, right in the centre.\n\nOn the 10th Floor, you will have an open view of the Acropolis, perfect for sunset. Spending summer months in Athens, you can also take advantage of the glass pool.\n\nExplore Athens nightlife\n\nYou can’t visit Athens without enjoying the nightlife. I already had a glimpse of Greek attitudes and the joy of life in Thessaloniki and appreciate Athens a lot, too.\n\nWe did a self-guided nightlife tour, exploring three bars while in the city for the weekend. If you want to replicate our bar-hopping, clubbing, live music night, write down the following bars:\n\nJuan Rodriguez: Small but lively, with very affordable drinks and a nice atmosphere. It’s one of the most trendy bars in town, and you must book a table to secure entry.\n\nBartesera Athens: More chilled vibes than the previous, with signature drinks. My friends went for a refreshing smashed basil-based drink, while I went all in for a fantastic rum punch in Jamaican Style.\n\nHowever, your night might include a couple of Ouzo shots in the proper local atmosphere. If you don’t know what Ouzo is, it is an anise-flavoured liquor widely consumed in Greece, very similar to Sambuca, Rakı and Arak.\n\nBesides culture, Athens is a spot to enjoy the best Mediterranean food. As said, most of the recipes are the evolution and melting pot of cultures. The king of the table is, of course, the Olive oil. Of course, our fine dining at Makris started with the perfect tasting.\n\nAmong the courses the atmosphere and the dishes which completed each other’s taste were taking me through a whirlwind of flavours that seemed travelling all around Greece.\n\nIt might not be on your Athens Itinerary, but you can’t miss booking a dinner here if you are looking for an alternative. You can complement the dinner with a visit to Athens Stoa. However, also plan to book a lunch on the roof terrace for the perfect view of the Acropolis.\n\nThings to do in Athens for culture lovers\n\nWander at the new Athens Cultural Centre\n\nBy far, the SNFCC, or Athens Cultural Centre, was one of the remarkable spots on my Athens itinerary. I am still widely talking to friends of family about their great project, involving and promoting culture elevating the local community.\n\nThe Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre (SNFCC) spans over 200 acres and is one of the most sustainable projects in the city and Europe.\n\nThe complex houses the National Opera House, the National Gallery and fantastic gardens surrounding the futuristic buildings. Renzo Piano designed the project and, at night, became magical with the water fountain show and different installations in the gardens.\n\nThe windy top Floor offers the perfect 360 view over Athens. In winter, when we explored Athens, it was hosting the festival of lights, the ice rink and different performances and galleries. Best of all, it is free to enter and participate in these activities. Yes, including Ice Skating.\n\nGo Ice Skating at SNFCC\n\nAs mentioned above, we couldn’t miss this incredible activity while exploring Athens at Christmas. I wish I could live in Athens to take advantage of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center (SNFCC). In winter, this hub of Athens transforms its outdoor Great Lawn into a magical ice skating rink open to the public.\n\nGrab a hot chocolate and lace up your skates for some frosty fun against the backdrop of the sparkling cityscape. Glide your way around this pop-up ice park while listening to festive music under the glow of Athens’ winter sun.\n\nThe rink even offers skating aids for beginners as well as funky-themed events like silent discos on ice! If you need a break from skating, warm up by the fire pits scattered throughout the lawn or refuel on Greek street food from the Agora marketplace. Ice skating with a view makes for a quintessential Athenian winter activity!\n\nSee the Changing of the guard at Syntagma Square\n\nAt the centre of modern Athens lies Syntagma Square, which means Constitution Square. This open plaza is home to the Hellenic Parliament building. Watching the changing of the guard ceremony held in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a beloved Athenian tradition.\n\nIt is held about every hour, with the swap between the two soldiers in guard and every hour with two new guards.\n\nThe Presidential Guard, known as the Evzones, are an elite unit famous for their unique uniform of a skirt, tights, and shoes with pom-poms. It was impressive to witness.\n\nHadrian’s Arch\n\nOn the last day of our Athen visit, we explored the cultural side of the visit. Passing through remains of different epoques, I was amused by the Hadrian’s Arch, built in 131 AD; this ancient marble archway sits north of the Acropolis and originally served as the boundary between Athens and the Roman neighbourhood.\n\nHadrian’s Arch honours the visit of powerful Roman Emperor Hadrian (beloved by Greeks), who was revered for his Hellenophilia admiration of Greek culture. Study the intricate carvings depicting fortifications, weaponry, hunting scenes, and, of course, Hadrian himself featured prominently on the central tablet.\n\nToday, you can view the arch from both sides, either by entering the upscale Kolonaki district or facing the Acropolis from the other direction. I tried to catch the perfect angle in frame with part of the Acropolis.\n\nThe Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nRight in front of the Arch of Hadrian, there are the remains of the Temple of Olympian Zeus. This is the most important archaeological site after the Acropolis and Parthenon. The colossal ruined temple was dedicated to Zeus, King of the Olympian gods.\n\nThe history is controversial, as it took over 700 years to complete the construction and a few earthquakes to destroy it. In its heyday, 104 towering Corinthian columns stood 17 metres high, encircling the temple grounds.\n\nToday, only 15 columns remain intact, but it’s still hugely impressive wandering amid these mammoth pillars while imagining the temple’s past grandeur. Don’t miss the entrance gate (Propylaea), which gives a glimpse into the temple’s original scale.\n\nFilopappou Hill\n\nFor panoramic views over the Acropolis without the crowds (or fewer people visiting Athens in winter), head to Filopappou Hill. This pine-tree-dotted green space also houses the gorgeous Filopappou Monument. Built-in 114 AD, this marble tomb honours Julius Antiochus Filopappos, a prominent Syrian Roman consul.\n\nToday, Filopappou Hill is frequented by locals seeking a serene nature. It is one of the most instagrammable places in the city, offering a stunning view over the most popular sights of Athens.\n\nVisit the Maria Callas Museum\n\nThe Maria Callas Museum is certainly worth a visit, especially for opera lovers and those interested in Greek cultural history. Located in the iconic singer’s family apartment in central Athens, the tiny yet charming museum gives an intimate glimpse into Maria Callas’ early life and career.\n\nThe modest apartment where she spent her childhood is packed with memorabilia like photographs, letters, costumes, awards and even jewellery belonging to Callas.\n\nOf special note are her jewel-encrusted gloves and a signature pair of T-strap heels. You can stop at the listening stations to admire the legendary talent during live concerts and private lessons at the Juilliard School of New York.\n\nBeyond the artefacts, the museum does an excellent job depicting her glamorous yet tragic life story from humble Athens beginnings to international stardom.\n\nSee a show at the Historic Odeon of Herodes Atticus\n\nTo my surprise, I learned that one of the most ancient theatres in the world is still open and running shows all year round. Dating back to 161 AD, the Odeon of Herodes Atticus is an ancient stone theatre on the south slope of the Acropolis.\n\nThe old house of arts and drama of the city of Athena is within the Parthenon complex and was restored in 1950, keeping the original features. It’s now used as a stunning outdoor venue hosting concerts, ballets, theatre performances, and the annual Athens Festival. Even Maria Callas performed here!\n\nCatching a show at this ancient site with the glowing Acropolis as a backdrop is a highlight you can’t miss. Tickets run fast, and you better grab yours before arriving in Athens.\n\nMarvel at Monastiraki Square | Athens Ancient Agora\n\nDuring my visit, I passed by Monastiraki Square many times and at every time of the day. The square was always busy but always impressive. As one of the city’s liveliest squares, Monastiraki provides a gateway to both modern Athens and its ancient history.\n\nOn one edge lies the flea market selling wares under the sun, across from the restored neoclassical Tsisdarakis Mosque. The Square stands steps away from the old Agora, the centre of ancient Athens dating back to 600 BC. You can make Monastiraki Square the centre of every tour around Athens, relaxing from time to time with street performers while grazing on juicy souvlaki skewers or spanakopita from the row of casual eateries.\n\nCheck Out Monastiraki Flea Market\n\nOn day two of our visit to Athens, we walked through the narrow streets of the old Agora. The pleasant stroll took us through Monastiraki Flea Market, one of the most active areas of Athens.\n\nWithin the stalls, you can find everything, from antiques to spare parts. I was attracted by old coins and vintage cameras. I wish I had a little more time, but it will be on the list of places for the next visit.\n\nGo on a cultural walking tour with alternative Athens\n\nGo on a cultural walking tour with alternative Athens.
