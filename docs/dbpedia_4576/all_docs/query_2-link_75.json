        "text": "Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a history spanning over 3,000 years.\n\nThe capital city is in the region of Attica, in the southern part of Greece, around 5 miles (8 km) inland from the Saronic Gulf. The post below aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the main landmarks in that amazing city\n\n….as well as some of the surrounding wonders in the region, like the Holi Monastery of Daphni of the stunning Temple of Poseidon in Cape Sounion.\n\nAs it is not very far from Athens (180 kilometers -112 miles- northwest of Athens.), I’ll cover, as well, the mythic Delphi Archeological site, on the slopes of Mount Parnassus in the region of Phocis.\n\nAthens\n\nAthens is renowned for its rich history and cultural heritage. It was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece and is often referred to as the cradle of Western civilization.\n\nAthens was a center of learning, philosophy, arts, and democracy. It is famous for its endless architectural marvels.\n\nToday, Athens is a bustling metropolis with a population of over 3 million people. The city seamlessly blends its ancient past with its vibrant present, offering visitors a unique and unforgettable experience.\n\nIt is a destination that caters to history enthusiasts, culture lovers, and travelers seeking to immerse themselves in the charm of this timeless city. It is obviously as well a paradise for photography. 🤩\n\nYou’ll find below many images to showcase some of the stunning ancient or modern landmarks of Athens, starting with the most famous one….\n\nAcropolis\n\nThe Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel and UNESCO World Heritage Site located on a rocky outcrop above the city. It is one of the most iconic and significant archaeological sites in the world, representing the pinnacle of ancient Greek architecture and culture.\n\nThe Acropolis has a history dating back to ancient times, with the earliest traces of human occupation dating to the Neolithic period (around 4000-3000 BC). However, it is most renowned for its Golden Age during the 5th century BC, when it became the center of Athenian power, culture, and religion.\n\nThe Parthenon\n\nThe most famous structure on the Acropolis is the Parthenon, an ancient temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the patron deity of Athens. It was built between 447 BC and 438 BC during the Golden Age of Athens, under the supervision of the renowned architects Ictinus and Callicrates, with Phidias as the sculptor.\n\nThe Parthenon is a Doric-style temple, characterized by its sturdy columns with fluted shafts and simple capitals. It features eight columns on the facade and seventeen columns on each side, giving it a grand and majestic appearance.\n\nIt is considered a masterpiece of classical Greek architecture due to its harmonious proportions and optical refinements. Today, the Parthenon stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains one of the most visited and revered historical monuments in the world.\n\nTemple of Erechtheion\n\nThe Temple of Erechtheion is situated to the north of the Parthenon and is one of the most well-known and architecturally significant structures on the Acropolis. It was built between 421 BC and 406 BC, during the same period as the construction of the Parthenon. It was dedicated to multiple deities, including Athena Polias, Poseidon, and Erechtheus (an ancient Athenian king).\n\nThe temple is characterized by its use of slender, scroll-like columns with volutes (spiral ornaments) at the top. Unlike the Doric order of the Parthenon, the Erechtheion’s Ionic order gives it a more delicate and graceful appearance.\n\nOne of the unique features of the Erechtheion is its asymmetrical design. The temple is not perfectly rectangular due to the irregularity of the ground and the multiple shrines and cults it was meant to house.\n\nThe east and north sides have porches with columns, while the west side has a larger porch known as the “Porch of the Maidens” or the “Porch of the Caryatids.”\n\nThe Porch of the Maidens is famous for its six female figures, known as Caryatids, which act as supporting columns. Each Caryatid is sculpted in high relief and stands over six feet tall, supporting the entablature with their heads and arms. Today, five of the original Caryatids are housed in the Acropolis Museum, and a replica stands in their place on the temple.\n\nThe Propylaea\n\nThe Propylaea is the monumental entrance and ceremonial gateway to the Acropolis. Its construction began in 437 BC, during the same period as the Parthenon, under the supervision of the architect Mnesicles. However, due to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, the work was interrupted and never fully completed 😪.\n\nIt was designed to impress visitors with its grandeur and serve as a fitting prelude to the sacred and awe-inspiring structures of the Acropolis. The central part of the building features the Doric order, with six Doric columns across the front. The wings of the building have Ionic columns, known for their more slender and ornate design.\n\nOver the centuries, the Propylaea suffered damage from various causes, including invasions, fires, and earthquakes. It underwent several reconstructions and restorations during its history.\n\nTemple of Athena Nike\n\nThe Temple of Athena Nike is one of the smaller temples on the Acropolis but holds significant historical and architectural importance. It is strategically positioned on the southwest corner of the Acropolis, overlooking the Propylaea, the monumental entrance to the Acropolis.\n\nThe Temple of Athena Nike was built around 420 BC, during the Golden Age of Athens, following the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War. It was dedicated to the goddess Athena Nike, the “Victorious Athena,” who was worshipped as a protector and bringer of victory in battle.\n\nThe temple’s frieze, a decorative band running around the exterior, depicted scenes of battles between the Greeks and the Persians, as well as mythological figures, including Nike, the goddess of victory. Some of the original frieze fragments are now displayed in the Acropolis Museum.\n\nOdeon of Herodes Atticus\n\nThe Herodion is an ancient Roman amphitheater located on the southern slope of the Acropolis. Was built in 161 AD and is one of the most well-preserved and impressive ancient theaters in the world.\n\nThe Odeon of Herodes Atticus has a three-story auditorium with a seating capacity of around 5,000 spectators. Today, it serves as the main venue for the Athens annual Arts Festival.\n\nMount Lycabettus\n\nMount Lycabettus, (also known as Lycabettos or Lykavittos) is one of the many hills that surround the ancient city and offers stunning panoramic views of Athens and the surrounding areas.\n\nThe summit of Mount Lycabettus stands at about 277 meters (909 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest points in Athens. The hill is a popular spot to witness stunning sunset views over the city, making it a favorite destination for both locals and tourists.\n\nVisitors have the option to either hike up to the top of the hill or take a funicular railway. You can capture some of the city landmarks from an aerial perspective, like the Kallimarmaro below.\n\nAt the top of Mount Lycabettus, there is a beautiful chapel dedicated to St. George, which adds to the charm of the area, especially with the evening golden light.\n\nNote: I took out the many ugly antennas on the image 😅\n\nThere is a restaurant at the summit where visitors can enjoy a meal or a drink while taking in the breathtaking vistas. If you’re interested in photography, it is a good idea to book a table for dinner and enjoy the stunning twilight view from there 🤩.\n\nAreopagus Hill\n\nContinuing with some of the most amazing viewpoints over the Acropolis, the prominent rocky outcrop called Aeropagus Hill (also known as Mars Hill,) is another great one. The Areopagus Hill located northwest of the Acropolis offers breathtaking views of the archeological site,\n\nit is good to synchronize your visit with sunset golden hours. Depending on the season, with a bit of luck -or good trip planning 🤨- the golden hour could be out of the opening hours of the Acropolis, allowing pictures of the Propylaiawithout the crowds 🤩\n\nIn ancient Athens, the Areopagus was the name of both the hill and the council of elders who met there to discuss important matters of the city-state’s governance.\n\nThe views of the city of Athens are great as well. Don’t miss the beautiful perspective over the Stoa of Attalos and the Holy Apostles church.\n\nPhilopappos Hill\n\nOne more stunning viewpoint over the Acropolis, this time from the southwest: Philopappos Hill.\n\nThe hill is named after Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos, a prince and Roman senator of Syrian descent who lived in the 2nd century AD. Philopappos was a benefactor of the city of Athens.\n\nA monument(visible from Everywhere in Athens) was erected in Gaius Philopappo’s honor on the hill’s summit.\n\nThe hill is covered with pine trees, and there are walking trails and pathways that lead through the greenery. It is a great place for leisurely walks, picnics, and enjoying the natural beauty of Athens.\n\nMonastiraki square\n\nMonastiraki Square is a bustling and vibrant square located in the historical center of Athens, near the neighborhood of Plaka and at the foothills of the Acropolis. From Monastiraki Square, you can enjoy excellent views of the Acropolis, particularly from some of the rooftop bars and restaurants in the area.\n\nThe name “Monastiraki” comes from the word “monastiráki,” which means “little monastery” in Greek. The square gets its name from the small monastery that used to exist in the area during the Byzantine era.\n\nThe square and its surrounding streets are often filled with street performers, artists, musicians, and entertainers. You can enjoy live music, dance performances, and other artistic displays as you explore the area.\n\nFrom the rooftops, you can as well enjoy a great aerial perspective on some of the key landmarks, like the Temple of Hephaestus and the Agora of Athens.\n\nHadrian’s Library\n\nHadrian’s Library was constructed by the Roman Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD. Hadrian was a lover of Greek culture and architecture, and he made significant contributions to the development and beautification of Athens during his reign.\n\nThe library followed the traditional Roman architectural style with elements of Greek influence. It had a rectangular layout and was surrounded by a colonnade with Corinthian columns. The main entrance featured a grand propylon (gateway).\n\nBesides serving as a library, Hadrian’s Library also functioned as a cultural and educational center. It had lecture halls, meeting rooms, and spaces for public gatherings and philosophical discussions.\n\nHadrian’s Library fell into disrepair over the centuries…\n\nDuring the Byzantine period, the building underwent several alterations, and its original purpose was lost. It was only in the 19th century, during archaeological excavations, that the remains of the library were rediscovered.\n\nTzisdarakis Mosque\n\nThe Tzisdarakis Mosque, also known as the Mosque of Ahmet Aga, is a notable mosque located on Monastiraki Square, next to Hadrian’s Library. It was constructed in the 18th century during the Ottoman era and served as a mosque until the early 20th century.\n\nKallimarmaro\n\nThe Panathenaic Stadium known as Kallimarmaro, dates back to the 4th century BC. It was originally constructed for the Panathenaic Games, which were part of the ancient religious festival known as the Panathenaia, dedicated to the goddess Athena, the patron deity of Athens.\n\nThe stadium has undergone several reconstructions over the centuries. The most notable renovation occurred in 144 AD when Herodes Atticus, a wealthy Athenian aristocrat, funded the reconstruction of the stadium in marble, giving it the name “Kallimarmaro,” which means “beautifully marbled” in Greek.\n\nThe Kallimarmaro is made entirely of white Pentelic marble and can seat approximately 50,000 spectators.\n\nIt hosted various athletic and religious events throughout ancient times, including foot races, chariot races, and the Panathenaic procession.\n\nIt was also the site of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 after it was excavated and restored for that purpose.\n\nThere is a small museum inside the stadium that exhibits artifacts related to the history of the site and the Olympic Games. The torches and posters from the games over the world are the most noticeable items.\n\nTemple of Hephaestus\n\nThe Temple of Hephaestus, also known as the Hephaisteion, is located on the western side of the Agora. It was dedicated to Hephaestus, the ancient Greek god of fire, blacksmiths, and craftsmanship, and to Athena Ergane, the goddess of artisans and crafts.\n\nDoric-style Temple was constructed around 450-415 BC during the Golden Age of Athens. It was designed by the architect Ictinus, who was also responsible for designing the Parthenon on the Acropolis.\n\nThe temple features a peristyle design with six columns on each end and thirteen columns on each side, totaling 34 Doric columns in all.\n\nOver the centuries, the temple has undergone several changes and repurposing. It served as a Christian church during the Byzantine period, and in the medieval era, it was known as the Church of Saint George Akamates. From nearby the temple, there is as well a great view over the Propylaea (Acropolis entrance) and the small Temple of Athena Nike.\n\nStoa of Attalos\n\nThe Stoa of Attaloswas originally constructed by King Attalos II of Pergamon around 150 BC. It is situated in the Ancient Agora of Athens, which was the central marketplace and civic center of the city during antiquity.\n\nThe Stoa of Attalos was a large, two-story building with a colonnaded facade. It measured approximately 115 meters (377 feet) long and 20 meters (66 feet) wide. The stoa was adorned with Doric and Ionic columns, creating a grand and impressive structure.\n\nDuring its time of use, the Stoa of Attalos was primarily a place for merchants to conduct business. Additionally, the stoa was a gathering place for philosophical discussions and lectures. Today it is as well a great photography place 😊\n\nOver time, the Stoa of Attalos fell into disrepair and was eventually abandoned. In the 1950s, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens undertook a large-scale restoration project, reconstructing the stoa using the original materials and techniques. Today, it serves as a museum.\n\nThe museum displays various artifacts from the ancient Athenian marketplace, providing visitors with insights into the daily life and commercial activities of ancient Athens.\n\nChurch of the Holy Apostles\n\nIn the perimeter of the Agora, the Sacred Temple “Ieros Naos Agion Apostolon” is one of the oldest churches in the city (10th or 11th century).\n\nThe church follows a Byzantine architectural style and features beautiful frescoes and religious icons from different periods of its existence.\n\nHadrian’s Arch\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian is an ancient Roman triumphal arch that was built in honor of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who visited Athens in 131 AD. during his grand tour of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe arch is situated at the junction of two major ancient roads: One leading from the Roman Agora to the Olympieion and the road leading from the city to the Acropolis. It effectively served as a symbolic gateway between the ancient city and the newly built Roman sector of Athens.\n\nTemple of Olympian Zeus\n\nThe construction of the Temple of Olympian Zeus (Olympieion) began in the 6th century BCE during the rule of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratus but was halted due to financial and political difficulties. It was fully completed during the reign of Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD.\n\nThe Temple was dedicated to Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, and was intended to be the largest temple in ancient Greece.\n\nToday, the Temple of Olympian Zeus stands as a majestic ruin, with 15 columns still standing. These columns provide a glimpse of the temple’s former grandeur and serve as a reminder of the immense scale and ambition of ancient Greek architecture.\n\nNational Library\n\nThe National Library is a prominent cultural institution and one of the largest and most important libraries in the country, housing an extensive collection of books, manuscripts, maps, and other valuable historical documents.\n\nIt was established in 1832, shortly after Greece gained independence from the Ottoman Empire. The first location of the library was in a room at the University of Athens, but over the years, it moved to various locations until it found its current home.\n\nThe main building of the National Library, right next to the iconic Panathenaic Stadium and is a significant architectural landmark, designed by the Danish architect Theophil Hansen in a neoclassical style.\n\nNational and Kapodistrian University of Athens\n\nNext to the national library is the National University of Athens NKUA), the oldest and largest university in Greece.

It is overlooking the valley and was positioned in such a way that visitors to the oracle and other rituals could see it prominently as they approached the site.\n\nThe Temple of Apollo was home to the famous Oracle of Delphi, who was believed to be the conduit through which Apollo conveyed his prophecies and divine guidance. The Oracle, known as the Pythia, was a priestess who delivered her predictions in a trance-like state induced by inhaling natural gases emanating from a chasm beneath the temple.\n\nThe temple served as a focal point for the worship of Apollo, one of the major deities in ancient Greek religion. It attracted pilgrims and visitors from all over Greece, as well as foreigners seeking advice and guidance from the Oracle.\n\nPillar of Prusias II\n\nThe stele of Prusias, located to the northeast of the entrance of the temple of Apollo, has been fully restored.\n\nThe monument has been identified through an inscription mentioning that it was dedicated by the Aetolian League to honor King Prusias II of Bithynia, in northwestern Asia Minor\n\nTripod of the Plateans\n\nThe Tripod of the Plateans was dedicated by the city-state of Plataea.

It dates back to the 4th century BC and is one of the most well-preserved and impressive structures in Delphi.\n\nThe Tholos is surrounded by a colonnade of Doric columns. The inner circular chamber is surrounded by 20 exterior Doric columns, and in the center, there was likely a circular shrine or altar. The roof of the Tholos was made of white marble, and it was covered with elaborate architectural decorations, such as sculptures and friezes. You can get nice aerial views from the Museum alley (with a long lens).\n\nIt is believed to have had a religious function, possibly dedicated to Athena. It might have served as a place of worship, a treasury, or an administrative building for the sanctuary.\n\nThe Tholos of Athena Pronaia is a fascinating structure and offers great opportunities for travel or photography lovers.\n\nTreasury of the Athenians\n\nThe “Treasury of the Athenians” is one of the most famous buildings at the Delphy Sanctuary of Apollo. It was one of the numerous treasuries constructed by various city-states to store valuable offerings and dedications to the god Apollo.\n\nThe treasuries were small, often ornate buildings that served both as storage spaces for precious objects and as a display of a city-state’s wealth and devotion to the gods. They were typically placed along the sacred way leading up to the Temple of Apollo, and each city-state constructed its treasury in a distinctive architectural style.\n\nThe Treasury of the Athenians was built by the city-state of Athens to demonstrate Athens’ gratitude and reverence for the Appolo god. The treasury was filled with valuable offerings, which could include statues, votive gifts, precious metals, and other valuable items.\n\nAncient Stadium\n\nThe Ancient Stadium of Delphi played a significant role in the Panhellenic Pythian Games, which were held in honor of Apollo every four years.\n\nThese games (second only to the Olympic Games in importance) attracted athletes from various Greek city-states. The stadium was constructed during the 5th century BC.\n\nSo, those are the main landmark but the site is large and full of other wonders so keep walking around 😀. Most people will visit from Athens and back but I would advise sleeping one night there in order to avoid the crowds, with a good afternoon and morning to appreciate that amazing place.\n\nDelphi Museum\n\nThe site was excavated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and many artifacts from Delphi are now housed in the (beautiful) Delphi Archaeological Museum, near the entrance of the archeological site.\n\nThe Delphi Archaeological Museum showcases items spanning several centuries, from prehistoric times to the Roman period.\n\nThe exhibits primarily focus on the religious and cultural significance of Delphi in ancient times, as well as its role as a major religious center and the Oracle of Delphi.\n\nSome of the notable artifacts you may find in the museum include statues, sculptures, architectural fragments, inscriptions, pottery, votive offerings, and other archaeological findings from the ancient site.\n\nAmong the most famous exhibits is the Charioteer of Delphi, a well-preserved bronze statue dating back to approximately 470 BC.\n\n.\n\nTemple of Poseidon Sounion\n\nThe Archaeological Site of Sounion is situated at Cape Sounion, which is about 69 kilometers (43 miles) southeast of Athens.

It was built with locally quarried marble. It was dedicated to Poseidon, the god of the sea, storms, and earthquakes.\n\nThe Temple of Poseidon was constructed during the Golden Age of Athens, under the administration of the Athenian statesman Pericles. The temple’s position atop the rocky promontory of Cape Sounion made it visible from far out at sea. (The view at night or early morning from the beach is great as well)\n\nTo manage expectations, it is beautiful and very close to Athens so … it is more than crowded at sunset time as per the image below 🥲….\n\nso, the tip is to arrive early, capture the sun rays through the columns and then exit to walk to the opposite hill from the entrance and enjoy magnificent views, with fewer crowds…\n\nHoli Monastery of Daphni\n\nThe Holy Monastery of Daphni is an important Byzantine monastery located 11 kilometers (7 miles) northwest of the city center of Athens, close to the town of Chaidari.\n\nThe Daphni Monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was originally built in the 6th century AD on the site of an ancient sanctuary dedicated to Apollo Daphnaios. It was later converted into a Christian Monastery.\n\nThe interior of the Daphni Monastery is adorned with stunning Byzantine mosaics depicting scenes from the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and other religious figures.\n\nThese mosaics are considered masterpieces of Byzantine art.\n\nThe Holy Monastery of Daphni is a fascinating destination and might be a good stop if you go toward the Piraeus harbor to take a ferry…\n\nSo, I hope that the post will engage you to visit Athens and its region ☺️.
