        "text": "What did viewers remember when they looked at the Arch of Constantine? Monuments can cue many different kinds of memories, as a brief personal anecdote can help to clarify. On a recent trip to central London, I encountered the statue represented at Fig. 7 and discovered, upon reading the inscription, that it represented George VI (the current Queen of England’s father). Immediately, I remembered who he was – or rather, what I actually remembered was the highly successful 2010 film The King’s Speech starring Colin Firth. This film, which was about the life of George VI and particularly his speech impediment, provided me with a concrete visual image of the King, along with a limited set of stories about his reign, some of which sprang to mind as I looked at this statue. At the same time, I also recalled ‘episodic’ memories associated with the film, such as the evening that I went to the cinema to watch it, and the conversations that I had with friends afterwards. As well as these relatively recent events, I found myself thinking about earlier memories of my grandmother telling me stories about the British royal family. All of these memories - but particularly the older memories from childhood – contributed to the vague sense of nostalgia that I experienced when viewing this statue, the ‘positive affect’ which arguably predisposed me to have a sympathetic reaction to the monument and the subject it represented.\n\nThis modern example underlines a very simple fact that is nevertheless often obfuscated in modern discussions of monuments: that is, what a monument cues its viewer to recall is not ‘firsthand’ memories of the people and events being commemorated (which often occurred long before their lifetimes) but other, ‘mediating’ representations and experiences.[24] Importantly, these mediating representations can impinge on the viewer’s interpretation of the monument, predisposing them to respond in a certain way to its imagery, as well as its ideological message. Some of these representations are unique to certain individuals, as is the case with the stories told to me by my grandmother. Others can be shared by much larger groups of people: The King’s Speech, for instance, was a box-office phenomenon, and I was probably not the only person who looked at this statue in 2011 and ‘remembered’ the face of Colin Firth. This second type of ‘shared’ memory is central to the view of collective memory put forward by writers like James Wertsch, who notes that groups “share a representation of the past because they share textual resources”[25]. As Wertsch goes on to explain, the use of these textual resources “may result in homogeneous, complementary, or contested collective memory, but in all cases, it is the key to understanding how distribution [of memory] is possible.”\n\nHow can this kind of analysis be brought to bear on the ancient viewer of monuments like the Arch of Constantine? The personal ‘episodic’ or ‘communicative’ memories of Romans are, for the most part, out of our reach – it is impossible to retrieve what Romans talked about with their grandmothers (although presumably stories of earlier rulers would have featured somewhere in the repertoire). However, we do have access to at least some of the mediating texts and images that were accessible to Roman viewers and which may have conditioned their reception of the monument. In her 1997 article in the Memoirs, Dale Kinney uses such a methodology to reappraise the recarved portrait heads on the second-century reliefs in the light of other Roman image-making practices. Noting that “since H.P. L’Orange published his seminal book on the Arch of Constantine in the 1930s, most scholars have accepted some version of his thesis that this was a panegyrical gesture to all four emperors,” Kinney points out that, as far as imperial portraits are concerned, this use of recarving to convey a positive message was very unusual – perhaps even unprecedented. Normally, the reworking of emperor portraits happened in a context of “penury, hubristic appropriation, or damnatio memoriae,” negative practices that, Kinney argues, would have been determinant of the viewer’s reaction to the recarved heads on the Arch of Constantine [26]. In other words, while the designers of the Arch may have intended the recarving to be read as a panegyrical gesture, the ‘remembering viewer’ would have found it difficult to escape the negative connotations of this practice.\n\nKinney’s interpretation of the reworked portrait heads shows the power of memory to complicate the intentions of a monument’s designers by indicating counter-hegemonic readings. Of course, monuments could also – deliberately or ‘accidentally’ – cue other memories that were entirely coherent with their makers’ ideological program. In fact, Jas Elsner and Karl Galinsky have both pointed out that the reworking of portrait heads occurred in a much wider range of contexts than the negative ones mentioned by Kinney (for instance, the honorific reuse of statues, and the later insertion of portrait heads into mythological scenes on Roman sarcophagi), thereby alerting us to the possibility that the heads on the Arch might have cued positive or neutral as well as negative memories for their viewers [27]. Further similarities might be drawn between the recarved heads and (non-recarved) images such as the ‘theomorphic’ or ‘allegorical’ portraits that were so beloved by imperial patrons. These are visually and conceptually similar to recarved portraits, insofar as they present one subject’s head on another subject’s body. Seeing the reworked figures on the Arch of Constantine in the light of these allegorical portraits would have emphasized the divine or quasi-mythological status of the earlier emperors, by showing them as equivalent to the gods or mythical figures who were normally used as allegorical ‘costumes’. Then, there are the stories and images of bodily metamorphosis, which saturated Roman culture, and which were often set in bucolic landscapes similar to those on the Arch’s Hadrianic roundels. While modern academic interpretations of the Arch’s recarved figures prefer formal terms such as ‘analogy’, ‘typology’ and ‘prototype’, we need to remain open to the possibility that the Roman viewer – who was used to the idea of people and things taking on new forms – might have perceived these images as representing a genuine bodily transformation. Such a reading implies a very literal continuity in the imperial office: the emperors might look slightly different from one another, but they were essentially made from the same substance – they were (to use a term current in Constantine’s lifetime) homoousioi.\n\nThe discussion so far indicates the fundamental role of memory as a source of meaning and discrepant viewer experience. Other aspects of the Arch’s imagery would have cued different memories, and all of these would have nuanced the viewer’s reception of the monument in subtly different ways. For instance, the formal similarities between the Arch of Constantine and earlier arches like those of Titus and Septimius Severus may have underlined the conservatism of Constantine’s monument and the traditional values of its makers, while at the same time showcasing the novel aspects of its design and use of spolia [28]. Viewers who remembered Constantine’s interventions in the nearby building projects of his rival Maxentius may have been primed to read the recarved portrait heads in the negative light suggested by Kinney; meanwhile, memories of the original (and now dismembered) contexts of the second-century reliefs would have undoubtedly impinged on their interpretation of the Arch of Constantine [29]. And so on. Of course, in one sense this whole discussion is simply a re-framing of existing theories of intertextuality and reception in which ‘knowledge’ is preferred to the word ‘memory’. But insisting that memory is at stake in viewing is important for at least two reasons. Firstly, as indicated earlier, it reminds us that any viewer’s experience of a monument drew on their unique, episodic, autobiographical memories, as well as the ‘semantic’ memories (knowledge) that they shared with the rest of their ‘textual community’. Secondly, framing the analysis in terms of memory also brings art-historical work into dialogue with other scholarship in the interdisciplinary field of memory studies – a dialogue that potentially holds benefits for all of its participants.\n\nRemembering after the Arch of Constantine\n\nSo far, this discussion has implicitly focused on a viewer standing in front of the Arch of Constantine, who is prompted by the Arch’s imagery to recall other objects and experiences. But we might also think about what happened to that viewer once they had walked away from the monument. How did their encounter with the Arch of Constantine transform the way in which they thought about the past (and the present), in the future?\n\nOne possible approach to this question involves highlighting the agency of the Arch’s makers, whose choices in selecting and presenting material for display influenced what future audiences – including ourselves as historians – were (collectively) enabled to remember.[30] We might note, for instance, that Roman history according to the Arch of Constantine is an imperial history – there is no room for Regal or Republican episodes in this coherent story of emperors and their victories over men and beasts. Such ellipses are significant because, as Eviatar Zerubavel has pointed out, “The extent to which our social environment affects the ‘depth’ of our memory is also manifested somewhat more tacitly in the way we conventionally begin historical narratives…. After all, by defining a certain moment in history as the actual beginning of a particular historical narrative, it implicitly also defines for us everything that preceded it as mere ‘pre-history’ which we can practically forget” [31].\n\nIn addition to interrogating the contents of the Arch(ive) [35], we can also ask how the visual format in which these contents were presented might have impacted on how – and how effectively – they were remembered. Such an approach is, in fact, suggested by the Roman rhetorical texts on the ars memoriae – an artificial memory system that relied on its practitioners equating ‘to be remembered’ items with visual images (imagines), and then placing these images in fixed places (loci), which often took the form of architectural backgrounds (“for example, a house, an intercolumnar space, a corner, an arch, and other things that are similar to these”) [36]. The writers of these Roman texts, and in particular the anonymous author of the Rhetorica ad Herennium, demonstrate a palpable awareness of the differing mnemonic potential of visual images, acknowledging the fact that some images are more easily stored in and retrieved from memory than others. Indeed, we might examine the Arch of Constantine in the light of the ancient texts themselves, noting, for instance, the use of “great and good images”, of “purple cloaks” (the Dacian prisoners) and the “tainting of images with red” (the porphyry around the Hadrianic panels) [37]. These elements of the Arch’s design would all – so the Roman art of memory suggests – enhance the monument’s visual saliency, and the successful encoding and easy retrieval of its contents.\n\nNew research on human memory in the cognitive sciences might also give some fresh insights into how Roman viewers perceived and subsequently remembered the Arch’s imagery. In her 1997 book Wax Tablets of the Mind, Jocelyn Penny Small showed how modern psychology research might be used to provide empirical support for the ideas of the ancient authors on ars memoriae [38]. But cognitive research on memory can also draw attention to other mnemonic features of Roman monuments that do not appear in the ancient texts on memory [39]. We might take as an example the concept of ‘cued retrieval’ – the idea that a piece of information such as a word, image or odor can be used to access memory traces. The classic experiments investigating this phenomenon were conducted by Canadian psychologist Endel Tulving and his colleagues in the 1960s and 1970s. These involved presenting subjects with lists of words to be retained and then recalled (‘target’ words), some of which were accompanied by a partner (‘cue’ words) [40]. When subjects were asked to recall a target word – either unaided or prompted by the relevant cue word – Tulving found that the presence of the appropriate cue significantly increased the chance of subjects recalling the target. Notably, he also discovered that for a cue to function efficiently it must already have some semantic association with the target word (a phenomenon known as ‘feature overlap’) and that the target and cue must have been presented at the same time (‘encoding specificity’). The effect of cued retrieval suggests that the presentation of pairs of words together shortens or strengthens the neural pathways between them, meaning that it takes less energy to pass from one to another. Since their description by Tulving, these ideas about cued retrieval have been given practical applications in fields such as law, politics and television advertising. But how might they be relevant to the Arch of Constantine?\n\nThe hypothesis offered here involves thinking about the act of viewing of the Arch as analogous to the first stage of Tulving’s experiments, in which the pairs of words were first presented together. This time, however, the pairs are images of emperors: Constantine and Trajan, Constantine and Hadrian, Constantine and Marcus Aurelius – figures who are already semantically related by virtue of the fact that they are all emperors (thus fulfilling Tulving’s criterion of ‘feature overlap’). As we have already seen, the Arch’s designers linked these pairs of emperors in different ways, namely through the addition of portrait features and epithets to the spoliated reliefs, the drawing of parallels between Constantine’s deeds and those of his predecessors, and the representation of Constantine in the vicinity of the earlier emperors’ statues. The viewer scanning the monument would thus find several repetitions of the links between Constantine and his chosen predecessors, each of which would consolidate and shorten the semantic pathways between these men in the viewer’s memory. Significantly, the psychological evidence raises the possibility that one partner in the pair could subsequently function as a retrieval cue for the other, and that a viewer who examined the imagery on the Arch of Constantine and then went on to encounter other images of Trajan, Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius on display elsewhere in the city might be cued automatically to recall their own Emperor. Scholars are already aware that Constantine was a master of appropriating the past, reusing earlier images to a greater extent than any previous emperors [41]. However, the cognitive work on memory adds another dimension to this discussion, by suggesting that Constantine (or rather, the makers of his Arch) might have appropriated the images of his predecessors without ever laying a chisel on them.\n\nCued retrieval represents just one of several ways in which cognitive work on memory resonates with the Arch of Constantine and its imagery. Other areas that might be explored include the saliency of visual images (a theme already present in the texts on the ars memoriae), theories about ‘levels of processing’ (the idea that complex images are more memorable than simple ones), and Ebbinghaus’ discoveries about ‘spaced repetition’ (which here may shed light on the effect of repeat encounters between a moving viewer and fixed monument) [42]. Now, in all of these cases, the broad insights that cognitive science allows into the workings of viewer memory need to be balanced, supplemented and problematized by historical analysis of individual cases. If many of the existing readings of the Arch’s imagery postulate (as Dale Kinney has objected) “an ideal viewer with historically-specific knowledge,” the cognitive approach outlined here postulates an ideal viewer with no historically-specific knowledge – one who exists in silent, experimental test-conditions, rather than the noisy and visually crowded environment of ancient Rome [43]. Even the example of cued retrieval offered here needs to be tempered with the caveat that each imperial portrait seen on the viewer’s ‘post-Arch’ journeys around Rome would have had its own peculiar set of viewing conditions, which may have overwritten the idealized reading described here. But despite such caveats, the different questions and perspectives that are suggested by modern cognitive work on memory can only enrich our work on historical case studies, and underline the formative power that ancient images have over how we think about the past. Moreover, it is worth noting that the effect of cued retrieval proposed here is often simply assumed as a matter of course in discussions of typological and allegorical imagery, which take for granted the capacity of this type of representation to construct long-lasting associative links between pairs of people or narratives.\n\nPostscript: Memory, History and Autobiography\n\nThis chapter has explored some aspects of the relationship between the Arch of Constantine and its viewers. It has also investigated the relationship between individual and ‘collective’ memory, thinking about how far one viewer’s experience of the Arch might be in line with – or different from – those of the people around them. For instance, we have seen how the viewer’s reception of the Arch may have been influenced by their memories of other cultural resources, many of which would also have been available to their contemporaries; at the same time, I have argued that the Arch itself worked on the memories of those who saw it, with the result that many of monument’s viewers came to share a homogenized set of images and narratives with which to internally visualize the past. These are broad conclusions that might be applied to any monument, but I would like to end this chapter by suggesting one additional and quite unique way in which the Arch of Constantine brought individual and group memory into dialogue with one another. This suggestion involves taking a fresh look at the relationship between the second-century spolia and fourth-century frieze, whose contrasting appearances have been the focus of so much of the scholarly literature on the Arch. While previous studies have normally paid attention to the different artistic styles of the sculptures, here I want to focus on the strikingly different ways in which they present historical narrative.\n\nJas Elsner has already noted of the Constantinian frieze that “What seems aesthetically the odd choice of having the frieze spill over the end-corners of the Arch, beyond the last projecting pilaster on each of the long sides, is an effective visual marker of the continuity of the frieze’s narrative action around the Arch, by contrast with the self-contained icons above”[44]. This observation draws attention to the structural disparity between the spoliated reliefs (the Trajanic segements, as well as the Hadrianic roundels and Aurelianic panels), all of which present single ‘snapshots’ of history that appear as ‘discrete icons’, and, on the other hand, the wrap-around fourth-century frieze, which presents history in the form of a long, sequential narrative, whose continuity was emphasized by the insistent forward movement of the participants, as well as by their ‘spilling’ around the corners [45].\n\nThis juxtaposition between a historic past in the form of single, fragmentary images and a recent past presented in the form of a continuous narrative is deeply interesting in the present context, because of the analogy that it suggests with the structures of human autobiographical memory. Writers on memory from antiquity to the present often draw attention to the different qualities of childhood and adult memories (see, for instance, the citation from the Rhetorica ad Herennium at the opening of this chapter). In both autobiographical literature and cognitive science studies, childhood memories are frequently described as stronger and more intensely visual than adult memories. Crucially, for the present argument, they also have a fragmentary quality, appearing as single moments excised from their broader narrative context. Biologist Stephen Rose’s book on The Making of Memory contains one fairly typical example of this: “Another snapshot – a moment at my fourth birthday party, racing with my guests, around a circular rosebed, arms outstretched, making aeroplanes. But what came before or after this frozen moment in time? Who were my party guests? Did I have a birthday cake? I have no idea”[46]. These ‘eidetic’ and fragmentary qualities of childhood memory contrast with adult memories for recent events, which can be stitched with ease into a continuous narrative, albeit one that is constantly reconstructed and reshaped in the process of remembering.\n\nIn this case, looking at descriptions of individual memory draws attention to the fact that the presentation of history on the Arch of Constantine echoes the narrative structures of human autobiographical memory, with the continuous, linear narrative of recent events contrasting sharply with the fragmented and jumbled images of the city’s early life. In noting this analogy I am by no means suggesting that it reflects a conscious decision on the part of the Arch’s designers; rather, I see it as a useful but probably unintended consequence of the incorporation of spoliated sculptures, which by definition represent the past in the form of fragments hewn from a larger picture. Other commentators have drawn attention to the ways in which the Arch creates analogies between different timescales (such as the cosmic and historical – see above p. 3). In this way, the monument’s evocation of the human lifespan simply adds another dimension to its rich multi-temporality [47]. While the sun and moon roundels may elevate the historical events depicted on the Arch to the cosmic, universal level, the form and content of the spolia bring them down to a more intimate and personal scale – that of the remembered human life. Of course, both the cosmic and the autobiographical analogies have a powerful naturalizing function, but the evocation of human memory has the added power to engender in the viewer a sense of ownership of, and personal identification with, the history of the Roman state. This conflation of the boundaries between individual and state has obvious ideological implications, but it also resonates with modern debates about the usefulness and precision of the term ‘collective memory’. Many scholars have criticized what they see as the inaccurate and potentially pernicious metaphorical use of memory as a paradigm for understanding history [48]. The reading of the Arch of Constantine proposed here does nothing to counter those objections, but it does suggest that our own modern analogies between individual memory and group history might, in fact, have a very long ancestry.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My research into spolia and memory was generously funded by a grant from the Memoria Romana project.

Like most previous interpretations of the Arch, some aspects of my own reading postulate a viewer who was able to identify the emperors represented on the Arch.

On the provenance of the spoliated sculptures, see Kinney 1997, 127-128.\n\n[30] This is familiar territory for scholars working within the field of cultural memory studies: see for instance Fowler 2007.\n\n[31] Zerubavel 1996, 287.\n\n[32] Kleiner 1992, 450, and 462.\n\n[33] Foucault’s contre-mémoire; see Introduction, n. 33.\n\n[34] Galinsky 2008, 20; Hedrick 2000, xii and 113-130.\n\n[35] “Archive” has been an operative notion in memory studies; cf. Assmann 1999, 343-347 with reference to Derrida and, similarly, Frischer in this volume.\n\n[36] On the ars memoriae see Small 1997, 95-116 and Onians 1999 177-205.\n\n[37] These examples are drawn from the Rhetorica ad Herennium 3.22.\n\n[38] Small 1997.\n\n[39] Cf. Brilliant 1984, 110.\n\n[40] See for instance Tulving and Pearlstone 1966; Tulving and Osler 1968.\n\n[41] Prusac 2011.\n\n[42] Ebbinghaus 1885. Accessible introductions to cognitive work on memory include Schacter 2001, Baddeley, Eysenck and Anderson 2009, and Boyer and Wertsch 2009.\n\n[43] Kinney 1995, on the view of L’Orange and his successors.\n\n[44] Elsner 2000, 165-166; cf. Gutteridge 2010, 167.\n\n[45] ‘Discrete icons’ is Elsner’s phrase: 2000, 165. A different view is presented by Kleiner 1992, 466: she describes the frieze as representing ‘discrete historical episodes’, in contrast to the earlier, encircling friezes of the Arch of Titus in Rome and Trajan in Beneventum.\n\n[46] Rose 1993, 41.\n\n[47] See in particular Gutteridge 2010.\n\n[48] E.g. Kansteiner 2002; Novick 1999, 267-268; Wertsch 2002, 37."
