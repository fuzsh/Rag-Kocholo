        "text": "In this paper, the ways in which public spaces of Athens are used in the display of imperial power will be analyzed. The aim is to provide a complete and updated outline of the doc- umentation, which lacks, until now, organicity, in order to reconstruct a general trend of the phenomenon and the political meanings of Augustus’ program in Athens. The focus on altars and statue bases, often confused in the Athenian archaeological record, is for sure the best start to understand in which sense we can speak of ‘imperial cult’ in Athens. Altars and statue bases communicate, for their nature, with the observer, that moves every day in an ‘allusive space’. The inscriptions placed on the supports give an additional supply within this communicative process. The favorite place where erecting statue bases was, not by chance, the Acropolis (but we should also add the equestrian statue base of Lucius Caesar above the entrance of the West Gate of the Roman Agora and the dedication to Tiberius of the pillar in front of the Stoa of Attalus), whereas imperial altars seem to be distributed in a less selective way, since they were mostly found in the area of the Odeon, of the Eleusinion, and around the Roman Agora. Even though they were not, in most of the cases, in situ, defining particular areas where the ‘imperial presence’ was predominant is still possible. This study wants to give a useful contribution to the comprehension of the Athenian urban landscape at the time of Augustus, that surely carried out a well-planned dynastic policy, in order to transform the public space in a meaningful stage where was the new authority of Rome exhibited and promoted.\n\nThis article provides a study of Hadrian arches from three main locations: Jordan, Turkey, and Greece. Collectively within these countries, four arches have been found the Hadrian arch at Jerash (Gerasa) in Jordan, the Hadrian arch in Antalya and Ephesus, both in Turkey, and the Hadrian arch in Athens, Greece. The units of our analysis include all the different designs and plans used in constructing these arches. The analyzed design and planning units constitute a database that enables the identification of similarities and differences between these four arches. The study included is descriptions of the arches, which are then compared with one another. although many can be found from the time of the Roman Emperors in the Eastern and Western Roman Provinces. it is generally considered that the Hadrian Period is one of the more important Roman periods, something evident through that period's architectural elements and decorations. Though we only find the Hadrian's Arches at four locations, there are many locations where we can find such Hadrian building as baths or theaters, and others coming from the time of this emperor's reign. This article has examined the architectural elements and decorations found on the Hadrian's Arches, as well as other buildings dating from the Roman period, both in the Near East and elsewhere.\n\nThe article examines the activity of the Athenian institutions in the years between the city’s involvement in the events of the First Mithridatic war (88-86 BCE) and the visits of Antony to the city (42-38 BCE). It deals particularly with the changes occurred in the forms of expression of the traditional political vitality of the city. A focus to the increased care for public honours – especially for honours bestowed on Roman men and women – is the occasion to analyse the renovated aspects of the Agora and the Acropolis, where new monuments were set up and old or damaged buildings underwent restorations. Epigraphic evidences about the works undertaken in the precinct of the Asklepieion – on the southern slopes of the Acropolis – give information about the efforts made by wealthy private citizens and priests to revitalize the ritual activities in the site decades before the extensive restorations of the Augustan age. Texts dealing with political constitutions and judicial regulations will also be discussed in order to evaluate the possible existence of new law-courts’ districts in the city.\n\nThe present paper examines figured reliefs that adorned some of the public buildings of Roman Greece. Most of such reliefs have been found either in Roman colonies, or in cities and centres that had developed strong links with Rome and whose importance was often crucial for Roman politics in this area. They usually display mythological subjects and seem to refer to legendary times, alluding to old traditions and past glories. Besides some observations of a stylistic nature, issues regarding the meaning of these reliefs in their display context will be the main focus of the paper. It will be argued that they not only played a central role in stressing civic identity, but were also intended to preserve a shared Greek memory at a time when political autonomy was lost and new stylistic patterns and ideological models were being imported from outside by the new Roman rulers.\n\nAthens was an ancient city like no other. Named for a goddess, epicenter of the first democracy, birthplace of tragic and comic theater, locus of the major philosophical schools, artistically in the vanguard for centuries, it looms larger than any other ancient polis in contemporary thought from historical scholarship to tourist attractions. The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Athens is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the ancient city, its topography and monuments, inhabitants and cultural institutions, religious rituals and politics. Chapters in the volume link the religious, cultural, and political institutions of Athens to the physical locales in which they took place, so that readers gain a sense of the life and realia of the ancient city. Discussion of the urban plan with its streets, gates, walls and public and private buildings will give readers a thorough understanding of how the city operated, how various people flowed through it, what they saw, heard, smelled and perhaps tasted. Drawing from the newest scholarship on various aspects of the city as well as on-going excavations of its Agora, sanctuaries, and cemeteries, this volume examines how the city was planned, how it functioned, and how it was transformed from a democratic polis into a Roman urbs."
