        "text": "An entrance ticket for the Acropolis includes the Parthenon, the Erechtheion and the remains of other monuments on the hill-top, as well as the North and South Slopes (which includes the Theatre of Dionysus, amongst other features). It does not include admission to the Odeon of Herodes Atticus (but you can get a good view into it from a path running above it), or the Acropolis Museum.\n\nA standard, single-entry timed Acropolis ticket costs €20 from 1 April to 31 October and €10 from 1 November to 31 March.\n\nChildren’s Ticket for the Acropolis: Anyone under 25 from an EU country (this no longer includes the UK) or under 5 from the rest of the world gets free entry throughout the year. During summer (April to October) those who are aged between 5 and 25 and from outside the EU get 50% reduced entry. You will need to show proof of age and address. A number of other people qualify for free or reduced entry. I provide a full list of people who qualify for free or reduced entry to the Acropolis below. For more on taking children to the Acropolis, read my Family-Friendly Tips for the Acropolis.\n\nThe ticket can be bought on the day at the ticket offices located at the two entrances to the Acropolis ticket offices, or online, in advance using either the Greek government’s website or reputable ticketing platforms such as GetYourGuide, Tiqets and Viator.\n\nIt is possible to buy tickets for the Acropolis at the site itself. There are two entrances to the Acropolis, and at both you can buy tickets. You will be able to purchase a single entry ticket to the Acropolis or a combination ticket.\n\nA ticket to the Acropolis will enable you to see the various monuments on top of the citadel – such as the Parthenon and Erechtheion, and the north and south slopes. A special combination tickets allows you entry to the Acropolis and six other archaeological sites, including Hadrian’s Library, the Roman Agora and the Ancient Agora (full details further below).\n\nThere is a third entrance, which is used for visitors with mobility issues that wish to use the lift to get up to the top of the Acropolis. This is located a few metres to the left of the main entrance; you will see the buggies used to take visitors to the lift at the base of the north cliffs. This is also the main exit for the Acropolis.\n\nBuying Acropolis Tickets Today: If you are standing in the ticket queue now, and want to buy an entry ticket for today, the best online option is Tiqets or GetYourGuide.\n\nThe photographs above were taken in early October, 2021, at about 10 am. The queues at both entrances continue out of shot. I asked people at the front of both lines how long they had been waiting. The consensus was about 45 to 50 minutes at both. I have seen similar queues in April. In summer, the height of the tourist season (May to September), you can wait up to two hours in a queue to buy tickets.\n\nYou will probably have read that the south entrance is much quicker. This advice is usually coming from people who visited the Acropolis five or more years ago. In recent years, following this advice, and particularly for busy periods, both queues are about the same. If you go early or late, then the queues will be much shorter, and then I would probably choose the south entrance over the main entrance at the western end of the site.\n\nBut as the two entrances are only a ten minute walk from each other, check for yourself which is quicker.\n\nNote: the queues in the photographs are to purchase tickets. If you have not bought a ticket in advance, either buy an entry ticket on your mobile (a number of people do this at the entrance) or buy a combination ticket at a nearby site (where the queues are negligible or non-existent) and then use that ticket to enter the Acropolis. You will avoid the ticket purchasing queue.\n\nTo get your tickets online, visit Hellenic Heritage (official e-ticketing service of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports). This is the official website of the Greek government, Archaeology Travel is not associated with them in any way. The website is available in Greek and English – I have provided step-by-step instructions with screenshots for each step at the end of this page.\n\nDue to the price difference between winter (November to March) and summer (April to October), it is only possible to buy tickets for visits in the current period. For example, in February 2024, you are only able to buy tickets for dates until 31 March, not for dates after 1 April for the rest of 2024. Similarly, on 2 November 2024, you are only able to buy entry tickets for dates until 31 March 2025. This applies to the official website and some of the reputable distributors. The only website I know of that does sell in advance, is GetYourGuide.\n\nWARNING: Before Purchasing from the official website, Please Note:\n\nFrom the Terms & Conditions, clause 3.19: “… after the completion of the transaction, it is not possible to change the ticket details, cancel or return the ticket, as well as refund for any reason. Furthermore, the value of tickets that have been lost, stolen, or destroyed is not covered.”\n\nI frequently get emails from our readers saying they made an error in buying their tickets (entered the wrong dates, made a mistake entering their email address are two of the most common errors), or that they wish to change the dates because their travel plans have changed. They emailed the department selling the tickets using the address provided. And the response, if they got one, was an emphatic ‘tough luck, read the Terms & Conditions’. The official providers will not refund tickets bought in error, or make any refunds at all. So that means if your plans change, you can not change your tickets either. So 1) be careful entering the dates/number of tickets you want, and 2) be sure you have the final date.\n\nAlso, the readers mentioned above were lucky to get a reply. The inbox frequently fills up, particularly in summer, and so new emails are rejected. These are not scare tactics. Data protection and privacy prevents me showing actual screencaps of these emails I receive. It is a sad truth, buying from the official website is not reliable.\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly recommend buying a ticket from our recognised partners (see the ‘timed-entry tickets’ section below). You *can* cancel your purchase up to 24 hours in advance, and get a full refund. How can these vendors get a refund and you can’t? Quite simply, they are taking your reservation, they are buying in bulk and they buy as required on the day. In my opinion, based on the substantial feedback I get from readers, a few Euros extra is worth it.\n\nBuying timed entry tickets for the Acropolis that allow for refunds, changes of plans, errors is possible, and can be done quite easily and safely online. For reliability and security, we recommend our partners GetYourGuide and Tiqets.\n\nA timed-entry ticket + Audio Tour with GetYourGuide is €13 in winter and €24.50 in summer (Available for Winter 2023/4 and Summer 2024 – until 31 October 2024)\n\nA timed-entry ticket with Tiqets is €12.90 in winter and €22.00 in summer (Available now for Winter 2023/4 – to 31 March 2024)\n\nThe difference in the prices reflect the conditions of the tickets: the Tiqets includes free cancellation up to 24 hours before with a full refund, with the option to purchase insurance for the last 24 hours. Whereas if you purchase the GetYourGuide ticket there is no possibility to cancel for a full refund.\n\nThese prices, compared to the €10 (winter) €20 (summer) ticket at the gate, includes a booking fee. And applies only to a single entry ticket to the Acropolis and its North and South Slopes.\n\nOnce purchased, confirmation and further instructions are emailed to you immediately.\n\nPlease note: you can cancel your booking up to 24 hours in advance and get a full refund (with the Tiqets ticket only). So, if you find you have made a mistake with your dates (this happens – I get emails about it) or your plans change, you can get a full refund as long as you cancel at least 24 hours in advance. There is no refund for such errors or changes of plans if you buy your tickets on the official website. You need to decide whether the time saved and peace of mind is worth the booking fee – only you can make that decision.\n\nPlease Note: The Combo ticket is not recommended if you are visiting Athens during the winter months (November to March). It is cheaper to buy the tickets individually. Read on for a full explanation.\n\nIf you are also going to be visiting some of the other main archaeology sites in Athens, then I recommend getting yourself a Combination or Special Package Ticket – via Tiqets or GetYourGuide. Prices can vary if one or other supplier is having a special offer, so do check the difference at the time you book.\n\nHolders of the Combo Ticket get one entry to the Acropolis (which includes the Parthenon, the Erechtheion and all the other monuments on the Acropolis) with its North and South Slopes (Odeon of Herodes Atticus and Theatre of Dionysus), as well as six of the other main archaeological sites in Athens: Hadrian’s Library, the Ancient Agora, the Roman Agora, Archaeological Site of Lykeion, Kerameikos and the Olympieion (see further details below). There are also museums in the Ancient Agora, Hadrian’s Library and the Kerameikos cemetery, and these are included in the entrance ticket for these sites.\n\nThe combo ticket is valid for five days.\n\nThe cost of the combination ticket is €30 per person, all year round, there is no winter discount.\n\nThe combination ticket can be purchased at the ticket offices of the participating archaeological sites, online at either the Greek Ministry of Culture’s website.\n\nBuying the combination ticket via Tiqets is €33 as opposed to €30 at the sites or on the Greek Government’s website. There are a few benefits to the Tiqets ticket that do not come with the standard government ticket, which in my view more than makes up for the €3 booking fee.\n\nFirst, you can reschedule your Tiqets ticket, whereas this is not possible via the Greek government’s website.\n\nSecond, once you have completed the purchase on Tiqets, you will receive your ticket via email – straight to your mobile/smartphone. No queues to pick up a paper ticket are required. When you purchase a ticket on the Greek website you will receive a confirmation of your order via email. You are then required to take the ticket to the ticket office (standing in the queues) and get the actual ticket that you then present to enter the sites.\n\nThe Greek website is unreliable. Read their Terms and Conditions, if anything goes wrong while purchasing your tickets, you will have to send an email and wait for a reply. The Tiqets website is available in many languages, and you can pay in many currencies and, most importantly, they have very responsive customer services should anything go wrong with your purchase. In my view €3 is a small price to pay for convenience, security and peace of mind.\n\nWhen demand for tickets is high, anytime from April to September, when you click on the link to Tiqets, you will see that they are sold out. The combination ticket is also available on GetYourGuide and Viator. Although a bit more expensive than Tiqets (hence why it is not top of our list), the Viator ticket does include free cancellation and the GetYourGuide ticket comes with audio guides.\n\nThe answer to this question depends, as it does with all combination tickets/passes and bundles, on how many sites you want to visit. The Combo Ticket includes SEVEN sites, and is valid for five days. And with this particular ticket package, there is a significant difference between summer and winter prices.\n\nTo pay the standard entry to each site included on the Combo Ticket individually would cost €64 during the summer months (1 April to 31 October). So, for example, visiting the Acropolis (€20) and the Ancient Agora (€10) would cover the cost of the Combo Ticket. As would visiting the Acropolis and any two of the other seven sites included in the scheme.\n\nIf you are eligible for a 50% reduction in summer (see the list below below), this only entitles you to a reduction when purchasing a ticket for a single entry at each site. You can not buy the Combo Ticket at a 50% reduction. Paying the reduced entry for each site would cost you €32. So you would only save money with the Combo Ticket (€30) if you visited each of the seven sites (€32).\n\nIn the winter months (1 November to 31 March) everyone pays the reduced rate (50% of the standard cost) at each of the seven sites, unless you are entitled to free entry (see the list below). There is no further 50% reduction on the reduced fee for those people who are eligible for the 50% discount during summer. There is no reduction during winter on the price of the Combo Ticket. So the total cost for entry to each of the seven sites during winter is €32 (unless you qualify for free entry). That is only €2 more than the cost of the Combo Ticket. If you only intend to visit three or four sites during a visit in winter, the Special Ticket Package is not worth it. If you visit all but the Archaeological Site of Lykeion, you will break even. If you skip, for example, the Roman Agora you will have paid €2 more than you would have done paying for each site separately.\n\nACROPOLIS\n\nThe sacred rock in the city of modern day Athens is one of the most well known archaeological sites in the World, and the most visited attraction in Athens. For ancient Athenians, it was the most important religious centre. Although occupied since the Neolithic, it was not until the 11th century BC that the Acropolis became the home of the cult of Athena. The monuments we visit today are much more recent, dating to the 5th century when Athens was at the height of its power. There are a number of religious buildings on top of the Acropolis, the most iconic of which is the Parthenon. The other well known structure is the Erechtheion.\n\nSingle Entry: €20 (reduced €10)\n\nNORTH & SOUTH SLOPES\n\nWhile most visitors to the Acropolis head straight for the top, there is much to see on the Northern and Southern Slopes of the Acropolis. The buildings on the slopes of the Acropolis reflect the religious and cultural importance this area had in Athens during the Archaic and Classical periods. Besides the relatively well preserved Odeon of Herodes Atticus and the Theatre of Dionysus, both slopes have a number of sanctuaries, churches and sacred caves. There are two separate entrances, the two slopes are joined by the Ancient Peripatos Street, so both the north and south slope count as a single site.\n\nEntry to the North and South Slopes is included with entry to the Acropolis, ie €20 (reduced €10)\n\nANCIENT AGORA\n\nFor Athenians, the Agora was not just a market place where they came daily to buy food and goods, it was also the political and judicial centre of the city. There are remains of many ancient temples, but it is the exceptionally well-preserved Temple of Hephaistos that catches everyone’s eye. The reason it is has survived so well is because it became a church in the 7th century AD. There are great views over the Agora to the Acropolis from the temple. The Entry to the Agora includes entry to the Museum of the Ancient Agora – housed in the restored Stoa of Attalos, which has a vast and impressive collection of artefacts.\n\nSingle Entry: €10 (reduced €5) Ancient Agora only with audio guide\n\nROMAN AGORA\n\nNot far from the Ancient Agora is the 1st century BC Roman Agora. An inscription on site lists Augustus and Julius Caesar as donors for its construction, don’t miss this on your way in. The agora was a large courtyard surrounded by stoas, shops and other commercial buildings. Just beyond the agora, but within the boundary of the site as it is today are the remains of the public toilets and the octagonal Tower of the Winds, built for astronomical purposes housing a hydraulic clock. The tower has some exquisite carvings that depict the ‘eight winds’.\n\nSingle Entry: 8€ (reduced €4) Roman Agora only with audio guide\n\nARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE OF KERAMEIKOS\n\nOn the northwestern fringes of the ancient city of Athens is Kerameikos. As the name suggests this was an area that was once inhabited by potters. But it is also the site of the oldest and largest Attic cemetery. Walls surround an enormous archaeological site that has a wide range of ancient funerary monuments and structures, from a tumulus mound to family tombs and individual columns. On site, and included in the entry fee is the Archaeological Museum of Kerameikos. The museum houses the artefacts recovered from archaeological excavations, and are displayed to show the changing funerary practices in ancient Athens.\n\nSingle Entry: €8 (reduced €4) Kerameikos only with audio guide\n\nLYKEION\n\nDuring recent rescue excavations the remains of an ancient palaestra were discovered. This was the legendary Gymnasium of Lykeion (Lyceum). Historical sources suggest this area was an idyllic grove, it is best known to us as the location of Aristotle’s school of philosophy. The name comes from the sanctuary of Apollo Lykeios, which was built sometime before the gymnasium. But sadly this temple was not found during the archaeological investigation of this site. For visitors today a surface area of 0.25 hectares (50 x 48 m.) has been exposed, revealing part of the palaestra where athletes trained in wrestling and boxing.\n\nSingle Entry: €4 (reduced €2)\n\nHADRIAN’S LIBRARY\n\nBuilt in 132 Ad, Hadrian’s Library was a gift from the Roman Emperor Hadrian, hence its name, to the people of Athens. Hadrian was an ardent cultural Hellenophile, and he did much to leave his mark here. Today we enter the site from the west at the imposing Pentelic marble façade, with its monumental Corinthian propylon, or gateway. The library was a rectangular peristyle structure with an interior courtyard, 122 by 82 metres. The ‘library’ where the papyrus books were stored is on the eastern side. A small onsite exhibition room houses a colossal statue of Nike and some other artefacts recovered.\n\nSingle Entry: €6 (reduced €3)\n\nOLYMPEION\n\nThe main attraction of the Olympieion is the colossal Temple of Olympian Zeus – one of the largest temples in the ancient world. Despite its size, you can not gaze at this monument through the fence, you have to stand at the foot of these massive columns (16 of the 104 are still standing) to appreciate just how big they are. Beyond the area of the enormous temple are the remains of other urban structures, including a Roman bath house, various residences, a 5th century basilica, and remnants of the city’s fortification wall. Just outside the site, next to one of the busiest streets in Athens is Hadrian’s Arch.\n\nSingle Entry: €8 (reduced €4) Temple of Olympian Zeus only with audio guide\n\nFor €45 you can buy a ticket for a Guided Tour of the Acropolis online at the GetYourGuide website. This ticket includes timed-entry to the Acropolis and a one and a half hour tour with a local guide.\n\nGetYourGuide has a number of different walking tours to choose from. These vary in length, and what sites are included on the tour. Taking these does give you timed-entry, but entry fees are not always included. The reason being some people might already have a multi-site pass, or be eligible for discounts.\n\nA popular option, suited to those who want a guide of some kind but not a guided tour with a person, is a timed-entry ticket with audio tour. For a small additional cost you can buy a timed-entry ticket that comes with an audio tour of the Acropolis. All you need is your own smartphone, with headphones. You get to avoid any queues, and an audio tour of the Acropolis with supporting information and an interactive map that you can access without requiring an internet connection. This is available for both Android and iOS devices, but only available in English, French and Spanish. Click here for More Information & Further Details >>\n\nBy far one of the most popular tickets, and I think the best value and so the tour I recommend for throughout the year is the five hour tour of Athens, the Acropolis and the new Acropolis Museum. For only €84 you get a guided tour (available in English and Spanish) with an actual person, not an audio-guide, of Athens (visiting the Panathinaikos Stadium, the Royal gardens and the former Royal Palace), the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. Entries to both the Acropolis and the museum are included in the price of the tour (€84)! And, this certified walking tour can be booked online at GetYourGuide.\n\nThere are over 60 ticket and guided tour options."
