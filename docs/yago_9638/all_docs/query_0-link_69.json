From Blues Fest to Jazz test to movies in the parks, there is always something going on. And when it gets hot and humid we head for the cool waters of Lake Michigan. The actress featured on our cover, the beautiful Tanya Dempsey, has also found a way to cool off; she caught up with the Good Humor truck. We’re thrilled to feature Ms. Dempsey because she represents the New School of horror film actresses. Combining tenacity with talent and a healthy dose of sexiness, Tanya has been taking the horror world by storm and there's no end in sight. Keep your eyes out lor this up-and-comer. She’s definitely on the move. We’re also excited to showcase the work of photographer Ward Boult, whose photo session with Ms Dempsey produced stirring imagery you won't soon forget. Kind of like Boudoir- phot ography-meets-the-Apocalypse. Boult, no stranger to this magazine, has the ability to strip away ^1 pretense and reveal a primitive sexuality in all of his subjects. His previous work was instrumental in making our 10th Anniversary issue such a raging success- One of our favorite articles in this issue is our retrospective on fifties sci-fi horror actress Joyce Meadows, who is best remembered from THE BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS. Ms. Meadows shares humorous anecdotes on what it was like to be a young ingenue in the '50s. On a final note, we had a blast at the first Chicago Fantastic Film Festival, where we had the great honor to meet the lovely actress Ingrid Pitt and see THE VAMPIRE LOVERS on the big screen in an old. beautiful theatre. While we were at the festival it was hard to lake our eyes of the beautiful and talented Joanna Cassidy, who is currently on the HBO runaway hit series SIX FEET UNDER. Last but not least, we had the pleasure of meeting Chicago native, the charming Stuart Gordon, and had the opportunity to see his most recent directorial effort the Lovecraft-inspired film, DAGON.

Alice Faye sings “I'm Always Chasing Rain- bow\" which was deleted from her hit 1939 film ROSE OF WASHING- TON SQUARE and “Get Out and Get Under\" from TIN PAN ALLEY released in 1940. Another unseen gem from the film is “The Rose Song Medley,\" sung by a stunning Betty Grable. This is terrific stuff from a bygone age available on DVD from (mage Enlertainment. • B-movie maestro David De- Coteau (SORORITY BABES IN THE SLIMEBALL BOWL-A-RAMA) has two new pics ready to go for the Halloween 2002 season. First up Is THE BROTHERHOOD ill: YOUNG DEMONS, which completed post production in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada. DeCoteau reports, “it’s NIGHT OF THE DEMONS meets LORD OF THE RINGS as a high school medieval society battles an ancient curse causing each student to transform into hideous demon slaves.\" Right on its heels is the Eric Roberts headliner WOLVES OF WALL STREET, featuring the de- lightful Eiisa Donovan (CLUELESS) and Louise Lasser (MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN). WOLVES, which follows sexy young stockbrokers by day/seductive werewolves by night, has just wrapped principal photography in NYC. •A genetic killing machine is on the prowl and its first victim is Brinke Stevens! Alpha Films VICIOUS, produced by Ken Porter, stars Tom Savini as a wacko military officer in charge of a top secret defense system and Melanie Parker as a young woman stalked by both Savini and the mutant creature he feeds. Director Matt Green says, Tom is supposed to be monitoring this experimental machine, but instead he’s feed- ing people to it. I wanted to do something in the woods but I wanted to stay away from campers and teenagers so I made everybody adults. In the film Brinke Stevens is being hunted down by Tom. He gels her by the arms and ties her to a tree and feeds her to the creature. We go to a military base and they realize that Tom has gone rogue and decide to take him out. They send a couple of people after him but he does away with them in short order.\" Melanie Parker is the female lead in the film. “Actually, she's the spokesperson for the Georgia film of- fice,” said Green. \"She hasn't done anything big yet. She's drop dead gor- geous and inoredibly talented. Parker was cast as 'Barbara' who is stalked by the crea- ture. “I didn’t like Bar- bara that much at first,\" said Parker, “because she’s kind of a stick in the mud. I had to work really hard to make her lik- able. She’s loyal to a fault and wants everybody to be okay and for everything to come out all right. She even worries about the guys she doesn't like. I tried to soft- en her up a bit. It was very impor- tant to me to have people like her and understand why this man is even with her.” Outside of Stevens and Savini, the cast is primarily made up of At- lanta actors. “I think what Matt was going for was less is more,” said Parker. “I think he had a pretty good group of actors. A lot of us had worked together in the past, so we had the chemistry. I think he was banking on stronger acting and less shock value.” Most of VICIOUS takes place in the woods and Parker and her fel- low actors were subjected to the rigors of location filming. \"We were out in the woods for three weeks,\" she said. “I smelled like Deep Woods Off for about a month after. There is a bug is southern Georgia called a Noseeum and unfortunate- ly you don’t see them, so everyone got bug bites. The last night when they drove us and the van into the water, I was freezing the whole night. We were in wet suits under- neath our costumes because it was i(Sty lake water. We did all our own stunts like the rock climbing scenes. It wasn't dangerous but it was physically •Stevens continues to defy her own plans for a break from her hecfic schedule. In February, the horror legend joined fellow icons Patricia Tallman (NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 1990), Denice Duff (THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS), and Julie Strain (THE INDEPENDENT) at the grand opening of \"Attack of the Killer B's,\" a new shop at the Hollywood Highland Complex/Kodak Theater in the heart of Hollywood. The store, operated by genre buff Nick Griffo, is loaded with B-movie memorabilia. Stevens reports. The entire store is done in genre motif. You enter through a spaceship and once inside see costumes, wigs, comic books.. .loads of great merchandise.\" The actress immediately moved on 1o a num- ber of new genre pics including HEADS ARE GONNA ROLE, written and directed by Vince D’Amato, and a remake of CARMILLA. Also, contrary to our report in FF 1 1 ;8, Stevens has reprised her role as \"Linda” in SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE IV...sortOf-.. “Linda did survive the original massacre and has become a recluse in the woods,\" Stevens divulges. Two officers come to her for help in try- ing to stop the new killer. It’s a fairly small role, ac- tually, and I think kind of an afterthought. I be- lieve they shot the rest of the film and realized they were short on time, so they went back (to ideas posted on the internet) and wrote her into the story so they could tie it to the first film. Lin- da's scenes are mostly surrounded by flash- backs. It also gives the sequel a 20th Anniver- scripts. Though Messing had worked with him on his comedy CELEBRiTY, it didn’t stop her from trying to get her hands on it. “i tried to bribe any- one who had a copy of the script, starting with (co-star) Tea (Leoni), but it never worked,\" Mess- ing iaughs. “i even flirled with the 'transpo' guys to get a piot point.\" The actress furthers her deci- sion to work with Alien a second time was, “a no-brainer. This is an artist who has had a hand in defining what comedy is in America. For me, it was a dream come true.\" •There are dueling Lois Lanes in the classic 1952 Red scare fiim iNVASiON, USA. A group of strangers meet in a bar and are hypnotized into a common nightmare where the communists attack the United States. Both Phyiiis Coates (FF11;7) and Noei Neiii, who foiiowed Coates in the roie of Lois Lane in the SUPERMAN TV show, appear in the film. Synapse Films is releasing the science fiction tale on DVD whioh includes a reissue trail- er, an interview with Noel Neill and RED NIGHTMARE, a pro- paganda film featuring Jack Webb and Jack Kelly. •Several people are try- ing to get a new version of Robin Hardy's erotically charged horror gem, THE WICKER MAN, off the ground. A cop goes to an isolated island to investigate the disappearance of a child. What he finds is a strange pagan cult and a horror he gets to witness first hand. Appar- ently, there are two different projects in the works. Hardy and Christopher Lee, the star of the origi- nal film version, have their script titled “The Rid- ing of the Laddie\" and were scouting locations in Sootland. Meanwhile, Universal Pictures owns the rights and Nicholas Cage has been attached to their version of the story set in the United States with director Neil LaBute. •PEARL OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC is being released on DVD by VCI. Originally released in 1 955 by RKO, the Technicolor fiim stars the love- ly Virginia Mayo as a bad girl who finds redemp- fion on a south sea island where she and her co- horts try to steal a fortune in pearls from an un- derwater cave guarded by a giant octopus. They don’t make 'em like this anymore. The beautiful blonde entered show business as a chorus girl,then danced her way into the movies, eventu- ally becoming a star in such films as THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950), THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (1946) and CAPTAIN HORATIO HORNBLOWER (1951). •Felissa Rose (FF 1 1 :5/6) jusf doesn't give up. Seemingly determined to snag the Scream Queen crown, the SLEEPAWAY CAMP alum has completed three new features in just the past few months. Among them is the killer-returning from the dead flick NIKOS. Due to a botched robbery attempt, a ruthless Romanian barbarian is some- how resurrected in modern day New York and begins wreaking havoc on a small Manhattan art-house. Chaos ensues as the patrons of the establishment band together to fight for their lives. Among Rose’s fellow victims are Debbie Rochon and Troma’s Lloyd Kaufman 1 Have a taste for something meaty?

Her tie-in to SPM may be short- lived. however, as a New Concorde rep has in- formed us, the film, directed by Jim Wynorski and produced by Roger Corman, Jr., has already undergone numerous title changes.

In HOLLYWOOD ENDING, Debra Messing portrays another off- kilter character, “Lori,\" an aspiring actress who's also dating the washed up, neurotic director (Woody Allen) of her potentially big break- through frlm. Amusingly, Allen, who also wrote and direct- ed, is known for not showing his actors complete RECIPE, written and directed by Jeff Hayes, who heads up www.sleepawaycampmovies.com, and added SC director Robert Hiltzik into the stew. After brutally stabbing her snotty grand-daughter to death, a sly Grandmother (Barbara O’Connor) tries to coerce her son Jimmy (James P. O’Con- nor) into disposing of the body. But can panic-rid- dled Jimmy do such a dirty deed and handle keeping such a deep dark secret? Rose rounds out the list with the non-horror movie MOB DAZE.The self-explanatory comedy, written and directed by Chris Watson, includes a list of B-movie favorites including Robert Z’Dar (MANIAC COP trilogy), Joe Estevez (BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND), Cecilia Bergqvist (PRETTY COOL), Eric Edwards (BLADE), Ari Bavel (CATACOMBS).

It was great,\" she says 'She was very professional and told me what to do, as she was much more experienced.

We had the guys from HELLRAIS- ER doing the FX makeup, so I was in good hands.” The film offers amble opportunity to see Bouf- fante's body. How does she handle nudity? \"It depends on the director and how much I trust him, or how he makes me feel,\" fie actress reports. \"Usually, once I've done the initial stripping down, I'm very comfortable and almost empowered, as everyone gves you instant respect onset\" •On the heels of Full Moon's successful Urban horror label Big Oty Pictures, which released hits like KILLJOY 1 S 2 and THE VAULT, York Entertainment has created its own genre arm.'itxk Urban.

I didn’t actually foil in love with someone until ol- most two years ago, and realized then that it would've been better if I'd waited.\" She pauses. \"Sex,” she sighs. \"There’s so much you can do on your own. To share youraelf with one per- son for the first time, make sure it's the right one.. ..but I knowhow it is,” she laughs. \"God, I love sex.\" And so our interview begins. With such free-spirited talk as this, she may give the illusion of being an open book. Don’t let her fool you. While she has no qualms discussing the art of eroticism, she tends to keep an im- penetrable shield around her personal life. She refuses to discuss any of her relationships, past or present. What Nikki wants to talk obout is the work, such as her role in the feature film GO, where she plays opposite actor Taye Diggs, who mode his debut per- formance in HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK. \"Tone McClure and I ploy strippers in this little sleaze club called 'The Crozy Horse.' Our scene Is the catolyst for the rest of the movie. All hell breaks loose from there.\" The two women were also featured prominently in the film’s trailers and television commercials— a pretty big deal for two B-movie queens working on their first mainstreom release. “The best thing about being in that movie was getting to work with [SWINGERS] director Doug Liman. He does all of his own cin- ematography. To have him direct you in a shot and actually see what he's looking at through the lens is really o sign of what an amazing director he is. He rules. The film is wonderful.\" Nikki and Tone, good pals in real life, were also seen together in a new late night cable series last foil. \"The show is about a bar called Quench, but they've decided to change the name of the show from QUENCH to INTIMATE STRANGERS or INTIMATE PAS- SIONS. I'm not even sure they ever decided on a fitlel” Whotev- er it's called, you know it’s bound to be intimate. \"We're the se- ries regulars, it’s sort of like CHEERS meets RED SHOE DIARIES and we're the girls who own the bar. I think it’s going to be a great success. The quality is as good as RED SHOE, if not better, and they took a lot of care Into hiring the best actorsi\" \"Nikki's the best thing that ever hoppened to the world,\" pro- fesses fellow genre actress Kira Reed, with such sincerity it's diffi- cult not to believe her. \"We quickly became friends on the set of SECRET PLACES. She's just such a great presence to have “I can be sexy and still be an intelligent woman who is taken seriously as an actress.” Clockwise: Nikki and pal Shannon Tweed; With Jay Richardson in FUGiTiVE RAGE; Ciowning with Robert Hedgyes on the set of PANDORA PROJECT; A scene from HYBRiDi Perky and platinum in EXOTIC TIME MACHINE; with G. Gordon LIddy after posing for his calendar, and with David Hasselhoff on BAYWATCH. around. She's a together chick, a great actor, and you know, we’re all incredibly jealous of her body.\" Nikki's presence has been showcased on the world wide web since the down of the Internet. Turning her into a full-fledged en- trepreneur, Ms. Fritz weors the title of webmistress proudly, and she weors it well. She recently gave her site, NikkiFrirz.com. a seri- ous makeover, featuring live appearances with Nikki and all of her gal pals. “I get bored, sit at home, end start to change things,\" she soys. What you don’t find anywhere are her private diaries or her life story. \"My life isn't all that interesting,” she claims. \"I woke up in the morning to my decaf coffee, you know, I answer e-mails, I do billing or shipping, I go on my auditions, or maybe shoot a film. I work a lot.\" Hmm, independent and humble about it? Now there's a unique combination. \"Well,\" she laughs. \"I just work. I'm a legend in my own living room I suppose.\" She'll admit she enjoys conversing much more obout other people's lives than her own. Throughout junior high and high school in her hometown of Homestead, Florida, Nikki was a cheerleader, though not your overage cheerleader. \"I played almost every wind instrument in the band and I wos considered a nerd. I was really into math and horses. That was my life. I was- n't a party girl.\" A cheerleader nerdl Sounds like the title to one of her movies. So when exactly did Nikki become a wild child? \"I don't think I am wiidi I'm just independent. Granted, I mean, choosing to be an actress who does erotic work is kind of wild, I suppose. I'm just so desensitized to it, at this point I hove no clue. I guess I am kind of wild, huh?” Nikki mode her first fiim appearance in SPRING BREAK, while still living in Homestead. With one I movie under her belt, she was hooked, and moved f to Los Angeies to become an actress. “Instead, I'm i now working as a waitress,\" she jokes. Today, she hos over fifty movies and television shows on her ex- ' tensive resume. Still, with all her success, her family is primarily unsupportive of the work she’s done. \"My mother thinks they're pornos,” she says stoically, \"and that's okay. We just don't talk about it. I don't ask for my family's opinion because I know I don't want to hear it. There comes a point in your life when you realize you no longer need anyone's per- mission to do what you know is right for you. I don't need their permission anymore. \"My dad wos pretty cool about it, I suppose. I didn't know that though until after he passed away. His wife started telling me that he used to brag about my movies and give them to his friends to watch. He was supportive.\" She certoinly has the support of her fans, not to mention the enduring kudos of many directors and B-movie critics across the map. Joe Bob Briggs called her performance in DINOSAUR ISLAND, \"In- crediblel Like a GOLDFINGER dancer on ocid!\" When legendary B-movie mogul Fred Olen Ray was osked tor his opinion of Nikki, he simply laughed and said, “I love Nikki to death and she's a great actress, but anything else I say is going to come out X-rat- ed.\" It was films like DINOSAUR ISLAND which labeled her as a scream queen in the early 1990's. \"But I never considered myself a scream queen,\" she in- terrupts. “People like Michelle [Bauer] and Linnea [Quigley] own that title. Girls like me, who came in aften/vards, have no right to thot title. They just don't have a name for girls like me. You really can't even say that we're low-budget or independent actress- es, because we have such a different style. We've all been studying for years. We take the work very seriously. We're not porn stars, but we will get noked.\" Aside from being a professionol, she's also unbe- lievably intelligent. Both traits contradict most peo- ple's definition of a typical B-movie bimbo. She has an overwhelming sense of confidence about her- self. She stonds firmly in her beliefs and speaks out only on specific issues she feels will enlighten those who are willing to listen. For a moment, I wonder if beneath the sexy sur- face, whot Nikki Fritz wants most is to be a role mod- el, or at the very least, a leader of sorts. But then, who’s to say she isn't already? \"Most of my fans out there know 1 don’t toke any mind-altering sub- stances,\" she justifies. \"I’ve olways mode it very clear that I don't need them or condone taking them. I just don't see what good can come of it.\" Just onofher contradiction in what many feel a sexy starlet is by nature, and in the end, it is what Nikki really wants to be remembered for. \"I just want to be known os the one who beat the system.\" she smiles. \"With all the stipulations out there thot you con't do nudity and be a successful actress,.! want to prove all of that wrong. 1 can be naked, I can do erotic films, I can be sexy, ond still be an intelligent woman who is taken seriously as an actress.” With that said, there’s no need to convince me any further. Check pieose! □ Laurie Wallace invites you to step into the Playboy monsion by Don Scapperotti T he old haunted mirror trick is given o sexy twist in THE EROTIC MIRROR, 0 new film from e.i. Cinema. Amy and her boyfriend stumble on an out-of-the-way second hand store. Looking into a strange mirror, Amy is suddenly aroused by the image of a woman [ployed by Dorian Caine) in the gloss. Taking it home, Amy discovers not only does her new acquisition arouse her sexuol pro- clivities, but those of her friends who look into its depths. Laurie Wollace, the beautiful actress who stars as Amy, was modeling for Ptoyboy and hosting parties at the Playboy Monsion for Playboy.com. This year, she's up for the \"Readers Choice Model of the Year\" title. Her frequent visits to sunny California prompted the blonde to pull up stakes and move. \"I go to the mansion for big porties,\" Wallace said. \"I was the Playboy.com party girt and I would go to the mansion and interview celebrities Oke Dan Akroyd and Ron Stewart on Hef's rototing, vibrating round bed. P/oyboy.com would then make that into o half-hour show, which you can download on Playboy.com. That's what got me hooked on California. I came out here last year to host Hef’s 75th birthdoy and the Midsummer’s Nights Dreom Porty. I liked the weather out here. No matter whot areas of the business I'm involved in, whether it’s more mainstream or more adult, there is just so much more out here to do, so it was the place to go.\" THE EROTIC MIRROR was 0 challenge for the young actress who made a brief appeoronce in BIG DADDY, ond is a veteran of sev- eral films, including two entries in THE EROTIC WITCH PROJECT series. “It was a lot of fun,” she said. “1 worked in the post with the people from e.i. Cinema and they contacted me to see if I would be interested, so I said sure.\" Interestingly, Wallace had come to Los Angeles to further her acting aspirations, but somewhere along the way her plans altered. \"I've changed my mind about that,\" she said. \"I can't stand octing. I'm completely uninterested in it and basically I'm too results- oriented. I love hosting ond doing interviews and that sort of thing.\" TTne many contocts Wallace made among actresses. Playmates, and Penthouse Pets encouraged her to start her own website, ond toun'ewa/tace.com was launched. \"I produced my own videos with my webmaster. It seemed to moke sense to do my own stuff.\" said Wallace. \"Then I get to hove a say in how the whole thing comes together and vriiaf st^rie it is going to be and how it is going to be shot. We've been doing an erotic adventure series called THE LAURIE WALLACE EROTIC ADVENTURE SERIES. I go and find exdting locations like Mexico and Miami, We did one at the Mardi Gras and, of course. Las Vegas. I hook up with very beautiful girls and we get kind of wild and crazy.\" Recently, Wallace hooked up with legendary internet guru Danni Ashe, whose profitable website made the front page of the Wof/SfreetJouma/severalyearsago. ‘‘I’mworkingo lotwith Danni's Hard Drive,\" Wallace said. \"I've become a guest host for ‘In Bed With Donni,’ which is a live broadcast that airs every Friday night ot 5p.m. west coast time.

With titles like SEXU- AL ROULEHE, MIDNIGHT TEASE II, TARGET OF SEDUCTION, AND STRIP SHOW leaping off the octress's resume, it wouldn’t take a rocket scientist to understand her excitabili- ty over the rare juicy role landing in her proverbial lap. Of course, little did either of us know then. TRANCE would become one of Tone McClure's final performances for the world of B-movies. Over the past four yeors, McClure has evolved from erotic movie siren to an up- and-comer of the mainstream flm world, a feat few actresses of the B’s are oble to achieve. With prominent roles in theotrically releosed features like LEGALLY BLONDE, GO, FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, and SHADOW HOUR, one has to wonder if Tone will eventually become our cottage indus- try's next Sharon Stone breokout story. Only time will tell. For now, however. Tone is hap- pier than she’s ever been, both personally and professionally, as she nurtures her three- year-old daughter, Kaylo, as well as a much more solid resume. \"I've never told anyone this,\" Tone be- gins to reveol, “but if you want to know whot reolly prompted me to get into B- movies in the first place, it was Shonnon Tweed. It was a little over seven yeors ago, and I'd just finished my first couple of films, I think I'd only done CRAWLSPACE and HOT UNDER THE COLLAR, ond I was watching some Andrew Stevens movie that starred Isa/vm^ bang tie next that became Shonnon Tweed on television one night. I looked at her performance and I soid to myself, 'I could do that,’ Somehow 1 saw myself being the next Shannon Tweed and thot became my goal then, to pursue the genre.\" Years loter, McClure would succeed Tweed, os she took over mony of the Play- mote's former roles in Stevens' Pirns. \"Direc- tor Andrew Stevens even started costing me based on her,\" she exploins. \"For exam- ple, Shannon Tweed’s role in SCORNED, I took over in the sequel, SCORNED 2: HELL HATH NO FURY, And, like her, 1 always be- lieved I would be a good enough actress to use those movies as a tool ond break out. B- movies ore a great place to learn. You don't have the luxury of fantasfic direction, countless takes, perfect camera angles, or music that enhances the mood. If you wotch o B-movie and think that an actor or actress is actually okay in it, I’m going to tell you, thot person is probobly better than okay. They’re probobly really good. You just have to consider the circumstances. I would constontly find myself looking past the low-budget aspect and looking past all the sex scenes when I'd watch my work. Like when I sow BARE DECEPTION, it was yet another erotic thriller, but it was releosed on shelves at Blockbuster and did very well. I play a radio talk show host in the movie, and I really liked my performance in it, but only I could appreciate it because I was purposely looking past the fact that there’s a sex scene every few minutes. No one else is going to do that,\" Another genre that actors have always cited os being o good place to learn their craft has been the infamous school of soap opera acting. McClure had her own taste when she guest storred as a recurring char- acter on DAYS OF OUR LIVES in 1999. \"That was one of the first crossover things that I did,\" she says. \"It didn’t feel all that different because I was playing o stripper! But I hod a Below: Tane tortures Alexander Keith in SCORNED 2, and does the same damage to Kimberely Kelley {bottom right) in MIDNIGHT TEASE II. Tane sizzles In a sequined bikini on the beach In RAVEN'S KISS (below, middle). lot of dialogue, I had a character, and found thot there ore few differences be- tween the soap opera and B-movie worid. There’s little to no rehearsol, ond you have to know your lines because they don't want to do a lot of takes. They just don’t hove time. It’s bmg, boom, bam on a soop opero. The only real difference is thot if you're working with o girl who is brain dead ond can't remember her lines to save her life, on o B-movie she might be hired again because she'll take her clothes off, but on a soap opera, she’d never work again. It basi- cally boils down to o higher sense of profes- sionalism.\" That higher sense of professionalism boosted McClure’s self-esteem and sent her on a mission to book more mainstream projects, the next of which was working op- posite Nikki Fritz in Doug Liman's highly-ac- claimed feature film, GO. “And here again. I’m stuck in a stripper role,\" she laughs, \"but it was another stepping stone towords get- ting me out of the B's.\" While the ladies' roles moy hove been tiny, the charocters were essential to the plot as their lone scene is the catalyst to the second act of the movie. McClure and Fritz mode the most of their moment, showcasing their spunk to the point that Columbia/Tri-Star used them prominently in the movie's theatrical trailer. \"Yeah, that was the really big thingl Even more than being in that movie, the fact thot we were all over television and all over theatres in that trailer is what really im- pressed me.\" GO played an instrumental role, not only in McClure’s move to molnstream, but even in her booking her most shining moment to dote, playing mother to Reese Wither- spoon's Elle in the Golden Globe nominat- ed, LEGALLY BLONDE. \"Joseph Mittleton, who cost me in GO, was also the costing di- rector for LEGALLY BLONDE a year-and-o- half later. I knew this going into the audition, so I went into it with totally different clothes, totally different makeup, really trying to make myself look a lot older than I am. Of course, I walk in and he looks at me and im- mediately goes. '1 know you.’ So I didn't lie to him. I told him that he had cost me in o movie, but that I wasn't going to remind him of what it was until after 1 was done reading for this part. So I read the scene and while I’m reading, he’s looking at me. He starts smiling, looks down my resume, starts laughing and says, ‘You're right, if I had cought on, I wouldn't have given you o fair chance.' But he did, after that! He was so nice. He had me reod the scene three times and worked with me on tech- niques before soying he thought I could re- ally get the part, I still walked out of there thinking it was a long-shot to be cost as a mom from the some person who cast me os a stripper, but as it turns out, I got the kiss tone gives the undead a kiss to remember. by dan scapperotti When Richard Clark learns that his wife is having an affair, he decides to divorce her. Not so fast. That means she'll get most of his money. At first, he Imagines killing her. Then he imagines her killing him. When Clark sees a TV commercial it looks like his problems are solved. Kiss of Death inc. offers an undead way out. Dialing 888-BITEME, Clork arranges to be- come a member of the vompire community in FATAL KISS, o new short comedy film from producer, director, star Jeff Rector. \"I’m a working actor,” said Rector, who has appeared on such shows as BLACK SCORPION. SLIDERS and STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, “but I hadn’t reached that level of star- dom we all think about. I was driving one day and I was real- ly unhappy and I thought ‘What would make me happy?' A little voice said. ‘Make your own movie!'\" Along with his co-producers, twin brothers Vahe and Vache Garabedion, Rector started rounding up such familiar faces as James Karen, Ted Raimi and even Forest J. Acker- man for his film. He then put together a funny spoof of the vampire genre, without debasing the horror elements and took his show on the festival circuit. “Everyone seems to like it and laugh at it at the film festivals,” said Rector. “We got into Screamfest, which is a local horror festivoi, and I won best di- rector and best actor and actually beat out Mark Homil who was nominated for best actor for a little scifi short film he was in called EARTH DAY. That was kind of cool. I beat out Luke Skywalker. I grew up with scifi and horror os a kid and I’m as big a fan as anybody.” Rector is such a fan, that he's the of- ficial spokesman for the Academy of Science Fiction, Fonta- sy ond Horror in Los Angeles. The film is stacked with beautiful women, including Tone McClure, Allison McCurdy, Cindy Guyver, Nichole Lennstrom and the Klimazcewski twins, Elaine ond Diane. McClure plays a seductive vampire who indoctrinates Clark into the ranks of the undeod. \"I’ve known Tone for years,\" said Rector, “and we did a lot of movies for the same producers and di- rectors, It was a very tough role to cast because she’s got to look voluptuous, she's got to be sexy, she’s got to be a terrif- ic actress and she hos got to be good wth comedy which is a pretty tough bill to fill. I auditioned at least forty to fifty women for the part. One of the things that held me back from casting Tone right oway was that she's a natural blonde, and I saw this as a sort of dark, Elvira-type.\" Rector actually contacted Elvira’s alter ego, Cassandra Peterson, but the actress wasn’t interested in doing a short-form film, Imogining himself os a vampire, Clark first conjures up im- ages of the traditional Transylvanian count, but quickly de- cides a more hip version is more to his liking. Outside of his castle, Clark is seducing a gorgeous blonde. That would be Cindy Guyer. \"She is the second most popular romance nov- el cover model next to Cindy Margollis as well as a top mod- el in New York. She plays Mina Von Helsing. At first, it was go- ing to be a little joke where we cut to Dracula’s castle and I bite her on the neck. We had no scripted lines, but we impro- vised and came up with some lines.\" When he decides he is more a 2l5t-cenfury guy, Clark en- visions himself a populor neck biter in a disco club with a pair of twins in his arms. The twins were Elaine and Diane Kli- mazcewski, who were in the season opener of ENTERPRISE. They played the twin butterfly girls in the bar scene who zapped the butterflies out of the air with their tongues. They were to be the featured players in that sequence but they get up staged. \"It was going to be a quick little bit,\" said Rector, \"but I did a favor for a friend of mine and threw in this little blonde who says 'Bite me Richard. Bite me.' The lines kind of made her more of the featured actress in that scene then the twins. Now, they’re looking more like bock- ground.” When he tries to toke o midnight snack in a deserted park, Clark runs into a Butty clone. “Nichole Lennstrom is o Sarah Michelle Geller lookalike,\" sold Rector. \"1 fly in os a bot and tronsform and land in a park. I attack her and she kicks my butt. She did her own flips and own fighting. She did every- thing.” \"He was so cute,” said Tone McClure about Rector's initial call. \"He said ‘I like your work as an octress, but 1 was really thinking of o brunette.’ I thought it was such o beguiling role that I had to sort of convince him I could play this dark, men- acing, yet seductive vampire. So, he and 1 went and got a long black brunette wig and basically created the charac- ter together. And once the character was in place, he said that it was exactly what he wanted. I had to keep the wig because I'm doing a couple of more vampire films. It sounds kind of simple, but its not. He was trying to create something he really believed in ond he erected something pretty solid. \"We picked out a whole fun outfit kind of Elvira meets Tone McClure. We wanted to make my character likable with an edge which was kind of fun. The FATAL KISS thing being brunette and being a little different was great because I'm always kind of cost as the sexy blonde.” □ a I aVvays believed I would be a good enough actress ,,,to break out, part.\" It is, by and large, the film that has gar- nered Tone McClure the most respect and more ottention thon any other in her career of almost a decade. “My agent will get calls based on people who saw the mother in LEGALLY BLONDE. They wont that type of character,\" she laughs. “And it's not even o huge role, which bummed me out because I’d shot so much more for the movie. My part was much bigger, but the problem was Ihot it was such rocy dialogue. They toned down the overall picture actually and cut every- one's diologue so that it could go from on R to a PG-13 rating.\" Working with Reese? \"She was very nice, very professional, much more serious than you would think. She takes her work very seri- ously. And that’s not to say that she wasn’t smiling or loughing on set or onyfhing, but she’s just a very focused actress. We’d do a scene ond she would fell the director how she thought it could be mode more funny, but she tolked to him about it very seriously, which was strange for me to see. It's probably what makes her such a great comedic actress. She really knows how to take control of her char- acter and create something with nice layers. “The greatest news of all is that Joseph Mit- tleton is also the casting director for the LEGALLY BLONDE television series that is being cast right now and my agent is calling over there to see if they can solidify me being in the series.\" It wouldn't be the first time McClure has found h^elf the star of a s^ies over the past couple of years. Her role in FOX television’s MANCHESTER PREP was much hyped, due in part to the series being based on the film CRUEL INTENTIONS. Controversial content, however, caused FOX to shut down produc- tion on the series, which was eventually turned into the indie film sequel CRUEL INTEN- TIONS 2, in which McClure starred. \"I was cast in MANCHESTER PREP as a ditzy, wealthy, sexy mom and I was playing opposite Mimi Rodgers’ steely gaze because her character absolutely hated me. She ployed the lead’s mom and I played the lead nemesis’ mom. The stronge thing is that Mimi didn’t act much different towards me when the comeros were off. That was slightly unnerving, but maybe that’s just her personolity. She certoinly is a good actress!\" McClure loughs, covering any ill will she might have mistakenly dropped along the way. \"1 felt like I'd finally made if when 1 booke that series,\" she continues. “There was much publicity for thot thing from the ginning. I could hardly sleep at night! then we’re shooting the second episode everyone comes to the set bummed out th day. I asked what was up and wos told that FOX was shutting down production for about two weeks because they were disgruntled about the scripts. They felt the series was too much because it was dealing with having sex and this was to be a show. A few doys later, l get a c< producer and he told me the ceiled due to creative differences, crushed.\" But just because the series was didn’t mean McClure's job wos over. The pro ducers and writers reworked the script, tin kered with the dialogue, expanded the and made a movie out of both existing and newly shot footage that became CRUEL TENTIONS 2. “If nothing else, it gave me sofne- thing to talk to Reese about when I did / LEGALLY BLONDE. It was something we had in^ ' common. She did the first movie and I did the* , second one,\" laughs McClure, a good sport through it oil. No matter the size of the roles, this hondfu! of mainstreom releases has had an enormous impact on Tone McClure’s life as an actress. It’s affected her self-esteem, it's taught her more about acting, and it has changed the overall direction of her career. “I would’ve been disoppointed if l hodn’t broken out even a little, as I have recently,\" soys McClure of her former days in B’s, \"only because needed to know I could get a part purely on my acting ability and not the that 1 would agree to take my clothes off simulate sex with someone. Acting has been whot it’s all about for me. I came on actor family. My father, Doug was a very fomous western actor ond he a very old-fashioned guy so it means a me that the stuff I’m working on now that he would be very proud of. And portantiy. I’m proud of myself. I could tent continuing to take little roles like mainstreom projects for the rest of being a character actress, that's me. 1 went up for two pilots c week and balancing that w'th my daughter hos mode me it’s all worth if becouse I’m ways wanted to do and I’m of my life.\" Visit her official website ot S MALLVILLE updates the legend of Superman for the modern generation with the story of Clark Kent in high school, discovering his powers for the first time. In this ver- sion, remnants of the meteor shower which brought Clark to Earth have caused supernatural occurrences in town. Nobody thinks too much about this except Chloe, the editor of the high school newspaper. Allison Mock plays Chioe, a conspiracy theorist who suspects otherworldly forces behind strange weekly events. Since the character is a creation of . SMALLVILLE producers Alfred Gough and Mites Millar, Mack feels a special sense of freedom unrestricted by prb^: conceived notions fans may have of characters like Clark Kerrt, Lex Luthor ond Lana Lang. “I am lucky because i pan .develop the character as I go,\" Mack said. \"[Chloe] is not a.cornic bp'dk chari^er. The writing plays it'soT: well that as an actor, I say the words . orid interpret whaf sin front of me, soTT* '^on'f hove t.o- think about it'too ^ much.\" _ii ‘ Mack learned everything about Superman from her older brother v/ho “used to dress up in a Superman outfit and run around the bouse pretending he could f ty. I was never really that into it, but I got to know the concept very well.” Every week, Clark pines after Lana Lang, 'but Mock say^ Chloe herself hos a subplot of unrequited love permeat- ing her character as well. \"I'm very much in love wilh Clark Kent and he . has, no idea that I exist romantically. I think that there's a jealousy that storfs from the beginning with my chcrocter to- wards [Lana], just because she gets what she wants>: she’s popular, he's in love with her and she's beautiful, that whole thing. There's definitely a conflict of romance be- tween the two of us.\" Most of the shows actfon has Clark bat- tling evil forces. The other characters, rf in- volved at all, tend to be damseis in distress for 'Clork to rescue. Mack hopes Chloe will eventually jbir'Clark in the physical fight, and has taken it upon herself to prepare for the day. \"i'm taiang boxing and kictooxing, stuff like that, so I'm training for it. I’li be pre- pared when and if they throw that storyline of me, but as of right now I’m not doing any sort of action stuff. Thai's all Clark Kent.” light. It changed as I got older from a hobby to a profession.” With feature film aspirations. Mack has dabbled In some theatrical roles including CAMP NOWHERE and direcf- fo-video movies like HONEY, WE SHRUNK OURSELVES. Though her career so far has kept her mosfty on television, she prefers the variety o film career would allow her fo the consistency of television. \"Film allows you to be more veRolile than television. Rather than ploying the same character for six years, you play four different characters in two years. If . allows you to explore different places. I have o very short attention span, sp I get bored. One of the great things about this character is there’s a lofrof .depth [to her] . It’s definitely nice in television to have a steady schedule and be dbleio get to.know a charac- ■ferfbr a long time, but there's ’al?©’ something to sayabout diving into a brand new character. I prefer that to' the evefVdoy security. I’ve been very lucky 'with the part that I’ve landed be- cause she's the type of character that I want to stay playing.\" And she has no regrets about playing the brainy character as opposed to the romantic lead of Lana Long. “I'm horrible at [playing] the love Interest because I can only stand there and look pretty for a short amount of time.” If the show leads to a feature film ca- reer, a common path might be to start in a teen hotror film, but that is one genre Mock fears would try her pa- tience. \"I don't know if I could do that. 1 did my first horror thing a few years ago and 1 don’t know how often I can scream at something that’s not there. It was a cable television show that I don't even know if it aired. 1 want to break the mold and not do a teen horrcx'. 1 don't think I’d be • very good of if. I much prefer the realistic character study type of thing.” With fifteen years in the business, Mack has maintained a life outside of Hollywood, thanks to her family upbringing. “My parents were very info keeping me normal. I lived forty-five minutes outside of the city, so I went home to regular kids playing soccer and dancing, things like that. I have a really fight-knit, down-to-earth family. I’ve seen a lot of kids growing up in the business get re- ally messed up. I just thank my lucky stars that I wosn't one of them.\" □ Chloe, the editor of the school paper, proves she’s no damsel in distress. As for relating to her character. Mack claims to be a selective conspiracy theorist, picking her battles. \"There’s a part of me thot definitely likes fo know what's behind the curtain but there's another port of me that likes fo believe in Santa Claus and be- lieve, in the fanciful side, so I think I'm mixed.” The 1 9-year-old Mock has been acting since the age of four. \"I started doing mod- eling because my mom thought I looked cute in clothes.

Ihe s/reefs are filled with fhe makeshift homes of vagranfs ond the sfrobing bu/bs of sfr/p- clubs. Unlike its glossed-up counterparts like West Hollyv/aod. which offer the same sights masked by the glamour of shiny BMWs ond Prado shoes, the downtown area is seared through its heart by Ihe joining of noisy free- ways and a caustic layer of rusty smog. It is an industrial area, seemingly dark and fore- boding. even during daylight hours. Photographer Ward Boult calls this area home. His apartment/studlo resides in an old warehouse, but its interior is breathtoking. Spacious and expressive, Boult has given his loft a rough, modern edge with black leather couches, enhanced by his authen- tic Alice Cooper jacket. Then you notice the photos. Stork black and white. Sometimes harsh, most bold and striking. Boult's models are typically women, though the occosion- al man sneaks in os well. Many of them are unfamiliar, yet somehow unforgettable. If you haven't heard of the splattertog- rapher, you're sure to know him well soon. He appeared as a psycho crock addict in 2000's HORRORVISION, can next be seen in the urban thriller CRYPTZ. and has been photographing the voluptuous ladies of Se- duction Cinema. Many in the horror indus- try have taken nofice of his talents in recent years. Mr. Boult even afforded me the op- portunity to see him ot work, as he pho- tographed Brinke Stevens. Judith O'Dea. Julie Strain, Lisa Wilcox and newcomer Tanya Dempsey. Don't let his black eyeliner and obsession with faux blood disuode you. He is o gentleman first ond foremost. As his models arrive at various levels of undress, he makes sure they are comfortoble. He is encouraging and honest. If they appear off balance at a certain ongie. he'll quietly ask them to shift. He displays nothing but pride in his work, and wants the rest of the world to realize how much beauty there is to the dork side. When did you first get into photography? 1 wos a really visual kid. Always taking pictures and drawing. When I wos twelve, I had a subscription to Playboy. I think if was around twelve dollars a year. I asked my mom if I could send away for it, and she said, 'Sure. If you0ayforit' She did- n't think I would do it. Then, once a month the magazines started to show up in the moil. My mom [was] like. ‘What the hell is this?!' And, I said, \"Hey mon, you said I could.\" I'll never forget the first time I got my hands on hardcore pornogra- phy. I was about thir- teen, and I found these really filthy porno books at school. It hit me hard, [with] a feeling in my abdomen, it was just so bad, man. I’ve always loved doing bad things. Bosicolly I om a good person in my heort. Tm just an ongel with a dirty face. I guess that's what I'm doing with my photogrophy and films. Trying to punch the viewer in the stomoch and give them thot \"this is so bad and I should- n't be doing this\" feel- ing. I've always loved horror movies. I remem- ber catching some old Bava film or something on CREATURE FEATURE when I was little. There was a scene that must have slipped by the TV censors. This really sexy blonde was hanging by chains from the ceiling of this cave totally naked and getting whipped. It went on for a while and I just stared. Even as a little kid, I was like \"Hey th/s is fuckin' hot.'\" I wish I knew what movie thot was. A pivotol moment in my sexuality for sure. Photography is the only real discipline in my life, becouse i am a rock-and-roll train wreck. I don't know if I'm any good at it. Pho- tography is just oil I know how to do. It's not a hobby. When I go on vacation, I don't take my cameras. Vour (mages ore dark, yet beautiful and stark. What inspires this? Well, Tm dark and stark. I didn't ask to be, it's just how 1 turned out. I don't know about beautiful. That's a relative term anyway. 1 don't think 1 see beauty the same way most people do. I've never been any good at the \"glomour\" look or \"pretty\" head- shots. I think that's what always bothered me obout fashion pho- togrophy. It's just so in- herently phony and so \"you look fem‘b/e cuz you don't look like me.\" I like people who look and live differently. To me beauty is scars, and bruises, and black eyes, and dirt. I like runny mascara, fucked up lip- stick, blood, and ripped stockings. I like to see people scream, growl, and spit, and cry. I want to shoot people throw- ing up. 1 like danger and anger, arrogance and attitude, violence. That's real and that's beautiful. Nothing is perfect, and perfection is nothing. I dunno...l am a little bit crazy. But. like Iggy Pop sang, \"/'m glad that I'm crazy, it keeps me trying. \" I am a loner. Always have been. I live in my warehouse studio, as I have for over ten years. It is my sanctuary and my prison. My pictures ore dark end stark be- cause they have to be. That's the way I see things and people. If the photos get too fan- cy or intricate, I get confused and forget what it is I want to cap- ture. 1 have to keep it simple or it gets away from me. I find that a stark black background is the best way to photo- graph someone, be- cause there's nothing there but them. I don't consider myself particu- larly talented or cre- ative. So, 1 have to keep it basic. Luckily, I get to work with some really great models, and that makes me look good. Also, most of the proj- ects I work on are low or no-budget deals. Any props I use are usually something the model brought, or I found in the dump- ster behind my building, or some junk I find on nightly walks around my neighborhood. I get ideas for lighting and poses from European horror films from the '60s and ’70s. Soledad Miranda was so beautiful and so graceful, and struck some great poses in \"Vampyros Lesbos.\" Erika Blanc, is another one. She was just so incredible in \"Devil's Nightmore.\" Do you prefer B&W to color? B&W definitely. It's different. Maybe because we see in color. Is. T4+.^ ONll iStecMISS. w MY 1I5=E, 1 A-M A- MCXhAlTtsMoU.., I do like some colors, like red. Why do YOU fh/nk your work stands out? Lately, I’ve been studying mystics who folk about being aware of \"the real\" and \"the magic\" parts of life. To paraphrase mystic An- drew Harvey, “All hu- man beings are given in the course of their iives glimpses info the heart of the real which they are free to pursue or for- get.\" I try to slow things down and be aware of these magic moments. To cherish them and re- member them. In my work, I try to be awore enough to capture these moments on film. My work is honest and simple. The Ward Boult \"look\" is something I've been working on for fifteen years. I don't know what it is. Perhaps if I knew, it would ruin the formula. I just try re- ally hard. I'm desperate, and, I'm looking for sides of people they haven't seen before. It is important to me that the models like how they look in the photos. A lot of them ore kind of surprised at what they look like screaming, or waving a gun, or cov- ered in blood. I’m not looking to steal people's souls. I just want to look at their souls for a mo- ment, and I think Ward Boult does that. For whatever reason, with my photographs, 1 am able to climb through people's eyes and into their heads. I can only do it with my camera. I'm not able to do it in my personal life. I don't relate to people very well. Maybe I'm a photo-savant... Recently, I've been making some short films here at my studio. I hove a film company called \"Splatterhead Films \" www.sptatter- head.nef. Of course, we have lots of really creepy, horrible ideos, but no money. We mode a bunch which I sold to e.i. Cin- ema. I wasn't crazy about most of the tilms we made. 1 don't know that they’ll ever turn up anywhere because a couple of them are really bloody. My favorite one was the last one we made colled FISHNET HEART with Bad Kitty and Pars. It was the only one where we weren't tethered to someone else's concept. I decided to make the film look like a Ward Boult photograph in motion. These two girls are dressed In fishnet bodysuits. There's a big knife, and they cut and rip the fishnets off while having sex against this stark white background. It's pretty hot. We cronked up the contrast and it really could be a still photo. Do people tend to per- ceive you as a hardass and int/midaf/ng based on your orf? I guess I walk around with a look on my face like, \"Don'f fuck with me,\" but that's just o defensive mask I've had my whole life. Inside, I'm probably thinking, ‘I hope this per- son likes me ond doesn't know that I'm dying in- side.’ When I work, I am a different person. In real fife. I'm just a boring, lone- ly, quiet, little mon who has six cats. I oniy go out if ifs business reiated, be- cause I'm just no good in crowds. I've always been cripplingly shy, but, vsriien I get behind the camera, I hove a confidence and power that I don't hove in regular life. I'm able to command and control the studio ond ask for what I wont. I get lost. It is o magical, scary place. Sometimes it surprises me when 1 catch myself talk- ing to a studio full of peo- ple. I don't think of myself as intimidating, but my work has o swagger and it's powerful and arro- gant, which I am not. What models/acfress- es/actors do you hope to work with some day? Yancy Butler, Eileen Daly, Linda Blair, Dia- manda Galas, Brigitte Lahaie, Barbara Steele, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Slymenstro Hyman, Monika M, PyroPhilia, Sheiiey from the LA rock bond BOMBER, any drag queen or transvestite. I'd love to shoot Jess Franco and Dario Argento, Clive Barker and H.G. Lewis. I shot the boxcovers for a couple of Franco's movies released by e.i. Independent Cinema— TENDER FLESH and LUST FOR FRANKENSTEIN— and, that was a huge thrill. I'd rather shoot Traci Lords than, say, a Meryl Streep. Lotely, my fovorite is Eileen Daly. She is just so incredibly hot. RAZOR BLADE SMILE is my favorite movie. I'd love to shoot her. \"1 rrW+Y, BUT Vf+et I B^NEu. T+l^ I do o lot of boxcover work for e.i. Cinema in NJ. Mike Raso and I have be- come great friends over the past couple of years, l think what he does is really important. They pick up a lot of Independent films which probably would not otherwise get a chance. They really get behind the films and give them a shot. They give the Tilms excellent boxart ond market- ing. They are honest, great guys. Hollywood is so horrible. It's a good thing that someone out there is trying to help small films. Would you consider your art fetish related, or is that just a porfiorj/aspect of SOME of your work? I prefer to think of myself as o \"splatter\" photogra- - pher. My fetish is sleeping... Fetish? What is fetish? I don't even know. It’s just my life. It is what goes on here. These are the places I find myself. The first time I knew that \"fetish\" was lame, was when my mom introduced me to someone as her \"son the fetish photographer.\" I knew then it had lost its edge... Is it your goal to open up the lifestyle to the outside world, or are you saying, \"Here it is, get over it?\" I don't care what the world thinks. I'm not here to preach. I'm not thot smart. I have enough trouble keeping of Ward. I don't know that Ward's way is the right or wrong way. It's simply my way. I’m just o creepy guy in LA who takes pictures. Moking people nervous, that sounds great. Like all \"work\" [I don't care for the word \"arf'), people have to figure out what it means to them. Perhaps I know what I'm trying to say, but I might not ex- plain it to you. You might hove a better explanation anyway. I have this really incredible new photograph of Julie Strain which we shot here ot my studio. She's totally naked, with wet hair and runny makeup, her legs are open and she's sitting in a big puddle of blood, screaming, wropped in a bloody American flag. Plus we shot it at the height of all of the flog waving. I love it. A lot of peo- ple look at it and think it's anti-American. To me the photograph is all-American. It's sex, money, and violence. Please talk about some of the girls you've photographed and how they were during the shoot... good or bad. In the last couple of years, I have had the opportunity to pho- tograph Brinke Stevens. Linneo Quigley, Michelle Bauer, Julie Strain, Debbie Rochon. and Amber Newman. That's the top of the horror actress list. Period, And, also, quite an honor. They were all delightful and so professional. I've shot Amber a bunch of times. One day we did this shot were she's naked except for ripped up stockings all over. I put them on her and then cut them off with scissors, which made her o little nervous. I even did her makeup with runny eyeliner and smeared lipstick. There's video of this some- where that Don Adams shot. Then I wrote \"£WL\" on her stomach in red lipstick, which is kind of weird because she was pregnant at the time. When I got her on the set, I poured water all over her. It was cold and she wos so miserable, but the pictures are so hot. She's so gorgeous even miserable and complaining with fucked up makeup. I think the photos are totolly Amber. I've shot Linneo a few times, but she doesn't feel like I ever took any good pictures of her. I hope we get to work together again someday. We're kindred spirits ond shore some of the same demons. I saw her in Florida in November. We hung out and went to see Alice Cooper ploy. After the show, I took her backstage. It was fun wotching two horror icons meet and folk. Debbie Rochon came down to the studio for a couple of hours during a break from shooting WITCHOUSE 3 lost sum- mer. We had fun. The pictures are feminine and powerful, like her. She has this great scor on her arm. I hope we shoot again. Maybe in some sleazy hotel room in NYC. Shooting Michelle Bauer for the LUST FOR FRANKENSTEIN box was a huge thrill. It was a rainy November day. I'll never forget watching Michelle climb out of her car In the parking lot. She looked just like she does in her films. She is stunning and so sexy and naughty. Michelle is like the Greta Garbo of horror, but I guess she saw the TENDER FLESH box we had shot with Am- ber, end decided to come out of refiremenf to work with me. It was really interesting shoot- ing her. For the first six frames of the first roll, she was really rusty. Then between frame six and seven there was this big vibe switch in the room, and she to- tally turned it on. It was amaz- ing. In the photos, she is stand- ing in this see-through bodysuit. I had the makeup person cut some small holes in the suit, and Michelle just started arching her back and ripping it off, moan- ing. Incredibly hot and very sexy. I'd love to work with Michelle again. Julie Strain is a riot ond a good friend. The first time I met her, I walked into her house in Beverly Hills, and she's standing there in the living room totally naked, and her mom's there. I thought my eyes were going to fall out of my head. She's just so tall and spectacular. I don't think I took very good photos that day. Julie and I are going to be in a movie called PURGA- TORY BLUES for Zack Snygg. In fhe scene we are doing, Julie is going to sew my eyes and mouth shut. That should be fun. Perhops more than all of fhem, I've shot Brinke the most. I feel bod because I've poured so much blood on her. Brinke has the sexiest voice on the plonet. She's o pal ond I'd do anything for her. She's so good at what she does and works so hard. I adore her. Anybody ever actuatly walk out? Anybody walk in hesifanf but become a big exh/bif/on/st The Porcelain Twins once fhe camera started effek/ng away? People who come to my studio seem to have a lot of fun. It's very relaxed here, and there seems to be a good vibe. It's also edgy and a little dangerous. I think that's impor- tant, becouse fear ond pain are beautiful, powerful emo- tions. I never really know what's going to happen, and more often than not, I'm mak- ing if up as I go along. Always flying by the seat of my pants. Yeah, people have to get warmed up. The models usual- ly let go when they see what’s going on of Ward's studio is re- al and legit, and different. Everyone's on exhibitionist. Most people leove the studio o friend and we keep in touch. I would never ask anyone to do something they were un- comfortable with. Some of the creepiest things I've ever shot were the model's idea. Who IS your favorite model to work with? I don't have a favorite. I like everyone I photograph, or i wouldn't shoot them. It's impos- sible to take good pictures of someone I don't like. Over the yeors I've worked with some great models. In L.A., I've had the opportunity to shoot so many amazing people— lisa Strix, Smutty Smith, Vylette, Kembra Pfohler, Dukey Flyswat- ter, The Cowboy, Richard Lynch, Screaming Mad George, Sabrina Belladonna, Texas Terri, Gen, Christiana Ul- traVixen, Brigit Brat, Tom Roin- one — and so many more. It re- ally is a thrill. Sometimes I look ot my book and my head spins. So mony realized dreams... I want to shoot people who haven't been shot to death by other photographers. I'm al- ways looking for new people. 1 wont to discover and find peo- ple who want to take a chance. Do something differ- ent. Shake things up. In L.A., I'm olways looking for someone new and different. That's what's great about L.A. You con be, and do, anything you want to here. L.A. rules.

The only difficulty these days is hoping she'il find time in her rapidly growing schedule of film work to give you at least an hour. Thankfully, I got it. I had been infroduced to the young actress while working with her on David DeCofeau's supernatural tM/er THE FRIGHT- ENING, ffien again on Danny Draven's gore epic HELL ASY- LUM. In watching her interactions among cast and crew. Tanya was definitely well liked. Easygoing and dedicated to her work and co-stars, she would at one moment be intensly battling black cloaked spectres...the next, comforting a fel- low casfmale having re/afionsh/p traub/es. Okoy, so why does appearing in two horror shockers make Tanya Dempsey, (the eldest daughter of seven children who was born in San Diego and went on to live in Utah and Arizona before her current home in Los Angeles), worthy of a cover story for Femme Fatales? Well, aside from the fact each of those aims turned impressive and extremely healthy profits when they debuted in Spring 2002. they are only two of the seven features she has headlined within the post twelve months (and that's excluding her television work on the teeny-bopper sitcoms USA HIGH and CLUESS, a bit as a nurse in PEARL HARBOR, the indies CONVERSATION PIECE and CAT BURGLAR, plus SHRIEKER, which receives regular exposure on the SCI FI Channel;. From all accounts. Tanya Dempsey may just be the new \"If girl of the B-movie industry. We're gonna snap her up while we still can.... So was SHRIEKER your first film? Yeah, it was. 1 had done some smaller, student film type proj- ects, but SHRIEKER (1997) was my first feature film, which I did with David DeCoteau (THE BROTHERHOOD). It wos a lot of fun. How did you get the role? I auditioned. It was crazy, actually, becouse I wosn't reolly aware of how the whole process worked. I was called bock a second.time and there were only guys at the audition besides me, soj'm doing all these scenes with different guys, the whole time thinking, 'Gosh, I really hope I get this role.' I Was so naive. ..(laughs) Then it got really crazy, because they officially told me on Friday I had the role, gave me the script to read over the weekend, and we storted filming on Monday. I had the lead role and had probably about ninety pages of dialogue to learn. Now, of course, I realize that's how a lot of these films work,* but at the time l was just crazed, thinking, 'How am I going to do this?' It was a really great learning experience, though, I got olong really well with the cast and David DeCoteau was a really wonderful director. The funny thing is. I look back now and realize how mellow of a horror film it is com-' pored to some of the stuff I've done more recently (laughs). Hove you ever been recognized from SHRIEKER? Actually.

I just looked at him. caught competely ott guard. I was so taken aback. Now, it's cool though when people recognize me. When did you know you wanted to be an actress? I always did-.l was always a performer, it was my dad's fault, octually, because I was the first daughter and he was always encouraging me to go out and do everything. If 1 had a little song or dance to show him, he was always my biggest fan. it wasn't until high school, though, when i really considered It. I was unbearably shy in school, and my Sophomore year I fried to get into a dance class but was too late to sign up. So my counselor suggested I take an acting class, and I just kept say- ing. 'Oh no...l could never do that... I couldn't get up in front of all those people.' So he said. 'Why don't you just try it and if you don't like it we'll get you out of It.' So I tried it, and 1 was stuck. From then on, I was president of the droma club and was in oil the plays. I just loved it...l became a total drama geek. Did you pursue drama in college? A bit. I did some community theater in Arizona right after school, but I'd already mode up my mind I wos going to Los Angeles to reoliy make a go of it. So, on New Years Eve 1 996, I was packing my bags while everyone else was partying, and I made the move, by myself with only $200 to my name, on January 1 . 1 just knew I needed to be out here. How long were you in LA. before you got the role in SHRIEKER? I got the role that Fall. I had gone on several auditions before then, but it was crazy that I actually got the lead role in my first film. How does your famiiy react to seeing you in movies? It's kinda funny, because I'll call and tell them I got a role, and they'll congratulate me, but it isn't until they actually see it on television when they get really excited. I guess it doesn't seem real to them until they see it. They're always really sup- portive of me. Are you a horror fan? Honestly, they score me. When I was younger I liked them and would try to sneak out into the living room at night to watch them, then I'd have nightmares afterwords. Now, I've really become a big chicken. is if easier to watch them now that you make them? It has helped a little, but making HELL ASYLUM honestly affected me. ...You know how when you're watching o scary movie you know what you're seeing isn't real, yet there's still something about it that's just so creepy? That's how I felt on that set. It all seemed so real and scary to me. I think I may have gotten too much into the character. I was running around screaming and crying for a lot of It, and my death scene was really, really gory. When I'd go home at night I'd hove nightmares.. .[I'd] wake up repeatedly throughout the night.... What freaked you out so much? I think it was a combination of everything. ..the script, the gore, the place we were shooting in, which wasn't dressed up for the movie...it reaily did iook like that, i think my death scene had a iot to do with it. i've never hod to experience something that gory before. There was oiso o scene down in the basement where Stacy (THE BROTHERHOOD il's Stocey Scowiey) end i are waiking around ond supposed to feei a presence behind us.. .well. I didn't realize there was actually going to be (a spectre] behind us, so it really did startle me. There was just this continuous, genuine scariness around the set which Td never expected. Perhaps that's why the film turned out so good. \"So this girl runs around with her breasts hanging out ...it's just exploit- ation, and boring. \" How wos the cast? Had you worked with any of them before? The only actor I really knew was Brinke Stevens from WITC- HOUSE 3, so everybody else was new to me, but they were all really great. The thing is, I've met some of my best friends on movie sets, but there hove been other sets where I don't get along with the girls at all, or have any bonding with them, which makes such o difference. Even if you're only working together for week, how you get along with your castmates makes all the difference in the world. You need to bond with your fellow actors, and I really did with everyone on HELL ASY- LUM, They were an absolutely wonderful group of people. Tell us about your charocter, \"Amber\"... She's definitely not a modest girl, as you can fell by her out- fits (or lack of them) (laughs). She's a little flirt. One of hermoin concerns in the beginning Is there aren't ony boys oround. She starts off kind of hard ond thinks she's tough, but as things start to get out of control, you discover she really has a soft heart. How did you feel having to portray such a sexy character? I enjoyed doing it, though some of the script had to be changed, because originally she was supposed to be running oround topless. I think when Danny and J.R. handed me the script, they already knew I wasn't going to do fhot, so Danny pointed out before I ever read the script it would be changed [chuckles). I have no problem with the sexiness. I'm definitely not oshomed of my own body. It just made me laugh because I could picture them sitting there while it was being written, trying to figure out how many ways they could get me to toke off more clothes. Would you ever do nudity in a film? It sounds so cliched saying, 'Well, if it wos o reolly good story and it was right for the project...,' but it really is true. I’m not against nudity. I just think it's a very sacred thing, and Td have to believe in the project a whole lot to do it. Okay, so this girl runs around with her breasts hanging out for the half the movie.. .what's so special about seeing them? It means nothing. At that point it's just exploitation and boring. There was something e/se which you wouldn’t do. which found you doused with real living bugs.... They couldn't pay me enough. I knew what they ended up using on me wasn’t reol. but that was creepy enough! That stuff felt really gross, and it was just rice, rabbit food. ..things like that, ond it was stuck in my hair. Pius, the real maggots they'd originally intended to use. which they wound up using for the closeups, were sitting just off to the side, so when it all got dumped on me, my mind told me it was the real thing. So, now that Tm thinking about it, I guess there was a part of the filming I really didn't like... .(smiles and shakes her head). They still tried talking me into putting the real maggots in my bonds for close ups, and. ..nope. ..couldn't pay me enough. Let's move bockwards to WITCHOUSE 3: DEMON FIRE. Was that the first time you had met J.R. Bookwalter and his crew? J.R. was the editor on SHRIEKER, so he knew me, but I did- n't really know him. When he was propping WITCHOUSE 3 he called my manager who came to the set of a film I was in the process of shooting called FLASHI (a.k.a. MOUNTAIN HIGH). It turned into a crazy time because 1 agreed to do WITCHOUSE 3, which started filming before FLASH! wrapped. So i was shooting two movies at the some time and getting about three hours of sleep every night. It was worth if though. I was just glad to be working, and I loved playing \"Annie\" in WITC- HOUSE 3. Absolutely loved her... How was fhe shoot itself? It was all very professional. I didn't really get to bond with the cast too much becouse I was doing the other film at the same time, so all of my energy was going into making each of those characters the best I could, and running between sets in the meantime. So it was o strenuous shoot, but looking back at it, 1 was reolly happy with how the film turned out and really did love playing \"Annie.\" What did you Hke so much about her? I think there's a certain omount of evil in oil of us. \\ye're so lucky, os actors, because we get to explore all of that. I just love that you never really know what exactly it is she's up to. Whot did you think of the finished fiim? I liked it because it didn't rely on gore or special effects. If was very character and story driven. It has some very dramatic moments. It's actually more of a mystery than a horror film. It's a sort-of 'who-dunnit.' I'd much rother watch a movie which chal- lenges me end makes me think and get into the plot, rather than one which hopes the gore will keep the viewer occupied. How was J.R. as a director? Oh... I love J.R. He's very open to what an actor needs and any suggestions you may have. Even though it was a tough shoot, he was always very kind. Wfiof is FLASH!? It wos produced by Starlight Films West and directed by Annabel Schofield, who used to be a model. ..very beautiful. She was in that famous Bugle Boy jeans commercial where she drives up along side the guy and says, 'Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?' She wrote and directed FLASH!, which is based on her experiences with the modeling world. My character (\"Nina\") is a naive girl from the Midwest who enters the modeling world and is just taken aback by all these crazy models and other people who've already been around the block and do a lot of drugs. During the course of the story, though, she meets end falls in love with one of her photogra- phers. It was a huge project for me to do. What made it so carzy is I would spend hours in glamourous model makeup and dresses ond do photo shoots, then race to the set of WITCHOUSE 3 and have horror makeup and blood all over me. Is fhe character you portray supposed to be Annabel Schofield? No. None of the characters are octually based on her, but she said each of the characters was based on girls she knew from her modeling doys. I was actually a redhead when I got the role, but they asked me to go blonde. Once I did it, I liked it, so I decided to keep it for a while. I've been every hair color imaginable, but blonde seems to be working for me. You know what's really funny? In every movie I've done as a brunette or with a dork hair color, my characters ore smort and end up soving the day. However, as a blonde I'm suddenly dying, or not as intelligent. I guess being blonde mokes you helpless... Well, you did THE FRIGHTENING as a blonde.... ...And I diel Seel (laughs) Wfiof was your character, coincidentally named \"Tanya,\" like? She was a punky. gothic chic with a bad attitude. She looks a lot like Cyndi Lauper (\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\"). She was a lot of fun too. I like to play roles which are so far out and away from who I really am. Maybe 1 am these people deep down inside and I don't get to express them, but in movies I do. 'Tanya' was fun because it wos like playing dress up. Plus, it was a little reunion, because 1 got to work with David DeCoteau again. Was THE FRIGHTENING the first time you got to die on screen? No. I actually died for the first time in another movie 1 did called DEAD 7. At least I think it's called DEAD 7. It was when we filmed it, but I read somewhere on the internet the title had chonged (to HIDE AND GO SHRIEK, though in most listings the movie retains its original title). Thot's one of the crazy things about fhe business. Titles change all fhe time, and the actors are typically the last people to know! (Additionally, THE FRIGHTENING was lensed as KISS OF THE DAMNED, just as FLASH! was called MOUNTAIN HIGH and HELL ASYLUM was originolly PRISON OF THE DEAD 2!) It's like. 'Domnit! I just had my resumes reprinted!' (laughs) DEAD 7 was a low-budget horror film where i got my throat slit...ls it bad for me to say I reolly hated that film? (chuckles nervously). It was just a typical slasher film, with all these kids out in the woods. 1 don't really want to talk bad about my really low-budget stuff, though. I'm sure most of them will never come out, or if they do, won't see much of a releose. I just really wanted the experience. I look ot those projects (most of which titles she won't reveal) as my classes.. .my school work. They're how I studied my croft. I learned a lot from them, so when 1 went on to do movies like FLASH!, WITC- HOUSE 3, THE FRIGHTENING and others, I already had enough experience to be able to be more professionol. I'm sure all fhe no-budget movies 1 did will come back to haunt me some- day. -they always do. (laughs) I really don't regret anything I've done. I believe you hove to just freefall. Jump right into it. That's become my analogy of life. Whof about THE COVEN? There's a wild story behind that one. It was originally-going to be WITCHOUSE 31 It had been made as THE COVEN, then Full Moon wos going to buy it, change the title ond release it, but they changed their minds ond made an all-new WITC- HOUSE 3 instead, which I just happend to be in. It's a crazy coincidence. THE COVEN is basciaily o rip-off of THE CRAFT, but I had a lot of fun making it. It's extremely low-budget, but I just heard Brain Damage picked it up for distribution. There's actuolly a funny story about the connection between THE COVEN and WITCHOUSE 3. When Full Moon was still planing to distribute THE COVEN, they called in Brittany James for a photo shoot. She was my rival in the film and did such a tontos- Hc job. She realty earned the movie. So she does the shoot, then Full Moon'decides to moke their own WITCHOUSE 3, which, of, cou5e, I was photographed for. Well, when the artwork for J.R. Bookwolteris version came out, they had put my head on her bodyl She jokes with me about it, soying together we moke a pretty good-looking woman! I guess you're never safe with Photoshop.... With all the horror films you've made the past few years, chances are you'll be labeled a \"SCREAM QUEEN.\" Do you have any qualms about the title? I don't want any kind of label. I'm flottered people are seeing ond recognizing enough of my work that they're associating me with a certain genre, but I'd really like to start doing some movies about people-..not monsters, (chuckles] Don't get me wrong.
