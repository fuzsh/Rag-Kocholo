        "text": "A series that examines the exploration of spaces and our relationship to them. The concept of transforming empty space, this blueprint of nothing, or a shell of memories long gone, into somewhere sacred, etched with new memories and feelings.\n\nIn post-production.\n\nFinding themselves in a remote part of the Tasmanian wilderness, Misha and Myaree are engineers tasked with locating suitable locations for an array of wind turbines. As they move deeper into the wilderness, their descent is marked with strange, troubling disturbances which cut their expedition short, is it in their heads or something much more ominous laying ahead?\n\nRomina has landed a role in a play based on Gustv Klimtâ€™s painting of Judith. Her conservative Father does not approve and struggles with violent visions, apparently knowing her secret. This might cost Romina a heavy price.\n\nCurrently in the festival curcuit.\n\nWith less than a month to produce a portrait piece for the renowned Stahlker exhibition, Goce (Izaak Love) is an artist at odds with his motivation, suffering from a debilitating artistic block. Determined to help him meet the deadline, sister Leida(Sophie Stewart) commandeers his efforts, until a freak occurrence happens. Leida suffers a sudden onset of Total Locked in Syndrome, rendering her incapacitated yet alive and conscious on the inside. Determined to break his artistic block and honour a promise to his sister, together they hit the road for the ocean. The trip challenges their every being, both physically and emotionally.\n\nIn post-production.\n\nA phone call from a daughter catapults a Mother into action, as more questions are raised than answers. Time is ticking, and a reliance on technology to connect us starts to fray, leading to catastrophic consequences.\n\nA young, colourful, highly intelligent girl with an archaic mind has been raised by overzealous helicopter parents who do everything in their power to keep her busy, hidden away, and safe. She wants her freedom, but she is systematically ingrained by the rules they have created. She can only find ways to combat her repressive parents through her own rebellious thoughts.\n\nUpon witnessing something sinister, a dark reality comes crashing through the protective layers her family has devised for her. She is challenged to fend for herself. The tightly wound rules must be challenged and the conventions by which she abides are shaken once and for all. A new echelon of liberty is uncovered."
