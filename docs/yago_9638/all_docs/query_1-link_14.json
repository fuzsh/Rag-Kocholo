        "text": "Awfully mean-spirited and often sickeningly gory, I would normally never recommend the likes of \"Inbred\". But the technical virtues of filmmaking on display here, coupled with a roster of well-played incredible characters, go far in redeeming the film.\n\nFull Review | Jan 14, 2020\n\nA grotesque pastiche of every horror classic you can think of, which ultimately fails through its lack of anything even remotely resembling wit or style.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Feb 5, 2019\n\nFor a feature debut, co-writer/director Alex Chandon seems to be trying to accomplish too much... As seen here, the result is a confused and bloody mess.\n\nFull Review | Oct 22, 2018\n\nPatience-sappingly foul British horror film in which a brood of ravening yokels torment inner-city teens on a weekend retreat.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Sep 20, 2012\n\nDirector Alex Chandon clearly has no truck with the PC-brigade with this gorily offensive horror that revels in a mean streak as wide as the Humber yet is lifted by a sense of humour as keen as a Sheffield blade.\n\nFull Review | Sep 20, 2012\n\nDaft, disturbing and defective but thankfully, it doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Sep 19, 2012\n\nThe row behind me had the night of their lives. They roared with laughter. They clapped. They shouted \"get in!\", as characters were brutalised. This, however, was the row reserved for the cast and their friends.\n\nFull Review | Mar 21, 2012\n\nIt is, alas, stuck down the very same 'dirty hole' of the British horror market where the likes of Lesbian Vampire Killers and Evil Aliens reside, desperate to pump their captive audience full of all the shit it can take and more.\n\nFull Review | Feb 22, 2012"
