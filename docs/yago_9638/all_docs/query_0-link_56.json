Legendary author Shaun Hutson has temporarily taken over the reins of Haunted: After Dark, composing the editorial (and more) and giving the magazine a clear direction on what dark and horrific path to follow for this issue. This is “Anthology”, over 100 pages of horror at its finest, at its scariest and at its shockiest. This issue is dedicated to all the unsung horror heroes out there, dare to dream, dare to scream and your nightmares could become a reality."
