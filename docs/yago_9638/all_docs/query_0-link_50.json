        "text": "REVIEWS\n\nwww.horror-movies.ca says BEST HORROR FILM OF 2012\n\nI think anyone who enjoys a good hillbilly movie, with a healthy dose of black humour, a touch of bizzarity and some great gore should put this at the top of their to-watch list, because they will love it too. Not one person I’ve shown this to so far has been disappointed.\n\nlucyindaskywithdiamonds.com\n\nI can only hope that this film now finally finds its audience... as it is a genuine cult classic in the making while also being one of the most original and inventive British horror films since “The Kill List”.\n\nwww.best-horror-movies.com\n\nWhat is offered is just pure, unbridled, fun, sadistic horror.\n\nmindreels.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/toronto-after-dark-inbred-alex-chandon/\n\nThis is a film that will thrive on the festival circuit, in venues like Toronto After Dark, because it delivers on everything it promises, and the crowd ate it up, clapping and cheering each step of the way, not entirely dissimilar to the townsfolk watching The Show, I’m not sure if that’s a commentary on the viewer or not…\n\ngeekshallinheritearth.blogspot.co.uk\n\nHighly recommended for those with both a strong stomach and a wickedly dark sense of humour. A cult classic already. 9 out of 10.\n\nwww.videoviews.org 5/5 Our First PERFECT review!\n\nProduction wise the film looks amazingly beautiful and the effects are spot on. INBRED isn't a film to talk about, it's one to watch over and over again. With all the lame horror films coming out of Hollywood anymore it was a real treat watching a horror film that delivers on every level.\n\nboxofficebuz.com BluRay Review 4/5\n\nI hate goretastic horror but for some reason I love INBRED, it could be that the locals are just so damn brilliant or Jo Hartley is just wonderful as down to earth Kate. Not sure what it is but INBRED has style. It sets out to accomplish something and it does!\n\nwww.horrortalk.com BluRay Review. 4/5\n\nINBRED is the bastard son of The League of Gentlemen and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, with an approach to gross-out gore that Peter Jackson showed in Bad Taste and Brain Dead. It’s completely aware of what it is and doesn’t try to be anything that it’s not. And there’s nothing at all wrong with that.\n\nreluctantgeek.blog.com/movies/inbred-review/\n\nINBRED is a darkly funny, wonderfully disgusting vile piece of cinema that you just can’t peel your eyes away from.\n\nSTARBURST approves!\n\nINBRED is absolutely hardcore horror - this is pitch-black stuff and its humour is as dark as night - and as such it does what it sets out to do and is a triumph of its type.\n\nwww.gorepress.com/2012/09/19/inbred/\n\nGloriously sick and utterly hilarious, INBRED is an incredibly violent laugh-riot that will split audiences wide open. You might loathe it or you might adore it, but whatever the case I absolutely loved it. 7.5/10\n\nThe Yorkshire Post likes INBRED!\n\nThis one has to be seen to be believed. Shot on location in Thirsk, it proves that classic British horror is alive and twitching.\n\nwww.screen-one.net/2012/09/review-inbred.html\n\nGory, gruesome and gleeful, INBRED will make anybody think twice before pulling over at that lovely-looking country pub for a spot of hot food. 4/5\n\nwww.radiotimes.com/film/sc52m/inbred\n\n...a twisted, Grand Guignol-style splatterfest that mixes hardcore, townie-in-peril horror with pitch-black humour.\n\nhttp://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/reviews/inbred.html\n\nINBRED is riotously funny, insanely gory, jaw-droppingly horrific, arm-grippingly exciting and so intrinsically British it should have a Union Jack sticking out of its arse.\n\nAin't It Cool votes INBRED in it's TOP 13 horror films of the year!\n\nThis is an absolutely fantastic tour de force in gore that’s touring the circuit now and will most likely be released later in the year.\n\nHonorable Mention by the Melies Jury at Lund's Fantastic Film Festival\n\nAlex Chandon and his INBRED is the most violent movie we’ve seen, still it’s one of the most hilarious and unrealistic stupid comedies we’ve seen coming out of Britain in years.\n\nhttp://lovehorror.co.uk/inbred-2011-review\n\nINBRED is very British with tons of gore some great laughs but enough true frights and nasty moments to make it well worth a watch even for those unfamiliar with the English eccentricities it excellently and excruciatingly parodies.\n\nhttp://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2011/11/inbred-2011.html\n\nOh boy. INBRED is clearly one of the best, funniest and goriest black comedies I've seen it a very long time. No, I won't compare it with SHAUN OF THE DEAD or TUCKER & DALE, because INBRED are in it's own brilliant league. It's darker, gorier and has a Monty Python-esque Grand Guignol atmosphere.\n\nhttp://wildsidecinema.com/2011/11/alex-chandon-inbred-2011-horror-hillbillies-redneck-sex/\n\nINBRED falls firmly in the category of “Stupid and ignorant city dwellers fall foul of country folk” but instantly rises to the top levels of it because of the way it plays out. There is playing cat and mouse, there are traps and there are hicks laughing at dying Londoners, but thanks to the talent and energy both behind and in front of the camera we never really get the chance to realize that we’ve seen all of this in ten other movies, we just enjoy the ride. And you should too. Look for it in the future.\n\nhttp://cinezilla.blogspot.com/2011/11/inbred.html?zx=27f15098a0b9a527\n\nIn many ways the movie blows stuff like THE COTTAGE, SEVERANCE and DOGHOUSE right off the map.\n\nwww.thedarksidemagazine.com/index.php/2011/09/fright-stuff-2/\n\nHardcore horror buffs that cherish films like Peter Jackson’s BRAINDEAD and BAD TASTE will appreciate the ‘take-no-prisoners’ approach that Alex and his co-writer Paul Shrimpton employ. Characters get offed in the nastiest fashion possible, often in a madcap cabaret of carnage presided over by a black-faced Papa Lazaru substitute, and the movie seems pig-headedly mean towards the Southern softies, who really don’t stand a chance against the bloodthirsty backwoods barnpots.\n\nhorroraddicts.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/inbred/\n\nA fantastic experience of violence and pitch black humour, INBRED is distinctly British and distinctly Alex Chandon. It has been ten years since Chandon directed CRADLE OF FEAR, and the nightmarish quality of that 2001 cult favourite has been retained in Inbred and fortified with a more consistent cast and superior production values.\n\nwww.aintitcool.com/node/51137\n\nINBRED is as perverse and tasteless as a film can be. Anywhere else those would be harsh words against a film, but not here at AICN HORROR. Here I have to give it up to this twisted little gem for not being shy at doling out the gory stuff and being unafraid to go to dark corners that would make most feel utterly uncomfortable. Horror fans have had their fair share of inbred families terrorizing a group of innocents. To stand out, you've got to be something pretty special. In all of its twisted glory, INBRED stands loud and proud as the modern king of sick killer mutant family movies.\n\nIn the gory tradition of EVIL DEAD II and RE-ANIMATOR, two films that strike a horrific chord while sloshing around in their own bloody slop, INBRED is a worthy addition to this twisted little family. I highly recommend this film for those who love gore by the truckload.\n\ntransgressivecinema.com/2011/09/12/frightfest-2011/\n\nAll hail Alex Chandon for coming to the rescue with the World Premier of Inbred. Seemingly with a bigger budget than his previous films and with a great cast, Inbred follows the story of a group of teens and their youth workers who end up staying in an isolated village in rural Yorkshire. Sadly (for them) the locals are all sadistic cannibals! Served up with Alex Chandon’s trademark blend of dark humour and explicit gore, Inbred entertained from the start and refused to compromise to the very end. Distinctly British, and distinctly Alex Chandon, Inbred is the kind of film that beats at the black heart of FrightFest and it was a distinct pleasure to see it on the giant Empire screen with over a thousand cheering horror fans.\n\nwww.dreadcentral.com/reviews/inbred-2011\n\nOn that side of things, it delivers. Big time. Once the killing starts, you’re never too far away from the next twisted death scene as the citizens of Mortlake get together for their favourite type of Cabaret show, complete with protective goggles and designated splash zone, featuring the murder of outsiders as their favourite main attraction. Inbred is gory as hell, and once the remaining teens start fighting back it becomes a literal bloodbath of severed limbs, blown off heads, crushed bodies and all kinds of splashy goodness. Presented with a fitting mix of CG and prosthetic work, the gore effects are well realised if goofy and obvious at times.\n\nnew.videoplugger.info/2011/09/03/london-film4-frightfest-2011-pt-3/\n\nINBRED is probably the most gory, splatter, gruesome and extremely violent movie I have seen in the last years. And what makes it even more so is the fact that everything happens in camera. Every head, arm, leg that is chopped off is right there, every shot in the face or in any part of the body is right there. The visually disturbing images are balanced by the black and nasty humor that permeates the movie from the beginning to the end.\n\nHumor at its darkest and gore at its bloodiest.\n\ncinemaroll.com/cinemarolling/frightfest-inbred-2011/\n\nThe penultimate movie at this years Frightfest, took many by surprise, and in a really good way.\n\nInbred is a really screwed up, but enjoyable movie. It’s very tongue in cheek feature that perfectly balances the mix of horror and humour, appealing to the largest possible audience it could. Making much use of the \"local\" aspect of the movie, Inbred plays on popular conceptions and heightens them with a heady mix of over the top residents. It’s the attention to detail on the movies villains that should get the best praise, using a lot of cliché which includes a man with a ferret, a northern singing minstrel, and a snappy punch at education up north, Chandon has created a perfectly formed stereotypical look at small town northern life.\n\nThe movies performers especially Seamus O’Neill, Jo Hartley and James Doherty are the icing on an almost perfect piece.\n\nIf I was asked to make a comparison to Inbred it would have to be Mum & Dad meets Bad Taste, and with such movies held in such high regard, the only thing left for me to say is stop reading, get out there and see this film, the day it’s released.\n\nwww.theraygun.co.uk/?p=2935\n\nThen the penultimate film Inbred found director Alex Chandon returning to FrightFest for the first time since 2001. This horrific and surreal tale finds a group of teenagers and their two teachers getting into trouble when they run foul of the deranged locals after they set off into the countryside, it’s a unique spin on a well known genre.\n\nwww.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/film/film4-frightfest-2011-monday-report#.Tl49UF1_eSo\n\nThe world premiere of Alex Chandon's Inbred followed, and it seemed like every one of the mutant yokels were behind DIY in the Empire. It made for one of the best experiences of the weekend, with their excited commentary and continual cheering in my ear. Probably the most competent and accessible work in Chandon's filmography (Cradle of Fear, Pervirella), Inbred is an OTT riff on The League of Gentlemen that aims to be as disgusting as possible. It's hilariously bad taste and genuinely funny, with Jo Hartley an unconventionally honest horror heroine. She and James Doherty are care workers taking four young offenders for a weekend's teambuilding in the country, only to have a run-in with the \"inbred\" locals of the title. Seamus O'Neill is a riot as the landlord, with the pub scene a predictably vomit-inducing affair. Too ridiculous to be offensive, the gore is frequent and heavy, with some disgustingly imaginative deaths - you won't look at asparagus the same way again. Very silly, very bloodthirsty, I chose it to be my final film of FrightFest so I could go out on a high."
