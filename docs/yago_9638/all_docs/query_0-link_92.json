        "text": "Глава 2\n\nIn the name of Satan's portion...\n\nPact Two - A Cat Amongst A Haunt Of Wolves\n\nGreetings from my deathbed.\n\nNormally I would appreciate the rampant ovation that accompanies such a statement, but my head is feeling like one of those Japanese paper lanterns today and about as stable as the fission reactor at Chernobyl was seconds prior to meltdown. In short, I am obviously terminally ill, so please honor a dying man's wish by bearing with me, because the paragraphs that lie ahead are rocky and fraught with danger and according to my Penguin Book Of Serious Ailments, I am suffering from excessive evacuation of verbal faeces - only I'm not just talking shit, but I'm passing it unbottled as well.\n\nThis month's classic adventure in Chunderland comes courtesy of that which is usually strictly anathema to the hallowed pages of Metal Hammer - the Kerrang! Music Awards. Taboo-pooper that I am (and because Music For Nations had kindly gotten the Right Reverend Nicholas Bastard and myself invitations for the evening), I decided that it would be an ideal opportunity for me to do a bit of investigative journalism, get exceedingly drunk and annoy as many of my potential peers as possible.\n\nWell, two out of three would still make for an interesting evening...I've never been much of a journo, so I borrowed a few introductory cards from flame-haired reviews guru Dan Silver, adding the word 'Filth' to his name in biro for further effect. Dan 'Silver' Filth. Sounded good - very metal, and dead suave to boot. I broke my Dictaphone out of perpetual retirement (i.e. I put some batteries in it) and like a gangly-legged spider, scurried out with the intention of ensnaring anyone of notoriety that came writhing my curious grasp. And would you Adam and Eve it, it bloody well worked.\n\nDespite the same crappy question, \"Can I ask what you thought of the Kerrang! Awards tonight?\", I had brief but eloquent conversations with a plethora of exotic stars, most of whom were unaware of my true identity as Chaos Lord Thule, Progenitor and Archdeacon Of Fear to Hell and all it's tireless minions.\n\nAmong those worth hollering about were Page 3 dream queen Jo Guest (her \"it was really nice\" hardly reeks of verbosity, but as someone witty once said, \"Who wants to shag Bamber Gascoigne?), Joe Elliott (complete with new frightwig), Julia Valet (I could've been cruel and asked her about music), Lemmy, LG Petrov (who was nursing a hangover at the beginning of the evening), Jonathan Davis, Bruce Dickenson, etc.\n\nFormer Big Breakfast host Zoe Ball was obviously having herself a good time, judging by the comment she made that she was feeling \"loose\" - something, admittedly, she did correct rather quickly, bless her heart... though you should've been witness to the expectant rapture that came across our drummer's suddenly cherubic face for a few magical moments.\n\nI won't bore you frigid with the awards results themselves, but the usual slew of artistes gathered their trophies: Jon Bum Gravy, Marilyn Manson, The Prodigy, et al. Although some of the bigger names didn't pick them up in person, they did interrupt their holidays to grace us with a little speech on the video wall (and that's possibly why there were very few spare invites floating around for the likes of me).\n\nFair enough, I am being sarcastic, although by no means am I attempting an underhanded slur on Kerrang! or the awards ceremony at all... For the most part, it was an extremely prestigious event; the atmosphere was eclectic, the food, and especially the drink, was abundant, and most importantly, everybody appeared to be having an enjoyable time, which is the main reason that we're in this fair game, industry, press and bands alike (although, you might argue, cash 'n' all.)\n\nI would conjecture that all's well that ended well, but it seems somewhat ironic that if I hadn't been mixing my drinks like henbane and rue for a good 11 hours that night, I might very well have felt human today. So, before I depart to view whatever fresh cruelties nature has inflicted upon my insides (via my mouth, of course), I will finale with two further items of interest.\n\nFirstly; early morning-ish, Columbia Hotel, Hyde Park, Henry from pist.on (our table companions for the show) slaps Ricky Warwick for telling him to keep his noise down at so late an hour... (well, I thought it was funny). And secondly...\n\nDoes anybody remember the altercation 'twixt Cradle Of Filth and the band formally known as Manhole? There's no point in resurrecting it now, but let's just say Nasty Spice Tairrie B was one of my targets for questioning. And instead of the rottweiler-on-Red-Bull attitude trip I had come to expect, I found her to be sweet and charming. Thereupon, we sorted out all differences and kissed and made up (sorry, Mr. Bell, the man to my perpetual left, just a slip of the tongue).\n\nAnyway, all is now well, so I guess it's time to refrain from being so frightfully nice and start making a few new enemies... (Apart from my liver - at this precise moment, I really need to improve my relationship with that part of my body).\n\nUntil next time we sail upon the blighted hulk ship 'Psychobabble',\n\nYour fiend,\n\nDani\n\nГлава 8\n\nMy God, the ants! They're enormous! it's...\n\nPact Eight - Coming Clean With The Filth\n\nThe night is cold, dark and mercenary, the moon hangs in the clouded sky like a rotted wedge of cheese. The wind throws the gnarled, twisted branches of trees into a frenzy, their skeletal fingers claw against your windows like a necrophile buried alive, scratching at the lid of his rigid lover's coffin. You stoke the open fire from ember, sending a blaze of glowing sprites scurrying up the narrow chimney and into the dark beyond, their swiftly snuffed trails of indication to whatever horrors are abroad that tonight, on this Eve of Dead Souls, you're home alone. Soon, you fear, those unseen terrors that prowl the perimeters of your foulest dreams will know your flesh - from the inside out.\n\nDesperately trying to keep your imagination from straying off its leash, you attempt a whisper of interest in the current issue of Metal Hammer, thumbing through its crinkled pages (the result of a date in the lav with dominatrix Val Ium) in the vain hope that another interview with Dave Mustaine might deliver you swiftly to the oblivion of sleep. But alas, even mister mundane seems to quicken your pulse tonight - so much so, you toss his semblance on the floor (please...this is meant to be dramatic), silently cursing the Elizabeth Taylor rehab center as the cause of his once-great band's decline.\n\nStrange then, that whilst your eyes glance over the words of Dani's Inferno that read like hieroglyphs drawn by a spastic Pharaoh, the all too familiar stench of shit should assail the remainder of you senses, before...TOO LATE! you realize that, in your terror at Metal Hammer's favorite guest column (by default only; unfortunately I don't possess a pair of breasts), you have inadvertently crapped yourself.\n\nNow, as if in mocking response, the elements renew their fearful clangour, the sickly moon begins howling in her axis whilst arcane symbols scrawled in blood appear on walls and windows... and as the final candle winks out and plunges you into jet black darkness, your last trace of sanity screams out, over and over again like the thin red repeats of a butcher's knife, the guttural words, 'column fucking eight and it's still a bunch of old arrrrrsse...'\n\nI must apologize for the length of introduction but I do like a big entrance (and more often or not, the tradesman's), so now I'd better finish this as painlessly as possible if I'm to catch last orders. Right, here you go you merciless bastards...\n\nSince the event has long since troubled anything other than my damaged pride, my esteemed counsel (the Rev. Rudus Priest) has convinced me with his almost fanatical faith in the Lord to confess to the facts (and not the flimsy cover up) concerning last year's Venom launch party in London. Those of you without brains caved in by glue and ganja may recall the story surrounding the car crash suffered by Nicholas Bastard and myself, on our return by car down a dark country lane.\n\nIt is true that the police escorted us to Colchester hospital, where Nick was treated for a cracked egg (sorry, I meant head), and I was prodded for concussion. However, the facts beg quite a different explanation concerning the cause of our injuries.\n\nGrimewatch now reports...\n\nThat evening we arrived at the Venom club in Soho with the band's American drum tech and my girlfriend Toni. As any denizen of the countryside will tell you, if someone invites you to the Big Smoke for a night of free booze and metal - the action is go! And you invariably end up both rowdy and pissed, which of course (only five weeks prior we were tied like a gimp to album rehearsals) we undertook with near fatal expertise. Cue Nicholas Bastard, now on his 12the tequila slammer and slightly uncoordinated, bringing the glass down violently on his hand - whereupon it smashed and slits open three of his fingers, spilling blood everywhere (highlight of the party if you ask me).\n\nA bouncer then takes him next door to a convenience store with the intention of getting his hand bandaged before calling an ambulance. However, Americans being the lovable loudmouths they are (even more so after supping three pints of vodka), our drum tech lurches after them and accuses the six-foot something bouncer of throwing Nicholas out with a non-optional beating.\n\nLuckily, after salvaging our relationship from the brink of near divorce (having publicly argued about how drunk one another were), my girlfriend and I stumble out and manage to salvage the situation before it goes red, promising to get Nick to a hospital just as soon as we escaped London.\n\nDrunk beyond measure and a tad disappointed at the lackluster of what promised to be a good do, we teetered off through the throng of late night revelers until, five minutes up the road and less than two beggars from a tube, disaster struck Nicholas over the head with a Grolsch.\n\nTake one pissed-up twat with a gang of equally smashed mates, a derogatory comment, an exchange of words that culminates in blows and abracadabra: you have a one-sided fight that results in a brave but unfortunately, vicious and rather bloody defeat.\n\nWe regroup further along Charing Cross Road with my girlfriend, who thankfully had walked on blissfully unaware and was now convincing Nick that somewhere midst the drama, a glass bottle had been smashed over his head. Hence the blood-streaming impression of a Cenobite from Hellraiser (guesses, please, on a postcard to...)\n\nSo, to cut a long story short, it was a miracle of Rudus Priest's god how we managed to get from Central London to Colchester hospital without Nicholas bleeding to death, although at one point there was enough blood on the train carriage floor for me to slip on and it and black my other eye.\n\nIt was then that Toni had the driver tear through several stops so we might reach our police escort to hospital before Nick ran dry.\n\nI hope people will forgive us our trespasses in respect of our little white lie, but the truth was concealed out of pride... dramatically, a high speed car smash lends itself to being far more metal than having your cunt kicked off. Until the next time I have my monthly emission...\n\nDani\n\nГлава 15\n\nMore rotten than a month old corpse its...\n\nPart Fifteen-Video Nasty\n\nAs you puny Earth-monkeys hadn't drunk enough from the golden font that is Cradle of Filth for one issue, up pops my column once again like some bi-monthly time machine bringing alien fauna and flora to a barren planet rock. Leaping deftly from the early-80s thrash movement and stopping for nothing, save a red vinyl import of \"Reign In Blood\"(a much needed antidote for the current metal world's decline), the Starship Inferno touches down, all too unfamiliar terrain - the making of our first official video, 'From The Cradle To Enslave'.\n\nNow, when I'm probed by Joe Public in the street on the subject, no longer do I scream, turn heel and wobble away like some great tide bound jellyfish; I reply, \"Yes for the love of all the screws in Prisoner Cell Block H, we have a fucking video!\" Christ alive, the mere discussion of it with three young lovelies the other weekend in Camden practically ensured a four-way fandango for our director Alex. Well almost, though I'm sure twixt the folds of his highly fertile imagination it was gonna be tits, clits and twister boards. Anyway\n\nY'see, Alex 'Hand' Shandon, the aforementioned director of what can only be describes as the weirdest promo this year, is utterly butterly mad. Per example, not two weeks ago he was filming a shoal of children from a friend's balcony while urging them to chorus, \"Cradle Of Filth are fucking great\", when an adjacent window opened and a furious mum appeared. Subsequently, the chant became \"Cradle Of Filth are effing great\", with Alex being heard to mutter, \"A month to submission and we're already under censorship!\"\n\nNot only did he have the better part of the band tortured or killed, coax a female actress into 50 gallons of cold, sloppy blood and secure a 6:66pm appointment with the Devil, he also helped assemble a jamboree of little people, amputees, and a curiosity robbed from a raid on Roswell for the shoot. Mr. Shandon, star in the ascendant, I take my skin off to you and the rest of the 30-strong crew who fetched, filmed, propped and slopped their way through umpteen litres of blood and a million monster makeovers. The smack obviously works\n\nSo, is the finished short movie an abortion, worth a portion, or the money spent on it extortion? Personally I think it's a roller coaster ride full of macabre ideals vexed to sinister life. It's the video Geri Halliwell should have made to poo-poo the trappings of her nice-girl image. It's the video the Lice Boys had to make.\n\nThe storyboard reads thus: band enters a temple of madness sunk deep 'neath the bowels of a church wherein instruments are discovered on a vast dais inscribed with a goat's head insignia. The band begin to play within the confines of this seal, as strange misshapen creatures who've been watching from the shadows start the cogs whirring of ancient hidden mechanics, which in turn drag a huge demonic presence into view (at this point a parody of a monk slips between the freaks and the darkness, and lights six white tapers, presumably representing the players).\n\nThe band are evidently performing for the demon, who in turn gazes deep into the psyches of each individual. Six successive scenes are then played out, each linked by their courtship of horror and by the goat's head symbol carved into the floor. For example, in once scene this symbol is discovered upon the body of a busty, witchy nymphets, who is promptly tied to a stake, fondled by leggy inquisitors and beheaded by our new drummer, Dave C**t (as opposed to the former Nicholas Bastard).\n\nPleased by the level of depravity the demon unveils in each of our minds, a signal is given to the ever-congregating mass of inhumanoids who brave the edge of the circle to watch the temple floor, in a blaze of mephitic unlight, drop away, carting the approved band straight off to the pleasures of Hell.\n\nThe monk reappears, the candles are snuffed, the horrors retreat and the floor reascends to leave the viewers staring (or gaping) at the solitary goat's head symbol. Magic. Along the way we meet an obviously unqualified Zombie dentist, and amid the hubbub of little people, a bum faced dwarf who, on the day of shooting was intent on calling Louie (the one-legged amputee and a man nearly thrice the others' stature) \"Capitain Pugwash\". There's also a veritable boudoir of sexy sirens, including Emily Bouffante (star of Pervirella) and Razorblade Smile darling Eileen Daly (which I'm not at all surprised she does, judging by the weight of her two big hits) and finally, several myth-making nasties which were brought to life by the SPFX Frankenstein responsible for the schlock Aphex Twin 'Come To Daddy' video. Much of the blood was left over from the filming of Event Horizon, the fake chest I had to don for the scene in which my heart is torn out and forced down my throat was a cast of Robert De Niro's (and subsequently too big for me); props were borrowed from the set of The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow; another FX fellow, whose expertise in prosthetics earned him work on the Hellraiser series, worked on set just for the love of scary forces; and I'm pretty sure we had the run of Bow Church based on a capital lie. I could sit here and sell you the video all day, but I have to pick my bribe up from the record company. All said and done it will delight some, sicken others and hopefully marvel more. Beam me up, Spotty..\n\nDani\n\nГлава 16\n\nTrinkets and strangely shaped baubles for all... it's\n\nPact Sixteen - Heavy Metal Xmas\n\nThis month's sojourn into mental suffering comes courtesy of the three-day Dynamo extravaganza in Holland and the inevitable kidney failure that followed. Upon this particular crest in rock pisstory, over 80 bands took to four stages whilst a record 45,000 fans converged to eat, sleep and shit that most poignant of Hermaphrodisiacs - Heavy Metal Music. This pursuit obviously sat hand in leather gauntlet with that of lager, drugs and shouting (well it did in the backstage area, at least) but as the Shite Rev. Rudas Priest (alias Lez, Lector, knackered ol' cunt and one still commiserating the death of Sir Ollie Reed in similar fashion) so expertly diagnosed, since the demise of that other celebrated boozeatheon Donington, the annual Dynamo music festival has taken over definitely as Heavy Metal Christmas.\n\nI certainly managed to iceberg the proverbial boat and of the six bands I actually dragged my sorry carcass to see, five, - Marduk, Sodom, Biohazard, Monster Magnet and S.O.D. were right crackers, whilst Metallica, headlining what must have been Heavy Metal Boxing Day, were definitely a roast prize-winning turkey. Hearsay that they were paid a $250,000 to perform aside, not only did they play a relatively snoozy set, but they also had a dozen tour buses, including ours, relocated from behind stage to what seemed like the border of Belgium, just so that their fleet of hairdressing salons could be tailored in (for legal persuasions, that may be an exaggeration).\n\nAttempting to return to our travel-coffins after our post-show piss-ups), myself and new drummer Dave tried a shortcut by clinging to the rigging of a passing P.A. truck, only to bail out 30-odd meters up the road when the bloody thing sped to a breathtaking ten maybe 15 miles per hour. Imagine our embarrassment on picking ourselves up off the asphalt only to find ourselves at the feet of a few fans who'd obviously used their initiative to stand by a festival bus stop! Such blatant twattery on our behalf was fuelled further by making an introduction.\n\n\"Hello (adopting novelty English gentry voice), we're from (hic) Cradle Of Filth don't you know?\"\n\n\"Yes (responding in a relatively normal English accent) we (hic) guessed.\" Ironically though, Metallica still had to endure the ten-ton heap of twiggy compost that had been thoughtfully dropped in the bus park, deliciously fragrant on that first day's hot summer air when the only thing between it and our tour bus was another tour bus and our namesake Cradle Of Filth cast our personal hygiene into another light, especially when friends and staff had to brave the flies to visit. __--In all truth, the whole site had a faint pongy whiff to her, nestled as she was between countryside, golf course and silage dump. And Every now and then, when another punter walkway needed some more muddy stuff underfoot just in case it should rain (which thankfully it didn't), a JCB digger would come, eat a bit, then disappear whilst a fresh load was delivered by truck. Bizarre. Pervaded by shit the breeze may have been. Pervaded with shit the actual weekend wasn't. Of the many incidents I amazingly can still remember, there were several incidents worth mentioning. Firstly, standing a tad too close while singing to flame cannon as they lit up front stage and then pretending not to lose the contents of my poo-tract in the process (my eyebrows would have been a bonus); drinking with the tallest man in Holland and miraculously convincing a few drunker people that he was my son (despite his age and let alone his height); watching Manowar prepare to go onstage after us riding four Harley Davidsons (whilst we gleaned clearance to use two golf carts for the job, right up until they obviously got wind of your comical little scheme - which was a pity, imagining the metal warriorness of it all, spiky guitars held aloft to a thundergods whilst we pootled in on electric two-seaters!); the undertaking of a brief photo shoot in the driving seat of a new VW Bug Dutch police car with pockets crammed with class A weed; S.O.D.'s faintly xenophobic 'Speak English Or Die' being played to a vast crowd, 99 per cent non-compliant; falling into a ditch, pissed midafternoon on the Sunday, attempting to cross it to get to the loos; and finally, though the mental list goes on... seeing a coachful of children who'd alighted from the ferry gantry directly before us, being frisked while our busload of dirty metal hybrids, no doubt returning from Holland laden with goodies was spared ever a second glance. As hinted at earlier, the first faint strains of chaos calling, Lez's alter ego Rudas Priest made an unsurprising appearance Heavy Metal Xmas Eve. Stumbling round the backstage bars with Anathema keyboardist Martin, declaring to all and sundry that he and his mate alone harnessed the true power of rock (organs being the new guitars in metal - his slurs, not mine) whilst the next couple of nights, Heavy Metal presents obviously opened and forgotten, bore witness to a self-declaration of benderness, an attack on a fishy wheelie bin with Martin inside it and 'incidents' involving wrestling innocent by-standers to the ground including several bemused girls. Thankfully now back in England, Lez has man-handled the sodden priest back into his box where he sits, rocking back and forth, awaiting Cradle Of Filth's next European campaign, which would presumably be Heavy Metal's New Year's or Easter... Until next we mate, Eighties disco dancing on a Sealink dance floor,\n\nYour fiend,\n\nDani\n\nГлава 17\n\nSifting the cods from the wallop, it's... it's\n\nPact Seventeen\n\nMaybe it's the heat (my brains, usually a coagulating stew on simmer, now drying under the summer sun to the consistency of Weetabix) that has edged your favorite mud-slinger, Monsieur Filth, into mentalism, or perhaps it's the two-years-out-of-date Nicorette® patch I slapped on my arse this morning (to avoid smoking myself into my Father's Kingdom a few years too early) that has whetted my fever - I don't know and I don't really care.\n\nPoints of origin have never really been a primary concern of mine; I have never doubted a Big Mac, couldn't give a shit about Brian Warner, I still adore black pudding, and have certainly never divined the future by examining my own poo in the bog-pan.\n\nAll I know is that a calendar month has passed since I last put the fear of God into you (and Christ alone knows how much my nob hurt after that...) and in that time, despite Prince Edward capturing the nation's heart by marrying the Jill Dando/Princess Diana look-alike (luckily for him, public opinion hadn't ebbed ow enough to warrant him wedding a Mother Theresa), England failing at football, and the Aussies scooping the cricket (no change there then), I have nothing of real merit to report, other than the replacement of Dave Cunt by a sleeker, more experienced drummer (whose identity for the sake of the universe must remain anonymous at this present moment... and no, it's not Darth Vader) and 30-odd days of odder dazes, full-moon phases and swear-heavy phrases. The UN may have delivered the Serbs a hefty kick in the Balkans of late, but my proverbial balls have rarely left their pockets; it seems that only my marbles have gone astray. (Astray? Sounds like \"ashtray\". Eurggh\" Damn you to hell, Nicorette® patch, you and your ten milligrams of insidious venom...)\n\nThe catalyst for this, my squillionth attempt at quitting fags (cigs not men, though Lecter tells me that the latter sit for longer in our mouth) has more to do with smoking dope than straights. This self-ultimatum thrust itself on me (leave it) one evening, when, after a hefty session of Dynamo skunk, none other than Tony Iommi, bedecked in an angel's finery, appeared to me, and haven given me the stiff middle finger (oh, where will this end?) bequeathed the revelation that Sabbath's forthcoming shows in England will be their last. Of course I knew I had taken leave of my senses (better for me to take leave of the Senses) after mulling over His Lordship's words, for who in their right mind would believe me? Last shows indeed! Whatever next, Ozzy on the wagon? Fuck off!\n\nSo, pursuing the old saying, 'One thing leads to another' (another of Lecter's), I am now a few days into kicking the habit, preferring now to extricate my lungs and beat them soundly with a stick in order to relax (these previous weeks had been so maddening that I'd started a 20-a-day routine... plus I'd been smoking...), thus benefiting my voice, and in respect of the ganja, my, um...er, what's it called..um...memory.\n\nAnyway, where were we? Ah yes, fleeing the asylum grounds... This month has been seminally weird, although not very exciting, the highlight being my purchase of an original John Wayne Gacy painting for my daughter's nursery. And if this particular artist is as far away in recognition for you as Cradle Of Filth are from a healthy chart entry, then let me enlighten you. Gacy, (also dubbed the \"Killer Clown\") was a serial killer who still holds the official (ie, proven) all-time USA Body Count Championship for his rather impressive, but naturally sick, 33 slayings of male victims whom he disposed of by burial in and around his Chicago home, having lured them under false pretenses only to chloroform and buttfuck them before counseling them in biblical merits while he strangled their still-pleading carcasses. Pleasant I know, but little Luna loves his almost child-like artistic integrity, even at the tender age of five months. Trust me, I can tell; I'm her doting daddy.\n\nPurchasing this requisite didn't come cheap, for despite the asking price, myself and my lovely girlfriend Toni had to spend a night in the company of our good mate, the video director Alex Chandon (see Pact Fifteen for phenomenal horror rating). Not that his company isn't marveloso - it is - but the weekend jaunt involved to separate fines for supposed fare evasion from the wanker Travel Police (20 notes for dodging 50 pee), another journey into Hell (though at the time it was hilarious) wherein Alex, on returning to his gaff, decided to ride bareback through Hampstead atop his friend's vulva (sorry, Volvo) screaming, \"I'll kill you, all you filthy motherfuckers.\" Finally, arising clammy-mouthed and bleary next morning, only to be subjected to a selection of his private reading material (two titles standing out in particular: the £85-a-throw Prosthetic Rehabilitation, which he 'borrowed' with lithe precision from a renowned medical books supplier, and in direct contrast. though not in subject matter, the utterly essential coffee table browser, Color Atlas Of Rheumatoid Hand Surgery, which he picked up in a car boot sale for £1...). All this made me wonder if I'd be better off with a collage of bogeys and dog cum by Chandon than the oily monsters painted by Gacy. After all, there's plenty of time for Alex to begin a lengthier murder spree, if he hasn't already. As noted, last month was a headfuck, but at least I got to see the new Star Wars movie five or ten times on pirate. I would review it in this issue, but I don't really want George Lucas on my arse (he's a tad overweight and hairy). So, until next week, lightsabre duelling on the dust planet of Tatooine. May the sauce be with you...\n\nDani\n\nГлава 18\n\nTalking bollocks? No, just a laughable penis! It's...\n\nPact Eighteen - Untitled for want of a better title\n\nMy monthly emissions are always red (but probably never read). Suffice to say this statement doesn't actually mean that I undergo periodical bleeding of the vulva, it means that I am loathe to write my column with about three hours to spare before the magazine goes to print, leaving me having to write a seemingly non-related load of old rollocks, like the six, maybe seven, lines you've just ingested (in order just to fill space). Henceforth my patience wears thinner than the pitiful excuse used to 'postpone' the English Ozzfest and temper simmers at about one shade lighter than supernova (my apologies - that would mean my monthly emissions were actually yellow and my vulva rife with gonorrhea, which would mean at least, if anything, I'm infectious).\n\nSo, if you're listening, Grand Overlord Robyn Doreian, and if you're not to taken with storming about 'Hammer Towers' punishing cringing minions with a lash of your mutated claw-like fronds, then I, Keeper Of The Cupboard Infernale, require some form of stability. I do not possess a Jedi's ability to predict the near future, nor is my name Bruce Foresight. All I require is an advance warning of deadlines, so that I might aspire to writing a font of wisdom (rather than a well of wank) for my devout congregation. I dream, nay I... I... I... euurghh!! (cough, choke, the sound of a sinuous talon being dragged across backbone)... yesss mistress, I will crawl back to the hole that spawned me. No, I won't dare speak ill of you again or, under any circumstances (lest you repeatedly play me the new Def Leppard album all the way through) will I tell my readers how the Ozzfest had only sold a few thousand tickets anyway, and that it may have sold more had the original 'proposed' Iron Maiden line-up been confirmed as the special guests ... oh, you tire of my torture now and intend giving me to your fledgling vivisectrix Val Ium instead? Well, in that case...\n\nAs well as suffering from various Val Iergies (one in particular, involving stiletto-sized stigmata all over my testicles, making for uncomfortable mountain biking), I have also been prone to a nasty bout of technofear of late, hence my computer, very much like me at the Metal Hammer offices, being confined to an unproductive life under the stairs. Which makes it even harder, attempting to write this free hand, when one has just spent a birthday weekend in London, getting cuntoxed. My hands are actually still shaking (fair enough, the right one because I masturbate continuously while I'm trying to be creative), although not from the DT's born of a three-day boozing spree, but from the cost of getting a decent round in. No wonder I choose to live in the countryside; you need the equivalent of a Third World National Debt just to get significantly ratted in the smoke. Two pauhned eighty for a facking Guinness, guv'na? Not on your Jellied Eels.\n\nWhich brings me to the hub of this issue's less-than-perfect verbal expulsion - The 'Grasspop music Festival Mishap', scarring as always, Cradle Of Filth. Now, I know I've been relatively cruel about Belgium within these fair pages in the past (something about it's population hung upside-down on crosses with their faces put to fire, or some such harmless reproach, but I must congratulate it's existence for what turned out to be quite an adventure. The festival itself routine, loads of top bands - Danzig, Immortal, Mercyful Fate to name but a few - rainfall on a biblical scale, portaloos crammed with foul-smelling foreign meaty poos and, of course, the aftershow Rudas Priest entertainment at the aftershow bar. in essence Heavy Metal Pancake Day. However, dear old dribbling Rudas is not this tale's star. Remember me mentioning a new drummer who couldn't, for various reasons, be as yet named? Well, for the sake of his identity, we shall refer to him solely as Adrian From At The Dates.™\n\nOn our return to the hotel (a few of us seeking further lubrication at an all-night bar) and finding the rest of our troupe smoking weed in the lobby, we decided with sozzled logic, not only to rearrange the furniture, but to barricade a snoring Rudas in his room, after burying him muddily under as many plants as we could pull from their pots. Painting, cabinets, even the hotel's cigarette machine joined the makeshift wall, as we scoured the corridors looking for fresh heavyweight objects, crippled with hysterics. It was only when we took the destruction back to the lobby that Adrian From At The Gates™ noticed the Securicam and decided that, to avoid morning incrimination, he should rip it from the wall, which seemed a brilliant idea - until the actual morning when we, nursing hangovers, were being questioned by the Belgian Police (well, all save Rudas, now back to Lez, who from being freed from his room had fled, having been smuggled into Europe without his mislaid passport in our coaches hold, and subsequently didn't want arresting...).\n\nOf course, we all blamed imaginary bands called 'Obsession' and 'Horrible Angel' (from Lithuania) for the carnage, and Adrian From At The Gates™ believed he'd got away with destroying the camera, until dragged off to a backroom and being shown videotaped footage of his heinous deed by two unamused looking cops. Talk about You've Been Framed... on second thoughts, don't bother. 'Who's Been Maimed' would be more watchable.\n\nWell, that's shit for another calendar month. So, until next we meet, twelve hundred quid down for criminal damage, sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite (let alone bury you in potted plants and barricade the doors)...\n\nYour Fiend,\n\nDani\n\nГлава 19\n\nFilling The Heavens With Dirty Great Balls it's...\n\nPact Nineteen - Eclipsing All Else\n\nAugust. Hardly a majestic or venerable month, inscribed as it was with a tyrannous nature more in keeping with namesake Caesar assailing us with hails (geddit?), earthquakes, floods, twisters, heat waves... if I didn't know better I'd say Ming The Merciless was abroad with a target: Earth Death Ray.\n\nThere was the solar eclipse on the 11th, which in all fairness, and despite garnering profound astrological significance, was about as exciting as wiping your arse with your other hand. In truth, the more I think about it the more it seems that prophet Nostradamus has got something there ... wiping your (or 'thy', as I believe he phrased) arse with the other hand can be fairly revelatory, especially if your imagination lends credence to the fact that this rarely performed act could actually be someone else wiping your bum for you. So with this in mind (after sitting on my digits for 20 minutes for that benumbing authenticity), first up with the job with the slidy school toilet paper (or better still, the new Coal Chamber album) would have to be Patrick Moore, for all his bumbling eclipse rhetoric over the passing few moons (I'd certainly log onto his Website). Jack Koschick - promoter of this years Milwaukee Metalfest, who didn't even have the decency to provide a rider, or the venue with a PA that worked. And finally (for the perviness of it all), Jane Seymour, who could pamper me like a baby whilst tending to any other basic necessities I so desired...\n\nMmm, Jane Seymour. Doctor Quinn.\n\nAnyway, dickstrations aside, August was a relatively extreme few weeks all round, and it hardly seems appropriate that I should ramble on about myself and my experiences in lieu of the recent devastation caused by the earthquakes in Turkey. But I will. It's my fucking column!\n\nNot one usually to sit at home blowing my own trumpet but, if anthropologists are to be beloved, that one restrictive little vertebrae in the male spine is the next thing to go in the evolutionary chain, thus rendering most men hermitic and women unneeded (though this is where Val Ium interjects by mentioning the dildo...), but last month was a blinder. Then again, perhaps I shouldn't have stared so vehemently at the eclipse, but I didn't want to miss it and there was this big fucking round thing in the way, and by the time it drifted past the eclipse was over. Typical. Patrick Moore, wipe my arse.\n\nThings didn't exactly get off to a flying start when two little hoodlums pranged my girlfriend's brand new car, and then grew progressively worse when their parents claimed I'd assaulted the brats with their own football boots! Now you know as well as I do I'd never stoop to such a thing (possibly because they were about the same height as me), but the general animosity soon simmered down and the matter was resolved, at least I don't expect the six sets of graves to be stumbled upon just yet...\n\nLughnasadh gone, the great witchy periodical Lammas found the band ensconced in the great USA for not only the Metalfest, but a string of club dates, culminating over the Canadian border in Toronto. I remember this day vividly, because of the advance Misfits album I received from Roadrunner, which rocks like King Kong in a cage (and the new Coal Chamber, which is not so much a roller coaster as a coffee coaster), and the fact that this was the beginning of a week's worth of anti-gravity, depravity and snorting in the lavatory. Well, just about doing anything, and everything, including the rare onboard-a-tour bus phenomenon of taking a poo. Oh yes, our bus was like a three-star of David Hotel in heaven compared to the traveling hippy commune we're familiar with in Europe. Air-con, two full entertainment systems, rear lounge, kitchenette - it was enough to bring rudas out from the husk of his keeper, take three acid blots and hide himself in what was a more than ample sized closet for storage.\n\nStill reeling from jetlag and duty free, we literally had to be peeled from bed the next morning after our return to face an in-store signing session as part and parcel of another magazines award week. We weren't alone - we would sign; Feeder, 3 Colors Red and 'A' would play, and after watching the Circus Of Horrors perform, all would regroup for a Barbie on the rooftop patio. Good plan in theory, but never grant near-dead menthe promise of booze... especially that which is free.\n\nTwo hours is a long time for anyone sitting, signing and swilling a lethal concoction of Absolute and JD, and by the time we eventually made it back to our (which according to Music Week and The Daily Star - must be true! - we wreaked, having all ready tossed pictures out into the street below, narrowly missing security and a distressed store rep...) there was a spreading pool of pee in the corner of the Video Department, two bemused and abused Deejays who'd attempted interviews, and a drummer so drunken that he was wobbling astride industry people's tables at the barbecue screaming \"Wankers!\", and throwing the universal sign of metal in their astonished faces. Police and the Fire Department were eventually alerted, whether it was for us of the Circus, who's also revolted, I can't rightly remember - we made good our escape during the mêlée.\n\nAnd finally, the awards ceremony itself. Not much to say here, apart from an impressively spooky decor and an abundance of people with colds in the toilets... though it does show the current clime in our beloved scene when B-movie actor David Soul received the loudest response of the evening!\n\n'Til next time we meet, dwelling on reasons why there appears to be too many pop bands winning awards from heavy metal magazines...\n\nYours in disgust\n\nYour fiend,\n\nDani\n\nГлава 20\n\nBi or just curious? It's...\n\nPact Twenty - Alcoholocaust\n\nFollowing 'Er next door's sporadic but commendable thesis on female hatred last issue, I was aroused enough by the full use of her eloquent tongue to get something similar nature off my tiny-titted, yet highly sensitive chest this month. Whereas Val despises women, I , on the other have a deep throated (sorry, rooted) hatred of men. Not any breed in particular, just the whole fucking deal. Men are libidinous, obnoxious, and chauvinistic...and if that's not enough they're hairy, rough, muscular and endowed. No, I hate them. Give me a good-looking woman any day...actually strike that comment, cap'n - just any kind of woman any day (mantelpieces et al). So you're not alone, young lady. Calm down, perhaps take a valium or two and learn to vent your anger elsewhere (Crack! Brzzzzzz! Sudden sounds of bullwhip and a 13-inch anal desecrator revving up, minus the fizz of amyl-nitrate for comfort).\n\nLimping on, though eager not to suffer a similar fate, I must also commend the words of the headmistress for the kind words in her editorial last month. Firstly, I never cackle demonically (well, not unless I'm hunched over a light box on behalf of Metal Hammer, scouring for photos of rock stars looking chubby...), and secondly, my column was late because I genuinely had a kidney infection. No shit! Plenty of pee though, and I was half tempted to send in a vial of it as proof. 85% fuckin' proof!\n\nAnyway, more on the subject of alcohol abuse later, but for now just abuse, for also in her editorial, the grand inquisitor branded me as an arsehole, which given the circumstances I've just described is, I think, a little unfair...I'm actually a total wanker. Evidence of this can be found not only be catching having a quick five-to-one with 'Palm of the Handerson' in the church every Sunday (come on, isn't that the sole reason priest have you close your eyes and bow your heads for prayer - so they can ease the old fellow out of the cassock and toss at the choirboys?), but also on a new T-shirt by Glue Grape in America with my face on it and the word 'wanker'. Charmed I'm sure. Wanker, maybe; arsehole, not. That term is exclusively reserved for PROPER journalists. Take one particular specimen who I shall refer to as 'P.E.' (for his initials are this).\n\nFirst off, on a recent homeward-bound plane journey, much throwing of the horns and head banging was undertaking when we realized we were traveling at 666mph. Our friend Lex then coined the phrase \"faster than the speed of evil\" when our velocity increased. As bands are prone to do, the phrase was bandied around with much mirth. And that's how, at a certain awards ceremony, Shane Embury (of Napalm Death) was able to joke with said journalist, 'P.E.', that he was currently listening to what would surely become a monster hit album, 'Faster Than The Speed Of Evil' by (the fictitious) Absolute Power.\n\nAnd lo and behold, what appeared on 'P.E.''s personal play list the following week but 'Faster Than The Speed Of Evil' by (you guessed it) Absolute Power. Advance demo version. How hip. Sounds like Dan Silver.\n\nSecondly, the same journalist reviews our 'PanDaemonAeon' video release a week later, this time for Q magazine, which obviously being a non-metal publication requires a more cooler-than-thou mentality. Hence, it's a touch sarcastic, culminating in the statement that: \"low budget it may be, but The Blair Witch Project it is not,\" implying that, well, it's just not scary.\n\nFair enuff, he's entitled to his own opinion, but has he actually seen Blair Witch, or is he just going on hearsay from Stateside, where the movie is currently showing (it doesn't come out here until October 29...)? Because I've seen it and - oh God! - how I wanted this film to live up to its boast of being the most frightening movie since The Exorcist, leaving American audiences speechless and aghast. Well, speechless only because American audiences must be dumb! I'm sorry, but how anyone can rate this film is beyond me. I was praying that the student union cast would be killed off every step of the way - it was either that, or put out my own eyes to relieve boredom.\n\nOK, perhaps there were a few moments of suspense, but my main point here is: don't believer everything you read, especially when it's from the inkwell of someone who writes out of their arse. What next, COF involved in gay porno? Oops!\n\nFinally onto the promise of alcohol. No, it's not my round; I'm to relate to you the perils of Red Bull and vodka on special offer, hence the aforementioned big, bad kidney incident. It was a foggy moonless Eve...sorry. Luna was at her Grandma's and seeing as it was our night off, Tone and I decided to get horribly drunk. However, I'd forgotten about the Red Bull and voddy binge in Salzburg a few years back that the band barely lived through, which had culminated in a full bus brawl and our tour manager having a nervous breakdown. I'd sworn and oath never to touch the lethal brew again... This palatable warning drifting back to me the following morning when I awoke to what looked like a Bosnian bombsite and a pounding ache in my lower back.\n\nApparently, on returning home late I had dozed off in the shower, deciding at about four or five in the morning to crawl out and listen to Slayer. Two tracks into 'Show No Mercy' there was an almighty crash likened to several hundred CDs falling to the ground and a dull, resigned thud. When Toni thundered downstairs to witness what fresh idiocies I'd inflicted (and no doubt to turn the taps off and punch my lights in), there was I, buried under a mountain of shelves and discs, most of which I'd collapsed upon, after pulling them down by walking into a wall.\n\nThere's definitely another lesson to be learned here, but seeing as it was the first time in my boozing career that I'd blacked out, I couldn't possibly remember what it could possibly be. Ah that's it...don't try this at home, kids - go round someone else's.\n\nYours desperate for a less destructive vice, perhaps heroin or murder,\n\nDani\n\nГлава 21\n\nThe current affairs column with the biggest fattest tits and arse. It's\n\nPact Twenty-One - Wank, Suck and Fuck With Me\n\nSalutations from the sewer creepy-crawlers, underworld trawlers and fellow coprophagists, I trust that your Halloween was as unconvincing as my own, despite the fact that at the time of writing it hasn't even occurred yet; such is the urgency of delivering my goetry and prose to you every month, my humble but fleet-footed flock. No grisly yet beautiful teen murders, no bobbing for severed heads, no insurrection of the walking dead? Obviously no fucking fun then...\n\nForgive me my trespasses (but the windows were unlocked), I know I'm a total cynic when it comes to predicting much-touted future events -possibly something to do with a scuffed crystal ball and too many towers in my tarot - but it's as plain as the witch teat on your thigh that the millennium will come and go a disappointment and All-Hallows Eve, that most ardent of non-Xmas festivals, will have been celebrated by no more than a two pence-off-a-Guinness - offer, a few manky pumpkins and a passing cheesy grin from a Hammer film. Here in good ol' England we seem to pride ourselves on our lack of enthusiasm for this sort of thing, preferring to let the pomp and ceremony that the Americans bestow upon Halloween pass us by, while all the time pining the values that apparently once made this country great. Bollocks. It's all bollocks.\n\nIn fact it reminds me of a saying that we used to share as children, as we humped huge vats of boiling pitch to the edge of the castle ramparts to see off wondering friars and taxmen...\n\n\"Sod your Epiphany, your Advent, your Lent, Pancake's day is shallow and Easter is bent.\n\nGive us three witches, hob gobbles and frights, for Christmas is ages and the rest of the year's shite.\"\n\nTraditional.\n\nPut a marked improvement for All Hollow's Eve in your constitutional mandate Labour government and you've got my vote. Maybe call it 'The Blair Witch Project'?\n\nBack on the subject of millennial brain fever, someone was adjudged insane enough to include our new video in the Millennium Dome Experience - I kid you not. Apparently, to co-demonstrate the use of eloquent language in youth culture (?), a part of the film will be shown to the unwitting public when it eventually opens on the Eve of the forth millennium. Talk about Jeckyl and Heidi. Anyway, it's not as if the words will be that apparent from the video anyway - we're hardly S-Club Seven (more the Cess Pub Six). In hindsight it's a pity we didn't shoot a promo for the EP track 'Of Dark Blood And Fucking'...now that would have been worth seeing, if not starring in.\n\nMove shitly on and to put the intended record straight, Cradle Of Filth have parted company with long term guitarist Stuart Antis and everybody's favorite pastor of disaster, Lecter (whose triple exploits have long defaced the annals of the cupboard 'infernal') due to increasing personal differences, including that of a common musical goal. Like and expensive sex toy, I thought it well worth bringing to the public attention seeing as the much-loathed industry gossip-mongers have already vultured enough rumors about their departure to warrant a novella, an idea, which, like the tory, tickles me pink every time I dwell on it, especially the imaginary first chapter heading of 'Stress, and how to deal with the bullshit'. Like the aforementioned genital pleasure, Stuart and Lez will be sorely missed, after all, replacing Rudas was always going to be sticky (unless of course TV's Father Jack is available, conscious and a grade eith pianist), but the guitarist situation has been righted by the gaudy return of the swashbuckling Gian Pyres and 'The Principal Of Evil Made Flesh's' valiant Paul A. So, onwards and upwards as the vicar instructed the petulant choirboy. Finally, on a lighter, more sensual note...If you're looking for nothing better than suicidal and fucking savage underwater massacre this weekend (as you do), then check out the Jaws wannabe Deep Blue Sea at your local flicks. Lacking all the suspense of Spilberg's original fishy masterpiece, Deep Blue Sea swims around the ludicrous plot of an undersea research team attempting to 'train' great white sharks. Pony, I know.\n\nWhere it wins you however are the extremely graphic shark attacks and especially the death of lead honcho Samuel L. Jackson, which could turn out to be a piece of schlock-cinema history. Halfway through the film, Jackson, sho up to now has been team-leader, is just sinking his teeth into a rousing, survivalist speech worthy of a cheap Grammy (a hammy), when a fuck off Great White bursts out of the water and sinks it's teeth basically all over him.\n\nHe is then promptly dragged below and torn in bloody two. Hoorah!\n\nEither he couldn't stomach the plot (not that he had much of a stomach left) or he appeared for half his normal fee, but either way, what an exit. Which is where I am prone to falter...\n\nI would write more this issue, but I have a certain crawling Miss Luna bashing at my ankles with a walk-along Goofy, builders are about to take the roof off my kitchen and I have a driving lesson in Ipswich within the hour. How could Hell be any worse? (Wll, other than Luna not being there).\n\nYour contemplating the new cradle line-up changing it's name to 'Insanus'...\n\nDani"
