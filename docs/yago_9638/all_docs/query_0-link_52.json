        "text": "Post by petrolino on\n\n10 British Comedies of the 1960s\n\n10. 'Hot Enough For June' (1964 - Ralph Thomas)\n\nRalph Thomas directs favourite leading man Dirk Bogarde alongside Sylva Koscina in this spy spoof.\n\n09. 'What's Good For The Goose' (1969 - Menahem Golan)\n\nNorman Wisdom seeks to recapture his youth as a bank employee who gives a lift to a pair of hitchhiking hippie chicks (Sarah Atkinson & Sally Geeson). Featuring music by Electric Banana (aka. Pretty Things).\n\n08. 'What A Carve Up!' (1961 - Pat Jackson)\n\nAn all-star horror comedy loosely based on the same novel by Frank King that inspired the Boris Karloff vehicle 'The Ghoul' (1933). It's co-scripted by legendary farceur Ray Cooney.\n\n07. 'Zeta One' (1969 - Michael Cort)\n\nColourful cult sci-fi shocker with James Robertson Justice and Charles Hawtrey challenging the dominance of psychedelic space vixens. Cast includes Dawn Addams, Anna Gael, Brigitte Skay, Valerie Leon, Yutte Stensgaard, Carol Hawkins, Angela Grant & Kirsten Betts.\n\n06. 'French Dressing' (1964 - Ken Russell)\n\nUnusual comedy with experimental touches from Ken Russell who celebrates seaside culture (he was from Southampton) with lashings of coastal charm. It stars Marisa Mell.\n\n05. 'For Men Only' (1968 - Pete Walker) / 'School For Sex' (1969 - Pete Walker)\n\nPete Walker's timeless attacks on censorship offer up a pair of thoroughly engaging tales. The story in 'For Men Only' details the life of a photographer and his models who're carving out a limited existence on the fringe of the swinging '60s - in a delicious twist, the overground becomes the underground. 'School For Sex' takes place at a highly unusual finishing school. Both films star David Aylward who would become a part of David Sullivan's stable in the late 1970s, appearing in a couple of movies with Mary Millington.\n\n...\n\n04. 'She'll Have To Go' (1962 - Robert Asher)\n\nDelightful crime comedy with a tantalizing plot starring game show host Bob Monkhouse and singer Anna Karina.\n\n03. 'San Ferry Ann' (1965 - Jeremy Summers)\n\nJeremy Summers shows the potential offered by the short subject format to '60s comedy with this near-silent musical piece. It influenced some great short films to come including Eric Sykes' wind-up 'The Plank' (1967) and Bob Kellett's social satire 'Futtock's End' (1970). Barbara Windsor is exceptional.\n\n02. The 'Carry On' Series (Various - Gerald Thomas)\n\nPerhaps the greatest British comedy film series. Every fan has their own favourites and I think some of the best entries can be found in the 1960s.\n\n01. 'If... ' (1969 - Lindsay Anderson) / 'O Lucky Man!' (1973 - Lindsay Anderson) / 'Britannia Hospital' (1982 - Lindsay Anderson)\n\nFrom the coal black abstraction of 'If... ', to the dour musical fantasy of 'O Lucky Man!', to the alarming satire that lies behind 'Britannia Hospital', Lindsay Anderson's 'Mick Travis' trilogy is my favourite film trio in all of British cinema, regardless of genre.\n\n'Carry On Playing' at the Proms\n\nHope you enjoy the movies!\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\n27 British Comedies of the 1970s\n\n27. 'Adventures Of A Taxi Driver' (1976 - Stanley A. Long) / 'Adventures Of A Private Eye' (1977 - Stanley A. Long) / 'Adventures Of A Plumber's Mate' (1978 - Stanley A. Long)\n\n26. 'Are You Being Served?' (1977 - Bob Kellett)\n\n25. 'I'm Not Feeling Myself Tonight' (1976 - Joseph McGrath)\n\n24. 'Every Home Should Have One' (1970 - Jim Clark)\n\n23.

'Nasty Habits' (1977 - Michael Lindsay-Hogg)\n\n17. 'Hoffman' (1970 - Alvin Rakoff)\n\n16. 'Jabberwocky' (1977 - Terry Gilliam)\n\n15. 'The Ups And Downs Of A Handyman' (1976 - John Sealey)\n\n14. 'The Rise And Rise Of Michael Rimmer' (1970 - Kevin Billington)\n\n13. 'Spaced Out' (1979 - Norman J. Warren)\n\n12. 'The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins' (1971 - Graham Stark)\n\n11. 'No Sex Please : We're British' (1973 - Cliff Owen)\n\n10. 'Keep It Up Downstairs' (1976 - Robert Young)\n\n09. 'Perfect Friday' (1970 - Peter Hall)\n\n08. 'Four Dimensions Of Greta' (1972 - Pete Walker)\n\n07. 'Rosie Dixon - Night Nurse' (1978 - Justin Cartwright)\n\n06. 'Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny & Girly' (1970 - Freddie Francis)\n\n05. 'There's A Girl In My Soup' (1970 - Roy Boulting)\n\n04. 'Ooh... You Are Awful' (1972 - Cliff Owen)\n\n03. 'Royal Flash' (1975 - Richard Lester)\n\n02.

'Up 'N' Under' (1998 - John Godber)\n\nPost by Aj_June on\n\nAj_June\n\nI was going to post this one too.\n\nIt was my introduction to British comedy.\n\nI still thing it is my favorite...\n\nI am glad you also like it a lot, Kijii!\n\nI thought Terry-Thomas and Sim were awesome but everyone delivered. British humour at its best!\n\nRecently, I started exploring 30s British comedies. Will post the movie names in future if I find good ones.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nThanks petrolino I enjoy very much a good 60s British comedy, some great recommendations to track down !\n\nNothing quite like that distinctly British sense of humour...\n\nLadies Who Do (1963) C.M. Pennington-Richards .\n\nWith a terrific cast this little film is a charming gem. It tells story about a group of female office cleaning friends who share in the discovery of hot stock tips accidently found in the office bin...\n\nHi planet. I've not heard of 'Ladies Who Do' so I'm intrigued. I looked it up and I'm familiar with many of the comic actors in it (including ubiquitous character actress Marianne Stone). It was released on dvd as part of the 'Best Of British' collection by Odeon Entertainment. I'll look out for it, thanks.\n\nPost by louise on\n\nMake Mine Mink (1960) is a favourite of mine, very funny film with Hattie Jacques, Terry-Thomas, and Athene Sayler as impoverished gentry who take to crime so they can continue to support charity. Kenneth Williams very funny in a short scene as a fence.\n\nA Hard Day's Night (1964). wonderfully funny film. The Beatles all very funny, and Wilfrid Bramble great as Paul's wicked old grandfather.\n\nHot Millions (1968). Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, both very funny. Ustinov is an embezzler who passes himself off as a computer expert, Maggie Smoth is his wildly incompetent secretary.\n\nCRooks and Coronets (1969). TWo American crooks insinuate themselves into the household of eccentric aristocrat Edith Evans with the intention of robbing her, but end up helping her instead.\n\nPost by sostie on\n\n27 British Comedies of the 1970s\n\nThe British film industry seemed to constantly churn out film adaptations of TV series (On The Buses apparently saved Hammer Films!). I enjoyed Are You Being Served, On The Buses films and Ooh... You Are Awful more than their origin shows. Three particular favourites were Please Sir, Steptoe & Son and Steptoe & Son Ride Again - the latter two probably the only ones where I actually love the TV show as well.\n\nThough they were not at their best there were still some good Carry On films, the much maligned Carry on at Your Convenience still is one of my faves. I preferred bad Carry On to any of the Adventures or Confessions series.\n\nNice to see The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins which is worthy of inclusion if only for the \"Lust\" segment...Harry H Corbett is amazing in it.\n\nTheatre Of Blood (1973) deserves a mention as one of the best of that era\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nMake Mine Mink (1960) is a favourite of mine, very funny film with Hattie Jacques, Terry-Thomas, and Athene Sayler as impoverished gentry who take to crime so they can continue to support charity.

The director Robert Asher made one of my selections, 'She'll Have To Go'.\n\n'Hot Millions' has been shown too.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\n27 British Comedies of the 1970s\n\nThe British film industry seemed to constantly churn out film adaptations of TV series (On The Buses apparently saved Hammer Films!).

My least favourite is the big screen 'George And Mildred'.\n\n'70s 'Carry On' entries are some of the most fun but I think they were better earlier in the decade. Also, the decision to sack Charles Hawtrey proved fatal and the series never really recovered after that. A planned reboot is still in the works.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\n20 British Comedies of the 1980s & 1990s\n\n16. 'Funny Bones' (1995 - Peter Chelsom)\n\nSome real \"interesting\" inclusions and omissions there but I'm so happy you included Funny Bones...one of the most underrated films of that decade.\n\nCan't let the 80s go by without mentioning Bill Forsyth's Gregory's Girl (his That Sinking Feeling would be in my 70s list)\n\nWhat omissions would you add to the list? 'The Full Monty' (1997) perhaps, or 'Notting Hill' (1999)? One film I'd never include is 'Spice World' (1997)."
