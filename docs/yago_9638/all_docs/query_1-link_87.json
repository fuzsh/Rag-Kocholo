        "text": "Director: Alex Chandon\n\nStarring ; Jo Hartley, George Newton, James Doherty, Seamus O’Neill\n\nInbred is a rare treat. It’s a brilliant low budget UK indie Horror movie that take’s off cult American classic horror’s and successfully merges them with a unique twist of Northern English humour and self parody.\n\nJo Hartley (This Is England) plays youth worker Kate, and along with ‘rules are rules’ type bore Jeff, (played perfectly by James Doherty) they take three kids out into the deepest rural parts of the countryside to teach the kids that not everything happens in the concrete jungles they have grown up in.\n\nJeff is keen to get the group working on ‘projects’ although he means well he just bores the youngsters, Tim (James Burrows), Zeb (Terry Haywood) and Dwight (Chris Waller) and it’s left to Kate to try and engage the youngsters.\n\nThey arrive at the dilapidated old country house and instantly Tim, Zeb and Dwight are not happy. Kate suggests a deal, the youngsters clean up the mess and make the place liveable for a few days and they can all go down to the local pub they saw on the way,ominously named ‘The Dirty Hole’.\n\nThey trek to the pub in the hope of warm food and some warmth. Landlord Jim (played in fine style by the ever excellent Seamus O’Neill) seems a little shocked to see ‘outsiders’ and tell’s the group as much. Kate asks for food ‘Hot Food’ relating to Jim a signs she’s seen on the way in. Jim’s retort is priceless “It says NOT food”. The most he can offer them is pork scratchings that all the group agree taste rather odd.\n\nWhat ensues in the following hour and twenty minutes is a bizarre mixture of The League Of Gentlemen and Straw Dogs capped off with a strong zing of Northern humour. Whilst Seamus O’Neill easily steals the show, strong support cameos by Geroge Newton and Dominic Brunt whom most will know as Paddy from TVs ‘Emmerdale’ are also enjoyable additions to a really enjoyable if absurd low budget British horror romp. Highly recommeded.\n\n8/10"
