        "text": "Post Thumb:\n\n/may11/inbreds.jpg\n\nSome good news landed in our inbox this week for those anxious to check out UK horror-comedy Inbred in the form of a new sales agent for the flick and a big batch of new stills. Read on for the details!\n\nDarclight Films, the horror arm of Arclight Films, will be taking Inbred (review here) to Berlin’s European Film Market in February, and hopes are that distribution deals will happen soon after.\n\nAlex Chandon’s Inbred follows a disparate group of young urban offenders and their care workers who embark on a community service weekend in the strange, remote Yorkshire village of Mortlake, which prides on keeping itself to itself. A minor incident with some locals rapidly escalates into a blood-soaked, deliriously warped nightmare for all involved.\n\nJo Hartley, Seamus O’Neill, James Doherty, James Burrows, Nadine Mulkerrin, Neil Leiper, and Terry Haywood star.\n\nWhile we await more news and a “proper” trailer soon, feast your eyes on our image gallery below, and then head over to the official Inbred website and Alex Chandon’s Facebook page.\n\nVISIT THE EVILSHOP @ AMAZON!\n\nGot news?
