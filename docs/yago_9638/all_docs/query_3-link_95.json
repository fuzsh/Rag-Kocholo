        "text": "Klause: The Devil’s Primate (2019)\n\nDirector: Steven Sibley\n\nWriter: Steven Sibley\n\nStarring: Lee Nicholson, Chris Middis, Graham Saxon, Liam Olsen\n\nExcellent low budget action from Sunderland! Has a killer monkey, ninjas and gore!\n\nThis film is great and is recommended for fans of SOV, early Alex Chandon, Troma and German splatter flicks.\n\nIn a new interview in the series leading up to Horror-on-Sea Film Festival, I got a chance to ask Klause: The Devil’s Primate writer-director Steven Sibley a few questions about what we can expect from the film.\n\nQ. You feature film Klause: The Devil’s Primate has been selected to play play at Horror-on-Sea. Can you tell us what we can expect from the film?\n\nBabes, blood and a ninja!!!\n\nThe film cost under £200 and the monkey suit isn’t on Stan Winston level. I set out to make a straight B-movie and not make it self aware or a comedy. There is humour throughout the film but it occurs naturally. If the characters played it straight then the audience will take the situations serious and believe Klaus is more than a man in a suit.\n\nQ. The film looks to throw a variety of theme and genres in the mix, what were your inspirations when writing the script for the film?\n\nOriginally Klaus started out a typical creature on the loose flick. We started this version in 2006, we shot over 4 months and had two scenes to do and finish it when one of the main actors just vanished.\n\nSometimes I don’t have a script when i shot stuff just an idea and a rough outline. In case an actor leaves the project for whatever reason I always shot there death scenes first, so if they go, I can have there set piece and work round it.\n\nI cut the footage and it came to 40 mins. I wanted it to be feature length so over the next few years I tried various ways to get it to 60 mins.\n\nMy biggest inspiration is Roger Corman and knowing he was a master at adding footage to incomplete films to pad them out. I know other film makers do this but Roger is the most prolific and does it best. One of the best examples of this method is Raiders of the Living Dead (1986) which has three versions. Brett Piper original version is nothing like the version finally release credited to Sam sherman.\n\nThe next version I tried the usual character tells the footage as flashback stuff but they never worked. The final version I wrote a 20 page script and decided to set the set up story in the woods and use the college version again as flashback.\n\nI watched all the creature features set in the wood so I could to try and not repeat whats all ready been done.\n\nDue to another actor letting me down one day before filming and re writing day by day and more re casting I started adding more things like, a group of mercenaries and a ninja. All this changed the film from being a killer ape film, to an action, horror adventure flick. Bringing all the characters, main plots and sub plots was a nightmare.\n\nThe final cut ended up using 2 mins from the original version.\n\nQ. What were some of your influences for the look and style of the film?\n\nThe film is dedicated to three people Teddy Page, Tomas Tang and Godfrey Ho. I love Filipino action films and Namsploitation from the 80’s.\n\nCompanies like Silver Star, directors like Cario G Santigo, Eddie Romero and Bobby A. Suarez. My favourite and biggest influence is Teddy Page who when I put the mercenaries in it, re-watched all his Jungle flicks and everything with a team of mercs hunting a creature. The last 20 mins is my homage to Teddy Page and is style of action.\n\nWith having a killer ape, mercs I thought why not a ninja. Where else was I going to have a chance to have a ninja fight an ape with nunchucks and shurikens.\n\nIt was the last thing I added to the film. I knew the only films to turn to were the cut and paste ninja films from Tomas Tang, Joesph Lai and Godfrey Ho. All there films have A plot and B plot. The A plot is always a film the company picked up and complete or incomplete and nothing to do with ninjas. Tang/Lai would cut and re-dub in a second plot with ninjas and the result is usually hilarious and bizarre. The ninja character combines the difference between the two main companies involved Tomas Tang’s Filmark the ninjas always are mystical, use magic and unpredictable. Joseph Lai/Godfrey Ho’s IFD company ninja aren’t as off key more crazy colours and the main thing, a ninja head band with ninja written on it which was the important piece of costume in the film.\n\nQ. Where there any elements of the original script which were adapted during filming?\n\nThere was never a completed script at any point for any of numerous rewrites/re shoots. None of this helped with putting together the final edit, apart from the 40 mins not used in the flashback. There was only one scene I cut from the final cut and an alternate ending..\n\nQ. Did you experience any issues during filming?\n\nThe same issues every film maker faces. No money, unreliable actors getting kicked out or not getting locations. It depends on the person how they deal with these problems and learning to adapt to sudden changes. When your not paying people they can be flaky and the passion for the project might not last as long as everyone else, but sometimes these things can go in your advantage and might alter the initial plot and structure. You’ve got to go with your heart and learn from your mistakes.\n\nQ. What were some of your favourite moments during filming?\n\nThe ninja scenes and the doing the money shot gore gag. I won’t say what it is but it was the most expensive day of filming I’ve ever done (£35).\n\nMy favourite memories are off bringing my son to set, he was two and a half at the time. I was worried he’d be terrified of Klaus’ costume so I hid amongst his stuffed toys in the costume and waited for him to come in his room. When he entered I stood up and he squealed, I then took the mask off he stopped squealing and said “dada”. So when I bought him on set and someone had the costume on, he’d call them “dada” or say “two dada’s”.\n\nQ. What makes Klause: The Devil’s Primate stand out as something different in the horror genre?\n\nKlaus isn’t anything original in terms of plot. I think it stands out more because it a hybrid of genres. Started as one thing ended up being many others. I like to think it comes together and ties everything up. The plot could be taken from many points of view and due to re shoots and re casts there are so many layers.\n\nQ. What do you hope people take away after watching the film?\n\nMost of all have fun! Enjoy the ride.\n\nQ. Do you have any other projects which you are currently working on?\n\nI’ve got a few projects I want to do. The problem is which one having zero budget isn’t the biggest problem doing the right film is. I’d like to collaborate on a project or direct someones script. I love working with people and developing ideas and creating something different within their chosen genre.\n\nQ. If someone was looking to direct their own film what advice would you give them?\n\nThe only person that can tell or stop you making your film is you. Sometimes they go smooth sometimes not. It’s the journey, over coming obstacles and most of all learning from mistakes. Research the genre/s your working in. The internet has all the films, interviews and ‘making of’ you could dream off.\n\nThink outside the box, yes everything has been done but nothing everything as been mixed up. All my films are reteliings of other films.\n\nI just switch and change the chemistry and structure of the plot to make it different. Take criticism, listen to feedback not everyone’s going to like your film. Listen to your heart and feeling in your gut what is right. Don’t be afraid to try new things or take suggestions from people. I listen to everyone on set and sometimes someones input could bring a view or something vital or interesting you never saw before. Respect everyone on the same level if you can’t and even if you are paying people respect and compassion goes along way."
