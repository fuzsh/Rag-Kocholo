        "text": "1997\n\n1 hr 32 mins\n\nComedy\n\nNR\n\nWatchlist\n\nSex, science fiction, and the Royal Family get mixed up into one big cocktail in this over-the-top satiric comedy. In the non-existent British colony of Condon, Queen Victoria has decreed that dissident intellectuals and \"perverts\" are to be prosecuted and tossed in jail. To make her edict stick, the Queen orders that a wall be built around Condon, establishing a \"Monarchy of Terror.\" Sexual enthusiasts are driven out of sight, and form a super-secret \"Cult of Perv\" in order to follow their sensual instincts. The Cult is led by the Demon Nanny, who gives birth to a daughter just before she passes on. The Nanny's child, Pervirella (Emily Bouffante), quickly grows to be the new hope for the Pervs to rise from their chains, but she has a bit of a problem -- whenever someone snatches the magic amulet from her throat, she is overcome with nymphomaniacal desire which she can't help but satisfy. Pervirella also stars David Warbeck, Eileen Daly, Jonathan Ross, and Sexton Ming."
