        "text": "Alex Chandon's Yorkshire-based survival horror Inbred is rolling along through production and a generous assortment of new images from the film have been added to the film's official website. Chandon has a very solid cast on board for this one - including Shane Meadows regular Jo Hartley and veteran character player James Doherty - with the gore effects being handled by a company that normally specializes in ultra-realistic crime scene and accident recreations for military and police training so this should bring a nice balance of splatter and character. We've pulled the choicest images for our gallery below and are once again including the initial teaser.\n\nA disparate group of young urban offenders and their care workers embark on a community service weekend in the strange, remote Yorkshire village of Mortlake, which prides on keeping itself to itself. A minor incident with some local inbred youths rapidly escalates into a blood-soaked, deliriously warped nightmare for all involved. This is a demented horror film with nowt taken out."
