Between 2011 and 2014, I was affiliated with the Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages at the University of Oslo, Norway. Since 2015 I am affiliated with the Segerstedt Institute, University of Gothenburg, and together with several scholars I have conducted research and training on violent extremism.

I am currently responsible for one externally funded research project on Digital Islam across Europe: Understanding Muslims’ Participation in Online Environments. This project includes researchers from the UK, Spain, Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden. The project is funded by CHANSE and the Swedish part is funded by Forte.
