She has worked clinically with children with speech and language disorders for more than 30 years. She wass one of the project leaders of the AUDIE (AUtism Detection and Intervention in Early life) - a project which was conducted at Child Neuropsychiatry Centre, Sahlgrenska University Hospital in collaboration with the Child Health Care centers and Habilitation services in Gothenburg 2009-2011. She has authored around 40 scientifiv papers and one book chapter on communication difficulties and how they relate to neuropsychiatric disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. Carmela is currently supervising several PhD students. Her main interest in the clinic, research and teaching is language and communication development and disorders in children in various clinical groups, eg children with autism. She was the main applicant and the principal investigator in a recently issued FAS / FORTE 3-year project on \"Language ability in children with autism spectrum disorder: A population-based longitudinal study.\" In that project, the AUDIE group was followed up again when the children were of school age. The results were reported in Emilia Carlsson's thesis 2018. She was also the main applicant and the project manager in a Swedish Inheritance Fund Commission (Arvsfonden) project that started in 2013: Interventions for young children with autism: Knowledge, method development and intervention from a participatory perspective, which now is implemented at the CNC clinic. The purpose of that project was to improve initiatives for preschool children with autism in connection with the completed investigation through 1) parent education at the clinic, 2) increased support for the preschool and 3) dissemination of knowledge. Parental education for young children with autism is now included as a clinical routine after an investigation at BNK. A new 3-year FORTE project is currently ongoing \"A population-based study on language development in children after exposure to per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS)\" and an ALF-funded project \"Late language development at 2.5 years of age: language impairment, other developmental disorders and Quality of life ” . Carmela is the main applicant and PI for these ongoing projects with Charlotte Stübner and Ulrika Schachinger-Lorentzon as doctorial students.",
