        "text": "2.1 MiCId’s AR Protein Identification Algorithm\n\nMiCId’s workflow is augmented to allow for AR protein identifications. Mi-CId’s workflow contains procedures for taxonomic identifications, biomass es-timations, and protein identifications. In the workflow, it is the protein identification part that gets augmented for the purpose of AR protein identifications. Below, we summarize MiCId’s workflow and highlight the augmentations required. MiCId begins by querying a sample’s MS/MS spectra in the microorganismal database, containing protein sequences from reference and representative genomes, for the identifications of microorganismal peptides; these identified microorganismal peptides are then used for taxonomic identifications, via an iterative approach at each taxonomic level, and for relative taxa biomasses estimates within the sample [29,30]. The proteins from the reference/representative proteomes of species identified with E-value ≤ 0.01 and prior ≥ 0.01 are then assembled on-the-fly for protein identification.\n\nIn the augmented MiCId, we add to the aforementioned protein database AR proteins from an AR database. Namely, in the protein identification procedure, MiCId now queries the updated protein database (combining the protein database constructed on-the-fly and the AR database) with MS/MS spectra to identify peptides for protein and AR protein identifications. (This should not be confused with the peptide identifications needed for taxonomic identifications and biomass estimates.) MiCId uses the scoring function and statistics from the database search tool RAId_DbS [49] to score peptides and for assigning statistical confidences, E-values, to identified peptides. Identified peptides are then used as evidences for protein identifications. See Figure 1 for an overview of MiCId’s workflow.\n\nWhen performing protein identifications, proteins that share a large number of identified peptides are grouped as a cluster. To control the number of identified proteins, several existing methods [58] report those similar proteins as one. Adopting the same idea, we implemented this approach via two clustering procedure: (1) a peptide-centric clustering procedure and (2) a proteinsimilarity clustering procedure.\n\nFor the peptide-centric clustering procedure, identified proteins are sorted by the number of identified evidence peptides in descending order and the rank of a protein in the sorted list is used as that protein’s cluster index.\n\nThe peptide-centric similarity of protein β to protein α is computed as the ratio of the weighted count of shared identified peptides to the weighted count of identified peptides belonging to protein β (with πi denoting an arbitrary identified peptide) where I(πi ∈ α) is an indicator function taking value 1 (0) if πi is present (absent) in protein α and zi is the weighted count of πi given by with Ec being the E-value cutoff used to control the expected number of false positive peptides at the 5% PFD [59].\n\nOne then computes for all protein pairs (β, α) with α ranking above β. Starting with the first protein γ1 on the sorted list as the reference protein, all other lower-ranking proteins β with will have their cluster indexes changed to that of the reference protein. One then moves the reference point (from the first) to the second protein denoted by γ2, all remaining lower-ranking proteins β with will have their cluster indexes changed to that of the reference protein. The reference point is then moved to the third protein γ3 and the process continues till the reference point moves through all proteins in the list. The process is iterated for ranging from 1 to 0.5 in steps of 0.025. An exception to the above clustering rule, however, is introduced to properly underscore identified unique peptides, each of which is a subsequence to only one protein within the proteins identified. When a protein’s unique evidence peptides’ E-values yield a combined E-value ≤ E1 [60], where E1 is the E-value corresponding to having one expected false positive peptide, our method does not allow this protein to be clustered to any other reference proteins. At the end of each iteration, a protein cluster is considered as a protein and the number of unique peptides (to each protein) and their combined E-value [60] are recomputed. In the above clustering procedure, a protein that retains its original cluster index is referred to as the head of the cluster, while other proteins in the cluster members of the cluster.\n\nTo cluster highly homologous proteins that have not clustered together under the peptide-centric clustering procedure, we next invoke the protein-similarity clustering procedure within which pairwise sequence alignments by BLAST [61] are performed among the heads of protein clusters. The length normalized BLAST bit-score is defined as the BLAST bit score divided by the length of the longer of the two sequences aligned. A protein (or a cluster head) γ that has a length normalized BLAST bit-score greater than a threshold with respect to a higher ranking protein and less than 2 unique evidence peptides with E-values ≤ E1 is clustered to that higher ranking protein; hence, γ loses its status as a cluster head. This procedure is iterated with the threshold starting from highest length normalized bit-score attainable down to 1.6. The 2 unique evidence peptide rule [58,62] with the number of false positive peptides controlled at 1, E-values ≤ E1, is employed to infer the identification of highly homologous proteins.\n\nOnce the proteins have been clustered, a unified P-value is computed for all identified proteins via combining evidence peptides’ E-values, as previously described [40]. The protein with most significant unified P-value within a cluster (containing one or more proteins) is then promoted to be the head of the cluster and the other proteins in the same cluster the members of the cluster (MC). The P-value assigned to the head of a cluster is regarded as the P-value associated with that cluster.\n\nAs a consequence of the clustering procedures employed, two possible scenarios need to be considered when trying to identify AR proteins. In the first scenario, the head of an identified cluster is an AR protein. For this case, no additional step is required, and the identified protein is considered a possible AR protein. The second scenario occurs when the head of an identified protein cluster is not an AR protein. When this happens, in order to decide if the identified protein should be considered a possible AR protein, MiCId employs BLAST [61] and queries the head of the identified protein cluster in the specified AR database. The best BLAST result for each queried protein is kept and only the heads with a length-normalized BLAST bit-score ≥ 1.0 are reported. Protein cluster heads with a length-normalized BLAST bit-score ≥ 1.6 are deemed an AR protein with confidence by MiCId and the question of whether or not to regard the other reported protein cluster heads as possible AR proteins would require further investigations that are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.\n\nMiCId aims to identify AR protein candidates that are globally homologous to the AR proteins already validated (e.g., proteins in an AR database). Therefore, it is important to normalize the BLAST bit-score by the sequence length to properly quantify the quality of the global similarity. Panels A and B of Figure S1 display the histograms for the BLAST bit-scores and for the length-normalized BLAST bit-scores of the self alignment of each of the 3109 proteins taken from the ResFinder database. Comparing the histograms of panels A and B of Figure S1, one finds that the length-normalized BLAST bit-score has a much narrower score range, [1.6, 2.1], than the BLAST bitscore, [100, 1800], indicating a better choice of scores for learning a score cutoff value. While the BLAST bit-score has been shown to be more discriminative than the BLAST E-values in capturing functional homologous sequences [52], it does not scale with the length of the sequences aligned. The BLAST bitscore provides information about the quality of the local similarity between two sequences, not the global similarity [63]. The length-normalized BLAST bit-score cutoff value of 1.6 for designating an identified protein an AR protein was learned from the PFD curves generated with different cutoff values. Figure S2 shows the various PFD curves. The PFD curves generated with cutoff values ≥ 1.6 have comparable performance. To ensure that no AR protein is missed, the cutoff value of 1.6 is chosen to cover the entire score range obtained for the self alignment of all proteins in the ResFinder database.\n\n3.1 Evaluation of MiCId’s AR Protein Identification Strategy\n\nMiCId’s strategy for AR protein identifications is to first identify species in a microorganismal database and then identify AR proteins in a target protein database composed of proteins from the reference/representative proteomes of confidently identified species and AR proteins from a high-quality AR database [27,52,53]. MiCId’s strategy capitalizes on microorganismal identifications at the species level because high confidence microorganism identifications at taxonomic levels lower than species become challenging due to the lack of discriminative peptides among the ones identified [30,78] when using routinely employed high resolution data-dependent acquisition mode in the MS/MS experiment [79]. In principle, more advanced MS/MS experiments such as targeted MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) can be used for taxonomic identification below the species level by targeting peptides that are unique to taxa at lower taxonomic levels [78,80–83]. However, a limitation of such approaches is that they can only be employed for the identifications of a microorganism within a small, predetermined set of microorganisms. Another reason for employing MiCId’s strategy has to do with the trustworthiness in annotation of the taxonomic database for taxonomic levels below species [84–87]. It is important to mention that although for this study we only included the proteins from strains that are labeled as reference and representative in the microorganismal database, as these are proteins from higher-quality genomes [54,88,89], MiCId’s workflow is not limited to microorganismal database composed of only reference and representative genomes and it can perform microorganismal identifications beyond the species level.\n\nWhen, for the purpose of protein identifications, selecting a proteome as the representative for a confidently identified species, MiCId relies on a heuristic because under a given species there could be many strains and priority for each has to be established. The heuristic gives strains that are labeled as reference first priority and representative second priority. Information about reference and representative strains is taken from the RefSeq and GenBank assembly summary files downloaded from the NCBI. If there is more than one reference strain or representative strain for a given species, the strain with the larger number of proteins is selected. When a species has neither reference strain nor representative strain, the proteome from the strain, under that species, with the larger number of proteins is selected. The rule of assigning high priority to the proteomes from reference strains and representative strains is applied because these are proteome assemblies of higher quality and importance that have been curated by the NCBI staff and are to be used as anchors for the analysis of closely related proteomes within the same taxonomic group [54].\n\nFor identifications of AR proteins, the ideal target protein database would include all the protein sequences obtained directly from the strains present in the biological sample and with AR proteins unambiguously annotated. From an MS/MS based proteomics viewpoint, such a database is unattainable even if strain level identification is achieved. MS/MS based proteomics approaches relies on databases such as the ones at the NCBI to obtain protein sequences for yet-to-be-identified strains. A target protein database constructed using this procedure would still be an approximation to the ideal target protein database because the strains present in the biological sample could have acquired new proteins via horizontal gene transfer and mutations through rapid multiplication and environmental pressure [50, 51]. By including a comprehensive AR protein database in the target database, MiCId can potentially deal with the horizontal AR gene transfer; through the clustering procedure, MiCId can potentially allow the presence of few mutations occurred in the AR proteins to be identified. Overall, the target protein database used in MiCId’s strategy is not a bad approximation to the ideal target database because the proteomes for most strains under a given species shared a significant number of homologous proteins [55,56] and it includes AR proteins in a global manner, covering the possible acquisition, via horizontal gene transfer, of known AR proteins.\n\nTo evaluate MiCId’s strategy for identifying AR proteins, we prepared two sample-specific target protein databases and query them with the same MS/MS datafiles from specific samples. The first target protein database is composed of proteins from the reference proteome of the species present in the sample and AR proteins from the ResFinder database, referred to here as reference strains plus AR database (RA). The other target protein database is composed of proteins from the proteome of the true strain present in the sample and AR proteins from the ResFinder database, referred to here as correct strain plus AR database (CA). Table S4 contains the protein identifiers for each protein used to generate both versions of the sample-specific target protein databases. Plotted in panels A and B of Figure 2 are the PFD curves from querying the RA and CA databases with 62 experimental MS/MS datafiles from samples of seven strains. There are in total 14 target protein databases, 2 for each of the 7 strains that have complete genome sequence available, used in generating panels A and B of Figure 2. The PFD curves in panel A of Figure 2 shows that using the target protein databases RA and CA produced comparable PFD curves. Furthermore, the curves in panel B of of Figure 2 show that using RA and CA databases yield 131 AR protein identifications in common. What wasn’t shown is that there are 12 AR protein identifications, covering 5 AR protein families, not shared: there are 8 PDC protein family identifications and the 1 ant(3”) family identification present in the list identified using the CA database but absent from that using the RA database; on the other hand, 1 TEM family identification, 1 OXA family identification, and 1 ARR family identifications are only found using the RA database. Multiple PDC family identifications are found using both databases: 23 identifications using the CA database and 15 identifications using the RA database. The identification rate of PDC protein family in the CA database is higher because it contains the correct PDC protein PTC38756.1, that belongs to CLJ1 strain, even though this protein is not yet included in the ResFinder database. Also, in the ResFinder database the PDC family –containing only 4 PDC proteins: AAM08942.1, ACQ82815.1, ACQ82807.1, and AAM08945.1– is under-represented, making it difficult to identify the correct PDC using the ResFinder database since even the most homologous PDC protein (AAM08942.1) and the correct PDC protein (PTC38756.1) differ by more than 50 amino acid residues. The discrepancy in true positives in the other 4 AR protein families is also mainly caused by composition difference of the 2 target databases. Table S5 contains pertinent information of all the identified proteins/families in both databases. Panel C of Figure 2 shows that there are 180 AR protein family identifications at the 5% PFD level, when analyzing all the 126 MS/MS data files. Panel D of Figure 2 shows that using a E-value cutoff of 0.01 the identification of AR proteins can be controlled at the 5% PFD level. Based on this result, in order to control the false positives at around the 5% PFD level, only AR protein family identifications with E-value below 0.01 are deemed true positive with high confidence by MiCId. Table S6 has the list of all identified proteins for all the 126 MS/MS data files.\n\nAs mentioned above, a requirement for MiCId’s strategy to work is that it must have accurate species level identification. MiCId achieves accurate microorganism identification with trustworthy confidence assignments by properly computing for every identified taxon an E-value and a prior probability [29, 30]. For a quality score S, the E-value reflects the expected number of random taxa with scores the same as or better than S [40]. A taxon’s prior probability is the probability for an identified taxon to emit any evidence peptide which can also be viewed as that taxon’s protein biomass up to an overall proportionality constant as described earlier [30]. Therefore, identified taxa with small E-values and large priors are more likely to be present in the sample. As we have demonstrated, MiCId can control the PFD below 5% by calling true positives only identified taxa with E-values ≤ 0.01 and prior ≥ 0.01 [29, 30]. Also, MiCId employs an iterative approach for taxa identification at each taxonomic level; only taxa identified at the upper taxonomic level are considered for the next level identifications [29, 30]. As shown in Figure 3, when considering all identifications with E-values ≤ 1, MiCId identifies for each of the 126 samples the correct species with only 13 false positives overall. Interestingly, MiCId also identifies H. sapiens in 103 samples, B. taurus in 18 samples, and S. cerevisiae in 12 samples. H. sapiens are identified using evidence peptides from keratin proteins detected in the samples. Keratin proteins are a common contaminant to mass spectrometry experiments, usually originating from skin, hair as well as dust, clothing and latex gloves. The iden-tification of B. taurus and S. cerevisiae in some of the samples is expected as they are present in the broth medium used to grow the bacterial cultures.\n\nWhen imposing the recommended cutoffs, E-values ≤ 0.01 and prior ≥ 0.01, to control the PFD below 5%, MiCId still identifies correctly the true positive species out of each of the 126 samples. This is because, as shown in Figure 3, all the true positives are identified with much lower E-value than 0.01 and much larger prior than 0.01. However, with the recommended cutoffs, H. sapiens is identified now in 41 samples, B. taurus in 11 samples, S. cerevisiae in 11 samples, and no false positives. In terms of the prior, reflecting the taxon’s relative protein biomass, one would expect it to be very close to 1 for true positive species identified, given that the samples each is assumed to contain a single microorganism. The main reason that it deviates from 1 is because out of the 126 samples, when one only imposes E-values ≤ 1 for reporting identification, 105 samples has, in addition to the underlying microbe, identifications matching some of the following three organisms: H. sapiens, B. taurus and S. cerevisiae. For these 105 samples, as shown in panel B of Figure 3, H. sapiens contributes to the overall protein biomasses with prior values ranging from 0.00076 to 0.085 with the average value 0.016; B. taurus has prior values ranging from 0.0019 to 0.25 with the average value 0.1; S. cerevisiae has prior values ranging from 0.0011 to 0.048 with the average value 0.026. These nonzero prior values for H. sapiens, B. taurus, and S. cerevisiae cause the observed deviation of the prior value from 1 for the TP. Table S7 has the pertinent information of the identified species for each sample.\n\nIt is important to mention that the taxa identification results reported by MiCId are not filtered by using the recommended cutoff to avoid incidental false negatives. MiCId reports the complete list of identified taxa using a color-coded scheme. Identified taxa passing the recommended cutoffs, E-values ≤ 0.01 and prior ≥ 0.01, are highlighted in green for high-confidence in being a true positive; taxa identified with E-value ≤ 1 and prior ≥ 0.001, are highlighted in yellow for low-confidence in being a true positive; and taxa identified with E-value >1 or prior < 0.001 are highlighted in red for no-confidence in being a true positive.\n\n3.2 Estimate for Sensitivity of AR protein identifications via MiCId’s Workflow\n\nHaving computational methods that can correctly identify bacteria and also their AR proteins is among the most important research fronts for fighting infections. We demonstrate the usefulness of MiCId’s workflow in serving as such a computational method in this subsection and next. We use datafiles from some bacteria containing β-lactamase proteins as examples for reasons listed below. First, β-lactam antibiotics are the most prescribed class of antibiotic to fight infections globally [90]; second, in the United States, about 65% of the antibiotics prescribed are β-lactam antibiotics [91]. Of special importance in this class of antibiotic are carbapenems. Carbapenems have a broad spectrum of activity and are usually used as the last-line of the defense for seriously ill patients suspected of harboring resistant bacteria [92]. Evidently, correct identifications of carbapenem resistance can help significantly in fighting infections. Also, β-lactamase proteins can be harbored by plasmid and when this occurs they can be easily transmitted into different bacteria cells, introducing resistance to the bacteria [90,93,94].\n\nTo estimate the sensitivity of MiCId’s workflow on the identification of AR proteins, we used 27 MS/MS experimental datafiles from 6 antibiotic resistant bacterial strains (from 3 species included in the pathogen priority list of the World Health Organization [75] for antibiotics research and development), cultured with and without β-lactam antibiotics. The three β-lactam antibiotics used belong to two classes of antibiotics: belonging to the cephalosporin class is cefotaxime, and belonging to the carbapenem class are ertapenem and meropenem. Each of the bacterial strains carries between two to four predicted β-lactamase proteins and shows resistance to a variety of antibiotics [65–67,70, 95]. β-lactamase proteins for these strains were computationally predicted using ResFinder [27]. Table S8 provides a protein-centric view. This table lists for each predicted β-lactamase the strains contain it and the names of β-lactam drug classes it resists. For the purpose of estimating the sensitivity value, we view each possible β-lactamase identification per experiment as a different event. Summing the numbers of possibly identifiable β-lactamase proteins from each of the 27 experiments, one obtains a total of 88 potential true positives. This may be viewed as the maximum set of the true positives. An avid reader may ask what happens if some AR proteins, in this case β-lactamase proteins, are missed from the database. When that happens, because these proteins will never be identified, they do not contribute counts to either the numerator or the denominator while the sensitivity value is computed. Hence, for the purpose of assessing the sensitivity, one does not need to worry about AR proteins that are not included in the database. On the other hand, a predicted AR protein may never be observed because it is usually expressed in low abundance or it is not even a true protein in the corresponding microorganism’s proteome. When this is the case, it becomes inappropriate to use the maximum TP set as the TP set for the purpose of estimating the sensitivity value.\n\nWhen using all the 88 possible identifications as the TP set, one obtains a sensitivity value of 72.7% (64/88). This may be viewed as the lower bound of the sensitivity of MiCId’s workflow. If one excludes from the TP set the β-lactamases—OXA-1 in K. pneumoniae CCUG 70742, OXA-488 in P. aeruginosa CCUG 51971, and OXA-905 in P. aeruginosa CCUG 70744—that were never confidently observed in any of the corresponding experiments considered, one obtains a sensitivity value of 85.3% (64/75). This sensitivity value may be viewed as the typical sensitivity value while employing MiCId’s workflow.\n\nTable 1 shows the identification results of β-lactamase protein families for all the 27 MS/MS experiments. Displayed in Table 1 are: 64 identifications with E-value ≤ 0.01 highlighted in green and marked with a ✔, 6 identifications with 0.01 < E-value ≤ 1 highlighted in yellow and marked with a ✔, 5 cases of missed identification (while identified in other samples) marked with a ✘, and 12 cases of no identification with no marks.\n\nFor bacterial cultures exposed to an antibiotic, one would expect the bacteria to express some of its AR proteins at high levels [96, 97]. MiCId’s workflow do identify, except for OXA-1, OXA-488 and OXA-905, all the predicted β-lactamase proteins. The AR protein OXA-1 is copresent with OXA-48, CTX-15 and TEM-1 in the genome of K. pneumoniae CCUG 70742; OXA-488 is present along with OXA-35, VIM-4, and PDC-35 in the genome of P. aeruginosa CCUG 51971; and OXA-905 is copresent with PDC-8 in the genome of P. aeruginosa CCUG 70744. For K. pneumoniae CCUG 70742, MiCId’s workflow identified OXA-48 in 3 samples via OXA-232, OXA-199 and OXA-548 with the 3 proteins being highly homologous to OXA-48 and having length normalized BLAST bit-scores of 2.04, 2.05 and 1.69 respectively. For P. aeruginosa CCUG 51971 MiCId’s workflow identified OXA-35 in 5 samples with high-confidence via OXA-19, OXA-101, OXA-35, OXA-147 and OXA-240 with the 5 proteins being highly homologous to OXA-35 and having length normalized BLAST bit-scores of 2.04, 2.03, 2.05, 2.03, and 1.98 respectively. The complete list of identified AR proteins can be found in Table S6.\n\nMiCId’s identification results for P. aeruginosa CCUG 51971 and P. aeruginosa CCUG 70744 correlate well with a previous study showing that, in the model strain P. aeruginosa—PAO1 the gene of the OXA-50-like oxacillinase— is expressed at relatively low levels and is not inducible by β-lactams, while the gene of blaPDC, also expressed at relatively low levels usually, is strongly induced by β-lactams [98]. This could be the reason why MiCId did not detect OXA-488 in P. aeruginosa CCUG 51971 and OXA-905 in P. aeruginosa CCUG 70744 but detected PDC-35 in P. aeruginosa CCUG 51971, albeit only at the highest concentrations of meropenem. There are also several experimental reasons ranging from digestion enzyme, data dependent acquisition mode selection, protein expression level, as well as non-optimal liquid-chromatography separation that can be used to explain why some of the β-lactamase proteins were not identified or were not confidently identified. To further validate that the missed identification of β-lactamase proteins was not due to MICId’s inability, we analyzed all the 27 MS/MS experimental datafiles using the Proteome Discoverer software (version 2.4) and the results obtained, displayed in Table S9, are in agreement with MiCId’s results.\n\nThis assessment shows that MiCId’s workflow has a typical sensitivity value around 85% (and with a bound at about 72.7%), suggesting that it is a useful tool for the detection of AR proteins."
