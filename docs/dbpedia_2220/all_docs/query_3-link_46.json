        "text": "Abstract\n\nSiblings play a crucial and long-lasting role in family connections and relationships. However, with the older sibling transitioning out of their parental home, maintaining a close sibling relationship can be challenging, especially if siblings have a large age difference. We conducted a diary and interview study with nine families in China which have spaced siblings, to identify design opportunities for technology to better support their communication and connection needs. We contribute to the HCI community in three aspects. First, we contribute an empirical understanding of current communication patterns from distributed families with large age gap siblings in China. Second, we identify current facilitation roles, practices, and challenges regarding sibling relationships from different stakeholders’ perspectives. Last but not least, we present technological opportunities for supporting the large-gap sibling relationship, informing directions for future research and design for distributed families.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplemental Materials (3544548.3580720-supplemental-materials.zip)\n\nDownload\n\n774.85 KB\n\nMP4 File (3544548.3580720-talk-video.mp4)\n\nPre-recorded Video Presentation\n\nDownload\n\n92.56 MB\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nJoseph A Adler. 2011.
