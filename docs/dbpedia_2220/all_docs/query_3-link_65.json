        "text": "Purpose\n\nThe Nordic Council prizes aim to increase interest in culture and in collaboration on environmental issues, to recognise outstanding artistic and environmental initiatives and to raise the profile and increase the visibility of Nordic co-operation.\n\nThe prize-winning film\n\nThe winner of the prize will each year be announced during the Session of the Nordic Council. The prize is awarded to an artistically significant, Nordic-produced full-length feature film with distribution. The film must have had its premiere between 1 July 2021 and 30 June 2022. The DKK 300,000 prize will be shared equally among the screenwriter, director, and producer, underscoring how film as an art form is brought about by the close collaboration of these three main contributors.\n\nCriteria for nomination\n\nThe nominated films must have deep roots in Nordic culture, be of high artistic quality, distinguish themselves by their artistic originality, and combine and elevate the many elements of film into a compelling and holistic work of art.\n\nNational and Nordic jury\n\nEach national jury consists of three members appointed by the Nordic Council of Ministers (Ministers for Culture). The members are selected from prominent figures whose work relates analytically and critically to film.\n\nEach national jury has a three-year tenure, and the members of the national juries for 2022 are:\n\nDenmark: Heidi Hilarius-Kalkau Philipsen*, Jacob Ludvigsen, Amalie Næsby Fick\n\nFinland: Mikaela Westerlund*, Kalle Kinnunen, Kaisu Isto\n\nIceland: Jóna Finnsdóttir*, Guðrún Helga Jónasdóttir, Björn Þór Vilhjálmsson\n\nNorway: Inger Merete Hobbelstad*, Emilio Sanhueza, Anne Gjelsvik\n\nSweden: Emma Gray-Munthe*, Caroline Cowan, Gunnar Bergdahl\n\nThe Nordic jury is made up of the chairs (*) of each of the national juries."
