        "text": "The green industrial transition in the making! 🥬 Happy to host the 🇯🇵 Japanese trade delegation visit from Hitachi Energy Japan R&D department. The purpose of their visit was aimed towards learning more about the electrificationinvestments as well as the national and global investments that are establishing and taking root in the largest future industrial green hub in the region of Stockholm, in Nykvarns kommun right now. Innovative thinking, local, regional & global collarboration and being able to think truly BIG, are vital key elements to success. Exciting times and no signs of the so called recession, I'd say pretty much the opposite!😀 Big thank you Peter Alberius, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden , Anders Björklin & Anna Josefsson, Telge Nät Harald Nordby, Camilla Norrgard Sundberg, Märtha Dahlberg Nykvarns kommun. #InvestInSweden #Nykvarnskommun #RegionStockholm #HitachiEnergy #GlobalEstablishments #Industry #GreenTransition\n\nWe are at the edge of a moment in history – with the green transition race in full speed. But is Sweden, the Nordics, and Europe matching the rapid pace being set by our counterparts in the USA and Asia? I had an insightful experience at the Future Battery Forum🔋 in Berlin recently, joining over 1,200 delegates. Exciting times exploring opportunities to attract global companies to Nykvarns Kommun, which boasts 500+ hectares of prime industrial land in the heart of Region Stockholm. 🏋🏾♀️ Grateful for the chance to connect with brilliant entrepreneurs and businesses, diving deep into the world of sustainable batteries. Yet, a lingering question persists – are we falling behind our American counterparts (thanks to Biden’s I.R.A) and our Asian colleagues? 👷🏽♂️ Sweden's historical rise from poverty was powered by entrepreneurship, innovation, R&D, and collaboration. Now, as we stand on the brink of the green transition, are we in danger of becoming too entangled in regulations and bureaucratic processes? The key to progress lies in embracing the same spirit that lifted us decades ago. 💪 I believe Sweden, the Nordics, and Europe can take a lead – but only by being agile and pro-active; more rules, regulations and bureaucracy won't fuel our industries. What's essential is a resurgence of entrepreneurship, innovation, and, perhaps most crucially, accelerated collaboration/R&D, capital, and SPEED across Europe. There are already ground-breaking approaches, solutions, and innovative companies leading the way – like: Gianluca Urbano, Galvani , Björn Mårlid, Altris AB, Nemanja Mikac, ElevenEs, Stefan Goede, Munich Electrification, Eloisa D., Enerpoly Nesrine DARRAGI, Ph.D., HIVE ELECTRIC S.A.S, Florian Wolf, Innolith Kevin Chung, Henrik Kragh, Senior Material Europe, Serhan Kurt, Svolt Energy Technology Co., Ltd. What are your thoughts on how we can we match the rapid pace set by our counterparts in the USA and Asia? #FutureOfIndustry #EuropeanInnovation 💡\n\n🇳🇴 🇸🇪 Many thanks Norsk-Svenska Handelskammaren for inviting me to hold a lecture & workshops with your Talentnetwork under the banner “Inclusive leadership cross borders” together with Innovation Norway. Topics such as unconscious biases and where they actually come from, differences between equality & equity, active allyship, privileges & crunching the positive numbers of what DE&I could actually mean for an organisation. A big shoutout to my Business Sweden colleagues whose tireless efforts to boost the Swedish and Norwegian trade relations at our Oslo-office: Marie Rhoda K. , Robin Kokkonen, Anna Sundlof Eriksson, Kajsa Thor & Jessica Olsson 🙏🏽 and of course Anna Florén Svensk Norska Samarbetsfonden, our Chief Economist Lena Sellgren & Emelie Palmér (former Trade Commissioner Business Sweden) Btw, a highly recommended read from Harvard Business Review on this topic : https://lnkd.in/ds_qJJ-D Business Sweden, #GrowGlobalSales #InvestInSweden #Ledelse #Talangnetverket2023 #dei"
