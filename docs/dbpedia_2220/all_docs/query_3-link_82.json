        "meta_description": "Abstract. Exhaust emissions from shipping are a major contributor\nto particle concentrations in coastal and marine areas. Previously, the marine\nfuel sulfur content (FSC) was restricted globally to 4.5âm/m%, but the\nlimit was changed to 3.5âm/m% at the beginning of 2012 and further down\nto 0.5âm/m% in January 2020. In sulfur emission control areas (SECA), the\nlimits are stricter: the FSC restriction was originally 1.50âm/m%, but it\ndecreased to 1.00âm/m% in July 2010 and again to 0.10âm/m% in\nJanuary 2015. In this work, the effects of the FSC restrictions on particle\nnumber concentrations (PNCs) and particle\nnumber size distributions (NSDs) are studied in the\nBaltic Sea SECA. Measurements were made on a small island (UtÃ¶, Finland;\n59â46â²50âN, 21â22â²23âE) between 2007 and 2016. Ship\nplumes were extracted from the particle number size distribution data, and\nthe effects of the FSC restrictions on the observed plumes as well as on the\nambient concentrations were investigated. Altogether, 42â322 analyzable plumes were identified during the 10-year\nmeasurement period. The results showed that both changes in the FSC\nrestrictions reduced the PNCs of the plumes. The latter restriction (to 0.10âm/m% in January 2015) also decreased the ambient particle number\nconcentrations, as a significant portion of particles in the area originated\nfrom ship plumes that were diluted beyond the plume detection limits. The\noverall change in the PNCs of the plumes and ambient air was 27 and 32â%,\nrespectively, for the total FSC change from 1.50âm/m% to 0.10âm/m%. The\ndecrease in the plume particle number concentration was caused mostly by a\ndecrease in the concentration of particle sizes of between approximately 33 and 144ânm. The latter restriction also reduced the geometric mean diameter of the\nparticles, which was probably caused by the fuel type change from residual\noil to distillates during the latter restriction. The PNC was larger for the\nplumes measured at daytime than for those measured at nighttime, likely\nbecause of the photochemical aging of particles due to UV light. The\ndifference decreased with decreasing FSC, indicating that a lower FSC also has an impact on the atmospheric processing of ship plumes.",

Our study investigates BrC's imaginary refractive index (k ) using data from 12 European sites. Residential emissions are a major OA source in winter, while secondary organic aerosols (SOA) dominate in summer. We derived source-specific k values, enhancing model accuracy. This research improves understanding of BrC's climate role, emphasizing the need for source-specific constraints in atmospheric models.\n\nMeasurement Report: The effects of SECA regulations on the atmospheric SO2 concentrations in the Baltic Sea, based on long-term observations at the Finnish Utö Island\n\nAndroniki Maragkidou, Tiia GrÃ¶nholm, Laura Rautiainen, Juha Nikmo, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Timo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Timo Anttila, Lauri Laakso, and Jaakko Kukkonen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1703,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1703, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Baltic Sea's designation as a Sulphur Emission Control Area in 2006, with subsequent regulations, significantly reduced sulphur emissions from shipping. Our study analyzed air quality data from 2003 to 2020 at Utö island and employed modelling, showing a continuous decrease in SO2 concentrations since 2003 and evidencing, thus, the effectiveness of such regulations in improving air quality. It also underscored the importance of long-term, high-resolution monitoring at remote marine sites.\n\nIndicators of Global Climate Change 2023: annual update of key indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence\n\nPiers M.

It is designed to give an authoritative estimate of global warming to date and its causes. We find that in 2023, global warming reached 1.3 °C and is increasing at over 0.2 °C per decade. This is caused by all-time-high greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nEstimating errors in vehicle secondary aerosol production factors due to oxidation flow reactor response time\n\nPauli Simonen, Miikka Dal Maso, Pinja Prauda, Anniina Hoilijoki, Anette Karppinen, Pekka Matilainen, Panu Karjalainen, and Jorma Keskinen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 3219–3236, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3219-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3219-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSecondary aerosol is formed in the atmosphere from gaseous emissions. Oxidation flow reactors used in secondary aerosol research do not immediately respond to changes in the inlet concentration of gases because of their broad transfer functions. This may result in incorrect secondary aerosol production factors determined for vehicles. We studied the extent of possible errors and found that oxidation flow reactors with faster responses result in smaller errors.\n\nComparison of size distribution and electrical particle sensor measurement methods for particle lung deposited surface area (LDSAal) in ambient measurements with varying conditions\n\nTeemu LepistÃ¶, Henna Lintusaari, Laura Salo, Ville Silvonen, Luis M. F. Barreira, Jussi Hoivala, Lassi Markkula, Jarkko V. Niemi, Jakub Ondracek, Kimmo TeinilÃ¤, Hanna E. Manninen, Sanna Saarikoski, Hilkka Timonen, Miikka Dal Maso, and Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶\n\nAerosol Research Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2024-13,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2024-13, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for AR\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe performances of different particle lung deposited surface area (LDSAal) measurement methods (Partector, ELPI+, SMPS/DMPS) were compared in ambient conditions. As LDSAal is a health-relevant metric and rather easy to utilise in air quality monitoring, it is crucial to know how the different methods agree as there are clear differences in their operation. In all, comparison of different methods can be complicated, but, still, the methods agree rather well in terms of local pollution (<400 nm).\n\nModeling Inertial Deposition of Aerosol Particles in Geometrically Complicated Flow Systems Using Finite Element Methods\n\nPatrick Grahn and Joel Kuula\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1242,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1242, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Measurement Techniques (AMT).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA three-dimensional finite-element based method was used to calculate inertial deposition loss of aerosol particles in flow systems. The method was validated by comparing to known results published in literature. Loss in a geometrically complicated aerosol measurement instrument was calculated and compared to measurements. The method pinpoints the physical locations where particles are lost, which is helpful for improving the performance of aerosol instruments.\n\nGlobal anthropogenic emissions (CAMS-GLOB-ANT) for the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service simulations of air quality forecasts and reanalyses\n\nAntonin Soulie, Claire Granier, Sabine Darras, Nicolas Zilbermann, Thierno Doumbia, Marc Guevara, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Sekou Keita, Cathy Liousse, Monica Crippa, Diego Guizzardi, Rachel Hoesly, and Steven J. Smith\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 2261–2279, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-2261-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-2261-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnthropogenic emissions are the result of transportation, power generation, industrial, residential and commercial activities as well as waste treatment and agriculture practices. This work describes the new CAMS-GLOB-ANT gridded inventory of 2000–2023 anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The methodology to generate the emissions is explained and the datasets are analysed and compared with publicly available global and regional inventories for selected world regions.\n\nShipping and algae emissions have a major impact on ambient air mixing ratios of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and methanethiol on UtÃ¶ Island in the Baltic Sea\n\nHeidi HellÃ©n, Rostislav Kouznetsov, Kaisa Kraft, Jukka SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, Mika Vestenius, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Lauri Laakso, and Hannele Hakola\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4717–4731, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4717-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4717-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMixing ratios of C2-C5 NMHCs and methanethiol were measured on an island in the Baltic Sea using an in situ gas chromatograph. Shipping emissions were found to be an important source of ethene, ethyne, propene, and benzene. High summertime mixing ratios of methanethiol and dependence of mixing ratios on seawater temperature and height indicated the biogenic origin to possibly be phytoplankton or macroalgae. These emissions may have a strong impact on SO2 production and new particle formation.\n\nApplicability of small-scale black carbon sensors to explore high resolution spatial variability of ambient black carbon\n\nTapio Elomaa, Krista Luoma, Sami Harni, Aki Virkkula, Hilkka Timonen, and Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤\n\nAerosol Research Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2024-12,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2024-12, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for AR\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBlack Carbon (BC) is a pollutant from combustion that affects the climate and is harmful to health. We tested four different small BC sensors with a reference in Helsinki. The sensors compared well with the reference. As a sensor network they were able to capture differences in BC. Changes in temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) caused error in the measurement. To reduce the effects of T and RH on BC sensors, more robust boxes should be developed or corrections should be applied.\n\nIce-nucleating particles active below -24 °C in a Finnish boreal forest and their relationship to bioaerosols\n\nFranziska Vogel, Michael P. Adams, Larissa Lacher, Polly Foster, Grace C. E. Porter, Barbara Bertozzi, Kristina HÃ¶hler, Julia Schneider, Tobias Schorr, Nsikanabasi S. Umo, Jens Nadolny, ZoÃ© Brasseur, Paavo HeikkilÃ¤, Erik S.

Murray\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-853,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-853, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrimary ice formation in clouds strongly influences their properties, hence it is important to understand the sources of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) and their variability. We present 2 months INP measurements in a Finnish boreal forest using a new semi-autonomous INP counting device based on gas expansion. These results show strong variability in INP concentrations, and we present a case that the INP we observe are, at least some of the time, of biological origin.\n\nAir pollution emission inventory using national high-resolution spatial parameters for the Nordic countries and analysis of PM2.5 spatial distribution for road transport and machinery and off-road sectors\n\nVille-Veikko Paunu, Niko Karvosenoja, David Segersson, Susana LÃ³pez-Aparicio, Ole-Kenneth Nielsen, Marlene Schmidt Plejdrup, Throstur Thorsteinsson, Dam Thanh Vo, Jeroen Kuenen, Hugo Denier van der Gon, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, JÃ¸rgen Brandt, and Camilla Geels\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 1453–1474, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-1453-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-1453-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAir pollution is an important cause of adverse health effects, even in Nordic countries. To assess their health impacts, emission inventories with high spatial resolution are needed. We studied how national data and methods for the spatial distribution of the emissions compare to a European level inventory. For road transport the methods are well established, but for machinery and off-road emissions the current recommendations for the spatial distribution of these emissions should be improved.\n\nCharacterization of the Vaporization Inlet for Aerosols (VIA) for online measurements of particulate highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs)\n\nJian Zhao, Valter Mickwitz, Yuanyuan Luo, Ella HÃ¤kkinen, Frans Graeffe, Jiangyi Zhang, Hilkka Timonen, Manjula Canagaratna, Jordan E. Krechmer, Qi Zhang, Markku Kulmala, Juha Kangasluoma, Douglas Worsnop, and Mikael Ehn\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 1527–1543, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-1527-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-1527-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic aerosol constitutes a significant portion of atmospheric fine particles but is less characterized due to its vast number of constituents. Recently, we developed a system for online measurements of particle-phase highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs). In this work, we systematically characterized the system, developed a new unit to enhance its performance, and demonstrated the essential role of thermograms in inferring volatility and quantifying HOMs in organic aerosols.\n\nImpact of desert dust on new particle formation events and the cloud condensation nuclei budget in dust-influenced areas\n\nJuan AndrÃ©s Casquero-Vera, Daniel PÃ©rez-RamÃ­rez, Hassan Lyamani, Fernando Rejano, Andrea Casans, Gloria Titos, Francisco JosÃ© Olmo, Lubna Dada, Simo Hakala, Tareq Hussein, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Pauli Paasonen, Antti HyvÃ¤rinen, NoemÃ­ PÃ©rez, Xavier Querol, Sergio RodrÃ­guez, Nikos Kalivitis, Yenny GonzÃ¡lez, Mansour A. Alghamdi, Veli-Matti Kerminen, AndrÃ©s Alastuey, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Lucas Alados-Arboledas\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15795–15814, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15795-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15795-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we present the first study of the effect of mineral dust on the inhibition/promotion of new particle formation (NPF) events in different dust-influenced areas. Unexpectedly, we show that the occurrence of NPF events is highly frequent during mineral dust outbreaks, occurring even during extreme dust outbreaks. We also show that the occurrence of NPF events during mineral dust outbreaks significantly affects the potential cloud condensation nuclei budget.\n\nSource apportionment of particle number size distribution at the street canyon and urban background sites\n\nSami Daniel Harni, Minna Aurtela, Sanna Saarikoski, Jarkko Niemi, Harri Portin, Hanna Manninen, Ville Leinonen, Pasi Aalto, Phil Hopke, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, and Hilkka Timonen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2428,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2428, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study particle number size distribution data was used in a novel way in positive matrix factorization analysis to find aerosol source profiles in the area. Measurements were made in Helsinki at a street canyon and urban background sites between February 2015 and June 2019. Five different aerosol sources were identified. These sources underline the significance of traffic-related emissions in urban environments despite recent improvements in emission reduction technologies.\n\nInfluence of anthropogenic emissions on the composition of highly oxygenated organic molecules in Helsinki: a street canyon and urban background station comparison\n\nMagdalena Okuljar, Olga Garmash, Miska Olin, Joni Kalliokoski, Hilkka Timonen, Jarkko V.

Manninen, Mikko SipilÃ¤, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Markku Kulmala, Miikka Dal Maso, and Mikael Ehn\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 12965–12983, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12965-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12965-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHighly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) form secondary organic aerosol that affects air quality and health. In this study, we demonstrate that in a moderately polluted city with abundant vegetation, the composition of HOMs is largely controlled by the effect of NOx on the biogenic volatile organic compound oxidation. Comparing the results from two nearby stations, we show that HOM composition and formation pathways can change considerably within small distances in urban environments.\n\nRapid saturation of cloud water adjustments to shipping emissions\n\nPeter Manshausen, Duncan Watson-Parris, Matthew W. Christensen, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 12545–12555, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol from burning fuel changes cloud properties, e.g., the number of droplets and the content of water. Here, we study how clouds respond to different amounts of shipping aerosol. Droplet numbers increase linearly with increasing aerosol over a broad range until they stop increasing, while the amount of liquid water always increases, independently of emission amount. These changes in cloud properties can make them reflect more or less sunlight, which is important for the earth's climate.\n\nA multimodel evaluation of the potential impact of shipping on particle species in the Mediterranean Sea\n\nLea Fink, Matthias Karl, Volker Matthias, Sonia Oppo, Richard Kranenburg, Jeroen Kuenen, Sara JutterstrÃ¶m, Jana Moldanova, Elisa MajamÃ¤ki, and Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 10163–10189, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10163-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10163-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a heavily trafficked shipping area, and air quality monitoring stations in numerous cities along the Mediterranean coast have detected high levels of air pollutants originating from shipping emissions. The current study investigates how existing restrictions on shipping-related emissions to the atmosphere ensure compliance with legislation. Focus was laid on fine particles and particle species, which were simulated with five different chemical transport models.\n\nExplaining apparent particle shrinkage related to new particle formation events in western Saudi Arabia does not require evaporation\n\nSimo Hakala, Ville Vakkari, Heikki Lihavainen, Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, Kimmo Neitola, Jenni Kontkanen, Veli-Matti Kerminen, Markku Kulmala, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Tareq Hussein, Mamdouh I. Khoder, Mansour A. Alghamdi, and Pauli Paasonen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9287–9321, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9287-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9287-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThings are not always as they first seem in ambient aerosol measurements. Observations of decreasing particle sizes are often interpreted as resulting from particle evaporation. We show that such observations can counterintuitively be explained by particles that are constantly growing in size. This requires one to account for the previous movements of the observed air. Our explanation implies a larger number of larger particles, meaning more significant effects of aerosols on climate and health.\n\nEditorial: Aerosol Research â a new diamond open-access journal covering the breadth of aerosol science and technology\n\nJonas Elm, AladÃ¡r Czitrovszky, Andreas Held, Annele Virtanen, Astrid Kiendler-Scharr, Benjamin J.

Their highly variable spectral light absorption properties need to be monitored in the field. Commonly used methods show measurement artefacts that are difficult to correct. We introduce a new instrument that is based on the photoacoustic effect. Long-term operation in the Finnish Arctic demonstrates the applicability of the new instrument for unattended light absorption monitoring.\n\nOnline measurement of highly oxygenated compounds from organic aerosol\n\nElla HÃ¤kkinen, Jian Zhao, Frans Graeffe, Nicolas FaurÃ©, Jordan E. Krechmer, Douglas Worsnop, Hilkka Timonen, Mikael Ehn, and Juha Kangasluoma\n\nAtmos. Meas.

Knowledge of their transformations and fate after condensing into the particle phase has been limited by the lack of suitable detection techniques. Here, we present an online method for measuring highly oxygenated compounds from organic aerosol. We evaluate the performance of the method and demonstrate that the method is applicable to different organic species.\n\nAssessing the climate and air quality effects of future aerosol mitigation in India using a global climate model combined with statistical downscaling\n\nTuuli Miinalainen, Harri Kokkola, Antti Lipponen, Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, Vijay Kumar Soni, Kari E. J. Lehtinen, and Thomas KÃ¼hn\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We used a machine learning downscaling approach to bias-correct the PM2.5 values obtained from the global model for the Indian megacity New Delhi. Our results indicate that aerosol mitigation could result in both improved air quality and less radiative heating for India.\n\nCharacterization of volatile organic compounds and submicron organic aerosol in a traffic environment\n\nSanna Saarikoski, Heidi HellÃ©n, Arnaud P.

Anthropogenic VOCs (aVOCs) were clearly higher than biogenic VOCs (bVOCs), but bVOCs produced a larger portion of oxidation products. OA consisted mostly of oxygenated OA, representing secondary OA (SOA). SOA was partly associated with bVOCs, but it was also related to long-range transport. Primary OA originated mostly from traffic.\n\nPotential impact of shipping on air pollution in the Mediterranean region â a multimodel evaluation: comparison of photooxidants NO2 and O3\n\nLea Fink, Matthias Karl, Volker Matthias, Sonia Oppo, Richard Kranenburg, Jeroen Kuenen, Jana Moldanova, Sara JutterstrÃ¶m, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, and Elisa MajamÃ¤ki\n\nAtmos.

The review also examines how air pollution management needs to adapt to new challenges and makes recommendations to guide the direction for future air quality research within the wider community and to provide support for policy.\n\nObservations of particle number size distributions and new particle formation in six Indian locations\n\nMathew Sebastian, Sobhan Kumar Kompalli, Vasudevan Anil Kumar, Sandhya Jose, S. Suresh Babu, Govindan Pandithurai, Sachchidanand Singh, Rakesh K. Hooda, Vijay K. Soni, Jeffrey R. Pierce, Ville Vakkari, Eija Asmi, Daniel M. Westervelt, Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, and Vijay P. Kanawade\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 4491–4508, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-4491-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-4491-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCharacteristics of particle number size distributions and new particle formation in six locations in India were analyzed. New particle formation occurred frequently during the pre-monsoon (spring) season and it significantly modulates the shape of the particle number size distributions. The contribution of newly formed particles to cloud condensation nuclei concentrations was ~3 times higher in urban locations than in mountain background locations.\n\nAn extensive data set for in situ microphysical characterization of low-level clouds in a Finnish sub-Arctic site\n\nKonstantinos Matthaios Doulgeris, Heikki Lihavainen, Anti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, Veli-Matti Kerminen, and David Brus\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 637–649, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-637-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-637-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe produced and summarized data sets obtained from two cloud ground-based spectrometers (CAPS and FSSP-100 ground setups) during 8 years of Pallas Cloud Experiment campaigns conducted in autumn from 2004 until 2019 along with several meteorological variables. The campaigns took place in the Finnish sub-Arctic region in a clear environment in temperatures that were usually below zero. This data set provides a helpful contribution to cloud microphysics processes.\n\nInput-adaptive linear mixed-effects model for estimating alveolar lung-deposited surface area (LDSA) using multipollutant datasets\n\nPak Lun Fung, Martha A. Zaidan, Jarkko V. Niemi, Erkka Saukko, Hilkka Timonen, Anu Kousa, Joel Kuula, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, Ari Karppinen, Sasu Tarkoma, Markku Kulmala, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Tareq Hussein\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1861–1882, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1861-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1861-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an input-adaptive mixed-effects model, which was automatised to select the best combination of input variables, including up to three fixed effect variables and three time indictors as random effect variables. We tested the model to estimate lung-deposited surface area (LDSA), which correlates well with human health. The results show the inclusion of time indicators improved the sensitivity and the accuracy of the model so that it could serve as a network of virtual sensors.\n\nCAMS-REG-v4: a state-of-the-art high-resolution European emission inventory for air quality modelling\n\nJeroen Kuenen, Stijn Dellaert, Antoon Visschedijk, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Ingrid Super, and Hugo Denier van der Gon\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 491–515, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-491-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-491-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents an 18-year time series for anthropogenic emissions for the main air pollutants in Europe, distinguishing 15 main source categories. It provides a complete overview of emissions to air and is designed to support air quality modelling. The data build where possible on official country total emissions used in the policy processes, but where necessary alternative data were used. The emission data are spatially distributed at high resolution (~ 6 km x 6 km) in a consistent way.\n\nComparing black-carbon- and aerosol-absorption-measuring instruments â a new system using lab-generated soot coated with controlled amounts of secondary organic matter\n\nDaniel M. Kalbermatter, GriÅ¡a MoÄnik, Luka Drinovec, Bradley Visser, Jannis RÃ¶hrbein, Matthias Oscity, Ernest Weingartner, Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, and Konstantina Vasilatou\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 561–572, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-561-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-561-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoot particles with varying amounts of secondary organic matter coating were generated and used to compare a series of aerosol-absorption-measuring instruments: filter-based and photoacoustic instruments as well as photo-thermal interferometers. Significant deviations in the response of the instruments were observed depending on the amount of secondary organic coating. The system can be used for the inter-comparison and characterisation of instruments.\n\nContribution of traffic-originated nanoparticle emissions to regional and local aerosol levels\n\nMiska Olin, David Patoulias, Heino Kuuluvainen, Jarkko V. Niemi, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, Spyros N. Pandis, Ilona Riipinen, and Miikka Dal Maso\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1131–1148, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1131-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1131-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn emission factor particle size distribution was determined from the measurements at an urban traffic site. It was used in updating a pre-existing emission inventory, and regional modeling was performed after the update. Emission inventories typically underestimate nanoparticle emissions due to challenges in determining them with high certainty. This update reveals that the simulated aerosol levels have previously been underestimated especially for urban areas and for sub-50 nm particles.\n\nHuman impacts and their interactions in the Baltic Sea region\n\nMarcus Reckermann, Anders Omstedt, Tarmo Soomere, Juris Aigars, Naveed Akhtar, Magdalena BeÅdowska, Jacek BeÅdowski, Tom Cronin, MichaÅ Czub, Margit Eero, Kari Petri HyytiÃ¤inen, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Anders Kiessling, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Karol KuliÅski, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, Michelle McCrackin, H. E. Markus Meier, Sonja Oberbeckmann, Kevin Parnell, Cristian Pons-Seres de Brauwer, Anneli Poska, Jarkko Saarinen, Beata Szymczycha, Emma Undeman, Anders WÃ¶rman, and Eduardo Zorita\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1–80, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs part of the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports (BEAR), we present an inventory and discussion of different human-induced factors and processes affecting the environment of the Baltic Sea region and their interrelations. Some are naturally occurring and modified by human activities, others are completely human-induced, and they are all interrelated to different degrees. The findings from this study can largely be transferred to other comparable marginal and coastal seas in the world.\n\nMeasurement report: Characterization of uncertainties in fluxes and fuel sulfur content from ship emissions in the Baltic Sea\n\nJari Walden, Liisa Pirjola, Tuomas Laurila, Juha Hatakka, Heidi Pettersson, Tuomas Walden, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Harri Nordlund, Toivo Truuts, Miika Meretoja, and Kimmo K. Kahma\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18175–18194, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18175-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18175-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShip emissions play an important role in the deposition of gaseous compounds and nanoparticles (Ntot), affecting climate, human health (especially in coastal areas), and eutrophication. Micrometeorological methods showed that ship emissions were mainly responsible for the deposition of Ntot, whereas they only accounted for a minor proportion of CO2 deposition. An uncertainty analysis applied to the fluxes and fuel sulfur content results demonstrated the reliability of the results.\n\nEstimates of mass absorption cross sections of black carbon for filter-based absorption photometers in the Arctic\n\nSho Ohata, Tatsuhiro Mori, Yutaka Kondo, Sangeeta Sharma, Antti HyvÃ¤rinen, Elisabeth Andrews, Peter Tunved, Eija Asmi, John Backman, Henri Servomaa, Daniel Veber, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Stergios Vratolis, Radovan Krejci, Paul Zieger, Makoto Koike, Yugo Kanaya, Atsushi Yoshida, Nobuhiro Moteki, Yongjing Zhao, Yutaka Tobo, Junji Matsushita, and Naga Oshima\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 6723–6748, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6723-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6723-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReliable values of mass absorption cross sections (MACs) of black carbon (BC) are required to determine mass concentrations of BC at Arctic sites using different types of filter-based absorption photometers. We successfully estimated MAC values for these instruments through comparison with independent measurements of BC by a continuous soot monitoring system called COSMOS. These MAC values are consistent with each other and applicable to study spatial and temporal variation in BC in the Arctic.\n\nSources of black carbon at residential and traffic environments obtained by two source apportionment methods\n\nSanna Saarikoski, Jarkko V. Niemi, Minna Aurela, Liisa Pirjola, Anu Kousa, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, and Hilkka Timonen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 14851–14869, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14851-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14851-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the main sources of black carbon (BC) at two urban environments. The largest fraction of BC originated from biomass burning at the residential site (38 %) and from vehicular emissions (57 %) in the street canyon. Also, a significant fraction of BC was associated with urban background or long-range transport. The data are needed by modelers and authorities when assessing climate and air quality impact of BC as well as directing the emission legislation and mitigation actions.\n\nProjections of shipping emissions and the related impact on air pollution and human health in the Nordic region\n\nCamilla Geels, Morten Winther, Camilla Andersson, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, JÃ¸rgen Brandt, Lise M. Frohn, Ulas Im, Wing Leung, and Jesper H. Christensen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 12495–12519, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12495-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12495-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we set up new shipping emissions scenarios and use two chemistry transport models and a health assessment model to assess the development of air quality and related health impacts in the Nordic region. Shipping alone is associated with about 850 premature deaths during present-day conditions, decreasing to approximately 550–600 cases in the 2050 scenarios.\n\nAbsorption instruments inter-comparison campaign at the Arctic Pallas station\n\nEija Asmi, John Backman, Henri Servomaa, Aki Virkkula, Maria I. Gini, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Thomas MÃ¼ller, Sho Ohata, Yutaka Kondo, and Antti HyvÃ¤rinen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5397–5413, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5397-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5397-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbsorbing aerosols are warming the planet and accurate measurements of their concentrations in pristine environments are needed. We applied eight different absorbing-aerosol measurement methods in a field campaign at the Arctic Pallas station. The filter-based techniques were found to be the most sensitive to detect the minuscule amounts of black carbon present, showing a 40 % agreement between them. Our results help to reduce uncertainties in absorbing aerosol measurements.\n\nMediterranean nascent sea spray organic aerosol and relationships with seawater biogeochemistry\n\nEvelyn Freney, Karine Sellegri, Alessia Nicosia, Leah R.

We investigated the contribution of traffic and new particle formation to particles with a diameter between 1 and 800 nm. We found that during spring traffic does not dominate the particles smaller than 3 nm at either of the stations.\n\nModelling of discharges from Baltic Sea shipping\n\nJukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Lasse Johansson, Magda Wilewska-Bien, Lena Granhag, Erik Ytreberg, K. Martin Eriksson, Daniel Yngsell, Ida-Maja HassellÃ¶v, Kerstin Magnusson, Urmas Raudsepp, Ilja Maljutenko, Hulda Winnes, and Jana Moldanova\n\nOcean Sci., 17, 699–728, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-17-699-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-17-699-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis modelling study describes a methodology for describing pollutant discharges from ships to the sea. The pilot area used is the Baltic Sea area and discharges of bilge, ballast, sewage, wash water as well as stern tube oil are reported for the year 2012. This work also reports the release of SOx scrubber effluents. This technique may be used by ships to comply with tight sulfur limits inside Emission Control Areas, but it also introduces a new pollutant stream from ships to the sea.\n\nIn-depth characterization of submicron particulate matter inter-annual variations at a street canyon site in northern Europe\n\nLuis M. F. Barreira, Aku Helin, Minna Aurela, Kimmo TeinilÃ¤, Milla Friman, Leena Kangas, Jarkko V. Niemi, Harri Portin, Anu Kousa, Liisa Pirjola, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, Sanna Saarikoski, and Hilkka Timonen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Overall, the results increased knowledge of the variability of PM1 concentration, composition, and sources in a traffic site and the implications for urban air quality. The investigation of pollution episodes showed that both local and long-range-transported pollutants can still cause elevated PM1 and PM2.5 concentrations in northern Europe.\n\nShift in seasonal snowpack melt-out date due to light-absorbing particles at a high-altitude site in Central Himalaya\n\nJohan StrÃ¶m, Jonas Svensson, Henri Honkanen, Eija Asmi, Nathaniel B. Dkhar, Shresth Tayal, Ved P. Sharma, Rakesh Hooda, Outi Meinander, Matti LeppÃ¤ranta, Hans-Werner Jacobi, Heikki Lihavainen, and Antti HyvÃ¤rinen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-158,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-158, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow darkening in the Himalaya results from the deposition of different particles. Here we assess the change in the seasonal snow cover duration due to the presence of mineral dust and black carbon particles in the snow of Sunderdhunga valley, Central Himalaya, India. With the use of in situ weather station data, the snow melt-out date is estimated to be shifted ~13 days earlier due to the presence of the particles in the snow.\n\nThe seasonal cycle of ice-nucleating particles linked to the abundance of biogenic aerosol in boreal forests\n\nJulia Schneider, Kristina HÃ¶hler, Paavo HeikkilÃ¤, Jorma Keskinen, Barbara Bertozzi, Pia Bogert, Tobias Schorr, Nsikanabasi Silas Umo, Franziska Vogel, ZoÃ© Brasseur, Yusheng Wu, Simo Hakala, Jonathan Duplissy, Dmitri Moisseev, Markku Kulmala, Michael P. Adams, Benjamin J. Murray, Kimmo Korhonen, Liqing Hao, Erik S. Thomson, Dimitri CastarÃ¨de, Thomas Leisner, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Ottmar MÃ¶hler\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3899–3918, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3899-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3899-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy triggering the formation of ice crystals, ice-nucleating particles (INP) strongly influence cloud formation. Continuous, long-term measurements are needed to characterize the atmospheric INP variability. Here, a first long-term time series of INP spectra measured in the boreal forest for more than 1 year is presented, showing a clear seasonal cycle. It is shown that the seasonal dependency of INP concentrations and prevalent INP types is driven by the abundance of biogenic aerosol.\n\nDeposition of light-absorbing particles in glacier snow of the Sunderdhunga Valley, the southern forefront of the central Himalayas\n\nJonas Svensson, Johan StrÃ¶m, Henri Honkanen, Eija Asmi, Nathaniel B. Dkhar, Shresth Tayal, Ved P. Sharma, Rakesh Hooda, Matti LeppÃ¤ranta, Hans-Werner Jacobi, Heikki Lihavainen, and Antti HyvÃ¤rinen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Through measurements of the constituents in glacier snow pits from the Indian Himalayas our investigations show that different snow layers display striking similarities. These similarities can be characterized by a deposition constant. Our results further indicate that mineral dust can be responsible for the majority of light absorption in the snow in this part of the Himalayas.\n\nSpatiotemporal variation and trends in equivalent black carbon in the Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland\n\nKrista Luoma, Jarkko V.

The seasonal and diurnal variations in the black carbon concentration were associated with local emissions from traffic and residential wood burning. The study observed decreasing trends in the black carbon concentration and associated them with decreases in traffic emissions.\n\nEstimates of mass absorption cross sections of black carbon for filter-based absorption photometers in the Arctic\n\nSho Ohata, Tatsuhiro Mori, Yutaka Kondo, Sangeeta Sharma, Antti HyvÃ¤rinen, Elisabeth Andrews, Peter Tunved, Eija Asmi, John Backman, Henri Servomaa, Daniel Veber, Makoto Koike, Yugo Kanaya, Atsushi Yoshida, Nobuhiro Moteki, Yongjing Zhao, Junji Matsushita, and Naga Oshima\n\nAtmos.

Here, the performance of an aerosol module within the PALM model to simulate the detailed horizontal and vertical distribution of aerosol particles is studied. Further, sensitivity to the meteorological and aerosol boundary conditions is assessed using both model and observation data. The horizontal distribution is sensitive to the wind speed and stability, and the vertical to the wind direction.\n\nCITYZER observation network and data delivery system\n\nWalter Schmidt, Ari-Matti Harri, Timo Nousiainen, Harri Hohti, Lasse Johansson, Olli OjanperÃ¤, Erkki Viitala, Jarkko Niemi, Jani Turpeinen, Erkka Saukko, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, and Pekka Lahti\n\nGeosci.

Chem. Phys., 20, 11399–11422, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11399-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11399-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have calculated the effects of air pollution in Europe from shipping on levels of PM2.5 and ozone and depositions of oxidised nitrogen and sulfur from individual sea areas and from all global shipping. Model results are shown for Europe as a whole but also focusing on select, mainly coastal, countries. Calculations are made using 2017 emissions supplemented by calculations reducing sulfur emissions from ships by about 80 % following the implementation of the 2020 global sulfur cap.\n\nModel for leisure boat activities and emissions â implementation for the Baltic Sea\n\nLasse Johansson, Erik Ytreberg, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Erik Fridell, K. Martin Eriksson, Maria LagerstrÃ¶m, Ilja Maljutenko, Urmas Raudsepp, Vivian Fischer, and Eva Roth\n\nOcean Sci., 16, 1143–1163, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-16-1143-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-16-1143-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVery little is currently known about the activities and emissions of private leisure boats. To change this, a new model was created (BEAM). The model was used for the Baltic Sea to estimate leisure boat emissions, also considering antifouling paint leach. When compared to commercial shipping, the modeled leisure boat emissions were seen to be surprisingly large for some pollutant species, and these emissions were heavily concentrated on coastal inhabited areas during summer and early autumn.\n\nIn situ cloud ground-based measurements in the Finnish sub-Arctic: intercomparison of three cloud spectrometer setups\n\nKonstantinos-Matthaios Doulgeris, Mika Komppula, Sami Romakkaniemi, Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, Veli-Matti Kerminen, and David Brus\n\nAtmos.

The measurements were conducted during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) in 2013, in the Finnish sub-Arctic region at Sammaltunturi station. The main meteorological parameters influencing the spectrometers' performance was the wind direction. Final recommendations and our view on the main limitations of each spectrometer ground setup are presented.\n\nA global analysis of climate-relevant aerosol properties retrieved from the network of Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) near-surface observatories\n\nPaolo Laj, Alessandro Bigi, ClÃ©mence Rose, Elisabeth Andrews, Cathrine Lund Myhre, Martine Collaud Coen, Yong Lin, Alfred Wiedensohler, Michael Schulz, John A.

Data from almost 90 stations worldwide are reported for a reference year, 2017, providing a unique and very robust view of the variability of these variables worldwide. Current gaps in the GAW network are analysed and requirements for the Global Climate Monitoring System are proposed.\n\nShipping emissions in the Iberian Peninsula and the impacts on air quality\n\nRafael A. O. Nunes, Maria C. M. Alvim-Ferraz, Fernando G. Martins, FÃ¡tima Calderay-Cayetano, Vanessa DurÃ¡n-Grados, Juan Moreno-GutiÃ©rrez, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Hanna Hannuniemi, and Sofia I. V.

Results showed increased levels of SO2 and NO2 near port areas, as well as of O3, sulfate, PM2.5, and PM10 over the Iberian Peninsula coastline due to shipping emissions. To study mitigation measures, application is crucial.\n\nOverview: Integrative and Comprehensive Understanding on Polar Environments (iCUPE) â concept and initial results\n\nTuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Ella-Maria Duplissy, Ksenia Tabakova, Julia Schmale, Barbara AltstÃ¤dter, Gerard Ancellet, Mikhail Arshinov, Yurii Balin, Urs Baltensperger, Jens Bange, Alison Beamish, Boris Belan, Antoine Berchet, Rossana Bossi, Warren R.

Here we summarize initial results from our integrative project exploring the Arctic environment and pollution to deliver data products, metrics, and indicators for stakeholders.\n\nThe impact of ship emissions on air quality and human health in the Gothenburg area â Part 1: 2012 emissions\n\nLin Tang, Martin O. P. Ramacher, Jana MoldanovÃ¡, Volker Matthias, Matthias Karl, Lasse Johansson, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Katarina Yaramenka, Armin Aulinger, and Malin Gustafsson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 7509–7530, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7509-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7509-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effects of shipping emissions on air quality and health in the harbour city of Gothenburg were simulated for 2012 with coupled regional and city-scale chemistry transport models. The results show that contributions of shipping to exposure and health impacts from particulate matter and NO2 are significant and that shipping-related exposure to PM is dominated by emissions from regional shipping outside the city domain and is larger than exposure related to emissions from local road traffic.\n\nCondensation/immersion mode ice-nucleating particles in a boreal environment\n\nMikhail Paramonov, Saskia Drossaart van Dusseldorp, Ellen Gute, Jonathan P. D. Abbatt, Paavo HeikkilÃ¤, Jorma Keskinen, Xuemeng Chen, Krista Luoma, Liine Heikkinen, Liqing Hao, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Zamin A. Kanji\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 6687–6706, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6687-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6687-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-nucleating particle (INP) measurements were performed in the boreal environment of southern Finland in the winter–spring of 2018. It was found that no single parameter could be used to predict the INP number concentration at the measurement location during the examined time period. It was also not possible to identify physical and chemical properties of ambient INPs despite the complexity of the instrumental set-up. Therefore, this paper addresses the necessity for future INP measurements.\n\nLaboratory evaluation of particle-size selectivity of optical low-cost particulate matter sensors\n\nJoel Kuula, Timo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Minna Aurela, Kimmo TeinilÃ¤, Samu Varjonen, Ãscar GonzÃ¡lez, and Hilkka Timonen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 2413–2423, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-2413-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-2413-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nParticle-size-dependent detection ranges of low-cost particulate matter sensors were evaluated in a laboratory experiment. Six different sensor models were evaluated altogether. The results showed that none of the sensor models adhered to the technical specifications provided by the manufacturers, and thus a high risk of sensor misuse is posed. It is paramount that the limitations regarding the particle size discrimination of low-cost sensors are acknowledged properly.\n\nTraffic-originated nanocluster emission exceeds H2SO4-driven photochemical new particle formation in an urban area\n\nMiska Olin, Heino Kuuluvainen, Minna Aurela, Joni Kalliokoski, Niina Kuittinen, Mia Isotalo, Hilkka J. Timonen, Jarkko V. Niemi, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, and Miikka Dal Maso\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 1–13, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhotochemically formed sulfuric acid is generally considered the main source for new particle formation in the atmosphere. Contrary to current understanding, our measurements of nanoclusters and gaseous sulfuric acid performed in an urban area imply that traffic contributes to sulfuric acid concentration and that even for the smallest particles, the traffic-emitted fraction mostly exceeds the photochemistry-driven regional new particle formation.\n\nEffects of strengthening the Baltic Sea ECA regulations\n\nJan Eiof Jonson, Michael Gauss, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, and Lasse Johansson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 13469–13487, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13469-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13469-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalculations have been made with the regional-scale EMEP chemical transport model covering Europe and the sea areas surrounding Europe, including much of the North Atlantic. The main focus is on the effects on air pollution as well as depositions of sulfur and nitrogen following the implementation of stricter sulfur emission regulations from 1 January 2015 for ships operating in the Baltic Sea. We also include a study on the effects of future (2030) emissions changes.\n\nNew particle formation, growth and apparent shrinkage at a rural background site in western Saudi Arabia\n\nSimo Hakala, Mansour A. Alghamdi, Pauli Paasonen, Ville Vakkari, Mamdouh I. Khoder, Kimmo Neitola, Lubna Dada, Ahmad S. Abdelmaksoud, Hisham Al-Jeelani, Ibrahim I. Shabbaj, Fahd M. Almehmadi, Anu-Maija SundstrÃ¶m, Heikki Lihavainen, Veli-Matti Kerminen, Jenni Kontkanen, Markku Kulmala, Tareq Hussein, and Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 10537–10555, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-10537-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-10537-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric aerosols have significant effects on human health and the climate. A large fraction of these aerosols originate from new particle formation, where atmospheric vapors form small nanosized particles that grow into larger sizes, thus becoming climatically relevant. We show that large amounts of fast-growing particles are formed frequently at a site located in western Saudi Arabia and that these particles are likely connected to strong nearby emissions from human activities.\n\nUrban population exposure to NOx emissions from local shipping in three Baltic Sea harbour cities â a generic approach\n\nMartin Otto Paul Ramacher, Matthias Karl, Johannes Bieser, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, and Lasse Johansson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 9153–9179, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-9153-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-9153-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulated the impact of NOx shipping emissions on air quality and exposure in the Baltic Sea harbour cities Rostock (Germany), Riga (Latvia) and GdaÅsk–Gdynia (Poland) for 2012. We found that local shipping affects total NO2, with contributions of 22 %, 11 % and 16 % in Rostock, Riga and GdaÅsk–Gdynia. Exposure to NO2 from all emission sources was highest at home addresses (54 %–59 %). Emissions from shipping have a high impact on NO2 exposure in the port area (50 %–80 %).\n\nLaboratory and field evaluation of the Aerosol Dynamics Inc. concentrator (ADIc) for aerosol mass spectrometry\n\nSanna Saarikoski, Leah R. Williams, Steven R. Spielman, Gregory S. Lewis, Arantzazu Eiguren-Fernandez, Minna Aurela, Susanne V. Hering, Kimmo TeinilÃ¤, Philip Croteau, John T. Jayne, Thorsten Hohaus, Douglas R. Worsnop, and Hilkka Timonen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 3907–3920, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-3907-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-3907-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn air-to-air ultrafine particle concentrator (Aerosol Dynamics Inc. concentrator; ADIc) has been tailored for the low (~ 0.08 L min−1) inlet flow of aerosol mass spectrometers, and it provides a factor of 8–21 enrichment in the concentration of particles. The ADIc was evaluated in laboratory and field measurements. The results showed that the concentration factor depends primarily on the ratio between the sample flow and the output flow and is independent of particle size above about 10 nm.\n\nEffects of ship emissions on air quality in the Baltic Sea region simulated with three different chemistry transport models\n\nMatthias Karl, Jan Eiof Jonson, Andreas Uppstu, Armin Aulinger, Marje Prank, Mikhail Sofiev, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Lasse Johansson, Markus Quante, and Volker Matthias\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 7019–7053, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-7019-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-7019-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of ship emissions on the regional air quality in the Baltic Sea region was investigated with three regional chemistry transport model systems. The ship influence on air quality is shown to depend on the boundary conditions, meteorological data and aerosol formation and deposition schemes that are used in these models. The study provides a reliable approach for the evaluation of policy options regarding emission regulations for ship traffic in the Baltic Sea.\n\nImpact of a nitrogen emission control area (NECA) on the future air quality and nitrogen deposition to seawater in the Baltic Sea region\n\nMatthias Karl, Johannes Bieser, Beate Geyer, Volker Matthias, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Lasse Johansson, and Erik Fridell\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 1721–1752, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1721-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1721-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAir emissions of nitrogen oxides from ship traffic in the Baltic Sea are a health concern in coastal areas of the Baltic Sea region. We find that the introduction of the nitrogen emission control area (NECA) is critical for reducing ship emissions of nitrogen oxides to levels that are low enough to sustainably dampen ozone production. The decline of the ship-related nitrogen deposition to the Baltic Sea between 2012 and 2040 varies between 46 % and 78 % in different regulation scenarios.\n\nModelling of ships as a source of underwater noise\n\nJukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Lasse Johansson, Mattias Liefvendahl, Rickard Bensow, Peter Sigray, Martin Ãstberg, Ilkka Karasalo, Mathias Andersson, Heikki Peltonen, and Jukka Pajala\n\nOcean Sci., 14, 1373–1383, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-14-1373-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-14-1373-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents the implementation of an underwater noise emission module in the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model. This model is based on real shipping activity, as described by the vessel navigation systems, and combines it with technical descriptions of each ship. The methodology described facilitates the expression of underwater noise as emission maps, which describe the energy emitted to the water. This enables regular reporting of shipping noise and facilitates further research.\n\nLight-absorption of dust and elemental carbon in snow in the Indian Himalayas and the Finnish Arctic\n\nJonas Svensson, Johan StrÃ¶m, Niku KivekÃ¤s, Nathaniel B. Dkhar, Shresth Tayal, Ved P. Sharma, Arttu Jutila, John Backman, Aki Virkkula, Meri Ruppel, Antti HyvÃ¤rinen, Anna Kontu, Henna-Reetta Hannula, Matti LeppÃ¤ranta, Rakesh K. Hooda, Atte Korhola, Eija Asmi, and Heikki Lihavainen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 1403–1416, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-1403-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-1403-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReceding glaciers in the Himalayas are of concern. Here we present measurements of light-absorbing impurities, known to contribute to the ongoing glacier decrease, in snow from Indian Himalayas and compare them to snow samples from the Finnish Arctic. The soot particles in the snow are shown to have lower light absorbing efficiency, possibly affecting their radiative forcing potential in the snow. Further, dust influences the snow in the Himalayas to a much greater extent than in Finland.\n\nComparison of primary and secondary particle formation from natural gas engine exhaust and of their volatility characteristics\n\nJenni Alanen, Pauli Simonen, Sanna Saarikoski, Hilkka Timonen, Oskari Kangasniemi, Erkka Saukko, Risto Hillamo, Kati Lehtoranta, Timo Murtonen, Hannu Vesala, Jorma Keskinen, and Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 8739–8755, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-8739-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-8739-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSecondary organic and inorganic aerosols deteriorate air quality. Their formation from a natural gas engine was studied and compared with the emitted primary particulate emission. The volatility of the formed particles was defined as a function of temperature. Photochemical ages 4â11 days, mimicked by a potential aerosol mass chamber, produced 9â20 mg kg−1 fuel SOA. Aged emission particles were found to be less volatile than the fresh, implicating longer stability in the atmosphere.\n\nInfluence of fuel ethanol content on primary emissions and secondary aerosol formation potential for a modern flex-fuel gasoline vehicle\n\nHilkka Timonen, Panu Karjalainen, Erkka Saukko, Sanna Saarikoski, PÃ¤ivi Aakko-Saksa, Pauli Simonen, Timo Murtonen, Miikka Dal Maso, Heino Kuuluvainen, Matthew Bloss, Erik Ahlberg, Birgitta Svenningsson, Joakim Pagels, William H. Brune, Jorma Keskinen, Douglas R. Worsnop, Risto Hillamo, and Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 5311–5329, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5311-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5311-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of fuel ethanol content (10–100 %) on primary emissions and the subsequent secondary aerosol formation was investigated for a Euro 5 flex-fuel gasoline vehicle. The emissions were characterized during the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) using high time-resolution instruments. The chemical composition of the exhaust particulate matter was studied using a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS), and the secondary aerosol formation was studied with an oxidation chamber.\n\nA new oxidation flow reactor for measuring secondary aerosol formation of rapidly changing emission sources\n\nPauli Simonen, Erkka Saukko, Panu Karjalainen, Hilkka Timonen, Matthew Bloss, PÃ¤ivi Aakko-Saksa, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, Jorma Keskinen, and Miikka Dal Maso\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 1519–1537, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-1519-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-1519-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric particles affect climate, health and visibility, and a large source of these particles is secondary aerosol formation. We developed a new oxidation flow reactor for studying the secondary aerosol formation potential of rapidly changing emission sources. Using laboratory measurements, we show that this flow reactor is suitable for studying the secondary aerosol potential of, for example, light duty vehicle emissions during a transient driving cycle.\n\nSize-selected black carbon mass distributions and mixing state in polluted and clean environments of northern India\n\nTomi Raatikainen, David Brus, Rakesh K. Hooda, Antti-Pekka HyvÃ¤rinen, Eija Asmi, Ved P. Sharma, Antti Arola, and Heikki Lihavainen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 371–383, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-371-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-371-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have measured black carbon aerosol properties in northern India at two sites: the first site is located at the polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain, while the second site is at the Himalayan foothills in a significantly cleaner environment. The observations show a clear difference in black carbon concentrations, but individual aerosol particles seem to be similar in both sites. Indirect evidence suggests that the particles are highly irregular resembling freshly emitted soot.\n\nApplications and limitations of constrained high-resolution peak fitting on low resolving power mass spectra from the ToF-ACSM\n\nHilkka Timonen, Mike Cubison, Minna Aurela, David Brus, Heikki Lihavainen, Risto Hillamo, Manjula Canagaratna, Bettina Nekat, Rolf Weller, Douglas Worsnop, and Sanna Saarikoski\n\nAtmos. Meas.

In mass terms, the amount of secondary particles was 13 times the amount of primary particles. The highest emissions were observed after a cold start when the engine and catalyst performance were suboptimal. The key parameter for secondary particle formation was the amount of gaseous hydrocarbons in the exhaust.\n\nChemical and physical characterization of traffic particles in four different highway environments in the Helsinki metropolitan area\n\nJoonas Enroth, Sanna Saarikoski, Jarkko Niemi, Anu Kousa, Irena JeÅ¾ek, GriÅ¡a MoÄnik, Samara Carbone, Heino Kuuluvainen, Topi RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, Risto Hillamo, and Liisa Pirjola\n\nAtmos.

Pollution gradients were observed for particle number, black carbon, organics, some metals, and gases at four different highway environments. Flow dynamics appeared to be an important factor, however, at the most open site, condensation of semi-volatile organics was observed. The fleet average NO2 emission factor increased over the last decade.\n\nAir quality and radiative impacts of Arctic shipping emissions in the summertime in northern Norway: from the local to the regional scale\n\nLouis Marelle, Jennie L.

The work is based on automatic position reports (AIS) sent by ships and reflects realistic activity patterns of ships. The work demonstrates that it is feasible to construct full bottom-up emission inventories based on large-volume activity data sets.\n\nCharacterization of trace metals on soot aerosol particles with the SP-AMS: detection and quantification\n\nS. Carbone, T. Onasch, S. Saarikoski, H. Timonen, K. Saarnio, D. Sueper, T. RÃ¶nkkÃ¶, L. Pirjola, A. HÃ¤yrinen, D. Worsnop, and R. Hillamo\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The properties of 13 different trace metals (Na, Al, Ca, V, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr and Ba) were investigated in a controlled laboratory experiment. The results from the laboratory tests were applied to study fine particles in emissions of a heavy-fuel-oil-fired heating station.\n\nEmission factors of SO2, NOx and particles from ships in Neva Bay from ground-based and helicopter-borne measurements and AIS-based modeling\n\nJ. Beecken, J. Mellqvist, K. Salo, J. Ekholm, J.-P. Jalkanen, L. Johansson, V. Litvinenko, K. Volodin, and D. A. Frank-Kamenetsky\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 5229–5241, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-5229-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-5229-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of SO2, NOx and particle emission factors of more than 400 individual ship passages in the Gulf of Finland are presented and discussed. The measurements were conducted during two campaigns in the years 2011 and 2012 from ground-based and helicopter-based platforms. It was found that a significant number of ships use fuel oil with a fuel sulfur content below the limit of 1%. Additionally, the results of modeled data for the same ships were compared to the measurements of this study.\n\nModel calculations of the effects of present and future emissions of air pollutants from shipping in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea\n\nJ.

Ship emissions are based on accurate ship positioning data. The effects on depositions and air pollution and the resulting number of years of life lost (YOLLs) are calculated by comparing model calculations with and without ship emissions, with ship emissions before and after 2010, and for future projections.\n\nRefinement of a model for evaluating the population exposure in an urban area\n\nJ.

Daytime mixing contrasted with nighttime stratification, with distinct rain-induced changes in aerosol populations. Notably, optical property recovery at higher levels was faster, while near-canopy aerosols showed higher scattering efficiency. These findings enhance our understanding of aerosol impacts on climate dynamics.\n\nVertical structure of a springtime smoky and humid troposphere over the southeast Atlantic from aircraft and reanalysis\n\nKristina Pistone, Eric M. Wilcox, Paquita Zuidema, Marco Giordano, James Podolske, Samuel E. LeBlanc, MeloÃ« Kacenelenbogen, Steven G. Howell, and Steffen Freitag\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This smoke travels with water vapor; more smoke means more humidity. We use aircraft observations and models to describe how the values change through the season and over the region. We sort the atmosphere into different types by vertical structure and amount of smoke and humidity. Since our work shows how frequently these components coincide, it helps to better quantify heating effects over this region.\n\nShipborne observations of black carbon aerosols in the western Arctic Ocean during summer and autumn 2016â2020: impact of boreal fires\n\nYange Deng, Hiroshi Tanimoto, Kohei Ikeda, Sohiko Kameyama, Sachiko Okamoto, Jinyoung Jung, Young Jun Yoon, Eun Jin Yang, and Sung-Ho Kang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 6339–6357, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6339-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-6339-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBlack carbon (BC) aerosols play important roles in Arctic climate change, yet they are not well understood because of limited observational data. We observed BC mass concentrations (mBC) in the western Arctic Ocean during summer and early autumn 2016–2020. The mean mBC in 2019 was much higher than in other years. Biomass burning was likely the dominant BC source. Boreal fire BC transport occurring near the surface and/or in the mid-troposphere contributed to high-BC events in the Arctic Ocean.\n\nAttribution of aerosol particle number size distributions to main sources using an 11-year urban dataset\n\nMÃ¡tÃ© VÃ¶rÃ¶smarty, Philip K. Hopke, and Imre Salma\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5695–5712, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5695-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5695-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe World Health Organization identified ultrafine particles, which make up most of the particle number concentrations, as a potential risk factor for humans. The sources of particle numbers are very different from those of the particulate matter mass. We performed source apportionment of size-segregated particle number concentrations over the diameter range of 6–1000 nm in Budapest for 11 full years. Six source types were identified, characterized and quantified.\n\nContribution of fluorescent primary biological aerosol particles to low-level Arctic cloud residuals\n\nGabriel Pereira Freitas, Ben Kopec, Kouji Adachi, Radovan Krejci, Dominic Heslin-Rees, Karl Espen Yttri, Alun Hubbard, Jeffrey M. Welker, and Paul Zieger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5479–5494, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5479-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5479-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBioaerosols can participate in ice formation within clouds. In the Arctic, where global warming manifests most, they may become more important as their sources prevail for longer periods of the year. We have directly measured bioaerosols within clouds for a full year at an Arctic mountain site using a novel combination of cloud particle sampling and single-particle techniques. We show that bioaerosols act as cloud seeds and may influence the presence of ice within clouds.\n\nOpinion: New directions in atmospheric research offered by research infrastructures combined with open and data-intensive science\n\nAndreas Petzold, Ulrich Bundke, Anca Hienola, Paolo Laj, Cathrine Lund Myhre, Alex Vermeulen, Angeliki Adamaki, Werner Kutsch, Valerie Thouret, Damien Boulanger, Markus Fiebig, Markus Stocker, Zhiming Zhao, and Ari Asmi\n\nAtmos.

Ice particles were more abundant in the former site, while the fraction of ice particles relative to total ambient particles, representing atmospheric ice nucleation efficiency, was higher in the latter site. Ice nucleation parameterizations were developed as a function of examined freezing temperatures from two sites for our study periods (autumn).\n\nVertical distribution of ice nucleating particles over the boreal forest of Hyytiälä, Finland\n\nZoÃ© Brasseur, Julia Schneider, Janne Lampilahti, Ville Vakkari, Victoria A.

However, very little is known concerning the vertical distribution of INPs in the atmosphere. Here, we present aircraft measurements of INP concentrations above the Finnish boreal forest. Results show that near-surface INPs are efficiently transported and mixed within the boundary layer, and occasionally reach the free troposphere.\n\nEfficient droplet activation of ambient black carbon particles in a suburban environment\n\nPing Tian, Dantong Liu, Kang Hu, Yangzhou Wu, Mengyu Huang, Hui He, Jiujiang Sheng, Chenjie Yu, Dawei Hu, and Deping Ding\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5149–5164, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5149-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5149-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe results provide direct evidence of efficient droplet activation of black carbon (BC). The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation fraction of BC was higher than for all particles, suggesting higher CCN activity of BC, even though its hygroscopicity is lower. Our research reveals that the evolution of BC's hygroscopicity and its CCN activation properties through atmospheric aging can be effectively characterized by the photochemical age.\n\nTropospheric sulfate from Cumbre Vieja (La Palma) observed over Cabo Verde contrasted with background conditions: a lidar case study of aerosol extinction, backscatter, depolarization and lidar ratio profiles at 355, 532 and 1064 nm\n\nHenriette Gebauer, Athena Augusta Floutsi, Moritz Haarig, Martin Radenz, Ronny Engelmann, Dietrich Althausen, Annett Skupin, Albert Ansmann, Cordula Zenk, and Holger Baars\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We characterized the aerosol burden based on a case study of lidar and sun photometer observations. We compared the volcanic case to the typical background conditions (reference case) to quantify the volcanic pollution. We show the first ever measurements of the extinction coefficient, lidar ratio and depolarization ratio at 1064 nm for volcanic sulfate.\n\nThe radiative impact of biomass burning aerosols on dust emissions over Namibia and the long-range transport of smoke observed during the Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) campaign\n\nCyrille Flamant, Jean-Pierre Chaboureau, Marco Gaetani, Kerstin Schepanski, and Paola Formenti\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4265–4288, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4265-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4265-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the austral dry season, the atmospheric composition over southern Africa is dominated by biomass burning aerosols and terrigenous aerosols (so-called mineral dust). This study suggests that the radiative effect of biomass burning aerosols needs to be taken into account to properly forecast dust emissions in Namibia.\n\nExtending the wind profile beyond the surface layer by combining physical and machine learning approaches\n\nBoming Liu, Xin Ma, Jianping Guo, Renqiang Wen, Hui Li, Shikuan Jin, Yingying Ma, Xiaoran Guo, and Wei Gong\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4047–4063, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4047-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4047-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate wind profile estimation, especially for the lowest few hundred meters of the atmosphere, is of great significance for the weather, climate, and renewable energy sector. We propose a novel method that combines the power-law method with the random forest algorithm to extend wind profiles beyond the surface layer. Compared with the traditional algorithm, this method has better stability and spatial applicability and can be used to obtain the wind profiles on different land cover types.\n\nAmazonian aerosol size distributions in a lognormal phase space: characteristics and trajectories\n\nGabriela R. Unfer, Luiz A. T. Machado, Paulo Artaxo, Marco A. Franco, Leslie A. Kremper, Mira L. PÃ¶hlker, Ulrich PÃ¶schl, and Christopher PÃ¶hlker\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The results showed characteristic arrangements regarding seasonal and diurnal cycles, as well as when interacting with precipitation. The use of this 3D space appears to be a promising tool for aerosol population analysis and for model validation and parameterization.\n\nMeasurement report: Hygroscopicity of size-selected aerosol particles in the heavily polluted urban atmosph"
