        "meta_description": "This chapter analyses the initially sparse but later comprehensive efforts made by the Swedish Foreign Office to find out what happened to Raoul Wallenberg. It also examines the many and extensive debates during and after the Cold War about the Swedish handling of the so-called Wallenberg case, often with representatives of the Swedish government and Foreign Office on one side and representatives of the Wallenberg Association, as well as of his family, on the other. The chapter demonstrates how and why Wallenberg went from embodying a difficult issue in Swedish politics to becoming a symbol, or rather a foreign-policy brand, for the country. The latter mindset was especially predominant in 2012, in connection with the celebration of the centenary of his birth. At that point, the express aim was to reduce emphasis on his disappearance in the Soviet Union, and on the way Swedish governments handled that disappearance, so as to lay greater stress on his achievements in Budapest during 1944–1945.",

        "text": "Asked when the Swedish Foreign Office (Utrikesdepartementet, UD) will have paid off its debt to Raoul Wallenberg caused by its delayed action in the immediate post-war years, the Swedish diplomat and former Minister for Foreign Affairs Jan Eliasson replied: ‘Never.’1 The debt remains despite the process of coming to terms with what had been Sweden’s policy at that time, plus the apology made in 2001 by Sweden’s then Prime Minister Göran Persson to Wallenberg’s family.2 This pattern is a familiar product of the official politics of memory since the turn of the last century, according to which past wrongs are publicly held up to legal scrutiny. Heads of state, usually born after the wrongs occurred, have apologized to the victims and their families in the hope of achieving closure and reconciliation. On the basis of modern moral values, and with the Second World War as the main hurdle, political leaders have bowed their heads and begged survivors for forgiveness.3\n\nThe list of Swedes who deserve a modern-day apology could be made longer. The wealthy entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren, who in addition to his business activities had attempted to broker peace in the summer of 1939, was blacklisted three years later by the British and US governments for his supposed inappropriately good relationships with Nazi luminaries. No evidence that Wenner-Gren was a German spy has ever been presented, even though the material collected on him in US archives eventually became almost as extensive as the UD’s Swedish files on Wallenberg. The diplomat Leif Leifland, who had good insights into both cases, noted a similar ‘anxious evasiveness’ on the part of Swedish decision-makers vis-à-vis the great powers, irrespective of whether they were located in the West or the East. He stressed that this comparison should not be carried too far: after all, the reprehensible actions of Sweden’s coalition government in the Wenner-Gren case did not have such fatal effects as the Swedish passivity in the Wallenberg case probably had in the immediate post-war years.4\n\nThe case of Wallenberg also differs from that of Wenner-Gren, and most others, in that the vanished diplomat has been discussed with considerable continuity in Sweden. For a long time it was an infected bone of contention in domestic politics, the main issue being how neutral Sweden should relate to its powerful neighbour and superpower to the east, the Soviet Union. Swedish politicians and UD representatives failed to persuade Soviet and Russian politicians to initiate and, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, to fully support an investigation into the Wallenberg case. In retrospect, the official Swedish reaction to the Soviet capture of Wallenberg, especially from 1945 to 1947, had obvious shortcomings. It cannot be ruled out that the feeble action in the first few years after his disappearance led to neglected opportunities to secure his release.\n\nThat conclusion was also reached by the government-appointed commission of enquiry which presented its extensive findings in 2003. The enquiry’s chairman, civil servant and Liberal politician Ingmar Eliasson, expressed doubts about the report’s blunt title: Ett diplomatiskt misslyckande [‘A failure of diplomacy’]. His biography suggests that he favoured a title more in line with that proposed by Bertil Ohlin, also a member of the Liberal Party and its leader from 1944 to 1967, who in 1975 described the early actions as regards the Wallenberg case of those in charge of Sweden’s foreign policy as ‘a serious mistake’. The other members of the Eliasson commission supported the title ‘A failure of diplomacy’ because it was important to ‘call a spade a spade’. The then Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated the year the enquiry was published, made no attempts to defend her party colleague and predecessor as Foreign Minister, Östen Undén, whose actions were heavily criticized in the enquiry. In retrospect but in the same spirit, the then Prime Minister Göran Persson, like Lindh a Social Democrat, stated that although he had not apologized until 2001, he had repeatedly expressed regret for the Swedish authorities’ actions in the Wallenberg case. Nor did any other politician object to the commission’s findings. Instead: ‘This report was placed on file without debate’, Eliasson noted, some ten years later.5\n\nThe admission, however, was extremely belated. As we shall see, previously published White Papers had presented a totally different picture of Sweden’s actions. The longstanding unwillingness to come to terms with this narrative has probably contributed to a still lingering frustration. Susanne Berger, an American scholar based in Germany, is one of those commentators who have repeatedly criticized Swedish politicians, from the early post-war period up to the present time, for not making enough of an effort to get the leaderships of the Soviet Union and then Russia to reveal once and for all the truth about what happened to Wallenberg. Berger argues that no Swedish government has attempted to exert sufficient pressure on the Soviet and Russian leaders to grant access to important, still classified information. She firmly rejects the idea that the Wallenberg mystery cannot be solved.6\n\nBerger has certainly pointed out many flaws in the Swedish actions, but the analysis should not stop there. In a discussion about historical justice and comparisons between the historian and the judge, Martin Wiklund points out that it is important to try to understand the actors of that time on the basis of their operating conditions. That, however, does not prohibit the making of overall moral and ideological judgements. In a scenario where history is on trial in a court-like situation, justice may, for the historian, ‘function as a normative ideal that favours impartiality without implying indifference or value neutrality’.7 But if and when history is used as a moral yardstick, this balancing act becomes difficult because a particularly tricky question is whose morality is at issue – that of the historical actors, or our own moral perceptions in the early twenty-first century? As mentioned at the beginning of this book, it is unavoidable for history to be a dual thought process. This process is what ‘gives meaning to the past, on the basis of both the values of that time and our later moral horizon’, states Klas-Göran Karlsson.8 In other words, the Wallenberg case does include moral aspects, but it would be unfortunate if conclusions about it were to be dominated by moralizing in hindsight. It is thus a matter of singling out – as was done in ‘A failure of diplomacy’ – inadequate actions of diplomat Staffan Söderblom and Minister for Foreign Affairs Östen Undén and of placing these actions in the context of the early post-war period in order to better understand why the two men acted as they did. Such contextualization may, for example, provide clues as to why Raoul Wallenberg was not initially granted the same elevated position as another Swedish humanitarian role model, Folke Bernadotte, who, like Wallenberg, made his most important contributions during the final stages of the Second World War.\n\nThe ensuing history-cultural explanations embody a degree of divergence. Some are closely associated with Raoul Wallenberg whereas others are bound up with Swedish domestic and foreign policies and with general trends in the West, especially regarding the view of the Holocaust. As stated above, the explanations do not excuse the wait-and-see approach of Söderblom, Undén, and other actors; but they do help to shed an explanatory light on their handling of the Wallenberg case.\n\nTrying to understand the Holocaust\n\nMedia reports of the Holocaust’s effects were published both in Sweden and in other countries while the genocide was ongoing. Protests against Nazi racial policy were expressed while the Second World War was still raging. As mentioned in the Introduction, these often appeared in Jewish publications, but texts about what was happening were also published in daily newspapers from 1942 onwards.9 In neutral Sweden, articles about pogroms and persecutions also appeared in some of the major newspapers from 1938 onwards.10 Even so, it should be emphasized that the Holocaust as we know it today was still largely unknown to the general public when the Second World War was entering its final stages. International research has highlighted the obstacles to these reports becoming widely known because they were often given a low profile in the newspapers, not least because the combined message of these unimaginable reports was not a good fit with prevailing views about journalism. Reporters assigned to writing about the war were expected to report news of a kind germane to established narratives. When news of mass persecution and mass murder began to leak out, journalists were simply not equipped for writing about it. Besides, these reports of the incredible and the unimaginable had to compete for attention with reports of wartime events, refugee flows, and day-to-day news.11\n\nBecause of the low impact of previous attempts, the people assigned to report from the liberated concentration camps in Germany in the spring of 1945 realized that they would have to do so in new ways. True, the text and photo reports from Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, and other camps had sent shock waves around the world, but the strong reactions did not necessarily reflect a general understanding of what had happened, or what had been the motives behind the Nazi extermination policy.12 Attempts to draw attention to the persisting antisemitism in Sweden led to long debates in the Swedish Parliament, the Riksdag, about legislating against anti-Jewish propaganda. One Riksdag member praised Sweden’s official policy of neutrality but criticized ‘the official moral neutrality’, which meant that too few Swedes protested against lingering antisemitism. Others argued that persecution of Jews was a specifically German phenomenon and had no counterpart in Sweden.13 In 1947, the tense situation between the British and Jews in Palestine in the immediate post-war years, the difficulties experienced by Jewish refugees seeking new homelands, the pogroms in Poland, and other examples of persistent antisemitism made one writer warn that nothing had been learned. Active evil had been replaced ‘by a cold-blooded lack of action that is almost equally frightening’.14\n\nThe early post-war discussions demonstrate that information is not the same as knowledge. During the Second World War, there had been obvious problems for Jews and non-Jews alike in converting information about the genocide into an understanding of what was really going on, and to what extent. These difficulties persisted in the early post-war years, partly as a result of a reluctance among survivors to talk about their experiences or, among those who were willing, to attract attention. Information that had reached Allied and neutral governments during the war years was often not made public. Another difficulty was understanding the scale of the mass murder that was happening. For example, in 1942 the Swedish diplomat Göran von Otter received a detailed account of the Nazi genocide from Kurt Gerstein, who had joined the SS with the aim of finding out for himself what was going on. The information was passed on to staff at the UD, but no one there or in the Swedish government took any immediate action to pursue the matter. This inertia was due to a combination of reasons, including the difficulty of verifying Gerstein’s information, an unwillingness to contribute to what might be an example of ‘atrocity propaganda’, and political conflicts over whether or not Sweden should make any official protests against Germany.15\n\nThis lack of interest was not total. For example, Bo Enander and Franz Arnheim published a book entitled Så härskade herrefolket [‘How the master race ruled’] immediately after the end of the war, a book which included accounts of the course and consequences of the Holocaust.16 The Nuremberg Trials of 1945 to 1946 were also significant as they dealt with the Nazi genocide for the first time in a non-Jewish context. One aspect of the trials was the supplying of detailed historical background information about entrenched antisemitic prejudices. During the proceedings the prosecutors also repeatedly referred to the mass murders of Jews and, although less frequently, also of Roma. In addition, US lawyers highlighted the mass executions performed by the Einsatzgruppen death squads on the Eastern Front in the first phase of the Holocaust. However, the lawyers had not yet grasped the difference between the concentration camps, where life was certainly brutal and many people died, and the extermination camps on Polish soil, where the aim was the industrial mass murder of as many Jews and ‘undesirables’ as possible. During the Nuremberg Trials, the stated aim was to concentrate on the Nazi plan to launch a war of aggression. Even though there were recurring accounts of abuses of the Jews, these were not given the status of a separate category of crime but were classified under ‘crimes against humanity’ or ‘war crimes’. None of the lawyers was able to situate the Nazi crimes against the Jewish people as part of the overall Nazi ideology, whose very foundation was antisemitism.17\n\nThe encounter with grievously sick and exhausted women in refugee camps made a strong impression on a number of writers. Their texts told Swedish readers about the urgent requirements associated with rehabilitating people who had been subjected to so much cruelty. It was a major challenge to integrate them into Swedish society, not least because of the hostilities that re-emerged, for instance when Jewish women were harassed by Catholic Poles who had themselves been victims of Nazism but who were still antisemites.18 One of the many Swedes who became involved in assisting the humanitarian effort – work that was severely tested when tens of thousands of survivors of the extermination and concentration camps arrived in Sweden in the spring of 1945 – was the influential Social Democratic politician and reformer Alva Myrdal. She argued that the physical presence of the victims of Nazi genocidal policies helped to awaken Swedes once and for all to the consequences of the ideal of a society freed from what Hitler and his followers had termed ‘subhumans’ unfit to live. In the summer of 1945, she wrote: ‘Finally, the stench, the hunger, the agony from the German concentration camps have come crashing even into our Swedish consciousness.’19\n\nEven so, this close contact with survivors did not automatically produce insights into what had been happening outside the safety of Sweden. The reception of the refugees alternated between considerateness and thoughtlessness. The reporting focused at least as much on the high quality of modern Swedish aid efforts as on the horrors that the new arrivals had endured.20 The apparent reactions of the alleged perpetrators dominated in the Swedish press, but less attention was paid to the crimes they were acused of, including the Holocaust. As Finnish historian Antero Holmila has noted, as the crimes of individual perpetrators were being highlighted there was simultaneously an intense debate, also raging in the immediate post-war years, about whether it was reasonable to speak of a collective German guilt. There was no lack of comments about the extermination of Jews, but these were, to all intents and purposes, excusively associated with Germany and Nazism.21 Remarks that antisemitism was a widespread phenomenon and that ‘[t]he Jewish question is the common shame of every country and every people’ were among the exceptions.22\n\nIt was thus rare in Sweden for commentators to raise aspects of complicity or passivity. Instead, the press coverage of the Nuremberg Trials emphasized that Swedes had also suffered during the war and were therefore victims of Nazism, too.23 In the following years, however, scores were settled with individuals who had sided with the Nazis. Historian Johan Östling stresses that these experiences of Nazism took on great importance in post-war Sweden. One way in which this development was expressed was through total or secondary stigmatization. The former was applied to individuals who were branded as ‘Hitler’s Swedish lackeys’, and who continued to defend Nazism after the war ended in 1945. Secondary stigmatization mainly affected cultural figures, such as the literary critic Fredrik Böök and the singer and actress Zarah Leander, both of whom had more or less openly embraced the German cause. The stigma of Nazism also affected the historian of ideas Erich Wittenberg. In a high-profile debate in the late 1940s and 1950s, his application for an associate professorship was rejected despite his extensive scholarly output. Wittenberg represented German national conservatism and philosophical idealism. Consequently, he was associated with Nazism and the danger of its return. That he had firmly denounced Nazism on multiple occasions, and that as a Jew he had been forced to abandon his academic career in Germany and flee to Sweden in 1935, did not help his cause. At that time, fear of remnants of the Nazi ideology – in the Wittenberg case in the form of guilt by association – was stronger than any Swedish solidarity with victims of the Holocaust.24\n\nOne reason why the Holocaust did not play a prominent role in the Nuremberg Trials, or in post-war societies in general, was the continuing lack of adequate words to describe what had happened. ‘Genocide’ was launched in 1944, but it took a number of years for the term to become widely established. Similarly, ‘Holocaust’ as a concept associated with the Nazi genocide was only adopted in the late 1950s. It came into wider use after the US television drama of the same name made its triumphant progress around the world in 1978–1979. As in other Western countries, the Holocaust television series engendered a large number of articles when it was shown on Swedish television in the spring of 1979. Only a few of these addressed aspects of the Holocaust related to Sweden, such as Swedish refugee policy before and during the Second World War, or the witness accounts that had reached Swedish ears early on. Most of the writers perceived the Holocaust as a historical phenomenon associated solely with Nazism and Germany.25 With a few exceptions, it was not until the 1990s that questions about Sweden’s actions prior to and during the Second World War began to be debated, the main ingredients being criticism of the restrictive refugee policies and the pragmatic policies of negotiation and neutrality – policies to which critics have referred as policies of yielding or adaptation.26\n\nIn the shadow of Folke Bernadotte\n\nIn Swedish history culture, events such as the efforts to feed the starving Greek population in 1941–1942 or the actions of the ‘Warsaw Swedes’, who served as couriers for the Polish Resistance in order to spread information about the Holocaust, have only gained attention on a few occasions, or only in the early twenty-first century. From an early stage, the spotlight has primarily focused on Folke Bernadotte and Raoul Wallenberg. One indication to that effect is that these two role models have repeatedly been discussed together. It has been said that Bernadotte and Wallenberg became acquainted before the war when both men were working in the United States.27 However, their link was an indirect one and was connected with a 1944 proposal to send Bernadotte as a Red Cross representative to protect Jews in Hungary. Instead, the task was assigned to Valdemar Langlet, with whom Wallenberg later collaborated.28\n\nOne important difference between the respective situations of the two men was that the Wallenberg case was coloured from the outset by the realities of the Cold War, including Sweden’s fragile relations with the new superpower of the Baltic Sea region, the Soviet Union. By contrast, Bernadotte was initially an unproblematic figure. This ‘man of destiny’, who in the final stages of the war had enjoyed ‘the confidence of both sides’, had bravely ventured into the wolf’s lair and negotiated with the egregious SS chief Heinrich Himmler in order to carry out ‘this magnificent humanitarian operation, which is a credit to the Swedish name’.29 After the end of the war, Bernadotte published several best-selling pieces in which he recounted his memories of meetings with Himmler and of the perilous rescue operations in northern Germany in the spring of 1945. Admittedly, protests were heard early on that Count Bernadotte was highlighting his own efforts at the expense of other Red Cross workers. Another dilemma was Bernadotte’s favourable attitude towards SS General Walter Schellenberg, whom Jacob Wallenberg had contacted in 1944 to ask him to protect Raoul Wallenberg from his hardline and ruthless SS colleagues in Budapest.30 In his introduction to the general’s posthumously published autobiography, the British historian Alan Bullock acerbically observed: ‘On certain subjects Schellenberg maintains a discreet silence’.31 Nor did Bernadotte acknowledge the involvement in, or at least the extensive knowledge of, the mass murder of Jews that a man in Schellenberg’s position would have had. Bernadotte’s testimony during the Nuremberg Trials largely adhered to the SS general’s story that his had been the voice of reason that had worked on Heinrich Himmler and Ernst Kaltenbrunner until they had agreed to release prisoners from the concentration camps. Folke Bernadotte’s endorsement of such a historical narrative was controversial to the highest degree.32\n\nThe fact, however, remained: Bernadotte had brought back victims of the Nazi regime who were successfully being cared for in Sweden. This ‘proved’ that Swedish hospitals and their staff were among the best in the whole world. The rescue operation gave the Swedish public authorities support for their argument that Swedish humanitarian efforts, which had been widely publicized in the aftermath of the First World War with Elsa Brändström as the figurehead, had not been a one-off event. As the rest of Europe lay in ruins, Swedes – members of the royal family as well as ‘ordinary’ nurses and bus drivers – had shown that they were prepared to leave their war-spared homeland and risk life and limb to save some of the people who were in desperate straits. As a lauded friend of peace, Folke Bernadotte continued to attract great attention in the context of his Middle East mediation mission, and even more so after Jewish terrorists had assassinated him in Jerusalem in 1948. There was much praise for his efforts in Sweden, and tributes kept pouring in from the rest of the world, too.33\n\nOne reason why Bernadotte’s contributions were so highly lauded at home had to do with the people he saved. Historian Mikael Byström has noted that there was a hierarchy in the view of refugees, a hierarchy based on geographical proximity and ethnicity. Those arriving from neighbouring countries were given the warmest welcome, although sometimes an ambivalence was expressed even about them. Both in speeches in the Swedish Parliament and in newspaper articles, for example, commentators distinguished between ‘ordinary Danes’ and ‘Danish Jews’. The former were accorded the highest status.34 Most of the people who initially arrived on the White Buses were originally from Denmark and Norway. The Hungarian Jews that Wallenberg had rescued were not as visible in Sweden.\n\nNeutrality as an ideal\n\nDuring the Second World War, Sweden’s objective was to stay out of the conflict at all costs. This goal was one reason why neutrality was highly valued, both as a concrete policy and as an ideal. The Swedish enthusiasm for peace and neutrality can be traced back to the eighteenth century, but it was given a boost by the two world wars. Reports from the horrific battles of 1914–1918 served as an effective antidote to the message of activists who wanted Sweden to join the war on Germany’s side.35 The hope of being able to stay outside once again guided Swedish foreign policy throughout the Second World War. This approach was later labelled ‘small-state realism’. The policy pursued under the leadership of Per Albin Hansson was characterized by constant attempts to ‘promote the desire for peace at the expense of the desire for resistance’.36 In practice, this entailed making concessions to whichever warring party happened to be the strongest at the time. In the early years of the war, that meant that Germany could often dictate the terms. Towards the end of the war, the situation was radically different. Sweden’s priority then was to improve its foreign-policy relations with the Allies and, not least, with the Soviet Union. The latter had been strained ever since the Finnish Winter War of 1939–1940, when, with the exception of the pro-Moscow Communists, Swedes had sympathized with Finland.\n\nThis new orientation not only affected Sweden’s handling of the Wallenberg case; perhaps the most obvious consequence was the highly controversial extradition of the Balts in 1945–1946. Sweden’s coalition government of the war years had been replaced by a Social Democratic one. Most of the centre-right commentators opposed a far-reaching extradition to the Soviet Union of the Baltic, Soviet, and German soldiers who were currently in Sweden. So, too, did Social Democratic Minister for Foreign Affairs Östen Undén in the initial internal discussions in his party. He changed sides, however, and more than anyone else he became associated with the Swedish decision that most of the interned soldiers – more than the number required under international law – would be shipped east. Undén categorized the Soviet Union as a nation fully governed by the rule of law, whereas ‘political maturity was not particularly prominent’ in the Soviet-occupied Baltic states. Sweden’s future Prime Minister Tage Erlander expressed a similar view, saying that both the British and the Soviets had a sincere ambition to create a lasting peace, which contrasted sharply to the aggressive policies pursued in Germany during Hitler’s time in power.37 These and similar statements contrasted sharply with the fate that awaited most of those extradited, who were either executed or shipped off to the Gulag.\n\nThe notion that Sweden was a northern utopia that had been spared the horrors of war was reinforced during the Second World War. Christian Günther, Minister for Foreign Affairs in the war-time coalition government, argued that neutrality could primarily be understood as a nation’s obligation to be impartial in relation to warring parties; but an even more important aim was to ensure that the country’s own territory was protected: under no circumstances should it become a theatre of war or a base for military operations by a foreign power.38 To be sure, the fact that Sweden had escaped the horrors of war might arouse the envy of less fortunate people and even lead to ‘despondent anxiety or unhealthy self-flagellation’. In the future, too, it was of the utmost importance to try to help the less fortunate. Nevertheless, the priority remained self-evident: ‘Like every individual, a people may have duties to others; but first and foremost it has obligations to itself, to its own population, its country, its past, and its future.’39\n\nOnly a few months later, however, Günther expressed doubts as to whether the emphasis on Swedish distinctiveness and the praise of Swedish neutrality might have gone too far. If the country continued to stress its own particular merits, there was a real danger that Swedes would not be in step with the rest of the world once the war was over.40 There is much to suggest that his warning fell on deaf ears, though. On returning home, Swedes who had experienced the effects of the war were surprised at how little the worldwide conflict had affected their compatriots. This observation was confirmed by a study conducted in the summer of 1944. Most respondents said that although the war had brought some restrictions and limitations, familiar routines had governed their day-to-day existence.41 Foreign observers were also surprised at the Swedish state of innocence and outsidership. In 1943 Kurt Erich Suckert, who wrote under the pseudonym Curzio Malaparte, had travelled from the warring Soviet Union to peaceful Sweden. His semi-documentary Kaputt, published the following year, sharply contrasted the horrors of the Eastern Front with a summery Stockholm. In the Swedish capital, he had become aware that even educated and generally well-informed Swedes with an elevated standing in society displayed little insight into what was happening elsewhere in Europe.42\n\nA few months after the war ended in Europe, the American journalist Demare Bess reported from Stockholm. She began her article by recounting a meeting she had had with a friend and fellow countryman, an army officer who had recently visited Sweden for the first time. Her friend was impressed by the Swedish standard of living, which differed markedly from that of war-torn Europe and in some respects surpassed that of the United States. This fact bothered him. The Swedes had got off far too lightly compared to other countries which had been occupied and/or fought against Hitler’s armies. Writing for an American readership, Bess went on to qualify this harsh verdict. Sweden had essentially pursued a foreign policy like those of other smaller nations such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway. However, they had had geography against them, whereas Sweden had benefited from skilful diplomacy and a lot of luck. She admitted that there was some justification for American criticism of Sweden for its excessive accommodation with Germany in the early years of the war, but this had to be set against the sanctuary that both US bomber crews and Danish Jews had enjoyed in this bastion of peace.43\n\nThe Swedish public was also able to learn about the partly contrasting US and Swedish perspectives on Swedish foreign policy during the Second World War. The Harvard historian Bruce Hopper, who had been in Sweden from 1941 to 1942, published an article in the Social Democratic magazine Tiden [‘The time’] in connection with the end of the war in Europe. He criticized the Swedish government’s failure to acknowledge that the transit of German soldiers through the country constituted ‘a violation of its neutrality that had been accepted under the threat of force majeure’. Otherwise he praised the fact that politicians, the press, and the Swedish people had preserved ‘the moral climate of neutrality’ as well as being willing to help refugees. Hopper’s main argument was that while Sweden ‘had been a very important lung for a suffocated Europe’, it was a small state that depended on a functioning balance of power. When that balance was destroyed in the early years of the war, with Germany as the dominant power, Sweden’s neutrality had also been lost and was only restored in 1943.44\n\nAlthough this criticism was mild, the response from the economist, Social Democrat, and editor of Tiden, Gunnar Myrdal, was unequivocal. He stressed that Sweden had a good conscience and its inhabitants had nothing to reproach themselves for. In his ‘peculiar article’, featuring an outside expert’s ‘cold analysis’, Hopper had not taken sufficient account of the fact that Sweden had ‘by and large skilfully played our role and safeguarded our interests without harming those of others’. There had been no lack of courage and risk-taking. The Swedish concessions to Nazi Germany had been ‘unavoidable’ and no greater ‘than necessity demanded’.45 Sweden’s Minister for Foreign Affairs made himself the spokesman of a similar view: ‘The intrinsic value that Undén primarily perceived in the policy of neutrality was the neutral state existing as an oasis beyond the world conflict’, summarizes historian Sten Ottosson.46\n\nSweden’s prevailing foreign policy continued to be defended in Tiden, where issues related to the nation’s neutral position in a polarized Cold War climate were regularly discussed during the immediate post-war decades.47 This stance helped ensure that neutrality and its visual expressions, such as soldiers standing on guard somewhere in Sweden, continued to be widely accepted in the decades that followed. It has been aptly said that in modern Sweden, memories of war were consigned ‘down to the dark and fearful cellars of the subconscious’.48 Thus, with the exception of the immediate post-war years, when participation in Western or Nordic defence cooperation was being discussed, the Swedish ideal of neutrality persisted largely unchallenged throughout the following decades. One consequence of this was that Sweden was repeatedly portrayed as a nation periodically surrounded, trapped, and squeezed between competing great powers and disparate social systems. The Second World War had taught Sweden the need for far-reaching flexibility and the necessity of adapting to prevailing realities and buying time, for instance by making use of influential figures such as Marcus Wallenberg, who had been sent to negotiate with the Western Allies and had helped to avert an emerging conflict with Britain early in the war.49\n\nThe rhetoric aimed at the outside world both during and after the Second World War was dominated by an emphasis on Sweden’s continued independence in the form of neutrality and non-alignment. As Undén explained, it also involved representing a policy of independence according to which Sweden could stand for freedom and democracy and criticize anti-democratic forces. The dilemma was that such statements must not collide with Sweden’s non-aligned foreign policy, which was based on friendship with all other nations whatever their form of government. Accordingly, the 1948 Social Democratic Party Congress resulted in two separate statements: one in which the Congress ‘supported the government’s policy of being friends with all [and] one in which it declared how deeply it detested some of those friends’.50 One consequence of this foreign-policy balancing act was a long period of caution in Sweden’s relations with the two superpowers, but it also resulted in a distanced view of much of Europe. Post-war changes in how Swedish foreign policy was regarded saw strict neutrality giving way to a more active, and occasionally activist, perspective on the outside world. Sweden’s growing international involvement was only marginally directed at its immediate neighbourhood and the rest of Europe and all the more at newly independent nations in Africa and Asia. It was felt that unifying Sweden’s far-off foreign policy and aid policy could offer greater opportunities for both a political reorientation and a distancing from the alliance politics that dominated close at hand in Europe.51\n\nAlthough this may seem paradoxical at first glance, the ideal of neutrality could be applied to Folke Bernadotte and Raoul Wallenberg. At an early point in time, it became the established view that they were special and profoundly honourable because they had voluntarily left Sweden for risky missions in war-torn Europe. Although neutrality was highly valued, their achievements were appreciated because they had chosen to forgo the tranquillity of life at home in order to help people in need. Texts about Wallenberg’s case repeatedly emphasized that he, as a Swede taking an active part in war-torn Hungary, had increased Soviet suspicion. The Soviets found it unlikely that Wallenberg would have left safe, neutral Sweden for brutal Budapest merely to save human lives. As already pointed out, the Soviet secret service believed this claim was a cover for espionage activities.52 An editorial in the newspaper Arbetet in 1957 sums up this mindset well: ‘Wallenberg’s fate stands forth in all its tragedy as symbolic of small, neutral, humanitarian-focused Sweden’s contribution to the Second World War.’ The writer concluded that the Swedish diplomat had been part of the conflict but had persevered with his peaceful humanitarian mission.53\n\nSweden’s non-combative modern history thus created the setting for a narrative of progress characterized by the idea that neutrality was not only a legal and security-orientated concept; it also encompassed aspects of culture, emotion, and mentality. Neutrality developed into an ideal for the past, the present, and the future. Perceived as the foundation of Swedish modernity and Swedish prosperity, neutrality – as aptly summarized by historian Alf W. Johansson – became ‘a state of mind’.54\n\nRaoul Wallenberg in the wake of the Second World War\n\nSe [‘Look’] was Sweden’s first picture magazine, founded in 1938 and inspired by the US magazines Life and Look and the British Picture Post. The cover of the first issue in August 1945 featured Margit Symo, ‘a fiery dancer of genuine Hungarian descent’, kneeling and aiming a bow and arrow at an unknown target. It was particularly striking that she did so without a stitch on her body. But it was not just her beauty, background as a dancer and film actress, or willingness to take off her clothes that made Se’s editors want to put her on the cover. She was, readers were informed, none other than Hungary’s answer to the First World War spy Mata Hari. Because Symo was liked by the Germans and skilfully kept on good terms with them, she had on several occasions managed to convey information to the Swedish Legation in Budapest about where and when pogroms against the city’s Jews would take place. The ‘beautiful photo reportage’ did indeed mention Raoul Wallenberg, but only in passing: according to Symo, his disappearance might be explained by his being murdered by the Nazis.55\n\nOn the one hand, it is tempting to regard the report on Symo as a one-off piece with an unpleasant aftertaste. The mass murder of Budapest’s Jews became the backdrop for Symo’s peripheral rescue contribution, whose truth was impossible to prove but which gained its ‘news value’ from the combination of female spy and nudity. Attention, both in text and pictures, focused entirely on the cheerfully posing nude dancer who had been ‘a saving angel’ in Budapest. The interview with Symo, who later became a well-known actress in West Germany, was spiced up with details of her dramatic escape to Sweden aboard a Red Cross ship carrying prisoners of war, and with the plans for her forthcoming ‘show film’. The film would present her as the Swedish-Hungarian equivalent of another exotic, sensual, and ‘ethnic’ figure, the musical star Carmen Miranda.\n\nOn the other hand, the story about Symo adheres to a pattern. Wallenberg’s achievements – and disappearance – became known in the spring of 1945. In a large double-spread article in Dagens Nyheter on 6 March 1945, a Hungarian who had made his way to Sweden via an adventurous journey through Germany told Swedish readers about a ‘Swedish feat in Hungary’. His detailed account had great credibility, asserted the journalist who conducted the interview. The highest praise was due to Valdemar Langlet and Raoul Wallenberg, and in particular the latter’s efforts to save human lives. The writer stressed that Wallenberg had received sterling assistance at the Legation, but his indomitable will, and his ability to ‘take the bull by the horns’ in order to persuade the Arrow Cross leaders to respect the Swedish protective passports issued to Jews, was admirable, not least given that he had received death threats and that ‘armed gangsters’ had been sent out to impede or even prevent his work. The tribute continued the next day in a shorter version, with a correction, as Wallenberg had been given the title of attaché instead of secretary to the Legation.56 An article in Expressen, a daily newspaper founded as late as 1944, also extolled Wallenberg’s efforts. A brief presentation began by saying that he was undoubtedly ‘a clever lad’ who had saved thousands of Jews ‘from death and concentration camps’. The writer went on to sketch some milestones in his career and concluded by saying that he was ‘known as a pleasant young man’. A longer article in the same paper also praised his contribution. His achievements implicitly contributed to spreading Swedish goodwill, as manifested in the many thank-you messages from all over the world addressed to his mother. At the same time, the journalist expressed concern that Wallenberg had disappeared without a trace. The latest news was undeniably bleak. The possibility that he was still alive ‘must be regarded as doubtful’.57\n\nThe arrival in Stockholm in April that same year of the Swedish envoy Ivan Danielsson and his colleagues was another reminder of the Swedish efforts in Budapest. Before coming home they had been taken from the Hungarian capital to Moscow. At first their return did not direct any attention to Wallenberg’s situation. Instead, when one of those rescued was given the opportunity to speak, she expressed great gratitude for the way everyone at the Swedish Legation had been protected in Hungary, which had resulted in her being able to come to ‘that paradise of peace and light called Sweden’.58\n\nIn May, Se published a photo reportage under the headline ‘The Budapest Legation – a stronghold in battle’. The opening text included a description of the Swedish endeavour to rescue Budapest’s Jews, albeit without going into the practical details, and of the fierce battle against the antisemitic Arrow Cross members who had entered the Legation on Christmas Eve. The ensuing photo spread, featuring photographs of one of ‘those who were there’ in the autumn of 1944, portrayed the Legation staff’s vulnerable situation during the city’s last months in German hands and ‘how even the diplomats had to defend themselves with weapons in their hands against fighting desperados’.59 The individuals named in Se’s photo reportage were Lars G:son Berg, Margareta Bauer, and the Save the Children representative Asta Nilsson, called ‘Budapest’s angel’.60 As in previous articles, the focus lay on the Swedish Legation’s collective work, although the efforts of Ivan Danielsson, Wallenberg, and Per Anger did receive special mention.\n\nNot surprisingly, the best-informed accounts were to be found in Jewish periodicals such as the British The Jewish Chronicle and the Swedish Judisk Krönika [the title also means ‘Jewish chronicle’]. During the war, writers for these journals provided well-informed accounts of the ongoing genocide, stating where, how, and to what extent it was occurring. It was in these magazines, which had a much smaller readership than many daily newspapers and weeklies, that the fullest descriptions of the work done by Wallenberg and the other Budapest Swedes were published. Judisk Krönika also drew attention to the significance of a letter from King Gustaf V to Admiral Miklos Horthy, in which the Swedish King made it clear to the Hungarian head of state what the consequences would be after the war if no action was taken to halt the deportations of Hungarian Jews. The writer also highlighted the Red Cross efforts in the spring of 1945.61\n\nAt the end of 1946, the issue of Raoul Wallenberg’s disappearance was discussed in the Riksdag, the Swedish Parliament, for the first time. It was brought up again the following year, but at that point there was still no sign of the great dissatisfaction with the government’s actions that soon came to characterize the case.62 Articles about Wallenberg were published fairly regularly in newspapers and magazines in the immediate post-war years, and public demonstrations in his memory were held at irregular intervals in the late 1940s. In 1947, Riksdag members Bertil von Friesen, Ture Nerman, and Vilhelm Lundstedt nominated Wallenberg for the Nobel Peace Prize. Supporters of the nomination included Albert Einstein, but it did not win the approval of the Swedish government, which was necessary if a candidate was to be considered.63 That same year, some of the people involved in trying to discover his fate founded a Raoul Wallenberg Committee. In the years that followed he was portrayed as ‘the spiritual monument’ whose ‘noble features’ personified a Swedish humanitarian tradition.64 Soon after it became known that he had been abducted by Soviet troops, meetings were arranged with the main aim of putting pressure on Minister for Foreign Affairs Östen Undén and staff at the UD to discover his fate in Soviet hands and to secure his release and return to Sweden. One such meeting in the Stockholm Concert Hall in the summer of 1948 was estimated to have attracted about 1,000 people.65 It is therefore incorrect to assert that there was a lack of public debate in Sweden from 1945 onwards and that an active rejection of commemorative efforts resulted in ‘more than 30 years of near silence’ about Wallenberg and his achievements.66\n\nFrom time to time, indeed, the Wallenberg affair – or case, as it came to be called – gained a particularly prominent place in the Swedish public sphere. Wallenberg’s relatives, as well as politicians, commentators, and journalists periodically returned to the topic of what he had achieved during the Second World War and what had happened to him since. He was certainly missing, and possibly dead, but this ‘agent of love for humanity’ and his contribution were still fondly remembered.67 Wallenberg continued to be a symbol, declared Mia Leche Löfgren some ten years after his disappearance, because he ‘was a hero of peace, a figure of light in a dark and evil time’.68\n\nThe Wallenberg case not only left its mark on political discussions in the Riksdag and the op-ed pages of newspapers. In the 1960s and 1970s, the authors Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö enjoyed great success with their police-detective novels, which contained recurring elements of social critique. When they located part of the plot of their 1966 novel The Man Who Went Up in Smoke in what they regarded as a friendly and open Budapest, far removed from Cold War notions of a brutal and repressive Communist-run Hungary, it was a short step to a reminder of what had happened in the city some twenty years earlier. When policeman Martin Beck agrees to find a missing man, the Swedish State Secretary instructs him on the importance of history not repeating itself. The last thing Sweden needs, the novel’s politician asserts, is yet another Wallenberg case.69\n\nAs we know, however, remembrance always walks hand in hand with oblivion. The closely related question is therefore whether or not people and events in the past have obtained the recognition and the posthumous reputation that they deserve.70 In the early years of the twenty-first century, the endeavour of Valdemar Langlet and his wife, Nina, to rescue Jews in Budapest has attracted some attention, but Langlet has also been categorized as ‘one of the forgotten ones’.71 However, the Langlets were by no means totally ignored after the war. One example is a 1979 series of television programmes entitled När kriget kom [‘When the war came’], in which one episode dealt with the Langlets’ efforts in Budapest in 1944–1945. The episode did not appeal to television reviewer Kerstin Hallert, whose main objection was that some relevant aspects had been downplayed. To begin with, there was a tendency to highlight the Langlets’ contributions at the expense of Raoul Wallenberg, because it was implied that the latter only assisted Jews with business connections and/or relatives in Sweden, whereas the Langlets wanted to save all those in need, whatever their ethnicity and status. Hallert found it upsetting that Wallenberg, who, unlike the Langlets, ‘had been left behind’, was only mentioned in a concluding interview with Per Anger. Hallert was also indignant that the programme producer, Sonja Pleijel, who was known for her ‘anything but anti-Soviet attitude’, and the rest of the programme crew had neglected to present how the Soviets had conducted themselves – conduct that had been particularly reprehensible in the Wallenberg case.72 Pleijel countered by observing that while Valdemar and Nina Langlet had indeed been able to return and had been helped, unlike Raoul Wallenberg, they had soon been forgotten. It was in order to highlight their achievements to the public that the programme focused on their actions rather than on Wallenberg’s.73\n\nThe failure of diplomacy\n\nWhile the Second World War was still going on, not many people in Sweden outside the UD knew what Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues at the Swedish Legation were doing in Budapest. One of those who did know, and who did his best to stay updated, was the diplomat Sven Grafström. Like Wallenberg, he has been remembered in the historical narrative for his courageous actions during the Second World War. During the German attack on Poland in 1939, Grafström had evacuated diplomats and other foreign nationals from Warsaw under difficult circumstances. While Wallenberg was carrying out his mission in Budapest, Grafström was stationed at the UD in Stockholm. His diaries, which were considered to contain so much sensitive information that they remained unpublished for 34 years, show that even UD staff had difficulty in obtaining information. On 29 December 1944, he wrote that Danielsson had gone into hiding and Wallenberg was being persecuted by the Arrow Cross. However, this information did not come from the Swedish Legation, because contact with Budapest had been broken. Instead, the information came from a German source.74 Lennart Petri, who took over the investigations about Wallenberg in 1946, noted that it was only in July 1945 that he gained access to ‘a detailed account of what had happened in Budapest’.75 In other cases, too, it proved difficult to clarify what had happened to other missing persons in Budapest, as well as in other parts of Eastern Europe that had come under Soviet control.76 For example, a meeting between a Swedish UD official and the Finnish ambassador at the end of the war in Europe revealed how hard it was to obtain reliable information. Not only was the fate of the Swedes who had been operating in Berlin unclear. The Swiss chargé d’affaires in Budapest had disappeared as well. Also, there was still no information about what had happened to Wallenberg after he had ‘“saved himself” by going across to the Russians’. The frustration was not lessened by the fact that Swedish enquiries to Soviet officials continued to go unanswered.77\n\nThe difficulties in obtaining information did not improve significantly after the war in Europe ended. Later estimates suggest that as many as 40 million people had become displaced persons. Many of them were living in dire circumstances while trying to discover the fate of missing family members, relatives, and friends, often to no avail.78 In Eastern Europe, these problems were compounded by the deportations carried out by the Soviet security police. In Hungary alone, 750,000 civilians were sent to temporary camps before being transported to the Gulag to join hundreds of thousands of their compatriots captured by the Red Army on the Eastern Front.79 It was thus hard to obtain information about people who had disappeared for various reasons during the war. This was particularly true of Budapest, where Wallenberg was one of several Swedes who had disappeared. However, the Swedish diplomat was not just an ordinary displaced person. He had been sent on an official mission, he had diplomatic status, and he had friends and acquaintances who had contacted the Swedish authorities for answers but had received no clarification as to whether there was any information about him at the UD or any other Swedish authority. The frustration at the difficulty of obtaining information through official channels caused at least one of Wallenberg’s relatives, who lived in Denmark, to contact Folke Bernadotte, who was Vice Chairman of the Swedish Red Cross, in July 1945, to ask about the possibility of travelling to Budapest in order to make enquiries on the spot.80 Valdemar Langlet, who had remained in the Hungarian capital after its capture by the Red Army, was also unable to obtain credible information. It could not be ruled out that Wallenberg, who had been declared an outlaw by the Arrow Cross in December 1944, had been lured into a trap, but rumours suggested that he might just as easily have been abducted to Germany as to the Soviet Union. That Wallenberg might have been murdered by the Arrow Cross or abducted by the Germans were scenarios repeatedly mentioned as possibilities by Swedish-Soviet contacts in the immediate post-war years.81\n\nAn alley cat among the purebreds\n\nA Swedish diplomat who had been a member of the pro-socialist ‘red gang’ of young radicals within the UD in the 1960s and 1970s later wrote a retrospective account eulogizing his boss, Per Anger. Not only had Anger supported them through thick and thin; the fact that he and Wallenberg had acted largely outside the rules and protocols in Budapest also made him appear more of a revolutionary than the gang members were.82 This view echoes a common description of Wallenberg, Anger, and Valdemar Langlet, who had all acted outside the normal boundaries in an exceptional manner and had courageously defied authority both among their own ranks and in their opponents’.83 That Wallenberg, who was a dynamic and, in many ways, unconventional individual, was not a trained diplomat but had become one ad hoc owing to the mission he undertook in 1944, plus the fact that he came from a country with a conformist culture, further helped to highlight the distance between him and the professional diplomats.84 His attire – he is said to have arrived in Budapest wearing a windbreaker, a simple hat, and a rucksack – was unlike that of a diplomat, as was his unwillingness to deal with ‘all kinds of bureaucracy’.85 Wallenberg’s actions provoked many of his fellow diplomats. A number of them opined that he had broken the unwritten rules of how a diplomat should behave.\n\nIn 1949, Lars G:son Berg assessed Wallenberg’s record in his book Boken som försvann: Vad hände i Budapest. Withdrawn for unclear reasons, the book was republished in 1983. Berg’s assessment was retained in the Swedish reissue but edited out in the 1990 English-language version, entitled The Book That Disappeared: What Happened in Budapest. Berg stressed that Wallenberg’s contributions had been enormous but also noted that his colleague’s tendency to go to extremes had been problematic. Wallenberg’s actions had forced the head of mission, Ivan Danielsson, to take measures he did not want to take; besides, said Berg, they had contributed to UD officials in Stockholm receiving a less than accurate description of what was happening in the Hungarian capital. Berg’s ambivalent attitude was expressed as follows: ‘I admire Raoul more than any other human being. That is not to say that I always approved of all his actions in Budapest, which might sometimes have been downright dangerous for purely Swedish interests.’86\n\nWallenberg’s stubborn and idealistic drive to succeed was certainly laudable because it helped to save many Jews. However, in retrospect it has been claimed that he kept acting foolhardily, egotistically, and ruthlessly. This was particularly true of his deliberate bypassing of his boss, Danielsson, who advocated a less defiant policy towards the Germans and the Hungarian Arrow Cross.87 Such unconventional and controversial behaviour probably contributed to Wallenberg’s not being well regarded by the officials of the government ministry charged with finding him and securing his release. To Wallenberg, acting outside protocol was probably of minor importance, because he did not primarily regard himself as a Swedish diplomat. His main activity was humanitarian, and he was in Hungary on behalf of the War Refugee Board. One result may well have been that the UD did not regard Wallenberg as ‘one of its own’ and therefore assigned lower priority to his case.88\n\nSoviet smokescreens\n\nThere are several other likely explanations for the lack of interest and concrete action in the Wallenberg case. One is linked to the messages received by Staffan Söderblom and others from the Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Vladimir Dekanozov, who had a background in the Soviet secret service and close ties with NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria. In response to an enquiry about Wallenberg, Dekanozov informed Söderblom that the Swedish Legation was safe in the western part of Budapest and measures had been taken to protect Wallenberg. A similar reassuring message was conveyed by the Soviet ambassador to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontay. Over a number of years she had established good contacts among the Swedish elite, including with several members of the Wallenberg family, whom she had met in the early 1930s. When she assured UD staff in Stockholm in January 1945 that Wallenberg was in safe Soviet custody, it was therefore a highly credible statement. She was probably unaware of the Soviet leadership’s reasons for arresting him. Her continued enquiries with Moscow about his fate caused irritation and may have been the reason why she was not allowed to remain in the ambassadorial post in Stockholm. The likelihood of her being kept in the dark, combined with her reassuring message, probably contributed to several months passing without any Swedish request being made that the Soviet authorities should return Wallenberg to his homeland without delay.\n\nIt was not until the end of April 1945 that Staffan Söderblom contacted Dekanozov again. By then, a reply with a different content had begun to take shape. The Soviets maintained that Wallenberg had had contact with Red Army soldiers; however, he had soon driven off in a car and had then died somewhere in Hungary under unclear circumstances.89 Another Soviet tactic was to avoid responding to Swedish enquiries. This silence was one reason why UD staff continued to seek answers from Moscow through official channels, trying to interpret Soviet actions (as well as the lack of them) as best they could. At the same time, however, they began to search elsewhere for clues to Wallenberg’s disappearance, in particular via more or less credible witnesses who claimed to have information about him.90\n\nReasons of a partly different nature have to do with financial considerations. One of these was tied to Swedish-Soviet trade relations and what was known as the ‘billion-kronor loan’. Back in the early 1920s, the Social Democrats had suggested making a loan to the Soviet Union, but the proposal was rejected by the Riksdag. So was a similar proposal ten years later, after Marcus Wallenberg the Elder had warned of too great a risk and too low an interest rate. In 1944, Swedish-Soviet financial negotiations resumed again. The idea that these talks would have led to Stalin ordering the kidnapping of Raoul Wallenberg in order to exert pressure on the Swedish government was dismissed by the commission of enquiry into his case. The notion has since been revived by historian Peter Axelsson, though. He does not dismiss the possibility that one relevant factor while Stalin and Söderblom were discussing Wallenberg in Moscow in 1946 was indeed the concurrent negotiations over the billion-kronor loan by Sweden’s Social Democratic government, a government whose motives in this regard were political rather than financial. If it had transpired that the missing Swede was sitting imprisoned in the Soviet Union, the billion-kronor loan would have been politically impossible; moreover, the scheme would have denigrated the reputations of its main proponents.91\n\nAnother financial aspect of Wallenberg’s disappearance which has been used to explain the feeble and belated Swedish response is based on a story launched soon after his disappearance. The tale claimed that he was carrying a large sum of money and that the fuel tank of his Studebaker was filled with gold and gemstones belonging to Jews who wanted to save their valuables from the plundering Arrow Cross, Germans, and Russians.92 This story, which has popped up intermittently, has in recent years been dismissed as Soviet propaganda, not least because such a scenario invited the conclusion, favourable to the Soviets, that Wallenberg had been murdered as part of a robbery in Hungary.93 This conclusion is very reasonable, but it needs to be placed in the context of accusations made against Swedish embassy personnel in the years around the end of the war. A handful of them were accused of having acted for their own benefit by trading on the black market or exploiting vulnerable individuals. The UD took these accusations seriously. If Wallenberg had turned out to have been guilty of a similar crime, it would probably have been difficult to go on the offensive against Moscow.\n\nLobbying by Wallenberg’s relatives and US proposals\n\nEven after the Soviet abduction of Wallenberg, American interest in his case was considerable. When Swedish newspapers printed articles about the Swedish diplomat’s activities in Budapest, the articles became the subject of diplomatic correspondence.94 Wallenberg’s achievements were also reported to American readers. In April 1945, The New York Times published an article that highlighted his actions and also discussed his abrupt and unexplained disappearance from the Hungarian capital.95 By all accounts, the brothers Marcus and Jacob Wallenberg were keen to gain clarity about Raoul’s disappearance, but Wallenberg’s half-brother, Guy von Dardel, was extremely active. He tried to win US support for Wallenberg’s cause by travelling to the United States in the spring of 1947, hoping to meet Harry S. Truman to gain his support in the search for Wallenberg. No such meeting with the President materialized, but von Dardel did write a number of letters to high-ranking Americans and managed to get a letter published in The Washington Post.96 In addition, Wallenberg’s mother worked behind the scenes to gain support from influential Americans. In late November 1946, Maj von Dardel wrote a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt in which she stressed that thousands of Hungarian Jews had been saved by her son, who had worked on behalf of both ‘the swedish king and the american president [sic]’. Maj von Dardel was keen for her letter to be published, so that the American public could help shape opinion in favour of Raoul Wallenberg and his release. Another hope she had was that Eleanor Roosevelt might consider chairing an American Raoul Wallenberg Association.97\n\nMost of Maj von Dardel’s hopes remained unfulfilled, but after two months Eleanor Roosevelt forwarded the letter to the US State Department and to Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Union’s UN ambassador and later long-time Minister of Foreign Affairs. George Warren, the US adviser on refugee affairs, was careful to express his admiration for Wallenberg’s achievements but added that according to the last report of October 1945, the Swede had left Budapest for Debrecen in March of that year, after which all traces had ceased. Warren’s comment was: ‘It does not appear that any official action can be taken until some clue as to his whereabouts is received.’98 Soviet records of correspondence between the Soviets and the Americans indicate that the von Dardel visit did not go unnoticed, but no directives came from Moscow about possible countermeasures.99 Unsurprisingly, Gromyko’s reply to Eleanor Roosevelt was non-committal. He had forwarded Maj von Dardel’s letter to the Soviet Consulate General ‘for taking appropriate measures’.100\n\nGuy von Dardel’s lobbying may have contributed to the hope-inducing expressions of admiration for Wallenberg’s achievements that came from Americans in the public sphere. One of the world’s most widely circulated magazines, the Reader’s Digest, extolled the Swedish diplomat. He had been snatched away from those he had rescued, which was both a tragedy and the basis of a legend.101 In an article in The Boston Globe and in a letter to the former Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace, the influential newspaper and radio journalist Dorothy Thompson appealed to Wallace for help to find out what had happened to Wallenberg. Thompson further affirmed that the US government would do everything in its power to clarify the fate of the Swede who had heeded Franklin D. Roosevelt’s plea for humanitarian action in a desperate situation. She was convinced that there had been some kind of mistake which the Soviet authorities would surely be willing to rectify.102\n\nWallace did as Thompson asked him, but he received no answer from the Soviets.103 Thompson was not content to urge Wallenberg’s cause in the press. Twice in 1947, she appealed to Eleanor Roosevelt and asked her to contact Stalin. The former First Lady made it clear that she had no influence over the Soviet leadership and that she could do nothing beyond what she had already done in contacting Gromyko.104 That same year, Elisabeth Bailey – the wife of Roger Bailey, one of Raoul Wallenberg’s architecture instructors from the University of Michigan – contacted Guy von Dardel and told him that she had informed the Senator for Michigan, Arthur Vanderberg, about the case.105 Vanderberg in turn contacted diplomat Dean Acheson, who was then Deputy Secretary of State and became Secretary of State two years later. Acheson replied that the US government would like to exert pressure on its Soviet counterpart, but to do so required the initiative of the Swedish authorities. He sent a similar reply to Guy and Maj von Dardel, who had written to both him and Vanderberg.106\n\nÖsten Undén, Staffan Söderblom, and the Raoul Wallenberg case\n\nWhen Iver Olsen reported to the War Refugee Board in 1944, he noticed a tension between the UD and Wallenberg, who had ‘jumped in with too big a splash’. The latter’s energetic efforts did not appear to be appreciated by the people who preferred traditional diplomatic methods, but those methods had not helped the vulnerable Jews. One US commentator predicted that the Swedish diplomat would not be met with gratitude back home despite the help he had given.107 This turned out to be essentially true. While Wallenberg was still operating in Budapest, John Pehle, who headed the effort at the War Refugee Board, had written to thank the Swede for the great work he had done.108 Representatives of the War Refugee Board continued to display a strong involvement on Wallenberg’s behalf. They requested – and received – help from the US Embassy in Moscow in their attempts to uncover Wallenberg’s fate.109 However, it took several months before the US decision-makers ultimately responsible for Wallenberg, Secretary of State Edward Stettinius and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr, were informed. The US offer to assist in the investigation was not sent to the Swedish Foreign Minister but to Staffan Söderblom, the Swedish ambassador in Moscow. He, in turn, did not pass on the US requests for Swedish pressure in the matter to Stockholm. He also dismissed the offers of US assistance made by the US ambassador in Moscow, Averell Harriman, ‘and not even politely’, as one later commentator acerbically observed.110\n\nForeign Minister Östen Undén also remained cool when it came to contacts with Western countries. In a 1947 meeting with representatives of the then newly formed Wallenberg Committee, he expressed strong doubts that a Soviet minister could possibly be making untrue statements. He further questioned whether the Committee members would have been equally suspicious if the opposite party had been the United States. Other participants in the meeting dismissed this comparison because the United States was a democratic country that offered opportunities for monitoring and follow-up.111\n\nEvidently Undén was not personally influenced by the shift from German towards American influence that had taken place in Sweden after the Second World War, particularly in cultural respects. In the early years of the war, he had made a name for himself as an independent truthteller who paid little heed to tactical considerations; one example is provided by his repeated objections to the German transit transports through Sweden. This, then, was a man who ‘operated above party affiliations’.112 His position within the Social Democratic movement was a powerful one, and he had the support of the Prime Minister, Tage Erlander, who regarded him as the most astute member of the government.113 He also won the appreciation of many women Social Democrats during the divisive internal battle over whether or not Sweden should become a nuclear-weapons nation. Like Erlander, Undén supported the Social Democratic Women’s League, which campaigned for a ‘no’ vote.114 Despite recurring criticism of how he handled the 1945 to 1946 extradition of the Balts and the Wallenberg case, his time as Minister for Foreign Affairs between 1945 and 1962 was often portrayed in a favourable light. In 1969, when the newspaper Expressen named the most important Swedes of the twentieth century – a list, incidentally, which did not include either Folke Bernadotte or Raoul Wallenberg – Undén was accorded the honorary title of ‘Mr. Neutrality’.115 When his biography was written some 15 years later, renewed emphasis was placed on his achievement in steering a free Sweden between the East and the West. The author did not conceal his admiration for the former Foreign Minister; the biography was intended to be a tribute to a Swedish politician of international stature.116\n\nWhile he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, Undén’s critics argued that he was by no means neutral. A few years after the war, the eminent Swedish publicist and political scientist Herbert Tingsten made it clear why his earlier appreciation of Undén had turned into its opposite. Tingsten’s criticism was not softened when he learned of the minister’s more or less favourable statements about North Korea and East Germany or his willingness to vouch for Soviet excuses regarding what had happened to Raoul Wallenberg.117 One possible explanation for Undén’s statements is that they might have been uttered as part of the internal struggle over foreign policy which took place in Sweden in the immediate post-war years. A number of diplomats and senior military officers, as well as Liberal and Conservative politicians, were critical of Undén and desired a relaxation of the policy of neutrality so as to enable a rapprochement with the Western powers. Undén vigorously opposed such proposals.118 Instead, his policy was one of demonstrably distancing Sweden from the United States. One result of this was that the US proposals concerning Wallenberg did not initially meet with any Swedish interest.119 At the same time, just as Olof Palme did later, Undén declared that non-aligned Sweden was not engaged in ‘inciting hatred of the Soviet Union’. In this respect he was aligning himself with an optimistic view of the neighbour to the east that was held by many Swedes in the immediate post-war years. This attitude lasted longer in Sweden than in many other Western countries, and it was particularly apparent in those who were in charge of Sweden’s foreign policy. It is therefore not surprising that official Sweden wanted neither ‘anti-Americanism nor anti-Sovietism’.120\n\nIn the world of the popular press in the 1950s, pairs of opposites dominated: good-evil, democracy-dictatorship, development-underdevelopment and freedom-oppression. With a few exceptions, the United States was associated with the positive concepts and the Soviet Union with the negative ones.121 In the political debate, in which the Wallenberg case was a recurring bone of contention, the division was less clear-cut. The fact that Rolf Sohlman, a Swedish diplomat with many years of experience in Moscow and an expert on Russia, was on good terms with Undén invited criticism, both within the UD and in the public debate. Such objections often went hand in hand with claims that Undén was ‘too apt to listen to Soviet views’.122 There is reason to maintain that a foreign-policy duel was fought throughout the initial post-war decades. This duel took place partly inside the UD between pro-Western officials – a majority – in one corner and Undén and his supporters in the other,123 and partly in newspaper columns, with Undén and Tingsten as the main adversaries. Against the anti-Communism expressed primarily by Tingsten stood an ‘anti-anti-Communism’, which was particularly conspicuous in the Social Democratic press.124\n\nUnlike Undén, Söderblom had gained a reputation for being accommodating towards German demands even while the Second World War was still going on. Undén’s critics argued that because Sweden’s relations with the Soviet Union were severely strained, it was an unfortunate move to appoint a German ‘collaborationist’ as ambassador to Moscow. This rumour reached Soviet politicians, and according to this view of history, it raised obstacles to Söderblom during his time as Sweden’s envoy in Moscow from 1944 to 1946. There, too, he pursued a policy of accommodation. His colleague Sven Grafström wrote acidly that Söderblom had first genuflected to the south and then to the east.125 Söderblom feared that like his predecessor in the post, Vilhelm Assarsson, he, too, would be deported owing to the frosty relations between Sweden and the Soviet Union.126 The lawyer and author Omi Söderblom draws a somewhat different picture in a comprehensive and well-written 2021 study of her great-uncle Staffan Söderblom and the Wallenberg case. In certain respects, the book – based on new source material – was written with the intention of not assuming a defensive position in her kinsman’s favour. Nevertheless, her book is in many ways a vindication of Staffan Söderblom, a career diplomat held in high esteem by Per Albin Hansson and Östen Undén. He was a key player in the great efforts to keep Sweden out of the Second World War, and he helped to obtain free passage through the Soviet Union for Swedes and other Nordic residents while the fighting was still going on. The blackening of his character, intensified by the link ‘between the mythologizing of Wallenberg and the brutalization of Söderblom’, is due in no small part to a smear campaign led by Grafström, a campaign which resulted in a ‘political stigmatization’. That it took hold and persisted was not least due to the fact that Söderblom’s continued strong involvement in the Wallenberg case contrasted with Undén’s palpable lack of interest.127\n\nWhile this more nuanced depiction of Söderblom is welcome, there are nevertheless good reasons to examine his time as ambassador in Moscow. His policy has been likened to a bridge-building project geared to achieving wide-ranging cooperation between Sweden and the Soviet Union. What Söderblom did not realize was that the Soviet Union was busily constructing a power empire within Europe. In this process, good relations with Sweden were not high on the agenda. Söderblom nonetheless tried to achieve good relations with the authorities in the Kremlin. Among other things, this attitude meant that he downplayed the plundering and other brutal actions committed by Soviet troops in Budapest and Berlin.128 In his memoirs, Per Anger recalled Söderblom’s words in this spirit when Wallenberg’s colleagues and other Swedes from the Legation in Budapest reached Moscow in April 1945: ‘Remember – not one harsh word about the Russians!’129 In recent times, Söderblom’s actions – with their obviously unfavourable consequences for the investigation into Wallenberg’s disappearance – have hence been categorized as ‘passive’ and ‘remarkable’ by Swedish officialdom.130\n\nIn interviews conducted 35 years after his meeting with Stalin, Söderblom insisted that in a meeting with ‘the top man’ – which was to be regarded as ‘an unusual favour’ – it would have been unwise to make accusations against the Soviet authorities. It was of paramount importance to keep the door open for further negotiations and ‘to say nothing that might aggravate the situation’. The main aim was not to provoke the Soviet authorities.131 However, the fact remains that what Söderblom said to Stalin actually weakened the Swedish negotiating position. In the spring of 1945, a rumour had spread that Wallenberg had been killed by Nazi sympathizers in Budapest.132 In his meetings with Soviet politicians and officials, Söderblom espoused this view. He told them he was convinced that Wallenberg had ‘fallen victim to an accident or to bandits’ in Budapest. In June 1946 Söderblom raised the matter with Joseph Stalin, whose ‘voice and look gave the impression of a friendly attitude towards his visitors’. The Swedish ambassador’s sympathetic description of the Red Tsar in his report to his colleagues in Stockholm had the same tone as his account of the meeting during which Söderblom informed the Soviet leader of his own conviction that Wallenberg had been killed in Hungary.133 Söderblom added that it was probable that ‘the Soviet-Russian military authorities have no accessible information about Wallenberg’s further fate’. It was hardly surprising that the Soviet replies to the Swedish enquiries about Wallenberg stated that the Swedish diplomat was not in their country.134\n\nFurthermore, the Swedish government never considered suggesting an exchange of individuals. Switzerland had found itself in a similar situation when two people from its Legation in Budapest were detained by the Red Army. There were two Soviet fighter pilots in Switzerland, and so the idea of an exchange was raised. Discussions took place within the Swiss Foreign Ministry as to whether such an exchange was compatible with the principles of international law and extradition law, but finally an agreement between the Swiss and the Soviets was negotiated towards the end of 1945. The exchange took place the following year.135 Similar exchanges, this time involving spies, later occurred between Italy and Denmark respectively on the one side and the Soviet Union on the other. Swedish embassies monitored similar cases. The Swedish diplomat Gunnar Hägglöf tried to interest Undén in a similar Swedish action, but he was told that ‘Sweden does not want to engage in any “human trafficking”.’136 When Per Anger again raised the idea in the late 1950s, Undén’s response was similar: ‘Swedish governments do not do that sort of thing.’137\n\nRudolph Philipp and the Wallenberg campaign\n\nAlthough Raoul Wallenberg’s achievements and fate were repeatedly highlighted in the daily press and weekly magazines during the immediate post-war period, silence mostly prevailed at the official level. The few and half-hearted efforts by politicians and diplomats to discover the fate of the missing Swedish diplomat have been summed up as ‘too little, too late’.138 In addition, it took time before his actions was officially recognized in Sweden. On Gustaf VI Adolf’s 70th birthday in November 1952, Wallenberg was awarded the Illis Quorum medal for his humanitarian work in Budapest, with the added comment that the award was not posthumous.139 For reasons to which we shall return, it took a few more decades before he was honoured with monuments in Sweden.140\n\nJudging from Undén’s diary entries, he was satisfied with the efforts made in the immediate post-war period to discover Wallenberg’s fate. In the course of the investigation he became convinced that Wallenberg was dead, a view that Gustaf VI Adolf said he shared at a meeting in 1959.141 It should be noted that Undén changed his position about Wallenberg’s fate over time. Following Stalin’s death in 1953, after initially telling people who worked close to him that the missing Swede was probably dead, he began to harbour hopes that Wallenberg might still be alive. After the Soviet announcement in 1957 that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack, Undén told his staff that it was probably true.142 Outwardly, however, he maintained the official Swedish position that the missing Swede could still be a Soviet prisoner.\n\nIn the wake of Nikita Khrushchev’s ‘secret’ speech in 1956 in which he attacked Stalin, hopes rose of learning more about the Gulag prisoners, who had been non-persons during the Red Tsar’s time in power.143 Many people still assumed that Wallenberg was alive, and a number of those who displayed the greatest commitment to his case had only been active in Sweden for a few years. The first director of the Raoul Wallenberg Aid Committee was Eugen Reiz, who was born in Hungary in 1883 and held a doctorate in cultural history from the University of Kraków. He had subsequently worked in Germany but had fled after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933 and arrived in Sweden in 1938. As well as helping the Hungarian refugees who came to Sweden in the last year of the war, until his death in January 1947 Reiz was a driving force when it came to obtaining information about Wallenberg’s fate. Another leading figure was the Austrian-Jewish journalist Rudolph Philipp. He had been a volunteer fighter in the First World War, was politically active, and was involved in trade unions during the interwar period before fleeing to Sweden in the late 1930s, where he mainly earned his living as a fencing instructor.144 Philipp was the first to write a book, published in 1946, about Wallenberg’s achievements in Budapest. In his book as well as in subsequent publications, Philipp levelled scathing criticism at the actions of the Swedish government and the UD.145\n\nWallenberg’s relatives had established a good rapport with Philipp during the interviews on which his book was based. Wallenberg’s stepfather Fredrik and his half-brother Guy von Dardel arranged for the book to be translated into English, then distributed it in manuscript form to the World Jewish Congress, and tried unsuccessfully to have it published by an American publisher.146 Reviews of the book in the Swedish press varied. In addition to describing it in less than flattering terms as a ‘sensational book’, critics pointed out that the first person to draw attention to Wallenberg was not a Swede. Even so, it was clear to them that Philipp was the right man for the job. ‘He is a whole Ministry for Foreign Affairs in himself’, proclaimed one reviewer, adding that Philipp had written a book that no Swede could have managed to write.147\n\nIn the autumn of 1946, Philipp lent the Swedish government the materials on which his book was based. From statements he made at the time, representatives of the government had been convinced by his conclusion that Wallenberg was still alive.148 A few months later, hope increased that an answer would come from Moscow. Prior to Folke Bernadotte’s visit to the Soviet capital, the head of the Soviet Red Cross had responded to an inquiry from Bernadotte about Wallenberg.149 As was the case with Stalin’s promise to Söderblom that there would be further investigation, no answer materialized after the visit.\n\nShortly thereafter new findings were presented. Albert Szent-Györgi, a Hungarian who had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1937 for the discovery of vitamin C, had been forced into hiding in Budapest because as a resistance fighter he had helped Jews flee the country. He was given sanctuary at the Swedish Legation. His son-in-law Györgi Libik worked as Per Anger’s driver and was one of the last people to see Wallenberg before he was taken into Soviet custody. Szent-Györgi was part of a delegation of Hungarian politicians that travelled to Moscow in May 1945, where, like Söderblom, he conducted negotiations with Soviet politicians. Even there and then, Szent-Györgi concluded that there was no Soviet antipathy towards Wallenberg. However, he believed that the missing Swede had met his fate as someone hunted and hated by both the Arrow Cross and the Germans. He maintained this opinion until his death in the United States in 1986.150\n\nSzent-Györgi’s standpoint attracted general attention when he and his compatriot, the publicist Jenő Lévai, who had been rescued by and worked with Elsa Brändström after the First World War and been helped by Wallenberg during the Second World War, spoke out in the summer of 1947 about Wallenberg’s last days in Budapest. Lévai had previously written a book about the Angel of Siberia and had been commissioned by the Hungarian Wallenberg Committee (founded in 1945 but already dissolved by this time) to write a book about Wallenberg. Both Szent-Györgi and Lévai argued that the most likely explanation was that the Swedish diplomat had been killed by Germans or the Arrow Cross, as he was unlikely to have been offered any protection by the Soviets. Lévai referred to a study performed by the Hungarian authorities which he had seen. Among the tens of thousands of Hungarians who had returned from captivity in the Soviet Union, no one had seen or heard of the Swede. However, this conclusion met with stiff opposition, as did statements about ‘how easy it was to die in Hungary’ for anyone who was there in January 1945.151\n\nThe debate becomes heated\n\nOne example of the explosive power of Wallenberg’s case occurred in July 1947, when the Stockholm branch of the Swedish section of the International Women’s Federation for Peace and Freedom, whose members had early on become engaged in trying to discover Wallenberg’s fate, invited Lévai and Szent-Györgi to an evening of discussion about the Swedish diplomat’s disappearance. The meeting, which was reported even by newspapers based outside Stockholm and with very varied ideological affiliations, had a dramatic beginning when it became clear that Szent-Györgi would not participate because he had gone abroad. Lévai did appear, but after reading out his speech translated into Swedish, he made it clear that the extensive material he had collected over two and a half years, comprising thousands of pages and hundreds of witness accounts, could only be examined by specialists. When Lévai dismissed people who were working to prove a preconceived hypothesis, it was obvious that he was referring to Rudolph Philipp, who was also present. Philipp’s response was that Lévai was lying ‘from beginning to end’. After noisy reactions from the audience, Lévai promised to present evidence to an impartial delegation within 36 hours. Before leaving the meeting to travel to Oslo, he presented the documentary find he had made in Budapest: a draft of a Nansen Plan for Hungary allegedly written by Wallenberg. This was rejected by Wallenberg’s fellow diplomat Lars G:son Berg, who had been present at the opening of the bank vault in Budapest where Wallenberg’s belongings had been stored. No document concerning a Nansen Plan had been found there, and there was doubt that the draft referred to by Lévai had even been written by a Swede. Like Philipp, G:son Berg argued against Lévai’s claim that the Arrow Cross or the Germans had murdered Wallenberg, saying that this would have been virtually impossible ‘after he had come under the protection of the Russians’.152 The meeting became ‘a heated debate in the otherwise peaceful Women’s Federation premises’ and ended with ‘a gentle but determined women’s deputation which departed immediately’ in order to renew contact with Lévai.153\n\nIn the wake of the meeting Philipp received praise. Some of those who believed that the answers to the questions about Wallenberg were to be found in Moscow lauded Philipp for his great commitment and comprehensive efforts. Not everyone was satisfied, though. Philipp’s critics questioned his failure to present clear evidence for his thesis.154 An editorial writer for one of the leading evening newspapers had not realized that Philipp was Austrian but described him as a compatriot of Lévai. It must, the writer continued, ‘be regarded as almost macabre that these Hungarians should sit here in Stockholm and air their internal antipathies in public’. What added to the bitter aftertaste was that this was a deeply tragic event which had preoccupied and tormented the Swedish people for over two years, ‘causing bitter disappointment to all the official investigators’.155\n\nUndeterred, Philipp renewed his attack on Lévai. Like Lévai, Philipp had interviewed a number of people in Budapest who had followed Wallenberg’s activities from close quarters. They had distanced themselves from Lévai because they feared what his information, published in a Hungarian book, might lead to as the Soviet Union further tightened its grip on Hungary. Philipp said that this was one of several reasons why they had no confidence in the Hungarian Wallenberg Committee.156\n\nThe controversial nature of the assertion that Wallenberg was dead is also shown by the fact that the Swedish publisher removed the section in the Hungarian edition in which Lévai implied that Wallenberg had died in Budapest. He was asked to write a new version with an ending in which the Swedish diplomat disappears into the unknown. The change did not go unnoticed. The fact that Lévai laconically and abruptly ended his tale on 17 January, Wallenberg’s last day in the Hungarian capital, and did not report on the investigations into what had happened thereafter ‘must be interpreted by the Swedish reader as a necessary and forced political consideration’, one reviewer asserted.157 Another writer stressed that the main reason the book was worth reading was ‘not the merit of the author but that of the subject’. A particularly serious matter was the way in which the Swedish translation had been ‘fiddled and tampered with by means of changes and omissions’ because there were people in Sweden with knowledge of ‘Raoul Wallenberg’s subsequent fate’ that collided with Lévai’s claims. Despite the changes made to the Swedish edition, the message from the Hungarian original was still clear, and this satisfied the Soviet authorities. That was less than surprising, since ‘[t]he person who thinks that anyone can sit in Hungary and write anything other than what suits the Soviet power can cast the first stone’.158 Despite such devastating criticism, the first two Swedish editions of the book quickly sold out. But after pressure from Rudolph Philipp and Maj von Dardel, among others, the book was withdrawn and the third edition pulped.159\n\nNew information in October 1947 suggesting that Wallenberg was still alive revived the issue of his disappearance.160 Philipp continued to pursue the matter, renewing his attacks on those who, like the Hungarian Vilmos Böhm, claimed – ‘even though they knew better’ – that the Germans had killed Wallenberg.161 It soon became clear that Philipp was the strong man of the Wallenberg campaign. As time passed, he gained the approval of people who shared his view that the Swedish government was doing too little in the matter, not least because his demands were reasonable in that it was the Soviet Union that was accountable for whatever had happened to Wallenberg, and because – unlike the Swedish government – his starting point was not one of doubt.162\n\nPhilipp vs. pro-Moscow Communists\n\nIn 1945, Philipp made his voice heard in earnest in his new homeland when he published a quasi-autobiography that was very much a showdown with the Czech shoe king Tomáš Bata and his system of exploitation. Under this system, workers became co-owners, but without any obvious benefits as they were encouraged to compete against each other in pursuit of higher production goals while being held responsible for any losses the company might incur.163 Anyone who took a stand alongside the workers in an explicit critique of a capitalist exploitative system might be expected to garner sympathy from the left. This was by no means a given, though. Ten years earlier, Charlie Chaplin had that exact experience when his film Modern Times went from being a project cherished by leading Soviet cultural politicians to a cautionary tale, as his critique of the machine society ran counter to the large-scale investment in heavy industry in the Soviet Union.164 Philipp, too, had previously been on good terms with influential Communists in Moscow. His criticism of Bata led to him being made a guest of honour in the Soviet capital, but the outcome of his elevation was unexpected. At first there had been a consensus that the Bata system was an example of capitalist predation, but the Soviet Communists adopted the basic idea that workers should be encouraged to compete against one another, with prizes for the most successful, regardless of whether they were producing women’s stockings or tractors. Inspired by Bata, the Soviet Union introduced ‘shock workers’, called udarniki, who wore a badge of honour like a medal on their chests. Although Philipp was paid for a new edition of his critical book on the Bata system, it was withdrawn a few weeks later. Nor did the film, intended for export only and with a final scene showing the Soviet flag flying over Bata factories, see the light of day.165\n\nFor Swedish pro-Moscow Communists, this type of criticism was not welcome, and that mindset also coloured their attitude in the Wallenberg case. In the Communist daily paper Ny Dag, it was therefore Jenő Lévai’s opinion that prevailed. The newspaper’s writers sympathized with the idea that Wallenberg had been murdered by the Arrow Cross, which meant that the Soviet Union had nothing to do with his disappearance. Confidence in the authorities in Moscow was also expressed by Ny Dag’s reproducing an argument from the Soviet magazine Novoye Vremya. The gist of that argument was that people from ‘reactionary circles’ were exploiting ‘the tragedy of Raoul Wallenberg’ with the aim of disseminating propaganda against the Soviet Union.166 Ny Dag’s readers were left in no doubt that Rudolph Philipp was one of these reactionaries, and ‘[his] book, based on hearsay and rumour and dictated by counter-revolutionary fervour’, found no favour with the newspaper’s reviewer.167 This censorious tone was echoed when the Riksdag debated Wallenberg’s disappearance in May 1951. ‘The international trickster Philipp’ was one of those who continued to write ‘abusive letters’ as part of an anti-Soviet propaganda campaign.168 It is worth noting that such views were not only expressed in Ny Dag. For example, an editorial writer in the Liberal newspaper Expressen criticized both Philipp and Lévai and ‘the competition’ between them in their unsavoury struggle over the truth about Wallenberg’s fate.169\n\nFor a couple of decades Philipp held a prominent position in the public sphere, claiming time and again that Wallenberg was alive and no effort should be spared to free him. Together with Maj von Dardel and others, he wrote an open letter to Sweden’s Prime Minister in March 1951. The group welcomed a public enquiry announced by Tage Erlander and expressed their good will by explaining that they wanted to avoid the issue becoming subjected to party politics. They had therefore persuaded members of the centre-right opposition not to push the matter any further, so that the government could pursue its efforts to trace the missing Swede in peace. However, they stressed that one thing was already clear: evidence existed according to which the Soviet Union was responsible for Wallenberg’s disappearance.170 In April 1953, encouraged by the testimony of the freed Italian diplomat Claudio de Mohr plus the death of Stalin about a month earlier, Philipp expressed the hope that the Kremlin authorities would do away with their earlier mistakes so that Sweden could have ‘one of her finest sons’ back.171\n\nThe silence from Moscow persisted but Philipp stubbornly maintained his belief that Wallenberg was alive. In 1955, he said that it was wrong to call the Wallenberg case a mystery, as there were numerous testimonies from prisoners who stated that they had either shared a cell with Wallenberg or had had contact with him via tapping. Several returning prisoners from the Soviet Union, of various nationalities, recounted stories of a man called Wallenberg whose conduct was exemplary even in prison and who had instilled courage in them. Their narratives strengthened Philipp’s conviction that the missing Swede was not a forced labourer but rather a privileged prisoner of the state. That view also formed the starting point for the application by Sweden’s ambassador to Moscow, Rolf Sohlman, which underwent an important change before it was sent to Marshal Voroshilov. Maj von Dardel did not wish to ask for a ‘pardon’ for Wallenberg, as that would be tantamount to admitting that he had committed crimes against the Soviet Union. Instead of ‘pardon’, it was ‘justice’ that should be demanded. However, there had been no response to the request. The combative Philipp argued that one factor contributing to the weak response from Moscow was that the official Swedish proposals were too cautiously presented. When the Speaker of the Riksdag’s Second Chamber, Gustaf Nilsson, had met with Bulganin and Voroshilov, Ambassador Sohlman had been hovering ‘like a nursemaid by his side’. That had prevented Nilsson from speaking freely, and as a result his intervention had been ineffective.172 Likewise, it was a recurring problem that the people in charge of Sweden’s government and its foreign policy did not react strongly enough against the ‘agents and provocateurs’ who served the Soviets by spreading false information about what had happened in Budapest in 1944–1945, and who also helped to discredit serious witnesses that had recently come forward.173\n\nWhen, in 1957, the Soviets presented information to the effect that Wallenberg had died in the Lubyanka prison in 1947, Philipp was quick to speak out. The document was ‘a web of fabrications’. It was his firm conviction that Wallenberg was alive, and therefore the fight for his release would continue.174 Philipp continued to be troubled by Östen Undén’s reluctance to exert further pressure. He also criticized those who, for reasons of realpolitik, defended the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ initial wait-and-see position in relation to the Wallenberg case.175 However, after the news from Moscow that Wallenberg had died in 1947, some of Philipp’s most persistent critics were neutralized. Writers in Ny Dag dealt as best they could with the news from the Kremlin, among other things by blaming ‘international businessmen’ who had spread all sorts of stories about the missing diplomat, stories which had resulted in the Swedish government’s investigators repeatedly being led astray. The leader of the Swedish Communist Party, Hilding Hagberg, commended Wallenberg. His achievements had been exemplary, as anti-fascists in all countries agreed. The news of his death was therefore bitter, but it also demonstrated a Soviet determination to ‘liquidate post-war mistakes and ensure the most comprehensive democratization and safeguarding of the laws as well as of the rights of the people’.176 While unwavering loyalty to the authorities in Moscow persisted, the writers in Ny Dag stopped asserting Soviet innocence; instead, they were more than willing to support Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko in 1957 when he declared that as far as the Soviets were concerned, the Wallenberg affair was closed.177 Nor did the Ny Dag journalists see any further reason to write about Philipp.\n\nIn conjunction with discussions about new witness accounts, both in the early and late 1950s, Philipp maintained his conviction that the Swedish diplomat was still in Soviet custody. One new development was that he toned down his criticism of the leaders of Sweden’s foreign policy. That, however, was the calm before the storm. Philipp was one of the driving forces when, in "
