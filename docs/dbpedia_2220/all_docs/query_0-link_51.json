A.\n\n1991-07-01\n\nSubstantial pulse thermal emf values (about 1.5 V) have been detected along the substrate during the interaction of laser emission with thin metal films (Ni, Ti, and Bi) sprayed on corrugated substrates. Relationships are established between the irradiation conditions and parameters of the generated electrical signals. Possible mechanisms of thermal emf generation and promising applications are discussed.\n\nCorrection for Thermal EMFs in Thermocouple Feedthroughs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZiemke, Robert A.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA straightforward measurement technique provides for correction of thermal-electromotive-force (thermal-EMF) errors introduced by temperature gradients along the pins of non-thermocouple-alloy hermetic feedthrough connectors for thermocouple extension wires that must pass through bulkheads. This technique is an alternative to the traditional technique in which the thermal-EMF errors are eliminated by use of custom-made multipin hermetic feedthrough connectors that contain pins made of the same alloys as those of the thermocouple extension wires. One disadvantage of the traditional technique is that it is expensive and time-consuming to fabricate multipin custom thermocouple connectors. In addition, the thermocouple-alloy pins in these connectors tend to corrode easily and/or tend to be less rugged compared to the non-thermocouple-alloy pins of ordinary connectors. As the number of thermocouples (and thus pins) is increased in a given setup, the magnitude of these disadvantages increases accordingly. The present technique is implemented by means of a little additional hardware and software, the cost of which is more than offset by the savings incurred through the use of ordinary instead of thermocouple connectors. The figure schematically depicts a typical measurement setup to which the technique is applied. The additional hardware includes an isothermal block (made of copper) instrumented with a reference thermocouple and a compensation thermocouple. The reference thermocouple is connected to an external data-acquisition system (DAS) through a two-pin thermocouple-alloy hermetic feedthrough connector, but this is the only such connector in the apparatus. The compensation thermocouple is connected to the DAS through two pins of the same ordinary multipin connector that connects the measurement thermocouples to the DAS.\n\nMicrowave frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression.\n\nPubMed\n\nPall, Martin L\n\n2016-09-01\n\nNon-thermal microwave/lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) act via voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation. Calcium channel blockers block EMF effects and several types of additional evidence confirm this mechanism. Low intensity microwave EMFs have been proposed to produce neuropsychiatric effects, sometimes called microwave syndrome, and the focus of this review is whether these are indeed well documented and consistent with the known mechanism(s) of action of such EMFs. VGCCs occur in very high densities throughout the nervous system and have near universal roles in release of neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones. Soviet and Western literature shows that much of the impact of non-thermal microwave exposures in experimental animals occurs in the brain and peripheral nervous system, such that nervous system histology and function show diverse and substantial changes. These may be generated through roles of VGCC activation, producing excessive neurotransmitter/neuroendocrine release as well as oxidative/nitrosative stress and other responses. Excessive VGCC activity has been shown from genetic polymorphism studies to have roles in producing neuropsychiatric changes in humans. Two U.S. government reports from the 1970s to 1980s provide evidence for many neuropsychiatric effects of non-thermal microwave EMFs, based on occupational exposure studies. 18 more recent epidemiological studies, provide substantial evidence that microwave EMFs from cell/mobile phone base stations, excessive cell/mobile phone usage and from wireless smart meters can each produce similar patterns of neuropsychiatric effects, with several of these studies showing clear dose-response relationships. Lesser evidence from 6 additional studies suggests that short wave, radio station, occupational and digital TV antenna exposures may produce similar neuropsychiatric effects. Among the more commonly reported changes are sleep disturbance/insomnia, headache, depression\n\nEUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses.\n\nPubMed\n\nBelyaev, Igor; Dean, Amy; Eger, Horst; Hubmann, Gerhard; Jandrisovits, Reinhold; Kern, Markus; Kundi, Michael; Moshammer, Hanns; Lercher, Piero; MÃ¼ller, Kurt; Oberfeld, Gerd; Ohnsorge, Peter; Pelzmann, Peter; Scheingraber, Claus; Thill, Roby\n\n2016-09-01\n\nChronic diseases and illnesses associated with non-specific symptoms are on the rise.

Very low frequency electric (VLF EF) and magnetic fields (VLF MF) (3 kHz to 3 MHz) are emitted, due to harmonic voltage and current distortions, from electrical wiring, lamps (e.g. compact fluorescent lamps), and electronic devices.

The Lorentz force formula correctly predicts the emf present in the armature but it fails to acknowledge the induction of further emf's in the rails which are proportional to the relative velocity. It is easy to confirm the existence of the additional rail emf's behind and ahead of the armature, by voltage measurements across the muzzle and the breech of the railgun. Neumann's forgotten law of induction, which was first proposed in 1845, correctly accounts for the magnitude and position of all motionally induced emf components in the railgun circuit. The velocity dependent back-emf's in the rails coincide with the Ampere recoil forces in the railheads just behind the armature. Electric power extended in overcoming these back-emf's, and associated with the recoil forces, seem to store elastic strain energy in the rails.\n\nHigh reliability sheathed, beryllia insulated, tungsten-rhenium alloy thermocouple assemblies; their fabrication and EMF stability\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBurns, G. W.; Hurst, W. S.; Scroger, M. G.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nTantalum sheathed, BeO insulated, W-3% Re/W-25% Re thermocouple assemblies were fabricated and their emf drift determined during 2059 hours of exposure at 2073 K in a gaseous helium environment. The sheathed thermocouple assemblies were constructed from aged thermoelements, specially heat-treated BeO insulators, and specially cleaned and etched tantalum sheaths. Their thermal emf drifts ranged from the equivalent of only -0.3 to -0.8 K drift per 1000 hours of exposure at 2073 K. No evidence of any gross chemical attack or degradation of the component materials was found. The emf drift and material behavior of some unsheathed, BeO insulated, W-3% Re/W-25% Re thermocouples at 2250 and 2400 K were also determined. Unsheathed thermocouples tested in an argon environment at 2250 K for 1100 hours and at 2400 K for 307 hours exhibited changes in thermal emf that typically ranged from the equivalent of a few degrees K to as much as +11 K. Post-test examinations of these thermocouples revealed some undesirable material degradation and interaction which included erosion of the BeO insulators and contamination of the thermoelements by tantalum from the tantalum blackbody enclosure in which the thermocouples were contained.\n\nExposure Knowledge and Risk Perception of RF EMF\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFreudenstein, Frederik; Wiedemann, Peter M.; Varsier, NadÃ¨ge\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe presented study is part of the EU-Project Low EMF Exposure Future Networks (LEXNET), which deals among other things with the issue of whether a reduction of the radiofrequency (RF) electro-magnetic fields (EMF) exposure will result in more acceptance of wireless communication networks in the public sphere. We assume that the effects of any reduction of EMF exposure will depend on the subjective link between exposure perception and risk perception (RP). Therefore we evaluated respondentsâ RP of different RF EMF sources and their subjective knowledge about various exposure characteristics with regard to their impact on potential health risks. The results show that participants are more concerned about base stations than about all other RF EMF sources. Concerning the subjective exposure knowledge the results suggest that people have a quite appropriate impact model. The question how RF EMF RP is actually affected by the knowledge about the various exposure characteristics was tested in a linear regression analysis. The regression indicates that these features â except distance â do influence peopleâs general RF EMF RP. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the quality of exposure knowledge on RF EMF RP of various sources. The results show a tendency that better exposure knowledge leads to higher RP, especially for mobile phones. The study provides empirical support for models of the relationships between exposure perception and RP. It is not the aim to extrapolate these findings to the whole population because the samples are not exactly representative for the general public in the participating countries.

G.\n\n2000-06-01\n\nIn this paper, theoretical comparison between electromagnetic dampers based on a âmotional emfâ and âtransformer emfâ design is presented. Transformer emf devices are based on the generation of emf in a stationary circuit, in which the emf is generated by a time-varying magnetic field linking the circuit. Motional emf devices are based on the generation of emf due to a moving conductor within a stationary magnetic field. Both of these designs can be used as damping elements for applications such as semi-active and regenerative vehicle suspension systems. The findings herein are provided so as to evaluate the most efficient device for such applications. The analysis consists of comparing the damping coefficient of the electromagnetic devices for a given magnetic field and given volume of conducting material. It has been found that for a limited range of dimensions, the transformer emf devices can be more then 1Â·2 times as efficient as the motional emf devices. However, for most realistic situations, motional emf devices will have the highest efficiency.\n\nA Simple Demonstration of Back emf\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTurner, Lou\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn discussing motors, one college textbook says, \"As the coil (of a motor) rotates in a magnetic field, a back emf is generated that tends to counter the emf that supplies the current.\" This is a true statement, but it does little to enhance student understanding of how and why it is created.

The topic will likely remain for the foreseeable future on the scientific and political agenda, since emissions continue to change in characteristics and levels due to new infrastructure deployments, smart environments and novel wireless devices. Until now, systematic and coordinated efforts to monitor EMF exposure are rare. Furthermore, virtually nothing is known about personal exposure levels. This lack of knowledge is detrimental for any evidence-based risk, exposure and health policy, management and communication. The main objective of the paper is to review the current state of EMF exposure monitoring activities in Europe, to comment on the scientific challenges and deficiencies, and to describe appropriate strategies and tools for EMF exposure assessment and monitoring to be used to support epidemiological health research and to help policy makers, administrators, industry and consumer representatives to base their decisions and communication activities on facts and data.

The effects of ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 3 mT) on the lifespan, locomotion, heat shock response (HSR), and oxidative stress (OS) of Canton-Special (CS) and mutant w1118 flies were investigated at 25Â°C and 35Â°C (thermal stress). Results showed that thermal stress accelerated the death rates of CS and w1118 flies, shortened their lifespan, and influenced their locomotion rhythm and activity. The upregulated expression levels of heat shock protein (HSP) 22, HSP26, and HSP70 indicated that HSR was enhanced. Thermal stress-induced OS response increased malondialdehyde content, enhanced superoxide dismutase activity, and decreased reactive oxygen species level. The effects of thermal stress on the death rates, lifespan, locomotion, and HSP gene expression of flies, especially w1118 line, were also enhanced by ELF-EMF. In conclusion, thermal stress weakened the physiological function and promoted the HSR and OS of flies. ELF-EMF aggravated damages and enhanced thermal stress-induced HSP and OS response. Therefore, thermal stress and ELF-EMF elicited a synergistic effect.

Epidemiological studies, designed to verify whether EMF exposure may be a potential risk factor for health, have led to controversial results. The possible association between EMFs and an increased incidence of childhood leukemia, brain tumors or neurodegenerative diseases was not fully elucidated. On the other hand, EMFs are widely used, in neurology, psychiatry, rheumatology, orthopedics and dermatology, both in diagnosis and in therapy. In vitro studies may help to evaluate the mechanism by which LF-EMFs affect biological systems. Invitro model of wound healing used keratinocytes (HaCaT), neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) as a model for analysis of differentiation, metabolism and functions related to neurodegenerative processes, and monocytic cell line (THP-1) was used as a model for inflammation and cytokines production, while leukemic cell line (K562) was used as a model for hematopoietic differentiation. MCP-1, a chemokine that regulates the migration and infiltration of memory T cells, natural killer (NK), monocytes and epithelial cells, has been demonstrated to be induced and involved in various diseases. Since, varying the parameters of EMFs different effects may be observed, we have studied MCP-1 expression in HaCaT, SH-SY5Y, THP-1 and K562 exposed to a sinusoidal EMF at 50Â Hz frequency with a flux density of 1Â mT (rms). Our preliminary results showed that EMF-exposure differently modifies the expression of MCP-1 in different cell types. Thus, the MCP-1 expression needs to be better determined, with additional studies, with different parameters and times of exposure to ELF-EMF.

In this context, the present study aims to evaluate the biological effects on zebrafish (ZF) embryos of 100â¯MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure through a multidisciplinary protocol. Because of the shared synteny between human and ZF genomes that validated its use in biomedical research, toxicology and developmental biology studies, ZF was here selected as experimental model and a measurement protocol and biological analyses have been set up to clearly discriminate between RF-EMF biological and thermal effects. The results showed that a 100â¯MHz EMF was able to affect ZF embryonic development, from 24 to 72â¯h post fertilization (hpf) in all the analyzed pathways. Particularly, at the 48 hpf stage, a reduced growth, an increased transcription of oxidative stress genes, the onset of apoptotic/autophagic processes and a modification in cholesterol metabolism were detected. ZF embryos faced stress induced by EMF radiation by triggering detoxification mechanisms and at 72 hpf they partially recovered from stress reaching the hatching time in a comparable way respect to the control group. Data here obtained showed unequivocally the in vivo effects of RF-EMF on an animal model, excluding thermal outcomes and thus represents the starting point for more comprehensive studies on dose response effects of electromagnetic fields radiations consequences.

Concern of health hazards from EMFs has increased as the use of mobile phones and other wireless devices has grown in all segments of the population, especially children. While there has been strong evidence for an association between leukemia and residential or occupational exposure to ELF EMFs for many years, the standards in existence are not sufficiently stringent to protect from an increased risk of cancer. ELF EMFs also increase risk of at least two types of neurodegenerative diseases. For RF EMFs, standards are set at levels designed to avoid tissue heating, in spite of many reports of biological effects at intensities too low to cause significant heating. Recent evidence demonstrates elevations in risk of brain cancer and acoustic neuroma only on the side of the head where individuals used their mobile phone. Individuals who begin exposure at younger ages are more vulnerable. These data indicate that the existing standards for radiofrequency exposure are not adequate. While there are many unanswered questions, the cost of doing nothing may result in an increasing number of people, many of them young, developing these diseases.\n\nDifferentiation of K562 cells under ELF-EMF applied at different time courses.\n\nPubMed\n\nAyÅe, Inhan-Garip; Zafer, Akan; Sule, Oncul; IÅil, IÅal-Turgut; Kalkan, Tunaya\n\n2010-08-01\n\nThe time-course of ELF-EMF application to biological systems is thought to be an important parameter determining the physiological outcome. This study investigated the effect of ELF-EMF on the differentiation of K562 cells at different time courses. ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 5 mT, 1 h) was applied at two different time-courses; first at the onset of hemin induction for 1 h, and second, daily 1 h for four days. While single exposure to ELF-EMF resulted in a decrease in differentiation, ELF-EMF applied everyday for 1 h caused an increase in differentiation. The effect of co-stressors, magnesium, and heat-shock was also determined and similar results were obtained. ELF-EMF increased ROS levels in K562 cells not treated with hemin, however did not change ROS levels of hemin treated cells indicating that ROS was not the cause. Overall, these results imply that the time-course of application is an important parameter determining the physiological response of cells to ELF-EMF.\n\nRelation of Giant Thermo-EMF, Magnetothermo-EMF, Magnetoresistance, and Magnetization to Magnetic Impurity States in Manganites Nd(1- x)Sr x MnO3 and Sm(1- x)Sr x MnO3\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKoroleva, L. I.; Batashev, I. K.; Morozov, A. S.; Balbashov, A. M.; Szymczak, H.; Slawska-Waniew, A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThermo-EMF, magnetothermo-EMF, magnetoresistance, and magnetization of single-crystal samples of Nd(1- x)Sr x MnO3 and Sm(1- x)Sr x MnO3 with 0 â¤ x â¤ 0.3 have been studied experimentally. A sharp increase in the thermo-EMF and giant magnetothermo-EMF and magnetoresistance has been observed near the Curie point T C in compounds with 0.15 â¤ x â¤ 0.3. At the same time, no peculiarities have been found in compositions with x = 0. Since compounds with x > 0 consist of ferromagnetic clusters of the ferron type that reside in an antiferromagnetic A-type matrix, this means that the sharp increase in the thermo-EMF near T C is caused by ferrons. Indeed, the disappearance of ferrons due to a magnetic field or heating above T C leads to an abrupt decrease in the thermo-EMF. Therefore, thermo-EMF in alloyed magnetic semiconductors has been determined by the impurity concentration and the sample volume.\n\nLarge scale EMF in current sheets induced by tearing modes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMizerski, Krzysztof A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAn extension of the analysis of resistive instabilities of a sheet pinch from a famous work by Furth et al (1963 Phys. Fluids 6 459) is presented here, to study the mean electromotive force (EMF) generated by the developing instability. In a Cartesian configuration and in the presence of a current sheet first the boundary layer technique is used to obtain global, matched asymptotic solutions for the velocity and magnetic field and then the solutions are used to calculate the large-scale EMF in the system. It is reported, that in the bulk the curl of the mean EMF is linear in {{j}}0\\\\cdot {{B}}0, a simple pseudo-scalar quantity constructed from the large-scale quantities.\n\nEffects of EMF Emissions from Cables and Junction Boxes on Marine Species\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDhanak, Manhar; Spieler, Richard; Kilfoyle, Kirk\n\nStudies have shown that diverse aquatic species are electrosensitive. Many fishes, and marine mammals, can either detect, navigate by, or are affected by electromagnetic fields (EMF) with various sensitivities, and their behavior may be impacted by unnatural EMF emissions in the water column. Sharks, rays and skates are known to have the highest sensitivity to electric fields. Electric field emissions in the range 0.5â100 micro volt/m appear to attract them, and emissions over 100 micro volt/m to repulse them. A marine hydrokinetic MHK device will have multiple components and associated multiple submarine cables on the seafloor and running through themoreÂ Â» water column and would potentially increase the level of EMF emissions to which the marine species at the site may be exposed to. There are therefore concerns amongst stakeholders that EMF emissions associated with MHK devices and their components may act as barriers to species migration, cause disorientation, change community compositions and ecosystems, and that they may attract sharks, leading to a local increase in the risk of shark attacks. However, field data to validate and model potential relationships between observed responses and the EMF emissions in situ are sparse. A program of experimental field surveys were conducted off the coast of South Florida, USA to characterize the electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions in the water column from a submarine cable, and to monitor for responses of local aquatic species. The field surveys were conducted at the South Florida Ocean Measurement Facility (SFOMF) off Fort Lauderdale, which is a cabled offshore in-water navy range. It consists of multiple active submarine power cables and a number of junction boxes, with the capability to transmit AC/DC power at a range of strength and frequencies. The site includes significant marine life activities and community structure, including highly mobile species, such as sharks, stingrays, mammals and turtles.

Standard daily mobile-phone use is known to increase RF-EMF (radiofrequency electromagnetic field) exposure to the brains of users of all ages, whilst mobile-phone base stations, and base station units for cordless phones, can regularly increase the exposures of large numbers of the population to RF-EMF radiation in everyday life. The need to determine appropriate standards stipulating the maximum acceptable short-term and long-term RF-EMF levels encountered by the public, and set such levels as general guidelines, is of great importance in order to help preserve the general public's health and that of the next generation of humanity.\n\nOptimization of a therapeutic electromagnetic field (EMF) to retard breast cancer tumor growth and vascularity.\n\nPubMed\n\nCameron, Ivan L; Markov, Marko S; Hardman, W Elaine\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study provided additional data on the effects of a therapeutic electromagnetic field (EMF) device on growth and vascularization of murine 16/C mammary adenocarcinoma cells implanted in C3H/HeJ mice. The therapeutic EMF device generated a defined 120Â Hz semi sine wave pulse signal of variable intensity. Murine 16/C mammary adenocarcinoma tumor fragments were implanted subcutaneously between the scapulae of syngeneic C3H mice. Once the tumor grew to 100Â mm(3), daily EMF treatments were started by placing the cage of mice within the EMF field. Treatment ranged from 10 to 20 milli-Tesla (mT) and was given for 3 to 80Â minutes either once or twice a day for 12Â days. Tumors were measured and volumes calculated each 3-4 days. Therapeutic EMF treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth in all 7 EMF treated groups. Exposure to 20mT for 10Â minutes twice a day was the most effective tumor growth suppressor. The effect of EMF treatment on extent of tumor vascularization, necrosis and viable area was determined after euthanasia. The EMF reduced the vascular (CD31 immunohistochemically positive) volume fraction and increased the necrotic volume of the tumor. Treatment with 15 mT for 10Â min/d gave the maximum anti-angiogenic effect. Lack of a significant correlation between tumor CD 31 positive area and tumor growth rate indicates a mechanism for suppression of tumor growth in addition to suppression of tumor vascularization. It is proposed that EMF therapy aimed at suppression of tumor growth and vascularization may prove a safe alternative for patients whether they are or are not candidates for conventional cancer therapy.\n\nReview of the epidemiologic literature on EMF and Health.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhlbom, I C; Cardis, E; Green, A; Linet, M; Savitz, D; Swerdlow, A\n\n2001-01-01\n\nExposures to extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields (EMF) emanating from the generation, transmission, and use of electricity are a ubiquitous part of modern life. Concern about potential adverse health effects was initially brought to prominence by an epidemiologic report two decades ago from Denver on childhood cancer. We reviewed the now voluminous epidemiologic literature on EMF and risks of chronic disease and conclude the following: a) The quality of epidemiologic studies on this topic has improved over time and several of the recent studies on childhood leukemia and on cancer associated with occupational exposure are close to the limit of what can realistically be achieved in terms of size of study and methodological rigor. b) Exposure assessment is a particular difficulty of EMF epidemiology, in several respects: i) The exposure is imperceptible, ubiquitous, has multiple sources, and can vary greatly over time and short distances. ii) The exposure period of relevance is before the date at which measurements can realistically be obtained and of unknown duration and induction period. iii) The appropriate exposure metric is not known and there are no biological data from which to impute it. c) In the absence of experimental evidence and given the methodological uncertainties in the epidemiologic literature, there is no chronic disease for which an etiological relation to EMF can be regarded as established. d) There has been a large body of high quality data for childhood cancer, and also for adult leukemia and brain tumor in relation to occupational exposure. Among all the outcomes evaluated in epidemiologic studies of EMF, childhood leukemia in relation to postnatal exposures above 0.4 microT is the one for which there is most evidence of an association. The relative risk has been estimated at 2.0 (95% confidence limit: 1.27-3.13) in a large pooled analysis. This is unlikely to be due to chance but, may be, in part, due to bias.

J.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nClimate monitoring and natural disaster rapid assessment require baseline measurements that can be tracked over time to distinguish anthropogenic versus natural changes to the Earth system. Disasters like the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill require constant monitoring to assess the potential environmental and economic impacts. Absolute calibration and validation of Earth-observing sensors is needed to allow for comparison of temporally separated data sets and provide accurate information to policy makers. The Ball Experimental Sea Surface Temperature (BESST) radiometer was designed and built by Ball Aerospace to provide a well calibrated measure of sea surface temperature (SST) from an unmanned aerial system (UAS). Currently, emissive skin SST observed by satellite infrared radiometers is validated by shipborne instruments that are expensive to deploy and can only take a few data samples along the ship track to overlap within a single satellite pixel. Implementation on a UAS will allow BESST to map the full footprint of a satellite pixel and perform averaging to remove any local variability due to the difference in footprint size of the instruments. It also enables the capability to study this sub-pixel variability to determine if smaller scale effects need to be accounted for in models to improve forecasting of ocean events. In addition to satellite sensor validation, BESST can distinguish meter scale variations in SST which could be used to remotely monitor and assess thermal pollution in rivers and coastal areas as well as study diurnal and seasonal changes to bodies of water that impact the ocean ecosystem. BESST was recently deployed on a conventional Twin Otter airplane for measurements over the Gulf of Mexico to access the thermal properties of the ocean surface being affected by the oil spill. Results of these measurements will be presented along with ancillary sensor data used to eliminate false signals including UV and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR\n\nSafety of High Speed Guided Ground Transportation Systems - EMF Exposure Environments Summary Reports\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1993-08-01\n\nThis paper presents an overview of American exposure assessments for electric and magnetic fields (EMF) in the frequency : range from 0 to 3 kHz.

The existence of frequency \"windows\" at 4 and 8Â Hz frequencies of ELF EMF having effects on heat fusion period, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation and oxygen (O2) content of water solution and different dependency on temperature, background radiation and illumination was shown. Obtained data allow us to suggest that EMF-induced effect on water physicochemical properties depends on abovementioned environmental factors. As cell bathing medium is a target for biological effects of ELF EMF, the variability of experimental data on biological effects of EMF, obtained in different laboratories, can be explained by different environmental conditions of experiments, which very often are not considered adequately.\n\nThermodynamic properties of calcium-bismuth alloys determined by emf measurements\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKim, H; Boysen, DA; Bradwell, DJ\n\n2012-01-15\n\nThe thermodynamic properties of Ca-Bi alloys were determined by electromotive force (emf) measurements to assess the suitability of Ca-Bi electrodes for electrochemical energy storage applications. Emf was measured at ambient pressure as a function of temperature between 723 K and 1173 K using a Ca(s)vertical bar CaF2(s)vertical bar Ca(in Bi) cell for twenty different Ca-Bi alloys spanning the entire range of composition from chi(Ca) = 0 to 1. Reported are the temperature-independent partial molar entropy and enthalpy of calcium for each Ca-Bi alloy. Also given are the measured activities of calcium, the excess partial molar Gibbs energy of bismuth estimatedmoreÂ Â» from the Gibbs-Duhem equation, and the integral change in Gibbs energy for each Ca-Bi alloy at 873 K, 973 K, and 1073 K. Calcium activities at 973 K were found to be nearly constant at a value a(Ca) = 1 x 10(-8) over the composition range chi(Ca) = 0.32-0.56, yielding an emf of similar to 0.77 V. Above chi(Ca) = 0.62 and coincident with Ca5Bi3 formation, the calcium activity approached unity. The Ca-Bi system was also characterized by differential scanning calorimetry over the entire range of composition. Based upon these data along with the emf measurements, a revised Ca-Bi binary phase diagram is proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

(Inventor)\n\n2000-01-01\n\nA system and method are provided for measuring rate of rotation. A brushless DC motor is rotated and produces a back electromagnetic force (emf) on each winding thereof. Each winding's back-emf is integrated and multiplied by the back-emf associated with an adjacent winding. The multiplied outputs associated with each winding are combined to produce a directionally sensitive DC output proportional only to the rate of rotation of the motor's shaft.\n\nmTOR Activation by PI3K/Akt and ERK Signaling in Short ELF-EMF Exposed Human Keratinocytes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPatruno, Antonia; Pesce, Mirko; Grilli, Alfredo; Speranza, Lorenza; Franceschelli, Sara; De Lutiis, Maria Anna; Vianale, Giovina; Costantini, Erica; Amerio, Paolo; Muraro, Raffaella; Felaco, Mario; Reale, Marcella\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSeveral reports suggest that ELF-EMF exposures interact with biological processes including promotion of cell proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ELF-EMF controls cell growth are not completely understood. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of ELF-EMF on keratinocytes proliferation and molecular mechanisms involved. Effect of ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) on HaCaT cell cycle and cells growth and viability was monitored by FACS analysis and BrdU assay. Gene expression profile by microarray and qRT-PCR validation was performed in HaCaT cells exposed or not to ELF-EMF. mTOR, Akt and MAPKs expressions were evaluated by Western blot analysis. In HaCaT cells, short ELF-EMF exposure modulates distinct patterns of gene expression involved in cell proliferation and in the cell cycle. mTOR activation resulted the main molecular target of ELF-EMF on HaCaT cells. Our data showed the increase of the canonical pathway of mTOR regulation (PI3K/Akt) and activation of ERK signaling pathways. Our results indicate that ELF-EMF selectively modulated the expression of multiple genes related to pivotal biological processes and functions that play a key role in physio-pathological mechanisms such as wound healing.

The most common system configurations with their construction are described. The parameters of radiated EMF in the context of the access to methods and other parameters of the radio transmission are discussed. Attention was also paid to antennas that are used in this technology. The influence of individual components of a multi-frequency EMF, most commonly found in the BS surroundings, on the resultant EMF strength value indicated by popular broadband EMF meters was analyzed. The examples of metrological characteristics of the most common EMF probes and 2 measurement scenarios of the multisystem base station, with and without microwave relays, are shown. The presented method for measuring the multi-frequency EMF using 2 broadband probes allows for the significant minimization of measurement uncertainty. Equations and formulas that can be used to calculate the actual EMF intensity from multi-frequency sources are shown. They have been verified in the laboratory conditions on a specific standard setup as well as in real conditions in a survey of the existing base station with microwave relays. Presented measurement methodology of multi-frequency EMF from BS with microwave relays, validated both in laboratory and real conditions. It has been proven that the described measurement methodology is the optimal approach to the evaluation of EMF exposure in BS surrounding. Alternative approaches with much greater uncertainty (precaution method) or more complex measuring procedure (sources exclusion method) are also presented).

J. (Inventor)\n\n1984-01-01\n\nA power factor controller for an ac induction motor is provided which is of the type comprising thyristor switches connected in series with the motor, phase detectors for sensing the motor current and voltage and providing an output proportional to the phase difference between the motor voltage and current, and a control circuit, responsive to the output of the phase detector and to a power factor command signal, for controlling switching of the thyristor. The invention involves sensing the induced emf produced by the motor during the time interval when the thyristor is off and for producing a corresponding feedback signal for controlling switching of the thyristor. The sensed emf is also used to enhance soft starting of the motor.\n\nDoes Exposure to a Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Field Modify Thermal Preference in Juvenile Rats?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPelletier, Amandine; Delanaud, StÃ©phane; de Seze, RenÃ©; Bach, VÃ©ronique; Libert, Jean-Pierre; Loos, Nathalie\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSome studies have shown that people living near a mobile phone base station may report sleep disturbances and discomfort. Using a rat model, we have previously shown that chronic exposure to a low-intensity radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) was associated with paradoxical sleep (PS) fragmentation and greater vasomotor tone in the tail. Here, we sought to establish whether sleep disturbances might result from the disturbance of thermoregulatory processes by a RF-EMF. We recorded thermal preference and sleep stage distribution in 18 young male Wistar rats. Nine animals were exposed to a low-intensity RF-EMF (900 MHz, 1 V.mâ1) for five weeks and nine served as non-exposed controls. Thermal preference was assessed in an experimental chamber comprising three interconnected compartments, in which the air temperatures (Ta) were set to 24Â°C, 28Â°C and 31Â°C. Sleep and tail skin temperature were also recorded. Our results indicated that relative to control group, exposure to RF-EMF at 31Â°C was associated with a significantly lower tail skin temperature (â1.6Â°C) which confirmed previous data. During the light period, the exposed group preferred to sleep at Taâ=â31Â°C and the controls preferred Taâ=â28Â°C. The mean sleep duration in exposed group was significantly greater (by 15.5%) than in control group (due in turn to a significantly greater amount of slow wave sleep (SWS, +14.6%). Similarly, frequency of SWS was greater in exposed group (by 4.9 episodes.hâ1). The PS did not differ significantly between the two groups. During the dark period, there were no significant intergroup differences. We conclude that RF-EMF exposure induced a shift in thermal preference towards higher temperatures. The shift in preferred temperature might result from a cold thermal sensation. The change in sleep stage distribution may involve signals from thermoreceptors in the skin. Modulation of SWS may be a protective adaptation in response to RF-EMF exposure.

We show analytically why lower values of m{sub 1} require a higher level of fine tuning in the seesaw formula and/or in the flavoured decay parameters (in the electronic for NO, in the muonic for IO). We also show how this constraint existsmoreÂ Â» thanks to the measured values of the neutrino mixing angles and could be tightened by a future determination of the Dirac phase. Our analysis also allows us to place a more stringent constraint for a specific model or class of models, such as SO(10)-inspired models, and shows that some models cannot realise strong thermal leptogenesis for any value of m{sub 1}. A scatter plot analysis fully supports the analytical results. We also briefly discuss the interplay with absolute neutrino mass scale experiments concluding that they will be able in the coming years to either corner strong thermal leptogenesis or find positive signals pointing to a non-vanishing m{sub 1}. Since the constraint is much stronger for NO than for IO, it is very important that new data from planned neutrino oscillation experiments will be able to solve the ambiguity.Â«Â less\n\nComparison of a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer and Toftness sensometer for body surface EMF measurement.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, John; Toftness, Dave; Snyder, Brian; Nosco, Dennis; Balcavage, Walter; Nindl, Gabi\n\n2004-12-01\n\nThe use of magnetic fields to treat disease has intrigued mankind since the time of the ancient Greeks.

Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) can modulate oxidative stress, but there are no clinical antioxidant studies in brain stroke patients. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of ELF-EMF on clinical and antioxidant status in post-stroke patients. Fifty-seven patients were divided into two groups: ELF-EMF and non-ELF-EMF. Both groups underwent the same 4-week rehabilitation program. Additionally, the ELF-EMF group was exposed to an ELF-EMF field of 40âHz, 7âmT for 15âmin/day for 4 weeks (5 days a week). The activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was measured in hemolysates, and total antioxidant status (TAS) determined in plasma. Functional status was assessed before and after the series of treatments using Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Applied ELF-EMF significantly increased enzymatic antioxidant activity; however, TAS levels did not change in either group. Results show that ELF-EMF induced a significant improvement in functional (ADL) and mental (MMSE, GDS) status. Clinical parameters had positive correlation with the level of enzymatic antioxidant protection. Bioelectromagnetics. 38:386-396, 2017. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The paper highlights the study on the ELF EMF safety assessment performed at residences comprising of an owner-occupied house, a completed vacant house and an under construction condominium. The objectives of this study were to determine the ELF EMF radiation exposure level from the high voltage transmission line, electric distribution substation, power station and electrical household appliances in the residences, and to assess the potential exposure received by the occupants at the assessed locations. The results were logged in the electric and magnetic field strength with the units of volt per meter (V/m) and miliGauss (mG) respectively. The instrument setup and measurement protocols during the assessment were adopted from standard measurement method and procedures stipulated under the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard. The results were compared with the standards recommended in the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines.\n\nA Novel Portable Absolute Transient Hot-Wire Instrument for the Measurement of the Thermal Conductivity of Solids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAssael, Marc J.; Antoniadis, Konstantinos D.; Metaxa, Ifigeneia N.; Mylona, Sofia K.; Assael, John-Alexander M.; Wu, Jiangtao; Hu, Miaomiao\n\n2015-11-01\n\nA new portable absolute Transient Hot-Wire instrument for measuring the thermal conductivity of solids over a range of 0.2 { W}{\\\\cdot }m^{-1}{\\\\cdot }{K}^{-1} to 4 { W}{\\\\cdot }m^{-1}{\\\\cdot }{K}^{-1} is presented. The new instrument is characterized by three novelties: (a) an innovative two-wires sensor which provides robustness and portability, while at the same time employs a soft silicone layer to eliminate the effect of the contact resistance between the wires and the sample, (b) a newly designed compact portable printed electronic board employing an FPGA architecture CPU to the control output voltage and data processingâthe new board replaces the traditional, large in size Wheatstone-type bridge system required to perform the experimental measurements, and (c) a cutting-edge software suite, developed for the mesh describing the structure of the sensor, and utilizing the Finite Elements Method to model the heat flow. The estimation of thermal conductivity is modeled as a minimization problem and is solved using Bayesian Optimization. Our revolutionizing proposed methodology exhibits radical speedups of up to Ã 120, compared to previous approaches, and considerably reduces the number of simulations performed, achieving convergence only in a few minutes. The new instrument was successfully employed to measure, at room temperature, the thermal conductivity of two thermal conductivity reference materials, Pyroceram 9606 and Pyrex 7740, and two possible candidate glassy solids, PMMA and BK7, with an absolute low uncertainty of 2 %.\n\nMelatonin and puberty in female lambs exposed to EMF: A replicate study\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLee, J.M.

With the advice of stakeholders, and well before any risk determinations were made, transparent policy analyses about the power grid and schools asked the question, \"How confident must one be of how big an effect before one would adopt cheap or expensive EMF avoidance measures?\" A risk evaluation was carried out with features that promoted transparency. It was formatted to provide a policy-neutral \"degree of certainty of causality\" to adherents of utilitarian, environmental justice, and libertarian policy frameworks. Though the program had many features advocated by adherents of the precautionary principle, it might be better characterized as following \"Transparent Democratic Foresight Strategies,\" since no single principle justifies the strategies used in this participatory program, and it examined the pros and cons of options but made no recommendations, precautionary or otherwise.\n\nGenotoxic effects of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) in HL-60 cells are not reproducible.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpeit, GÃ¼nter; Gminski, Richard; Tauber, Rudolf\n\n2013-08-15\n\nConflicting results have been published regarding the induction of genotoxic effects by exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF). Various results indicating a genotoxic potential of RF-EMF were reported by the collaborative EU-funded REFLEX (Risk Evaluation of Potential Environmental Hazards From Low Energy Electromagnetic Field Exposure Using Sensitive in vitro Methods) project. There has been a long-lasting scientific debate about the reliability of the reported results and an attempt to reproduce parts of the results obtained with human fibroblasts failed. Another part of the REFLEX study was performed in Berlin with the human lymphoblastoid cell line HL-60; genotoxic effects of RF-EMF were measured by means of the comet assay and the micronucleus test. The plausibility and reliability of these results were also questioned. In order to contribute to a clarification of the biological significance of the reported findings, a repeat study was performed, involving scientists of the original study. Comet-assay experiments and micronucleus tests were performed under the same experimental conditions that had led to genotoxic effects in the REFLEX study. Here we report that the attempts to reproduce the induction of genotoxic effects by RF-EMF in HL-60 cells failed. No genotoxic effects of RF-EMF were measured in the repeat experiments. We could not find an explanation for the conflicting results. However, the negative repeat experiments suggest that the biological significance of genotoxic effects of RF-EMF reported by the REFLEX study should be re-assessed. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Concerns for children's exposure are warranted due to the amazingly rapid uptake of many wireless devices by increasingly younger children. This review of policy and advice regarding children's RF-EMF exposure draws material from a wide variety of sources focusing on the current situation. This is not a systematic review, but aims to provide a representative cross-section of policy and advisory responses within set boundaries. There are a wide variety of approaches which I have categorized and tabulated ranging from ICNIRP/IEEE guidelines and \"no extra precautions needed\" to precautionary or scientific much lower maxima and extensive advice to minimize RF-EMF exposure, ban advertising/sale to children, and add exposure information to packaging. Precautionary standards use what I term an exclusion principle. The wide range of policy approaches can be confusing for parents/carers of children. Some consensus among advisory organizations would be helpful acknowledging that, despite extensive research, the highly complex nature of both RF-EMF and the human body, and frequent technological updates, means simple assurance of long-term safety cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, minimum exposure of children to RF-EMF is recommended. This does not indicate need for alarm, but mirrors routine health-and-safety precautions. Simple steps are suggested. ICNIRP guidelines need to urgently publish how the head, torso, and limbs' exposure limits were calculated and what safety margin was applied since this exposure, especially to the abdomen, is now dominant in many children.\n\nThe role of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in pro-inflammatory responses of EMF-stimulated N9 microglial cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground In several neuropathological conditions, microglia can become overactivated and cause neurotoxicity by initiating neuronal damage in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) activates cultured microglia to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and nitric oxide (NO) through signal transduction involving the activator of transcription STAT3. Here, we investigated the role of STAT3 signaling in EMF-induced microglial activation and pro-inï¬ammatory responses in more detail than the previous study. Methods N9 microglial cells were treated with EMF exposure or a sham treatment, with or without pretreatment with an inhibitor (Pyridone 6, P6) of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAK). The activation state of microglia was assessed via immunoreaction using the microglial marker CD11b. Levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-Î± and NO were measured using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the nitrate reductase method. Activation of JAKs and STAT3 proteins was evaluated by western blotting for specific tyrosine phosphorylation. The ability of STAT3 to bind to DNA was detected with an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results EMF was found to significantly induce phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, and DNA-binding ability of STAT3 in N9 microglia. In addition, EMF dramatically increased the expression of CD11b, TNF-Î± and iNOS, and the production of NO. P6 strongly suppressed the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 and diminished STAT3 activity in EMF-stimulated microglia. Interestingly, expression of CD11b as well as gene expression and production of TNF-Î± and iNOS were suppressed by P6 at 12 h, but not at 3 h, after EMF exposure. Conclusions EMF exposure directly triggers initial activation of microglia and produces a significant pro-inflammatory response.

Two impellers drive a two-vortex flow, based on the calculations of Dudley and James, intended to excite system-scale dynamo instability. We present a collection of results from experiments measuring hydrodynamic fluctuations and their MHD effects. An equatorial baffle was added to the experiment in order to diminish the large-eddy hydrodynamic fluctuations by stabilizing the shear layer between the two counter-rotating flow cells. The change in the fluctuation levels was inferred from the change in the spatial spectrum of the induced magnetic field. This reduction correlated with a 2.4 times increase in the induced toroidal magnetic field (a proxy measure of the effective resistivity). Furthermore, the local velocity fluctuations were directly measured by the addition of a 3-d emf probe (a strong permanent magnet inserted into the flow with electrical leads to measure the induced voltage, and magnetic probes to determine the magnetic fluctuations). The measured emfs are consistent with the enhanced magnetic diffusivity interpretation of mean-field MHD.\n\nExposure time-dependent thermal effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure on the whole body of rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhtani, Shin; Ushiyama, Akira; Maeda, Machiko; Hattori, Kenji; Kunugita, Naoki; Wang, Jianqing; Ishii, Kazuyuki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe investigated the thermal effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) on the variation in core temperature and gene expression of some stress markers in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 2.14 GHz wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) RF signals at a whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (WBA-SAR) of 4 W/kg, which causes behavioral disruption in laboratory animals, and 0.4 W/kg, which is the limit for the occupational exposure set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guideline. It is important to understand the possible in vivo effects derived from RF-EMF exposures at these intensities. Because of inadequate data on real-time core temperature analyses using free-moving animal and the association between stress and thermal effects of RF-EMF exposure, we analyzed the core body temperature under nonanesthetic condition during RF-EMF exposure. The results revealed that the core temperature increased by approximately 1.5Â°C compared with the baseline and reached a plateau till the end of RF-EMF exposure. Furthermore, we analyzed the gene expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsp) and heat-shock transcription factors (Hsf) family after RF-EMF exposure. At WBA-SAR of 4 W/kg, some Hsp and Hsf gene expression levels were significantly upregulated in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum following exposure for 6 hr/day but were not upregulated after exposure for 3 hr/day. On the other hand, there was no significant change in the core temperature and gene expression at WBA-SAR of 0.4 W/kg. Thus, 2.14-GHz RF-EMF exposure at WBA-SAR of 4 W/kg induced increases in the core temperature and upregulation of some stress markers, particularly in the cerebellum.\n\nFive years later: the current status of the use of proteomics and transcriptomics in EMF research.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeszczynski, Dariusz; de Pomerai, David; Koczan, Dirk; Stoll, Dieter; Franke, Helmut; Albar, Juan Pablo\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe World Health Organization's and Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority's \"Workshop on Application of Proteomics and Transcriptomics in Electromagnetic Fields Research\" was held in Helsinki in the October/November 2005. As a consequence of this meeting, Proteomics journal published in 2006 a special issue \"Application of Proteomics and Transcriptomics in EMF Research\" (Vol. 6 No. 17; Guest Editor: D. Leszczynski). This Proteomics issue presented the status of research, of the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) using proteomics and transcriptomics methods, present in 2005. The current overview/opinion article presents the status of research in this area by reviewing all studies that were published by the end of 2010. The review work was a part of the European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) Action BM0704 that created a structure in which researchers in the field of EMF and health shared knowledge and information.

Therefore the hypothesis has been tested that ELF-EMF-induced DNA strand breaks might be mediated by cellular processes that cause alteration of the intracellular concentration of free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and/or the membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). [Ca2+]i was determined by the ratiometric fura-2 technique. Changes in DeltaPsi(m) were assessed by using the potential-dependent lipophilic cationic probe JC-1. Human fibroblasts were exposed to intermittent ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1000 microT). Although exposure of fiboblasts to ELF-EMF resulted in a highly significant increase in DNA strand breaks as determined by the comet assay, no effect on JC-1 fluorescence emission or on [Ca2+]i has been observed when comparing exposed with sham-exposed cells. Therefore, it is suggested that ELF-EMF-induced DNA strand breaks are unlikely to be caused by intracellular changes that affect [Ca2+]i and/or DeltaPsi(m).\n\nUniversal 'imaginary closed circuit method' and formula for determination of direction of induced emf/current\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBalaram Atram, Dattatraya\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFleming's right-hand rule and the right-flat-hand rule are generally applied for determining the direction of flow of induced emf/current in straight conductors. The right-hand-fingers rule is applied for coils only. The right-hand-thumb rule can be applied for either straight conductors or coils. Different rules have to be applied for different situations. Also, a formula for determining the direction of induced emf/current does not exist on the basis of these rules. In this article, based on Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction and Lenz's law, an 'imaginary closed circuit method' and a formula for determination of direction of induced emf/current has been proposed. The method is universal in the sense that it is applicable for conductors of any shape, for any kind of relative motion of the conductor with respect to the magnetic flux, and moreover it is applicable for the case of varying magnetic flux.\n\nCryogenic, Absolute, High Pressure Sensor\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChapman, John J.

Electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure can elicit the pro-inflammatory activation and may also trigger an alteration of the clearance function in microglial cells. Curcumin has important roles in the anti-inflammatory and phagocytic process. Here, we evaluated the ability of curcumin to ameliorate the phagocytic ability of EMF-exposed microglial cells (N9 cells) and documented relative pathways. Methods N9 cells were pretreated with or without recombinant murine MFG-E8 (rmMFG-E8), curcumin and an antibody of toll-like receptor 4 (anti-TLR4), and subsequently treated with EMF or a sham exposure. Their phagocytic ability was evaluated using phosphatidylserine-containing fluorescent bioparticles. The pro-inflammatory activation of microglia was assessed via CD11b immunoreactivity and the production of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and nitric oxide (NO) via the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or the Griess test. We evaluated the ability of curcumin to ameliorate the phagocytic ability of EMF-exposed N9 cells, including checking the expression of MFG-E8, Î±vÎ²3 integrin, TLR4, nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) using Western blotting. Results EMF exposure dramatically enhanced the expression of CD11b and depressed the phagocytic ability of N9 cells. rmMFG-E8 could clearly ameliorate the phagocytic ability of N9 cells after EMF exposure. We also found that EMF exposure significantly increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-1Î²) and the production of NO; however, these increases were efficiently chilled by the addition of curcumin to the culture medium. This reduction led to the amelioration of the phagocytic ability of EMF-exposed N9 cells\n\nEffects of EMF emissions from undersea electric cables on coral reef fish.\n\nPubMed\n\nKilfoyle, Audie K; Jermain, Robert F; Dhanak, Manhar R; Huston, Joseph P; Spieler, Richard E\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine if electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions from undersea power cables impacted local marine life, with an emphasis on coral reef fish. The work was done at the South Florida Ocean Measurement Facility of Naval Surface Warfare Center in Broward County, Florida, which has a range of active undersea detection and data transmission cables. EMF emissions from a selected cable were created during non-destructive visual fish surveys on SCUBA. During surveys, the transmission of either alternating current (AC), direct current (DC), or none (OFF) was randomly initiated by the facility at a specified time. Visual surveys were conducted using standardized transect and point-count methods to acquire reef fish abundances and species richness prior to and immediately after a change in transmission frequency. The divers were also tasked to note the reaction of the reef fish to the immediate change in EMF during a power transition. In general, analysis of the data did not find statistical differences among power states and any variables. However, this may be a Type II error as there are strong indications of a potential difference of a higher abundance of reef fish at the sites when the power was off, and further study is warranted.

Whilst there has been some recent evidence of regulatory fatigue, and attempts to enforce closure, the EMF debate nevertheless still continues. This paper will explore the rÃ´le played by competing images of scientific method in the argumentative strategies used by two of the main protagonists in an Australian public inquiry (held in 1990-91) which investigated the EMF issue: 'Inquiry into Community Needs and High Voltage (132kv and above) Transmission Line Development', the so-called Gibbs Inquiry. Apart from documenting some of the epistemologically intricate features of the EMF controversy, the following discussion will also consider the way scientific method discourses can contribute to enhancing the durability of knowledge claims in legal and regulatory settings.\n\nThermodynamic Properties of AgIn2Te3I and AgIn2Te3Br, Determined by EMF Method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoroz, M. V.; Prokhorenko, M. V.; Prokhorenko, S. V.; Yatskov, M. V.; Reshetnyak, O. V.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDifferential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electromotive force (EMF) are used to triangulate Ag-In-Te-I(Br) systems in the vicinity of compounds AgIn2Te3I and AgIn2Te3Br. The three-dimensional position of the AgIn2Te3I-InTe-Ag2Te-AgI and AgIn2Te3Br-InTe-Ag3TeBr phase areas with respect to the figurative points of silver is used to create equations of potential-determining chemical reactions. The potential-determining reactions are conducted in (-)C|Ag|Ag3GeS3I(Br) glass|D|C(+) electrochemical cells (ECCs), where C stands for inert (graphite) electrodes, Ag and D are ECC electrodes (D denotes alloys of one-, three-, and four-phase areas), and Ag3GeS3I and Ag3GeS3Br glasses are membranes with purely ionic Ag+ conductivity. Linear parts of the temperature dependences of the cell EMFs are used to calculate the standard integral thermodynamic functions of saturated solid solutions based on AgIn2Te3I and AgIn2Te3Br, and the relative partial thermodynamic functions of silver in the stoichiometric quaternary compounds.\n\nA Meta-Analysis on the Relationship between Exposure to ELF-EMFs and the Risk of Female Breast Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Qingsong; Lang, Li; Wu, Wenzhe; Xu, Guoyong; Zhang, Xiao; Li, Tao; Huang, Hanlin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective To comprehensively analyze the relationship between exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) and the development of female breast cancer. Methods Reports of case-control studies published from 1990 to 2010 were analyzed. The quality effect model was chosen to calculate total odds ratio (OR) depending on the data in studies and quality scores. Subgroup analyses were also performed by the situation of menopause, estrogenic receptor and exposure assessment respectively. Results For all 23 studies the OR was 1.07, 95% CIâ=â1.02â1.13, for estrogen receptor positive subgroup,ORâ=â1.11, 95% CIâ=â1.03â1.20; for premenopausal subgroup, ORâ=â1.11, 95% CIâ=â1.00â1.23. The results of other subgroups showed no significant association between ELF-EMF and female breast cancer. Conclusion ELF-EMFs might be related to an increased risk for female breast cancer, especially for premenopausal and ER+ females. However, it's necessary to undertake better epidemiologic researches to verify the association between ELF-EMF and female breast cancer due to the limits of current study, especially the one on exposure assessment.

EMF and LAN are said to reduce circulating levels of the hormone melatonin which, in turn, allows estrogen levels to rise and stimulate the turnover of breast epithelial stem cells and increase the risk for malignant transformation. Three laboratory-based studies, in which a total of 53 healthy young women were exposed at night to EMF or to LAN under controlled exposure conditions, were performed to determine whether such exposures reduce melatonin and are associated with further alterations in estrogen. All-night exposure to industrial-strength magnetic fields (60 Hz, 28.3 microT) had no effect on the blood levels of melatonin or estradiol. In contrast, nocturnal melatonin levels were profoundly suppressed, and the time of peak concentration was significantly delayed in women exposed to LAN, regardless of whether they were in the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. These changes, however, were not associated with alterations in point-for-point matching measures of estradiol. Women who chronically secrete high or low amounts of melatonin each night (area-under-curve range: 86-1,296 pg/mL) also did not differ in their blood levels of estradiol. Taken together, these results are consistent with a growing body of evidence which generally suggests that environmental EMF exposure has little or no effect on the parameters measured in this report.\n\nAnalysis of cell performance and thermal regeneration of a lithium-tin cell having an immobilized fused-salt electrolyte\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCairns, E.

Most recently worries about exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from wind turbines, and associated electrical transmission, has been raised at public meetings and legal proceedings. These fears have not been based on any actual measurements of EMF exposure surrounding existing projects but appear to follow from worries from internet sources and misunderstanding of the science. The study was carried out at the Kingsbridge 1 Wind Farm located near Goderich, Ontario, Canada. Magnetic field measurements were collected in the proximity of 15 Vestas 1.8 MW wind turbines, two substations, various buried and overhead collector and transmission lines, and nearby homes. Data were collected during three operational scenarios to characterize potential EMF exposure: 'high wind' (generating power), 'low wind' (drawing power from the grid, but not generating power) and 'shut off' (neither drawing, nor generating power). Background levels of EMF (0.2 to 0.3 mG) were established by measuring magnetic fields around the wind turbines under the 'shut off' scenario. Magnetic field levels detected at the base of the turbines under both the 'high wind' and 'low wind' conditions were low (mean = 0.9 mG; n = 11) and rapidly diminished with distance, becoming indistinguishable from background within 2 m of the base. Magnetic fields measured 1 m above buried collector lines were also within background (â¤ 0.3 mG). Beneath overhead 27.5 kV and 500 kV transmission lines, magnetic field levels of up to 16.5 and 46 mG, respectively, were recorded. These levels also diminished rapidly with distance. None of these sources appeared to influence magnetic field levels at nearby homes located as close as just over 500 m from turbines, where measurements immediately outside of the homes were â¤ 0.4 mG.

In present study, we extended analysis of EMF characteristics from time domain to frequency domain, aiming to investigate effects of four kinds of EMF (LP (1-100âHz), BP (100-3,000âHz), HP (3,000-50,000âHz) and AP (1-50,000âHz)) on ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporosis (OP) in mice. Forty-eight 3-month-old female BALB/c mice were equally assigned to Sham, OVX, OVXâ+âLP, OVXâ+âBP, OVXâ+âHP and OVXâ+âAP groups (nâ=â8). After 8-week exposure (3âh/day), LP and BP significantly increased serum bone formation markers and osteogenesis-related gene expressions compared with OVX. Bedsides, LP and BP also slightly increased bone resorption activity compared with OVX, evidenced by increased RANKL/OPG ratio. HP sharply decreased serum bone formation and resporption markers and osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis related gene expressions compared with OVX. AP had accumulative effects of LP, BP and HP, which significantly increased bone formation and decreased bone resporption activity compared with OVX. As a result, LP, BP and HP exposure did not later deterioration of bone mass, microarchitecture and mechanical strength in OVX mice with OP.

The 5-year survival rate after tumor resection and adjuvant chemoradiation is only 10Â %, with almost all recurrences occurring in the initially treated site. Attempts to improve local control using a higher radiation dose were not successful so that alternative additive treatments are urgently needed. Given the strong rationale for hyperthermia as part of a multimodal treatment for patients with glioblastoma, non-invasive radio frequency (RF) hyperthermia might significantly improve treatment results. A non-invasive applicator was constructed utilizing the magnetic resonance (MR) spin excitation frequency for controlled RF hyperthermia and MR imaging in an integrated system, which we refer to as thermal MR. Applicator designs at RF frequencies 300Â MHz, 500Â MHz and 1GHz were investigated and examined for absolute applicable thermal dose and temperature hotspot size. Electromagnetic field (EMF) and temperature simulations were performed in human voxel models. RF heating experiments were conducted at 300Â MHz and 500Â MHz to characterize the applicator performance and validate the simulations. The feasibility of thermal MR was demonstrated at 7.0Â T. The temperature could be increased by ~11Â Â°C in 3Â min in the center of a head sized phantom. Modification of the RF phases allowed steering of a temperature hotspot to a deliberately selected location. RF heating was monitored using the integrated system for MR thermometry and high spatial resolution MRI. EMF and thermal simulations demonstrated that local RF hyperthermia using the integrated system is feasible to reach a maximum temperature in the center of the human brain of 46.8Â Â°C after 3Â min of RF heating while surface temperatures stayed below 41Â Â°C. Using higher RF frequencies reduces the size of the temperature hotspot significantly.
