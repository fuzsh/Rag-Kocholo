        "text": "The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole's dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.\n\nUsing adaptive optics with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy (MAGPI) survey allows us to study the spatially resolved Universe at a crucial time of ~4 Gyr ago ($z$ ~ 0.3) when simulations predict the greatest diversity in evolutionary pathways for galaxies. We investigate the radial trends in the star formation (SF) activity and luminosity-weighted stellar ages as a function of offset from the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) for a total of 294 galaxies. Using both H$\\alpha$ emission and the 4000 Angstrom break (i.e., D4000) as star formation rate (SFR) tracers, we find overall flat radial profiles for galaxies lying on and above the SFMS, suggestive of physical processes that enhance/regulate SF throughout the entire galaxy disc. However, for galaxies lying below the SFMS, we find positive gradients in SF suggestive of inside-out quenching. Placing our results in context with results from other redshift regimes suggests an evolution in radial trends at $z$ ~ 0.3 for SF galaxies above the SFMS, from uniformly enhanced SF at $z$ ~ 1 and $z$ ~ 0.3 to centrally enhanced SF at $z$ ~ 0 (when averaged over a wide range of mass). We also capture higher local SFRs for galaxies below the SFMS compared to that of $z$ ~ 0, which can be explained by a larger population of quenched satellites in the local Universe and/or different treatments of limitations set by the D4000-sSFR relation.\n\nThe radio galaxy PKS 1007+142 is classified as a compact steep-spectrum source (CSS) and belongs to the class of young Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we investigate the $\\gamma$-ray emission from this CSS by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the 15 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observation data. The Fermi-LAT latest Source Catalog, 4FGL-DR4, includes an unassociated $\\gamma$-ray source, 4FGL J1010.0+1416, located at 0.24{\\deg} away from the radio position of PKS 1007+142. Using the 15 yr Fermi-LAT observation data, we re-estimate the best-fit position of the $\\gamma$-ray source and find that PKS 1007+142 is in close proximity to the $\\gamma$-ray source and falls within its 68% error circle. Therefore, we conclude that PKS 1007+142 is the most plausible counterpart to the unassociated LAT source with a detection test statistics (TS) $\\sim$43.4 ($\\sim 6.6\\sigma$). PKS 1007+142 exhibits a steep power-law spectrum in the 0.1--300 GeV band, with a photon spectral index ($\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$) of $2.86\\pm0.17$. The average flux in the considered time interval is $\\rm (2.14\\pm0.34)\\times10^{-12}\\ erg\\ cm^{-2}\\ s^{-1}$. Comparing PKS 1007+142 with other $\\gamma$-ray emitting AGNs in both the $L_{\\gamma}-\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$ and $L_\\gamma-L_{\\rm 1.4GHz}$ planes, it shows a softer $\\gamma$-ray spectrum and lower luminosity compared to other $\\gamma$-ray emitting CSSs. Furthermore, the possible origins of $\\gamma$-ray in PKS 1007+142 are also discussed.\n\nLong gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from core collapse of massive stars. High-redshift GRBs can probe the star formation and reionization history of the early universe, but their detection remains rare. Here we report the detection of a GRB triggered in the 0.5--4 keV band by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board the Einstein Probe (EP) mission, designated as EP240315a, whose bright peak was also detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope and Konus-Wind through off-line analyses. At a redshift of $z=4.859$, EP240315a showed a much longer and more complicated light curve in the soft X-ray band than in gamma-rays. Benefiting from a large field-of-view ($\\sim$3600 deg$^2$) and a high sensitivity, EP-WXT captured the earlier engine activation and extended late engine activity through a continuous detection. With a peak X-ray flux at the faint end of previously known high-$z$ GRBs, the detection of EP240315a demonstrates the great potential for EP to study the early universe via GRBs.\n\nRadio bursts of magnetically active stars reveal the intensity and activity of the stellar magnetic field. They may also be related to the planets around the stars. We monitored a radio-active star, AD Leonis, 3000 seconds per day for 17 days in November 2020, and 5000 seconds per day for 5 days in July 2023 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Based on the simultaneous flux increases in Stokes I and Stokes V, one left-hand circular polarized radio burst is identified. The $\\sim50\\%$ degree of circular polarization indicates the burst being originated from non-thermal radiation related to the stellar magnetic field. Combining the newly discovered burst with previous observations of radio and X-ray bursts from AD Leonis, we did a periodicity analysis for the 49 bursts in total. No periodicity with confidence level $>3\\sigma$ is found, while a candidate period of 3.04 days at $\\approx 2\\sigma$ confidence level is presented and discussed. Results of recent FAST observations and the periodicity analysis suggest a more compact campaign of observation toward this source, from which a more optimistic result of period search could be achieved.\n\nA firm establishment of the presence or the lack of periodicity in repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is crucial for determining their origins. Here we compile 1145 radio bursts of FRB 20121102A with fluence larger than 0.15 Jy ms from observations using the Five-hundredmeter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, Arecibo Observatory, Green Bank Telescope, Effelsberg Telescope, MeerKAT Telescope, Lovell Telescope, Deep Space Network 70 m radio telescopes, Very Large Array, and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope spanning the time interval of MJD 57175-58776. A quasi-period of $157.1_{-4.8}^{+5.2}$ day and a candidate quasi-period of $4.605_{-0.010}^{+0.003}$ day are found through the phase-folding probability binomial analysis. The former is consistent with previous findings and the latter is new. The 4.605 day periodicity is more obvious in high-energy bursts with fluence larger than $10^{38}$ erg. The presence of these (candidate) quasi-periods, together with the corresponding width of burst accumulation in the phase space, are consistent with the bursts' originating from a binary degenerate star system with a close-by planet around the primary neutron star.\n\nAs weak lensing surveys go deeper, there is an increasing need for reliable characterization of non-Gaussian structures at small angular scales. Here we present the first cosmological constraints with weak lensing scattering transform, a statistical estimator that combines efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. With the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC) year 1 data, we obtain $\\Omega_\\text{m}=0.29_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$, $S_8\\equiv \\sigma_8(\\Omega_\\text{m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.83\\pm0.02$, and intrinsic alignment strength $A_\\text{IA}=1.0\\pm0.4$ through simulation-based forward modeling. Our constraints are consistent with those derived from Planck. The error bar of $\\Omega_\\text{m}$ is 2 times tighter than that obtained from the power spectrum when the same scale range is used. This constraining power is on par with that of convolutional neural networks, suggesting that further investment in spatial information extraction may not yield substantial benefits. We also point out an internal tension of $S_8$ estimates linked to a redshift bin around z ~ 1 in the HSC data. We found that discarding that bin leads to a consistent decrease of $S_8$ from 0.83 to 0.79, for all statistical estimators. We argue that photometric redshift estimation is now the main limitation in the estimation of $S_8$ using HSC. This limitation is likely to affect other ground-based weak lensing surveys reaching redshifts greater than one. Alternative redshift estimation techniques, like clustering redshifts, may help alleviate this limitation.\n\nBlue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered class of short-period pulsating variable stars. In this work, we present new information on these stars based on photometric and spectroscopic data obtained for known and new objects detected by the OGLE survey. BLAPs are evolved objects with pulsation periods in the range of 3--75 min, stretching between subdwarf B-type stars and upper main-sequence stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In general, BLAPs are single-mode stars pulsating in the fundamental radial mode. Their phase-folded light curves are typically sawtooth shaped, but light curves of shorter-period objects are more rounded and symmetric, while many longer-period objects exhibit an additional bump. The long-term OGLE observations show that the period change rates of BLAPs are usually of the order of 10^-7 per year and in a quarter of the sample are negative. An exception is the triple-mode object OGLE-BLAP-030, which changes its dominant period much faster, at a rate of about +4.6 x 10^-6 per year. The spectroscopic data indicate that the BLAPs form a homogeneous group in the period, surface gravity, and effective temperature spaces. However, we observe a split into two groups in terms of helium-to-hydrogen content. The atmospheres of the He-enriched BLAPs are more abundant in metals (about five times) than the atmosphere of the Sun. We discover that the BLAPs obey a period--gravity relationship and we use the distance to OGLE-BLAP-009 to derive a period--luminosity relation. Most of the stars observed in the OGLE Galactic bulge fields seem to reside in the bulge, while the remaining objects likely are in the foreground Galactic disk.\n\nWe present a new constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the standard dark siren method using a sample of $5$ well-covered gravitational wave (GW) alerts reported during the first part of the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs in combination with standard dark sirens from the first three runs. Our methodology relies on the galaxy catalog method alone. We use the full probability density estimation of photometric redshifts derived by a deep learning method using the DESI Legacy Survey and DELVE galaxy catalogs. We add the constraints from the binary black hole mergers candidates S231226av, S231206cc, S230919bj, S230627c, and S230922g to the sample of standard dark sirens analyzed in Alfradique et al. (2024). We combine the $H_0$ posterior for $5$ new standard sirens with other $10$ previous events (3 with updated posteriors), finding $H_0 = 69.9^{+13.3}_{-12.0}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% Highest Density Interval) with the catalog method alone. This result represents an improvement of $\\sim 23\\%$ comparing the new $15$ dark siren constrain with the previous $10$ dark siren constraint, and a reduction in uncertainty of $\\sim 40\\%$ from the combination of $15$ dark and bright sirens compared with the GW170817 bright siren alone. The combination of dark and bright siren GW170817 with recent jet constraints yields $H_0$ of $68.0^{+4.3}_{-3.8}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, a $\\sim 6\\%$ precision from Standard Sirens, reducing the previous constraint uncertainty by $\\sim 10\\%$ .\n\nBunches of swaying and spinning plasma jets in the solar atmosphere - the spicules - exhibit a variety of complex dynamics that are clearly observed in the images of the solar limb. Utilizing three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics (rMHD) simulation data, we uncover another facet of a forest of spicules that turns out to be a manifestation of the two-dimensional plasma drapery, instead of one-dimensional conical spikes. This fluted morphology is observed in other contexts like molecular clouds, auroras, and coronal loops. Further, using a sequence of high-cadence line-of-sight integrated images, generated from our simulation, we obtain multiple episodes of spinning amongst clusters of synthetic spicules, also reported in observations near the solar limb. This perception of rotation, according to our findings, is associated with hot swirling plasma columns, extending to coronal heights - that we label as coronal swirling conduits (CoSCo).\n\nPolar dust has been discovered in a number of local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with radiation-driven torus models predicting a wind to be its main driver. However, little is known about its characteristics, spatial extent, or connection to the larger scale outflows. We present the first JWST/MIRI study aimed at imaging polar dust by zooming onto the heart of ESO 428-G14, part of the GATOS survey of local AGN. We clearly detect extended mid-infrared (MIR) emission within 200 pc from the nucleus. This polar structure is co-linear with a radio jet and lies perpendicular to a molecular gas lane that feeds and obscures the nucleus. The morphology of the MIR structure bears a striking resemblance to that of gas ionised by the AGN in the narrow-line region (NLR). We demonstrate that part of this spatial correspondence is due to contamination within the JWST filter bands from strong emission lines. Correcting for the contamination using ancillary spectroscopy, we find the morphology of the dust continuum to be asymmetric around the nucleus and more compact, though still clearly extended out to r ~ 100 pc. We estimate a temperature of the emitting dust of ~ 120 K. Using simple models, we find that the heating of small dust grains (~ 0.01 microns) by the radiation from the central AGN and/or radiative jet-induced shocks is responsible for the extended MIR emission. Large-grained dust, predicted by models of radiation-driven dusty winds from the torus, is unlikely to be important. This has important implications for scales to which AGN winds can carry dust and dense gas out into their host galaxies.\n\nThe recent SH0ES determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0=73.04\\pm1.04$ km/s/Mpc, deviates significantly by $\\approx5\\sigma$ from the \\textit{Planck} value, stimulating discussions on cosmological model extensions. To minimize statistical uncertainty and mitigate sensitivity to systematic errors in any single anchor distance determination, SH0ES combines Cepheids from various observations, including those from Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) host galaxies, NGC 4258, and closer galaxies (MW, LMC, SMC, and M31), although this mixed sample may introduce unknown or subtle systematic errors due to comparing distant and closer Cepheids. To address this, we propose a subset excluding Cepheids from the closer galaxies, retaining only the NGC 4258 water megamasers as a single anchor, circumventing potential systematic errors associated with observational methods and reduction techniques. Focusing solely on these Cepheids yields competitive statistical errors, approximately $2.5\\%$, sufficient to identify a $\\approx3\\sigma$ tension with the \\textit{Planck} $H_0$ value. Our approach offers an opportunity to utilize optical photometry with systematic uncertainty smaller than the statistical uncertainty, potentially achieving higher precision than NIR photometry, given the lower optical background. However, currently the optical photometry sample's fidelity does not match that of NIR photometry. The significant Hubble tension obtained is unrelated to Cepheids and we discuss other options.\n\nContext. Within $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) simulations, Milky Way-like galaxies accrete some of their satellite galaxies in groups of 3-5 members rather than individually. It was also suggested that this might be the reason behind the origin of satellite planes. Objects accreted in groups are expected to share similar specific total energy and angular momentum, and also identical orbital planes and directions. Aims. Looking at observations of Milky Way satellites, the dwarf galaxies Leo II, IV, V, Crater II, and the star cluster Crater 1 were proposed to be a vestige of group infall. The suggested \"Crater-Leo group\" shows a coherent distance gradient and all these objects align along a great circle on the sky. We use proper motion data to investigate whether the phase-space distribution of the members of the proposed group are indeed consistent with group infall. Methods. To further investigate this possibility, we use Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proper motions, $(\\mu_{\\alpha*}, \\mu_\\delta) = (-0.1921 \\pm 0.0514, -0.0686 \\pm 0.0523)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo IV and $(\\mu_{\\alpha*}, \\mu_\\delta) = (0.1186 \\pm 0.1943, -0.1183 \\pm 0.1704)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo V, to derive accurate orbital properties for the proposed group objects. In addition, we explore other possible members of this putative association. Results. Leo II, Leo IV, and Crater 1 show orbital properties consistent with those we predict from assuming group infall. However, our results suggest that Crater II was not accreted with the rest of the objects. If confirmed with increasingly accurate proper motions in the future, the Crater-Leo objects appear to constitute the first identified case of a cosmologically expected, typical group infall event, as opposed to the highly hierarchical Magellanic Cloud system.\n\nParker Solar Probe measurements have recently shown that coherent fast magnetosonic and Alfv\\'{e}n ion-cyclotron waves are abundant in the solar wind and can be accompanied by higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations. In this letter we reveal the nonlinear process capable of channelling the energy of low-frequency electromagnetic to higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations observed aboard Parker Solar Probe. We present Hall-MHD simulations demonstrating that low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuations can resonate with the ion-sound mode, which results in steepening of plasma density fluctuations, electrostatic spikes and harmonics in the electric field spectrum. The resonance can occur around the wavenumber determined by the ratio between local sound and Alfv\\'{e}n speeds, but only in the case of {\\it oblique} propagation to the background magnetic field. The resonance wavenumber, its width and steepening time scale are estimated, and all indicate that the revealed two-wave resonance can frequently occur in the solar wind. This process can be a potential channel of energy transfer from cyclotron resonant ions producing the electromagnetic fluctuations to Landau resonant ions and electrons absorbing the energy of the higher-frequency electrostatic fluctuations.\n\nModeling the detection of life has never been more opportune. With next generation space telescopes, like the currently developing Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) concept, we will begin to characterize rocky exoplanets potentially similar to Earth. However, currently, few realistic planetary spectra containing surface biosignatures have been paired with direct imaging telescope instrument models. Therefore, we use a HWO instrument noise model to assess the detection of surface biosignatures affiliated with oxygenic, anoxygenic, and nonphotosynthetic extremophiles. We pair the HWO telescope model to a 1-D radiative transfer model to estimate the required exposure times necessary for detecting each biosignature on planets with global microbial coverage and varying atmospheric water vapor concentrations. For modeled planets with 0% - 50% cloud coverage, we determine pigments and the red edge could be detected within 1,000 hours (100 hours) at distances within 15 pc (11 pc). However, tighter telescope inner working angles (2.5 lambda/D) would allow surface biosignature detection at further distances. Anoxygenic photosynthetic biosignatures could also be more easily detectable than nonphotosynthetic pigments and the photosynthetic red edge when compared against a false positive iron oxide slope. Future life detection missions should evaluate the influence of false positives on the detection of multiple surface biosignatures.\n\nAims. A new mechanism of dust accumulation and planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable disk with suppressed magnetorotational instability is studied and compared with the classical dead zone in a layered disk model. Methods. We use numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit FEOSAD code to model the formation and long-term evolution of gravitationally unstable disks, including dust dynamics and growth. Results. We found that in gravitationally unstable disks with a radially varying strength of gravitational instability a region of low mass and angular momentum transport forms in the inner several astronomical units. This region is characterized by low effective \\alpha_GI and is similar in characteristics to the dead zone in the layered disk model. As the disk forms and evolves, the GI-induced dead zone accumulates a massive dust ring, which is susceptible to the development of the streaming instability. The model and observationally inferred dust masses and radii may differ significantly in gravitationally unstable disks with massive inner dust rings. Conclusions. The early occurrence of the GI-induced dust ring followed by the presumed development of the streaming instability suggest that this mechanism may form the first generation of planetesimals in the inner terrestrial zone of the disk. The proposed mechanism, however, crucially depends on the susceptibility of the disk to gravitational instability and requires that the magnetorotational instability be suppressed.\n\nRecent observations have led to the discovery of numerous optically selected binaries containing an undetected component with mass consistent with a compact object (neutron star or white dwarf). Using the the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory we have carried out X-ray and UV observations of a small sample of these binaries. Four systems are wide (with orbital period P>300 d), and they were chosen because of their small distance (d<250 pc) and the mass of the collapsed component favoring a neutron star. Two other are compact systems (P<0.9 d), with convincing evidence of containing a neutron star. The source 2MASS J15274848$+$3536572 was detected in the X-ray band, with a flux of 5E-13 erg/cm2/s and a spectrum well fitted by a power law or a thermal plasma emission model. This source also showed an UV (2200 Angstrom) excess, which might indicate the presence of mass accretion. For the other targets we derived X-ray flux upper limits of the order of 1E-13}$ erg/cm2/s . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the collapsed component in these six systems are neutron stars.\n\nIn disk wind models for active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows, high-energy radiation poses a significant problem wherein the gas can become overionized, effectively disabling what is often inferred to be the largest force acting on the gas: the radiation force due to spectral line opacity. Calculations of this radiation force depend on the magnitude of ionizing radiation, which can strongly depend on the position above a disk where the radiation is anisotropic. As our first step to quantify the position and direction dependence of the radiation field, we assumed free streaming of photons and computed energy distributions of the mean intensity and components of flux as well as energy-integrated quantities such as mean photon energy. We find a significant dependence of radiation field properties on position, but this dependence is not necessarily the same for different field quantities. A key example is that the mean intensity is much softer than the radial flux at many points near the disk. Because the mean intensity largely controls ionization, this softening decreases the severity of the overionization problem. The position dependence of mean intensity implies the position dependence of gas opacity, which we illustrate by computing the radiation force a fluid element feels in an accelerating wind. We find that in a vertical accelerating flow, the force due to radiation is not parallel to the radiation flux. This misalignment is due to the force's geometric weighting by both the velocity field's directionality and the position dependence of the mean intensity.\n\nO-type stars are known to significantly contribute to both the dynamics and evolution of galaxies. Massive and luminous, they probably control and regulate the galaxies star formation rates. For this work I performed a redetermination of the spectral types and effective temperatures of the Galactic O-type stars MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273. From a careful examination of the spectral features present in the blue optical spectral region, it was possible to identify several nitrogen lines usually only seen in the blue optical spectra of O2-O3 stars. From the nitrogen ionic equivalent width ratios measured in the spectra of MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273, and in those of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, earlier spectral types and hotter effective temperature values were derived. Two O2V, together with three new O3V stars, are now firmly identified in the Westerlund 2 region. Besides RFS1 in NGC3603, the O2 stars found in Westerlund 2 are the only other exemplars known to date in the Milky Way. From the nitrogen equivalent width line ratios measured in the spectra of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, linear relations between the NIV4058-NIII4640 ratio and the effective temperature in the 47000K-51000K range were derived. Based on my spectroscopic analysis of the science targets and the use of a HRD, a mean heliocentric distance of 5kpc to Westerlund 2 was computed, a result that is in line with the mean heliocentric distance of 5.3(1.5) kpc obtained from the associated Gaia DR3 parallaxes and distances. The Westerlund 2 massive stars studied in this work probably share a common evolutionary process that might be representative of the evolutionary ages of a large fraction of the cluster's O-type stellar population, which seems to be much younger than 1 Myrs.\n\nWe analyse a sample of massive disk galaxies selected from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey to investigate how the evolution of these galaxies depends on their stellar and halo masses. We applied a semi-analytic spectral fitting approach to the data from different regions in the galaxies to derive several of their key physical properties. From the best-fit model results, together with direct observables such as morphology, colour, and the Mgb/$\\langle$Fe$\\rangle$ index ratio measured within $1 R_{\\rm e}$, we find that for central galaxies both their stellar and halo masses have a significant influence in their evolution. For a given halo mass, galaxies with higher stellar mass accumulate their stellar mass and become chemically enriched earlier than those with smaller stellar mass. Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, galaxies living in more massive halos have longer star-formation timescales and are delayed in becoming chemically enriched. In contrast, the evolution of massive satellite galaxies is mostly determined by their stellar mass. The results indicate that both the assembled halo mass and the halo assembly history impact the evolution of central galaxies. Our spatially resolved analysis indicates that only the galaxy properties in the central region ($0.0$--$0.5 R_{\\rm e}$) show the dependencies described above. This fact supports a halo-driven formation scenario since the galaxies' central regions are more likely to contain old stars formed along with the halo itself, keeping a memory of the halo formation process.\n\nWe present results from simultaneous modeling of 2D (projected along the line of sight) position, proper motion and line-of-sight velocity for \\textit{Gaia}- and APOGEE-observed stars near the centre of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We use a mixture model that allows for independent sub-populations contributed by the Sgr galaxy, its nuclear star cluster M54, and the Milky Way foreground. We find an offset of $0.295\\pm 0.029$ degrees between the inferred centroids of Sgr and M54, corresponding to a (projected) physical separation of $0.135\\pm 0.013$ kpc. The detected offset might plausibly be driven by unmodelled asymmetry in Sgr's stellar configuration; however, standard criteria for model selection favour our symmetric model over an alternative that allows for bilateral asymmetry. We infer an offset between the proper motion centres of Sgr and M54 of $[\\Delta\\mu_{\\alpha}\\cos\\delta,\\Delta\\mu_{\\delta}]=[4.9, -19.7] \\pm [6.8, 6.2]$ $\\mu$as yr$^{-1}$, with magnitude similar to the covariance expected due to spatially-correlated systematic error. We infer an offset of $4.1\\pm 1.2$ km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity. Using inferred values for the systemic positions and motions of Sgr and M54 as initial conditions, we calculate the recent orbital history of a simplified Sgr/M54 system, which we demonstrate to be sensitive to any line-of-sight distance offset between M54 and Sgr, and to the distribution of dark matter within Sgr.\n\nWe revisit the evolution of low-mass close binary systems under different magnetic braking (MB) prescriptions. We study binaries with a neutron star accretor. During mass transfer episodes, these systems emit X-rays and are known as Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). When mass transfer stops, they can be observed as binary pulsars. Additionally, some of these systems can experience mass transfer while having orbital periods of less than 1 hr, thus evolving into ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). The evolution of LMXBs depends on their capability to lose angular momentum and maintain stable mass transfer. Among the angular momentum loss mechanisms, MB is one important, and still uncertain phenomenon. The standard MB prescription faces some problems when calculating LMXB evolution, leading to, e.g., a fine-tuning problem in the formation of UCXBs. Recent studies proposed new MB prescriptions, yielding diverse outcomes. Here, we investigate the effects of three novel MB prescriptions on the evolution of LMXBs using our stellar code. We found that all MB prescriptions considered allow the formation of binaries with orbital periods spanning from less than one hour to more than tens of days. Remarkably, our results enable the occurrence of wide systems even for the MB law that causes the strongest angular momentum losses and very high mass transfer rates. We found that models computed with the strongest MB prescription reach the UCXB state starting from a wider initial orbital period interval. Finally, we discuss and compare our results with observations and previous studies performed on this topic.\n\nJWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to $5.3\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H$\\alpha$ out to $z = 7$ and [O III] to $z = 9.5$. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647$-$JD at $z = 10.165$. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H$\\alpha$ at $9\\sigma$, [O III]$\\,\\lambda5008$ at $11\\sigma$, and [O III]$\\,\\lambda4960$ at $3\\sigma$. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]$\\,\\lambda4363$, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a $z > 10$ galaxy: $12+{\\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\\pm0.09$, or $0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\\,Z_{\\odot}$. This is similar to galaxies at $z \\sim 4 - 9$ with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate ${\\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \\pm 0.3$. We further constrain the ionization parameter ${\\rm log}(U)$ = $-1.9 \\pm 0.1$, ionizing photon production efficiency ${\\rm log}(\\xi_{\\rm ion})$ = $25.3\\pm0.1$, and star formation rate $5.0\\pm0.6\\,M_{\\odot}/{\\rm yr}$ within the past $10\\,{\\rm Myr}$. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first $500$ million years.\n\nWe present JWST/NIRSpec high-resolution spectroscopy G395H/F290LP of MACS0647-JD, a gravitationally lensed galaxy merger at $z=10.167$. The new spectroscopy, which is acquired for the two lensed images (JD1 and JD2), detects and resolves emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and blue optical, including the resolved [OII]3726,3729 doublet, [NeIII]3870, [HeI]3890, H$\\delta$, H$\\gamma$, and [OIII]4363. This is the first observation of the resolved [OII]3726,3729 doublet for a galaxy at $z>8$. We measure a line flux ratio [OII]3729/3726 $= 0.9 \\pm 0.3$, which corresponds to an estimated electron density of $\\log(n_{e} / \\rm{cm}^{-3}) = 2.9 \\pm 0.5$. This is significantly higher than the electron densities of local galaxies reported in the literature. We compile the measurements from the literature and further analyze the redshift evolution of $n_{e}$. We find that the redshift evolution follows the power-law form of $n_{e} = A\\times (1+z)^{p}$ with $A=54^{+31}_{-23}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $p=1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$. This power-law form may be explained by a combination of metallicity and morphological evolution of galaxies, which become, on average, more metal-poor and more compact with increasing redshift.\n\nWe model the spectral formation occurring in the binary X-ray pulsar RX~J0209.6-7427 during the 2019 super-Eddington outburst. Using a theoretical model previously developed by the authors, we are able to produce spectra that closely resemble the phase-averaged X-ray spectra observed using NuSTAR and Insight-HXMT during low and high luminosity states of the outburst, respectively. The theoretical model simulates the accretion of fully ionized gas in a dipole magnetic field, and includes a complete description of the radiation hydrodynamics, matter distribution, and spectral formation. Type II X-ray outbursts provide an opportunity to study accretion over a large range of luminosities for the same neutron star. The analysis performed here represents the first time both the outburst low and high states of an accretion-powered X-ray pulsar are modeled using a physics-based model rather than standard phenomenological fitting with arbitrary mathematical functions. We find the outer polar cap radius remains constant and the column is more fully-filled with increasing luminosity, Comptonized bremsstrahlung dominates the formation of the phase-averaged X-ray spectrum, and a negative correlation exists between cyclotron centroid energy and luminosity, as expected. The super-Eddington nature of the outburst is rendered possible due to the low scattering cross section for photons propagating parallel to the magnetic field. We also find emission through the column top dominates in both the low and high states, implying the pulse profiles should have a roughly sinusoidal shape, which agrees with observed properties of ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars.\n\nWe present a JWST imaging survey with NIRCam and MIRI of NGC 346, the brightest star-forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). By combining aperture and point spread function (PSF) photometry of eleven wavelength bands across these two instruments, we have detected more than 200,000 unique sources. Using near-infrared (IR) color analysis, we observe various evolved and young populations, including 196 young stellar objects (YSOs) and pre-main sequence stars suitable for forthcoming spectroscopic studies. We expand upon this work, creating mid-IR color-magnitude diagrams and determining color cuts to identify 833 reddened sources which are YSO candidates. We observe that these candidate sources are spatially associated with regions of dusty, filamentary nebulosity. Furthermore, we fit model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to a selection of sources with detections across all of our MIRI bands. We classify with a high degree of confidence 23 YSOs in this sample and estimate their radii, bolometric temperatures, luminosities, and masses. We detect YSOs approaching 1 solar mass, the lowest-mass extragalactic YSOs confirmed to date.\n\nWhile galaxy rotation curves provide one of the most powerful methods for measuring dark matter profiles in the inner regions of rotation-supported galaxies, at the dwarf scale there are factors that can complicate this analysis. Given the expectation of a universal profile in dark matter-only simulations, the diversity of observed rotation curves has become an often-discussed issue in Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology on galactic scales. We analyze a suite of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of $10^{10}-10^{12}$ $M_\\odot$ halos with standard cold dark matter, and compare the true circular velocity to rotation curve reconstructions. We find that, for galaxies with well-ordered gaseous disks, the measured rotation curve may deviate from true circular velocity by at most 10% within the radius of the disk. However, non-equilibrium behavior, non-circular motions, and non-thermal and non-kinetic stresses may cause much larger discrepancies of 50% or more. Most rotation curve reconstructions underestimate the true circular velocity, while some reconstructions transiently over-estimate it in the central few kiloparsecs due to dynamical phenomena. We further demonstrate that the features that contribute to these failures are not always visibly obvious in HI observations. If such dwarf galaxies are included in galaxy catalogs, they may give rise to the appearance of \"artificial\" rotation curve diversity that does not reflect the true variation in underlying dark matter profiles.\n\nOver twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) [arXiv:astro-ph/9805201, arXiv:astro-ph/9812133] observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$. Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from $z \\approx 0$ to $z \\approx 7.5$. Utilising a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the $\\text{L}-\\sigma$ relation, correlating the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach maps the Universe's expansion over more than 12 billion years, covering 95\\% of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space $\\lbrace h, \\Omega_m, w_0\\rbrace = \\lbrace 0.731\\pm0.039, 0.302^{+0.12}_{-0.069}, -1.01^{+0.52}_{-0.29}\\rbrace $ (statistical) for a flat Universe. These results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and suggest uniformity in the photo-kinematical properties of young massive ionizing clusters in giant HII regions and HII galaxies across most of the Universe's history.\n\nMillisecond pulsars (MSPs) are known for their long-term stability. Using six years of observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the X-ray timing results for six MSPs: PSRs B1937+21, B1821$-$24, J0437$-$4715, J0030+0451, J0218+4232, and J2124$-$3358. The timing stability parameter $\\sigma_z$ has been calculated, revealing remarkable timing precision on the order of $10^{-14}$ for PSRs B1937+21 and J0437$-$4715, and $10^{-13}$ for PSRs B1821$-$24, J0218+4232, and J0030+0451 over a timescale of 1000 days. These findings underscore the feasibility of autonomous in-orbit timekeeping using X-ray observations of MSPs. In addition, the consistency of long-term spin-down noise in the X-ray and radio bands has been investigated by comparison with IPTA radio data.\n\nA binary stellar system that ventures too close to a supermassive black hole can become tidally separated. In this article, we investigate the role of relativistic effects in these encounters through 3-body simulations. We use the Hybrid Relativistic-Newtonian Approximation (HRNA), which combines the exact relativistic acceleration from a Schwarzschild black hole with a Newtonian description of the binary's self-gravity. This method is compared against Newtonian and Post-Newtonian (1PN) simulations. Our findings show good agreement between HRNA and 1PN results, both of which exhibit substantial differences from Newtonian simulations. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced in retrograde encounters, where relativistic simulations predict up to $30\\%$ more separation events and an earlier onset of binary separation ($\\beta=2$ compared to $2.5$ in Newtonian simulations, with $\\beta$ the impact parameter). Additionally, the HRNA model predicts about 15$\\%$ more potential extreme mass ratio inspirals and generate a higher number of hypervelocity star candidates, with velocities up to 2,000 km/s faster than those predicted from Newtonian simulations. Furthermore, compared to Newtonian cases, relativistic encounters are more likely to result in direct stellar collisions and binary mergers.\n\nSince synchrotron polarization fluctuations are related to the fundamental properties of the magnetic field, we propose the polarization intensity variance to measure the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) magnetization. We confirm the method's applicability by comparing it with the polarization angle dispersion and its reliability by measuring the underlying Alfv\\'enic Mach number of MHD turbulence. With the finding of the power-law relation of $\\mathcal{A} \\propto M_{\\rm A}^{2}$ between polarization intensity variance $\\mathcal{A}$ and Alfv\\'enic Mach number $M_{\\rm A}$, we apply the new technique to the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) data, achieving Alfv\\'enic Mach number of the Galactic ISM. Our results show that the low-latitude Galactic ISM is dominated by sub-Alf\\'enic turbulence, with $M_{\\rm A}$ approximately between 0.5 and 1.0.\n\nContext : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time. Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe. Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471. Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy. Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.\n\nThe mass ($M_\\mathrm{BH}$) of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be measured using spatially-resolved kinematics of the region where the SMBH dominates gravitationally. The most reliable measurements are those that resolve the smallest physical scales around the SMBHs. We consider here three metrics to compare the physical scales probed by kinematic tracers dominated by rotation: the radius of the innermost detected kinematic tracer $R_\\mathrm{min}$ normalised by respectively the SMBH's Schwarzschild radius ($R_\\mathrm{Schw}\\equiv 2GM_\\mathrm{BH}/c^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ the speed of light), sphere-of-influence (SOI) radius ($R_\\mathrm{SOI}\\equiv GM_\\mathrm{BH}/\\sigma_\\mathrm{e}^2$, where $\\sigma_\\mathrm{e}$ is the stellar velocity dispersion within the galaxy's effective radius) and equality radius (the radius $R_\\mathrm{eq}$ at which the SMBH mass equals the enclosed stellar mass, $M_\\mathrm{BH}=M_*(R_\\mathrm{eq})$, where $M_*(R)$ is the stellar mass enclosed within the radius $R$). All metrics lead to analogous simple relations between $R_\\mathrm{min}$ and the highest circular velocity probed $V_\\mathrm{c}$. Adopting these metrics to compare the SMBH mass measurements using molecular gas kinematics to those using megamaser kinematics, we demonstrate that the best molecular gas measurements resolve material that is physically closer to the SMBHs in terms of $R_\\mathrm{Schw}$ but is slightly farther in terms of $R_\\mathrm{SOI}$ and $R_\\mathrm{eq}$. However, molecular gas observations of nearby galaxies using the most extended configurations of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array can resolve the SOI comparably well and thus enable SMBH mass measurements as precise as the best megamaser measurements.\n\nThe nature of the minute-to-hour long Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) localised by telescopes such as Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton remains mysterious, with numerous models suggested for the events. Here, we report multi-wavelength observations of EP240315a, a 1600 s long transient detected by the Einstein Probe, showing it to have a redshift of z=4.859. We measure a low column density of neutral hydrogen, indicating that the event is embedded in a low-density environment, further supported by direct detection of leaking ionising Lyman-continuum. The observed properties are consistent with EP240315a being a long-duration gamma-ray burst, and these observations support an interpretation in which a significant fraction of the FXT population are lower-luminosity examples of similar events. Such transients are detectable at high redshifts by the Einstein Probe and, in the (near) future, out to even larger distances by SVOM, THESEUS, and Athena, providing samples of events into the epoch of reionisation.\n\nNested sampling parameter estimation differs from evidence estimation, in that it incurs an additional source of error. This error affects estimates of parameter means and credible intervals in gravitational wave analyses and beyond, and yet, it is typically not accounted for in standard error estimation methods. In this paper, we present two novel methods to quantify this error more accurately for any chain based nested sampler, using the additional likelihood calls made at runtime in producing independent samples. Using injected signals of black hole binary coalescences as an example, we first show concretely that the usual error estimation method is insufficient to capture the true error bar on parameter estimates. We then demonstrate how the extra points in the chains of chain based samplers may be carefully utilised to estimate this error correctly, and provide a way to check the accuracy of the resulting error bars. Finally, we discuss how this error affects $p$-$p$ plots and coverage assessments.\n\nT Tauri stars are known to be magnetically active stars subject to strong flares observed in X-rays. These flares are likely due to intense magnetic reconnection events during which a part of the stored magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of supra-thermal particles. Since T Tauri stars are surrounded by an accretion disc, these particles may influence the disc dynamics and chemistry. This work continues on a previous stationary model, which showed that energetic particles accelerated during flares can produce a strong ionisation rate at high column densities in the inner accretion disc. The present model includes non-stationary sequences of flaring events sampled by a Chandra X-ray survey of nearby young stellar objects. We calculate the averaged ionisation rate expected in a radius range from 0.08 to 0.6 au from the central star. We confirm that energetic particles produced by the flares dominate the ionisation of the disc up to column densities of $10^{25}~\\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We further study the main consequences of this additional source of ionisation on the viscosity, the accretion rate, the volumetric heating rate and the chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.\n\nThe discovery of a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet candidate in the light curve of the star TIC 107150013 observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has recently been announced. A short-duration (~0.5 day), low-amplitude (~0.06 mag) brightening in the TESS light curve was interpreted as a short-timescale gravitational microlensing event. However, the purported event occurred far from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane (l~ 239 deg, b ~ -5 deg), on a relatively nearby (~3.2 kpc) star, making the microlensing interpretation unlikely. Here, we report the archival photometric observations of TIC 107150013 collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2018 through 2020. The archival OGLE light curve reveals periodic variability indicative of starspots on the surface of the star. The presence of starspots indicates magnetic activity of the star, which may also manifest as stellar flares. We interpret the brightening of TIC 107150013 seen in the TESS data as the stellar flare. We present similar flaring stars detected in the archival OGLE data, mimicking short-timescale, low-amplitude microlensing events. Such stars may be a source of non-negligible false positive detections in the planned space-based microlensing surveys.\n\nWe present eclipse maps of the two-dimensional thermal emission from the dayside of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, derived from an observation of a phase curve with the JWST MIRI/LRS instrument. The observed eclipse shapes deviate significantly from those expected for a planet emitting uniformly over its surface. We fit a map to this deviation, constructed from spherical harmonics up to order $\\ell_{\\rm max}=2$, alongside the planetary, orbital, stellar, and systematic parameters. This yields a map with a meridionally-averaged eastward hot-spot shift of $(7.75 \\pm 0.36)^{\\circ}$, with no significant degeneracy between the map and the additional parameters. We show the latitudinal and longitudinal contributions of the day-side emission structure to the eclipse shape, finding a latitudinal signal of $\\sim$200 ppm and a longitudinal signal of $\\sim$250 ppm. To investigate the sensitivity of the map to the method, we fix the non-mapping parameters and derive an \"eigenmap\" fitted with an optimised number of orthogonal phase curves, which yields a similar map to the $\\ell_{\\rm max}=2$ map. We also fit a map up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}=3$, which shows a smaller hot-spot shift, with a larger uncertainty. These maps are similar to those produced by atmospheric simulations. We conclude that there is a significant mapping signal which constrains the spherical harmonic components of our model up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}=2$. Alternative mapping models may derive different structures with smaller-scale features; we suggest that further observations of WASP-43b and other planets will drive the development of more robust methods and more accurate maps.\n\nGiant planets exhibit diverse orbital properties, hinting at their distinct formation and dynamic histories. In this paper, using $\\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, we investigate if and how the orbital properties of Jupiters are linked to their host star properties, particularly their metallicity and age. We obtain metallicities for main sequence stars of spectral type F, G, and K, hosting hot, warm, and cold Jupiters with varying eccentricities. We compute the velocity dispersion of host stars of these three groups using kinematic information from $\\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 and obtain average ages using velocity dispersion-age relation. We find that host stars of hot Jupiters are relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]=$0.18 \\pm 0.13$) and young ( median age $3.97 \\pm 0.51$ Gyr) compared to the host stars of cold Jupiters in nearly circular orbits, which are relatively metal-poor ($0.03 \\pm 0.18$) and older (median age $6.07 \\pm 0.79$ Gyr). Host stars of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits, on the other hand, show metallicities similar to that of the hosts of hot Jupiters, but are older, on average (median age $6.25 \\pm 0.92$ Gyr). The similarity in metallicity between hosts of hot Jupiters and hosts of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits supports high eccentricity migration as the potential origin of hot Jupiters, with the latter serving as the progenitors. However, the average age difference between them suggests that the older hot Jupiters may have been engulfed by the star in a timescale of $\\sim 6$ Gyr. This allows us to estimate the value of stellar tidal quality factor $Q'_\\ast\\sim10^{6\\pm1}$.\n\nThe first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9Msol < Mini < 120Msol starting with an initial rotation on the Zero Age Main Sequence equal to 70% of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in case mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal or larger than the critical velocity. Impact on the ionising flux appears modest when compared to moderately-rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above ~20Msol, the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences on the sizes of the He- and CO-cores and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation impacts significantly the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.\n\nWith its 12 optical filters, the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) provides an unprecedented multicolor view of the local Universe. The third data release (DR3) covers 3,192 deg$^2$ and contains 47.4 million objects. However, the classification algorithms currently implemented in its pipeline are deterministic and based solely on the sources morphology. Our goal is classify the sources identified in the J-PLUS DR3 images into stars, quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and galaxies. For this task, we present BANNJOS, a machine learning pipeline that uses Bayesian neural networks to provide the probability distribution function (PDF) of the classification. BANNJOS is trained on photometric, astrometric, and morphological data from J-PLUS DR3, Gaia DR3, and CatWISE2020, using over 1.2 million objects with spectroscopic classification from SDSS DR18, LAMOST DR9, DESI EDR, and Gaia DR3. Results are validated using $1.4 10^5$ objects and cross-checked against theoretical model predictions. BANNJOS outperforms all previous classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, and completeness across the entire magnitude range. It delivers over 95% accuracy for objects brighter than $r = 21.5$ mag, and ~90% accuracy for those up to $r = 22$ mag, where J-PLUS completeness is < 25%. BANNJOS is also the first object classifier to provide the full probability distribution function (PDF) of the classification, enabling precise object selection for high purity or completeness, and for identifying objects with complex features, like active galactic nuclei with resolved host galaxies. BANNJOS has effectively classified J-PLUS sources into around 20 million galaxies, 1 million QSOs, and 26 million stars, with full PDFs for each, which allow for later refinement of the sample. The upcoming J-PAS survey, with its 56 color bands, will further enhance BANNJOS's ability to detail each source's nature.\n\nSN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\\;\\rm{M_\\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.\n\nUltrarelativistic particles called cosmic rays permeate the Milky Way, propagating through the Galactic turbulent magnetic fields. The mechanisms under which these particles increase their energy can be reasonably described by current theories of acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays. There are, however, still many open questions as to how to reach petaelectronvolt (PeV) energies, the maximum energy believed to be attained in our Galaxy, and in which astrophysical sources (dubbed {\\it PeVatrons}) this ultra-high energy acceleration happens. In this article, we describe the theoretical conditions for plasma acceleration to these energies, and the Galactic sources in which these conditions are possible. These theoretical predictions are then confronted with the latest experimental results, summarising the state-of-the-art of our current knowledge of PeVatrons. We finally describe the prospects to keep advancing the understanding of these elusive objects, still unidentified more than one hundred years after the discovery of cosmic rays.\n\nWe explore the potential of polarimetry as a tool for detecting and characterizing exorings. For that purpose, we have improved the publicly available photometric code Pryngles by adding the results of radiative transfer calculations that fully include polarization and scattering by irregularly shaped particles. With this improved code, we compute the total and polarized fluxes and the degree of polarization of a ringed gas giant along its orbit. We vary key model parameters such as the orbit inclination, ring size and orientation, particle albedo and optical thickness, and demonstrate the versatility of our code by predicting the total and polarized fluxes of the \"puffed-up\" planet HIP41378f assuming this planet has an opaque dusty ring. We find that spatially unresolved dusty rings can significantly modify the flux and polarization signals of the light that is reflected. Rings are expected to have a low polarization signal and will generally decrease the degree of polarization as the ring casts a shadow on the planet and/or blocks part of the light the planet reflects. During ring-plane crossings, when the thin ring is illuminated edge-on, a ringed exoplanet's flux and degree of polarization are close to those of a ring-less planet and generally appear as sharp changes in the flux and polarization curves. Ringed planets in edge-on orbits tend to be difficult to distinguish from ring-less planets in reflected flux and degree of polarization. We show that if HIP41378f is surrounded by a ring, its reflected flux (compared to the star) will be of the order of $10^{-9}$, and the ring would decrease the degree of polarization in a detectable way. The improved version of the photometric code Pryngles that we present here shows that dusty rings may produce distinct polarimetric features in light curves across a wide range of orbital configurations, orientations and ring optical properties.\n\nStudies of the rotation and activity of M type stars are essential to enhance our understanding of stellar dynamos and angular momentum evolution. Using the outstanding photometric capabilities of space telescopes rotation signals even with low amplitudes can be investigated in up to now unrivaled detail. By combining data of K2 and the TESS prime mission the star spot activity of M dwarfs can be monitored on half a decade timescale. In the framework of our study on the rotation-activity relation for bright and nearby M dwarfs we also aim at an investigation of the long-term activity. While K2 was observing fields distributed around the ecliptic plane, the TESS prime mission was oriented along a line of ecliptic longitude with one camera centered on an ecliptic pole. Due to these different observing strategies, the overlap between K2 and the TESS prime mission is marginal. However, 45 stars from our sample were observed with both missions of which two early M-type stars that fulfill our selection criteria, EPIC 202059229 and EPIC 245919787, were analyzed in more detail. We found that for both stars the rotation period did not change while the rotational phase did change for EPIC 245919787 by ~0.2. The amplitude of the spot induced variability changed for both stars but more significant for EPIC 245919787. By comparing the cumulative flare frequency distributions we found that the flare activity for EPIC 202059229 is unchanged while it slightly changes for EPIC 245919787 between the K2 and TESS epochs. Using a combination of light curves from K2 and TESS that span a baseline up to 4.5 years we could measure significant differential rotation for EPIC 245919787. Furthermore, we show that combining missions like K2 and TESS is a promising method for detecting stellar activity cycles.\n\nIn this work, we investigated the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in a sample of galaxies with Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Regions (LINERs) in their nucleus. Optical spectroscopic data (3 600 - 10 000 {\\AA}) of 40 LINERs from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies (MaNGA) survey were considered. Only objects classified as retired galaxies, i.e. whose main ionization sources are post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (pAGB) stars, were selected. The abundance estimates were obtained through detailed photoionization models built with the cloudy code to reproduce a set of observational emission line intensities ratios of the sample. Our results show that LINERs have oxygen and nitrogen abundances in the ranges of $ 8.0 \\leq 12+\\log(O/H) \\leq 9.0$ (mean value $8.74\\pm 0.27$) and $7.6 \\leq 12+\\log(N/H) \\leq 8.5$ (mean value $8.05\\pm 0.25$), respectively. About 70% of the sample have oversolar O/H and N/H abundances. Our abundance estimates are in consonance with those for Seyfert 2 nuclei and H ii regions with the highest metallicity, indicating that these distinct object classes show similar enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM). The LINERs in our sample are located in the higher N/O region of the N/O versus O/H diagram, showing an expected negative correlation between these two parameters. These results suggest that these LINERs mainly exhibit a secondary nitrogen production and could be acting some other mechanisms that deviate them from the usual theoretical secondary nitrogen production curve and the H ii regions observations. However, we did not find any evidence in our data able to support the literature suggested mechanisms. On the other hand, our results show that LINERs do not present any correlation between the N/O abundances and the stellar masses of the hosting galaxies.\n\nWe report the detection of extended (>0.5-1kpc) high-ionization [MgIV] 4.487 $\\mu$m (80 eV) emission in four local luminous infrared galaxies observed with JWST/NIRSpec. Excluding the nucleus and outflow of the Type 1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the sample, we find that the [MgIV] luminosity is well correlated with that of H recombination lines, which mainly trace star forming clumps in these objects, and that the [ArVI] 4.530 $\\mu$m (75 eV), usually seen in AGN, is undetected. On 100-400pc scales, the [MgIV] line profiles are broader (sigma([MgIV])=90 +- 25 km/s) and shifted (Delta_v up to +- 50 km/s) compared to those of the H recombination lines and lower ionization transitions (e.g., sigma(Hu-12)=57 +- 15 km/s). The [MgIV] kinematics follow the large scale rotating velocity field of these galaxies and the broad [MgIV] profiles are compatible with the broad wings detected in the H recombination lines. Based on these observational results, extended highly ionized gas more turbulent than the ambient interstellar medium, possibly as a result of ionizing shocks associated with star-formation, is the most likely origin of the [MgIV] emission. We also computed new grids of photoionization and shock models to investigate where the [MgIV] line originates. Shocks with velocities of 100-130 km/s reproduce the observed line ratios and the [MgIV] luminosity agrees with that expected from the mechanical energy released by supernove (SNe) in these regions. Therefore, these models support shocks induced by SNe as the origin of the [MgIV] line. Future studies on the stellar feedback from SNe will benefit from the [MgIV] line that is little affected by obscuration and, in absence of an AGN, can only be produced by shocks due to its high ionization potential.\n\nProtostars are born in magnetized environments. As a consequence, the formation of protostellar disks can be suppressed by the magnetic field efficiently removing angular momentum of the infalling material. Non-ideal MHD effects are proposed to as one way to allow protostellar disks to form. Thus, it is important to understand their contributions in observations of protostellar systems. We derive an analytical equation to estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient at the edge of the protostellar disk in the Class 0/I protostar, HOPS-370, for the first time, under the assumption that the disk radius is set by ambipolar diffusion. Using previous results of the protostellar mass, disk mass, disk radius, density and temperature profiles and magnetic field strength, we estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to be $1.7^{+1.5}_{-1.4}\\times10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$. We quantify the contribution of ambipolar diffusion by estimating its dimensionless Els\\\"{a}sser number to be $\\sim1.7^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$, indicating its dynamical importance in this region. We compare to chemical calculations of the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient using the Non-Ideal magnetohydrodynamics Coefficients and Ionisation Library (NICIL), which is consistent with our results. In addition, we compare our derived ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to the diffusivity coefficients for Ohmic dissipation and the Hall effect, and find ambipolar diffusion is dominant in our density regime. These results demonstrate a new methodology to understand non-ideal MHD effects in observations of protostellar disks. More detailed modeling of the magnetic field, envelope and microphysics, along with a larger sample of protostellar systems is needed to further understand the contributions of non-ideal MHD.\n\nWe measure ejecta mass as a function of azimuthal and impact angle for 104 m/s oblique impacts into sand. We find that the ejecta mass distribution is strongly sensitive to azimuthal angle with up to 8 times more mass in ejecta on the downrange side compared to the uprange side. Crater radii, measured from the site of impact, are measured at different impact and azimuthal angles. Crater ejecta scaling laws are modified to depend on azimuthal and impact angle. We find that crater radii are sensitive to both impact and azimuthal angle but the ejecta mass as a function of both angles can be estimated from the cube of the crater radius without an additional angular dependent function. The ejecta distributions are relevant for processes that depend upon the integrated properties of intermediate velocity impacts occurring in the outer solar system and possibly during planetesimal formation.\n\nThe measurements of morphological indicators of galaxies are often influenced by a series of observational effects. In this study, we utilize a sample of over 800 TNG50 simulated galaxies with log($M_*$/M$_\\odot$)$>9$ at $0.5<z<3$ to investigate the differences in non-parametric morphological indicators ($C$, $S$, $Gini$, $M_{\\rm 20}$, $A_{\\rm O}$, and $D_{\\rm O}$) derived from noise-free and high-resolution TNG50 images and mock images simulated to have the same observational conditions as {\\it JWST}/NIRCam. We quantify the relationship between intrinsic and observed values of the morphological indicators and accordingly apply this calibration to over 4600 galaxies in the same stellar mass and redshift ranges observed in {\\it JWST} CEERS and JADES surveys. We find a significant evolution of morphological indicators with rest-frame wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\rm rf}$) at $\\lambda_{\\rm rf}<1$\\,$\\mu$m, while essentially no obvious variations occur at $\\lambda_{\\rm rf}>1$\\,$\\mu$m. The morphological indicators of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) are significantly different. The morphologies of QGs exhibit a higher sensitivity to rest-frame wavelength than SFGs. After analyzing the evolution of morphological indicators in the rest-frame V-band (0.5-0.7\\,$\\mu$m) and rest-frame J-band (1.1-1.4\\,$\\mu$m), we find that the morphologies of QGs evolve substantially with both redshift and stellar mass. For SFGs, the $C$, $Gini$ and $M_{\\rm 20}$ show a rapid evolution with stellar mass at log($M_*$/M$_\\odot$)$\\geq10.5$, while the $A_{\\rm O}$, $D_{\\rm O}$ and $A$ evolve with both redshift and stellar mass. Our comparison shows that TNG50 simulations effectively reproduce the morphological indicators we measured from {\\it JWST} observations when the impact of dust attenuation is considered.\n\nWe have carried out a deep survey of the M81 field in the 25-60 keV energy band based on long-term (2003-2023) INTEGRAL observations. A record sensitivity of 0.16 mCrab at a detection significance of 4 sigma has been achieved in the central part of the field owing to the long accumulated exposure (19.2 Ms). The total area of the survey is 1004 deg^2 at a sensitivity level better than 0.72 mCrab. We have produced a catalog of sources detected at a significance level higher than 4 sigma. It contains 51 objects most of which are active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The median redshift of the Seyfert galaxies in the catalog is z=0.0366. Six sources have not been detected previously in any of the X-ray surveys. According to the available indirect data, all of them and two more sources that have already been entered previously into the INTEGRAL survey catalogs can also be AGNs, including those with strong internal absorption.\n\nDuring the first Gyr of their life, exoplanet atmospheres suffer from different atmospheric escape phenomena that can strongly affect the shape and morphology of the exoplanet itself. These processes can be studied with Ly$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$ and/or He I triplet observations. We present high-resolution spectroscopy observations from CARMENES and GIARPS checking for He I and H$\\alpha$ signals in 20 exoplanetary atmospheres: V1298Tau c, K2-100b, HD63433b, HD63433c, HD73583b, HD73583c, K2-77b, TOI-2076b, TOI-2048b, HD235088b, TOI-1807b, TOI-1136d, TOI-1268b, TOI-1683b, TOI-2018b, MASCARA-2b, WASP-189b, TOI-2046b, TOI-1431b, and HAT-P-57b. We report two new high-resolution spectroscopy He I detections for TOI-1268b and TOI-2018b, and an H$\\alpha$ detection for TOI-1136d. The MOPYS (Measuring Out-flows in Planets orbiting Young Stars) project aims to understand the evaporating phenomena and test their predictions from the current observations. We compiled a list of 70 exoplanets with He I and/or H$\\alpha$ observations, from this work and the literature, and we considered the He I and H$\\alpha$ results as proxy for atmospheric escape. Our principal results are that 0.1-1Gyr-old planets do not exhibit more He I or H$\\alpha$ detections than older planets, and evaporation signals are more frequent for planets orbiting $\\sim$1-3Gyr-old stars. We provide new constrains to the cosmic shoreline, the empirical division between rocky planets and planets with atmosphere, by using the evaporation detections and explore the capabilities of a new dimensionless parameter, $R_{\\rm He}/R_{\\rm Hill}$, to explain the He I triplet detections. Furthermore, we present a statistically significant upper boundary for the He I triplet detections in the $T_{\\rm eq}$ vs $\\rho_{\\rm p}$ parameter space. Planets located above that boundary are unlikely to show He I absorption signals.\n\nStellar photospheric inhomogeneities are a significant source of noise which currently precludes the discovery of Earth-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars with the radial-velocity (RV) method. To complement several previous studies which have used ground- and spaced-based facilities to characterize the RV of the Sun, we here characterize the center-to-limb variability (CLV) of solar RVs arising from various solar-surface inhomogeneities observed by SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA. By using various SDO observables to classify pixels and calculate line-of-sight velocities as a function of pixel classification and limb angle, we show that each identified feature type, including the umbrae and penumbrae of sunspots, quiet-Sun magnetoconvective cells, magnetic network, and plage, exhibit distinct and complex CLV signatures, including a notable limb-angle dependence in the observed suppression of convective blueshift for magnetically active regions. We discuss the observed distributions of velocities by identified region type and limb angle, offer interpretations of the physical phenomena that shape these distributions, and emphasize the need to understand the RV signatures of these regions as astrophysical signals, rather than simple (un)correlated noise processes.\n\nWe describe a general expansion of spherical (full-sky) bispectra into a set of orthogonal modes. For squeezed shapes, the basis separates physically-distinct signals and is dominated by the lowest moments. In terms of reduced bispectra, we identify a set of discrete polynomials that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the relevant Wigner 3j symbol, and reduce to Chebyshev polynomials in the flat-sky (high-momentum) limit for both parity-even and parity-odd cases. For squeezed shapes, the flat-sky limit is equivalent to previous moment expansions used for CMB bispectra and quadratic estimators, but in general reduces to a distinct expansion in the angular dependence of triangles at fixed total side length (momentum). We use the full-sky expansion to construct a tower of orthogonal CMB lensing quadratic estimators and construct estimators that are immune to foregrounds like point sources or noise inhomogeneities. In parity-even combinations (such as the lensing gradient mode from $TT$, or the lensing curl mode from $EB$) the leading two modes can be identified with information from the magnification and shear respectively, whereas the parity-odd combinations are shear-only. Although not directly separable, we show that these estimators can nonetheless be evaluated numerically sufficiently easily.\n\nThe early dark energy (EDE) extension to $\\Lambda$CDM has been proposed as a candidate scenario to resolve the \"Hubble tension\". We present new constraints on the EDE model by incorporating new data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) survey and CMB lensing measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 and \\textit{Planck} NPIPE data. We do not find evidence for EDE. The maximum fractional contribution of EDE to the total energy density is $f_\\mathrm{EDE}< 0.091 \\; (95\\% \\; \\mathrm{CL} )$ from our baseline combination of \\textit{Planck} CMB, CMB lensing, and DESI BAO. Our strongest constraints on EDE come from the combination of \\textit{Planck} CMB and CMB lensing alone, yielding $f_\\mathrm{EDE}< 0.070 \\; (95\\% \\; \\mathrm{CL} )$. We also explore extensions of $\\Lambda$CDM beyond the EDE parameters by treating the total neutrino mass as a free parameter, finding $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.096 \\,\\, {\\rm eV} \\; (95\\% \\; \\mathrm{CL} )$ and $f_\\mathrm{EDE}< 0.087 \\; (95\\% \\; \\mathrm{CL} )$. For the first time in EDE analyses, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation using neural network emulators of cosmological observables, which are on the order of a hundred times faster than full Boltzmann solutions.\n\nWe present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of HST/WFC3/G141 spectroscopic phase curve observations of two brown dwarfs, WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B, in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarf hosts. These systems are analogous to hot and ultra-hot Jupiter systems, enabling a unique and high-precision comparison to exoplanet systems. We use the PETRA retrieval suite to test various analysis setups, including joint-phase retrievals, multiple temperature structures, and non-uniform abundances. We find that WD-0137B has a dayside that closely resembles that of other ultra-hot Jupiters with inverted temperature structures and H$^-$ opacity, but quickly transitions to a mostly non-inverted temperature structure on the nightside. Meanwhile, EPIC-2122B's atmosphere remains inverted at all constrained longitudes, with dominant H$^-$ opacity. Retrievals with multiple temperature profiles and non-uniform vertical abundances were generally not statistically justified for this dataset, but retrievals with dayside-dilution factors were found to be justified. Retrieving all phases simultaneously with a linear combination of a dayside and nightside atmosphere was found to be an adequate representation of the entire phase-curve once a longitudinal temperature gradient free parameter was included in the retrieval. Comparing to global circulation models, we attribute behavior in the 1D retrievals to the inclined viewing geometry of the systems, which results in always-visible irradiated and inverted portions of the atmosphere \"contaminating\" spectra measured from the nightside hemisphere. This study sheds light on the similarities between these irradiated brown dwarf systems and hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, but also their unique differences, including the influence of the inclined viewing geometry.\n\nModels of stepped dark radiation have recently been found to have an important impact on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, aiding in easing the Hubble tension. In this work, we study models with a sector of dark radiation with a step in its abundance, which thermalizes after big bang nucleosynthesis by mixing with the standard model neutrinos. For this, we extend an earlier work which has focused on the background evolution only until the dark sector thermalizes by deriving the full background and perturbation equations of the model and implementing them in an Einstein-Boltzmann solving code. We expound on the behavior of this model, discussing the wide range of parameters that result in interesting and viable cosmologies that dynamically generate dark radiation during a range of epochs. We find that for the strongly self-coupled regime, there is no large cosmological impact for a tight prior on the mass, whereas larger mass ranges allow a smooth interpolation between a behavior close to the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological standard model and close to an additional component of strongly self-interacting dark radiation. In the weakly self-coupled regime we find that we can accommodate a parameter space relevant for the neutrino anomalies as well as one relevant to easing the Hubble tension.\n\nObservations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\\rm Edd}$, for {\\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\\gg L_{\\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v >0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc. I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.\n\nWe investigate a novel reheating scenario proceeding through $s$-channel inflaton annihilation, mediated by a massive scalar. If the inflaton $\\phi$ oscillates around the minimum of a monomial potential $\\propto \\phi^{n}$, we reveal the emergence of resonance phenomena originating from the dynamic evolution of the inflaton mass for $n>2$. Consequently, a resonance appears in both the radiation and the temperature evolution during the reheating process. By solving the coupled Boltzmann equations, we present solutions for radiation and temperature. We find non-trivial temperature characteristics during reheating, depending on the value of $n$ and the masses of the inflaton and mediator. Some phenomenological aspects of the model are explored. As a concrete example, we show that the same mediator participates in the genesis of dark matter, modifying the standard freeze-in dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that the resonant reheating scenario could be tested by next-generation low- and high-frequency gravitational wave detectors.\n\nWe demonstrate that long-ranged terrestrial electric fields can be used to exclude or discover ultralight bosonic particles with extremely small charge, beyond that probed by astrophysics. Bound condensates of scalar millicharged particles can be rapidly produced near electrostatic generators or in the atmosphere. If such particles directly couple to the photon, they quickly short out such electrical activity. Instead, for interactions mediated by a kinetically-mixed dark photon, the effects of this condensate are suppressed depending on the size of the kinetic mixing, but may still be directly detected with precision electromagnetic sensors. Analogous condensates can also develop in other theories involving new long-ranged forces, such as those coupled to baryon and lepton number.\n\nNext-generation gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), are expected to observe a few 100,000 signals each year. This will require efficient analysis tools and computational resources well beyond the needs of current detectors. Such resources are not presently available to the science community. Therefore, to investigate ET observational capabilities and science cases, Fisher-matrix methods are used to predict how precisely parameters like mass, spin, source distance or sky location can be estimated from ET data. The approach is based on a Gaussian approximation of the likelihood function. However, the reliability of error estimates obtained from Fisher-matrix methods remains an open question. In this article, we present a Fisher-matrix analysis of signals of the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC). We compare parameter-estimation errors obtained using the Fisher matrix code GWFish with the errors from the marginal distributions of the Virgo/LIGO posterior analysis. In order to understand the impact of prior distributions on the results, we implemented a Gaussian likelihood sampling algorithm with priors in GWFish. To ensure a fair comparison of the methods, the GWFish analyses presented in this article use the same priors and the same instrument-noise spectra as the Virgo/LIGO posterior analyses. Our findings imply that Fisher-matrix methods, especially if augmented with the use of priors, are a valid tool for ET science-case studies.\n\nGravitational waves from condensates of ultra-light particles, such as axion, around rotating black holes are a promising probe to search for unknown physics. For this purpose, we need to characterize the signal to detect the gravitational waves, which requires tracking the evolution of the condensates, including various effects. The axion self-interaction causes the non-linear coupling between the superradiant modes, resulting in complicated branching of evolution. Most studies so far have considered evolution under the non-relativistic approximation or the two-mode approximation. In this paper, we numerically investigate the evolution of the axion condensate without these approximations, taking higher multipole modes into account. We also investigate the possible signature in gravitational waves from the condensate. We show that the higher multipole modes are excited, leading to the gravitational wave signal by the transition of the axion between different levels. The most prominent signal of gravitational waves arises from the transition between modes with their angular quantum numbers different by two. The gravitational wave signal is emitted in the deci-Hz band for stellar mass black holes, which might be observable with the future gravitational wave detectors.\n\nWe present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.\n\nGrains of ice are formed spontaneously when water vapor is injected into a weakly-ionized laboratory plasma in which the background gas has been cooled to cryogenic temperatures comparable to those of deep space. These ice grains are levitated indefinitely within the plasma so that their time evolution can be observed under free-floating conditions. Using microscope imaging, ice grains are shown to have a spindle-like fractal structure and grow over time. Both crystalline and amorphous phases of ice are observed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A mix of crystalline and amorphous grains coexist under certain thermal conditions and a linear mixing model is used on the ice absorption band surrounding 3.2 microns to examine the ice phase composition and its temporal stability. The extinction spectrum is also affected by inelastic scattering as grains grow, and characteristic grain radii are obtained from Mie scattering theory and compared to size measurements from direct imaging. Observations are used to compare possible ice nucleation mechanisms, and it is concluded that nucleation is likely catalyzed by ions, as ice does not nucleate in absence of plasma and impurities are not detected. Ice grain properties and infrared extinction spectra show similarity to observations of some astrophysical ices observed in protoplanetary disks, implying that the fractal morphology of the ice and observed processes of homogeneous ice nucleation could occur as well in such astrophysical environments with weakly-ionized conditions.\n\nApparent horizon plays an important role in numerical relativity as it provides a tool to characterize the existence and properties of black holes on three-dimensional spatial slices in 3+1 numerical spacetimes. Apparent horizon finders based on different techniques have been developed. In this paper, we revisit the apparent horizon finding problem in numerical relativity using multigrid-based algorithms. We formulate the nonlinear elliptic apparent horizon equation as a linear Poisson-type equation with a nonlinear source, and solve it using a multigrid algorithm with Gauss-Seidel line relaxation. A fourth order compact finite difference scheme in spherical coordinates is derived and employed to reduce the complexity of the line relaxation operator to a tri-diagonal matrix inversion. The multigrid-based apparent horizon finder developed in this work is capable of locating apparent horizons in generic spatial hypersurfaces without any symmetries. The finder is tested with both analytic data, such as Brill-Lindquist multiple black hole data, and numerical data, including off-centered Kerr-Schild data and dynamical inspiraling binary black hole data. The obtained results are compared with those generated by the current fastest finder AHFinderDirect (Thornburg, Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 743, 2003), which is the default finder in the open source code Einstein Toolkit. Our finder performs comparatively in terms of accuracy, and starts to outperform AHFinderDirect at high angular resolutions (\\sim 1^\\circ) in terms of speed. Our finder is also more flexible to initial guess, as opposed to the Newton's method used in AHFinderDirect. This suggests that the multigrid algorithm provides an alternative option for studying apparent horizons, especially when high resolutions are needed.\n\nA new efficient approach for searching three-body periodic equal-mass collisionless orbits passing through Eulerian configuration is presented. The approach is based on a symmetry property of the solutions at the half period. Depending on two previously established symmetry types on the shape sphere, each solution is presented by one or two distinct initial conditions (one or two points in the search domain). A numerical search based on Newton's method on a relatively coarse search grid for solutions with relatively small scale-invariant periods $T^{*}<70$ is conducted. The linear systems at each Newton's iteration are computed by high order high precision Taylor series method. The search produced 12,431 initial conditions (i.c.s) corresponding to 6,333 distinct solutions. In addition to passing through the Eulerian configuration, 35 of the solutions are also free-fall ones. Although most of the found solutions are new, all linearly stable solutions among them (only 7) are old ones. Particular attention is paid to the details of the high precision computations and the analysis of accuracy. All i.c.s are given with 100 correct digits.\n\nRecent surveys have been reporting bulk peculiar flows considerably faster than expected. Bulk flows are moving matter and matter in motion implies nonzero energy flux. In relativity, as opposed to Newtonian physics, matter fluxes gravitate as well, since they also contribute to the energy-momentum tensor. The gravitational input of the \"peculiar\" flux survives at the linear level and it can drastically change our understanding of the way bulk flows have evolved in time. By default, the Newtonian analysis of peculiar motions bypasses the relativistic flux-contribution to the gravitational field. The problem is that there are also studies, with an otherwise relativistic profile, which inadvertently do the same. As result, these treatments reduce to Newtonian and they misleadingly reproduce the slow Newtonian growth-rate of linear peculiar velocities. In contrast, by accounting for the flux effects, the proper relativistic analysis arrives at a considerably stronger growth. We show that it is the flux input of the moving matter to gravity that separates the relativistic studies of peculiar motions from the rest and, in so doing, it could provide an answer to the bulk-flow question.\n\nThis paper develops structure-preserving, oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) schemes for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), as a sequel to our recent work [Peng, Sun, and Wu, OEDG: Oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin method for hyperbolic conservation laws, 2023]. The schemes are based on a locally divergence-free (LDF) oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure to suppress spurious oscillations while maintaining many of the good properties of original DG schemes, such as conservation, local compactness, and optimal convergence rates. The OE procedure is built on the solution operator of a novel damping equation -- a simple linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose exact solution can be exactly formulated. Because this OE procedure does not interfere with DG spatial discretization and RK stage update, it can be easily incorporated to existing DG codes as an independent module. These features make the proposed LDF OEDG schemes highly efficient and easy to implement.In addition, we present a positivity-preserving (PP) analysis of the LDF OEDG schemes on Cartesian meshes via the optimal convex decomposition technique and the geometric quasi-linearization (GQL) approach. Efficient PP LDF OEDG schemes are obtained with the HLL flux under a condition accessible by the simple local scaling PP limiter.Several one- and two-dimensional MHD tests confirm the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed structure-preserving OEDG schemes.\n\nWe compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance."
