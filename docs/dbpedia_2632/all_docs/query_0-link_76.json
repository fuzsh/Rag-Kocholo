        "text": "ULTIMA THULE / THE CRACK IN THE COSMIC EGG\n\nAbacus\n\nOriginally a 60's pop group known as Fashion, Abacus started their career as support to many British progressive bands touring Germany. Influenced by such music, and with the addition of English vocalist Chris Williams, they became Abacus in 1971. We've never encountered their debut LP (which is reputedly very good), but later on they still had a borderline pop sound - hints of Bonzo's and The Move in a bluesy rock with a 60's beat feel, and some psychedelic touches - occasionally mad or eccentric. Rarely would you know that Abacus were German, and in fact another English musician later took over the drum stool on their final (but still patchy) album MIDWAY. At their best, Abacus could surprise and be really creative, yet they were generally too unfocused and schizophrenic.\n\nHans-Rolf Schade (guitar, percussion, sitar, vocals), Felix Hans (drums, percussion, vocals), Chris Williams (vocals, guitar), Klaus Kohlhase (bass, percussion, harmonica), Christoph Barutzky (piano, organ)\n\nABACUS (8/71)\n\nLP Polydor 2371 215 (1971)\n\nSeasong / Love You Till The Cows Come Home\n\n7\" Polydor 2041 266 (1972)\n\nJUST A DAY'S JOURNEY AWAY (2-3/72)\n\nLP Polydor 2371 270 (1972)\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED (6/72)\n\nLP Zebra 2949 002 (1972)\n\nFly With Us / The Big Moody\n\n7\" Zebra 2047 006 (1973)\n\nMIDWAY (8/73)\n\nLP Zebra 2949 013 (1974)\n\nIndian Dancer / Be That Way\n\n7\" Bellaphon BF 18256 (1974)\n\nAchtzehn Karat Gold\n\nAn early supergroup borne out of the prolific Munich scene fronted by American-German Klaus Ebert. The idea behind 18 Karat Gold seems to have been to present Krautrock in a commercial dilute form to the pop public, but not surprisingly, the idea didn't work on any level, and the band barely lasted a year. Much of the time Achtzehn Karat Gold made their living by working as pop singer Peter Maffay's backing band. Their sole album contained a few minor surprises, but considering the calibre of the musicians, it is generally a disappointing and rather average record, hinting at the direction Amon Düül II were to take in the late-70's.\n\nJörg Evers (guitar), Keith Forsey (drums), Klaus Ebert (guitar), Lothar Meid (bass)\n\nALL BUMM (6/73)\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29559 (1974)\n\nAera\n\nAera come from the great tradition of Bavarian jazz-rock oriented progressive bands like Embryo, Missus Beastly, Munju, Moira, etc., with a style unique to that area, originating as a highly inventive fusion band, with strong percussion, driving rhythms and lots of space for solos from guitar, sax and flute. Whilst lead by Muck Groh they recorded two albums: HUMANUM EST which presented a most proficient instrumental band with a strong identity, with multi-tracked guitar riffing and near on ever-present wind solos, and then HAND UND FUSS, which was a touch more varied, due to the addition of violin and with Lucky Schmidt dealing more forceful rhythms in a jazzier concoction. As happens with most bands, Aera lost many members to other groups, and the third album TÜRKIS, saw a big change in personnel, with wheelchair-bound Klaus Kreuzeder taking over as leader. Fronting a more symphonic band featuring lots of keyboards and also multi-percussives from almost everyone involved, a new Aera sound was forged. Interestingly, being touted as a German Brand X or Turning Point, there were rumours of a UK tour, and an LP release on the Gull label was announced, but unfortunately this came to nothing, no doubt due to changes happening in the band. The LIVE album, recorded with (ex-Embryo regular) Roman Bunka, was an odd follow-up indeed. Roman's songs didn't really hit-off with the Aera style, especially with a funky focus to the music. And then, TOO MUCH lost the magic even further. But, all was not lost, finally, they got their act back together with AKATAKI, which saw another change in style, partly a step back to the energy of HAND UND FUSS, though the high-tech setting of Achim Gieseler's computer keyboards against a heavy jazz-fusion base led to unusual and often startling results. Whilst being Aera at their jazziest, it's also their most experimental and shows a band still striving for the ideals set a decade before.\n\nWolfgang Teske (drums), Klaus Kreuzeder (sax, flute), Dieter Bauer (bass), Muck Groh (guitar), + Peter Malinowski (bass), Jonas Porst (keyboards)\n\nHUMANUM EST (8-10/11/74)\n\nLP Erlkönig ERL 2001 (1975)\n\nHAND UND FUSS (14-18/9/76)\n\nLP Erlkönig ERL 2002 (1976)\n\nfeatured on: LIVE NÜRNBERGER SZENE 1976\n\nfeatured on: POP NACHWUCHS-FESTIVAL '78\n\nfeatured on: UMSONST UND DRAUSSEN PORTA WESTVLOTHICA 1978\n\nTÜRKIS (1-2/79)\n\nLP Erlkönig INT 148.409 (1979)\n\nLIVE (11/79)\n\nLP Erlkönig INT 148.415 (1980)\n\nTOO MUCH (2/81)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 145.625 (1981)\n\nAKATAKI (11/81)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 145.633 (1982)\n\nAg A.M.\n\nThe full name of Ag A.M. is Arbeitsgemeinschaft Ante Meridiem, (which means something totally weird like \"The Anti-Meridian Study Group\"). They were a varied kind of folky politico band with a very German sound, and a music that drew in an extremely wide range of styles, ranging from theatrical Floh De Cologne territory, via trippy psychedelia, all sorts of progressive rock styles, and on to country rock even! Oddball stuff indeed, certainly their music was an acquired taste and original too.Nothing historical whatsoever is known about Ag A.M., no, not even the musicians full names! All that they left behind is an odd album that is full of surprises, yet doesn't really fit into any genre comfortably. It's a curiosity, and aptly it's one of the most obscure of 70's self produced obscurities.\n\nP. Deltlaff (vocals, guitar), G. Westenberger (vocals, guitar, accordion), B.

Müller (clarinet, flute, organ)\n\nERINNERUNGEN AN EINE POSITIVE PHASE (5-6/77)\n\nLP private release 1377 (1977)\n\nAgitation Free\n\nOne of the most legendary, formative and seminal Berlin bands of the 60's, whose early incarnations featured the likes of Christoph Franke (drums) who went on to Tangerine Dream, Ax Genrich (guitar) who after three months was nabbed by Guru Guru, and John L. \"the mad-man of Berlin\" a notorious eccentric who also played with Ash Ra Tempel. The full history is quite complex. Although in the spirit of Ash Ra Tempel and Pink Floyd, they had their own individual identity, with a largely improvised music that was predominantly instrumental, featuring lots of electronics, keyboards and dual guitars, and a great flair for invention. MALESCH documents their trip to North Africa and the Middle East, blending location recordings together with their own compositions and improvisations, and is still quite a unique experience even today, combining cosmic, avant-garde and ethnic musics with great invention. Much more a proper studio album, and also more typical of the patent Agitation Free sound, 2ND took them more towards the realms of progressive rock, whilst also stretching out the cosmic elements even more. It contains what was their only \"song\" documented on LP, the powerful Mellotron driven \"Haunted Island\" based on Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dreamtime\".\n\nIt's unfortunate really that Agitation Free only really gained success in France, being barely noticed in their homeland, and totally ignored by the British media. Still, two studio albums were not the end of Agitation Free, and they kept on recording right up to their final session. The album LAST was posthumously released (only in France), it contains recordings from two concerts and is certainly the best document of the improvisational capabilities of this most innovative group of Teutonic pioneers, developing the Agitation Free sound beyond the guitar based music of Ash Ra Tempel onto purely cosmic floating realms. The more recently released FRAGMENTS was recorded at the final Agitation Free sessions, where they attempted to recapture the early free-form jamming psychedelic sound, and is also notable for featuring original members Chris Franke and Micky Duwe. Many more musicians passed through Agitation Free's ranks than are mentioned here, including members of Os Mundi and Metropolis. Synthesist Michael Hoenig went on to work with Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream, and later established himself as a successful soloist. Rhythm guitarist Lutz Ulbrich went on to Ashra, and also has recorded some new-wave styled pop albums under the guise of Lüül.\n\nLutz Ulbrich (guitars, zither, organ), Jörg Schwenke (guitar), Burghard Rausch (drums, marimba, vocals), Michael Hoenig (synthesizer, electronics, steel guitar), Michael Günther (bass, tapes)\n\nMALESCH (6/72)\n\nLP Vertigo 6360 607 (1972) «gatefold cover»\n\n2ND (7/73)\n\nLP Vertigo 6360 615 (1973) «gatefold cover»\n\nLAST (3/73+2/74)\n\nLP Barclay 80.162 (France, 1976)\n\nAinigma\n\nAn obscure early band that gained recognition as one of the darkest of heavy German progressives. Little is known about Ainigma, except that they existed for some time before making their sole album DILUVIUM, and the truth is that Ainigma were actually quite typical of the more mainstream Krautrock of the era. Ainigma played a raw and slightly messy kind of hard-edged bluesy rock, sometimes recalling Frumpy, but with a more psychedelic underlying Vanilla Fudge type sound. Lyrically though Ainigma weren't too hot, and it would have been better if they had sung in German, as the lyrics do come across as somewhat naïve. Featuring chunky organ and guitar, the instrumental feel and production style (or lack of production) draws comparisons with Necronomicon, with a similar stoned feel, featuring long tracks, extensive instrumentals, and a really gloomy atmosphere.\n\nWilli Klüter (organ, vocals), Wolfgang Netzer (guitar, bass, choir), Michael Klüter (drums), + Michael Freise (acoustic guitar)\n\nDILUVIUM (4-5/73)\n\nLP Arc ALPS 151715 (1973) «pirate issues also exist»\n\nAk Musick\n\nAs far as we recall (having only heard their album once several years back), these were some sort of radical experimental rock outfit.

Nothing at all is known of their history. But, what an album they left behind! With that unmistakable Faustian Kurt Graupner recording sound, their music featured fuzzed guitars and effects overdose in a heavy and bluesy over-the-top Krautrock akin to Frumpy and Nosferatu. Rüdiger Berghahn sounds like a male Inga Rumpf by the way! Though barely known, Alcatraz were remarkable in that they bridged and mixed together genres that no one else did. In fact, they pulled out all the stops to come up with one of the finest slabs of eccentric heady Krautrock. It's a masterpiece beyond doubt, right down to the deranged guitar blitz finale \"Piss Off!\"\n\nRüdiger Berghahn (pianett, vocals), Klaus Holst (guitar), Klaus Nagurski (flute, tenor sax), Ronald Wilson (bass), Jan Rieck (drums, bongos)\n\nVAMPIRE STATE BUILDING (9-11/10/71)\n\nLP Philips 6305 128 (1972)\n\nENERGIE PROGRAMM IN ROCK\n\nLP private release AL 19377 (1978)\n\nTROCKENEIS ZUM FRÜHSTÜCK (1981)\n\nLP private release LMP 002 (1987)\n\nNO. 4 (12-13/9/82)\n\nLP private release ?

They were never really a proper band, as Alto (check the LP covers) was really more of an ego trip for Johannes Pappert, showing off his talent as a multi-instrumentalist, and featuring a hoard of top musicians and Kraan friends as guests. Typical of many such late-70's productions, despite all the talent involved, the results were nothing special, just a lighter more varied twist on the Kraan of the era. Better than most such projects, but very dilute all the same.\n\nJohannes Pappert (saxes, percussion, 12-string guitar), + Andy Göldner (vocals, guitar), Lou Marignan (bass), Bernd Kiefer (bass), Micky Stickdorn (drums), Hellmut Hattler (bass), Zabba Lindner (drums, percussion), Ellen Meier (vocals), Peter Wolbrandt (guitars, banjo, vocals), Wolfgang Grasekamp (keyboards), Jan Fride (percussion, drums)\n\nALTO (11/77)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 160.609 (1978)\n\nHAPPY AMBROSIA (1979)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 145.608 (1980)\n\nAltona\n\nWith their roots as ex-Thrice Mice members, Altona wisely chose this new name (Altona is a town on the edge of Hamburg) when dropping the former band's classical edge in preference for a jazzier front. On their debut Altona played a lively fusion that crossed many boundaries, but kept the Blodwyn Pig feel that dominated the early Thrice Mice recordings. Notably, they sounded almost like a hybrid of Birth Control and Creative Rock, occasionally hinting at Eiliff, with songs and instrumentals that were full of surprises! In contrast, their second album CHICKENFARM, disappointed as it saw a mellowing of style, to funky edged jazz-rock with blues and soul tendencies, and an indistinctive Anglo-American type brassy-rock sound. A few Altona members later reappeared in the obscure band Dirty Dogs.\n\nFritz Kahl (bass), Karl-Heinz Blumenberg (vocals, bass/soprano saxes, bass), Klaus Gerlach (guitar), Wolfgang Wulff (tenor sax), Karl-Heinz Gossler (drums), Werner von Gosen (guitar), Michael von Rönn (tenor sax)\n\nALTONA (1974)\n\nLP RCA PPL1-1049 (1975)\n\nCHICKENFARM (1974)\n\nLP RCA PPL1-4129 (1975)\n\nAmon Düül\n\nThe original Munich commune group, formed in 1967, Amon Düül were not your normal outfit of political activists or hippies, they were much more than that. Living together, they were constantly attempting to create or explore new genres in music. Psychedelic drugs, free-love, and a shared community were all factors, as was the new psychedelic music from Britain and the USA, especially so Hapshash & The Coloured Coat. Inevitably, due to political and musical differences, tempers got frayed and just before a legendary concert they split into two separate bands. Founder members, including Chris Karrer and others, went on to front the internationally successful Amon Düül II.\n\nIn sharp contrast, the original Amon Düül (who were more concerned with being politically active) recorded on very few occasions. A great part of their work was all recorded during the very same early sessions in 1969 within a matter of days. Typical of commune bands, Amon Düül were often quite wild and free-form. They played a high-energy bare-bones aggressive rock that was totally over-the-top in the percussion department, with raw grating guitars and wailing vocals. Their debut AMON DÜÜL (originally untitled, but generally referred to as \"PSYCHEDELIC UNDERGROUND\") and its follow-up COLLAPSING: SINGVÖGEL RÜCKWÄRTS & CO., both also displayed an eccentric use of studio effects, sound manipulation and sonic gags (like jumps, stuck-grooves, scratches, etc.), which gained them a curious notoriety. A total of four albums (two of them double LP's) were eventually released from those early sessions, and all are essential listening for fans of aggressive 60's rock.\n\nThe later incarnation (which grew out of an association with the \"Berlin Commune 1\") were different, and only recorded one album and a single. Still a touch hippy-political in concept the album PARA DIESWÄRTS DÜÜL was a more relaxed, albeit unusual, folky rock with the accent on multiple guitars, featuring lengthy improvised instrumental sections, closer to Quintessence or Popol Vuh, yet still quite unique. Members of this version of the band also guested on the similarly styled \"Sandoz In The Rain\" on Amon Düül II's YETI. The actual history of this incarnation of Amon Düül is virtually undocumented, though we do know that Karl-Heinz Hausmann of the \"Berlin Commune 1\" passed through and followed Peter Leopold to Amon Düül II. They also played live quite extensively when based in Berlin, and even Klaus Schulze is reputed to have played in concert with them!\n\nRayner Bauer (guitar, vocals), Ulrich Leopold (basses), Helge Filanda (congas, vocals), Peter \"Krischke\" Leopold (drums, piano), Ella Bauer (drums, vocals), Angelika Filanda (drums, vocals), Uschi Obermaier (maracas)\n\nAMON DÜÜL \"PSYCHEDELIC UNDERGROUND\" (1969)\n\nLP Metronome MLP 15.332 (1969)\n\nCOLLAPSING: SINGVÖGEL RÜCKWÄRTS & CO.

As the story goes, Amon Düül (the original band/commune) were booked to play at the Essener Songtag Festival, but due to differences the commune split into two and both versions of the band played. The split was instigated by Chris Karrer, who was much more interested in making music than getting into politics. In their early days a number of other Amon Düül members migrated to Amon Düül II, as well as the likes of Christian Burchard and Edgar Hofmann (who both went on to form Embryo), Holger Trülzsch (of Popol Vuh), Dieter Serfas (who formed his own band, then later resurfaced in Embryo) and...\n\nTheir debut album PHALLUS DEI contained a charged and purely innovative music, with bizarre structures, almost operatic and crazed (male and female) vocals, with lots of distinctly Teutonic angst, tons of percussion, duelling violins, Eastern-scale guitars, and all really tripped-out to the point of excess. This was especially so on the side-long title track, which featured improvisation of such complexity that even the likes of Pink Floyd only hinted at. Like a hybrid of High Tide, Hawkwind and Third Ear Band, the connection may have been coincidental, yet bassist Dave Anderson did later return to England and join Hawkwind! The following two albums, both doubles, are regarded by many as the finest Amon Düül II music, extensively featuring lengthy tracks and side-long segued suites, full of musical invention, surprises throughout. Not least is the phenomenal 11/2 sides of \"Yeti\" and \"Yeti Talks To Yogi\", which are space rock of the utmost invention, and the curious cosmic space-out \"The Chasmin Soundtrack\" (on TANZ DER LEMMINGE) which pre-empted The Cosmic Jokers. There's lots of other classic material on these doubles (naturally!) and not least the second side of YETI which has some of the most mind-bending psychedelic music on record. And, let's not forget the weirdly twisted songs that were as surreal as the music they were contained in! As with any big band, personnel changes were a regular feature of Amon Düül II, amongst them: Shrat had gone to form the Hawkwind-like Sameti, Karl-Heinz Hausmann had joined from the \"Berlin Commune 1\", and a wealth of other top Munich jazz and rock musicians passed through the band. This variety of talent from the likes of Jimmy Jackson (and his amazing choir organ) or eccentric singer Rolf Zacher, and numerous others, makes the Amon Düül II canvas of sound even more diverse.\n\nCARNIVAL IN BABYLON was a single LP with shorter song-based tracks. A disappointment to most at first, , it's still a fine and well-crafted album, though of the more subtle kind. But, hereon, with the onset of international recognition and tours abroad, Amon Düül II became an even much more unstable entity, with a steady flow of musicians passing through the band (amongst the more obscure were Reinhold Spiegelfeld and Reiner Schnelle of Weed). As evidence of this, on WOLF CITY (and its sister alter-ego album by Utopia which took the Amon Düül II sound to jazzier realms), no two tracks featured the same musicians, yet despite this WOLF CITY was a surprisingly varied, fresh and highly inventive album extensively featuring Daniel Fichelscher, the percussionist/multi-instrumentalist who was to become the main musician of Popol Vuh, and much more Renate Knaup. As a \"thank you\" to their British fans, the excellent LIVE IN LONDON (actually recorded in Croydon) was released here at budget price. It featured radically different versions of classic tracks, mostly from DANCE OF THE LEMMINGS, again with Renate more to the fore. The last true (and really creative) Amon Düül II album is often quoted as VIVE LA TRANCE, which continued this trend of musical simplification. Although being an album of songs VIVE LA TRANCE still had lots in the way of radical invention, not least some really witty songs and pacey complex instrumentals. After Amon Düül II left United Artists, the label issued the singles collection LEMMINGMANIA (United Artists UAG 29723).\n\nWhen the acid-haze faded, further Amon Düül II albums moved to ever more accessible mainstream rock realms, becoming increasingly patchy. HIJACK lived up to its title, and \"hijacked\" from various different types of music, tango's and Bavarian folk music amongst them. It was a more trendy side-step from the songs on VIVE LA TRANCE. Then, even more wide ranging, was the double opus MADE IN GERMANY, lyrically Amon Düül II's ultimate stab at German society, attitudes, the media, the record industry, etc. The great shame was that musically much of it wasn't too inspired. Even before the departure of Renate Knaup (she moved on to Popol Vuh) there had been hoards of changes in personnel. And, now again, it was all-change time!\n\nAs Lothar Meid left, in came a number of new members: Jörg Evers, Keith Forsey and Klaus Ebert, all ex-members of an earlier Lothar Meid band Achtzehn Karat Gold. And then there was also pop singer Stefan Zauner! Not surprisingly, all of this tore the Amon Düül II sound apart, losing their identity entirely. Yet it must be said that all later 70's Amon Düül II albums contained at least something of excellence. Even after proverbially disappearing up their own arses on ONLY HUMAN, there's been constant attempts to resurrect Amon Düül II. VORTEX sounded like a MOR return to VIVE LA TRANCE, and more recent attempts have been even more embarrassing, a couple of almost disco-styled new numbers appeared on the compilation SURROUNDED BY THE BARS (Spalax 14810).\n\nNote: John Weinzierl also established a British incarnation of Amon Düül in 1979 along with former Amon Düül II member (also of Hawkwind and Groundhogs) Dave Anderson and a collection of impromptu musicians. Their releases confused at first, being billed as \"old recordings\" when they were no such thing. Of their four releases, the largely improvised albums HAWK MEETS PENGUIN (Thunderbolt TB 102) and FOOL MOON (Magnum TL 011) are highly recommended to all fans of the early Amon Düül II. A compilation AIRS ON A SHOESTRING (Thunderbolt TB 043), also features an excellent unreleased work.\n\nDieter Serfas (drums, cymbals), Peter Leopold (drums, percussion, piano), Shrat (bongos, vocals, violin), Renate Knaup (vocals, tambourine), John Weinzierl (guitar, bass), Chris Karrer (violin, guitars, soprano sax, vocals), Falk Rogner (organ, synthesizer), Dave Anderson (bass), + Christian Burchard (vibes), Holger Trülzsch (Turkish drums)\n\nPHALLUS DEI\n\nLP Liberty LBS 83279 (1969) «gatefold sleeve»\n\nYETI\n\n2LP Liberty LBS 83359/60 (1970), Liberty LSP 101 (UK, 1970)\n\nRattlesnakeplumcake / Between The Eyes\n\n7\" Liberty 15417 (1970)\n\nTANZ DER LEMMINGE\n\n2LP Liberty LBS 83473/74 (1971)\n\nLight / Lemmingmania\n\n7\" Liberty 15458 (1971)\n\nCARNIVAL IN BABYLON\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29327 (1972)\n\nWOLF CITY (7/72)\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29406 (1972)\n\nLIVE IN LONDON (16/12/72)\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29466 (1973), United Artists USP 102 (UK)\n\nVIVE LA TRANCE\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29504 (1973)\n\nHIJACK\n\nLP Nova 6.22056 (1974), Atlantic K 50136 (UK, 1975)\n\nMADE IN GERMANY\n\n2LP Nova 6.28350 (1975)\n\nPYRAGONY X\n\nLP Nova 6.22890 (1976)\n\nALMOST ALIVE\n\nLP Nova 6.23305 (1977)\n\nONLY HUMAN\n\nLP Strand 6.23561 (1978)\n\nVORTEX\n\nLP Telefunken 6.24874 (1981)\n\nAmos Key\n\nA little-known band, of whom we know nothing historically, Amos Key were one of the few early German bands to play a fiery classical rock with such creativity and invention, and even parallel the excellence of the Italians! Much more so than fellow organ-rock pioneers Sixty Nine, Amos Key owed great debts to Bach, Beethoven and Schumann, adding a heavy Krautrock twist to a music more closely resembling Egg or The Nice, full of angst and weird psychedelic and space-rock touches. They apparently also released a single, but we've no idea whether the tracks are taken from the LP.\n\nThomas Molin (keyboards, vocals), Andreas Gross (bass, guitar, vocals), Lutz Ludwig (drums)\n\nFIRST KEY\n\nLP Spiegelei 26.413-5U (1973)\n\nAnalogy\n\nThe Italian's may claim Analogy as a classic band from their 70's scene, though the truth is that they were actually German! Their debut LP (which became quite notorious because of the nude group scenes on the cover) was recorded and only released in Italy, which would be the reason for such confusion. Analogy were of that genre some suggest as being inspired by US West Coast bands, though really they were very European, combining classical and space-rock elements, and fronted by a powerful unusual female vocalist. If they could be compared to anyone, Earth & Fire and Sandrose would be favourites, not forgetting to point out an added Floydian spaciness, with lots of organ and guitars. Despite being an oddly balanced album, its reputation is certainly deserved.\n\nAfter this various different incarnations of the band, under various names, existed. Whilst known as Earthbound (reputedly a new-wave band) they completed an ambition of Martin Thurin's, in the form of a lengthy symphonic opus.

On their LP, however, they were hardly a proper band, but merely a duo aided by guests. They only made the one album (and also a single culled from it) which is very varied, at its lightest resembling late-60's The Beatles, though mostly it's heavy and psychedelic rock. As it's often fronted by chunky organ, with blues and classical elements, hints of Brian Auger or The Nice are notable. Note: The album forgets to list who does the vocals.

Elitists, and pure avant-gardists at heart, they worked with all manner of conventional and home-made instruments, performing wild and demanding music. Somehow they were adopted by the experimental rock label Ohr, despite their music being barely rock at all! STÜRMISCHER HIMMEL, recorded at a \"thousand year old cottage on a windy hill\" with their children, is amongst the oddest of albums. Bizarre creative music it certainly is, but Krautrock it is certainly not! Soon they became friends of the Austrian jazz avant-gardist Friedrich Gulda, and were invited to perform at his \"Ossiach\" festival. With Friedrich Gulda guesting on ANIMA a long association began with them touring together and being featured on many of each others albums. Some of their later LP's run very close to free-jazz or the serious avant-garde. Also, Limpe Fuchs has recently been working as a soloist.\n\nPaul Fuchs (Fuchshorn, voice, cornet, bass), Limpe Fuchs (voice, drums, Fuchszither, Fuchsbass)\n\nSTÜRMISCHER HIMMEL\n\nLP Ohr OMM 56 011 (1971)\n\nfeatured on: OSSIACH LIVE\n\nANIMA SOUND\n\nLP Melocord ST-LP-NB 0.027 (1971)\n\nANIMA\n\nLP Pilz 20 29097-2 (1972)\n\nfeatured on: HEIDELBERGER JAZZTAGE '72 (1972)\n\nLP BASF/MPS 29 21655 1 (1972)\n\nIT'S UP TO YOU!\n\n2LP Preiser SPR 3268 (Austria, 1974)\n\nMONTE ALTO (1977)\n\nLP Alter Pfarrhof ST-A-33 (1977)\n\nDER REGT MICH AUF/A CONTROVERSY (12/79+10/82)\n\n2LP Ohr Today OMM 580.001 (1982)\n\nfeatured on: AN AFFLICTED MAN'S MUSICA BOX\n\nLP United Dairies UD 012 (UK, 1982)\n\nBRUCHSTÜCKE FÜR ILONA (7/85)\n\n2LP Loft 1010/11 (1985)\n\nAnnexus Quam\n\nAmongst the most innovative of underground Krautrock bands, who, like Organisation, built the foundation for a new type of music. Their roots stem back to 1967 as the band Ambition In Music, from Kamp-Lintfort near Düsseldorf, and by 1970 they'd expanded, took on all sorts of influences and ideas, and moved well away from their hippy-rock roots, becoming Annexus Quam. The earliest morsel of Annexus Quam (recorded during the sessions for their debut LP) is the uniquely ethnic \"Kollodium\", featured on the excellent OHRENSCHMAUS compilation. It's now a rarity worth seeking out, showing their roots, tripping-out like a cosmic Third Ear Band. Their debut album OSMOSE (issued with a novelty multi-fold cover) is most fascinating, even more cosmic, than \"Kollodium\", featuring much guitar and unusual use of jazz instruments in what is really a rock based music. A really spacious fusion of avant-garde, rock, jazz, and unusual use of psychedelic studio effects, somewhere between Ash Ra Tempel and Kollektiv maybe, it is considered by many as one of the finest Ohr albums. After a change in personnel, and much playing at jazz festivals, BEZIEHUNGEN dived head-first into the realms of free-jazz. Admittedly one of the best examples of the genre, it still had its moments, though there are parts that jar and grate, with much experimental improvisation akin to early Iskra or Music Improvisation Company.\n\nUwe Bick (drums, vocals, percussion), Jürgen Jonuschies (bass, vocals, percussion), Werner Hostermann (clarinet, organ, vocals, percussion), Peter Werner (guitar, vocals, percussion), Hans Kämper (trombone, Spanish guitar, vocals, percussion), Ove Volquartz (sax), Harald Klemm (flute, vocals, percussion)\n\nfeatured on: OHRENSCHMAUS (9/70)\n\n2LP Ohr OMM 2/56.006 (1971)\n\nOSMOSE (9/70)\n\nLP Ohr OMM 56007 (1970)\n\nBEZIEHUNGEN (5/72)\n\nLP Ohr OMM 556.028 (1972)\n\nAnyone's Daughter\n\nOne of the many progressive rock bands to appear in the late-70's inspired by the likes of Genesis, Gentle Giant, Jane, et al., Anyone's Daughter were far better than most. Their early albums featured English vocals, ADONIS being a very accomplished debut of refined progressive rock, with strong symphonic elements, jazzy touches and a notable debt to Eloy. Obviously intent on trying to get international fame their second LP, tried for an even more direct style, but paled next to ADONIS. A radical change from hereon, especially on their third album PIKTOR'S VERWANDLUNGEN, a conceptual opus (live in concert) featuring mainly spoken German texts along with vast instrumentals in the realms of Novalis and Grobschnitt, and only a couple of actual \"songs\", it is arguably their most successful, and certainly their most experimental. IN BLAU returned to a more accessible style, almost like mid-70's Genesis sung in German. A good album, but from hereon the Anyone's Daughter sound paled significantly, with shorter compositions on an ever more melodic song based level. The LIVE double was thus very disappointing.\n\nHarald Bareth (bass, lead vocals), Uwe Karpa (guitars), Kono Konopik (drums, rototoms, cymbals), Matthias Ulmer (pianos, synthesizers, organ, vocals)\n\nADONIS (9/78)\n\nLP Brain 60.186 (1979)\n\nANYONE'S DAUGHTER\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 145.612 (1980)\n\nPIKTOR'S VERWANDLUNGEN (18/1/81)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 145.624 (1981)\n\nIN BLAU (12/81)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 145.632 (1982)\n\nNEUE STERNE (2/83)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 145.640 (1983)\n\nLIVE (1983)\n\n2LP Corona CMC 018001 (1984)\n\nLAST TRACKS (1979-84)\n\nLP private release 86007 (1986)\n\nArakontis\n\nAn obscure Berlin jazz-rock band (formed 1975) with the accent on percussion, of whom we know very little, except having heard their contribution on the BERLIN FUSION compilation.\n\nMichael \"Willy\" Wilke (guitar), Dieter Anker (guitar), Gerard Batrya (bass), Andreas Hommelsheim (keyboards), Lutz Halfter (drums), Tommy Goldschmidt (percussion), Michael Tybus (percussion)\n\nfeatured on: BERLIN FUSION\n\nLIVE AT THE QUASIMODO\n\nLP Blackbird BD 102 (1981)\n\nArdo Dombec\n\nVery little is known about Ardo Dombec, though they were quite untypical of the Pilz label, being a heavy, bluesy and slightly jazzy rock with the accent on songs rather than instrumentals, and barely did they sound German. Undoubtedly they were inspired by the late-60's work by American bands like Chicago Transit Authority or Blood Sweat & Tears (as obviously were Creative Rock and Emergency), and admittedly the album ARDO DOMBEC had its moments, combining blues, soul and jazz styles into a song-based rock music, all with surprising depth in the arrangements for a four-piece band. Obviously a great deal of multi-tracking was going on! But, ARDO DOMBEC became most notorious for featuring the painful \"five second scratch\" joke track \"Oh, Sorry\" and its rather dangerous looking \"bloody cactus in an ice-cream cone\" cover! Contrastingly their contributions to the HEAVY CHRISTMAS concept sampler showed them at their best - instrumental, radical and full of invention, towards the realms of Thirsty Moon or Kollektiv.\n\nHarald Gleu (guitar, vocals, harmonica), Helmut Hachmann (sax, flute), Wolfgang Spillner (drums, vocals), Michael Ufer (bass)\n\nARDO DOMBEC (8/71)\n\nLP Pilz 20 21095-2 (1971)\n\nfeatured on: HEAVY CHRISTMAS\n\nArgile\n\nAn obscure ethnic fusion band from Nürnberg, that we only discovered very recently and know nothing of historically. Aptly being with Schneeball Records, the album NIMDIRSI is a step aside from Embryo, drawing on Asian and North African cultures, blending in a wide variety of classical and rock elements too, and despite being mostly percussive, it is quite relaxed and moody, with rich textures occasionally reminding of quieter Third Ear Band, with diversions from Between through to Oregon or Codona realms. The more recent IDJO is much more Afro-fusion styled, akin to Dissidenten or Embryo's AFRICA album, with a very modern highly produced sound, and features an international cast of musicians (most notably Ramesh Shotham).\n\nStefan Lederer (dolgi, pianos, percussion, gong), Dieter Weberpils (quena, flutes, percussion, piccolo), Achim Schmidt (darbouka, drums, marimba, congas, vibes, horn)\n\nLIVE\n\nMC private release (1979)\n\nNIMDIRSI (4/83)\n\nLP Schneeball 1036 (1983)\n\nArktis\n\nAlthough mostly a straight hard-rock band, Arktis did however have their moments. They were certainly not professionally trained musicians, and their amateurish edge gave them a very different feel. Not being with a major label they also took chances, especially so on their debut which featured numerous lengthy instrumentals, especially rewarding is the side-long \"Rare Girl\". Arktis had hints of early Jane, Harlis or even Pancake in their music, but they never really seemed to know exactly what they wanted to do. This is especially notable on the session recorded with Conny Plank in December 1974, where they come across as totally deadly bland. But there again, Arktis could be seen as innovators, with unusually early new-wave touches. But most rewarding of all is the bonus material found on the CD reissue of their second album ARKTIS TAPES, two lengthy instrumental jams in the manner of Cargo or Man that proved Arktis had much more potential than the original LP's insinuated.\n\nKarin Töppig (vocals), Klaus Blachut (guitar), Klaus Göllner (bass), Harry Kottek (drums)\n\nARKTIS (16-19/10/73)\n\nLP private release R 4040 (1974)\n\nARKTIS TAPES (1974-75)\n\nLP Bon-bons-records BBR 7502 (1975)\n\nON THE ROCKS\n\nLP private release ARK-76-1 (1976)\n\nArmaggedon\n\nFronted by prolific guitarist Frank Diez, Armageddon were one of the foremost Berlin exponents of Anglo-American inspired rock, and much better than most of their contemporaries, yet until the CD reissue hardly anyone had heard of them! With their influence clearly defined, the album contained excellent versions of Jeff Beck's \"Rice Pudding\" and Spooky Tooth's \"Better By You, Better Than Me\", Armageddon should have been an international hit, as they had an accessible sound with lots of complex and highly progressive elements. But, as with most Kuckuck releases, nobody noticed. Nowadays it's revered as one of the finest heavy rock albums in the early-70's. Unfortunately short-lived, Armageddon only made the one album and then split.\n\nFrank Diez (lead guitar, vocals), Manfred Galatik (electric piano, bass, vocals), Michael Nürnberg (bass, rhythm guitar), Jürgen Lorenzen (drums)\n\nARMAGGEDON (7-8/70)\n\nLP Kuckuck 2375 003 (1970)\n\nAsh Ra Tempel (Ashra)\n\nOn the late-60's Berlin underground scene, there was a growing trend for radical innovative bands. One band was the embryonic Ash Ra Tempel, then known as Steeple Chase Bluesband (formed June 1969), who played a freak-out blues rock with John Mayall influences. The original line-up was: Manuel Göttsching (guitar), Hartmut Enke (bass) and Wulf Arp (drums), with Volker Zibell (harmonica) joining in August 1969. Arp was momentarily replaced by Wolfgang Müller, at which time they gained wide exposure with an appearance in concert on TV. A document of Steeple Chase Bluesband can be found on THE PRIVATE TAPES, which is just the sort of stoned blues-rock underground we expected.\n\nHaving left Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze met up with Manuel and Hartmut and hatched the idea of Ash Ra Tempel. At this time all three were also involved in Konrad Schnitzler's Eruption project. In August 1970 they started rehearsals and also played concerts, becoming notorious for improvisations that could exceed 30 minutes yet be most fascinating and invigorating. Documents from various concerts can be found on THE PRIVATE TAPES, revealing the innovation of the band, in which Klaus was much more than just a drummer (playing steel guitar, organ, electronics, etc.), but as a drummer he was something else!\n\nAfter a couple of aborted demo's Ash Ra Tempel decided to go to Hamburg and record an album proper, with the aid of Conny Plank. This resulted in their debut, which was housed in a mystical elaborate centre-opening gatefold cover. As with their live jams, Ash Ra Tempel on record was a unique twist on the space-rock music as pioneered by Pink Floyd and Hawkwind, with elements of both yet devoid of songs, free-rock in the truest sense. Just one track per side: firstly with the power-drive storming \"Amboss\" (close to Klaus' work in Tangerine Dream) and in contrast, the shimmering timeless \"Traummaschine\". A yin-and-yang type concept that made for an extraordinary album. But, not too long after this, with a yearning for greater things in life than just playing drums, Klaus left Ash Ra Tempel, saying to Manuel \"You keep the name, I'm going to do other things\" and went on to pursue a most fruitful solo career as one of the pioneers of synth music.\n\nAfter this, the former Steeple Chase Bluesband drummer Wolfgang Müller returned. The next album SCHWINGUNGEN (\"Vibrations\" in English) returned to their bluesy origins, and again (like their debut LP) it had contrasting sides. \"Light And Darkness\" exists as the closest any German band have got to early Hawkwind, a wild acid-rock cum cosmic-blues music fronted by eccentric vocalist John L. spouting rather than singing his LSD induced visions. It's intense, powerful, and for some - too dark and unnerving. In stark contrast, \"Suche & Liebe\" owed a huge debt to Pink Floyd's \"A Saucerful Of Secrets\", complete with shimmering vibes, a hazy electronic mist, and an overdose of Dave Gilmour style glissando guitars, stretching out to cosmic bliss.\n\nHereon, Ash Ra Tempel history becomes a mite complex, with involvement from Timothy Leary and numerous other projects, like the jam sessions released as The Cosmic Jokers. Ohr boss Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser had a vision of making the ultimate psychedelic trip, and naturally Timothy Leary being in nearby Switzerland lead to the opportunity of a lifetime. Hartmut was very keen on this idea, and went to Switzerland to meet Leary, and work out a concept based on \"the seven steps to a better karma of consciousness\". The results were SEVEN UP, a crazed trip with Leary at the helm. Timothy Leary had spiked the 7 Up that the band were drinking with LSD. The trip was set, and obviously too, was the title! On the tongue-in-cheek \"Space\", stoned 50's styled blues fronted by Leary, Brian Barritt and sexy backing singers, fused with Krautrock, psychedelia and an overdose of electronics. In true Ash Ra Tempel tradition, \"Time\" contrasted greatly, returning to the spacey realms of \"Schwingungen\" and moving the closest Ash Ra Tempel got to the cosmic Gong sound. The SEVEN UP experience caused the disintegration of Ash Ra Tempel as a proper band, \"Gedanken\" (on the KOSMISCHE MUSIK sampler) showed how much in flux Ash Ra Tempel had become. A huge band one moment, and next they were but two!\n\nSuch was the unpredictability of Ash Ra Tempel's line-up, that the next album JOIN INN resulted from an impromptu jam, recorded while Manuel, Hartmut and Rosi were waiting for everyone else that was supposed to turn up for the Walter Wegmüller TAROT sessions. It saw the return of Klaus Schulze to the band, and again an album of stark contrasts: \"Freak And Roll\" being the raunchiest relentless wah-wah guitar rock freak-out ever, and the cosmic drifting Schulze synthesizer-dominated \"Jenseits\" which featured Manuel's girlfriend Rosi Müller reciting her story of the Timothy Leary experience. After this, the trio toured for a while, playing at the Actuel Festival in Paris in February 1973, amongst other venues. But, two weeks on, after a concert in Cologne, as Manuel put it \"Hartmut was too spaced out to play any more\", Hartmut left Ash Ra Tempel. Though Klaus had been playing in the band, he wasn't an official member, he was more into developing his solo career.\n\nSo, Ash Ra Tempel became Manuel Göttsching and whoever was handy at the time. STARRING ROSI, recorded with Rosi Müller was very varied, sometimes comparable to Gong and Camel, and there's even a cosmic tango! Yet, still there's many classic touches. Also featured was Harald Grosskopf on drums, whom Manuel had worked with on The Cosmic Jokers sessions. After this, alone, Manuel went on to record his most innovative album INVENTIONS FOR ELECTRIC GUITAR, entirely created with guitar and echo devices, though you'd hardly believe it! Akin to Günter Schickert's SAMTVOGEL or more recent Robert Fripp, yet more sequential, cosmic and floating, awash with those typically Göttsching guitar licks. Almost like synthesizer music, yet purely guitar!\n\nContinuing solo, adding synthesizers to his instrumentation, he eventually adopted the guise of Ashra. Manuel also worked in collaboration with many other musicians, including sessions with ex-Agitation Free members Lutz Ulbrich and Michael Hoenig, and in concert with ex-Wallenstein drummer Harald Grosskopf. Some sessions from this period have only appeared as official releases recently, namely the ethereal LE BERCEAU DE CRISTAL film soundtrack, the RIAS radio session DREAM & DESIRE, and the Hoenig/Göttsching jam EARLY WATER. The first two albums released as Ashra at the time were entirely solo, showcasing Manuel's great talent as a multi-instrumentalist, firstly with the cosmic and sequential NEW AGE OF EARTH which showed much Klaus Schulze influence along with unique new way of using sequencers, and then the energetic guitar riffing BLACKOUTS.\n\nSoon Ashra became a proper group. Yet, as a trio, Ashra became far less easy to pin down, CORRELATIONS had an uneasy commerciality, and they almost bordered on disco music on one track of the unevenly balanced BELLE ALLIANCE, yet Ashra still ventured onto more experimental realms. Unique documents of Ashra live in 1979 feature on THE PRIVATE TAPES, showing how many different ideas were at play, attempting an uneasy balance between commercial accessibility and experimentation. This schizophrenic incarnation split and reformed numerous times, and all musicians have recorded solo works and worked in collaboration with other people since. Of the later Ashra albums, the most innovative was WALKIN' THE DESERT which ventured onto new uncharted territory of systemic and weird sound-sampling music, proving Ashra to be just as innovative as they ever were.\n\nHartmut Enke (bass), Manuel Göttsching (guitar, vocals, electronics), Klaus Schulze (drums, percussion, electronics)\n\nASH RA TEMPEL (9-11/3/71)\n\nLP Ohr OMM 56013 (1971) «centre-opening gatefold cover»\n\nSCHWINGUNGEN (9-13/2/72)\n\nLP Ohr OMM 556020 (1972)\n\nSEVEN UP (9-10/8/72)\n\nLP Die Kosmischen Kuriere KK 58001 (1973) «gatefold cover»\n\nfeatured on: KOSMISCHE MUSIK (7/72)\n\nJOIN INN (12/72)\n\nLP Ohr OMM 556032 (1973)\n\nSTARRING ROSI (7-8/73)\n\nLP Kosmische Musik KM 58007 (1973)\n\nINVENTIONS FOR ELECTRIC GUITAR (7-8/74)\n\nLP Kosmische Musik KM 58015 (1975)\n\nNEW AGE OF EARTH (3-6/76)\n\nLP Isadora ISA 9003 (France, 1976)\n\nBLACKOUTS (9/77)\n\nLP Virgin 25686 XOT (1978), Virgin V2091 (UK, 1978)\n\nCORRELATIONS (1978)\n\nLP Virgin 200 431 (1979), Virgin V2117 (UK, 1979)\n\nBELLE ALLIANCE (7/79)\n\nLP Virgin 202 284 (1980)\n\nWALKIN' THE DESERT (1988-89)\n\nLP Navigator NAV 8901-1 (1989)\n\nAssociation PC\n\nAssociation PC were an international free-jazz and rock-fusion band lead by Dutchman Pierre Courbois.

Many of their releases featured a wealth of invention, covering a lot of new ground, stretching the boundaries of jazz. SUN ROTATION and ERNA MORENA were their boldest statements featuring lengthy tracks of great power and aggression, showcasing the talents of Toto Blanke and Jasper van't Hof. In the mid-70's Association PC disintegrated. Toto and Jasper went on to successful solo careers, as well as forming the Electric Circus together.

Fronted by Inga's un-feminine vocals Atlantis' debut was the ideal vehicle for her poignant lyric, with a selection of shorter more varied tracks than on the Frumpy albums, more rock and ballad oriented, though still with some classic tracks. After the ironically wrongly titled IT'S GETTING BETTER, subsequent albums repeated the same formula on an ever more commercial pop and soul level.

Ingo Werner is also known for his earlier work with My Solid Ground and nowadays as a session musician/synthesist. In Baba Yaga, the mixture of ethnic instruments, percussives and multi-keyboards, makes for a music that steps beyond early Between or Deuter, steering clear of any pretty or melodic noodling, moving to darker more abstract realms like the most mysterious Third Ear Band. Largely, this also adds up to a sound close to the later Brainticket albums ADVENTURE and VOYAGE. This one album seems to be the only document of Baba Yaga, and nothing historical is known.

Actually, when comparing ROMANCE 76 to Tangerine Dream's STRATOSFEAR, this revealed his own influence within the Tangerine Dream style of the era, with a sequencer based and sparse electronic music, putting the accent on melody and intricate structure. The orchestral complemented suite that covered side 2 \"Meadow Of Infinity/The Glass Bridge\" is his finest creation, taking synth and rock musics to more classical avant-garde realms. At this time Peter also established the short-lived but prolific Paragon Studio, presenting innovative albums by Cluster, Conrad Schnitzler, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, Asmus Tietchens and various others. Upon leaving Tangerine Dream, subsequent Peter Baumann solo albums saw him move on to the realms of Kraftwerkian electro-pop. A strange move.\n\nIn the early-80's Peter quit his Paragon Studio and moved base to America, recording the abysmal STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT before disappearing from the music scene for some time. He then later reappeared as the owner of the Private Music Record Company promoting light instrumental and new-age music, but has never released an album of his own music since STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT!\n\nROMANCE 76 (7-8/76)\n\nLP Virgin 28311 XOT (1976), Virgin V2069 (UK, 1976)\n\nTRANS HARMONIC NIGHTS (7/78-1/79)\n\nLP Virgin 200 578-320 (1979), Virgin V2124 (UK, 1979)\n\nREPEAT REPEAT\n\nLP Virgin 204 014-320 (1981), Virgin V2214 (UK, 1981)\n\nSTRANGERS IN THE NIGHT\n\nLP Arista 205 970-320 (1983)\n\nBaumann/Koek\n\nDespite what media and many collectors would try to have us believe, Baumann/Koek were nothing whatsoever to do with Peter Baumann. In fact, it would seem that the Baumann/Koek album was a cleverly conceived con-job issued just as Peter announced his departure from Tangerine Dream! With a music based on the Tangerine Dream sequencer style, and often comparable to Michael Bundt's early solo material, it made for a pleasant if simple melodic synth album, and was amongst the first independent Teutonic synth releases to get noticed internationally. As to who exactly Baumann/Koek were - one could guess - though the name Baumann is very common in Germany!\n\nBAUMANN/KOEK (11/78)\n\nLP private release BAU-KE (1979)\n\nBaumstam\n\nThese were an obscure heavy blues-rock band, but with little individual identity, nor any real Krautrock touches, being much more English styled. Their privately issued album is sought after in collectors circles due to its scarcity, more than for its musical content. Despite what Dag Erik Asbjørnsen says about these - which seems to describe a completely different album - in his book \"Cosmic Dreams At Play\", we weren't impressed, as ON TOUR sounds much like an average late-60's British hard-rock album.\n\nUlrich Klawitter (guitar, vocals), Michael Lobbe (guitars), Volker Wobbe (bass), Gerhardt Meyer (drums, percussion)\n\nON TOUR\n\nLP BMF BS 6232 855 (1972)\n\nBayon\n\nThe origins of the DDR band Bayon go back to 1971 and a collection of like-minded students at universities in Weimar who got together to form an amateur band. By 1972 the group had stabilised as two Germans, a Kampuchean and a Cuban, and of course the music from such a cross-culture foursome was unique. Blending folk musics with rock and jazz, it made for a wide range of styles, from psychedelic rock onto pure ethnic music.\n\nSome of their earlier weirder psychedelic type concoctions, as heard on the HALLO series, hint at the Third Ear Band, but are quite original in the use of Oriental touches, blues, psychedelia and 60's pop elements. Their debut LP plunged deeper into oriental musics resulting in what sounded like a Chinese band attempting European fusion, whereas SUITE, probably their most refined and esoteric album, blended in more classical and European folk styles, drawing comparisons to Between and Continuum. As time went on, the band tended to disintegrate on EL SONIDO, and much of their earlier innovation was lost in favour of an odd blending of jazz and Latino elements. But, it must be said that, of all DDR bands Bayon were certainly the most original and intriguing. It's a great shame that they weren't given more freedom in their early days.\n\nChristoph Theusner (acoustic guitar, flute), Sonny Thet (vocals, acoustic guitar, percussion), Reiner Pätzold (bass), + Tobias Morgenstern (accordion), Norbert Jäger (percussion, marimba)\n\nfeatured on: HALLO, NR. 1, 2, 8, 9\n\nBAYON\n\nLP Amiga 8 55 570 (DDR, 1978)\n\nSUITE\n\nLP Amiga 8 55 772 (DDR, 1980)\n\nEL SONIDO (12/82-8/85)\n\nLP Amiga 8 56 139 (DDR, 1985)\n\nBeatique In Corporation\n\nThese were an early blues-rock band from Hamburg whose only recorded output seems to be on the POP & BLUES FESTIVAL album. Their contributions had lengthy instrumental sections and classical touches, showing promise that they could have become a major league band. Who exactly they were, we've no idea!\n\nfeatured on: POP & BLUES FESTIVAL '70\n\nJerry Berkers\n\nAlthough Dutch born, Jerry Berkers was very much a part of the Krautrock scene. He was the original Wallenstein bassist and second vocalist (often taking the lead on MOTHER UNIVERSE), and was also a collaborator in the early Cosmic Courier sessions. Jerry also recorded an album of his unique folky, psychedelic spiced rock (as hinted at in softer Wallenstein songs) showing much influence from acoustic Pink Floyd, in fact British and German folk-song in general. But, be warned, Jerry's deeply intoned Dutch accented German vocals can be a little hard to take at times!\n\nAfter this, Jerry disappeared into obscurity. Rumour has it, that when on an LSD trip he announced to his friends that he was walking back to the land of flowers: Holland (not really that far from Monchengladbach), and he was never seen again. Whether this is true, or just a fanciful tale, we may never know!\n\nJerry Berkers (guitars, bass, percussion, vocals), + Jürgen Dollase (keyboards), Thomas Engel (drums, percussion, choir), Bill Barone (guitar), Walter Westrupp (harmonica), Bernd Witthüser (acoustic guitar), Dieter Dierks (choir)\n\nUNTERWEGS (6-7/72)\n\nLP Pilz 20 29131-6 (1972)\n\nNa Na Tschu Tschu / Es Wird Morgen Vorbei Sein\n\n7\" Pilz 05 19128-6 (1972)\n\nBerluc\n\nUnlike most DDR progressives who served a long apprenticeship before making an album, Berluc were virtually catapulted onto the scene in early 1979, only a few of months after their formation. Their debut REISE ZU DEN STERNEN was quite remarkable for its invention and originality, especially as a space-rock album with lots of synthesizers, heavy rock and ballads, almost a cross between Stern Meissen and Hawkwind, with typically East Euro touches akin to Omega and Progres 2. Unfortunately, further albums (with a different guitarist and bassist each time) paled each in succession to a rather ordinary indistinguishable song-based 80's DDR rock mediocrity.\n\nDietmar Ränker (drums), Alexander Stehr (keyboards), Manfred Kähler (vocals), Gerd Pöppel (guitar), Günter Briesenick (bass)\n\nREISE ZU DEN STERNEN (1979)\n\nLP Amiga 8 55 692 (DDR, 1979), Pool 6.24959 (1979)\n\nHUNDERTTAUSEND URGEWALTEN (1981)\n\nLP Amiga 8 55 934 (DDR, 1982)\n\nROCKER VON DER KÜSTE\n\nLP Amiga 8 56 090 (DDR, 1984)\n\nBetween\n\nA most unusual and unique group, the Munich combo Between (formed in 1970 as Between The Chairs) were the brainchild of musical theorist and experimentalist Peter Michael Hamel. As such, Between drew together a wide range of international musicians into a musical and cultural melting pot. Between were aptly in between everything, both musically and culturally.\n\nFeaturing avant-garde tendencies within a music that blended the medieval, the ancient and the futuristic, with jazz and rock musics, the initial results on their debut EINSTEIG were most inspiring. Arguably a step on from The Third Ear Band (sans the mantric rhythms) Between were invention in the extreme, in a music that was melodic yet challenging. Not surprising for a band that featured such acclaimed musicians as James Galway, Roberto Détrée and Robert Eliscu. There are some extraordinary cosmic excursions here too, all amounting to a revolutionary mixture of psychedelic and world musics. EINSTEIG is still as remarkable and fresh now as when it was created. Further albums developed the Between sound on an increasingly ethnic level AND THE WATERS OPENED with its atmospheric dronings from Détrée's moto-cello is probably Between's most innovative and fascinating, it's an album that oozes beauty and mystery. It's almost chilling! DHARANA and CONTEMPLATION were the most ambitious on a cross-cultural level, and were much more serious in their attitude. Both of these combined Indian and African musics into a larger more symphonic sound, notably so the lengthy excursions that encompassed the second side of each. Finally, with SILENCE BEYOND TIME Between moved both closer to esoteric ECM jazz realms, notably because of Roger Jannotta's presence and other influences, and also moved closer to traditional ethnic musics.\n\nIt's a great shame that Between split after this. Peter Michael Hamel has been quite prolific since, going on to work solo in systemic/new-age music and also serious avant-garde. Also, Roberto Détrée has continued his work with novel instrument creations. During Between's history Peter Michael Hamel also worked with Agitation Free, Bob Eliscu worked on and off with Popol Vuh in tandem with Between, and Cotch Black was also in the rock group Sinto, and the jazz/percussion ensemble Niagara. An oddity in Between's discography is the album HESSE BETWEEN MUSIC, which wasn't really a Between album as such, but a radio-play project of one Gerd Westphal with Between and guests. Its message is lost to non-German ears, and musically only some of it is real Between. Approach with caution!\n\nRoberto Détrée (guitar, moto-cello), Jimmy J.

In their early days, dogged by military service commitments, and ideological differences, the line-up was in flux for many years. In fact, only two original members remained by the time of their first album, at which time they had moved base to Berlin for a while.\n\nTheir debut was released with a special mock birth control pill case type cover, and introduced them as an original hard-rock band with a classical edge, extensively featuring the keyboards of Reinhold Sobotta. Highly progressive (with a psychedelic edge) and with an original sound, they also paid homage to one of their influences with a highly creative version of The Doors' \"Light My Fire\". Comparable to many British bands of the era, Birth Control were accessible and creative, yet rarely on their studio albums did they ever show how talented they really were. The album OPERATION was much more conventional than their debut, and they also released a lot of singles at this time. This was Birth Control the underground pop band, with a hard-rock based style. Birth Control were the straightest of rock bands on the Ohr label!\n\nStrangely, after moving to CBS, the third Birth Control album HOODOO MAN took them to very different realms. It's surprising that the same album that spawned a hit single could also be their most experimental, the creativity in HOODOO MAN ranges from sublime to outrageous. But, ever unpredictable, the album REBIRTH was not so hot. It seemed that CBS wanted Birth Control to become a German Chicago type brass-rock band. Yet, the double album LIVE revealed their talent as superb musicians and improvisers, showcasing Zeus B. Held as a major new asset.Moving away from 60's influences, the concept album PLASTIC PEOPLE had its moments, with a move to more sophisticated mid-70's progressive styles, and complexly composed works featuring synths, winds and guitars. It was BACKDOOR POSSIBILITIES that saw their final creative peak, being a surreal concept work, with a move into more instrumentally complex progressive-rock, like a hybrid of all they had done before, embellished with Gentle Giant type multi-vocal cannons and keyboard stylisms. All change in 1977, adding two ex-Message members, and subsequent albums moved to a funky pop-rock, becoming less interesting with each release. A minor highlight was the LIVE '79 album, which recaptured some early magic. Since this, Birth Control have reformed many times without any real success.\n\nBernd Koschmidder (bass), Reinhold Sobotta (organ), Bernd Noske (drums, vocals), Bruno Frenzel (guitar, vocals)\n\nOctober / Freedom\n\n7\" Amadeo AVRS 21560 (1969)\n\nNo Drugs / All I Want Is You\n\n7\" Metronome M 25204 (1970)\n\nBIRTH CONTROL\n\nLP Metronome MLP 15.366 (1970)\n\nHope / Rollin'\n\n7\" Ohr OS 57003 (1970)\n\nOPERATION (2/71)\n\nLP Ohr OMM 56015 (1971)\n\nWhat's Your Name / Believe In The Pill\n\n7\" Ohr OS 57007 (1972)\n\nHOODOO MAN (9-10/72)\n\nLP CBS S 65316 (1973)\n\nNostalgia / Kaulstoß\n\n7\" CBS 1682 (1973)\n\nREBIRTH (11/73)\n\nLP CBS 65963 (1974)\n\nLIVE (6/74)\n\n2LP CBS 88088 (1974)\n\nPLASTIC PEOPLE (5-6/75)\n\nLP CBS 80921 (1975)\n\nBACKDOOR POSSIBILITIES (7-8/76)\n\nLP Brain 60.019 (1976)\n\nFall Down / Laugh Or Cry\n\n7\" Metronome 30.036 (1977)\n\nINCREASE (7-8/77)\n\nLP Brain 60.066 (1977)\n\nTITANIC (5-7/78)\n\nLP Brain 60.149 (1978)\n\nLIVE '79 (6/79)\n\nLP Brain 60.240 (1979)\n\nCOUNT ON DRACULA (10-12/79)\n\nLP Ariola 201 299 (1980)\n\nDEAL DONE AT NIGHT (11-12/80)\n\nLP Ariola 203 423 (1981)\n\nBÄNG (5-6/82)\n\nLP Ohr Today OMM 560.002 (1982)\n\nThe Blackbirds\n\nAmongst the earliest of Krautrock bands, The Blackbirds (like Xhol) started elsewhere before venturing on to experimental realms. In fact, they were originally a 60's pop band typical of the soul-beat era, but with a touch of the Mothers Of Invention type satire and some progressive touches. Although their debut NO DESTINATION had its moments, it is generally very dated and only of marginal interest. Curiously it only ever gained a UK release.\n\nBy the time of their second album TOUCH OF MUSIC, the three year gap had made a lot of difference. In fact, only one member (Werner Breinig) remained from the original line-up, and they had moved on to a classical spiced rock music of great invention, blending heavy and spacey styles with great finesse. Strong songs form the basis of most tracks, all of which are sufficiently long enough to give plenty of room for solos from flute, violin, guitar and keyboards. Stylistically The Blackbirds here come pretty close to Italian bands of the era like New Trolls, Panna Fredda, Hero, at al, (a hint of Xhol Caravan and Vanilla Fudge even more so) and they also had much in common with British bands like Skin Alley or Jody Grind. It's a shame they never made a third album!\n\nWerner Breinig (guitar, vocals), Heinz Koop (bass), Hubert Koop (organ), Helmut Vigneron (drums)\n\nNO DESTINATION\n\nLP Saga FID 2113 (UK, 1968)\n\nTOUCH OF MUSIC\n\nLP OPP 5-34 (1971)\n\nBlack Spirit\n\nOne of many obscure bands on the little-known independent label Brutkasten, Black Spirit were of Italo-German origins, and may actually have been Swiss.

They were very basic Edgar Broughton Band type stuff really, nothing more. But, despite this, DIRT BOX still gained a reputation in collectors circles amongst those liking gutsy heavy rock. This said, the album only has one track of any real merit for Krautrock fans, which reflects Andreas Scholz's origins in Murphy Blend.\n\nMichael Fechner (guitar), Richard Routledge (vocals, guitar), Andreas Scholz (bass), Norbert Kagelmann (drums)\n\nDIRT BOX (17-20/12/71)\n\nLP BASF 20 21238-6 (1972)\n\nToto Blanke\n\nToto Blanke was originally the guitarist in the German-Dutch avant-garde/jazz-fusion band Association PC. With them he served a long apprenticeship, and made friends with many international musicians, achieving fame as one of the most dazzling fusion guitarists in Europe. His work as a soloist, as group leader, and with his own experimental band Electric Circus, has indeed been most varied. With the aid of top international session musicians (John Lee and Gerry Brown were both previously in Dutchman Chris Hinze's band) on his debut SPIDER'S DANCE, he took the Association PC sound into rock realms (as hinted at by his composition \"Spider\" on Association PC's SUN ROTATION), and came up with fiery fusion akin to Mahavishnu Orchestra, playing some dazzlingly fiery guitar against Charlie Mariano's flute and sax. Since then, Toto's ventured onto creating all sorts of fusions, from simple classical and jazz musics through to groundbreaking avant-garde, both as a multi-instrumental soloist and in collaboration with other musicians. Sometimes Toto embraces technology and pushes it to the limits, and at other times he ignores it altogether. Such is his schizophrenic personality as a musician. Apart from numerous albums with Electric Circus (see entry elsewhere) his most interesting release since the 70's is the more recent, and very bizarre, adventurous classical/electronic-fusion of FOOL'S PARADISE.\n\nToto Blanke (guitars), + Joachim Kühn (electric piano), John Lee (bass), Charly Mariano (soprano sax, flute), Gerry Brown (drums)\n\nSPIDER'S DANCE (7-8/74)\n\nLP Vertigo 6360 623 (1974)\n\nTALES OF TOMORROW (2/78)\n\nLP Bacillus BAC 2054 (1978)\n\nSOMEWHERE IN TIME\n\nLP Aliso 1012 (1981)\n\nBlonker\n\nThese were originally a fully fledged band on their debut album DIE ZEIT STEHT STILL, playing a lightweight progressive rock, stylistically close to Novalis or DDR bands like Karat or Electra, with folky phrased lyrics in German. Later releases however (not listed here) saw the rest of the band scarper, leaving Blonker as the vehicle for guitarist Dieter Geike with the aid of various session musicians (Peter Franken, Dieter Horns, Jochen Petersen, etc.), playing a lightweight guitar fronted instrumental music, even softer than Michael Rother, akin to Sky or Hank Marvin. Really, these albums are so wet and pretty, that they are not musically within the scope of this book!\n\nKay Jessen (vocals, percussion), Thomas Grützmacher (bass, percussion), Nicolas Stallard (keyboards), Helge Tillmann (drums), Dieter Geike (guitars, percussion), + Gaby Borowski (choir), Rolf Köhler (choir), Heiko Effertz (choir), Bernardo Ball (percussion)\n\nDIE ZEIT STEHT STILL (11-12/77)\n\nLP Brain 60.104 (1978)\n\nfeatured on: BRAIN FESTIVAL ESSEN II\n\nBokaj Retsiem\n\nThis was the project of one Rainer Degner (ex-German Bonds and Rattles guitarist), creating a psychedelic rock and beat theme music all based on the song \"Meister Jakob\" (note: Bokaj Retsiem is Meister Jakob backwards, or what we know as \"Frère Jacques\"). Hardly \"psychedelic underground\", of minor curiosity interest only.\n\nPSYCHEDELIC UNDERGROUND\n\nLP Fass 1532 WY (1969)\n\nM.L. Bongers Project\n\nAn obscure band, fronted by singer Marcel L. Bongers, of whom we know virtually nothing historically. Comparable to many other fellow late-70's progressives: Second Movement, Rousseau, Pancake, et al., the strangely named M.L. Bongers Project had a slightly different angle, in that they made that spacey type of progressive, often more akin to the French band Pulsar. They were a lot better than most, with thick wedges of keyboards, guitars and lots of flute, especially the lengthy suite covering side 1 of the LP.\n\nJacques Thysen (bass, acoustic guitars), Günter Heinz (drums, percussion), Joe Grande (guitar), J.

Later, wisely changing name and becoming Brainstorm, they still attempted to shock with their debut album SMILE A WHILE, which caused such a scandal due to its outrageous cover that it was apparently withdrawn from release! The music on both Brainstorm albums was a highly inventive blend of songs and instrumentals, with a touch of Zappa, and Canterbury inspired certainly, akin to Caravan, Hatfield & The North, Soft Machine, etc., but also with a style all of their own. Highlighted by quality musicianship, notably a dizzying array of winds and keyboards, with complexly arranged instrumentals and, like the Dutch band Supersister, a penchant for eccentric tongue-in-cheek humour. Brainstorm lived up to their name, and both albums are classics of the genre. Roland Schaefer later became a bastion of Guru Guru, and Joachim Koinzer has fronted numerous fusion bands since.\n\nEddy von Overheidt (organ, electric piano, vocals), Joachim Koinzer (drums, percussion), Roland Schaeffer (guitar, soprano/tenor saxes, clarinet, electric piano, percussion, basses, vocals), Rainer Bodensohn (flutes, bass, vocals)\n\nSMILE A WHILE (8/72)\n\nLP Spiegelei 28 505-6U (1972)\n\nYou're The One / Das Schwein Trügt\n\n7\" Spiegelei 22 319-8N (1973)\n\nSECOND SMILE (3-6/73)\n\nLP Spiegelei 28 596-5U (1973)\n\nBrainticket\n\nThe history of Brainticket is virtually undocumented, and their origins are also very confused. And, although they are considered by many to be a Krautrock band, they were really a nomad troupe, going wherever the scene took them. Basically, Brainticket were born out of the 60's jazz and soul scenes, and a variety of groups featuring Belgian born keyboardist Joel Vandroogenbroeck. Their origins can be traced back to 1968, as the nucleus of Dee Dee Barry And The Movements, with Joel Vandroogenbroeck (organ, flute), Ron Bryer (guitar), and Wolfgang Paap (drums), though this was far away from the music they were later to create. Joel, along with a few like-minded musicians active in the South of Germany, inevitably got caught up in the fertile Krautrock scene, and like many other bands from the area they formed an international combo that drew on a wide range of influences.\n\nTheir debut COTTONWOODHILL (sometimes just referred to as BRAINTICKET or \"SAME\") has long been one of the most revered and quoted of psychedelic albums. All but for the two short dreamy surreal tracks that open side 1 of the album (which hint at the later Brainticket sound), the majority of the album is a long repetitive funky groove opus, propelled along by chunky organ and percussion. It has the spirit of Can, the outrageousness of Funkadelic, and pre-empting Faust, and for 1971 it's certainly nothing less than revolutionary. Over this musical mantra, Dawn Muir recants vividly the experience of an extraordinary LSD trip, acting it out for us, including all the paranoia, visions of ecstasy, power and confusion, the pure surreal buzz of the experience. This is topped off by extraordinary use of special effects, sound-collage and electronics. And, if that weren't enough, they also resort to all manner of trickery and surprising diversions. It all adds up to a strange and unique album that's still surprisingly startling and fresh over 25 years on, and as a result it's also been the subject of numerous homage's.\n\nMoving base to Italy, some of the band split off and formed the Swiss hard-rock band Toad, and thus a new version of Brainticket evolved. Though Brainticket were never quite so radical or eccentric again, the second album PSYCHONAUT, being by a transitional band, covered a wide range of styles. It was more your typical trippy progressive, with actual songs and compositions, sometimes in the vein of early Hawkwind, yet often closer to Quintessence and Group 1850. There are many facets to the music here, especially when venturing on to trippy folk territory, with female lead vocals, akin to Emtidi or Pentangle (a little). New members: Swiss percussionist Barney Palm and American singer/multi-instrumentalist Carole Muriel, were to become the nucleus of the third version of Brainticket recording CELESTIAL OCEAN, a bizarre mystical concept based on Egyptian mythology. It's an album that saw a diversion to weirder more electronic realms, with strong use of ethnic instruments and a wealth of surprises. Strangely, in a way, it pre-empted Nik Turner's similarly conceived SPHINX XITINTODAY project, and its influence can be heard in much of 80's space-rock. Though very different to the original Brainticket, they were still proving to be innovators. This trio apparently existed for some time touring Germany, Switzerland and Italy in the mid-70's.\n\nWe know that Brainticket carried on through the late-70's, as concert tapes have been advertised by some dealers, though nothing was released again until 1980. This later incarnation, who issued the albums ADVENTURE and VOYAGE, seemed to be purely a studio project, based in Basel Switzerland, making a highly experimental music, with lots of jazz and diverse ethnic influences. For the first time, Brainticket were a totally instrumental combo, leaving the music to speak for itself. Apart from a proliferation of electronics, these albums strongly feature percussion and flute, and in the established tradition of Brainticket, these were groundbreaking stuff, again radical innovative albums, though far from the psychedelic realms of the 70's releases. (Note: the Purple Pyramid CD releases feature the wrong LP's, ADVENTURE is actually VOYAGE, and visa-versa!) In parallel, during the late-70's and through on to the 90's, Joel Vandroogenbroeck has also fronted other projects, he had is own jazz-rock band Joel, and has also done much solo work, as well as travelling the world researching obscure ethnic music cultures. It seems that he is currently earning a living by recording music for film and TV.

Brave New World's whole oeuvre was the concept of the Aldous Huxley science fiction novel. An unlikely \"supergroup\", and remarkably the music they created was unprecedented and original. On their LP, Brave New World blended styles, in such an unlikely manner, hinting at the music later created by the likes of Art Zoyd or Univers Zero. Virtually instrumental, blending medieval musics, electronics, jazz and rock in a dazzlingly complex fusion, a big step beyond early Between, with the Krautrock feel of Annexus Quam, Achim Reichel, Tomorrow's Gift, et al.

An all-time Krautrock classic.\n\nDicky Tarrach (drums, percussion), Lucas Lindholm (bass, bass fiddle, organ, piano), Herb Geller (flutes, cor anglais, alto/soprano/tenor saxes, organ), Reinhart Firchow (recorders, flutes, ocarina, stylophone, percussion, vocals), John O'Brien-Docker (guitars, organ, percussion, vocals, wind chimes), + Esther Daniels (vocals)\n\nIMPRESSIONS ON READING ALDOUS HUXLEY (5-6/72)\n\nLP Vertigo 6360 606 (1972)\n\nBreakfast\n\nAn obscure mid-70's rock band, of the more mainstream type with notable American influences.

The original band, who were inspired by Pentangle (their quote, not ours) and European folk musics, played a mixture of all sorts of cultures. They wrapped vibrant songs in a hybrid of folk, Indian music, psychedelic rock and cosmic musics, all fused together to form a delicate spacious folk-fusion of great beauty. Their style was characterised by Jenni Schücker, who has a most sensual vocal style ideally suited to such music, all ready to wisp us off to the clouds with the \"heads flying by\" - to quote the surreal psychedelic lyrics of the opening \"Gedanken\". With the exception of \"Lassie\" (a minor low-point, being a traditional folk song) BRÖSELMASCHINE is a delightful album, trippy and otherworldly, stylishly Teutonic cosmic folk, not least so in the addition of Dieter Dierks spooky Mellotron, sitars, zither, tablas, and the like. It all adds up to an ideal companion to Emtidi's SAAT or Hölderlin's TRAUM.\n\nThe later incarnation made a different type of music, and was less of a proper band and more a vehicle for Bursch's own ego, though Willi Kismer from the original band also carried on through. Peter Bursch had become celebrated, with books published on his guitar techniques and was eager to show the world, though really neither of these later albums amounted to much.\n\nJenni Schücker (vocals, flute, shells), Willi Kismer (vocals, guitars, zither), Lutz Ringer (metallophon, bass), Mike Hellbach (congas, tabla, spoons, Mellotron), Peter Bursch (vocals, acoustic guitar, sitar, flute)\n\nBRÖSELMASCHINE (8/71)\n\nLP Pilz 20 21100-2 (1971)\n\nPETER BURSCH UND BRÖSELMASCHINE (2+7/75)\n\nLP Xenophon 161.012 (1976)\n\nI FEEL FINE (5-7/77)\n\nLP Spiegelei INT 160.610 (1978)\n\nBrühwarm\n\nA really eccentric and bizarre political theatre troupe from (we presume) Hamburg. Brühwarm were not a proper band as such, more a quartet of singer/actors, and thus on their LP releases they sought the aid of Ton Steine Scherben as musical backing, who added their aggressive rock style to Brühwarm's strange theatrics. The concoction they came up with certainly owed a debt to Floh De Cologne, though due to the overtly theatrical nature of their albums, lyrically Brühwarm can be very confusing to non-German ears!\n\nRalph, Götz, Donny & Corny (vocals), + Ton Steine Scherben (music)\n\nMANNSTOLL\n\nLP April 0006 (1976)\n\nENTARTET\n\nLP April 0016 (1978)\n\nfeatured on: UMSONST UND DRAUSSEN PORTA WESTVLOTHICA 1978\n\nBullfrog\n\nBullfrog were a rather heavy-handed hard-rock and melodic progressive from the mid-70's, notable for their unusual Rod Stewart like gravel-voiced vocalist Gerd Hoch, but with little in the way of a distinctive style or originality.

After leaving Nine Days Wonder, Michael tried on various occasions to get a new band together. One of these was Nerve, but without any success Nerve soon disbanded, and then Michael made a surprising career change into synth music, teaming up with ex-Tritonus keyboardist Peter K. Seiler as the duo Sirius. Eventually this collaboration with Peter Seiler led to the recording of the very varied synthesizer album JUST LANDED COSMIC KID, which ranged from Schulzian cosmic realms onto upbeat styles, onto many other realms too. It also included the Jarre/Baumann styled single originally credited to Sirius. Not content to stay still, his next album NEON was a dodgy diversion into electro-pop, no doubt inspired by the success of Kraftwerk. Then, two years on, it was all-change again with ELECTRI-CITY, this time for an album of highly inventive borderline industrial synthesizer based music. Based on more aggressive use of analogue synths and sequencers, it often veers towards Cluster, Asmus Tietchens or Moebius & Plank, rhythmic and melodic yet also highly unusual.\n\nMichael Bundt (synthesizers, string ensemble), + Peter K.

Can certainly had the credentials to do so too, with backgrounds in serious avant-garde (studying with Stockhausen) and in jazz. Holger Czukay and Irmin Schmidt had known each other from their contemporary studies, though it was Holger meeting multi-instrumental talent Michael Karoli that set the formation of the band in motion. Being connected with the arts certainly had its advantages. A matter of days after getting a band together, then named \"The Inner Space\", they played their first concert at the Schloss Norvenich, near Cologne in June 1968. A tape of some of this was much later released as PREHISTORIC FUTURE, with a wild rock sound comparable to Amon Düül, though much more avant-garde and free-form.\n\nDavid Johnson (an American jazz winds player who had also worked with Stockhausen) was a member of the band at this time, and featured on some of the early Can sessions, he also acted as their engineer for a while. After the addition of black American singer Malcolm Mooney came Can proper, moving to a more straight ahead rock, that many compare to the Velvet Underground. Due to his fascination with electronics (as further evidenced on the Technical Space Composers Crew album) and his ability to handle the recording equipment, Holger Czukay also became the bands recording engineer. Can's debut album MONSTER MOVIE and the later anthology of early recordings DELAY 1968 documented a music with 60's punk energy, pacey rhythms and the manic vocals of Mooney. But, this phase of Can was short-lived, as Malcolm Mooney was forced to leave the band due to ill health.\n\nThe next lead vocalist to front Can was an unlikely choice, a Japanese busker, one Kenji \"Damo\" Suzuki. His penchant for vocal experimentation led Can in a very different direction. The transition period was documented by the surprisingly varied and creative SOUNDTRACKS, featuring music to a number of underground films. Next was the greatest of Can albums, the monumental double album TAGO MAGO, which, although starting on safe ground, draws the listener in with a succession of even greater weirdness and invention, not least \"Aumgn\" with Jaki's manic drums and \"Peking O.\" where Damo lets out some of the most agonising vocal sounds amidst a plethora of electronic and percussive effects. Weird and radical innovation, that still sounds bizarre twenty odd years on! In contrast (in fact in contrast with each other) the other two albums to feature Damo were, on the whole, less extreme: EGE BAMYASI with a collection of mostly shorter accessible songs, though still odd and uniquely Can, unexpectedly breaking-out with the wild avant-garde 10 minute \"Soup\" on the second side, and FUTURE DAYS which is often quoted as Can's most well-balanced and successful album, with its dreamy cosmic otherworldly atmosphere, understated songs and strong melodic content. This is the era that brought Can international success, with many tours in Britain and the continent. They also recorded sessions for the BBC's \"John Peel Show\" and \"In Concert\" programmes.\n\nAfter Damo's departure, the famous four continued to forge on (sometimes with a featured vocalist in concert: Tim Hardin, Thaiaga Raj Raja Ratnam and Magic Michael amongst them) and produced a quite extraordinarily powerful and very percussive album in SOON OVER BABALUMA, with compositions that were to prove to be great concert favourites, a dense and complex music that was earlier hinted at on the great \"Halleluwah\" and \"Mother Sky\". Yet, ever surprising, the next Can offering LANDED was as different again, and in many ways marked the end of an era in Can history. Here we can hear songs that hint at Holger Czukay's solo project MOVIES, one of Can's most dazzling rock extravaganza's in \"Vernal Equinox\", and lastly their most esoteric and brooding opus, the aptly entitled free-form avant-garde \"Unfinished\".\n\nEarlier, an album of unreleased recordings had been issued on UA's budget series as LIMITED EDITION, documenting the most uncommercial and off-beat Can. In 1976, together with a bonus LP's worth of further previously unissued material, it was issued as UNLIMITED EDITION. This would seem to be Can's response to THE FAUST TAPES, containing some of the weirdest Can ever.\n\nAdmittedly, the later era of Can, borne by the surprise hit single \"I Want More\" and the overtly schizophrenic FLOWMOTION, still offered some exceptional music, yet only the ethnic fusion spiced SAW DELIGHT really shone, strongly featuring Karoli's fluid guitar lines, Schmidt's synthesizers and keyboards bordering on Schulzian realms, and Czukay's expert use of sound effects. It's easy to see why real schizophrenia stepped in on OUT OF REACH, as Holger had gone, and with the unlikely ex-Traffic Rosko Gee and Reebop Kwaku Baah in the ranks there were many conflicting elements at play. However, by the time of their eponymous 70's finale they'd created a formula that worked, all be it safe and easy going compared to the Can of yore.\n\nBut still, right through to the late-70's Can proved to be innovators, especially so in concert, as documented on numerous bootlegs, and also the excellent THE PEEL SESSIONS. It's a shame that more of this excellent music isn't officially documented. After this, Can were put on ice for an unspecified period. But, not content to lay the ghost to rest however, a Can reunion was organised in 1986 with Malcolm Mooney. In 1989 it gained release as RITE TIME, a stylish yet emotionless throwback to the early Can era, understandably it was really \"the wrong time\" and it made little impact. Meanwhile the various Can members are still active on the scene, check elsewhere in this book!\n\nIrmin Schmidt (organ), Holger Czukay (bass), Jaki Liebezeit (percussion, flute), Michael Karoli (guitar), Damo Suzuki (vocals), Malcolm Mooney (vocals)\n\nAgilok & Blubbo / Kamera Song\n\n7\" Vogue DV 14785 (1968)\n\nCredited to: The Inner Space\n\nKama Sutra (11/68)\n\n7\" Metronome M 25128 (1969)\n\nCredited to: Irmin Schmidt\n\nMONSTER MOVIE (10/68-7/69)\n\nLP Music Factory SRS 001 (1969) «limited edition, black & white cover»\n\nSOUNDTRACKS (11/69-8/70)\n\nLP Liberty LBS 83437 (1970), United Artists UAS 29283 (UK, 1973)\n\nTAGO MAGO (11/70-2/71)\n\n2LP United Artists UAS 29211/12 (1971) «gatefold sleeve»\n\nTurtles Have Short Legs / Halleluwah (11/70-2/71)\n\n7\" Liberty 15465 (1971)\n\nSpoon / Shikaku Maru Ten (12/71)\n\n7\" United Artists 35304 (1972)\n\nEGE BAMYASI (12/71-6/72)\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29414 (1972)\n\nFUTURE DAYS (8/73)\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29505 (1973)\n\nLIMITED EDITION (9/68-5/74)\n\nLP United Artists USP 103 (UK, 1974)\n\nSOON OVER BABALUMA (6-8/74)\n\nLP United Artists UAS 29673 (1974)\n\nLANDED (2-4/75)\n\nLP Horzu 1C 062-29 600 (1975), Virgin V2041 (UK, 1975)\n\nUNLIMITED EDITION (9/68-7/75)\n\n2LP Harvest 1C 148-29 653/4 (1976), Caroline CAD 3001 (UK, 1976)\n\nFLOW MOTION (6/76)\n\nLP Harvest 1C 062-31 837 (1976), Virgin V2071 (UK, 1976)\n\nSilent Night / Cascade Waltz (11/76)\n\n7\" Harvest 1C 006-31 973 (1976), Virgin VS 166 (UK, 1976)\n\nSAW DELIGHT (1/77)\n\nLP Harvest 1C 064-32 156 (1977), Virgin V2079 (UK, 1977)\n\nDon't Say No / Return\n\n7\" Harvest 1C 006-32 155 (1977)\n\nOUT OF REACH (10-11/77)\n\nLP Harvest 1C 066-32 715 (1978), Lightning LIP 4 (UK, 1978)\n\nCAN (12/77-3/78)\n\nLP Harvest 1C 066-45 099 (1979), Laser LASL 2 (UK, 1979)\n\nDELAY 1968 (1968-69)\n\nLP Spoon 012 (1981)\n\nPREHISTORIC FUTURE (6/68)\n\nMC Tago Mago 4755 (France, 1984)\n\nRITE TIME (12/86)\n\nLP Mercury 838 883-1 (1989)\n\nHoolah Hoolah\n\n12\" Casablanca 875 751-1 (1990)\n\nCannock\n\nOn the basis of their ROCK OFFERS contribution (the only recording that we've heard), these were a typically Teutonic lightweight but majestic progressive, akin to Rousseau or Jane at their softest, a little Pink Floyd-like, with much use of keyboards to flesh-out the sound.\n\nHans Adolphi (keyboards), Raphaela Ciblis (vocals, percussion), Ralph Ehmann (bass), Holger Hoffmann (drums, congas), Klaus Peter Stiefel (guitar), Dieter Streck (guitar, effects)\n\nfeatured on: ROCK OFFERS\n\nWAITING FOR THE NIGHT\n\nLP Peak 3080 (1980)\n\nFROHE BOTSCHAFT\n\nLP Neue Welt ?

They originated from Karlsruhe, and, as early as 1967, they were performing their own uniquely groundbreaking \"Terror Rock\" music in German! An extremely radical political rock band, especially so in their early days, Checkpoint Charlie were also innovators along with Floh De Cologne and Ton Steine Scherben of a unique German form of rock, blending all sorts of music into a complex and often aggressive rock music. Their debut was very extreme, and very difficult to come to grips with, yet later albums saw more refinement instrumentally, with complex progressive rock styles (akin to Oktober, Lokomotive Kreuzberg, et al.) making headway against the theatrics, especially so on FRÜHLING DER KRÜPPEL, which featured keyboards strongly, and lengthy instrumental sections venturing on to Grobschnitt realms even. Throughout, even into the 80's, Checkpoint Charlie have proven to be amongst the most uncompromising of Krautrock bands. Unfortunately we have not yet managed to find their more recent (presumably) reformation album GURGLERSINFONIE.\n\nHarald Linder (vocals, bass), Uwe von Trotha (vocals), Ma"
