The positive response to the seminar as well as the status quaestionis encouraged me to envisage this publication. The central aim of the seminar was to show that the topic of exile in antiquity is not at all limited to the three most prominent exiles Cicero, Ovid, and Seneca, but that this trias exulum has to be placed in a far larger and more complex discourse of exile and displacement, ranging from Cynicism to Late Antiquity. The present volume adopts an even broader perspective, tracing traditions of concepts and motifs from the oral antecedents of the Iliad and the Odyssey down to the age of Petrarch and demonstrating the immense impact of these traditions on the way in which individuals perceived and described their (real or metaphorical) exile. I would like to thank the Corpus Christi College Centre for the Study of Greek and Roman Antiquity and the Faculty of Literae Humaniores of the University of Oxford for generously supporting the original seminar. E. L. Bowie ﬁrst suggested to me the topic and has been extremely helpful ever since. In the editorial work S. J. Harrison has been a magnaque pars animi consiliique mei and has read and commented on considerable parts of this book. J. A. Richmond and N. W. Slater kindly checked the English of two of the contributions, acutely alerting me also to several philological problems. S. Jödicke has been a tremendous help by checking references and compiling parts of the indices. Moreover, I am grateful to D. Colomo, M. Deufert, S. Gerke, C. Gronemann, P. Grossardt, J. Hazenbos, and R. Hexter for comments on a draft of the introduction. Finally, I would like to thank I. van Rossum, K. F. Plas, and L. Aalders at Brill, and all of the contributors for their cooperation and patience. J. F. G.

Together with the related themes of distance, separation, displacement, detachment, and diaspora it features prominently in the oeuvres of writers who ﬂed from the totalitarian regimes of central and eastern Europe such as Thomas Mann, Nabokov, or Brodsky;1 more recently, exile has become a central theme in postcolonial literature,2 and, in addition, at least from Nietzsche onwards, exile is a common metaphor for the alienation of modern and postmodern intellectuals.3 This increased reﬂection on exile in the twentieth century has not only inﬂuenced research in social sciences and modern languages, but it has also left its mark on the classics, where interest in the exiles of antiquity has grown continuously over the past ﬁfty years. This scholarly interest has, however, been largely conﬁned to the three most prominent ancient writers who went into exile, the ‘exulum trias’4 Cicero, Ovid, and Seneca the Younger; moreover, modern concepts of exile literature have been applied to classical literature without the necessary caution. In what follows I shall ﬁrst point out some of the problems involved in recent approaches to exile in Greek and Latin literature; then I shall brieﬂy explain the aim, concept, and structure of the present volume; ﬁnally, I shall give an outline of the development of ancient discourse on exile. 1 The literature on these and the following authors and groups of authors is vast; cf. e.g. Bevan et al. (1990), Roth-Souton (1994) and the collection of documents written by German exiles in Spalek et al. (1976 ff.). Guida-Laforgia (1995) draws attention to the often forgotten female German writers in exile in the USA. 2 Cf. Gurr (1981), Ashcroft/Grifﬁths/Tifﬁn (2003) 28: “the theme of exile is in some sense present in all such writing”, and see e.g. Chancy (1997) on Caribbean literature, Moeller et al. (1983) and Alvarez Borland (1998) on Latin American literature, Jones et al. (2000), Marquard (1978), Ibrahim (1996) and Mudimbe-Boye (1993) on various African authors, and e.g. Horrocks/Kolinsky (1996) and Bader (1984) on the theme of exile in the literature of the migrant communities of the ﬁrst world. 3 Cf. Goldhill (2000) 1–7 and Eagleton (1970). 4 Cf. the title of Leopold (1904).\n\n2\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nApart from the mostly historical study of Grasmück (1978),5 there have been so far two main attempts to describe and analyse the treatment of exile in classical literature on a broader scale. Inﬂuenced by studies on twentieth century exile literature and based on a “phenomenological” (Walde (2000) 299) or, more precisely, a psychological approach, Doblhofer (1987) has tried to demonstrate that the psychological condition of exile is responsible for many similarities between the literary works of ancient and modern exiles; more recently Claassen (1999a) has presented another assessment of ancient discourse on exile, in which she takes up some of the psychological explanations of Doblhofer6 but organizes the literature according to the narrative perspective, or rather the grammatical person, of the respective works (ﬁrst-person, secondperson, and third-person discourse on exile).7 Both Doblhofer and Claassen view ancient discourse on exile, or at least parts of it, as part of a wider genre or mode of exile literature. Claassen ((1999a) 241) for example explicitly credits Ovid with the “creation of the literary genre of exilic poetry”, and Doblhofer even supplies a list of typical features of exile literature—ancient and modern. However, for several reasons the transfer of the modern concept of exile literature to Greek and Roman antiquity proves to be problematic.8 First of all the English word ‘exile’ is far more precise than the corresponding Greek and Latin terms. Whereas the modern derivatives of the Latin word exilium imply an involuntary departure, sanctioned by political or judicial authorities, the ancient usage of the corresponding terms Ʒƶƥə, fuga, exilium, and their derivatives is less strict. Ʒƶƥə and ƷƧɟƥƧƫƮ cover both the expulsion of groups or individuals and their voluntary departure.9 Possibly inﬂuenced by this Greek usage, Latin 5 On the historical and legal aspects of exile, which are only occasionally touched in the present volume, cf. also the studies by Balogh (1943), Seibert (1979), Cawkwell (1981), Roisman (1982), (1984–6), Brown (1988), McKechnie (1989), Bearzot (2001), Forsdyke (2005) (Greece) and Crifò (1961), (1985) (Rome); cf. also Sordi et al. (1994). 6 Cf. Claassen’s emphasis on experience (1999a) 2: “Quellenforschung is not the major object of the work. Of importance is rather the manner in which each exile experiences his condition and the way in which his reaction is put into words”. Cf. also Claassen’s interpretation of Ovid’s persona/personality (p. 31) and of Cicero’s use of invective (p. 133). 7 Cf. Claassen (1999a) 15. 8 I just mention in passing that in the study of modern literatures, too, the term ‘exile literature’ has been questioned (cf. e.g. the discussion in Stern (1971)) and is, apart from that, usually not employed for a genre or mode but merely indicates a set of authors who have been in exile. 9 Cf. LSJ s.vv., Poll. Onom. 9.157–8, Grasmück (1978) 15 ff., especially 20–9, and Brown (1988) 17.\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n3\n\nauthors since Plautus often do not distinguish too rigorously between fuga (‘ﬂight’) and exilium (‘exile’): thus Plautus clearly employs exilium and fuga as synonyms in Mer. 652: quis modus tibi exilio tandem eveniet? qui ﬁnis fugae? Cicero calls Aristides’ and Metellus’ exile fuga (cf. Cic. Sest. 141, Rep. 1.6) and extends the meaning of exilium also to a place of refuge, and more generally even, to a mere change of place,10 and Ovid regularly refers to his banishment as a fuga and to himself as a profugus.11 Moreover, ancient authors often do not distinguish between exile and other forms of displacement: ancient consolatory treatises on exile, for example, often mix mythical and historical exiles with characters that today would be called fugitives (such as Patroclus) or voluntary exiles (such as Metellus Numidicus),12 and Seneca compares the loss of his patria in exile to the condition of the many immigrants in the Rome of his day (Helv. 6.2–3).13 Doblhofer and Claassen have seen this problem, and at least Claassen has sought a solution by adopting a very general deﬁnition of ‘exile literature’,14 but this evidently leads to a category with somewhat undeﬁned boundaries. A second problem arising from Doblhofer’s and Claassen’s approach concerns the close interaction between the various kinds of ancient treatments of exile. By linking ‘exile literature’ to the psychological condition of exile Doblhofer reveals a clear bias towards subjective, autobiographically tinged treatments of exile and against the ﬁctional, historiographical, philosophical, and political dimension of the theme; a similar focus underlies Claassen’s distinction between ﬁrst-person, second-person, and third-person treatments of exile. However, such a distinction is artiﬁcial and highly problematic. Two passages from Livy 10 Cf. e.g. Cic. Caec. 100: exsilium . . . non supplicium est sed perfugium portusque supplici. nam quia volunt poenam aliquam subterfugere aut calamitatem, eo solum vertunt. This usage reﬂects ancient etymologies of exilium, cf. Doblhofer (1987) 55–6 and e.g. Quint. Decl. 366.2 p. 400, Paul. Epit. p. 479.3–5 (Lindsay). 11 Cf. e.g. Ov. Tr. 3.14.9, Pont. 1.8.50. For further parallels see TLL s.v. fuga 1465.74– 1466.28, s.v. exilium 1490.72 ff., s.v. exul 2100.80 ff., and Doblhofer (1987) 50 ff., Grasmück (1978) 62 ff. (also on the legal aspects). 12 Cf. also Dio Cass. 38.24.2 (part of ‘Philiscus’s consolation to Cicero, see nn. 16–17 below): ƴƶƸƮưɚ ƱƭƧʴƴƵưƮ ȱƴưƮ ƸƲɝƮưƮ ưȝ vɖƮ ǴƬưƮƵƧƳ ưȝ Ʀɖ Ƭƣɚ ȁƬɝƮƵƧƳ ǰƱưƦƩvư˃ƴƫ, Ƭƣɛ ƵƫƮƧƳ Ƭƣɚ ƱɕƮƵƣ ƵɜƮ ƤɛưƮ ƬƣƵƣƮƣƭɛƴƬưƶƴƫ ƱƧƲƫƮưƴƵư˃ƮƵƧƳ, ɉƴƱƧƲ ǰƧɚ ƱƣƮƵƣƸɝƪƧƮ ȀƯƧƭƣƶƮɝvƧƮưƫ, Ƭƣɚ ưȸƦɖƮ vɗƮƵưƫ ƱƣƲɔ Ƶư˃Ƶư ƤƭɕƱƵƧƴƪƣƫ ƮưvɛƨưƶƴƫƮ. 13 Interestingly, the same kind of imprecision can be observed in Joseph Brodsky’s comparison ((1995) 22) of banished writers with Turkish Gastarbeiters, Vietnamese boat people, and other groups of refugees. Cf. also Said (2000) 181: “it is true that anyone prevented from returning home is an exile”, and his subsequent attempt to differentiate between ‘exile’, ‘refugee’, ‘expatriate’, and ‘émigré’. 14 Cf. Claassen (1999a) 14.\n\n4\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nand Cassius Dio illustrate this. In the ﬁfth book of his Roman history Livy inserts a speech (5.51–4) in which the early Roman statesman M. Furius Camillus argues against a proposal for settlement in Veii and recalls how he—during his exile—had longed for his patria (5.54.3–4). The passage so closely resembles passages in letters written by Cicero during the time of his proconsulship in Cilicia15 that Ogilvie (ad loc.) has rightly concluded that Livy has taken Cicero as the model for Camillus’ speech. Some 200 years after Livy, Cassius Dio treats Cicero’s exile in his Roman history and invents a dialogue in which some ﬁctitious Philiscus tries to console the Roman statesman and persuade him that there is no reason for lamenting his banishment in a “womanish fashion”.16 The dialogue “appears [my emphasis] to refute Ad Atticum 3.15” (Claassen (1999a) 86), although Cassius Dio may not have had Ad Atticum 3.15 before him and may have merely drawn from an ancient tradition of philosophical consolations on exile.17 Both the distinction between different grammatical persons and the category of ‘exile literature’ in the sense of ‘literature written by exiles’ would not be very helpful in describing the relation between Cicero and the historians Livy and Cassius Dio, and, what is worse, they would blind us to the fact that the philosophical consolations on exile, which go back to the Cynic philosopher Teles ( ﬂ. c. 235 BC), already provide all the counterarguments with which Dio’s ﬁctitious Philiscus can ‘reply’ to a letter written by Cicero in Sept. 58 BC—regardless of whether Dio actually knew Cicero’s correspondence from exile or not. The example shows that, obviously, there was a tradition of typical complaints about and consolations for exile which was available to Cicero, Livy, and Cassius Dio and which they could put either into their characters’ mouth or into their own. This last point immediately questions also the psychological framework applied by Doblhofer and, to a lesser extent, by Claassen: if there is a tradition of typical complaints about and consolations for exile one 15 On this proconsulship being a sort of ‘second exile’ for Cicero see n. 74 below; Ogilvie compares Fam. 2.11.1, 2.12.2, 2.13.3; another parallel is Att. 5.15.1 (also written during Cicero’s proconsulship in Cilicia (51 BC)): lucem, forum, urbem, domum, vos desidero. 16 Cf. Dio Cass. 38.18–29 (the quote is from 38.18.1); the passage has been treated in greater detail by Claassen (1996a). 17 Claassen (1999a) 269 n. 74 leaves the question of Dio’s sources open; the medical imagery in 38.18.5, 38.19.1–2 (cf. nn. 64–5 below), the use of historical exempla in 38.26.3, 38.27.3, and the suggestion that Cicero should become a historiographer, which has a close parallel in Plutarch’s consolation on exile (Plut. De Exil. 605C–D, cf. n. 48 below) all show that Dio is heavily inﬂuenced by the consolatory tradition.\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n5\n\ncannot assume a direct and simple relation between the psychological condition of exile and the literature written by exiles, but one has to take into account that (a) authors may perceive and present their experience of exile according to pre-existing literary and cultural paradigms,18 that (b) they may merely style themselves or others as (typical) exiles,19 and that (c) being an exile obviously presupposes that the banished person accepts the role of an exile imposed by circumstances.20 Moreover, the typical features of exile literature collected by Doblhofer—e.g. the motifs of the exile’s closeness to death,21 his self-heroization,22 his fear of losing the command of his mother tongue23—are either so general that they also apply to numerous other categories of literature24 or they are not so much characteristics of a genre or mode as a set of motifs or themes that is best called a ‘rhetoric’ or ‘discourse’ of exile.25 The most problematic point of Doblhofer’s and Claassen’s approach to the ancient discourse on exile is, however, its circular nature. When Anna Seghers, during her exile from Germany, writes a poem called “Der Baum des Odysseus” and fantasizes about Odysseus’ returning to Ithaca and slaying the suitors, she obviously expresses her hope for the fall of the Nazi tyranny through the paradigm of the Odysseus myth, which had already been a secundum comparationis for countless exiles before her;26 when Thomas Mann states “Wo ich bin, ist die Deutsche 18 On paradigms shaping perception and manipulating memories see Welzer (2002) 171 and e.g. the studies by Goffman (1981) and Bourke (1999) 16 ff. Of course, the inﬂuence of cultural paradigms on the presentation of personal experience has been stressed not only by sociologists but also in narratological studies, cf. e.g. Chamberlain/ Thompson (1998) 3, Erll/Roggendorf (2002) 104 (with further literature). Doblhofer (1987) 259 (with examples and literature) observes that modern historical novels written by exiles often feature “das Sich-Wiedererkennen in anderen Zeiten und Personen” and that the same is true of Seneca’s catalogue of foundation myths in Helv. 7. 19 Cf. e.g. Whitmarsh (2001a) on Musonius’, Dio’s, and Favorinus’ self-fashioning as exiled philosophers, Hexter pp. 221–2 and 230 below, and the further examples given on pp. 10–11 and 17–18. 20 Cf. n. 45 for two anecdotes in which the Greek philosophers Anaxagoras and Diogenes ostentatiously reject this role. 21 Cf. Doblhofer (1987) 69. 22 Cf. Doblhofer (1987) 67 and 69, Claassen (1999a) 104 (“self-dramatisation”), and Brodsky (1995) 24, Said (2000) 181. 23 Cf. Doblhofer (1987) 68 and Brodsky (1995) 30. 24 E.g. some form of self-heroization or self-dramatization can be encountered in any ﬁrst-person ﬁction; something similar applies to Doblhofer’s emphasis ((1987) 215–21) on hate and invective as typically exilic features. 25 This terminology obviously also resolves the problems inherent in Claassen’s categorization by narrative form. 26 See Desideri, p. 195 n. 12 below, and cf. Grimm (2003) for this and other examples of Odysseus as a paradigm in the works of twentieth century German exiles.\n\n6\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nKultur”,27 he, too, is the exponent of a tradition that goes back to Cicero and before,28 and the same applies, of course, also to Brecht when he explains that for his Gedichte im Exil of 1943 he has chosen only those poems that were written “in einer Art ‘Basic German’ ” and that other poems which seemed too “reich” were excluded.29 Doblhofer and others have taken the systematization of the topoi of the modern exile literature as a starting point for understanding the literature written by the exiles of antiquity, without reﬂecting that the modern authors have inherited these topoi from the ancient discourse on exile. No psychological paradigms are needed to explain that authors like Cicero or Ovid, who have had an immense direct and indirect inﬂuence on medieval and modern literature, share many topoi with those that stand at our end of the western tradition. To understand ancient discourse on exile one does not have to resort to psychological concepts and typologies of modern exile literature; rather, one has to go back to the ﬁrst literary treatments of exile and displacement and even beyond that. In view of the difﬁculties inherent in the deﬁnition of ‘exile’ in antiquity and in view of the close interaction between a whole variety of narrative, historiographical, philosophical, political, rhetorical, or just personal treatments of exile and displacement in classical literature, the contributions in the present volume adopt a fairly broad deﬁnition of exile and are organized chronologically rather than thematically. Instead of focusing on the ‘exulum trias’ Cicero, Ovid, and Seneca—though they, too, are treated (cf. Cohen, Gaertner, and Fantham below)— the present volume aims at emphasizing the importance of the so far often neglected discourse on exile in early Greek epic and lyric poetry (Bowie), Greek historiography (Dillery), Cynicism (Branham), philosophical consolations on exile (Nesselrath), Latin epic (Harrison), Greek literature of the empire (Desideri), and in the Middle Ages (Hexter). The difference in approach and scope between the studies by Doblhofer and Claassen and the present volume leads to a rather different picture of ancient discourse on exile (see especially pp. 15–16 below). Although the individual papers mutually interact and refer the reader to the treatment of precedents or reception in other contributions to the volume, readers may ﬁnd the following sketch of the historical development 27\n\nCf. Koopmann (1981), cited by Doblhofer (1987) 241. Cf. Cic. Red. Pop. 14, Red. Sen. 34, Dom. 137, 141, Pub. Sent. u.33: ubi innocens damnatur, pars patriae exsulat and Doblhofer (1987) 241, 247, Narducci (1997) 66–7. 29 Cf. Zimmermann (2003) 32 (with further literature) and see pp. 156 ff. below. 28\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n7\n\nof ancient discourse on exile a helpful orientation. At the same time this sketch may also provide some orientation on authors and subjects that—given the vast topic—could not be treated in detail in the present volume (e.g. the Greek tragedians, Musonius, or Boethius). Already in early historical accounts of the Near East, exile and displacement play a key role in explaining the foundation of new states: thus the dynasty of Akkade is reported to have been founded by Sargon (2340–2284 BC), who was allegedly exposed in a basket on the Euphrates and travelled downstream until he was found by the water bearer Aqqi.30 Later the very same motif is central to Greek foundation myths.31 With the remarkable exception of the Athenians, who claimed autochthony,32 most ancient Greek city states (not to mention their numerous colonies) explained their coming into being by myths of exile or displacement: Thebes was allegedly founded by Cadmus, who had been told by his father to ﬁnd his sister or go into exile;33 the foundation of Sparta was commonly linked with the return of the sons of Heracles;34 the inhabitants of several Greek cities in Asia minor, namely of Ephesus,35 claimed descent from Ionian immigrants allegedly led by Androclus, and most famously Rome, in particular the Roman family of the Iulii, claimed descent from Trojan refugees under Aeneas.36 While accounts such as these are closely connected with the fashioning of local identities and questions of political prestige and propaganda,37 30 On the story, which, of course, closely resembles that of Moses in the Bible, cf. Cooper/Heimpel (1983), Westenholz (1997). On the inﬂuence of Near Eastern narratives on Greek literature see e.g. West (1966) 31, (1997) passim (especially pp. 439–40 on the Sargon legend), and Burkert (1992). 31 See Bowie, pp. 22–3 below and cf. Doblhofer (1987) 199, Harrison pp. 129 ff. below on the closely related Roman tradition. 32 Cf. Eur. fr. 360.8 (Kannicht): ƣȸƵɝƸƪưƮƧƳ Ʀń ȄƷƶvƧƮ and Parker (1987), Rosivach (1987). 33 Cf.

FGrHist 3 F 155, Ephorus FGrHist 70 F 126, Paus. 7.2.6. 36 The ﬁrst attestation of this legend is Hellanicus FGrHist 4 F 84; cf. also Hergesianax Alex. FGrHist 45 F 7–10, Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1.73, Sal. Cat. 6. Similarly, the cities Aeneadae (cf. Verg. A. 3.12), Aeneia (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1.47,48), Aphrodisias and Etis (cf. Paus. 3.22.11), Capyae (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1.49), Elyma and Aegesta (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1.52) as well as Lavinium (cf. Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 1.56,57) were allegedly founded by Aeneas; cf. Roscher s.v. ‘Aineias’ 167–82, Wörner (1882). 37 A good example is the myth of the foundation of Phaselis by Lacius, who had allegedly been banished by Mopsus and Manto: “Die Gründung der Stadt Phaselis\n\n8\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nthere is—from fairly early times—also a more literary use of the theme: early, oral narratives of return such as the Usbek epic Alpamysh, the oral antecedents that one may reconstruct for the Odyssey, and the epic of Gilgamesh exploit the natural pathos inherent in the separation of a hero from his home and the conﬂict with new surroundings;38 the same motif also surfaces in the Iliad, where the prowess of valorous men such as Achilles is contrasted with their longing for home.39 In these accounts characters long for their native land or city, for members of their family or for their possessions, but exile is not yet presented as an extreme deprivation sui generis, nor is there a developed rhetoric of exile.40 Such a rhetoric only develops with the rise of lyric poetry and its shift of focus from myths of the past towards the persona of the poet and his or her experience.41 Whereas Archilochus’ and Semonides’ exile and their literary treatment of it are difﬁcult to reconstruct, Xenophanes (fr. 3 West) may offer a ﬁrst certain example\n\nsollte in mythische Zeit hochdatiert, also eine echte Kolonie mit einer mythischen Urgeschichte ausgestattet werden” (Prinz (1979) 29 with Philostephanus FHG 3.29.1 = Ath. 7.51 p. 297F–298A; cf. Prinz (1979) passim for further examples and literature). Of course, also the reverse may have occurred and such foundation myths may have inﬂuenced the political agenda: according to Pausanias (1.12.1) Pyrrhus’ decision to wage war against Rome was partly prompted by the consideration that Rome was a foundation of Trojan refugees and he himself a descendant of Troy’s enemy Achilles; later, according to Just. 28.1.6, one of the justiﬁcations put forth by Roman envoys for Rome’s support of the Acarnanians against the Aetolians was that they soli quondam adversus Troianos, auctores originis suae, auxilia Graecis non miserint. 38 On the motif of return in the Usbek epic Alpamysh and similar narratives from the Balkans see Zhirmunsky (1966) 281–3, Mirzaev (1983) 81, Reichl (2001) 41–9, Lord (1991) 211–44; on pre-literary precedents for this motif in the Odyssey see Radermacher (1915) 51, Hölscher (1989) 32–4 and 51–2, Hansen (2002) 201–11. Whitmarsh (2001a) 280–1 rightly draws attention to the fact that in these stories (cf. imprimis Od. 1.1–3) also “the notion that travel generates wisdom is latent [my emphasis]” and compares the link of displacement and transition to adulthood in the myths of Jason (cf. Segal (1986) 56–60, Moreau (1994a) 117–42), Orestes (cf. Zeitlin (1978) 160–74), Telemachus (cf. Alden (1987) 134, Moreau (1992)), and Odysseus (cf. Moreau (1994b)). Cf. West (1997) 403–4 on the explicit link of travel and wisdom in the epic of Gilgamesh, and Comito (1975) and Whitmarsh (1999) on the “spacialization of the soul’s adventures” (Comito, p. 74) in the ancient novels. 39 Cf. also the tales of displacement of Phoenix (Il. 9.448–80) and Patroclus (Il. 23.83 ff.) and see Bowie, pp. 25–6 below; cf. also Schlunk (1976) on suppliant-exiles in the Iliad and Montiglio (2000) 87. In a similar fashion exile and displacement are later exploited also in Latin epic (cf. Lieberg (1971), Harrison, pp. 129 ff. below) and in the ancient novel (Comito (1975))—both are clearly inﬂuenced by the tradition of Greek epic: cf. imprimis Juhnke (1972), Knauer (1979), and Holzberg (2001) 43–4 (on the Odyssey as the “Urform” of the ancient novel). 40 Cf. Bowie, p. 27 below. On the social history see Roisman (1982), (1984–6). 41 Cf. Fränkel (1993) 148, Snell (1993) 56 ff. on the history of ideas.\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n9\n\nof nostalgia in his poem on his home town Colophon, Solon’s ȠƣvƤưƳ on compatriots sold into slavery abroad (fr. 36 West) draws attention to the condition of linguistic and cultural isolation, and Alcaeus and Theognis not only lament “the toils of vexatious exile” (cf. Alc. fr. 129.11–12 (Campbell): ƵːƮƦƧ vɝƸƪƺƮ ǰƲƥƣƭɗƣƳ ƵƧ ƷɟƥƣƳ) and the loss of their property but also establish the imagery of ‘exile as shipwreck’, the motif of desertion and that of the exile’s wish for death.42 Thus, by the end of the sixth century BC we not only have an inventory of mythical exiles (e.g. Odysseus, Patroclus) and of exilic plots—suppliantexiles (e.g. Patroclus), wandering heroes (e.g. Odysseus, Jason), founderexiles (e.g. Cadmus)—but we also have a clear inventory of themes and motifs of exile (recollection of one’s patria, ‘exile as shipwreck’, wish for death, desertion, linguistic and cultural isolation). All of these elements later become central to the ancient perception and description of exile. The typical complaints of exile are not only taken up in Greek tragedy (most prominently in Euripides’ Phoenissae)43 and in the Attic orators, particularly Andocides,44 but they also provide the standard complaints to be refuted in the consolatory treatises on exile, and the ingredients for Cicero’s and Ovid’s letters from exile. Moreover, both the mythical exiles and their literary counterparts become the benchmark for exile in later authors: thus Odysseus, Jason, Cadmus, Tydeus, and Teucer are\n\n42 Cf.

Med. 643–51 and Schnayder (1957–8), Doblhofer (1987) 28–37, Bordaux (1992), Goldhill (2000) 12–16. Goldhill (2000) 12–16 accentuates that in tragedy (cf. e.g. Eur. Phoen. 388–93) the question of the exile’s (lack of) freedom of speech comes to the fore; the topic is later taken up in the consolatory tradition: see Doblhofer (1987) 48 and cf. pp. 16–17, 89, 97, 184 n. 36 below. Tzanetou (1997)—known to me only through the abstract in L’Année philologique—and Slatkin (1986) 217 analyse how the Greek tragedians exploit the theme of exile to explore and emphasize Athenian civic identity as a state granting refuge (cf. Isoc. Paneg. 51, 54 and see Grethlein (2003)). The evident links between tragedy and the later tradition of consolatory treatises on exile (cf. e.g. n. 55 on Eur. fr. 1047 Kannicht) seem not to have been studied systematically yet (but see Nesselrath pp. 90–1, 97 and Fantham pp. 174–5 in this volume). 44 Cf. imprimis Andoc. 1.5 (it is better to live in a patria that is in a bad state, than to live in exile), 2.9 (exile as the most wretched form of life), 2.10 (death is better than exile) and see Doblhofer (1987) 37 and imprimis Zimmermann (2003) 37–9 who emphasizes thematic similarities between Andocides’ and Cicero’s speeches after their return from exile. Some of the typical complaints of exile also feature in Isocrates (14.46–50, 19.23–7) and Demosthenes (57.70).\n\n10\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nlater standard exempla in philosophical consolations on exile, Plutarch (De Exil. 604C) quotes Archil. fr. 21 (West) in his consolatory treatise on exile as a parallel for his addressee’s refusal to see the advantages of his place of exile, and Favorinus (De Exil. 10.2) adduces Alcaeus as someone who, despite his great love for his home country (ǰƮɘƲ ƱƧƲɛ ƥƧ ƵɘƮ ƱƣƵƲɛƦƣ ƷƫƭưƴƵưƲƥɝƵƣƵưƳ), nevertheless coped successfully with the sorrows of exile. With the rise of Greek historiography, rhetoric, philosophy, and sciences in the ﬁfth and fourth centuries BC exile ceases to be merely the condition of physical and emotional hardship that it had been in epic and lyric poetry. Exile is seen as a relative concept that can be applied not only to states banishing individuals but also to individuals dissociating themselves from states,45 and two more intellectual concepts of exile come to the fore: exile as a condition that provokes a profound change of perspective and offers knowledge and greater insight, and exile as a political, social, even metaphysical metaphor.46 One of the ﬁrst exponents of the former concept is the Greek historian Thucydides, who famously claimed (5.26.5) that exile allowed him to view the Peloponnesian war with greater objectivity; another is the Cynic Diogenes who allegedly said that it was exile that made him a philosopher.47 The concept has had a wide following, and exile was soon recognized as an essential component of the experience of the historian48 45 According to Diogenes Laertius (2.10) the ﬁfth century philosopher Anaxagoras said that he had not been bereft of the Athenians, but they from him; the same idea is later expressed by the Cynic Diogenes, cf. Diog. Laert. 6.49: Ƭƣɚ ƱɕƭƫƮ ƧȜƱɝƮƵưƳ ƵƫƮɝƳ “ƕƫƮƺƱƧʴƳ ƴưƶ ƷƶƥɘƮ ƬƣƵɗƥƮƺƴƣƮ”, “Ȁƥɠ Ʀɗ ƥƧ”, ƧȢƱƧƮ, “ȀƬƧɛƮƺƮ vưƮəƮ”. See Branham, p. 76 below. 46 This revaluation of exile was, of course, partly prompted by the fact that many of the intellectuals of the time (cf. Brown (1988) on Herodotus, Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Empedocles, and others) were exiles. 47 Cf. Diog. Laert. 6.49: ƱƲɝƳ ƵƧ ƵɜƮ ȬƮƧƫƦɛƴƣƮƵƣ ƣȸƵˑ ƵɘƮ ƷƶƥəƮ, “ǰƭƭɔ ƵưɟƵưƶ ƥ’ ȅƮƧƬƧƮ”, ƧȢƱƧƮ, “Ɋ ƬƣƬɝƦƣƫvưƮ, ȀƷƫƭưƴɝƷƩƴƣ”. The concept that travel generates wisdom is, of course, already latent in the Odyssey and other narratives (see n. 38 above) and has further precedents in the extensive travelling of Hecataeus (cf. FGrHist 1 T 4 and T 12a: ǰƮɘƲ ƱưƭƶƱƭƣƮəƳ with Jacoby ad locc.), Herodotus, and various presocratic philosophers (e.g. Democritus and Pythagoras, cf. Democritus VS 68 B 299, Diod. Sic. 1.96.1–3; Diog. Laert. 8.1–2, 9.35–6, Cic. Tusc. 4.44 and Montiglio (2000) 88–9, KotziaPanteli (2002) 127). Cf. also Hdt. 1.30.2 and 4.76.1 where the wisdom of Solon and Anacharsis is connected with their travelling (see Montiglio (2000) 88–9 and Dillery p. 54 below). The ﬁgure of Anacharsis, who was an inﬂuential paradigm in Cynicism (Martin (1996), Montiglio (2000) 101–2), links the philosophical with the narrative/ historiographical tradition. 48 Cf. imprimis Plutarch’s consolatory treatise on exile, where Thucydides heads a list of historians who wrote in exile (De Exil. 605C–D). The concept also features in the\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n11\n\nand that of the philosopher.49 The number of historians writing in exile is considerable and may have been artiﬁcially augmented by the fabrication of improbable and confusing tales of some historians’ exiles;50 others, such as the Roman exile Rutilius Rufus, may have been inspired by these precedents to compose their own historiographical works— which, of course, also offered a welcome opportunity of presenting one’s life, particularly the circumstances leading to the banishment, in a more favourable light.51 Cases of ancient exiles styling themselves as philosophers, too, are readily at hand: the most prominent and striking examples are that of the later emperor Tiberius fashioning himself as a philosopher during the time of his self-imposed Rhodian exile,52 and that of the philosophical conversion of Dio Chrysostom.53 For the Cynic Diogenes, however, exile was not only related to a different perspective on the world, but also to a different way of life. Whereas social identity was traditionally connected with man’s place in society and exile was seen as proximate to social death,54 the Cynics begin to employ exile positively. They fuse it with the concept of cosmopolitanism55 and integrate it into their appeal to the norms of the consolatory speech of ‘Philiscus’ at Dio Cass. 38.28.1–2; it has been taken up by Syme (1962) 40: “exile may be the making of an historian. That is patent for Herodotus and for Polybius” and Hornblower (1987) 27; cf. the detailed discussion of the matter by Dillery, pp. 51 ff. below. 49 Cf. e.g. Cic. Tusc. 5.108, Plut. De Exil. 604D–605B, Tert. Nat. 2.14.4, André/Baslez (1993) 293–8, Whitmarsh (2001a) 281, and p. 17 below. 50 Cf. Dillery, pp. 62 ff. below. One may compare the legendary exile of Juvenal, on which see Syme (1979). 51 Cf. Münzer (1914) 1280, Amiotti (1991) on Rutilius’ self-presentation in his exilic works. The apologetic function and the autobiographic aspect have been emphasized by Zimmermann (2002), (2003) 35 who interprets Thucydides’ and Xenophon’s historiographical works and Andocides’ speeches after his return from exile as the origin of autobiography. However, a glance at the proportions of the apologetic/ autobiographical passages within Thucydides’ historiographical oeuvre (see Dillery, pp. 59, 68 below) or a look into Misch’s monumental work on the history of autobiography (cf. imprimis (1949) 22 ff. on the various antecedents (funeral inscriptions, ‘Tatenberichte’, ﬁrst-person accounts in poetry and fairy tales)) shows that this is implausible. 52 Cf. Suet. Tib. 13: equi quoque et armorum solitas exercitationes omisit redegitque se deposito patrio habitu ad pallium et crepidas atque in tali statu biennio fere permansit, contemptior in dies et invisior and Doblhofer (1987) 186. 53 See p. 17 below. Cf. also Sen. Helv. 9.4 on Marcellus’ devotion to the bonae artes, Cohen p. 125 with Cic. Fam. 9.18.1 on Dionysius II of Syracuse, and Fantham p. 184 on Seneca the Younger. 54 Cf. Arist. Pol. 1253a1–4, cited by Whitmarsh (2001a) 271; Doblhofer (1987) 21–40 has collected further material. Cf. also Montiglio (2000) 92–8 on Plato’s venomous attacks against the elusive and over-ambitious ƥɗƮưƳ . . . ƱƭƣƮƩƵɝƮ (Ti. 19E) of the Sophists and on his view that the true philosopher leads a stable and immobile life. 55 On the concept of cosmopolitanism cf. Baldry (1965), Stanton (1968), Rutherford\n\n12\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nuniverse and the rejection of the norms and conventions of society.56 Thus, exile becomes a metaphor for social, political, and even metaphysical dissociation. As such it had already been used negatively in the ﬁfth century by Empedocles, who seems to have been the ﬁrst to develop the notion of a metaphysical patria by calling life on earth exile from heaven.57 Empedocles’ thought has been inﬂuential in the realm of metaphysical thinking—partly, but not exclusively, because the same idea later prominently features in one of the most important texts for the Middle Ages, the letters of the apostles Paul and Peter in the New Testament.58 Whether or not the apostles are indirectly inﬂuenced by Empedocles (via currents of popular philosophy) cannot be determined,59 nor can we be certain of the exact relation between the Empedoclean metaphysical concept and the Cynics’ use of exile to describe social and political dissociation. With Cynicism we have reached the fourth century BC and a decisive moment in the ancient discourse on exile. By this time all major motifs of the later discourse on exile have been introduced, and what follows is primarily a process of recombination and adaptation of these motifs and concepts and of fusing them with other schools of thought and with various literary genres. The ﬁrst palmary case is the reversal of the Cynic concept of exile by the Stoics, who adopt the concept of cosmopolitanism but completely redeﬁne the relation between state and individual by saying that the wise man does not stand outside society but is a citizen, and that it is the foolish man who is an exile.60 A second\n\n(1989) 239–40 n. 40, Schoﬁeld (1991) 57–92, Moles (1996), Whitmarsh (2001a) 279–80; the concept is prepared in the Euripidean line ǵƱƣƴƣ Ʀɖ ƸƪɠƮ ǰƮƦƲɚ ƥƧƮƮƣɛˎ ƱƣƵƲɛƳ (Eur. fr. 1047 (Kannicht) ~ Ov.

That typical plots, characters, and motifs of the Greek exilic discourse enter into Latin literature as part of a much more general process of imitation and adaptation of Greek models is unsurprising for the genres of epic, tragedy, and comedy: the foundation myth of Rome by the fugitive Aeneas—ﬁrst mentioned by Hellanicus (cf. n. 36 above)—is treated already by Naevius and Ennius,66 and later the theme of exile plays a central role not only in Vergil’s Aeneid but also in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Lucan’s Bellum Civile, Silius’ Punica, Valerius Flaccus’ Argonautica, and Statius’ Thebaid;67 the early Roman tragedians—particularly Ennius in his Medea and Telamo as well as Pacuvius in his Teucer and later Seneca in his Phoenissae—inherit the theme of exile from their Greek predecessors,68 61\n\nCf. Nesselrath’s discussion, pp. 87 ff. below and Swain (1989) 156 (on Favorinus). For the Cynic Diogenes as an exemplary exile cf. e.g. Plut. De Exil. 602A, ‘Philiscus’ at Dio Cass. 38.25.2, Favorinus De Exil. 14.51 ff. and see p. 17 below on Musonius’ selffashioning as a Cynic philosopher. Cadmus and Themistocles are cited in the treatise by Teles, probably the ﬁrst of its kind (third cent. BC), cf. Teles pp. 22.14 and 28.4 (Hense). Particularly the later treatises by Plutarch and Favorinus offer a much larger inventory of exemplary exiles, see Nesselrath, pp. 92 ff. below. 63 Cf. the detailed discussion by Nesselrath, pp. 87 ff. below. 64 Cf. e.g. Kudlien (1962) 113 n. 3 and Wehrli (1951) on the earlier tradition of this imagery; Wilhelm (1926) amply illustrates the medical imagery of the consolatory tradition in his discussion of Ov. Pont. 1.3. See also Fantham, p. 178 n. 17 below. 65 The motif is prominent in Cicero, Ovid, and many modern authors, cf. the rich material in Doblhofer (1987) 59 ff. and e.g. Wilhelm (1926) on Ov.

Skalitzky (1973)) and his treatment of Teucer’s (Carm. 1.7) and Europa’s (Carm. 3.27) displacement, and Vergil’s ﬁrst Eclogue.71 More controversial is the place of Cicero and Ovid in the history of ancient discourse on exile. Claassen ((1999a) 27) has interpreted Cicero “as the unconscious creator of the autobiographical genre ‘complaints from exile’” and has credited Ovid with the “creation of the literary genre of exilic poetry” ((1999a) 241). However, Cicero and Ovid are not only preceded by the quasi-epistolary72 poems in which Alcaeus laments his situation in exile (see above), but their treatment of exile is simply unthinkable without the earlier Greek tradition on exile.73 Cicero’s letters written during his exile and his proconsulate in Cilicia74 as well as Ovid’s Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto rehearse the rhetoric of exile that had been gradually developing in the Greek lyric poets: the exile’s wish for death, the motif of desertion, the nostalgic recollection of the patria, the imagery of shipwreck—all this had already featured in the poems of Alcaeus, Theognis, and Solon, in Euripides’ Phoenissae and in the consolatory tradition (see p. 9 above). Furthermore, Cicero’s speeches after his return from exile had a model in Andocides’ speeches De Mysteriis and De Reditu,75 and the mythologizing self-dramatization of exile in Cicero’s De Temporibus Suis76 and Ovid’s Tristia and Epistulae 69 Cf. Zagagi (1988) on Menander’s Samia 616 ff. as well as Plautus’ Cistellaria 284 ff. and Mercator 644 ff., 830 ff. Cf. also Ter.

Ecl. 1.1–5,59–66; Vergil’s lines may be inspired by the loss of his family’s possessions near Mantua (cf. Doblhofer (1987) 77–80, 180–1), but Segal (1965) and Somville (1982) have rightly advocated a literary rather than biographical interpretation. Cf. also Doblhofer (1987) 58 and 76 on Verg. G. 2.503–12, [ Verg.] Cat. 3.7–10. 72 Thus Zimmermann (2003) 42, following Rösler (1980) 273–4. 73 I am leaving aside here the methodological objections against exile as a literary genre, see pp. 2–6 above. The most recent in depth study of Cicero’s letters from exile— Garcea (2005)—completely ignores the Greek tradition. 74 Herescu (1959) rightly speaks of three exiles, Cicero’s real exile in 58/57 BC, his proconsulate in Cilicia in 51/50 BC, and his inner exile under Caesar’s dictatorship. On these exiles and their presentation in Cicero’s works cf. Claassen (1992), Robinson (1993), Cohen pp. 109 ff. below, and the literature given in the following notes. 75 Cf. Zimmermann (2003) 37 and n. 44 above. 76 For the “glorious mythological colour” (Claassen (1999a) 209) of Cicero’s treatment\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n15\n\nex Ponto77 reﬂects literary traditions with which these authors were acquainted from early youth: mythical heroes were commonly used as paradigms in ancient education78 and rhetoric79 and thus provided the natural yardstick not only for the perception and evaluation of personal suffering and conduct but also for their literary presentation.80 The indebtedness of Cicero and Ovid to their predecessors becomes, however, most noticeable in their reﬂection of the Greek philosophical discourse on exile. In a letter written during his time of exile (Att. 3.15) Cicero reverses the typical arguments of consolatory treatises,81 and the same is later done by Ovid in Pont. 1.3.82 Moreover, in the speeches, letters, and treatises written after his return to Rome, Cicero takes up the use of exile as a metaphor, which he had found in Greek, particularly Stoic, philosophy: based on an abstract concept of patria and exilium, Cicero on the one hand argues that he had never been in exile because the legitimate government, the res publica, had gone into exile with him or had ceased to exist with his departure;83 on the other hand he develops a notion of ‘innere Emigration’ to describe not only his disempowerment\n\nof his own exile in De Temporibus Suis cf. the ironic allusion in [Sal.] Cic. 7: sed quid ego plura de tua insolentia commemorem? quem Minerva omnis artis edocuit, Iuppiter Optimus Maximus in concilio deorum admisit, Italia exulem humeris suis reportavit. oro te, Romule Arpinas, qui egregia tua virtute omnis Paulos, Fabios, Scipiones superasti, quem tandem locum in hac civitate obtines? and see Büchner (1939) 1251, Harrison (1990), who plausibly conjecture that Cicero’s work even included a consilium deorum, at which Cicero’s return to Rome was discussed. 77 Cf. e.g. Doblhofer (1987) 273 ff., Chwalek (1996), Claassen (1999a) 71–2 and passim, and p. 159 below. 78 Cf. Marrou (1956) 12–13, 235, Bonner (1977) 283, and e.g. Quint. Inst. 12.11.22: tot exemplis nos instruxit antiquitas, ut possit videri nulla sorte nascendi aetas felicior quam nostra, cui docendae priores elaborarunt. 79 Cf. Arist. Rh. 2.20, Rhet. Her. 3.9, Cic. De Orat. 1.18; the use of paradeigmata is already prominent in the Iliad, cf. Austin (1966) 300 ff. (with further literature). 80 Tragedies such as Pacuvius’ Teucer, which seems to have been a standard element in Roman schooling in Cicero’s day (cf. De Orat. 1.246 and Ribbeck (1875) 223), too, may have had a strong inﬂuence and seem to have been imbued with the Greek rhetoric of exile: cf. the anonymous line patria est, ubicumque est bene (Inc. trag. 92 = Cic. Tusc. 5.108), which Ribbeck (1875) 231 has drawn into his interpretation of Pacuvius’ Teucer and which has a close Greek precedent at Ar. Plut. 1151: ƱƣƵƲɚƳ ƥɕƲ ȀƴƵƫ Ʊʗƴʞ ȡƮʞ ǲƮ ƱƲɕƵƵʤ ƵƫƳ ƧȾ. 81 Cf. Claassen (1999a) 84. Cicero stresses the availability of consolatory treatises in Tusc. 3.81 and later reviews the arguments in Tusc. 5.106–9. See also Cohen, p. 120 n. 28 below. 82 Cf. Wilhelm (1926), Davisson (1983), and p. 157 below. 83 Cf. Doblhofer (1987) 247–8, Narducci (1997), Cohen pp. 111 ff. below, and n. 60 above (Stoic precedents). Given the currency of the notion one might speak of Popularstoizismus, cf. e.g. Pub. Sent. u.33: ubi innocens damnatur, pars patriae exsulat, Cic. Mil. 101: exsilium ibi esse putat [sc. Milo] ubi virtuti non sit locus, Sen. Ben. 6.37.\n\n16\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nand dissociation from Caesar’s dictatorship, but also his attachment to the legitimate government of the res publica before Caesar’s dictatorship.84 Hence, measured against their Greek predecessors, Cicero and Ovid seem far less innovative than Claassen suggests. Their main innovation lies in the adaptation of the earlier tradition to the cultural, political, and literary context of their times. Cicero, Ovid, and later Seneca add typically Roman characters to the inherited inventory of exemplary exiles (e.g. Aeneas, Marius, Rutilius Rufus, Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, Claudius Marcellus),85 and Ovid blends the rhetoric of exile with the conventions of Roman love elegy.86 A third modiﬁcation of the Greek tradition concerns freedom of speech. Whereas most earlier exiles could vent their anger against their political opponents freely because they were out of their reach, exiles under the principate faced the problem that—whether in Tomis or on Corsica—they were still under the rule of the authorities that had banished them.87 Wishing to return, they had to plead their case without accusing the emperor of having banished them unjustly. This has lead to the highly ambivalent discourse of imperial ira 84 See Cohen, pp. 121 ff. below and Herescu (1959), Doblhofer (1987) 231–41 (with copious material on the notion of ‘innere Emigration’ in modern literature). The term ‘innere Emigration’ seems to have been coined by Frank Thiess, see Cohen, p. 128 below. 85 Cicero markedly refers to Marius’ exile in the speeches he held after his own return from exile (cf. Red. Pop. 7, Red. Sen. 38); a separate poem on Marius’ exile may belong to the same period (see Büchner (1939) 1255). For Rutilius Rufus as an exemplary exile cf. Ov. Pont. 1.3.63–6, Sen. Dial. 1.3.7, Ben. 6.37, Ep. 79.14, for Metellus Numidicus cf. Cic. Red. Sen. 25, for Claudius Marcellus see Sen. Helv. 9.4. On Aeneas as an exemplary exile cf. e.g. Huskey (2002) on Ov. Tr. 1.3, Klodt (1996) on Ov. Tr. 1.4, and Sen. Helv. 7.6–7, where Seneca gives a catalogue of exiles founding Italian cities (cf. also Favorinus De Exil. 26.4). The Roman exempla added by Cicero, Ovid, and Seneca testify to the strong inﬂuence of Vergil’s Aeneid (itself obviously inﬂuenced by the Homeric epics (cf. n. 39 above) and the tradition of foundation myths that were popular among Hellenistic and Augustan poets (cf. Cairns (1979) 69 ff., Harrison pp. 129–34 below)) and Roman history and historiography (including, of course, the works of the exiled Rutilius Rufus, cf. n. 51 above). 86 See p. 160 below. Cf. also Fantham pp. 176 ff. on Seneca’s fusion of exilic topoi with the tradition of consolations on bereavement. 87 Worth mentioning in this context is the case of Cassius Severus, who was ﬁrst exiled to Crete in AD 8, but continued to be a “nuisance” (Syme (1939) 487) and was therefore banished to the barren rock Seriphus in AD 24 (Tac. Ann. 4.21). Already the Greek tragedians (cf. n. 43 above) had drawn attention to the exile’s (lack of) freedom of speech. Goldhill (2000) 16 ignores the historical circumstances when he says that Cicero and Ovid possessed more parrhesia than the earlier Greek exiles. Cicero and the imperial authors Seneca and Dio Chrysostom were fully aware that the condition of exiles was much more difﬁcult in an oikoumene that had become one political entity: see Cohen p. 122 on Cic. Fam. 4.7.4, Fantham pp. 175–6, 183–4, and Desideri pp. 198–9 on Dio Chrys. Or. 1.14.\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n17\n\nand clementia in Ovid,88 and plays a key role in the works Seneca wrote during the time of his banishment on Corsica: to avoid accusing the emperor Claudius of injustice or of having been misled in his judgement, Seneca clads his own self-consolation with consolations on bereavement to his mother Helvia and to Polybius (Claudius’ secretary a studiis) and makes extensive use of the ﬁgure of apostrophe, which enables him to put into the mouth of other persons what he himself cannot say.89 Both in the works written during his exile on Corsica and in the tragedies, written after his return to Rome, Seneca not only rationalizes or omits the sorrows of exile,90 but also presents exile as desirable and as a state becoming the sapiens.91 The latter concept—exile, i.e. the removal from the centre of power, making possible the life of a philosopher—also plays a role in Seneca’s contemporary Musonius and in Musonius’ pupil Dio Chrysostom.92 Both are deeply inﬂuenced by the Cynic tradition93 and consequently link exile with the typically Cynic concepts of eleutheria and parrhesia. However, this is not all, for exile also becomes part of their strategy of fashioning themselves as Greek philosophers and establishing themselves as part of a Greek literary tradition,94 and at least in Dio, exile also raises a central political issue, namely that of the nature and limits of imperial power and of the relation between Greek intellectuals and the Roman emperors.95 As in Musonius’ and Dio’s works, exile also plays a role in Favorinus’ self-fashioning. Taking up the tradition of consolatory treatises on exile in his own work De Exilio and introducing—like Cicero, Ovid, and Seneca before him (cf. n. 85 above)—new Roman, but also new Greek, exempla to the inherited inventory of Greek exempla,96 Favorinus fashions a less 88\n\nCf. e.g. Gaertner (2005) 9–12.

Phoen. 388–405) and 176–84 (on Helv.). An exception are Seneca’s remarks in Polyb. 2.1 and 18.9 (see Fantham pp. 184–5 and 191 below). 91 Cf. Mader (1993), Lo Piccolo (1998) on the tragedies, and Fantham p. 184 below on Helv. 20. 92 Apart from Musonius and Dio Chrysostom the concept also plays a central role in Plutarch’s De Exilio, see Nesselrath, pp. 94–5. 93 Cf.

In Pont. 3.1.49–56 Ovid inserts his own case into a catalogue of mythical heroes who have gained lasting fame because of their immense suffering: exposuit memet populo Fortuna videndum et plus notitiae quam fuit ante dedit. notior est factus Capaneus a fulminis ictu, notus humo mersis Amphiaraus equis. si minus errasset, notus minus esset Ulixes, magna Philoctetae vulnere fama suo est. 55 si locus est aliquis tanta inter nomina parvis, nos quoque conspicuos nostra ruina facit. 50\n\nFortune has set me forth to be seen by all the people and she has given me more celebrity than I had before. Capaneus was made more famous by the stroke of lightning; Amphiaraus is known because his horses were swallowed up by the earth. If Ulysses had wandered less, he would be less famous; great is the fame of Philoctetes because of his wound. If there is a place for small names among so great ones, me, too, my downfall has rendered famous.\n\nWhether or not Ovid’s exile has indeed made him as famous as Odysseus or Philoctetes in Augustan and Tiberian Rome cannot be determined with certainty. It is rendered probable, however, by the fact that Ovid soon becomes the standard exemplum of an exile in later Latin literature. The ﬁrst testimonies to this process are Seneca’s allusions to Ovid’s exile poetry,100 Statius’ tristis in ipsis / Naso Tomis (Silv. 1.2.254–5), the clustering of Ovidian exilic themes and diction in Statius’ treatment of Etruscus’\n\n97\n\nCf. Nesselrath, p. 108 below. See Nesselrath, p. 100 below on Favorinus’ sex; Whitmarsh (2001a) 303 stresses Favorinus’ hybridity as a “Roman Gaul writing Greek”. 99 Cf. Whitmarsh (2001a) 303 and Goldhill (2000) 18 with Philostr. VA 1.34 (1.35, p. 44): ƴưƷˑ ǰƮƦƲɚ ˘ƈƭƭɔƳ ƱɕƮƵƣ Ƭƣɚ ưȸƦɖƮ ȄƲƩvưƮ Ȏ ƤɕƲƤƣƲưƮ ƸƺƲɛưƮ. 100 Cf. e.g. Polyb. 18.9 ~ Ov. Tr. 3.14.33–6 with Fantham pp. 179 n. 19, 191 below and see Innocenti Pierini (1980), Gahan (1985). 98\n\nthe discourse of displacement\n\n19\n\nexile in Silv. 3.3.154–64,101 and Rutilius Namatianus’ evocation of Ovid’s poem on the departure from Rome (Tr. 1.3) in the description of his own departure from the city.102 Similarly but less prominently, Seneca becomes the protagonist of a garland of epigrams circulated under his name,103 and Cicero already features as an exemplum in Plutarch’s consolation on exile (De Exil. 605E).104 Thus, just as Cicero, Ovid, and Seneca presented their experience of exile through the paradigms of the earlier poetic, the philosophical, and the political discourse on exile, their own works and biographies soon become points of reference in treatments of (real or metaphorical) exile for later authors. This process becomes all the more noticeable during the Middle Ages. With the declining knowledge of Greek in the West and the rise of Christianity philosophical discourse on exile in Greek philosophy becomes less inﬂuential and is supplanted by the exilic paradigms of the new canonic texts, i.e. the Old and New Testament,105 and the mythical paradigms also become less important. The wanderings of Odysseus, Jason, Aeneas, Teucer, or Cadmus stand back and are replaced by the biographies of, or rather biographical speculation about, Latin authors.106 For Carolingian and later medieval poets Ovid’s letters from Tomis become the benchmark for displacement,107 and this tradition can\n\n101 Cf. Silv. 3.3.155–64: summe ducum . . . / tu . . . / . . . / . . . attonitum et venturi fulminis ictus / horrentem tonitru tantum lenique procella / contentus monuisse senem; . . . / . . . / . . . hic molles Campani litoris oras / et Diomedeas concedere iussus in arces, / atque hospes, non exsul, erat and e.g. Tr. 1.5.3: attonitum (~ Pont. 1.6.12), Tr. 4.5.5–6: veritus non es portus aperire ﬁdeles / fulmine percussae confugiumque rati, Pont. 1.2.59–60: cum subit, Augusti quae sit clementia, credo / mollia naufragiis litora posse dari, and see Tandoi (1962) 120 on Ovid’s use of fulmen for the ira Caesaris, and p. 158 below on the shipwreck imagery. 102 See Fo (1989), Tissol (2002), and cf. Doblhofer (1987) 81 on Goethe seeing his departure from Rome through Ov. Tr. 1.3. Cf. also Claassen (1999a) 244–51 on Ovid’s inﬂuence on Boethius. 103 Cf. Holzberg (2005). See also Dingel (1994) 350. 104 Cf. also Claassen (1999a) 54 on Plutarch’s biography of Cicero and see p. 4 above on Livy’s imitation of Cicero’s complaints in 5.54.3–4. 105 Cf. Hexter pp. 217 ff. below and Ladner (1967) on the medieval use of the idea of ‘exile from the divine’. The concept is of course prepared in the churchfathers, cf. e.g. Ferguson (1992) on Augustine. Nesselrath (pp. 98, 108 below, with further material) stresses that the presence of the idea in Plutarch’s treatise on exile (607C–E; cf. also Plotinus Enn. 1.6.8, adduced by Whitmarsh (2001a) 270) is typical of Late Antiquity. Cynic ideas, on the contrary, circulated mostly indirectly: cf. Matton (1996) 240. 106 Cf. Hexter pp. 212–14 ff. below. 107 Cf. Smolak (1980) 163 on Hildebert of Lavardin, and Hexter pp. 214 ff. below on Modoin, Ermoldus Nigellus, Walahfrid Strabo, and other medieval authors.\n\n20\n\njan felix gaertner\n\nbe traced right down to Horia’s Dieu est né en exil, Malouf ’s An Imaginary Life, Ransmayr’s Die letzte Welt, Coetzee’s Age of Iron, and Ted Hughes’ Tales from Ovid.108 These last observations on the inﬂuence of Ovid and the New Testament on the exilic discourse of the Middle Ages have shown that the treatment of exile depends not so much on personal experience as on literary, and more generally cultural, canons. The experience of the (real or metaphorical) exile of writers and ﬁctitious or historical characters is interpreted and presented within an inherited, but continuously modiﬁed, framework of concepts of displacement and wandering, which depends heavily on educational and intellectual traditions. Thus, ancient discourse on exile (and probably modern discourse, too) is primarily a representation of the history of ideas—not a genre or mode of its own. We are invited to speculate how medieval monks would have treated exile if they had read the chreiai about Diogenes and not the letters of Paul and Peter, or what contemporary intellectuals like Said might say about exile and homelessness if they had read less Nietzsche and Adorno and more Ovid.\n\n108 Cf. the collection of testimonies down to the year 1938 in Stroh (1969) as well as Ziolkowski (2005). See Hexter pp. 231–5 below on Petrarch, Smolak (1980) 172–3, 184 ff. on the humanists Scaliger, Dominique Baudier, and Burman as well as on East German poets, Innocenti Pierini (1990a) on Poliziano, Coppel (2001) on Lotichius, Katz (1992) on Coetzee. Monluçon (2002) discusses the novels of Horia, Malouf, and Ransmayr; she also refers to Mandelstam’s Tristia and mentions (p. 184) that the Austrian exile Broch hesitated between choosing Ovid or Vergil as the central ﬁgure for what later became Der Tod des Vergil. For further secondary literature on the modern reception of Ovid’s exilic works see Hexter, p. 210 n. 4 below.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nEARLY EXPATRIATES: DISPLACEMENT AND EXILE IN ARCHAIC POETRY Ewen L. Bowie The English term ‘exile’ and the romance languages’ ‘exil’, ‘esilio’, ‘exilio’ etc., all derive from the Latin word exilium. This Latin term, however, does not share the assumption of these modern terms that the individual who moves out of a community (the exul ) does so involuntarily, and that in more cases than not this departure is required or sanctioned by the community’s authorities or legal system. Ancient Greek terminology also observes different boundaries. The verb ƷƧɟƥƺ, ‘I go into exile’, also has the meaning ‘I ﬂee’ and ‘I run away from’, and in both senses the group or individual who ƷƧɟƥƧƫ may do so voluntarily or unwillingly, and the thing or person which prompts evasive or fugitive action need have no legal or authoritative backing. Hence, the ancient Greek discourse on exile cannot be considered in isolation from the similar discourses on other forms of displacement such as ﬂeeing, migrating and engaging (less than willingly) in travel.1 In the following discussion I look at the similarities and differences between exile and other more voluntary forms of displacement in the archaic period; I then discuss responses to exile in a poet whose ejection from his ƱɝƭƫƳ was unambiguously exilic, Alcaeus; and ﬁnally I assess some thoughts on exile that we ﬁnd in the corpus of early sympotic elegy ascribed to Theognis. Overall the responses to exile are fewer and less developed than one might perhaps have expected. Among the reasons for this is doubtless the sympotic performance-context of almost all this poetry. Some whingeing about one’s condition as an exile, or sniping at that of another symposiast, might not risk spoiling a symposion: but pursuing the topic at length could well impair a singer’s status as a welcome symposiast. And once poems about exile had been composed and sung, what proportion of them would be lucky enough to be reperformed and to join those poems that achieved written transmission? 1\n\nOn the ancient terminology see also pp. 2–3 above.\n\n22\n\newen l. bowie\n\nThe conditions of performance (corresponding to ‘publication’) and of diffusion and canonisation are utterly different from those in later periods when writing and books had replaced singing and oral transmission. So we should not be so surprised that neither quasi-self-indulgent nor philosophically interesting developments of a rhetoric of exile, each in different ways dependent on the habit of reading written texts, are to be found. Historical context The polis which constituted the immediate socio-economic context in which archaic Greeks, male and female, free and slave, lived their lives— by modern standards short and uncertain—was one of a huge diaspora that by the end of the seventh century stretched across the Mediterranean from Massilia (Marseille) to Cyprus, from Pontic Sinope and Trapezous to North African Cyrene. Although different poleis (and sometimes different groups within a single polis) often gave very different sorts of accounts of how they came to be just there, most such accounts involved displacement. 1. One major complex of displacements was associated with what modern archaeologists and historians term the Late Bronze Age. Three major population groups in the Peloponnese (Laconians, Messenians, Argives) constructed themselves as Dorians from northern Greece who had established themselves there in what for us is the twelfth cent. BC, in one version associating this with a ‘return’ led by the children of Heracles.2 Archaic Boeotians claimed to have taken over Boeotia about the same time.3 An explanation that satisfactorily explains both the distribution of Greek dialects (which largely supports this self-perception) and the archaeological evidence (which does not) has yet to be found.4 But for our purposes the truth is less important than what archaic communities believed. 2. Cities of western Asia Minor and its offshore islands saw themselves as colonists from mainland Greece, in some cases descendants of\n\n2 Cf. Tyrtaeus fr. 2.12–15 (West), Thuc. 1.12.3.

Many poleis claimed (very often correctly) to have been founded relatively recently by Greeks who for various reasons had left another Greek polis. The phenomenon that modern historians misleadingly call ‘colonisation’ began so soon after the ‘Ionian migration’ that it may be wrong to see it as wholly different.9 For ﬁfth century Greeks and for us it begins with settlements in the bay of Naples, Sicily and the Aegean in the mid-eighth cent. BC (Cumae c. 740 BC, Naxos traditionally 734 BC, Syracuse c. 734 BC), frequently preceded by trading visits and settlements (emporia) whose distinction from a ‘colony’ can be problematic.10 Within the Aegean itself many ‘colonies’ were sent, including those by Samos to Amorgos and by Paros to Thasos (early to mid-seventh cent. BC).11 Although to some extent many participants in such settlements may have gone keenly or willingly, ‘colonisation’ narratives suggest that in not a few cases they might have preferred to stay in the ‘mother’ city. Problems resulting from population-growth and land-shortage, from drought or other natural disasters, and competition for pre-eminence within the élite, could operate separately or together to drive individuals or a group to seek a new life elsewhere.12\n\n5\n\nCf. Loraux (1993) 184–236, Risch (1981) 269–89. Cf. Palmer (1980) 53 ff., Chadwick (1985) 3–12. 7 Cf. Hdt. 1.147.2 on the Apatouria, but note also the Thargelia, cf. Parke (1977), Simon (1983). 8 Cf. Loraux (1993) 184–236. 9 The most interesting recent work on ‘colonisation’ has been done by Malkin (1987), (1994), (1998) and Dougherty (1993). 10 The case of the settlement on Pithecoussae (modern Ischia) from which Cumae was founded is an obvious example: cf. Ridgway (1992), Buchner/Ridgway (1993), Tsetskhlazde/de Angelis (1994). Note too the initial Theran settlement on the island of Platea before moving to the mainland to the site of Cyrene, cf. Hdt. 4.151. 11 For the foundation of Thasos cf. Graham (1978). 12 There has been much discussion of motives for particular acts of colonisation and some attempts to generalise, but “it is not possible to compile a generally applicable assessment of the interlocking claims of over-population and land-hunger at home, opportunities for commercial or social advancement abroad, ‘internal’ (Greek vs. Greek) 6\n\n24\n\newen l. bowie Literary context\n\nOur remains of archaic Greek poetry are transmitted to us in texts none of which is likely to have been ﬁxed in written form earlier than the late eighth century (thus Hesiod, and perhaps Homer) and most of which were so ﬁxed in the early seventh century (thus more probably Homer) and later, arguably within the lifetime of the poet in question (thus Archilochus, Callinus, Tyrtaeus, Mimnermus, Semonides in the period 660–40 BC; Alcman, Solon, Sappho, Alcaeus in the period 630–580 BC; Stesichorus c. 560 BC, Ibycus and Theognis c. 530 BC, Anacreon and Simonides c. 530–470 BC).13 Even at the end of that period movement of populations continued, in some cases precipitated or aggravated by the Persian take-over of the coastal cities of Asia Minor, as in the case of Xenophanes and other Colophonians moving to Eleia, founded by Phocaea c. 540 BC for that same reason:14 both the past and the present of the worlds familiar to the poets and constructed by them for their audiences were ones in which displacement (sometimes in a form that might be called Ʒƶƥə or ‘exile’) was an omnipresent phenomenon. The most important surviving corpus of archaic poetry is hexameter heroic epic. It must be a matter of speculation what sort of stories dominated lost oral antecedents15 of poems that survive for us either complete (the Iliad and Odyssey) or only in fragments and in later testimonia.16 But what survives presents overwhelmingly worlds in which young males are separated from their polis and their oikos, whether to ﬁght a military campaign overseas (Iliad ) or at least far from home (Thebaid ), to execute a quest imposed upon them by an individual or com-\n\nrivalry and reaction to external pressure” (Ridgway (2003)). For further discussion see Malkin (1987), (1994), (1998), Murray (1993) chapter 7, Tsetskhladze/de Angelis (1994), Osborne (1996). 13 A convenient summary of biographical evidence for the archaic lyric, elegiac and iambic poets (including evidence for dating) can be found in Knox/Easterling (1985) 211–28; more detail (and extensive testimonia) in Campbell (1982), (1988), (1991) and Gerber (1999a,b). 14 Cf. Diog. Laert. 9.18. 15 Since Parry (1928) the view has come to prevail (at different rates in different scholarly climates) that the Iliad and Odyssey stand in or at the end of a tradition of oral poetry and that they (and the lost poems of the epic cycle) in varying degrees develop myths sung in poems which only had an oral existence. Introductions to these issues can be found in Parry (1971), Lord (1960), Foley (1985); note more recently especially Nagy (1996) and the contributions in Mackie (2004). 16 The summaries of Proclus, preserved for us by Photius, and the quoted fragments are to be found in Davies (1988), Bernabé (1987) and West (2003).\n\nearly expatriates\n\n25\n\nmunity (the labours of Heracles and—later—Theseus, the myth of the Argonauts), or intent on ﬁnding their way home from such a quest (the Odyssey, Nostoi ). Although such scenarios offered many opportunities for exciting narratives, and may to some extent have derived their power from macrocosmic similarities to more localised rituals of ephebic separation from, and then re-integration into, the polis, they also at one level reﬂected the realities of the very mobile world of eighth and seventh century Greeks. On a less dramatic level there were parts of Greece (e.g. Attica) where local expansion into land previously uncultivated must have separated individuals and families from ancestral lands and burial places. As it happens, in the Homeric poems much stronger expressions of longing are uttered by characters for their native land or city, for members of their family or for their possessions, by individuals who have left home more or less voluntarily, e.g. Achilles recalling his father back in Phthia,17 than by those who have been forced to leave, whether because family tensions have made staying intolerable, or because they wish to anticipate punishment for a crime, or because they have been sold into slavery (Eumaeus at Od. 15.403–84).18 A review of some of these cases (Phoenix in Iliad 9, Patroclus in Iliad 23, the false story of Odysseus as a Cretan in Odyssey 13) shows how ‘exile’ might be a misleading concept. The story of Phoenix stresses his own decision as the proximate cause of his leaving his father’s palace in Hellas and taking up residence in that of Achilles’ father Peleus. Phoenix had provoked his father’s extreme anger by acceding to his mother’s pleas that he seduce 17 Il. 9.393–400, 24.487–92,507–11; cf. Odysseus’ expressions of longing for Ithaca and Penelope at Od. 9.27–8: ưȼ Ƶƫ ȄƥƺƥƧ / ȓƳ ƥƣɛƩƳ ƦɟƮƣvƣƫ ƥƭƶƬƧƲɡƵƧƲưƮ Ǵƭƭư ȜƦɗƴƪƣƫ, 9.34: ɅƳ ưȸƦɖƮ ƥƭɟƬƫưƮ ȓƳ ƱƣƵƲɛƦưƳ ưȸƦɖ ƵưƬəƺƮ (taken up or quoted at Dio Chrys.

Gaertner for drawing my attention to these passages. 18 In addition to the cases I discuss note in the Iliad the more brieﬂy told stories of Medon (13.694–7), Lycophron (15.430–2) and Epeigeus (16.571–4) and in the Odyssey of an unnamed Aetolian cited by Eumaeus (14.379–81) and of Theoclymenus (15.272–8); at Od. 23.118–120 Odysseus takes ﬂight to be the normal consequence of killing another member of one’s community. Cf. Hainsworth (1993) on Il. 9.479–84 and Schlunk (1976). The contribution of such cases of ﬂight from punishment for homicide to the history of colonisation as a whole is rather exaggerated by Dougherty (1993) 31–44.\n\n26\n\newen l. bowie\n\nhis father’s concubine; his father had called upon the Erinyes to curse him with childlessness; and although he had mastered his urge to kill his father when (it seems) he perceived himself impotent, he could not bear to stay in the palace of his wrathful father and eluded the attempts of his relatives to dissuade or prevent him from departing. He broke down the doors of his bedroom, leapt over the courtyard wall, and “ﬂed far away through Hellas of the broad choruses”19 (Il. 9.478: ƷƧ˃ƥưƮ ȄƱƧƫƵ’ ǰƱɕƮƧƶƪƧ Ʀƫ’ ˘ƈƭƭɕƦưƳ ƧȸƲƶƸɝƲưƫư). Phoenix does not explicitly dwell on the life he has left, though his catalogue of the eating and drinking to which his cousins resorted to detain him gives us a hint of the prosperity on which he was turning his back, and the epithet ƧȸƲƶƸɝƲưƫư, “of the broad choruses”, may be there to remind us of the meaningful rituals of community from which he is ‘exiling’ himself.20 The story of Patroclus, a doublet of that of Phoenix, is much more brieﬂy told: Patroclus, still an infant, killed another boy in anger precipitated by playing—and presumably losing at—dice, and his father brought him from their Opuntian home to the palace of Peleus (cf. Il. 24.86–90). The cause is termed homicide, ǰƮƦƲưƬƵƣƴɛƩ, and it is implied that Menoetius and his young son had little choice but to leave. A similar situation is envisaged a little later in the same book in a simile: Priam’s entry to Achilles’ tent is compared to that of somebody “who has slain a man in his own country and comes to other people’s land, to the house of a wealthy man, and amazement grips those who see him” (Il. 24.480–2: ȱƳ Ƶʞ ȀƮɚ ƱɕƵƲʤ / ƷːƵƣ ƬƣƵƣƬƵƧɛƮƣƳ ǴƭƭƺƮ ȀƯɛƬƧƵư ƦʦvưƮ, / ǰƮƦƲɜƳ ȀƳ ǰƷƮƧƫư˃, ƪɕvƤưƳ Ʀʞ ȄƸƧƫ ƧȜƴưƲɝƺƮƵƣƳ). The same schema is used to ‘explain’ the colonisation of Rhodes by Tlepolemus in the Catalogue of Ships, Il. 2.661–70. Here, of course, although it is only Tlepolemus himself who has slain somebody (indeed a kinsman) he is accompanied on his colonising venture by numerous ȁƵƣʴƲưƫ. A very similar pattern informs the false tale of Odysseus as a Cretan aristocrat who had fought alongside Idomeneus at Troy (Od. 13.257–86). Odysseus claims to have been in danger of losing the booty he had won from Troy to Idomeneus’ son Orsilochus because in the Trojan War he had refused to be Idomeneus’ subordinate and had insisted on leading his own warrior band. So, he asserts, back in Crete he ambushed and killed Orsilochus and persuaded Phoenicians to convey him (and some of his 19\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all translations are mine. Cf. Hainsworth (1993) on Il. 9.478 noting the importance of the ƸưƲɝƳ as “public religious ceremony”. 20\n\nearly expatriates\n\n27\n\nbooty, less their cut) overseas. The killing of Orsilochus seems superﬂuous: if ‘the Cretan’ was to have to leave Crete to secure his booty, why not just leave? We may tell ourselves that ‘the Cretan’ needed to express his anger against Orsilochus for his treatment, and that Odysseus wants to make it clear to his interlocutor (not yet known to him as Athena) that he can be dangerous and ruthless; or we may imagine that the poet is drawing on the story-type of exile brought about by ǰƮƦƲưƬƵƣƴɛƩ. ‘The Cretan’ regrets abandoning his place of origin—or at least the half of his booty that he left there with his sons—but he presents himself as positive about his new start in life. For Homer, then, voluntary and involuntary exile are close if not overlapping, and he does not give his characters a rhetoric which marks either out as a deprivation that is extreme or sui generis—that is reserved for women or old men who see their male relatives of ﬁghting age slain and are themselves captured or killed in the sack of a city.21 This phenomenon becomes less surprising if we consider some cases of archaic migration known from later texts and a very few sidelights on such migration in poetry that was both contemporary with these migrations and, if we place our Iliad and Odyssey around 680–70 BC, almost contemporary with Homer. Whereas the movement of Greeks to found a new ƱɝƭƫƳ on a different site can often be ascribed to a combination of diverse factors—a general shortage of agricultural land on the existing site, trading opportunities imagined or already observed, the new site’s superior land and situation—there are several cases where the political situation in the ƱɝƭƫƳ seems to have been crucial in precipitating the departure of a group. According to a later tradition, already found in the ﬁfth-century historian Antiochus of Syracuse (FGrHist 555 F 13) and preserved for us by Strabo (6.3.2), Tarentum was founded c. 706 BC by a group of Laconians, Partheniae, whom he claims to have been threatened with deprivation of their civic rights because they had been born when their Spartiate fathers were away from home ﬁghting the ﬁrst Messenian war; that their leader’s name was Phalanthus has encouraged some to see a pre-Dorian stratum of the population that was being subjected to ethnic cleansing. The whole story has been doubted,22 but even if fabricated it shows what patterns seemed plausible no later than the ﬁfth century.\n\n21 22\n\nE.g. Andromache at Il. 24.725–38. E.g. by Osborne (1996) 179–80.\n\n28\n\newen l. bowie\n\nAn analogous pattern is offered by Herodotus (4.146–9) for a darkage Laconian foundation on Thera: Theras, a descendant of Polynices, was regent to his young nephews Eurysthenes and Procles, and when in due course they took power he so resented being ruled by others (cf. Hdt. 4.147.3: ƦƧƫƮɜƮ ƱưƫƧɟvƧƮưƳ ǴƲƸƧƴƪƣƫ ȹƱʞ ǴƭƭƺƮ) that he went off to join alleged kinsfolk on Thera, taking with him both colonists from the Spartan tribes and a troublesome and recently arrived group claiming to be Minyans. The deal suited both those who left and those who stayed, though the departing Theras was said to have seen his son who stayed behind as a “sheep abandoned among wolves” (cf. Hdt. 4.149.1: ƵưƫƥƣƲːƮ ȄƷƩ ƣȸƵɜƮ ƬƣƵƣƭƧɛƹƧƫƮ ȰƫƮ ȀƮ ƭɟƬưƫƴƫ). A third case may have a stronger claim to historical content. According to Herodotus (6.34–6), Miltiades, son of Cypselus and a descendant through Philaeus of Aeacus, was invited by a Thracian people in the Chersonese to assist their defence of that area, and (once given approval by Delphi) accepted the invitation because he was unhappy at being subjected to Peisistratus’ régime in Attica and wanted to get out (cf. Hdt. 6.35.3: ưȣƣ ǰƸƪɝvƧƮɝƮ ƵƧ Ƶʧ ƓƧƫƴƫƴƵƲɕƵưƶ ǰƲƸʧ Ƭƣɚ ƤưƶƭɝvƧƮưƮ ȀƬƱưƦɠƮ ƧȢƮƣƫ). So Miltiades sailed off with any Athenians who wanted to join him and was installed as tyrant in the Chersonese. The story makes sense. Although Peisistratus allowed other aristocrats to hold the archonship and presumably to exercise some degree of power, such subordination was not congenial to a man whose descent and wealth (marked out by Herodotus by the fact that he had already won an Olympic victory with a four-horse chariot)23 seemed to entitle him to be top dog. Top dog he became in the Chersonese, and there is no sign of bad relations between his régime there and that of the Peisistratids in Attica. This is not in any usual sense ‘exile’, but its consequences are very similar. We cannot tell how many regrets (if any) Miltiades and his fellow Athenians voiced for the hills and plains of Attica, the protected bays of its south-western coast, or the pomp of the developing Panathenaea. But—as in the tales of ‘the Cretan’, of the Partheniae, and of Theras— the decision to depart must have been perceived to involve losses as well as gains. In this context we may contemplate the cases of Archilochus and Semonides. First, the well-known primary texts: 23 Cf. Hdt. 6.36.1. A closely contemporary indication of the prestige attaching to a chariot victory is given by the dedication by an Alcmeonid, Alcmeonides son of Alcmeon, at the Ptoion in Boeotia, CEG 302 (Hansen, c. 540 BC?).\n\nearly expatriates\n\n29\n\nȄƣ ƓɕƲưƮ, Ƭƣɚ ƴ˃Ƭƣ ƬƧʴƮƣ, Ƭƣɚ ƪƣƭɕƴƴƫưƮ ƤɛưƮ\n\nArchil. fr. 116 (West) Away with Paros and those ﬁgs and the sea-bound life.

The inscription of Mnesiepes from the Parian Archilocheion (SEG 15.517 E 1 col. II 41–52) has the poet’s father Telesicles and the poet’s enemy Lycambes co-operating—or at least serving together—on an embassy from Paros to Delphi, and the father returning to Paros to be greeted ﬁrst by his son destined for immortality as a poet. Two centuries earlier Critias (VS 88 B 44 = Ael. VH 10.13) had been able to read poems of Archilochus as showing that he had left Paros as a result of poverty (Ʀƫɔ ƱƧƮɛƣƮ Ƭƣɚ ǰƱưƲɛƣƮ) and that on arrival at Thasos he had acquired enemies there (ƵưʴƳ ȀƮƵƣ˃ƪƣ ȀƸƪƲɜƳ ȀƥɗƮƧƵư). So far our surviving fragments of Archilochus do not allow us to decide whether the poems that stated or implied enmity with Lycambes were composed for ﬁrst performance in Paros or in Thasos. If the 24 Much of this is a Parian narrative, found in the inscriptions erected in the Parian Archilocheion by Mnesiepes (third cent. BC, SEG 15.517) and Sosthenes (ﬁrst cent. BC, SEG 15.518). We cannot be sure that it was fully supported by the surviving poetry, far less that Thasians accepted the same tradition. For Archilochus’ putative biography cf. Burnett (1983), Bowie (1996), Clay (2004).\n\n30\n\newen l. bowie\n\nenmity with Lycambes began or was wholly associated with Paros, then the movement of Archilochus’ father and (then?) Archilochus to Thasos may have been partly due to something approaching ƴƵɕƴƫƳ between two families who were ȀƸƪƲưɛ—i.e. a variant of the schema we have seen in the stories of ‘the Cretan’ (Od. 13.257–86), of Theras (Hdt. 4.146–9) and of Miltiades (Hdt. 6.34.6). In that context it is not wholly surprising that nothing survives in which Archilochus laments the island he had had to leave. The notion that recollections of an early love-affair included clambering across its craggy glens25 is less likely than that these curves are human and female.26 The Parian image that survives is of ﬁgs and ﬁsh. Parian ﬁgs are good, and can command a high price, but their dismissal in fr. 116 (West) suggests that—like his shield, fr. 5 (West)— they seemed to Archilochus something for which he could easily ﬁnd substitutes. That is not contradicted by his apparent reluctance to see the virtues of his new home: ironically it is precisely in his essay De Exilio that Plutarch cites fr. 21 (West) as a parallel for his readers’ supposed inclination to ignore the advantages of exile and allow themselves to be obsessed by its demerits.27 We cannot be sure whether this focus on Thasos’ forested mountains and blindness to its arable land and vineyards was combined in the same poem with praise of a ﬁne, desirable and lovely location by the river Siris (fr. 22 (West)), or whether indeed the speaker was not the poet himself but the carpenter Charon (cf. fr. 19 (West)) from whom the poet-narrator might in the end have expressed a different view. But at least we can say that we have nothing that articulates longing for a lost life in Paros. If the case of Archilochus is hard to reconstruct, that of Semonides is well-nigh impossible. Indeed his movement from Samos to Amorgos may be quite unlike any of the cases I have reviewed. But neither superior agricultural land, nor pursuit of trade or metals, can explain the seventh century movement of Samians, led by Semonides, to one or more of the three cities that had been founded by Naxians c. 900 BC on Amorgos, a mere 60 miles west-south-west of Samos in the middle of the Aegean.28 It is at least a possibility that political dissension (exac25\n\nSo Lasserre (1950) 136 ff.

Given Plutarch’s habits of quotation, however, it would be unwise to infer that anything in the Archilochean poem from which he draws his brief quotation actually represented the poet’s (or speaker’s) situation as exile. 28 For a brief account of Amorgos’ three cities, Arcesine, Minoa and Aegiale, and references to further discussions see Catling (2003). 26\n\nearly expatriates\n\n31\n\nerbated by the barbs of Semonides’ iambic ƹɝƥưƳ?) contributed to the exodus of Semonides and those who went with him.
