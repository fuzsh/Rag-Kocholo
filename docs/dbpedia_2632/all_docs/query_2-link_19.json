        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) — Sporting Kansas City parted ways with forward Claudio Bieler on Tuesday after two seasons.\n\nBieler joined the franchise as a Designated Player and was the team's top scorer in its MLS Cup-winning 2013 with 10 goals in the MLS regular season. He wound up with 16 goals and five assists in 54 appearances across all competitions over the past two seasons.\n\nOne of Bieler's highlights came last season, when he scored twice in a 3-0 victory over Real Esteli in the CONCACAF Champions League. He also had two goals during the MLS regular season.\n\nMORE: Keep track of MLS' major offseason moves\n\n\"Claudio's service here was a huge help, especially during our run to MLS Cup in 2013,\" Sporting KC manager Peter Vermes said. \"He was a professional since the moment he arrived, and we are appreciative of his time in Kansas City. We wish him all the best.\"\n\nThe move leaves Sporting KC with a vacant international roster and DP spot."
