Furthermore, bio-based methods for nanomaterial synthesis are inherently “green”, enabling low-cost and scalable production of nanomaterials under benign conditions in aqueous solutions. However, achieving regulated control of the biological processes necessary for reproducible, scalable biosynthesis of nanomaterials remains a central challenge. This is especially true of quantum dots (QDs), which are nanocrystals made from seminconducting metals whose diameter is smaller than the size of its exciton Bohr radius, leading to size-dependent changes in their optical properties. Several studies have described production of QDs from biological systems, but without control over particle size or composition. In this work, we describe the isolation, selection and characterization of a bacterial system capable of regulated, extracellular biosynthesis of metal sulfide QDs with extrinsic control over nanocrystal size. Using directed evolution, we isolated and engineered a bacterial strain (SMCD1) to (1) exhibit enhanced tolerance against aqueous cadmium acetate (2) produce soluble, extracellular nanocrystals and (3) regulate nanocrystal size by varying growth conditions. We estimate yields on the order of grams per liter from batch cultures under optimized conditions, and are able to reproduce the entire size range of CdS QDs described in literature. Furthermore, we are able to generalize this approach to not only cadmium, but PbS QDs as well. Investigation of purified QDs using ESI-MS reveals several putative proteins that may be involved in biosynthesis, and current work is aimed at improving photoluminescent properties as well as long-term aqueous stability. Nonetheless, our approach clearly demonstrates the ability of biological systems to produce advanced, functional nanomaterials, and provides a template for engineering biological systems to high-value materials such as QDs at cost and scale.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation (EFRI-1332349).\n\nPA-002\n\nProtein and Cellular Engineering Platform for Selective and Inducible Apoptotic Proteolysis\n\nCharlie Morgan1,2,3, Juan Diaz3, Jim Wells3\n\n1Chemistry and Chemical Biology Graduate Program, UCSF, 2Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, UCSF, 3Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, UCSF\n\nProteolysis is a fundamental process in biology; it plays a crucial role across development of multicellular organisms, aids in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and is integral in cell signaling. Intracellular proteolysis frequently focuses on proteasome mediated protein degradation, however the tightly regulated and selective proteolysis mediated by the cysteine-aspartyl specific proteases, caspases, leave their substrates intact. The growing list of caspase substrates now tops 1500 proteins; a key unmet question is to differentiate how individual substrate cleavages directly lead to the profound morphological transformations that are the hallmark of apoptotic cells. We employ an optimized site-specific and inducible split-protein protease to examine the role of a classic apoptotic node, the Caspase Activated DNase (CAD). We describe our engineering platform of post-transcriptional gene replacement (PTGR), where-by endogenous bi-allelic ICAD is knocked down and simultaneously replaced with an engineered allele that is susceptible to cleavage by our engineered TEV protease. Remarkably, selective activation of CAD alone does not induce cell death, although hallmarks of DNA damage are detected in human cancer cell lines. Additionally, we show the utility of our technology in deciphering synthetic lethality resulting from coordinated proteolysis of caspase substrates that control the apoptotic hallmark of chromatin fragmentation.\n\nPA-003\n\nImproving microbial medium-chain fatty acid production using GPCR-based chemical sensors\n\nStephen Sarria1, Souryadeep Bhattacharyya2, Pamela Peralta-Yahya1\n\n1 School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nIncreasing energy needs have accelerated the demand for renewable alternatives to petroleum-based fuels; engineered microbes for the production of biofuels have the potential to fulfill these energy needs. Fatty acids are the immediate precursors to the advanced biofuels fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), which can serve as a “drop in” replacement for D2 diesel. FAMEs derived from medium-chain fatty acids (C8-C12) have been shown to have better cold properties than traditional FAMEs (C16-C22). Here, we engineer a yeast strain for the production of medium chain fatty acids by screening different thioesterases. Our next goal is to couple a medium-chain fatty acid producing yeast strain to our previously developed medium-chain fatty acid GPCR-based sensor, in order to engineer a yeast strain with improved medium-chain fatty acid production via directed evolution.\n\nPB-001\n\nApplications of 19F-NMR to study protein-ligand interactions and protein conformational changes in solution\n\nMartine I. Abboud1, Jurgen Brem1, Rasheduzzaman Chowdhury1, Ivanhoe K. H. Leung2, Timothy D. W. Claridge1, Christopher J. Schofield1\n\n1University of Oxford, Department of Chemistry, 2University of Auckland, School of Chemical Sciences\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful biophysical method for studying protein-ligand interactions in solution and elucidating the mechanism of action of potential inhibitors. However, protein NMR can be complicated by the overlap of 1H and other resonances, hence the resolution needed to assign spectra precisely can be hard to achieve [1]. 19F-NMR is increasingly being used to study conformational changes and protein-ligand interactions in solution because 19F is (i) a spin ½ nucleus, (ii) 100% naturally abundant, (iii) 83% as sensitive to NMR detection as 1H, (iv) not present in most biological systems, and (v) its chemical shift is particularly sensitive to changes in local environment [2]. Recent advancements in NMR instrument and probe design have made 19F-NMR more sensitive and more widely available; consequently, 19F-NMR is finding growing application in research. Here, we report the use of 19F-NMR to study two biomedically important protein systems. Proteins can be fluorine-labelled either by biological incorporation of fluorinated amino acids or by site-specific chemical ligation [3]. 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (BTFA) has been developed as a useful reagent for importing fluorine into proteins via nucleophilic substitution such as with a cysteinyl-thiol [4]. The São Paulo metallo-β-lactamase-1 (SPM-1), a B1 sub-family metallo-β-lactamase, containing only one cysteine (Cys221) coordinating the second Zn(II) cation in its active site, was 19F-labelled using BTFA. The interactions of SPM-1 with various potential inhibitors were reported by 19F-NMR, which enabled monitoring SPM-1 conformational changes on ligand binding and informed on binding strength by enabling KD measurements. In a second study, prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), an enzyme involved in human oxygen sensing, was 19F-labelled and its interactions with its co-substrate, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), and peptide substrate (CODD) were monitored by 19F-NMR. Conformational changes of PHD2 on 2OG and CODD binding were consistent with crystallographic analyses. Finally, 19F-NMR was used to study solvent exposure of the complex and its dynamics in solution through relaxation dispersion of the 19F-nucleus at different temperatures. Overall, the results illustrate the power of 19F-NMR for monitoring ligand binding and conformational changes.\n\n[1] Wemmer, B. D. E., & Williams, P. G. (1994).

Lacticin Q from Lactococcus lactis QU 5 belongs to an unusual class of bacteriocins classified by the absence of an N-terminal leader sequence. It is composed of 53 amino acids and has previously been reported to be active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria in the nanomolar range. In this study, lacticin Q was expressed as a recombinant protein fused to SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) protein. After cleavage of the SUMO-tag and subsequent purification, mass spectrometry was used to confirm the identity of the recombinant lacticin Q. Its three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure was then elucidated. Both circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy results reveal that lacticin Q is highly α-helical. It has a compact, globular overall fold and has a cationic surface and a hydrophobic core. These structural data support previously established mechanism of action, whereby antimicrobial activity is attributed to the binding of lacticin Q to anionic bacterial cell membrane and subsequent formation of pores that result in the leakage of cell contents. The elucidated structure of lacticin Q resembles the two-component leaderless bacteriocins enterocins 7A and 7B, which are 9- and 10- amino acids shorter than lacticin Q. This suggests that the observed overall fold might be conserved among this class of bacteriocins.\n\nPB-003\n\nSizing and interactions of proteins under native conditions from microfluidic diffusion measurements: application to molecular chaperones and single-step immunoassay\n\nPaolo Arosio1, Thomas Müller1, Luke Rajah1, Francesco Aprile1, Tom Scheidt1, Jackie Carrozza1, Maya Wright1, Michele Vendruscolo1, Christopher Dobson1, Tuomas Knowles1\n\n1Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge\n\nCharacterizing the sizes and shapes of proteins and their interactions is of fundamental importance for understanding the behavior of a large variety of systems in the biological and biotechnological sciences. Defining these properties under native conditions, directly in solution and on a second timescale, remains, however, challenging. To address this problem, we have developed a method based on monitoring micron-scale diffusion in both space and time by acquiring, in a microfluidic format, diffusion profiles at different diffusion times under steady-state flow conditions. We show that the global analysis of this combined space-time acquisition enables the average sizes of the components of monodisperse and polydisperse solutions, as well as the sizes of individual species within binary mixtures, to be determined directly. We show that the ability to perform rapid and non-invasive sizing enables this technique to be used to quantify the thermodynamics and the kinetics of specific interactions between molecular chaperones and protein aggregates in complex polydisperse solutions, as well as to identify the oligomerization state of dynamic protein systems. We demonstrate further a quantitative immunoassay that enables specific interactions between biomolecules as well as the conformations of target protein species to be determined directly in solution even in heterogeneous mixtures.\n\nPB-004\n\nUsing α-chymotrypsin and elastase enzymatic degradation to control peptide self-assembly\n\nValeria Castelletto1, Ian Hamley1\n\n1School of Chemistry, University of Reading\n\nA micellar nanocontainer delivery and release system is designed on the basis of a peptide-polymer conjugate. 1 The hybrid molecules self-assemble into micelles comprising a modified amyloid peptide core surrounded by a PEG corona. The modified amyloid peptide previously studied in our group forms helical ribbons based on a β-sheet motif and contains β-amino acids that are excluded from the β-sheet structure, thus being potentially useful as fibrillization inhibitors. In the model peptide-PEG hybrid system studied, enzymatic degradation using R-chymotrypsin leads to selective cleavage close to the PEG-peptide linkage, break up of the micelles, and release of peptides in unassociated form. The release of monomeric peptide is useful because aggregation of the released peptide into β-sheet amyloid fibrils is not observed. This concept has considerable potential in the targeted delivery of peptides for therapeutic applications. In a separate work, the self-assembly of the alanine-rich amphiphilic peptides Lys(Ala)6Lys (KA6K) and Lys(Ala)6Glu (KA6E) with homotelechelic or heterotelechelic charged termini respectively has been investigated in aqueous solution. 2 These peptides contain hexa-alanine sequences designed to serve as substrates for the enzyme elastase. Electrostatic repulsion of the lysine termini in KA6K prevents self-assembly, whereas in contrast KA6E is observed, through electron microscopy, to form tape-like fibrils, which based on X-ray scattering contain layers of thickness equal to the molecular length. The alanine residues enable efficient packing of the side-chains in a β-sheet structure, as revealed by circular dichroism, FTIR and X-ray diffraction experiments. In buffer, KA6E is able to form hydrogels at sufficiently high concentration. These were used as substrates for elastase, and enzyme-induced de-gelation was observed due to the disruption of the β-sheet fibrillar network. We propose that hydrogels of the simple designed amphiphilic peptide KA6E may serve as model substrates for elastase and this could ultimately lead to applications in biomedicine and regenerative medicine.\n\n[1] V.

First, we have synthesized, to our knowledge, the first membrane permeable fluorescent probe Ni-NTA-AC that enters cells and monitors intracellular His-tagged proteins in minutes, without functionally perturbing the target proteins ( ) [1]. Arylazide photoactivation to covalently linked the His-tagged proteins by Ni-NTA-AC resulted in significant fluorescence enhancement (∼13-fold). Ni-NTA-AC successfully traced the subcellular localization of His-tagged proteins with negligible toxicity in different biological systems, including bacterial and mammalian cells and even the plant tissues. We are currently developing fluorescent probes with different fluorophores using similar strategy to enable the simultaneous examination of tagged target proteins in cells. Besides, we have constructed two fluorescent sensors CYHpnl and CYHpnl_1-48 (with C-terminus glutamine-rich sequence deleted) to elucidate the role of metalloprotein Hpn-like by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) ( ) [2]. We found the selective coordination of Ni(II) and Zn(II) to the purified sensors and in E. coli cells. Surprisingly, specific interaction between the FRET sensors and Bi(III) was observed. Our FRET analysis confirmed the role of Hpnl for Ni(II) storage and revealed the potential association of Hpnl with Bi-based antiulcer drugs in cells.\n\nThis work was supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (704909 and N_HKU75209, 704612P, 703913P), Livzon Pharmaceutical Group and the University of Hong Kong (for the emerging Strategic Research Theme – Integrative Biology).\n\n[1] Y.T.

Phosphorylation of the RBP K-Homology Splicing Regulatory Protein (KSRP) induces protein unfolding and impairs the ability of KSRP to promote the degradation of its RNA targets [1,2]. This finding reveals the molecular mechanism that links the mRNA-degradation pathway with extracellular signaling networks through the reversible unfolding of a RNA binding domain (RBD). RNA binding is also controlled by pH conditions. This finding becomes relevant for RBPs such as T-cell Intracellular Antigen 1 (TIA-1), which shuttles between two cellular compartments (nucleus and cytoplasm) with slightly different pH values. In fact, RNA binding by TIA-1 is modulated by slight environmental pH changes due to the protonation/deprotonation of TIA-1 histidine residues [3,4]. The pH dependence of the TIA-1/RNA interaction provides a new insight into the function of TIA-1 in recognizing new RNA targets [5], like the 5’ Terminal Oligopyrimidine Tracts (5´TOPs) of translationally-repressed mRNAs. Along with TIA-1, the RBP Hu antigen R (HuR) is involved in the assembly/disassembly of cytoplasmic Stress Granules (SG), which arise as a protective mechanism by preventing mRNA decay under stress situations. Despite wide acceptance that RBPs harboring aggregation-promoting Prion Related Domains (PRDs), such as TIA-1, stimulate rapid self-association and formation of SGs, we propose that scaffolding SGs may be driven by RBDs, since PRD-lacking RBPs, like HuR, often form oligomers [6,7,8] and are included in SGs. Under continuous stress, the transition from the physiological to pathological aggregation of RBPs in SGs may depend on post-translational modifications of RBDs. RNA-binding proteinopathies, characterized by the nucleation of irreversible SGs, are often found in neurodegenerative diseases. Altogether, resulting insights into RNA biology suggest that highly-regulated RBPs determine mRNA fate from synthesis to decay.\n\n[1] Díaz-Moreno et al. (2009) Nat. Struct. Mol.

Liver FABP (L-FABP) is characterized by high versatility in terms of ligand binding capabilities.[1] Indeed, both long chain fatty acids as well as bulkier ligands can be accommodated into the protein’s large internal cavity. The involvement of L-FABP in the transport of bile salts has been postulated but scarcely investigated.[2] This hypothesis is further supported by the realization that L-BABP (a type 2 intracellular lipid binding protein bile-salt carrier) is absent in mammals. We have used a variety of NMR experiments, as well as steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry to gain insight, at molecular and atomic level, into the interactions established by human L-FABP with a pool of bile acids [3, 4], contributing to improve our understanding of the binding specificity for this important class of cholesterol-derived metabolites. An extensive comparison among L-FABP alone, in complex with bile acids, and in complex with oleate, has been performed in order to investigate the distinctive features of L-FABP binding promiscuity.[3] NMR relaxation experiments on different timescales suggest that human L-FABP is poorly selective in terms of ligand binding and a functional role is played by its internal dynamics. Taken together our findings expand the current knowledge about ligand recognition by L-FABP with implications in the intracellular transport of bile acids in physiological and pathological states.\n\n[1] Zimmerman AW, Veerkamp JH (2002) Cell Mol Life Sci. 59, 1096–1116.\n\n[2] Guariento M, Raimondo D, Assfalg M, Zanzoni S, Pesente P, Ragona L, Tramontano A & Molinari H (2008) Proteins 70, 462–472.\n\n[3] Favretto F, Assfalg M, Gallo M, Cicero DO, D’Onofrio M & Molinari H (2013) ChemBioChem 14, 1807–1819.\n\n[4] Favretto F, Santambrogio C, D’Onofrio M, Molinari H, Grandori R & Assfalg M (2015) FEBS J. 282,1271–88.\n\nPB-008\n\nAntimalarial Agents With a Novel Mode of Action: Dual Inhibition of P. falciparum M1 and M17 Metalloaminopeptidases\n\nNyssa Drinkwater1, Shailesh Mistry2, Komagal Kannan Sivaraman1, Alessandro Paiardini3, Vicky Avery4, Peter Scammells2, Sheena McGowan1\n\n1Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Monash University, 2Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 3Dipartmento di Scienze Biochimiche, Sapienza Universita di Roma, 4Eskitis Institute for Drug Discovery, Griffith University\n\nMalaria is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, with P. falciparum (Pf) causing the most fatalities. The prevention and treatment of Pf malaria is becoming increasingly difficult due to the spread of drug resistant parasites. New therapeutics with a novel mode of action are desperately required. Two P. falciparum aminopeptidases, PfA-M1 and PfA-M17, play crucial roles in the erythrocytic stage of infection, and have been validated as potential antimalarial targets. Using compound-bound crystal structures of both enzymes, we were able to identify key similarities and differences in the mechanism of inhibitor binding by PfA-M1 versus PfA-M17, which we exploited to design inhibitors capable of potently inhibiting both enzymes. The resultant hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors represent the first compounds capable of potent dual inhibition of both PfA-M1 and PfA-M17. The compounds additionally possess nanomolar activity against 3D7 malaria parasites and no observable cytotoxicity, and are therefore extremely attractive lead molecules for further development into antimalarial therapeutics with a novel mode of action.\n\nPB-009\n\nDifferent classes of inhibitors for human 15-lipoxygenase-1\n\nNikolaos Eleftheriadis1, Stephanie Thee1, Johan te Biesebeek1, Petra van der Wouden1, Bert-Jan Baas1, Frank J. Dekker1\n\n1Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy\n\nLipoxygenases metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids into signalling molecules such as leukotrienes and lipoxins. 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) is an important mammalian lipoxygenase and plays a crucial regulatory role in several respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD and chronic bronchitis. Novel potent and selective inhibitors of 15-LOX-1 are required to explore the role of this enzyme in drug discovery. In this study we present different classes of inhibitors for human 15-LOX-1. Kinetic analysis suggests competitive inhibition and the binding model of these compounds can be rationalized using molecular modelling studies. The new inhibitors show Ki values from 0.040 µM to 1.7 µM. These structure-activity relationships provide a basis to design improved inhibitors and explore 15-LOX-1 as a drug target.\n\nPB-010\n\nIdentification of Novel Inhibitors of 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase (6PGDH) in Trypanosoma brucei Through Virtual Drug Screening\n\nVictoria Gomez1, Kavya Kolavasi1, Josh Beckham1, Jon Robertus1\n\n1The University of Texas at Austin College of Natural Science\n\nA threat to 70 million people in underdeveloped nations around the world, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei). T. brucei is transmitted to humans via the tsetse fly, and replicates in the blood before crossing into the brain, causing death for the infected individual. Current treatments that are available for African sleeping sickness are highly toxic and usually difficult to administer past the blood-brain barrier. It is our belief that coupling less toxic compounds with efficient drug delivery systems will contribute to the development of the most effective drug against African sleeping sickness. Our goal was to determine a novel and effective chemical inhibitor with the potential to prevent the replication of T. brucei in the human body. The enzyme target for inhibition studied in this research was 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), a cytosolic enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of T. brucei. 6PGDH is essential in the PPP due to its ability to oxidize 6-phosphogluconate into ribulose-5-phosphate, which is essential for the formation of nucleotides. Primer overlap extension Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize the coding DNA sequence of the 6PGDH gene, which was then cloned into a pNIC-Bsa4 inducible expression plasmid with an N-terminal 6 Histidine tag, by way of ligation independent cloning. The protein was then expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells and purified via nickel column affinity and size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) to perform inhibition assays. Through virtual screening, various ligands obtained from the Chembridge Library and NIH Clinical Collection) were docked into the active site of the crystal structure of Tb6pgdh (Pubchem identification 1PGJ) using GOLD molecular docking software. The top scoring compounds were selected by utilizing parameters such as hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and Van der Waals forces. The compounds with the best scores that also satisfied Lipinski’s Rule of 5 criteria for druggability were then tested in spectrophotometric enzyme inhibition assays monitoring the absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm. Compounds that show inhibitory activity in the assays will be taken to higher levels of testing to determine their effect on T. brucei in other organisms.\n\nPB-011\n\nNMR studies of the structural influence of phosphopantetheinylation in nonribosomal peptide synthetase carrier proteins and impact on binding affinities\n\nAndrew Goodrich1, Dominique Frueh1\n\n1Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\n\nNonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are modular enzymatic systems responsible for the production of complex secondary metabolites in bacteria and fungi. Each module is comprised of (at least) three core domains whose combined action leads to the selection, activation, and incorporation of a single small molecule into a growing peptide. Central to each module is the carrier protein (CP), which is first primed via attachment of a 4’-phosphopantetheine moiety (ppant arm) to a conserved serine to generate the active holo form. An adenylation (A) domain then covalently attaches an amino or aryl acid onto the ppant arm via formation of a thioester. The CP then shuttles activated monomers and growing peptides between the active sites of catalytic domains in both the same and adjacent modules. During CP priming and peptide elongation, a CP thus exists in multiple different post-translational states and interacts with numerous catalytic domains. Understanding how NRPSs are able to efficiently orchestrate this series of sequential protein-protein interactions between a CP and its partner catalytic domains is key to unraveling the molecular mechanism of NRP synthesis. Using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations, we found that converting a CP from the apo to holo form alters its affinity for its partner A domain. This change in binding suggests a means by which directionality in protein-protein interactions is achieved in NRPSs. However, we also found that A domain binding affects the same subset of residues in both the apo and holo forms. In order to identify the molecular features underpinning this difference in affinity, we solved the NMR solution structures of the apo and holo forms of the CP. Here, we present the solution structures of an apo and holo CP and discuss them in light of their differential binding to an A domain.\n\nPB-012\n\nFunctional analysis of of conditional analog-sensitive alleles of essential protein kinases in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.\n\nJuraj Gregan1, 2\n\n1Mfpl/imp, 2Comenius University\n\nThe genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes for 17 protein kinases that are essential for viability. Studies of the essential kinases often require the use of mutant strains carrying conditional alleles. To inactivate these kinases conditionally, we applied a recently developed chemical genetic strategy. The mutation of a single residue in the ATP-binding pocket confers sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors, allowing for specific inactivation of the modified kinase. Using this approach, we constructed conditional analog-sensitive alleles of 13 essential protein kinases in the fission yeast S. pombe. I will present the functional analysis of these mutants during meiosis.\n\nPB-013\n\nPeptide conjugates: From self-assembly towards applications in biomedicine\n\nIan Hamley1\n\n1University Of Reading, Dept of Chemistry\n\nSelf-assembling peptides and their conjugates offer exceptional potential in nanomedicine. I will present some of our recent work on nanoscale assembled peptides and their conjugates, focussing on lipopeptides [1, 2] and PEG-peptide conjugates [3]. PEGylation is an important technique in the development of conjugates for applications in therapeutics. It is found to greatly influence self-assembly of peptides and proteins - one example from our own work is a peptide which itself forms twisted fibrils but when PEG is attached, self-assembly of the conjugate leads to spherical micelles[4]. The conjugate can be enzymatically degraded using alpha-chymotrypsin, releasing the peptide. This nanocontainer delivery and release system could be useful in therapeutic applications. Thermoresponsive telechelic PEG/peptides with hydrophobic dipeptide end groups (di-tyrosine or di-phenylalanine) were developed, one of which shows a de-gelation transition near body temperature and which may be useful in bioresponsive delivery systems [5]. Examples from our recent work on self-assembling lipopeptides will also be outlined. Our focus is to investigate potential relationships between self-assembly and bioactivity, in particular in the fields of regenerative medicine [6-10], antimicrobial systems [11, 12] and immune therapies [13].\n\n[1] Dehsorkhi A, Castelletto V, Hamley IW.

Klingler1, Ewgenij Proschak1\n\n1Goethe University, Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry\n\nAntibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is one of the major threats regarding human health. An alarming trend is the spread of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) among gram-negative pathogens that transfer resistance against almost all β-lactams including carbapenems. [1] The development of new anti-infective agents remains one of the most significant demands in modern medicine. [2] The aim of this work is to find an already approved drug which restores the activity of β-lactam antibiotic by protecting it from hydrolysis through the MBL. Thiol groups are known zinc chelators and therefore inhibit MBLs.[3] We established a novel sensitive fluorescence-based assay platform for studying inhibition of β-lactamases using the commercially available substrate Fluorocillin.[4] The reliability of the system was evaluated on three different class B MBLs: New-Delhi-Metallo- β-Lactamase-1 (NDM-1), Verona-Integron-Encoded-Metallo-β-Lactamase 1 (VIM-1) and Impenemase-7 (IMP-7). Remarkably, not all compounds inhibited MBLs, although every compound carried a thiol group. In order to discriminate between zinc-withdrawing and direct binding to the enzyme, thermal shift assay was conducted. This assay combination provides a method to find inhibitors which inhibit MBLs via direct binding to the active site.[5] Most promising compounds were passed to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using laboratory strains and patient isolates. Results showed that some of our compounds partially restored the efficacy of Imipenem against pathogenic bacteria. Overall, we found four approved drugs, which inhibit three clinically important MBLs, namely Captopril, Thiorphan, Dimercaprol and Tiopronin. This result yields a good starting point for the development of potent MBL inhibitors, with the primary optimization goal being the uptake and activity in pathogens.\n\n[1] M. a Fischbach, C. T.

Cann1\n\n1School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Durham University, 2Department of Chemistry, Durham University\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is a crucial regulator for all three domains of life (1), known for its role during respiration and photosynthesis. Despite this there is very little known about its molecular interactions with cellular components. CO2 combines rapidly but reversibly with amines at physiological temperatures and pressures to form carbamates (2). This modification is present in key proteins, such as RuBisCO and haemoglobin but remains unexplored in other systems. Carbamylation is caused by the nucleophilic attack of an uncharged amine (for example on an arginine or lysine side chain or an N-terminal group) on CO2 (2). This research aims to investigate this understudied modification.\n\nWe are resolving these limitations to investigate carbamate formation in cellular systems by trapping carbamates chemically thereby removing their labile nature3. We are developing chemical and analytical tools to meet this challenge. Main results: We have successfully proven the ability to trap carbamates on acetyl-lysine, Lys-Gly and Phe-Gly dipeptides, a tetra-peptide and haemoglobin. These results have been confirmed using ESI-MS combined with 12C and 13C isotope incorporation. Further work using radioactive 14C has been carried out on whole organism samples.\n\n1. Tang, X.

More particularly, increased cell proliferation, migration, angiogenic induction and modifications to the tumor environment require elevated protein synthesis and turnover. Surprisingly, the only FDA-approved anticancer drugs that targets protein metabolism in cancer cells are recently launched proteasomal inhibitors and omacetaxine mepesuccinate, a translation elongation inhibitor. Regulation of protein synthesis in tumor cells differs significantly from their non-transformed counterparts due to alterations in MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways, two major signal transduction pathways that control initiation of translation. There is thus significant interest in the development of novel inhibitors of translation as potential anti-neoplastic agents. Purpose and results: In a previous study, we reported novel substituted β-carbolines as protein synthesis inhibitors (Frederick and Bruyere et al, 2012). CM16, the lead compound optimized in terms of pharmacological properties (Meinguet et al, 2015), was used to start to decipher their mode of action. CM16 exerts cytostatic anti-cancer effects in vitro without significant modification of the cell cycle profile. The National Cancer Institute COMPARE algorithm enabled us to compare the global growth inhibition profile of CM16 on 60 cancer cell lines (mean GI50 of 0.2 µM) to the >765,000 compounds of their database and revealed good correlation coefficients with protein synthesis inhibitors. Effects of CM16 on transcription could appear secondary since we didn’t observed any effects before prolonged compound incubation on cells - at least 24h exposure to 5 µM CM16. In contrast, translation was quite sensitive to CM16, as assessed by metabolic labeling assays. Ribosomal subunit assembly and polysome profiling of cells exposed to CM16 were evaluated by sucrose gradient analysis. Exposure of cells to CM16 for only 3h was sufficient to disrupt polysomes and cause an increase in 80S complexes. Ongoing investigations of the expression and phosphorylation status of different initiation and elongation factors identified eIF2α; as a potential target of CM16. This effect unlikely results from a direct activity of CM16 on PERK, one of four eIF2α; kinases. CM16 penetrates into the cancer cells after few minutes of treatment and its distribution parallels an endoplasmic reticulum fluorescent probe. Interestingly, non-transformed cells are ∼10 times less sensitive to CM16. Conclusions and Perspectives: CM16 is a synthetic harmine derivative that displays anti-neoplastic activity in vitro at concentrations of 0.1 to 0.5 µM. It appears to inhibit protein synthesis at the level of the initiation phase within in the first 3 hours following exposure to cells. Differences in the dependencies on deregulated protein synthesis in normal versus transformed cells appear to be exploitable for the development of new anti-cancer agents. Additional proteomic studies will be conducted in the near future to further our understanding of this concept and the effects of CM16.\n\nPB-017\n\nSemi-chemical synthesis and characterization of a small heat shock protein bearing a nonenzymatic posttranslational modification found in vivo\n\nMaria Matveenko1, Christian Becker1\n\n1Institute of Biological Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Vienna\n\nUp to 50% of all human proteins are believed to be modified following their biosynthesis through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) [1]. PTMs can result from enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions, and both types of modifications play an important role in a plethora of physiological and pathological processes [2,3]. Nonenzymatic modifications (NEMs) are increasingly recognized to affect cellular processes, with an involvement in age-related, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases [4,5]. Human heat shock protein (Hsp27) has been shown to become derivatized with argpyrimidine, a prominent NEM that occurs on arginine residues [6], in certain human cancer tissues and cell lines [7,8]. This NEM was linked to the elevated antiapoptotic activity of the protein [7,8], whereby modification of Arg-188 appeared to be of particular significance [7]. In this work, Hsp27 homogeneously modified with argpyrimidine at position 188 is generated for the first time. Using expressed protein ligation [9], the first semisynthesis of the unmodified protein is achieved as well. Our approach, which combines organic chemistry, peptide synthesis and protein synthesis, enables complete control over protein composition and thus can provide previously unattainable insight into the properties of this vital chaperone following nonenzymatic modification. The synthesis of argpyrimidine-modified Hsp27 and the progress towards structural and functional characterization of the protein will be presented herein.\n\n[1] Khoury, G.A., Baliban, R.C., Floudas, C.A.

Members of this family are typically inhibitors of proteases of serine class. Interestingly, a few members were identified as inhibitors of proteases of cysteine class, however, they have not been functionally and structurally characterized. Our study is focused on Kunitz-type inhibitors of cysteine proteases (PCPIs) from potato (Solanum tuberosum). A series of 20 kDa PCPIs was purified using a multi-step chromatographical protocol, and two most abundant and effective isoinhibitors named PCI 1-5 and PCI 3 were characterized in detail. They were screened against a broad panel of model cysteine proteases and digestive cysteine proteases from herbivorous insects. PCI 1-5 and PCI 3 exhibit different inhibitory specificity pattern and potency up to the nanomolar range. Both isoinhibitors were crystallized and their spatial structures were solved and refined at 1.5 Å (PCI 1-5) and 1.7 Å (PCI 3) resolutions. A position of reactive sites against cysteine proteases on the conserved β-trefoil fold scaffold was proposed. The work provides the first analysis of PCPIs with respect to the structure-function relationships and evolution within the Kunitz-type inhibitor family.\n\nPB-019\n\nRole of the ABCC2 transporter in the mode of action of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin in the Diamond Back Moth Plutella xylostella\n\nJosué Ocelotl1, Jorge Sánchez2, Raquel Arroyo1, Isabel Gómez1, Gopalan Unnithan2, Bruce Tabashnik2, Alejandra Bravo1, Mario Soberón1\n\n1Instituto de Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 2Department of Entomology, University of Arizona\n\nDue to being environmentally friendly and highly specific to their target insect, Bacillus thuringiensis three domain-Cry toxins (Bt toxins) are widely used as an alternative to chemical insecticides in formulations or in transgenic expression. To exert their toxic effect the protein crystals that contain this pore forming toxins must be ingested by susceptible insect larvae. Once in the midgut, the crystal is solubilized and activated by gut proteases. The protease resistant fragment, composed of three domains is able to interact with different insect proteins located in the apical membrane of the gut epithelium, putative Cry-toxins binding proteins include cadherin (CADR), aminopeptidase-N (APN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Current model for the mode of action involves a low affinity interaction of Cry1A toxins with the highly abundant GPI-anchored-receptors, ALP and APN which concentrates the toxin close to the microvilli membrane, here the toxin binds in a high affinity interaction to the cadherin receptor, this event promotes the proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal end including helix α-1 triggering the formation of an oligomer structure. The binding of oligomeric Cry1A structure to ALP and APN facilitates insertion of this pre-pore into the membrane causing pore-formation and cell lysis. It is known that mutations resulting in diminished or lack of expression of Cry-toxin binding proteins result in high levels of resistance of the insect pests. In recent years, a novel resistance mechanism involving an ABC transporter (ABCC2) has been reported in four lepidopteran insects, Helothis virescens YEE and YHD3 strains, Plutella xylostella NO-QA strain, Bombyx mori C2 strain and Trichoplusia ni GlenBtR strain. Although some studies have suggested that the ABCC2 transporter could be a receptor for Bt toxins in this insect pests, the precise role of this membrane protein in the mode of action of Cry toxins remains unclear. Interestingly insects with mutations in the ABCC2 transporter or cadherin show high resistance levels to Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac toxins but are susceptible to mutant toxins named Cry1AbMod or Cry1AC Mod, in which the N-terminal end of the toxin including helix-α1was deleted, these proteins do not require the presence of cadherin to form oligomeric structures. We analyzed and compared the binding interactions of Cry1Ac and Cry1AcMod toxins with brush border membranes from susceptible and resistant populations of P. xylostella and P. gossypiella, which display different Cry-toxin resistance mechanisms, ABCC2 or cadherin. Our data shows that ABCC2 and cadherin are involved in Cry1Ac toxin oligomerization in P. xylostella and P. gossypiella respectively showing that these receptor molecules fulfill the same role in the mode of action of Cry1Ac in different insect species.\n\nPB-020\n\nMetabolic alkene labeling and in vitro detection of histone acylation via the aqueous oxidative Heck reaction\n\nMaria-Eleni Ourailidou1, Paul Dockerty1, Martin Witte1, Gerrit J. Poelarends1, Frank J. Dekker1,\n\n1University of Groningen\n\nThe detection of protein lysine acylations remains a challenge due to lack of specific antibodies for acylations with various chain lengths. This problem can be addressed by metabolic labeling techniques using carboxylates with reactive functionalities. Subsequent chemoselective reactions with a complementary moiety connected to a detection tag enable the visualization and quantification of the protein lysine acylome. In this study, we present EDTA-Pd(II) as a novel catalyst for the oxidative Heck reaction on protein-bound alkenes, which allows employment of fully aqueous reaction conditions. We used this reaction to monitor histone lysine acylation in vitro after metabolic incorporation of olefinic carboxylates as chemical reporters.\n\nPB-021\n\n“Study of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac protoxins interaction with cadherin-like receptor from Manduca sexta”\n\nArlen Peña-Cardeña1, Alejandra Bravo1, Mario Soberón1, Isabel Gómez1,\n\n1Instituto de Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México\n\nThe Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces insecticidal crystal proteins (Cry toxins) to control insect pests. Cry toxins are recognized as pore forming toxins that kill larval epithelium midgut cells by causing an osmotic shock leading to cell lysis. To induce the pore formation of Cry toxins, the parasporal crystals have to be ingested by susceptible larva, solubilized by the pH conditions of the insect gut, and activated by midgut proteases to yield the resistant core of the activated toxin. In the case of Cry toxins that are active against lepidopteran insects, it has been shown that Cry1A toxins undergo a sequential binding mechanism with glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol anchored proteins such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or aminopeptidase-N (APN) and cadherin-like protein resulting in the formation of a pre-pore oligomeric structure that is proficient in membrane insertion and pore formation. Receptor recognition by Cry toxins has been recognized as a key step of Cry toxicity that is fundamental for insect specificity. Previously we reported that Cry1Ab protoxin or activated toxin bind cadherin-like receptor with similar affinities and two different pre-pores are produced depending on which of these molecules interacts with cadherin in the presence of insect midgut proteases. Here we test the interaction with a second protoxin the Cry1Ac that share 85% of identity with Cry1Ab and both have similar toxicity against Manduca sexta larva. However, we observe that Cry1Ac protoxin has no interaction with cadherin-like receptor as Cry1Ab, our results suggest that another protein may act as receptor for Cry1Ac protoxin.\n\nPB-022\n\nProton solvation in protic and aprotic solvents\n\nEmanuele Rossini1, Ernst-Walter Knapp1\n\n1Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Freie Universität Berlin\n\nProtonation pattern influence actively properties of molecules and play an essential role in biochemical mechanisms. For an accurate determination of the protonation equilibria, the absolute proton solvation free energy needs to be known. The determination of this energy represents one of the most challenging problems in physical chemistry. This is particularly difficult for protons solvated in water, where the solvation is dynamically performed by different water clusters and the proton is not attached to a single solvent molecule. The proton solvation is notably important in order to quantify mechanisms of proton transfer and such processes have been investigated for a long time based on different approaches, often leading to contradictory conclusions. A rigorous and accurate protocol for computing proton solvation in solvents of different nature is of prime importance for applied (pharmaceutical and material science) and fundamental sciences. In this study, proton affinities, electrostatic energies of solvation and pKa values of a reference set of organic molecules are computed in protic and aprotic solvents. Proportional to the free energy of proton dissociation, the pKa value calculation is therefore strongly dependent on the free energy of proton solvation. Such energy is then determined in acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MET), water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in order to obtain the best possible match between measured and computed pKa values. The computation of these values is based on a combination of quantum chemical (QC) and electrostatic approaches by using a thermodynamic cycle connecting gas-phase and solvent-phase of proton dissociation. The computed proton solvation energies in ACN, MET, water and DMSO of the present study are very precise (RMSD much lower than 1 pH value). They will be a basis for better understanding of proton solvation and help to predict pKa values of organic compounds in different solvents more precise.\n\nPB-023\n\nBiochemical characterization of two evolutionary distant ten-eleven translocation enzymes and their utility in 5-methylcytosine sequencing in the genomes at single-base resolution\n\nLana Saleh1, Esta Tamanaha, June Pais1, Romualdas Vaisvila1, Nan Dai1, Shengxi Guan1, Ivan Correa1, Christopher Noren1, Richard Roberts1, Yu Zheng1\n\n1New England biolabs\n\nThe ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes iteratively oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) on DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxycytosine. Here, we examine the in vitro biochemical activity of two evolutionary distant TETs, mTET1 from mouse and NgTET1 from the single-celled protist Naegleria gruberi. We show that both of these enzymes are 5-methylpyrimidine oxygenases with activity on both 5mC (major activity) and thymidine (T) (minor activity) and preference to 5mCpG and TpG dinucleotide sites. Intriguingly, NgTET1 displays higher T oxidation activity in vitro than mTET1 supporting a closer evolutionary relationship between NgTET1 and the base J binding proteins from trypanosomes. In fact, unprecedented evidence for the formation of two new bases, 5-formyluridine and 5-carboxyuridine, is shown for NgTET1 activity in vitro. Mutagenesis studies performed in NgTET1 reveal a delicate balance between choice of 5mC or T as the preferred substrate. Steady-state kinetic analysis show that both mTET1 and NgTET1 are distributive in their oxidative chemistry with each oxidized species released from the enzyme upon formation. Furthermore, both enzymes are physically distributive in the recognition of their substrates on template DNA with no apparent preference to a specific 5mC oxidation intermediate. These data indicate a role for the TET enzymes in the maintenance of the three oxidized forms of 5mC and suggest that these bases are not simply intermediates in a methylation cycle but represent additional epigenetic states in genomic DNA with regulatory functions to be explored. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of both enzymes in 5mC sequencing technologies and present examples for the mapping of 5mC in different genomes at base resolution.\n\nPB-024\n\nContribution of Connexin37 Gene Polymorphism (C1019T) in the Incidence of Acute Myocardial Infarction in the Egyptians\n\nFadwa El Tahry1, Ingy Hashad1, Mohamed Farouk1, Mohamed Gad1\n\n1German University In Cairo (GUC)\n\nContribution of Connexin37 Gene Polymorphism (C1019T) in the Incidence of Acute Myocardial Infarction in the Egyptians Fadwa A. El Tahry1, Ingy M. Hashad1, Mohamed F. Abdel Rahman1, Mohamed Z. Gad1 Clinical Biochemistry unit1 Faculty of pharmacy and Biotechnology, German University in Cairo, Egypt Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and in Egypt. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the main outcome of ischemia, is caused mainly by atherosclerosis. Connexin 37 (Cx37) protein plays a protective role by decreasing the monocyte adhesion, therefore delaying the initiation of atherosclerosis and as a result the incidence of AMI. Gap junctions are protein structures present between cells that help in the electrical and metabolic coupling of cells. Their building subunits are connexins. To date 21 connexins (Cxs) have been identified in humans. CX37 is one of the Cxs forming the gap junction protein family. It is expressed mainly on vascular endothelial cells and monocytes. Several studies reported a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C1019T in CX37 gene as a prognostic marker for atherosclerosis. Aim of work: To investigate the contribution of C1019T gene polymorphism of CX37 in the predisposition of AMI in the Egyptians. Subjects and Methods: The study consisted of 114 AMI patients and 100 controls. Blood was taken after taking a written consent from all subjects and the approval of the ethical committees of EL Demrdash hospital and the German university in Cairo. DNA was extracted from the whole blood using Thermo-scientific DNA extraction kit. The frequency of the genotypes (CC, TT and CT) was determined by (PCR-RFLP) using Drd I restriction enzyme. Results: The genotype distribution of CX37 gene in AMI patients was (CC 15.78%, TT 11.40%, CT 72.80%) while in controls (CC 27%, TT 18%, CT 55%) (p =0.516). On the other hand, the alleles frequencies of AMI patients were (C allele=52.19%, T allele= 47.80%) and in control subjects (C allele= 54.5%, T allele=45.5%(p=0.697). Conclusion: The CX 37 gene polymorphism (C1019T) is not associated with the incidence of AMI in the Egyptians.\n\nPB-025\n\nDelineating toxin:lipid:ion channel interactions for rationally sodium channel inhibitors design\n\nChristina Schroeder1, Sónia Henriques2, Mehdi Mobli2, Stephanie Chaousis1, Phillip Walsh1, Panumart Thongyoo1, David Craik1\n\n1Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, 2Centre for Advanced Imaging, The University of Queensland\n\nIn recent years, certain voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) subtypes have emerged as validated chronic pain targets with loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in both NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 subtypes leading to an inability to perceive pain and painful neuropathies, respectively. However, as NaV ion channels are intimately involved in almost all aspects of physiology, only the most selective inhibitors would be suitable as drug leads. Disulfide-rich venom derived mini-proteins from cone snails and spiders are being actively pursued as novel therapeutics for pain, because of their high selectivity and potency at human ion channels, including sodium channels (NaV). Two main strategies of inhibition have been identified; blocking the pore and interacting with the voltage-sensor domains (VSD) surrounding the pore. The ion-conducting pore is highly conserved between all sodium channel subtypes whereas the voltage-sensor domain binding sites are less conserved. Therefore, inhibition of a specific NaV isoform is more achievable using inhibitors that modulate VSDs than with pore blockers. Gating modifier toxins from spider and cone snail venom inhibit NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 by interacting with the VSD. They appear to reach their target by partitioning into the lipid membrane surrounding the ion channel, thus enabling access to the VSD. Toxin pharmacology may therefore not only be driven by the peptide-ion channel interactions, but also including the lipids surrounding the channel protein, a feature that is very much under explored. It is therefore apparent that peptide-lipid interactions in combination with peptide-channel interactions need to be considered when designing potent inhibitors. Using a range of biophysical techniques, including surface plasmon resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance, we are studying the interactions underpinning the mechanism of action between toxins and membranes and toxins and ion channels. Initial results show that the lipid composition surrounding ion channels play a major role in terms of toxin:lipid interaction and that these interactions can be used in combination with traditional structure-activity relationship studies to design selective and potent NaV inhibitors, which will be discussed. We believe that our studies will ultimately delineate what drives toxin pharmacology and NaV subtype selectivity and will lead to improve rationally engineering of novel therapeutics for the treatment of pain.\n\nPB-026\n\nMicelles promote Aß42 assembly into pore-forming oligomers\n\nMontserrat Serra-Batiste1, Mariam Bayoumi2, Margarida Gairí3, Martí Ninot-Pedrosa1, Giovanni Maglia2, Natàlia Carulla1\n\n1Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), 2Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section, University of Leuven, 3NMR Facility, Scientific and Technological Centers, University of Barcelona\n\nThe formation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) oligomers at the cellular membrane is considered to be a crucial process underlying neurotoxicity in Alzheimeŕs disease (AD). 1-2 Therefore, it is important to understand how oligomers form within a membrane environment. Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, combined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC), we have studied the two major Aβ variants— Aβ40 and Aβ42, the latter having a more prominent role in AD than the former—under carefully selected micelle conditions intended to mimic a membrane environment. Our results indicate that after an incubation period, Aβ42, but not Aβ40, assembles into oligomers with specific structural properties, which we have named Stabilized Micelle Oligomers (SMOs). SMO complexes incorporate into lipid bilayers as well-defined pores, a feature linked to neurotoxicity. These results have important implications in the AD field as they provide a new perspective on how Aβ oligomers cause neurotoxicity. Indeed, our findings constitute a first step towards the establishment of a new therapeutic target for AD. 3\n\n1. S. M. Butterfield, H. A.

The series of reactions catalyzed by ThrS encompasses many regiospecific and stereospecific steps, which are controlled by the enzyme protein, However, the precise mechanism of the reaction control (product-assisted catalysis) is not fully elucidated. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ThrS were performed with the thermodynamics integration approach, and the accurate free energy differences between the key intermediates were evaluated by changing the phosphate ion to a sulfate ion. It is already known experimentally that the phosphate ion is one of the products of the enzyme reaction and plays an important role in the catalytic reaction. The free energy differences between the ions were well reproduced theoretically for the key intermediate states. By performing additional 100ns MDs, we analyzed the substrate conformations. We found that the substrate conformations are changed by the reaction-controlling ions. This finding suggests that the controlling of the substrate conformation will be an important molecular mechanism for the product-assisted catalysis.\n\nPB-028\n\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens employs two distinct ClpS adaptors to modulate the N-end rule degradation pathway\n\nBenjamin J. Stein1, Robert A. Grant1, Robert T. Sauer1, Tania A. Baker1,2\n\n1Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe N-end rule is a widely conserved proteolytic pathway, in which the N-terminal amino acid of a protein determines its in vivo stability. In E. coli and C. crescentus, the ClpS adaptor protein recognizes destabilizing N-termini and delivers them to the ClpAP AAA+ protease for degradation. Unlike the majority of proteobacteria, most α-proteobacteria contain two paralogs of ClpS, ClpS1 and ClpS2. Here, we investigate the binding specificity of the ClpS1 and ClpS2 proteins from A. tumefaciens. We demonstrate that both ClpS1 and ClpS2 deliver N-end rule substrates to ClpA, but ClpS2 has a narrower binding specificity than ClpS1. Importantly, crystal structures of ClpS2 reveal conformational changes in the substrate-binding pocket that are critical for N-end rule recognition. Moreover, we find evidence that ClpS1 and ClpS2 are differentially expressed in A. tumefaciens. We conclude that A. tumefaciens contains two ClpS proteins with differing N-terminal binding specificities, allowing fine-tuning of N-end rule recognition at the level of adaptor proteins.\n\nPB-029\n\nInteractions between U24 from HHV-6A and 7 and Nedd4 or Smurf2 WW domains\n\nYurou Sang1, Rui Zhang1, Walter R.P. Scott1, A. Louise Creagh2, Charles A. Haynes2, Suzana K. Straus1\n\n1Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, 2036 Main Mall, 2Michael Smith Labs, University of British Columbia\n\nU24 is a protein found in both Human Herpes Virus type 6A (HHV-6A) and type 7 (HHV-7), with an N-terminus which is rich in prolines (PPxY motif in both HHV-6A and 7; PxxP motif in HHV-6A). Previous work tested the hypothesis that U24 may be implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), because of a shared seven residue sequence identity between U24 and myelin basic protein (MBP), a key protein in the progression of MS. Our study showed however that the binding between U24 (via the PxxP motif) and its interaction partner Fyn-SH3 was weak [1]. The current study examines the interaction of U24 (via the PPxY motif) with WW domains, small protein-protein interaction domains of approximately 40 residues that derive their name from two highly conserved tryptophan residues, usually spaced 22-23 amino-acids apart. The interaction between U24 and WW domains is deemed to be important for endocytic recycling of T-cell receptors [2]. Binding affinities of a number of U24-WW pairs were determined in order to identify whether a specific binding partner exists. Data from ITC, NMR and molecular dynamics simulations will be presented and discussed in light of the function of U24 in disease, with a particular focus on MS.\n\n[1]- Y. Sang, A.R. Tait, W.R.P.

The disulfide-stabilized fusion loop of Ebola GP2 is extended on the surface of circulating virus, but forms a compact hydrophobic “fist” in the Nieman-Pick late endosomal compartment. The pH-induced conformational change of the EboV fusion loop enables the virus to escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm where it replicates causing severe hemorrhagic fever in infected individuals. We determined the structure of the EboV fusion loop and several fusion-compromised mutants by NMR. The results show that the fist is stabilized by a hydrophobic triad consisting of a leucine, an isoleucine and a phenyalanine residue. The fist interacts with residues in the membrane-proximal and transmembrane domains of GP2, the structures of which we also determined by NMR, to catalyze membrane fusion and virus entry into the cytoplasm. These protein interactions that involve a dramatic refolding of the protein at the membrane surface provide potential targets for drug discovery and new strategies for vaccine development.

The complex is composed of four copies of four subunits: α, β, γ and δ. The α, β and δ; subunits regulate the catalytic γ; subunit through quaternary constraints that inhibit its activity. Upon binding allosteric effectors or the covalent modification of the regulatory subunits, the γ subunit is activated. Despite nearly six decades of investigation, the subunit-interactions responsible for the inhibition and activation of the γ subunit are still largely unknown. Due to PhK’s large size (1.3 megadaltons), studying its structure is challenging, but chemical crosslinking has proved a valuable tool to study interactions among its α, β, γ; and δ; subunits before and after activation by phosphorylation. Here we report selective, zero-length crosslinking of the regulatory β subunits of PhK by the general oxidizing agent periodate, even at concentrations as low as µM. SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, Western blot analysis, and size-exclusion chromatography were used to characterize crosslinked PhK and to identify the products formed. Oxidation of non-activated PhK at pH 6.8 with periodate produced a β-dimer, making periodate the most effective crosslinking agent to produce this homodimer. When periodate crosslinking of non-activated PhK was carried out in the presence of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 22 residues of β (Nβ peptide) known to compete with its counterpart region in the native enzyme and disrupt interactions between the β and γ subunits, there was an increased amount of β-dimer formation. It should be noted that this Nβ peptide contains the autophosphorylatable Ser-11 associated with PhK activation, and phosphorylated Nβ; peptide was considerably less effective in promoting β-dimer formation than non-phosphorylated peptide. These results suggest a role for Ser-11 autophosphorylation in mediating homodimeric β subunit interactions within the PhK complex, and augment previous studies on the activation of PhK by phosphorylation in which changes at the N-terminus of β are critical in the activation of the catalytic γ subunit. Summing these results leads to a new model of activation. In this model, in the inactive state, the nonphosphorylated N-terminus of β interacts directly or indirectly with the regulatory C-terminal domain of the γ subunit, inhibiting catalytic activity. Upon phosphorylation of the N-terminus of β, three important events occur: 1) the interaction between β and γ is disrupted, 2) the β subunits of the holoenzyme self-associate, and 3) the catalytic domain is activated. Thus, we envision that the N-terminus of β acts as an allosteric switch, with activation triggered by phosphorylation of this region, causing disruption of its previously inhibiting interactions with γ and promotion of β β dimerization to stabilize the activated conformation of γ.\n\nThe research was supported financially by the University of Kansas Medical Center Biomedical Research Training Program and NIH Grant DK32953.\n\nPB-032\n\nhSSB1 is involved in the cellular response to oxidative DNA damage\n\nChristine Touma1, Nicolas Paquet2, Derek J. Richard2, Roland Gamsjaeger1,3, Liza Cubeddu1,3\n\n1School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, 2Queensland University of Te chnology, 3School of Molecular Bioscience, University of Sydney\n\nCellular DNA is subject to oxidative damage in the presence of reactive oxygen species. The 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) adduct is the most common form of oxidative damage and results in G:C to T:A transversions; these lesions are normally processed by the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. Single-stranded binding (SSB) proteins of the oligonucleotide binding domain family are heavily involved in DNA repair processes, which involve the detection of DNA damage and recruitment of repair proteins to the site of damage. Using immunofluorescence we demonstrate that hSSB1 (a novel human SSB) levels increase in response to oxidative damage (H202). Cells depleted of hSSB1 are hypersensitive to oxidative damage and are also unable to efficiently remove 8-oxoG adducts. We show that hSSB1 forms dimers and tetramers under oxidative conditions and that this oligomerisation is likely mediated by inter-domain disulfide bond formation. Furthermore, using Surface Plasmon Resonance, we also show that oxidised hSSB1 binds to 8-oxo-G damaged ssDNA with higher affinity than non-damaged ssDNA, indicating a direct role for oxidised hSSB1 in the recognition of 8-oxo-G lesions. As oxidative stress is associated with aging, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, understanding the molecular mechanisms of how cells repair oxidative DNA damage will be crucial in the development of potential therapeutic treatments.\n\nPB-033\n\nVirtual Screening for Novel Inhibitors of Acetoacetyl-CoA Reductase of Burkholderia pseudomallei\n\nLuis Valencia1,2, Josh Beckham, Oscar Villarreal, Jon Robertus\n\n1University of Texas at Austin, 2Freshman Research Initiative\n\nBurkholderia pseudomallei is a gram-negative bacteria that causes the disease melioidosis, a potentially chronic and aggressive infection with a mortality rate of up to 90% and is listed as a category B critical biological agent by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The glyoxylate metabolism pathway of B. pseudomallei carries out the metabolism of fatty acids – a function responsible for the virulent ability of B. pseudomallei to survive after being engulfed by the host’s macrophages. Virtual screening on the structure of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, a protein suggested to be essential in the glyoxylate pathway of B. pseudomallei, was conducted using GOLD molecular docking program to identify potentially novel inhibitor ligands from large virtual chemical libraries. The gene sequence of the acetoacetyl-CoA was assembled through overlap PCR and inserted into the expression vector pNIC-Bsa4 using ligation independent cloning. The protein was then expressed using IPTG induction of the T7 polymerase Lac operon system in BL21(DE3) cells, purified using His-tag Ni- NTA affinity chromatography, and characterized using SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic activity was confirmed by using a spectrophotometric enzyme assay measuring the absorbance of NADPH at 340nm during the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA into (R)−3-Hydroxy-butanoyl-CoA. From the virtual screening of 30,000 ligands of the Chembridge Diversity Library against the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase structure the highest scoring ligands were selected and ordered for inhibition assay experiments. Current research objectives involve identification of novel inhibitors from inhibition assays, determination of enzyme kinetics, and the development of an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase structure with ligands or inhibitors bound in the active site.\n\nPB-034\n\nUse of Principal Component Analysis and Molecular Docking to Identify Novel Selective Plasmepsin II Non-Competitive Inhibitors with Antimalarial Activity\n\nPedro Alberto Valiente Flores1, Maarten G Wolf2, Yasel Guerra3, Isel Pascual1, Isabelle Florent4, Enrique Rudiño3, Pedro Geraldo Pascutti5, Tirso Pons6, Gerrit Groenhof2\n\n1Center of Protein Studies, Faculty of Biology, University of Havana., 2Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry, 3Biotechnology Institute. UNAM, 4CNRS-MNHN, 5Biophysics Institute. Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, 6Spanish National Cancer Research Centre\n\nPlasmepsin II (PlmII) is an aspartic protease involved in the initial steps of the hemoglobin degradation pathway, a critical stage in the Plasmodium falciparum life cycle during human infection. However, most of the PlmII inhibitors obtained through structure-based ligand design have generally shown a low selectivity towards the human related protease Cathepsin D (hCatD), which is a notable drawback to their use as antimalarial drugs. Here, we presented a novel in silico approach based on the combined use of principal component analysis and molecular docking to identify non-competitive selective inhibitors of PlmII. We searched unique conformational states of PlmII that can not be adopted by the human aspartic proteases: Cathepsin D, Renin and Pepsin by comparing the conformational subspaces sampled by these proteins along molecular dynamic simulations of 1.2 µs. Specific conformations along the flap opening-siding mode of PlmII that can not be sampled by the human counterparts were identified. The specific conformations were used to perform virtual screening experiments and proposed putative PlmII selective-inhibitors. The hCatD was also targeted to exclude non-selective compounds. The first five ranked inhibitors, with inhibition constants (Ki) values in the µM-nM range, target a cryptic flap interior pocket formed by the residues M75, V82, V105, T108, and Y115 which is only exposed in the PlmII specific conformations. The inhibition assays showed that the inhibitors bind better PlmII than hCatD in a range from 70 to 100-fold of their Ki values. The kinetic characterization showed a non-competitive inhibition of PlmII for all the compounds. Molecular docking calculations suggest that these compounds probably target the other three Plms expressed in the digestive vacuole of Pf. Notably two of them (SPB07935 and HTS07519) inhibited red blood cell cultures infected with the Pf cloroquine resistant strain FcB1 with an IC50 value in the µM range.\n\nPB-035\n\nAin’t gold all that glitters: missing gold atoms in the structure of lysozyme crystals used to co-crystallize gold nanoparticles\n\nAntonello Melrino1, Irene Russo Krauss2, Marco Caterino1, Alessandro Vergara1\n\n1Dept. Chemical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 2Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR\n\nWei et al. (2011) reported the growth of gold nanoparticles within protein single crystals of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) [1]. We tried to reproduce the experiments performed by these authors obtaining red, well-diffracting crystals of HEWL after 1 month of soaking in the presence of the gold-nanoparticle precursor ClAuS(CH2CH2OH)2. However, when refining our crystal structures we found no gold atoms.[2] This finding prompted us to analyze the models by Wei et al. deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 3P4Z, 3P64, 3P65, 3P66, 3P68), where nine different gold atoms are present (four isolated gold atoms and a 5-atom cluster). For eight out of the nine gold atoms found in the structures deposited by Wei et al., we believe that the authors’ interpretation is questionable. [2] Ultimately, three out of five crystal structures solved by Wei et al. likely correspond to HEWL with only one Au+ ion bound to His15, as previously reported in crystal structures of adduct between HEWL and gold-based drugs [3-4]. The last two crystal structures are gold-free. We consider the ability of gold nanoparticles to grow within protein single crystals a stimulating result that has interesting implications. However, the structural analysis by Wei et al cannot be used to unveil protein-gold nanoparticle interactions because no gold atom is unambiguously found in the reported HEWL structures, apart from one ion bound to His15 in the first three structures. This means that structural data on biomolecule-directed gold clusters is still lacking and that the molecular basis of protein-gold nanoparticle recognition requires further investigation.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

This research seeks to find novel inhibitors of β-ketoacyl-ACP-reductase (FabG), an enzyme that catalyzes one of the reactions in the fatty acid synthesis type II system in bacteria. This pathway is essential for survival in bacteria. The FabG enzyme uses NADPH as a substrate, which facilitates the binding of the second substrate, acetoacetyl-ACP into the active site. The acetoacetyl-ACP is subsequently reduced into β-hydroxyacyl-ACP. The coding DNA sequence for the RpFabG protein was cloned into a pNIC vector and transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3), then the protein was expressed and purified using metal affinity and size exclusion chromatography methods. High throughput molecular docking software (GOLD) was used to screen a commercial library of ligands against the acetoacetyl-ACP region of the active site. The ligands with the best GOLD scores were selected to be tested in vitro. Spectrophotometric enzyme inhibition assays were performed to determine whether the drugs could inhibit RpFabG activity. Chlorogenic acid, a previously known inhibitor of homologous FabGs, was tested along with the other potential drugs, and was determined to have moderate inhibitory effects on RpFabG. Loop modeling using ICM software was performed in order to create a prediction of the complete RpFabG structure, including the disordered loops that are not a part of the 3F9I PDB structure. Co-crystallization of RpFabG with both substrates was carried out in order to obtain a structure, but only non-diffracting crystals resulted. Further inhibition assays and crystallography trials are being performed in order to continue the search for a novel inhibitor of RpFabG and ultimately a treatment for epidemic typhus.\n\nPB-037\n\nDiazotransfer reagents to selectively functionalize a protein of interest with azido groups\n\nMartin Witte1, Jonas Lohse1, Remko Welker1\n\n1Stratingh Institute for Chemistry, University of Groningen\n\nThe incorporation of a non-natural functional group onto proteins facilitates studying their role. It also led to the development of protein variants which can be activated (photo)chemically inside cells and it has become an important means to synthesize biopharmaceuticals. The functional group is generally incorporated using auxotrophic strains, amber suppression technology, enzymatic labelling or ligand-tethered labelling.1 These techniques, except for the latter, all require genetic modification and overexpression of the target protein, which can lead to artefacts. Our aim was to develop reagents that enable direct functionalisation of a target protein with a ligation handle in a complex mixture. As requirement, we set that the handle should not only facilitate further modification, but that it should also serve as a potential chemical turn-on/turn-off switch. Conversion of an amine into an azido group fulfils these requirements. It can be modified using bioorthogonal reactions, such as the copper-catalyzed click reaction and the Staudinger ligation. Moreover, modification of essential amine groups in the protein of interest may inhibit protein activity. Reduction of the azido group will give the unmodified target protein and restore the activity, and as such the azido group may also serve as a chemical turn-on/turn-off switch. Van Hest and coworkers revealed that azido groups can be introduced onto purified recombinant proteins using a diazotransfer reaction,2 but the described method cannot be used to selectively modify a proteins of interest within a complex mixture. We reasoned that this issue could be addressed by tethering the diazotransfer reagent to a ligand that binds to the protein of interest. As a proof of concept, we synthesized novel reagents to selectively functionalize the model proteins streptavidin and carbonic anhydrase II. The diazotransfer reagents react selectively with their corresponding target protein in mixture of proteins and when spiked in a cell lysate. Rapid labelling was observed in the presence of Cu(II), but the diazotransfer reaction also occurred in the absence of copper, albeit with reduced efficiency. To identify the site of modification, labelled proteins were analyzed with mass-spectrometry. A single lysine residue is modified in the case of streptavidin and tethering the reagents may thus enhance the site selectivity as well. However, multiple lysine residues were modified in carbonic anhydrase II indicating that careful design of the reagent is required to achieve site selective modification. The experiments with streptavidin and carbonic anhydrase II revealed that targeted diazotransfer reagents can be used to selectively modify a protein of interest, and we are currently extending our approach to other proteins, such as the proteasome.\n\n1 Takaoka, Y.; Ojida, A.; Hamachi, I.

With a high preference the leukotriene A4 hydrolase cleaves tripeptides at an arginyl bond on NH2 position [3]. To screen for new inhibitors of the enzyme we used a growing neural gas (GNG)-based approach for the extraction of the relevant features which we called PENG (pharmacophore elucidation by neural gas). The results of the prospective virtual screening have been validated using a fluorescence-based assay system. Therefore the non-fluorescent substrate L-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride is used. The LTA4H cleaves the arginyl bond what results in the fluorescent 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Additionally, we could show that the PENG approach is able to predict the binding mode of the ligand by X-ray crystallography.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] J.Z. Haeggström, F.

The immobilized CD had pH and temperature optimum of 5 and 50ºC respectively. The immobilized enzyme also stoichiometrically deaminated Cytosine and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) with the apparent K’M values of 0.60 mM and 0.65 mM respectively, displaying activation energy of 10.72 KJ/mol. The immobilization of native CD on calcium alginate beads gave the highest yield of apparent enzymic activity of 51.60% of the original activity and the enzymic activity was lost exponentially at 37ºC over twelve (12) hours with half- life of 5.80 hrs. Hence, the operational stability of native CD can be improved by immobilization on calcium alginate beads.\n\n*Author for correspondence\n\nPB-040\n\nUbiquitin-nanoparticle interactions by solution NMR spectroscopy\n\nSerena Zanzoni1, Michael Assfalg1, Rajesh K Singh2, Marco Pedroni3, Adolfo Speghini3, David Fushman2, Mariapina D’Onofrio1\n\n1NMR Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona, 2Center For Biomolecular Structure and Organization, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, 3Solid State Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona\n\nThe potential use of nanoparticles (NPs) in biomedical applications has attracted considerable interest in the last years. NPs introduced in a biological environment interact with a collection of biomolecules, including proteins. NPs associating with proteins may determine changes in protein conformation, interfere with protein-protein interactions, and affect signal communication pathways [1]. Therefore, the study of NP-induced functional perturbations of proteins implicated in the regulation of key biochemical pathways is particularly relevant. Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small cytosolic protein playing a central role in numerous biological processes including protein degradation, cell signaling, and DNA repair [2]. It can be predicted that its interaction with NPs may affect cellular pathways. In this respect, we characterized, at atomic level, the interactions of Ub with two different size and chemical composition NPs. The first NP that was tested was fullerenol, a polyhydroxylated [60]fullerene NP. These carbon based NPs have several potential biomedical applications, including their use as drug carriers, antiviral drugs, enzyme inhibitors, contrast agents, antioxidants, and photosensitizers [3]. To characterize the fullerenol-Ub interactions, site-resolved chemical shift and intensity perturbations of Ub’s NMR signals, together with 15N spin relaxation rate changes, were used [4]. The obtained data were consistent with interactions involving fullerenol clusters adsorbing reversibly to monomeric Ub (and dimeric Ub), and targeting specific binding epitopes, coincident with functional recognition sites of Ub. Furthermore, we observed that fullerenol almost completely abolished the formation of di-Ub and longer chains in vitro, suggesting that fullerenol NPs may effectively interfere with protein-mediated functional communication, eliciting cytotoxic effects. The second kind of examined NPs were SrF2 NPs. Considerable importance in biomedical luminescence is the application of these NPs doped with rare lanthanide ions, due to their ability to produce up-conversion emission [5]. NMR spectroscopy, up-conversion luminescence measurements and isothermal titration calorimetry were used to probe the Ub-SrF2 NP interactions. As in the case of fullerenol NPs, the analysis of NMR data indicated the occurrence of a reversible equilibrium between free and NP-bound protein forms. The identification of similar interaction epitopes suggests a similar impact on functional biomolecular communication. Our findings support the view that NPs may affect fundamental interaction patterns of Ub, with possible nanotoxic consequences on cell homeostasis. On the other hand, the specific inhibition of critical Ub interactions through competitive binding of NPs to polyUb chains could represent a new potential opportunity for pharmacological intervention against cancer development.\n\nReference:\n\n1.

However, they often have difficulty distinguishing between target proteins that are highly homologous to each other. To address this deficiency and achieve high specificity, we are developing molecules that can covalently target a reactive feature in the target protein. The reactive feature, in the form of a cysteine residue near a ligand-binding pocket, can be naturally present or engineered via mutagenesis in the protein of interest. Using this chemical-genetic approach, we successfully identified specific inhibitors for a single isoform of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. These isoform-selective Eph inhibitors allow us to evaluate the role of individual Eph kinases in cells. In addition, we applied the chemical-genetic approach to the study of the Raf serine/threonine kinases, a key player in the MAPK/ERK pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) that plays an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Surprisingly, the selective inhibitors of oncogenic BRAF generated in this manner were unable to completely block the MAPK signaling in cells, which we attribute to the transactivation of endogenous wide-type RAF in cells. These results suggest that a pan-RAF inhibitor is required for suppression the MAPK signaling in cancer cells. These findings have direct implications for the drug resistance observed in the clinic and the development of second-generation melanoma therapies.\n\nPB-042\n\nSelective modification of proteins and peptides by ruthenium porphyrin-catalyzed carbene transfer reaction\n\nChi-Ming Ho1, Jun-Long Zhang1, Cong-Ying Zhou1, On-Yee Chan1, Jessie Jing Yan1, Fu-Yi Zhang1, Jie-Sheng Huang1, Chi-Ming Che1\n\n1The University of Hong Kong\n\nBioconjugation of proteins has emerged as a useful tool in the study of biological systems. There is an increasing need to develop new synthetic technologies for the bioconjugation reaction of proteins, and metal-catalyzed site-selective modification of proteins has attracted considerable interest in recent years. We have developed a ruthenium glycosylated porphyrin-catalyzed carbenoid transfer reaction for the site-selective modification of proteins. We firstly applied the catalysis to the selective modification of the N-terminus of peptides. By using ruthenium glycosylated porphyrin as catalyst, the N-terminus of a number of peptides can be modified through carbenoid N-H bond insertion in aqueous media with moderate to excellent conversion. The reaction is highly selective, for example, the reaction with YTSSSKNVVR, which contains various types of oxygen–hydrogen and nitrogen–hydrogen bonds possibly available for carbenoid insertion, catalyzed by the ruthenium glycosylated porphyrin gave the N-terminal-modified product with >99% conversion and without the formation of other modified peptides including doubly modified and oxygen–hydrogen bond insertion products. We next extended the N-terminal modification method to proteins. Eventually success was attained in the modification of RNase A and insulin. The reaction of RNase A with a diazoacetate mediated by ruthenium glycosylated porphyrin gave corresponding N-terminal-modified protein with 65% conversion. We also achieved a bioconjugation to ubiquitin via ruthenium glycosylated porphyrin-catalyzed alkene cyclopropanation in aqueous solution in two steps: (1) incorporation of an alkenic group by the reaction of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester with ubiquitin and (2) cyclopropanation of the alkene-tethered Lys6 ubiquitin with the fluorescent labeled diazoacetate in the presence of a catalytic amount of ruthenium glycosylated porphyrin. The corresponding cyclopropanation product was obtained with ∼ 55% conversion based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In conclusion, we developed a ruthenium porphyrin-catalyzed site-selective modification of peptides and proteins in aqueous media. The method provides an entry to new bioconjugation reactions for protein modifications using metalloporphyrins as catalysts.\n\nPB-043\n\nModulating the affinities of phophopeptides to human Pin1 WW domain using 4-substituted proline derivatives\n\nJia-Cherng Horng1, Kuei-Yen Huang1\n\n1Department of Chemistry, National Tsing Hua University\n\nHuman Pin1 is involved in cancer developments and has been a pharmaceutical target.
