        "text": "Brazilian giants Fluminense, Argentina champions Velez Sarsfield, Ecuador's Liga de Quito and Paraguay's Cerro Porteno complete the Copa Sudamericana quarter-finals after winning their last 16 ties on Thursday.\n\nFluminense, who had lost 2-1 in the first leg in Peru against Alianza Atletico, managed a 4-1 win at home in a very rough game. The Peruvians tried to stop their rivals with physical tactics and ended the match with eight men as the referee sent off Marcio Valverde, Ruben Mori and Rafael Farfan. Brazilian defender Luiz Alberto also received a red card.\n\nMarcio Valverde opened the scoring for Alianza on 15 minutes from the penalty spot, but Dario Conca equalised before half-time and in the second half Alan Borges De Carvalho and Adeilson Pereira (twice) sealed the Brazilian win. Fluminense's next opponents are Universidad de Chile, with a spot in the semi-finals on the line.\n\nIn Chile, two goals by Leandro Caruso allowed Argentinian side Velez to continue in the Copa Sudamericana as they grabbed a 2-2 draw against Union Espanola for a 5-4 win on aggregate. The Chileans took a two-goal lead during the first half through goals by Jorge Ampuero and Gustavo Canales, which gave them the advantage, but after the break Caruso showed up twice to give Velez the quarter-final spot.\n\nVelez will now face Liga de Quito, who eliminated another Argentinian side, Lanus. Liga had already won 4-0 at home, so the 1-1 draw tonight was enough for them. Claudio Bieler scored for Liga giving them a five-goal advantage, and Santiago Salcedo's goal was far from being enough for the Argentinians.\n\nFinally, in Brazil, Cerro Porteno got their place thanks to an away goal, as they lost 3-1 against Goias after winning 2-0 in Paraguay. Felipe put Goias ahead in the first half, and Carlos Recalde equalised. Felipe again and Leo Lima struck for the Brazilians, but the decisive goal eluded them. Cerro will now play against another Brazilian side, Botafogo, in the last eight.\n\nSource: fifa\n\nComments ( 0 ): Post Your Comments >>\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Peacefmonline.com.
