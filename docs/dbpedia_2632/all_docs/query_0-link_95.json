My passion for the United Nations and its political processes stems from several sources: the more than one hundred nationalities represented in my high school near Washington, D.C.; the study abroad experiences I had in high school and college; the intellectual environment created by my mentor, Professor Chadwick F. Alger, in graduate school; and the indispensable mission of the United Nations itself, so eloquently stated in the Preamble to its Charter. Over the past decade, many individuals have helped me translate this passion into the pages that follow. First, I owe a debt of gratitude to my students at Seton Hall University and Ohio State University, who, through their questions and comments, pushed me to share with a larger audience my ideas and stories regarding the UN’s political processes. I am also grateful to numerous colleagues in the International Studies Association and the Academic Council on the United Nations System who provided feedback regarding the tradeoffs in content and approach that I faced. Much of their insight came through panel discussions, but some spent literally hours talking with me in hallways, over meals, and while traveling. This book would not have been possible without the insights of another essential set of individuals: the more than fifty UN delegates and staff members who graciously took the time to meet with me and were more than generous in answering my many questions regarding their daily experiences. Their assistance was invaluable, although none of them bears any responsibility for the conclusions I reached. During the preparation of the manuscript, I benefited from the supvii\n\n*S-FM/rev 10/18/05 3:43 PM Page viii\n\nviii\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nportive environment provided by the dean of the John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations, Ambassador Clay Constantinou, and my colleagues on the faculty there. Many of them have been through this process themselves, and they were more than willing to help me along. In addition, I was assisted in my research by three graduate students at Seton Hall—Nancy Tanella, Whitney Rubison, and Jacob Dryden. Likewise, I am extremely thankful for the support and guidance provided by the staff of Lynne Rienner Publishers, especially Lynne herself. Her reputation for nurturing young authors and for publishing excellent material on the United Nations is well earned, and I am pleased that I was able to work with her team. In particular, Sally Glover, Lisa Tulchin, and Lesli Athanasoulis were patient and responsive editors, and the two anonymous reviewers selected by the press provided helpful feedback that was both detailed and encouraging. Finally, a word of thanks to my family for understanding more than anyone else the long hours that persistence requires. None of this work would have been possible without the love and encouragement of my wife, Sharyn. She pushed me when required and supported me always. The same is true for my children, Peyton and Kiley. They taught me, among other things, that there really is no better cure for writer’s block than a rousing game of monster hide-and-seek. While my family did not do the research or write this book, their contribution is found on every page. Plus they made it all worthwhile.\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 1\n\n1 Introduction to the Global Dance\n\nIN MARCH 2003 AN INTENSE PERIOD OF DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY AT THE\n\nUnited Nations collapsed when the United States failed to secure Security Council authorization for its military action against Iraq. The tension and hostility that characterized these difficult negotiations resulted in a divided and paralyzed Council. However, just two months later Council unity was restored when the United States was able to lobby the other member states to endorse a US-authored plan for rebuilding Iraq. This series of events raises important questions: Why was the most powerful UN member, the United States, unable to obtain Council support on an issue in which the Bush administration clearly felt the vital interests of the country were at stake? Conversely, why was the United States able to achieve a postwar resolution very favorable to its interests in the face of what had been such a hostile environment at the United Nations? Finally, why were both permanent and elected members of the Council unwilling to compromise in March but prepared to do so in May? Complicated questions about the political processes of the United Nations are not limited to peace and security issues. Economic interdependence, technological change, faster travel, and other aspects of globalization have resulted in increased activity in all areas of global policymaking in the early twenty-first century. On issues as diverse as global warming, terrorism, drug trafficking, infectious diseases, weapons of mass destruction, and political oppression, the international community has come together in search of coordinated responses to address these complex and challenging problems more effectively. As the world’s only universal membership and general purpose international organization, the United Nations has become the primary vehicle for pursuing these efforts. 1\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 2\n\n2\n\nPOLITICS AND PROCESS AT THE UN\n\nAs can be expected, the results of these efforts have been mixed. In some cases the countries involved have agreed to and followed through on concrete steps to overcome the problems; in other cases dramatic policy statements were drafted, only to be neglected once the spotlight of attention was removed; and in still other cases the participants were unable to come to any meaningful agreement at all. This variation in outcomes can be found across the different political bodies of the United Nations system and in the series of global conferences that have been held under UN auspices since the early 1990s. Understanding how and why this variation occurs requires a deeper examination of how the United Nations makes its decisions. More precisely, it involves considering how an organization that is composed of 191 sovereign member states, influenced by numerous nongovernmental organizations, lobbied by multinational corporations, and serviced by an international secretariat works to reconcile these potentially diverse interests in search of effective international solutions to pressing global problems. This is a challenging enterprise, and it represents the focus of this book. ■ The Nature of Parliamentary Diplomacy: An Analogy\n\nDiplomatic interaction in international organizations like the United Nations is complex and multifaceted. Due to the wide range of participants involved and the numerous issues potentially on the table, a number of interrelated processes often unfold simultaneously. One of these processes reflects the need for participants in international decisionmaking to pursue the interests of the actor they represent. This is most pressing for representatives of member states, and here the mechanisms of multilateral diplomacy have a number of important similarities to traditional bilateral diplomacy. Representing the interests of your state (or for that matter any other actor in international organizations) certainly involves trying to persuade other participants of the merits of your position when there are areas of disagreement. However, it also involves listening to their arguments, gathering information about the roots of their positions, and laying the groundwork for future interaction (Muldoon, 1999, pp. 2–3). Beyond these various tasks, diplomatic representation can also require some internal coordination within the actors involved (Jacobson, 1979, pp. 120–122). Member states, nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and even members of the Secretariat face diverse constituencies whose preferences must be reconciled, or at least considered, when it comes time to advocate for certain policies in a diplomatic negotiation. Since international organiza-\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 3\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL DANCE\n\n3\n\ntions often require participants to adopt positions on a broader range of issues than is typical in bilateral diplomacy, these problems of representation and coordination are made all the more challenging. Despite some similarities to bilateral diplomacy, the political processes found in international organizations are significantly more complex because the decisionmaking involved is both multilateral and parliamentary. The fact that decisionmaking is multilateral, with anywhere from a handful to several hundred actors involved, quite simply results in a much larger range of interests that must be reconciled. This, in turn, means there are at least three differences in the skills required of diplomats in multilateral versus bilateral settings (Muldoon, 1999, p. 3; Hamilton and Langhorne, 1995, pp. 199–209). First, skills such as adaptability, flexibility, and the ability to multitask are helpful in bilateral settings, but they are essential in multilateral settings. Second, since multilateral diplomacy often includes a more public and open component and involves more frequent oral, face-to-face exchanges, participants must possess excellent public speaking, debating, and language skills. Finally, multilateral diplomacy places a premium on individuals who can balance two contradictory roles: the specialist and the generalist. Over time the need for specialized expertise in diplomacy has grown dramatically, as many issues that are highly technical have moved onto the international agenda. However, these highly technical issues are often interrelated with each other, so effective negotiators need to be able to visualize and build solutions that take advantage of these linkages. In addition to their multilateral character, the political processes of international organizations have been described by Dean Rusk and others as examples of “parliamentary diplomacy” (as quoted in Appathurai, 1985, p. 98). In such bodies the component parts, the member states, are sovereign actors that rarely afford the organization the level of authority called for in the treaty documents that led to its creation. However, despite their limited authority, many international organizations structure decisionmaking with procedures that are more akin to those of domestic parliaments than those of bilateral diplomacy. For example, many international organizations can make their decisions through voting, often some form of majority rule. In addition, the parliamentary nature of these bodies extends into every aspect of how they operate, including processes for recognizing speakers, mechanisms for organizing debate, and the role of committees in decisionmaking. This complexity makes their political processes more challenging for participants and observers to fully understand. Given the use of parliamentary rules and procedures in multilateral\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 4\n\n4\n\nPOLITICS AND PROCESS AT THE UN\n\ndiplomacy, the process of achieving policy outcomes essentially becomes an exercise in building and managing the coalitions required to secure the necessary number of votes. In some international organizations these coalitions remain relatively stable; however, it is also common for these coalitions to be rebuilt again and again over time, depending on the particular issue or issues under discussion and the number of votes required to pass any new policy agreement. In light of this reality, observers of multilateral diplomacy often describe it as an “art” whose “principal challenge . . . is to design the negotiations in such a way that they encourage the creation of coalitions supporting the agreement and minimize the possibility of coalitions opposing it” (Aviel, 1999, pp. 12–13). In these efforts, hard-and-fast rules, like those associated with scientific processes, are often difficult for both participants and observers to discern. However, there are certain common patterns and rules of thumb that can and should be identified so that scholars, students, and practitioners can better understand how the strategies and tactics that work in one situation can be applied most effectively in other situations. Participants in international organization decisionmaking face a distinctive challenge, as compared to their bilateral colleagues, because of their need to build and maintain coalitions across a wide range of issues. Not only do they have to be an effective representative of their actor’s interests, but they must also learn how to successfully participate in the give-and-take of the organization’s political processes (Jacobson, 1979, pp. 122–124). This certainly requires that they have a thorough grasp of the procedures and rules of debate (Hamilton and Langhorne, 1995, p. 199), but it also necessitates an expertise in designing creative “package deals” that offer all participants greater benefits from supporting the agreement than they would enjoy from blocking it. Unfortunately, the strategies that enable participants to pursue their interests are not always the same strategies for facilitating the compromises necessary for building winning coalitions. As a result, all actors involved in international organizations are forced to make tradeoffs, often difficult ones, between the policies that they really want to see adopted and those that realistically can be adopted. In light of such complexity, it is useful to consider an analogy: the political processes of international organizations like the United Nations can be conceptualized as a global dance. At any particular UN gathering, there are member-state delegates, Secretariat officials, and NGO representatives, each of whom may begin in his or her own little group or clique. Some of the members of the dance troupe naturally assume a role at the center of the dance floor; these lead dancers would\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 5\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL DANCE\n\n5\n\ninclude the most powerful member states of the organization and those members who are most directly affected by the issue at hand. Gathered around these lead dancers would be a variety of supporting players: middle power states that serve as brokers, bringing together different key attendees to see if they can dance in the same routine; members of the organization’s staff, who serve as the orchestra, offering music and language that have fostered common movements in the past; representatives of civil society, who seek to get the lead dancers and other players to consider new moves and music that has not been used before; and otherwise marginalized members, who lurk as outcasts around the perimeter, able to influence the unfolding dance only by attempting to block or disrupt it. As the music starts playing and the negotiation process begins, the various members of the troupe must move to form partnerships or be forced to watch from the sideline. What may begin as a dance in which each participant seems to have his or her own moves can gradually evolve into a more scripted routine in which all the dancers start to move in the same direction. However, getting to that point involves understanding both the written and unwritten rules of the dance, knowing which other attendees represent potential dance partners, and pos-\n\nMembers of the Security Council gather for a meeting on Iraq on June 8, 2004. These informal contacts among delegates are an essential component of the global dance throughout the decisionmaking process.

As this happens, different members of the troupe have different abilities to shape the unfolding dance. Some can simply rely on their stature and reputation to induce other dancers to follow their lead; others possess the creativity to offer new moves or scarce resources like a particular piece of music. Sometimes the dance may end with an empty dance floor, a frustrated orchestra, and no noticeable progress on the issue at hand. Yet the hope is that the number of participants willing to dance together, and to the same music, will increase over time, so that effective solutions to pressing global problems can be found. ■ Understanding UN Processes: Where Do We Start?\n\nScholarly study of international organizations dates back almost as far as the organizations themselves. The creation of the League of Nations and the United Nations was accompanied by a flurry of writings on the origins, structures, and early activities of these new organizations. The best-known of these efforts, such as Inis Claude (1984, first published in 1956), offered a wealth of information about the challenges and opportunities facing international organizations in a world of sovereign states. Unfortunately, reviews of these early writings are mixed. These authors offered important insights into how these organizations interacted with the international political system in which they operated (Martin and Simmons, 2001, p. 440), but such insights were often buried in rich historical detail or thick legal description. These writings tended to focus on what the organizations were rather than on how they functioned. Over time, a number of scholars have tried to provide the study of international organization with a stronger theoretical footing. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, authors such as David Mitrany (1943) and Ernst Haas (1958) offered theories like functionalism and neofunctionalism, respectively, which focused on how international organizations could be vehicles for solving problems of war and peace. Functionalists saw international organizations as an ad hoc product of technical cooperation between states, designed to promote common economic and social needs. Neofunctionalists adopted a functionalist strategy of cooperation spilling over from one issue area to the next, but with a much more explicit and ambitious goal in mind: regional integration in Europe. Later, in the 1970s, Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye Jr. (1971; 1977) shifted the focus to transnational relations and complex interdependence, in an effort to push scholars beyond the\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 7\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL DANCE\n\n7\n\nstate-centered and conflict-based realist paradigm; key issues included nonmilitary interaction between states and the increasing presence of nonstate actors (including international organizations) in world politics. While all these theories acknowledged an important, or even central, role for international organizations, they suffered from a number of weaknesses (Archer, 1992, pp. 88–106); for example, they neglected to examine the formal and informal structures and procedures that characterize the decisionmaking processes within these actors. Across the 1980s and early 1990s, theorizing about international organizations was dominated by regime analysis. In this approach, regimes were defined as “sets of implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actor’s expectations converge in a given area of international relations” (Krasner, 1983, p. 2). While not synonymous with international organizations, regime analysis highlighted a number of important dynamics that were instrumental for understanding why states cooperate in international politics and what form that cooperation might take from one issue to the next. As such, international organizations like the United Nations could act as central players in regimes relevant to the different issue areas on their agendas. However, over time regime analysis seemed to lose sight of this early promise, and most dominant approaches to the study of regimes became state centered (Haggard and Simmons, 1987, p. 499). In the 1980s, regime analysis essentially hijacked the study of international organizations, then, without making any contributions to an understanding of how these formal international structures operate. When the cold war ended in the late 1980s, the United Nations was rather suddenly thrust back into the spotlight of global politics as never before in its tumultuous history. The breakdown in superpower rivalry resulted in a dramatic increase in demands for multilateral management of a growing range of transnational problems, and much of this demand was directed at the institutions of the UN system (Fischer and Galtung, 1991, p. 289). Unfortunately, this increased demand for UN activity came at a time when scholars were only just beginning to move beyond the confines of regime analysis. As reflected in a comprehensive survey by Friedrich Kratochwil and John Ruggie (1986, p. 761), very few articles published in the leading scholarly journal on international organizations across the 1980s actually focused on formal international organizations like the UN. However, soon after this survey, the study of international organization was reinvigorated to some extent by authors who incorporated concepts originally developed in other academic disciplines. For example, Christer Jönsson (1986), Gayl Ness and Steven Brechin (1988), and Ernst Haas (1990) borrowed ideas from organiza-\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 8\n\n8\n\nPOLITICS AND PROCESS AT THE UN\n\ntional sociology to study, respectively, how international organizations work collaboratively across linked policy areas, pursue their goals, and incorporate new areas of knowledge through learning. Three additional areas of literature potentially relevant to the study of international organizations were developed across the 1990s. The first of these is the study of multilateralism, which focuses on the broad universe of international institutional forms that bring multiple parties together in particular areas of concern. However, the main volume on multilateralism argues that formal international organizations represent only a small part of this broader universe (Ruggie, 1993, pp. 6–7), and as a result international organizations have received limited attention in this research. A second area would be writings on global governance, which explore areas of international activity where relationships that transcend national frontiers are governed without the presence of sovereign authority. In other words, global governance is doing internationally what governments do at home (Finkelstein, 1995). Unfortunately, global governance is typically defined so broadly that the concept appears to include virtually everything, thereby preventing it from offering analytical leverage for examining the internal processes of international organizations. A third area of recent scholarship would be the literature on institutionalism, which borrows extensively from research done on domestic institutional structures. This scholarship examines how institutions can both be caused by state behavior and influence that very same behavior (Martin and Simmons, 2001, p. 451). This is true because formal and informal institutions have the ability to constrain choices, alter preferences, and influence outcomes. However, this focus on the impact of institutions on policy outcomes offers little insight into how the internal political processes of the institutions function. Despite such efforts to make the study of international organizations more systematic and theoretically grounded, much of this research remains centered on the nature of the decisions made by the actors and on the subsequent effects of the decisions, but little attention is paid to the decisionmaking process itself. This focus is to be expected, since the resolutions and programs of international organizations are often seen as being the goal or culmination of global policymaking. However, even during the UN’s adolescence in the 1960s, scholars had begun to realize that these outputs are “hardly ever the most important or meaningful point” of UN decisionmaking (Petersen, 1968, p. 128). As Keith Petersen argued, the dynamics of parliamentary diplomacy are of greater consequence for understanding the UN and its achievements than are the results of specific policymaking victories (1968, p. 131).\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 9\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL DANCE\n\n9\n\nPut another way, we need to understand the forces and influences that can move the organization to act if we want to fully understand what it does and why it matters. The study of UN politics provided in this book will demonstrate that Petersen’s observations on the importance of process are as relevant today as they were decades ago. After all, if the political process does not move, then no outputs can result. Given the importance of considering process when one is trying to understand international organizations, it is unfortunate that so much scholarship on these actors has focused on the outputs of global policymaking rather than investigating its underlying dynamics of how and why certain decisions emerge from these efforts. This apparent neglect of process is all the more surprising given the fact that for some four decades scholars have regularly identified a pressing need for systematic studies of decisionmaking in international organizations. Writing in the late 1960s, Robert Keohane (1967, pp. 221–222), David Kay (1969, p. 958), and Chadwick Alger (1970, p. 444) all argued that scholars had neglected the political processes that are central to the functioning of the United Nations. A similar conclusion was reached by J. Martin Rochester (1986, p. 812) and Kratochwil and Ruggie (1986, p. 754) nearly two decades later, when they called for an increased focus on the structure and processes of formal international organizations. Finally, this appeal was repeated after the end of the cold war, when Johan Kaufmann (1994, p. 28), Rochester (1995, p. 199), Kenneth Abbott and Duncan Snidal (1998, pp. 5, 29), Courtney Smith (1999, pp. 173–174), and Alger (2002, p. 218) noted the continued scarcity of scholarship on decisionmaking in international organizations. While the absence of a theoretical framework for examining the political processes of international organizations represents a serious shortcoming of the literature surveyed above, there are at least three areas of past scholarship that are directly relevant to this effort to investigate United Nations decisionmaking. None of these areas of scholarship led to much accumulation of knowledge over time, since they failed to build a common framework for situating their individual findings. However, despite this shortcoming, their research has important insights to offer this current effort to examine the political processes of the United Nations. A few examples of the many writings in each area will be mentioned here, and their true contributions will become more evident in the chapters that follow. The first set of relevant research is empirical studies that have addressed certain aspects of the internal workings of the United Nations. While these studies were largely completed decades ago and none of them focused specifically on decisionmaking, they did address\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 10\n\n10\n\nPOLITICS AND PROCESS AT THE UN\n\nrelated issues such as influence and participation. For example, Alger (1966; 1967) examined how member state delegates to the Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committee of the UN General Assembly interacted as they sought to reach agreement on funding peacekeeping and other issues. He discovered that essentially two processes were happening at the same time in the meetings: a public debate heard by all in the room and numerous private conversations that helped form the building blocks of the subsequent agreements. Another example concerns studies of influence in international organizations by Keohane (1967) and Robert Cox and Harold Jacobson (1973). In both cases, the authors sought to identify factors and mechanisms that enabled certain states to get their way in the UN body being studied. They found that state power was certainly related to influence but that other factors were also important, such as the personality of individual delegates and the use of procedures to manipulate the debate. A second area of research that offers important insights into how international organizations operate is studies written by experienced UN practitioners. Some of these individuals are former UN staff members, such as C. V. Narasimhan (1988), who served in many senior secretariat positions, including under-secretary-general for special political affairs and chef de cabinet of the secretary-general. Other practitioner writers are former delegates who were posted to the United Nations in New York, Geneva, or both by their governments for many years. One rather prolific example is Kaufmann (1980; 1988), who has written on UN decisionmaking and conference diplomacy more broadly, based on his experiences serving as permanent representative of the Netherlands to the United Nations. The insights and stories offered by these former practitioners are especially illuminating, since they actually participated in the public and private processes observed by Alger (noted in the preceding paragraph). A third and final type of research that offers a window into the political processes of the UN is detailed studies that focus on one particular institution, usually either the General Assembly or the Security Council. Sydney Bailey (1960) and M. J. Peterson (1986) both address the General Assembly’s role in world politics as well as its structures and procedures. The Security Council has received comparatively more attention in this regard, including a number of edited volumes such as Nicol (1981) and Russett (1997). These studies mix a focus on the performance of the Council with a discussion of the mechanisms, both formal and informal, through which it reaches its decisions. The previous three areas of literature have much to offer; however, they have an additional limitation for the illumination of UN processes\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 11\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL DANCE\n\n11\n\nbeyond their lack of a common framework. Many of them were completed decades ago, when the UN was a very different place than it is today. While some of their insights are just as timely now as when they were first offered, the formal and informal processes used by the UN have evolved over time. Some of this change relates to the end of the cold war, but much of it reflects a longer evolution across the entire life of the organization. For example, studies of UN voting patterns completed in the 1970s found that the nature of group and coalition politics in the General Assembly had changed as its membership increased (Rowe, 1969; 1971; Newcombe, Ross, and Newcombe, 1970). Furthermore, building on this earlier research, studies completed in the 1990s found that many of these blocs were undergoing some degree of realignment and were no longer as unified or cohesive as they once had been (Holloway, 1990). Simultaneous with this change in membership has been a gradual shift from majority voting toward the use of consensus-based procedures in the General Assembly and other UN bodies (Marin-Bosch, 1987; Kaufmann, 1994, pp. 27–28). Given that these procedures structure all subsequent interaction and help to specify how much influence each member will have over the content of the decision, their impact on UN political processes can be significant (Cox and Jacobson, 1973, p. 7). As a result of these changes, existing scholarship on the political processes of the United Nations and other international organizations needs to be revisited. The goal of this book is to synthesize the insights offered by classic writings on international organizations, such as those surveyed above, into a more systematic framework for understanding how the UN actually works. This synthesis will also draw on more recent examinations, where available, of the actors involved in UN processes and the procedures through which they interact. However, merely synthesizing existing research would still leave significant gaps in our understanding of UN decisionmaking. These gaps are partly the result of the internal and external changes just discussed, but their roots also lie in the fact that much of the most difficult coalition building in the UN happens out of the spotlight, in private and informal settings. Unfortunately, as the preceding literature review indicates, these are the areas of UN politics most likely to be overlooked in existing scholarship. One mechanism for overcoming this neglect is to draw on the insights of current UN practitioners, both members of the Secretariat and representatives of member states and other actors that play a role in the organization’s decisionmaking. When these insights are incorporated into a systematic framework, they can make a significant contribution to our understanding of parliamentary diplomacy,\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 12\n\n12\n\nPOLITICS AND PROCESS AT THE UN\n\nhighlighting important processes that would otherwise be ignored and providing real-world examples of the dynamics at play. For this reason, interviews with twenty-five UN practitioners are used to inform the discussion that follows. They are cited in the text and listed with the other references at the end of the book. ■ Understanding UN Processes: The Plan of the Book\n\nThe remaining chapters of this book develop a framework for understanding the political dynamics of the United Nations and, at least to some extent, other international organizations. Based on the complex nature of parliamentary diplomacy described above, any effort to divide the many different processes involved into separate chapters necessitates some tradeoffs. The discussion that follows is divided into two rather straightforward parts: a consideration of the actors involved in UN decisionmaking, followed by an investigation of the formal and informal procedures and processes through which these actors can wield influence at the UN. Some mechanisms, such as the role of UN groups and the importance of political leadership, are discussed at key junctures in both parts, since they involve both actors and processes depending on the particular manner in which they are being used. Part 1, “Members of the Troupe: Actors at the United Nations,” discusses the various actors involved in UN processes. Previous international organization scholarship has identified nine distinct participants in UN decisions: representatives of member states, representatives of groups of states functioning as a bloc, representatives of other international organizations, the executive head of the organization, members of the organization’s staff, representatives of nongovernmental organizations, private individuals working in their own capacity, representatives of multinational corporations, and the media. The influence of any of these actors on UN decisionmaking certainly varies across issues and over time. Part 1 is divided into four chapters dealing with the following most active UN actors: member states and their delegates, groups of states operating in concert, the organization’s staff and its head, and representatives of civil society and the private sector. Based on their power of vote and their payment of dues, member states represent the most important actors in UN processes, and they are the focus of Chapter 2, “Member States and Delegates.” This chapter discusses how member states organize their UN missions to best pursue their interests in light of the power resources they possess within and outside the organization. Differences among these power resources and variations in their international reputations encourage large, middle, and\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 13\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL DANCE\n\n13\n\nsmall powers to assume different roles in UN deliberations. Chapter 2 also examines the role of individual state delegates as they seek to balance the often contradictory pressures of representing the interests of their country and participating in the give-and-take of multilateral diplomacy. Key issues in managing this balance are their individual autonomy, or freedom to act, in relationship to their home government and the personal attributes and particular skills that they can bring to bear in the negotiation process. Chapter 3, “Groups and Blocs,” investigates how various collections of UN members function in concert on different issues. Many writings have highlighted the importance of these actors, but they are often treated in an overly simplistic manner, which makes it easy to distort the true implications of this phenomenon for UN decisionmaking. This book differentiates among three dimensions of group politics, each of which has important but distinct influences on the political process. The first dimension is the five geographically based regional groups (Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe and Other States) that are used for elections to all limited-membership bodies and the selection of candidates for all leadership positions. The second dimension is groups based on common issue positions, ranging in size from the five Nordic countries to the 130-plus members of the Group of 77. This dimension also includes the various regional international organizations, such as the European Union and the Caribbean Community, which often try to speak with one voice in UN debates. The third dimension of group politics in the UN is small negotiating groups used to resolve critical issues that have reached an impasse within larger membership bodies. However, in practice this last type of group politics blurs the line between groups as an actor and groups as a process, so these groups receive attention in Part 2 of the book as well. Chapter 4, “The Secretariat and the Secretary-General,” looks at the role of the UN’s staff and its executive head. These individuals constitute the international civil service and are, at least in theory, independent of national influence and loyal to the UN. However, this impartiality does not mean they are without influence in the political processes of the organization. Chapter 4 examines the mechanisms through which the Secretariat has a direct and indirect impact on the decisions that are made, and it also considers various obstacles complicating the Secretariat’s work. Additionally, the chapter includes a separate discussion of the political dimensions of the office of secretary-general. Effective incumbents in this difficult job have managed to use their individual style and personal attributes to move the organization in new\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 14\n\n14\n\nPOLITICS AND PROCESS AT THE UN\n\nand exciting directions; however, this can be a daunting task, given the often contradictory pressures they face in promoting and maintaining the UN’s role in international politics. In balancing these pressures, the secretary-general can at times have a significant role in UN decisionmaking. As the final section in Part 1, Chapter 5 investigates “Civil Society and the Private Sector.” The focus is on two additional actors in UN processes: nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and multinational corporations (MNCs). The relationship between the UN and NGOs dates to the drafting of the UN Charter; however, the mechanisms for this interaction have expanded considerably beyond the consultative arrangements with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), specified in Article 71. These include limited access to other deliberative bodies, NGO liaison offices in nearly every UN department, expanded involvement in UN-sponsored global conferences, and extensive cooperation in the field. Despite this progress, there is still significant frustration on the part of NGOs regarding the obstacles to participation that they face: onerous security procedures, complex processes for accreditation, and a lack of direct access to the General Assembly and Security Council. The situation for MNCs is much less developed. Contact has been sporadic, on an issue-by-issue basis, with many efforts ending in mutual distrust. However, that has changed in recent years, most notably in the form of the Global Compact, which aims to foster partnerships between the UN and the business community. But even with these developments, MNCs still have only limited mechanisms, such as the creation of an affiliated NGO, through which they can have an impact on UN processes. The second part of the book, “Movements of the Dance: Procedures and Processes,” shifts attention from the actors involved in UN decisionmaking to the processes themselves. Across the four chapters of this part, both formal and informal dimensions of UN decisionmaking receive attention. First the structures of the main UN deliberative bodies are discussed, and then the formal procedures through which these bodies operate are examined. Next the book explores the private side of UN processes through which delegates and other players work to build coalitions in a personal and informal manner. The final chapter of this part brings together the key insights from Parts 1 and 2, in search of an understanding of strategies through which actors wield influence based on their attributes and the nature of the arena in which a decision is being made. Chapter 6, “Formal Arenas: The Structures of Decisionmaking,” considers the different forums in which the cast of characters interacts.\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 15\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE GLOBAL DANCE\n\n15\n\nThese include bodies that encompass all UN members, such as the General Assembly and its main committees, as well as bodies that are based on a more restricted membership, like the Security Council. It also distinguishes between deliberative bodies, including those just mentioned, in which politics is considered a central factor, and those more technical and specialized forums, such as the Economic and Social Council and the Specialized Agencies, where political considerations may be assumed, usually incorrectly, to be less debilitating. Finally, Chapter 6 also discusses ad hoc or temporary forums of decisionmaking, like the numerous issue-specific global conferences held under UN auspices over the last fifteen years. As can be expected, these various structures can result in political processes that are unique to each arena. Chapter 7, “Decision Rules and Parliamentary Procedures,” continues the consideration of UN policymaking arenas by examining the impact of decision rules and procedural tradeoffs on the political processes that ensue. In terms of decision rules, the major distinctions are among simple majority rule, qualified majority rule (including the veto), and consensus. Since each requires different thresholds of support for the UN to act, different dynamics are involved in building winning coalitions. These dynamics are also governed by procedural tradeoffs that must be made. Each UN forum must find an appropriate balance between the broad participation of actors (thereby increasing the legitimacy of its actions) and needs for efficiency and unambiguous statements of preferred behavior. This balance is influenced by a diverse set of procedural considerations that govern how proposals are handled, including the type of leadership provided by the presiding officer, mechanisms for managing debate, and methods through which amendments can be advanced. After these formal aspects of UN processes are covered in Chapters 6 and 7, Chapter 8, “Informal Networking: The Personal Side,” focuses on the informal processes that lie at the heart of UN decisionmaking. A number of UN practitioners have argued that 95 percent or more of decisionmaking in multilateral settings takes place in private, informal exchanges among interested parties. In fact, these informal processes are so important to effective policy outcomes that a rather established vocabulary and set of procedures have been developed regarding them. Unfortunately, this is the aspect of UN processes most likely to be entirely overlooked in the academic literature on international organizations. From “the fine art of corridor sitting” to the roles of delegate personality and ad hoc leadership, Chapter 8 seeks to provide a systematic understanding of what these informal contacts look like and how they\n\nS-1 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 16\n\n16\n\nPOLITICS AND PROCESS AT THE UN\n\naffect the formal decisions that are made. It also includes a more detailed examination of how these informal dynamics play an essential role in the work of one particular UN body, the Security Council. The concluding section of Part 2, Chapter 9, focuses on “Strategies of Influence: Positional, Personal, and Procedural.” It brings together many insights from the preceding chapters by investigating how different actors attempt to wield influence in the United Nations based on their interests, their power, their personal attributes, and the arena in which a decision is being made. In general, representatives of different actors can draw on three types of strategies in their effort to influence policy outcomes: strategies that depend on the positional power of the actor they represent (for example, resources or votes), strategies that rest on the personality of the individual representative (for example, charisma or negotiating skill), or strategies that involve manipulating the formal and informal procedures discussed above (for example, premature closure of debate on an issue). Each of these choices has advantages and limitations, and these must be carefully balanced: all the actors involved in the global dance are aware that today’s opponent may be tomorrow’s dance partner, given the wide range of issues and interests that come before the United Nations. The concluding chapter of the book, “The United Nations and State Compliance,” examines another issue that has been given only limited attention in research on UN processes: do the decisions of the United Nations really matter? Evaluating the UN is fraught with difficulty, since many of its decisions are couched in vague language, subject to interpretation. On top of this, there is serious academic debate regarding exactly what types of outcomes the UN should be realistically expected to achieve. Thus UN observers must be careful when making judgments about the apparent impact of the organization’s decisions. Certain considerations can lead us toward more thoughtful arguments regarding the results of UN processes. Chapter 10 addresses the most important of these, including the distinction between implementation and compliance, the differences between binding and nonbinding decisions, the appropriate time horizon for behavioral change, and the relationship between the process by which a decision is made and its ultimate effectiveness.\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 19\n\n2 Member States and Delegates\n\nTHE UNITED NATIONS IS A COMPLEX NETWORK OF INTERCONNECTED BOD-\n\nies: assemblies, councils, committees, commissions, programs, agencies, and funds. This reality is often obscured by journalists and politicians who talk in terms of a single United Nations that either succeeds or fails when it acts. For example, in the first half of 2003 numerous analyses bemoaned the failure of the United Nations to prevent the United States from acting outside the authority of the Security Council when it launched a military campaign against Iraq. Calling the United Nations “irrelevant” or worse, these pundits themselves committed a rather startling failure in their inability to understand that the UN is, first and foremost, an intergovernmental body whose successes and failures, however judged, result from political processes through which its member states interact. Viewing the UN in this manner helps us understand that the Council’s inaction against Iraq was not the fault of the United Nations; it resulted directly from the fact that the Council’s members could not arrive at a common approach for dealing with continued Iraqi noncompliance with its disarmament obligations. To clarify what the UN is and is not, and thus allow for more nuanced and accurate assessments of its performance, one eminent international organization scholar has spoken of “two UNs” (Claude, 1996, pp. 290–292). In this conceptualization, the “first UN” is composed primarily of the organization’s staff of international civil servants, who are dependent on the organization’s members for resources but can act alongside them at times with considerable independence. The “second UN” is a collective entity composed of its member states, who use the organization as a forum for promoting their own interests and preferred outcomes. Sometimes states find that this forum facilitates finding common approaches to pressing issues; however, just as 19\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 20\n\n20\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\noften these efforts can result in stalemate and inaction, as happened in the case of Iraq in March 2003. Naturally, these two UNs operate in very different ways. The “first UN” is mainly concerned with rendering impartial assistance to parties in need through noncoercive, consensual, and neutral mechanisms; the “second UN” by its very nature is essentially judgmental, partisan, and coercive. Other scholars use a different vocabulary to discuss essentially the same dichotomy. For example, Thomas Weiss, David Forsythe, and Roger Coate describe the UN as both an “actor” and a “framework” (2001, pp. 12–15). At the heart of their discussion of these roles lies the issue of organizational autonomy: when, if ever, is it possible to talk about the UN as an actor that operates independently of the preferences of its members? While there is substantial debate among scholars and practitioners on this point, the consensus view is that the range of issues and tasks in which the UN is an independent actor is necessarily limited. In the great majority of situations, the UN is most accurately viewed as a framework through which its members pursue their goals in international politics, often at the expense of other states. While some examples of how the UN’s staff can act independently of its membership will be offered in Chapter 4, “The Secretariat and the Secretary-General,” this view of the “second UN” as a framework for its members will dominate the discussion in this chapter and in Part 2 of the book, on UN procedures and processes. Conceptualizing the UN as an intergovernmental framework is logical, given the fact that its members have two important mechanisms for controlling the organization: the power of vote and the power of the purse. In terms of voting, all authoritative decisions made on behalf of the United Nations are taken by the member states that sit on a particular body. In some cases this involves all 191 members; in other cases it may involve only a small fraction of them (such as the fifteen-member Security Council). As was mentioned in the introduction, there are certainly other actors that play a role in the political processes of the UN and that will be surveyed in the following chapters; however, at the end of the day only the member states have the ability to move the organization to action through their dominance of its structures and procedures for decisionmaking. As if the power of vote were not enough, states also have the ability to dominate the organization by controlling its resources, since all UN funding is provided by its members, either through required assessments for the regular and peacekeeping budgets or through voluntary contributions for specific agencies or funds. A number of proposals for reforming UN financing would modify these arrangements (Mendez, 1997, pp. 297–304), but none of them have\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 21\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n21\n\nachieved much mileage politically, because member states continue to value having two different means of exercising control. Because of this dominance, any discussion of the participants in the global dance of parliamentary diplomacy must begin with a focus on member states and how they represent their interests at the United Nations. This involves three separate but related areas of concern in this chapter. First, the roles that various types of member states play in the United Nations are examined. These roles vary based on the power capabilities of the state in question and based on its past and future policy priorities at the UN. Second, variations in the permanent missions of member states, in terms of both the size and structure of their delegations, are discussed. Finally, the chapter considers how the personal attributes of individual delegates can have a significant impact on their effectiveness in achieving their state’s interests within the give-and-take of the UN’s political processes. Variations in delegate autonomy are discussed in this section, and four different general types of UN delegates are described. ■ State Roles at the United Nations\n\nArticle 2, Paragraph 1 of the United Nations Charter says that “the Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all of its Members.” This equality is most directly reflected in the voting formula used in all UN bodies: one state, one vote. While there are some distortions of this equality in voting, such as the great-power veto in the Security Council, one could look at the UN’s decisionmaking procedures discussed in Part 2 of this book and conclude that every member state has essentially the same degree of influence over outcomes, since each possess just one of 191 votes in all bodies where the full membership is represented. However, this sovereign equality on paper must be understood in terms of the political realities in which the UN operates; some UN members are clearly more equal than others. The differences in influence among UN members are often attributed to the fact that the international system is composed of states with varying degrees of power, and these power differences translate into corresponding differences in influence within the UN (Keohane, 1967, p. 222). Thus understanding what a state can achieve at the UN has much to do with appreciating the resources and other capabilities it can use to push the organization in the direction it desires. However, looking solely at state power does not provide a complete picture of the different roles that states can play in the political processes of the United Nations. This is true because, at a very basic level, dif-\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 22\n\n22\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\nferent members have different visions of what the UN is and what it should be doing. Writing originally in 1961, UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld identified two distinct ways member states viewed the UN: Certain members conceive of the Organization as a static conference machinery for resolving conflicts of interest and ideologies with a view to peaceful coexistence, [whereas] other members have made it clear that they conceive of the Organization primarily as a dynamic instrument of governments through which they, jointly and for the same purpose, should seek such reconciliation but through which they should also try to develop forms of executive action. (Hammarskjöld, 1967, p. 109)\n\nWhile one could disagree with the exact nature of the two schools that Hammarskjöld identified in the 1960s, his general point is an important one: member states that see the UN in different ways will enjoy distinct advantages and disadvantages in their efforts to influence its decisions. The following paragraphs will seek, then, to arrive at some general observations regarding how two distinct considerations have an impact on a country’s role at the UN: its ability to exercise influence and its desire to do so. From the start, it should be clear that the roles that certain UN members play in the organization have evolved over time. For example, from the founding of the United Nations to the present, the United States has remained one of the most dominant (or, as many would say, the most dominant) of its members. However, over this same period, both the ability and the desire of the United States to influence outcomes at the UN have changed. Over the first two decades of UN activity, the United States was able to draw on its support in Latin America and its large financial contributions to use the UN as a means of legitimizing its desired actions (Karns and Mingst, 1995, p. 412). However, this dominance clearly waned across the 1970s and 1980s, as the membership expanded and the United States lost its long-held voting majority. Though the United States continued to be the largest financial contributor to the UN, its ability to secure preferred policy outcomes was severely diminished (Luck, 1999, pp. 111–114). This, in turn, resulted in a decreased US desire to even try to influence the UN, as it was seen as a “dangerous place” for US interests (Moynihan, 1978). Fortunately, the situation changed in the early 1990s. The US financial contribution remained large, and its control over votes (especially in the General Assembly) remained limited, but its desire to wield influence certainly increased in the aftermath of the successful US-UN partnership during\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 23\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n23\n\nthe Gulf War in 1991. However, this euphoria was soon followed by renewed disengagement on the part of the United States (Gregg, 1993, p. 143), a development that marked the beginning of a pattern of rapid and tumultuous changes in the US role in the UN. These changes have persisted through the frustrations associated with how to best handle Iraq in 2003 (see Smith, 2004). The United States provides a telling example of how changes in a country’s ability and desire to influence the UN can significantly affect its role in the UN—and the US experience is far from unique. Other major powers in the United Nations have seen their interests and roles in the organization evolve over time. For example, as Japan moved to the status of one of the UN’s largest financial contributors in the 1980s, its desire to wield influence in the political processes of key UN bodies also increased. Such activism had not been apparent in Japan’s relationship with the UN in previous decades, and it has clearly resulted in a new set of policy priorities focused on UN reform (Ogata, 1995, pp. 231–232). However, other active UN members have exhibited a greater consistency in the role they have played at the UN. Two middle powers that are often identified in this regard are Canada and the Netherlands. Part of their consistency in the UN may be due to the fact that the ability of these states to wield influence has not undergone much change, as it has for the United States and Japan; however, it also results from the fact that these members have made unwavering support for the UN a cornerstone of their foreign policy (Krause, Knight, and Dewitt, 1995, p. 132; Baehr, 1995, pp. 272–273). Regardless of any changes in their ability to influence UN processes, they have consistently served as an example to other members of how states with a strong desire to work through the UN can use it as an effective instrument to achieve their goals. Clearly both the ability to influence UN decisionmaking and the desire to do so can cause a particular member state to assume a specific role in the organization (Cox and Jacobson, 1973b, pp. 20–21). This raises an important question: what factors affect whether or not a state will have the ability and desire to exercise influence in the UN? While there are many possibilities, the following pages will discuss four factors that can affect a member state’s ability to exercise influence and four separate but related factors that can affect its desire to work through the organization. Factors affecting a state’s ability include its position in the international system, its financial resources, its use of voting coalitions, and how vital its participation is in addressing the issue at hand; factors affecting a state’s desire include the nature of its political system, its policy history related to the UN, its reputation or status in the organization, and its expertise on salient “niche issues.”\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 24\n\n24\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\nFactors Affecting State Ability to Wield Influence\n\nThe first factor that affects a state’s ability to exert influence in the political process of the United Nations is its relative position in the international system. All international organizations operate within a larger environment that can have a decisive impact on the organization’s behavior and performance by acting as both a constraint and determinant of decisions (Cox and Jacobson, 1973b, p. 25; Ness and Brechin, 1988, p. 249). In the case of the United Nations, this environment consists of the entire international state system; when the position of specific countries within this system changes, their ability to wield influence in the United Nations also changes (Haas, 1968, p. 170). As can be expected, much of this interaction between the United Nations and broader dynamics of international politics is based on the coalitions, groups, and blocs that are formed as part of the organization’s political processes. These collective actors will receive detailed attention in the following chapter. It is also true that an important relationship exists between the power of individual states in general international affairs and their ability to exercise influence in specific international organizations (Cox and Jacobson, 1973b, pp. 20, 27–28). Translating power outside an organization into power inside the organization is never an exact science, but it is not surprising that major powers that possess military or economic strength might be accorded special deference or influence in certain decisions. For example, if a member’s military power is considered crucial to the success of a particular peacekeeping mission, then that state will enjoy greater leverage in determining the nature and scope of the mission. The efforts of major powers to draw on their international position to increase their influence within an international organization can at times be rather blatant; however, these processes often unfold without resort to explicit threats or pressure (Keohane, 1967, p. 223). In the case of Security Council deliberations on Iraq in February and March 2003, the six undecided members (Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexico, and Pakistan) came under intense pressure by both the states that favored military action (the United States, Britain, Spain, and Bulgaria) and those that wanted the weapons inspectors to have more time (France, Germany, Syria, Russia, and China). Public discussion of these efforts stressed that neither side was using overt economic leverage on the so-called middle six but that the sizable aid packages and other ties between these states and the various major powers did weigh heavily in the discussions (Weisman and Barringer, 2003). A second factor that can affect a member state’s ability to influence UN decisionmaking is its financial contribution to the organization.\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 25\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n25\n\nWhile most UN voting is based on the sovereign equality of the members, UN financing is governed by a formula based on a state’s capacity to pay: states with larger economies pay more, while states with weaker economies pay less. Each member is assessed a percentage of the UN’s regular operating budget based on its average per capita gross national product (GNP). This basic assessment is modified for the majority of UN members in the case of expenditures for peacekeeping operations; the permanent members of the Security Council pay an extra premium so that states with weaker economies, arranged in eight different groups, get varying amounts of discount. The results of this system have important implications for the ability of different member states to influence UN decisions. Based on the scale of assessment for the regular budget in 2002, the top seven contributors (who also happen to be the members of the Group of Seven [G7], the world’s largest industrialized democracies) are the United States at 22 percent, Japan at 19.7 percent, Germany at 9.9 percent, France at 6.5 percent, the United Kingdom at 5.6 percent, Italy at 5.1 percent, and Canada at 2.6 percent (United Nations Handbook, 2002, pp. 360–364). Thus just seven members contribute 71.4 percent of the UN’s regular budget, with the 184 other members providing the remaining 28.6 percent. In fact, only eleven other members even break the 1 percent threshold with their contributions, and if their contributions are set with those of the G7, then eighteen UN members provide just under 90 percent of the organization’s regular budget. The imbalances found on the regular scale are even more pronounced on the peacekeeping scale, because the G7 countries all pay at the same or even higher rates, and many of the 184 other members receive corresponding discounts. The major financial contributors to the United Nations have repeatedly demonstrated willingness to use their financial muscle to express displeasure or opposition to certain UN programs and activities. The most dramatic examples of these efforts led to the three major financial crises that have beset the organization (Karns and Mingst, 2002, pp. 273–276). The first of these was in the early 1960s, when France and the Soviet Union questioned whether all members should be required to contribute to new peacekeeping missions in the Middle East and the Congo. The second financial crisis emerged in the mid-1980s, when the United States started withholding part of its dues because the Reagan administration objected to certain UN policies and the politicization of some UN agencies. The United States also sought to force changes in some UN procedures, especially those associated with budgeting, and it was supported by seventeen other UN members that withheld payments for similar reasons. These efforts resulted in new budgeting arrange-\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 26\n\n26\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\nments that allowed the organization’s major financial contributors to have greater influence. The third financial crisis arose in the late 1990s when again the United States used the “withholding tool” in an effort to secure twenty UN reforms contained in the Helms-Biden Agreement, passed by the US Congress in 1999. While the effort to fully resolve this round of arrears remained incomplete as of 2004, two of the most important objectives of the United States were achieved in late 2000 when US assessments for the regular budget and peacekeeping were lowered (see Smith, 2004). All three crises demonstrate that the major financial contributors to the UN have a powerful means of influence that they have been able to use effectively. The first two factors affecting a state’s ability to exercise influence at the United Nations, international position and financial contribution, generally benefit only the most powerful UN members. However, the preceding discussion sheds light on one of the most important mechanisms of influence available to medium and smaller UN members: the fact they represent a majority of UN members. If these states work cooperatively, they can relatively easily command a dominant voting majority in every UN body except the Security Council and forums that rely on consensus decisionmaking. Like-minded states realize that their power is multiplied when they form common negotiating groups (Keohane, 1967, p. 223). Such groups maximize the bargaining power of their members and allow for a division of labor across negotiations that are often detailed and complex (Hong, 1995, p. 280). These groups will be discussed as collective actors in the following chapter; for now it is important to understand that many of the UN’s political processes can be understood in terms of members’ trying to empower themselves through the use of coalitions and groups (Morphet, 2000, p. 261). Sometimes these groups remain fractured and disjointed; however, they can be a powerful tool for augmenting the ability of small states to pursue their interests through UN processes (Trent, 1995, p. 467). One of the most dramatic examples of the power of a large group of small states working together was seen in the 1970s, when such a group effectively set the agenda of the UN on issues such as the legacies of colonization and demands for a new international economic order (NIEO). A fourth and final factor that can affect the ability of a member state to get its way in the UN is its role in regard to the specific issue at hand. Some UN members possess sufficient power, money, or allies to exert influence across a wide range of UN issues; however, other members may lack all three of these resources and still be able to change the direction of UN action. This is true even in the case of relatively isolated smaller powers where they are directly involved in either causing or\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 27\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n27\n\nsolving a problem (Keohane, 1967, pp. 228–232). States directly affected by a situation tend to be more committed to seeing their preferred outcome achieved. More powerful states for which the issue has less salience may see clear advantages in deferring to the normally less influential member in this particular case. Even if the more powerful members remain directly involved, small, isolated members can influence the UN’s decisionmaking when it is their behavior that the UN is addressing. For example, across the 1990s Iraq’s sovereignty was severely circumscribed by the Security Council, as it authorized inspection regimes, no-fly zones, and strict controls on Iraqi oil exports. However, at least until early 2003, Iraq was able to have a significant impact on the nature of Council deliberations, since it was Iraq’s behavior the Council wanted to change. Iraq repeatedly used this to its advantage by offering last-minute concessions that frequently sidestepped key issues but created enough disunity among Council members that dire consequences were avoided. In essence, being a target of UN actions was itself a source of leverage within the UN’s political processes. Factors Affecting State Desire to Wield Influence\n\nAs we turn from factors that affect a state’s ability to exercise influence at the UN to factors that affect its desire to do so, it is important to consider the political processes through which a state determines its policy at the UN. Classic writings on international organizations often conceptualized this dynamic in terms of different types of domestic political regimes. A rather obvious focus, given the realities of the cold war, was on competitive (democratic) versus authoritarian regimes (Cox and Jacobson, 1973b, pp. 29–32); however, special attention was also paid to “revolutionary regimes” and how their goals and priorities in international organizations were to a large extent based on their histories of exploitation (Haas, 1968). An undercurrent in these writings is the assumption that democratic regimes would desire to play a more active and supportive role in international organizations, since their domestic political system is premised on the role that institutions can play in effective governance. However, the roller-coaster relationship between the United States and the United Nations over time, discussed above, suggests that trying to categorize a country’s desire to work through the UN based simply on its regime type is fraught with difficulty. More recent studies have offered greater detail in conceptualizing the relationship between a state’s domestic political system and its desired role in the UN. For example, the conclusion of one investigatation of how eight UN members (Algeria, Canada, France, Japan, the\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 28\n\n28\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\nNetherlands, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States) formed their foreign policy in relation to the organization was that while some states’ policy was formed by a small group of political elites in the executive branch, other states’ policy was influenced by legislatures and public opinion as well (Trent, 1995, pp. 494). These differences resulted in some states’ having a consistent and stable view of their role in the UN, while others, generally those with a more decentralized policy process, moving between UN engagement and UN neglect. The conclusion of a companion study that examined the same issue in regard to a different set of seven UN members (Germany, India, Sweden, Romania, Chile, Jamaica, and Sierra Leone) looked instead at variation in the relationship between the state and civil society (Knight and Krause, 1995, pp. 250–255). In countries with a strong state apparatus, the state’s orientation toward multilateralism in general, and the UN in particular, was often influenced by the desires of the top leaders. In some such cases, like Romania and Sierra Leone, there was little desire to work through the UN, but others, like Sweden, developed the opposite orientation. In cases where society was relatively autonomous from the state, like Jamaica, the study found that the country’s orientation to the UN was more variable, based on the interests that captured the state at various times. A second factor that affects a state’s desire to exert influence at the UN concerns the state’s past history, both within and outside of the organization. In terms of a state’s general history, a variety of experiences can cause the state to favor or not favor multilateral venues such as the United Nations: its colonial history (as master or subject), its reputation in terms of protecting the human rights of its people, its traditional allies and enemies, its geographic location, its position in the global economy, and its endowment of natural resources, to name some of the most cited examples (Trent, 1995, pp. 476–479; Knight and Krause, 1995, pp. 248–250). These historical experiences may not apply to all states, and the considerations just mentioned may push the same state in contradictory directions in terms of its orientation toward the UN; in any case, these experiences, where relevant, act as a filter through which a state must decide what role the UN will play in its foreign policy. A related consideration is the state’s past history specifically in relation to the UN. One way to think about this is the state’s historical “presence” in the organization (Pentland, 1989, p. 6). This certainly relates to the state’s power and financial contribution, but it also involves its level of participation in the organization: is it an active member, and has it provided Secretariat personnel, peacekeeping\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 29\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n29\n\ntroops, or leadership in UN bodies? Another aspect of a state’s history with the UN concerns any instances when the country has been on the receiving end of UN programs: has it been given assistance for development or decolonization, been the subject of a peacekeeping mission or human rights investigation, or been punished with multilateral sanctions? Finally, both large and small members are likely to calculate the future utility of the UN in light of how useful a tool it has been in the past (Trent, 1995, pp. 472–474). If the state has sought UN approval for a previous course of action, whether or not it received that support will weigh heavily in any future decisions about seeking UN legitimacy for its policies. A third factor that provides clues for understanding why some states choose to be more active in the UN’s political processes than others is their reputation in the organization. If a particular member enjoys a positive reputation in the eyes of its fellow members, its desire to draw on that reputation in order to achieve preferred outcomes can be significantly enhanced. This is especially true for those small and middle powers that over time have come to assume the role of brokers or “bridge-builders” in the United Nations (Kaufmann, 1980, pp. 17–18). These actors will receive additional attention in the following chapter and in Part 2 of the book; at this juncture it is important to stress simply that these states can enjoy a degree of influence in the UN well beyond what their power or financial contribution would suggest. That certain small and middle powers would play a central role in the UN is not surprising; in fact, certain UN activities like peacekeeping were designed specifically to take advantage of the characteristics of these states (Bennett and Oliver, 2002, p. 157). The most important of these characteristics are, first, their perceived impartiality or neutrality on key issues, which allows them some freedom to maneuver within the complex and shifting coalitions often found in UN bodies, and, second, their high level of consistent support for all UN activities, given that the principles of the UN are seen as forming an integral part of their national interest. The activities of brokers extend to nearly all issues on the UN’s agenda. For example, on human rights small and middle powers, especially those who are truly nonaligned with the major powers or offending states, were instrumental in moving the UN from simply drafting standards to actual monitoring and implementation in the 1980s (Forsythe, 1988, p. 254; Egeland, 1984, p. 208). Likewise, on the Law of the Sea negotiations in the late 1970s and again in the early 1990s, small and middle powers were instrumental in building the complex package agreements that were required to create the seabed mining regime and then modify its structure (Sanger, 1987, pp. 194, 210;\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 30\n\n30\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\nJoyner, 1996, p. 46). Member states that have performed this role include Canada, the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Senegal, Brazil, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Italy, India, Mexico, the Philippines, Argentina, Fiji, and Indonesia. The influence of brokers has become so important in UN decisionmaking that participants in its political processes are quick to lament their absence where they have chosen not to be active on certain issues, such as the negotiations to reform the Security Council in the mid-1990s (Smith, 1999, p. 191). The fourth and final factor that can affect a state’s desire to influence UN politics is certain areas of specialization or “niche issues” on which some states assume an active and constructive role (Hong, 1995, p. 283). This is especially important in the case of small states that lack the power or resources often associated with influence and whose participation is not required for resolving the problem at hand. In this case, the states want to influence the decisions simply because they find the issue highly salient to them or because they have developed some degree of expertise on technical aspects of the problem. Other members do not need to allow these states to wield influence, but they can find it useful to allow them to play an active role due to their passion, knowledge, and willingness to look for innovative solutions. Examples of small and middle states that have developed “niche issues” include Malta on the Law of the Sea and climate change, New Zealand on the safety of UN personnel, Singapore on UN reform, the Nordic countries and Fiji on peacekeeping, Sri Lanka on the Indian Ocean, and Mexico on nuclear disarmament (Hong, 1995, p. 283). A Typology of State Roles\n\nAs was mentioned above, the roles that any state plays in the United Nations are not constant and immutable; they often evolve over time based on changes in the state’s ability to wield influence and its desire to do so. However, over the course of UN history, numerous attempts have been made to categorize member states in groups based on the roles they play in the organization. These efforts are most commonly made by former practitioners, but international organization scholars have also offered observations in this regard. The results are often quite illuminating for outsiders who want a basic understanding of the dynamics at play in the UN; unfortunately, the typologies they offer are useful only as long as the constellation of state abilities and desires that they capture remains unchanged. The typology that will be presented here involves eight groups of states identified by Taylor (2000a, pp. 299–304) in the conclusion of a volume evaluating the UN at the turn of\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 31\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n31\n\nthe century. His typology is especially useful since his criteria for grouping UN members are very much consistent with the two sets of factors discussed above: “the orientation of their governments towards the organization and their status in the hierarchy of states at the global and regional levels” (ibid., p. 299). Taylor’s first four groups of states are major and middle powers that play an active role in the organization. His first group is status quo powers whose position in the organization is consistent with their status in the international system. The members in this group, the United States, China, and the Russian Federation, are all generally (though not always) willing to work through the organization because it contains certain structural elements (like the veto) that protect their perceived role and interests in international affairs. His second group is composed of status quo powers like Britain and France, whose position in the UN exceeds their status in the international system. These states see the UN as “suiting their interests”: their position in the organization enhances their status outside it by enabling them to “punch above [their] weight” (ibid., p. 300). His third group of states is “reformist”; members of this group, Germany, Japan, and Italy, consider their formal status in the organization to fall far below their significant contributions to it and their rising informal status. These states want to reform the organization such that their formal position in it is enhanced to better reflect the actual role that they play. The fourth group identified by Taylor is made up of “system-reinforcing problem-solvers” like Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, and Canada. These members are significant contributors to the organization and enjoy a high informal status within it; however, they are relatively unconcerned about obtaining a match between their status in international politics and their formal position in the UN. Turning to the developing world, Taylor offers four groups in order to capture some great differences between states that are often lumped together in other typologies. His fifth group again consists of “reformist” states, but in this case their claims for increased formal status within the organization are not matched by a corresponding status in the international system or a substantial enough contribution to the organization. For these states, including Brazil, India, and Nigeria, much of their claim for an enhanced status is based on their leadership in their respective regions; however, in each case this leadership has been questioned by other regional powers, like Mexico, Argentina, Pakistan, South Africa, and Egypt. The sixth group is composed of “system loading claimants” from the developing world, including most members of the Group of 77 (G77). These states have little to contribute\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 32\n\n32\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\nto the organization but still want to work through it, since they are on the receiving end of UN programs designed to help with their economic and social problems. This group is internally diverse, with some of its members fairly described as developing and other members more accurately seen as being close to collapse. The seventh group is also composed of “claimants”; however, these members (e.g., Yemen, Cuba, Sudan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and sometimes Algeria) believe that the organization is in drastic need of reform before it will be able to fully address their interests. Their focus is on structural reforms and collective action. Taylor’s final group consists of pariah states like Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Burma, which see no real positive benefit in their UN membership but remain in the organization solely in order to avoid the added costs they would suffer if they left. It is certainly possible to disagree with how Taylor has classified certain members, especially those whose role has changed due to new foreign policy priorities and capabilities. One could also question where certain states (like Israel) would fit in his scheme. Nevertheless, his typology is a useful mechanism for thinking about how the membership of states with different resources and different visions of the UN falls into distinct patterns. This in turn sets the stage for considering how member states actually go about representing their interests at the UN. While some of this discussion must wait until UN procedures are examined in Part 2, the next section of this chapter begins the process by exploring how members organize their permanent missions and structure their delegations. ■ Permanent Missions and Delegations\n\nUnited Nations members have varying priorities and visions for the organization; however, by and large all of them are in the organization because they receive certain tangible and intangible benefits from membership. Every member state has established mechanisms for pursuing its interests at the UN, most often in the form of a permanent mission and delegations. It is common for those unfamiliar with UN processes to lump these two mechanisms together, since their roles and functions are interrelated. Unfortunately, this simplification glosses over some important distinctions (Kaufmann, 1980, p. 103). A permanent mission is essentially a country’s embassy to the United Nations; its primary responsibility is to represent the interests of the state in the organization, much as an embassy would in a foreign capital. It is typically headed by an ambassador, staffed by foreign service officers, and func-\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 33\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n33\n\ntions continuously once established. A delegation, on the other hand, is composed of the personnel who are accredited to represent a country at a particular UN meeting or series of meetings. Their membership is temporary and often more diverse. A country’s permanent mission to the UN and the delegations it sends to UN meetings must work in a complementary fashion (Peterson, 1986, pp. 288–289). For starters, staff from the permanent mission are often included in delegations for specific meetings or conferences. In addition, one of the main functions of the permanent mission is to provide each delegation with the necessary support to effectively represent the country’s interests in negotiations. This support can include providing information on past UN efforts to address the issue at hand, analyzing key negotiating texts circulated before the meeting begins, identifying key individuals from other member states who are potential allies or adversaries, communicating with the home government, acting as the institutional memory for the delegation from one meeting to the next, and training new personnel in the dynamics of parliamentary diplomacy if necessary. The importance of this interaction will become evident as the basic features of permanent missions and delegations are discussed in the following paragraphs. Permanent Missions\n\nThe use of permanent missions in multilateral diplomacy is a development that really occurred only after the UN was established. More than forty members of the League of Nations created “permanent delegations” in Geneva; however, scholars have concluded that this development was of “no serious significance” (Walters, 1952, p. 199) and that the League essentially operated without them (Peterson, 1986, p. 288). The UN Charter did not specifically call for member states to create permanent missions in New York. Thus it is rather remarkable that by 1948 permanent missions were an integral feature of the United Nations. Several explanations for this rapid emergence have been offered: the fast-paced tempo of postwar diplomacy, the increase in meeting activity in the UN as compared to the League, and the fact the new organization was not located in a state capital where members might have already had a permanent diplomatic presence (Kay, 1967, p. 93; Appathurai, 1985, pp. 96–97). In addition, Article 28, Paragraph 1 of the UN Charter mandates that “the Security Council shall be so organized as to be able to function continuously. Each member of the Security Council shall for this purpose be represented at all times at the seat of the Organization.” It is likely that other states were simply fol-\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 34\n\n34\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\nlowing the example of Council members when they established their own permanent missions (Peterson, 1986, p. 288). In any case, permanent missions perform a variety of important functions for the member states beyond the services they provide to delegations. In many respects their functions are quite similar to those of any embassy: representing the interests of their country in all negotiations, reporting on developments that have either an immediate or a potential future impact on the country’s policy priorities, gathering information about the interests and positions of other participants, disseminating propaganda, and contributing to the process of formulating the country’s policy in the first place (Kay, 1967, p. 93; AggreyOrleans, 1998, pp. 50–51). However, there are also some functions of permanent missions that set them apart from bilateral embassies (Finger, 1990, pp. 18–22). For example, all the tasks just mentioned do not take place within the context of one other government; they are carried out in an environment where up to 190 other perspectives must be considered when one is drafting policy, designing negotiating strategies, and delivering propaganda. In addition, permanent missions must be aware of how to manipulate UN rules of procedure and be ready to offer specific proposals on a much wider range of issues than bilateral embassies must address. These differences have led some to suggest that permanent missions can function as if they were mini or shadow foreign ministries, somewhat free of direction from the home government (Finger, 1990, p. 22). The degree to which this is true depends on a number of considerations, including the nature of the issue, the quality of the mission’s staff, the size of the foreign policy bureaucracy in the home capital, and the attitude of the government toward the UN. These variations also have much to do with the personal attributes of the diplomats involved, so they will receive detailed attention in the discussion of delegate autonomy in the last section of this chapter. However, one general observation has been offered by several diplomats with experience in both bilateral and multilateral postings: these individuals felt that they enjoyed increased freedom of action in multilateral settings (Jacobson, 1979, p. 110). This conclusion is echoed by Seymour Finger: “The wide range of questions promotes a greater degree of autonomy for the mission, as few governments can keep track of so many details and the government is more dependent on the mission for relevant information” (1990, p. 20). Clearly permanent missions are an indispensable tool for members that desire to play any type of serious role in the United Nations. In February 2003 there were 191 UN members, 189 of which maintained\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 35\n\nMEMBER STATES AND DELEGATES\n\n35\n\npermanent missions at UN headquarters in New York (United Nations, 2003). The two member states not maintaining permanent missions were Kiribati and Palau; they did send representatives to UN meetings as they deemed necessary. In addition to member states, both the Holy See and Palestine sent observer missions to UN headquarters, the Holy See based on its status as a nonmember state and Palestine based on a standing invitation from the General Assembly to participate in its work. Twelve intergovernmental organizations, mainly regional in scope, and four nongovernmental organizations also sent observer missions to New York based on a standing invitation from the General Assembly. Finally, thirteen UN specialized agencies and related organizations maintained permanent liaison offices at UN headquarters. In addition to this extensive diplomatic presence in New York, most member states had permanent missions in Geneva to deal with the considerable number of UN bodies and meetings located in and around the Palais des Nations, and a number also maintained a permanent presence in Vienna, Austria, where the UN’s offices dealing with atomic energy, drugs, and crime are based. Finally, depending on a member state’s priorities and resources, it may also send small permanent missions to the offices of different UN programs, funds, regional economic commissions, and specialized agencies based in nearly fifteen other cities around the world. In spite of these many centers of diplomatic activity, the heart of the UN’s political processes lies in New York, and so the permanent missions there are generally staffed with the largest number and highest quality of personnel. Still, there is considerable variation in the size of permanent missions at UN headquarters from one country to the next. The largest mission by far is maintained by the United States, which had 125 diplomatic personnel in 2003 (United Nations, 2003). This size is due in part to the active role played by the United States in nearly every UN body and based on the fact that the US mission must perform a number of unique tasks given its role as host state. Other permanent members of the Security Council also maintain large missions, though not nearly as large as that of the United States. In 2003 the number of diplomatic personnel at the Russian mission was eighty-three, at the Chinese mission sixty-three, at the British mission forty, and at the French mission twenty-eight. Five other members maintained missions of thirty or more diplomatic personnel (Germany at sixty-one, Japan at fifty-two, Cuba at thirty-seven, South Korea at thirty-six, and Brazil at thirty). Nearly all other developed countries have missions in the neighborhood of fifteen to twenty-five, and the missions of a number of developing countries are this large as well. However, the majority of\n\nS-2 8/23/05 3:04 PM Page 36\n\n36\n\nMEMBERS OF THE TROUPE\n\ndeveloping states maintain only five to ten diplomatic personnel, and twenty-one members have missions with a staff of three or fewer. In 2003, the Central African Republic, the Marshall Islands, and TimorLeste (East Timor) had the smallest missions, staffed solely by an ambassador in each case. Not surprisingly, one of the primary explanations for this variation in the size of permanent missions is the costs associated with maintaining them, both in New York and in Geneva (Aggrey-Orleans, 1998, p. 48). This has always been especially true for newly independent developing states. However, other factors also play a role in determining the size of a country’s UN mission. For example, an additional reason developing states tend to have small missions is that these members often have a shortage of trained personnel, based on their colonial experiences (Kay, 1967, p. 96). Nevertheless, many new members have a strong desire to overcome this obstacle and maintain a mission that is larger than one might expect given their limited resources, because they see diplomatic service at the UN as an effective mechanism for increasing the training and experience of their foreign service personnel. Other reasons that small states may desire to have large missions include the common perception that a permanent presence in New York is an important manifestation of newfound independence and the fact that their UN mission is actually the centerpiece of their entire system "
