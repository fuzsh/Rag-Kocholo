        "text": "The rumor is Ronaldo will go for around 120M GBP. If I had to guess I think it will happen because the Glazers are desperate to make a statement and will feel like the owe Fergie for his total support, he's basically been the buffer between fans and Glazers. I think they get it done for him and if they do it will pay off big time.\n\nIf they played him wide his partnership with Rooney and RVP could be fucking lethal.\n\nEM, IYO will Juve finally show up and do something special in the Champs action? Maybe not enough talent? Playing well together it seems and Pirlo showing the last few years maybe a late bloomer but might go down as one of Italia's all-time greats? First Milan and now guiding Juve resurrection!\n\nHistorically you can never predict what Italian teams will do, although there's no doubt they have the best draw by getting Celtic.\n\nApprox CL odds:\n\nBarcelona 2\n\nReal Madrid 4\n\nBayern Munich 6\n\nBor Dortmund 7\n\nJuventus 10\n\nManchester United 14\n\nParis Saint-Germain 20\n\nShakhtar Donetsk 33\n\nArsenal 40\n\nMalaga 50\n\nFC Porto 50\n\nSchalke 04 50\n\nValencia 50\n\nAC Milan 80\n\nCeltic 150\n\nGalatasaray 200\n\nThis actually makes a ton of sense on many levels. His GF is a tv presenter, he likes California, pay would be good and it would be like semi retirement considering what he's used to.\n\nIf I had to guess I'd say Abramovich steps in and makes him stay and offers him a coaching/ambassador role after his career ends.\n\nApparently Mark Gonzales had a leg injury in November and his leg was almost amputated. More than an injury he has a condition and even his life was in danger. CSKA wants him out.\n\nManuel Pellegrini might make another master move if he secures Diego Lugano. Dude is a warrior, one of the main guys in the NT and Ancelotti don't want him in PSG. This would be a huge steal for Malaga.\n\nDoubt Man Utd can afford Ronaldo. Would cost in the region of 100m and with their ever increasing debt, I doubt they would be able to afford him. Unless, it's Ferguson's goodbye gift and Mourinho's wish to have him at Old Trafford.\n\nI remember Mark \"Speedy\" Gonzalez. Wish he was given another season at Liverpool. Guy was pacy but needed time to adjust. Scored a goal in the qualifying rounds of the CL, the season we reached the final. Also remember him putting on a cracker when Liverpool beat Arsenal 4-1, thanks to a Crouch hat-trick.\n\nI've been a big fan of Pellegrini. I wanted him at Liverpool after we sacked Rafa (what a fucking mistake that was!) but we instead went for Roy fucking Hodgson.\n\nThanks to Suarez, I've been watching a lot of Uruguay and have always been impressed by Lugano. Would be a solid signing for Malaga.\n\nI would love it if we had a Uruguay contingent at Liverpool, much like the Spanish one under Rafa. We already have Coates and Suarez, and I wouldn't mind us signing the likes of Cavani."
