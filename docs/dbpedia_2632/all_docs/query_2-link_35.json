        "text": "Well not much to report on the transfer front. It appears River is going to plan \"E\" regarding a new forward. This kid Sebastian Balsas who plays for Nacional in Uruguay has now been thrown into the mix. There are a couple of vids of him on youtube. The kid is a freaking giant though. Would be interesting to see him and \"Keko\" Villalva up front together. He scored two in this game for Nacional.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REGDiwTz4pg&feature=related\"]YouTube- Club Nacional de Football - C. Racing de Montevideo / Apertura 2009 - 2010[/ame]\n\nLots of Uruguayans are being thrown into the mix lately: apparently Juan Manuel Diaz (22 year old left-back who plays for Estudiantes) is close to becoming one of our first signings.\n\nHave you ever seen him played? (just a question)\n\nYou say over Nico Sanchez, but there's Cabral first to get rid off...\n\nYeah actually I've seen him play in quite a few games. Last year for Chile in the Toulon Tournament in France and also in a handfull of games for Catolica. I would actually rate him over both Cabral and Sanchez. He's solid and probably will be part of Chile's backline in the future.\n\nWell here we are on Christmas Day and there's a little bit of news report. Nothing about incoming players, but something about the possibility of an outgoing player. It appears Atletico Madrid is now interested in Diego Buonanotte. I say if they make a decent offer anywhere between $10-15 million, sell him. With that money, they could at least bring in two or three quality players. As it stands right now, I don't forsee them bringing in any quality players. Aguilar focked this club up so much before he left that it still remains in debt.\n\nSo it appears that Jackson Martinez (Colombian playing for DIM; broke the record for being the top goal scorer of all time in one Colombian season this year) and Claudio Bieler (Argentine playing for LDU of Ecuador, top goal scorer of the Copa Sudamericana 2009) are the new targets to reinforce our attack. Pablo Velazquez once again appears as an alternative, though Passarella would only go after him if no other forward is brought in.\n\nAs for the defense, there has been some progress in the attempt to bring back Roberto Ayala. Zaragoza has given us the green light, and \"el Raton\" is dieing to return: it all depends on whether or not we are quick to take action.\n\nI think only if they sell Kun they will have the money to invest for Buonanotte. Salvio is also on of their targets, his club demands 10 M € for him, lol.\n\nDue to Buonanotte's accident that will leave him out for the rest of the season, River will be requesting an additional reinforcement slot to replace Dieguito. AFA is expected to accept the request, so River will be attempting to bring both Bieler and Jackson Martinez. With the hypothetical five slots, Passarella will be aiming to bring in Claudio Bieler, Jackson Martinez, Juan Manuel Diaz, Roberto Ayala, and one more player. It doesn't necessarily mean that those players will arrive, but they are the ideal \"accessible\" candidates in Passarella's eyes.\n\nJackson Martinez looks like an interesting prospect. He's large, with good \"air play\" and a strong finish. Plus he has a lot of upside which is always a positive thinking in a future sell. Here's all his 18 goals this past season, he did score a lot of them in penalties,...\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL-59CUlkTk\"]YouTube- Jackson Martínez goleador de la copa Mustang II-2009, DIM campeón[/ame]\n\nJust like Jackson Martinez, Bieler stated that he would like to play for River. He even went as far as saying that he is willing to lower his salary if has to do so in order to play for us.\n\nPassarella will be meeting with the LDUQ forward's representative today to begin negotiating a possible arrival.\n\nAs for the Colombian, for now he seems closer to playing in Korea than in Nunez. Unless River presents a better payment option to DIM, Martinez's future is highly likely to be in Asia.\n\nI find this hard to believe. Why would Racing loan him out? They're not exactly the greatest team in the world, so why wouldn't they have room for him in the squad? Also, they're not really at a financial standpoint in which they should be buying players that they aren't going to utilize (it's not like they're the Argentine Real Madrid ).\n\nI wouldn't be surprised to see an investment group buy him and loan him to River, but the scenario you describe just doesn't seem realistic to me. Who knows, maybe that would be the case. But why would it?\n\nI didn't express it correctly, there are two bids for Bieler, one from River who would get him on loan and another bid which is Racing buying the 50% of his transfer. I think it's more or less the same scenario with Jackson Martínez, Racing wanted to get the 50% of his transfer, now not sure how they're getting the money.\n\nGotcha! Thanks for clarifying.\n\nLanus have now joined River and Racing in the fight for Bieler. They seem to have the most chances of acquiring him, due to the fact that they are a more stable team, will be playing the Copa next year, and will have money due to Eduardo Salvio's probable transfer to Atletico Madrid."
