He answered questions in a newspaper of the Jewish community of France, he speaks about his career as player and he also speaks about his link with the Judaism. I made a translation for those who do not understand the wonderful French language\n\n\"At first I have to specify that I have no family connection with ancient Great rabbi of France, Joseph Sitruk. Concerning my origins , my mother is French and my father was born in Israel. Then, he moved later in France in the Paris region. He passed on me the Jewish culture but I am not a follower.\"\n\nBesides, He has never been in IsraÃ«l but wants to discover the country, he has never suffered of anti-Semitism in his career and he thinks that Luis Fernandez will make some good work with the national team.\n\nHere is the article:\n\nhttp://www.actuj.com/israsoc.html"
