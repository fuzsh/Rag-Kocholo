        "text": "It's natural that everyone wants to win, BUT you you have to be realistic. Here you are berating your players who are out there, in hostile territory, fighting to win to make you and Jamaica proud. First of all, don't forget that you are playing Argentina, the #8 ranked team in the world, and the 2 time WC champions (How many teams in the world can make nthat claim?), who has spent YEARS and MILLIONS to develop a program and system with experienced administrators/directors, coaches and facilities that produce WORLD CLASS TEAMS. It is definitely NOT enough to have talented players/individuals in a TEAM sport, (remember the US basketball team a few years ago), and it is made worse when there is no clear program and system in place to produce a cohesive unit.\n\nSome have suggested that this was a weak Argentine squad, but don't think that this was a bunch of misfits they put out there. How many of these guys played on the team that defeated Ghana, Costa Rica and Panama? Do you think Argentina and more importantly Maradona wanted a squad that would have to fight to defeat Jamaica?\n\nLetâs take a look at some of the Argentine players: Federico Insua (Boca Juniors) â played 14 times for Argentina & has played for Spanish La Liga side MÃ¡lagaCF; German Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach (M4 euro transfer) & Mexican powerhouse Club America ($7.5M transfer).\n\nWalter Acevedo (Independiente) â (age 23) represented Argentina at U17 & U20 and senior level & is signed to Ukrainian Premier League side FC Metalist Kharkiv (UEFA Cup regulars).\n\nMartin Palermo (Boca juniors) â played 12 times and scoring 7 for Argentina & played for Spanish clubs Villarreal (â¬7.6M transfer), Real Betis & Deportivo AlavÃ©s.\n\nFranco Jara (Arsenal) â (age 21) recently signed by SL Benfica (â¬5.5M transfer).\n\nClaudio Bieler (Racing) âwon the Copa Libertadores with LDU Quito (â07 teamâs top scorer & â08 Ecuadorian Serie A top scorer â he scored 50 goals in 65 games at LDU Quito) & also played for Chilean powerhouse Colo-Colo.\n\nThere were also some young promising players who they are apparently grooming for the future: Gabriel Mercado (age 22) who has played for the U20 and seniors; Gabriel Hauche (age23) his 4 caps; Ignacio Canuto (age23) 3 caps and 1 goal; Leonel Galeano (age 18) 1 cap; NicolÃ¡s GaitÃ¡n (age21) 3 caps.\n\nJamaica has a good core of players they can build around and it is time for those in charge to step up and provide the training and TOOLS that Whitmore and other young, promising coaches need to develop winning Jamaican squads.\n\nRyan Thompson ('85)\n\nDwayne Miller (â87)\n\nDwayne Kerr (â87)\n\nRichard McCallum (â84)\n\nAndre Blake (â90)\n\nJermaine Taylor (â85)\n\nAdrian Reid (â85)\n\nKieron Bernard (â85)\n\nDemar Stewart (â84)\n\nDicoy Williams (â86)\n\nOâBrien Woodbine (â88)\n\nNicholy Finlayson (â85)\n\nKeneil Moodie (â86)\n\nChristopher Harvey(â82)\n\nO'Neil Thompson(â83)\n\nDemar Phillips (â83)\n\nRafe Wolfe (â85)\n\nEric Vernon (â87)\n\nRudolph Austin (â85)\n\nAkeem Priestley (â85)\n\nLovel Palmer (â84)\n\nDarren Pratley (â85)\n\nJason Morrison (â84)\n\nRicardo Cousins (â87)\n\nEvan Taylor (â89)\n\nDavian Thorpe (â89)\n\nDane Richards (â83)\n\nJamal Campbell-Ryce (â83)\n\nJe-Vaughn Watson (â83)\n\nLee Williamson (â82)\n\nCleveland Taylor (â83)\n\n***Marcus Milner\n\nSean Fraser(â83)\n\nJoel Grant (â87)\n\nRyan Johnson (â84)\n\nOmar Persad (â87)\n\nKeammar Daley (â88)\n\nReneil Sappleton (â89)\n\nNavion Boyd (â86)\n\nDevon Hodges ('84)\n\nOâBrien White (â85)\n\nLuton Shelton (â85)\n\nOmar Cummings (â82)\n\nThe Reggaeboyz will always have my support, when they are not playing the USA.\n\nHaving seen the game on tv (the first viewing was via internet), I think we played well inspite of the results. I'm still disappointed that we did not win and still believe that we need to learn how to protect the lead and close out the game.\n\nAll that negatives about Dwayne Murray were not justified! He kept well - not very good - but well enough to maintain his position as the # 1 in Tall P's absence. The first goal was stoppable but he got beat by the bounce. The second goal was a total team error. The Boyz defence was caught napping and Murray came out belatedly to try and punch the ball but his extended frame was a bit short of the mark. In the melee it was not surprising that Argentina were able to take advantage of the confusion and scored. Yet, in between the few dropped balls, Murray did well to prevent the Argentinians from scoring. There was one well placed shot for which the keeper had to dive full-stretched to his right to push out for a corner. Also, let's not forget that there were about two good shots that he had to leap high to push over the cross bar. The problem I had with Murray was with his ball distribution (which seems to be a problem with most Jamaican keepers). His kicks were wayward and his few throws just went to the opponent. Overall, he has the tools and the coaches (Tappa & Barrett) just need to work on his shortcomings in order to hone his skills.\n\nRyan Johnson is the real deal! The yute is poised, strong, skillful and works well with his team-mates. For me, he was the player of the match.\n\nShortman did not play well! I saw him play against the Haitians in Ft. Lauderdale and he was impressive. So, I'm just going to say he had a bad match. Hopefully he can bounce back!\n\nI've seen Lovel Palmer quite a few times now and this is the first time that I've been impressed with him. He had a good match and I think we lost our composure on the rightside and began lose the game once he was subbed out.\n\nCummings, Taylor, Reid, Daley & Austin all had a good game. Shavar Thomas was outstanding.\n\nDane Richards & Navion Boyd had below average games. Demar Stewart was rubbish; Jason Johnson is not quite ready and Devon Hodges did not impress."
