        "text": "Is a country that is struggling to stay in the top 100 of the FIFA ranking worth writing about? Does anybody even care about “soccer”, when there’s baseball, ice-hockey and other games, that use the name “football” for themselves?\n\nIt was important to me, that a Canadian voice is involved in writing this article to not be suspected of an ‘arrogant European view’ as there are several critical and progressive views everywhere in the country. I am happy to have collaborated with Yiannis Tsalatsidis throughout this article, YT has experience ranging from grassroots – club – college – high performance coaching and is one of the most promising young coaches in the country.\n\nIn his Keynote ‘The Development of Soccer in Canada’ Jason de Vos did not shy away from talking about the ugly truths within the Canadian system. This is expected from someone who holds the title of “Director of Development” for the country. One thing is clear, he does not fit the cliché of a know it all ex pro who claims to have all the answers based on past experiences.\n\nBorn in London, Ontario, he managed to have a respectable career and collected an impressive 170 appearances in the English second tier, fittingly called the ‘Championship’ and also lead Canada in bringing home a Gold Cup in 2000.\n\nCanada is ranked 10th in the world for registered players and that jumps to 7th when you only count youth players. Yet the country still struggles to crack the top 100 in the FIFA rankings. Regardless of the fact that most of these registrants play soccer for solely recreational reasons (most are looking for a second sport to play next to hockey) one thing is clear: Canada does not lack a player pool.\n\nEven with the consideration of Canada’s multi-sport culture (which should enhance player development) we still find a lack of player progression from this large pool. Instead, the organization of soccer in this context seems to be the major issue. The link between rather abstract problems from a macro level and the thousands of everyday playing/training experiences can be summed up in one word: Coaching.\n\nIn the next few paragraphs I will provide analysis from both a strategic and tactical point of view. Firstly, I will discuss general ideas and the ‘tactical culture’ in Canada (or the lack thereof). Afterwards, I will explore the recent performance of Canada’s men’s national team in the friendly versus Jamaica which will be supported with video material.\n\nFrom this, I will move on to discuss the professional spectrum of Canadian soccer and the tactical level of the respective teams in various leagues in North America linking it to the previous findings. This includes samples from rather randomly selected games. Reoccurring topics are again put into separate videos and graphics. I did something similar in my first ever article for Spielverlagerung.de, when I offered a critical view on German youth soccer.\n\nAt the end, I will share some personal insight to my (daily) working process in a local club. This will ultimately lead us back to the heart of it all: Coaching soccer.\n\nCanada’s tactical culture or the lack thereof\n\n‘We always need to talk and think football (soccer)’ – That was the message on repeat from world renowned soccer mind Marcel Lucassen to his players during a week-long camp in London, Ontario. What sounds like the most obvious thing to do, is often neglected in the world of coaching.\n\nThe main strategies seem to be shouting at the referees, which is often the case especially once a game reaches its tipping points. Or motivating the players through phrases like: ‘Let’s focus, guys!’, ‘Be strong!’ ‘Keep pushing’ et cetera. Some coaches also see a viable solution in shouting insults at their players without giving any transferable solutions of how to improve within the actual game context.\n\nCommunication is at the highest order in the soccer theory used by Raymond Verheijen. This doesn’t necessarily mean verbal communication but more importantly communicating in a non-verbal way. This non-verbal communication is at the heart of ‘tactics’ and what tactics really are. It is what distinguishes play between the different phases of the game.\n\nFor the individual, on the level of ‘game insight’, is all about performing soccer actions, that are as good as possible. The decision-making and execution can and should then be evaluated based on temporal-spatial components such as position, moment, direction and speed of the soccer actions, which makes it specific to any situation happening on the field. This is directly related to what people generally might call ‘technique’.\n\nEventually, it’s not only about performing better actions, but also more actions per minute for as long as possible and ensuring they are as good as possible. This is the true essence of soccer fitness. It is not to be separated from (verbal & non-verbal) communication and game insight, but inextricably linked to both of them on a lower order. If I don’t know where, when, and at what speed to run, my running is simply useless in a soccer context.\n\nIn Canada, the general perception of what’s needed from a fitness level is extremely decontextualized from the game of soccer. A common compliment is that he or she is a ‘great athlete’, and not that they are a ‘great player’ (emphasizing the most important part of soccer: playing, which is indirectly linked to game insight). This boosts the promotion of players born at the beginning of the selection period due to their physical dominance compared to other players, who can be born up to 12 months later – ‘relative age effect’.\n\nIn Canada, there is still too much time wasted with the obsession of perfecting techniques in isolation as well as focusing on instructional coaching methods that don’t justly prepare the players to deal with the true complexities of the game.\n\nMore times than not the training is so far removed from what the game actually looks and feels like that the players struggle to achieve what the coach incorrectly deems to be success in their quest for ‘technical perfection’.\n\nThe result? Players unable to create or exploit key spaces, unaware of cues and triggers in the game that give clues on how to act or unfamiliar with transition moments. Surely this method is not conducive of long term player development, which leaves us with a decisive question: Are the players we are progressing to higher levels of play doing so by strategic design or predominantly by chance?\n\n“The highest technique is to have no technique. My technique is a result of your technique; my movement is a result of your movement. I have no technique; I make my opponent’s technique my technique. I have no design; I make opportunity my design. One should not respond to circumstances with artificial and wooden prearrangement” – Bruce Lee\n\nAdding to that, the way of watching soccer is different in Canada than it would be in Western Europe where the culture offers much more experience to watching full games and directly or indirectly observing concrete football actions – be it only in the context of a social gathering.\n\nThis doesn’t imply, that the quality of observations is automatically at a higher level. The mere confrontation with the game from a young age itself is of high importance.\n\nCanadian children interested in soccer are starting to get more exposure to this information as it is more accessible than ever. An increasing number of players younger than 10 years old talk about and replay moments of big games like the Champions League final where they use their imagination to replay the moves of their idols Cristiano Ronaldo or Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nWhat would they see if they will watch their own national team play? Who is there to draw inspiration from? What does it look and feel like to play for the Red Maple Leaf?\n\nCanada’s national team\n\nSince March 2017, the Ecuadorian Octavio Zambrano has taken over the reins of the men’s national team, which has seen some significant changes in that time period. His predecessor Benito Floro, former coach of Real Madrid, showed the desire of Canada Soccer to move away from a rather British style of play focused on disconnected transitions, long channel balls, and tackling towards a more controlled game.\n\nThe grand seigneur didn’t have the expected impact. Octavio Zambrano, on the other hand has already changed the structure of the roster introducing younger players such as 16-year-old Alphonso Davies. Davies went on to win the golden boot and the best young player award at the Gold Cup and earned a spot in the best XI of the tournament in the process as Canada reached the quarter final.\n\nA certain courage is already visible in this and the aim is to reflect this in the playing style as well: ‘Now, within that identity of being a diverse nation, we can’t try to emulate playing like Germany, or like Dutch teams, or like Brazilian teams. We don’t have to do it, and we shouldn’t do it. We have to play like Canadians’.\n\nCanada set up in a usual 4-3-3 formation in their first test match after the Gold Cup against Jamaica. On one hand their game is heavily based around different rotational movements by the three central midfielders on the other a significant focus is placed on playing through the wings.\n\nIn the best periods of the game that leads to an easy manipulation of the opponent’s man-orientations. Against a zonal orientation and with space between the lines, the wingers tend to play a more prominent role as they come inside to occupy these zones while the full-backs push up. This was especially significant in the second half as Cardiff City player Junior Hoilett almost played a free role in behind Jamaica’s midfield.\n\nWhen the dynamic movements are done properly and in relation to each other, Canada is capable of beating the first pressing line(s) quite easily. However, problems arise due to their otherwise prevalent focus on stability in possession. The defensive midfielder Piette constantly drops and is oftentimes joined by both central midfielders Osorio and Hutchinson.\n\nAt the same time, the full-backs stay rather deep. Even if progression is possible during the buildup, there’s nearly no presence in higher zones or inside the opponent’s block. Strategically speaking, there’s no direct solution for the second next pass. This results in a recycling of the ball of where play (in accordance to the collective line of thought) must start over and over again, which naturally costs time.\n\nThe structure is oftentimes only beneficial for keeping the ball without exploiting strategically valuable spaces. Central occupation is neglected and if available, the first look is to turn or face outside, not to the open towards the middle. The necessary play from side to side is either only possible through back passes or through direct switches into relatively isolated situations.\n\nAt the same time, the dropping players don’t find themselves in favourable situations as their body position is generally closed. They are facing their own goal instead of being able to face forwards and find more advanced players. Even if the opponent lets them turn, the defense has time to adjust their positioning and their forward options won’t be as accessible.\n\nThe orientation on the field is also an issue. Often times the movement off the ball results in blocking passing lines or not respecting the space of teammates in a better position. In a positional style of game the players need a better understanding of how to stay in their zone and when to change positions or not.\n\nAt the same time, there’s no collective and coordinated understanding where possible movements create spaces for others. For example, if everybody shows for the ball and is followed, there’s logically either space in front of the opponent’s defense or behind it. To which movement do I play and to which not?\n\nOutside runs for examples have the main purpose of dragging away opponents and create space somewhere else. If you see outside runners mainly as pass receivers, you will again oftentimes come in situations, where they face the touch line and can’t effectively progress.\n\nThese are not overly sophisticated concepts, this is of course if they are taught throughout the developmental process. Everybody somehow knows, how to count to three and should be capable to see, where a numerical superiority is. But of course, this needs to be experienced in game situations and constantly mentored by knowledgeable coaches.\n\nNot playing with a clear idea of these general concepts, leads to a highly volatile kind of game. Decisions appear to be random and lacking an intention. In similar situations players might act completely different due to lack of understanding or awareness.\n\nAnother example, that is also crucial for the playing style of teams like Barcelona: When do I need to dribble and when to pass? If a center back has space in front of him and the full-back is too deep to be in a better position than him while all central options are covered – Why does the center back need to pass? His dribbling will lead to a first progression and will eventually drag one or more opponents out of their position. This space is then free to be occupied by a team mate for a pass.\n\nIn the final third, the main focus shifts to occupying the box with as many players as possible as soon as possible. This leads to highly static crossing situations, if the ball isn’t sent in immediately. As the different phases of the game are connected and directly depend on each other, this also creates a big problem in the moment after losing the ball as the space in front of the box is not covered properly and the players don’t possess the habit to immediately win the ball back after they lose it – collectively referred to as counterpressing.\n\nAs already shown in moments of the previous videos, Canada sometimes still creates a good structure for counterpressing, but doesn’t use it properly. Runs are either completely halted, slowed down, or turned around to go backwards (an imbedded defending habit in the Canadian DNA). Or the direction of applying pressure is not correct as the opponent is not guided toward favourable zones where there are supporting players or the sideline, but instead they are allowed to turn towards the middle.\n\nThis is another basic strategical concept, which is even more intuitive to most players, but needs to be taught systematically. Let’s look at the game of our 7-year-olds which consists of constant transition and counterpressing. Inexperienced coaches do not like the idea of not having control and instead confuse and attempt to bring order to the game through rigid positioning at the youngest ages ‘Stay in your position’, ‘You’re a defender today’. But once they reach a certain age then suddenly everything is expected to change and become fluid?\n\nOffensive transitions fit a majority of Canada’s players better as they are generally more used to play in this phase of the game with larger spaces that can be exploited through fast attacks. Still, the movements closer to the goal aren’t always well communicated as players tend to attack the same spaces at the same time.\n\nThe initiation of counter attacks seems to be even more problematic at times in the first stage of counters. When there’s a huge space for a counter-attack, the decision-making to play away from pressure is not always adequate to the situation. Under direct pressure the orientation into depth is not success stable enough to exploit deficits of the opponent’s structure.\n\nIf we take a look at the organized pressing of Canada, there’s the same inconsistency. In the first example, we see Jamaica attacking basically the same space in front of Canada’s box. In the first case, Hoilett stops his pressing and the opponent can attack with more speed. Raheem Edwards doesn’t know, whether to attack the ball or to cover space (and which space?). A dribble through the middle is quite easy.\n\nIn the second case, Hoilett faces the player with the ball and attacks him. The opponent again dribbles towards the middle, but is surrounded by three players and forced into a trap this time, where he can only lose the ball. Counter for Canada.\n\nIn their best pressing moments, the Canadian team can effectively force the opponent towards the touchline and create a numerical superiority in order to attack the ball carrier with two or more players. Most of the time, the team relies on creating favourable individual pressing moments where they can aggressively defend opponents that are facing backwards. From this, local compact situations can be created.\n\nEspecially in a higher press with situationally higher intensity, there’s a good tendency to occasionally disrupt the opponent’s build-up and to create promising transitional moments. But most of the time only the advanced players push higher and follow movements of their respective opponents.\n\nThe result: A highly disconnected structure without having collective access to the ball. Especially the space in between midfield and back line which is vulnerable as the latter drops back too early due to being worried more about direct opponents and about disadvantages in speed than about the coherence of the team.\n\nThe overall movement and communication within the back line doesn’t meet general standards. The center backs are used to following their players instead of shifting through to the ball side to increase the compactness and to situationally attack the ball carrier.\n\nAt the same time, they don’t react adequately to closed (pushing up) and open (dropping) ball situations and don’t cover the respective zones of their team mates well enough once they step out. At the same time, spaces in front of the back four are exposed and open for rebounds as the midfielders don’t fill gaps consequently enough, especially from the ball far side.\n\nThe biggest flaw in the pressing system of Canada is the general tendency to man-mark, which the behavior of the back line only exemplifies. The first orientation is usually to look for a direct opponent and to follow him. A highly reactive approach (as often enough discussed on this blog). You make yourself dependant on the opponent’s structure and constantly open spaces, especially when there’s no continuous pressure on the ball.\n\nAgainst superior players who can beat you easily in direct duels there will be a general disadvantage. You can only rely on the back four to not allow easy breakthroughs after the progression through midfield will inevitably happen. Against Canada, the easiest way to exploit man-marking is to drag the respective full-back towards the middle and attack the open space. This already proved to be an issue during the Gold Cup.\n\nThe box coverage can also turn out to be problematic against fast attacks from the sides. After breakthroughs, when the opponent attacks with speed the deeper players will drop back altogether and might struggle to orient themselves between players and ball. This results in the space in front of the box being vacated. The area around the far post is usually vulnerable to chip balls in behind the furthest defender.\n\nFull footage of Canada versus Jamaica available on YouTube.\n\nCanada’s professional teams\n\nAt the moment, there are only seven Canadian teams that play in professional leagues within the North American system. There’s no direct regulation for the number of Canadian players required in the roster as US Americans also count as domestic players. According to transfermarkt.de, only 22 of the 87 players, or roughly 25%, in the rosters of the three MLS teams Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps and Montréal Impact are Canadians. Adding to that, most of them are not even starters or regular members of the game day roster, which reduces the Canadian influence in the MLS to a minimal degree.\n\nIf you add the USL teams Ottawa Fury, Toronto FC II and Vancouver Whitecaps II as well as NASL team FC Edmonton, the ratio goes up to 47.33% (80 of 169). This is mainly due to the two reserve teams, that include more domestic talent, which is often neglected in the further stages. Without them, there’s a ratio of 38.7% (41 of 106) Canadians in the professional senior teams, which is for example significantly less than in Bundesliga (47.5%), Serie A (46.2%) or La Liga (57%), even if you consider the small sample size. Only the English Premier League has a much lower percentage of domestic players: 32.5%.\n\nWith Mauro Biello (Montréal Impact), Jason Bent (Toronto FC II), Colin Miller (FC Edmonton) and since a few weeks also Julian De Guzman (Ottawa Fury) at least four of seven head coaches are Canadians.\n\nTactically, this doesn’t change a lot compared to the national team. You can observe many of the same basic flaws with a few more pronounced positives added.\n\nAgainst the ball, there equally is a clear tendency towards man-oriented pressing systems, that leave exploitable gaps in midfield and within the back line.\n\nThe New York Bulls have been one of the most interesting MLS teams ever since Jesse Marsch took over in 2015. You can still observe the typical RB style, playing the most intense soccer in North America with a focus on counterpressing and quick combinations, that prominently feature lay-offs. The structure has evolved from more of a 4-2-3-1 towards a back 3 with a diamond-ish midfield in front of that, with two wingbacks that can adjust their positioning fluently and one versatile striker upfront.\n\nIn the following graphic, you can clearly see, how their playing style can manipulate the man-orientations of Montréal Impact. The team from Québec tried to execute this pressing quite intensely, but struggled with the speed of the Red Bulls’ execution and couldn’t maintain their defensive actions for 90 minutes. This inevitably lead to a 4:0 loss for the Canadian side.\n\nThe problem with Canada at dealing with long balls was already evident. Interestingly, teams that operate with a lot of long balls have similar or even worse problems. The defenders stand alone and are again more oriented towards individual players instead of structuring themselves in a functioning back 4, that covers in a triangle for players pushing up.\n\nIndividually, the ball is often left to bounce in front of the defender or there is a failure to use the balls air travel time to get in front of the player. Instead, he pushes him from behind and causes free-kicks, often times from dangerous positions close to the box. When the opponent faces their own goal with no available options they are oftentimes not pressed the back line stays deep and the respective player can turn. An obvious pressing trigger is not used.\n\nDifferent formation, same problems. Toronto FC usually plays in a 5-3-2 against the ball. This generally makes stepping out easier as you still have four players in the back to cover. Theoretically, also the central compactness should get better. On the other hand, the communication with five players can be harder than with four, especially when there don’t seem to be the same triggers that every player reacts to.\n\nIn this case, Andrea Pirlo has an open ball and is not attacked by any midfielder. The center back and the right half-back of Toronto already step back, the right wingback man-marks, while the orientation of the left-sided players remains unclear. Two players are free in the center. No problem for the Italian Maestro to pass to one of them. But a bad offensive structure of New York City FC prevents a breakthrough more effectively than any pressing approach.\n\nThe lack of collectively recognizing pressing situations is not only visible in situations, that are related to long balls, but also when it’s about pressuring opponents, that receive passes inside the block, in the access area of two or more players. Who attacks the ball? Does somebody need to do it at all?\n\nAlso, when a line of pressing is beaten, there’s oftentimes passivity instead of backwards pressing or shifting to provide cover. Result: Numerical disadvantages, frequently in wing areas, but also in more valuable central zones.\n\nThere’s a distinct habit to go back close to the own box, especially visible at the reserve team of Toronto FC, which plays in a similar 5-3-2 formation like their first team. Even in situations, when the team has clearly more players behind the ball than the opponent has upfront, team mates are constantly left to solve 1v1 situations against physically superior players, while there’s no clear zonal responsibility inside the box.\n\nFelipe, the defensive midfielder of the New York Red Bulls, drops back to receive the ball and can dribble for a few seconds without being attacked. Sascha Kljestan and Daniel Royer position themselves in the gaps of the passive pressing formation. A pass to one of them provokes the central defenders to step out and to leave gaps. The Red Bulls play through to the far side, where the winger doesn’t participate in the pressing. Within a few moments, the game was carried from one side to the other. A 2v1 in the half-space close to the box is created.\n\nThere are, of course, positives to take away from the analysis. For example, the reserve team of the Vancouver Whitecaps plays quite an interesting and centrally compact 4-3-3-0, that forces the opponent to play on the wing. There, the team of coach Rich Fagan, can ideally attack the ball from different angles. The team usually plays quite zonally in their orientations. A player from the second pressing line can push up to press the ball and will be covered by a player from the first line.\n\nThe Ottawa Fury with assistant coach Jed Davies generally show a clear pressing plan, using a 4-2-3-1 or 3-4-3/5-4-1 formation. They create compact situations in the wing areas to win the ball with many players around, who can directly be involved in securing possession or for counter-attacks.\n\nA lack of pre-orientations (often linked to unfavourable body positions) is one of the most fundamental problems for a controlled possession based game. This leads to situations where the positioning on the field prevents progressive passes due to the unawareness of cover shadows, teammates on a communication level, and (group tactical) structure.\n\nThis is interrelated to a tendency where pre-planned passing patterns like long switches or balls behind the back line are chosen in favour of playing or creating better solutions from the situations themselves. As a result of those factors you can observe the same inconstancy in both the individual and of course the collective decision-making.\n\nAnother example of failed passing communication from the MLS team of the Vancouver Whitecaps. The team of Welsh coach Carl Robinson is lined up in a 4-2-3-1 with deep full-backs. The left one is in possession of the ball and has no options as the defensive midfielders stay in the cover shadow and the left center back doesn’t support. The central attacking midfielder drops for the ball, while the left outside midfielder pushes up. Both happen too late. The pass into the empty center can easily be intercepted.\n\nOn the other hand, there are enough examples where the players are able to play in tight spaces and under pressure – even when they are clearly outnumbered. It should be noted that bad orientation is not always due to a lack of player ability.\n\nHow Toronto FC scored against New York City FC: Right wingback and right central midfielder push the opponent back on the wing. The pressing is completely unstructured as Giovinco drops back to the space in front of the box, where he can receive the ball without being attacked. Afterwards, it’s unclear, whose responsibility that is. Arguably the best player in the league can dribble towards the goal and perfectly places a shot in the top corner.\n\nAs the graphic above demonstrates, the central zone which is of great importance is often poorly defended in North America. Against a compact pressing formation, the pass towards the center would usually not be the most effective way to directly progress the play. There’s much more manipulation necessary to create central space. But even with compact defending the first look still needs to be central to the one inside. If there’s space: Directly exploit it.\n\nHalf-back and wingback are already wide. Question 1: Why do you need to run outside? Question 2: Why should you play to a player running outside, when he just reaches the touchline?\n\nHaving written all of this there’s one thing that I should clarify. Long balls can be a viable way of attacking. If you use them in a smart way and have a good structure for second balls. This used to be the core identity of how RB Leipzig played, before Ralph Hasenhüttl and coaching staff took the game in possession to the next level. Long balls can still be used as a tool, however only if the situation is right.\n\nThe Ottawa Fury provide some examples of how this is also the case in the USL: numbers around the destined long ball zone, movement into depth. If you just kick the ball somewhere, you depend much more on individual runs and pressing efforts. If they fail, your attack automatically breaks down or you are exposed for a quick counter attack. Why should you play a long ball, when you are not well organized for rebounds and have a short option available with space in front of it?\n\nI also compiled moments, when the center is used properly, for example most effectively through diagonal passes on the ground, directed towards one of the half-spaces. When the opponent actually covers the center, you might chip the ball in behind the center backs or in behind the full-backs. Or you drag them out of position to attack the space for receiving through balls on the ground. With the ball being round everything is possible and passes in the air can and should also be used.\n\nThe less connected the structure in possession, the harder counterpressing becomes. Especially when the players move to the last line and stay there after losing the ball. Then the attempt to win the ball back will become impossible as the outnumbered defence (players left behind the ball) needs to go back and faces a dilemma without support.\n\nThis problem of dealing with counter-attacks after the initial pressure is beaten, increases as defenders follow players instead of helping to condense the space in the center and forcing the opponent to the sides, where the attack would slow down and team mates could track back. In extreme examples, one player might even stay more than 10 meters behind everybody as kind of a “sweeper”, because there’s no communication within the back line of how to deal with counter-attacks, especially when being outnumbered.\n\nFull footage of USL/Canadian Championships taken from YouTube:\n\nOttawa Fury versus Toronto FC II\n\nSan Antonio FC versus Vancouver Whitecaps II\n\nFC Edmonton versus Ottawa Fury\n\nFC London: A practical example\n\nThe League 1 Ontario was established in 2014. The league usually runs from end of April/beginning of May until October. It is considered a regional third tier behind the professional American leagues. Geographically, most teams are based in the greater Toronto Area with teams from Windsor, London and Ottawa being the exception.\n\nThe main purpose of the league is to build a bridge between the long-term player development in the Ontario Player Development League (OPDL) and the professional side of soccer. Therefore, U23 players should play a special role: In the game day roster (of 18 players) there needs to be seven players younger than 23. The starting eleven must at least contain four players of this age group.\n\nThis still leaves space to include older players that played professionally previously and still want to perform on a higher level above and beyond the Sunday league. This is especially boosted by the semi-professional structure of the league. If you want to and have the resources you are allowed to pay players. Adding to that, you can include up to three international players, e.g. international college players, who want to spend their summer playing soccer.\n\nDue to these regulations, League 1 Ontario can be seen as a very diverse league. Some teams entirely focus on playing young players for developmental purposes and without caring too much for results, as there is no relegation. Most famously, the third team of Toronto FC, which is basically their U19 plays in the league. Other teams use the minimum number of younger players and build their teams around ‘stars’ of the province in order to compete for the league title. The rest follow a mixed approach.\n\nIn the last six months, I had the pleasure to be part of the coaching staff at FC London, located two hours west of Toronto. The club already had its inaugural season the year before as Croatian coach Mario Despotovic did a lot of pioneer work as he lead his team to the league final and changed the whole club culture in the process. At the time of my arrival, there was no more discussion a culture had been set in place: Training should only be done in game realistic set-ups with opponents and the Periodization model of Raymond Verheijen was in place.\n\nWhen Despotovic left to become the head coach of Hajduk Split’s U19 team in his home country, his compatriot Domagoj Kosic, a former professional player at Dinamo Zagreb took over. I was lucky enough to meet him right after my arrival and got to know one of the most open-minded, straightforward, and knowledgeable characters on this level. Everything, that the team achieved and will continue to achieve, happened because of him.\n\nWithout any prejudices, we started to exchange thoughts about the game right away. He saw David Goigitzer, Austrian author at Konzeptfussball, who coaches in the FC London Academy, and me as equal to him, even though in the eyes of most established soccer coaches we would have probably been just some random young guys, that pretend to be smart.\n\nWith this spirit, we faced the first challenges together. Many players of last year’s roster weren’t available at the beginning of the season. The players of the U21 team mostly came from other clubs and systems. There are no big possibilities to make selections. They still possessed a lot of (hidden) potential, but were without any idea of how to use their abilities tactically on a soccer field.\n\nAfter the first successful season, our task was to work on the next milestone: Establishing a sustainable system with young players continuously coming through to play central roles in the League 1 Ontario team. Our asset: A highly motivated coaching staff and committed players, who are eager to learn.\n\nWe lost all of our first league games. The U21 got beaten by a team from the bottom of the league – 6:4. At the same time, the League 1 Ontario, was thrashed by Toronto FC’s third team in a 6:0 defeat. Probably one of the defining learning moments for myself, as I saw clearly as never before, how a game plan can generally work, but still fail in a dramatic way.\n\nWe analysed the opponent for weeks based on some games, that were played in a U19 tournament in Italy. Afterwards, we decided to press in a 3-4-1-2, that should guide the opponent towards the left side of their 4-2-3-1. There, our wingback was supposed to push up in order to win the ball. This worked well for 30 minutes. Although our ball wins were not clean enough, we created some favourable 2v1/3v2 moments, that weren’t used properly.\n\nThen our high line broke down against the speed of Toronto FC’s young prospects. A threat, that we had underestimated in our analysis. After being 1:0 down, our structure to keep the ball was still intact, but the cover for transitional moments proved to be too unbalanced. Counter-attacks killed us.\n\nNonetheless, we started the new training week, with the same spirit as usual after an extensive analysis of our shortcomings. The next opponent was supposed to be weaker and it would be easier to establish a controlled possession game to gain stability. Against the 4-1-4-1, that they used in the first league game, we would position ourselves in a 3-2-4-1 to overload the space around their defensive midfielder. In pressing, we would mainly take care of their long balls, sitting back in a 5-2-2-1/5-4-1. Most of the game was spend with us on the ball.\n\nA key element for us was to create an effective relationship between the attacking midfielders and wingbacks. They were connected and covered through the defensive midfielders while at the same time getting support by the striker, whose basic task would be to drop back to offer a central passing option.\n\nThe main zone to break through would be one of the half-space with either the ball far attacking midfielder dropping or with somebody attacking the space in behind one of the opponent’s full-backs.\n\nThis was the starting point for our organisation of the coming week. A large part of planning process for training tactical awareness starts with being able to analyze the many possibilities that can occur from specific interactions during a game similar to what was done in the previous parts of this article.\n\nWithout this basic understanding, it becomes extremely difficult for the coach to plan their work. The analysis informs and shapes the way you will work. There is no such thing as a training methodology without analysis. They are interrelated and influence one another. JD offered a great example of an analysis leading to the creation of training exercises in a previous article, whereas RM provided a lot of invaluable insight on how to create a game model.\n\n“During the defensive stage, I start analyzing the many possibilities that may occur. Then I translate them into a training exercise where there are opponents. Finally, I translate them into a game. During the offensive phase, I offer some guidelines keeping in mind what the opponents layout is. Here too, I follow the methodology mentioned above for the defensive stage, beginning with analysis. With Juventus, when we had established our identity I was using many theme games in practice. For two purposes: To give good motivation to my players, and not to annoy them with exercises regarding things they already know” – Marcello Lippi\n\nThe exercises should come from the knowledge of the coach and it should come easily to him from the analysis process. Actually, it is a big mistake to copy the work or training that is so accessible now through the internet. The art and skill of coaching comes from adapting your training to your reality and what you have analyzed. What we see and learn from others should be used instead to inspire one to create their own work.\n\nOur week after the game versus Toronto FC’s third team started with recuperation, that included specific tactical moments for the next game with an emphasis of playing in the last third. The attacking team was set up in a 2-4-1 versus a 4-3 block, whilst having a 2v1 rest defence next to the halfway line. The defenders were instructed to first defend rather passive and wide, then narrower. In the end, they became active. Different options of how to break through were presented to the players in the process, similar to the ones shown in the graphic.\n\nWithout having a consistent pre-season within the periodization model, we decided to not have a specific conditioning session with all players, until the roster would be complete in the week after. Instead, we managed the workload individually within the different game forms throughout the week.\n\nThese were based around playing in numerical superiority and transition to counterpressing afterwards. Situations of local numerical superiority were also linked to keeping possession of the ball beforehand, which was another big topic for the week. In this context, we would specifically work on how to effectively use chip balls and diagonal passes on the ground.\n\nTraining games used throughout the week\n\nGame is played in the double the size of the penalty area. It always starts with one of the goalkeepers. He plays to one of the sides, where one attacking player is alone and not attacked. He brings the ball in the middle with a chip ball or with a flat pass and doesn’t participate afterwards. In the middle, two of his team mates play against one defender. If they score, the game starts from the beginning. If they don’t score (save, ball out etc.), two of the defenders from next to the goal come inside and start an attack together with their team mate in a 3v2. Once somebody scores or the ball is out, the game starts from the beginning.\n\n12 players (split into 2 groups of 6 with teams of 3)\n\n6 rounds\n\n1 minute work for one group\n\n1 minute rest\n\n1 minute work for the other group\n\n7v5 possession game on around 30*30 meters with a box of around 5*5 meters in the middle. Attackers score by playing 10 passes or by playing to a player in the middle zone, who plays to a third man with one touch. At first, there are no restrictions on how to occupy the zone in the middle. Later the player in the middle position must be constantly changed (if the ball is not played there for around 5-10 seconds). Defenders are not allowed to enter the middle zone until the ball is played there: 5 passes after winning the ball = 1 point or passing the ball out of the field (ball in the air allowed) to a team mate, that receives it there = 1 point.\n\n6 rounds\n\n1 minute work\n\n2 minutes rest\n\nGame always starts in the middle third with a 6v6+1 possession game (4-2 formation). After 5 passes the team in possession can progress towards the opponent’s goal through playing a pass to the end zone. There, a 3v2 is played until the ball is out or a goal is scored. Then the game starts from the middle, again.\n\n5 rounds\n\n2 minutes work\n\n2 minutes rest\n\nThe whole field is used, but divided into three zones. 5 passes in every zone before progressing to the next one. Final zone: 5 passes before scoring.\n\n10 minutes work including tactical instructions\n\nThe game starts with a 5v1 situation for the build-up team. Goalkeeper is not allowed to participate. After every 3 passes, the pressing team adds another player until they play in a 5v5 situation in the first half of the field. Then, the attacking players on the other half can come inside. Either the two attacking midfielders go next to the remaining defender inside the field or the striker drops back (defender is not allowed to follow). Attacking team then tries to score. If the defenders win the ball, they score on the opposite side. After every ball that goes out the game starts again from the first field.\n\n6 rounds\n\n2 minutes work\n\n2 minutes rest\n\nBuild-up team always starts with the ball in front of the empty big goal. They play in a 3-2-4-1 against a 4-1-4-1 pressing. Put four zones inside the field (ca. 15m length each, penalty box width). The middle zones must be occupied by min. two players at all times whilst the occupation of the first and last zone depend on the situation and on how high the ball possession takes place. On the wing, there can be two players (half-back and wingback) when the build-up takes place in the own half, and one player when the possession is in the opponent’s half. Possession team can score normally on the other side. If the pressing team wins the ball they can score in the empty big goal (1 point) or in the two smaller goals on the sides (2 points).\n\n3 rounds\n\n5 minutes work\n\n2 minutes rest\n\nAs usual in soccer, a few things went different during the game to what was expected beforehand. We still were in possession of the ball for most of the time, but the opponent defended with a bigger central focus, using more of a 4-2-3-1 formation. This changed the roles of our attacking midfielders from staying centrally to being more involved in the outside half-spaces and also moving more towards the wing. During half-time, we changed to a 3-4-1-2, once again, that helped to solve some of the problems. Problems in positioning of the wing-backs remained and were addressed in the video analysis after the 1:0 win.\n\nFor the next game, the home opener, we opted for a riskier approach with some players returning, that are more capable of playing different roles. We showed the team in short videos, how Pep Guardiola’s teams used inside full-backs to play in a 2-3-5/2-3-4-1 formation and focused more on attacking the spaces in front and behind of the opponent’s back line, whilst applying a more aggressive counterpressing in those areas. It eventually lead to a 4:0 win. But based on the type of game and opposition, we continued to also use formations with three players in the back or rather orthodox back four roles.\n\nThis process of adjusting to the circumstances continued throughout the season in a similar fashion like the example shown above. At the same time, some of the core principles of our game mainly the general rules of space occupation in possession and zonal defending stayed the same and became more established from week to week.\n\nAs the season went on especially the U21 team (a side mainly consisting of players born in 1999) became one with the game idea, as their own individual and collective characteristics helped to evolve towards a more direct style. This style will set the standard for a unique brand of soccer in London throughout the next years. With a much more pronounced focus on counterpressing and intensity against the ball, the U21 team for example beat Toronto FC’s U17 (born 2000) in an exciting fashion, scoring eight goals, conceding two.\n\nAt the end of the season more and more older players had to leave to fulfill other duties, mainly at college or university. U21 players that weren’t expected at all to do so, played full games in the League 1 Ontario team. In this time, we scored some of the best team goals of the whole year.\n\nThis is, why Jürgen Klopp famously said: ‘If we have a good idea, we try to bring it on the pitch, and that needs time. I believe in training, sometimes I feel I’m the only one in this country who believes in training, only others believe in transfers. I love this game because training can make the difference’. It doesn’t only prove to be true for players and the tactical communication on the field, but also for coaches or analysts, that try to go down that route. You learn something every day. Sometimes you will feel like a worse coach, but in the end, you can only be a better one.\n\nFull footage of all League 1 Ontario matches is available on YouTube.\n\nConclusion\n\nPeople tend to fear conflict and want to get some kind of consent. But there’s no consent between the prevalent way of “coaching” in Canada and actual coaching. It’s two totally different things.\n\nAs if you would have a conversation like this: “Let’s buy shoes” – “But this is a spoon” – “Okay, we’ll find some compromise”.\n\nAs outlined, there are enough problems to solve in Canadian soccer and that’s most definitely not a bad thing as long as the right attitude is adopted and there is a constant experimentation of trying new ideas, reassessing them, and finding more solutions.\n\nIf you are already the best, there’s little to improve. Then it becomes about the marginal gains and you need to look much harder to find the slightest growth areas. If you are 95th in the FIFA ranking, on the other hand some basic things should improve right away. If you begin the work immediately and with the youngest ages will begin to see small changes pretty soon. But over time they will continue to add up to become big changes. And who knows, maybe one day a culture will set in and Canada can be a consistent on the big stage.\n\nOn the last day of the transfer window, you will always see remarkable transfers being made and this season was no exception. We took a look at the situation in Denmark where two transfers caught our attention in particular.\n\nThe biggest transfer ever on the Danish transfer market was Alexander Sørloth’s move to Crystal Palace for what could be end up being a 16 million Pounds transfer with all bonus payments included, while a young Ukrainian player in Artem Dovbyk replaced him in the Danish team. When you take into account that Sørloth was bought for just 400,000 Euro eight months earlier, the record transfer is even more interesting to study. The team is FC Midtjylland, and we decided to find out more about their scouting and recruitment in the last period. Andrii Fedchenkov found Lars Hallengreen and talked to the man who was central in building up the successful scouting and recruitment department at Midtjylland the last two years.\n\nWhen you came to Midtjylland, the club already used statistical tools in scouting. What did surprise you the most?\n\nWell, I was not that surprised as I had knowledge of models before I came, but they use models for each position to be able to get a first impression of a player.\n\nCould you describe the scouting process in Midtjylland step by step?\n\nScanning: This step starts with having a scouting profile with the qualities the club is looking for. For instance, if Midtjylland needs a forward, he should be a big player, physically strong and so on. After that, you start scanning the market. You can use the data pretty well during this phase. Firstly, you can have about 3,000 players, and relying on the statistical data you come to some 50 or so candidates. Midtjylland gets around ten players offered each day. So that makes 3,000 offered players per year. You don’t want to look at all of them on video. Scouting: Then down to 50 candidates, it starts what I call scouting phase. It’s a combination of eyes and data. In this phase, you first look at those, who have best data. You have to find out if data is correct. Forming a scouting portfolio: You choose between ten and twelve candidates for further research. Researching phase: In this phase, you check the availability of the players, salary demands, possible transfer fees to be paid, and the career plans for the player according to his agent. Shortlisting: After the research you get down to four or five candidates, who you find realistic to recruit. These candidates are then fully researched, background checked, references etc. Quality assurance: The four or five candidates should then be quality assured, and they are then looked at by other scouts and the coaching staff. In this phase, the players are analysed down to the smallest detail, and with the style of play in mind. Recruitment: After this process, you are ready to recruit one or more of the players from your shortlist. Introduction programme: When he is recruited, it is important to have an introduction programme in the club, so the player can have a good start at the club. So many people are involved in this process and contribute to the success of a signing.\n\nOne of the main problems in scouting is how to compare and assess players from different leagues? I read that you use a system, which compares players from different leagues like they play in one league. Could you tell more about that?\n\nWell, you have the option to compare the players in Instat Scout, which is a video scouting tool that has a performance index. SmartOdds—the company of Midtjylland [and Brentford] owner Matthew Benham—has their model to compare leagues. Last winter, I had a forward from the Scottish league. I suggested him to Benham and Rasmus [Ankersen], but they said that Scottish league was not the best one compared to the Danish league. They were not sure, whether he could be successful in Denmark. They have the measurement of statistic. It is based on European matches and also UEFA ranking. Also, they follow the markets very closely; it could also be like a subjective feeling. If you are a bottom-of-the-league team from Scotland, could you play in the Danish league? That’s one of the questions to ask yourself. Of course, top-team players like Celtic players could be very successful here, but there is a big difference.\n\nThe second problem is technical. As I know, companies that provide advanced statistical data don’t usually count data on non-top leagues. How do you deal with it? Do you use SmartOdds system? What are its main advantages over Opta, for example?\n\nSmartOdds also uses Opta data. SmartOdds provides us with other data like expected goals. For the goalkeepers, you have the opposite— expected goals against them. You get specific data for each position. The most important thing about SmartOdds data is that they focus on how much the player contributes to the success. It could be data for assists or pre-assists, key passes into the area. If you look at wingers, you’ll get crosses and so on. The very important thing is that data is possession-adjusted. The players, whose team possesses the ball more often, have more chances to make an assist. For that reason, you have assists adjusted to ball possession, for instance. I think it’s possible to make your own data. You cannot have a standard for all clubs. You need to be aware how to interpret data. For each new player profile you need new data, because it’s a new situation all the time. When one player goes out, then you maybe need a different profile than before. In the scanning phase, it could be standard, but in the analysing phase you need a different approach.\n\nTalking about statistics, what stat is the most important for you, what is less important? For example, all fans assess strikers based on their goals, but some people look at shots from dangerous areas as a more valuable stat.\n\nDifferent positions have different kind of important data to look at. If you are looking for a striker you should look at expected goals, goals per 90 minutes, or goal conversion rates, successful aerial duels etc. But I think this is data you can use when you are in the first scanning phase or in the beginning of the scouting phase. You are always using your football eye to shortlist the best candidates which will fit into the club’s playing philosophy and you have to know what the coach is looking for in order to have the best preparation and the best conditions to find the best candidate.\n\nWhat about stats for defenders? Are interceptions, ball recovery statistics useful things?\n\nClearances, interceptions, total duels, aerial duels. If it’s about a central defender, key defensive decisions are also important. Many centre-backs just play the ball laterally, so it’s important to look how much they play forward and how successful they are. The length of the pass is also interesting at times. You should also pay attention to the player’s involvement in the game—whether he wants to have the ball or not. The number of passes—not only the successful ones, but their overall quantity—can show this, too. One more thing you should look at is the player’s preparation for different situations and how good he is at scanning. How good he is in orientating himself on the field. It works not only for defenders, but also for midfielders or strikers. That is exactly the thing, which data cannot show.\n\nOne more thing about data. Defenders, who play in teams with high pressing systems, are not involved in defensive actions so often as the defenders with low blocks. Therefore, they will not make a lot of interceptions, duels, clearances. However it doesn’t mean they’re bad.\n\nIt’s what I mean; you have to adjust it in every new situation. If you scout for a team with a high pressing system, you have to find players who are capable to play in this system. One thing you always need from a central defender in this system is his ability to go forward, to intercept the ball. Also he has to be very speedy. By the way, that is a thing I cannot see through data nowadays. I told Instat and Wyscout representatives: ‘Why don’t you make a speed index?’ Because it’s something every scout looks for. They told me: ‘Ok, it sounds fine.’ But they haven’t implemented it yet, but I think they are working on it.\n\nIn terms of player intelligence, off-the-ball movements are sometimes more important than the actions with the ball. But stats don’t show it. Do you think it will be possible to evaluate a player performance without the ball in the future?\n\nWell, it is possible to get supportive data also for the performance off-the-ball, but it is a little bit more difficult to figure out. Some systems offer data for pressing, and you can calculate offensive involvement and defensive involvement and thereby get data on the total activity of the player. I call it an involvement index or a Dynamo Index. But, yes, in the future we may have the system which will check out the right player’s positions in any given situation and then track players performance according to this. A positional performance index? Something like this. Game intelligence is something that today is still up to a scout to evaluate.\n\nWhat does the player intelligence mean to you? Movements off-the-ball, what else?\n\nIt’s the way a player positions himself and the choices he makes both with and without the ball. It’s also the question whether he foresees situations before others. You know Wayne Gretzky, one of the best ice-hockey players in the world. I saw him playing against the Russian team. He was fighting for a long pass with an opponent, and he was occupied with looking for the puck, but when he reached the puck, he just swayed it backwards into space, where one of his team-mates came and had free space to make a decisive goal. That’s what I mean, when a player can interpret the game with foresight, look into the future, see what others can’t see. The same is true in football. The same in football. Five years ago, I worked as Head of Academy in FC Nordsjælland, I was watching a youth match in a small club in Denmark, scouting a 12-year-old player called Mikkel. Watching his game, you understand what game intelligence is. He played a fantastic game. He is now 17 and plays for the first team, having been just five years at the club. He can see things 25-year-olds cannot see. Besides, he is also technically gifted. He can make a lot of good small unexpected decisions and get past two or three opponents. It also applies to central defenders, who can be very good at reading the situation or positioning themselves. When there’s a 1vs2 situation it comes down to how he can defend and help the goalkeeper the best way. Game intelligence is decision making. However, being a scout, you have to be aware of what the coach thinks game intelligence is. You can think that it’s game intelligence, but if the coach has a different opinion, then it doesn’t make much sense.\n\nThere is a famous story how Midtjylland signed defensive midfielder Tim Sparv. The club’s chairman Rasmus Ankersen said that there were no stats, that assessed him highly, but Midtjylland liked his positional play. How did you measure it?\n\nActually, I was not at the club when Sparv was signed, but I know that he was based on data rated as the most important player of 2. Bundesliga side Greuther Fürth, a club playing at that time in the 2. Bundesliga, a league ranked higher than the Danish Superliga. So this was an important thing. The other big thing with Tim was his personality. He’s fantastic. I’ve rarely met a personality like Tim Sparv. He is so professional; he’s great in the dressing room, always mentoring the young players, even young talents at the academy. I think he’s a person who can work for the club after his career is over. By the way, it was the situation I told before. When Sparv came, Midtjylland played a 4-1-4-1, and Tim was scouted as the one in front of the back four. He was quite perfect for that position. He fitted very well in the team and had a lot of good matches. Now Midtjylland are playing 3-4-3, so now he has to play alongside Poulsen as a No. 8. Now they have big success playing with this system, and Tim has to change his style according to this. Luckily enough, he is a very smart player as well.\n\nWhen you make the decision whether to sign a player, how much do you rely on stats and how much on visual impression?\n\nFor me it’s like 30 per cent to 70 per cent. The personality and the background of a player and his behavior count a lot also. And the clubs has the opportunity to talk to the player before signing him too.\n\nCan you explain your perfect transfer in terms of statistics? Could you provide an example?\n\nIt is always interesting for Danish Clubs to look at Scandinavian players playing outside Scandinavia. They are sold for one million Euro or more to Eredivisie, Jupiler League or even the Bundesliga. They are not getting minutes and want to get out of their contracts. This was the case with Alexander Sørloth. Midtjylland bought him from Groningen in May 2017 for 400,000 Euro, and he was a big success in the Danish Superliga. Crowned as the best player, he was sold for a record bid for a Superliga player to Crystal Palace. The price could be between 12 and 16 million Euro depending on bonuses.\n\nOne of the main principles of Moneyball is to sign players with bad reputations and injury history because they are less expensive. But I read that in Midtjylland you have a different opinion.\n\nActually, these two types of players represent potentially very good value for money, if you know how to asses them better than the market. So having special knowledge of scanning the players in the medical check could be a big advantage. These players are often undervalued because of their injury history. Same with bad reputation. If you spend more time on research of a player’s background, you could have a different conclusion about his personality. But, yes, at Midtjylland, there is a lot of research on these types of players. Sometimes, Midtjylland can pick a player with an injury history but other times they will not. Bad reputation is not the best start, and Midtjylland has a very strong culture with a very good training culture, so this is important to protect us. Thus, bad attitudes are not accepted.\n\n***\n\nIt is somewhat clear how to scout players for the first team, but how do you do it at the youth level? What’s the most important aspect, what are you looking at?\n\nYou’re right. You could scout senior teams by video combining with going to the stadium. Now we have video footage of U17 and U19 leagues in Denmark. But when you go further down, it gets more difficult. In my time at Nordsjælland, I often had to scout 11- to 15-year-old players. I think you have to be aware of the club’s DNA. I’ve made talent profiles to understand what is important for each position at Nordsjælland. You need to have a head coach and a technical director and the other people in the club, who can help you make the talent profile. It’s important for everybody to agree, ‘yes, that’s what we are looking for’. It’s not just my opinion, it’s the club’s opinion. What is the DNA of Nordsjælland and what do we want to have in the future? We have to look where the game is heading and how we want to develop the players. It’s not an easy discussion; it’s a very complex one. Bringing in a 12-year-old player, you have to work with him for maybe seven or eight years. You have to look at least five to six years ahead, before he makes his debut for the first team. If you’ve been longer with the club, it’s easier for you to make this work. I could give you some examples of what is important. Of course, it is speed. Game intelligence is probably the most important one. And also the ability to learn. When a player comes to the club at 12, then he will be training 800 hours each year. So he gets about 5000 hours of training before he becomes a first team player. Of course, it’s very important to have good coaches, because then a player learns more easily.\n\nWhen you’re watching a game of 12-year-olds, how can you see that this boy or another is able to learn?\n\nI have my own methods. It’s difficult to see in the game, it is easier to see in training. When we talk about 12-year-olds, you could also have the opportunity to see him in a tryout, not just in matches. I made a model to observe them in training to identify their ability to learn. I can give you one example: Are you familiar with model of growth mindset? You have different kinds of players. For instance, the coach is going to make a new drill. Then some players will stand in front of the line and say: ‘Ok, a new drill’s coming; I’m so excited, I want to learn new things.’ Some players stand behind the queue, saying: ‘This is the new drill, I don’t want to look stupid in front of the coach, and I’ll first see how the others do it. The coach thinks I’m a good player, so let him keep that impression.’ It’s a different kind of mindset. The first in line thinks that he can learn on his mistakes and therefore become a better player. And the other thinks that he doesn’t want to make mistakes. You cannot judge on just one observation, that’s something you have to see a few times. But even in the match I have some observations I make to evaluate a player in this important matter.\n\nI think it’s one of the most complicated things to assess the psychology of a player. For example, how could you know that a player is a bad influence in the dressing room?\n\nSometimes we use our network to talk to former coaches and team-mates. Also fan forums can be used as support to gather information.\n\nImagine the situation: You liked a player, watching him on video. However, when you watch him in the stadium, he is sent off after controversy with the referee. What will you do?\n\nIt depends on the situation, but if we have been following a player for six months, and we have always checked his personality before, we send out scouts to stadiums, then we already know a lot about the player. But of course, a bad reaction can influence our opinion, especially if there is another candidate on the same level.\n\nAnother example: The player is substituted. He reacts aggressively, throws water bottles and so on. On the one hand, the player is too aggressive. But on the other hand, he has passion and desire, which is also good and which not every player has.\n\nThe players should always have respect for the coaches and the other players. So it is not a good sign and could be a big question mark for us. But on the other hand you could decide that you have the need for a special player, who you decide to work with on his mental aspects.\n\nDo you use some tests to identify the psychological type of player? Maybe at the academy?\n\nYes, Midtjylland is using personality tests both in the first team and at the academy. In this way you understand your team-mates better and can work together very well.\n\nNBA franchises have an interview with the player before signing. Do you use something like that? What do you ask him? Do you ask him common questions like ‘Who are you going to be in five years?’?\n\nYou are normally only having informal talks with the player and coaches usually also have a talk with a player before signing. But I have suggested to Midtjylland that they use these personality tests before signing a player. Only to support an important and financially big decision.\n\nHas it ever happened that you decided to not sign a player after such a talk?\n\nNo. But it happened when we had a few candidates for one place, and after the interview we chose one of them. Before the interview, we already have a pretty good impression of the personality and behavior of the player. Of course, the interview can cause different impression. I remember our sporting director used to say: ‘This player is not confident enough for being a forward’ or ‘I doubt that this guy will make 25 goals in Danish Superleague, he is not confident enough.’\n\nWhat should he say to make you sure he’s not confident?\n\nSometimes you see it just when the person enters the room. It’s a special kind of personality. You want a striker who is like ‘I’m the king! Or at least I´m the Prince!’ I had an interview with a player at Nordsjælland. He was the most wanted player of his age group in Denmark, being obviously one of the best. He came to the club when he was 15. We had the interview with him and his family. The sporting director asked him: ‘What are your interests when you’re not playing football?’ He said: ‘Women.’ Then the director asked: ‘Which footballer do you look the most up to?’ He thought a little bit and said: ‘Nicklas Bendtner.’ You know, Nicklas Bendtner to all of us in Denmark is famous for visiting night clubs and having problems with discipline. Surely, we realised that these two answers were not normal for a Nordsjælland guy. But he was a very good player and, of course, we signed him anyway. Today he’s playing for the U19 national team. He is extremely confident. There was another situation in the team’s restaurant after the training. All first team players were sitting down eating. He was new at the club on a tryout. Of course, we have asked him to come. He came to the cafe, saw the sporting director, came to him and laid the hands on his shoulder and said: ‘Heeey, what’s up?’ All first team players were like ‘Who is this?!’ And it’s what I mean with a forward. This kind of personality which is very rare to see, especially if we speak about young players. But I think, this guy is going to be a very good player, he has already made his first-team debut.\n\n***\n\nI know, that you have partner club in Africa. Could you please tell more about it?\n\nMidtjylland work with Ebeidei, a Nigerian academy, and the club usually signs one or two players from each age group when they are 18 years old. They are assessed throughout their visits to Denmark or when the club visits Nigeria. Having worked with the same academy since 2004, there is a very good understanding between the two academies of which players could be successful at Midtjylland.\n\nIt’s a common problem involving the age of African players. How do you deal with it? Do you have the technology to identify the real age of player?\n\nMidtjylland have had no problems with age, as the players come to the Nigerian academy at a very young age, and the club has all the data from the start. No technical solution but a lot of practical sense about this. Midtjylland have sent back other African players from other countries because of this.\n\nReally?\n\nWhen they are coming for a tryout to Midtjylland, one of the things the club is looking out for, is whether they are too old or seem too old. When you have to look at their potential, of course, it’s important to know their age. Let’s say, they have a 16-year-old player from Ghana for a tryout. It’s very important to know if he is really 16 or 18. Surely, he can be a very good player anyway. However, Midtjylland evaluate them on the experience they have had from these countries. I know from the Danish embassy in Ghana, that there are a lot of cases when the documents are not correct.\n\nSo, to have such a partner club as Midtjylland have in Nigeria is the best option?\n\nExactly. If you have a close cooperation with the club, you have much more info. Sometimes players come to the club at six or nine, and you have correct papers.\n\nWhat is the weirdest story from your experience about African players?\n\nSome agents are making strange decisions on behalf of their players. When you are working with a new agent or an agent you don’t know very well, you can have something like this: One time Midtjylland had an African player who played a tryout match for them. We were very satisfied with him, and the next day we were to have a meeting with him and his agent. But suddenly he was gone. The agent had brought him to another club, a German club, and they signed him to a contract.\n\n***\n\nMidtjylland has coaches for shots and set-pieces. Do they have some other specialised coaches?\n\nThrow-in coaches, as the throw-in is a very important weapon. Midtjylland always has a player in a team who is able to throw the ball into the area. Also a lot of individual coaches. At the academy, they have three morning trainings—on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Many of these trainings are individual-focused. You could have a physical coach, making some individual work with you, coordination coach, finishing coach, tactical coach, kicking coach.\n\nAre you completely satisfied with the result?\n\nIf you look at Paul Onuachu, for instance, he has developed a lot. Paul was highly valued in expected goals, but he didn’t score so many goals. He could have scored more. So, he had been trained in the finishing part a lot, especially in terms of heading. He worked a lot on balancing and timing of his runs. And in the last year, he has been very successful. It’s the example how it could be useful.\n\nСould the situation happen that FC Copenhagen or a rich club from abroad comes and takes your talent?\n\nNo, I can’t imagine that any other club in Denmark can take a talent from Midtjylland, not even FC Copenhagen. Midtjylland just sold Rasmus Nissen Kristensen to Ajax for 5.5 million Euro. He was born in 1997 and already had more than 50 first-team matches. So, this is the way Midtjylland does things. But of course, you can’t always control agents and players. The young players have a big role at Midtjylland, and the first team is a very good platform to jump from to Europe.\n\nTell me more about the work of the Midtjylland academy? Why is it different from other academies?\n\nThe Midtjylland academy is like a big family, and there are very good people, always thinking about how to develop the young players as both personalities and players. And they are very committed to this. They put a lot of resources into the academy, and have very experienced coaches. They also can recruit players from all over the world as the players can stay at the academy and have guest families. The school system is also well-integrated into the player’s football activities. I think the most important thing for their success is that the owner, the board and the management all have the academy as their highest priority. It is an important part of their strategy.\n\n***\n\nWhen you’re scouting a player, do you think about whether he fits in the team in terms of chemistry? Do you take into account, what friends he can have in the team?\n\nYes, you always ask yourself how a player can be integrated in the best way possible. Let’s take Artem Dovbyk for example: Midtjylland has Erik Sviatchenko in the team. His father is Sergei Sviatchenko, a well-known artist from Kharkov. They have been in Denmark since 1990. So, Erik can speak Ukrainian, and him and his family take care of Artem.\n\nAs I understand, Midtjylland decided to sign Dovbyk after selling Sørloth. It was like a trigger, right?\n\nNo doubt. Artem has fantastic physical potential. He resembles Sørloth a lot in his physical performance. Of course, there could be some insecurity about game intelligence and so on, but in many-many ways he is much like Sørloth. Despite having a big body, he is well-coordinated. That’s one of the things I saw in Sørloth as well. I found out why. When he was 13 or 14, he was one of the best skaters in Europe. If you have seen speed skating, they are physically impressive and coordinated. Because it’s not easy, you have to be almost like a dancer, to move your feet and body. It demands a lot of coordination. He chose football, but now he could have been in the Olympics, if he didn’t. Dovbyk is one of the players I look forward to following at Midtjylland, because I think he has a ton of potential. Of course, the important thing was that Sørloth was speaking almost the same language as most of the players. But what Midtjylland do right now from the start is they ask Erick Sviatchenko to help Artem with the language barrier. Also they are intensively teaching Artem Danish and English.\n\nWhen did you see him for the first time?\n\nIt was half a year ago. I saw him on video. One of the agents offered him. Normally Midtjylland wouldn’t choose an Ukrainian players. I get Ukrainians offered very often, but for some positions it’s not very easy to take Ukrainian players. I saw good Ukrainian central defenders, but that is not the best position to have a foreign player, who does not completely understand the details of the defensive tactics. That would be a risk. So if they speak English, it is not an issue. Of course, they could have one at the back, but you primarily want to have Scandinavian players. But you can take an attacking player from Ukraine, as communication on the pitch is not so important for these positions. Half a year ago, I included him into my shortlist of young forwards. We knew that at one point we would like to have a young forward as the third option.\n\nHe was playing in Ukraine’s third division for the last six months. Does it bother you?\n\nNo, because we also knew that earlier he played in the Ukrainian Premier Liga at a young age. I think he showed that he is a far better player than the others in the league. He scored a lot of goals, it was an unreal performance. Also, I think sometimes if you have a young player at a lower level, you can see his skills more clearly. When he gets the space for a run, you can really see his speed and coordination. In the first division, players sometimes don’t get space and have to act more carefully.\n\nYoung Ukrainian players don’t have a good reputation in Europe. They don’t like to learn languages, they have discipline issues. Did you check Dovbyk’s background?\n\nI have looked carefully at other Ukrainian players—Zinchenko and Luchkevich. I heard about these two guys, that they are football-focused. Maybe, it is the influence of the family, I don’t know. I guess young players, whose fathers also played, are well-educated. I don’t know actually, whether Dovbyk’s father was a player. But I’m impressed by his dedication. Other things coaches can teach him. It seems he takes care of his body and is rarely injured. Moreover, when he went down to the third division, he continued being a professional and developing. We know that he wanted to go to another country. It’s also the sign that you are ambitious, you don’t want to stay in Ukraine with your family.\n\nHow much time do you give young players for their adaptation?\n\nYou know especially with a player like Artem, with the language barrier, it could take up to a year to adapt. Midtjylland is very patient club in that way. They know a lot about integration. Moreover, there are people in the club who worked in integration professionally. Everybody does what he can to make this process as good as possible. Midtjylland is not like a Bundesliga club or big club in the Netherlands; they have to do things a different way, and they focus a lot on integrating players. Not that bigger clubs don´t do that, but in Midtjylland it is very important.\n\nWhat can Midtjylland offer him to adapt, except of communicating with Sviatchenko and hiring a language teacher?\n\nThere is a person responsible for his integration, renting an apartment, transportation, car, everything. They are preparing him for life in Denmark. At the training ground, there are a lot of activities outside the pitch. They arrive at 9am, eat together, than they train, than eat together again. Some of them are staying at the club playing some games. There are also some social activities. It’s not just coming to the training and leaving. The young guys in the team can get him to be together and so on. There is more than one person responsible for his social well-being.\n\nCan you name the best unobvious Ukrainian young players right now, excluding Dovbyk and Zinchenko?\n\nI don’t look that much at Ukrainian players. That is not a market I naturally follow. I get players offered. There is a player, his name is Rusin, at Dynamo. Lunyov playing for Zorya. And also a player with the name Mytsyk at Stal, he’s a right or central defender. Of course, the goalkeeper Lunin at Zorya. If players are 18 or 19 years old, and they have already made their debut for the first team, they could be interesting for Midtjylland, and the club could follow them.\n\nIf Artem Dovbyk performs for Midtjylland successfully, is it possible that you will look more attentively at the Ukrainian market?\n\nOf course, it’s an interesting new market for me to follow.\n\n***\n\nHow did you become a football manager and then a scout?\n\nI was a banker earlier in life. I worked with trading and analysing as a stock broker. It was my job for 20 years. Then I wanted to change my business life, I’d liked to work in football. I think that it has been very much fun and a very good learning process. I started at Nordsjælland, and I was working for free there for almost two years to get into the club. I knew some good people there, among them was Flemming Petersen, who was the liaison person between the youth department and the first team then, and today he is the technical director at Nordsjælland. I was put into the third team as a head coach. I got a position as the head coach of the U13 team. I coached that team while getting my A license in coaching. Later, I started a project of an academy for Nordsjælland. They liked the idea and allowed me to work with that for the next years. I was in Nordsjælland for six years working with talent development and recruitment of players. There are a lot of players in the first team, who were at the academy when I was there. That is the beauty of Nordsjælland. If you get a player in as a youth scout, when he is 12, you could actually see him on the first team level five or six years later. When you are an academy director, that is exactly what you want to see. I remember I was on a visit at Shakhtar Donetsk. At that time the director of their academy was Dutch Patrick van Leuven. He was not happy. He had been there for seven years, and only one of his players had come into the first team. The head coach always bought Brazilians. Look at the Nordsjælland, their ambition is to have a full squad of former academy players. Interesting and inspiring, I think.\n\nWhat is the key of their success? Is it the level of coaching, scouting? When you are a Nordsjælland scout, you can work in a tiny area, can’t you?\n\nThe scouting and recruitment of 11- to 13-year-old boys is quite good, and at the same time many players and families want to be a part of the FC Nordsjælland Academy. So many talented young players apply on their own. And yes, many resources are put into the academy—good facilities and good coaches. Also, there is a good learning environment. All the people in the club help and support talent development. As a scout for Nordsjælland, you have to be very focused on the academy, but it could be that the club chooses to take in younger players from other countries. They took in Lobotka from Trenčín in Slovakia and now also Bartolec from Zagreb.\n\nCould you tell about main principles of a successful academy as you see it?\n\nThe answer is mostly explained in this slide from a presentation. It is a longer talk I think—maybe in another interview. But these are points I recommend to take into account.\n\nIt seems that in Denmark there is an interesting competition of unusual ideas of how football works. We have Midtjylland, Nordsjælland.\n\nI think these two clubs are the ones which are the most unusual clubs. FC Copenhagen has the best economy and does very good in Europe normally, and Brøndby has a large fan base. They also invest quite good money in their academies, but you rarely see a player breaking into their first team.\n\nBasel’s scout Rudi Zbinden said that he once spent 150 days of the year on the plane. How about you? Do you travel a lot?\n\nNo. I have been offered jobs at Premier League clubs as a scout with the responsibility to travel a lot. I think that I’m more like a technical scout preferably looking at data and video. That is the way I can do best. Of course, I like to come to matches around Europe a lot, but I think you do that when a lot of the job has been done before. Because I think that just going and scouting and not making much before that is a waste of time. You need to do a lot of preparation. I do a lot of preparation with video and data. Midtjylland actually has a scout who works at the stadiums. Sometimes they also have a network of scouts, which are not their scouts, but those who they collaborate with. Due to the Brentford and SmartOdds network they could have informers all over the world.\n\nEvery player dreams to win the UEFA Champions League or the World Cup. What about you? What do you need to do to say “My career was successful”?\n\nFor now I am a partner at Eye4Talent which has an interesting and useful platform used for scouting, player development and to run an academy. Of course, success for me could also mean to be the head of scouting and recruitment at a big club, to be a sporting director at a Danish club or abroad. Because working as a sport director, you have a say in strategy, in the academy. But also maybe being an academy director again, because it is very interesting to work with talent development. It’s important to me to have a say in decisions. About strategy, about which player to choose. It’s important that my work can be seen as productive. Like Sørloth, he was a big success. When you experience that, you think that you are successful.\n\nIs he the most successful of all your deals?\n\nYes. He was brought in from Groningen for 400,000 Euro last summer and sold a few weeks ago for around 12 million. In Denmark, it is considered to be the best deal ever. Of course, I only scouted and recruited him. But the coaches chose to have him on the team and develop him, and Rasmus, Claus and the management sold him. So it’s a team effort. But I like to be a part of a team and make a difference that way.\n\nWhat advice can you give to people who would like to become scouts?\n\nWatch a lot of football. It starts with becoming aware of the game and learning the game. I don’t know how many matches I have seen in my life, but it’s been a lot. It’s about understanding of what kind of skills are needed to get to the European top-level. And to be able to look into the future. It’s important to get into a good club, where you can learn. You can connect with the coaches and maybe with experienced scouts you can learn from. Perfect, if you can get a mentor at a club. You can go and say: ‘I would like to work for free. Can I help you, can I assist you? I just want to learn from you.’ I think you have to give something to get something. I had to work for free for two years.\n\nHow much video do you watch every day?\n\nWell it depends, but now it’s around three hours a day, but in some months of the year it could be six hours.\n\nHow do you see the future of football scouting? Do you think the process of scouting and player recruitment will change a lot in the next 10 or 15 years?\n\nI think the concept of machine learning could be interesting when we talk about the systems including supportive data. You could see a situation, and the coach will say: ‘In this situation I will make this decision.’ When then looking at the game you will be able to choose the player who makes these decisions. I’m not sure how it will be done, but I think that machine learning could be useful in the future, to get more insight and an overview about decisions and the level of game intelligence. Otherwise, I think a lot of emphasis will be on the mental side to be able to tell more about personalities and background. The kind of intelligence we would like to have in the future.\n\nThe interview was first published on ua.tribuna.com\n\nAs has often been discussed across Spielverlagerung, the flanks generally offer lesser strategic value for the in-possession team. A ball-carrier by the touchline only has 180 degrees of movement and limited access to space across the pitch. Therefore, defensive strategies commonly look to show the opponent towards the outside and into a pressing trap.\n\nA common solution against such pressing schemes has been to drop a midfielder in the first line to create a back three while the full-backs move into high and wide positions. Through having a third player in the first line, the line moves slightly wider and it becomes more difficult for the opponent to apply pressure wide. The weakness of this structure is that it can lead to a lesser presence in the second line and thus central build-up can be difficult. Even if the build-up is able to outplay the opponent’s first line of pressure, the options to play forwards and through the defensive block can be insufficient.\n\nAnother solution then, is to build-up with a deep full-back. Compared to the previous solution, having deeper full-backs means that midfielders can stay in the second line and offer themselves as options to break the opponent’s first line of pressure. Further up the field, this means that the wingers typically have to stay wider and this can potentially lead to a lower occupation of space behind the opposition midfield line. Although through effective spacing within the structure, this disadvantage can be reduced.\n\nParticularly against narrow pressing structures, the use of deep full-backs can be an effective means of reducing oppositional pressure by increasing the distance required to shift, as well as reducing oppositional cover through the same means. However, the strategic weaknesses still remain and thus it is imperative that in-possession teams do not keep the ball there too long before the opponent can shift across to close out the space. The ball must either be circulated back inside through the centre-back or deep midfielder, or progressed forwards – either diagonally inside or down the line.\n\nThis analysis will discuss how a build-up structure with a deep full-back can be effective against high and midfield presses in reducing oppositional pressure or cover. For some teams, the full-back moves deeper situationally, in reaction to bad build-up play to simply provide the centre-back with an easy passing option. Detailed in the following article will be how the position can be used proactively as part of an in-possession system.\n\nStructural Interaction against Opposition Press\n\nThe first section will address the structural implications of the deeper full-back in interaction with an oppositional press depending on the pressing structure of the opposition.\n\nIf Opposition Press with Narrow front line (example: winger to centre-back)\n\nThe deeper positioning of the full-back in build-up can be effective to either reduce oppositional pressure or cover against narrow pressing structures. The example discussed in this section will be the common scheme of winger pressing to centre-back, as done by Liverpool.\n\nIf the defence presses with a narrow front line, then space is available wider. Through a deeper position, the full-back can then be an option to play directly into, skipping the centre-back who would be pressed by the winger. But moving past the obvious, we can look at the impact of the deep full-back on other players within the build-up structure.\n\nWhen a winger presses the centre-back in this scheme, they have the intention of keeping the full-back in their cover shadow to stop that passing option, so the winger presses from outside to in. If the full-back is deeper, then the winger must normally press from a wider position and with a bigger arch in his pressing movement if he wants to still cut-off the pass to the full-back. This is of course a longer route to the centre-back and due to the curved trajectory, the run cannot be made at as high of a speed than a straighter-line press.\n\nThis longer pressing line consequently gives the centre-back more time on the ball before being pressed, this of course gives them greater time to assess their options but also gives their teammates more time to find positions to offer as a passing option, including the full-back themselves.\n\nBecause the pressure also comes from a wider position, it also offers the possibility for the centre-back to play centrally. This can come in two main forms.\n\nFirstly, the centre-back can step-in with the ball since the space is directly in front of him. Dribbling centrally can be a useful way of creating space by provoking pressure, allowing the centre-back to progress with a longer pass into space further upfield. Also, simply from carrying the ball into a more central position, it means the centre-back can more easily access ball-far spaces, such as making a switch in the example below from Brighton vs Manchester City.\n\nAside from a dribble, forcing the winger to press from a wider position widens the lane between him and his nearest central midfielder, reducing their coverage of this passing lane. This lane could be occupied by a more advanced central midfielder to create an option to play through the press. From this position, a follow-up action could then be back to the full-back advancing on the blind-side of the pressing winger, or to turn forwards and carry if there is space.\n\nIf the full-back receives in this position, it’s unlikely that the winger will be able to recover quickly enough to apply pressure. Therefore, it would be the responsibility of either the opposition central midfielder or full-back to step out and apply pressure. The full-back’s deeper positioning increases the distance for the opponents to step out and could make it too far for them to press at a high intensity. The larger space that they leave behind them as they step out to press could be exploited too. Because of these dilemmas, the majority of teams would sacrifice pressure on the ball and neither position would step out to press, allowing the full-back to carry the ball forwards.\n\nIf Opposition Press with Wide front line (example: winger to full-back)\n\nIf the opponent press with the winger directly on the full-back, then the deeper positioning is less beneficial. Compared to building up against a narrow pressing structure, the main difference is that the space isn’t immediately with the full-back. Therefore, the position firstly can’t act as an option away from pressure, and as the full-back could be immediately under the pressure, it becomes more difficult to play against the defender. With this now happening deeper within one’s own half, it can cause more problems than it solves.\n\nIn this interaction, the movement does not provide greater stability to the build-up. However, it can be used to provoke pressure and reduce oppositional coverage of spaces in midfield or down the outside, assuming the pinning from the front players is effective.\n\nThis can create better options for direct build-up from the centre-back, instead of playing into the full-back where he could be pressed. In almost every situation, it is more optimal to avoid playing to the full-back altogether, as they would likely be under high pressure upon receiving with limited options. From the centre-back, the deep positioning can create more direct build-up options, particularly if the winger anticipates the pass wide and steps out early. Through increasing the space inside, the team can increase the margin of error for playing and receiving longer passes, with greater space for follow-up actions (lay-offs, dribbles) to exploit the open structure.\n\nIn the example above, Chelsea’s right centre-back plays into Kanté in a similar structure, bypassing Southampton’s first line of pressure. Although Kanté receives with pressure from behind, he has so much space to his left and right that he is able to take a safe touch and dribble around his defender, without a big threat of losing the ball.\n\nOpposite Full-Back\n\nAs a smaller side-note, the deep positioning of the ball-far full-back can be another way of quickly diffusing pressure as an easy out-ball. The main issue here, however, is the distance of the pass to reach them. Because of this, it can be dangerous if the defenders are able to reach the full-back by the time they receive the ball. Therefore, it may not be very effective against wide defensive structures and relies to a large extent on pinning actions by other ball-far players to give the full-back time to receive the longer pass.\n\nCreating the Structure with an Asymmetrical Back Five\n\nThe majority of this analysis is focused on structures with a base back four, however Brighton under Graham Potter have created a similar build-up structure with a back five this season. Against Manchester City, for example, they moved their left wing-back Bernardo into a left wing position, while the left centre-back essentially became a deep full-back in possession. On the right, Montoya acted more as a typical full-back.\n\nEffect of New Goal-Kick Rules\n\nThe new goal-kick rules implemented largely at the beginning of this season have had a significant effect on teams’ build-up from their first third. Ultimately, through allowing players to receive from the goalkeeper inside the penalty area, the rule allows the in-possession team to a) reduce oppositional pressure by increasing the distance the defender must travel and b) immediately use the full extent of the first third, without the penalty box essentially becoming active after the first pass. To take advantage, it has been common that centre-backs receive in deeper and more inside positions than previously.\n\nOf course, this then has a knock-on impact on other players’ positioning within the structure, including the full-backs. Previously, as deep centre-backs had to be at least as wide as the penalty area, it would be rare that full-backs would drop as they would be occupying the same space. Instead, it was more often that they would stay roughly on the height between the first and second thirds of the pitch. Now, since the centre-backs can receive inside the box, the full-backs can move deeper into open space to remain playable through the angle and distance to their teammates.\n\nAbove is a goal-kick structure from Sassuolo. They very rarely play to the deep full-backs, unlike Napoli or Roma, but instead look to draw out the opposition midfield line along with the deep positioning of the pivots. The main intention of this is to maximise the space in front of the opponent back four to play more direct, flat passes into. The above is an example from an encounter against Napoli.\n\nAgainst a Midfield Press\n\nAs against a high press, using deep full-backs are an effective way of reducing oppositional cover or pressure against narrow defensive structures. The primary example within this section will be on a common formation match-up within the Premier League this season – a 4-3-3 against a 5-3-2 midfield press. Again, without a winger starting closer to the full-back to directly attack him, this position can be an effective way of reducing oppositional pressure. Then, if the opponent still attempts a press, not only will it typically be at a lower intensity but the greater distance to shift increases the possibility of spaces opening up inside to exploit.\n\nWith a deep full-back against a 5-3-2, there are two main possibilities which happen – either the ball-near central midfielder steps out or the wing-back moves up to press.\n\nIf Eight Steps Out\n\nIf it’s the responsibility of the central midfielder to step out, then the defensive midfield line is open to losing horizontal compactness, depending on how well the opponent shift across as a team. If the middle central midfielder does not shift across sufficiently, then it’s possible to play on the first midfielder’s blind-side. If he does shift sufficiently, then it could still be possible to play across into the centre as shown in the instance with Liverpool below.\n\nNaturally, it’s important to consider the follow-up actions for the player receiving inside. They are almost always going to be receiving while facing towards the touchline, but with forward momentum and in a good position to shield the ball from pressure from inside or on their back. Because they have a poor body position to see progressive options inside, the clearest penetrative pass they could likely make would be outside to the winger, either in-behind the d"
