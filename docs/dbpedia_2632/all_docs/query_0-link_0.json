        "text": "2014 Moments of the Year\n\nWith 2014 coming to an end, here's a look at my 2014 moments of the year.\n\nGame of the Year\n\n3/16/2014 vs Baltimore Blast\n\nStart here in the game.\n\nNot going with a Sporting KC game this year for the game of the year. Instead that honor goes to the Missouri Comets and the mini-game, game three against the Baltimore Blast that clinched the MISL championship for the Comets. The game took place immediately after Game 2, which the Comets had lost 19-4, and were thoroughly dominated by the defending champion Blast. The 15 minute mini game featured some good defense by both teams. The Blast took the lead 2-0 with just over six and a half minutes to play. The Comets equalized almost a minute later from a bicycle kick from Lucas Rodriguez.\n\nThe final five minutes became a hectic scramble of goals. First the Blast retook the lead with a goal at the back post. Then with just over a minute and a half left, and Vahid Assadpour on as the sixth attacker, the Comets found an equalizer as Stefan St. Louis knocked home a Rodriguez cross at the back post to tie the game at 4-4. Then with under a minute left, The Comets found a winner. A long ball up the field to Leo Gibson was touched into the path of Brian Harris who had made a run up the boards. Gibson's touch to Harris was perfect and the defender was able to fire the ball into the far corner to give the Comets the 6-4 lead. They were able to kill the last 54 seconds and claim their first (and last) MISL title.\n\nGoal of the Year\n\nGrhaam Zusi vs Chicago Fire 10/10/14\n\nWe didn't see a lot of this this year from Zusi. Running at defenders and shooting from distance, but we got it here. Collecting a pass from Kevin Ellis, Zusi fires from distance into the far corner to give KC a 1-0 lead over the Chicago Fire.\n\nAssist of the Year\n\nLauren Holiday vs Seattle Reign 8/31/14\n\nA fantastic play to secure a title, Lauren Holiday set up Amy Rodriguez in the NWSL final against the Seattle Reign. Receiving the ball, Holiday proceeded to turn and race towards goal. Over the course of that 25 yard run, Holiday was able to turn her two markers a number of times before getting into the box and laying off a nice ball to Rodriguez who made no mistake, firing home to give FCKC a 2-0.\n\nSingle Game Performance of the Year\n\nOriol Rosell vs Montreal Impact 5/10/14\n\nProbably Sporting KC's best game of the season, KC won 3-0 over the Impact, and really completely dominated them the entire game. And at the center of it all, was KC's Spanish midfielder, Rosell. Rosell didn't score any goals, in fact he only had 1 shot, which coincidently led to the team's first goal as Collen Warner kept the ball out of the goal with his hand. But it was his passing that did it. Behind Rosell, KC passed the Impact to death, completing 739 of their 803 passing attempts and holding possession for over 78% of the game, all of those are MLS records, with quite a bit of distance to second place. The 92% passing accuracy is the second highest in league history (all since Opta started tracking MLS stats in 2011). Rosell himself set records for passing attempts (166) and completed passes (160, 96.4% completion percentage) in a game. his 160 completed passes were only 13 less than the entire Montreal Impact had as a team on that day. A dominating performance by him even if it doesn't show in the stats.\n\nLow Point of the Year\n\n2-1 Loss to New York 9/6/2014\n\nThis moment is not for this loss itself, but for this loss and the three games before it as well. Over that stretch from August 23rd through September 6th, Sporting went 0-4, conceding 11 goals while scoring just 3. This stretch was what really saw KC fall from grace as the season really hit it's tailspin. The first two of those games, a 3-0 loss to DC and a 3-1 loss to Houston were both at Sporting Park and two of the worse performances the team has put in at the new stadium. The 3-0 loss to DC was the worst in team history at Sporting Park. KC then followed those two up by losing both games of a East Coast road trip, losing 3-1 in New England and then the 2-1 loss in New York. KC did come out a week after this and romp Chivas USA 4-0, but it ended up being false hope for the rest of the season.\n\nNon-Sporting KC, KC player moment of the year\n\n6/16/14 Graham Zusi vs Ghana\n\nAfter taking a 1-0 lead in the first minute, the US had been holding onto that lead for dear life against Ghana in their opening match of the 2014 World Cup. In the 82nd minute though Ghana equalized. It was only four minutes later though when the US reestablished their lead. Zusi, a substitute for Alejandro Bedoya, played a corner in to substitute, John Brooks (who'd come on at half time for Matt Besler). Brooks powered his header into the net giving the US a 2-1 lead and eventual win over the team that had knocked them out of the prior two World Cups.\n\nKC Soccer Player of the Year\n\nBrian Harris\n\nThe MISL finals MVP last year in the Comets victory over the Baltimore Blast, Harris has continued his superb form in the 2014-2015 season in the MASL. As the Comets have started the season 9-0, Harris has chipped in 15 goals and 6 assists for 21 points on the season. Many of those coming from big runs forward and blasts from long range.\n\nSporting KC Player of the Year\n\nDom Dwyer\n\nSetting the single season scoring record for the club is definitely a big deal, KC has never been a club that's been known to have one dedicated goal scorer. They haven't been a club that has scored a lot of goals really since the Ron Newman days. But Dwyer had a season that many won't forget soon. At the half way point of the year I was ready to give the award to Benny Feilhaber, but the second half of the season, with Oriol Rosell gone, Feilhaber was forced to drop deeper in the field to help distribute, and his contribution to the team fell from there.\n\nFCKC Player of the Year\n\nAmy Rodriguez\n\nI'd said in my wishes for 2014 that I wanted Rodriguez to become the goal scorer the Blues needed to take the pressure off of Lauren Holiday, and she certainly did that, finishing second in the league in goals with 13. Rodriguez played herself back onto the national team after missing the 2013 season after giving birth. Now if only Jill Ellis would get her on the field more.\n\nComets Win Wild Game in Milwaukee\n\nThe Missouri Comets made it to the new year with their undefeated record in tact, but it certainly wasn't easy, playing in Milwaukee with only 12 players due to injuries, and in the end it took the Comets going to their first shootout of the season, but the Comets won 7-7 (2-1) over the Wave to go to 10-0 on the season.\n\nThe Wave grabbed the lead after breaking the Comets pressure, with Tony Walls redirecting a shot past Danny Waltman and into the net to make it 1-0. The Comets were able to respond in the last five minutes of the half, as Leo Gibson finished off a pass from Alain Matingou to level the game at 1-1. Before the end of the quarter the Comets were able to grab the lead with Vahid Assadpour finishing off an opportunity from Bryan Perez. Unfortunately for the Comets, Milwaukee equalized in the final minute of the quarter with Marcio Leite finishing off the chance.\n\nThe second quarter saw the Comets take over control of the game. Just over half way into the quarter, the Comets were able to retake the lead on the power play. Bryan Perez scored the goal off an assist from Gibson. The Comets pressure continued, but Nick Vorberg came up with some good saves to keep the Wave in the game. In the final minute of the quarter though Matingou beat Vorberg to a loose ball in the box and knocked it home to make it 4-2 as the two teams headed into the half time break.\n\nThe third quarter saw the Comets take another injury blow. Already without Max Touloute and Ramone Palmer due to injuries, Coady Andrews picked up an ankle injury early in the quarter and finished the game on the sidelines. The Comets though continued to press and just over half way through the quarter the Comets extended their lead to three. While it should go down as an own goal as Victor Quiroz headed the ball into his own net, the goal officially went to Perez for his second of the night as the Comets made it 5-2. Late in the quarter the Comets extended the lead to 6-2 as Brian Harris fired a shot home from long range.\n\nThe fourth quarter saw the Wave come storming back into the game. Just under three minutes in, the Wave cut the lead to 6-3 as Luan Sales Oliveira scored. The Wave continued to press the game, looking to cut the lead further. Before the half way mark, they'd cut the lead to one with two goals less than 30 seconds apart. Less than eight minutes in, JC Banks scored to make it 6-4, then 30 seconds later, Ian Bennet scored to make it 6-5. With less than five and a half minutes left, Banks scored again to tie the game at 6-6 completing the Wave's comeback. The Comets though stopped the Wave's run with three and a half minutes left as Perez finished off his hattrick scoring off of a free kick to put the Comets ahead 7-6. Very late in the game, things got extremely crazy. First with just under two minutes left, the Wave brought on their sixth attacker. Then with just five seconds left, Matingout went to the box with a blue card for four fouls. The Wave took the restart and eventually the ball made it to Oliveira who scored with less than a second left. At the time the Comets were livid because the clock did not start running when the free kick was taken. If the clock had started on time the game likely would have been over before the goal was scored. In frustration over the call, head coach, Vlatko Andonovski pulled his team off the field as the game was over.\n\nEventually the Comets came back out onto the field, although Andonovski was sent off by the referees. Overtime started with the Wave on the power play, but the Comets were able to kill the play off. Through the rest of the overtime both teams had chances, but the Comets had the better of them. Unable to capitalize on them though the Wave almost found a winner late on. With Waltman out of position, the Wave had an open net, but the shot was knocked off the line by John Sosa with his hand, channeling Luis Suarez in the 2010 World Cup. This led to a shootout attempt for the Wave, but Oliveira had his attempt stopped by Waltman and time in overtime expired.\n\nThe game went to a shootout with each team alternating shots. Gibson and Bennett both had their first attempts saved by Waltman and Vorberg. With the second attempt, Perez had his attempt saved while Leite tried to round Waltman, but went too far wide to get his effort on goal. Up third for the Comets was Assadpour. Up third for Wave was Oliveira who fired quickly, beating Waltman to tie the score and send the shootout to sudden death. Per the rules, Gibson stepped up to take the attempt again. This time Gibson buried his attempt past Forberg. For the Wave Oliveira stepped up again, but Waltman came up with a big save to give the Comets the win. The Comets got off the field as quickly as possible in a smash and grab, getting out of Milwaukee with the win.\n\nEspinoza to Leave Wigan, Return to US\n\nWord out of the United Kingdom today is that Wigan Athletic midfielder, Roger Espinoza will be leaving the club and returning to the United States. Espinoza's return to the US would give all the indications that he will be re-signing with Sporting KC since Sporting still hold his MLS rights.\n\nThere had been rumors of Espinoza's return to KC since October, but at the time, Sporting head coach, Peter Vermes said that he would not be willing to pay a transfer fee for the Honduran. The reason for this had to do with the fact that Espinoza would be out of contract at the English club anyway. The release though would allow him to return to KC on a free transfer.\n\nSo far, none of the reports have explicitly said that he's returning to Sporting KC, but with Wigan head coach, Malky Mackay saying \"There is an agreement that the club have shaken hands with Roger on to allow him to go back to America,\" and Kansas City's prior interest in bringing him back, it'd be shocking if he returned to anywhere but Sporting.\n\nOver the course of five seasons with Sporting during his first stay with the club, Espinoza appeared in 113 league games, starting 93 of them, and appeared in 130 in all competitions scoring two goals. Since leaving for the Premier League after the 2012 season though, Espinoza has appeared just 57 times for the Latics across all competitions.\n\nHis return to Kansas City would be welcome in the midfield, where Espinoza could slot in back in his old box to box role that he really made his own over his last two seasons in KC. That could lead to KC's midfield being a bit more dynamic if the team plays Paulo Nagamura and Benny Feilhaber with him. With none of the three being defensive midfielders in the role of Oriol Rosell or Lawrence Olum, it could mean that any of the three could go forward into the attack, which could cause other match up issues.\n\nComets Win Back and Forth Game with San Diego\n\nIn arguably their most exciting game of the year, the Comets remained undefeated pulling out a 10-7 win over the San Diego Sockers at the Independence Events Center to move to 9-0. It was the Sockers though that came out with the more impressive start of the game. Just 14 seconds into the game San Diego was on top after Chiky Luna got the ball out wide and played it to the back post where Kraig Chiles tapped the ball home. After absorbing the early high pressure from the Sockers, the Comets started to keep San Diego pinned in their own end of the field. But that led to Sockers counters and five and a half minutes in, the Sockers doubled their lead. On a 3 on 2 counter, Matias Kruger fed the ball wide to Ney who beat Danny Waltman to make it 2-0 Sockers. With the 2 goal lead the Sockers seemed to lay back a bit, and the Comets made them pay. Off a restart in the corner, Vahid Assadpour laid the ball back to Brian Harris who fired the ball home to put the Comets within one goal. It was then the Comets turn to high pressure, keeping the Sockers pinned in their own end unable to clear. This led to a give away by goalkeeper, Chris Toth. He played the ball right to Bryan Perez who controlled the ball and laid it off to Leo Gibson who slotted the ball into the corner to make it 2-2. The Comets kept up the pressure and won another free kick at the top of the arc. And again the Comets scored off the restart. This time it was John Sosa playing the ball wide to Assadpour who turned and fired. Toth got a piece of it, but couldn't keep the ball out of the net as the Comets took their first lead of the game.\n\nThe second quarter continued the Comets run as under two minutes in it was a 4-2 lead as Alain Matingou scored off an assist by Assadpour. The Comets kept up the pressure, but it wasn't until just under nine minutes in that they were to add to their lead as Assadpour picked up his second of the game at the back post after a Matingou run on the opposite side of the field. Late in the quarter though the Sockers started their own run again. First Chiles picked up his second of the game, finishing off a ball from Ney to make it 5-3. Then with just over 3 minutes left, Nick Perera scored to make it 5-4 as the teams headed into half time.\n\nThe Sockers continued their run in the start of the third quarter as well. Just over two minutes in, the Sockers struck on the beak as Eduardo Velez fed Ney on the break leading to the goal to tie the game at 5-5. The Sockers kept up the pressure as the third quarter went on and took a deserved lead as Perera laid off a long ball to Jeff Hughes who fired home to make it 6-5 Sockers. The game quickly broke down as in the same of a minute there were three penalties and a shootout attempt. Both Harris and Chiles went to the box for boarding making it 4v4 before Touloute was brought down by Toth to set up a Gibson shootout. Toth though made the save in the shootout and neither team could score on the ensuing short sided game. Shortly after the power plays ended though the Comets tied the game. Gibson got into the box and fired a shot that went wide right to Max Touloute who was able to settle the ball and fired it high over Toth and into the net tying it 6-6.\n\nAs the fourth quarter started, the Comets struck early. Gibson received the ball in the corner and was able to turn his defender. He attempted to fire a wall pass to Touloute but the pass off the wall hit a seem, went off a defender, went off Toth and rolled into the net to give the Comets the win. The Comets picked up the high pressure again and were rewarded as Harris picked off a pass at midfield. Harris then raced to the yellow line and fired a shot that took a deflection and went in to make it 8-6. With the two goal deficit, the Sockers pushed forward trying to find a way back in, but it was the Comets who hit on the counter this time as Gibson played Touloute into the corner. He controlled the ball and laid it off to the on coming Matingou who fired the ball into the net to make it 9-6. Coming out of the restart the Sockers put their sixth attacker on. With the extra man, the Sockers controlled the game and quickly found a goal as Chiles received the ball in the corner and beat Waltman to get the Sockers back within 2. The Sockers then shortly went back to the sixth attacker after winning possession and were looking to cut the lead to one, but the Comets took advantage of the empty net, winning the ball near the yellow line, Assadpour fired a shot over Hughes head and into the net. The Comets will get another competitive game this week as they take on the Milwaukee Wave in Milwaukee.\n\nDwyer Officially Re-Signed, Sporting Close on Marin and Hungarian Nemeth\n\nWhat'd been hinted at since the weekend and even officially stated by Robb Heineman on Sports Radio 810 is now officially true. Today, Sporting KC formally announced that Dom Dwyer had signed a contract extension with Sporting Kansas City. Dwyer had a break out year in 2014, scoring 22 goals in league play, and 24 in all competitions, both were club records that had stood since the team's inaugural season, when Preki set the records.\n\nWhile Dwyer says that the deal is a sign to \"back off right now\" it also helps KC out if teams don't back off. The new deal increases any potential transfer fee a team wants to pay to get Dwyer's services.\n\nAlso today, Sam McDowell with the Star was able to get confirmation from a source on KC's side of things that the club was in discussions with Chilean goalkeeper, Luis Marin. Reports out of Chile have been linking Marin with a move to MLS for a little while now, and over the weekend he was linked with Sporting KC. And while McDowell says the club is still finalizing the contracts, reports in Chile say that Marin is set to sign a four year deal with the club.\n\nMcDowell was also able to put a name to the forward that KC was close to signing, presumably the one that Heineman mentioned in his interview with 810. Krisztian Nemeth, a Hungarian is fairly well traveled having played in Hungary, England, Greece, and the Netherlands looks headed to Kansas City. While only 25, Nemeth has, on paper, a great pedigree, having been under contract with both Liverpool and Olympiacos, but made minimal appearances for the two clubs, spending most of his time with the reserves or on loan. Still, the talent is there that originally attracted the English club to him. He helped lead the Liverpool reserves to the championship in their division when he was with the club. Nemeth has also featured for his national team, playing 15 times for the full Hungarian national team, scoring once and was a fixture in the country's youth system. Most recently, he was with Roda JC Kerkrade of the Dutch league, scoring 8 goals in 19 league appearances for the club in the 2013-2014 season. If he can find his form, and if he can stay healthy (an issue that marred his time with both Liverpool and Olympiacos) he can be successful in KC and could be a steal of a signing.\n\nA Look at Heineman's #flyNtweet\n\nWith the offseason in full swing, it'd been a while since Robb Heineman had hosted one of his Twitter Q&A sessions. So today with a trip home from New York, Heineman held a #flyNtweet. Fans asked a number of questions, I'll just touch on a few of the higher points here.\n\nOne of the first questions posted a proposed starting 11 and asked Heineman how many of the 11 he expected to start the season. Heineman responded with just over half, six of the 11 he expected to start. You can make assumptions, but it's easy to guess Dwyer, Zusi, Feilhaber, Sinovic, Besler, and Marin as the six Heineman is thinking of. To go along with all those changes to the starting lineup that was posted, Heineman also said that he expects 10 new players to be brought in. Considering the team was sitting on 19 players under contract, adding 10 isn't that much of a surprise.\n\nA number of the questions that Heineman was asked pertained to the team's pursuit of Roger Espinoza and bringing him back into a KC uniform. Heineman continues to have high hopes for bringing up back, and also stated that the Honduran would not be a DP if and when he returns. His return is something that Heineman seems to be really interested in and wanting to happen.\n\nSpeaking of Espinoza and the defensive midfield position, Heineman said the team is looking at several DMs. He also said that DM is one of the three positions that he felt needed the most improvement along with goalkeeper and left winger.\n\nElsewhere on the field, another question from fans was the health of Chance Myers and how his recovery was going. Heineman said that Myers is currently ahead of schedule and will start.\n\nWhen it came to the Superdraft and Sporting's 3 first round picks, Heineman said that right now he's guessing that the team will trade some of those picks. Whether that's for allocation money, or to move up in the draft like Heineman hinted at yesterday, remains to be seen.\n\nAnother question that Heineman has been asked that has been a topic of discussion off and on all year is the future of Erik Palmer-Brown. With the interest from Juventus apparently still going strong the question is how long he'll stay. When asked about the plans for EPB, Heineman said that he'd like to go to Europe. He does come back later though and says that there aren't plans to sell him this winter. Of course since EPB isn't 18 yet and can't get an EU work permit yet, selling him before his 18th birthday doesn't make sense anyway.\n\nIn terms of player signings, Heineman confirmed another one for the club, saying the team has signed a guy that can play on the wing, another area that Heineman said needed to improve. Heineman was also asked about signing another designated player, to witch Heineman responded that the chances were \"strong to quite strong.\" When I responded wtih a question asking if that mean there would be a fourth DP slot or if that meant getting rid of Claudio Bieler, Heineman responded that the team has allocation money that would be able to be used to pay down the salary to below DP levels. As a follow up to that, Heineman was asked whether the new DP was a new player or if Dwyer's contract would make him a DP. He confirmed that it would be a new player, meaning Dwyer signed his new contract for under a DP contract. Heineman was also asked specifically about TFC's Dominic Oduro, which he responded by saying that while he's a guy they like, his salary is too high. Heineman also said that the two players that Sporting is looking to bring in this year to play goal are both from outside MLS curently. He also confirmed that KC's new goalkeeper is not a DP as well.\n\nAnother question for the team heading into 2015 was whether Brazilian Igor Juliao would return to KC. The Fluminense right back was on loan last year, and Heineman seems to be optimistic on him returning to Kansas City for the new season.\n\nHeineman also has high on the possibility of bringing back Jacob Peterson.\n\nThere's another opportunity for KC to pick up players this week in the second stage of the re-entry draft. Based off Heineman's Tweet though it doesn't look like KC fans should expect much from that draft.\n\nWhile bringing in new players is important, one area on the field has been lacking a lot since the stadium opened has been the team's home form. Sporting Park hasn't been the fortress that the team really wants. It hasn't become a stadium like Rio Tinto where Sporting can have a long unbeaten run. Heineman said that this is one of the biggest things that the team is emphasizing.\n\nQuestions about the CBA came up, and while Heineman said that he can't speak on it, he did make one comment regarding the potential layout of the league, saying that the odds of adding 2 more DPs to bring the total to 5 or doubling the cap were both 0.\n\nOne response I was sad to see was Heineman's answer to a question about a hall of fame in Kansas City. I'd read articles last week about US Soccer signing a non-compete agreement with the city of Frisco, Texas to negotiate building a Hall of Fame there. But it's still disappointing to see Heineman come out and say it's not going to happen in KC.\n\nOver the course of the Tweets, Heineman did kill a couple of the silly rumors that fans have come up with. Including the idea that Sporting should go after Steven Gerrard of Liverpool or make a trade with Columbus to try to bring Kei Kamara back to Kansas City or even the thought of moving US-Mexico away from Columbus before the US team actually loses there.\n\nAnother area that hasn't been touched on in a while that was brought up again is the stadium sponsorship of Sporting Park. Since the split with the LiveStrong corporation Sporting Park has not had a stadium sponsor. And unfortunately according to Heineman, there is no new news on it either.\n\nAnother off the field area that Heineman touched on was some news that was also in the letter the team sent to the Garden City mayor about the USSF training facility. The facility will apparently be starting in March, a big step for Kansas City.\n\nBut remember about Heineman's answers:\n\nReview of SKC Academy Graduates in College\n\nThe college soccer season is over, and with it is a final review of the college season for Sporting KC Academy graduates.

Neither team was able to get on the board in the first quarter, with Danny Waltman being called upon to make a number of import saves to keep the score scoreless. The second quarter started much the same before four and a half minutes in, Coady Andrews deflected a Wichita clearance into the net to give the Comets the first goal of the game. Near the midpoint of the quarter the Comets found themselves on the power play after a boarding penalty. With the man advantage they doubled their lead as Max Touloute found John Sosa who scored to make it 2-0. This is how the scores remained heading into the half time break.\n\nThe third quarter is where the Comets really broke the game open, scoring six goals to put the game away. It started less than a minute in as Vahid Assadpour scored to make it 3-0. Just under six minutes in, the Comets made it 4-0 as Leo Gibson picked up his first assist of the night, setting up Touloute for the goal. The Comets continued to fly and eight minutes in, Assadpour had his brace off an assist from Sosa. Just over a minute later though the B-52's were on the board through John Markey. The Comets though responded in kind as Milan Ivanovic's shot was deflected in off of Gibson to restore the four goal lead. Late in the half the Comets again struck in quick succession, scoring two goals just over 30 seconds a part. Alain Matingou started the scoring off another assist from Gibson before Brian Harris finished out the scoring in the quarter firing home a restart after a touch from Sosa.\n\nThe fourth quarter saw the B-52s try to make a game of it, but the teams ended up exchanging goals for most of the quarter. The quarter started with the Comets finishing up a power play from the third quarter, and right as the penalty expired, Sosa picked out Bryan Perez who beat Boris Pardo to make it 9-1. Wichita responded quickly as Pardo found Brady Bryant, who got in behind Missouri's defense and beat Waltman to make it 9-2. Six minutes in the Comets again found themselves on the power play and again the Comets took advantage as Gibson found Sosa for his second of the night to make it 10-2. The final quarter saw a number of power play opportunities, the B-52s took advantage of their own after a penalty on the Comets for too many men. With the extra attacker and putting in their sixth attacker, the B-52s again cut the lead to seven through Matt Clare. Shortly after that the Comets were again down a man for a boarding foul on Sosa. The Comets though were the ones that took advantage of Wichita throwing numbers forward as Touloute won the ball and was able to walk it into the net to make it 11-3. Less than a minute left the Comets won a power play themselves after the Wichita sixth attacker, Alex Moseley handled the ball outside the box. On the ensuing shootout attempt, Gibson's shot hit the post, but was turned in by Harris to finish the scoring for the night at 12-3.\n\nThe Comets now have a weekend off before returning home the weekend after Christmas to take on the San Diego Sockers, which should be a more competitive game against one of the better PASL teams.\n\nSporting Garden City?\n\nSporting Kansas City looks like they're trying to expand their affiliate network further. Already with 13 affiliated youth clubs, Sporting is looking to expand it further into Western Kansas as the team is on the agenda for an upcoming meeting in Garden City, Kansas about building a youth complex there with STAR Bonds and the potential creation of a PDL team.\n\nStarting on page 74 of the document is a letter from Sporting to the city discussing the club and their proposal to build a youth soccer complex with Sporting Garden City being the primary tenant of the facility.\n\nThe hope for the facility from reading the letter is that the facility may take on a residency type feel as there's talk in the letter of building dormitories, classrooms, etc. The fields themselves would be a mix of synthetic and grass fields with a \"championship field\" stadium as well. The stadium is where the team would hope to have a PDL team play. Sporting's hope is that a local investor would step up to run the PDL club but the club would have Sporting's support.\n\nThe PDL part is where Sporting lose me a bit on this. While Garden City wouldn't be the smallest city to have a PDL team (Portsmouth, NH, St. Albans, VT, and Bluefield, WV all have teams), it just seems like an odd place to put a team. Would the team go to the Mountain Division and have to travel to the likes of Albuquerque, Las Vegas, and Provo, or would they fit in the Heartland Division with the likes of Thunder Bay and Winnipeg. Honestly a Garden City team would probably be better off in the NPSL playing in a South Central Conference that would see their longest trip being San Antonio and close trips to Wichita and Joplin.\n\nI like the plan for the youth development, it's certainly an area that KC could find players in, they've done it before with the likes of Eduardo Moreno playing in KC's academy a few years ago, training with the first team and spending a little time with the US U18 national team in Bradenton, FL. As for the PDL, I would think SKC could be better served trying to get a team back in KC, or to try to put a team in Omaha and try to get into the Creighton pipeline a little bit.\n\nRe-Entry Draft Tomorrow\n\nTomorrow MLS hosts another one of their drafts, the first stage of the Re-Entry Draft. The draft, a mechanism added in the last CBA to allow players some movement within the league. Tomorrow's first leg is usually the slower of the two stages of the draft. Since the draft started in 2010, only 11 players have been taken in the first stage of the four prior drafts. Last year saw the most activity ever in the first stage as five players were selected.\n\nThis year, there are 62 players available to select in the draft. The rules of this stage of the draft are simple. The players are every MLS player that meet certain requirements (at least 23 years old with 3 years experience, at least 25 with at least 4 years of experience, or at least 30 years old with at least 8 years of experience) and have had their contract options either declined or are out of contract. If a player is selected at this stage, the team that selects him is agreeing to either pick up that player's option or to make them a bona fide offer. If the player doesn't accept the contract, the team owns that player's MLS rights.\n\nUsually the second leg, which offers more flexibility is where there is more activity.\n\nFor Sporting KC, Peter Vermes has never made a selection in first stage of the re-entry draft, passing every year so far. For me, even though KC is in a bit of a rebuilding mode right now, I see no reason that this strategy of Vermes' is going to change. In fact Vermes hasn't really even used stage two of the draft either, only selecting one player, Frankie Hejduk (who was almost immediately traded to LA for Luke Sassano) ever.\n\nLooking at this year's list I again don't see any players that Vermes is going to want to live without. Come next week Sporting could look at grabbing someone like Hendry Thomas.\n\nMeanwhile, three Sporting players are available for selection, Josh Gardner, who's retired and taken up individual volleyball, and two of Sporting's goalkeepers, Andy Gruenebaum and Eric Kronberg.\n\nSporting Lose Zizzo in Expansion Draft, Pick Up Anibaba\n\nThe MLS expansion draft is done, and Sporting KC pretty much made it out of the draft unscathed. The only player from Sporting KC that was selected in the draft was winger, Sal Zizzo, who had already had his option declined by the club. New York City FC took Zizzo with their 9th pick of the expansion draft. Zizzo had played 19 league games for KC, 24 in all competitions, and scored one goal for the club. He also added three assists in league play for Kansas City. The loss of Zizzo is felt more off the field because of his role in the Benny Feilhaber Show. With Zizzo off the board, Sporting had pulled back forward, Jacob Peterson. But with just two picks left, no more Sporting players were taken.\n\nOn top of Zizzo not being expected back, Sporting also got themselves allocation money for the pick.\n\nThe other part of the draft that Sporting fans were keeping an eye on were Orlando's selections. With the future considerations from the Aurelien Collin trade still hanging out there, each pick that Orlando made was met with comments of disappointment or hope that a player would be coming to KC. After Orlando's fourth pick, Pedro Ribeiro, was taken, Sporting's President Tweeted \"Nice pick by Orlando...\" immediately getting fans to focus on that pick specifically, but the top four in general.\n\nAfter the draft was over, the future considerations became clear as sources in both Orlando and Kansas City said that it was former Seattle Sounders defender, Jalil Anibaba, taken with Orlando's third pick, that was headed to Kansas City. Anibaba played in 16 games for the Sounders last year, starting 14 of them. That was his first season in Seattle, before that he'd spent four years in Chicago. In 2013 with the Fire, Anibaba played every minute of Chicago's 34 games. Anibaba had been drafted one spot before Sporting KC's former forward, CJ Sapong in the 2011 draft. He'd actually been a player that myself and others thought would be a good fit for Kansas City as Sporting had needed center back depth heading into the 2011 season. Overall, I think getting Anibaba is a good move. He's experienced and gives KC options at both center back and right back. He's also not overly expensive, with a 2014 base salary of just under $120,000. His guaranteed compensation is a little higher, close to $160,000, but still manageable for Kansas City.\n\nAnother Look at the Expansion Draft for KC\n\nTomorrow, Orlando City and New York City FC will both select up to 10 players from the existing 18 MLS teams. Yesterday the protection and exposure lists came out from the teams. Since then, there's been a lot of speculation and a number of mock drafts on who would be taken by the two clubs. Since then, mock drafts have been flowing around. Within those drafts, KC players have generally been taken in most, but not all of them.\n\nAgain, here are the players that Sporting KC has left exposed: Claudio Bieler, Jorge Claros, Antonio Dovale, Chrisitan Duke, Andy Gruenebaum, Michael Kafari, Eric Kronberg, Victor Munoz, Lawrence Olum, Jacob Peterson, Soony Saad, Martin Steuble, and Sal Zizzo.\n\nFrom the different drafts I found I've seen Bieler, Claros, Gruenebaum, Saad, and Zizzo all taken. So here's a look at my thoughts on those five plus the rest of KC's exposed players and the likelihood of them being taken.\n\nClaudio Bieler - Was selected number one overall in the draft done by the Columbus Crew's digital team. Of the two teams, Bieler would probably be more likely to go to Orlando than New York. With New York already having two DP slots filled, I doubt they'd potentially use the third on Bieler. As for Orlando, I still don't think them taking Bieler is likely. They're certainly still look for strikers, but I'm not sure that Bieler is the target that they'd look at in the draft.\n\nJorge Claros - If his salary on the Players Union site is accurate ($90,000), this is certainly an appealing selection. He's a World Cup veteran and still near the peak of his playing level. He's probably the most surprising available of KC's exposed players. With how much time KC spent looking to bring him in and the issues that KC had at the deep midfield position in 2014 it's a surprise that he's exposed. I could certainly see him being selected.\n\nAndy Gruenebaum - To be fair, the draft that had Orlando taking him was done before the news that KC had not picked up his option. Still I'm not sure that either club spends a pick on Gruenebaum. They both have the ability to renegotiate the contract with players, but with some of the goalkeeping talent available, I'm not sure either team would take the chance on a player who's missed plenty of time over the last two seasons with injury.\n\nSoony Saad - This is a pick for rights. With Saad set to leave MLS for Thailand, if either team picked him up, it'd be in the hope of him returning to MLS and that team holding his MLS rights. Saad did was a decent goalscorer for Kansas City, but could never establish himself as a consistent scorer in his four years in KC. Based on his experience before signing with MLS, I would assume that Saad would look to move to Europe from Thailand before trying his luck in MLS again, unless a good offer came along. But with him still being young, it'd be a good late round flyer for a team.\n\nSal Zizzo - Another player that is no longer on KC's roster. The draft with him taken talked up his wing play in Orlando's system. While he wasn't a horrible winger for Kansas City, he didn't really provide enough to the offense as a winger in KC's system for me to think he'd be taken in the expansion draft.\n\nAs for the rest of the players, here's a quick look (I'm combining a few).\n\nAntonio Dovale - Has already returned to Spain, I think his return to MLS, while possible, is not likely to happen.\n\nChrisitan Duke, Michael Kafari, and Victor Munoz - Have played a grand total of 36 competitive minutes for KC, none of these three are being taken.\n\nEric Kronberg - Kronberg had been a career back up until this year when he was given the starting job with Kansas City. He didn't have a great showing, making mistakes on when to come off his line and when to stay home. Like Gruenebaum, with the number of keepers available in the draft I can't see Kronberg being taken.\n\nLawrence Olum - Like Saad, Olum's intentions to leave have already been made known and KC has already terminated his contract. So this would only be for Olum's MLS rights. But unlike Saad, youth is not on Olum's side so taking a flyer on him in case he returns seems unlikely.\n\nJacob Peterson - A work horse that has played everywhere in Vermes' system it seems, Peterson is out of contract so the team would be drafting his MLS rights. While Peterson has seen some success here, he's been a role player throughout his career. This could make him attractive to Orlando or New York as a veteran presence.\n\nMartin Steuble - The Swiss-Filipino played minimal minutes for Kansas City this year. I think the lack of time and familiarity with him will probably keep him from being taken.\n\nAnd while KC may lose two players, there's still the potential of them picking up a player tomorrow via their \"future considerations\" from the Aurelien Collin trade. The speculation on the future considerations immediately turned to tomorrow's expansion draft, especially after Vermes said the considerations would be a player. There are really two ways that this could break down. The first is that one of the 10 players that Orlando selects tomorrow will immediately be on their way to Kansas City. A lot of that speculation has centered around Philadelphia goalkeeper, Zac MacMath, who was originally part of the CJ Sapong trade rumor when it came up on Sunday night. The thing that might make that unlikely is Philadelphia's trade that sent Amobi Okugo to Orlando as well. Part of that deal could have been a \"handshake agreement\" to not take any of their players in the expansion draft. There are other goalkeepers available that KC could look at if they wanted to grab a keeper this way, the likes of Raul Fernandez (who I doubt KC takes as he'll miss close to a 3rd of the season while on national team duty), Jeff Attinella, or even Troy Perkins.\n\nThe other possibility is that KC would have one of their players selected by Orlando and the considerations would be Orlando just returning that player to us at the end of the draft. That would effectively allow KC to protect 13 players. The good news is we'll all be able to listen in to the draft."
