        "text": "TAMOXIFEN RETINOPATHY DURING TREATMENT OF AN INOPERABLE DESMOID TUMOR.\n\nPubMed\n\nFurst, Meredith; Somogyi, Marie B; Wong, Robert W; Araujo, Dejka; Harper, Clio A\n\n2017-12-08\n\nTo evaluate the clinical significance and rarity of tamoxifen retinopathy after a long-term tamoxifen treatment for an inoperable desmoid tumor. Case report. Tamoxifen retinopathy is a condition rarely observed in clinical practice. Although tamoxifen is typically a treatment for breast cancer patients, we present a 68-year-old woman taking tamoxifen for an inoperable desmoid tumor, an equally rare condition. She presented with bilaterally deteriorating vision over the course of a year. Fundoscopic examination revealed parafoveal deposits bilaterally. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography exhibited hyperreflective deposits in all layers of the retina. She had a cumulative treatment dose of 292 g of tamoxifen, and the medication was subsequently stopped. Her vision remained stable 3 months after the cessation of tamoxifen. The development of tamoxifen retinopathy in the treatment of a desmoid tumor makes this case a rare entity, and this is the first reported case of these two concomitant conditions to our knowledge. With the use of long-term tamoxifen as a primary treatment, we recommend screening at regular intervals by an ophthalmologist as an integral part of treatment.\n\nTamoxifen treatment of bleeding irregularities associated with Norplant use.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdel-Aleem, Hany; Shaaban, Omar M; Amin, Ahmed F; Abdel-Aleem, Aly M\n\n2005-12-01\n\nTo evaluate the possible role of tamoxifen (selective estrogen receptor modulators, SERM) in treating bleeding irregularities associated with Norplant contraceptive use. Randomized clinical trial including 100 Norplant users complaining of vaginal bleeding irregularities. The trial was conducted in the Family Planning Clinic of Assiut University Hospital. Women were assigned at random to receive tamoxifen tablets (10 mg) twice daily for 10 days or similar placebo. Women were followed-up for 3 months. The end points were percentage of women who stopped bleeding during treatment, bleeding/spotting days during the period of follow-up, effect of treatment on their lifestyle, and side effects and discontinuation of contraception. There was good compliance with treatment. At the end of treatment, a significantly higher percentage of tamoxifen users stopped bleeding in comparison to the control group (88% vs. 68%, respectively; p=.016). Women who used tamoxifen had significantly less bleeding and/or spotting days than women who used placebo, during the first and second months. During the third month, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Women who used tamoxifen reported improvement in performing household activities, religious duties and in sexual life, during the first 2 months. In the third month, there were no differences between the two groups. There were no significant differences between tamoxifen and placebo groups in reporting side effects. In the group who used tamoxifen, two women discontinued Norplant use because of bleeding vs. nine women in the placebo group. Tamoxifen use at a dose of 10 mg twice daily orally, for 10 days, has a beneficial effect on vaginal bleeding associated with Norplant use. In addition, the bleeding pattern was better in women who used tamoxifen for the following 2 months after treatment. However, these results have to be confirmed in a larger trial before advocating this line of treatment.\n\nEffects of exemestane, anastrozole and tamoxifen on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers in postmenopausal early breast cancer patients: results of N-SAS BC 04, the TEAM Japan substudy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAihara, T; Suemasu, K; Takei, H; Hozumi, Y; Takehara, M; Saito, T; Ohsumi, S; Masuda, N; Ohashi, Y\n\n2010-01-01\n\nUse of aromatase inhibitors in women with postmenopausal breast cancer accompanies risks of bone loss. We evaluated changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers in patients treated with exemestane, anastrozole or tamoxifen for hormone-sensitive postmenopausal early breast cancer. Sixty-eight patients enrolled in the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational Japan bone substudy were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen, exemestane or anastrozole. During a 2-year study period, lumbar spine BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and urinary type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (NTX) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were also measured. BMD at 2 years of treatment was higher in tamoxifen patients compared with exemestane and anastrozole patients; however, the intergroup difference was not significant (p = 0.2521 and p = 0.0753, respectively). BMD was higher in exemestane patients compared with anastrozole patients; however, the intergroup difference was not significant (p = 0.7059 and p = 0.8134, respectively). NTX and BAP were significantly lower in tamoxifen patients compared with exemestane and anastrozole patients at 1 and 2 years of treatment (p < 0.05). Tamoxifen may provide better bone protection compared with exemestane or anastrozole. The effect of exemestane and anastrozole on bone loss may be comparable in Japanese postmenopausal women.

Does tamoxifen reduce brain injury in the rat pup? Seven-day-old rat pups had the right carotid artery permanently ligated followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia (8% oxygen). Tamoxifen (10 mg/kg) or vehicle was given i.p. 5 min prior to hypoxia, or 5 min after reoxygenation, with a second dose given 6 h after the first. Brain damage was evaluated by weight deficit of the right hemisphere 22 days following hypoxia and gross and microscopic morphology. Tamoxifen pre-treatment reduced brain weight loss from 21.5+/-4.0% in vehicle pups (n=27) to 2.6+/-2.5% in the treated pups (n=22, P<0.05). Treatment 5 min after reoxygenation reduced brain weight loss from 27.5+/-4.0% in vehicle pups (n=42) to 12.0+/-3.9% in the treated pups (n=30, P<0.05). Tamoxifen reduces brain injury in the neonatal rat.\n\nFive Years of Tamoxifen Continues to Benefit Women 15 Years after Treatment\n\nCancer.gov\n\nIn a large randomized clinical trial, women with early-stage breast cancer who received 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen had better outcomes up to 15 years after the start of treatment than those who received 2 years of tamoxifen therapy.\n\nTamoxifen and vitamin E treatments delay symptoms in the mouse model of Niemann-Pick C.\n\nPubMed\n\nBascuÃ±an-Castillo, Eric C; Erickson, Robert P; Howison, Christy M; Hunter, Robert J; Heidenreich, Randall H; Hicks, Chad; Trouard, Theodore P; Gillies, Robert J\n\n2004-01-01\n\nNiemann-Pick C disease (NPC) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder without current treatment. It is the result of deficient intracellular cholesterol movement. We investigated the effects of tamoxifen and vitamin E (D-alpha tocopherol) treatment on patterns of weight loss and motor function in the mouse model of Niemann-Pick C disease (Npc1-/- mice). Tamoxifen has multiple metabolic effects, including reducing oxidative damage, while vitamin E primarily has this property. Npc1-/- mice were identified and treatment was initiated at an approximate age of 21 days. Tamoxifen suspended in peanut oil was administered via intraperitoneal injection (weekly, at a dose calculated to deliver 0.023 microg/g/day). Vitamin E (25 IU) was administered orally via gavage once a week. Weight loss and Rota-Rod performance were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meyer survival curves. Tamoxifen treatment by itself significantly delayed weight loss (an endpoint of neurodegeneration) in male and female mice compared to untreated controls. Motor function was evaluated by performance on a Rota-Rod. Tamoxifen maintained Rota-Rod performance for about an extra week. Vitamin E treatment significantly delayed weight loss in females only. Rota-Rod performance was maintained slightly longer in mice treated with vitamin E. Simultaneous use of both treatments did not delay weight loss longer than tamoxifen-only treatment but had a greater effect than either treatment alone on Rota-Rod performance and demonstrated a significant positive effect on the early \"learning curve\" portion of the Rota-Rod evaluations. We found significant but relatively small improvements in rate of disease progression by treating Npc1-/- mice with tamoxifen and/or vitamin E. Some sex differences in response and an early improvement in Rota-Rod performance suggest areas for further study.\n\nTamoxifen with ovarian function suppression versus tamoxifen alone as an adjuvant treatment for premenopausal breast cancer: a meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYan, Shunchao; Li, Kai; Jiao, Xin; Zou, Huawei\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Ovarian function suppression (OFS) significantly downregulates the concentration of plasma estrogens. However, it is unclear whether it offers any survival benefits if combined with adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in premenopausal women. This meta-analysis was designed to assess data from previous studies involving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment plus OFS in premenopausal breast cancer. Methods Electronic literature databases (PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials published prior to February 1, 2015. Only randomized controlled trials that compared tamoxifen alone with tamoxifen plus OFS for premenopausal women with breast cancer were selected. The evaluated endpoints were disease-free survival and overall survival. Results Four randomized controlled trials comprising 6,279 patients (OFS combination, n=3,133; tamoxifen alone, n=3,146) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant improvement in disease-free survival or overall survival with addition of OFS in either the whole population or the hormone receptor-positive subgroup. The risk of distant recurrence was not reduced with the addition of OFS in the whole population. A subgroup analysis showed that addition of OFS significantly improved overall survival in patients who were administered chemotherapy. Conclusion Based on the available studies, concurrent administration of OFS and adjuvant tamoxifen treatment for premenopausal women with breast cancer has no effect on prolonging disease-free survival and overall survival, excluding patients who were administered chemotherapy. It should not be widely recommended, except perhaps for women who were hormone-receptor positive and who were also administered adjuvant chemotherapy. PMID:26109867\n\nIntegrative Analysis of Response to Tamoxifen Treatment in ER-Positive Breast Cancer Using GWAS Information and Transcription Profiling.\n\nPubMed\n\nHicks, Chindo; Kumar, Ranjit; Pannuti, Antonio; Miele, Lucio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nVariable response and resistance to tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer patients remains a major clinical problem. To determine whether genes and biological pathways containing SNPs associated with risk for breast cancer are dysregulated in response to tamoxifen treatment, we performed analysis combining information from 43 genome-wide association studies with gene expression data from 298 ER(+) breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen and 125 ER(+) controls. We identified 95 genes which distinguished tamoxifen treated patients from controls. Additionally, we identified 54 genes which stratified tamoxifen treated patients into two distinct groups. We identified biological pathways containing SNPs associated with risk for breast cancer, which were dysregulated in response to tamoxifen treatment. Key pathways identified included the apoptosis, P53, NFkB, DNA repair and cell cycle pathways. Combining GWAS with transcription profiling provides a unified approach for associating GWAS findings with response to drug treatment and identification of potential drug targets.\n\nDextromethorphan as a phenotyping test to predict endoxifen exposure in patients on tamoxifen treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Graan, Anne-Joy M; Teunissen, Sebastiaan F; de Vos, Filip Y F L; Loos, Walter J; van Schaik, Ron H N; de Jongh, Felix E; de Vos, Aad I; van Alphen, Robbert J; van der Holt, Bronno; Verweij, Jaap; Seynaeve, Caroline; Beijnen, Jos H; Mathijssen, Ron H J\n\n2011-08-20\n\nTamoxifen, a widely used agent for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer, is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A to form its most abundant active metabolite, endoxifen. Interpatient variability in toxicity and efficacy of tamoxifen is substantial. Contradictory results on the value of CYP2D6 genotyping to reduce the variable efficacy have been reported. In this pharmacokinetic study, we investigated the value of dextromethorphan, a known probe drug for both CYP2D6 and CYP3A enzymatic activity, as a potential phenotyping probe for tamoxifen pharmacokinetics. In this prospective study, 40 women using tamoxifen for invasive breast cancer received a single dose of dextromethorphan 2 hours after tamoxifen intake. Dextromethorphan, tamoxifen, and their respective metabolites were quantified. Exposure parameters of all compounds were estimated, log transformed, and subsequently correlated. A strong and highly significant correlation (r = -0.72; P < .001) was found between the exposures of dextromethorphan (0 to 6 hours) and endoxifen (0 to 24 hours). Also, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of dextromethorphan (0 to 6 hours) and daily trough endoxifen concentration was strongly correlated (r = -0.70; P < .001). In a single patient using the potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine, the low endoxifen concentration was accurately predicted by dextromethorphan exposure. Dextromethorphan exposure after a single administration adequately predicted endoxifen exposure in individual patients with breast cancer taking tamoxifen. This test could contribute to the personalization and optimization of tamoxifen treatment, but it needs additional validation and simplification before being applicable in future dosing strategies.\n\nQuality of life in relation to tamoxifen or exemestane treatment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients: a Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) Trial side study.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Nes, J G H; Fontein, D B Y; Hille, E T M; Voskuil, D W; van Leeuwen, F E; de Haes, J C J M; Putter, H; Seynaeve, C; Nortier, J W R; van de Velde, C J H\n\n2012-07-01\n\nTamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are associated with side effects which can significantly impact quality of life (QoL). We assessed QoL in the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) Trial and compared these data with reported adverse events in the main database. 2,754 Dutch postmenopausal early breast cancer patients were randomized between 5 years of exemestane, or tamoxifen (2.5-3 years) followed by exemestane (2.5-2 years). 742 patients were invited to participate in the QoL side study and complete questionnaires at 1 (T1) and 2 (T2) years after start of endocrine treatment. Questionnaires comprised the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 questionnaires, supplemented with FACT-ES questions. 543 patients completed questionnaires at T1 and 454 patients (84%) at T2. Overall QoL and most functioning scales improved over time. The only clinically relevant and statistically significant difference between treatment types concerned insomnia; exemestane-treated patients reported more insomnia than tamoxifen-treated patients. Discrepancy was observed between QoL issue scores reported by the patients and adverse events reported by physicians. Certain QoL issues are treatment- and/or time-specific and deserve attention by health care providers. There is a need for careful inquiry into QoL issues by those prescribing endocrine treatment to optimize QoL and treatment adherence.\n\nTamoxifen treatment for pubertal gynecomastia in two siblings with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaito, Reiko; Yamamoto, Yukiyo; Goto, Motohide; Araki, Shunsuke; Kubo, Kazuyasu; Kawagoe, Rinko; Kawada, Yasusada; Kusuhara, Koichi; Igarashi, Maki; Fukami, Maki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAlthough tamoxifen has been shown to be fairly safe and effective for idiopathic pubertal gynecomastia, it remains unknown whether it is also beneficial for gynecomastia associated with endocrine disorders. Here, we report the effect of tamoxifen on pubertal gynecomastia in 2 siblings with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS). Cases 1 and 2 presented with persistent pubertal gynecomastia at 13 and 16 years of age, respectively. Physical examinations revealed breast of Tanner stage 3 and normal male-type external genitalia in both cases. Clinical features such as female-type pubic hair and borderline small testis indicated mildly impaired masculinization. Molecular analysis identified a previously reported p.Arg789Ser mutation in the androgen receptor gene (AR) in the 2 cases. Two months of oral administration of tamoxifen ameliorated gynecomastia to Tanner stage 2 with no adverse events. Additional treatment with testosterone enanthate showed negligible effects on body hair and penile length. Hormone values of the 2 cases during tamoxifen treatment remained similar to those in previously reported untreated patients with PAIS. The results indicate that tamoxifen was effective in treating pubertal gynecomastia in these 2 patients with PAIS and may be considered as a therapeutic option in this situation pending further studies.\n\n4-protein signature predicting tamoxifen treatment outcome in recurrent breast cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Marchi, Tommaso; Liu, Ning Qing; Stingl, Cristoph; Timmermans, Mieke A; Smid, Marcel; Look, Maxime P; Tjoa, Mila; Braakman, Rene B H; Opdam, Mark; Linn, Sabine C; Sweep, Fred C G J; Span, Paul N; Kliffen, Mike; Luider, Theo M; Foekens, John A; Martens, John W M; Umar, Arzu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEstrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors represent the majority of breast malignancies, and are effectively treated with hormonal therapies, such as tamoxifen. However, in the recurrent disease resistance to tamoxifen therapy is common and a major cause of death. In recent years, in-depth proteome analyses have enabled identification of clinically useful biomarkers, particularly, when heterogeneity in complex tumor tissue was reduced using laser capture microdissection (LCM). In the current study, we performed high resolution proteomic analysis on two cohorts of ER positive breast tumors derived from patients who either manifested good or poor outcome to tamoxifen treatment upon recurrence. A total of 112 fresh frozen tumors were collected from multiple medical centers and divided into two sets: an in-house training and a multi-center test set. Epithelial tumor cells were enriched with LCM and analyzed by nano-LC Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS), which yielded >3000 and >4000 quantified proteins in the training and test sets, respectively. Raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD000484 and PXD000485. Statistical analysis showed differential abundance of 99 proteins, of which a subset of 4 proteins was selected through a multivariate step-down to develop a predictor for tamoxifen treatment outcome. The 4-protein signature significantly predicted poor outcome patients in the test set, independent of predictive histopathological characteristics (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 4.17; multivariate Cox regression p value = 0.017). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of PDCD4, one of the signature proteins, on an independent set of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues provided and independent technical validation (HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.92; multivariate Cox regression p value = 0.009). We hereby report the first validated protein predictor for tamoxifen treatment outcome in recurrent ER-positive breast\n\nTamoxifen dose and serum concentrations of tamoxifen and six of its metabolites in routine clinical outpatient care.\n\nPubMed\n\nJager, N G L; Rosing, H; Schellens, J H M; Linn, S C; Beijnen, J H\n\n2014-02-01\n\nA sensitive and selective HPLC-MS/MS assay was used to analyze steady-state serum concentrations of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen (E)-endoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, N-desmethyl-4'-hydroxytamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and 4'-hydroxytamoxifen to support therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in patients treated with tamoxifen according to standard of care. When the (Z)-endoxifen serum concentration was below the predefined therapeutic threshold concentration of 5.9 ng/mL, the clinician was advised to increase the tamoxifen dose and to collect another serum sample. Paired serum samples from patients at one dose level at different time points during the tamoxifen treatment were used to assess the intra-patient variability. A total of 251 serum samples were analyzed, obtained from 205 patients. Of these patients, 197 used 20 mg tamoxifen per day and 8 patients used 10 mg/day. There was wide variability in tamoxifen and metabolite concentrations within the dosing groups. The threshold concentration for (Z)-endoxifen was reached in one patient (12 %) in the 10 mg group, in 153 patients (78 %) in the 20 mg group, and in 26 (96 %) of the patients who received a dose increase to 30 or 40 mg/day. Dose increase from 20 to 30 or 40 mg per day resulted in a significant increase in the mean serum concentrations of all analytes (p < 0.001). The mean intra-patient variability was between 10 and 20 % for all analytes. These results support the suitability of TDM for optimizing the tamoxifen treatment. It is shown that tamoxifen dose is related to (Z)-endoxifen exposure and increasing this dose leads to a higher serum concentration of tamoxifen and its metabolites. The low intra-patient variability suggests that only one serum sample is needed for TDM, making this a relatively noninvasive way to optimize the patient's treatment.\n\nBreast density measurements using ultrasound tomography for patients undergoing tamoxifen treatment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSak, Mark; Duric, Neb; Littrup, Peter; Li, Cuiping; Bey-Knight, Lisa; Sherman, Mark; Boyd, Norman; Gierach, Gretchen\n\n2013-03-01\n\nWomen with high breast density have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Women treated with the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer experience a 50% reduction in risk of contralateral breast cancer and overall reduction of similar magnitude has been identified among high-risk women receiving the drug for prevention. Tamoxifen has been shown to reduce mammographic density, and in the IBIS-1 chemoprevention trial, risk reduction and decline in density were significantly associated. Ultrasound tomography (UST) is an imaging modality that can create tomographic sound speed images of the breast. These sound speed images are useful because breast density is proportional to sound speed. The aim of this work is to examine the relationship between USTmeasured breast density and the use of tamoxifen. So far, preliminary results for a small number of patients have been observed and are promising. Correlations between the UST-measured density and mammographic density are strong and positive, while relationships between UST density with some patient specific risk factors behave as expected. Initial results of UST examinations of tamoxifen treated patients show that approximately 45% of the patients have a decrease in density in the contralateral breast after only several months of treatment. The true effect of tamoxifen on UST-measured density cannot yet be fully determined until more data are collected. However, these promising results suggest that UST can be used to reliably assess quantitative changes in breast density over short intervals and therefore suggest that UST may enable rapid assessment of density changes associated with therapeutic and preventative interventions.\n\nTherapeutic drug monitoring of tamoxifen using LC-MS/MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nTchu, Simone M; Lynch, Kara L; Wu, Alan H B\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is used widely in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER+). Therapeutic monitoring of tamoxifen, and its metabolites N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDTam) and 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen (endoxifen), may be clinically useful for guiding treatment decisions. Two significant barriers to tamoxifen efficacy are: (1) variability in conversion of tamoxifen into the potent antiestrogenic metabolite, endoxifen, and (2) poor compliance and adherence to tamoxifen therapy. Therapeutic monitoring can be used to address both of these issues. Low levels of endoxifen indicate either poor compliance or poor metabolism of tamoxifen. Low tamoxifen levels would suggest poor compliance while a low ratio of endoxifen to NDTam would be indicative of poor metabolism. Solid phase extraction of patient serum followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection enables rapid, accurate, detection of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, and endoxifen.\n\nEffects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels within the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial: results of a German substudy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHadji, P; Kauka, A; Bauer, T; Tams, J; Hasenburg, A; Kieback, D G\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer within a Germany substudy of the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial. Within the TEAM trial, patients were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment with exemestane for 5 years or tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years. Serum levels of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-intact were measured at screening and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Data on hormone levels were available from 63 patients in the tamoxifen arm and 68 patients in the exemestane arm. Treatment with exemestane resulted in decreases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact levels, and increases from baseline in testosterone, DHEAS and FSH levels. Tamoxifen treatment resulted in increases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact, whereas levels of testosterone and FSH decreased and DHEAS levels did not change. At all time points assessed, the absolute change from baseline was significantly different between tamoxifen and exemestane for testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact (all p < 0.0001). Exemestane and tamoxifen had statistically significantly different effects on hormone levels, including testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact.\n\nSrc Drives Growth of Antiestrogen Resistant Breast Cancer Cell Lines and Is a Marker for Reduced Benefit of Tamoxifen Treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLarsen, Sarah L.; Laenkholm, Anne-Vibeke; Duun-Henriksen, Anne Katrine; Bak, Martin; Lykkesfeldt, Anne E.; Kirkegaard, Tove\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe underlying mechanisms leading to antiestrogen resistance in estrogen-receptor Î± (ER)-positive breast cancer is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was therefore to identify biomarkers and novel treatments for antiestrogen resistant breast cancer. We performed a kinase inhibitor screen on antiestrogen responsive T47D breast cancer cells and T47D-derived tamoxifen and fulvestrant resistant cell lines. We found that dasatinib, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, inhibited growth of the antiestrogen resistant cells compared to parental T47D cells. Furthermore western blot analysis showed increased expression and phosphorylation of Src in the resistant cells and that dasatinib inhibited phosphorylation of Src and also signaling via Akt and Erk in all cell lines. Immunoprecipitation revealed Src: ER complexes only in the parental T47D cells. In fulvestrant resistant cells, Src formed complexes with the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER)1 and HER2. Neither HER receptors nor ER were co-precipitated with Src in the tamoxifen resistant cell lines. Compared to treatment with dasatinib alone, combined treatment with dasatinib and fulvestrant had a stronger inhibitory effect on tamoxifen resistant cell growth, whereas dasatinib in combination with tamoxifen had no additive inhibitory effect on fulvestrant resistant growth. When performing immunohistochemical staining on 268 primary tumors from breast cancer patients who had received tamoxifen as first line endocrine treatment, we found that membrane expression of Src in the tumor cells was significant associated with reduced disease-free and overall survival. In conclusion, Src was identified as target for treatment of antiestrogen resistant T47D breast cancer cells. For tamoxifen resistant T47D cells, combined treatment with dasatinib and fulvestrant was superior to treatment with dasatinib alone. Src located at the membrane has potential as a new biomarker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen. PMID\n\nInfluence of tangeretin on tamoxifen's therapeutic benefit in mammary cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nBracke, M E; Depypere, H T; Boterberg, T; Van Marck, V L; Vennekens, K M; Vanluchene, E; Nuytinck, M; Serreyn, R; Mareel, M M\n\n1999-02-17\n\nTamoxifen and the citrus flavonoid tangeretin exhibit similar inhibitory effects on the growth and invasive properties of human mammary cancer cells in vitro; furthermore, the two agents have displayed additive effects in vitro. In this study, we examined whether tangeretin would enhance tamoxifen's therapeutic benefit in vivo. Female nude mice (n = 80) were inoculated subcutaneously with human MCF-7/6 mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Groups of 20 mice were treated orally by adding the following substances to their drinking water: tamoxifen (3 x 10(-5) M), tangeretin (1 x 10(-4) M), tamoxifen plus tangeretin (3 x 10(-5) M plus 1 x 10(-4) M), or solvent. Oral treatment of mice with tamoxifen resulted in a statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with solvent treatment (two-sided P = .001). Treatment with tangeretin did not inhibit tumor growth, and addition of this compound to drinking water with tamoxifen completely neutralized tamoxifen's inhibitory effect. The median survival time of tumor-bearing mice treated with tamoxifen plus tangeretin was reduced in comparison with that of mice treated with tamoxifen alone (14 versus 56 weeks; two-sided P = .002). Tangeretin (1 x 10(-6) M or higher) inhibited the cytolytic effect of murine natural killer cells on MCF-7/6 cells in vitro, which may explain why tamoxifen-induced inhibition of tumor growth in mice is abolished when tangeretin is present in drinking water. We describe an in vivo model to study potential interference of dietary compounds, such as flavonoids, with tamoxifen, which could lead to reduced efficacy of adjuvant therapy. In our study, the tumor growth-inhibiting effect of oral tamoxifen was reversed upon addition of tangeretin to the diet. Our data argue against excessive consumption of tangeretin-added products and supplements by patients with mammary cancer during tamoxifen treatment.\n\nReducing aggressive intergroup action tendencies: effects of intergroup contact via perceived intergroup threat.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmid, Katharina; Hewstone, Miles; KÃ¼pper, Beate; Zick, Andreas; Tausch, Nicole\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTwo studies tested the prediction that more positive intergroup contact would be associated with reduced aggressive intergroup action tendencies, an effect predicted to occur indirectly via reduced intergroup threat perceptions, and over and above well-established effects of contact on intergroup attitudes. Study 1, using data based on a cross-section of the general population of eight European countries (France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and the UK; Nâ=â7,042), examined this hypothesis in the context of aggressive action tendencies towards immigrants. Study 2, using longitudinal data obtained from a general population sample in Northern Ireland, considered effects on aggressive action tendencies between ethno-religious groups in conflict. Both studies confirmed our predictions, showing that while perceived threat was associated with greater intergroup aggressive tendencies, positive intergroup contact was indirectly associated with reduced aggressive action tendencies, via reduced intergroup threat. Findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical contributions of this research for understanding the relationship between intergroup contact and intergroup aggression.

K.; Mackey, John R.; Godbout, Roseline; Curtis, Jonathan M.; McMullen, Todd P. W.; Brindley, David N.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTamoxifen is the accepted therapy for patients with estrogen receptor-Î± (ERÎ±)-positive breast cancer. However, clinical resistance to tamoxifen, as demonstrated by recurrence or progression on therapy, is frequent and precedes death from metastases. To improve breast cancer treatment it is vital to understand the mechanisms that result in tamoxifen resistance. This study shows that concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites, which accumulate in tumors of patients, killed both ERÎ±-positive and ERÎ±-negative breast cancer cells. This depended on oxidative damage and anti-oxidants rescued the cancer cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Breast cancer cells responded to tamoxifen-induced oxidation by increasing Nrf2 expression and subsequent activation of the anti-oxidant response element (ARE). This increased the transcription of anti-oxidant genes and multidrug resistance transporters. As a result, breast cancer cells are able to destroy or export toxic oxidation products leading to increased survival from tamoxifen-induced oxidative damage. These responses in cancer cells also occur in breast tumors of tamoxifen-treated mice. Additionally, high levels of expression of Nrf2, ABCC1, ABCC3 plus NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone-1 in breast tumors of patients at the time of diagnosis were prognostic of poor survival after tamoxifen therapy. Therefore, overcoming tamoxifen-induced activation of the ARE could increase the efficacy of tamoxifen in treating breast cancer.

However, ~ 30% of invasive breast cancers are hormone independent because they lack ER expression due to hypermethylation of ER promoter. Treatment of ER-negative breast cancer cells with demethylating agents [5-aza-2â²-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC)] and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (trichostatin A) leads to expression of ER mRNA and functional protein. Here, we examined whether epigenetically reactivated ER is a target for tamoxifen therapy. Following treatment with trichostatin A and 5-aza-dC, the formerly unresponsive ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells became responsive to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of cell growth in these cells is mediated at least in part by the tamoxifen-bound ER. Tamoxifen-bound reactivated ER induces transcriptional repression at estrogen-responsive genes by ordered recruitment of multiple distinct chromatin-modifying complexes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show recruitment of two different corepressor complexes to ER-responsive promoters in a mutually exclusive and sequential manner: the nuclear receptor corepressor-HDAC3 complex followed by nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex. The mechanistic insight provided by this study might help in designing therapeutic strategies directed toward epigenetic mechanisms in the prevention or treatment of breast cancer.

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of tamoxifen in myocardial infarction. For this, tamoxifen was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats for 1-14 days, and isoproterenol (ISO) (100 mgÂ·(kg body mass)(-1)Â·day(-1)) was administered subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days of the study in order to induce myocardial infarction, after which, various biochemical, cardiac, and morphometric parameters were evaluated. ISO produced significant dyslipidemia, hypertension, bradycardia, oxidative stress, and an increase in serum cardiac markers. Treatment with tamoxifen significantly controlled dyslipidemia, hypertension, bradycardia, oxidative stress, and reduced serum cardiac markers. The ISO control rats exhibited significant increases in the infarct size of the left ventricle (LV), LV cavity area, cardiac and LV hypertrophic indices, LV-wall thickness, cardiomyocyte diameter, and area. Treatment with tamoxifen significantly reduced infarction as well as hypertrophic and morphometric parameters. ISO also produced significant increases in the LV collagen level, decreases in Na(+)K(+) ATPase activity, and a reduction in the rate of pressure development and decay, which were prevented by tamoxifen treatment. The protective effect of tamoxifen on myocardial infarct was further confirmed by histopathological examination. Our data thus suggest that tamoxifen exerts beneficial effects in ISO-induced myocardial infarction.\n\nCrystalline maculopathy: a rare complication of tamoxifen therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrikantia, Nirmala; Mukesh, S; Krishnaswamy, Malavika\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator widely used in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer. Tamoxifen-induced ocular complications are very rare. A post-menopausal woman, diagnosed and treated case of carcinoma of left breast, on follow-up presented with history of gradual diminution of vision in both eyes of 3 months duration. Patient was on tamoxifen therapy 20 mg daily for the last 2 years. Fundus examination showed crystalline maculopathy. Fluorescein angiography, ocular coherence tomography confirmed the diagnosis. Tamoxifen therapy was discontinued. Although ocular toxicity is rare, careful evaluation of patients with visual symptoms on tamoxifen therapy is required.\n\nAMPK activation and metabolic reprogramming by tamoxifen through estrogen receptor-independent mechanisms suggests new uses for this therapeutic modality in cancer treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDaurio, Natalie A.; Tuttle, Stephen W.; Worth, Andrew J.; Song, Ethan Y.; Davis, Julianne M.; Snyder, Nathaniel W.; Blair, Ian A.; Koumenis, Constantinos\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTamoxifen is the most widely used adjuvant chemotherapeutic for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, yet a large body of clinical and preclinical data indicates that tamoxifen can modulate multiple cellular processes independently of ER status. Here, we describe the ER-independent effects of tamoxifen on tumor metabolism. Using combined pharmacological and genetic knockout approaches, we demonstrate that tamoxifen inhibits oxygen consumption via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, resulting in an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and activation of the AMPK signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. AMPK in turn promotes glycolysis, and alters fatty acid metabolism. We also show that tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity is modulated by isoform-specific effects of AMPK signaling, in which AMPKÎ±1 promotes cell death through inhibition of the mTOR pathway and translation. By using agents which concurrently target distinct adaptive responses to tamoxifen-mediated metabolic reprogramming, we demonstrate increased cytotoxicity through synergistic therapeutic approaches. Our results demonstrate novel metabolic perturbations by tamoxifen in tumor cells which can be exploited to expand the therapeutic potential of tamoxifen treatment beyond ER+ breast cancer.

Little is known about how tamoxifen affects this risk. We aimed to investigate whether tamoxifen treatment following breast cancer is associated with skin cancer. A cohort consisting of 44,589 women diagnosed with breast cancer during 1977-2007 from the nationwide clinical database of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, was followed for a primary skin cancer [basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or melanoma] in the Danish Cancer Registry supplemented by data on BCC and SCC from the Danish Pathology Register. We investigated incidence of skin cancer among 16,214 women treated with tamoxifen compared to 28,375 women not treated with tamoxifen by calculating incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in Cox regression models. Tamoxifen users were followed for a median of 2.9Â years. The median duration of tamoxifen treatment increased from around 1Â year among women diagnosed before 1999 to nearly 2.5Â years among women diagnosed in 1999 or later. Women treated with tamoxifen had an IRR 1.06 (95Â % CI 0.72-1.55) for SCC and an IRR 1.40 (95Â % CI 0.95-2.08) for melanoma when compared to non-users. The observed number of these types of cancer (37 SCCs and 38 melanomas among users) did not allow stratification on calendar-period. The overall IRR for BCC was 0.96 (95Â % CI 0.84-1.09), but the IRR differed by menopausal status and calendar-period at diagnosis of breast cancer. Our overall results indicate that tamoxifen is not associated with skin cancer. However, the inconsistency of results from stratifications prevents a firm conclusion.\n\nHot flashes are not predictive for serum concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Tamoxifen has dramatically reduced the recurrence and mortality rate of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. However, the efficacy of tamoxifen varies between individuals and 40% of patients will have a recurrence despite adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Factors that predict tamoxifen efficacy would be helpful for optimizing treatment. Serum concentrations of the active metabolite, endoxifen, may be positively related to treatment outcome. In addition, hot flashes are suggested to be positively associated with tamoxifen treatment outcome. Methods We investigated in a series of 109 patients whether the frequency and severity of hot flashes were related to concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites. A serum sample of all patients was analyzed for the concentration of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, as well as for estradiol concentrations and several single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2D6. Additionally, these patients completed a questionnaire concerning biometric data and treatment side effects. Results We found no evidence supporting an association between concentrations of tamoxifen or metabolites and either the frequency or severity of hot flashes in the covariate unadjusted analyses. However, including interactions with menopausal status and pre-treatment hot flash (PTHF) history indicated that post-menopausal women with PTHF experienced an increasing frequency of hot flashes with increasing serum concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites. This finding was not altered when adjusting for potential confounding factors (duration of tamoxifen treatment, CYP2D6 phenotype, estradiol serum concentration, age and body mass index). In addition we observed a positive association between body mass index and both hot flash frequency (p =â0.04) and severity (pâ<â0.0001). We also observed that patients with lower estradiol levels reported more severe hot flashes (p =â0.02).

However, the etiology and pathogenesis of MGH remain unclear, and the safety and efficacy of current western drug therapy for MGH still need to be improved. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted by our team to determine whether a TCM formula named Ru-Pi-Xiao in combination with tamoxifen or Ru-Pi-Xiao treated alone can show more prominent therapeutic effects against MGH with fewer adverse reactions than that of tamoxifen. Studies published before June 2017 were searched based on standardized searching rules in several mainstream medical databases. A total of 27 articles with 4,368 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the combination of Ru-Pi-Xiao and tamoxifen could exhibit better therapeutic effects against MGH than that of tamoxifen (OR: 3.79; 95% CI: 3.09â4.65; P < 0.00001) with a lower incidence of adverse reactions (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.28â0.43; P < 0.00001). The results also suggested that this combination could improve the level of progesterone (MD: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.72â2.71; P < 0.00001) and decrease the size of breast lump (MD: â0.67; 95% CI: â0.86 to â0.49; P < 0.00001) to a greater extent, which might provide a possible explanation for the pharmacodynamic mechanism of Ru-Pi-Xiao plus tamoxifen. In conclusion, Ru-Pi-Xiao and related preparations could be recommended as auxiliary therapy combined tamoxifen for the treatment of MGH.

Discovery of new antiparasitic drugs has been recently aimed to restrain differentiation and establishment of the T. solium adult tapeworm, for being considered a central node in the disease propagation to both pigs and humans. Tamoxifen is an antiestrogenic drug with cysticidal action on Taenia crassiceps, a close relative of T. solium. Thus, we evaluated the effect of tamoxifen on the in vitro evagination and the in vivo establishment of T. solium. In vitro, tamoxifen inhibited evagination of T. solium cysticerci in a dose-time dependent manner. In vivo, administration of tamoxifen to hamsters decreased the intestinal establishment of the parasite by 70%, while recovered tapeworms showed an 80% reduction in length, appearing as scolices without strobilar development. Since tamoxifen did not show any significant effect on the proliferation of antigen-specific immune cells, intestinal inflammation, and expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines in spleen and duodenum, this drug could exert its antiparasite actions by having direct detrimental effects upon the adult tapeworm. These results demonstrate that tamoxifen exhibits a strong cysticidal and antitaeniasic effect on T. solium that should be further explored in humans and livestock.\n\nIntraepithelial G3 adenocarcinoma of the endometrium after tamoxifen treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarchesoni, Diego; Driul, L; Mozzanega, B; Nardelli, G B; Parenti, A\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn this paper we describe a case of endometrial carcinoma observed in a post-menopausal patient who was treated with tamoxifen for 5 years after a mastectomy for cancer. She came to our department because of vaginal bleeding 2 years after the end of tamoxifen treatment. She underwent hysteroscopy and a D and C. A polypoid endometrium completely filled the uterine cavity and was carefully removed by curettage; histology showed a highly undifferentiated neoplasia with a component of serous adenocarcinoma, which was likely to originate from endometrial polyps. The patient underwent radical hysterectomy, but no residual tumor was found in the uterus or in the tubes, ovary, or pelvic nodes, in spite of its low differentiation grade and high potential aggressiveness, and even though the patient was already symptomatic. Two years after surgery the patient is disease free, which is consistent with the evaluation of the surgical specimen, but unusual in poorly differentiated neoplasms.\n\nOmega-3 free fatty acids inhibit tamoxifen-induced cell apoptosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Shufan; Guo, Yang; Wu, Yikuan; Zhu, Shenglong; He, Zhao; Chen, Yong Q\n\n2015-04-03\n\nFish oil, which contains omega-3 fatty acids mainly in the form of triglycerides, has benefits for reducing breast cancer risk, similar to tamoxifen action. However, it remains to be elucidated whether the combination of omega-3 free fatty acid (Ï-3FFA) with tamoxifen leads to improved treatment in breast cancer. In this study, we observed that Ï-3FFA induces MCF-7 cell apoptosis to suppress cell growth. The treatment of breast cancer cells with Ï-3FFA attenuated tamoxifen-induced cell apoptosis. Ï-3FFA and tamoxifen significantly increased Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation levels in a dose and time dependent manner. Compared to Ï-3FFA alone, the combination of tamoxifen with Ï-3FFA significantly increased Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation levels. Because Erk1/2 and Akt activation has been linked to tamoxifen-related anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer patients, these results indicate that Ï-3FFA may interfere with the effects of tamoxifen in the prevention of breast cancer risk.

The present study examined the protective properties of tamoxifen in male mice on several nigrostriatal dopaminergic markers and body temperature. Intact male mice were administered 12.5 or 50 microg tamoxifen 24 h before methamphetamine treatment. Basal body temperatures of male mice remained unchanged by the tamoxifen treatment. Methamphetamine reduced striatal dopamine and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid concentrations, striatal and substantia nigra dopamine and vesicular monoamine transporter specific binding as well substantia nigra dopamine and vesicular monoamine transporter mRNA levels and increased striatal preproenkephalin mRNA levels. These methamphetamine effects were not altered by 12.5 microg tamoxifen except for increased striatal dopamine metabolites and turnover. Tamoxifen at 50 microg reduced the methamphetamine effect on striatal dopamine concentration, dopamine transporter specific binding and prevented the increase in preproenkephalin mRNA levels; in the substantia nigra tamoxifen prevented the decrease of dopamine transporter mRNA levels. The present results show a tamoxifen dose-dependent prevention of loss of various dopaminergic markers against methamphetamine-induced toxicity in male mice. Since this is the only known hormonal protection of male mice against methamphetamine toxicity, these findings provide important new information on specific parameters of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function preserved by tamoxifen.\n\nUridine prevents tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Tamoxifen, an agonist of estrogen receptor, is widely prescribed for the prevention and long-term treatment of breast cancer. A side effect of tamoxifen is fatty liver, which increases the risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Prevention of tamoxifen-induced fatty liver has the potential to improve the safety of long-term tamoxifen usage. Methods Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside with reported protective effects against drug-induced fatty liver, was co-administered with tamoxifen in C57BL/6J mice.

However, in 20-30% of these cases, tamoxifen therapy fails due to an existing or developing resistance. The prediction of tamoxifen resistance by appropriate biomarker analysis and the development of novel therapies for tamoxifen resistance in premenopausal breast cancer is, therefore, an important goal of ongoing research. Tamoxifen resistance is associated with altered estrogen receptor expression especially on the plasma membrane, including the alternative G-protein coupled receptor GPR-30 (GPER) and estrogen receptor splice products, such as ERÎ±36. Tamoxifen resistant cells often use alternative pathways to promote proliferation in the absence of genomic estrogen signaling. These pathways involve the epidermal growth factor EGF, the inflammation associated transcription factor NF-ÎºB- and the IGF-1 pathway. Tamoxifen resistant mamma carcinoma cell lines are useful models to understand tamoxifen resistance in-vitro and to search for prognostic or predictive biomarkers. Furthermore, such cell lines can be used to identify potential targets for therapy. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Changes in mammographic density after tamoxifen discontinuation were assessed qualitatively (decrease, no change, or increase) by two readers and measured quantitatively by semi-automated software. The association between % density change and clinicopathological factors was evaluated using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. After tamoxifen discontinuation, a mammographic density increase was observed in 31.9% (68/213, reader 1) to 22.1% (47/213, reader 2) by qualitative assessment, with a mean density increase of 1.8% by quantitative assessment compared to density before tamoxifen discontinuation. In multivariate analysis, younger age (â¤ 39 years) and greater % density decline after tamoxifen treatment (â¥ 17.0%) were independent factors associated with density change after tamoxifen discontinuation (p < .001 and p = .003, respectively). Tamoxifen discontinuation was associated with mammographic density change with a mean density increase of 1.8%, which was associated with younger age and greater density change after tamoxifen treatment. â¢ Increased mammographic density after tamoxifen discontinuation can occur in premenopausal women. â¢ Mean density increase after tamoxifen discontinuation was 1.8%. â¢ Density increase is associated with age and density decrease after tamoxifen.\n\nSteeling Ourselves: Intragroup Communication while Anticipating Intergroup Contact Evokes Defensive Intergroup Perceptions.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreijdanus, Hedy; Postmes, Tom; Gordijn, Ernestine H; van Zomeren, Martijn\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTwo experiments investigated the role of intragroup communication in intergroup conflict (de-)escalation. Experiment 1 examined the effects of intragroup communication (vs. individual thought) and anticipated face-to-face intergroup contact (vs. no anticipated face-to-face intergroup contact). The group discussions of stigmatized group members who anticipated face-to-face intergroup contact revolved more around intergroup hostility. This boosted ingroup identification and increased social creativity but also led to steeling (a hardening of perceived intergroup relations). In Experiment 2, new participants listened to the taped group discussions. The discussions of groups anticipating face-to-face intergroup contact evoked more intergroup anxiety-related discomfort than discussions of groups not anticipating face-to-face intergroup encounters. Together, these results support the idea that steeling is a defensive reaction to prepare for an anxiety-arousing intergroup confrontation. Although steeling is also associated with positive consequences such as increased ingroup solidarity and social creativity, this hardened stance may be an obstacle to conflict de-escalation.\n\nSteeling Ourselves: Intragroup Communication while Anticipating Intergroup Contact Evokes Defensive Intergroup Perceptions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGreijdanus, Hedy; Postmes, Tom; Gordijn, Ernestine H.; van Zomeren, Martijn\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTwo experiments investigated the role of intragroup communication in intergroup conflict (de-)escalation.

Tamoxifen is a PKC inhibitor. Despite these, reports on effect of tamoxifen on cardiac hypertrophy are not available. Hence, we have investigated effect of tamoxifen (2mg/kg/day, po) on CH. In isoproterenol (ISO) induced CH, ISO (5mg/kg/day, ip) was administered for 10 days in Wistar rats. For partial abdominal aortic constriction (PAAC), abdominal aorta was ligated by 4-0 silk thread around 7.0mm diameter blunt needle. Then the needle was removed to leave the aorta partially constricted for 30 days. Tamoxifen was given for 10 days and 30 days, respectively, in ISO and PAAC models and at end of each studies, animals were sacrificed and biochemical and cardiac parameters were evaluated. ISO and PAAC produced significant dyslipidemia, hypertension, bradycardia, oxidative stress and increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-MB, C-reactive protein. Treatment with tamoxifen significantly controlled dyslipidemia, hypertension, bradycardia, oxidative stress and reduced serum cardiac markers. ISO control and PAAC control rats exhibited significantly increased cardiac and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophic index, LV thickness, cardiomyocyte diameter. Treatment with tamoxifen significantly reduced these hypertrophic indices. There was a significant increase in LV collagen level, decrease in Na(+)K(+)ATPase activity, and reduction in the rate of pressure development and decay. Tamoxifen significantly reduced LV collagen, increased Na(+)K(+)ATPase activity and improved hemodynamic function. This was further supported by histopathological studies, in which tamoxifen showed marked decrease in fibrosis and increase in extracellular spaces in the treated animals. Our data suggest that tamoxifen produces beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy and hence may be considered as a preventive measure for cardiac hypertrophy.

The proliferation of high-grade gliomas might be partly dependent on protein kinase C-mediated pathways. Tamoxifen has been shown in vitro to inhibit protein kinase C through estrogen receptor-independent antineoplastic effects. This Phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of tamoxifen when given with temozolomide and concurrent RT to patients with high-grade gliomas. Methods and Materials: A total of 17 consecutive patients in four cohorts with World Health Organization Grade 3 (n = 2) and 4 (n = 15) gliomas were givenmoreÂ Â» tamoxifen twice daily during 6 weeks of concurrent RT and temozolomide. Eligibility included histologic diagnosis, age >18 years old, Karnofsky performance status {>=}60, and no previous brain RT or chemotherapy. The starting dose was 50 mg/m{sup 2} divided twice daily. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in 3 patients, the dose was escalated in 25-mg/m{sup 2} increments until the MTD was reached. When {>=}2 patients within a cohort experienced a DLT, the MTD had been exceeded. Temozolomide was given with RT at 75 mg/m{sup 2}. A dose of 60 Gy in 2 Gy/d fractions to a partial brain field was delivered. Results: A total of 6 patients in Cohort 4 had received tamoxifen at 125 mg/m{sup 2}. One patient was excluded, and the fourth patient developed Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (DLT). Thus, 3 more patients needed to be enrolled. A deep venous thrombosis (DLT) occurred in the sixth patient. Thus, the MTD was 100 mg/m{sup 2}. Conclusions: The MTD of tamoxifen was 100 mg/m{sup 2} when given concurrently with temozolomide 75 mg/m{sup 2} and RT. Tamoxifen might have a role in the initial treatment of high-grade gliomas and should be studied in future Phase II trials building on the newly established platform of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Â«Â less\n\nCSC-3436 switched tamoxifen-induced autophagy to apoptosis through the inhibition of AMPK/mTOR pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Sheng-Tang; Sun, Guang-Huan; Cha, Tai-Lung; Kao, Chien-Chang; Chang, Sun-Yran; Kuo, Sheng-Chu; Way, Tzong-Der\n\n2016-08-15\n\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks specific therapeutic target and limits to chemotherapy and is essential to develop novel therapeutic regimens. Increasing studies indicated that tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), has anti-tumor therapeutic effect in estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±)-negative tumor. Here, we determined whether autophagy was activated by tamoxifen in TNBC cells. Moreover, CSC-3436 displayed strong and selective growth inhibition on cancer cells. Next, we investigated the anti-proliferation effect of combination of CSC-3436 plus tamoxifen on cell death in TNBC cells. Our study found that tamoxifen induces autophagy in TNBC cells. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and AMPK/mTOR contributed tamoxifen-induced autophagy. Interestingly, in combination treatment with CSC-3436 enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of tamoxifen. We found that CSC-3436 switched tamoxifen-induced autophagy to apoptosis via cleavage of ATG-5. Moreover, AMPK/mTOR pathway may involve in CSC-3436 switched tamoxifen-induced autophagy to apoptosis. The combination of tamoxifen and CSC-3436 produced stronger tumor growth inhibition compared with CSC-3436 or tamoxifen alone treatments in vivo. These data indicated that CSC-3436 combined with tamoxifen may be a potential approach for treatment TNBC.\n\nTumor characteristics and survival outcomes of women with tamoxifen-related uterine carcinosarcoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsuo, Koji; Ross, Malcolm S; Bush, Stephen H; Yunokawa, Mayu; Blake, Erin A; Takano, Tadao; Ueda, Yutaka; Baba, Tsukasa; Satoh, Shinya; Shida, Masako; Ikeda, Yuji; Adachi, Sosuke; Yokoyama, Takuhei; Takekuma, Munetaka; Takeuchi, Satoshi; Nishimura, Masato; Iwasaki, Keita; Yanai, Shiori; Klobocista, Merieme M; Johnson, Marian S; Machida, Hiroko; Hasegawa, Kosei; Miyake, Takahito M; Nagano, Tadayoshi; Pejovic, Tanja; Shahzad, Mian Mk; Im, Dwight D; Omatsu, Kohei; Ueland, Frederick R; Kelley, Joseph L; Roman, Lynda D\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTo examine tumor characteristics and survival outcome of women with uterine carcinosarcoma who had a history of tamoxifen use. This is a multicenter retrospective study examining stage I-IV uterine carcinosarcoma cases based on history of tamoxifen use. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment pattern, and survival outcomes were compared between tamoxifen users and non-users. Sixty-six cases of tamoxifen-related uterine carcinosarcoma were compared to 1009 cases with no history of tamoxifen use. Tamoxifen users were more likely to be older (mean age, 69 versus 64, P<0.001) and had a past history of malignancy (100% versus 12.7%, P<0.001). Tamoxifen-related uterine carcinosarcoma was significantly associated with a higher proportion of stage IA disease (48.4% versus 29.9%) and a lower risk of stage IVB disease (7.8% versus 16.0%) compared to tamoxifen-unrelated carcinosarcoma (P=0.034). Deep myometrial tumor invasion was less common in uterine carcinosarcoma related to tamoxifen use (28.3% versus 48.8%, P=0.002). On univariate analysis, tamoxifen use was not associated with progression-free survival (5-year rates 44.5% versus 46.8%, P=0.48) and disease-specific survival (64.0% versus 59.1%, P=0.39). After adjusting for age, past history of malignancy, stage, residual disease status at surgery, and postoperative treatment patterns, tamoxifen use was not associated with progression-free survival (adjusted-hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.50, P=0.60) and disease-specific survival (adjusted-hazard ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 1.29, P=0.24). Our study suggests that tamoxifen-related uterine carcinosarcoma may have favorable tumor characteristics but have comparable stage-specific survival outcomes compared to tamoxifen-unrelated uterine carcinosarcoma.

However, â¼50% of ERÎ±-positive tumors exhibit intrinsic or rapidly acquire resistance to endocrine treatment. Unfortunately, prediction of de novo resistance to endocrine therapy and/or assessment of relapse likelihood remain difficult. While several mechanisms regulating the acquisition and the maintenance of endocrine resistance have been reported, there are several aspects of this phenomenon that need to be further elucidated. Altered metabolic fate of tamoxifen within patients and emergence of tamoxifen-resistant clones, driven by evolution of the disease phenotype during treatment, appear as the most compelling hypotheses so far. In addition, tamoxifen was reported to induce pluripotency in breast cancer cell lines, in vitro. In this context, we have performed a whole transcriptome analysis of an ERÎ±-positive (T47D) and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), exposed to tamoxifen for a short time frame (hours), in order to identify how early pluripotency-related effects of tamoxifen may occur. Our ultimate goal was to identify whether the transcriptional actions of tamoxifen related to induction of pluripotency are mediated through specific ER-dependent or independent mechanisms. We report that even as early as 3 hours after the exposure of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen, a subset of ERÎ±-dependent genes associated with developmental processes and pluripotency are induced and this is accompanied by specific phenotypic changes (expression of pluripotency-related proteins). Furthermore we report an association between the increased expression of pluripotency-related genes in ERÎ±-positive breast cancer tissues samples and disease relapse after tamoxifen therapy. Finally we describe that in a small group of ERÎ±-positive breast cancer patients, with disease relapse after surgery and tamoxifen treatment, ALDH\n\n(Bad) Feelings about Meeting Them? Episodic and Chronic Intergroup Emotions Associated with Positive and Negative Intergroup Contact As Predictors of Intergroup Behavior\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKauff, Mathias; Asbrock, Frank; Wagner, Ulrich; Pettigrew, Thomas F.; Hewstone, Miles; SchÃ¤fer, Sarina J.; Christ, Oliver\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBased on two cross-sectional probability samples (Study 1: N = 1,382, Study 2: N = 1,587), we studied the interplay between positive and negative intergroup contact, different types of intergroup emotions (i.e., episodic intergroup emotions encountered during contact and more general chronic intergroup emotions), and outgroup behavior in the context of intergroup relations between non-immigrant Germans and foreigners living in Germany. In Study 1, we showed that positive and negative contact are related to specific episodic intergroup emotions (i.e., anger, fear and happiness). Results of Study 2 indicate an indirect effect of episodic intergroup emotions encountered during contact experiences on specific behavioral tendencies directed at outgroup members via more chronic situation-independent intergroup emotions. As expected, anger predicted approaching (discriminatory) behavioral tendencies (i.e., aggression) while fear predicted avoidance. The results extend the existing literature on intergroup contact and emotions by addressing positive and negative contact simultaneously and differentiating between situation-specific episodic and chronic intergroup emotions in predicting discriminatory behavioral tendencies.

Patients received exemestane or tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of treatment. Bone turnover markers were also measured. Patients receiving tamoxifen showed a mean increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD of 1.2% at month 12 and 0.2% at month 24. Patients receiving exemestane showed a mean decrease from baseline of 2.6% after 12 months and 3.5% after 24 months. There were significant differences in the changes in lumbar spine BMD between treatment groups (P < 0.0001 at both time points). Changes in BMD from baseline at the total hip were also significantly different between exemestane and tamoxifen (P < 0.05 at both time points). Bone turnover markers decreased from baseline with tamoxifen and increased with exemestane. Exemestane resulted in decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers. BMD increased and bone turnover markers decreased with tamoxifen.\n\nEstrogen receptor (ESR1) mRNA expression and benefit from tamoxifen in the treatment and prevention of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Chungyeul; Tang, Gong; Pogue-Geile, Katherine L; Costantino, Joseph P; Baehner, Frederick L; Baker, Joffre; Cronin, Maureen T; Watson, Drew; Shak, Steven; Bohn, Olga L; Fumagalli, Debora; Taniyama, Yusuke; Lee, Ahwon; Reilly, Megan L; Vogel, Victor G; McCaskill-Stevens, Worta; Ford, Leslie G; Geyer, Charles E; Wickerham, D Lawrence; Wolmark, Norman; Paik, Soonmyung\n\n2011-11-01\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain tamoxifen resistance of estrogen receptor (ER) -positive tumors, but a clinically useful explanation for such resistance has not been described. Because the ER is the treatment target for tamoxifen, a linear association between ER expression levels and the degree of benefit from tamoxifen might be expected. However, such an association has never been demonstrated with conventional clinical ER assays, and the ER is currently used clinically as a dichotomous marker. We used gene expression profiling and ER protein assays to help elucidate molecular mechanism(s) responsible for tamoxifen resistance in breast tumors. We performed gene expression profiling of paraffin-embedded tumors from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials that tested the worth of tamoxifen as an adjuvant systemic therapy (B-14) and as a preventive agent (P-1). This was a retrospective subset analysis based on available materials. In B-14, ESR1 was the strongest linear predictor of tamoxifen benefit among 16 genes examined, including PGR and ERBB2. On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that, in the P-1 trial, a lower level of ESR1 mRNA in the tamoxifen arm was the main difference between the two study arms. Only ESR1 was downregulated by more than two-fold in ER-positive cancer events in the tamoxifen arm (P < .001). Tamoxifen did not prevent ER-positive tumors with low levels of ESR1 expression. These data suggest that low-level expression of ESR1 is a determinant of tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer. Strategies should be developed to identify, treat, and prevent such tumors.\n\nLong-Term Data from 20 Trials Confirm Tamoxifen's Long-Lasting Benefit\n\nCancer.gov\n\nWomen with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who received about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen had a lower risk of recurrence in the 15 years after treatment than women who did not receive tamoxifen.\n\nAdjuvant tamoxifen influences the lipid profile in breast cancer patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Che; Chen, Li-Sheng; Kuo, Shou-Jen; Chen, Dar-Ren\n\n2014-02-01\n\nCurrently there is a debate regarding whether tamoxifen used in breast cancer has an impact on lipid profiles. The aim of this study was to determine whether tamoxifen has an impact on the serum lipid profile in Taiwanese women. Data of 109 patients were collected from the routine clinical follow-up for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were treated between July 2005 and March 2008. These patients were divided into 2 subgroups, based on their tumor grade and lymph node status. Subgroup 1 patients had tumor grade I/II and a negative lymph node status. Those patients with tumor grade III or a positive lymph node status were defined as subgroup 2. In the 109 patients, the mean serum total cholesterol (TC) levels after tamoxifen treatment, as well as the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, were lower than the baseline levels, with statistically significant differences. Treatment with tamoxifen lowered the serum TC and LDL-C levels in both subgroups. The results indicate that tamoxifen has an impact on the serum lipid profile of breast cancer patients in Taiwan. Physicians should follow up the lipid profile in these patients.\n\nProteomics of xenografted human breast cancer indicates novel targets related to tamoxifen resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nBesada, Vladimir; Diaz, Maylin; Becker, Michael; Ramos, Yassel; Castellanos-Serra, Lila; Fichtner, Iduna\n\n2006-02-01\n\nTamoxifen is the most frequently used drug for hormone therapy of breast cancer patients, even though a high percentage of women are (or become) refractory to this treatment. The proteins involved in tamoxifen resistance of breast tumor cells as well as the mechanisms by which they interact, are still unknown. Some years ago, we established the xenograft breast tumor 3366, sensitive to tamoxifen and the 3366/TAM, resistant to tamoxifen, derived after two years of in vivo passages of the parental 3366 under tamoxifen treatment. Here, we compare the protein expression levels of both xenografts. 2-DE of proteins from total cell extracts showed very high reproducibility among tumors from each group (tamoxifen sensitive and tamoxifen resistant). The heuristic clustering analysis of these gels pooled them correctly in both groups. Twelve proteins were found up-regulated in the tamoxifen-resistant line, while nine were down-regulated. The proteins differentially expressed were identified by MS and sequence database analysis. Biological functions of these proteins are related to cell-cell adhesion and interaction, signal transduction, DNA and protein synthesis machinery, mitochondrial respiratory chain, oxidative stress processes and apoptosis. Three of the identified proteins (ALG-2 interacting protein and two GDP-dissociation inhibitors) could be directly involved in the resistance phenomenon.\n\nTamoxifen enhances choline acetyltransferase mRNA expression in rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcMillan, Pamela J; LeMaster, Ann M; Dorsa, Daniel M\n\n2002-06-30\n\nNovel estrogen-like molecules known as SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators) produce many of the beneficial estrogen-like actions without the detrimental side-effects. The SERM, tamoxifen, an estrogen-like molecule with both agonist and antagonist properties, is widely prescribed for the treatment of breast cancer. While the effects of tamoxifen are being evaluated in many peripheral tissues, its effects in the central nervous system (CNS) have been largely ignored. In the present study, we begin to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen in the rat basal forebrain, a region known to be highly responsive to estrogen. We compared the effects of short-term (24 h) tamoxifen treatment to that of estrogen on ChAT mRNA expression in cholinergic neurons. In addition, we examined the effect of tamoxifen in the presence and absence of estrogen. Our results indicate that tamoxifen enhances ChAT expression in a manner similar to that of estrogen in several basal forebrain regions. In contrast, tamoxifen exhibits antagonist properties with respect to estrogen-induction of progesterone receptor mRNA in the medial preoptic nucleus. These results indicate tamoxifen has estrogenic properties with respect to cholinergic neurons, suggesting a previously unidentified effect of this agent in the CNS.

Previous reports showed that tamoxifen is associated with proliferative endometrial lesions. We herein reported an unusual case of concurrent hyperplastic lesions in the uterine cavity and right ovary in a 45-year-old woman with tamoxifen therapy. Regular vaginal ultrasonography showed the progressive endometrial thickening and right ovary enlargement during the period of drug use. Both lesions in the uterine cavity and right ovary showed characteristics resembling that of MÃ¼llerian adenofibroma. There were also foci of endometriosis in her bilateral ovarian surfaces. We suggest that women taking tamoxifen with a known history of endometriosis should be followed with transvaginal ultrasonography periodically.\n\nThe endometrium in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen.\n\nPubMed\n\nDallenbach-Hellweg, G; Schmidt, D; Hellberg, P; Bourne, T; Kreuzwieser, E; DÃ¶ren, M; Rydh, W; Rudenstam, G; Granberg, S\n\n2000-04-01\n\nWe restudied histologically and immunohistochemically 17 endometrial carcinomas, 2 malignant mixed tumors and 180 endometria with benign changes during or after tamoxifen therapy. The carcinomas were subtyped according to the 1994 WHO-classification. Endometrial biopsies were taken only if the endometrial thickness was > 8 mm sonographically, when a polyp was seen, or for postmenopausal bleeding. About half of the endometrial specimens showed simple or cystic atrophy, 55-76% had cystic-atrophic polyps or regressive hyperplasia. Depending upon the dose of tamoxifen, 7-19% (30 mg) to 27-36% (20 mg) showed moderate glandular proliferation. 20-33% had foci of mucinous, clear cell or serous-papillary metaplasia. 68-70% revealed diffuse extensive fibrosis of the endometrial stroma. None of 11 patients biopsied before starting tamoxifen therapy had advanced endometrial glandular proliferation in the second endometrial biopsy after tamoxifen treatment. None of the 19 endometrial neoplasms after tamoxifen therapy was of the endometrioid type: 11 were mucinous adenocarcinomas, 4 clear cell carcinomas, 2 serous-papillary carcinomas, one carcinosarcoma and one malignant Mullerian mixed tumor. The reasons for discrepancies between suspicious sonograms and endometrial atrophy are discussed.\n\nA randomised, open-label, phase 2 study of the IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat (INCB024360) versus tamoxifen as therapy for biochemically recurrent (CA-125 relapse)-only epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nKristeleit, Rebecca; Davidenko, Irina; Shirinkin, Vadim; El-Khouly, Fatima; Bondarenko, Igor; Goodheart, Michael J; Gorbunova, Vera; Penning, Carol A; Shi, Jack G; Liu, Xiangdong; Newton, Robert C; Zhao, Yufan; Maleski, Janet; Leopold, Lance; Schilder, Russell J\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIndoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) is a key regulator of immune tolerance in ovarian cancer. This study investigated efficacy and safety of the IDO1 enzyme inhibitor epacadostat versus tamoxifen in patients with biochemical-only recurrence (CA-125 elevation) following complete remission after first-line chemotherapy for advanced epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. In this open-label, phase 2 study (NCT01685255), patients were randomised 1:1 to epacadostat 600mg or tamoxifen 20mg twice daily for successive 28-day cycles and stratified by time since completion of first-line chemotherapy to first CA-125 elevation (3 to <12 or â¥12months). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS; RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints included CA-125 response (Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup criteria), overall survival, safety, and tolerability. The study was terminated primarily due to slow accrual and lack of evidence of superiority. Median PFS was 3.75months for epacadostat (n=22) versus 5.56months for tamoxifen (n=20; HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.58-3.14]; P=0.54). Of evaluable patients, 1 (5.0%) epacadostat and 3 (15.8%) tamoxifen patients had confirmed CA-125 responses. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was fatigue (epacadostat, 36.4%; tamoxifen, 40.0%). Immune-related adverse events, observed with epacadostat only, were primarily rash (18.2%) and pruritus (9.1%). Epacadostat pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were consistent with its known mechanism of action. IDO1 expression was observed in 94% of archival tumour samples. This first report of immunotherapy evaluation in biochemical-only relapse ovarian cancer and of IDO1 inhibitor monotherapy in ovarian cancer found no significant difference in efficacy between epacadostat and tamoxifen. Epacadostat was generally well tolerated. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nHow Can Intergroup Interaction Be Bad If Intergroup Contact Is Good? Exploring and Reconciling an Apparent Paradox in the Science of Intergroup Relations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPage-Gould, Elizabeth\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe outcomes of social interactions among members of different groups (e.g., racial groups, political groups, sexual orientation groups) have long been of interest to psychologists. Two related literatures on the topic have emergedâthe intergroup interaction literature and the intergroup contact literatureâin which divergent conclusions have been reported. Intergroup interaction is typically found to have negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing heightened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have positive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and lower prejudice. We examine these paradoxical findings, proposing that researchers contributing to the two literatures are examining different levels of the same phenomenon and that methodological differences can account for the divide between the literatures. Further, we introduce a mathematical model by which the findings of the two literatures can be reconciled. We believe that adopting this model will streamline thinking in the field and will generate integrative new research in which investigators examine how a personâs experiences with diversity unfold.

The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of tamoxifen resistance and the impact of the new estrogen G-protein coupled receptor (GPR30). MCF-7 cells were continuously exposed to tamoxifen for 6 months to induce resistance to the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen. These tamoxifen-resistant cells (TAM-R) exhibited enhanced sensitivity to 17-ss-estradiol and GPR30 agonist, G1, when compared to the parental cells. In TAM-R cells, tamoxifen was able to stimulate the cell growth and MAPK phosphorylation. These effects were abolished by EGFR inhibitor AG1478, GPR30 anti-sense oligonucleotide, and the selective c-Src inhibitor PP2. Only EGFR basal expression was slightly elevated in the TAM-R cells, whereas GPR30 expression and the basal phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK remained unchanged when compared to the parental cells. Interestingly, estrogen treatment significantly increased GPR30 translocation to the cell surface, which was stronger in TAM-R cells. Continuous treatment of MCF-7 cells with GPR30 agonist G1 mimics the long-term treatment with tamoxifen and increases drastically its agonistic activity. This data suggests the important role of GPR30/EGFR receptor signaling in the development of tamoxifen resistance. The inhibition of this pathway is a valid option to improve anti-hormone response in breast cancer.\n\nEfficacy of tamoxifen and radiotherapy for prevention and treatment of gynaecomastia and breast pain caused by bicalutamide in prostate cancer: a randomised controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerdonÃ , Sisto; Autorino, Riccardo; De Placido,"
