        "text": "Just when Roma was enjoying a red-hot run, the early-season strugglers have been hit with some more adversity.\n\nAs if losing to Catania on Sunday wasn't bad enough, now Roma is facing the prospect of losing Francesco Totti for up to two month with a thigh injury. The injury could put a major crimp in the Romans' attempts to climb up the Serie A standings after starting the year off terribly.\n\nTotti could be forced to miss at least part of Roma's highly-anticipated Champions League showdown vs. Arsenal, which is facing its own potentially nightmarish injury news. Playmaker Cesc Fabregas suffered a knee injury in Sunday's tie vs. Liverpool. The full extent of the injury won't be known until Tuesday, but the Spanish star is expected to miss at least three weeks.\n\nHere are some other stories to get your day started:\n\nVidic facing Champions League ban\n\nLost in the wake of Manchester United's successful run through the FIFA Club World Cup, which culminated with a 1-0 victory against LDU Quito in the final, was the fact that star defender Nemanja Vidic just might wind up missing UEFA Champions League match following his red card in Sunday's final.\n\nVidic will, at the very least, miss Manchester United's first-leg Champions League match against Inter Milan, but could face up to a three-match European ban depending on how FIFA interprets his actions that led to the red card.\n\nAmerica de Cali crowned champions\n\nWhen Diego Alvarez scored the opening goal for Independiente Medellin in their Colombian championship match against America de Cali, the large crowd in Cali was suddenly quiet. That quiet didn't last long though as America rattled off three unanswered goals to post a 3-1 second-leg victory and 4-1 aggregate victory to secure its 13th Colombian championship.\n\nAmerica's Adrian Ramos gave the home side the series advantage back just eight minutes after Alvarez' goal, finishing off a beautiful long-range strike. A pair of second-half goals sealed Medellin's fate.\n\nThe championship ties America with Bogota-based Millionarios for most Colombian titles.\n\nWhat do you think of the above stories? Will Roma fade in the Serie A standings without Totti? Will losing Fabregas prove too much for Arsenal? Think Vidic deserves a full three-game ban for his elbow?\n\nShare your thoughts below."
