        "text": "Disability is not a 'health problem'; however some people with disabilities do have increased health needs, and all people with disabilities have the same right to access health services as others. The number of people living with disabilities is increasing, due partly to increasing numbers of people living with the consequences of chronic communicable and non-communicable diseases. Based on recommendations of the World Report on Disability, which provides the parameters for research, this paper sets out a research agenda calling for a considerable research programme on social, civil, and economic impacts of living with disability, arising from whatever cause, including communicable and non-communicable diseases; significant global health policy revisions; identification of constraints and facilitators in access to healthcare for people with disabilities; development of a robust evidence base for implementing the new guidelines on community-based rehabilitation; innovations in addressing human resource challenges faced by disability and rehabilitation service-providers; development of enabling technologies that focus on individuals' aspirations and social gain; preparedness for responding to the needs of people with disabilities in disaster situations; and the application of disability metrics to strengthen health systems.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank estimates of 2011, Persons with Disabilities institute at least 15%of the worldwide population. In the framework of the EAC area, this percentage would transform into at least 18 million persons with disabilities. However, there is possibilities for average percentage to be higher in Africa because of communal, ethnic and civil war induced disability. More extremely for Africa, people with disability tend to belong to the poorest strata in culture. It is projected that on average, less than 2% of People with Disability in Africa have access to primary school education and that there are no tangible prospects for rehabilitation. Taken an example applying the WHO recommended 10 per cent to today’s Kenyan population of approximately 36 million, would indicate that there may be some 3 million disabled people. The total number of people with disabilities in Africa lives in an economic predicament and constitute a large section of those who live below the poverty line and unable to afford basic amenities. It is obvious as poverty and disability are intertwined. Many disabled people in Africa, as in most developing countries in the world, live in poverty, have limited opportunities for accessing education, health, and suitable housing and employment opportunities (ILO 2009). Defining disability is a complex and controversial task because it is a multi-dimensional concept and its definition has strong cultural influences (Mattioli, 2008). Understanding disability can be deduced from three models. Disabilities is define as a term, ensconcing impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. Disability is a multifarious occurrence, showing an interface between features of a person’s body and that of society in which he or she lives. Technically, the correct word for disability is Impairment such as not being able to function naturally. Meanwhile, disability is the term used to define impairment of ability to perform a normal daily activities. There were different types of disabilities; physical disability, intellectual disability, developmental disability and nonvisible disabilities. The context of United Nations General Assembly in 1975 adopted a Declaration, which defined “disability” and conferred social, economic, civil and political rights on people with disability. Also, the UN has adopted numerous Declarations and Conventions regulations which uphold disability rights and protection of persons with disabilities against discrimination. This lead to international recognitions of the African Union framework that persons with disabilities have equal human, civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights.\n\nThere is a genuine and widespread lack of general understanding and policy awareness that most Persons with Disabilities (PWD) can, in fact, function effectively at work, school, and within society, if given required support. Legacies of the socialist system with its medical model of disability that believed that limitations arising from disability can potentially be prevented or managed by medical treatment of PWDs contributes to this. Therefore, it is no surprise that the medical model and charity ideology shaped these countries’motivation for special legislation, social and legal policies,corresponding programmes, and, social protection schemes.Access to services does not imply only physical services.Of course, globally, the overwhelming majority of buildings,including government institutions are not accessible to PWDs, which restricts their opportunities to exercise their rights in many areas. Multiple barriers still exist in access to employment, education, housing, health, political participation,cultural expression, entertainment, and leisure activities. Inaccessibility and prejudices in society make life difficult and prevent access to basic rights and services such as participating in political process, gaining access to justice, and engaging in meaningful economic and social activity.In fact, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)provides a unique normative framework and an effective legal tool for States to end this discrimination and violation of the rights of persons with disabilities – if it is implemented effectively and supported by policies and programmes to promote the active inclusion of this population. Easier said than done. The inclusion of persons with disabilities in development efforts is a question of humanrights, and the human-rights based approach is central in achieving an inclusive society,non-discrimination and to ensuring equity. It is NOT a matter of moral obligation anymore;it is our legal and developmental obligation. It is, therefore, important for all of us –individuals or institutions - to take effective steps to support the implementation of the CRPD. The constituent elements (national human rights institutions, CSOs, national agencies, judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, legislative bodies) of the national human rights systems in our respective countries have an active duty to take this up and mainstream disability issues, challenges, and, solutions into vision, strategic planning, annual work plans,budgeting and resource allocation. These are critical for achieving inclusive growth, internationally agreed development goals (i.e., Millennium Development Goals, Post-2015 Development-SDGs, Social Development Goals, etc.) and, most importantly, ensuring human dignity, human rights, social protectionand justice. In order to address such needs, existing knowledge, and capacity gaps, UNDP recently published this comprehensive Guide for both programming and advocacy. This book reflects the current research, international and regional experiences, good practices and lessons learned in ratifying the UNCRPD and its implementation. The Guide exemplifies well-coordinated sectoral policies and national programmes aligned with the CRPD."
