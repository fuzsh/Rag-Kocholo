        "text": "It's back to the weekly grind, no double matches this week, no bothersome international fixtures. Just plain old one game a week match ups. With the additional pains out of the way, fantasy managers can go back to risk and reward transfers. Keeping it simple is key but when you're playing catch up like many of us are, that risk is almost welcomed.\n\nThis week we feature a couple of players who haven't reached their full potential but are still very skilled and could give you the impact you seek to close out your regular season.\n\nBrad Davis ($9.0m), Houston Dynamo –\n\nBrad still is a popular player with over 15% ownership but at his price level there are plenty of players that are more sought after. At home this week the american international faces Chivas USA. Houston this year have been unpredictable but they still have highly skilled players. In the thick of the playoff picture and with only six games left, we anticipate that Davis could outperform many other midfielders in the final weeks this season.\n\nClaudio Bieler ($8.2m), Sporting Kansas City –\n\nReturning from injury last weekend saw Bieler come away with a goal and an assist. At $8.2m the forward has never been cheaper which makes him an attractive option and with just 6.5% ownership, he's a definite out of the box approach his week. Facing a struggling Toronto FC, Kansas has everything to play for being only three points back from top spot in the East. If he can score again in this heavily favored match up that owner's percentage is sure to go north fast.\n\nTeam of the week: New England Revolution\n\nNew England look poised for a solid outing this week with the lowest ranked team in the league visiting. The basement dwellers DC United just can't seem to find the back of the net and with only 18 goals this season, a clean sheet looks likely for the Revolution.\n\nKelyn Rowe ($5.8m) -\n\nThere's certain times in this game where an opportunity arises and you just can't pass it up. Mr. Rowe is a prime example, with 5 goals and 1 assist in 5 games, he's at the top of his game. At only $5.8m to not find a place for this player is a crime.\n\nChris Tierney ($4.9m) -\n\nIs our pick for the back line this week, but really you can't go wrong with anyone on this team given DC United's shortage of goals. We like the value he possesses providing a solid bang for your buck."
