Her poetry is translated into 40 languages.\n\nDESCRIPTION BY BORCHE PANOV, literary critic, poet, editor:\n\n\"In the poetry book \"House of Contrasts\" by Daniela Andonovska-Trajkovska somewhere at the beginning we can read that \"a tear without metaphysics has no aesthetics.\" This discourse completely determines the poetics of this very well-known and notorious Macedonian poetess. She is awake in each word and in this book, she creates her poetic alphabet by freezing the moment and by claiming that her alphabet was born on the knife with which the umbilical cord was cut. Although, she writes about things that are not so perfect or beautiful, such as the pain and the loss, she is always on the bright side by using the poem as the most subtle defense of life. At the same time, she stands in front of the vertical mirror of love and she confronts us with the naked truth by showing us the finest lines on our faces from which time rises like a wall between us and the world. She makes us to be aware that we live in a room of the autistic time, and even when insomnia speaks loudly, no one can hear the fractures of the day that assembles in us piece by piece like in an X-ray image, and no one can see our nakedness and our vulnerability. We hide behind the image that we show to the world wanting to be accepted and appreciated. In the poetry book \"House of Contrasts\" we see for a moment the world in which every night, humans made of paper return to the keyhole of their houses cursing the day that does not last long enough so they could find themselves. But that is precisely why the day in this book lasts long enough to see how the poetess Daniela Andonovska-Trajkovska shows us that the paramecium of the meaning develops into a multicellular organism breathing with human lungs in the chest of the readers.\"\n\nDESCRIPTION BY SLAVICA GADZOVA SVIDERSKA, PhD, literary critic, poetess, editor, publisher:\n\n\"The poetry of Daniela Andonovska-Trajkovska is powerful and striking example of Écriture feminine, which is essentially atypical and non-classical, because the prism of this author goes beyond the classical framework of the so-called writing from the womb. Searching for the perfect and most appropriate way of expressing her view and thinking about the world, the author playfully moves between the forms and ways of poetic expression: from short elliptical poems reduced to simple but semantically layered poetic images, through lyrical poems that are thought provoking, to poems where the verse hybridizes with the narrative tone. At the beginning, the lyrical subject searches for itself (in the world, through the Other and in the Other, in the rational and the irrational, in the real and the oneiric), and the most appropriate form to express this search is the paradox. Furthermore, the search is an endless attempt to find harmony and balance amidst the noise of a world that is becoming increasingly chaotic, illogical, and sometimes nightmarishly phantasmagoric. At the end the search for the metaphysical vertical takes place, a search for the eternal, for the Absolute, for God. The decadence, the downward movement and the erosion of the values are constantly semantically emphasized: the images are broken, the words are crashed, the breathing is trapped, the woman is a doll with winded up steps, the face is a salt mosaic, ethics is \"Cain-ethics,\" that is, the world is \"on red alert.\" Nevertheless, the lyrical subject knows how to find meaning even in the era of meaninglessness, living its search for itself, for a perfect understanding with the Other, for a home without contrasts and for the Absolute. Andonovska-Trajkovska's poetry brings fresh and original voice that carries the archetypal one, thick semantics, explosions of meanings, feminine wisdom and aesthetics that ennoble the \"collapsing world\" so that it does not collapse. For that reason, the poetry book \"House of Contrasts\" deserves a special place in the contemporary world literature.â\n\n\"Daniela Andonovska-Trajkovska's poetry brings fresh and original voice that carries the archetypal one, thick semantics, explosions of meanings, feminine wisdom and aesthetics that ennoble the \"collapsing world\" so that it does not collapse. For that reason, the poetry book \"House of Contrasts\" deserves a special place in the contemporary world literature.\"\n\n—Slavica Gadzova Sviderska, PhD, literary critic, scholar, poetess, editor, publisher\n\n\"In \"House of Contrasts\" by Daniela Andonovska-Trajkovska the silence is not silent, but dramatical and loud. It seems that here is a compromise and an awareness that the antonymies are compatible contradictions like the day and the night, the sky and the earth, the angel and the devil, the cosmos and the chaos. Like ying and yang. Like life.\"\n\n—Jordan Stojanoski, PhD, literary critic, university professor of literature\n\nCover art: Ljupka Galazkava-silev\n\n$19.95 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-84-0 | 92 Pages\n\nBarbara E. Murphy's poetry has appeared or is forthcoming in journals including Green Mountains Review, Threepenny Review, Barrow Street, and New England Review. She is a recipient of a Vermont Arts Council Fellowship and twice-nominated for a Pushcart Prize. Murphy served as a faculty member at the New England Young Writers Conference and is a board member of Sundog Poetry. A collection of her poems, Almost Too Much was published by ČervenÁ Barva Press in 2015. Her essays and reviews have been published in several venues including The New York Times, Plume Poetry, Full Grown People, and Green Mountains Review. She lives and writes in Burlington Vermont.\n\nDescription:\n\nBarbara E. Murphy's compelling The Unfinished Family comes to terms with the notion that families can ever be \"finished.' The poems in this brave and provocative collection explore the impulses of duty and loyalty, love and fear and compulsion for perfection as the speaker comes to embrace the mistakes that are inevitable in every family. These poems are as honest as they are hopeful in their insistence that we return again and again to the messy work of being with our people and starting again.\n\nIn The Unfinished Family, Barbara Murphy offers a master class on the compressed narrative and the withheld detail. Whether she turns a discerning, critical eye on her birth-family—a troubled father, a mother born into \"the wrong era, wrong marriage, wrong life\"—or her own made family she brings a wealth of memorable phrases, smart insights, and emotional yearning as well as an empathetic eye and forgiving mind that \"lets a little light in too.\"\n\n—Neil Shepard, author of The Book of Failures\n\nPart of our human beauty is that we live in a state of being unfinished. This is why memory is so powerful. Barbara Murphy's exquisite, beautiful poems are a series of finely etched portraits that enact how our moments accumulate into meaning as they move toward another world we will never know yet help create. Muscular, lyric language and an agile form makes these powerful poems tap us on the shoulder and awaken us from our delirium and into the transcendent. Murphy's poems show us how personal history and time intersect leaving behind a memory that never vanishes. These poems claim life and life claims these poems. This book is a treasure.\n\n—Elizabeth A.I. Powell, author of Atomizer\n\nBarbara Murphy's The Unfinished Family is haunted by the archetypal ghost of a perfect family against which the speaker holds memories—brilliantly precise and unequivocally rendered—and finds them wanting. Yet, the honesty, bravery and fidelity with which she acknowledges her disappointments burnish these poems with love, humor and pathos. We should read her.\n\n—Nancy Mitchell, author of The Out of Body Shop\n\nPhoto: Karen Pike\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-92-5 | 58 Pages\n\nA fellow of the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, Mary Bonina was finalist for the Goldfarb Fellowship and awarded several residencies, including one at the VCCA retreat, Moulin a Nef, in Auvillar, France.

The poems highlight, as Patrick Sylvain, Professor of Global Studies, states in his introduction, \"the universal nature of human connection, understanding, and a sense of shared humanity in the face of cultural and linguistic differences\" Bonina sees her classes as offering survival skills, and compares her necessarily improvised lessons to the act of writing a poem, \"that familiar process of one word, one thought, leading to another, often unanticipated one, recognizing endless possibilities, and finally settling on the right one in a moment of revelation.\"\n\nIn this vivid, wonderfully empathetic book of poems, Lunch In Chinatown, Mary Bonina is an inquisitive seeker, not only set to teach English but also to learn about the lives of her immigrant students. Thereâs the student who worked with the very ill and the job did not allow wearing jewelry âwithout that ring on her finger/her hand felt too light, made her think/that she wasnât in the world anymore,â another puzzled over the same abbreviation for Saint and Street, a young man recalled his young love in Port au Prince. In her masterful telling Bonina has given us glimpses of their worlds, both before and after the immigration. These poems celebrate the common human language, of disappointments and loss, aspirations and love, and also how poetry and the resolve of students and their teacher can make all the difference in the world.\n\nâPui Ying Wong, author of Fanling in October\n\nIn Lunch in Chinatown \"Mary Bonina's eloquent verses breathe life into the seemingly mundane, turning lunchtime into an exploration of the extraordinary moments hidden within our daily routines.\"\n\nfrom the Introduction\n\nPatrick Sylvain, P.H.D., M.F.A\n\nAuthor, Unfinished Dreams/Rev San Bout (bilingual poetry)\n\nCover photo: Abbi Sauro\n\nAuthor photo: Christopher Collyn\n\n$16.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-88-8 | 27 Pages\n\nGary Metras was appointed the inaugural Poet Laureate of the City of Easthampton in 2018.

A master letterpress printer, he ran Adastra Press for forty years, publishing poets from all over the country.\n\nFrom Izmir, Turkey to Stonehenge, England, these are poems of adventure, revelation, and enlightenment. The history, mythology, and ruins of ancient Greece and Rome are newly experienced and newly interpreted for the modern reader. The lives and achievements of Francis d'Assisi, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Beethoven, John Keats, and Oscar Wilde are given new meaning, while a belly dancer, a butcher, a taxi driver, and a waiter and a waitress are elevated beyond their typically mundane jobs and lives. Join the author as he walks the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, rides a cable car up an Austrian alp, contemplates the paintings in the Sistine Chapel, a Christmas in Paris, lunches in the cafÃ© atop the Euromast in Rotterdam, and so much more.\n\nMarble Dust is like a travelogue in four parts. It is a paean of geography, actual, spiritual, historical, mythological as well as a special place in our collective hearts. From Greece to Italy and the rarified air and memories of mountains in Austria, Switzerland and the mysteries of Stonehenge. Marble Dust merges all these into a seamless literary tapestry. It also encompasses themes pertaining to art, artists, poets and architecture. This collection places the enraptured reader in the center of this journey as time bends backwards and forward. All places blend into the external and internal worlds. Poem after poem is replete with breathtaking imagery and proven mastery of the written word. Reading Marble Dust is a memorable, exhilarating and a highly recommended experience.\n\n—Harris Gardner, Poetry Editor, Ibbetson Street, author of No Time for Death\n\nCover photo: \"Ionic column capital, 5th-4th century BCE, the Acropolis, Athens.

The English versions of the poems are the author's work in collaboration with Marcus Silcock Slease. The author was born in Poland in 1962 and has lived in Copenhagen, Denmark, since 1985. Grzegorz Wróblewski is translated into many languages. The current book raises existential issues concerning the paradoxes of human functioning, loneliness and human isolation. The poetic works in this book are often minimalistic, devoid of the metaphorical structure typical of European lyric poetry. They may sometimes be associated with Zen poetry. The poems from the volume \"I REALLY LIKE LOVERS OF POETRY\" are also a criticism of the modern world full of consumerism. They try to draw the reader's attention to issues that are lost in a world full of ruthless materialism.\n\nPolish writer and visual artist Grzegorz Wróblewski has written I Really Like Lovers of Poetry directly in English with assistance of his friend and fellow writer Marcus Slease. A translation, a collaboration, certainly an experiment, it is above all a collection of mordant parables about humans — and occasionally nonhumans too. A moralist at heart, like Bertolt Brecht, Wróblewski demystifies and clarifies: \"Everyone is looking for the truth. / The only truth is the rumbling / of our stomachs.\"\n\n—Piotr Gwiazda, translator of Dear Beloved Humans: Selected Poems by Grzegorz WrÃ³blewski\n\nIn his latest book of poems, Grzegorz Wróblewski delivers what readers have always loved him for: his take on not just the personal, but the condition of human beings and all creatures (I would like to wake up someday/among people who respect both/wolves and pigs) in the often mysterious planet we live on. Sometimes the take is acerbic, sometimes the take has a dark absurdity to it, sometimes the take is full of genuine wit, sometimes the take has a forbearance of humanity that even surprises the poet, but at all times these poems ring true in their brilliance, even if a bit of hurt must be endured for posing those truths: Listen to the silence of heaven./You wonât understand any of it. But at least youâll be closer/to the silent clouds./Closer to where you got here/by a mistake. But there's no mistaking Wróblewski's poetic gifts and the lovely rigor of his challenging mind.\n\n—Tim Suermondt, author of A Doughnut And The Great Beauty Of The World\n\nCover art: \"50 x 50 The Boys from Amager II\" by Grzegorz Wróblewski\n\n$16.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-93-2 | 38 Pages\n\nBahloul (A.k.a Hussam Jefee-Bahloul) is a poet, musician and psychiatrist.

Death is everywhere—in the fields and forests, on darkened roads, in the delivery room—but there is also love, the kind that defies convention and outlasts death itself. These poems confront, without flinching, hard truths about what it means to be a woman, a mother, a wife, and a lover. Like \"the clink of brass bullets as they spill from your pockets in the spin cycle,\" there are images here that continue to resonate long after the page has been turned.\"\n\n—Sue Ellen Thompson, Winner of the Maryland Author Award and author of Sea Nettles: New & Selected Poems\n\n\"Amanda Newell's Postmortem Say is a collection of urgent and truthful self-revelations about marriage, motherhood, the life cycle of a love affair, all written within the maelstrom of our modern American violence. Blood is everywhere: the blood of birth, death, desire. Newell's language throughout is precise, viscerally arresting, yet always in touch with the pulse and breath of the vernacular. The poems whisper in the reader's ear of pain while providing the consolations of insight and compassion. For all the wounds suffered and remembered in Postmortem Say, this is a book that heals.\"\n\n—Dan O'Brien, author of Our Cancers and Survivor's Notebook\n\n\"The poems in Amanda Newell's Postmortem Say are distinguished by driving intensity and subtle expertise. Even as this poet comes to terms with violence, loss, and absence, she remains utterly precise in her attention to her subjects, and lionhearted in her refusal of easy answers.

Amanda Newell is a dynamo of poetry, and nothing can stop her.\"\n\n—Peter Campion, author of One Summer Evening at the Falls\n\nCover art: by Nancy Mitchell\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-82-6 | 57 Pages\n\nDaniel Lawless is the author most recently of The Gun My Sister Killed Herself With.

A recipient of a continuing Shifting Foundation grant, he is the founder and editor of Plume: A Journal of Contemporary Poetry, Plume Editions, and the annual Plume Poetry anthologies.\n\nDaniel Lawless' extraordinary new book I Tell You This Now dazzles with poetry's strange powerâ\"negative capability\"âthe courage to be vulnerable even in the moment of insight, to work at the threshold where the self ends and the street begins, to be the animal that knows it will die. It's an anarchic power that subverts all authority, including the speaker's. Adamant in their modesty, generosity, and ferocity, these poems can critique the absolutesâthe giving of names (\"Daniel\"), the arc of time (\"Sleek Green Car\"), emptiness itself (\"Ullage\"). Always these poems speak to the real, the loved, the broken. Always the work is haunted by the injustices we suffer and inflict in a world which is collapsing inwardsâ\"your dead father who is beautiful like Quang Duc setting himself aflame.\" Lawless' poems are wild, but search for a way to be responsible in a time of chaos. They live on the breath, but they bear the charge of a lifetime. Lawless is a visionary, a craftsman, and a terrific poet.\n\nâD. Nurkse\n\nWhen I read Daniel Lawless's poetry, I feel as if I am in the presence of an understated visionary. Deeply personal, his poems move on two levelsâ they are both in the world and looking down at it, as from above. They are poems of the ordinary and of a soul seeking redemption. They are poems of memory and suffering, longing as well as of celebration, insight and blessing. I am in awe of this poet and of this ingenious and luminous collection, I Tell You This Now.\n\nâNin Andrews\n\nThe poems in Daniel Lawless' I Tell You This Now evoke the photos of Diane Arbus in that they might make you want to turn away, but then only to turn back and go deeper, as he does, to find the humanity in this complex, difficult world. He mines photographs both real and imagined to create fresh, startling insights that sustain us, like the small daily joys of \"...lumbering the cha-cha as she boiled the green out of Thursday cabbage.\" The collection unspools in one long, magnificent section-nothing to slow down or stop the accumulating momentum of these brilliant flashes. They're like old flashbulbs that briefly blind us as they sear into our consciousness. Death and illness hover over this book, as they hover in our lives, even as we hurtle ourselves forward. As Lawless writes, \"how the dead live on/These scraps of memory we feed them like dogs./Always hungry, come-calling us by their name.\" There's a brilliant darkness to these poems that are full of light.\n\nâJim Daniels\n\nCover Art: Barn, Lake George (1936) by Alfred Stieglitz.

Among his lyric volumes are Slain Species (London, 1980), By the Way: Poems over the Years (1998), Greatest Hits (2000), and Canonicals: Love's Hours (2009). Middle-East Mezze (2011) focuses on a troubled yet enchanting part of our world, while The Countries We Live In (2014) explores inner and outer geographies. Unter der Sonne / Under the Sun (2022) features Radavich's German poems with English translations. Here's Plenty celebrates the sometimes searing yet ultimately redemptive richness of our planet and human experience.\n\nRadavich's plays, both serious and comic, have been performed across the U.S., including six Off-Off-Broadway, and in Europe. He has published scholarly and informal essays and presented in such far-flung locations as Canada, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Greece, and Iceland. He has served as president of the Thomas Wolfe Society, Charlotte Writersâ Club, and North Carolina Poetry Society and currently administers the Gilbert-Chappell Distinguished Poet Series.\n\nThe poems in David Radavich's Here's Plenty come in seamless variations of splendor. The whole shapes a music lyrical and beautiful as the morning rain.\n\nâShelby Stephenson, former Poet Laureate of North Carolina\n\nThe title of David Radavich's remarkable collection is apposite. Hereâs Plenty characterizes a broad panoply of states of mind and feeling that are in process of change, leaving alterations that may be new problems. Chaos is held in check only by means of will power, a duty to one's own humanity. \"Prometheus on the Crag\" shows Everyman as a figure whose duty is to suffer. Many poets are strong but few are tough in this necessary way. \"Be generous / in your hatred: // You never know / what youâll become.\"\n\nâFred Chappell, former Poet Laureate of North Carolina\n\nSometimes when we pick up a book of poems, we want it to feel like we are calling an old friend on the phone who understands and accepts us; Here's Plenty is that kind of book. From the opening lines of the first poem \"Sun Blanched,\" which turns out to be a poem about the acceptance of loss, Radavich announces: \"This is the fertile / garden I never knew.\" Here is a poet at peace with himself and the life he has made in this garden. There's an honesty about family, aging, history and place that is comforting. Rooted in the South, \"A place where old water / draws back / and memory / and pain are blended,\" Radavich's poems pave \"the way / into the bright darkness.\"\n\nâMarjory Wentworth, former Poet Laureate of South Carolina\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-31-4 | 84 Pages\n\nPamela L.

Iâve loved Mirksy since he first appeared in Paul Beckman's work, and in this collection Mirsky gets to rightfully shine, coming of age with paper routes, Devil dogs, pinball, bullies, absent fathers, Jewish mothers, Kosher Soap, and the inevitable disappointments and salvations of any survived childhood, especially one set in the big city projects of America. In Becoming Mirsky, we traverse the full range of Beckman's talentsâthe ironic, the asinine, and the wonderfully ridiculous, yes, but also the difficult, the poignant, and the downright tragic. I'm not sure if I love Beckman or Mirsky more, but I'm thrilled to indulge both here.\"\n\nâNancy Stohlman, author of After the Rapture and Going Short: An Invitation to Flash Fiction\n\n\"Every so often a memoir is penned that transcends a literary filigree of recollections and gives us an authentic, deeply felt, and brilliantly written \"accounting.\" Paul Beckman's Becoming Mirsky is such a book. In it are the quixotic and thrashing winds of culture, of youth â of \"âbecoming\" itself. Here, Ethos and Pathos bespeak a life in a common tongue we all can understand. Here, buoyed by Beckman's wry wit, recollection is not a ghost, but rather a flawed, but earnest assortment of characters on the page we wish to know about. Care to know about. What a fine and accomplished work this is.\"\n\nâRobert Scotellaro, author of What Are the Chances? and Ways to Read the World\n\n\"No one does it like Beckman â raw, raucous, poignant, vulnerableâ headlong into the underbelly of Jewish family mishugas; a confabulation of stories too embarrassing to own or identify with. Beckman's razorâsharp insight splays out before us, leaving the reader with nowhere to hide and forever changed. Mirsky oozes originality, warmth, humour, and pathos. Brilliant!\"\n\nâKaren Schauber, editor/author of \"The Group of Seven Reimagined: Contemporary Stories Inspired By Historic Canadian Paintings\" (Published by Heritage House, 2019)\n\n\"From the brilliant and prolific pen of Paul Beckman comes the compelling, funny, heartbreaking novella-in-flash, Becoming Mirsky. This collection of short stories follows the life of Reuven Mirsky from his Jewish boyhood in the projects of the Bridgeport. CT, to his service in the Air Force, and on to a new life in New Haven Connecticut suburbs. This is a layered story of place and family, of tradition and loss and survival. The child of a broken home, Mirsky is perennially misunderstood and emotionally neglected. Yet he faces the world with resilience, rebelliousness, and a sarcastic tongue that gets him into no end of trouble. The writing all through is deft and beautifully distilled. In these pages, Beckman has given us an unforgettable story of disarming courage and wit and sensitivity.\"\n\nâKathy Fish, author of Wild Life: Collected Works\n\nIn Paul Beckman's unmistakable voice, a comfortable cup of coffee with a stiff shot of scotch, we meet (or better, examine) his recurring character, Reuven Mirsky, with all of the kid-of-the-fifties memories, so vividly drawn â lemon ices and paper routes - and the characters that inhabit Mirsky's world, a Bar-Mitzvah ruining Rabbi, Mirsky's kosher soap mother, and the father who only made guest appearances from time to time. A poignant, heart-tugging, witty, and ultimately triumphant story. A wonderful and memorable read.\n\nâFrancine Witte, author of Just Outside the Tunnel of Love\n\nWhen master flash fiction writer Paul Beckman put pen to paper for Becoming Mirsky, he demonstrated why he's been selected for a Norton Anthology, a winner for Best Small Fictions, and a winner of Fiction Southeast's prize. Becoming Mirsky is as good as it gets, following the life of Mirsly, a Jewish boy growing up in poverty in the projects of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and experiencing a rough, yet incredibly realistic, life, even among his closest family members. Becoming Mirsky illustrates how we rise above, move on, and become more.\n\nâNiles Reddick, author of Drifting too far from the Shore, Reading the Coffee Grounds, & Road Kill and Other Oddities\n\nBeckman hits it out of the park, again. In Becoming Mirsky, a sidesplitting flash fiction bildungsroman that traces the trials of a young man growing up in Marina Village, a public housing project, Beckman sketches with his signature hilarity and warmth, the fraught path to adulthood for Mirsky. Sometimes innocently, and sometimes not-so-naively, Mirsky navigates his way among hardscrabble family, neighbors, and schoolmates. In adventures that range from delivering groceries past a dead man's body in a funeral parlor, to relishing the thought of one day becoming a successful shoe salesman so that he can smell the tantalizing scent of new shoe leather, Mirsky gradually learns the ways of the world. And as he recounts his hilarious adventures, readers learn that Mirskyâs world, while uniquely colorful, if at times hardboiled, is not so terribly different from their own.\n\nâBrad Rose, author of Lucky Animals and No. Wait.

His seven full-length collections are Manhattan Plaza, Stage to Page, Wind in the Cave, Out of Nothing: Poems of Art and Artists, Quickening, Fires of Heaven, and Turns & Twists. His nonfiction book Playing the Audience won a Choice award.

A graduate of Yale, he hosts the Hell's Kitchen International Writers' Round Table at his library branch in Manhattan: walk-ins are always welcome.\n\nThis latest of James Nicola's themed collections celebrates the natural world in all its beauty, power, and complexity, from the smallest grain of sand to the vastness of the heavens. Whether expressing a child's rapturous awe or an adult's sober contemplation-or the other way around-the poems are characterized by precise observation, vivid description, and technical ingenuity. Among them are lyrics of such delicacy and finish, including \"The Succulent\" and \"Ivy,\" that any true poet would be happy to have written them.\n\n-Michael Palma, author of Begin in Gladness\n\nSome very wild jumps herein, from the sacred to the profane and back to the literal earthly mundane. I did like these poems. Rather off beat from the generally incomprehensible poems you see.\n\n-John Hanson Mitchell, author of Following the Sun\n\nIn James B. Nicola's Natural Tendencies, we \"can still taste the wild and green aroma\" of his landscapes-both of the interior and the natural world. His robust imaginative intelligence is honed, his touch is lyrical, and his tone is adept. These poems address \"This wonderment, / This universe\" in an age when green space is vanishing and the climate is warming. In response, there is a solace and a resonance to be found in Natural Tendencies, demonstrated in the poems' adept craft and uniquely adroit voice.\n\n-Wally Swist, author of Taking Residence\n\n\"Welcome to my world,\" says Nicola at the portal to this book, and \"world\" is the right word for rich realm into which we're invited, that of nature, in all its manifestations. The verse is beautifully evocative throughout, the evocation being informed by a mystical, zen-like appreciation that repeatedly crystallizes in aphorism. The book ends with one of the most memorable such moments: \"And one lone soul might likewise warm my way / to light and God. It won't be one I've met, / but you, whom I have not imagined yet.\"\n\n-Dan Brown, author of Taking the Occasion\n\nCover art: \"Springtime on Grant Creek\" by Monte Dolack\n\n$18.00 | ISBN:978-1-950063-61-1 | 101 Pages\n\nZvi A.

Dechter.\n\nRead Zvi Sesling's musings in Secret Behind the Gate and youâll be instantly transported into zany, oftentimes ironic, journeys traversing the narrow alleyways, backroads, and main streets of Zvi's vivid imagination. His delightful nuggets are easily digestible but, oh so hard to put down!\n\n-Phil Temples, author of The Allston Variant and Uncontacted Frontier\n\nIt takes an exceptionally rich imagination to conceive over two hundred truly distinctive pieces of short fiction. While microscopic in length, Zvi Sesling's tales are macroscopic in their ability to entertain and provoke. You laugh, you cry, and you think... really think--no small achievement in such attenuated works. I had several favorites in Secret Behind the Gate, foremost among them, \"Nowhere Man,\" \"The Bride Wears Black,\" and \"What We Can Hope For.\" Indeed, these made me chuckle, tear up, and ultimately ponder the meaning of their message. They all had something of value to convey--maybe none more so than the bookâs namesake. It's no secret that Zvi is an original raconteur of the highest order, a storyteller par excellence, possessing enormous wit and empathy.\n\n-Michael C. Keith, author Insomnia 11 and Stories in the Key of Me\n\nWhen reading Zvi Sesling's Secret Behind the Gate, which I highly recommend, don't just cram a bunch of its tasty morsels into your mouth at once. They must be individually chewed, savored, and digested to be completely appreciated. They range from short fiction to flash fiction to micro fiction to something dangerously close to poetry, from profoundly funny to ironic to wistful to deeply sad, so you'll never know what's coming next.\n\n-Rob Dinsmoor, author of Toxic Cookout\n\n$19.95 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-68-0 | 223 Pages\n\nI grew up in southeastern Florida where hot summer days sizzled and summer nightsâ humid lips of jasmine pressed against my frosted bedroom jalousies. An aspiring athlete, I wanted to play for the Milwaukee Braves-I thought Hank Aaron was poetry in motion. Well, songwriter for a garage band, later I found myself a college sophomore writing poetry and a founding member of a group of poets and artists known as the Immanentists. Though somewhat eclectic, we were a blend of European Surrealism with a Native American sensibility who believed that through language and paint we could attain spiritual fusion with the natural world. After reading The Immanentist Anthology, the great French poet, Yves Bonnefoy, said that Immanentism was the most exciting poetry he had seen from the US in decades. What a thrill! I remained in contact with Yves until his death in 2016. Eventually, I drove a yellow Ryder truck from West Palm Beach to Baltimore to attend the graduate Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University where I made a beeline to the National Gallery in DC to marvel at the wondrous creations by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Monet, Manet, and Odilon Redon. Baltimore became my heaven with snow. Inspired by Andrew Marvell, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca, Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda, Eunice Odio, Sandor Kanyadi, Kristina Ehin, plus hundreds of others, I now write poems about anything and everything. Along the way I've learned that to write poetry is to love, and to love is to write poetry.\n\n-Alan Britt\n\nAlan has published 25 books of poetry.\n\n\"When thunder becomes symbolic again, / then and only then we'll discover / the true nature of existence.\" Not true. We know it right here in this book-this prism-this kaleidoscope of the soul bursting with imagination. And the poet's everyday world is never lost, even while tethered to high-flying multi-imaged phrases and clauses. Alan Britt's literary personality is here, precise in every note. The poetic will of each line, urgency and flair, teaches us the game.\n\n-Grace Cavalieri, Producer/Host of Public Radio's \"The Poet and the Poem from the Library of Congress\" and Maryland Poet Laureate\n\nIn The Tavern of Lost Souls, each poem rises through the reader like wine, filling the mind with the intoxication of life viewed from this unique and humanitarian perspective. Alan Britt combines elements of sensuality and subtle humor with a depth of feeling \"thick with the aroma of fresh imagination.\" About Baudelaire he writes, \"Sifting his way through human frailty, / paying attention to things lesser poets buried / beneath the borrowed sentiments of their age . . ./\" These words could apply to his own work as well, as reality and fantasy walk through these pages together, creating an addictive book one finds difficult to put down.\n\n-Patty Dickson Pieczka, Author of the novel Finding the Raven and winner of the 2012 Library of Poetry Book Award from The Bitter Oleander Press for Painting the Egret's Echo\n\n$18.95 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-26-0 | 83 Pages\n\nDenis Emorine is a French writer. He was born in 1956 in Paris. He has an emotional attachment to English because his mother was an English teacher. He is of Russian ancestry on his father's side. Writing, for Emorine, is a way of harnessing time in its incessant flight. Themes that re-occur throughout his writing include the Doppelganger, lost or shattered identity, and mythical Venice (a place that truly fascinates him). He also has a great interest for Eastern Europe. His theatrical output has been staged in France, Canada (Quebec) and Russia. Many of his books (short stories, plays, poetry) have been published in Greece, Hungary, Romania, South Africa, and the United States. His first novel La mort en berne, 5 Sens Ã©ditions, was published in Switzerland, in 2017. An English translation Death at Half-Mast is available in the USA https://www.experimentalfiction.com/ In 2015, Denis Emorine was awarded the Naji Naaman Literary Prize Lebanon (honor prize for complete work) For more information, visit his website at: http://denis.emorine.free.fr/ul/english/accueil.htm\n\nABOUT THE TRANSLATOR\n\nPhillip John Usher is Assistant Professor of French and Comparative Literature. His book Errance et cohÃ©rence: essai sur la littÃ©rature transfrontaliÃ¨re Ã la Renaissance (Paris: Classiques Garnier, 2010) deals with the topic of Renaissance border-crossing and globalization. As a translator, he is the author of the first English-language version of Ronsard's epic La Franciade (1572) (New York: AMS Press, 2010) and of Denis Emorine's No through world (Edmonds, WA: Ravenna Press, 2004). He has also translated various academic and non-academic articles and works. His articles have appeared or are forthcoming in the BibliothÃ¨que d'Humanisme et Renaissance, La Revue des Amis de Ronsard, L'Esprit CrÃ©ateur, French Forum, and elsewhere. Educated at the University of London (UK) and Harvard University (Cambridge, MA), he regularly lectures in the United States and Europe and has held a visiting position at Boston University (fall 2009). He regularly organizes lectures in the \"Translation Across the Disciplines\" series and is the webmaster for the Barnard Center of Translation Studies.\n\nDenis Emorine's short-stories reflect the misunderstanding that separates human beings, the gap between the words and their meaning. For the author, the language, far from facilitating the exchanges among us, makes all communication almost impossible. Man is trapped by his feelings whatever these feelings may be. In this way an individual is thus doomed to deceive others and to deceive oneself and manages to do it all in good faith. Denis Emorine's characters are often overwhelmed by a situation they are unable to control or they are victims of fatality as it happens in a Greek tragedy. According to the Russian literary critic Dimitri Zadkine, it is \"the romantics condemned to failure who make of their existence a tragedy, the artists lost in a dreamlike dimension, where their hypersensitivity prevents them from taking flight. They are always on the borders of madness and death.

Gregory's daily regimen includes writing, running, and tending grandchildren. He holds a doctorate from the University at Albany.\n\nOver one hundred of Gregory's short stories and reviews have been published in journals and anthologies like Glimmer Train, Georgia Review, Michigan Quarterly Review, descant, Florida Review, The Pinch, Post Road, Baltimore Review, Los Angeles Review, PANK, Superstition Review, Tahoma Literary Review, Southern Humanities Review, and many others.\n\nGregoryâs work has won awards sponsored by Solstice, descant, Gulf Stream, New South, the Rubery Book Awards, Emrys Journal, Gambling the Aisle, and the White Eagle Coffee Store Press.\n\nGregory has published three other story collections: Women of Consequence (Regal House Publishing, 2019), Dear Everyone, (Duck Lake Books, 2020), and The Thing About Men, (Cervena Barva Press, 2023). For full lists of Gregoryâs publications and commendations, visit www.gregorywolos.com.\n\nMore often than not Gregory's stories reflect Kafka's assertion that a literary work \"should be an ice axe to break up the frozen sea inside us.\"\n\nThe thing about men is that there is no single \"thing.\" The men featured in this story collection are fathers, sons, grandfathers, husbands, lovers, and loners. They are (or have been) teachers, models, gigolos, hypnotherapists, school superintendents, tattoo artists, lawyers, crematory workers, and casino employees. Some are victims; others are victimizers. All struggle to find stability or, at the very least, comfort in a world that challenges their assumptions about manhood as they search for footing in the rubble of a crumbling patriarchy. There are kindnesses and cruelties in these stories; there are successes and failures. But pull back the curtain on the central characters in The Thing About Men, and you will find that they are all men you know.\n\nThese unique stories include humans and other animals—from dogs to pandas to animal tattoos—that serve as characters to reveal the mongrel, spotted, sometimes loving relationships between men and women. Many of these stories have won awards, some are premise pieces, all are interlaced with dry humor. Here is a gifted collection that probes into our animal nature and, once read, it will not be forgotten.\n\n—Lee Hope, Founding Editor-in-Chief, Solstice: A Magazine of Diverse Voices and author of Horsefever, a SPD best-selling novel\n\n\"Injuries and afflictions abound in The Thing About Men. Gregory Wolos keeps his compelling collection attuned to complications of recovery, while illuminating, with care and craft, the wounds most in need of wary monitoring: those that persist beneath 'the usual top layer of things.' In story after fine story, Wolos urges all of us to delve deeper.\"\n\n—Matthew Pitt, author of These Are Our Demands, Midwest Book Award winner, and Attention Please Now, Winner of the Autumn House Prize\n\n$19.95 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-58-1 | 224 Pages\n\nBrief Description of Saying Goodbye\n\nA year in the life of a six-year-old Slovak boy being brought up by his grandparents in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia. In this flash story of childhood and self-discovery, filled with heartbreak and joy, betrayal and love, Adam must invent who he will become.\n\nAndrew Stancek describes his vocation as dreaming - clutching onto hope, even in turbulent times. He has been published widely, in SmokeLong Quarterly, FRIGG, Hobart, Green Mountains Review, New World Writing, New Flash Fiction Review, Jellyfish Review, Peacock Journal and The Phare, among others. Among his contest wins are the London Independent Story Prize, the Reflex Fiction contest, and the New Rivers Press American Fiction contest. His work has appeared in Best Microfiction 2021, the Bending Genres Anthology and Bath Flash Fiction anthologies. He has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize.\n\nSaying Goodbye is the story of a family reckoning with loss, loyalty, disappointment, devotion, and at the center our narrator, a child as unforgettable as any Dickens hero. Abandoned by his mother, rescued by tenderness, he loses his innocence and finds his courage in a world both unapologetic and lit with the fiercest sort of love. This gorgeous story will break your heart open.\n\n-Nancy Stohlman, After the Rapture and Going Short: An Invitation to Flash Fiction\n\nSome boys get a layer cake, others get abandonment. When young Adam's unstable mother drops him off at his grandparents' Bratislava home prior to his sixth birthday, he knows she is not coming back. Instead he must stitch together a new life, of neighborhood bicycle rides, local shopkeepers, warm strudel smells, and fresh family pain. Andrew Stancek's Saying Goodbye is at once a story of longing and grief, and one of resiliency and tender connection between a grandfather and a boy. \"Something good always grows out of something awful, like mushrooms out of manure,\" Adam says. This is a spare, effective novella-in-flash of one year in a boy's life, beautifully written, memorably told.\n\n-Sara Lippmann, author of Doll Palace\n\n$16.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-75-8 | 52 Pages\n\nAbout the Author\n\nVassiliki Rapti was born and raised in Greece, and studied Comparative Literature and Media in Greece, France, and the United States. She holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature with an Emphasis in Drama from Washington University in St. Louis, and is the author of several books, including Ludics in Surrealist Theatre and Beyond (Ashgate, 2013), the co-edited volume Ludics: Play as Humanistic Inquiry (Palgrave/MacMillan, 2021), and the bilingual poetry collection Transitorium (Somerset Hall Press, 2015). Her translation publications include Greek surrealist author Nanos Valaoritis, and her poetry and translations have been published in various international journals. She received a Parnassos Literary award in Greece in 1998.\n\nHer poetry is fueled by surrealist imagery, a pursuit of playfulness in artistic expression, and a desire to capture wonderment in everyday life. She is Chair of the Ludics Seminar of the Mahindra Humanities Center at Harvard University, where she founded the Advanced Training in Greek Poetry Translation and Performance Workshop, and currently teaches World Literature and Digital Culture at Emerson College. She is the founding director Citizen TALES* Commons, an international collective of scholars and artists.\n\nThe poetry collection that forms the core of this volume was published in Greek in Athens in 2021. In November 2022, the Voice of Greece, the radio arm of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (EPT), featured Vassiliki as its Poet of the Week, with twice daily readings of her poetry throughout the week.\n\nAbout the Tranlator\n\nA native of Toronto, Canada, Peter Bottéas holds a Master's degree in Translation from the Université de Montréal and worked for many years as a translator, revisor, editor, and educator in French Canada. After a twenty-year detour as a psychotherapist in Boston, he recently returned to one of his first loves, literary translation, and is currently the primary translator of Greek Boston-based poet Vassiliki Rapti. The author and translator have done several poetry readings together in New York and Boston, as well as in on-line forums. He is a member of the multidisciplinary think-tank and creative forum Citizen TALES Commons and, along with Vassiliki, is co-host of the podcast series Borders Unbound: Hellenic Poetry of the Diaspora and Beyond. Peter is also an occasional voice-over artist, an infrequent poet, and an aficionado of French and Greek poetry set to music.\n\nEver since an insomniac, lovelorn Sappho looked up at the moon, Greek lyric poetry has echoed her register of gluko-pikron: the sweet-bitterness of longing. We open our mouths because we desire. Open Bathed in Moonlight to any page and you'll find the language of desire suffused by the tender, intensely focused erotic glow of Vassiliki Rapti's rapturous gift. Yet the moon, and Sappho, are not the only presiding spirits of illumination in this magical collection. Rapti has struck the Sapphic note in a new key by fusing it with the voices of some of the great surrealist Greek poets of the twentieth century. The result is a felicitous mix of mournful eloquence and expressionist imagination, delicate inwardness and evocative power-a testament to the \"Perpetual Perseverance\" of a disciplined and formidable imagination:\n\nyou were cast among myriad\n\nmulticolored peacocks\n\nso that you might learn the skill\n\nof perseverance\n\ndragged out, freed after aeons\n\nflung, whirling, whirling\n\ninto the embrace of the moon.\n\nIn the pitch-perfect registers of Peter BottÃ©as's beautiful translation, Bathed in Moonlight is pristine.\n\n-George Kalogeris, author of Winthropos, Associate Professor of English Literature and Classics at Suffolk University, Boston\n\nAs it moves back and forth over time, Bathed in Moonlight explores the ambiguity of what is lost and what is gained in poetry. While Vassiliki Rapti's poems certainly engage with the voices of her native Greek tradition they would also seem to be in dialogue with poetries beyond the borders of the western world. She tends to locate individual experience in the collective. And so, with intense lyricism and transformative, vivid expression, each poem creates its own separate world of emotional strength. These poems are fluent, vibrant, reflective, sensitive, open and brilliantly sensory. They reflect Rapti's wonder at the world, the cyclic nature of life and language. Her voice spins, floats, and whirls from spiral shells, floating lakes, the ever vigilant moon and calls through fragments of memory, the depths of the underground and the unspoken that hides between each line.\n\n-Gonca Özmen\n\nVassiliki Rapti's luminous, capacious poems are journeys arising from hope and fears; aching and searching, they seek kinship and reconciliation with nature which is the true home for the restless, solitary self. Sensuous yet balanced, sparse yet containing multitudes, Bathed in Moonlight illuminates the life of the mind where remembrance and unbridled thoughts run together, where human yearnings are an enduring life force, where words, written from the innermost place resonate and affirm the power of poetry. This marvelous collection of poems is a balm in our fractured and chaotic time.\n\n-Pui Ying Wong author of The Feast\n\n$16.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-76-5 | 66 Pages\n\nBarbara Molloy is a writer, artist, and jazz vocalist who makes her home in Coupeville, Washington on beautiful Whidbey Island. A previous book of poems, In Favor of Lightning, was published by Wesleyan University Press. Ms. Molloy's work has been nominated for Pushcart prizes and has won awards from The Pen Foundation. Her poems have appeared in a variety of literary journals.\n\nBarbara Molloy's new collection Heaven with Others is a feast for the senses, as well as an elegiac reminder that all we have is the present. These poems study mortality: \"As if it was not her at all,/dying,/abut to die,/being dead,/or returned to life...\" (âGift of Sunflowersâ). In the hands of this accomplished lyricist even the most sordid past is rendered as fine art and gifted with visceral re-birth in organic images not easily forgotten: \"Leaves strewn about the yards-/the exact color of church and rectory bricks...\" (Breeze). Molloy's voice brings down the high-brow and lifts up the colloquial. We are the beneficiaries of her vision.\n\n-Judith Skillman\n\nIn this new collection, Barbara Molloy Olund keeps a sharp focus on the chaos of discarded objects and lives while tracking surprising moments of humor. \"Who said 'cherish the moments' and/ 'life gives you a lemon; make lemonade?'/ Are they tired yet?...\" asks the narrator (Of Ghosts). These poems respect the hard work of living. There's an intention here, almost a promise, to never let go of what matters, no matter how seemingly unimportant an object or detail, how elusive a relationship-what prevails is the intention to continue searching for what's real and what's not. \"I will not love the past./ Let it glitter. Let it sit forward...\" (Decision). I admire how this work confronts the spiritual labor of care giving, birthing, struggling with addiction, negotiating with ghosts, and parenting. And I'm touched by the ongoing, archetypal process running through these pages-the sorting-out of wisps of beauty from the detritus of life.\n\n-Christianne Balk\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Barbara Molloy writes \"the most impossible/variables line up.\" And in her poems, they do. Her poems leave me breathless, off kilter, bewildered (in the archaic sense of being lured into the wilds). In these wilds, grief is a force of gravity. The vision here is uncanny-the familiar is strange, the strange familiar. The seemingly ordinary embodies the unforeseen, what Stanley Plumly called in her first book \"a kind of clairvoyance.\"\n\n-Eric Pankey\n\nThe poems in Barbara Molloy's new book, Heaven With Others, don't rest quietly in the realm of the familiar and quotidian. Nor do they keep to the territory of the uncanny and mysterious. Molloy's poems travel in the shifting borderlands between those irreconcilable worlds. That's the rocky, unmapped terrain that her fiercely moving poems lead us through. I'm reminded of Jean Valentine's sudden leaps into unforeseen light, and also of C.K. Williams's earthbound acknowledgement of the grit underfoot. These beautiful, memorable poems are compassionate, honest testaments to what it is to walk here alone and in company, as a mortal body inhabited by spirit and dream.\n\n-Jennifer Atkinson\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-54-3 | 56 Pages\n\nElizabeth Lund is the award-winning host of Poetic Lines, which features in-depth interviews with established and emerging poets. She also covers poetry for major publications, including The Christian Science Monitor, where she edited poetry for ten years. From 2015 through 2019 she wrote a monthly poetry column for The Washington Post. Her own poems have appeared in the US, the UK, and Canada. She has read and appeared at a variety of festivals, most recently the Gaithersburg Book Festival, where she served as the final judge for the 2020 high school poetry contest.\n\nLong before 2020, when the world began grappling with a pervasive pandemic that resulted in widespread personal isolation, another type of malevolence locked many women inside their homes. These poems address the devastating effects of domestic violence and seek to restore one victimâs voice, allowing her to speak to and through another generation of women.\n\nPoetry is one of the few art forms that enables us to approach extremely difficult and complex human experiences without having to turn to didacticism or preaching. Lundâs poems do this exquisitely as they grapple with the intense emotions of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. Each poem is a compelling piece of a much larger puzzle - one that explores the effects of toxic masculinity and the debilitating fallacy that a woman can free her abuser from his own darkness.\n\nWith the concision of Emily Dickinson who taught us to \"tell all the truth but tell it slant -,\" and a stream of consciousness narrative, Lund creates the perfect modality to convey an intense and painful journey that generations of women have experienced.\n\nThe result, Un-Silenced, is an absolutely stunning, heart-rattling read that implores us to open our hearts and minds.\n\n-Michael S. Glaser, Poet Laureate of Maryland 2004-2009\n\nA gunshot is fired. Police are called. One could say the sky/turns a deaf ear. In this powerful collection, Elizabeth Lund, the omnipresent speaker, honors a beloved aunt and casts light on other women who have suffered domestic abuse. Through poignant narrative and lyric fragments, Un-Silenced takes us deep into a culture that perpetrates violence against women. Lund gives these women the dignity they deserve while finding solace and closure to her own familial pain. This is a major debut of an authentic, compassionate voice! May all who have been harmed or are in harm's way, directly or indirectly, be blessed by this book's presence in the world.\n\n-Dzvinia Orlowsky, author of Bad Harvest and Silvertone\n\nElizabeth Lund has captured the sorrow and malevolence of our times in lyrics that are unsparing, mysterious, and defiantly beautiful. I was captivated from first page to last.\n\n-Hilary Holladay, author of The Power of Adrienne Rich: A Biography\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-79-6 | 60 Pages\n\nIrina Mashinski was born and raised in Moscow. She graduated from Moscow University, where she studied theory of landscape and completed her PhD in paleoclimatology. In 1991, she emigrated to the United States, where she taught high school mathematics as well as literature, history, and meteorology at several universities. Mashinski is the author The Naked World (MadHat Press, 2022) and of eleven books of poetry and essays in Russian. She is co-editor, with Robert Chandler and Boris Dralyuk, of The Penguin Book of Russian Poetry (Penguin Classics, 2015) and of Cardinal Points, the journal of Brown University's Slavic Department. Her work has been translated into several languages and has appeared in numerous journals and anthologies both in the US and internationally. Website: www.irinamashinski.com\n\nIrina Mashinski is a poet who has the rooting feeling for the tag game played between the inapposite and the apposite. Accordingly, nothing is off-limit because there is no limit for a poet who can be microscopic and cosmic, offhand and adjuring, and who, above all, is willing to descend and ascend-again, without limits. The long central poem In Absentia is a tour de force of relentless probing of loss and the innumerable, parti-colored shards that accompany loss, the drear yet enticing yet shattering yet sustaining landscape of memories. The translations bring a wonderfully attentive ear to the page, one that delights in the resonances and the cadences of English. All in all, this book is a book of poems to live with, containing the vastness and fearlessness we all hope to find in poetry.\n\n-Baron Wormser, author of Legends of the Slow Explosion\n\nIf poetry is the language capable of shedding light on the things beyond, the things in between, then Irina Mashinski illuminates them - to the very core of our existence.\n\n-Lothar Quinkenstein, author of Souterrain and translator of Olga Tokarczuk\n\nIrina Mashinski's poems in Giornata inhabit the landscape of elegy and exile, as well as the actual landscape of rural America. She forgets nothing, asking without self-pity, \"Who's left?\" These translations feel wholly original, rich in music, but mostly rich with the poet's sensibility, the tenderness with which she opens to her losses and offers them to us, like her grandmother's \"Moscow teacups\" an image so simple and so arresting. Mashinski teaches us to reckon with the past, to know the world as inherently elegiac, and yet to also be tied to the moment, to love the moment, not missing anything, not the clouds blooming outside her window, or the detritus on the forest floor. These are poems to return to and live with.\n\n-Anne Marie Macari, author of Heaven Beneath\n\nIrina Mashinski's poetic eye has such range, it seems to move above the earth and see both the changing of landscapes and the shift between eras with equal ease. There is also an underlying cheerful quality about the poems, which could be straight elegies for our terrible centuries and histories but somehow refuse to give in to undiluted sadness. These new translations convey the purity and fineness of Mashinski's work, whilst conveying its formal complexity - a rare feat.\n\n-Alexandra Dugdale, author of Deformations and Joy\n\nGiornata. A day's work on a fresco, on a true fresco, buon, where the pigment is permanently fused with the plaster, where the vision, the dream, becomes one with its surface, where the day does not just point to its mystery, it is our mystery. In these poems, Irina Mashinski migrates between Russia and the U.S., between her past and present, between memory and memory. In so doing, she teaches me what cannot ever be left or lost: this moment, our now. Mashinski is a poet's poet. I am in awe. -Rebecca Gayle Howell, author of American Purgatory and Render / An Apocalypse\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-60-4 | 94 Pages\n\nMichael Daley was born and raised in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

A retired teacher, he lives near Deception Pass in Washington.\n\nTrue Heresies is a cocktail of rage, anti-poems, and dissonant songs; this collection takes a swing or two at several revered institutions and dogmata. Some of the topics addressed here are exhumed from contemporary headlines, historical events often obscured by our collective distractions; at the unconscious fringe of philosophical meddling, some of these poems voice the suppressed terrors of todayâs imminent dystopia. True Heresies calls out from necessity that shout in the street that is divine while remaining profoundly human. In an age when taking anything on faith is a challenge, these poems like bells peal forth their questions.\n\nMouth-filling! Mind-bending! A total trip! The images, references, and connections come so fast and furious, it's hard to catch my breath! These poems have some serious juice-the first one is SO intense-it seems to contain the outlines of all the rest-and from there, the poems slow a bit, and focus more closely, as if through squinted eyes, but never losing momentum.\n\n-Marjorie Rommel, Poet Laureate Emerita, Auburn, Washington\n\nI have no idea how these poems were conceived, whether in a boil after two weeks in the darkest recesses of a cave, or upon watching disastrous election returns on a continuous loop, or as one poem title suggests, at 35,000 feet while listening to The Odyssey, but they are bursting with classical and backwoods tragedies, passions, and humors (clever and ill), and they are excellent, challenging company.\n\n-Kathleen Flenniken, former Washington State Poet Laureate\n\nMichael Daley's poems are waiting for a world to be finished (and that is meant in both senses of the word). They are both powerfully evocative of the nothingness holding the living in its thrall and the dialectical affirmations of its images, whose textures confront that nothingness and insist on overcoming its negations. A book of poems that strengthens the soul.\n\n-Jack Hirschman, Poet Laureate Emeritus, San Francisco, California\n\nTrue Heresies is an American original, filled to overflowing with a unique voice and an idiosyncratic turn of mind. Daley's words and images can make a reader's head spin for a long time after the book is closed. It will enlarge your perceptions of what poetry can do. He makes conventional poems taste like sour milk. His work can fleece the reader raw.\n\n-Louis Phillips, author of How Wide the Meadow\n\n\"Great literature,\" Ezra Pound famously said, \"is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree.\" Michael Daley's poems most certainly are highly charged. \"Language,\" he writes in one poem, \"is tied to every atom.\" And that charge creates a kind of nuclear fusion that bonds music to meaning. In True Heresies, the music is often furious and symphonic, the meaning often a savage reflection of a fractured age, a time of climate disruption we ourselves have brought on and, as of now, appear to be doing very little to prevent what seems like a chain reaction. Daley's poems are the Greek chorus, the heretics who speak the sometimes-unspeakable truths we wish we could avoid.\n\n-Ed Harkness, author of The Law of the Unforeseen\n\nCover photo: Â© Jay Mallin/ZUMA Press\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-63-5 | 96 Pages\n\nAnis Shivani is a poet, fiction writer, and literary critic living in Houston, Texas.

This startling work resists the easy spectacle poetry, and even confessions themselves, often offer the heart. Instead, Shivani's lucid perceptions expose, darkly, and incandescently, too, the aches and auguries of that which is spoken and unspoken through language. These inseparable collisions of ecstatic and ordinary life, the world and the word, intellect and instinct, are visceral in discovery and intimacy. We, too, become fortunate travelers hurtling inside the prowess of Shivani's polyphonic acts. Confessions is the voice of an expansive mind, deeply conscious and deservedly celebratory of its own free textures and countries.\"\n\n-Rachel Eliza Griffiths, award-winning author of Mule & Pear, Lighting the Shadow, and Seeing the Body\n\nPRAISE FOR ANIS SHIVANI'S POETRY\n\n\"Anis Shivani evidently inhabits a world in which every moment of time in the past, present, and a humorously but lethally prophesied future, occurs simultaneously and is animated by a wit sometimes subtle, sometimes savagely indignant. Its two faces join forces and somehow manage to speak in unison of what they actually see and think. I sense everywhere an undercurrent of compassion and identification, a poignant humanity and sense of responsibility underneath his torrential voice.\"\n\n-Franz Wright\n\n\"When I first plunged into Anis Shivani's work, I had the impression two of my most admired dead poet friends were one-upping each other in the afterlife-Tom Disch with his straight-faced drop-dead virtuoso satire of literary and political pretension and Aga Shahid Ali with his eloquent, global, polyglot formal legerdemain-both of them knowing more about history and about literature than ninety-nine percent of their readers. But Shivani's poems are no phantoms, they are vibrant, new, knowledgeable, daring, and welcome.\"\n\n-Marilyn Hacker\n\n\"Anis Shivani's poetry is remarkable for its continuing preoccupation with literature, culture, and language, and a discourse that incorporates the written word, the oral tradition, and the imagery of art and film. His cerebral poems often border on the obscure, but constantly challenge the reader to unravel deeply embedded references, suggestions, and innuendoes. The innovative use of words and sounds that draw on myriad languages and cultures adds to the rich texture of each poem.\"\n\n-Muneeza Shamsie\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-29-1 | 102 Pages\n\nMichael C. Keith is the author or coauthor of more than two dozen groundbreaking books on electronic media, including one chosen by President Clinton for his official summer reading list. Beyond that, he is the author of an acclaimed memoir (The Next Better Place, Algonquin Books), a young adult novel, and 19 story collections- his latest Insomnia 11 from MadHat Press and Pieces of Bones and Rags from Cabal Books. He has received accolades for his academic and fiction writing.\n\nIn the tradition of the classic micro-fiction of renowned writer Lydia Davis, this singular collection explores the full range of human endeavor and behavior in all their varied and discrete (and not so discrete) manifestations. Keith's mini-stories, perhaps more appropriately called prose/poetry because of their lyrical nature, take the reader to places only a truly vivid and original imagination could. Often disquieting in theme and plot, the pieces within these covers invariably contain meaningful truths and lessons while managing to accomplish this in a witty and affecting manner.\n\nIn Quiet Geography, Michael C. Keith fashions a multitude of miniature worlds, and in each one he finds the perfect narrative distance and tone of voice to infuse the comic with the dark and the dark with the comic. Unique, yet intentionally ambiguous, these micro-stories are shapeshifters. Chameleon-like, Keith's creations change color and reveal different patterns so the reader may respond differently each time he or she re-reads them. These wry, richly detailed flash fictions repay each reading by offering gem-like, myriad angles of reflection.\n\n-Allen Wier, author of Tehano and Late Night, Early Morning\n\nQuiet Geography's cleverly dark humor stays lively throughout. It normalizes the strange and estranges the normal. There are cynical vibes, but they're not overwhelming; besides, as someone (Seneca?) said, cynics are really idealists at heart. Itâs good to know Michael C. Keith is out there demonstrating the delights of idealistic cynicism. This is one of the best reads I've had this year.\n\n-Betsy Delmonico, editor-in-chief Golden Antelope Press\n\n$18.95 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-74-1 | 194 Pages\n\nDavid Cappella, Professor Emeritus of English and the 2017/2018 Poet-in-Residence at Central Connecticut State University, has co-authored two widely used poetry textbooks, Teaching the Art of Poetry: The Moves and A Surge of Language: Teaching Poetry Day to Day. He won the Bright Hill Press Poetry Chapbook Competition in 2006. His poems and essays have appeared in various literary journals and anthologies in the US and Europe. His novel, Kindling, has been called \"a powerful and devastating coming-of-age story.\" Visit his university web site: http://webcapp.ccsu.edu/?fsdMember=249\n\nNote to the Reader\n\nGobbo: A Solitaire's Opera is a \"natural opera.\" That is, it is the emotional arc of a poet's life rendered in poetry. The sonnet sequence is divided into three acts much like a formal opera, and it is loosely based on the life of the Italian poet, Giacomo Leopardi. His life, fraught with emotional and physical pain, did not stop him from writing some of the most exquisite lyrical poetry of his age, of all time. His view of human nature, of mankind in general was dark, but this was not necessarily because he was physically misshapen, though some think that is the case. Whatever his view of humanity or whatever his emotional and physical pain, Leopardi demonstrated great courage in the face of adversity while his poetry transcended his life.\n\nThough the emotional life of Gobbo follows the life of Leopardi, his voice is, most assuredly, not Leopardi's. The voice of Gobbo is the consciousness of a poet living his life. He is the artist navigating the world. Gobbo: A Solitaire's Opera is not an historical or a biographical document.\n\n\"David Cappella's Gobbo is truly operatic as it makes us feel the heart and soul of a tortured yet remarkable poet. Through the deft use of form, Cappella maintains a constant window on a changeable man. Each aria-like poem articulates an aspect of Gobboâs experience while creating, as in opera, a powerful emotional skein. This is a life of a poet in poems. As such, its relevance is timeless.\"\n\n-Baron Wormser\n\n\"It is difficult for us who live in an anti-romantic age to grasp the consciousness of the romantic poet without the aura of the decorative, or the merely forlorn, obstructing our appreciation. We may sense a great reduction has come to pass regarding the ways of being available to a poet in todayâs world. In these poems, from the first act of David Cappellaâs Gobbo: A Solitaireâs Opera, we are given, again, what poets in western societies have lost, the exquisitely articulated desires and claims of the young poet who has âno loves, no friends, nothing, just [his] studiesâ and yet, through the exercise of an intense imagination, finds comfort and confirmation in nature, books, language itself, and encounters with the beautiful and the infinite. It is high, grand stuff, true art, when a poet can embody the dance that transpires between the imagination and life lived in response to perceptions and circumstances. This is what David Cappella has created with delicacy and balance.\"\n\n-Gray Jacobik\n\nCover art: \"One / Leopardi\" by Britta Winkels\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-15-4 | 106 Pages\n\nDavid O'Connell's chapbook, A Better Way to Fall, was awarded the Philbrick Poetry Award from the Providence Athenaeum.

They enact the scrutiny and self-awareness that Robert Lowell called for, that \"agonizing reappraisal,\" and do so with great tenderness and with a wry sense of how our lives are interwoven with myth and history and with work memos and The Weather Channel. Our Best Defense arms us with humor, fearlessness, and wonder.\n\n-Robert Cording\n\nDavid O'Connell leads readers through a modern family life with tenderness, skepticism, and wonder. It's a life he knows-though that life is not everyone's. How much is lost when he passes on time with his wife to deliver a promised memo to Legal instead? When his toddler daughter sobs to a Christmas tune? These poems know better than to feel at ease with the timbre of Bing Crosby or the rhyme scheme of Edwin Arlington Robinson. These poems expose the mirage of perfect life outside day spas and inside sheltered schoolrooms. \"Why do we learn / what we learn in this order?\" is a persistent question-of this book and of the times. \"What are you doing with your life?\" O'Connell asks. The weather's unseasonably off. And there's no way to ignore the historical record skipping.\n\n-Yona Harvey\n\nEvery poem in David O'Connell's fine debut embodies Robert Frost's definition of poetry: \"A momentary stay against confusion.\" Poems celebrating work well done, the blues of Robert Johnson, and the deep nourishment of domesticity keep company with poems lamenting heroism's blindness and the wasteland homo sapiens seem determined to make of our planet. Formally various, the poems share a deceptively calm, patient voice, the sound of a writer who knows how ineffably fragile and sublime existence is. \"Marriage,\" a three-line lyric that arrives late in the book, puts the matter best: \"Evening, winter, fresh/from the bath, she leaves a trail./I take off my socks.\"\n\n-John Repp\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-48-2 | 92 Pages\n\nA Pushcart Prize and Best Small Fictions nominee, Renuka Raghavan, is an Indian-American author who writes short-form prose and poetry.

A powerful collection.\"\n\n-Jayne Martin, author of Tender Cuts and The Daddy Chronicles-Memoir of a Fatherless Daughter\n\n\"In this literary braid of tragedy, irony, and humor, Renuka Raghavan delivers masterfully crafted stories that make you smile or break your heart. All of lifeâs messiest, saddest, weirdest, and most chaotic scenarios are here: from a soul deadening one night stand with a disc jockey and a calm stegosaurus skeleton who's not bothered by much, to the devastating consequences of a mother's criticism, no emotion is left unturned. Nothing Resplendent Lives Here is our choice for best short story collection of the year.\"\n\n-Robin Stratton, editor Boston Literary Magazine\n\n\"Nothing Resplendent Lives Here is a beautiful swirl of tight, inventive stories that introduce us to invisible mothers who show up at a poetry reading, lovers who have died but continue to live in every corner of the house, and so many others. A mix of returning library books, fishing toys out of claw machines, and giant flowers that smell of decay, acts of ordinary life turned upside down. The stories are set in varying locales from Las Vegas to New Orleans to Delhi and, of course, the happiest place on earth. Skillfully crafted with charged language, poignancy, and unforgettable characterization, these stories will delight you and weave themselves into your heart.\"\n\n-Francine Witte, author of Dressed All Wrong for This and The Cake, The Smoke, The Moon\n\n$18.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-71-0 | 60 Pages\n\nOf his first book Partner, Orchard, Day Moon published in 2014 David Ferry wrote, Michael Steffen is so alive in his writing, keen with observation, both of what things actually look like, what the wind feels like, how things grow and rot, and also of character, his own, his uncles', anybody's he sees. Steffen is the recipient of a 2021 Massachusetts Cultural Council Literary Fellowship, and his poetry has appeared in journals, including The Boston Globe, The Concord Saunterer, Ibbetson Street, The Lyric and Synchronized Chaos.\n\nFrom beginning to end, through great and small, the stirrings of a hurricane, the agility of a housefly, the majesty of a Pacific Northwest Sequoia, On Earth As It Is upholds the wonders of life on our lonely blue planet, bringing new inflections to the voice of eco-poetry, while formal and topical surprise from poem to poem defies genre. Steffen's restless curiosity ranges from silent alarm to staggering resignation, formal irony for the popular and political language of \"global warming\" to out and out observance for the iconic heroes and defenders of the earth and its elements from Rachel Carson to Ansel Adams. Still, barber, dentist, the memory of a dog, a Botticelli Madonna and Infant, Mae West, a tortoise wavering between its natural appearance and its resonance in fable, also appear as subjects in the poems to evoke the human and mythical entanglements at stake in the survival of our world. Shy of the overwhelming challenges we are facing in this realm today, the simple challenge of this selection to the reader is how to stop turning its pages.\n\nIt is so present, the speaker in this collection observes, and every poem in some way proves this: Steffen's close observations, intimate portraits, sense of history, surprising wit and the play of dark and light, all bring the reader into the now, a world where the sheer physicality of abstractions (the vice of innocence, immensity I sleep on, a narrow salvation and many more) renews and refreshes their meaning. The pleasures of the poems in On Earth As It Is are many, but foremost among them is the striking combination of the clear-eyed and the complicated, the everyday and the transcendent. This is accomplished and important work.\n\n-Joan Houlihan, author of It Isn't a Ghost if It Lives in Your Chest\n\nCover art: Bridget Galway\n\n$16.00 | ISBN: 978-1-950063-17-8 | 53 Pages\n\nWelcome to a world where there is no time for death. It is a place and a state of mind, both for the temporal and the spiritual with space for the mundane and the extraordinary. \"No Time for Death' is Harris Gardner's fourth published collection; it is his first in fifteen years. This poetry collection is divided into three sections: An Argument with Time; Contemplating Mortality Instead of My Navel; and Negotiating for An Afterlife. These are serious poems with an undercurrent of humor pervading many of them. The subject matter spans the spectrum of the human condition imbued with faith, hope, and the occasional flicker of regret. It is engaged with the busy-ness of living. \"No Time for Death\" offers an overarching theme: Take a breath, a revitalizing pause; as for Mortality, slow down; enjoy the most of each day-to-day. What's the rush? Death can wait, can't it?\n\nHarris Gardner has been the Poetry Editor of Ibbetson Street since 2010. He has authored four poetry collections: Chalice of Eros, co-authored with Lainie Senechal (Stone Soup Press) 1998; Lest They Become (Ibbetson Street Press) 2003; Among Us (Cervena Barva Press) 2007; No Time for Death (Cervena Barva Press) 2021. His numerous publication credits include The Harvard Review, A Poet's Siddur, Midstream, Cool Plums, Rosebud, Fulcrum, Chest, The Aurorean, Ibbetson street, Constellations (#6 and #7), Main Street Rag, Vallum (Canada), Levure Litteraire (France), Green Door (Belgium), Muddy River Poetry Review, Wilderness House Literary, Review.com, The Jewish Advocate, The New Renaissance, Endicott Review, Concrete Wolf, I Refused to Die (A Holocaust Anthology of stories of Boston Area Holocaust Survivors and Soldiers Who Liberated the Concentration Camps of World War II), Bagels with the Bards Anthology, Merrimac Mic Anthology, and others.\n\nHe co-founded, with Lainie Senechal, Tapestry of Voices, 1999 to the present); Co-founded, with Lainie Senechal, The Boston National Poetry Month Festival, 2001 to the present; Co-founded, with Doug Holder (his brainchild) Breaking Bagels with the Bards, 2005 to the present. Gardner was Poet-in-Residence at Endicott College, 2002-April, 2005. He founded and hosted many poetry venues over the past twenty-two years, a few which ran simultaneously for up to eight years including Boston Borders, Poetry in The Chapel Series (Forest Hills Cemetery), Mad Poets CafÃ© (Pawtucket, R.I.); others included The Parker House Hotel, The Laureate Series at Boston City Hall, and, currently, The First and Last Word Poetry Series, Co-founded and co-hosted with Gloria Mindock, 2010 to the present. He has been featured at many venues in New England.\n\nHe has been a member of six blue ribbon Poet Laureate selection committees: three for Boston and three for Somerville. His poetry has been nominated for two Pushcart Prizes and he received honorable mention for the New England Poetry Club's Boyle-Farber Prize. In 2015, he received a Life Time Achievement Award From Ibbetson Street Press and a Citation from the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He is currently a member of the Academy of American Poets.\n\nNo Time for Death is just the right title for this lovely collection that uses poignant wit and deep feeling to fend off mortality in the only way that poems know how: by keeping time alive in breathing lines. I admire the combination of playful, ebullient imagination and steady, formal restraint in these ranging meditations on transience. There are also some extremely moving poems about Gardner's Jewish heritage. And then there's Gardner's intuitive grasp of the instructive way that language, by its punctuated structure, keeps reminding us of our human predicament, even as it continues beyond the end-stopped lines.\n\n-George Kalogeris, Author of Dialogos (Antilever Press) and Camus: Carnets (Pressed Wafer Press)\n\nHarris Gardner's collection, No Time for Death, is sharply aware of mortality. How do we understand the passing of time, and our place in it? How do we come to terms with the certain knowledge that our lives will end? Although these are questions without answers, Gardner, in a poem like \"Entreaty to the Trees\" finds a way forward through the recognition of the world's healing beauty. The trees exhale \"that we may breathe,\" and they nourish us with their \"full blown fruit.\" They, and we, are sacred parts of the whole.\n\n-Jennifer Barber, Founding Editor, Salamander, author of Works on Paper (Word Works)\n\nHarris Gardner's new collection of poems is a contemporary memento mori, a sustained reflection on our mortality. These poems show us many surprising ways the awareness of death insinuates itself into our daily thoughts and most private feelings. With wry and humane wit, Gardner presents us with poetic spells or rituals that do not deny death as much as they put it in its place. Like Dylan Thomas and John Donne before him, Gardner is fully intent on showing us how death shall have in the end no dominion, and that it too will die. When one is committed to life, these poems say, there really is no time for death.\n\n-Fred Marchant, Author of Said Not Said"
