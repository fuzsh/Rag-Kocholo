        "text": "Just as Cordoba striker Alfredo Morelos is the third top scorer in the history of the UEFA Europa League since the previous stages of competition re-launched in 2009, in South America the Colombian team's also Cordovan ariete, Miguel Ángel Borja is in the top 10 list of top scorers of the Cup South American, the equivalent of the Europa League of Conmebol.\n\n2022 marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of the South American Conmebol Cup, a competition that has had Atlético Nacional as the top finalist with three lost championships (2002, 2014 and 2016) and in which Miguel Ángel Borja, former purslane player, has just entered history and is now available to Junior from Barranquilla as the tenth highest scorer in the history of the tournament.\n\nOn the night of Thursday, March 17, Junior from Barranquilla qualified for the group stage of the 2022 Copa Conmebol Sudamericana after defeating La Equidad 3-1 in the second leg played at the Metropolitano Roberto Meléndez stadium.\n\nThe same central striker of the tricolor team, Miguel Borja was in charge of opening the scoring and was among the top scorers in the history of the competition after recording this definition:\n\nThat goal was number eleven in Miguel Borja's career in the Copa Sudamericana. The attacker scored five of those eleven with Junior from Barranquilla in previous editions, while he did six with Atlético Nacional when he was on the Antioquia team between 2016 and 2017, from Cortuluá.\n\nIt may interest you: Miguel Borja may not make it to the Colombia National Team for the last matches of the qualifying round\n\nWithin the scoring ranks, Borja is still far from the top, equaling Chilean Eduardo Vargas and Argentina's José Pepe Sand. However, already in the group stage Borja will be able to increase his streak and more clearly approach the first place held by Argentina's Hernán Barcos with 19 goals.\n\nMeanwhile, after the definition of the pots for the draw of the Copa Sudamericana group stage, the Barranquilla team was the most privileged, as they placed in the first bowling alley together with valuable payrolls from the continent such as Santos, Porto Alegre International, São Paulo, Independiente and Racing de Avellaneda and Liga de Quito in Ecuador, whom it will avoid in the later phase:\n\nBelow is the updated ranking of the top 10 scorers of the Copa Conmebol Sudamericana in just over 19 years of history, taking into account previous rounds of qualifying, since for one year the tournament has had a group stage and subsequent round of 16:\n\n1 - Hernán Barcos [19 goals] (Argentina).\n\n2 - Rafael Moura [14 goals] (Brazil).\n\n3 - Rodrigo López [14 goals] (Uruguay). RETIRED.\n\n4 - Rodrigo Mora [13 goals] (Uruguay). RETIRED.\n\n5 - Miler Bolaños [13 goals] (Ecuador).\n\n6 - Silvio Romero [12 goals] (Argentina).\n\n7 - Claudio Bieler [12 goals] (Argentina).\n\n8 - José Sand [11 goals] (Argentina).\n\n9 - Eduardo Vargas [11 goals] (Chile).\n\n10 - Miguel Borja [11 goals] (Colombia)."
