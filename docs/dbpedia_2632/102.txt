Sporting Kansas City forward Claudio Bieler has signed with Argentine first-division club Quilmes and will be unveiled back in his home country early this coming week, according to a report by Argentine newspaper El Sol.

The 30-year-old Designated Player was signed by Sporting KC in December 2012. Bieler got off to a quick start in MLS, scoring nine league goals in the first half of the 2013 season before a nagging injury lingered late into the regular season and into the playoffs. From August 2013 onward, Bieler scored just three league goals in Sporting blue as Dom Dwyer enjoyed a breakout 2014 season (22 goals), locking up the starting forward spot for the foreseeable future.

Bieler always looked more likely to leave Sporting before receiving another prolonged run in the first team. A trade to another MLS team would have returned a fair amount of intra-MLS assets (allocation money, draft picks and/or a quality player or two), but in selling Bieler, Sporting free up one of three DP roster slots (Matt Besler and Graham Zusi are the others), leaving head coach and technical director Peter Vermes with a number of options and significant flexibility in regards to the salary cap.

While Sporting have already added former-SKC midfielder Roger Espinoza and Chilean goalkeeper Luis Marin, among others, this offseason Vermes and Co. seem nowhere near finished making moves, as club CEO Robb Heineman tweeted last week that a deal for an additional defensive midfielder had fallen through due to a failed physical.
