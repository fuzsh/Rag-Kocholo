Playing career

Club

Borghi started his career as an Attacking midfielder for Argentinos Juniors in the early 1980s. He was considered a bright young star for Argentina and tipped by many to be on a level with Diego Maradona.

Borghi's exceptional performance in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup final (Argentinos Juniors lost to Juventus on penalties) drew the attention of AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi, and Borghi was signed for the club in 1987. Borghi was drafted in alongside Dutchmen Marco Van Basten and Ruud Gullit, but, since teams were allowed on only two foreign players, he was loaned out to Como for the 1987–88 season. The next year the maximum number of foreign players was increased to three, but Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi – who had won respect by securing the Scudetto a few months earlier – asked his team to sign another Dutch player, Frank Rijkaard, instead of bringing Borghi back, as Berlusconi wished. Afterwards Borghi left Italy and tried his luck in Switzerland with Neuchâtel Xamax, before returning to South America where he played for River Plate, Flamengo and Independiente. Eventually he wound up in Chile, winning the Recopa Sudamericana and Copa Interamericana with Colo-Colo in 1992, and concluded his playing career with Santiago Wanderers in 1999.

International

Borghi was called up to the Argentina national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, where he won the World Cup with Argentina and played alongside Diego Maradona at his peak.

Coaching career

Early coaching career

After retiring as a player, Borghi started a career as a coach in Chile, between 2004 and 2005 he worked as the coach of Audax Italiano.

Colo-Colo

In 2006 Borghi was appointed as the coach of Colo-Colo. He led the team to four consecutive league championships between 2006 and 2007. He also led the club to the final of the 2006 Copa Sudamericana and received the South American Coach of the Year award in 2006.

Independiente

In June 2008, Borghi returned to Argentina to become the 19th coach of Independiente in the last 10 years.[1] Borghi was unable to accomplish a winning campaign and resigned from the position on October 5, 2008 following, a 1-0 loss to Huracán. While at Independiente, Borghi managed the team for 17 matches, winning 4, drawing 9, and losing 4.[2]

Argentinos Juniors

In June 2009, he returned to Argentinos Juniors as their new manager following their dismal 2009 Clausura campaign, which had seen the club finish 20th (last) in the table, with only 2 wins from their 19 games.

After leading the club to a 6th place finish in the 2009 Apertura championship, Borghi and the Argentinos Juniors directors set the target of surpassing the 61 points from the 2007-08 season to avoid dropping further down the relegation table.

In the 2010 Clausura championship, Argentinos recorded a 6-3 win against Lanús in their second fixture of the campaign, but after five games this was their only win, with two draws and two defeats. Subsequently, Argentinos won their 6th fixture against Estudiantes de La Plata, which was the start of a 14-game unbeaten streak that saw Argentinos finish 1 point ahead of Estudiantes at the end of the season. The most significant result in this 14-game run was in their penultimate fixture against title challengers Independiente, which saw Argentinos come back from 1-3 down to win 4-3, which featured two goals in the final minutes of the game to seal the win and leave Argentinos top of the table with one game to play. They sealed their first domestic championship in 25 years with a 1-2 away win against Huracán in the Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó.

This championship was Borghi's fifth title with the club, considering the four he had won as a player in the mid 1980s. Borghi achieved a great turnaround in the fortunes of the team that had finished in last place only one year previously and the successful Clausura championship campaign secured qualification for the 2010 Copa Sudamericana and the 2011 Copa Libertadores. However, he decided to leave Argentinos at the end of the tournament.

Boca Juniors

On 21 May 2010 Boca Juniors signed Borghi as their new head coach.[3] His period in Boca was short however, as he resigned on November 17, after obtaining 17 points over 42 possible in his 14 official games.[4] His departure was subsequent to a 0–1 defeat to River Plate in the 2010 Apertura's Superclásico, that left Boca in the 15th league table position.

Chile

On February 24, 2011, he was presented by the Chilean Football Federation as the new coach, in replacement of Marcelo Bielsa, under a contract of 1.5 Million USD per year until the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup playoffs, to be extended automatically in case of classification.
