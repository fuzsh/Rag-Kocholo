        "text": "Gloria Swanson, star of the silent screen and famous for such classics as Sunset Boulevard, said of making movies in Queens in her autobiography, Swanson On Swanson, “Every day we drove across the Queensboro Bridge to the new studio in Astoria in the borough of Queens. It was certainly not another Hollywood. The place was full of free spirits, defectors, refugees, who were all trying to get away from Hollywood and its restrictions. There was a wonderful sense of revolution and innovation in the studio in Queens.”\n\nThis quote and the photographs that accompany this story are a sample of the gems that one can find at the exhibition, Lights, Camera, Astoria – a tribute to the history of motion picture making in Queens. Now in its final days at the Museum of the Moving Image, the exhibit features dozens of rare and never-before seen photographs culled from the archives of Kaufman Astoria Studios.\n\nOrganized by Barbara Miller, curator of the Collection and Exhibitions at the Museum of the Moving Image and Richard Koszarski, author of Hollywood on the Hudson, the exhibit takes visitors on a journey through the history of the studio, originally known as Famous Players-Lasky (Paramount Pictures) and reveals that movie making in Astoria is not a recent phenomenon but part of a rich tradition that stretches all the way back to the silent era.\n\nOne of the biggest names in the newly developing film industry of the early 20th century began with a Hungarian-born Jewish immigrant named Adolph Zukor. Working as a sucessful furrier, he invested in a penny arcade theater, or nickelodeon, on 14th Street in Manhattan. Through a viewfinder, patrons would turn a dial that quickly advanced photographs on a Rolodex type spool. These machines showed silent moving images; there were no real plots, no stars yet. And the people loved every second of it.\n\nBy 1912, Zukor teamed up with his partner, David Frohman, became big names in the penny arcade business and went on to form the Famous Players Film Company to produce and distribute full-length films. Their first success was a film called The Count of Monte Cristo, released in 1913. Zukor merged with another successful film company, the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Picture Play Company, which had made the first Hollywood movie, Squaw Man, directed by\n\nCecil B.\n\nDeMille.\n\nThe Lasky company had been started by Jesse Lasky, Lasky’s brother–in-law Samuel Goldwyn, Cecil B. DeMille and attorney Arthur Friend. The new company, launched in 1916, was called Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. In no time, they had eight film production companies under their wing, including a distribution company called Paramount Pictures, and were now the biggest players in the silent film business.\n\nIn 1920, they built their studio complex in Astoria, in the cheaper and roomier confines of Queens. Traditionally, a location anywhere in Queens would have been isolated and rural, but thanks to the Queensboro Bridge, which opened in 1909, the new complex was now only a short distance from the city’s theater district.\n\nBoth features and short films were filmed here by this company between 1920 and 1933.\n\nThe first two Marx Brothers films Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930) were filmed here, as was the first Sherlock Holmes movie, The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929). Some of the greats in silent films and early talkies worked here, including Rudolf Valentino, W.C. Fields, Dorothy Gish and Gloria Swanson.\n\nIn 1928, Lasky announced that the studio would soon close, to re-open as a sound stage for the first talkies. Their first talking motion picture was The Letter starring Jeanne Engels, filmed in 1929. Claudette Colbert, Edward G. Robinson, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Morgan and hundreds of other actors worked in the studio during the next several years.\n\nMore than 130 short and feature films were shot and produced here at the studios, now called either Astoria Studios or Paramount Studios, before all film production for Paramount was re-located to California in 1932.\n\nThe last film to be made at the Astoria Studios before World War II was a WPA film called One Third of a Nation. It was said that Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia tried to persuade Paramount to stay, but the warm climate and less expensive costs in California were too enticing for them to give up.\n\nIn 1942, the United States Army Signal Corps took over the studio for the making of training and indoctrination films for the war effort, and later for propaganda purposes. Officially, the facility was known as the Signal Corps Photographic Center, and later, the Army Pictorial Center (APC). The APC put out 300 films per year between 1942 and 1970, making it the largest film producer in the world. Many famous Hollywood directors and actors worked on these films, including director Frank Capra, and stars Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne. The Corps took up the main studio building as well as sound stages, storage facilities, a distribution center, barracks and a mess hall, from 34th to 36th Avenues and between 35th and 37th Streets.\n\nIn 1977 Sidney Lumet filmed The Wiz here, the first feature film to use the studios in years.\n\nIn 1978, the six contributing buildings that made up the studios were placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1982, real estate developer George Kaufman leased the Studios and re-named them Kaufman-Astoria Studios. Since then, the studios have been bright with activity. By the 1980s, film and television production came back to New York City. Hair, Goodfellas, Carlito’s Way, Moonstruck, Glengarry Glen Ross, The Verdict as well as many public television shows including Sesame Street and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? were all filmed here in Astoria. Other classic TV programs like The Cosby Show and Law and Order have also called Kaufman home.\n\nThe facility now has seven sound stages, including the newest, Stage K, which opened in 2010. On Dec. 3, 2013, a ribbon-cutting ceremony ushered in the opening of Kaufman Astoria Studios’ new backlot, the only one in New York City. It will enable filmmakers to shoot outdoor scenes and action sequences without having to go on location. The backlot necessitated the de-mapping of a section of 36th Street, between 34th and 35th Avenues.\n\nThe Museum of the Moving Image, 36-01 35th Ave. in Astoria, is open Wednesday through Sunday.
