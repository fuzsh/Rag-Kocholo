        "text": "Oregon is a beautiful state packed with history, exciting attractions, and plentiful restaurants. However, that should persuade you to visit its northern neighbor. That’s the state of Washington. It also has plenty to offer visitors. It would be best if you were lodging on the border to get the best of both states. Astoria Riverwalk Inn is a great place on the Oregon and Washington border. You’ll have easy access to one of Oregon’s best downtown areas, and close enough to see Washington State from your room at the Astoria Riverwalk Inn. Here are some things you can do and see when you cross the border from Oregon into Washington.\n\nFort Columbia Historical State Park\n\nOne of the closest state parks to Washington once you cross the Columbia River is Fort Columbia Historical State Park. It’s great for bird-watching, picnicking, hiking, and beach strolling. We recommend taking a self-guided interpretive historic walk that provides information about the fort and its history, such as early exploration, fur trade, and westward settlement.\n\nCape Disappointment Lighthouse\n\nDespite its name, this interesting attraction should interest those who love learning about lighthouses. It’s found at the mouth of the Columbia River. The lighthouse was originally lit in 1856 and then electrified in 1937. It was eventually automated in 1973, but it is still active today.\n\nCranberry Museum\n\nA little farther north, you will come across the Cranberry Museum in Long Beach. Participate in a self-guided bog tour, best experienced in September, just before the October harvest. The museum also offers a chance to learn about cranberries and how they are harvested, grown, and marketed.\n\nEnjoy Your Time In Washington"
