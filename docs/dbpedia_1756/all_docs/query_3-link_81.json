        "text": "One of Oregon’s best viewpoints is in the town of Astoria near the Oregon Coast. From the top of Coxcomb Hill, the Astoria Column and its surrounding park provide 360-degree views of Oregon’s northwestern corner from over 500 feet in elevation. To get even more height and a decent thigh workout, you can climb to the top of the Column and admire the scenery from its observation deck. Here is everything you need to know about visiting the Astoria Column.\n\nThe original vision for the Astoria Column began in the late 1800s with the idea of creating a monument near the Oregon Coast that would rival Paris’s Eiffel Tower. It was years before the project found funding and got off the ground, and the details changed as plans progressed.\n\nThe Astoria Column was finally built in 1926 as an observatory that commemorates the history of the Pacific Northwest as it was seen by the people of the early 20th century. Italian artist Attilio Pusterla designed the artwork that covers the Column. The striking images were created in the sgraffito style (from the Italian “to scratch”), which involves skillfully coloring and engraving layers of plaster.\n\nThe artwork of the Astoria Column depicts the arrival of Captain Robert Gray at the Columbia River, the Oregon Trail, and the creation of the railway to Astoria. From the information provided by the Friends of the Astoria Column, it’s clear that decorating the Column was a massive undertaking. Workmen completed the Column’s artwork using a mobile scaffold and sometimes even dangled from ropes attached to the Column’s observation deck.\n\nIn 1961, the park on Coxcomb Hill added a memorial to the Chinook tribe. Look for the large concrete sculpture of a ceremonial canoe on the west side of the park. The sculpture honors Chinook Chief Comcomly, who is remembered for his skills as a diplomat and navigator.\n\nCost and parking\n\nThere is a fee to visit the Astoria Column if you use the parking lot. It is $5/vehicle to enter and the parking pass is good for the year. There is a ticket booth at the parking lot entrance where you can purchase admission with cash or a credit card.\n\nThe parking lot is right next to the Astoria Column. It can get crowded on nice weekend days, particularly in summer. Consider coming early on busy days or parking toward the bottom of the hill and walking up.\n\nThere is no fee to visit the Astoria Column if you come on foot. See below for details on how to hike there.\n\nWhen to visit\n\nThe Astoria Column is fun to visit year-round although the views will be best on a clear day. Even if the weather is less than ideal, clouds and fog can create some moody and interesting landscapes.\n\nVisit after dark to see colorful lights illuminating the Astoria Column. Also, look for holiday lights extending from the top of the column toward the end of the year.\n\nThe park is open daily from 5 AM - 10 PM and the Astoria Column is open from dawn until dusk. Gift shop hours vary, but daytime hours are usually a safe bet.\n\nGeology of Astoria\n\nThe town of Astoria, including the Astoria Column, sits on a foundation of basalt that is thought to be part of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Like other Columbia River Basalts in Oregon, this rock formed when lava from fissures in northeastern Oregon and southwest Washington traveled an incredible distance to reach the Pacific Coast.\n\nFrom the 500-foot vantage point at Coxcomb Hill, look for the basalt peak of Saddle Mountain, the highest point in the Coastal Range.\n\nAcross the Youngs River, there is a much different geologic story. The land around Warrenton, Oregon, extending to the Pacific Ocean is mostly flat and made of sedimentary deposits from the Columbia River.\n\nHiking the Cathedral Tree Trail to the Astoria Column\n\nDistance: 3 miles out and back\n\nElevation gain: 500 feet\n\nDifficulty: Easy with some steep uphill sections\n\nDog-friendly: Yes, leashed dogs welcome on the trail\n\nPass required: None, parking is free if you begin at the bottom of the hill\n\nMy favorite way to hike the Cathedral Tree Trail is to start at the bottom and hike up to the Astoria Column on Coxcomb Hill. There is a natural resting point once you make it up the hill with incredible views. Plus, the way back will be downhill.\n\nBegin at the Richard Fenscak Cathedral Tree Trail Trailhead on Irving Ave in Astoria. The trail climbs up Coxcomb Hill through a forest of Sitka spruce, cedars, and Western hemlock. Watch for signs at trail junctions as you go. There are several intersecting trails in the area and you’ll want to stay on the Cathedral Tree Trail to reach the Astoria Column.\n\nOn your way, look for the Cathedral tree, a massive 300-year-old Sitka spruce. This ancient tree survived the damage caused by an unusually strong windstorm in 2007. Continue uphill on the dirt trail until you reach a small set of stairs to the top of Coxcomb Hill. You will see the Astoria Column and magnificent views in all directions.\n\nLook for the trailhead at:\n\n2800 Irving Ave, Astoria, OR 97103\n\nIf you begin at the Astoria Column, look for the Cathedral Tree trailhead near the park entrance. Head down the stairs and follow the trail for about a half mile to reach the Cathedral Tree.\n\nEnjoy your visit to the Astoria Column!\n\nWith love,\n\nEmma\n\nLooking for more to do at the Coast?
