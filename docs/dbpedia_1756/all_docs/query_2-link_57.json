        "text": "A half-hour subway ride from Manhattan, Astoria, Queens is a conveniently located enclave of highly-rated restaurants and beloved mom-and-pop shops with a long history of celebrity origin stories (Cyndi Lauper, David Schwimmer, Tony Bennett, Christopher Walken), and a large Greek population.\n\nThe neighborhood thrives with budget-friendly restaurants, and independent boutiques, including record stores, that make shopping small easy.\n\nRide the Queens-bound N/W train to discover hidden gems, as well as one of the best Greek restaurants in all of New York.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Full Astoria, Queens neighborhood guide\n\nOnly 15 minutes from midtown, the Museum of the Moving Image is one of the city’s most dynamic institutions. Rubbing elbows with Kaufman Astoria Studios, it includes a three-story extension that features a state-of-the-art 267-seat cinema and expanded gallery spaces. Meanwhile, the museum’s “Behind the Screen” exhibit examines every step of the filmmaking process, with artifacts from more than 1,000 different productions, and 14 classic (playable!) video games, including Asteroids, Ms. Pac-Man and Space Invaders. Muppet fans should check out the new and permanent Jim Henson exhibit, too.\n\nAt this regal eatery and bar, you’ll be treated like royalty—especially on Tuesday nights, when beer, wine and well drinks are two for one. (Trivia goes down at 7pm, too.) As for the bites, you can’t go wrong with the mussels provençal or the signature bourbon BBQ burger with a side of thick—and addictive—hand-cut fries.\n\nAdvertising\n\nConsiderably Astoria’s best kept secret, this old-fashioned jazz bar checks off all the boxes. It boasts a great cocktail, beer and wine list, has a warm and cozy atmosphere, plus incredible live music (with no cover!). On Monday nights, jam out to tunes provided by Adam Platt Trio, get funky with the Subtonic Three on Tuesday at 9pm and get into the groove with guest DJs on Friday and Saturday evenings. In case you were wondering, the haunt gets its name from Nick Cave’s heartbreaking hit “I Let Love In,” which is one of the owner’s (Evan Rumeliotis) favorites.\n\nQueens—a brewery hotbed for German immigrants before Prohibition—rejuvenates its sudsy past with this 5,000-square-foot microbrewery and tasting room. Sip a stein in the 25-seat taproom, handsomely appointed with mahogany walls, red oak communal tables and hanging metallic lamps. Once you've had your fill, take your favorite brew to go in a growler. A stage for live performances adjoining the tasting room features live acts, reflecting the owner's passion for music (the brewery's name references a part of a guitar's neck).\n\nAdvertising\n\nThere is a ton of Greek restaurant competition in Astoria, Queens, and Taverna Kyclades, which opened its original location in 1996, is among the most popular. Its breezy corner spot in its original neighborhood has tons of sidewalk seats under crisp blue awnings, a breezy interior and all manner of seafood plates, plus saganaki, spanakopita, lamb, steak and kebabs on the long, crowd-pleasing menu.\n\nAstoria actually has the city’s largest pool at 330 feet long—that’s because it was built as a model for 10 other NYC pools under the Robert Moses administration. It was also used by the U.S. Swim and Diving teams during the 1936 summer Olympic Trials and again in 1964. There are two fountains at the east end of the pool that spray water 25 feet in the air that were uses as Olympic torches then. The pool lies in the shadow of the midtown skyline—the RFK and Hell Gate Bridges tower can be seen from here—but because it was designed to hold 3,000, it can get a little bit crowded. It is, as always, free to the public.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNeed a laugh? You'll have plenty at this Astoria venue, which offers primarily comedy events as well as the occasional storytelling and poetry night. If you're interested in learning a new skill, the versatile spot is known to host unique classes like how to take the perfect selfie? Apparently it requires more effort than point and shoot!\n\nHome to the oldest and largest pool in the city, this gorgeous 59.96-acre park along the East River also boasts tennis courts, a track, walking trails, basketball courts and multiple playgrounds. For something a bit more leisurely, reading by the water is also a popualr Astorian pastime. When you go, make sure to snap a photo of what is perhaps New York's most beautiful overpass: Hellgate Bridge.\n\nAdvertising\n\nSearching for the perfect date-night spot? This magical, brick-and-wood gastropub is a great choice. Whether you’re interested in plowing through the joint’s artisan cocktail list including fruity sips like the Bonnie Punch or its dinner menu comprising hearty, laid-back fare (try the dry-aged burger topped with with crispy pork belly), you’re guaranteed a good time. Make sure to check out the spot on Thursday evening to check out some live music from local talents.\n\nIndependent bookstores are sadly rare in Queens, but Astoria Bookshop, which opened in 2013, comes to the rescue to deliver a much-needed dose of lit to the neighborhood. Though on the small side, there’s a solid selection of fiction, non-fiction and children’s books, and staffers are happy to hunt down anything you can’t find. Events like readings, storytelling sessions and book clubs—many of which highlight local writers–prove that Queens is an artsy borough, too.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhen sculptor (and landscape architect, and theatrical-set and furniture designer) Isamu Noguchi opened his Queens museum in 1985, he was the first living artist in the U.S. to establish such an institution. It occupies a former photo-engraving plant across the street from the studio he had occupied since the 1960s to be closer to stone and metal suppliers along Vernon Boulevard. The entire building was designed by Noguchi to be a meditative oasis amid its gritty, industrial setting. Twelve galleries and a garden are populated with Noguchi’s sculptures; also on display are drawn, painted and collaged studies, architectural models, and stage and furniture designs.\n\nFern Botanica is a woman-owned shop and florist with a mind for sustainability and eco-friendly products. It provides incredible floral arrangements and products for events, including weddings in Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Hudson Valley, and Long Island.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIf you enjoy listening to albums from start to finish (with a little break to flip it over in between), then a trip to this record shop is a must. The store carries a solid selection of new and used vinyl from various decades, and carries all the tools and equipment necessary for listening to music the way it was meant to be heard at home (turntables and home audio equipment abound in-store).\n\nThe hippest neighborhood in Queens has a literal Highwater mark. Bright and breezy, the Highwater is a tropical oasis for both the down-to-earth and the down-to-fuck. At the Highwater you feel like you’re exhaling the whole time. It’s liquid yoga.\n\nAdvertising\n\nZero-waste wellness shop and refillery Earth & Me was born with a green-focused goal in mind: “sustainability, quality, and affordability shouldn’t be mutually exclusive,” owner Kayli Kunkel writes on the site. And that’s exactly what she’s accomplished with her Astoria-based shops. Located on Steinway Street and 31st street, both outposts boast an expansive collection of sustainably-made goods. Think bamboo straws, body cream, conditioner, recycled glass pitchers, and even toilet paper. While you can buy pre-packaged goods, with an on-site refillery, Earth & Me encourages customers to bring their old containers and stock up that way. They even have free donated bottles available.\n\nIn 1986, artists and activists created this 4.5-acre city park over a landfill. Now, it hosts large-scale sculpture exhibits year-round, and is one of the few locations in the city specifically designated for artists to create outdoor works. The splendid Queens space looks out over the Manhattan skyline and is open 365 days a year, offering music and dance performances, movie screenings, yoga and more.\n\nAdvertising\n\nShopping addicts, beware: It will be impossible to leave this trendy store without splurging on new duds for fall. Currently, the modern boutique is hawking vegan-leather Matt & Nat bags, cozy sweaters, and Queens-branded baseball caps and hoodies with slogans like astoria vibes only."
