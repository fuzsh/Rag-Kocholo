        "text": "The Astoria-Megler Bridge provides a 360-degree view of container ships, the coast range, the mouth of the Columbia River, and historic Astoria homes. It looks like a scene out of a movie and is a must-see experience for visitors from around the world. You may be wondering why it’s called “The Bridge to Nowhere,” and what’s on the other side.\n\nRich History\n\nCompleted in 1966, the 4.1 mile steel bridge is the longest continuous truss bridge in North America and the final link in the scenic Mexico-to-Canada highway. Many critics dubbed it “a bridge to nowhere,” because they thought it to be too remote of a location to justify the expense.\n\nThe Other Side\n\nThe Astoria-Megler Bridge connects Oregon and Washington, and the Washington side of the bridge is extraordinary. Starting with historic Fort Columbia and continuing north all the way to the historic village of Oysterville, the Long Beach Peninsula is a recreational wonderland. With 28 miles of expansive silver sand beach, two working lighthouses, six State Parks, including one of the most visited State Park in all of Washington, Cape Disappointment, it’s no wonder it’s a favorite place to relax, eat, play, and stay.\n\n,Many people don’t realize that the Lewis and Clark National Historic Park continues on the Washington side of the Columbia River with several important landmarks and installation, such as the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, Discovery Trail (8.5 mile long paved coastal trail), Middle Village Station Camp, Fort Columbia State Park, bronze sculptures of Clark’s Tree and Lewis and Clark, and much more.\n\nLong Beach Peninsula is always fun. Favorite activities include beachcombing, kite flying, fishing, kayaking, biking the Discovery Trail, hiking, and shopping. There is always something going on with a full calander of events year around. Wildlife is abundant throughout Washington’s Peninsula so bring your camera. There are plenty of choices for lodging and dining at the source, with lots of ultra fresh seafood dishes. “Nowhere” may very well become your favorite place to visit."
