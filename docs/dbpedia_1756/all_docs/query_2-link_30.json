        "text": "Astoria Park Alliance will present the box office smash hit Barbie, as our sixth annual Spring movie screening in Astoria Park.\n\n\"APA Presents Movies Under the Stars\" was born out of a desire to schedule a screening for the late spring, with its perfect weather for a night in the park. A weekend evening was specifically targeted along with a title that would be appealing to an adult audience.\n\nThe Alliance hopes to replicate the old-time drive-in-without-the-drive neighborhood feel that brings a magical sensation to the park.\n\nThe Astoria Park Alliance is able to offer free public programming to the community thanks to generous donations made through PayPal on our website and at our fundraisers.\n\nThe movie will be screened on the Great Lawn of Astoria Park, overlooking the sunset across the East River. It is scheduled to begin at sundown, which is generally around 8:15 pm. Moviegoers are encouraged to bring their own blankets and picnics for the movie night that's turned into an annual tradition for the Astoria Park Alliance.\n\nPlease note: All Astoria Park movie goers are officially deemed Kenough… especially if you show up in a white faux fur."
