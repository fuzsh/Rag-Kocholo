We recommend trying out a little of everything! Below are a few of our favorite places to eat and drink.\n\nAstoria has some of the best restaurants on the Oregon Coast with Pacific Northwest-inspired menus featuring seafood and pub fare.\n\nFor breakfast in Astoria, there are several good coffee shops, but Coffee Girl on Pier 39 has the best view. At the end of the pier, go through the old cannery to find this cozy breakfast spot right on the riverfront where you can watch the cargo ships go by while sipping a frothy cappuccino. We also recently enjoyed a delicious Scandinavian breakfast at Broder Strand.\n\nFresh fish is a popular choice for dining in Astoria. Try the highly rated South Bay Wild Fish House for the local catch of the day. Also, the very popular Bowpicker’s Fish & Chips dishes out fresh fried fish from a boat (like a food truck, but a boat instead…food boat?). Surf 2 Soul food truck is crushing the chicken & waffles and serves up southern comfort foods like po’ boys, grits and biscuits in downtown Astoria on 11th and Duane St.\n\nBusu is a highly praised Oregon Coast restaurant in Astoria with a walk-up window offering Japanese takeout dishes that change regularly.\n\nFor dining with a view in Astoria, Bridgewater Bistro sits right on the Columbia River and offers a Northwest menu of local, fresh options in a historic building.\n\nIn the mood for something sweet? Stop for ice cream at Frite & Scoop on the Astoria Riverwalk or pick up some pastries from Blue Scorcher Bakery.\n\nFresh food and grocery options include the Astoria Co-Op, a locally owned grocery store with an impressive deli and specialty foods. For local, fresh Oregon produce and other farmer’s market vendors, the Astoria Sunday Market operates outside from May-October on 12th Street.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to dining in Astoria, Oregon, so don’t be afraid to explore the area and find your own favorite spot. Marine, Commercial and Duane Street are dotted with restaurants, along with vintage stores, gift shops and galleries.\n\nBreweries in Astoria, Oregon\n\nSome of the best breweries on the Oregon Coast are right here in Astoria, and there are several spots to choose from, many with a view of the river.\n\nFort George Brewery in downtown Astoria is a top pick for local Oregon craft beer. In colder months, sit upstairs and enjoy the view with wood-fired pizza and live music. During summer, sit outside or head to the Beer Pier (70 W. Marine Dr.), where you can sit outside and watch the sunset with a beer on weekends from Memorial Day through Labor Day. There’s also a food truck and some tables next to the water.\n\nFormer Fort-Georgers have opened the new Obelisk Beer Co. in the old Blitz-Weinhard building on Bond Street in downtown Astoria.\n\nBuoy Beer Company unfortunately suffered a partial building collapse in June 2022, so the taproom is currently operating out of the Astoria Food Hub.\n\nRogue Public House is located on Pier 39 and Astoria Brewing Company is right on the Astoria Riverwalk trolley line.\n\nConsidered one of the best breweries in the state, Breakside Brewing has opened up a location in Astoria with a raw seafood menu and champagne in addition to their stellar beers.\n\nBars in Astoria, Oregon\n\nThe Merry Time Bar and the Labor Temple (come back for breakfast) are classic Astoria watering holes that often have live music.\n\n🍹 Prefer a fancy cocktail? Get a giant Bloody Mary with a mini meal on top at Inferno Lounge on the Astoria riverfront or relax with a skillfully crafted concoction in the dimly-lit cozy lounge of Blaylock’s Whiskey Bar.\n\nWeather in Astoria, Oregon\n\nThe weather in Astoria is generally cool (50s-60s F) and damp with frequent rain throughout the year, with the exception of July and August. Temperatures rarely get too hot in summer with highs in the 60s-70s. Lows dip down into the 30s in winter but snow is rare. Spring and Autumn are a mix of sunny and rainy days.\n\nSeptember and early October can be a beautiful time to visit the Oregon Coast with lingering warm days from summer and cooler nights as autumn arrives.\n\nLike much of the Oregon Coast, it is frequently wet, windy or cold (or all 3!) in Astoria. It’s a good idea to wear layers and bring rain gear unless you’re visiting in the peak of summer.\n\nTide Tables for Astoria and the Oregon Coast\n\nThere are two low tides and two high tides every day on Oregon’s coastline. Astoria also sits at the mouth of the Columbia River and the tides affect river levels more than 100 miles inland from the ocean to Bonneville Dam in the Gorge.\n\nFor your safety, be aware of the tide schedule before boating or heading out to beaches and always keep an eye on the water level. Use extreme caution in rocky areas near the water, where sneaker waves can (and do) strike.\n\nAnnual Events and Festivals in Astoria, Oregon\n\nLooking for more fun things to do in Astoria?
