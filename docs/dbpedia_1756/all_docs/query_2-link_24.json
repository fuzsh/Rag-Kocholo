        "text": "A new reigning 1960s international sex symbol took to the cinematic throne as soon as Raquel Welch emerged from the sea in her purposely depleted, furry prehistoric bikini. Tantalizingly wet with her garb clinging to all the right amazonian places, Eine Million Jahre vor unserer Zeit (1966), if nothing else, captured the hearts and libidos of modern men (not to mention their teenage sons) while producing THE most definitive and best-selling pin-up poster of that time.\n\nShe was born Jo Raquel Tejada on September 5, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois, the first of three children of Bolivian-born Armando Carlos Tejada, an aerospace engineer, and his wife, Josephine Sarah (Hall). The family moved to San Diego, California (her father was transferred) when Raquel was only two. Taking dance lessons as a youngster, she grew up to be quite a knockout and nailed a number of teen beauty titles (\"Miss Photogenic,\" \"Miss La Jolla,\" \"Miss Contour,\" \"Miss Fairest of the Fair\" and \"Miss San Diego\").\n\nWith her sights set on theater arts, she studied at San Diego State College on a scholarship starting in 1958 and married her first husband, high school sweetheart James Welch, the following year. They had two children: Damon Welch (born 1959), who later became an actor/production assistant, and actress Tahnee Welch (born 1961). Tahnee went on to take advantage of her own stunning looks as an actress, most notably with her prime role in Cocoon (1985).\n\nOff campus, she became a local TV weather girl in San Diego and eventually quit college. Following the end of her marriage in 1962 (although Raquel and James Welch didn't divorce until 1964), she packed up her two children and moved to Dallas, Texas, where she modeled for Neiman-Marcus and worked as a barmaid for a time.\n\nRegrouping, she returned to California and made the rounds of film/TV auditions. She found work providing minor but sexy set decoration on the small screen (Verliebt in eine Hexe (1964), McHale's Navy (1962) and Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962)) as well as the large screen (Elvis Presley's König der heißen Rhythmen (1964) and Doris Day's Bitte nicht stören! (1965)). Caught in the midst of the \"beach party\" craze, it's not surprising to find out that her first major film role was A Swingin' Summer (1965), which concentrated more on musical guests The Righteous Brothers and Gary Lewis & The Playboys than on Welch's outstanding assets. But 20th Century-Fox certainly took notice and signed her up.\n\nWith her very first film under contract (actually, she was on loan out to Britain's Hammer Studios at the time), she took on Eine Million Jahre vor unserer Zeit (1966) (the remake of Tumak, der Herr des Urwalds (1940), in the role originated by Carole Landis), and the rest is history. Welch remained an international celebrity in her first few years of stardom. In England, she was quite revealing as the deadly sin representing \"lust\" for the comedy team of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in their vehicle Mephisto '68 (1967), and as the title secret agent in the spy spoof Feuerdrache (1967). In Italy, she gained some exposure in primarily mediocre vehicles opposite such heartthrobs as Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nBack in the U.S., however, she caused quite a stir in her groundbreaking sex scenes with black athlete Jim Brown in the \"spaghetti western\" 100 Gewehre (1969), and as the transgender title role in the unfathomable Myra Breckinridge - Mann oder Frau? (1970). Adapted from Gore Vidal's novel, she created some unwelcome notoriety by locking horns with septuagenarian diva Mae West on the set. The instant cult movie certainly didn't help Welch's attempt at being taking seriously as an actress.\n\nBox office bombs abounded. Try as she might in such films as Round Up (1972) and Wild Party (1975), which drew some good reviews for her, her sexy typecast gave her little room to breathe. With determination, however, she partly offset this with modest supporting roles in larger ensemble pieces. She showed definite spark and won a Golden Globe for the swashbuckler Die drei Musketiere (1973), and appeared in the mystery thriller Sheila (1973). She planned on making a comeback in Die Straße der Ölsardinen (1982), even agreeing to appear topless (which she had never done before), but was suddenly fired during production without notice. She sued MGM for breach of contract and ultimately won a $15 million settlement, but it didn't help her film career and only helped to label her as trouble on a set.\n\nTV movies became a positive milieu for Welch as she developed sound vehicles for herself such as Die neun Tage wandert (1980) and Das Recht zu sterben (1987), earning a Golden Globe nomination for the latter project. She also found a lucrative avenue pitching beauty products in infomercials and developing exercise videos (such as Jane Fonda).\n\nWelch took advantage of her modest singing and dancing abilities by performing in splashy Las Vegas showroom acts and starring in such plausible stage vehicles as \"Woman of the Year\" and \"Victor/Victoria\". She spoofed her own image on occasion, most memorably on Seinfeld (1989). Into the millennium, she co-starred in the Hispanic-oriented TV series American Family (2002) and the short-lived comedies Welcome to the Captain (2008) and Date My Dad (2017), along with the movies Tortilla Soup - Die Würze des Lebens (2001), Natürlich blond (2001), Forget About It (2006) and How to Be a Latin Lover (2017).\n\nHer three subsequent marriages were to producer/agent Patrick Curtis (who produced her TV special, Raquel-Welch-Show (1970)), director André Weinfeld (who directed her in several fitness videos), and pizza parlor owner Richie Palmer, who was 14 years her junior. All these unions ended in divorce.\n\nShe died at 2:25 a.m. on February 15, 2023, aged 82, at her Los Angeles home after suffering a cardiac arrest. She had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nSylvester Stallone is an athletically built, dark-haired American actor/screenwriter/director/producer, the movie fans worldwide have been flocking to see Stallone's films for over 40 years, making \"Sly\" one of Hollywood's biggest-ever box office draws.\n\nSylvester Stallone was born on July 6, 1946, in New York's gritty Hell's Kitchen, to Jackie Stallone (née Labofish), an astrologer, and Frank Stallone, a beautician and hairdresser. His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother's heritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The young Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and The University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he struggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core Randy - Die Sexabenteuer des Sylvester Stallone (1970), the thriller Klute (1971) and the comedy Bananas (1971). He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor Henry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film Brooklyn Blues - Das Gesetz der Gosse (1974). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named \"Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\" in the Roger Corman-produced Frankensteins Todesrennen (1975). However, Stallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an actor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in Cleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given the \"million to one opportunity\" to challenge for the heavyweight title. Rocky (1976) became the stuff of cinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially successful movie series in history! Whilst full credit is wholly deserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from fellow cast members Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young, and director John G. Avildsen gave the film an emotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived on his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure Hollywood's hottest new star.\n\nStallone followed Rocky (1976) with F.I.S.T. - Ein Mann geht seinen Weg (1978), loosely based on the life of Teamsters boss \"Jimmy Hoffa\", and Vorhof zum Paradies (1978) before pulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the sequel Rocky II (1979). The second outing for the \"Italian Stallion\" wasn't as powerful or successful as the first \"Rocky\", however, it still produced strong box office. Subsequent films Nachtfalken (1981) and Flucht oder Sieg (1981) failed to ignite with audiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory with Rocky III - Das Auge des Tigers (1982) and a fearsome opponent in \"Clubber Lang\" played by muscular ex-bodyguard Mr. T. The third \"Rocky\" installment far outperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone retired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another series was about to commence for the busy actor.\n\nThe character of Green Beret \"John Rambo\" was the creation of Canadian-born writer David Morrell, and his novel was adapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in Rambo (1982), also starring Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy. The movie was a surprise hit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the Vietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public's psyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and a sequel soon followed with Rambo II - Der Auftrag (1985), which drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the film's plot line about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam. But they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \"John Rambo's\" second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and cemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave of amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky Balboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a Soviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \"Ivan Drago\" played by curt Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985). The fourth outing was somewhat controversial with \"Rocky\" fans, as violence levels seemed excessive compared to previous \"Rocky\" films, especially with the savage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, at the hands of the unstoppable \"Siberian Express\".\n\nStallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films that met with a mixed reception from his fans. Die City-Cobra (1986) was a clumsy mess, Over the Top: Mein Daddy schlägt sie alle (1987) was equally mediocre, Rambo III (1988) saw Rambo take on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film Tango und Cash (1989) just did not quite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there was chemistry between Stallone and co-star Kurt Russell.\n\nPhiladelphia's favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his fifth screen outing in Rocky V (1990) tackling Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter Tommy Morrison, the great-nephew of screen legend John Wayne. Sly quickly followed with the lukewarm comedy Oscar - Vom Regen in die Traufe (1991), the painfully unfunny Stop! Oder meine Mami schießt! (1992), the futuristic action film Demolition Man (1993), and the comic book-inspired Judge Dredd (1995). Interestingly, Stallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he had been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more dramatically challenging role in the intriguing Cop Land (1997), also starring Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. It isn't a classic of the genre, but Cop Land (1997) certainly surprised many critics with Stallone's understated performance. Stallone then lent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story Antz (1998), reprised the role made famous by Michael Caine in a terrible remake of Get Carter - Die Wahrheit tut weh (2000), climbed back into a race car for Driven (2001), and guest-starred as the \"Toymaker\" in the third chapter of the immensely popular \"Spy Kids\" film series, Spy Kids 3: Game Over (2003). Showing that age had not wearied his two most popular series, Stallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky Balboa to star in, well, what else but Rocky Balboa (2006), and Vietnam veteran John Rambo (2008) will reappear after a 20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.\n\nLove him or loathe him, Sylvester Stallone has built an enviable and highly respected career in Hollywood, plus, he has considerably influenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film characters.\n\nWith an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who would have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a small European village would become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, marry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the Governor of California!?\n\nThe amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to riches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.\n\nUp until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Mister Universum (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy Kaktus Jack (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie Die Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).\n\nWhat Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan, der Barbar (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan der Zerstörer (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Phantom Kommando (1985), Der City Hai (1986), Predator (1987), Running Man (1987) and Red Heat (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Twins - Zwillinge (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular Total Recall - Die totale Erinnerung (1990) and \"feel good\" Kindergarten Cop (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners.\n\nRemarkably, his next film Last Action Hero (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Versprochen ist versprochen (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Eraser (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of End of Days - Nacht ohne morgen (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale The 6th Day (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Collateral Damage - Zeit der Vergeltung (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.\n\nIt was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3: Rebellion der Maschinen (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date.\n\nSchwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.\n\nIn October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.\n\nSchwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to Welcome to the Jungle (2003), In 80 Tagen um die Welt (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in The Expendables 2 (2012), The Last Stand (2013), Escape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator - Genisys (2015).\n\nJonathan Southworth Ritter was born in Burbank, California, on September 17, 1948. He was the son of legendary country singer/actor Tex Ritter (born Woodward Maurice Ritter) and his wife, actress Dorothy Fay (née Dorothy Fay Southworth). The couple married in 1941 and had their first child, Tom Ritter, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. John was destined to follow in his parents footsteps. He was enrolled at Hollywood High School where he was student body president.\n\nAfter graduation from high school, he attended the University of Southern California where he majored in Psychology and minored in Architecture. His first appearance on TV was in 1966 as a contestant on The Dating Game (1965) where he won a vacation to Lake Havasu, Arizona. After making his very first cameo appearance, he was induced to join an acting class taught by Nina Foch. He changed his major to Theater Arts, graduating in 1971 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Drama. He also studied acting with Stella Adler at the Harvey Lembeck Comedy Workshop. Between 1968 and 1969, he appeared in a series of stage plays in England, Scotland, Holland and in Germany.\n\nHis TV debut came playing a campus revolutionary on Dan Oakland (1970) which starred Burt Reynolds and Norman Fell, who later starred with him on Herzbube mit zwei Damen (1976). Then he appeared as \"Reverend Matthew Fordwick\" on Die Waltons (1972). He continued making more guest appearances on Medical Center (1969), M*A*S*H (1972), The Bob Newhart Show (1972), Die Straßen von San Francisco (1972), Einsatz in Manhattan (1973), Rhoda (1974) and Oh Mary (1970). While working on Die Waltons (1972), he received word that his legendary father had passed away, just a day after New Year's Day in 1974. The following year, in late 1975, ABC picked up the rights for a new series based on a British sitcom, Ein Mann im Haus (1973). Ritter beat out 50 people, including a young Billy Crystal, to get a major role. The first pilot was trashed, and in order for it to be improved, Joyce DeWitt, an unknown actress, played the role of \"Janet Wood\", along with Susan Lanier as the dumb blonde, \"Chrissy Snow\". It did better than the first pilot, but the producers still needed a change and Suzanne Somers came to the show at the very last minute to play \"Chrissy\". The series, Herzbube mit zwei Damen (1976), was born. When it debuted as a mid-season replacement, it became a ratings hit. It focused mainly on his character, \"Jack Tripper\", a chef who pretended to be gay in order to share an apartment with two attractive ladies.\n\nBefore playing \"Jack Tripper\" on the small screen, he also made his box office debut in the movie Nickelodeon (1976). Two years later, he worked with his close friend, Jenny Sullivan, in Breakfast in Bed (1977), and the following year, played \"Pres. Chet Roosevelt\" in the movie 1998 - Die vier Milliarden Dollar Show (1979). Also in 1977, he and his brother emceed the Annual United Cerebral Palsy Telethon which he continued to support for over 15 years. He also became more popular with movies such as Ein wahrer Held (1980) and Sie haben alle gelacht (1981). In 1980, when Herzbube mit zwei Damen (1976) was sold into syndication, the show became a ratings phenomenon. At the height of Ritter's popularity, he won a Golden Globe in 1983 for Best Performance by an Actor after being nominated twice for Best TV Actor in a Musical-Comedy Series and, one year later, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor In a Comedy Series after being nominated twice. By its eighth season, the show began to drop in the ratings and was canceled in 1984. After cancellation, he starred in its spin-off, called Three's a Crowd (1984), also starring Mary Cadorette, but it lasted for only one season.\n\nHis first animated movie was that of a man turning into a dragon, whose job was to defeat \"Ommendon\" in The Flight of Dragons (1982). The following year, he came back to series television as \"Detective Harry Hooperman\" in the comedy/drama, Inspektor Hooperman (1987) for which he was nominated for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe in 1988 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. He also won a People's Choice Award for this role. He continued doing more box-office films such as Skin Deep - Männer haben's auch nicht leicht (1989), in which he played a womanizing, alcoholic writer whose life seemed to be falling apart at the seams. In the movies, So ein Satansbraten (1990), and Ein Satansbraten kommt selten Allein (1991), he played the surrogate father of a rebellious little boy who wrought havoc on the family. He also worked on Noises Off! - Der nackte Wahnsinn (1992) and Stay Tuned - Mit der Fernbedienung in die Hölle (1992) before returning to another TV sitcom called Staatsaffären (1992) that also starred Billy Bob Thornton. The show had well-written scripts but failed to reach a massive audience which led to its cancellation in 1995. While he was working on Staatsaffären (1992), he played \"Ward Nelson\" on North (1994). Then, he had the opportunity to work with Billy Bob Thornton, in the movie Sling Blade - Auf Messers Schneide (1996), in which Ritter played the gay manager of a department store. He also provided the voice of \"Clifford\" in Clifford der große rote Hund (2000). He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award 4 times in a row, totaling seven Emmy nominations in his 35-year career. In 1999, he was also nominated for an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series playing the role of \"George Madison\" on an episode of Ally McBeal (1997).\n\nSoon afterwards, he landed his last television role in Meine wilden Töchter (2002), based on the popular book. On this sitcom he played \"Paul Hennessey\", a loving, yet rational dad, who laid down the ground rules for his three children and dealt with such topics as curfews, sex, drugs, getting arrested, etc. The show was a ratings winner in its first season and won a People's Choice Award for Best New Comedy and also won for Favorite Comedy Series by the Family Awards. While working on \"8 Simple Rules,\" he also starred in his second-to-last film, Manhood (2003). That same year, he felt ill, while rehearsing on set, and was taken across the street to Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, where he was mistakenly treated for a heart attack, only to be diagnosed with an aortic dissection, which was a tear in the wall of the aorta. He underwent surgery and died on September 11, 2003, just six days shy of his 55th birthday. Before his death, he starred in his last film, Bad Santa (2003), which was dedicated to his memory. In the years that he worked, John Ritter was a brilliant comedian and a passionate actor, who wanted to make everybody laugh. Shortly before his death, his eldest son, Jason Ritter, was casted in the role of \"Kevin\" in Die himmlische Joan (2003), a drama that lasted only 2 seasons.\n\nAlfredo James \"Al\" 'Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema's most vibrant decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.\n\nHe was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and Sal Pacino. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.\n\nAfter appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel Horovitz's \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in Panik im Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Ich, Natalie (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in Der Pate (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.\n\nCoppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Hundstage (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the \"Best Actor\" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with ... und Gerechtigkeit für alle (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like Cruising (1980) and Daddy! Daddy! Fünf Nervensägen und ein Vater (1982).\n\nPacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love - Melodie des Todes (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.\n\nReturning to the Corleones, Pacino made Der Pate 3 (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie und Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Der Duft der Frauen (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.\n\nThe next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito's Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Al Pacino's Looking for Richard (1996). During this period, City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and Im Auftrag des Teufels (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in Insider (1999) and An jedem verdammten Sonntag (1999).\n\nIn the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean's 13 (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Engel in Amerika (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie Ein Leben für den Tod (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.\n\nNever wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo. His romantic history includes Jill Clayburgh, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Carole Mallory, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with \"Godfather\" co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila Solá, who is 36 years his junior.\n\nAs of 2022, Pacino is 82-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and continues to appear regularly in film.\n\nOne of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood's best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Der weiße Hai (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.\n\nSteven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin' (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature. Amblin' also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as E.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Duell (1971), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling's Wo alle Wege enden (1969), Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969) and Tödliche Trennung (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.\n\nSpielberg's first major directorial effort was Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: Der weiße Hai (1975). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), and followed that effort with Mit einem Bein im Kittchen (1980), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt Russell/Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981), with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was Poltergeist (1982), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story E.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reese's Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\" and \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up \"Raiders\" with Indiana Jones und der Tempel des Todes (1984), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as Die Goonies (1985), and was the brains behind the little monsters in Gremlins - Kleine Monster (1984). He also produced the cartoon Feivel, der Mauswanderer (1986), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster Zurück in die Zukunft (1985), which made Michael J. Fox an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book Die Farbe Lila (1985), with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed Das Reich der Sonne (1987), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.\n\nThe late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film Falsches Spiel mit Roger Rabbit (1988). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed Always - Der Feuerengel von Montana (1989) as well as Indiana Jones und der letzte Kreuzzug (1989), and Zurück in die Zukunft II (1989). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Dad (1989), with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson, which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series Tiny Toon Abenteuer (1990), Animaniacs (1993), Pinky und der Brain (1995), Freakazoid! (1995), Pinky, Elmyra & der Brain (1998), Hund mit Familie (1993) and Toonsylvania (1998). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as In einem Land vor unserer Zeit (1988), Vier Dinos in New York (1993), Casper (1995) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of Flintstones: Die Familie Feuerstein (1994), where he was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed Hook (1991) and produced such films as the cute fantasy Joe gegen den Vulkan (1990) and Feivel, der Mauswanderer im wilden Westen (1991). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller Arachnophobia (1990), Zurück in die Zukunft III (1990) and Gremlins 2 - Die Rückkehr der kleinen Monster (1990). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed Jurassic Park (1993), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed Schindlers Liste (1993), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.\n\nAs a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as Die Maske des Zorro (1998), Men in Black (1997) and Deep Impact (1998). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: Der Soldat James Ryan (1998), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Shakespeare in Love (1998).\n\nSpielberg produced a series of films, including Evolution (2001), Das Geisterschloss (1999) and Shrek - Der tollkühne Held (2001). he also produced two sequels to Jurassic Park (1993), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: Band of Brothers: Wir waren wie Brüder (2001), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director's chair for A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.\n\nSpielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series SeaQuest (1993), an anthology series entitled Unglaubliche Geschichten (1985), created the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994). Spielberg, if you haven't noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called A Holocaust szemei (2000). With all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.\n\nSigourney Weaver has created a host of memorable characters, both dramatic and comic, ranging from Ripley in Alien to Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist to Gwen/Tawny in Galaxy Quest and most recently, 14-year-old Kiri in Avatar: The Way of Water. With a career spanning over 50 years, Weaver has captivated audiences and won acclaim as one of the most gifted and versatile actresses on stage and screen.\n\nBorn and educated in New York City, Weaver graduated from Stanford University and went on to receive a master's degree from the Yale School of Drama. Her first professional job was in Sir John Gielgud's production of The Constant Wife working with Ingrid Bergman.\n\nAfter a walk-on in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, Weaver made her motion picture debut in Ridley Scott's 1979 blockbuster Alien. She later reprised the role of Warrant Officer Ripley in James Cameron's 1986 Aliens; her performance earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. In 1992, she again brought Ripley back to life in David Fincher's Alien 3, which she co-produced, and in 1997 she starred in and co-produced Alien: Resurrection for director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. In 1985, Weaver starred in Ivan Reitman's Ghostbusters alongside Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd playing Dana Barrett and her possessed counterpart Zuul.\n\nIn 1988 Weaver portrayed primatologist Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist and Katharine Parker in the Mike Nichols comedy Working Girl. Both performances earned her Academy Award Nominations, and she was awarded two Golden Globes for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture. Other films include Peter Weir's The Year of Living Dangerously (1983) with Linda Hunt and Mel Gibson, Eyewitness (1981) with William Hurt, Half Moon Street (1986) with Michael Caine, Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) with Gerard Depardieu, Roman Polanski's gripping film adaptation of Death and the Maiden (1994), the thriller Copycat (1995) and Paul Rudnick's comedy Jeffery (1995). Weaver also starred in Showtime's live-action film Snow White (1997) based on the original Grimm's fairy tale, which earned her an Emmy nomination and a Screen Actors Guild nomination.\n\nIn 1997 Weaver joined the ensemble of Ang Lee's critically acclaimed film The Ice Storm alongside Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Elijah Wood and Christina Ricci. Her performance garnered her a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe nomination and a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She later gave a galvanizing performance in A Map of the World (1999), Scott Elliott's powerful drama based on the novel by Jane Hamilton, which earned her universal critical praise and a Golden Globe nomination for best actress. Also in 1999, Weaver appeared in the science fiction comedy Galaxy Quest directed by Dean Parisot alongside Tim Allen and Alan Rickman. She delighted audiences with her flair for comedy, and the film proved to be a hit of the 1999 holiday season. She followed this with the popular comedies Company Man (2000) written and directed by Douglas McGrath and David Mirkin's Heartbreakers (2001) opposite Gene Hackman, Jennifer Love-Hewitt and the late Ray Liotta.\n\nIn 2002 Weaver starred in the film version of The Guys, with Anthony LaPaglia, directed by Jim Simpson, and in 2003 she portrayed the cold-blooded, red-headed warden in the hit comedy Holes directed by Andy Davis. The next year, Weaver appeared in M. Night Shyamalan's The Village and received rave reviews for her performance in Imaginery Heroes written and directed by Dan Harris.\n\nIn 2006 she appeared in three films - as Babe Paley in Douglas McGrath's Infamous, in Jake Kasdan's The TV Set, and in Snow Cake opposite Alan Rickman. In the following years, Weaver lent her voice to Pixar's 2008 box office smash WALL-E as well as The Tale of Despereaux (2008) with Matthew Broderick, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Watson. She also starred in the Tina Fey/Amy Poehler comedy Baby Mama (2008) and Andy Fickman's comedy You Again (2010) with Jamie Lee Curtis.

She and Durang co-wrote Das Lusitania which earned them both Drama Desk nominations. She has appeared in numerous Off-Broadway productions in New York, working with writers such as John Guare, Albert Innaurato, Richard Nelson and Len Jenkin. In regional repertory she has performed works by Pinter, Williams, Feydeau and Shakespeare.

Upcoming projects include Amazon Studios' drama series, \"The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart,\" which she also executive produced, and Paul Schrader's Master Gardener, opposite Joel Edgerton, which premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival.\n\nOliver Stone has become known as a master of controversial subjects and a legendary film maker. His films are filled with a variety of film angles and styles, he pushes his actors to give Oscar-worthy performances, and despite his failures, has always returned to success.\n\nWilliam Oliver Stone was born in New York City, to Jacqueline (Goddet) and Louis Stone, a stockbroker. His American father was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Eastern Europe), and his mother, a war bride, was French (and Catholic). After dropping out of Yale University, he became a soldier in the Vietnam War. Serving in two different regiments (including 1rst Cavalry), he was introduced to The Doors, drugs, Jefferson Airplane, and other things that defined the sixties. For his actions in the war, he was awarded a Bronze Star for Gallantry and a Purple Heart. Returning from the war, Stone did not return to graduate from Yale. His first film was a student film entitled Last Year in Viet Nam (1971), followed by the gritty horror film Die Herrscherin des Bösen (1974) for which he also wrote the screenplay. The next seven years saw him direct two films: Mad Man of Martinique (1979) and Die Hand (1981), starring Michael Caine. He also wrote many screenplays for films such as 12 Uhr nachts - Midnight Express (1978), Conan, der Barbar (1982), and Scarface (1983). Stone won his first Oscar for 12 Uhr nachts - Midnight Express (1978), but his fame was just beginning to show.\n\n1986 was the year that brought him much fame to the U.S.A. and the world. He directed the political film Salvador (1986) starring Oscar-nominated James Woods. However, his big hit was the Vietnam war film Platoon (1986) starring Charlie Sheen,Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, and Francesco Quinn. Berenger and Dafoe received Oscar nominations for their roles as the polar opposite sergeants who each influence the tour of duty of Chris Taylor (Sheen). Stone won his first Oscar for directing this film, which won Best Picture and was a hit at the box office. After Platoon (1986), Stone followed up with the critically acclaimed Wall Street (1987). The movie, starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas, focuses on the business world of tycoons and stock brokers. The film was well received and won an Oscar for Douglas' portrayal of the villainous Gordon Gekko. Stone returned immediately the following year with Talk Radio (1988), which talked of a foul-mouthed radio host (played by Eric Bogosian) who never fails to talk about the serious issues. Although it was not as successful as his last three films, Stone did not slow down at all. He directed Tom Cruise into an Oscar-nominated role in Geboren am 4. Juli (1989).\n\nThe movie talked about the return of an embittered, crippled Vietnam soldier from the war. Although it failed to win Best Picture or Best Actor, Oliver Stone won an Academy Award for Directing, his third win to date. After Geboren am 4. Juli (1989), Stone took a hand in producing several movies, including the Academy Award-winning film Die Affäre der Sunny von B. (1990). He returned to the director's chair in 1991, once again with two films. Val Kilmer starred as the legendary and controversial Jim Morrison in Stone's psychedelic film The Doors (1991).\n\nDespised by former Doors member Ray Manzarek, the film is nevertheless a wonderful achievement, with Kilmer pulling off an almost flawless impersonation of Morrison. Regardless of opinion, The Doors (1991) was overshadowed by Stone's colossal film JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991), which Stone himself considers the best of his films. In Stone's movie, Jim Garrison tackles the conspiracy behind the murder of America's president John F. Kennedy. The large cast featured such well-known names as Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, and Walter Matthau. This film represented a change in Stone's works, because it was with this film that he really began to explore the different camera styles and combining them together to create a multi-dimensional way of showing a movie. JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991), as with Platoon (1986) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989), earned eight Oscar nominations and was one of Stone's most successful films. However, he failed to win a third Oscar for Best Director.\n\nAfter this film, Stone directed his third Vietnam film to date. Zwischen Himmel und Hölle (1993) was a film about the war from the viewpoint of a Vietnamese girl, and also co-starred Tommy Lee Jones (who had received an Oscar nomination for JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991)). Despite its new woman's perspective and several positive reviews, it was a box office failure. Stone was unfazed; his next film is perhaps his most notorious film to date. Adapting a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, Stone made Natural Born Killers (1994) starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore and Rodney Dangerfield in his only dramatic performance. The film was received well at the box office, while review were very mixed. Because of the violence that people claimed was inspired by the film, it was compared to Stanley Kubrick's Uhrwerk Orange (1971). As usual, Stone was at the center of controversial subjects; his next film Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995) was no exception. The film focused on the life of President Richard Nixon, played by Anthony Hopkins, while featuring another well-known cast, including Joan Allen in the role of Nixon's wife. Both went on to receive Oscar nominations, while Stone received his sixth Oscar nomination for Screenwriting. The film got mixed reviews, and failed to recoup its budget.\n\nAside from directing, Stone has worked as a producer on several different films. There was, of course, the successful film Die Affäre der Sunny von B. (1990), which won Jeremy Irons an Oscar and also nominated the director for an Oscar. There was also the highly praised and successful emotional drama Töchter des Himmels (1993) which centered around four Chinese immigrant women whose relationships with their daughters is affected by their own lives. Another highly praised Oscar nominated film was Milos Forman's classic film Larry Flynt - Die nackte Wahrheit (1996) starring Woody Harrelson, Edward Norton, and Courtney Love. Whether the crime/action film Corruptor - Im Zeichen der Korruption (1999) or the brilliant war epic Savior - Soldat der Hölle (1998), Stone has worked in a variety of film genres.\n\nStone had directed ten films in nine years; now however, he began to slow down. He directed the film U-Turn - Kein Weg zurück (1997) starring Sean Penn and Jennifer Lopez. As with Natural Born Killers (1994), it was a dark and twisted satire on violence, but did not have the same success as the former. Stone was set to direct several projects in the late 90's but they fell through and were not made. However, success came back to Stone in the Al Pacino film An jedem verdammten Sonntag (1999). This sports movie centered on the life behind the game of football, and it starred an impressive cast that included frequent Stone collaborators James Woods and John C. McGinley. This film was one of his most successful box office films, and put him back on track.\n\nThe following years brought Stone no new theatrical films, though he did make three fascinating TV documentaries. Two of them, 'Looking for Fidel' and Comandante (2003) were interviews of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, while 'Persona Non Grata' was an interview of several Palestinian leaders. Stone was also set to direct American Psycho (2000) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jenseits aller Grenzen (2003), starring Angelina Jolie and at the time, Ralph Fiennes. However, Stone dropped out of both projects, as did a number of the actors mentioned. Finally, five years after An jedem verdammten Sonntag (1999), Stone directed a film he'd long wanted to make; the colossal epic Alexander (2004). Starring Colin Farrell as the Macedonian leader, Stone attempted to capture the essence of Alexander the Great through his conquests of the known world. The film focused on Alexander's relationships with his parents (a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer and a less impressive one by Angelina Jolie) and his relationships with his wife and childhood friend/ gay lover (played by Rosario Dawson and Jared Leto respectively).\n\nAlexander (2004) was a critical failure, and failed to win back its budget domestically. Despite being one of 2004's highest grossing films internationally, and recouping its budget through DVD sales, Stone's pet project was heavily criticized. Despite a far superior version (Alexander Revisited) being released on DVD, the film's reputation remains low by the majority. Stone was personally stung at these attacks, but managed to rebound, if mildly, with his hopeful film World Trade Center (2006). The film centers on two firefighters trapped in the rubble of the twin towers. It received good reviews, and allowed Oliver to step forward from his failure towards the possibility of more films.\n\nIn late 2007, besides a number of projects Stone was set to direct \"Pinkville\", which would have been his fourth Vietnam film to date. It was set to star a large number of well known actors such as Bruce Willis, Toby Jones, Channing Tatum, Michael Pitt, Woody Harrelson, and Michael Peña. However, a week before shooting was to begin, the Writer's Strike was started, and the finance for the film was cut, using the strike as an excuse. After Willis backed out of the project, it was eventually scuttled, much like Stone's early productions of Platoon (1986) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989). Stone turned to another project he had worked on with former Wall Street (1987) collaborator Stanley Weiser. The project was W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008), a biography on president George W. Bush. Stone initially cast Christian Bale in the role of Bush but the actor dropped out at the last minute. Josh Brolin was cast, and this followed with a large cast of well known Oscar nominated character actors such as Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell, and Ellen Burstyn. The film was made in a record four months, starting in June and released in October. The film opened to mixed reviews, and though film's budget was recouped, it was not a financial hit.\n\nStone then made the documentary South of the Border (2009), a documentary which focused on bringing to light the positive aspects of the left-wing governments in South America, particularly Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Stone was much less critical than usual, instead making the documentary as a response to the harsh reputation that Chavez has in the States. The documentary was poorly received in the States. Stone also began work on Wall Street: Geld schläft nicht (2010). Starring Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, and Eli Wallach, the film focuses on the 2008 economic crisis, and the return of Gordon Gekko from prison. The film was screened at Cannes to positive reception, and hailed as Stone's triumphant return. After this, Stone made a film adaptation of \"Savages\", a novel by Don Winslow . The movie follows two highly successful marijuana growers (Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson ), whose shared girlfriend (Blake Lively) is kidnapped by a Mexican cartel and held for ransom. The movie also starred Salma Hayek, Benicio Del Toro, John Travolta, and Emile Hirsch. The film was a return to the tense action and violence of Stone's earlier films, though it polarized many audience members due to the colorful narrations of Lively's vapid and naive character, as well as the film's ending.\n\nAfter completing the ambitious and well-received television project Oliver Stone - Die Geschichte Amerikas (2012), as well as a documentary on Hugo Chavez, Stone finally returned to feature films with Snowden (2016). Based on the life of American whistle blower Edward Snowden, Stone's film depicted his awakening to the truth behind the massive surveillances conducted by the NSA, and his attempt to warn the general public of what they did not know. The film was done independently, financed by Europeans on a low budget. It was also a return to form for Stone in a way that had not been seen since \"Alexander\". Joseph Gordon-Levitt, delivered a very strong performance as Snowden, with the supporting cast including Shailene Woodley, Rhys Ifans, Melissa Leo, Timothy Olyphant, and Nicolas Cage. Sadly, the film received a mixed response from critics, and was a box office disappointment.\n\nSince then, Stone has returned to television for his next two projects. One is a series of interviews with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and the other is directing a new fictional series based on the abusive Guantanamo prison. It will be his first venture into fictional television.\n\nOliver Stone is a three-time Oscar winner, and although he has mostly been stung by critics of his films, he remains a well-known name today in the film industry. The films he directed have been nominated for 31 Academy Awards, including eight for acting, six for screen writing, and three for directing. There is no denying that Stone has cemented himself a position among the legends of Hollywood."
