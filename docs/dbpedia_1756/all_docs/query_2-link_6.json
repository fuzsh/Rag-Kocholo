        "text": "Many stars on the screen have roots in Queens and we are going to look at just a few of them.\n\nFirst, it would be remiss not to take this op­portunity to reflect on the life and career of the recently passed James Caan. Though born in the Bronx, Caan grew up in Sunnyside with his mother, Sophie, and father, Arthur. He at­tended Michigan State University and later transferred to Hofstra University.

Throughout his career, Caan has acted in 137 roles. Some of his most notable roles in film include Brian’s Song (1971), The Godfather (1972), The Gambler (1974), Mis­ery (1990), and Elf (2003).

Scorsese was born in Flush­ing and his family moved to Little Italy, Man­hattan when he was young. His parents, Charles and Catherine, shared a passion for acting while also working in the Garment Dis­trict. Due to his asthma, Scorsese was limited to what he could do as a child, which led him to cinema.

He went on to earn his M.A. from NYU’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human De­velopment, formerly known as School of Ed­ucation, in 1968.
