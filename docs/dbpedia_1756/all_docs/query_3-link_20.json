        "text": "County in Oregon, United States\n\nCounty in Oregon\n\nClatsop County ( ) is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the population was 41,072.[1] The county seat is Astoria.[2] The county is named for the Clatsop tribe of Native Americans, who lived along the coast of the Pacific Ocean prior to European settlement. Clatsop County comprises the Astoria, OR Micropolitan Statistical Area, or Sunset Empire, and is located in Northwest Oregon.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition stayed for the winter of 1805–06 in the area, establishing Fort Clatsop as one of the earliest American structures on the west coast of North America. Astoria, Oregon's oldest settlement, was established as a fur trading post in 1811 and named after John Jacob Astor.\n\nClatsop County was created from the northern and western portions of the original Twality District on June 22, 1844. Until the creation of Vancouver District five days later, Clatsop County extended north across the Columbia into present-day Washington. The Provisional and Territorial Legislatures further altered Clatsop County's boundaries in 1845 and 1853.\n\nBefore 1850 most of Clatsop County's government activity occurred in Lexington, a community located where Warrenton is now. However, commercial and social activities came to center on Astoria as that city grew, and an election in 1854 chose Astoria to be the new county seat.\n\nFort Stevens, located near the peninsula formed by the south shore of the Columbia river and the Pacific Ocean, became the only continental US military installation attacked in World War II, when submarine I-25 of the Imperial Japanese Navy fired 17 rounds at the base on June 21, 1942. The submarine escaped when the order was given not to return fire with the 10-inch (250 mm) shore guns. While the damage caused was slight (reportedly only a baseball backstop was damaged and a powerline severed), the presence of the enemy ship sowed panic along the Pacific coast of the United States, and other minor attacks occurred elsewhere in the region, including Vancouver Island.\n\nIn 1975, Clatsop County commissioners considered seceding from Oregon and becoming a part of Washington.[3] The movement was based on disagreements residents of the county had with Governor Bob Straub.[4] The movement was created after Alumax Corporation canceled their plans to build a plant in the county.[5] Some residents, including two county commissioners, blamed the Oregon Governor for the relocation of the plant.[5] The State of Washington's Governor, Daniel J. Evans, said the county was not welcome in the state[4] and Clatsop County commissioners later abandoned the idea.[3]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,084 square miles (2,810 km2), of which 829 square miles (2,150 km2) is land and 255 square miles (660 km2) (24%) is water.[6] The highest point is Saddle Mountain at 3,283 feet (1,001 m), part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range.[7]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nU.S. Route 26\n\nU.S. Route 30\n\nU.S. Route 101\n\nNational protected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nJulia Butler Hansen National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n\nLewis and Clark National Historical Park (part)\n\nLewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge\n\nOregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n\nEcology\n\n[edit]\n\nClatsop County is home to a number of plant species that are rare or endemic, including Agrostis swalalahos,[8] Cardamine pattersonii, Carex macrochaeta, Castilleja chambersii, Erigeron peregrinus var. peregrinus, and Saxifraga hitchcockiana.[9]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1850462—18604987.8%18701,255152.0%18807,222475.5%189010,01638.7%190012,76527.4%191016,10626.2%192023,03043.0%193021,124−8.3%194024,69716.9%195030,77624.6%196027,380−11.0%197028,4734.0%198032,48914.1%199033,3012.5%200035,6307.0%201037,0394.0%202041,07210.9%2023 (est.)41,102[10]0.1%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 37,039 people, 15,742 households, and 9,579 families living in the county.[15] The population density was 44.7 inhabitants per square mile (17.3/km2).

The Port of Astoria was created in 1914 to support trade and commerce.\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nAstoria, Oregon, the county seat, has multiple tourist attractions including the Astoria Riverfront Trolley, Fort Clatsop, the Uppertown Firefighters Museum, and Columbia River Maritime Museum.[21] Seaside, Oregon, noted as Oregon's oldest ocean resort community,[22] also has multiple tourist attractions including, the Seaside Aquarium, and the Seaside Historical Society Museum. Tourism is noted as one of the major forces in Clatsop County's economy.[22]\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nAstoria (county seat)\n\nCannon Beach\n\nGearhart\n\nSeaside\n\nWarrenton\n\nCensus-designated places\n\n[edit]\n\nJeffers Garden\n\nKnappa\n\nRiver Point\n\nSvensen\n\nWestport\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nLike all of the northern Oregon coast, Clatsop County was consistently Republican up to and including the 1928 election,[23] except in 1912 when third-party former President Theodore Roosevelt won by one vote with the lowest percentage for a winning candidate in any county since the Civil War.[24] Since Franklin D. Roosevelt won the county in 1932, Clatsop has generally been carried by the Democratic candidate in presidential elections. The only exception to this is Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the county twice, thereby making this Oregon county the one to have gone the longest without supporting a Republican nominee.[23] However, George McGovern won it by just nineteen votes in 1972,[25] and Walter Mondale by a mere three votes (or 0.019887 percent) in 1984.[26]\n\nIn gubernatorial elections, the county has been won by the Democratic Party candidate since 1982, starting with a streak of seven consecutive elections with the Democratic Party carrying Clatsop County. That winning streak ended in 2014, with the GOP gubernatorial candidate, Dennis Richardson, unexpectedly carrying Clatsop with a final vote total of 6,550 votes (46.33 percent) for the Republican and 6,449 votes (45.62 percent) cast for the Democrat and future governor-elect John Kitzhaber.[27]\n\nClatsop County is located in Oregon's 1st congressional district, which has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+18 and is represented by Suzanne Bonamici. In the Oregon State Senate, it is represented by Republican Suzanne Weber. In the Oregon House of Representatives, it is represented by Republican Cyrus Javadi.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Clatsop County, Oregon[28] Year Republican Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 10,218 42.74% 12,916 54.02% 776 3.25% 2016 8,138 41.39% 9,252 47.05% 2,274 11.56% 2012 7,249 40.68% 9,861 55.34% 708 3.97% 2008 7,192 38.78% 10,701 57.69% 655 3.53% 2004 8,503 44.04% 10,461 54.18% 345 1.79% 2000 6,950 42.19% 8,296 50.36% 1,228 7.45% 1996 5,334 34.63% 7,732 50.19% 2,339 15.18% 1992 4,683 27.86% 7,700 45.80% 4,429 26.34% 1988 5,956 41.60% 8,074 56.40% 286 2.00% 1984 7,522 49.86% 7,525 49.88% 38 0.25% 1980 6,124 40.94% 6,482 43.33% 2,353 15.73% 1976 6,178 45.37% 6,690 49.13% 748 5.49% 1972 5,998 47.43% 6,017 47.58% 632 5.00% 1968 5,810 45.61% 6,243 49.01% 685 5.38% 1964 4,023 32.41% 8,371 67.44% 19 0.15% 1960 6,286 48.86% 6,530 50.75% 50 0.39% 1956 6,616 50.94% 6,372 49.06% 0 0.00% 1952 7,569 56.02% 5,814 43.03% 128 0.95% 1948 5,076 44.87% 5,574 49.27% 663 5.86% 1944 3,921 39.09% 6,038 60.19% 72 0.72% 1940 3,758 35.74% 6,686 63.59% 70 0.67% 1936 2,261 25.60% 6,267 70.96% 304 3.44% 1932 2,570 34.46% 4,473 59.98% 414 5.55% 1928 4,087 63.33% 2,208 34.21% 159 2.46% 1924 3,313 56.33% 1,373 23.35% 1,195 20.32% 1920 3,498 61.40% 1,687 29.61% 512 8.99% 1916 2,568 49.44% 2,239 43.11% 387 7.45% 1912 722 26.98% 728 27.20% 1,226 45.81% 1908 1,482 59.78% 658 26.54% 339 13.67% 1904 1,408 68.68% 336 16.39% 306 14.93% 1900 1,329 62.63% 688 32.42% 105 4.95% 1896 1,849 60.56% 1,135 37.18% 69 2.26% 1892 1,148 48.89% 713 30.37% 487 20.74% 1888 1,060 60.30% 647 36.80% 51 2.90% 1884 872 56.22% 670 43.20% 9 0.58% 1880 536 55.26% 434 44.74% 0 0.00%\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Clatsop County, Oregon\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
