The Goonies not only was filmed in Astoria and Cannon Beach, but within the movie they state it takes place in Astoria, in contrast to a fictional setting used by many films and television shows.\n\nFans come to Astoria from all over the world to experience the area, including film locations like the jail - now the Oregon Film Museum, the bowling alley, and Ecola State Park in Cannon Beach. Many of them look at our communities as another character from the movie and fall in love with the idea of just being here.\n\nExplore the scenes for yourself, revel in the nostalgia of Mikey and the gang’s epic adventure, and soon, the town of Astoria will hold a special place in your heart, too.\n\nCan we visit the house?\n\nThe house located in Astoria that was used as a film location in The Goonies has been under question again this year after it was sold. The new owners are major fans of the movie and have expressed desire to honor the film heritage and find ways to reconnect the house and the fans.\n\nThe house is a private home. Tours inside are not offered. The only visitation is outside, from the driveway. Do not go up onto the porch, neighboring property, etc.\n\nThe neighborhood issues caused by overwhelming visitation are still present - and the homeowner, neighboring residents and community leaders are asking visitors to keep this in mind if they choose to visit the home itself.\n\nIn brief, viewing from a distance is still advised. If you go the neighborhood, please park your car to the west of 37th & Duane and be prepared to walk a few blocks. The gravel driveway up hill to the house is very narrow - do not attempt to drive up - and please walk single file to allow resident cars access.\n\nPlease visit this page for more info. (May 2023)\n\nThe Goonies is a 1985 American adventure comedy film co-produced and directed by Richard Donner from a screenplay by Chris Columbus, based on a story by Steven Spielberg, and starring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, and Ke Huy Quan with supporting roles done by John Matuszak, Robert Davi, Anne Ramsey, and Joe Pantoliano. In the film, a group of kids who live in the \"Goon Docks\" neighborhood of Astoria, Oregon, attempt to save their homes from foreclosure and, in doing so, they discover an old treasure map that takes them on an adventure to unearth the long-lost fortune of One-Eyed Willy, a legendary 17th-century pirate. During the adventure, they are chased by a family of criminals who want the treasure for themselves.\n\nThe film was produced by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, and released by Warner Bros. theatrically on June 7, 1985, in the United States. The film grossed $125 million worldwide on a budget of $19 million and has since become a cult film. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"\n\n(overview from Wikipedia.org)"
