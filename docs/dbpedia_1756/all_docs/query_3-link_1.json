        "text": "Chinook Nation\n\nClatsop-Nehalem\n\nConfederated Tribes\n\nThe City of Astoria is located in the northwestern corner of Oregon at the mouth of the Columbia River, within a few miles of Pacific Ocean beaches, with a population of nearly 10,000. As the oldest American settlement west of the Rocky Mountains, Astoria has close historical ties to the Lewis & Clark Trail. In 1811, John Jacob Astor, a New York financier, sent fur traders to the area and the trading post of Fort Astoria was established. Surrounded on three sides by the Columbia, Youngs, and Lewis & Clark rivers, the steep hillsides of Astoria exhibit beautiful Victorian and Craftsman homes. River, bay and forested views abound. Art galleries, restaurants, microbreweries, eclectic shops and the restored 1920â€™s Liberty Theater reflect a revitalized, vibrant downtown. Family oriented attractions and recreational activities are plentiful; a five mile river walk, hiking trails, aquatic center, numerous parks, boat moorages, the Columbia River Maritime Museum, the Astoria Riverfront Trolley and the Astoria Column are all within city limits. Ocean beaches, Lewis & Clark National and State Historical Park and Fort Stevens State Park are just outside the city creating many opportunities for the northwest outdoor experience. Astoria became incorporated in 1856."
