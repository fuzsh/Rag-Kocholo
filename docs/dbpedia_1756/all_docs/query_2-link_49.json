        "text": "While most of us Americans see the Fourth of July as a holiday full of fireworks and hot dogs, a day to celebrate our nation’s independence. However, many people in the US, and obviously around the world, see it as another day: a birthday!\n\nObviously, birthdays happen any day: Christmas, Halloween, a random Tuesday; you name it. However, many people try to not give birth on the Fourth of July, per Happiest Baby. July 4 ranks 362nd on the most popular days to give birth. Why such a low number? Well, per the outlet, there are “folks who were holding out until after July 4th end up scheduling inductions or c-sections.” (Most of the most popular birthdays were in Sept, but the non-Sept was one on July 7, helping this theory.) While this number is quite low, quite a few celebs were born on July 4.\n\nWe’ve seen some celebrities wed on the Fourth of July, get engaged on this big day, and more. However, quite a few major celebrities were born on the Fourth of July, including both royalty and a former First Daugther.\n\nIn honor of today, see which celebrities were born on the Fourth of July below:"
