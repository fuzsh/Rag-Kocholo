        "text": "Chelsea is located on the west side of Manhattan in the Midtown section of the island, north of Greenwich Village but south of Hell's Kitchen. A lot of famous people live here.\n\nIn an area with easy access to everything Midtown has to offer such as restaurants, Broadway shows and TV stations to the north and lots of green space to the south. There is also Chelsea Market, a farmers' market that the stars like to visit.\n\nBe on the lookout as you are likely to spot those who live in Chelsea such as Cameron Diaz, Harrison Ford and Kate Winslet going about their daily lives.\n\nNot nearly as well known as some of the similarly named neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and West Village, the East Village is a great neighborhood on the east side of Manhattan. The East Village is located on the East River and is flanked by Lower and Midtown Manhattan. It is an artistic part of the city with many apartment buildings inhabited by the city's wealthy.\n\nIf you stroll through this part of the city, you might run into some of the people who call this place home, including Britney Spears, Amanda Seyfried and Russell Simmons."
