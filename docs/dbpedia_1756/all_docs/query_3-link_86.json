        "text": "PIER PARK, PORTLAND\n\nOn April 14th, 2017, a grove of trees was planted by Oregon Governor, Kate Brown, in honor of the NBC television series, \"Grimm.\" For six seasons the City of Portland and Pier Park served as both \"Grimm’s\" inspiration and setting. The grove of trees and the replica of \"Aunt Marie’s Book of Lore\" make for a fitting and evocative commemoration. This project was a joint partnership between the City of Portland, Friends of Trees, Pier Park, Comcast/NBC and the Oregon Governor’s Office of Film & Television. It recognizes not only an individual park that \"Grimm\" memorialized many times on TV screens, but also the large contribution that the City of Portland made to the production of popular NBC series.\n\n​depoe b​ay\n\nA new Oregon Film Trail sign was installed in December 2019 in Depoe Bay harbor. The sign honors the town harbor’s starring role as a location in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. The Oregon Coast Visitor's Association, Depoe Bay Chamber of Commerce and Travel Oregon partnered to bring this newest sign on the Oregon Film Trail in the World’s Smallest Harbor – between dock 1 and 2. This sign was made possible, in part, by a grant from Travel Oregon and the Oregon Coast Visitors Association.\n\nPORTLAND TRAIN STATION\n\nNoah Dille, a local welder and fabricator with a background in the motion picture industry, presented his winning design bid for a \"Portlandia\" themed bike rack that now sits outside the Portland train station in commemoration of the City’s involvement in the series that shot in the city for 8 seasons. Additionally, a commemorative plaque hangs outside the Mayor's office inside City Hall. The plaque and bike rack were specifically commissioned by the Oregon Governor’s Office of Film & Television and the Portland Film Office, with support from the Oregon Media Production Association (OMPA), as a gift to Portland City Hall to celebrate \"Portlandia’s\" contributions to the city. Read More here.\n\nThe \"Portlandia\" bike rack on the Oregon Film Trail.\n\n​ATHENA\n\nAnother Oregon Film Trail sign was installed in June 2020 at the Gem Theater in Athena. The dedication of this sign is celebrating the local filming of F.W. Murnau's feature film, \"City Girl,\" a silent era film that starred Mary Duncan. Duncan spent several weeks in and around Athena shooting the farm scenes that were shot at the top of Thorn Hollow (approximately 6 miles from downtown Athena). Many local crews and livestock were used in the harvesting wheat scenes during the summer of 1928. This sign was made possible by a grant from Travel Oregon.\n\nOregon Film Trail: \"City Girl,\" Gem Theatre, Athena, OR\n\n​silver falls state park\n\nInstalled in August 2020 at the Howard Creek Trailhead parking lot near the campground utilizing a grant from the Willamette Valley Visitors Association, this sign marks filming locations related to the popular romantic vampire fantasy feature film, \"Twilight,\" that was based on Stephenie Meyer's novel of the same name. The film was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, starred Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson and was the first film in this popular saga series. Other films have used Silver Falls State Park as a filming location, such as the William Friedkin thriller, \"The Hunted,\" the horror movie, \"Just Before Dawn\" and the opening scenes from Warner Bros. animated feature, \"Yogi Bear.\"\n\nThe \"Twilight\" marker at the Howard Creek Trailhead in Silver Falls State Park\n\n​smith rock state park\n\nThis sign celebrates the park as a filming location that has \"starred\" in many movies, from traditional westerns to more recent films such as \"Wild\" (2014). The rock scrambling scenes filmed here at the park doubled for a location on the Pacific Crest Trail in California. This sign is a partnership with the Redmond Chamber of Commerce, the Central Oregon Visitors Association and Smith Rock State Park. The sign was paid for in part by a grant from Travel Oregon, with help from Redmond Chamber of Commerce and the Central Oregon Visitors Association.\n\n​ASHLAND\n\nHistoric downtown Ashland featured prominently in Wild, the highly acclaimed 2014 film adaptation of the best-selling book, starring Reese Witherspoon as Oregon author Cheryl Strayed. When Witherspoon's character emerges from hiking following a particularly difficult section of the Pacific Crest Trail, the Downtown Plaza doubled as a community-gathering place to mourn the death of the Grateful Dead icon Jerry Garcia.\n\nA fictionalized version of Ashland provided the inspiration for the setting of the animated feature film Coraline, the first stop-motion film from Oregon-based Laika Studios. Adapted from Neil Gaiman's novella of the same name, the film tells the story of Coraline, a young girl living in a small and charming town, complete with a Shakespeare Festival that permeates the culture and wonder of the community, who finds a door leading to a parallel reality.\n\nThese signs are a collaborative effort, paid for in part by a grant from Travel Oregon and a grant from the City of Ashland facilitated by Andrew Gay, Associate Professor & Program Coordinator Digital Cinema at Southern Oregon University, and placed in partnership with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival​, Ashland Independent Film Festival, and Film Southern Oregon.\n\nOregon Film Trail: Ashland, the home of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival that helped to inspire the setting for the animated film \"Coraline\"\n\nOregon Film Trail: \"Wild\" in downtown Ashland\n\n​TOLEDO\n\nThe recently installed sign marks and celebrates locations in and around Toledo in the filming of “Sometimes A Great Notion” (1971), a motion picture based on the second novel by Oregon author Ken Kesey and published in 1964. The film was directed by Paul Newman, who also co-starred with Henry Fonda and Lee Remick. Partners include the Toledo Chamber of Commerce and the City of Toledo. It was paid for in part by a grant from Travel Oregon.\n\nHarney County Fairgrounds\n\n\"Lean on Pete\" - This coming of age drama starring, Steve Buscemi, Chloë Sevigny and Charlie Plummer, was directed by Andrew Haigh and based on the novel by Oregon author, Willy Vlautin. Many of the scenes depicting the young boy's connection to a special racehorse were filmed at this fair ground track, as well as close by in the city of Burns and Hines. Many local residents were employed as extras. This sign was part of a collaborative partnership between the Oregon Governor’s Office of Film & Television, (partnered with the Oregon Made Creative Foundation) and was paid for in part by a Grant from Travel Oregon , and in partnership with the Harney County Chamber of Commerce, the City of Hines , and the Harney County Fairgrounds.\n\nThe Oregon Film Trail marker at the Harney County Fairgrounds\n\n​Wallowa lake state park & joseph\n\nTwo signs celebrate the filming locations near the City of Joseph and Wallowa Lake State Park. These beautiful and dramatic Filming locations in Eastern Oregon have inspired Hollywood filmmakers all the way back to the silent movie era when the \"Winds of Chance\" (1925) shot close to Wallowa Lake but played-for the Canadian mountains in the gold rush era. The Disney family adventure-comedy, \"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey\", starred two dogs and cat, and filmed in multiple locations close in the Wallowa area, including a picturesque ranch a few miles from Joseph, Mount Howard as well as multiple other locations in Oregon. These signs are a partnership with the Wallowa County Chamber of Commerce, the City of Joseph, Wallowa Lake State Park, and was paid for in part by a grant from Travel Oregon.\n\ncottage grove\n\nCottage Grove has five Oregon Film Trail markers in around this picturesque city. Buster Keaton's “The General\", \"Stand By Me\", \"Lost In The Stars\" and \"Animal House\" were all filmed here.

Additional logistical help came from Travel Lane County and the BLM.\n\n​Klamath falls\n\nAn historic marker will be formally unveiled as part of a full slate of activities in celebration of the film “Phoenix, Oregon” on Saturday, February 27, 2021 in downtown Klamath Falls with a simultaneous livestream. Meeting directly with multiple community organizations throughout the fall, Klamath Film rallied letters of support and financial donations to cover the cost of the marker’s construction and confirm sufficient community support for the film’s recognition. Pledged support in financial donations or letters was received from Klamath Falls City Council, Klamath County Commissioners, Soroptimist International of Klamath, Klamath Falls Downtown Association (KFDA), Klamath Film and Discover Klamath, along with private citizen donations. This marker was also paid for in part by a grant from Travel Oregon.\n\nOregon Film Trail: \"Phoenix, Oregon\" in downtown Klamath Falls\n\n​OREGON CITY\n\nOregon City sign honors the town’s starring role as a location in the popular teen drama, \"Twilight.\" It sits along the McLoughlin Promenade, overlooking the former Blue Heron paper mill where scenes from the iconic vampire movie were shot. The Mill has also been featured in \"The Hunted\" and \"Grimm.\" The Works Progress Administration-era Promenade has itself been featured in scenes from \"The Librarians\" and \"Trinkets.\"\n\nOregon Film Trail: \"Twilight\" in Oregon City.\n\nPortland International Airport\n\nOregon Film Trail: McLoughlin Promenade, Oregon City.\n\nPortland International Airport is home to a wall mural and film poster exhibit in the South Pedestrian Tunnel where travelers can see over 160 uninterrupted feet of colorful mural art, iconic movie posters, and Oregon landscapes. This informative mural represents a carefully curated collection of some of Oregon’s extremely rich film history with 22 rotating posters on display.

The film depicted an ill-fated journey on the Oregon Trail and starred Michelle Williams. This sign was part of a collaborative partnership between the Oregon Governor’s Office of Film & Television, (partnered with the Oregon Made Creative Foundation) and was paid for in part by a Grant from Travel Oregon, and in partnership with the cities of Burns and Hines and the Harney County Chamber of Commerce.\n\n​St. Helens\n\nSt. Helens is no stranger to film productions, and two standouts were “Twilight,” and \"Halloweentown.\" \"Twilight,\" the romantic fantasy film based on Stephenie Meyer’s novel was directed by Catherine Hardwicke and starred Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. It filmed many scenes here, such as the restaurant where Edward tells Bella he can read minds, the bookstore, Bella’s house, the dress shop, and alley where Edward saved Bella. In the Riverfront District of St. Helens, the Disney family classic, “Halloweentown” filmed. This show starred Debbie Reynolds as the witch, “Aggie” and every year during the month of October the Plaza Square comes alive with the “giant pumpkin” and the Spirit of Halloweentown festival.\n\n​Canby\n\nThe NBC series, \"Grimm\" shot seven seasons in the Portland area. The show was inspired by the classic \"Grimm\" Brothers fairy tales. Scenes from the \"Synchronicity\" episode were filmed in Eco Park that doubled for a European forest. Filming also took place at the Logging Road Trail as well as Aurora Airport and Molalla. Also filmed in the county were; \"Twilight\", \"The Shining\", Into the Wild, and the television sketch comedy, \"Portlandia\".\n\nEUGENE\n\nIn Eugene, #OregonMade films such as; \"Without Limits,\" \"Tracktown,\" \"How to Beat the High Co$t of Living,\" \"Animal House\" and \"Wild\" have filmed in this versatile city. In fact, over 24 Hollywood film projects have showcased Eugene, and Cascades & Coast region since the 1920's (when Buster Keaton first filmed, \"The General\" in the close-by historic town of Cottage Grove.) Other movies that called Eugene home are, \"Animal House,\" Bob Rafelson's \"Five Easy Pieces\" (1970) starring Jack Nicholson, Nicholson's own \"Drive, He Said\" (1970), parts of \"Stand By Me\" (1986) and \"The Simpsons\" series (1989 - 2020) created by Oregon cartoonist, Matt Groening, was set in close-by Springfield.

There is even a self-guided tour of \"Animal House\" film sites on the University of Oregon campus, and now the City features 3 Oregon Film Trail signs. The region has also been highlighted in popular television shows from \"Antiques Roadshow\" to \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\"\n\nAnthony Lakes Mountain Resort, Baker City, And Richland\n\nThe musical comedy, \"Paint Your Wagon\" was filmed in the summer of 1968 (released 1969) in various locations in Eastern Oregon. The Production HQ was located in Baker City and the main filming site for the fictitious town of \"No Name City\", was built from scratch on the banks of East Eagle Creek in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. Other locations in the area were at Forshey Meadows, Anthony Lakes Mountain Resort, near Baker City, and main Eagle Creek. The fictitious “Starbottle’s Hotel” was the inspiration for the current saloon's name at Anthony Lakes Mountain Resort, and the original wooden prop can still be seen inside the Saloon. These locations all doubled for gold rush-era California. Most of the cast and crew stayed at the historic Geiser Grand Hotel in Baker City, some were helicoptered in daily to the East Eagle Creek site. Many locals were hired as movie extras and stand-ins for the cast. They also built props for \"No Name City,\" provided transportation between HQ and the sets, operated equipment, and provided feed for the livestock. In Baker City, the Baker Heritage Museum houses a large memorabilia, prop, costume, and photographic collection showcasing the film. Paramount Pictures donated to the people of Baker County their large-scale model of “No Name City” which is on permanent display at the Museum. (Please note: the Richland sign is waiting to be installed as of spring 2024.)\n\nThe film starred Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, Jean Seberg, Ray Wilson, and Harve Presnell."
