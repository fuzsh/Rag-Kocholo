Walk under the 4.1 mile long Astoria-Megler Bridge, enjoy the spectacular views of the river, check out the Maritime Memorial, visit one of the many nearby shipwrecks, learn about life on the beautiful and dangerous\n\nColumbia River at the Columbia River Maritime Museum, and enjoy the lounging sea lions on the docks at 36th Street.

Hop on the 1913 trolley and learn from the volunteers about the history of the oldest American settlements on the West Coast. If you are lucky enough to come in August, you can enjoy front row seats to Astoria Regatta, the biggest festival on the West Coast. 25 Best Things to Do in Astoria, Oregon - Photo: jkraft5/Fotolia\n\nColumbia River Maritime Museum\n\nThe Columbia River Maritime Museum was founded in 1962 to preserve the rich maritime heritage of the entire Columbia River region. The Museum’s collection, made up of artifacts collected since its opening, has grown to more than 30,000 objects, 20,000 photographs, and a research library with 10,000 publications. Together, they make the Columbia River Maritime Museum one of the most important sources of Pacific Northwest maritime information in the country.\n\nA range of different exhibits are featured and are designed to teach visitors about the history of the powerful forces along the Columbia River Bar such as the 40-foot waves that crash during severe winter storms.

The museum offers a range of courses related to the Columbia River maritime culture at its Barbey Maritime Center.

Many of its current residents are descendants from early settlers, many of whom were Chinese and played a significant role in Astoria’s history especially in the canneries, railroads, and the jetties at the Columbia River.\n\nThe Garden of Surging Waves is a city park that celebrates and honors the Chinese heritage that is found in Astoria. Visitors can better understand Astoria’s relationship with China over the years while relaxing in the beautifully structured public space which includes an amphitheater and large open spaces often used for outdoor performances and community gatherings.

Van Dusen, c/o Julie Lampi, Astoria City Hall, 1095 Duane Street, Astoria, OR 97103, Phone: 503-325-5824\n\nThe Astoria Column\n\nStanding 600 feet above sea level at Coxcomb Hill, offering spectacular view of the city, the Columbia River and Young’s Bay, the Astoria Column is one of 12 monuments built to honor Astoria’s early settlers. Every night, as its light turns on, it reminds Astoria residents of the strength, pride and resolve of their ancestors.\n\nDedicated in 1926, the column was inspired by the Trajan Column in Rome. A hand-painted frieze that spirals around the column was designed by Italian immigrant artist Attilio Pusterla, and would be 500 feet long if unwound. The Column and the lovely park that surrounds it are among the most visited Astoria and Oregon attractions. Address: 1 Coxcomb Dr, Astoria, OR 97103, Phone: 503-325-2963\n\nFort Stevens State Park\n\nFort Stevens was built during the American Civil War and was once considered the main military defense outpost at the delta of the Columbia River. The fort served for 84 years, until the end of World War II. Today, Fort Stevens is a 4,300 acre park that offers the opportunity to learn about history and nature, and is a popular recreational site for the residents of Astoria.\n\nIt offers camping, swimming or canoeing in Coffenbury Lake, beach-combing, hiking or biking the nine miles of trails, observing wildlife, visiting a historic shipwreck, and exploring the historic military fort. The park’s habitats are equally diverse and range from hemlock and spruce forests to wetlands, dunes and pine forests on the shore.\n\nFort Clatsop, Astoria, Oregon\n\nLocated at the end of the Clatsop Plains, along the Lewis and Clark River, about five miles from Astoria, Fort Clatsop was built as the last Corps of Discovery encampment before their return trip east to St. Louis. Lewis and Clark and their explorers overwintered in Fort Clatsop from early December 1805 to late March 1806. Today’s Fort Clatsop is an approximated copy of the original structure – there were no photos or descriptions of the original one.\n\nThere is an interesting interpretive center that offers an exhibit and two films about Lewis and Clark’s expedition. Rangers in period costumes lead visitors through the fort and several trailheads, the most interesting being those for the Netul River Trail and Fort to Sea Trail. The site is now part of the Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks. The park covers diverse habitats that include forests, lakes, rivers, wetlands and the coastal regions and offer wonderful recreational opportunities. Rangers offer a number of guided tours.

The bridge is 4.1 miles long and is located about 14 miles from the mouth of the Columbia River. It is the longest truss bridge on the North American continent.\n\nThe bridge was completed in 1966 and has one line of traffic in each direction.

It has only one car, popularly called \"Old 300,\" which was bought almost entirely through the donations of Astoria residents.
