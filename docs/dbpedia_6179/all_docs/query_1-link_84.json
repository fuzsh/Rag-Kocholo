The program requires a third-party callsign, which Foreflight provides. The result is two extra layers.\n\nAircraft N-Number: N1234A\n\nPIA N-Number: N9876Z\n\nFlight ID: FF567\n\nThe real N-Number is not broadcast. it all works fine for the FAA and ATC. The weird part is position reports at a nontowered airport. Using your N-Number becomes useless.\n\nWe think of it in terms of celebrities but I suspect it’s used by companies trying to avoid intellectual property theft and interference with advantageous relationships.\n\nAnd, needless to say, it’s not foolproof.\n\nLast edited: Feb 17, 2024\n\npilotshashi\n\nEjection Handle Pulled\n\nJoined\n\nJan 4, 2024\n\nMessages\n\n155\n\nLocation\n\nMiami Florida\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\npilotshashi\n\nFeb 17, 2024\n\n#11\n\nWith PIA, you change not only the flight ID, but the underlying ADS-B N-Number and hex code.

Not flying now but next time I do I'll take a couple pictures. Point it up above the horizon it will show planes above you, keep it level and it will show planes at your level.\n\nflyingron\n\nAdministrator\n\nJoined\n\nJul 31, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n24,608\n\nLocation\n\nCatawba, NC\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nFlyingRon\n\nFeb 18, 2024\n\n#27\n\nI dunno.
