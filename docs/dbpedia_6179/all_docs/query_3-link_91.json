You can stipulate, for example, administratorsâ€™ read-only or read-write access to subscriber data, their ability to create or edit groups, save templates, manage alert distribution lists, and much more. The interface will only show your administrators tools they can use, simplifying the system for people who need to quickly send alerts without distractions, and supporting distributed administration models within your organization. This enhances both ease of use and organizational security."
