ADSL enables voice and high-speed data to be sent simultaneously over the existing telephone line. This type of DSL is the most predominant in commercial use for business and residential customers around the world. Good for general Internet access and for applications where downstream speed is most important, such as video-on-demand. ITU-T Recommendation G.992.1 and ANSI Standard T1.413-1998 specify full rate ADSL. ITU Recommendation G.992.3 specifies ADSL2 which provides advanced diagnostics, power saving functions, PSD shaping, and slightly better performance than G.992.1. ITU Recommendation G.992.5 specifies ADSL2Plus, which provides the benefits of ADSL2Plus twice the bandwidth so that bit rates as high as 20 Mb/s downstream can be achieved on relatively short lines.\n\nAIS (Alarm Indication Signal) A signal, transmitted by a system within a communications link, which lets the receiver know that some part of the link has failed. Two types of AIS signals are Alarm Indication Signal Path (AIS-P) and Alarm Indication Signal Line (AIS-L).\n\nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) The coordinating body for voluntary standards groups within the United States. ANSI is a member of the International Standards Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nAmplifier Any device that uses a small amount of energy to control a source of a larger amount of energy.\n\nAmplitude Modulation (AM) A form of modulation in which the amplitude of a carrier wave is varied in direct proportion to that of a modulating signal.\n\nAsynchronous Replication A replication technique in which data must be committed to storage at only the primary site and not the secondary site before the write is acknowledged to the host. Data is then forwarded to the secondary site as the network capabilities permit.\n\nAsynchronous Serial Interface (ASI) A serial data transmission method for MPEG-2 that allows packet-based transmission of compressed video in DTV transmission.\n\nAsynchronous Transmission A method of data transmission which allows data bits to be sent at irregular intervals by preceding each with a start bit, and following it with a stop bit.\n\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) A cell relay network protocol which encodes data traffic into small fixed-sized (53 byte: 48 bytes of data and 5 bytes of header information) cells instead of variable-sized packets, as found in packet-switched networks such as the Internet Protocol or Ethernet. It is a connection-oriented technology, in which a connection is established between the two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\n\nATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) A process that converts data between higher level protocols such as IP and ATM. At the originating end of an ATM connection, AAL segments the higher level bundles of data into ATM cells. At the destination end of the connection, ATM reassembles the cells into the higher level bundles. AAL is divided into types, which in turn support specific types of data traffic.\n\nATM Adaptation Layer 1 Circuit Emulation (AAL1) AAL that supports constant bit rate traffic that cannot tolerate delays, such as uncompressed voice and video transmission.\n\nATM Adaptation Layer 2 Transport (AAL2) AAL that supports variable bit rate traffic such as compressed voice and video.\n\nATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) AAL that supports variable bit rate traffic that can be delayed.\n\nATM Service Access Multiplexer (ATM SAM) An ATM switch used by a service provider to aggregate various forms of subscriber traffic (such as T1 or Ethernet) for transmission over an ATM backbone.\n\nAttenuation (1) Limited Operation (1) The condition in a fiber optic link where operation is limited by the power of the received signal, rather than by bandwidth or by distortion. (2) The decrease in magnitude of power of a signal in transmission between points. A term used for expressing the total losses on an optical fiber consisting of the ratio of light output to light input. Attenuation is usually measured in decibels per kilometer (dB/km) at a specific wavelength. Typical multi-mode wavelengths are 850 and 1300 nanometers (nm); singlemode, at 1300 and 1500 nm. NOTE: When specifying attenuation, it is important to note if it is nominal or average, room temperature, value or maximum over operating range.\n\nAutomatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) A network enabling the automatic delivery of transport services, not only leased-line connections but also other transport services, such as soft permanent and switched optical connections.\n\nAutomatically Switched Transport Network (ASTN) A network that allows traffic paths to be set up automatically through a switched network. The term ASTN is often used interchangeably with GMPLS (Generalized MPLS).\n\nAvailability The amount of time that a system is available during time periods when it is expected to be available. Availability is often measured as a percentage of an elapsed year. For example, 99.95% availability equates to 4.38 hours of downtime in a year (0.0005 * 365 * 24=4.38) for a system that is expected to be available all the time. (Provided by SNIA)\n\nB\n\nBackup A collection of data stored on (usually removable) non-volatile storage media for purposes of recovery in case the original copy of data is lost or becomes inaccessible. Also called backup copy. To be useful for recovery, a backup must be made by copying the source data image when it is in a consistent state.\n\nBackup Window An interval of time during which a set of data can be backed up without seriously affecting applications that use the data. For example, if an application accesses data from 8AM until midnight, then the window between midnight and 8AM is available for making backup copies. Offline backups require that applications not update data during the backup. Online backups typically use point-in-time copy technology to create consistent images of data for backup.\n\nBackbone (1) The part of a network used as the primary path for transporting traffic between network segments. (2) A high-speed line, or a series of connections, that forms a major pathway within a network.\n\nBandwidth (1) Measure of the information capacity of a transmission channel. (2) The difference between the highest and lowest frequencies of a band that can be passed by a transmission medium without undue distortion, such as the AM band - 535 to 1705 kilohertz.

Also known as Bit Error Ratio.\n\nBits Per Second (b/ps) (1) The number of bits passing a point every second. The transmission rate for digital information. (2) A measurement of how fast data is moved from one place to another (i.e., a 28.8 modem can move 28,800 b/s).\n\nBlock The unit in which data is stored and retrieved on disk and tape devices. Blocks are the atomic unit of data recognition (through a preamble and block header) and protection. A unit of application data from a single information category that is transferred within a single sequence.\n\nBroadband (1) The ability of a system to carry a multitude of signals simultaneously. In data transmission, it denotes transmission facilities capable of handling frequencies greater than those required for high-grade voice communications. The higher frequency allows the carrying of several simultaneous channels. Broadband infers the use of a service provider signal rather than direct modulation (i.e., baseband).\n\nBuffer-to-Buffer Flow Control Flow control that occurs between two directly connected Fibre Channel ports. A port indicates the number of frames buffers that can be sent to it (its buffer credit), before the sender is required to stop transmitting and wait for the receipt of a \"ready\" indication.\n\nC\n\nCable Modem A modem used by a subscriber for high-speed network access over a coaxial cable, such as those used traditionally to provide cable television service.\n\nCable Modem Termination System (CMTS) Equipment used to provide high-speed data services, such as cable Internet or Voice-over-IP, to cable subscribers.\n\nCarrier A company that provides communications circuits. Carriers are either \"private\" or \"common.\" A \"private\" carrier can refuse service. A \"common\" carrier cannot.

Service Provider\n\nCategory 5 Cable (CAT 5) An unshielded, twisted-pair cable designed for high signal integrity. The twisting of the cable reduces electrical interference, and the plastic insulation has low dispersion, so the dielectric constant of the plastic does not depend greatly on frequency.\n\nCentral Office (CO) (1) The place where common carriers, or service providers, terminate customer lines and locate the switching equipment that interconnects those lines. (2) A centralized location for the Switching, Transmission and Power equipment that provide telephone service.\n\nChannel (1) A communication path. Multiple channels can be multiplexed over a single cable in certain environments. The term is also used to describe the specific path between large computers and attached peripherals. (2) In the case of fiber optic-based transmission systems, an electrical or photonic communications path, between two or more points of termination. (3) The smallest subdivision of a circuit that provides a type of communication service, usually a path with only one direction. (4) A communications path, or the signal sent over that channel. Through multiplexing, several channels can be transmitted over an optical channel.\n\nChromatic Dispersion Spreading of a light pulse caused by the difference in refractive indices at different wavelengths.\n\nCircuit A group of electronic components and their interconnections.\n\nClass of Service (CoS) A queuing discipline in which an algorithm compares fields of packets or CoS tags to classify packets and assign them to queues of differing priority. CoS does not ensure network performance or guarantee priority in delivering packets.\n\nClient An intelligent device or system that requests services from other intelligent devices, systems or appliances. cf.

In deregulated telecommunications markets, competing service providers often need to share (indeed, may be required by law to share) a number of physical facilities, such as a central office building and long distance trunks. Typically, established incumbent service providers are required to share their existing facilities with newer competitive service providers. The fact of collocation may limit the amount of space available to a service provider in a given facility, making it desirable for the service provider to fit a large amount of equipment in a comparatively small space.\n\nCompression The process of encoding data to reduce its size. Lossless compression utilizes a technique that preserves the entire content of the original data, and from which the original data can be reconstructed exactly.\n\nConcatenation A mechanism for allocating very large amounts of bandwidth for transport of a payload associated with a 'superrate service', which is a service at a transmission rate greater than the normal maximum rate of OC-1. The set of bits in the payload is treated as a single entity, as opposed to being treated as separate bits or bytes or time slots. Therefore, the payload is accepted, multiplexed, switched, transported and delivered as a single, contiguous chunk of payload data.\n\nD\n\nData Communications Equipment (DCE) In a data station, the equipment that provides the signal conversion and coding between the data terminal equipment (DTE) and the line. The DCE may be separate equipment, intermediate equipment, or an integral part of the DTE. A DCE may perform other functions usually performed at the network end of the line.\n\nData-over-Cable Service Interface Specification (DoCSIS) An international standard which defines the communications and operation-support interface requirements for a data-over-cable system. Also permits the addition of high-speed data transfer to an existing cable TV system.\n\nData Rate The number of bits of information transmitted per second, as in a data transmission link. Typically expressed as megabits per second (Mb/s).\n\nData Terminating Equipment (DTE) The part of a data station that serves as a data source (originates data for transmission), a data sink (accepts transmitted data), or both.\n\nDecibel (dB) Unit for measuring the relative strength of a signal.

This level of carrier can transport 28 DS1 level signals and 672 DS0 level channels within its payload.\n\nDigital Subscriber Line (DSL) A method of providing high-speed data services over the twisted pair copper wires traditionally used to provide POTS. Types of DSL include ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line), HDSL (high data rate digital subscriber line), SDSL (single line digital subscriber line), and VDSL (very high data rate digital subscriber line).\n\nDigital Wrapper A structured text file that binds digital object content files and their associated metadata together, and that specifies the logical relationship of the content files.\n\nDisaster Recovery (DR) The recovery of data, access to data and associated processing through a comprehensive process of setting up a redundant site (equipment and work space) with recovery of operational data to continue business operations after a loss of use of all or part of a data center. This involves not only an essential set of data but also an essential set of all the hardware and software to continue processing of that data and business. This may involve down time to perform the recovery.\n\nDispersion The cause of bandwidth limitations in a fiber. Dispersion causes a broadening of input pulses along the length of the fiber. Three major types of dispersion include: (a) mode dispersion, caused by differential optical path lengths in a multimode fiber; (b) material dispersion, caused by a differential delay of various wavelengths of light in a waveguide material; and (c) waveguide dispersion, caused by light traveling in both the core and cladding materials in single-mode fibers.\n\nDual Link A 3 Gb/s nominal interface used in applications (such as digital cinema) requiring greater fidelity and resolution than standard HDTV can provide.\n\nE\n\nE1 The European version of the T1 digital transmission link with a line bit rate of 2.048 megabits per second (as used by European Conference of European and Postal Telecommunication [CEPT] Administrations service providers).\n\nElement Management System (EMS) A platform supporting multiple WDM spans to provide Network Management services.\n\nErbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) EDFAs differ from the normal method of regenerative or electro-optic repeaters in that light does not have to be converted to an electrical signal, amplified, and then converted back to light. Optical amplifiers contain a length of fiber that is doped with erbium (a rare earth substance) that provides the gain medium, and a LASER source that \"pumps\" the doped fiber with light at the correct frequency to thereby amplify an input optical signal. One of the most important features, after the fact that EDFAs are not frequency-dependent, is that they allow bandwidth upgrades (within limits) without replacing the entire transmission system.\n\nErrored Seconds (ES) A performance monitoring parameter. ES \"Type A\" is a second with exactly one error, ES \"Type B\" is a second with more than one and less than the number of errors in a severely errored second (SES) for the given signal. ES by itself means the sum of the type A and B ESs.\n\nEnterprise Systems Connection A 200 Mb/s serial I/O bus used on IBM Corporation's Enterprise System 9000 data center computers. Abbreviated ESCON. Similar to Fibre Channel in many respects, ESCON is based on redundant switches to link computers and storage subsystems using serial optical connections.\n\nEthernet The predominant local area networking technology, based on packetized transmissions between physical ports over a variety of electrical and optical media. Ethernet can transport any of several upper-layer protocols, the most popular of which is TCP/IP. Ethernet standards are maintained by the IEEE 802.3 committee.

IGMP is used by IP hosts and adjacent multicast routers to establish multicast group memberships. It is an integral part of the IP multicast specification.\n\nInternet Protocol (IP) A protocol that provides connectionless best effort delivery of data across heterogeneous physical networks. Data is broken down into a number of small bundles known as packets, and each packet gets transmitted to the destination separately, possibly along a different route than other packets from the same message. Packets are often retransmitted utilizing TCP when data is dropped due to over constrained routing.\n\nInternet Protocol Television (IPTV) A system where a digital television service is delivered to subscribers using Internet Protocol over a broadband connection.

The MAC differs for the various physical media (such as Ethernet, token ring, WLAN). The MAC sub-layer is primarily concerned with:\n\nrecognizing where frames begin and end in the bit-stream received from the physical layer (when receiving)\n\ndelimiting the frames (when sending), inserting information (e.g. some extra bits) into or among the frames being sent so that the receiver(s) are able to recognize the beginning and end of the frames\n\ndetecting transmission errors by means of inserting a checksum into every frame sent, recalculating, and comparing them on the receiver side\n\ninserting the source and destination MAC addresses into every frame transmitted\n\nfiltering out the frames intended for the station by verifying the destination address in the received frames\n\ncontrolling access to the physical transmission medium (which of the stations attached to the wire or frequency range has the right to transmit)\n\nMegabits per Second (Mb/s or Mbps) A digital transmission speed of millions of bits per second.\n\nManagement Information Base (MIB) The specification and formal description of a set of objects and variables that can be read and possibly written using the SNMP protocol.

The asymmetric nature of fiber causes the two polarization modes to experience slightly different conditions and travel along the fiber at slightly different speeds. Primarily an issue for communications systems operating at rates faster than 2.5 Gb/s.\n\nPort A port can be an entrance to or exit from a network element. It can be a connection point for a peripheral device or an application program. It can be logical, physical or both.

The key differentiating feature of a ROADM is the ability to switch traffic and both the wavelength and SONET/SDH layers. ROADM functionality is not new; indeed most long-haul DWDM equipment has built-in ROADM functionality. What's new is the appearance of these features in purpose-built metro optical gear, an application that has been long hyped but is only now beginning to gain support.\n\nRegional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) Local telephone companies created in 1984 as part of the break-up of AT&T. The six RBOCs were Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, Bell South, NYNEX, Southwestern Bell and U.S.West.

The devices are designed for use with small form factor (SFF) connectors, and offer high speed and physical compactness, and are hot-swappable. SFP transceivers are expected to perform at data speeds of up to five gigabits per second (5 Gb/s), and possibly higher. Because SFP modules can be easily interchanged, electro-optical or fiber optic networks can be upgraded and maintained more conveniently than has been the case with traditional soldered-in modules. Rather than replacing an entire circuit board containing several soldered-in modules, a single module can be removed and replaced for repair or upgrading. This can result in a substantial cost savings, both in maintenance and in upgrading efforts.\n\nSONET/SDH SONET is a contraction of synchronous optical network, the ANSI (North American) standard for transmitting data over fiber optic lines; SDH is an abbreviation of synchronous digital hierarchy, the ITU-T (European) standard for transmitting data over fiber optic lines.\n\nStandard Definition Television (SDTV) Television systems that have a lower resolution than HDTV systems.

A SAN consists of a communication infrastructure, which provides physical connections, and a management layer, which organizes the connections, storage elements, and computer systems so that data transfer is secure and robust. The term SAN is usually (but not necessarily) identified with the Fibre Channel protocol and block I/O services rather than file access services.\n\nStatistical Multiplexing A method for combining multiple calls onto a single line by giving priority to subscribers according to the volume of data they're trying to transmit at any given time. For example, a subscriber who typically transmits a large volume of data at a certain time of day (say, 5:00PM), but who transmits relatively little data during the rest of any given day, may ordinarily have a low priority in the overall multiplexing scheme for the line, but may be given a much higher priority at 5:00 when the subscriber transmits the bulk of its traffic.\n\nSwitch A network infrastructure component to which multiple nodes attach. Unlike hubs, switches typically have internal bandwidth that is a multiple of link bandwidth, and the ability to rapidly switch node connections from one to another. A typical switch can accommodate several simultaneous full link bandwidth transmissions between different pairs of nodes.

Tunneling works by encapsulating the first network protocol within packets carried by the second protocol. A tunnel may also encapsulate a protocol within itself (e.g., an IPsec gateway operates in this fashion, encapsulating IP in IP and inserting additional IPsec information between the two IP headers).\n\nU\n\nUnidirectional Path Switched Ring (UPSR) A method of providing redundancy for fiber optic lines on SONET rings. The SONET ring consists of two fiber optic lines, each carrying the same traffic, but transmitting it in opposite directions around the ring. If one line fails, the backup line is already carrying the same traffic.\n\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) An Internet protocol that provides connectionless datagram delivery service to applications. Abbreviated UDP.

Several VLANs can co-exist on a single physical switch.\n\nVirtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) A non-proprietary redundancy protocol designed to increase the availability of the default gateway servicing hosts on the same subnet. This increased reliability is achieved by advertising a \"virtual router\" (an abstract representation of master and backup routers acting as a group) as a default gateway to the host(s) instead of one physical router. Two or more physical routers are then configured to stand for the virtual router, with only one doing the actual routing at any given time. If the current physical router that is routing the data on behalf of the virtual router fails, an arrangement is made for another physical router to automatically replace it. The physical router that is currently forwarding data on behalf of the virtual router is called the master router. Physical routers standing by to take over from the master router in case something goes wrong are called backup routers.\n\nVirtualization The act of integrating one or more (back end) services or functions with additional (front end) functionality for the purpose of providing useful abstractions. Virtualization typically hides some of the back end complexity, or adds or integrates new functionality with existing back end services.
