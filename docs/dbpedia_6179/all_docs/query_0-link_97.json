        "text": "Please note that the rules specifies \"at the end of each communication\" not \"at the end of each transmission\". It would be legal for a ham to have a series of short transmissions without giving their ID (so long as they don't reach the 10 minute limit or end their communication during those, which would require they give their ID). Obviously they would still need to ID at the start of the communication to be legal.\n\nThis conversation would be legal per the FCC ID rules:\n\nW1ABC: K9XYZ this is W1ABC, are you around?\n\nK9XYZ: W1ABC, this is K9XYZ. Hello Fred.\n\nW1ABC: Hi Bob. Did you get much wind or hail this afternoon? We nearly lost a tree here.\n\nK9XYZ: It was bad here, but we didn't get any damage. You need some help cleaning up?\n\nW1ABC: No, just some small limbs and leaves. They're already picked up.\n\nK9XYZ: Glad to hear that.\n\n[they talk for a while, nearing the 10 min mark]\n\nW1ABC: This is W1ABC for ID.\n\nK9XYZ: This is K9XYZ for ID.\n\nW1ABC: Don't forget the club meeting tomorrow night at 7 PM.\n\nK9XYZ: Thanks for reminding me. I'll make sure it's on my schedule.\n\nW1ABC: Lori said that dinner's ready so I'd better go eat before they scarf it all up.\n\nK9XYZ: See you tomorrow evening then. Have a good dinner. I'll be clear on your final. This is K9XYZ.\n\nW1ABC: See you tomorrow evening. I'll be clear and QSY to the dinning room. This is W1ABC.\n\nI don't say \"for ID\" when I give my call, your callsign is your ID so therefore it's implied.\n\nTrue, but saying \"for ID\" is useful to remind others that it could be time for them to ID as well.\n\nOne thing they do locally on some nets is have a group ID time every 10 mins of net time. By \"group ID\" I don't mean a single ID for the whole net, but more of a \"On 3 give your IDs, 1, 2, 3, ...\". While it's a massive multiple pile up of IDs (and nearly impossible to hear most of them), it allows everyone to ID their station without taking up lots of net time. I'm not sure that everyone talking at once giving their IDs goes with the spirit of the rule, it's how those nets make sure that everyone has a chance to ID to satisfy the every 10 minutes rule. They also remind folks to ID at the end of their transmission if they fail to do so on their own.\n\nIt's a common misconception, not just among newer hams but long time hams as well.\n\nThis is what I was talking about.\n\nI am aware of the regulatory requirements, when you MUST ID (at the end of a communications or every 10 minutes during a communication). I am aware of the habit of some hams of IDing at the beginning and end of every, or almost every, transmission, and to tell the truth that does not bother me greatly. I will say that on HF, in a round table, I tend to throw my callsign and all the other stations involved callsigns at the end of every transmission, if for no other reason than to identify who I am turning it over to. In a one-on-one it depends on conditions.\n\nWhat I am asking is how often are you running into people who think (incorrectly) it is a requirement, actually codified, that they begin and end each transmission with their callsign or include their callsign in each transmission? It has been a while since I took any of the tests, but I kind of remember that being one or two questions on the exams.\n\nI don&#8217;t really have a problem with people over identifying, they seem to be balanced out by folks under identifying, but I do dislike seeing folks who think it is a requirement, without knowing the truth. The video I linked was an example, but what spurred the question was a local 2M simplex conversation in the last week where a mobile jumped in on our regular group round table and suggested we should all be IDing each transmission, because that was the rule, and we were all &#8220;in violation&#8221;. And no matter what we told this station about the contents of the rules he insisted we had to ID every transmission.\n\nT!\n\nI will say that on HF, in a round table, I tend to throw my callsign and all the other stations involved callsigns at the end of every transmission,)))\n\nI have a name for that.\n\nI call that french kissing with callsigns.\n\nYou won't hear me doing that.\n\n(((What I am asking is how often are you running into people who think (incorrectly) it is a requirement, actually codified, that they begin and end each transmission with their callsign or include their callsign in each transmission?

I think more often than not, they do so out of habit and they tend to do it (callsign-Frenching) on particular repeaters where that is the cultural practice but not on others leading me to believe they know it is not a requirement. It's mainly on repeaters with a high concentration of people who spend most of their time on HF. And I think they do it to help themselves memorize callsigns. If they do it over and over again, they memorize the callsign.\n\n(((I don&#8217;t really have a problem with people over identifying, they seem to be balanced out by folks under identifying, but I do dislike seeing folks who think it is a requirement, without knowing the truth.

And no matter what we told this station about the contents of the rules he insisted we had to ID every transmission.\n\nWell here's how I deal with it when someone sticks their proverbial tongue in my mouth to romantically intertwine our callsigns. I just don't do it back.\n\nUsually within a few transmissions of not having me return with...\n\n\"[their callsign], [my callsign], [transmission], back over to you [their callsign], [my callsign]\" but instead\n\n\"[transmission]\"\n\nthey get the hint.\n\nI guess save it for HF? I dunno.\n\nI ID for the sake of IDing not for a filler of otherwise dead air and I use people's first names when directing traffic towards or passing it over to them in a QSO.\n\nI'm not saying the way you do it or the way anyone else does it is WRONG. Just that this is how I do it. It may because I spend all my time on local bands and not on HF. (Not that there's anything wrong with that)\n\nTrue, but saying \"for ID\" is useful to remind others that it could be time for them to ID as well.\n\n.\n\nI was having a conversation with another operator one time and everytime he would say his callsign he always said 'for ID'.\n\nIn turn I would then say my callsign and say 'for Saturday'.\n\nAfter a while of doing this, he asked me why I kept saying 'for Saturday'.\n\nI told him I was just correcting him because he kept telling everyone it was Friday when it was actually Saturday.\n\nTook him a minute but he finally got it, I don't think he ever said 'for ID' again after that evening.\n\nSomething else operators need to do is slow down when they say their callsigns. Be proud of your callsign and say it so others, who might not know you, can understand what you are saying."
