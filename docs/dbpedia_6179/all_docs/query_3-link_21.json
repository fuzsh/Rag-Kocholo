        "text": "The real meaning of FAB in Thunderbirds…\n\nThis has got to be one of the most asked questions: What does FAB stand for in Thunderbirds?\n\nWell here’s the answer in one simple word: Nothing!\n\nIn the 60’s the buzzword was “fabulous”. This was shortened to FAB and used simply as a call sign like ‘Roger’ or ‘Ten-Four’ to acknowledge received instructions. If it was an acronym, then the best suggestion we’ve heard for a potential meaning is “Fully Acknowledged Broadcast”. So now, next time someone asks you what FAB stands for, you can give them the authoritative answer: nothing!\n\nAre you disappointed with the answer to the often-asked question: What does FAB stand for in Thunderbirds? It’s Gerry Anderson’s official answer and was repeated by many members of the crew who worked on the show at the time.\n\nBut what does Jeff Tracy say? If you’d like an in-universe answer to the question then look no further. Check out the video below:\n\nThere are a few apocryphal tales on this too. A couple of callers to an LBC radio show a few years ago cited these answers:\n\nName: Derek, Maida Vale\n\nQualification: Huge Thunderbirds fan\n\nAnswer: I used to collect all Thunderbirds comic books and in one issue only, FAB stood For Always Brothers. I once won a competition in Smash Hits magazine with this very answer!\n\n(James O’Brien: But your comic probably wasn’t written by Gerry Anderson)\n\nName: David, Chelmsford\n\nQualification: Overheard it from Gerry Anderson’s son on a plane journey\n\nAnswer: It means Fully Audible Broadcast.\n\n(James O’Brien: I’m not buying it. I’ve got it from the horse’s mouth!)\n\nBut even if a Thunderbirds comic book did state that FAB stood for ‘for always brothers’ it was certainly retrofitted. And ‘fully audible broadcast’?! We don’t think so.\n\nTo reiterate, and put this to bed once and for all:\n\nFAB doesn’t stand for anything! It was just a cool-sounding callsign invented by Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson to mean ‘affirmative’, but it’s not an acronym. Sorry folks!\n\nWant to read more about Thunderbirds?\n\nListen to the Genesis of Thunderbirds story on the Gerry Anderson Podcast\n\nWatch the Thunderbirds prequel story on our YouTube channel\n\nRead about the beginnings of International Rescue\n\nAnd while you’re here… Check out our FAB Thunderbirds merch!"
