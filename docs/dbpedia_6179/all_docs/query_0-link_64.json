        "text": "As of 1st of November 2023, the following countries and regional economic organisations have ratified or acceded to the Convention.\n\nAfghanistan, Albania, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bhutan, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, China, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Côte d’Ivoire, Cyprus, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Ethiopia, European Community, Fiji, Gabon, Ghana, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, the Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, New Zealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay , Qatar, the Republic of Moldova , Romania, the Republic of San Marino, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Syrian Arab Republic, The Kingdom of Swaziland, The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Tajikistan, Togo, Türkiye, Ukraine, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\n\nOf these eighty-seven, three have not ratified the Aircraft Protocol. These are Seychelles, Syrian Arab Republic and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands comprises of several territorial units, the structure of which has changed recently. Further research may be required by you. Pursuant to Article 52, paragraph 1, of the Convention and Article XXIX of the Protocol, the Kingdom of the Netherlands declares that the Convention and the Protocol are to apply to the following territorial units, the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. Please consult UNIDROIT website (www.unidroit.org) and your legal advisors or both if your query relates to any of the following territories: the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Caribbean part of the Netherlands (the islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba), European part of the Netherlands, Curacao and Sint Maarten.\n\nPursuant to Article 52 of the Convention and Article XXIX of the Protocol, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland declares that the United Kingdom’s Ratification shall be extended to the Island of Guernsey, the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar. In a subsequent declaration the United Kingdom’s Ratification was also extended to Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The United Kingdom’s Instruments of Ratification and subsequent declarations are available on the International Registry website and contain further information regarding the applicability of the Convention and Protocol to these territories.\n\nPursuant to Article 52 of the Convention and Article XXIX of the Protocol, the Kingdom of Denmark declares that until further decision, the Convention will not apply to the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n\nArticle 54(2) of the Cape Town Convention requires that a Contracting State, at the time of its accession to a Protocol, must make the declaration specified in that Article. Costa Rica did not make a declaration under Article 54(2) at the time of the deposit of its Instrument of Accession on 26 August 2011. UNIDROIT was therefore not able to accept the deposit of the Instrument of Accession to the extent that the instrument relates to the Aircraft Protocol. Subsequently on 8 August 2018, the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica deposited its declaration under Article 54(2) of the Cape Town Convention, thus permitting UNIDROIT to accept the deposit of the instrument of accession in respect of the Protocol to the Convention.\n\nThe UNIDROIT website is an excellent source of information on the status of ratifications, declarations and designations and may be consulted for free.\n\nSee the section 12 of the Regulations for a detailed explanation of Entry Points including Authorising Entry Points or AEPs.\n\nAn AEP code is a code provided by an Authorising Entry Point and must be entered at time of registration where the registration is to be made on an airframe or helicopter for which the state is the state of registry or has taken regulatory steps to so become.\n\nCurrently, Mexico, China, Albania, the United Arab Emirates, Côte d’Ivoire, the USA, Brazil, the Ukraine, Viet Nam, Spain and Argentina have elected to implement AEP codes. So, if your airframe or helicopter is registered in one of these states, you must get a code from their designated AEP before making a registration with the International Registry. Some exemptions exist as noted in Regulation 12.8.\n\nThe AEPs for each state are now listed:\n\nUSA:\n\nFor the USA, the AEP code is provided by the FAA - please see link below:\n\nhttp://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Form/AC8050-135.pdf for further information.\n\nMexico:\n\nFor Mexico, the AEP code is provided by the Mexican Aeronautical Record:\n\nMexican Aeronautical Record\n\nBlvd. Adolfo López Mateos #1990,\n\nCol.

A link will be sent to the email address entered in order to validate it. Once the validation link is clicked on within 24 hours you will be able to log in as a guest. As a Guest you can Search Registrations, Entities, Contracting States and view help documentation. Guest Users will have access to their invoices in a dedicated “Payment” area, and their own Search History, containing any Priority Search Certificates created while logged into the guest account.\n\nThere are three options when applying to become an approved user on the Registry:\n\n1. Become the Administrator of a new Entity\n\n2. Become the Administrator of an Entity already on the International Registry\n\n3. Become a User of an Entity already on the International Registry\n\nThe options are described below.\n\n1. Become the Administrator of a new Entity\n\nFor your first application you will be required to enter your details (all subsequent applications this information will be prepopulated for you), the details of a person who is designated as the Back-Up Contact and details of the entity or the natural person you are applying on behalf of. Once your application is complete and payment is taken, the system automatically emails the Back-Up Contact and you (the Administrator).\n\nYou and must read the email and provide the information requested. You will receive a phone call from the International Registry to check some details if it is your first time applying as an Administrator. If all is in order you will be approved. You will then receive an email with a link. This link allows you to complete your application and create your digital certificate. Once completed you can log on to the International Registry as an approved administrator.\n\nPlease check the following items are entered correctly when submitting the application:\n\nI. Entity or Natural person details\n\nII. Administrator applicant details\n\nIII. Back-Up Contact details, (the back-up contact cannot be the same person as the Administrator).\n\n2. Become the Administrator of an Entity already on the International Registry\n\nYou may need to do this when a previous Administrator leaves the company or when the entity wishes to change administrator. The Administrator account can be disabled by the Administrator themselves if they can log in, a Registry Official when requested by the Administrator, the Back-Up Contact, or an officer of the company.\n\nOnce the Administrator account is disabled a new person may apply to be the Administrator. They will need to Login to their Guest Account and select Apply’, 'Become the Administrator of an Entity already on the International Registry' from the application options. An entity will only be searchable in this section if the previous Administrator is disabled. If the licence of the previous Administrator has not expired the new administrator may apply to replace the outgoing Administrator and take over the remainder of the licence term at a reduced cost of $50 USD.\n\nIf the licence of the previous administrator is expired or close to expiry then an application for a new full one year licence should be made.\n\nOnce the application is completed as instructed, a Registry Official will review your application and approve if all details are in order. Please follow the instructions in the emails you will receive when you apply.\n\n3. Become a User of an Entity already on the International Registry\n\nIf you wish to apply to become a new user for an existing entity, please select this option. You are required to search for and select the entity you are applying for and where provided enter your user details.\n\nThe administrator of your entity will be required to review your application and approve the request. Once approved you will receive an email containing a link; this will allow you to complete your application and create your digital certificate .\n\nThe Registry Officials do not review your details or approve you. This is done by the Entity Administrator.\n\nUnderstanding the Search Algorithm, described below, is important for a user wishing to conduct a thorough search of the International Registry system. The user enters an MSN (Manufacturer Serial Number). Although this is called a number it often also contains letters and special characters such as dashes or spaces.\n\nObjects Searched:\n\nThe IR system does an MSN search of all objects upon which registrations have previously been made or which have been provided by manufacturers, returning matches and near matches.\n\nSearch String:\n\nThree search strings are used i.e. compared against objects in the IR database. These are:\n\n• Exact String: The full MSN entered by the user.\n\n• Exact String Without Leading Zero: The MSN entered by the user, with any leading ‘0’ removed.\n\n• Stripped String*: An alpha-numeric only version of the MSN entered by the user.\n\n*In this case, the search string used is the MSN entered by the user with all characters removed except letters and digits. So, if a user enters \"AB-515C 9\" as the MSN, the IR system, in this case, will use AB515C9 as the search string.\n\nTwo types of searches are done, one looking for a match and one looking for a near match as described below. All searches are case insensitive.\n\nOrder of Results\n\nThe results of the MSN search are returned in the following order:\n\n1. Exact String Match: All objects that match the Exact String.\n\n2. Exact String Without Leading Zero Match: All objects that match the Exact String Without Leading Zero.\n\n3. Exact String Near Match: All objects containing the Exact String, ordered in ascending MSN order (alpha numerically).\n\n4. Stripped String Match: All objects matching the Stripped String.\n\n5. Stripped String Near Match: All objects containing the Stripped String, ordered in ascending MSN order (alpha numerically).\n\nNote: There could be more than one match if the same serial number is used by several manufacturers, or by one manufacturer for different models, or if the MSN was entered by a user with a different Manufacturer or Model identifier or for other reason.\n\nFor the 'Stripped String' (4 & 5 above) - we also compare the stripped version of the entered MSN with a stripped version of the objects in the database e.g. if the user enters MSN '12-34', the search could return MSN '1-234567' or '1-23/4'.\n\nExample:\n\nUser Enters MSN: 0A500-0\n\nThe results come back as follows:\n\nAll MSNs containing an Exact String Match have that portion highlighted in bold (as illustrated above).\n\nRegisterable non-consensual rights or interests – Article 40 Cape Town Convention\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment signed at Cape Town on 16 November 2001 (the “Convention”) contemplates two types of non-consensual rights or interests. The first type (Article 39) relates to those non-consensual rights or interests created by the law of a Contracting State which have priority, without registration, over an interest in an aircraft object equivalent to that of the holder of a registered international interest, and with respect to which a Contracting State has made a declaration under Article 39. The second type (registerable non-consensual rights or interests – Article 40 (“RNCRIs”)) are, again, non-consensual rights or interests and like Article 39 require a declaration to be made by a Contracting State. However, unlike Article 39 rights or interests, such rights or interests must also be registered on the International Registry (“IR”) in order for them to have any effect.\n\nArticle 39 and 40 are mutually exclusive in that a Contracting State is prohibited from making a declaration covering the same rights or interests under both Articles. Article 39(1)(a) relates to “categories of non-consensual right or interest (other than a right or interest to which Article 40 applies)”. A Contracting State is, however, permitted to cover rights or interests of the same nature under both Articles, provided such rights or interests are differentiated from each other.\n\nAs stated, non-consensual rights or interests with respect to which a Contracting State has made a declaration under Article 40 of the Convention are treated like registered international interests and have priority over later registered interests and unregistered registerable interests. Unlike other international interests, an Article 40 registration can be made unilaterally by the purported creditor, without the consent of the alleged debtor. This feature, whilst necessary, in certain circumstances, to preserve the rights of affected creditors with legitimate rights under Article 40, and who make such registrations bona fide, is open to abuse by users of the IR to make unwarranted or malicious registrations without foundation under the Convention.\n\nRequirements of a valid RNCRI\n\nIn order to register a valid RNCRI on the IR the following requirements need to be satisfied:\n\n(a) A Contracting State must have made a declaration pursuant to Article 40 of the Convention specifying the particular categories of interests protected by such Article 40 declaration; and\n\n(b) A right must have arisen in that Contracting State which is protected by the categories of interests specified in the declaration made.\n\nAny rights arising pursuant to Article 39 of the Convention cannot be registered as RNCRIs as they are rights having priority without registration. It is only rights arising in a Contracting State which are the subject of such Contracting State’s Article 40 declaration that can be registered on the IR.\n\nA list of declarations made by a particular Contracting State can be verified, free of charge, by conducting a Contracting State Search on the IR website, which will produce a Contracting State Search Certificate.\n\nWhat to do where an improper RNCRI has been registered against an aircraft object?\n\nIn circumstances where a person believes that an RNCRI has been erroneously or incorrectly made against an aircraft object, appropriate legal advice should be obtained to ascertain whether a demand should be made, pursuant to Article 25(4) of the Convention, against the holder of the RNCRI demanding the prompt discharge of the interest, on the basis that it does not qualify as an RNCRI. If, following legal advice a demand is made but the required discharge is not forthcoming, further legal advice should be sought to ascertain how best to proceed to protect the affected person’s interests.\n\nTo date, several legal proceedings have been brought before the Irish courts seeking the discharge of improper RNCRIs. The Irish courts have demonstrated that frivolous, improper or unwarranted registrations on the IR may be discharged at the direction of the Irish Courts and at the expense of the registrant. The Irish courts, being the courts in the jurisdiction in which the Registrar has its centre of administration, have also demonstrated a willingness to accept jurisdiction to hear the substantive cause of action in disputes relating to registrations originating entirely outside Ireland under the provisions of the Convention. This approach, coupled with the speedy resolution of such disputes by the Irish Commercial Court, greatly aids the proper and efficient functioning of the IR, and provides comfort to parties seeking to discharge frivolous, improper or unwarranted RNCRIs that such discharges can be done in a timely, effective and efficient manner.\n\nAffected persons should also be aware that it is possible to seek the discharge of improper RNCRIs in their local courts. Any order would, in circumstances where the holder of the RNCRI fails to comply, need to be brought to Ireland and enforced through the Irish courts, if the RNCRI is to be discharged by the Registrar. The Convention states that the courts in the place in which the Registrar has its centre of administration have exclusive jurisdiction to award damages or make orders against the Registrar (Article 44).\n\nPotential implications of making an improper or malicious RNCRI\n\nRegistry user entities should carefully consider whether a legitimate interest has arisen before registering an RNCRI. Successful litigation has previously been brought by parties whose interests have been affected by incorrect RNCRI registrations, which were not discharged following demand by the affected parties, and the parties who registered incorrect RNCRIs were ordered to pay the costs of such litigation. In addition registry user entities should be mindful that, in circumstances where there is no legitimate legal basis under the Convention for making an RNCRI, in addition to being ordered to discharge the RNCRI, the registering party could also potentially be the subject of other legal proceedings for, inter alia, damages, brought by the affected party.\n\nThe Registrar of the IR also has the right, pursuant to Procedure 10.10 of the Regulations and Procedures for the International Registry (Eight Edition - 2019), to disable the account of a registry user entity’s administrator or user at any time when, in its view, there exists a material risk of fraudulent registrations or other misuse.\n\nIn these circumstances, if in doubt, professional advice should always be sought before proceeding with an RNCRI.\n\nFor further information regarding Articles 39 and 40, we would recommend the following texts / websites:\n\n• Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment and Protocol Thereto on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment, Official Commentary (Third Edition, 2013, UNIDROIT) - Professor Sir Roy Goode (http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/mobile-equipment/publications/commentaryconvention&aircraftprotocol.pdf) and the Annotations issued thereto by the Cape Town Convention Academic Project with Professor Sir Roy Goode’s personal endorsement (http://cdm15895.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/officialcommentary);\n\n• Practitioners’ Guide to the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Protocol (published October 2020 by the Aviation Working Group and prepared by its Legal Advisory Panel - http://awg.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Practitioners-Guide-to-the-Cape-Town-Convention-and-Aircraft-Protocol-October-2020.pdf);\n\n• Aviation Working Group (http://www.awg.aero/projects/capetownconvention/); and\n\n• Cape Town Convention Academic Project (http://www.ctcap.org/).\n\nThis briefing is designed to provide a summary of certain aspects of Articles 39 and 40 of the Cape Town Convention.
