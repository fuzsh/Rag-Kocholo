Today, we’re heard online and in stores, clubs and offices—and in 2022 we introduced two new DJs: Kirby Gwen and Chris Bobbitt!\n\nWith the arrival of these two new superstars, we brought live entertainment to new heights across the world of Walmart and Sam’s Club!\n\nWhile WMW Radio personalities have changed over the years, the energy level has not!\n\nA Look Back\n\nFor several years, the voice at the heart of it all was Terry Berry, the original Walmart Radio legend. (Fun fact: This smooth talker remains at Walmart as a Facilitator at Walmart Academy but returned to the radio studio for a few encore shows in 2021, pictured below with DJ Bo and former DJ Antonio.)"
