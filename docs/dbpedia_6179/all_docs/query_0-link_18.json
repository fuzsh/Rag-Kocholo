        "text": "Since 2020, Winlink Global Radio Email®️ has supported and participated with the US Geological Survey (USGS) in the world's largest earthquake exercise. Past participation has been primarily concentrated within California. However, the 2023 Great ShakeOut exercise Winlink participation included an expanded effort by FEMA and their stakeholders, designed to highlight the utility of the Winlink system for emergency management. With Winlink, participants can provide accurate, timely, situational awareness--or “ground truth”--in the early stages of any casualty event. Thus, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Regional Emergency Communications Coordination Working Groups (FEMA RECCWG), and stakeholders collaborated with the Winlink team to provide both agency and volunteer radio operators an opportunity to participate and train on the procedures of information reporting and delivery with the option of not having to depend on conventional communications. The After Action Report has been released. It provides objectives, results, and lessons learned for the benefit of the exercise stakeholders.\n\nDownload the document from the link below.\n\nVARA Products, including VARA HF, VARA FM, VARA Chat, VARA Sat, and VARA Terminal, are now hosted on the Winlink Servers for distribution.
