        "text": "The use of similar call signs by aircraft operating in the same area on the same radio frequency is referred to as 'call sign similarity'. The danger of a pilot taking and acting on a clearance intended for another aircraft due to this phenomenon is a common occurrence and can lead to flight safety incidents.\n\nThe purpose of the call sign similarity service is to help aircraft operators (AOs) to de-conflict similar call signs embedded in their schedules. This helps to reduce the incidence of call sign confusion events and improves the safety of the Network.\n\nSingle aircraft operator similarity rules\n\nSingle aircraft operator (AO) similarity rules are a set of rules for detecting similarities between two (or more) call signs within a single aircraft operator's schedule. These rules are applicable to all flights in all airspaces.\n\nLocal similarity rules\n\nIn some cases, the air navigation service providers (ANSPs) might put specific constraints on the composition of call signs.\n\nFor example, the ANSP might not be able to accept mixed alphanumeric call signs or might wish to avoid confusion with other data included within a radar label. These rules are applicable to a specific airspace and is therefore referred to as a ‘local’ rule. Depending on the specific circumstances, these rules are differ in terms of their importance.\n\nSingle call sign similarity rules\n\nA similarity event does not have to involve two call signs. A call sign can be similar to different entities commonly broadcast within an ATC clearance (e.g. runway designator, a flight level or VHF frequency). While these similarity events can certainly cause confusion, they are generally considered less severe as they will not normally cause one aircraft to take the clearance intended for another. Because there is usually only one aircraft involved, recovery is easier. They are also more predictable for the pilot and/or controller as the entities concerned are always present. Depending upon the detail, single call sign similarity rules are either applicable to all flights or to a specific airspace."
