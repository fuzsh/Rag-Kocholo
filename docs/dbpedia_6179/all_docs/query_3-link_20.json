        "text": "What is the COMPASSION Call Sign?\n\nThe COMPASSION call sign and it’s three-letter designator CMF is intended to clearly identify routine ambulatory patient transport and other public service missions conducted by volunteers.The COMPASSION call sign was assigned to the Air Care Alliance as an organization that promotes public benefit flying in 1999.\n\nWhat are the requirements for pilots to use a call sign?\n\nPilots should be active members of authorized VPOs and should be eligible to serve as PIC on\n\nflights coordinated by their organization.\n\nAdditionally, in order to use any call sign that is not the aircraft registration number, the pilot’s\n\naircraft must be equipped with an ADS-B Out unit that is programmable by the pilot.\n\nMost 1090ES ADS-B Out transponders and some 978 UAT ADS-B transceivers allow pilots to\n\nedit the call sign. Sometimes that capability must be enabled or unlocked by an avionics shop. If\n\nthe ADS-B out unit is not programmable by the pilot, he/she will not be able to use a call sign.\n\nI don't think my ADS-B can be programmed. Does that mean I can't use the call sign?\n\nIf your aircraft is not equipped with a pilot-programmable ADS-B out unit, unfortunately, you will not be able to use a call sign other than your aircraft's registration (tail) number.\n\nMost ADS-B transponders can be programmed. But many have a default setting that does not enable the programming function to work. In that case the unit can have the default changed by any avionics shop to permit the pilot to program the unit with the assigned CMF call sign.\n\nChanging the setting is a fairly easy process and in most cases the unit can even remain in the plane.\n\nThis article from AOPA lists some of the more common ADS-B units and how to change the flight ID.\n\nPilots should consult their manuals or inquire with their avionics shop about their specific transponders.\n\nWhy use COMPASSION?\n\nThe COMPASSION call sign is intended to clearly identify routine ambulatory patient transport and other public service missions conducted by volunteers including: animal transport, environmental flights, disaster response and other non-profit flying that serves the public interest.\n\nUsing the COMPASSION call sign has many benefits for the pilot, the organizations they fly for, as well as ATC.\n\n● Allows pilots to clearly identify to ATC as a bona fide public benefit flight\n\n● Gives pilots access to special handling by ATC (better routing, altitude changes, etc.)\n\n● Provides a measure of safety and security for passengers who may have special\n\nneeds due to medical reasons.\n\n● Encourages pilots to file a flight plan or use flight following on charitable flights which\n\nallows for better tracking and more efficient mission coordination.\n\n● Can provide authorization for flight operations during disaster response flights.\n\n● Increases the value and awareness of public benefit flying within the aviation\n\ncommunity!\n\nHow do pilots register for a call sign?\n\nPilots may register for their COMPASSION call sign by completing a simple form at this link:\n\nhttps://www.aircarealliance.org/register/pilot-membership/\n\nOnce a pilot’s member status with their VPO(s) is validated, a call sign will be issued by email.\n\nWill pilots be assigned a different call sign for each organization they fly for?\n\nNo. Pilots will only be assigned one COMPASSION call sign which can be used with any ACA Authorized group.\n\nWhich groups are authorized to use COMPASSION?\n\nThe current list of authorized groups is:\n\nAerobridge\n\nAngel Flight East\n\nAngel Flight Soars\n\nThe California DART Network (CalDART)\n\nElevated Access\n\nEVAC\n\nFlight for Life\n\nLifeLine Pilots\n\nOperation AirDrop\n\nPilots for Patients\n\nPilots for Christ – WY\n\nPilots N Paws\n\nSouthWings\n\nTurtles Fly Too\n\nVital Flight\n\nVPG Air\n\nYou may use your call sign on flights for any of these groups.\n\nACA welcomes any legitimate non-profit volunteer pilot group to become authorized to use the COMPASSION call sign. Groups can become authorized with ACA at any time. We expect this list to grow as more groups become authorized.\n\nHow soon can I expect my call sign to be issued after I register?\n\nYour membership with the organization(s) you listed needs to be verified before a call sign can be issued. Verification time will vary depending on the group you fly for. It may happen automatically for some organizations, but could take several business days for others. Once your membership is validated, you should receive an email containing your assigned CMF number and instructions for use.\n\nHow do I use the COMPASSION call sign?\n\nProcedures for use of the COMPASSION call sign may be found here. Please read and follow these instructions carefully.\n\nWhat kind of flights can COMPASSION be used on?\n\nCOMPASSION and its associated three-letter identifier CMF are to be used to identify aircraft conducting bona fide nonprofit public benefit flying missions. This may include:\n\ntransporting individuals for health care, diagnostics, or treatment;\n\ntransporting blood, tissues, organs, or medical supplies;\n\ntransporting emergency personnel, equipment, and supplies in time of emergency or public need;\n\nperforming habitat or environmental survey or other missions in support of environmental objectives;\n\ntransporting rescue animals or wild animals needing relocation;\n\nand in general conducting non-profit flying operations serving the public interest, especially those conducted by volunteers.\n\nCOMPASSION must not be used for routine personal, business, or commercial flights. COMPASSION must not be used for positioning or ferry flights when during the times of flight an actual public benefit flying mission is not being conducted; EXCEPT that it may be used when there is a demonstrable need for appropriate (but not priority) handling by ATC.\n\nDo I need to change the ADS-B every time I fly?\n\nWhatever Flight ID (call sign) is used in your flight plan must exactly match what's transmitted by the ADS-B.\n\nFor example: If you put CMF2000 as the Flight ID on the flight plan, CMF2000 must be transmitted by the ADS-B. Alternatively, N1234 on the flight plan means N1234 transmitted by the ADS-B.\n\nACA recommends adding “ensure proper flight ID” to your before takeoff checklist.\n\nCan the COMPASSION call sign be used outside the United States?\n\nNo. Per FAA requirements, the Air Care Alliance’s three-letter ICAO designator CMF must not be used for call signs by third party flights outside of airspace controlled by the United States except for certain CMF flights that operate in other countries that have a use agreement with the Air Care Alliance and/or the FAA.\n\nCan foreign registered aircraft use the COMPASSION call sign?\n\nNo. Per FAA requirements, Air Care Alliance’s three-letter ICAO designator CMF must not be used for flights within the United States of third party foreign registered aircraft.\n\nI registered for a call sign but still haven't received it. What do I do?\n\nYour membership with the organization you listed needs to be verified before a call sign can be issued. This may happen automatically, or make take several business days depending on the group you fly for. Once your membership is validated, you should receive an email containing your assigned CMF number and instructions for use.\n\nIf you still have not received your call sign after about a week, contact your group and ask them to verify you.\n\nIf your group has verified your membership and you still haven’t received a call sign, please contact us at info@aircarealliance.org."
