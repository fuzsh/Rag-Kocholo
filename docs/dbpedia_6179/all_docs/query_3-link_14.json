        "text": "Crashes Into Pretty Huge Emergency Room (Girls).\n\nDude was towards the end of his service on the PC-21 and about to transition on the F/A-18. On one of his last flights he and the instructor overshot the runway laterally due to heavy raining, landing gear broke, the FI pulled the rear handle and ejected both of them.\n\nGets to the emergency room at the hospital to be checked on, they tell us we can visit him later. Whole training squadron wanted to check on him, not even one hour after being delivered to the medics we get the text message “I’m all fine” and two one time-watching videos on WhatsApp in which he was having sexual relations with two different (chubby) nurses.\n\nHence, his callsign from that day on. We had to invent a backup story to tell to the air force commander on graduation day when he asked about our callsigns.\n\nThere are many acronyms out there as well. On my second deployment, one of our pilots got stranded overnight in Sigonella due to an aircraft malfunction. After the aircraft was repaired, he was supposed to rejoin the carrier the next day, only a few hours before we were scheduled to transit the Suez Canal.\n\nHis overhead time comes and goes, no aircraft. We check with Sigonella - he had departed on time. We check with Red Crown and Strike - he had not checked in. We start thinking about SAR, while the carrier delays going through the Suez Canal (this is a really, really big deal).\n\nWe finally get a call from the pilot, who says he could not find the carrier and diverted to Souda Bay with hours of fuel remaining in his tanks. He went to the old coordinates from the previous day instead of the updated ones for the next day. It shouldn’t have mattered, because he knew we were going through the ditch in a couple of hours - it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what corner of the Mediterranean we were in, which would have put him close enough to pick up the ships TACAN radio beacon.\n\nWe ended up going through the Suez that night after much disturbance to local commercial shipping. We had to somehow work an Egyptian overflight clearance overnight (this is normally a 1 month+ process) so the pilot could fly over and meet us in the Red Sea the next day. The whole event was really embarrassing to our Squadron, and we cringed at what the next Foc’sle Follies roll call would bring our way.\n\nHis new call sign: LIMPDIC (Lost In Med, Please Don’t Inform CAG)."
