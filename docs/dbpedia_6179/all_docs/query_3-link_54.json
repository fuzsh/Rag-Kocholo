Our fill rate has been higher than other area districts and we have found the staff at TOC to be very responsive to our needs. We appreciate the work they do to continue to recruit substitutes and to customize our needs for each of our buildings.\n\nWe are so happy with the commitment that Teachers On Call has to its staff, its clients and to the education field as a whole. Not only are we impressed with the well-trained, professional staff that they send, we have also had the opportunity of hiring several of their substitutes.\n\nThe training and implementation made the transition to TOC seamless. All the staff at TOC have been extremely helpful and have never made me feel like my questions were not important. Our fill rate is great and it's awesome to launch a new program and receive this kind of support."
