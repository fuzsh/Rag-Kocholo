        "text": "July 1990 - Sitting in weaponeering class, which was part of learning to fly the A-6 Intruder.\n\nOne of my classmates turned to me and said “I heard you have a poodle”, in the same tone you would use if you caught someone in the middle of some deviant act.\n\nI replied “so what?”.\n\nHe (a marine) was outraged. “It must be your wife’s dog, right?” Not being smart enough to see the dignified exit, I vigorously defended our little dog. Big mistake. He turned to the rest of the class and announced “Patrick has a fucking little Fifi poodle, and likes him!”\n\nI’m now almost 60 years old, and my close Navy friends still call me Fifi."
