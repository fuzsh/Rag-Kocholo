        "text": "CAL FIRE’s world-renowned aviation program responds to thousands of wildlands fires throughout California each year. CAL FIRE’s current aviation fleet includes Grumman S-2T airtanker, Bell UH-1H Super Huey Helicopters, Sikorsky S-70i Helicopters, and North American OV-10A (& 1 D Model) Bronco Air Tactical Aircraft. These aircraft, highly skilled pilots, and aviation support staff are strategically located throughout California at our 14 air tanker bases, 10 CAL FIRE helitack bases and one CAL FIRE/San Diego County Sheriff helitack base. Aircraft can reach the most remote State Responsibility Area (SRA) fires in approximately 20 minutes, with the goal of keeping 95% of fires at 10 acres or less. CAL FIRE’s fleet of more than 60 fixed and rotary wing aircraft make it the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world."
