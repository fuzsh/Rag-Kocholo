Eastern time Fridays.\n\nARRL Headquarters and W1AW are closed on New Year's Day; Presidents' Day; Good Friday, Memorial Day; Independence Day; Labor Day; Thanksgiving and the following Friday; and Christmas Day. In a communications emergency, monitor W1AW for special bulletins as follows: voice on the hour, digital at 15 minutes past the hour and CW on the half hour.\n\nW1AW is open to visitors from 8 AM to 5 PM Eastern time, Monday through Friday, except holidays. Amateur Radio operators may operate the station from 10 AM to 3:45 PM Monday through Friday.\n\nBe sure to bring your current Amateur Radio license or a photocopy.\n\nARRL Headquarters and W1AW are closed on New Year's Day; Presidents' Day; Memorial Day; Independence Day; Labor Day; Veterans Day (when it falls on a weekday); Thanksgiving and the following Friday; and Christmas Day.\n\nLearn More\n\nAmateurs who work us and would like a W1AW QSL card should send their QSL card to us and please include a SASE (Self-Addressed-Stamped-Envelope). International stations may QSL directly to W1AW with one IRC or via the bureau.\n\nW1AW Address:\n\n225 Main Street\n\nNewington, CT 06111\n\nUSA\n\nQSL cards are no longer processed for any of the 2014 W1AW/xx portable operations. However, LoTW discrepancies are still investigated.\n\nAll W1AW QSOs are uploaded to Logbook of the World weekly.\n\nW1AW is now QRV on 50350 kHz for all its regular CW code practice, and CW, digital, and phone bulletin transmissions.\n\nIn addition to providing regularly scheduled transmissions on 6 meters, another goal is to act as a beacon on 6 meters, especially from the Northeast US.\n\nSignal reports are welcome via an online page at, http://www.arrl.org/w1aw_6m_srp . Reports may also be emailed to W1AW at, w1aw@arrl.org.\n\nBeginning on Friday, September 6, 2024, Maxim Memorial Station\n\nW1AW will begin using a new 17 meter frequency for its scheduled CW\n\ntransmissions due to increased activity near the current bulletin\n\nfrequency. In order to reduce the possibility of interference, W1AW\n\nwill move to 18077.5 kHz."
