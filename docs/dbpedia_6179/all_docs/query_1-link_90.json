The ARG/US Platinum rating is awarded only to those operators who, after completion of an intense operations, maintenance, and safety systems audit by accredited industry experts, have demonstrated that their procedures meet or exceed industry “best practices” in all phases. The Wyvern Standard far surpasses the industry standard for air charter safety. Operators that pass the on-site Wyvern audit also agree to post-auditing, which requires them to provide up to date information regarding aircraft and crew. WYVERN’s database verifies this information daily, which ensures the validation of the audit throughout the term of the recommendation. IS-BAO certification is recognized as the international standard for aircraft operations and safety. In addition to industry auditing firms, Solairus has been audited and approved by several objective third-party commercial operators and Fortune 500 flight departments."
