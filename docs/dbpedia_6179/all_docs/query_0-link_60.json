It is a two-way tactical real-time digital communications system between all assets in a network sharing information about everything going on in the local area. On ham radio, this means if something is happening now, or there is information that could be valuable to you, then it should show up on your APRS radio in your mobile. See typical oversights and hear my talk on the 3 Oct 08 Rain Report See also some original APRSdos views and concepts overlooked in some new programs.\n\nAPRS also supports global callsign-to-callsign messaging, bulletins, objects email and Voice because every local area is seen by the Internet System (APRS-IS)! APRS should enable local and global amateur radio operator contact at anytime-anywhere and using any device. See the APRS Messaging/Contact Initiative. .\n\nAPRS Internet System (APRS-IS): Like most other Ham radio systems, APRS has been fully integrated with the internet beginning with the efforts of Steve Dimse and the Sproul Brothers in 1997. Currently there are many web pages for live viewing of APRS activity such as APRS.FI, or FINDU.COM. For example, the map at right from Hessu, OH7LZB's web site http://aprs.fi/ shows a one month snapshot of activity which reveals some gaps in the APRS coverage in the USA.\n\nAPRS SPEC! . APRS continuously evolves. There have been several initiatives that have drastically improved APRS network performance and useability for users. The original APRS spec was updated in 2004 with the APRS1.1 addendum and since then with the APRS1.2 updates. Most of these new initiatives are listed here.\n\nMileMark database for position of non-APRS stations. Description, and Basic code, and mm-data.dat file.\n\nOVERVIEW: The Automatic Packet Reporting System was designed to support rapid, reliable exchange of information for local, tactical real-time information, events or nets. The concept, which dates back to the mid 1980's, is that all relevant information is transmitted immediately to everyone in the net and every station captures that information for consistent and standard display to all participants. Information was refreshed redundantly but at a decaying rate so that old information was updated less frequently than new info. Since the primary objective is consistent exchange of information between everyone, APRS established standard formats not only for the transmission of POSITION, STATUS, MESSAGES, and QUERIES, it also establishes guidelines for display so that users of different systems will still see the same consistent information displayed in a consistent manner (independent of the particular display or maping system in use). See the original APRS.TXT. The two images below should give you an idea of the kinds of information available to the mobile operator on his APRS radio. On the left is the Kenwood D710 radio showing the station list, and on the right is the attached GPS with map display showing the location of other APRS stations.\n\nEach station or object in the list has three more pages of information on it. The objects can show Repeater frequenceis in an area, meetings, nets, events, hamfests, echolink and IRLP nodes and frequencies, traffic speeds, accidents, emergency situations. And the attached GPS can show the location of each of these items.\n\nTHE GOAL IS COMMUNICATIONS and LOCAL INFO UPDATE, -NOT- JUST VEHICLE TRACKING!\n\nAPRS was never intended to be just a vehicle tracking system (GPS was added in the 1992 time frame when GPS became affordable). APRS is much more. See the Kenwood mobile display above. This is the STATION LIST which shows the nearest 100 stations heard. . In this case, not only are the two stations of AB9FX nearby, but also his current VOICE operating frequency is visible. Also, we can see that this radio is in OPERATING range of three voice repeaters that are also identifying themselves as objects on APRS as the locally recommended voice operating channels.\n\nAPRS provides situational awareness to all operators of everything that is going on in his local area, whether it be Weather reporting, traveler info, Direction Finding, objects pointing to ECHOlink and IRLP, or Traffic reporting and emergency response. All of this while providing not only instantaneous operator-to-operator keyboard messaging capability for special events, but also an always-on Voice Alert backchannel between mobiles in simplex range. There is even an APRS interface to the WinLINK system called APRSlink, so that mobiles can send and receive Email without needing a PC. Think of APRS as a signalling channel to reveal ALL amateur radio resources and live activities that are in range of the operator at any instant in time.\n\nUBIQUITOUS OPERATIONS: APRS must work everywhere to be a true resource to the mobile ham radio operator. In North America, 144.39 MHz is dedicated throughout the continent. In Europe, use 144.80 and in Australia use 145.175 MHz.. National operating rules were standardized in the 2004 time frame under the New-N Paradigm to eliminate obsolete and inefficient routing. Now, only a 2 hop WIDE2-2 path is recommended in all areasthough mobiles can use the special WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1 two-hop path that takes advantage of nearby WIDE1-1 fill-in digipeaters. See the high density areas in the map to the right. Further, the APRS channel is a resource to inform everyone of nearby ham resources in range. Please see the Local Info Initiative.\n\nSee USA map of Mobiles\n\nSee map of digis\n\nAPRS GLOBAL INTERNET SYSTEM: Although APRS is a local, tactical real-time two-way communications system, all local information is injected into the APRS-IS Internet system so it can be monitored anywhere. Here is the live IGate list of over 1500 IGates that give connectivity throughout the world. Not only does this allow for global monitoring of local activity, it also allows the two-way point-to-point messaging between any two APRS users anywhere on the planet (that has an APRS infrastructure). Everything goes in so it is available to everyone on the internet, but only messages and selected position data goes back out to RF to keep the channel local and lightly loaded.\n\nUNIVERSAL TEXT MESSAGING FOR AMATEUR RADIO: . Not only can APRS users text-message each other live, but they can also text-message with many other cross-platform media. There is an initiative to cross connect ALL consumer type hand-held wireless devices to the APRS system so that\n\nEnthusiasts and casual viewers alike rely on Soap2day for their entertainment needs.\n\nany two radio amateurs can text-message callsign-to-callsign completely independent of the type of device. They can use cell phones, blackberrys, pagers, DTMF HT's or just about any other kind of device. See the web page: Universal Text Messaging Initiative\n\nAPRS was developed by Bob Bruninga, WB4APR, as a real-time local tactical communications system for rapidly exchanging digital data of immediate value to operations. This really took off when GPS became available and MAPS were integrated into the system for tactical situational awareness of everything in the net. In the 18 years since its introduction, (see history) it has grown to encompass just about every aspect of Amateur Radio.

Now it is world wide linked initially by K4HG's global FINDU.COM shown on the right. More recently, Hessu's APRS.FI has become popular, as well as OpenAPRS.NET. The map above shows the approximate 20,000 users now on the air in the USA at any instant.\n\nThe remainder of this page is just a list of links to just about everything involving APRS in the last 10 years.
