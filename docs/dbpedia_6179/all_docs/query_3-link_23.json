        "text": "Radios That You Need\n\nBefore you purchase anything else, make sure you have a VHF marine radio. A VHF marine radio is the single most important radio system you should buy. It is probably also the most inexpensive. If you plan to travel more than a few miles offshore, plan to purchase an MF/HF radiotelephone or mobile satellite telephone, an emergency position indicating radio beacon, or EPIRB, and a second VHF radio or cellular telephone as well. Mobile satellite telephones are becoming more common and more inexpensive. The mobile satellite will provide easier and clearer communications than the MF/HF radiotelephone, but the HF radiotelephone will receive high seas marine weather warnings.\n\nRadio Watchkeeping Regulations\n\nIf you have a VHF-FM radio, there are certain regulations in place for monitoring/listening to your radio. Please read our radio watchkeeping section for more information.\n\nMayday! Mayday! Mayday!...Sending a distress call\n\nYou may only have seconds to send a distress call. Here's what you should do:\n\nProcedure for Digital Selective Calling (DSC) Radio: DSC MAYDAY\n\nProcedure for VHF Channel 16 MAYDAY:\n\nIf you have a VHF marine radio, tune it to channel 16. Unless you know you are outside VHF range of shore and ships, call on channel 16 first.\n\nDistress signal \"MAYDAY\", spoken three times.\n\nThe words \"THIS IS\", spoken once.\n\nName of vessel in distress (spoken three times) and call sign or boat registration number, spoken once.\n\nRepeat \"MAYDAY\" and name of vessel, spoken once.\n\nGive position of vessel by latitude or longitude or by bearing (true or magnetic, state which) and distance to a well-known landmark such as a navigational aid or small island, or in any terms which will assist a responding station in locating the vessel in distress. Include any information on vessel movement such as course, speed and destination.\n\nNature of distress (sinking, fire etc.).\n\nKind of assistance desired.\n\nNumber of persons onboard.\n\nAny other information which might facilitate rescue, such as length or tonnage of vessel, number of persons needing medical attention, color hull, cabin, masks, etc.\n\nThe word \"OVER\"\n\nStay by the radio if possible. Even after the message has been received, the Coast Guard can find you more quickly if you can transmit a signal on which a rescue boat or aircraft can home.\n\nFor example:\n\nMAYDAY-MAYDAY-MAYDAY\n\nTHIS IS BLUE DUCK-BLUE DUCK-BLUE DUCK WA1234 MAYDAY THIS IS BLUE DUCK\n\nCAPE HENRY LIGHT BEARS 185 DEGREES MAGNETIC-DISTANCE 2 MILES\n\nSTRUCK SUBMERGED OBJECT\n\nNEED PUMPS-MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND TOW\n\nTHREE ADULTS, TWO CHILDREN ONBOARD\n\nONE PERSON COMPOUND FRACTURE OF ARM\n\nESTIMATE CAN REMAIN AFLOAT TWO HOURS\n\nBLUE DUCK IS THIRTY TWO FOOT CABIN CRUISER-WHITE HULL-BLUE DECK HOUSE\n\nOVER\n\nRepeat at intervals until an answer is received.\n\nIf you hear a distress call...\n\nIf you hear a distress message from a vessel and it is not answered, then you must answer. If you are reasonably sure that the distressed vessel is not in your vicinity, you should wait a short time for others to acknowledge.\n\nMF/HF Radiotelephone\n\nYour VHF radio is intended mainly for short range communications, generally 5-10 miles, and at least 20 miles to a USCG station. To communicate at longer ranges, you will normally need a satellite telephone or an MF/HF marine radiotelephone. Marine radiotelephone equipment normally operates between 2 - 26 MHz using single sideband emissions. MF/HF marine radiotelephones can also be used to receive high seas weather broadcasts, and by using a computer and a special interface provided by some coast stations, can provide Internet email.\n\nWhat to do if no one responds to your distress call\n\nTune your HF radiotelephone to an HF channel guarded by the Coast Guard, and repeat your mayday call. Activate your EPIRB.\n\nFrequencies You May Use\n\nSee the High Frequency Radiotelephone Channels webpage. HF radiotelephone channels are normally limited to operational, business, safety or public correspondence purposes.\n\nBoater Calling Channel (VHF Channel 9)\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission established VHF-FM channel 9 as a supplementary calling channel for noncommercial vessels (recreational boaters) at the request of the Coast Guard. A ship or shore unit wishing to call a boater would do so on channel 9, and anyone (boaters included) wishing to call a commercial ship or shore activity would continue to do so on channel 16. Recreational boaters would continue to call the Coast Guard and any commercial facility on channel 16.\n\nThe purpose of the FCC regulation was to relieve congestion on VHF channel 16, the distress, safety and calling frequency. FCC regulations require boaters having VHF radios to maintain a watch on either VHF channel 9 or channel 16, whenever the radio is turned on and not communicating with another station.\n\nSince the Coast Guard generally does not have the capability of announcing an urgent marine information broadcast or weather warning on channel 9, use of channel 9 is optional. We recommend boaters normally keep tuned to and use channel 16 in those waters unless otherwise notified by the Coast Guard.\n\nProcedure for Calling A Ship by Radio\n\nYou may use channel 16 to call a ship or shore station, but if you do so, you must, must be brief! We recommend this same procedure be used over channel 9, if channel 9 is used as a calling channel.\n\nFor example:\n\nBlue Duck: \"Mary Jane, this is Blue Duck\" (the name of the vessel or MMSI being called may be said 2 or 3 times if conditions warrant)\n\nMary Jane: \"Blue Duck, this is Mary Jane. Reply 68\" (or some other proper working channel).\n\nBlue Duck: \"68\" or \"Roger\"\n\nGlobal Maritime Distress & Safety System\n\nVHF maritime channel 70 (156.525 MHz) is authorized exclusively for distress, safety and calling purposes using digital selective calling (DSC) techniques. No other uses are permitted.\n\nChannel 70 is used to send distress alerts, safety announcements and for calling purposes under the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). Many vessels are now equipped with DSC capability and are using channel 70 for this purpose. It is essential that this channel be protected.\n\nStorm Warnings?\n\nThe Coast Guard announces storm warnings and other urgent marine information broadcasts on VHF channel 16 before making the broadcasts on VHF channel 22A and 2670 kHz respectively. Storm warnings and forecasts are also made by NOAA Weather Radio.\n\nMAYDAY Radio Checks and other Hoaxes\n\nA growing number of boaters unsuccessful in getting a radio check on VHF channel 16 are calling MAYDAY to get a response. Every hoax, including MAYDAY radio checks, is subject to prosecution as a Class D felony under Title 14, Section 85 of the U.S. Code, liable for a $5000 fine plus all costs the Coast Guard incurs as a result of the individual's action. Since hoaxes can lead to loss of life, the Coast Guard and Federal Communications Commission will work closely together, using when necessary FCC equipment capable of identifying the electronic signature of the offending radio. We ask your cooperation in helping us and the FCC remove hoaxes from the VHF radiotelephone distress, safety and calling channel 16.\n\nRadio Checks\n\nRadio checks with the Coast Guard Communications Stations on DSC and HF radiotelephone are allowed.\n\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) Radio License Information\n\nAn FCC ship station radio license is no longer required for any vessel travelling in U.S. waters which uses a VHF marine radio, radar or EPIRB, and which is not required to carry radio equipment. A license is necessary however for any vessel required to carry a marine radio, on an international voyage, or carrying an HF single sideband radiotelephone or marine satellite terminal. FCC license forms, including applications for ship and land station radio licenses, can now be downloaded from the FCC website.\n\nSatellite Communications\n\nCurrently, the Inmarsat Organization, an international organization established by treaty, is the sole provider of worldwide maritime mobile satellite communications offering emergency calling capability. Coverage is available between about 70 deg N latitude and 70 deg S latitude. Other mobile satellite systems are also becoming available, but these systems in general do not offer an emergency calling capability.\n\nFor More Information...\n\nCellular phones\n\nCoast Guard high seas radio distress watchkeeping schedules\n\nCoast Guard Telecommunications\n\nCoast Guard VHF Coverage in Your Area\n\nMaritime Safety Broadcast Information\n\nNational Weather Service Marine Product Information Dissemination (this link leads outside the USCG)\n\nRules which require listening to your VHF marine radio\n\nVHF Marine Radio Channels and Frequencies\n\nFor general boating safety information questions..."
