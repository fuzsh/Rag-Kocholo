        "text": "Who you talking to?\n\nHave you ever been on frequency with air traffic control (ATC) and heard an airlinerâs call sign and wondered just which airline it is? I sure have! Premier Flight Center, where I work, is a busy flight school based out of Hartford-Brainard Airport (KHFD) in Hartford, Connecticut, and weâve got Bradley International Airport (KBDL) just north of us. We regularly receive VFR flight following, and we also do a lot of IFR training, so we are on Bradley's frequency quite often. Beyond that, from our corner of Connecticut, itâs not too tough to end up in the airspace owned by Boston or New York. Accordingly, I hear an assortment of call signs. Oh yes, and Iâm a LiveATC.net fan as wellâ¦\n\nContinental Airlines (pictured above) is pretty straight forward. They're called âContinentalâ... I figured out âCactusâ is the call sign for US Airways, but that only came to me through the media coverage of the comms between ATC and the highly skilled pilots of âCactus 1549â, the flight that landed in the Hudson River in January 2009. I think âBrickyardâ is another awesome call sign, but I never could figure out which airline they are.\n\nWho knew?\n\nIt was a dark and rainy night... I was bored and at home so I began rummaging about the FAAâs web site (yes, Iâve been told I âreally need to get a lifeâ). Regardless, I found out that the FAA has a master document of all the airlines who have approved call signs â I also learned that the proper name for a âcall signâ is a âtelephony designatorâ. Iâm sure this isnât news to all of the ATC folk out there, but to a lowly CFI, I thought it quite a find.\n\nThe document is Order JO 7340.2H â âContractionsâ. Chapter 3 has a comprehensive:\n\nAlphabetical list of airlines and their telephony\n\nAlphabetical list of the telephony and the associated airline â and\n\nAlphabetical list of the 3-letter designator associated with the telephony\n\nSo, now I now know that âBrickyardâ is Republic Airlines from Indianapolis, Indiana! All of you NASCAR fans will immediately see the significance!\n\nOk then, how do I get a call sign?\n\nReceipt of a call sign (ah yes, a âtelephony designatorâ) isnât simply a matter of filling out a form. Turns out you have to have a âneedâ. And not surprisingly, JO 7340.2 specifies the requirements that must be met to request a 3-letter identifier and/or call sign â Feel free to check out Chapter 1, Section 4 if you're particularly curious.\n\nPilots who have flown around Connecticut and talked to Bradley Approach or Brainard Tower might have noticed that itâs common to hear pilots and controllers use the call sign âLifestar 1â or âLifestar 2â on the radio.\n\nâLifestar 1â and âLifestar 2â are the emergency air ambulance helicopters that operate in central and southeastern Connecticut. Yet, if you look, youâll see that they donât appear in the lists in JO 7340.2.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nWell, it seems that operators can petition for âlocal telephony designatorsâ. In their case, by having a local designator, the Lifestar pilots are quickly recognized by ATC as an emergency operation and they get the deferential treatment they and their patients deserve. However, the âLifestarâ pilots can only use their call sign with ATC facilities that know about them. This awareness is fostered through a letter of agreement between the hospitals that operate them and the ATC facilities theyâll have regular contact with during their day to day activities. Oh, one further point: Local designators arenât for IFR useâ¦\n\nâLocal telephony designators will be used only for communications with local airport traffic control towers/facilities for VFR/SVFR operations. A Letter of Agreement (LOA) is required between the local tower/facility and the requesting company/applicant. The LOA will contain verbiage which ensures the local telephony is used only with facilities which are signatories to the agreement.â JO 7340.2B 1-5-2(a)\n\nI guess that means no telephony designator for me?\n\nNope, probably not, which means that my dreams for playing a wonderfully devious practical joke probably are dashed too. Here was my idea:\n\nFor a while, I worked for what I concluded was a less than reputable flight school. Iâd come to this realization for numerous reasons, but most especially because Iâd grown quite suspicious about their maintenance practices for the airplanes. During my short tenure there, Iâd joke that I wanted to petition â on their behalf â for the call sign âDeath Trapâ for the fleet. At the very least, it would have gotten attention on the radio, and it probably would have sent people scurrying to see if there was a list of call signs to see who we were!"
