        "text": "We've put together a glossary of terms which you may encounter either on our site or in aviation in general that we hope enriches your flight tracking experience. The Aviation industry uses many complex acronyms, jargon and terminology which this glossary will help you unravel. The vocabulary we look at centers around flight tracking, characteristics of flight, flight tracking technology/communication and general aviation terminology.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nU\n\nV\n\nW\n\nX\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nAircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS)\n\nACARS stands for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System. It is a digital communication system used in aviation to exchange information between aircraft and ground stations. ACARS facilitates the transmission of messages related to various aspects of flight operations, including aircraft performance, maintenance, and air traffic control communications.\n\nAeronautical Information Publication (AIP)\n\nA document that provides comprehensive and updated information crucial for the safe operation of aircraft within a specific country's airspace.\n\nAutomatic Direction Finder (ADF)\n\nAn Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) is an aviation instrument that provides pilots with non-visual navigation assistance. Operating on the medium-frequency band, the ADF detects and displays the direction of an AM radio station's signal, allowing pilots to determine their bearing relative to the station.\n\nADS-B\n\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast is the main technology we use to track aircraft. Automatic: data is sent from the aircraft without pilot intervention; Dependent: it is dependent on the aircraft's navigation system for position information. An aircraft that has a transponder that is ADS-B equipped enables extensive flight details to be sent such as altitude, ground speed, call sign to be transmitted. In some cases additional information, like airspeed, wind, and temperature are sent as well. With our global network of ADS-B receivers we are able to use these transmissions to provide a unique flight tracking service.\n\nYou can read more about ADS-B here.\n\nAbove Ground Level (AGL)\n\nAbove Ground Level (AGL) is an aviation term used to denote altitude or height measurements relative to the Earth's surface. When an aircraft's altitude is expressed in AGL, it signifies the distance between the aircraft and the ground directly below, excluding any elevated terrain or structures.\n\nAileron\n\nAn aircraft aileron is a movable surface located on the trailing edge of an airplane wing, which controls the roll of the aircraft around its longitudinal axis. The ailerons are designed to work in pairs, with one aileron moving upward while the other moves downward, to create a difference in lift between the two wings and cause the aircraft to roll.\n\nAircraft age\n\nThe aircraft's age listed on Flightradar24 is from the first flight. Delivery of the aircraft to the operator usually occurs within weeks of the first flight. The age of commercial airliners varies greatly, and largely depends on the number of pressurisation cycles. A Boeing 747-400 for example was designed to have a 20 year lifespan. Read more about aircraft age here.\n\nAircraft livery\n\nAn aircraft livery is the paint scheme which is applied. Airlines often create special liveries in support of events, anniversaries, or advertising campaigns. A recent example of this is the Qantas 100th anniversary livery applied to 787-9 VH-ZNJ.\n\nAircraft type\n\nEach kind of aircraft is assigned an aircraft type, which is a standardized name for the aircraft. Type codes are assigned by ICAO and consist of two to four letters and numbers. These type codes are often used when filing flight plans. We use these type codes on Flightradar24 for filtering aircraft.\n\nAirway\n\nAirways are predefined routes which connect set locations through the use of navaids and waypoints.\n\nAircraft lessor\n\nAn aircraft lessor is a company that purchases commercial aircraft and leases them to airlines and other operators. The lessor typically owns a portfolio of aircraft and leases them to customers under long-term operating leases or finance leases. Find out more about aircraft leasing here >>\n\nAltitude\n\nFor each flight on Flightradar24 the pressure-derived barometric altitude is reported by the aircraft. Extended Mode S Data received from some aircraft also includes the GPS-derived altitude of the aircraft.\n\nAir traffic control (ATC)\n\nAir traffic controllers are responsible for the safe coordination of flights from pushback to arrival. They are a ground based service whose primary objective is to safely facilitate the movement of air traffic, prevent aircraft collisions, as well as providing any other information a pilot may require. Find out more about air traffic controllers here.\n\nArea Navigation (RNAV)\n\nArea Navigation (RNAV) is a form of IFR navigation where an aircraft can fly a route between a network of radio beacons, instead of having to fly from one beacon to the next. Learn more about RNAV here.\n\nAuxiliary power unit (APU)\n\nAn aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU) is a device that provides energy in order to power electrical systems. Most APUs are simply small jet engines which take fuel directly from the aircraft's main fuel tanks. In normal operations an APU will be started prior to main engine start, shut down during flight, and then restarted after the main engines are shut down again.\n\nAutomatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS)\n\nThe Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) is a continuous, recorded broadcast, which provides information such as weather, active runway, runway state, NOTAMs and any other information that may be needed by Pilots. Typically a broadcast is coded with a reference 'Information' letter (Information Alpha) signifying the current version of an ATIS. Air traffic controllers will inform approaching aircraft of the current ATIS ('Information November is current') to ensure pilots have the information they need to carry out a safe landing.\n\nAudio Control Panel (ACP)\n\nAn aircraft’s Audio Control Panel is often found on the pedestal section of an aircraft and allows Pilots to select which audio sources they want to hear, and transmit on. Read about a recent incident involving the ACP onboard a flight.\n\nAvionics\n\nAvionics (a portmanteau of Aviation and Electronics) refers to the electronic systems used in aircraft to support its functions, including communication, navigation, control, and monitoring. Avionics systems can include components such as radios, transponders, autopilots, flight management systems, weather radar, and instrument displays. Avionics play a critical role in modern aircraft, and they are essential for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of flights. They allow pilots to navigate accurately, communicate with air traffic controllers and ground personnel, monitor the performance of the aircraft, and make necessary adjustments to ensure safe operations.\n\nBarometric altitude\n\nBarometric altitude values reflect the aircraft's altitude above Mean Sea Level, a constant value used in aviation and other applications. Barometric altitude data is reported by an aircraft’s transponder in standard pressure (1013.25 hPa | 29.92 in Hg) and is not corrected for local pressure. Nor is Barometric altitude corrected for local elevation, so altitude above Mean Sea Level does not necessarily reflect an aircraft's height above the ground.\n\nBlack boxes\n\nTaken together, the CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder) and FDR (Flight Data Recorders) are informally known as the black boxes, though in fact, most are bright orange. Both recorders are designed to survive a crash and are equipped with beacons to assist investigators in locating them quickly after an aircraft accident. Read more about black boxes here.\n\nCeiling\n\nThe aircraft ceiling is the maximum altitude at which an aircraft can maintain level flight with a specified rate of climb. This altitude is determined by various factors, including the type of aircraft, engine power, weight, temperature, and humidity. The aircraft ceiling is typically expressed in terms of feet above mean sea level (MSL) and is an important performance parameter for aircraft. The higher the aircraft's ceiling, the greater its range and endurance, and the more versatile it is for different types of missions. For commercial airliners, the aircraft ceiling is typically in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 feet MSL, while military aircraft such as fighter jets and reconnaissance planes can fly at much higher altitudes of up to 50,000 or 60,000 feet MSL.\n\nCivil Aviation Authority (CAA)\n\nFounded in 1972, the CAA regulates all aspects of civil aviation within the United Kingdom.\n\nCivil Aviation Administration of China\n\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China, is the aviation authority for the People's Republic of China and is based in Beijing, China. Read more about the CAAC here.\n\nCall sign\n\nCall signs are used by Air Traffic Control to denote a specific flight. These can differ from flight numbers in two respects. Some airline radio call signs are different from the airline's name, either for reasons of history or for easy understanding over the radio. Additionally, in recent years, flights have begun using alphanumeric call signs in order to avoid call sign confusion. For example, flight number British Airways 123 would use the call sign Speedbird 1PW, where \"Speedbird\" is the radio call sign and 1PW is the alphanumeric call sign. This helps avoid confusion over the radio, where two British Airways flights with similar numbers may be talking to the same air traffic controller.\n\nCalibrated airspeed (CAS)\n\nCalibrated airspeed is the airspeed corrected for position and instrument error and is equal to True Airspeed (TAS) at sea level. 'KCAS' is a further abbreviation of Calibrated Airspeed which denotes CAS measured in knots. In some countries the term 'reflected airspeed' is used instead of calibrated airspeed.\n\nCAT I/II/III approaches\n\nCAT I/II/III approaches refer to different categories of instrument landing systems (ILS) that allow pilots to make instrument landings in low visibility conditions. The categories are defined based on the minimum visibility and cloud ceiling requirements for the approach. Learn more about the different approach categories here.\n\nClear Air Turbulence\n\nClear Air Turbulence is a disturbance to the aircraft most commonly seen at high altitudes and in jet streams. Whilst it appears on high altitude weather forecasts, it can turn up unexpectedly, and sometimes be severe. Find out more about clear air turbulence here.\n\nClimb\n\nA climb is a period of flight where an aircraft's altitude increases. Typically a climb occurs immediately after takeoff. It's common to see commercial airliners perform an additional climb enroute, known as a 'Step climb', and this can often be clearly seen in our flight profile graphs.\n\nCockpit voice recorder (CVR)\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder records audio from the flight deck. Usually this is done by recording the sound transmitted through flight crew headsets and also by using microphones placed around the cockpit itself. CVRs help investigators understand what took place on the flight deck during an accident or incident. Find out more here about cockpit voice recorders and how they work.\n\nCodeshare flight\n\nA codeshare flight is where an agreement exists between two or more airlines who offer the same flight to customers, using their own airline designator.\n\nContrails\n\nAircraft contrails, short for condensation trails, are the visible lines of clouds that sometimes form behind airplanes in flight. Contrails are created when the hot exhaust gases from the aircraft's engines combine with the cold, moisture-laden air in the upper atmosphere. The water vapor in the engine exhaust condenses into tiny ice crystals, which then freeze into small particles, forming a visible cloud. The contrail may appear white or slightly gray, depending on the size and density of the ice particles.\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC)\n\nUTC is the time standard used in aviation. It is the same as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and is regularly used in offsets such as UTC-1 and UTC+1. Find out more about UTC here.\n\nCost index\n\nA cost index is a figure, usually between 0-100, which is entered into an aircraft's Flight Management System (FMS) as a way of meeting aircraft operational requirements. The figure that is used is derived from calculating fuel vs time-related costs. An optimized cost index finds the proper balance between the cost of fuel and the cost of time.\n\nCPDLC\n\nController Pilot Data Link Communications is a system used by air traffic controllers and pilots to exchange digital messages. It allows simple messages to be passed via data link as opposed to traditional voice communication over radio. Learn more about CPDLC here.\n\nCrosswind\n\nA crosswind is a wind that blows perpendicular to the direction of travel of an aircraft. In other words, when an aircraft is flying and the wind is blowing from the side, it is said to be experiencing a crosswind. Crosswinds can be challenging for pilots because they can affect the stability and control of the aircraft. As the wind pushes against the side of the aircraft, it can cause the aircraft to drift off course, and the pilot needs to compensate by adjusting the flight controls to maintain the desired heading and altitude.\n\nDe-icing\n\nDe-icing is the process of removing build ups of snow, ice or frost for an aircraft. This is normally done by spraying de-icing fluid, or by applying heat. Take a closer look at de-icing in our blog post here and also find out how aircraft de-ice in the air >>\n\nDelivery flight\n\nA delivery flight is when an aircraft makes its first flight from where it was manufactured, to the airport/airfield chosen by the new operator. Aircraft are usually delivered to an airline’s major hub, though some are flown to special locations for additional modifications like interior configuration or WiFi installation. Read about the delivery flight of the first Bombardier C Series CS100 (now Airbus A220).\n\nDescent\n\nA descent is a period of flight where an aircraft's altitude decreases. 'Top of descent' is the point where an aircraft will typically begin descending towards its destination. In an emergency situation such as a rapid decompression an aircraft will perform an emergency descent to below 10,000ft where the oxygen levels in the air are able to ensure passengers and crew may breath unassisted by supplemental oxygen.\n\nDisplaced Threshold\n\nA displaced threshold (DTHR) is a runway marking that indicates a point on the runway other than the beginning or end of the runway. DTHRs can be temporary or permanent, and reduce the length of runway available for landings in one direction. The area behind a DTHR can be used for takeoffs in either direction and landings from the opposite direction.\n\nDistance Measuring Equipment (DME\n\nDistance Measuring Equipment (DME) is a vital avionics device in aviation, providing accurate real-time distance information between an aircraft and a ground-based DME station. Operating on UHF frequencies, DME measures the time it takes for radio signals to travel to and from the aircraft.\n\nDrag\n\nIn aviation, drag refers to the aerodynamic force that opposes an aircraft's forward motion through the air. It is caused by the friction and resistance encountered as the aircraft moves through the atmosphere. Drag acts in the direction opposite to the aircraft's motion and is a critical factor influencing performance and fuel efficiency.\n\nEuropean Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)\n\nEstablished in 2002, EASA is a European Union agency tasked with civil aviation safety and regulation.\n\nElectronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS)\n\nThe Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) revolutionizes cockpit instrumentation, replacing traditional analog gauges with digital displays. Comprising Primary Flight Displays (PFD) and Navigation Displays (ND), EFIS integrates critical flight information on high-resolution screens. PFD presents real-time attitude, altitude, airspeed, and other essential parameters, enhancing situational awareness.\n\nEmergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)\n\nThe Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) is a crucial safety device installed in aircraft to aid in search and rescue operations in the event of an emergency. Activated automatically upon impact, the ELT emits distress signals on designated frequencies, enabling search and rescue teams to locate the aircraft's position swiftly.\n\nEqual time point (ETP)\n\nAn equal time point is a position on a route where the time taken to return to the departure point, is the same as the time required to reach the arrival point. Head or tailwinds can affect where this precise point along a route may be.\n\nEnhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS)\n\nEGPWS is the latest iteration of a system that gives pilots advanced warning of approaching terrain. Designed to prevent Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) events, the system has significantly reduced such accidents since its inception. Read more about EGPWS here >>\n\nEstimations\n\nFor flights that are no longer in our coverage area, we may estimate their position for up to 240 minutes. These flight tracks are shown as black dashed lines. Read more about estimated positions on Flightradar24.\n\nExtended Range Operations (ETOPS)\n\nETOPS is a certification that allows aircraft to operate on routes that are further away from diversion airports than would be allowed by standard regulations. Formerly known as Extended Range Twin-Engine Operations as it was first developed for twin-engine aircraft, ETOPS certification is required by regulatory authorities for airlines that wish to operate long-haul flights over water or remote areas. ETOPS certification is important for airlines because it allows them to operate more efficient and cost-effective routes. Find out more about ETOPS here >>\n\nEurocontrol\n\nEurocontrol is the The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation based in Brussels, Belgium. It is the umbrella organization of national air navigation service providers in Europe.\n\nExtended Mode S\n\nExtended Mode S data is received directly from the aircraft and decoded for display on Flightradar24. Extended Mode S data can include additional information about the speed and altitude of the aircraft as well as weather information, such as wind and outside air temperature.\n\nFerry flight\n\nFerry flights usually involve flying aircraft to new customers, moving between airports/airfields or positioning aircraft for maintenance.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA)\n\nFounded in 1958, the FAA is the governing body charged with regulating all areas of civil aviation within the United States.\n\nFlight data recorder (FDR)\n\nFlight Data Recorders record a variety of flight parameters on a constant basis and are used as a forensic tool in the event of a crash or other serious incident. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have stringent requirements for the survivability of both the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Find out more about a Flight Data Recorders here.\n\nFlaperon\n\nAn aircraft flaperon is a combined control surface that serves both as an aileron and a flap. The flaperon is typically located on the trailing edge of an aircraft's wing, near the wing tip. Flaperons are commonly used on smaller aircraft, particularly those with limited wing area or span, as they allow for a reduction in the number of control surfaces required to achieve the desired level of control.\n\nFlaps\n\nFlaps on an aircraft are movable panels located on the trailing edge of the wings and can be extended or retracted to change the shape and surface area of the wings. Flaps are used during takeoff and landing to increase lift and provide more control over the aircraft at reduced speeds. Find out more about Flaps here >>\n\nFLARM\n\nFLARM (a portmanteau of 'flight' and 'alarm') is similar to ADS-B, but used in light aircraft, such as helicopters and gliders. The installation of FLARM equipment is approved by EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency). FLARM compared to traditional transponders has a much lower power consumption making it ideal for the likes of gliders.\n\nFlight Information Region (FIR) / Upper Information Region (UIR)\n\nFlight Information Regions and Upper Information Regions are geographic areas of air traffic control responsibility. The size of a FIRs and UIRs varies and is typically decided by the country, or countries, that the region covers. Oceanic airspace has its own classification as an Oceanic Information Region.\n\nFlight level (FL)\n\nA Flight Level is an aircraft's altitude at standard air pressure, 1013.25 hPa (29.92 inHg), and is expressed in hundreds of feet e.g. 37,000ft is expressed as FL370. Pilots use Flight Levels so that vertical separation can be carried out safely.\n\nFlight number\n\nA number assigned in the airline's schedule to denote a particular flight or flights. Airlines will regularly use flight number conventions such as designating northbound and eastbound flights with an even number, and southbound and westbound flights with an odd number. Often airlines use larger flight numbers such as BA9171 to indicate a maintenance or positioning flight.\n\nFlight plan\n\nThe exact routing a flight will take filed with air traffic control authorities, including specific waypoints the flight will pass over. A flight plan will typically be filed prior a flight by either a pilot or dispatcher. Flight plans are usually filed for IFR flights, with VFR flights only requiring a flight plan if they intend to cross an international border.\n\nFlight Management System (FMS)\n\nThe Flight Management System (FMS) is the digital brain behind modern aircraft navigation and control. Central to avionics, it integrates diverse data sources, including GPS, inertial navigation, and air data, to compute optimal flight paths. Pilots input waypoints, airways, and performance data through a Control Display Unit (CDU), allowing the FMS to calculate fuel-efficient routes, manage autopilot functions, and facilitate precise navigation.\n\nFuel jettison / fuel dumping\n\nSome aircraft are equipped with systems to jettison fuel in the event of an inflight emergency. Fuel jettison or dumping is usually done to decrease the weight of the aircraft so that it may land under its listed Maximum Landing Weight (MLW). Landing above the maximum landing weight is possible, but raises the risk of an issue on landing like burst tires or possible structural damage to the aircraft. Read more about fuel dumping here.\n\nFuel tankering\n\nFuel tankering is when an aircraft carries more fuel that is required for a particular flight, often an amount that is enough to complete the return flight with the required reserves. This is done for a number of operational reasons including fuel costs at the outstation airport, fuel quality, or to simply avoid having to refuel.\n\nFuselage\n\nThe fuselage in the main body of an aircraft. Generally tubular in shape, the fuselage holds the crew and passengers or cargo area.\n\nGlide slope\n\nA Glide Slope is a critical component of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) used in aviation for precision approach and landing. It is a precise descent path that helps guide aircraft to the runway during the landing phase. The Glide Slope is typically a radio signal transmitted from the ground, providing vertical guidance to pilots, indicating whether they are on the correct descent path.\n\nGo-around\n\nWhen a landing approach cannot be completed safely for any reason, an aircraft will initiate a go-around, which generally includes climbing to a pre-specified altitude and holding point while awaiting further instructions from air traffic control. There are various reasons for why a go-around may occur such as an aircraft ahead slow to vacate the runway or simply an unstable approach. Read more about how go arounds help keep flights safe.\n\nGPS altitude\n\nGPS altitude values are based on an ellipsoid of the entire earth, but are also not necessarily indicative of height above the ground.\n\nGPS jamming\n\nGPS jamming refers to the deliberate interference with Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, disrupting the ability of GPS receivers to accurately determine their position, velocity, and time. This interference can take various forms, such as transmitting signals on the same frequencies as GPS satellites or emitting noise to overwhelm GPS signals. View our GPS jamming map here.\n\nGround Proximity Warning System (GPWS)\n\nThe Ground Proximity Warning System is designed to alert pilots to the immediate dangers of flight into terrain. Read more about GPWS here.\n\nGround speed\n\nGround speed is the speed of the aircraft over the ground; often measured in Knots (nautical miles per hour). If an aircraft is subjected to a headwind this would have a negative impact on the ground speed, whilst a tailwind would have a positive impact.\n\nGrounding\n\nA ‘grounding’ is when an aircraft requires modifications or repairs in order to be fully compliant with airworthiness regulations. A recent example of this was with the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.\n\nHolding pattern\n\nA holding pattern typically occurs during a STAR (see STAR). These are often flown as ovals but sometimes a circular ‘orbit’ is used as a faster substitute. Holding patterns tend to occur over a fixed waypoint, usually a VOR.\n\nHorizontal stabilizer\n\nAn aircraft horizontal stabilizer, also known as the tailplane, is a fixed wing surface located at the rear of the airplane's fuselage. Its primary function is to provide stability and control of the aircraft in pitch, which is the up and down movement of the aircraft.\n\nIAS\n\nIndicated Airspeed is the air speed taken directly from the airspeed indicator without any corrections for temperature or pressure. Airspeed is displayed in knots which can be abbreviated further to KIAS (Knots Indicated Airspeed). IAS is sourced from the pitot tube system usually found around the nose of an aircraft.\n\nIATA\n\nThe International Air Transport Association is a trade organization made up of the world's airlines and has influence over the commercial aspects of flight. For flight tracking purposes, the two most important pieces of information are IATA airline and airport codes, which are two and three letters long, respectively, and differ from ICAO codes.\n\nList of IATA airline codes\n\nList of IATA airport codes\n\nICAO 24-bit Address (Hex Code)\n\nMode S transponders are assigned a unique 24-bit address, often called a hex code because of how it is generally displayed. Once registered the HEX code of an aircraft features on its certificate of registration and is rarely changed.\n\nICAO\n\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization is the arm of the United Nations responsible for international air navigation. ICAO performs a number of essential functions, including assigning aircraft type codes, airline codes, and airport codes. ICAO airline codes consist of three letters (Qantas = QFA) ICAO airport codes consist of four letters (Hong Kong = VHHH). These codes differ from IATA codes.\n\nList of ICAO airline codes\n\nList of ICAO airport codes\n\nList of ICAO aircraft type codes\n\nInstrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC)\n\nInstrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) signify challenging weather situations where visibility and cloud cover hinder visual navigation. In IMC, pilots rely extensively on onboard instruments and air traffic control guidance due to reduced visibility.\n\nInertial Navigation System (INS)\n\nAn Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a navigation technology used in aircraft and other vehicles to determine their position, orientation, and velocity with respect to a known starting point. The system relies on accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure changes in velocity and orientation, respectively, and integrates this data over time to calculate the vehicle's current position.\n\nIn-Flight Entertainment (IFE)\n\nIn-Flight Entertainment (IFE) is a crucial aspect of the passenger experience aboard aircraft, offering a range of entertainment options during the journey. IFE systems include seatback screens, audio channels, and sometimes Wi-Fi connectivity, providing passengers with access to movies, TV shows, music, games, and even live content.\n\nInstrument flight rules (IFR)\n\nInstrument Flight Rules are a set of regulations used for flying aircraft by instruments alone. An IFR flight may occur when the weather is below visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and is therefore deemed to be instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).\n\nInstrument landing system (ILS)\n\nAn ILS allows pilots to conduct instrument approaches by providing precision lateral and vertical guidance.\n\nIntegrated Standby Flight Display (IFSD)\n\nThe IFSD is a flight instrument, commonly found in modern airliners, which serves as a backup for primary instruments such as the altimeter, airspeed and attitude indicators.\n\nInternational Standard Atmosphere (ISA)\n\nThe International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is a static atmospheric model of how the pressure, temperature, density, and viscosity of the Earth's atmosphere change over a wide range of altitudes or elevations. The conditions for ISA are 1013 hectopascals in pressure, 15 degrees celsius in temperature, and 1.225 kg/m3 in surface density.\n\nJetway / Air bridge\n\nA jetway or air bridge is a movable and extendable structure that can be positioned to align with an aircraft door. It can then provide passenger and crew access to and from an airport terminal building. Read a brief history of the jetway here >>\n\nLocaliser\n\nIn aviation, a Localizer (LOC) is a fundamental component of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). Operating on the lateral axis, the Localizer provides horizontal guidance to aircraft during the approach and landing phases. Situated at the far end of the runway, the Localizer transmits a radio signal that pilots use to align their aircraft with the runway centerline.\n\nLift\n\nLift is the aerodynamic force generated by an aircraft's wings or lifting surfaces as it moves through the air. Lift opposes the force of gravity, enabling the aircraft to become airborne and stay aloft. It is primarily produced by the shape of the wings and the angle of attack—the angle between the chord line of the wing and the oncoming air.\n\nMach\n\nA Mach number is the ratio of True airspeed to the speed of sound at the altitude of a given flight. If an aircraft were to fly a Mach 0.75 it would be flying at 75% of the speed of sound. Mach ranges can be broken down into Subsonic, Transonic, Supersonic, Hypersonic, High-hypersonic, and re-entry speeds. As of now, all commercial flights are subsonic.\n\nManeuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)\n\nMCAS is a flight control system found on the Boeing 737 MAX. It was introduced to the 737 MAX to modify the pitch behavior of the Boeing 737 NG, providing NG rated pilots with flight characteristic familiarity.\n\nManufacturer's serial number (MSN)\n\nA Manufacturer's serial number, or MSN, is a unique code assigned to an aircraft, often prior to it even being built. The parts that make up an aircraft all reference the individual MSN.\n\nMicroburst\n\nA microburst is a localized and sudden downdraft of air characterized by a rapid descent of air within a small area. Microbursts are often associated with thunderstorms and can pose a significant hazard to aviation, especially during takeoff and landing. They are caused by intense downdrafts within a thunderstorm cell.\n\nMean Sea Level (MSL)\n\nMean Sea Level (MSL) is a standard reference point for measuring altitudes in aviation. It represents the average height of the sea surface and serves as a consistent baseline for altitude calculations. When aircraft altitudes are expressed in MSL, they indicate the distance above this reference, providing a uniform measure irrespective of geographic location. The standard pressure setting used for ‘mean sea level’ is 1013 hectopascals.\n\nMultilateration (MLAT)\n\nMultilateration is the process of using the time difference of arrival of radio signals from an aircraft to ascertain the aircraft's position and heading. MLAT requires four or more Flightradar24 receivers in a region to receive a signal from the same aircraft. From this we can then measure the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA).\n\nYou can read more about MLAT here.\n\nMode S\n\nMode S is a communication protocol that allows an aircraft to communicate with secondary surveillance radar (SSR) and other systems through its on-board transponder. Aircraft with a Mode S transponder are capable of utilizing TCAS and ACAS II functions.\n\nMETAR\n\nA METAR is a specialized form of weather reporting used mainly in aviation. METARs are standardized by ICAO and follow a specified format so that they may be understood easily by pilots around the world. METARs differ from a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) in that they provide actual weather at that time, rather than a forecast which a TAF provides. View a live METAR report here or find out how to read METAR weather reports >>\n\nMinimum Equipment List (MEL)\n\nA Minimum Equipment List (MEL) is a document in aviation that specifies the minimum equipment and systems required for an aircraft to operate legally under certain conditions with inoperative components. The MEL is developed by the aircraft manufacturer or operator and approved by aviation authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States or the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in Europe.\n\nMountainous Terrain Escape Routes\n\nWhen a flight occurs over an area of high, mountainous terrain, it’s vital that escape routes are planned so that in an emergency situation an aircraft is able to descend to an altitude below the Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA). Central Asia is a region where planned escape routes are regularly required due to the large areas of high terrain there.\n\nMultifunction Control Display Unit (MCDU)\n\nMultifunction Control Display Unit’s are typically found in Airbus aircraft and consist of a screen and keypad which the crew uses as an interface with the aircraft FMS (Flight Management System).\n\nNavigation Display (ND)\n\nThe Navigation Display (ND) is a critical component of modern aircraft avionics, prominently featured on the cockpit's electronic flight instrument system (EFIS). The ND provides pilots with real-time navigation information, displaying a comprehensive map of the aircraft's route, waypoints, and relevant airspace data.\n\nNorth Atlantic Tracks\n\nNorth Atlantic Tracks, officially known as North Atlantic Organized Track System (NAT-OTS) are a specified set of routes that stretch Eastbound and Westbound across the North Atlantic. They provide separation for aircraft, as well as taking into account optimum weather conditions. In order to utilise these tracks aircraft require Oceanic clearance. Find out more about North Atlantic Tracks here.\n\nNotice to Airmen (NOTAM)\n\nA Notice to Airmen NOTAMs are issued by aviation authorities to alert pilots to hazards or other important information they need to navigate the area safely. NOTAMs are filed with a country's aviation authority and then disseminated through a range of channels to provide up to date information to pilots and operators. Take a look at some example NOTAMs here.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\n\nThe NTSB is a US government agency tasked with investigating civilian transport accidents. They predominantly investigate aviation incidents and accidents, but also marine, highway, rail, and pipeline investigations.\n\nNon-directional beacon (NDB)\n\nA Non-directional beacon (NDB) is a radio beacon which transmits morse code identification signal. Aircraft can use Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) equipment to then navigate between NDB's.\n\nPrecision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI)\n\nPrecision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights are a visual aid for pilots during the approach phase of landing. Typically located beside the runway, these lights project a two-color signal—white and red. When an aircraft is on the correct glide path, the pilot sees two white and two red lights. If the aircraft is too high, three or more white lights appear, signaling a descent adjustment is needed. Conversely, too low results in more red lights.\n\nPitch\n\nPitch refers to the up-and-down motion of an aircraft around its lateral axis. Pitch is controlled by adjusting the angle of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer, which affects the amount of lift generated by the wings.\n\nPrimary Flight Display (PFD)\n\nA primary flight display typically provides flight crew with data relating to airspeed, altitude, heading and vertical speed.\n\nPrimary radar\n\nWhen discussing \"radar\", primary radar is generally what is being referred to. Primary radar outputs a radio signal and attempts to detect any reflection of that signal from an object, such as an airplane.\n\nPositioning flight\n\nAn airline positioning flight, sometimes known as a 'ferry flight', is a flight operated by an airline to move an aircraft or crew from one location to another without passengers or cargo on board. A positioning flight may be necessary when an aircraft needs to be moved to a different airport for scheduled maintenance, or when an airline needs to move an aircraft to a different location to meet operational needs.\n\nQNH\n\nQNH is an aeronautical 'Q code' which provides a barometric altimeter setting relating to airfield elevation above mean sea level. Standard QNH which is used when flying at Flight Levels is set to 1013.25hPa / 29.92inHg.\n\nQFE\n\nQFE is an aeronautical 'Q code' which provides a barometric altimeter setting which causes an altimeter to read zero when at the reference datum point of an airfield.\n\nRam Air Turbine (RAT)\n\nA Ram Air Turbine (RAT) is a small, independent turbine-driven generator or pump that is deployed in emergency situations on some aircraft. Its primary function is to provide essential power or hydraulic pressure when the main aircraft systems are compromised, such as during a loss of engine power or electrical failure.\n\nRegistration / Tail Number\n\nEach aircraft is assigned a registration number—often called a tail number—that is unique to the aircraft. Registration numbers are based on the country of registration, with the United Kingdom employing 'G' as their first letter identifier, followed by a hyphen and four further letters e.g. G-STBA. In the United States 'N' is used as the first letter followed by either letters or numbers e.g. N463UA.\n\nRepositioning flight\n\nRepositioning flights usually occur when an aircraft is out of place, either due to previous diversion or operational requirements.\n\nRudder\n\nAn aircraft rudder is a primary flight control surface located on the vertical stabilizer of an aircraft. The rudder is used to control the yaw of the aircraft, which is the rotation around its vertical axis. The rudder works by deflecting the airflow over the vertical stabilizer, creating a force that helps to turn the aircraft. When the rudder is deflected to the left, the aircraft's nose will turn to the left, and when the rudder is deflected to the right, the aircraft's nose will turn to the right.\n\nRunway Visual Range (RVR)\n\nRunway Visual Range is usually stated in feet (ft) or meters (m) and is the horizontal distance that pilots when positioned on the center line of a runway can see its surface markings or runway lights.\n\nSecondary radar\n\nSecondary radar, or secondary surveillance radar, sends out a signal to compatible aircraft, which then return a signal of their own with information about a flight, such as speed, altitude, heading, and registration.\n\nSlats\n\nAircraft slats are crucial aerodynamic devices installed on the leading edges of wings. Serving as movable surfaces, slats enhance an aircraft's lift and maneuverability during takeoff and landing. By extending or retracting, slats modify the wing's shape, optimizing airflow and preventing stalling at low speeds. Find out more about Slats here >>\n\nSpeed\n\nSpeed, as it relates to aircraft, is more complicated than speed on the ground, as there are different ways to measure speed in flight. The different ways to measure speed can result in differences between the types, whereby the ground speed of an aircraft can vary significantly from its airspeed. The speed shown in the \"speed\" box on Flightradar24 for all aircraft is ground speed.\n\nSpeedbrake\n\nAircraft speedbrakes, also known as spoilers, play a pivotal role in managing an aircraft's speed and descent. Typically located on the wings' upper surfaces, these movable panels disrupt smooth airflow, increasing drag and reducing lift. Pilots deploy speedbrakes during descent, approach, and landing to control airspeed effectively.\n\nSidestick\n\nAn aircraft sidestick is a type of aircraft control stick that is located at the side of the cockpit rather than in the center between the pilot and co-pilot seats. Commercially, these are most often found in Airbus aircraft. The sidestick is used to control the aircraft's pitch and roll movements.\n\nStandard instrument departure route (SID)\n\nAn SID is a published instrument flight rules (IFR) routing that pilots use directly after takeoff from an airport.\n\nStall\n\nA stall refers to a situation where an aircraft's wings are no longer generating enough lift to keep the aircraft in the air. This can happen when the angle of attack (the angle between the wing's chord line and the oncoming airflow) becomes too high, causing the airflow to separate from the wing's surface and reducing lift.\n\nStandard arrival route (STAR)\n\nA STAR is a published instrument flight rules (IFR) routing that pilots use prior to transitioning to their chosen approach and landing profile.\n\nSquawk\n\nEach flight is assigned a four digit code, known as a squawk, by air traffic control. This code is unique to the flight and helps ATC identify each flight. There are a few significant squawk codes, which immediately get the attention of air traffic control. For a longer discussion of squawk codes and emergencies, please see our discussion with a pilot and an air traffic controller.\n\n7500: Hijack\n\n7600: Radio Failure\n\n7700: General Emergency\n\nSlot\n\nA slot is a period of time lasting 15 minutes which is issued by Air Traffic Control in order to limit the amount of aircraft using certain airspace. The 15 minute period lasts from 5 minutes before to 10 minutes after the specific slot time.\n\nTactical Air Navigation System (TACAN)\n\nA TACAN is an UHF navigation system which provides aircraft with a distance and bearing.\n\nTAF\n\nTerminal Area Forecasts are similar in format to METARs, but are issued for future periods. For major civil airports TAFs are issued every six hours, usually at 0000, 0600, 1200, 1800 UTC. Military TAFs are normally issued every three hours.\n\nTAS\n\nTrue Airspeed is the airspeed of an aircraft corrected for position and instrument error and taking pressure and temperature into account.\n\nThreshold\n\nA runway threshold is the starting point of a runway at an airport that's available for landing. It's the point where an aircraft should ideally touch down, and is usually marked with painted lines or lights.\n\nThrust\n\nIn aviation, thrust refers to the force generated by an aircraft's propulsion system, typically produced by its engines, to overcome aerodynamic drag and propel the aircraft forward. It is a crucial component in achieving and maintaining flight, counteracting resistance and allowing the aircraft to move through the air.\n\nThrust Reverser\n\nA Thrust Reverser is a system commonly found on jet engines that helps to decelerate an aircraft upon landing. It works by temporarily redirecting the flow of engine exhaust forward, rather than backward as during normal forward flight. This reversal of thrust assists in slowing down the aircraft on the runway, reducing the reliance on wheel brakes and enhancing overall braking efficiency.\n\nTCAS\n\nA Traffic Collision Avoidance System allows aircraft to communicate if equipped with a compatible transponder in order to prevent a mid-air collision. The TCAS warns pilots of traffic in the vicinity and can issue directives to help pilots maintain separation if flights come too close to one another.\n\nTransponder\n\nA portmanteau of transmitter-responder, the transponder emits a radio signal based on an interrogation from an outside source, either air traffic control or another aircraft. In normal operation a pilot will be instructed by an air traffic controller to set a specific code on their transponder and when this happens the terminology used will be to 'squawk' a code e.g. \"Speedbird 115 squawk 4552\".\n\nTurbulence\n\nTurbulence is characterized by a disturbance to an aircraft whilst in flight. It can be caused by a variety of factors, from the mixing of air masses to mountains and mechanical turbulence from buildings. It is categorized as light, moderate, severe and extreme. Find out more about turbulence here.\n\nUniversal Access Transceiver (UAT)\n\nUniversal Access Transceiver (UAT) is a communication device used in aviation that is designed to enable aircraft to communicate with ground stations, other aircraft, and air traffic control facilities. UAT supports various functionalities aimed at enhancing aviation safety and efficiency. One of its key functions is Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B), which allows aircraft to broadcast their position, velocity, and other data to ground stations and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In receivers.\n\nVertical Speed\n\nVertical speed is the rate at which a plane is ascending or descending, often shown in feet/meters per minute. Generally, vertical speed during departure will range from 1000-3000 feet per minute, while during descent, speeds can be between 600-800 feet per minute.\n\nVery High Frequency Omni-Directional Range (VOR)\n\nA VOR, or Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Range is a short range radio navigation beacon. By using a network of VORs pilots can determine their position and course."
