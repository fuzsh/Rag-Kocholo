        "text": "Local radio and TV stations, along with cable, direct broadcast satellite and wireless service providers, disseminate the public safety messages they receive from IPAWS.\n\nLocal radio and television stations help communicate important warnings as Emergency Alert System (EAS) participants.\n\nIn many cases, radio and TV stations continue to operate when other means of alerting the public are unavailable, providing a layer of resiliency to the suite of available emergency communication tools.\n\nEmergency Alert System Participants\n\nCommercial Mobile Service Providers are wireless providers who voluntarily participate in the Wireless Emergency Alerts system.\n\nCommercial Mobile Service Providers\n\nThe National Public Warning System (NPWS), also known as Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations, are radio broadcast stations that work with FEMA to provide emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during and after incidents and disasters. The FEMA NPWS also serves as the primary source of initial broadcast for a national alert.\n\nNPWS stations are equipped with back-up communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event.\n\nThe NPWS can directly reach more than 90% of the U.S. population and ensures that under all conditions the President can alert and warn the public.\n\n*Note: SiriusXM broadcasts the NPWS messages to the public and other EAS Participants. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, NPR, and Premiere Networks provide a source of NPWS to EAS participants that may not be within the coverage area of an NPWS radio station."
