        "text": "HamSphere is a unique platform, the only one of its kind in the world providing the experience of a realistic HF radio. For radio amateurs, the sun has a very special meaning. Because it is also the main cause for what can be achieved on shortwave and other bands, i.e. how well we can reach distant places by radio worldwide. We are talking about the propagation conditions.\n\nThe HamSphere propagation model takes in to account the physics of planet Earth, its surface topography like the continents, land masses, water bodies, oceans, lakes and seas. It also models hundreds of kilometers of atmosphere above the earth's surface, the ionization of gases in the upper atmosphere to realistically produce ionospheric layers.\n\nThe ionization due to the radiations from the sun based on Sunspot Numbers (SSN) and the Solar Flux Index (SFI) determine the behavior of the Ionosphere and follow the 11 year solar cycle.\n\nWhen you start your HamSphere transceiver you will have the look, feel and sound of a real Amateur Radio transceiver.\n\nHamSphere uses real modelled NEC designed antennas (Numerical Electromagnetic Code). We offer everything from wire-antennas, yagies and quads which adds to the total realism of the system. Rotatable antennas can be set between 0-359 degrees and the gain and characteristics of the antennas are very much like real HF antennas.\n\nWe provide antennas to cover all bands between 160-6m."
