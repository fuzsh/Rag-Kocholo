        "text": "Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) is a unique 9 digit number that is assigned to a (Digital Selective Calling) DSC radio or an AIS unit. Similar to a cell phone number, your MMSI number is your unique calling number for DSC radios or an AIS unit. The information provided when obtaining a MMSI number is transferred into the U.S. Coast Guard's national distress database for use in emergency situations.\n\nBoatUS has been authorized by both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Coast Guard to assign MMSI numbers to vessels with DSC capable radios that are not required by law to carry a radio, and do not make international voyages or communications. BoatUS is responsible for relaying the MMSI registration information to the U.S. Coast Guard for search and rescue purposes.\n\nMMSI numbers are free for BoatUS Members or $25 for non-Members.\n\nRegistration Criteria\n\nBoatUS has been authorized by both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Coast Guard to assign MMSI numbers only to vessels that meet the following criteria:\n\nUsed for recreation only\n\nNot required by law to carry a radio\n\nNot required by law to have a FCC Ship Station license\n\nVessel is under 65' in length\n\nDo not communicate with or visit foreign ports (i.e. Canada, Bahamas, Mexico, and the Caribbean)\n\nIf you do not meet these criteria, you are legally required to obtain a Ship Station License from the FCC. They will issue an MMSI number with a Ship Station License.\n\nDigital Selective Calling (DSC) is a radio technology allowing enhanced distress radio messages to be sent digitally. Since 1999, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) has required new fixed mount VHF radio sold in the U.S. to be equipped with the DSC feature.\n\nDSC radios have a one-button emergency transmit button that sends the vessel's unique MMSI number. In addition, if the DSC equipped radio is linked to a GPS or Loran unit, the distress call will include the vessel's position. Should the operator become incapacitated, the radio will continue sending the mayday. In addition, a DSC equipped vessel with an MMSI number can make a \"private\" hailing call to another DSC-equipped vessel. Only the vessel being called will receive the initial contact, but the subsequent conversation will take place on an open, “working” channel, which can be monitored by any VHF equipped vessel within your broadcast range.\n\nPlease refer to you radio’s owner’s manual or contact the radio manufacturer for additional information about you radio’s capabilities.\n\nBoatUS MMSI numbers are for US registered or documented, recreational vessels under 65’ that are not visiting or communicating with foreign ports. The registration data provided to BoatUS is only transferred into the U.S. Coast Guard Search & Rescue Database (MISLE). International search & rescue agencies do not have access to the registration data provided to BoatUS.\n\nRegistration data for FCC-assigned MMSI numbers go into the International Telecom Union (ITU) database that is accessible to international search & rescue agencies. In order to be accepted into the ITU database, any FCC assigned MMSI must end in zero. This is why the BoatUS MMSI number cannot be re-used when later applying for an FCC MMSI number for international cruising.\n\nIf you plan to use the handheld on multiple boats, you might want a separate MMSI number so that you can update the registration information according to which boat it is currently on. If you only plan to use the handheld on one boat, you can use the same MMSI number that is programmed into the fixed mount radio onboard.\n\nIf you need to test to see if the DSC feature is working, do not test the red distress button as this will send out an illegal false alarm and cause an unnecessary rescue response! Instead, you may run a test call to the nationwide Coast Guard MMSI number, 003669999. Enter this number into your radio’s calling memory and select the “Test Call” option from the radio’s list of individual DSC calls, then press the “call” or “enter” key. Your radio will silently hail the Coast Guard with a digital signal on channel 70. If everything is working properly, your radio will almost immediately receive the Coast Guard’s acknowledgement of your call, providing assurance that both your radio and the Rescue21 system are operating properly.\n\nAlternatively you may also use the DSC function to privately hail another boater’s MMSI number so that they can verify what MMSI came up on their ID. The DSC functions do not work until an MMSI number is programmed in. If your radio contains or is connected to a GPS, the signal will also provide your exact coordinates.\n\nIf the MMSI number was assigned by BoatUS and the previous owner has cancelled their registration, BoatUS can transfer the MMSI number to the new owner. If the previous owner has not closed the account, we will attempt to contact them to verify that they are not still using the number in another radio. If the previous owner cannot be contacted or is still improperly using the MMSI you will need to reprogram the radio with a new number. To check if your MMSI was assigned through BoatUS, email mmsi@boatus.com.\n\nShip Station Licenses are not transferable from one boat to another, but the FCC will offer a prorated refund for the years remaining on the ship station license should the owner cancel once the boat has been sold. BoatUS cannot assist with the MMSI transfer process for an FCC assigned MMSI in connection with a ship station license, but if the prior owner of the MMSI has cancelled the ship station license through the FCC, the MMSI can be transferred to the ship station license of the new owner of the vessel and programmed radio by contacting the FCC at 1-877-480-3201.\n\nIf the new owner is not required to carry a Ship Station License and has confirmed that the previous owner has cancelled his ship station license, the new owner can input the FCC assigned MMSI into the BoatUS database by going to Non-BoatUS MMSI service page."
