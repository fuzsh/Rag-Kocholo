        "text": "1In popular recollection, the 1970s have gone down as the dark ages, Britain’s gloomiest period since the Second World War. It may be that the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016 will herald a period of even greater crisis, but for the moment the sombre seventies, set between Harold Wilson’s ‘swinging sixties’ and Margaret Thatcher’s divisive eighties, stand alone. They began with massive trade union stoppages against Heath’s Industrial Relations Act. They continued with the financial crisis of the IMF and the random atrocities of the Irish Republicans. They ended with the ‘Winter of Discontent’ when unparalleled strikes, official and unofficial, revealed a country ‘as governable as Chile’ in the populist view of one US politician, and reduced the Labour prime minister, James Callaghan, himself an old trade union official, to a paralysis of despair. He felt, as he told Ken Stowe, his private secretary (and later me) that he had ‘let the country down’. The idea of ‘dark ages’ is indeed literally appropriate. Recollections of the seventies are coloured by memories of a public blackout, reminiscent of the second world war during the blitz, without the compensating feeling of national heroism and historic endurance. The earlier years of the decade featured not only many strikes by the engineers and electrical workers, but Edward Heath’s catastrophic three-day week in response to the miners’ strike of 1974 when London’s major thoroughfares were cast into darkness, shops and restaurants were unlit and gloomy, public television services were suspended for several nights a week, and suburban families ate their sombre dinners at home not very romantically with the light of such spare candles as shopkeepers still had available.\n\nThe Down Side\n\n3The negative aspects of Britain in the seventies, on which commentators focussed, were essentially four. These were conflict and class war in industry, a sharp downturn in the economy, a flight to extremism in political life, and a rise in public and domestic violence. Without doubt, each of these revealed a new pattern of internal vulnerability not experienced previously, and a marked contrast with the stable social democracy that the United Kingdom had appeared to be since the second world war, both under Labour’s welfare democracy under Attlee after 1945 and Wilson after 1964, and the thirteen years of emollient ‘one-nation Toryism’ in between. Now there were new challenges to which a post-imperial, once-great power seemed unable to respond.\n\n4The social conflict in industry, certainly, was on a scale and of a character not experienced since the days of the Triple Alliance, Black Friday and the General Strike between 1919 and 1926. It is true that warning signs of future conflict had been evident in the later sixties. The Donovan report of 1968 illustrated how the internal structures of leadership in the unions had been changing in the sixties with power increasingly passing to shop stewards like ‘Red Robbo’ (Derek Robinson) in Longbridge and Alan ‘the Mole’ Thornett in the Cowley car plant in Oxford during unofficial strikes. National collective bargaining was becoming localised which gave militants on the shop floor more power. Barbara Castle, backed by the prime minister, Harold Wilson, had tried to deal with this by legislation but her 1969 Industrial Relations Bill was strongly opposed by the unions. It met with its nemesis in Cabinet, the main opponent being no less than the Home Secretary, Jim Callaghan. But the turmoil provoked by Heath’s 1971 Industrial Relations Act was of a quite different order. It was a dangerous attempt to apply legal sanctions to industrial relations which had been governed by voluntary collective bargaining since the 1906 Trades Disputes Act, a policy which the Donovan report had previously supported. The irony was that the unions had carefully observed the terms of the Act – and yet the strikes went on. Furthermore, the trade unions were now primed for battle as never before. Their membership had been rising fast, reaching a record 13,498,000 in 1979, growing spectacularly amongst white- collar workers, with unions like NUPE and NALGO recruiting strongly amongst local government workers and amongst groups such as health service workers and schoolteachers. The unions now had immensely powerful national officials like Jack Jones, secretary of the mighty Transport and General Union, with well over a million members. Frightened journalists wrote of ‘The Emperor Jones’ and of the ‘terrible twins’, Jones and his associate Hugh Scanlon of the Engineers. Heath’s Industrial Relation Act of 1971 led to the largest trade union protests for two generations, while a hitherto unknown public official called the Official Solicitor was called in to release some trade officials, the so-called ‘Pentonville Five’, from gaol. Worse still followed with two national coal miners’ strikes in 1972 and the beginning of 1974, the first such since 1926. They were solidly backed by the TUC’s general secretary, Vic Feather. The first led to a total surrender to the wage and bonus demands of the miners (a surrender duly noted by the government’s Minister for Education, Margaret Thatcher). The second in January 1974 led to a national state of emergency, the three-day week and a general election called by Heath on the theme ‘Who Governs Britain?’ The answer appeared to be the unions since Heath was defeated and had to resign.\n\n8Closely intertwined with the industrial conflicts of the seventies, of course, was the decline of the economy. Despite repeated balance of payments problems and the forced devaluation of the pound in 1967, the Labour government of the sixties kept things reasonably stable. Employment was high; inflation under control. Economic historians wrote of a ‘golden age’ of the economy which lasted from 1945 to 1973. However, the Labour years had been one of frequent crisis, with frequent recourse to bailouts from the US Treasury. The plan for four per cent a year economic growth had manifestly failed, and the growth rate in 1964 – 70 had, if anything, been below that of the previous six years under the Tories. The new department supposed to promote growth, the Department of Economic Affairs under George Brown had been humiliatingly abolished. From the early seventies, the dark clouds rolled in.\n\n12There can scarcely be any argument that Britain’s economic standing was severely weakened through the seventies, by global issues of inflation, and by industrial disorder at home. The country suffered and governments were hapless victims. The partial recovery in 1977 – 8 suggests that there was still resilience. One fortuitous salvation was floating the pound, that is, the ending of fixed exchange rates, surviving from the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, in 1972. While this ate into the exchange value of the pound, it means that it was no longer a reserve currency and the reserves less buffeted about by global pressures. More practical and visible was the fact that in later seventies, oil from the North Sea was starting to come through after 1975 to the immense benefit of both the balance of payments and inflationary pressures. Europe’s sick man seemed likely to become as oil rich as countries in the Middle East, perhaps even to enter OPEC. But this would only really assist the economy if the gains were devoted to investment and modernization, and British internal economic relations were to become less disorderly. As Margaret Thatcher entered 10 Downing Street in May 1979, somewhat vacuously citing blessings from St. Francis of Assisi, this all seemed a long way off.\n\n14In the seventies, it all changed and turned very sour. In both the Labour and the Conservative parties there were sharp moves to the extremes. Worryingly for both parties, two-party politics in which the big parties aggregated up to 90 of the vote for themselves, was giving way to a more fluid system in which the Liberal Party showed a brisk revival under Jeremy Thorpe, challenges threatened the Labour ascendancy in both Scotland and Wales from the nationalist parties, and individual revolts against their party’s leaders were more numerous, as with Dick Taverne in the Labour Party in Lincoln and Enoch Powell in the Conservatives who migrated to North Down in Ulster. British politics seemed pluralist, almost unrecognisable.\n\n16In the Labour Party, entryism of a quite different kind was under way. The disillusion with Labour policies, including the failure of planning, had generated major changes in the party in the years of opposition between 1970 and 1974. The evasions and compromises of Wilson’s leadership had generated widespread discontent both in the constituency parties and the trade unions. The grass-roots, discontented with a complacent, inbred party apparatus in many of Labour’s heartland constituencies, moved sharply to the left. They found their inspiration in Tony Benn, a centrist, pro-Europe, pro-NATO Minister of Technology under Wilson, who now became the voice of socialist revolt and a charismatic figure for the rank and file. By 1972 his outlook had changed completely. Allied to far-left colleagues like Eric Heffer and the veteran Ian Mikardo, he was an articulate, dangerously charismatic leader of the constituency far left. He was notably unfussy about his political allies, who included key leaders, Trotskyist or even Stalinist, later prominent in the Militant Tendency, directing their fire against what seemed to be the tired old party leadership. One of them, in Haringey in North London, was the future leader of the party forty years on, Jeremy Corbyn. They elaborated a programme that rejected almost every major part of Labour’s programme. They wanted higher taxation, extensive further nationalization, the imposition of central planning agreements on private industry with private co-operatives in specific plants, unilateral nuclear disarmament, ‘troops out’ in Northern Ireland, and the no British membership of the European Common Market. Meetings of the party conference, even more of the party executive, became divisive and highly contentious, especially when left-wing officials like the party secretary Ron Hayward were appointed. In the later seventies, with a violent upsurge in the constituencies, encouraged by Benn, hostile to any anti-inflation policies or dealings with the IMF, party conferences became a nightmare. With their demand for an enclosed siege economy at home, and a ‘socialist foreign policy’ overseas, the Labour Party rank and file, like Stalin, was pursuing socialism in one country.\n\n17More dangerous were the mass trade- union leftists who turned to radical political action, stirred by the industrial revolt against wage restraint. Union power made itself felt throughout the party. No longer, as in the old days of leaders like Arthur Deakin of the Transport Workers were the unions loyal and docile followers of the ‘labour alliance’ with the political party. Many of their leaders were on the far left willing to ignore the usually more moderate views of the rank and file, as with Alan Fisher, secretary of NUPE, strongly entrenched in local government, or Ray Buckton of the engine drivers’ union, ASLEF. A rising young militant in the Miners’ union Arthur Scargill of the Yorkshire men, famous for his flying pickets and ‘the battle of Saltley Gates’ during the 1972 national strike, was effectively a Communist. Many of them, like Moss Evans of the TGWU seemed to have little understanding of political processes at all, and, despite the ‘social contract’ concluded with the Labour Party in 1973, little concern for how their actions might affect the future election of a Labour government. It was the world of industrial relations, or rather industrial confrontation, that interested them. As the old Yorkshire leader Ben Smith, had once observed, ‘On t’ field, that’s t’ place’. Allied to the Bennites and Militants in the constituents, they were pushing the party to a place far to the left of the Bevanites in the fifties. After all, Bevan’s followers claimed to be extra-parliamentary. The new, hard left was enthusiastically anti-parliamentary.\n\nThe Renewal\n\n26It should also be said that some aspects of challenge in the seventies were portents of future progress for this country. This particularly applies to women two themes that occasioned much debate at the time – feminism and Celtic nationalism. British women had not moved on from their traditional unambitious role earlier on, despite the flamboyance of the ‘swinging sixties’. Young women remained fairly conventional in their social and moral attitudes (including pre-marital sex), despite the frisson they caused amongst young men with their miniskirts and absorption in pop culture. The seventies was different. Works such as Germaine Greer’s Female Eunuch (1970) and the publishing house ‘Virago’ opened up new world of female self-expression and a more critical attitude to the traditional limited horizons bred in young British females almost from birth. Journalists like Jill Tweedie and others on the Guardian’s Women’s Page became apostles of a more adventurous, rebellious way of life. A major stimulus was the extension of higher education with women entering universities and colleges in far greater numbers, indeed coming in time to provide a majority of Britain’s students. All Oxford and Cambridge’s colleges would now admit women. It would take a long time for glass and other ceilings to be destroyed in women’s access to major posts in business and the professions, but progress was made in the seventies. Labour governments also helped with the 1970 Equal Pay Act, and the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975. On a more sombre note, the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act of 1976 gave women greater protection against violent husbands or partners. Here the tension and challenge of the seventies was clearly the result of progressive, egalitarian change which removed, at least in part, the shackles, professional and personal, which had for so long blighted women’s lives. Divorce went up but so did opportunity.\n\n28The implications of this were controversial. Many feared that piecemeal devolutions would unravel the historic Union of the United Kingdom, and fears multiplied with the progress of the SNP from 2007 onwards which led to a referendum on Scottish independence which failed. A federal state at least seemed possible. But it was clear, too, that in both Scotland and Wales devolution had a liberating, democratizing effect. In Scotland, it inspired a sense of dynamism in civil society, combined with a positive view on immigration and union with Europe. In Wales, the culture and language flourished, though the economy did not. The blonde Welsh-speaking soubrette, Cerys Matthews of Catatonia, sang that ‘every morning I wake up and thank the Lord I’m Welsh’. On balance the growth of Celtic nationalism, like feminism, looks like a positive portent of change that invigorated marginalised parts of the United Kingdom, making it less centralised and simply less dominated by England. In 2016 it was a saga yet unfinished.\n\n29But the area in which seventies Britain showed the most dynamic advance – albeit one that evokes some regretful nostalgia after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, was in relation to Europe. This was truly a historic and fundamental change. The US Secretary of State, Dean Rusk had famously observed in 1960 that Britain had lost an empire but was still seeking a role. That was still true in 1970 with two British applications to join the EEC rebuffed by President de Gaulle, the Commonwealth manifestly less central to Britain’s needs, and Heath, the new prime minister, far less concerned with building up the ‘special relationship’, so-called, with the United States. Heath introduced a quite new momentum. He was an enthusiastic European, coming from Kent close to France and with powerful memories of service in the war, and the years of peace that resulted. He began serious talks about access to Europe and its common market in 1971. This time he confronted not the stern resistance of President de Gaulle, but a far more emollient French president, Georges Pompidou. They had a major breakthrough meeting in Paris on 20 – 21 May 1971, which survived even Heath’s dreadful French. There were tricky discussions about food imports from Commonwealth countries, the common fisheries policy and British budgetary contributions to sustain the Common Agricultural Plan to help French and German farmers. The underlying Monnet-inspired idea of ‘ever closer union’ politically was wisely pushed off centre-stage. In October 1972, the deed was done when the Commons agreed to entry with a majority of 112. Nearly all the Conservatives, save for a few die-hards like Enoch Powell, supported it, as did the great mass of business and the newspapers. Labour was deeply riven, but 67 Labour MPs, headed by Roy Jenkins and also including other prominent figures like John Smith and Cledwyn Hughes voted with the government, while another 20 abstained. On 1 January 1973, British became officially Europeans, even if with only modified rapture. Heath presented it as the answer to Britain’s endemic economic problems, but many others remained sceptics.\n\n30The real problems of reconciling the British with Europe, the land mass only twenty miles away from Beachy Head, came in 1974 when Labour and Harold Wilson returned to power. The party had been disunited at the time of Heath’s negotiations and indeed had officially voted against British membership in 1972. There were many on the left who saw it as a free-market capitalist club whose financial policies were incompatible with democratic socialism. Many too, from Enoch Powell on the right to Tony Benn and Michael Foot on the left saw European membership as an invasion of British sovereignty, the supremacy of parliament and the primacy of the British common law. Wilson, who was agnostic on the whole European question but desperate to preserve party unity on the matter, determined the final strategy. This was to call for the first time a nationwide referendum on membership of Europe, preceded by a purported renegotiation of the terms agreed, with Cabinet ministers free to campaign on either side of the issue. Callaghan’s deft hands were used for the renegotiation. While most of the new decisions were little more than cosmetic, he was able to claim achievements over the British contributions to the European budget and the admission of Commonwealth products like Canadian and Australian meat and New Zealand butter, in a very unsentimental but business-like way. No Gaitskellite rhetoric about the Dardanelles and Vimy Ridge here, nor Callaghanite emphasis on ‘the language of Chaucer and Milton’. The European negotiators agreed to phase down contributions for countries suffering temporary balance of payments problems. A regional fund was also set up to assist areas like Callaghan’s own Wales. The referendum campaign and was tranquil and free from bitterness in the main. There was much financial support from pro-Europe banks and business groups. Unlike 2016, there was cross-party collaboration in the campaign, with Heath and Jenkins cheerfully sharing platforms, and Foot speaking alongside his friend Enoch Powell.\n\n31With a background of solid support, membership of Europe easily went through. It was a two to one majority, with around 17 million voting for membership and around 8 million against. The voters accepted the result with equanimity – after all the European world was far more familiar now with millions of British people taking holidays on the continent, notably France, Italy and ex-Franco Spain. Young people, especially students, were growing up in a multi-cultural world, enjoying claret and cappuccino and riding Lambrettas, with European fashions, films, food and football part of normal day-to-day experience. There had not been a proper debate. The political aims of the EEC were not considered at all, not even British entry into the European parliament, which finally happened in 1979. There were constant grumbles about French farmers, Spanish fishermen and Germans of all shades. Immigration was not an issue. There was not much affection on display, especially within the Labour Party whose 1979 manifesto was opposed to membership. It was no union of hearts. British Euroscepticism remained powerful and never went away. But it was also a colossal breakthrough, in terms of trade, political associations and perhaps in national psychology. The Battle of Britain insularity of 1940 vintage had gone. At last Britain had found a role, which seemingly would determine its future for the rest of time.\n\n33This tranquil view is not a bad requiem on the stormy seventies. The land was tortured by innumerable crises during that decade. Some like Northern Ireland dragged on for more than two decades. But it had its elements of stability and progress. In the future, many would hail Margaret Thatcher as the pilot who weathered the storms and restored order and national self-confidence. In some ways she undoubtedly did so, though at grave social cost. She also converted New Labour to many of her essential principles. But the decade of Heath, Wilson and Callaghan, had its own successes, as an exercise in survival and, in the case of Europe, brilliant vision. Perhaps the so-called dark ages when the lights went out veiled a process of readjustment and renewal. Britain remained a land if not of glory at least of hope."
