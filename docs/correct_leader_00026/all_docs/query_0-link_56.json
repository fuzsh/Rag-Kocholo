        "text": "There is universal agreement that the British prime minister’s power to appoint and dismiss his or her fellow ministers is among his or her most important powers, probably his most important power. In appointing ministers, he or she shapes his government. In dismissing them, he does likewise. Merely possessing the power to dismiss individual ministers gives the prime minister far greater leverage over them than he or she would otherwise have. As Peter Hennessy puts it in The Prime Minister:\n\nRichard Crossman, while still a long-serving member of Harold Wilson’s cabinet, addressed an audience at Harvard in similar terms:\n\nTo imagine a prime minister deprived of his or her power of appointment and dismissal is to imagine the holder of a much diminished office.\n\nIn Britain, the power of the head of government to appoint and dismiss his or her fellow ministers is largely unfettered. The only severe constraint upon him or her – but it is severe – is that the great majority of his appointments must be made from among the elected members of the House of Commons.Footnote 3 In the United States, France, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, for example, serving government ministers may not simultaneously be members of the national legislature; if they are members of the national legislature at the time of their appointment, they must immediately vacate their seats.Footnote 4 In other countries – Germany, Austria, Italy, Finland, Denmark and Japan, for example – members of the cabinet may be members of parliament but need not be.Footnote 5 In all of those countries, unlike in the United Kingdom, those making ministerial appointments have a degree of flexibility in reaching out beyond the ranks of legislators and even, in some cases, beyond the ranks of politicians and party members.\n\nAt the same time, however, British prime ministers are not constrained in ways that many other heads of government are. British prime ministers can appoint and dismiss more or less whomever they like. The decisions are theirs, and they can make them on more or less whatever basis they like. That is not so in many countries, especially those countries – a large proportion of the world’s democracies – in which coalition governments rather than majority governments are the norm. In those countries, even if the head of government has the formal power to appoint and dismiss ministers, he or she is likely to be largely or wholly constrained by the need to negotiate individual appointments and portfolios with the leaders of the other parties in the coalition – and quite possibly with other leading figures in his or her own party. In Italy, the prime minister has usually ‘played a very limited part in the choice of ministers, as their selection [has been] left to each party of the coalition within the quota of ministerial positions assigned to that party’.Footnote 6 Similarly, in Austria, ‘the Chancellor’s power of nomination is restricted, as one of the principles of the Austrian coalition government is that each party has full autonomy in the selection of its cabinet members’.Footnote 7 The same has historically been the case in such countries as the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland and even in France and Germany when the incumbent administration in one or other of those two countries has depended for its parliamentary majority on more than one party. Until recently, the Australian Labor party (ALP) and the New Zealand Labour party excluded the prime minister entirely from the selection process: the two parties’ parliamentary caucuses elected all the members of the ALP and New Zealand Labour party cabinets. In 2007, however, Australia’s newly elected Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd, broke with tradition and chose his own cabinet.Footnote 8\n\nMoreover, whereas British prime ministers, like American presidents, take for granted their power to dismiss ministers from their cabinet, heads of government in many other countries are afforded no such luxury. They are constitutionally or customarily prevented from dismissing their colleagues, or, more commonly, are prevented from doing so by the exigencies of factional and coalition politics. Only three Japanese prime ministers in the six decades since the end of the Second World War have felt strong enough to dismiss a cabinet minister outright.Footnote 9 The Italian prime minister ‘has no constitutional power to sack individual ministers’ and, even if he had, sacking ministers would normally precipitate the fall of his government.Footnote 10 In Norway, ‘it is also difficult for the Prime Minister to dismiss ministers not belonging to his or her own party without disrupting the often fragile compromises underlying the cabinet formation’.Footnote 11 The case of the Netherlands is extreme but by no means untypical:\n\nAnd no Dutch prime minister since then has sought to reassert that claim. The phrase ‘Persian constitutional morals’ hints at despotism, but every British prime minister enjoys precisely such despotic powers.\n\nThe British premier’s capacious power both to appoint and to dismiss his or her fellow ministers has, of course, always been significant. H. H. Asquith’s appointment of David Lloyd George as chancellor of the exchequer in 1908 tilted the balance of the then Liberal government sharply to the left, as Asquith knew it would, and accelerated the introduction of the British welfare state. Stanley Baldwin’s unexpected appointment of Winston Churchill as chancellor in 1924 reinforced Baldwin’s already declared determination to reunite the Conservative party and present it to the nation as a centrist party of good government. In 1929, the incoming Labour prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, filled his diary with gloomy reflections on the importunities of ambitious office-seekers: ‘I have broken hearts – one man all but fainted when I told him he could not get what he expected.’Footnote 13 Clement Attlee’s cabinet appointments in 1945 did not indicate any disposition on his part to be a dominant prime minister, but they did indicate a clear determination to prevent civil war within the government by keeping two heavyweight figures who hated each other, Ernest Bevin and Herbert Morrison, out of each other’s way.\n\nAll that is true. But it is also true that the prime minister’s power of appointment and dismissal is almost certainly even more significant now than it was a century ago or even half a century ago. In the first place, governments are now larger than they used to be, with the prime minister having more posts to fill – and, of course, to empty. Gordon Brown appointed seventy-five House of Commons ministers in June 2007 compared with Ramsay MacDonald’s thirty-eight in 1929 and Harold Macmillan’s fifty-four as recently as 1957.Footnote 14 In the second place, the incidence of career politicians – men and women who are not content to remain on the back benches but aspire to ministerial office – is almost certainly higher now than it was in previous generations. An old fact of the constitution – the prime minister’s power to hire and fire – has had added to it a new fact of political sociology:\n\nDespite the centrality of the prime minister’s appointment and dismissal power, academic political scientists have not paid much attention to it. They have noted its existence and have readily acknowledged its central importance, but few of them have investigated in any detail how prime ministers actually use their power. The treatment has tended to be highly generalized. Almost the only exception is a decades-old article, published in Parliamentary Affairs, by R. K. Alderman and J. A. Cross.Footnote 16 The reasons for political scientists’ reticence in this connection are obvious. Not only have prime ministers over the decades appointed and dismissed thousands of individual ministers, including hundreds of cabinet ministers, but they have had very little to say, at least publicly, about their reasons for making the decisions they have. In some cases, they have probably not wanted their reasons to be known. In others, they have probably been somewhat unclear themselves about their reasons or have at any rate not felt any need to articulate them. In any case, no prime minister could possibly allow himself to get into the position of having to explain and defend seriatim his appointment and dismissal decisions (not to mention his decisions to reshuffle).\n\nPolitical scientists are, therefore, largely left to fend for themselves: to try to divine prime ministers’ motives from what little they have said in public and from the political and personal circumstances that appear to have pertained at the time. In other words, gathering systematic evidence in this field is difficult, and knowing how to interpret the evidence – and how much reliance to place on one’s own interpretations – is even more difficult. Still, a serious attempt is worth making. The subject is too important to be left as a kind of terra incognita or as a matter of mere gossip, anecdotage and speculation."
