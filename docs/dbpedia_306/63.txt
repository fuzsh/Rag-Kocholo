The Courage Film Festival is aimed at all the filmmakers and screenwriters who use their work to take a stand and fight for what they believe is right! We're now looking for submissions for our the edition in Berlin in Fall 2024.

We welcome films and screenplays that fight for good causes and portray the struggles and adversity that people and groups face when trying to bring about positive change and influence in a world where you sometimes have to shout in order to make yourself heard.

We are looking for stories that spark discussions and debates and are the protagonists for positive change and development in the world. All themes are welcome, covering topics such as women, immigration, the environment, family, equality, mental health, disability, etc.

People face challenges every day. Will your story ignite courage in another human?

We want to hear your stories and give you a platform to share them and to also discuss the issues portrayed in your film with like-minded filmmakers. Our events include screenings and Q&A sessions about the main themes of the festival.

Let the Courage Film Festival be the platform where you grab the world’s attention to champion your cause and raise awareness.

We're now also planting trees with Grow My Tree. Only our award winners receive certificates for the trees planted, but each and every submission contributes. Let's plant a greener world together!

Note: Our website is down at the moment - we are working on getting it back up as fast as possible!
