Although you might be the kind of person who watches every new movie that comes out, no matter the genre, there's just something about historical films. Knowing that a story actually happened — or is at least loosely based on something that happened — somehow makes it so much more intriguing and powerful. Whether you're into the opulent life of the English monarchy, courageous stories of soldiers during World War II, or accounts from everyday folks who witnessed major historical moments, movies based on history can offer a lot — romance, comedy, action, horror and sometimes a little bit of all four.

Whether you're looking for a history-based movie to watch with the kids or are just looking for something you haven't seen yet, our list of the best historical movies offers well-reviewed picks that cover everything from the reign of the ever-extravagant Marie Antoinette to The Boston Globe newspaper team who broke the Catholic Church abuse scandal. Some of these movies are definitely more serious than light-hearted, so make sure to take that into account if you're watching with young teens or children.
