        "text": "01 of 25\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (1940)\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, a flawed but determined man seeking a better life for his family after losing their farm in the Great Depression. Based on the seminal novel by John Steinbeck, this John Ford film is the tale of their difficult, eye-opening trek West to what they believe will be a happier, more comfortable existence.\n\nJoad and his family are palpably and consistently disheartened with what they see and experience on their travels, and the hollow dismay of false promises looms, but they combat it with grit, resilience, and hope. The black-and-white film is visually impressive, and strikingly exemplifies one of life's timeless realities: the inevitability of loss and the hope that awaits us on the journey to fulfill our dreams.\n\nWhere to rent The Grapes of Wrath: Amazon Prime Video\n\n02 of 25\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nIn this Frank Capra classic, Jimmy Stewart plays overwhelmed and overburdened family man George Bailey, who is resentful about all the dreams and opportunities that have passed him by over the years. He feels hopeless and pessimistic about his life, but, at his lowest point, a guardian angel arrives to show him how awful life would be for the people he loves — and for his beloved town — had he never existed.\n\nBailey's presence made a world of positive difference for everyone he would come to meet, and upon learning that truth, his perspective drastically shifts toward gratitude...because sometimes all we need is to know that we're valued. You'll feel the warm and fuzzies aplenty with It's a Wonderful Life, which has been a holiday season favorite for decades for its focus on faith, family, and belonging.\n\nWhere to watch It's a Wonderful Life: Amazon Prime Video\n\n03 of 25\n\nHigh Noon (1952)\n\nA daring and hard-headed former marshal (Gary Cooper) grapples with bullies, murderers, and the ever-complicated concept of responsibility in the classic Western drama High Noon. The marshal is preparing to leave his small New Mexico town in the dust, but when a criminal he turned in years ago is released from jail with a vengeance, the man of the law opts to stand his ground instead.\n\nThe story itself is simple — a clock tensely ticks down as the good guy attempts to rally the numbers (and the courage) to face the bad guys — but is told exquisitely by director Fred Zinnemann, who marries a high-strung plot with a man coming to terms with his morals. It serves as a reminder that even for the best of us, life isn't always as simple as right or wrong; most of our choices come from a stubborn, bittersweet conviction somewhere in between.\n\nWhere to watch High Noon: Hoopla\n\n04 of 25\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1962)\n\nIt might have been impossible for To Kill a Mockingbird to live up to the poignant, school-curriculum-staple novel it's based on, but this Robert Mulligan masterpiece rose to the challenge with grace. The blend of courtroom drama and coming-of-age story is rife with thematic messaging about racial injustice, gender roles, compassion, and loss of innocence.\n\nGregory Peck, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role, compassionately represents the friction between lawyer Atticus Finch's Southern roots and his moral values as he defends a Black man accused of raping a white woman in 1930s Alabama. His performance, and the film as a whole, serve as a heartwarming — and heartbreaking — example of what it means to be a good attorney, a good father, and a good human.\n\nWhere to rent To Kill a Mockingbird: Amazon Prime Video\n\n05 of 25\n\nRocky (1976)\n\nRocky is iconic not only for introducing the world to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa but for being one of the best sports movies. Directed by John G. Avildsen and written by its breakout star, the 1976 film is a classic David-and-Goliath tale: A small-time boxer with big dreams gets thrown into the ring opposite the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).\n\nRocky is timeless not only for its grit, but also for its heart, featuring legendary training montages and fight sequences as well as tender moments of romance and sportsmanship. It's also rife with crises of confidence; we see Rocky grapple with highs and lows in his own self-image as he learns how to trust his own talent. More than a run-of-the-mill sports story, Rocky is ultimately about a man who is taught to believe in himself on a journey that matters more than the destination.\n\nWhere to watch Rocky: Netflix\n\n06 of 25\n\nThe Color Purple (1985)\n\nAn adaptation of Alice Walker's classic novel, The Color Purple spans 40 years in the challenging existence of a Southern Black woman named Celie. Through all the seasons of her life, she quietly and resolutely weathers abuse, prejudice, and unfair treatment, and ultimately survives these through the strength of her friendships.\n\nThough Steven Spielberg — then known for action/fantasy flicks like Jaws, E.T., and Indiana Jones — may have initially been considered a curious choice to direct, he still adapted an emotionally unforgiving story with skill and grace. But the film's real tour de force is Whoopi Goldberg, who in her breakout role as Celie, touches audiences with a vulnerable and triumphant representation of a woman's enduring resilience in the face of trauma.\n\nWhere to rent The Color Purple: Amazon Prime Video\n\n07 of 25\n\nThelma & Louise (1991)\n\nWe're certainly not supposed to emulate Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon's law-breaking personas in the ever-poignant Thelma & Louise, but we are enthusiastically encouraged to admire them. In this offbeat road-trip movie by Ridley Scott, Davis and Sarandon play friends who tear off into the desert after finding themselves entangled in a complicated crime.\n\nWith law enforcement on their tail, the duo contends with fascinating characters (including a thoroughly rakish Brad Pitt), misogynistic biases, and their own impending fates. Saucily funny and tenderly heart-wrenching at once, it's an empathetic, bittersweet story about friendship, self-discovery, and love — for one another and for oneself.\n\nWhere to rent Thelma & Louise: Amazon Prime Video\n\n08 of 25\n\nA League of Their Own (1992)\n\nIt was definitely an inspirational few years for Geena Davis, who after her turn in Thelma & Louise starred in this female-centric sports drama from Penny Marshall. Set primarily during World War II, A League of Their Own follows a ragtag female baseball team led by Davis and coached by an ever-endearing Tom Hanks.\n\nWhat distinguishes it from other sports films is its bittersweet tug-of-war between the societal expectations of women (marriage, family, supporting a husband) and the realities of their true potential (independence, ambition, athletic talent). It reminds us that sometimes women make the unexpected choice — and that it's the ability to choose that matters.\n\nWhere to watch A League of Their Own: Netflix\n\n09 of 25\n\nCool Runnings (1993)\n\nOn the heels of Marshall's bittersweet, poetic A League of Their Own comes an entirely different brand of sports film. In Cool Runnings, a professional sprinter from Jamaica just misses the cut for the 1988 Summer Olympic qualifiers, thus setting his sights on the Winter Olympics instead. He throws together a motley crew of men as a makeshift bobsled team despite complete unfamiliarity with snow, ice, or anything remotely related to the sport.\n\nTheir ray of hope comes with convincing a reluctant former bobsled-medalist (a luminous John Candy in what would be one of his last films before his untimely passing) to train them, and obligatory hijinks, setbacks, and triumphs ensue. Loosely based on a true story, and with a proud focus on national pride, Jon Turteltaub's film is light, fun, and cheesy — but in the kind of way that just might make you choke up through your smile.\n\nWhere to watch Cool Runnings: Disney+\n\n10 of 25\n\nRudy (1993)\n\nA determined fish-out-of-water refuses to take no for an answer in Rudy, David Anspaugh's drama about a young man with a lofty dream and an impressive tenacity to pursue it. Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger Jr. (Sean Astin) wants nothing more than to play football for the University of Notre Dame, but he doesn't have the grades for an academic scholarship or the stamina for an athletic scholarship — and his family certainly can't pony up the money for tuition.\n\nLike all good underdog stories, it's sentimental and a bit formulaic, but that doesn't affect the genuine pride elicited from watching Rudy tackle (no pun intended) setback after setback. Astin's performance as Rudy is part of what makes the film so memorable; he's grounded and natural enough a performer that the plot's more predictable elements come off as fresh and unexpected. Every viewer can relate to elements of Rudy in some way or another — so much so that by the climactic, triumphant end, it'll be next to impossible to find a dry eye in the house.\n\nWhere to watch Rudy: Paramount+\n\n11 of 25\n\nForrest Gump (1994)\n\nArguably one of the most obvious candidates for this list, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump is the very definition of an inspirational film in more ways than one. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is pitied for his low IQ by many of his town's denizens, but he has never considered himself lacking in any way.\n\nWith a good heart and almost painfully earnest innocence, he lives an extraordinary — and borderline fantastical — life that overlaps with some of the most significant events of the 20th century, including college football stardom during the Civil Rights movement, earning a Medal of Honor in Vietnam, training as a world-famous ping-pong champion, and running across the country. But, despite his many accomplishments, it's love that's at the center of Forrest's journey, and it's his affection for his mother (Sally Field) and his childhood love Jenny (Robin Wright) that propels him forward.\n\nWhere to rent Forrest Gump: Amazon Prime Video\n\n12 of 25\n\nOctober Sky (1999)\n\nOctober Sky follows a rural teenage boy named Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who decides his destiny is not to follow in his father's footsteps and become a miner, but instead to build homemade rockets in his backyard. Naturally, his father (Chris Cooper) disapproves of his son's ambitions, but a kind schoolteacher (Laura Dern) encourages his passion.\n\nHomer's awe-inspiring engineering feats and his struggles to break free of his town's expectations are director Joe Johnston's main focuses. But the most interesting tension is Homer's struggle for his father's respect, proving that by breaking out of his shell, he is becoming exactly the kind of person of which his old man would be proud.\n\nWhere to rent October Sky: Amazon Prime Video\n\n13 of 25\n\nErin Brockovich (2000)\n\nJulia Roberts is a joy to watch in just about everything she does, and Erin Brockovich is no exception. As the title character, she is an unemployed single mother who begs Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the attorney she'd been working with following a car accident, to hire her for a secretarial position at his firm. When she stumbles upon a potential story, she convinces Ed to let her investigate, unearthing a massive criminal cover-up involving a power company and a mysterious illness in a local community.\n\nThough the story, which is based on Brockovich's real life, is fascinating on its own accord, Roberts — who won an Oscar for her performance — is the true soul of Steven Soderbergh's movie, portraying Erin with equal parts warmth and tenacity.\n\nWhere to rent Erin Brockovich: Amazon Prime Video\n\n14 of 25\n\nLegally Blonde (2001)\n\nIt's unlikely anyone knew at the time of its release just how much of a success Legally Blonde would become. This oft-quoted flick from Robert Luketic follows pink-clad sorority sister Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) as she applies (and gets accepted) to Harvard Law School — not because she wants to be a lawyer, but because she wants to prove her intelligence and ambition to her ex-boyfriend (Matthew Davis), who dumped her for not being \"serious\" enough.\n\nHer genuine passion for law progresses as the film does, amidst iconic one-liners (\"What, like it's hard?\") and richly saturated pinks contrasting with Cambridge's drab grayscale. The film's message is obvious — don't judge a book by its cover — but it's told so endearingly by Witherspoon and the rest of the cast that it's a satisfying payoff nonetheless.\n\nWhere to watch Legally Blonde: Amazon Prime Video\n\n15 of 25\n\nBend It Like Beckham (2002)\n\nThis coming-of-age soccer movie (or rather football in England, where it's set) catapulted Keira Knightley to movie star status, but it's Bend It Like Beckham's cultural perspective and commentary that truly make it special. The story follows Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), a teen girl obsessed with soccer (and with David Beckham, who gave the film permission to use his name because he wanted to promote girls' soccer).\n\nFeeling suffocated by her strict Indian parents and their hope that she'll someday become a homemaker and devoted wife, Jess secretly joins a soccer team and must juggle responsibilities for both her family and her coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). The film resonates with anyone who knows the acute angst of pretending, around those they love, to be someone they're not. The result is director Gurinder Chadha's supremely watchable sports film about gender, culture, sexuality, diversity, and love — and it's a touching one to boot.\n\nWhere to watch Bend It Like Beckham: Disney+\n\n16 of 25\n\nWhale Rider (2003)\n\nWhale Rider was one of the early-2000s' most gorgeous films, both visually and sentimentally. Set in New Zealand, director Niki Caro tells the story of Pai, a young tween who desperately wants to prove that she is capable of anything and everything the boys are (played expertly by Keisha Castle-Hughes, who, at 13, became one of the youngest Best Actress Oscar nominees ever).\n\nRaised by her traditional grandparents, and next in line for chiefdom in her Māori village, Pai's grandfather is entirely opposed to the idea of her being in charge, reminding her frequently that she is \"only\" a girl. She spends the film aching for his approval and trying to prove him wrong, turning to the sea to prove her might. It's an unpredictable and awe-inspiring ride — and it's one of the most moving films on this list.\n\nWhere to rent Whale Rider: Amazon Prime Video\n\n17 of 25\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, gives new meaning to \"dark comedy\" with an excellent script from Michael Arndt and an astounding ensemble cast — Greg Kinnear! Toni Collette! Steve Carell! Paul Dano! Alan Arkin! It follows the mostly melancholy members of a dysfunctional family as they road trip across the United States to take 9-year-old Olive (an adorable Abigail Breslin, who was also Oscar-nominated) to compete in a beauty pageant.\n\nEqually peppered with absurdly funny moments and genuine instances of rage and grief, the film doles out reckonings to each of its cynical adults and also to naïve, optimistic Olive, who realizes only once she arrives at the competition that she may not, in fact, be the stereotypical definition of a beauty queen. The outpouring (and outrageous) support from her family that follows might inspire tears, but their rendition of Rick James' \"Superfreak\" is all smiles all the way.\n\nWhere to watch Little Miss Sunshine: Max\n\n18 of 25\n\nMilk (2008)\n\nSean Penn is at his very best in Milk, a drama by Gus Van Sant about the true story of Harvey Milk, who, in the 1970s, became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the United States. At age 40 and a researcher at a securities firm, a not out Milk becomes dissatisfied with his life and decided to move to San Francisco with his lover. Distressed and angry about the systemic persecution of the homosexual population, Milk evolved into a fixture for gay rights in the city.\n\nHe campaigns, he gives a speech, and is eventually elected into a seat on the Board of Supervisors — until a tragic turn of events changes everything. Penn portrays a deeply human man — kind, auspicious, flawed — whose impact on the LGBTQIA+ community can't be understated, and who serves as a reminder of the positive impact an everyday person can achieve.\n\nWhere to watch Milk: Max\n\n19 of 25\n\nThe Intouchables (2011)\n\nThe Intouchables, directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, was the template for 2019's The Upside, but whether or not you've seen its buzzy successor, the original is well worth a watch. Lupin's Omar Sy plays Driss, a thief out on parole who accidentally stumbles into a job as the caretaker for Philippe (François Cluzet), who is paralyzed.\n\nThe two men couldn't be more dissimilar: Philippe is an older white man and Driss is a youthful Black man, but beyond that, the two men come from vastly different economic backgrounds and have lived very different lives. Their outlooks, their opinions, and their priorities are completely misaligned...until they're not. Uproariously funny and gently vulnerable, with natural, multilayered performances from its leads, this French-language box office hit is as uplifting as they come.\n\nWhere to watch The Intouchables: Hoopla\n\n20 of 25\n\nWild (2014)\n\nIn Wild, a young woman named Cheryl Strayed spirals into self-destruction after the death of her mother, and decides — without any deep thought or former hiking experience — to trek the 1,000+ mile Pacific Crest Trail. There, she weathers wild animals, predatory men, and dwindling supplies as we see through flashbacks the moments of grief and trauma that led her to begin the journey.\n\nWhat makes Wild — directed by Jean-Marc Vallée — special is that, while it's based on a memoir, it's not a sweeping tale of redemption or success. Cheryl doesn't finish the film feeling healed or at peace; rather, she has undergone an extraordinary physical feat while having an emotional and spiritual reckoning with herself and her place in the world. The movie is beautiful in that it refuses, like our own lives sometimes do, to tie up all the loose ends neatly in a bow.\n\nWhere to watch Wild: Max\n\n21 of 25\n\nSelma (2014)\n\nSelma is not quite inspiring in a feel-good way; it's inspiring in its call to action. Directed by Ava DuVernay, the film follows Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) and his followers on their epic march from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama protesting racial discrimination. Black people in the South were having a very difficult time registering to vote, despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 implementing legal desegregation. So, in 1965, King took matters into his own hands.\n\nWhile it chronicles events from nearly 60 years prior, DuVernay takes specific care to remind audiences that things are not so different now from how they were then. The film doesn't try to minimize the terror and the powerlessness of that time period for the comfort of its audiences, instead offering a poignant warning about history's tendency to repeat itself. Given that uneasy reminder, the small victory ultimately won by King and his followers is even more extraordinary and powerful to behold.\n\nWhere to watch Selma: Paramount+\n\n22 of 25\n\nLion (2016)\n\nStunning visuals and intense emotions are two of the many elements that characterize Garth Davis' Lion, which follows a disadvantaged 5-year-old named Saroo (precious breakout star Sunny Pawar) who gets lost on his train in his native India, and, 25 years later, now living in Australia, tries to find his way back home. The story throws young Saroo into incredible circumstance after incredible circumstance — so much so that it's almost hard to remember it's based on true events — until he ends up as Nicole Kidman and David Wenham's characters' adopted son.\n\nAs an adult, Saroo (Dev Patel) finds himself desperate to return to his birthplace, but has to delve deep into his memory to garner clues about where he spent his early childhood. The cast, with emotionally devastating performances, deftly manage themes like identity crisis and adoption, and the powerful resolution at the end (including footage of real-life Saroo) is one of the most satisfying payoffs of any film on this list.\n\nWhere to watch Lion: Freevee\n\n23 of 25\n\nHidden Figures (2016)\n\nHidden Figures is astonishing not just for the storytelling by its actors and director Theodore Melfi, but also for the true story at its core. It's about three Black women — Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson — who are the NASA mathematicians behind John Glenn's launch into space in 1962. Amid skepticism, derision, sexism, and racism from all sides (NASA was notoriously a boys' club, and a very white one, at that) they keep their heads level and eyes up to the skies.\n\nHeartfelt, convincing performances by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe give the film's audience an investment in their outcomes, both professionally and personally. Hidden Figures' inspirational intent is clear and strong, reminding us of the brilliance of Black women that history had otherwise overlooked.\n\nWhere to watch Hidden Figures: Disney+\n\n24 of 25\n\nCODA (2021)\n\nThis Academy Award winner for Best Picture is one of a kind. CODA's dialogue is delivered, for the most part, in American Sign Language (ASL), and three of its lead actors — Troy Kotsur, Marlee Matlin, and Daniel Durant — are deaf. The fourth, Emilia Jones, plays Ruby, the one hearing member of the Rossi family. She works mornings to help with the family fishing business, but finds her passion for singing when she joins her high school choir, leaving her torn between family and personal ambitions. It's a common coming-of-age theme, but what's uncommon is the unique perspective the film gives us.\n\nThis feel-good movie was an awards season darling, and it's easy to see why: Director Sian Heder works hard to tell a story that's rarely been told. Ruby's family can't hear her talent, at least not in the traditional way. But as Heder lets us watch her through their eyes, we realize it's entirely possible to \"hear\" without sound.\n\nWhere to watch CODA: Apple TV+\n\n25 of 25\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once (2022)\n\nSpeaking of Best Picture winners, Everything Everywhere All at Once, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, a.k.a. the Daniels, is a delight that needs to be seen to be believed. It begins fairly innocuously with a Chinese immigrant named Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), who runs a Californian laundromat and is dealing with stressors galore, including her father's visit, her impending tax audit, the state of her marriage, and her daughter's sullen attitude. Her anxiety is palpable and disappoints her husband (Ke Huy Quan) and her daughter (Stephanie Hsu), who try and fail to get their needs met by Evelyn. Before long, there's a glitch in Evelyn's reality, an interdimensional rupture, wherein Evelyn encounters alternate versions of her family members who require a degree of heroism from her that she didn't think she had in herself.\n\nThe technical aspects here are astounding — from the editing to the mind-blowing action sequences and performances — but the film's emotional insistence on cherishing our lives and our loved ones is what will really strum your heartstrings. There is so much beautiful chaos in this movie that it necessitates more than one watch, and you might just be gaping the entire way through.\n\nWhere to watch Everything Everywhere All at Once: Paramount+"
