A+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nStation Eleven is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nâTwenty years after the end of air travel, the caravans of the Travelling Symphony moved slowly under a white-hot sky.â\n\nWhen you think about post-apocalyptic science fiction stories, what kind of thing comes to mind first? Maybe an alien invasion, Pacific Rim style monsters perhaps, and almost always the mad scramble of a protagonist to stockpile resources and protect their loved ones from the imminent chaos and destructionâthese are tropes which are tried and tested in this genre.\n\nWhat mightnât come to mind as immediately is a story about a travelling Shakespeare troupe wandering the North American continent decades after the actual apocalypse has struck, which is exactly the story that Mandel tells in Station Eleven.\n\nWhile post-apocalyptic tales tend to focus on the action around the impact of a fictional disaster, Mandelâs novel speaks to the attitudes and characteristics of people which drive any action that occurs. She interrogates central questions about human society, inviting readers to consider what human qualities can endure even an apocalypse, what qualities are timeless.\n\nCharacters\n\nA tale of two timelines: part one\n\nââ¦once weâre seen, thatâs not enough anymore. After that, we want to be remembered.â\n\nPart of the novelâs ambition is that while itâs set 20 years after the apocalyptic Georgia Flu, it constantly reaches decades into the past to search for meaning. In particular, the novelâs central character is Arthur Leander, an actor whose death coincides with the breakout of the Flu. Tracing his origins from obscurity to fame, Mandel juxtaposes his philandering and untrustworthy behaviour with repeated attempts to be a better person, or perhaps just be more true to himself, before his death. Weâll eventually see that many of his actions have consequences years into the future.\n\nArguably equally important in legacy is his first wife, Miranda Carroll, whose comics lend the novel its title. Take this with a grain of saltâsheâs kind of my favourite characterâbut the time and energy she invests in the Station Eleven comics are arguably the most valuable investment of the novel. Her comics survive her in the years following the Flu, and are a source of escape and purpose for others just as they had been for herself.\n\nBoth of these characters come into contact with Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo and journalist who regularly follows Arthur though his career, photographing Miranda in a vulnerable moment before her divorce, and booking an interview with Arthur years later as he plans to leave his second wife Elizabeth Colton. We see Jeevan struggle with his purpose in life throughout the novel, though it can be said that he ultimately finds it after the Flu, when he is working as a medic.\n\nFinally, thereâs Clark Thompson, Arthurâs friend from college who remains loyal, though not necessarily uncritical, of him all throughout his life. As the Flu first arrives in America, Clark is just leaving for Toronto, but a Flu outbreak there causes his flight to be redirected to Severn City Airport, where he and others miraculously survive in what will become a key setting of the novel.\n\nA tale of two timelines: part two\n\nââI stood looking over my damaged home and tried to forget the sweetness of life on Earth.â\n\nAll of this finally puts us in a position to think analytically about characters in the âpresentâ timeline, that is, 20 years after the Flu. We experience the present mostly through the perspective of Kirsten Raymonde, a performer who survived the Flu as a young child. Because she was so young when it happened, many of the traumas she experienced have been erased by her mind, and she struggles to piece together what she lost in a quest for identity and meaning, largely driven by her vague memories of Arthur. She travels with the Travelling Symphony with others such as Alexandra, August and the conductorâthey have collectively adopted the motto, âsurvival is insufficient.â\n\nThrough the story, they are pursued by the prophet, later revealed to be Tyler Leander, the child of Arthur and Elizabeth who survived and grew up in the decades following the Flu outbreak. A religious extremist, he becomes the leader of a cult of fanatics who amass weapons and conquer towns by force. Both Kirsten and Tyler pursue the Station Eleven comics, quoted aboveâthey each possess a copy, and resonate strongly with the struggles of the characters created by Miranda.\n\n(CW: suicide) Also important is Jeevanâs brother, Frank, a paraplegic author who was writing about a philanthropist in the last days before his death, whereby he kills himself so as to give his brother a better chance of surviving. While he isnât a particularly major character, his writing on morality and mortality (quoted with the first batch of characters) are symbolically and thematically important.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\nThemes\n\nPart 1\n\nâThatâs what passes for a lifeâ¦thatâs what passes for happiness, for most peopleâ¦theyâre like sleepwalkersâ¦â\n\nThese characters already speak to some of the major themes that formulate the novel. On one hand, Mandel explores various meanings of contemporary or modern civilisation. We live in a technology-driven age where constraints of time and space mean less than ever before. For example, people are mobile through space thanks to airplanes and telephones, and the internet means that any and all information is available to anyone, all the time. Mandel constantly looks back at this society and describes it in terms of our technology: for example, âthe era when it was possible to press a series of buttons on a telephone and speak with someone on the far side of the earth.â On one level, she comments on how many of these minor miracles are taken for granted in our every day lives.\n\nOn another level, these elements of society also give rise to the culture of celebrity in our lives, as high-profile figures are put under increasing pressure to maintain appearances at all times, and lead increasingly âperfectâ lives as a result. These were pressures that Arthur struggled to live up to, and his âfailed marriagesâ accompanied his career at all stages. The flip side of this is that people who follow celebrities, such as Jeevan, lead increasingly emptier and more vacuous livesâand Jeevan is well-aware of this, telling Miranda that he doesnât seek a greater purpose in life beyond making money. This lack of purpose, this ennui, is something that tints much of society through the eyes of Mandel.\n\nAnother major theme which the lives of these characters start to explore is the value of art as a source of purpose. While civilisation is portrayed as fragile and meaningless, artâin all its forms, including creating, reproducing, performing and consumingâis a way for people such as Miranda to understand, process and escape their lives. This theme is arguably the most important, as it tethers different parts of the novel together; even after the apocalypse, people turn to art as a way of understanding and connecting to others as well as to themselves.\n\nPart 2\n\nââThe more you remember, the more youâve lost.â\n\nInevitably with this genre, survival and mortality are major themes, as massive populations of people have died and continue to die due to the impacts of the Georgia Flu. To some extent, survivorâs guilt motivates many to search for a deeper meaning to their survival, hence the motto of the Symphony. It also drives them to turn to art as weâve explored, since bare subsistence isnât enough to give their lives the meaning they desire. Maybe this is what it means to be human.\n\nOn the other hand, the Flu also turns others to religious extremity, as is the case with Elizabeth, Tyler and the rest of their cult. This speaks to broader ideas about faith, fate and spiritualityâare there greater forces out there who manipulate events in our world? Certainly, there are enough coincidences in the novel for this theory to be valid; even just Kirsten and Tyler both having copies of Station Eleven and both acting under the influence of Arthur is so coincidental.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most important theme here is memory. Mandel ultimately puts this as the central question to readers: is memory more of a blessing or a burden? Is it preferable to remember everything youâve lost, or be ignorant of it all? Iâm not sure she really answers this one, to be honest. Various symbolsâand even the constantly shifting narrative perspectiveâevoke the epic sense of loss in the apocalypse, and yet encountering characters like Alexandra, who never really knew what the internet was, makes you rethink that loss; perhaps it is better to have experienced the internet at all.\n\nSymbols\n\nââPeople want what was best about the worldâ\n\nThereâs a category of symbols in the novel that represent memories of technology. Consider the discarded phones and credit cards in the Museum of Civilisations, all mementos of what the world lost. Note that, given Mandelâs ambivalent commentary about modern society, not all that was lost is badâthe credit card embodies the materialism and consumerism that drive our world today, and shedding it may be construed as a form of liberty, in fact.\n\nIt is airplanes, however, that serve as the greatest reminder. Their sudden disappearance from the sky becomes a constant reminder of how the world changed, and people still look up in the hopes of seeing an airborne plane; they cling onto the hope that maybe, just maybe, all of this can somehow be reversed. The last flights of the human raceâpilots attempting to return home to be with their loved onesâare also made in hope, though their outcomes are consistently unclear.\n\nIn this sense, airplanes can also be seen as a source of fading hope, or rather, despair. For one, it was the very mobility afforded by planes which caused the Flu to spread around the world so rapidly. Now, confined to the ground forever, they represent the immobility of humans in the present. They also take on meanings of death, and in particular, the final airplane that landed at Severn City Airport, quarantined with people still on board, represents the difficult decisions that have to be made in order to survive. The mausoleum plane also pushes Tyler further into religious extremism, as he reads the bible to the now-artefact in an attempt to justify the deaths of everyone on board.\n\nThese symbols highlight the jarring difference between the world before and after the Flu, but on the other hand, there are also symbols which connect the two worlds; the importance of print cannot be underemphasised here. Anything that was printedâphotographs, comics, TV guides, booksâare all enduring sources of knowledge and comfort for Flu survivors, and basically become the only way for children born after the Flu to remember our world, a world that they never actually lived in.\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\nThe following essay topics are extracted from our Station Eleven Study Guide: A Killer Text Guide:\n\nâFirst, we only want to be seen, but once weâre seen, thatâs not enough anymore.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nHave a watch of this video to see how we broke down an essay topic:\n\n[Video Transcript]\n\nAlthough this is something that might be a little more text-specific, the main takeaway of todayâs video is to be flexible in how you mentally arrange a textâs plot. This is especially handy in stories that are non-linear, so stories that flip between perspectives or timelines, as this one does. Being across a text like this will give you greater flexibility in putting together your ideas. I think this might be clearer if I just show you!\n\nIn the meantime though, letâs have a bit of a chat about the text.\n\nStation Eleven is Emily St John Mandelâs take on the tried-and-tested sub-genre of post-apocalyptic science fiction. Only, her attempt doesnât actually explore new forms of technology, nor the immediate action-packed grab-and-dash that we normally associate with an apocalypse. Instead, she takes us two decades down the track to look at how human society has changed as a result. She also highlights some elements of society that are eternal and timeless, that survive and persevere no matter what.\n\nTodayâs topic is:\n\nDespite his virtues, Arthur Leander is essentially a bad man. Do you agree?\n\nIf youâre familiar with what we do at LSG, you might be familiar with our Five Types strategy. Basically, itâs a method for students to group categorise prompts into types, and by doing so, you get an immediate idea of how to approach an essay question and some things that you must include, along with things you mustnât.\n\nAnd out of the 5 types, this prompt is character-based, through and through. It poses us the difficult task of deciphering the ethics and morality of an individual in the text. Immediately, if you write on this prompt, you must know Arthur pretty damn well! It pays to be strategic â if you donât know Arthur all that in a SAC or exam, pick another question if possible.\n\nThe key words in this one are fairly self-explanatory. Youâve got âvirtuesâ on the one hand, which basically refers to being good or having good morals, and âbad manâ on the other. Whatâs important is how we define them in the context of the essay, so we need to consider the ways in which Arthur is both virtuous and bad and make sure these are clear in our intro.\n\nAlso, the prompt is suggesting that Arthur Leander is âbadâ at his core, because of the word âessentially.â This is the part where thereâs a little bit of room to challenge, since there is a lot of evidence that might suggest he isnât all bad.\n\nBefore we dive into the plan, you might want to pause here for a minute and write down what you find to be Arthurâs top two virtues and worst two flaws. Go on, do it!\n\nFor me, I think that heâs ambitious and determined in his career, and he can be kind to others in his personal life. However, he also has a philandering or womanising side, and can be neglectful of his family and friends. I would also consider whether or not his legacy was favourable, unflattering, or mixed. Did he leave behind more positivity in the world, or less, when he died?\n\nLetâs arrange this into paragraphs.\n\nParagraph one\n\nArthur is flawed in the way he treats others, manifested in his inconsiderate actions, misogynistic tendencies and raising of Tyler.\n\nI think itâd be hard to argue that Arthur is a flawless character whom it would be unfair to call âbad.â We know that Arthur was unfaithful, and many saw his life as being âsummed up in a series of failed marriages.â We know that he treats women as interchangeable objects rather than as people, not only his wives but also his childhood friend Victoria. We also know that he neglects his children, missing Tylerâs birthday for work, as well as his friends, with his increasingly disingenuous and strained relationship with Clark.\n\nIn terms of mentally rearranging elements of the story, it might be worth noting here how his bad traits manifested in his son, Tyler. Making a connection between these two timelines may help us realise that in many ways, Tyler is just a more perverse version of his fatherâhe too treats women like possessions, and doesnât really have a family so much as a community of followers.\n\nParagraph two\n\nArguably, Arthurâs selfish traits stem from his Hollywood fame, career and lifestyle.\n\nFundamentally, he was never this flaky, unreliable person before he was swept away by fame. From a young age, he was determined that he was âgoing to be an actor andâ¦going to be good,â and the drive with which he pursues this career is undoubtedly virtuous and admirable. Along the way, he offers Miranda a way out of her abusive and one-sided relationship, validating her own âpursuit of happiness.â\n\nSo looking at the âbookendsâ of Arthurâs life, it can be argued that heâs actually essentially a good person. Before Hollywood taints him, and after he realises how much he has been tainted, Arthur does actually demonstrate a lot of virtue.\n\nParagraph three\n\nHowever, overall, Arthur leaves behind a positive legacy that reflects that despite his shortcomings, he is fundamentally a good man who has been tainted by immoral habits and attitudes.\n\nHere, the discussion surrounds Arthurâs legacyâis he remembered as a good person? In what ways does Arthur live on? The photographs that Kirsten finds along her journey depict Arthur shielding Miranda from the paparazzi and spending time with his son, and these are lasting memories of his virtues which havenât been destroyed by the Flu. Consider also the âwhispersâ and âglancesâ that plagued him during his life, and we canât help but wonder what kind of man he wouldâve been in a world with less people and less scrutiny.\n\nAnd there you have it! Hopefully, you can see what I meant at the start about rearranging bits of the book. For example, these photographs belong in Kirstenâs timeline and are discovered through her point of view, but there isnât any reason why you canât connect them to elements of Arthurâs character more broadly. Also, even just by looking at the start and end of Arthurâs life without the middle changes how we interpret him as a character.

Summary\n\nYear of Wonders is set in the small English village of Eyam in 1665, as the town struggles through a deadly outbreak of the bubonic plague. While the characters and events are fictional, author Geraldine Brooks based the novel on the true story of Eyam, whose inhabitants, at the urging of their vicar, courageously decided to quarantine themselves to restrict the spread of the contagion and protect other rural townships.Â\n\nThe experience of the plague provides Brooks fertile ground to develop characters that illustrate the extremes of human nature; displaying the dignity or depravity, self-sacrifice or self-interest that people are capable of when faced with terror, pain and the unknown. She explores the consequences of a catastrophe on an isolated, insular and deeply religious community and we see characters exhibit tireless dedication and heroism, or succumb to depression, exploitation and sometimes murderous depravity.Â\n\nThe novel illustrates that adversity can bring out the best and worst of people and that faith can be challenged and eroded. The novel explores how crises affect human behaviour, beliefs and values and reveal the real character of a community under pressure. Our job while studying this text is to consider how all the different responses to an external crisis contribute to an analysis of human nature.Â\n\n2. Historical Context\n\nYear of Wonders belongs to the genre of historical fiction (meaning it is fictional but based on historical events) and aims to capture and present the historical context accurately. The context of Year of Wonders is important to understand as it informs a lot of the division and instability in Eyam during the isolation and crisis of the plague (we explain in more detail why context is so important in Context and Authorial Intent in VCE English).Â\n\nIn 1658, only 7 years before the novel opens, Puritan statesmen Oliver Cromwell (who defeated King Charles I in the English Civil War and ruled as Lord Protector of the British Isles from 1653) died and Charles II, heir to the throne, returned from exile to rule England as King. Charles II replaced Cromwellâs rigid puritanism with the more relaxed Anglicanism and his reign began the dynamic period known as the Restoration. During the civil war and Cromwellâs rule, all the past certainties â the monarchy and the Church â had been repeatedly challenged and overturned. This all happened during the lifetime of the Eyam villagers presented in the novel and the recent religious upheaval in Britain was beginning to influence the conservative and puritan congregation of Eyam as the old puritan rector was replaced with Anglican vicar Michael Mompellion. The tension between the puritans and Anglicans is evident early in the novel and is exacerbated by the arrival of the plague, causing further internal fission.Â Â\n\nThe 17th century also marked the beginning of modern medicine and the Age of Enlightenment. During the Enlightenment, people began to privilege reason and sensory evidence from the material world over biblical orthodoxy as the primary sources of knowledge. The Enlightenment advanced ideals such as progress, liberty, tolerance, egalitarianism and the scientific method. These values are reflected in the liberal characters of Anna, Elinor, Mem and Anys Gowdie, and to an extent, Michael Mompellion. However, we also see the limited reaches of the Enlightenment in characters who succumb to superstition or self-flagellation when the plague arrives. This was a time when religious faith was frequently challenged and redefined.Â\n\n3. Character Analysis\n\nAnna Frith\n\nThe novel is narrated in the first person by protagonist Anna Frith. Anna, a young widow, mother and housemaid, becomes the townâs nurse and midwife during the plague alongside her employer and friend Elinor Mompellion. Anna is a compelling protagonist and narrator because she is part of the ordinary, working-class life of the village, but also has access to the gentry in her work for the Mompellions, meaning readers can see how the plague affected all social groups.Â\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Anna is in many ways very conventional. Aside from her intelligence and desire to learn, evidenced by her interest and quick proficiency in learning to read, Anna married young, is a dedicated mother, had an incomplete education and never thought to question the townâs orthodox religious beliefs. However, it is revealed early that she has progressive views on class and morality and as the novel progresses, the extraordinary circumstances of the plague evoke in her heroism and courage. Brooks notes, Anna 'shrugs off the social and religious mores that would keep a weaker woman in her place'. During the plague, Anna becomes the villageâs voice of reason and an indispensable figure due to her expanding medical knowledge, tenacity, resourcefulness and tireless generosity.Â\n\nMichael Mompellion\n\nMichael Mompellion is Eyamâs Anglican preacher, having been appointed three years earlier after Charles II returned to England and replaced Puritan clergies. Generally, Mompellion is altruistic and open-minded: softening strict class divisions, combatting superstition and embracing a scientific approach to the plague. When the plague arrives, the local gentry (the Bradfords) flee and due to his charisma and position in the Church, he becomes the townâs unofficial leader. Mompellion persuades the townspeople to go into self-imposed quarantine to prevent the spread of the plague. His personal charisma, powerful rhetoric and indefatigable dedication to his work mean he can motivate and inspire his parishioners.Â Â\n\nMompellionâs unwavering commitment to his beliefs makes him a good leader, but we also see that his single-minded religious zeal can lead to harsh irrationality and hypocrisy. While progressive on issues such as class divisions, Mompellion is conservative â bordering on fanatic â when it comes to female sexuality. When his beloved wife Elinor dies, it is revealed that Mompellion denied her sexual intimacy for their entire marriage to punish her for the premarital affair and abortion she had as a teenager. Mompellion realises upon Elinorâs death that he extended forgiveness and understanding to all but his wife and, recognising his own hypocrisy and cruelty, he suffers a breakdown and loses much of his religious faith. Through Annaâs eyes, we see Mompellion shift from a character of moral infallibility, to a flawed and inconsistent man of a more ambiguous character.Â\n\nElinor Mompellion\n\nElinor is Mompellionâs wife and Annaâs employer and teacher. By the end of the novel, Anna and Elinor are confidantes and friends and their friendship arguably forms one of the strongest emotional cores of the novel, sustaining both women through enormous strain and hardship. Elinor teaches Anna to read and seems not to notice or care about their different social strata, treating everyone equally. Elinor came from a very wealthy family and initially had little practical knowledge of the hardships and necessities of life. During the plague, she confronts pain, suffering and true sacrifice. Because of her beauty, fragility and generosity, the whole town â and especially Anna â view her as a paragon of virtue and the embodiment of innocence. However, Elinor reveals that as a teenager she had a premarital relationship that resulted in an illegitimate pregnancy which she ended through abortion. Elinor considers herself to be permanently marked by sin and is plagued by the guilt of her adolescent mistakes, but her commitment to atone through service and working to help others is admirable.Â\n\nAnys and Mem Gowdie\n\nAnys and her aunt Mem are the townâs healers and midwives. Both women live on the margins of society, as their knowledge of herbal medicines and power to heal certain ailments causes fear and suspicion. Additionally, Anys further alienates the villagers by having conspicuous affairs with married village men. Anna admires Anysâ herbal knowledge and healing skill and her autonomy and unashamed sexuality, which were rare for women at the time. When the plague breaks out, Anys and Mem are murdered by a mob of hysterical townspeople, who believe they are witches responsible for the plague. This episode shows the power and acute danger of superstition and hysteria.Â\n\nJosiah and Aphra Bont\n\nJosiah 'Joss' Bont is Annaâs estranged father and Aphra is Annaâs stepmother. Brooks depicts them as unsympathetic and unforgivable, if understandable, villains as they both seek to profit off the heavy misfortune of others. Joss abused Anna greatly throughout her childhood, and while she manages to forgive him due to the suffering of his own youth, when he cruelly exploits villagers in his position as gravedigger, Anna finds his actions irredeemable. As gravedigger, Joss charged exorbitant fees from desperate people to bury their dead, regularly stole from the beleaguered families and attempted to bury a wealthy plague sufferer alive to loot his home.Â\n\nAphra is similarly amoral and greedy. Although her love for her children is shown to be strong, she capitalises on the fear and superstition of her neighbours by selling fake charms while pretending to be Anys Gowdieâs ghost. After the death of her husband and children, Aphra becomes completely deranged, dismembering and refusing to bury the rotting corpses of her children and eventually murdering Elinor. Aphraâs fate and actions show how prolonged catastrophe and suffering can totally erode an individualâs sanity.Â\n\nThe Bradford Family\n\nThe Bradford family are arrogant and pretentious. When the plague arrived in Eyam they also proved themselves self-serving and opportunistic, exploiting their wealth and status as part of the gentry to flee Eyam instead of enduring the quarantine with the rest of the village. They provide a foil to the Mompellions, who are of similar status and are newcomers to Eyam with fewer historical ties and thus expectations of loyalty. The two upper-class families provide directly opposite responses to the crisis, with Brooks clearly condemning the cowardice and selfishness exhibited by the Bradfords.Â\n\n4. Themes\n\nSocial Convention and Human Nature in a Crisis\n\nPerhaps the most significant theme or exploration of the novel is what happens to an individualâs character and community norms in a crisis. Year of Wonders depicts a small and isolated community that experiences intense adversity from the plague and, because of their self-imposed quarantine, are additionally isolated from the stabilising forces of broader society. These factors cause the people of Eyam to increasingly abandon their social conventions and descend into chaos and Brooks raises the question of whether people can live harmoniously without a strong social code. She suggests that societal cohesion is the result of social pressure rather than innate to our nature. The social norms and protocols of Eyam collapse under the pressure of the plague, allowing discerning observers like Anna to explore the validity and value of her societyâs fundamental values. Eyamâs experience of the plague demonstrates that some norms, like the limited role of women and the strict class divisions, do not need to be so repressive, while other norms and social virtues, like the rule of law and justice, are proved even more essential for their absence as order and civility disintegrate.Â\n\nBrooks also explores the response of individuals to extreme and enduring adversity and questions whether crises reveal someoneâs true nature or instead force them to act out of character.Â\n\nAnna and Elinor are examples of characters who respond to the crisis of the plague, amongst other real hardships, with a steadfast commitment to their principles. Their innate charity and work ethic are only strengthened and bolstered by the demands of the plague. However, not all residents of Eyam respond to the plague with courage and decency. Many descend into fear and hysteria, while others become malevolent and exploitative in their efforts to protect themselves. The Bonts and the Bradfords are examples of people who act with appalling selfishness, yet Brooks is careful to illustrate them as cruel and self-serving even before the plague. Thus, Brooks appears to argue that our actions under intense duress are intensifications of our true nature.Â\n\nFaith, Suffering and ScienceÂ\n\nA major theme explored in the novel is the role of faith in peopleâs lives and throughout the novel faith, superstition and emerging science contend with each other. Before the plague, the townspeople believe whole-heartedly in Godâs divine plan â that the good and bad things that happened to them were Godâs rewards or punishments for their virtues or sins. However, the plague makes this worldview unsupportable as the unremitting suffering of plague victims, depicted through gory and vividly gruesome descriptions, demonstrates that their suffering is not commensurate with their sin and that no one can deserve this fate. In particular, it is the suffering of children that most intensely shakes Annaâs faith in a divine plan. Her two young sons are early victims of the plague and their youth and innocence mean it is impossible to justify their deaths as punishment for sin. The sheer tragedy of the plague causes Anna to realise that faith in Godâs plan is inadequate to explain suffering and tragedy and she looks for another explanation. This leads her to use science and medicine to ameliorate pain. By focusing on discovering possible cures or pain relievers, Anna and Elinor are indirectly treating the plague as just a 'thing in nature', eschewing the prevailing religious view that the plague is the result of Godâs wrath. Their emerging scientific worldview does not rely on Godâs presence and intervention in the material world and Anna loses her religious faith.Â\n\nHowever, the scientific method and worldview were only in its very nascent form and most people held a firm belief in supernatural intervention, making the townspeople prone to superstition and, in their ignorance and fear, murderous mob hysteria.Â\n\nWomen and Female SexualityÂ\n\nWomen in Eyam had lived highly circumscribed and restricted lives until the crisis of the plague disrupted the social order. The behaviour and speech of women were heavily policed and punished. In a particularly horrifying episode, Joss puts his wife in a muzzle and parades her through the village after she publicly criticises him. While Joss is undeniably an all-round bad guy, his misogyny cannot be dismissed as singular to him. Even Mompellion, an altruistic and in some ways quite progressive man, takes a very harsh stance on female sexuality. Although he preached to adulterous male villagers such as Jakob Merrill that 'as God made us lustful so he understands and forgives', he denied Elinor forgiveness for her teenage sexual relationship and was unfathomably rageful when he discovers Jane Martin having sex outside of marriage. However, Brooks criticises the taboo on female sexuality and shows that sexual desire is an awakening and liberating force for Anna, twice helping her to come out of deep depressions and reminding her that life has joy and meaning.Â Â\n\nThere are strong feminist undertones throughout the novel as each female character exhibits strengths that the male characters do not and challenges the limitations of her role, expressing desire for more personal autonomy and agency. From the beginning of the novel, Anna admires the sexual freedom of Anys Gowdie and the ability of Elinor to unreservedly pursue her intellectual interests. During the plague, Anna finds herself eschewing her old role and social position and assuming many challenging and indispensable responsibilities that would have been unthinkable for any woman â especially a young single working-class woman â before the plague.Â\n\nLeadership and Judgement in Times of Crisis\n\nThe text explores both the power of religious leaders to influence public opinion and the ability of strong and courageous individuals to rise to positions of respect and authority in a crisis. Mompellionâs natural leadership and rhetorical skill keep the community calm and bring out the spirit of self-sacrifice in them. His clear dedication to his work and parishioners inspires trust in the community, and although Mompellion comes to doubt his judgement, it is undeniable that his strong leadership and assumption of huge responsibility saved countless lives. Anna also emerges as an unofficial leader; she becomes an essential figure and the voice of reason in Eyam. The communityâs newfound respect for Anna is evident in the way she is listened to and adhered to and her confidence in firmly and decisively addressing and directing men and those of a higher social class.Â Â\n\nWe see examples of powerful leadership in the novel, but we also see how an overwhelming crisis can lead to a shortage of clear leadership and expose flaws in existing governing systems. Eyam relied on its gentry (Colonel Bradford) and vicar (Michael Mompellion) to adjudicate and administer justice. However, on the advent of the plague, the Bradfords fled from Eyam and Mompellion became overwhelmed by work, leaving the townspeople to frequently administer their own justice through group tribunals or vigilante action. Additionally, the extreme circumstances of the plague mean the town must deal with crimes it has never faced before and is unsure how to punish. Brooks explores what it means to achieve justice when the only means available are faulty. There are many examples of miscarriages of justice which forces readers to think about the necessity of a strong, fair and prompt judicial system and the weaknesses inherent in these institutions.Â\n\n5.

Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based Essay Prompt: âYear of Wonders is a story of great courage in the face of extreme adversity.â Discuss.\n\nNot sure what we mean by âTheme-Based Essay Promptâ? Then, youâll want to learn more about the 5 types of essay prompts here.Â\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe starting point of any theme-based prompt is the ideas, and while this prompt characterises the novel as one essentially about courage, it is more generally exploring the theme of how people responded to the various challenges of the plague. âDiscussâ questions give you scope to partially agree, disagree, or extend the prompt. It is okay to ultimately agree with the prompt but to also demonstrate the complexity and nuance of the authorâs intentions, and I think that is the best approach for this essay!Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nAs weâve already discussed, Year of Wonders depicts a community experiencing an acute crisis and Brooks presents the very worst and very best of human nature. There are characters who display enormous courage (Anna and Elinor), others who are cowardly (the Bradfords) and those who exploit othersâ hardships for their own gain (Joss Bont). There is also an entire supporting cast of characters who individually display neither extreme courage nor cowardice but who muddle through a terrible situation with numb apathy. There is also the opportunity to define what courage means here â after all, the decision to isolate themselves within the boundaries of Eyam took immense courage from all the villagers, who knew full well that they would inevitably be exposed to the deadly contagion.Â Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nParagraph 1: [Agree] The novel is grounded in and revolves around the initial courageous decision of the villagers of Eyam to quarantine themselves and risk their own lives to protect others from the spread of the bubonic plague.Â\n\nFocus on the initial act of courage and the knowing self-sacrifice that this decision required from every single person in Eyam.Â\n\nAs the event that forms the basis of this work of historical fiction, a logical argument can be made that this first act of courage in adversity forms the foundation of the novel and therefore affirms the idea that Year of Wonders is about great courage.Â\n\nHowever, importantly, this decision was an act of community courage that anticipated future adversity but was taken before many of the villagers had actually experienced the acute hardship and suffering of the plague. This is why it is important to now discuss the courage shown by individuals in the midst of extreme adversity [link].\n\nParagraph 2: [Agree] The individuals who displayed courage, hope and conviction in the face of acute personal adversity demonstrate the enormous power of courage to steel us through a crisis.Â\n\nAnna and the Mompellions concentrate on helping others and their service helped keep some degree of social order and provided comfort to victims of the plague. What they were able to achieve and provide for the community (and how much worse the situation would have been without their courageous assumption of responsibility) illustrates Brooks' high respect for courage and service.Â Â Â\n\nTo demonstrate additional analytical thinking, you might consider discussing the fact that these characters were not courageous solely out of charity, but that having an occupation and something to keep them busy and focused actually became a personal survival mechanism. This further highlights the absolutely pivotal role of courage in adversity and is only reinforced through the contrast with the ignoble behaviour of those characters who did not behave courageously and forthrightly [link].\n\nParagraph 3: [Partial disagree] However, Year of Wonders shows how adversity can provoke extremes of human behaviour and is thus also a story of human failings under immense pressure, with many characters motivated by cowardice and self-interested opportunism.Â Â\n\nHere, you should discuss the dishonourable behaviour of the Bonts, the Bradfords and the hysterical mob that murdered the Gowdie women. Your aim should not only be to explain that they behaved without courage, but also to focus on the negative repercussions their behaviour had for them and the community This will help you build an analytical argument that Brooksâ core message is about the power and necessity of courage in the face of adversity.Â\n\nUltimately, while no character escapes from the pain and loss of the plague, Brooks provides illustrations of how different people responded to their shared suffering and it is clear that she believes that the best way to respond to adversity is with the courage and strength to face the challenge head on.Â\n\n---Â\n\nIf you found this essay breakdown helpful, let us know if youâd be interested in a complete LSG Year of Wonders Study Guide where we would cover 5 A+ fully written sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY the essays achieved A+ so you can reach your English goals!Â\n\nWeâve explored creative writing criteria, literary elements and how to replicate the text over on ourThe Ultimate Guide to VCE Creative Writing blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to creative writing, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nâ\n\nFor many students, writing creative pieces can be slightly daunting. For some, it is about unleashing the writer within as the boundaries and thematic constraints that exist inÂ Text Response are lifted. For others, it can be an opportunity to discover new writing styles, branching out from the generic T-E-E-L structure.\n\nFormats of imaginative pieces include:\n\nshort narratives,\n\na personal diary entry ,\n\nchronicling the character's thoughts,\n\nepilogues,\n\nscripts,\n\nand monologues.\n\nWriting in an imaginative style allows you to draw from your own morals, views and feelings. You can weave in personalÂ anecdotes, experiences, and metaphorical language which gives one's writing that pizazz and individualist factor!\n\nMoreover, you can showcase how you have perceived and interpreted the characters within the novel/film, the landscapes they inhabit. Alternatively, you can step into different personas. For example, for the topic of conflict, I canÂ write as an injured army medic, a doctor, a foreign correspondent and a war photographer.\n\nHowever, imaginative writing also has manyÂ pitfalls students tumble into (do not despair; you can get out of it!):\n\n1)Â Don't get too caught up in emotions and flowery language.\n\nGreat imaginative pieces are not only graded on how good your story telling skills are. More importantly, your teachers would be grading on the palpable links to the themes of the text and prompt you have been given.\n\nIn Year 11, when I wrote an imaginative piece, I went overboard with the flowery metaphorical language. My teacher said âOverall, the piece is good however, at some parts it sounded like purple prose.â When I read it over now, I shudder a little.\n\n2) In Reading and Creative, there isÂ greater emphasis on extrapolating themes and ideasÂ from your studied text.Â\n\nSo, those radical and out-of-the box ideas and views you have in relation to the text can now be used.\n\nFor example, the overarching themes inÂ Every Man In This Village Is AÂ LiarÂ encompass the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, inequality (the unequal status of women in Middle East), the effect of war on the physical body and the human psych and, how the media portrays war and violence.Â The starting point to planning any context piece is to useÂ quotes and ideas within your text.Â Infer meaning from those quotes and main ideas and ask yourself:\n\n'Does it hold a great degree of relevance to issues prevalent today?'\n\n'Can I link it to my sac/exam prompt?'Â\n\nSo, here's an example of planning a creative piece. Two of my favourite quotes fromÂ Life of GalileoÂ are:\n\n'Science is the rightful, much loved daughter of the church.'\n\nâOur ignorance is limitless; let us lop off a millimeter off it. Why try to be clever now that we at last have a chance of being less stupid.â\n\nIn essence, this conveys the overarching theme of science vs. religion, and how Church and the inquisition exploit the peoples' views through their own ignorance. Their fear of change, pioneering and gaining of new knowledge stems from the prospect of chaos if society's entrenched values are uprooted. I interpreted this as 'ignorance is not bliss' and instead, it breeds fear in people. This is in relevance with the tragic events that has occurred in recent years - acts of terrorism, and/or racially motivated attacks. In the context of our modern society, religion and science still maintain an intriguing andÂ tumultuousÂ relationship. As the advancement of technology and ethics are not at equilibrium, this is where controversy arises. Conversely, we now have to consider whether this relates to the prompt:\n\nA person never knows who they truly are, until tested by conflict.\n\nPossible idea for this example:\n\n\"Is it ethical to administer a new drug capable of rewiring and regenerating brain function at a neuronal level to someone who has sustained extensive brain damage? Is it deemed humane to potentially change a person's character? At what personal cost will this have? - Playing god.\"\n\nTips to achieve A+ in creative writing\n\n1. Ensure it is related to the text.\n\nA lot of students believe that the reading and creating essay is exactly the same as the old context essay. However, there is a significant difference! While a creative context essay does not have to link to the text in any way and only needs to explore a certain idea (e.g. encountering conflict), the reading and creating essay needs to offer a relevant interpretation of the text as well as show understanding of the textâs messages and how the text creates meaning.\n\nThe easiest way to write a creative response that links clearly to the text is to write about a scenario that is related to the plot line. You can do this by writing a continuation of the storyline (i.e. what happens after the end?), or by filling in gaps in the plot line which the author did not explicitly outline (what happens behind the scenes that caused the outcome?) In this way, your response will be completely original and still demonstrate an understanding of the world of the text.\n\n2. Write in a way that shows understanding of how the text creates meaning.\n\nWhen creating your response, be aware of the features present in your text (such as characters, narrative, motifs etc) that you can use in your own essay. For example, if the text is narrated from a first-person perspective, you may also mimic this in your essay. Or, you could tell it in first-person from another characterâs point of view to demonstrate another interpretation of the text. You may also include motifs from the text into your own response. But be careful when making decisions about structure, conventions and language. If the text is written in very formal and concise language, it is probably not a good idea to use slang. Similarly, if the text is a play, structuring your response as a script might be a better choice than writing a poem!\n\n3. Explore the explicit and implied ideas and values in the texts.\n\nLastly, remember that whilst it is a creative response, your purpose is NOT to tell a nice story but to explore the ideas, values and messages left by the author! There will always be various interpretations regarding these values, and you can express your understanding of the text through your portrayal of certain characters, or through the events in your response. For example, if you were studying Measure for Measure and wanted to explore how human nature cannot be restrained or limited by law and punishment, you could write a continuation of the play in which the city of Vienna has reverted to its original state of moral decay.\n\n4. Show, don't tell\n\nCreative essays are great because they offer interesting and unique stories; however, there is one common downfall that occurs in writing. Some students create pieces that areÂ tooÂ straightforward. Rather than using vocabulary, imagery and symbolism to express a point, they simply write down a statement that sums up what they wish to say. Your aim is to invite the reader toÂ experienceÂ the story through your words. This can be done through the characterâs thoughts, feelings, actions etc. Thus the well-known phrase among writers, âShow, donât tellâ. Keeping this idea in mind turn you into a much more successful writer â and youâll see the difference!\n\nExample 1\n\nTell: Katie was very happy.\n\nShow: Katieâs face lifted. Little wrinkles appeared around her bright eyes, her dimples made an appearance that dug into her cheeks as a big grin emerged to show her perfect teeth.\n\nExample 2\n\nTell: She felt horrible for the weeping children.\n\nShow: Guilt throbbed inside her as she stared at the weeping children. Her heart pounded against her chest, her hands trembling beside her still body, her brain screaming at her to doÂ something.\n\nExample 3\n\nTell: I was scared.\n\nShow: I hear my breathing; heavy, and rapid. I shut my eyes tightly. I can feel goosebumps running up my arms and down my back.\n\nTo test whether or not you are âtellingâ instead of âshowingâ, think about whether or not your sentence leaves room for questions. In Example 1, âKatie was very happyâ would leave the reader thinking â what thought or action showed that she was happy? Whereas âshowâ demonstrated that she was happy without directly stating it.\n\nThe key is to go into the finer details of your story!\n\nFinally, have fun and enjoy the process of planning a creative narrative, let your imagination run a little wild and rein it in with your knowledge! Hopefully these tips were helpful and you are now more confident and informed on the Reading and Creating response!Â\n\nThis blog post was written by Amanda Lau, Rosemary Chen, and Lisa Tran.\n\nWhen it comes to VCE Literature, âLiterary Perspectivesâ is a major component of your learning and exams. If youâre studying any of the Shakespearian texts, the idea of using different âlensesâ to interpret 400-year-old plays seems silly and is a difficult task to approach. So today, Iâm writing a plan for a Literary Perspectives essay on ShakespeareâsÂ Othello. The question we are looking at is:\n\nIn ShakespeareâsÂ Othello,Â Venetian society is depicted as unwelcoming to the âOtherâ. To what extent do you agree?\n\nBreaking-it-Down\n\nSo what does this question mean? Well letâs first look at the keywords, and what each means.\n\nâVenetian Societyâ-This is the group of people depicted inÂ Othello. Whilst some characters like Cassio and Othello are from other city-states, they adhere to the norms and traditions of the Venetians, who live in Venice, Italy.Â\n\nâUnwelcomingâ- In my essay, I consider âunwelcomingâ to be active discrimination against people, with the intent of alienating them from society at large, but this is open to interpretation.Â\n\nâThe Otherâ-This is a technical term from a few different literary perspectives. On a broad level, the Other is a person or group of people who are viewed as the âenemyâ or different from the dominant culture.Â\n\nThese keywords are essentially what you have to include in terms of knowledge. But, what is the question? Our essay topic says âTo what extent do you agree?â. You can choose to agree, or not at all, or be somewhere in the middle. Any of these options consider theÂ extentÂ of Veniceâs welcomeness, but you have to use evidence, and uniquely, a literary perspective.Â\n\nMy Approach\n\nBefore I even choose my contention, now is the time to decide which perspective to use for my essay. A few apply to the question andÂ Othello, but I can only have one. Using Feminism you could argue that the women of the play are âOthered,â but because they lack lots of meaningful dialogue I think it would be hard to uncover enough evidence. Marxism would also be good and would argue the working-class is othered. The issue with Marxist interpretations ofÂ Othello, however, is that there are almost no lower-class characters. Marxist theorists also regularly adopt feminist and postcolonial language, meaning I could appear as though I used multiple perspectives. I think Postcolonialism is the ideal perspective. The term âOtherâ was coined by postcolonial theorists, and Othelloâs race and place in Venetian society give me the ability to flex my understanding of postcolonialism.Â\n\nSo, now that I know I am writing from a postcolonial perspective, I can come up with a contention. First of all, who is the Other, according to postcolonialism? InÂ Othello,Â it is quite clearly Othello himself, who is from North Africa, and is constantly the victim of racism, which begins to answer my second question; is Othello welcomed by Venetian Society? Well, itâs complicated, heâs an army commander and woos a Venetian woman, but he constantly has to prove himself worthy of these things. As a result, my contention will be somewhere in between complete agreement and complete disagreement with the question.Â\n\nThe othered characters inÂ OthelloÂ are orientalised by most members of Venetian society, and must constantly prove their material worth to maintain their agency. Despite this, the women of the play act as a foil to the racism and distrust of society.\n\nPostcolonialism\n\nPostcolonial theory has roots in a more modern context than Shakespeare. The colonialism of the 19th century and the decolonisation of the 20th century lead to colonised people reevaluating their lives and the role of the European colonists on a global, social, and psychological scale. When writing from a postcolonial lens, you should try to focus on some key areas. The most significant is the relationship between the colonised and the coloniser. How do they interact? What do they think of each other? The next area is the psychology of colonialism. One useful theorist here is Frantz Fanon, a psychologist living during the French colonisation of Algier. His textÂ The Wretched of the EarthÂ stated the ways that colonised Africans were mentally oppressed, viewing themselves as less than human. This is important when discussing the Other because âotherâ represents the dehumanisation of Native lives which caused such psychological distress. A term I used in my contention should also be explained: orientalism. This term was coined by Edward Said and it explores the way the Other is viewed by the West. To âorientaliseâ something is to portray it as something wholly different to European cultures, and exaggerate these differences. It results in non-Europeans being viewed as âbackwardsâ or âsavageâ and justifies racist stereotypes. Other useful Postcolonial terms include: the Subaltern, who are the groups completely outside the margins of society, or people who lack any freedom; and Agency is the ability to act out of free-will and have a degree of power.\n\nThe Plan\n\nWith my contention and some useful postcolonial terms, I can now plan each paragraph. I am doing three, but it is possible to do four or more. I follow TEEL (Topic, explanation, evidence, link) structure quite closely, and have given simple but punchy topic sentences for each paragraph. When structuring the essay as a whole, I try to make sure each paragraph builds off of the previous argument, almost like a staircase leading to my conclusion.Â\n\n1. Othello is treated as an outsider and is a victim of racism and orientalisation due to his cultural background, constantly reminded that he is not fully Venetian.Â\n\nMy goal in this paragraph is to agree with the question. My explanation has to show that Othello isnât welcome in Venetian society, highlighting that his blackness and European views of the Moors fits Edward Saidâs theory of orientalism. I will mainly rely on Iagoâs perception of Othello, and Iago as a symbol of Veniceâs intoleration towards the Other.Â\n\nEvidence of his culture being viewed as âbackwardsâ or fundamentally different from Venice will support this point. Iagoâs first monologue (1.1.8-33) displays his intolerance to outsiders, specifically referring to Othello as âthe Moorâ, rather than by his name. Roderigo also displays a racist attitude, calling Othello âthe thick-lipsâ (1.1.71). You should try to choose linguistically significant evidence. For example, Iagoâs metaphor of a âblack ram is tupping [Brabantioâs] white eweâ (1.1.96-7) provokes imagery of the devil (black ram) defiling a symbol of purity (a white ewe).Â\n\nTo link this paragraph, refer to the use of orientalism as a method of othering that turns people against Othello, and intends to keep him separate (unwelcome) from society.\n\n2. Despite Iagoâs representation of an intolerant Venice, Othello displays a pathway for the Other to prove themselves in Venetian society, although this proof is constantly reevaluated by the dominant culture.\n\nIn this argument Iâm going against my previous paragraph, saying that Othello is welcome, but on a case-by-case basis. My explanation will include an analysis of how Othello is othered and orientalised, but still displays agency and has a role of authority in Venice. Othello is trusted, but it is a very loose trust that relies on Othelloâs continued adherence to societyâs rules. To use postcolonial language, Othello is the Other, but he is not a subaltern; he has been given a place at the coloniserâs table. But despite viewing himself as a permanent part of this table, the colonisers are always ready to remove his seat.Â\n\nI could use Brabantio as evidence of this, as he had âloved [Othelloâ (1.3.145) but quickly begins to refer to his âsooty bosomâ (1.2.85) and âfoul charmsâ (1.2.88) when he thinks Othello has overstepped his place in Venetian society by marrying a white woman. Even though Othello has proven himself as a General, the senate makes him answer for accusations based on racism and stigma. Once Othello begins to fall for Iagoâs trap of jealousy, Lodovico questions the faith placed in Othello, claiming âI am deceived in himâ (4.2.310).\n\nTherefore, despite being allowed a place within the Governmental structures of Venice, Othelloâs agency is constantly at risk, being welcomed for his proven talents, but distrusted for his âOthernessâ.\n\n3. Although Venetian society at large is unwelcoming to Othello, either through racism or distrust, Desdemona represents an attitude of acceptance towards the Other.\n\nThis argument looks at a different aspect of the question; who is the Other welcomed by? Besides Othello, Othered characters are the women and Cassio, who is from Florence. Despite not fitting into the key areas of postcolonial thought, women still have a place in this analysis, as a subcategory of the nativeâs relationship with the coloniser. How does a group that is discriminated against in their own society treat someone else who is discriminated against? Well, we see inÂ OthelloÂ that the women treat him quite well.Â\n\nDesdemona is the obvious source of evidence for this. Her adoration of Othello transcends his colour and she accepts him as part of her Venetian world. She is unswayed by the racist commentary on Othello from those around her, such as Emilia, and instead represents the welcoming of the Other on a personal, although not societal level.\n\nThus, Desdemona in her own Otherness and orderliness acts a foil to Iagoâs disorder and discrimination. As a discriminated against woman, she represents the acceptance of the other in Venetian society, and the unbridled trust of Othello that the men of Venice lack.\n\nConclusion\n\nYour conclusion should include a restatement of your arguments and your contention but also look at them in another way. I usually go through my points and how they relate to each other and my contention in a logical step-by-step way, each point building on the other to reach my contention. Point 1 leads to point 2, which leads to point 3, and combined, makes my contention.Â\n\nHopefully, this brief guide to literary perspectives inÂ Othello, focusing on postcolonialism, acts as a starting point for your studies. Itâs about understanding the beliefs of the lens and then using this to form an argument. It certainly isnât easy, so I encourage you to read around and practice this writing style as much as possible.Â\n\nRecommended Resources\n\nOn Shakespeare\n\nHow to Approach Shakespeare-Studying Shakespeare for the First time\n\nPost-colonialism in Shakespearean Work by Alina Popa (2013)\n\nOn Postcolonialism\n\nLiterary Perspectives 101\n\nList of Postcolonial Terms\n\nDefinition of Postcolonialism\n\nBenefits of Critical Essays for Literary Perspectives Essays\n\nThe Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon (2001), Penguin Modern Classics, Great Britain.\n\nOrientalism by Edward W.

For me it was a no-brainer; Iâd always loved English so why wouldnât I take advantage of the opportunity to study two English-based subjects? Looking back on my VCE experience now, and comparing my experience of studying each subject, I can see that they are each very different. However, if youâre going to study both, donât expect that each subject will unfold in isolation, because your work in one of these subjects will undoubtedly impact upon your work in the other - even if, like me, you complete them in different years. So if you enjoy English I would 100% endorse studying both VCE English and VCE Literature, but being an English-nerd I still think there are benefits to analysing the process of studying this dynamic-duo back to back.\n\nThe Content\n\nâ\n\nAt the beginning, I assumed that Literature and English would be fairly similar in terms of studying and writing. Itâs all about reading books and writing essays, right? Well, whilst this is essentially true, it turns out that the process for each subject is quite different. I studied year 12 Literature first, completing it in 2017 as a year 11 student, and as my only unit 3/4 subject for that year it was the focus of a lot of my time, energy, and creativity. What I loved about VCE Literature from the beginning was the departure from formula; the impetus to âdive right inâ as my teacher always used to say. Instead of worrying about how many sentences your introductions and conclusions have to be, in Literature you can simply get straight into the analysis and see how far it takes you. So, if youâre the kind of person who needs to stick to that body paragraph structure acronym that has always served you so well, then when you first start studying Literature it might be a challenge to loosen up. Or, if youâre like me and canât shake the compulsion to write paragraphs that take up double-sided sheets of paper, you might find this subject to be a welcome respite from some of the restrictions of English tasks.\n\nAlthough English is often viewed as the more âbasicâ of the two, in many ways I found it more difficult once I hit year 12. Having just finished VCE Literature, shifting my focus back to English definitely wasnât as seamless as I might have expected. In comparison to my Literature essays where I would base paragraphs around in-depth analysis of a few of Gaskellâs sentences, my English text responses felt stunted and forced â English isnât really compatible with tangents, and so it was difficult to train myself to be expressive whilst also being concise. In my opinion, the most daunting of the year 12 VCE English SACs is the comparative, and this is where my lack of flow was most evident. Being accustomed to delving into complex discussion of the details of my Literature texts, it seemed impossible to provide insightful analysis of two texts simultaneously, whilst also comparing them to each other and also keeping my essays well structured. My first comparative practices sounded somewhat awkward when I read over them, and I just felt like I never really knew what I was trying to get across. This provoked me to be frustrated with myself, and then my frustration distracted me from writing, and then my essays read even more contrived; you get the idea.\n\nSo, how do you push past this sense of friction between the study of English and the study of Literature? Well, I think the best way to reconcile the conflicting approaches is to realise that each subject brings out different strengths, but these strengths can be applied to either type of study. Yes to a certain extent English is supposed to be formulaic, but you can use the analysis skills you learn in Literature to enhance your English text responses and give your work a point of difference. On the flip side, the structure you work with in English can be applied to Literature to ensure that your essays always exhibit direction and purpose, even if they encompass a broader range of discussion. Once I realised that I didnât have to discard all of my Literature skills and start writing my English work exactly the same as everybody else, I began to develop a more fluid, balanced writing style that enhanced all of my English tasks â even the comparative.\n\nThe Exam\n\nâ\n\nLetâs start with the obvious comparisons between the English exam and the Literature exam. Firstly, the English exam encompasses three essays in three hours (with 15 minutes reading time), whilst Literature is only two essays in two hours. The English exams tasks include a text response to a prompt, a comparative text response to a prompt, and a language analysis. The Literature exam involves a passage analysis, and a text response to a prompt influenced by a literary perspective. Where in the English exam you are given a choice of prompts for each text choice, whereas for both sections of the Literature exam only one choice is available for each text. Whilst both exams involve some supplied material, in Literature this material is a passage from one of the set texts, however for the language analysis section of the English exam this is completely unseen material created by the VCAA. For me, this felt like a very significant difference, because there is no familiar material (i.e. passages from the texts) to rely on in the English exam; if you get lost you canât latch on to anything except what you have memorised.\n\nPersonally, I think that the study strategies I utilised for each exam were fairly similar, although obviously geared towards different tasks. I took in depth notes on my texts, planned essays, memorised quotations and explored their significance, timed my practice essays etc. My actual approach to each exam was also similar, for example I made sure to allocate one hour for each different task and did all of my planning mentally during reading time. So although obviously everyoneâs study and exam techniques are different, this shows that your own personal strategies that you develop can be applied to both the Literature and the English exams. However, despite the continuity in this sense I still found myself feeling very different coming out of my English exam than I had leaving my Literature exam the year before. Where after the Literature exam I had been content with the knowledge that I had showcased the best version of my abilities, after the English exam I felt much more unsure and ready to believe the worst about the outcome. This particular comparison is of course specific to every individual person, however I think it could have something to do with the knowledge that most VCE students study English and the difficulty in believing that your work could stand out from the work of 40,000 others.\n\nThe Results\n\nâ\n\nIn the end, I achieved very different results from these two subjects, with English being my highest study score and Literature being one of my 10% contributions. It seems to be a general consensus (or at least it was at my school) that it is more difficult to crack the high 40s in Literature than in English, and whether this is true or not it definitely impacted my expectations of my results each subject. However, that said, after being slightly disappointed with my Literature results in year 11 I was not overly optimistic about doing much better in English. When talking about this with my Literature teacher, she told me to âremember that English is marked very differently to Lit, so donât think you canât get a 50â and I think this is very solid advice. Whilst you might feel you were equally skilled at both subjects, this doesnât mean you will receive equally âgoodâ resultsâ, but donât let this disparity discourage you because, as we have discussed throughout this post, when it comes to Literature and English one size does not fit all.\n\nâ"
