        "text": ".My kids liked to choose their own books at the library, but not because they were excited to explore the stacks. They did it because they were afraid they’d have to read a thick, dusty book that I chose, something good for them, much like spinach or asparagus.\n\nI knew how to find books to read to them, but not books they wanted to read independently. Over the years, I learned to find books they considered good reading. To do this, I had to figure out the genres that most interested them by watching the types of books that held their attention.\n\nI also paid attention to their favorite movies, and categorized them as adventure, fantasy, mystery, or another genre. These clues, when put together with their personalities and their likes and dislikes, helped me find my kids’ genre preferences, which went a long way in guiding me to choose books they wanted to read and motivated them to read.\n\nIf you’ve studied your children, you may know some of the genres your kids prefer too. Here’s what you can do with that information. Go to https://www.pluggedin.com/book-reviews. Next to the words “Book Reviews‚” is a drop-down menu beneath the word “Filter.” If you click on the arrow, you can find a specific genre that your child likes to read. Click on it and on the “Submit” button to receive a list of books that have been reviewed in that genre. By glancing through the reviews, you’ll be able to tell fairly quickly whether the book is appropriate for your child’s age, stage or interests.\n\nIf that sounds too daunting, I’ve listed a number of books by their genres as a place for you to begin"
