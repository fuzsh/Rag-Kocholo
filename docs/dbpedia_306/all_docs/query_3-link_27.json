        "text": "The art of storytelling is treacherous, and the new film “Only the Brave,” released last Friday, is among the more noteworthy recent displays of the art’s peculiarities and pitfalls. The movie is a stirring dramatization, directed by Joseph Kosinski, based on a nonfiction account in GQ by Sean Flynn (and co-produced by Condé Nast Entertainment), of the real-life activities of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, heroic fighters of wildfires in Arizona. Yet it also offers a timely reminder that stories are decisions, that there’s no such thing as “the story,” no preëxisting idea or self-determined material that belongs in a movie by dint of its chosen subject or characters. The decisions that go into the composition and the telling of stories have a meaning of their own and—as in “Only the Brave”—what filmmakers leave out can be far more revealing than what they choose to include.\n\nThe action of “Only the Brave” is centered on Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin), the rugged, volatile, insightful, deeply capable superintendent of a wildfire-fighting outfit in Prescott, Arizona, that’s relegated to Type 2 status. That legal designation means that, despite Eric’s profound understanding of the best way to fight wildfires, his crew must follow the orders of certified Type 1 (a.k.a. “Hotshot”) units and merely complete the jobs that they have started. As a municipal company, the Prescott outfit has little chance to compete for Hotshot standing; but the local fire chief, Duane Steinbrink (Jeff Bridges, in a performance rich in wry humor and lived-in wisdom), vouches for them to the mayor (Forrest Fyre), and Eric is authorized to seek Type 1 certification for his company. Meanwhile, a young man named Brendan McDonough (Miles Teller), a slacker and a stoner, has gotten a young woman (Natalie Hall) pregnant. She has no interest in him or in his help raising the child; but, having grown up without his own father, Brendan is determined to pitch in, and, in order to get his life together, applies for a job with the firefighters.\n\nThe script, by Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer, puts exceptional emphasis on Eric and Brendan’s personal lives. Eric, for his part, is in a passionate marriage with Amanda (Jennifer Connelly), a horse trainer, but something troubled in their past shadows their daily lives. (It surges to the surface of the action only very late in the film, when the couple’s stifled conflicts burst forth with some trenchant writing delivered with familiar histrionics.) Brendan is first seen as a young fool, getting into fights, getting arrested, getting kicked out of his mother’s house. When he is hired as a firefighter, the other members of the outfit see him as physically and mentally unfit (they give him the nickname “Donut”), but Donut masters the necessary tough physical discipline and the book studies and becomes an integral part of the unit. The movie also gives both men a foil. Eric’s is his second-in-command, Jesse Steed (James Badge Dale), who provides a model of ordinary family life that contrasts with Eric’s own. Donut’s foil is Mac (Taylor Kitsch), a sexually crude and emotionally stunted colleague who is also Donut’s most vicious harasser. (Of course, he and Donut become close friends, and Mac matures, largely through Donut’s influence.)\n\n“Only the Brave” is filled with conspicuous touches of heartiness, of bonding (male bonding) that’s part of the discipline and the teamwork required to face danger practically and get the job done. The movie offers a vision of sentimental unity for the common good in a town where people—white people—go out of their way to help each other. Yet as I watched the movie, I felt that something was missing (including the possibility that there might be anyone besides white people in Prescott). “Only the Brave” ties the characters’ private lives to their work lives in a plethora of details, but it never looks beyond the work life into life at large, or even into the life that surrounds them in their own home town. After the viewing, prompted by curiosity, I looked (very casually, just a few minutes’ click-around) at news about the Hotshots and turned up an entire realm of activity that’s integral to their lives yet is excluded from the movie, and that is at least as interesting regarding them—and about their locale and American times at large—as anything in the movie. In short, “Only the Brave” comes off as stirring, effective, patriotic propaganda for a picture of America that is itself merely a one-sidedly useful artifice.\n\nThis is the place for a spoiler alert, which, however, won’t be a spoiler for anyone who has read anything about the real-life Granite Mountain Hotshots. As depicted in the movie, nineteen of the twenty members of the company died, on June 30, 2013, while fighting a wildfire, and Donut is the sole survivor. The tail credits state the names of the other members of the company, the sixteen whose characters aren’t developed in the film. A cursory search for one of them, Joe Thurston, turned up a Prescott News article from June 7, 2016, headlined “Prescott Approves Survivor Benefits for Widow of Wildland Firefighter Joe Thurston.” “The criteria were the same as those applied during previous hearings where benefits were awarded to three other wildland firefighters lost on June 30, 2013,” the piece reads. What’s hidden in plain sight in this report is that, for nearly three years, benefits had been withheld from Thurston’s widow, Marsena, and other women who lost their husbands in the disaster.\n\nIt turns out that, just a few weeks after the tragedy, one widow, Juliann Ashcraft, the spouse of the late firefighter Andrew Ashcraft, complained that she was being denied benefits; soon others did so, too. Because the town of Prescott deemed some of its firefighters to be “temporary” or “seasonal,” those victims’ families were denied the benefits that were being received by the families of permanent or full-time employees. (Some surviving family members also sued the town for three hundred million dollars in damages.) What’s more, several of the movie’s main characters were involved in the dispute:\n\nHotshot leader Eric Marsh’s widow, Amanda, remembers her husband talking about how Prescott officials held back on Andrew Ashcraft when he became full-time.\n\n“He was very upset with the city. He was very upset with the entire City Council because they made it so hard for him to get benefits for that position,” Amanda Marsh said.\n\nThese disputes soon grew more bitter, more complicated, and more political, as Fernanda Santos reported in 2014, in the Times. When some of the widows sought the benefits that were being denied them, “city officials fueled only hostility, telling residents and municipal workers that taxes might need to go up and raises be delayed for another year because of what the deaths had already cost, according to several people involved in these discussions, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.”\n\nSome of the more vocal widows became the target of stinging criticism; in online forums and letters to the editors, people called them “greedy,” “disgusting” or worse. Juliann Ashcraft decided to leave Prescott altogether to spare her four children the discomfort of whispers and glares. . . . As a result of the dispute, there were two separate memorial services held for the fallen firefighters—one organized by their union, one run by the city of Prescott.\n\nNothing of the sort is even hinted at in “Only the Brave.” The movie has no more room for discussions between Eric and Amanda about the employment status of the men under his command than it does for the disputes that arose after the tragedy and that drove the town—seemingly unified in its grief and mourning—into open conflict. Much is made in “Only the Brave” about Prescott’s point of pride that the Granite Mountain Hotshots was the first and only municipal Type 1 outfit in the United States; nothing at all suggests that Prescott may have been attempting to get that honor on the cheap. The battles that the Hotshots’ widows have faced over health insurance, taxes, labor law, and budgets, involving the online harassment of women, are—without a word about party identification or political campaigns—at least as crucial and exemplary a vision of contemporary American life as the tale of the firefighters’ courage and self-sacrifice."
