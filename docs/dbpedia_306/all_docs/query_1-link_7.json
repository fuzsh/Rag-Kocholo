        "text": "Oh to be Merle Oberon and run into your lover in the prison ward, break him out, hide 'em in your wine cellar, and then have to explain that you've been dating a Nazi for information in his absence! In a film NOT directed by Dorothy Arzner, the male lead would probably freak out at this revelation, but Brian Aherne is refreshingly calm about the situation.\n\nletterboxd.com/mabusecast/list/mabusecast-classic-film-challenge-2022/\n\nRepresentation Matters\n\n26. Watch a film directed by Dorothy Arzner\n\na fun little anti-nazi film directed by one of the few women directors in classic Hollywood that had me clapping when Merle Oberon said that all nazis are “fundamentally weak, cowardly, little people” towards the end!\n\nNot much to it but satisficing in the way most studio programmer films tend to be for me!\n\nWhat to expect from a Dorothy Arzner war movie? She's a little salty once or twice toward masculinist values (\"You could be shot for that, Coronel Schwerner... or even stripped of rank, which would be even worse.\") but it was more important for everyone involved to highlight Nazi horrors and partisan bravery, so that's text and subtext both. Does Ms. A. somehow offer a nuanced, female reading of the emotional repercussions women experience when they do espionage work? I'm thinking there's something there, but it's not necessarily for me to say.\n\n\"Is anything impossible to a Nazi?\"\n\nNot as cutting or entertaining as To Be or Not to Be but it's a visually beautiful film (probably more so than any of Arzner's films I've seen so far) and the acting is really solid. Merle Oberon is especially quite good, I wish it didn't feel like all the men were driving forward the movie around her.\n\nIt's kind of an interesting look at the perks (and problems) with dating a Nazi. (haha)\n\nFemtember #16\n\nNeat little 40's spy film and the third or fourth film I've watched this week to feature a wedding. Oberon is a total badass and I'm always a fan of wartime films that take the female viewpoint since we get so damn many from men's. It also has a top notch score that fits the mood like a shoe. Arzner may not be groundbreaking in any major sense, but most of what she makes is above competent and some of her work is downright brilliant (See Dance, Girl, Dance).\n\nMerle Oberon made this entire film her own and did an incredible job at that. I loved how passionate and strong her character was and even after everything continues to fight for things bigger than herself. Brain Aherne was also great as her main love I think they had good chemistry and I really liked the calmness he brought to his scenes.\n\nAll of you are fundamentally weak, cowardly, little people!\n\nA woman is looked down upon in her small Norwegian town for being in a relationship with a Nazi, but she is actually an undercover spy sending vital information to England. I put this movie on because I expected it to be basic so that I could do my nails. I didn’t start doing my nails until 40 minutes in. Surprisingly well paced and superbly led by Merle Oberon, this was a terrific spy drama that did not linger or stray far from the action. I was shocked by the unconventional storyline, where the character with most agency really was the female lead. I was particularly surprised by the ending, and the choice she makes that is so unlike the films of this genre. I am completely enamoured by Merle Oberon and her yelling down at a Nazi was incredibly sexy."
