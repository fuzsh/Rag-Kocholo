        "text": "\"The Speech\" is what Ronald Reagan called it. Today we call it, \"A Time for Choosing,\" and it was a pivotal turning point in Ronald Reagan's life.\n\nRonald Reagan began a long side-career of public speaking as his acting career closed out. He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups. This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series. \"The Speech\" was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized.\n\nDuring the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater. The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically.\n\nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency.\n\nYou may watch the speech on our YouTube channel.\n\nTranscript of \"A Time for Choosing,\" delivered on national television on October 27, 1964"
