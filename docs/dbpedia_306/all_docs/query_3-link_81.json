        "text": "There is a very clear reason as to why we tend to seek solace in films and TV series. And that is our use of these mediums as a getaway from reality. After all, we all need a break then and there, and sometimes, a good movie can fuel us up in the right way by changing our perspectives on life. Whether it is about the way we look at life in general or the way we look at some specific aspect of our life like the romantic side of ourselves, certain films tend to change us for our own good.\n\nIf you are at a standstill and are looking for a film that can influence you for the good, we highly recommend going through the following list. This list is a compilation of films that have approached the theme of life in different ways. The best part is that the films included come from different parts of the world, in turn, catering to a large viewership. This list will definitely help you approach life with a new lens. These are movies that make you think, and might even be movies that will change your life.\n\nUpdated on September 16th, 2023, by Timothy Lindsey: This article has been updated with additional content to keep the discussion fresh and relevant with even more information and new life-changing movies.\n\n25 Whiplash (2014)\n\nA film that was both nominated and went on to win multiple awards including two Academy Awards. Whiplash is a film that makes you witness the mental and physical trauma that the protagonist, Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) undergoes at the hands of a harsh jazz instructor, Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons). Andrew enters the \"prestigious\" Shaffer Conservatory with many ambitions and hopes but what he does not expect is the absurd level of training Fletcher puts him under. Whiplash will make you rethink many things, including the way we associate \"pushing ourselves\" to attain \"perfection\".\n\nDamien Chazelle, the film's director and writer, points out that Whiplash's story comes from his own experience with a high-school music teacher and that the core message lies on the thin line between pushing yourself to overcome your flaws and pushing yourself over the edge that it leaves a damaging scar on you. If you are someone who is constantly pressuring yourself, this movie is for you.\n\n24 Jojo Rabbit (2019)\n\nA beautiful comedy-drama that takes place during the latter part of World War II, when Nazi Germany was at its diminishing point. Unlike other World War movies, Jojo Rabbit takes a light-hearted route in sending out a powerful message by telling the story from the point of view of a young boy, Johannes \"Jojo\" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), who is introduced as an ardent Hitler-fan.\n\nHowever, Jojo's version of Hitler is not on par with Hitler as the world knows of him. Thus, as the story progresses, Jojo is forced to encounter some harsh truths that end up shattering his perspectives on Nazi Germany and allows him to develop a friendship with Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie), a young Jewish girl his mother had hidden in their house. It is a beautiful film about how our perspectives have been created by our delusional ideas of the world.\n\n23 The Kings of Summer (2013)\n\nRichard Propes calls The Kings of Summer \"the kind of film that makes you feel better after watching it than you did before\". Interestingly, this film will give you a satisfying closure at the end. The Kings of Summer focuses on the tensions that arise when you are growing up. The film focuses on the protagonist, Joe Toy (Nick Robinson), it follows the story of a group of young boys who try to build their world in the woods.\n\nHowever, with the conflicts that arise with one another, they are made to rethink their decisions. Finally, you see a lot of making amends and reaching out. This allows you to consider your relationships with your family, friends, and even yourself.\n\n22 Amélie (2001)\n\nFor those who are fans of French films, Amélie might not be a new name. From the cinematography to the performances and the protagonist, Amélie Poulain, this particular film will win your heart and leave a lasting impact on you. In a nutshell, Amélie is about the beauty of life. This is shown through the protagonist, Amélie (Audrey Tautou), who is someone going through an identity crisis due to her loneliness. Amélie struggles to understand herself and to realize what makes her happy and so, she uses her time to make others happy.\n\nIn this journey of finding others' happiness, Amélie ends up recognizing herself and her emotions. Thus, the film concludes with a heart-warming end that shows Amélie in her new-found happiness. This film will help you see how beautiful your life is. Due to the emphasis on simple pleasures, you will be able to realize how happiness lies in every corner, and it is mostly about our perspectives.\n\n21 The Green Mile (1999)\n\nA must-watch film that will make you end up in tears. Perhaps, the infamous scene of Michael Clarke Duncan, who plays the role of John Coffey, asking the officers not to put \"that thing over (my) face\" during his execution, as he is afraid of the dark, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of cinema history.\n\nThe Green Mile makes you think a lot about different topics including the use the of death penalty and how certain people are accused of crimes based on their looks. The performances by Duncan and Tom Hanks will make you look at life from a new perspective as the film heavily emphasizes the value of human lives, which we tend to take for granted.\n\nRelated: 15 Best Classic Older Movies on Disney+ to Watch Right Now\n\n20 The Help (2011)\n\nThe Help might be a controversial film, and it is a film that could've taken a better approach to telling its story. Based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of the same name, this film takes us back to the 1960s-America where Black women worked as maids in white households. The film's core message is based on racism as it shows the abuse the Black women had to encounter when being \"employed\" by white families. The inhumane treatment, the constant casting aside, and the way the Black community has been shunned from society, all these messages make you think deeply about racism that is still prevalent today.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue with the film, as Viola Davis, who plays the role of Aibileen Clark, points out is that \"it wasn't the voices of the maids that were heard\" since the story is predominantly told from Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan's (Emma Stone) perspective, in turn, making her come off as a \"white savior.\" Nonetheless, this film is included in this list because Davis's performance and the performances by other Black actors including Octavia Spencer, illustrate how powerful women can be, in turn, inspiring the viewers.\n\n19 The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)\n\nAn autobiographical film that gives you a glimpse of the struggles Chris Gardner went through. With Will Smith taking over Gardner's role and Smith's son, Jaden Smith, taking over Gardner's son's role, The Pursuit of Happyness is all about enduring, having hope, and achieving your dreams. If you are at a point in life where you feel like giving up or are losing hope, then this is the film to watch.\n\nThis particular film shows how Gardner struggled with homelessness while raising his toddler son in the 1980s. This struggling man goes through many obstacles including issues with his wife, inability to afford basic needs, and trying to fulfill his son's needs. However, what makes this film so beautiful is its ending. By enduring all this and not losing hope, Gardner was able to secure a good job which ultimately made him the successful man he is today.\n\n18 Life of Pi (2012)\n\nThere are many adaptations of Yann Martel's philosophical novel, including plays, and for very good reason. This particular movie, which features Suraj Sharma as the young Pi Patel and the late Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi Patel, is all about playing with and changing the perspectives of the viewer. What we witness in Life of Pi might be a true story or a fictional one created by the narrator.\n\nHowever, what we do know by the end of the film is that our lives can be altered by our imagination and how we decide to tell our stories. Pi is introduced as a curious character who explores different religions. As the story progresses, he ends up losing his family and is forced to survive in a stranded boat with a tiger. The film will make you look at yourself as the narrator of your own life and that is why, it is highly recommended by many viewers and critics.\n\n17 The Whale (2022)\n\nThis film is the reason why we are in a Fraser era, as it shows how brilliantly talented Brendan Fraser is. The Whale is a story about an obese English tutor who is leading a very lonely and solitary life. Charlie (Brendan Fraser) is leading an unhealthy lifestyle as he refuses to \"expose\" himself to others due to his obese nature. This has resulted in his fractured relationship with his close ones, including his daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink).\n\nEven if the film might come off as one that is on \"health\", it is truly about how we encounter guilt and shame and how we refuse to be honest. What follows is Charlie's realization of his need to be more honest, which also acts as his ultimate freedom from guilt. The Whale will help you understand a little bit more about those around us and how we all need support from one another. More often than not, this support comes in the form of honest and genuine conversations.\n\n16 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nAt one point in life, you might have come across pain so powerful that you felt like erasing your memories to escape it. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a film that focuses on this specific thought. What we witness is two protagonists trying to erase their memories using a system developed by a fictional New York City firm.\n\nHowever, even after the \"erasing of memories\", many patients end up rekindling the relationships they have attempted to escape from, including the two protagonists. Ultimately, what this film tells its viewers is that memories should not be erased as they are there to teach us something. Memories, whether painful or not, are an integral part of our identity that allows us to develop beautiful bonds with one another.\n\nRelated: 12 Movies Marketed as Horror That Weren't Really Scary\n\n15 Angels in the Outfield (1993)\n\nAngels in the Outfield tells a wonderful story about believing. The California Angels are a terrible baseball team. But when a foster boy named Roger (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) prays that the team can win his father, who said they'll become a family \"when the Angels win the Pennant\", will take him back. Angels from Heaven start to come down during games to help the team win. But only Roger can see them.\n\nHe convinces frustrated manager George Knox (Danny Glover) about the angels he sees, and he starts to believe as the team starts winning in the craziest ways. In the final game, without the help of the angels, the team ends up winning because they believe in themselves. Roger and his foster friend J.P. are later adopted by Knox. This movie is one of the best sports films of all time. It teaches people that believing in something that isn't always visible can rally and empower a team or just one person. Sometimes, something otherworldly can make you rethink the idea of faith.\n\n14 Dead Poets Society (1989)\n\nNow, you might not want to watch a film where you feel like another student experiencing a lecture from some English teacher from 1959 but in Dead Poets Society, what you experience is not another English lesson but, rather, a lesson on life. With the late Robin Williams taking over the role of John Keating, this film follows John's attempts at teaching his students the importance of discovering oneself and giving them the necessary support and courage to stand their ground and pursue their dreams.\n\nThis inspires some of the students to revive the \"Dead Poets Society\", which Keating was a part of when he was a student at Welton. However, not everyone has a happy ending and the film ends with a bittersweet farewell between the teacher and the students. The important part of the film is that it will surely leave you inspired and will help you tap into your confidence and passions.\n\n13 A Beautiful Mind (2001)\n\nYet another biographical film, A Beautiful Mind is based on Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. This film focuses on Nash's struggles with schizophrenia and how he tries to deal with it. The film will break your heart but also empower it at the end. With Russell Crowe taking over the role of John Nash and Jennifer Connelly taking over the role of Alice, Nash's wife, you get to witness their beautiful relationship and how it plays a prominent role in helping Nash accept his conditions.\n\nHow Nash decides to take matters into his own hands and \"deal with\" schizophrenia by himself allows the viewer to be empowered and motivated. At the end of the film, the viewers get to see how beautiful a person's mind can truly be.\n\n12 3 Idiots (2009)\n\nThis Indian film revolves around three best friends who meet at a prestigious University. Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan (R. Madhavan), and Raju (Sharman Joshi) are quite different from each other, but Rancho, being a rebel, takes the lead in ensuring his friends are happy. The film focuses on how brilliance and intelligence come in different ways and are not based on the scores you gain during exams.\n\nRancho's mysterious life and his ways reveal him to be a student who is constantly standing up against the authoritarian rule of the University's director. The film will surely inspire you to pursue your dreams, and it will also show you that just because you have bad grades, it does not mean that you are not smart as intelligence can never be determined by a test.\n\n11 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)\n\nYet another must-watch film that will fuel your hopes and motivate you to pursue your dreams. The Shawshank Redemption is a story about enduring the pain, trauma, and torture that the protagonists, Andy (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) undergo while at the Shawshank penitentiary.\n\nThese two characters are put through so many trials and turbulence and what keeps them alive is their hope to one day be free. There are so many powerful messages within this film but one that will hit you hard is that perseverance will be rewarded. Andy's 19 years of plotting and planning his prison escape led him to his freedom. Even if these 19 years meant so many traumatic episodes, he holds on to his hope through it all, which ultimately has a positive impact on Red.\n\nRelated: These Are Some of the Most Heroic Characters in Movies Who Aren't Superheroes\n\n10 The Secret Life of Pets (2016)\n\nWhat do pets do when their owners are away for the day? That is exactly the question that The Secret Life of Pets asks viewers. After a dog named Max's (Louis C.K.) perfect, comfortable life is interfered with when another dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) is bought by his owner, the two end up forming a strong friendship that helps them get home after they are lost in New York City. They must also stay away from a crazy bunny known as Snowball (Kevin Hart) and his army of sewer animals.\n\nIn the movie, viewers see pets having parties, hanging out in each other's apartments, driving cars, traveling through construction zones, swimming, etc. It is one of the most imaginative films of all time. When you leave your home, what do your pets do? Surely, they don't just sit still all day. It is a movie that makes people think about a very unorthodox thing: pets acting like humans.\n\n9 Slumdog Millionaire (2008)\n\nSlumdog Millionaire is not an easy watch and so, you will have to be prepared for some excruciating scenes. Nonetheless, this Academy Award-winning film is a must-watch simply because it will have a lasting impact on you, and it is one of those films that you will revisit over time. The film focuses on the poor-stricken boy Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) who grows up in a slum in Mumbai.\n\nJamal and his elder brother, Salim (Madhur Mittal) are poached by a gangster who intentionally blinds poor children to force them to beg. What follows is the story of how these two escape this gangster and end up following completely different routes. Salim ends up being a gangster while Jamal earns money through genuine, hard work. Ultimately, Jamal's intelligence shocks an entire nation, but it is revealed that this intelligence is a reflection of his harsh journey.\n\n8 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\n\nIt is no secret that the Indiana Jones series is all about adventure and discovery. More specifically, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a film that makes viewers think differently about the world. It changed the movie rating system due to its scenes that involve human sacrifice. It introduced the PG-13 rating. Harrison Ford stars as the whip-handling archeologist as he survives a poisoning attempt in Shanghai before traveling to India with little Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw). Before the plane they are on crashes, they jump out and slide down the slopes of the Himalayas before arriving in a small village. The villagers beg for Jones's help after their sacred village stone and children are taken by an evil cult at a nearby palace. Jones and Co. must go to the palace, bring back the children and the stone, and they must defeat the cult before they become too powerful.\n\nWhat makes viewers think differently about the world, and religion specifically, is how the village leaders tell Indiana Jones that they prayed to their Hindu God in the hopes that they'd get help. Jones and Co. are under the impression that their plane simply crashed, and that's all. The villagers believe that their God made the plane crash so that Jones would help save their children and the sacred stone that brings life to their village. Their God could've brought an army from anywhere, but it instead brought Indiana Jones to them. He, along with Willie and Short Round, risk their lives to save the kids and end the horror of the cult. It is an extremely interesting thought.\n\n7 The Truman Show (1998)\n\nIf you are ready for your mind to get a little twisted and maybe rethink a lot of things, The Truman Show will not disappoint you. Here is a film that follows a man, Truman (Jim Carrey), as he is placed in an experimental \"box\" where the world around him is created and manipulated so that he is the \"main character\" of a reality show.\n\nFollowing his birth, Truman becomes part of an artificial world that is surrounded by hidden cameras as he is watched 24/7 by people around the globe. So, yes, Truman is an entertainer, but he is not aware of it. The show gives a different meaning to the phrases \"being watched\" and \"the reality is not what it seems\". It heavily focuses on society's binaries where people are constantly manipulated by the media, in turn, changing your perspectives on the whole media industry.\n\n6 Parasite (2019)\n\nThis South Korean film by Bong Joon-ho needs no introduction as Parasite is not your ordinary thriller. It is a film that focuses on every trivial detail and ensures that everything ties up to the ultimate message of the story; the social binaries we are all a part of. The film reveals the wealth inequalities and the social hierarchy that is prevalent in South Korea.\n\nThat being said, the film applies to any nation across the world. The aspirations of the Kim family and the naive and blinded nature of the Park family lead them to their disruptive end. It is both disturbing and fascinating but will surely impact the way you look at society. The next time you witness rain, after watching Parasite, you might end up thinking about the social disparities and how something as simple as rain affects people very differently."
