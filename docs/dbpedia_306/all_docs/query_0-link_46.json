Showing a movie in the classroom, even as a reward, is not as straightforward as pressing play.\n\nCopyright laws protect the intellectual property of filmmakers and production companies, ensuring they receive proper compensation and control over how their works are used and distributed.\n\nFor teachers, this means taking extra steps to ensure the movie reward is fun and lawful.\n\nUnderstanding Public Performance Rights\n\nMost commercially available movies are intended for personal, home use only. When you plan to show a film to a group outside the home, especially in a public setting like a classroom, it typically falls under the category of a public performance.\n\nPublic performances require a license, even if the event is free and occurs in an educational setting.\n\nHowever, there’s good news: many educational institutions may already have agreements covering public performance rights for various live-action and animated films.\n\nHow to Ensure You’re Covered\n\nCheck with Your Institution: Before choosing a movie, inquire with your school’s administration or library media specialist. They can inform you whether your school has a site license that includes the film you wish to show.\n\nEducational Exemptions: Familiarize yourself with the specifics of the Copyright Law’s Fair Use guidelines and the TEACH Act. While these provide some exemptions for educational use, they have specific conditions and limitations, particularly regarding the environment in which the film is shown and the educational purpose behind its use.\n\nSeek Permission When in Doubt: If your desired film is not covered under an existing license or exempted for educational purposes, you may need to obtain permission directly from the copyright holder or a licensing agency. Many major film studios have departments or designated agents to handle such requests, and fees can vary depending on the film and the viewing context.\n\nAlternative Licensing Agencies: Organizations like the Motion Picture Licensing Corporation (MPLC) and the Public Performance Licensing Agency (PPLA) offer umbrella licenses that give educational institutions the rights to show a wide array of movies for non-commercial, educational purposes.\n\nBy ensuring that you have the appropriate permissions or licenses to show a movie in your classroom, you not only adhere to legal standards but also model ethical behavior for your students.\n\nIntegrating movies into the classroom as a reward can significantly enhance your student’s educational experience, offering students a break from the routine and invaluable lessons woven through compelling narratives.\n\nOur carefully curated list of G-rated movies provides a wide array of options suitable for young audiences, each chosen for its unique ability to entertain, educate, and inspire."
