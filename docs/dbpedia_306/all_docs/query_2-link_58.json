        "text": "Athena Film Festival\n\nThe Athena Film Festival at Barnard College in New York City, is a weekend of inspiring films that tell the extraordinary stories of fierce and fearless women leaders. Over the last nine years, the Festival has welcomed more than 30,000 people from all over the world to 200+ screenings of narratives, documentaries, and shorts that feature diverse stories of ambition, courage, and resilience. Additionally, as part of our work we offer writing labs for TV and film writers, masterclasses and works in progress programs for women filmmakers, and other skill-building panels and opportunities for women who are breaking into film.\n\nBentonville Film Festival\n\nBentonville Film Festival (BFF), chaired by Academy Award® winner Geena Davis, promotes underrepresented voices of inclusive storytellers. We amplify stories by and about people who identify as female, non-binary, LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, and people with disabilities in entertainment and media. We do this through research, education, and supporting the production and distribution of inclusive content with our primary research partner, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media. Since the inaugural 2015 festival, BFF has grown into a year-long platform through BFFoundation, culminating with an annual festival.\n\nBreakthroughs Film Festival\n\nEstablished in 2011, Breakthroughs Film Festival (BFF) is a not for profit organization dedicated to supporting emerging filmmakers who identify as women, trans, or non-binary. Our main yearly event is a festival that takes place in downtown Toronto, showcasing Canadian and International short films in all genres made by directors of all ages. BFF’s vision is to bridge the gender gap in the filmmaking industry, where women-identifying, trans, and non-binary directors make up a small percentage and must work even harder than their male counterparts to finance and exhibit their projects. Acknowledging the lack of representation in mainstream festival spaces, we prioritize the work, expressions, and experiences of those who identify as Black, Indigenous, people of colour, trans, non-binary, working class, neurodiverse, or people with disabilities. BFF is committed to programming independent films by emerging artists whose voices, perspectives, and artistic approaches counter dominant mainstream narratives.\n\nCinéma de Femmes d’Amérique du Sud\n\nCinéma de Femmes intends to enlighten films about or made by women from South America.

The festival is open to all genres and styles. It takes place once a year, with the location alternating between two major and culturally important cities Cologne and Dortmund. The structures there that have organically grown over the last thirty years will guarantee that the tradition of expertly presenting the work of women involved in film production will be continued. The Festival is a forum for networking activities, sharing experiences, and training opportunities. Questions on gender equity, diversity, production conditions, the role of international women’s film networks, etc., regularly come under the spotlight.\n\nElles Tournent Women Film Festival Brussels\n\nFour days of films made by women—the yearly place to be for movie lovers! Elles Tournent promotes and enhances the work of women in the arts and cultural world in general, particularly in the audiovisual and media sectors. To this end, the association develops activities such as the creation and animation of socio-cultural events, festivals, exhibitions, workshops, conferences, and artistic performances.\n\nEverett Film Festival\n\nIn 1997 a group of visionary women banded together in the firm belief that the time had come for Everett and Snohomish County to experience quality international film in a festival setting. With this idea in mind, the Everett Women’s Film Festival was born. The festival was dedicated to highlighting the strength, humor, and creativity of women through provocative and entertaining films.\n\nFemcine: Festival Cine de Mujeres\n\nThe engine of FEMCINE is to celebrate and spread the cinema made by women and the one that has women as protagonists, when we say “Cinema that sees you” it is because we believe that these films can help us to make visible and better understand the diversity of the realities of Be a woman today. We believe that there are many ways to inhabit the world, that each person is marked by their experiences and context and that one of the most brutal damages of patriarchy has been to want to homologate in an stereotype what it means to be a woman or a man.\n\nFestival Internacional de Cine por mujeres\n\nThe festival wants to show the work and the standpoint of women at the five steps in the process of creating a film: creation and training > production and screening > promotion and marketing > distribution and sales > consumption of cultural goods, and accessibility.

Dreams of a life free of sexism, violence and discrimination in cinema, media and finally everywhere…\n\nFilm De Femmes\n\nBy taking the initiative to promote cinema made by women, the Festival chooses to fight against censorship and self-censorship and to open a door for film professionals on the distribution and financing circuits.

We also want to bring great lesbian films to the public eye. The desire to organise a festival grew out of discontent and frustration with the Women’s Film Festival at Créteil: despite the fact that THE lesbian film always won the People’s Choice Award (prix du public) at Créteil, hardly any space was given to lesbian films and lesbian festival goers.\n\nReel Sisters of the Diaspora Film Series\n\nReel Sisters of the Diaspora Film Festival & Lecture Series is the first Academy Award-Qualifying Festival for short narratives devoted to showcasing films produced, directed and written by women of color.

Frankfurt Women’s Film Days\n\nIn November 2018, the Kinothek Asta Nielsen in Frankfurt am Main presented the inaugural edition of Remake. Frankfurt Women’s Film Days. “Remake” refers to the connection with history that characterises all the Kinothek’s work: films spanning more than a hundred years emerge anew in the perception of viewers when they are shown today. Films exist only in their screening, so that the presentation of films is itself a form of film-making, a re-make. The formal structure of Remake corresponds to the content, whereby various epochs and genres are woven together in the programme. Topics such as women and gender relations in film, or aspects of queer cinema, come to light through their interconnection with other social phenomena, as with women’s emancipation in the context of migration, colonialism, or racism. Each edition of the Frankfurt Women’s Film Days originates in contextual links and expands in a variety of programmes.\n\nTricky Women/Tricky Realities\n\nTRICKY WOMEN/TRICKY REALITIES declared aim is to confront the world with the unlimited aesthetics of animation films made by female artists from around the world.
