        "text": "NARRATOR\n\nThere are many different types of fiction genres, but they all have one thing in common: that the stories are made up.\n\nIf these ducks were in a mystery story, then there might be a crime for a detective to solve and a mystery to work outâ¦\n\nOr if the ducks were in a science-fiction story, it might take place in a futuristic world, where everything is wildly different and fantastic.\n\nEach genre has its own style and set of rules.\n\nSo whether itâs a fairy story where the prince and princess live happily ever afterâ¦\n\nOr a scary story with frights and shocksâ¦\n\nPaying attention to genre is important when reading and understanding a story.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nMISS WILLIAMS\n\nHello, Iâm Miss Williams and today our subject is themes!\n\nA theme is a big idea that shapes a story. Often the theme is hidden away in the writing. You get hints here and there but only when youâve read the story to the end you can say what its themes are. Another way of thinking of a theme is âwhat is the story all about?â Themes are important, but invisible ideas. You canât see the power of love for instance, but itâs a theme in lots of stories. You canât see courage or determination, but they are themes youâll find in any adventure story. Mystery stories are about the themes of discovery and finding the truth.\n\nWhen you are describing the themes of a story, there are no exact right or wrong answers. Itâs a matter of opinion, your point of view. But itâs good to give reasons for what you say. Fables are very short stories told to send a message or teach a lesson. Can you guess the theme of this fable? Here we go â letâs go theme spotting!\n\nA boy who lived on the edge of a dark forest loved shouting out, âwolf! Wolf!â and seeing all his neighbours come running to save him. He laughed and laughed at how he fooled them, until one day a wolf did come. The boy shouted. âWolf! Wolf!â But nobody ran to help. And the wolf gobbled him up.\n\nOoh, that pesky wolf! But what do you think is the theme of this story? The power of love? Lies and truth? Or determination? Hmm.\n\nIf you said âlies and truthâ, then youâve understood that theme sums up what the story is all about. Hereâs another fable.\n\nA crow grabbed a big piece of cheese and flew to the top of a tall tree to eat it. A passing fox called up to the crow. âOh, you magnificent bird! A bird as beautiful as you must have a lovely voice. If only I could hear you sing!â The crow puffed itself up with pride, opened its beak and croaked âcaw! Caw!â As the cheese fell to the ground, where the fox snapped it up and strolled away.\n\nWhat is the theme of this story? Courage? Standing up for what is right? Or vanity and showing off? Hmm. If you said âvanity and showing offâ, youâve got theme spotting superpowers!\n\nHere are seven themes youâll find in lots of stories, and in poems and movies too.\n\nThe power of love;\n\ngrowing up;\n\nlearning who to trust;\n\nmisusing a great power or gift;\n\nstanding up for what is right;\n\ncourage and determination;\n\nand, the search for the truth.\n\nHow many stories, films or poems can you think of with one or more of these themes? Put me on pause, grab a pencil and make a list.\n\nOK, how did you get on? Here's my list.\n\nBeauty and the Beast. Beauty discovers that that even though the beast looks scary, he is very kind and caring, and so she marries him. Its theme is the power of love.\n\nIn The Wind in the Willows, Toad is selfish and badly behaved. But with his friendsâ help, he learns to share and take responsibility for his actions, so one of this storyâs themes is growing up.\n\nTreasure Island. Jim the cabin boy thinks Long John Silver is his friend, until he finds out Silver is a pirate who is planning to kill him. One of its themes is learning who to trust.\n\nThe Sorcererâs Apprentice. A magicianâs assistant tries out a spell when the magician is out but it goes horribly wrong! Itâs all about misusing a great power or gift.\n\nSuperhero films. Superheroes in movies have to defeat evil enemies. The films are about standing up for what is right and courage and determination. They are often in the search for the truth too. Because in their adventures, the superheroes often discover a big secret, such as where they got their powers or who their true parents are.\n\nNext time you read a story or poem, or watch a film have a think about its themes, ask yourself what important but invisible idea sums up what the story is all about. Remember you need to give a reason for what you say. When it comes to themes, itâs all about what the story means to you. For more help, challenges and games on this subject, visit BBC Bitesize."
