        "text": "Updated 24/12/2020\n\nRansom is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nContents\n\nCharacters\n\nThemes\n\nSymbols\n\nPlot, Analysis, Important Passages and Quotes\n\n1. Characters\n\nPriam\n\nPriam is an elderly king of Troy. As a child, his sister Hesione saved him from slavery, and had his named changed from Podarces to Priam, the name meaning âthe ransomed oneâ or âthe price paid'. After the death of his son Hector, Priam envisions himself in plain clothing, riding a plain cart to Achilles who is effectively holding Hector ransom. His vision is the catalyst for the novelâs events, for his journey is one of learning and self-development. Though the royal family is doubtful of his plan to save Hector, Priam is resolute and insists that he needs to try his best to confront Achilles as a father, rather than as king. After many decades as king of Troy, Priam is determined to reinvent how he will be remembered; as a king who performed an extraordinary act of heroism in order to save his beloved son.\n\nAchilles\n\nAchilles is known as the greatest warrior of the Greeks. The death of Patroclus, his closest companion and hinted lover, drives Achilles to insanity. Hector murdered Patroclus and, as a result, Achilles takes revenge by killing Hector. He then drags Hectorâs dead body along the walls of Troy for the next 11 days. Achilles loses his sense of humanity as he is possessed by his rage, hatred and grief.\n\nSomax\n\nSomax is representative of the âcommon manâ in Ransom. He is chosen to escort Priam to Achilles. His simple and plain presence is contrasted with Priamâs royal status. He often engages in useless chatter and performs daily activities in a way that is foreign to the king. Although Somax is far from royalty, his great deal of affection for his daughter-in-law and granddaughter teaches Priam about love, family and life.\n\nBeauty\n\nBeauty is Somaxâs favourite mule. She accompanies Priam and Somax on their journey to the Greek camp where Achilles resides.\n\nShock\n\nSomaxâs other mule who carries the cart to Achillesâ camp.\n\nHecuba\n\nHecuba is Priamâs beloved wife and mother of Hector. She is initially uncertain of Priamâs vision to save Hector. However, after hearing Priamâs sentimental reasons, she shows support and urges him to first share his plan with their family and the kingdomâs council before he departs.\n\nHector\n\nHector is Priamâs son and also the leader of the Trojan army. He is kind, brave and noble without any cruel intentions, unlike his rival Achilles. During a battle between the Trojans and the Greeks, Hector kills Patroclus. This results in Achilles challenging Hector to a battle, resulting in Hectorâs death and Achillesâ triumph.\n\nNeoptolemus\n\nNeoptolemus is Achillesâ son. Although he is mentioned throughout Ransom, he makes his first appearance at the end of the novel where he savagely slaughters an old and defenseless Priam in an effort to avenge his fatherâs death.â\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\nâ2. Themes\n\nIdentity\n\nRansom explores who we are and what it means to have an identity. As the leader of Troy for many decades, Priam has always viewed himself as a king. It appears as though Priam has been unhappy with his identity for quite some time, is physically weak, and feels as though he cannot protect his kingdom as efficiently as he used to. However, the death of Hector is a catalyst for Priam as he realises that he needs to become a âfatherâ rather than the âkingâ he had become so accustomed to. His search for Hector is also a search for himself, to reinvent who he is and how he wishes others to remember him.\n\nMeanwhile, Somax is designated as the kingâs herald, with the name Idaeus. He secretly notes his unhappiness with this name appointment, since he is âSomax, not Idaeus'. The name âSomaxâ is associated with many significant events in his life including his marriage and family, yet the new unfamiliar name strips him of this identity. Somaxâs confidence and pride in his identity is starkly contrasted with Priamâs pursuit for an identity transformation.\n\nChange\n\nMalouf demonstrates that it is never too late to change oneâs ways. Priamâs determination to change how he is remembered â from just another king leading a regal life to a hero who went to extraordinary lengths to regain his child â demonstrates that change is within our grasp. Even though his beautiful wife Hecuba and the rest of his family have reservations about his desire to confront Achilles, Priam is resolved in taking a âchance', rather than achieving nothing by remaining within the walls of his home. Unexpectedly, this one idea propels Priam into a multitude of other changes. His journey with Somax teaches Priam a far greater deal than he had anticipated, for he learns to appreciate the value of the human connection and other daily simplicities in life.\n\nAlthough Achilles is driven by hatred and anger after Patroclusâ death, as with Priam, he manages to change his ways. He is touched by Priamâs pleas and consequently accepts the ransom and returns Hectorâs body. He is able to reach this state of peace by releasing his immoral intentions and even offers to hold a ritual for Hectorâs body in the Greek walls that very night. This transformation, from a human who responds to grief with vengeance to someone who releases and forgives, demonstrates the benefits we can gain from amending our ways.\n\nRevenge, Guilt and Peace\n\nRevenge is portrayed as a never-ending vicious cycle until both parties reach a negotiation or peace. After Patroclusâ death, Achilles hunts down Hector in order to avenge his best friendâs early death. Although he is successful in murdering Hector, Achilles does not follow the custom of leaving the body for the grieving family to bury. Instead, Achilles feels the need to mutilate the body day after day without any sense of remorse or regret. His additional need to inflict harm on Hectorâs body indicates that revenge will not bring closure. His sense of loss is shown as he reflects feeling empty inside, to the point where he no longer feels like himself, but someone else altogether.\n\nAlthough Achilles and Priam ultimately find peace within themselves, many years later Achillesâ son Neoptolemus murders Priam, bounded by the same hatred and pain depicted by Achilles. Neoptolemusâ subsequent guilt and regret is carried with him throughout the rest of his life, demonstrating that again, revenge is not the answer to any problem.\n\nChance and Fate\n\nThe role of the gods is heavily woven into the events that unfold in Ransom. Priam only begins his transition and journey after envisioning the goddess Iris, who suggests that he take a âchanceâ and try to save Hector from Achillesâ camp. During his journey, a jovial young man who joins the travellers is revealed as Hermes, a god who has come to safely guide the elderly men to Achilles. The power of the gods in controlling human fate is illustrated during the scene where Hermes saves the travellers from being swept away by a stream.\n\nNevertheless, it can also be argued that it is the charactersâ decisions that lead them to their fate. Although the gods may have instilled in Priam the idea that he should rescue Hector, it is the kingâs determination which is a main driving force for the journey. Even when confronted with doubt and hesitancy from his family, it is Priam who pushes onwards to fulfil his vision. Whether his actions were already predestined or of his own agency is up to you to decide.\n\nNature Versus Man\n\nManâs presence on earth is shown to have little significance in comparison to the power of nature. While the events in Ransom teach the characters many valuable lessons, ultimately these meaningful moments in the humansâ lives disappear as one reaches their fate â death. Time moves on beyond our lives as we are forgotten over decades and centuries while nature prevails. Priamâs desire to be remembered by others highlights how little significance a life possesses unless one behaves extraordinarily. Malouf demonstrates that in the end, life just is â we are granted by nature to have a brief existence, yet in the end, nature and time will move forward without us.\n\nCommoners Versus Royalty\n\nAlthough royalty is portrayed to be blessed with power and authority, it is ironically the commoners in Ransom who appear to have the ârichestâ (and more fulfilling) lives. For the first time, Priam is exposed to the different interests and values of the common man and is intrigued by the simplicities of life. It is Somax, a mere old man from the marketplace, who teaches Priam more about life than he had imagined possible.\n\n3. Symbols\n\nJoveâs Eagle\n\nJoveâs eagle is a representation of a bird renowned for its keen sight. The presence of Joveâs eagle during Priam and Somaxâs departure hints that the gods will safely guide their journey as the bird behaves as a lookout. Furthermore, the symbol of the eagleâs powerful vision is contrasted with Priamâs âblindnessâ at the beginning of the journey since he is yet to experience the outside world. It is during the journey that he learns about himself and others, and thus, improves his âsight.â Coincidently, Joveâs eagle is no longer mentioned when Priam is endowed with his new insight.\n\nCart\n\nThe royal cart is âa fine new one, the marks of the adze still visible on its timbers. The twelve-spoked wheels are elaborately carved and painted, a wickerwork canopy covers the tray'. On all occasions, the king had used this elegant cart to alert others that royalty was present. The use of this cart demonstrates how Priam has been encapsulated in his own royal sphere since everything is meticulously chosen and designed specifically for the king. Nevertheless, his demand for a âcommon work cartâ depicts his determination for a simple approach to Achilles, as a father to another father. This simplicity highlights Priamâs desire to become just another man and father, anonymous in the plain cart with the hopes of retrieving Hector.\n\nPriam as a Child\n\nAt the beginning of the journey, Priam is characterised with childish traits. When Somax urges Priam to dabble his feet in the stream, words such as âobedient toddler', âthree uncertain steps', and âhappy smileâ reflect the actions of a young child trying new experiences. This childish nature is contrasted with Priamâs old and frail age, which demonstrates that although he has lived a life in royalty, his lack of exposure to âreal lifeâ has left him crippled of the simplest experiences such as the cooling effect of feet in water and eating delicious homemade cookies.\n\nCakes\n\nThe cakes Somax brings along during the journey highlight Priamâs lack of knowledge of even the simplest things. For Somax, the little griddlecakes are a regular and delectable snack, yet Priam 'ha[s] never seen them before'. Priamâs unfamiliarity with the cakes represents his isolation from the âreal worldâ since he has been deprived from things that even commoners view as ordinary.\n\nFuthermore, Somaxâs lengthy chatter about his daughter-in-law cooking the cakes with the âbatter bubbling and setting and turning a golden brownâ prompts Priam to think about the activities in his kingdom that occur behind closed doors. He had previously never noticed that there was so much preparation and work that went into the food that appeared at his table, let alone the ingredients and thickness of a batter. These matters had been of little concern to Priam, yet he realises that even the âcommon and lowâ¦activities and facts of life, had an appeal'.\n\nHectorâs Body\n\nAlthough Achilles drags Hectorâs body across the walls of Troy for eleven days, each morning he would return to find Hectorâs body healed of any wounds, and absent of any physical damage to his body. This is a cruel reminder of the godâs ability to âtoy aroundâ with the Ancient Greeksâ lives. Hectorâs body also symbolises how revenge is not the answer to any conflict, since dealing with a tragic loss through revenge does not gain anything but more pain and suffering.\n\nSniffing\n\nAlthough Priam initially believes he understands the distress of losing a son, Somaxâs experience of losing his son is driven with emotions that Priam had never previously experienced. When sharing the story of his sonâs death, Somax sniffles, an âodd habitâ according to Priam. The use of âodd habitâ to describe Somaxâs sadness demonstrates how Priam has never truly felt the loss of his son, but only the loss of a royal relationship between king and prince.\n\nLater on, Somax once again âsnufflesâ and ârubs his noseâ at the thought of the ending to their journey. Similarly, Priam makes âsmall sounds', presumably crying as well. The transformation of Priam from someone who failed to empathise with Somaxâs tears at the beginning of the journey to a man filled with emotions demonstrates that Priam undergoes both a physical and metaphysical journey where he undergoes self-development and appreciation of the world around him.\n\n4. Plot, Analysis, Important Passages and Quotes\n\nChapter I\n\nPlot\n\nAchilles, the greatest warrior of the Greeks, stands next to the sea while reminiscing about the past. After his motherâs death he had âentered the rough world of menâ (p. 6) where wars and battles prevail. Every morning, he feels the need to âtramp to shoreâ (p. 10) since he is haunted by the death of his âsoulmate and companionâ Patroclus, and his raging hatred towards Hector, killer of Patroclus and thus, the âimplacable enemy'.\n\nWhen Achilles was a child, his cousin Patroclus came to live with the young Achilles since the former had killed the son of a high official of the royal court due to a âquarrel over a game of knucklebonesâ (p. 11). In need of asylum, Patroclus came to live with Achillesâ family. As the years passed, the pair grew closer to the extent where Achilles believes that âhe had mated with Patroclusâ (p. 15).\n\nWhen the tide of the battle was against the Greeks, Patroclus disguises himself in Achillesâ armour in order to instill fear in the Trojans and cause them to return to the safety of their walls, thus providing temporary relief for the Greeks. In his last act for his closest friend, Patroclus is killed in battle*. The death of Patroclus left Achilles with an overwhelming sense of loss and also burning animosity. Achilles whispers that he will join Patroclus soon, but firstly, he has to avenge Patroclusâ killer, Hector.\n\nHector, the son of Trojan king Priam and leader of the Trojan army, wore Achilles' armour as a sign of triumph and disrespect for the Greeks. In a dramatic battle between Hector and himself, Achilles was successful in killing his enemy. Achillesâ Myrmidons then stripped Hector of his armour and âwithout pityâ¦plunged their swords into Hectorâs unprotected fleshâ (p. 24). For Achilles however, this was not enough. Still fuelled by his pain, Achilles ties Hectorâs body to a chariot and drags it âup and down under the walls of Troyâ (p. 26) as the dead warriorâs royal family devastatingly watches on. Achilles feels like a âdead manâ¦feeling nothingâ (p. 26), unable to seal the void left by his beloved friend.\n\nThe next day, Achilles is furious to find Hectorâs body âsmoothly sealed and the torn flesh made whole again'. His men cannot bear to look at him as he drives the chariot with Hectorâs body along the walls of the Trojans once again. Afterwards he quickly falls asleep, into âoblivionâ (p. 35) as he struggles with the shame and guilt of his actions. He is âwaiting for a breakâ¦something new and unimaginableâ in his life.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Human Side\n\nAlong with the conflict between Greece and Troy, Ransom also delves into the consequences of those affected by the war. As the greatest warrior of all Greeks, Achilles has lived his life as a fighter. Nevertheless, his pathway in life has led him to believe that âsuch a life is death to the warrior spiritâ (p. 7). While warriors are known for sacrificing their lives in the battlefield, Achilles does not literally refer to warriors confronting death each time they fight for their team. In fact, âdeath to the warrior spiritâ means to metaphorically lose what it means to âliveâ when one experiences bloodshed in each war. Growing up surrounded by âthe rough world of menâ (p. 6), Achilles develops traits of aggression, cruelty and vengefulness in order to become an implacable man of war. As a consequence, Achilles only knows how to deal with Patroclusâ death with a fighterâs mindset. Instead of grieving openly, âhe never permit[s] himself to betray to others what he [feels]â (p. 5), thus detaching himself from the natural human process of grieving. In order to deal with his friendâs tragic ending, Achilles' âsoul chang[es] colourâ as drags Hectorâs body for eleven days without any sense of regret or remorse, and thus, is referred to as âdeath to his human spiritâ since he was no longer âa living manâ (p. 27). He faces Patroclusâ death with the same warrior traits of aggression, cruelty and vengefulness, depriving himself of any ability to humanely mourn his close friendâs death.\n\nFurthermore, Achilles grieves for his mother in the opening passages of Ransom. During this time of loss, his mother symbolises Achillesâ need to be nurtured. The imagery of the sea surface as a âbellyâ and âa membrane stretched to a fine transparencyâ (p. 3) represents his motherâs pregnancy where he âhad hung curled in a dream of pre-existenceâ for ânine changes of the moonâ â or in other words, nine months of pregnancy. Achilles is characterised as a foetus, for his position is âchin down, shoulders hunchedâ as though he is inside a womb. Although Achilles is a fighter, he hides the fact that he wishes to be ârocked and comfortedâ by his mother, thus demonstrating that even beneath the surface of a cold-hearted warrior, the current of human emotions can cripple a manâs confident veneer.\n\nIf you'd like to read more of my analysis, feel free to access a sample of our ebook A Killer Text Guide: Ransom.

Summary\n\nGo Went Gone revolves around an unlikely connection between a retired universityÂ professor, Richard, and a group of asylum seekers who come from all over the African continent. While heâs enjoyed a life of stability and privilege as a white male citizen, the lives of these asylum seekers could not be more different: no matter where they are in the world, uncertainty seems to follow. Richard initially sets out to learn their stories, but he is very quickly drawn into their histories of tragedy, as well as their dreams for the future.Â\n\nHowever, the more he tries to help them, the more he realises what heâs up against: a potent mix of stringent legal bureaucracy and the ignorance of his peers. These obstacles are richly interwoven with the novelâs context in post-reunification Germany (more on this under Symbols: Borders), but bureaucracy and ignorance are everywhere - Australia included. This novel, therefore, bears reflection on our own relationship with the refugees who seek protection and opportunity on our shores - refugees who are virtually imprisoned and cut off from the world.\n\nRichard ultimately realises that these men are simply people, people who have the same complexities and inconsistencies as anyone else. They sometimes betray his trust; at other times, they help him in return despite their socio-economic standing. The end of the novel is thus neither perfect nor whole - while the asylum seekers develop a relationship with Richard and vice versa, neither is able to entirely solve the otherâs problems, though both learn how to be there for each other in their own ways. We donât get many solutions to everything the refugees are facing, but what we end up with is a lesson or two in human empathy.Â\n\nThe title of Jenny Erpenbeckâs novel Go Went Gone is a line she weaves into a couple of scenes. In one example, a group of asylum seekers in a repurposed nursing home learn to conjugate the verb in German. In another, a retired university professor reflects on this group, about to be relocated to another facility.\n\n2. Themes\n\nPrivilege\n\nThe various privileges Richard holds shape his identity in this text. It shapes how he approaches his retirement for example: now that âhe has timeâ, he plans to spend it on highbrow pursuits like reading Proust and Dostoyevsky or listening to classical music. On the other hand, the asylum seekers sleep most of the time: âif you donât sleep through half the morning, [a day] can be very long indeed.â Richard has the freedom to choose to spend his time on hobbies, but the asylum seekers face a daunting and seemingly-impossible array of tasks. After getting to know them more, he realises that while his to-do list includes menial things like âschedule repairman for dishwasherâ, the refugees face daunting socio-political problems like needing to âeradicate corruptionâ.Â\n\nFreedom in general is a useful way to think about privilege in this text, and besides freedom to choose how you spend your time, this can also look like the freedom to tell your story. While Richard helps the men with this to some degree, even he has a limited amount of power here (and power can be another useful way of thinking about privilege). Richard realises that âpeople with the freedom to chooseâ¦get to decide which stories to hold on toâ - and those are the people who get to decide the future of the refugees, at least from a legal perspective.Â\n\nEmpathy\n\nThough Richard canât necessarily help with these legal issues, he finds himself doing what he can for the refugees over time. He demonstrates a willingness to help them in quite substantial ways sometimes, for example buying a piece of land in Ghana for Karon and his family. In the end, we see him empathising with the refugees enough to offer them housing: though he is not a lawyer, he still finds ways to use his privilege for good and share what he can. He taps into his networks and finds housing for 147 refugees.Â\n\nThe tricky thing with empathy though is that itâs never one-sided, not in this book and not in real life either. Itâs not simply a case of Richard taking pity on the refugees - we might think of this as sympathy rather than empathy - but he develops complex, reciprocal and ârealâ friendships with all of them. This can challenge him, and us, and our assumptions about what is right. When Richard loses his wallet at the store, Rufu offers to pay for him. He initially insists he âcanât acceptâ, but when he does Rufu doesnât let him pay him back in full. Erpenbeck challenges us to empathise without dehumanising, condescending or assuming anything in the process.Â\n\nItâs an interesting way to think about social justice in general, particularly if you consider yourself an âallyâ of a marginalised group - how can we walk with people rather than speak for them and what they want?\n\nMovementÂ\n\nFreedom of movement is sort of a form of privilege, but movement as a theme of its own is substantial enough to need a separate section. There are lots of different forms of movement in the novel, in particular movement between countries. In particular, itâs what brought the refugees to Germany at all, even though they didnât necessarily have any control over that movement.\n\nContrast that with Richardâs friends, JÃ¶rg and Monika, who holiday in Italy and benefit from âfreedom of movement [as] the right to travelâ. Through this lens, we can see that this is really more of a luxury that the refugees simply do not have. Refugees experience something closer to forced displacement, rather than free travel, moving from one âtemporary placeâ to the next often outside of their control. In this process, their lack of control often means they lose themselves in the rough-and-tumble of it all: âBecoming foreign. To yourself and others. So thatâs what a transition looks like.â\n\n3. Symbols & Analysis\n\nLanguage and the Law\n\nMany of the barriers faced by the refugees are reflected in their relationships with language; that is, their experiences learning German mirrors and sheds light on their relationship with other elements of German society. For example, there are times when they struggle to concentrate on learning: âItâs difficult to learn a language if you donât know what itâs forâ. This struggle reflects and symbolises the broader problems of uncertainty, unemployment and powerlessness in the menâs lives.\n\nThe symbol of language often intersects with the symbol of the âiron lawâ, so these are discussed together here. Itâs hard on the one hand for these men to tell their stories in German, but itâs also hard for the German law to truly grapple with their stories. Indeed, Richard finds that the law doesnât care if there are wars going on abroad or not: it only cares about âjurisdictionâ, and about which country is technically responsible for the refugees. In this sense, the law mirrors and enables the callousness which runs through the halls of power - not to deter you from learning law if you want though! This might just be something to be aware of, and maybe something youâd want to change someday.Â\n\nThereâs one law mentioned in the novel stating that asylum seekers can simply be accepted âif a country, a government or a mayor so wishesâ, but that one word in particular - âifâ - puts all the power in lawyers and politicians who know the language and the law and how to navigate it all. These symbols thus reflect power and privilege.Â\n\nBorders (+ Historical Context)\n\nThroughout the novel, thereâs a sense that borders between countries are somewhat arbitrary things. They can âsuddenly become visibleâ and just as easily disappear; sometimes theyâre easy to cross, sometimes theyâre impossible to cross. Sometimes itâs easy physically, but harder in other ways - once you cross a border, you need housing, food, employment and so forth.\n\nThis complex understanding of borders draws on the history of Germany, and in particular of its capital Berlin, after World War II. After the war, Western powers (USA, UK, France) made a deal with the Soviet Union to each run half of Germany and half of Berlin. The Eastern half of Germany, and the Eastern half of Berlin, fell under Soviet control, and as East Germans started flocking to the West in search of better opportunities (sound familiar?), the Soviets built a wall around East Berlin. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, became a border of its own, dividing a nation and a city and changing the citizenship of half of Germany overnight. Attempts to escape from the East continued for many years until the wall came down in 1989, changing all those citizenships right back, once again virtually overnight.\n\nThis history adds dimension to Erpenbeckâs novel. Refugees pass through many countries, but Erpenbeck draws on Germanyâs history specifically as a once-divided nation itself. This helps to illustrate that national borders are just another arbitrary technicality that divides people, at the expense of these refugees.Â\n\nBodies of Water\n\nOne motif that comes back a few times in the novel is the drowned man in the lake by Richardâs house. This has a few layers of meaning.\n\nFirstly, the man drowns despite the lake being a perfectly âplacidâ body of water, and for whatever reason, this bothers Richard immensely: âhe canât avoid seeing the lakeâ. Thereâs an interesting contrast here to be drawn between this one death in a still body of water and the hundreds of deaths at sea that are recounted in the novel. Rashidâs stories are particularly confronting: âUnder the water I saw all the corpsesâ. Erpenbeck questions the limits of human empathy - whose deaths are we more affected by, and why - through contrasting these different bodies of water, and those who die within them. Richard is more affected than most, who visit the lake all summer leaving âjust as happy as they cameâ - but even he has his limits with how much he can see and understand.Â\n\nThe next layer of meaning with this symbol then is more around the surface of the water itself: it is significant that in Rashidâs story, the casualties are below the surface. This reflects the common saying, âthe tip of the icebergâ - the survivors who make it to Europe are really just the tip of the iceberg, only representing a fraction of the refugee experience. Often, that experience ends in death. Erpenbeck asks us to keep looking beneath the surface in order to empathise in full.Â\n\nMusic and the Piano\n\nThis symbol is specific to Richardâs relationship with Osarobo, to whom he teaches the piano. Thereâs one scene where this symbolism is particularly powerful, where they watch videos of pianists âus[ing] the black and white keys to tell stories that have nothing at all to do with the keysâ colours.â\n\nIt speaks to the power of music to bring people together, and also to the importance of storytelling in any form: Rosa Canales argues the keysâ colours, and the colour of the fingers playing them, âbecome irrelevant to the stories emanating from beneath themâ.\n\n4. Quotes\n\nLanguage\n\nâWhat languages can you speak?â\n\nâThe German language is my bridge into this countryâÂ\n\nâEmpty phrases signify politeness in a language which neither of them is at homeâÂ\n\nPrivilege\n\nâThe things youâve experienced become baggage you canât get rid of, while others - people with the freedom to choose - get to decide which stories to hold on toâ\n\nâHe hears Apolloâs voice saying: They give us money, but what I really want is work. He hears Tristanâs voice saying: Poco lavoro. He hears the voice of Osaboro, the piano player, saying: Yes, I want to work but it is not allowed. The refugeesâ protest has created half-time jobs for at least twelve Germans thus farâÂ\n\nBorders\n\nâNot so long ago, Richard thinks, this story of going abroad to find one's fortune was a German oneâ\n\nâIs it a rift between Black and White? Or Poor and Rich?âÂ\n\nâWhere can a person go when he doesn't know where to go?âÂ\n\n5. Discussion Questions\n\nHere are some questions to think about before diving into essay-writing. Thereâs no right or wrong answer to any of these, and most will draw on your own experiences or reflections anyway. You may want to write some answers down, and brainstorm links between your responses and the novel. These reflections could be particularly useful if youâre writing a creative response to the text, but theyâre also a really good way to get some personal perspective and apply the themes and lessons of this novel into your own life.\n\nWhere do you âsitâ in the world? What privileges do you have or lack? What can you do that others cannot, and what can others do that you cannot?\n\nThink about the times youâve travelled around the world - how many of those times were by choice? What might be the impact of moving across the world against your will?\n\nHow do you show empathy to others? How do you receive empathy from others? What is that relationship âsupposedâ to look like?\n\nWhat are some different names for where you live? How can you describe the same place in different languages or words? If youâre in Australia, what was your area called before 1788?\n\nHave you ever learned or spoken a language other than English? What language do you find easier to write, speak and think with? How might this impact someoneâs ability to participate in different parts of life (school, work, friendships etc.)?\n\n6.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nIn what ways do the people Richard meets challenge his assumptions about the world?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis prompt alludes to certain assumptions that Richard might make about the world. If itâs hard to think of these off the top of your head, consider where our assumptions about the world come from: maybe from our jobs, our families and friends or our past experiences. Maybe there are some assumptions youâve had in the past that youâve since noticed or challenged.Â\n\nThen it asks us how the people Richard meets challenges those assumptions. Thereâs no way to get out of this question without discussing the refugees, so this will inform our brainstorm.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nI think some of Richardâs assumptions at the beginning come from his status: being a professor emeritus makes you pretty elite, and he canât really empathise with the refugees because his experiences of life are so different. Part of the challenge with this prompt might be to break down what life experiences entail, and where those differences lie: particularly because itâs asking us âin what waysâ. These experiences could be with language, employment, or personal relationships just to name a few ideas.Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nBecause Richardâs life experiences are so vastly different, Iâd contend that his assumptions are challenged in basically every way. However, I also think that his interest in the refugees exists because he knows they can challenge his assumptions. I want to use the motif of water surfaces to tie this argument together, particularly in the topic sentences, and this could look as follows:\n\nParagraph 1: Richard realises that he only has a âsurface-levelâ appreciation of the refugeesâ life experiences.\n\nHe realises that he knows little about the African continent (âNigeria has a coast?â)Â\n\nHe suffers from a âpoverty of experienceâ which means he hasnât had to interact with this knowledge before\n\nHis renaming of the refugees (Apollo, Tristan etc.) suggests that he still needs his own frame of reference to understand their experiences\n\nHe learns about the hardships of migration through the tragic stories of those like Rashid\n\nParagraph 2: He also realises that he has a âsurface-levelâ understanding of migration in general.\n\nThis comes from the fact that he has never actually moved countries; heâs only been reclassified as an East German, and then again as a German. Neither happened because he wanted them to.\n\nOn the other hand, the refugees want to settle in Europe: they want the right to work and make a living - itâs just that the âiron lawâ acts as a major barrier. Their powerlessness is different from Richardâs.\n\nPart of migration is also learning the language, and Richard is initially quite ignorant about this: he observes that the Ethiopian German teacher âfor whatever reason speaks excellent Germanâ, not realising this is necessary for any migrant to survive in the new country.\n\nWe can think of this as the difference between migration and diaspora, the specific term for the dispersion of a people.\n\nParagraph 3: Richard is more open than most people to looking beneath the surface though, meaning that his assumptions are challenged partly because he is willing for them to be.\n\nThe symbol of the lake works well here to explain this: he is bothered by its still surface, and what lies underneath, while others arenât\n\nWe can also contrast this to characters like Monika and JÃ¶rg who remain quite ignorant the whole time: Richardâs views have departed from this throughout the course of the novel\n\nUltimately, the novel is about visibility: Richardâs incorrect assumptions mean that he isnât seeing reality, and his âresearch projectâ is all about making that reality visible.Â\n\nâGo Went Gone is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

More fancy language. Hasnât he been dead for centuries? Why does he keep popping up in our English curriculum?â\n\nAt least, thatâs how I reacted.\n\nShakespeare is actually a huge figure in the history of the English language, and really no high school English curriculum is complete without a mandatory dose of him. In fact, the current VCAA study design demands that one of his texts must be on the text list. What a legend.\n\nShakespeare doesnât only influence our world in the classroom. The Bard coined many words and phrases that we use today. We can thank this playwright for âbe -all, end-allâ, âgood riddanceâ, and my personal favourite, âswaggerâ.\n\nThe Bardâs play âMeasure for Measureâ was first performed in 1604; over 400 years ago. So why do we still study his works today? In fact, the ideas and themes that are evoked in his plays are universal and timeless; pertinent to his contemporary counterparts, as well as todayâs audience. Shakespeareâs plays are like soup (bear with me, this is going somewhere). One could say the playwright is a master chef; he mixes tales of the human condition and experience and asks us to question people and ideas. Everyone, regardless of their time, will gobble up the story.\n\nSo, what is this soup- I mean âMeasure for Measureâ about? The play is known as a âproblem playâ and/or âtragicomedyâ. Thatâs right, itâs both a tragedy and a comedy. Dire trials and tribulations are intertwined with humorous gags and jokesters. I guess Shakespeare couldnât choose just one. Â\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ is also a problem play. Critic W.W Lawrence defined a problem play as one in which \"a perplexing and distressing complication in human life is presented in a spirit of high seriousness ... the theme is handled so as to arouse not merely interest or excitement, or pity or amusement, but to probe the complicated interrelations of character and action, in a situation admitting of different ethical interpretations\".\n\nOk, crazy, but he also said that \"the 'problem' is not like one in mathematics, to which there is a single true solution, but is one of conduct, as to which there are no fixed and immutable laws. Often it cannot be reduced to any formula, any one question, since human life is too complex to be so neatly simplified.â\n\nIn short, a problem play presents lots of complications and issues that are open to different ethical interpretations. As in âMeasure for Measureâ, the âproblem(s)â is/are not always solved.\n\nSo, what actually happens in this play that is problematic? What are our ingredients in this problem soup?\n\nâP(L)OT SUMMARY\n\nGet it? Cause soup is cooked in a pot. Sorry.\n\nThe Duke of Vienna appoints his deputy, Angelo, as the temporary leader. This Duke then pretends to leave town but instead dresses up as a friar to observe what happens in his absence. Angelo, strict and unwavering in his dedication to following the rules, decides to rid Vienna of all the unlawful sexual activity; including shutting down the brothels. Prostitutes like Mistress Overdone (pun alert) and her pimp Pompey are poised to lose their livelihoods. Laws against this activity exist, but theyâve gotten lax over the years. Angelo, a stickler for the rules, has Claudio arrested because young Claudio has gotten his engaged wife-to-be (Juliet) pregnant before they were officially married. Claudio is to be executed.\n\nThe virtuous Isabella, Claudioâs sister, is poised to enter a nunnery. Upon hearing of her brotherâs arrest and sentence, she goes to Angelo to beg him for mercy. He hypocritically, in an absolutely dog move, propositions her, saying heâll pardon her brother if she sleeps with him (with Angelo, not Claudio). She immediately refuses, being the religious and chaste woman that she is. At first Claudio is upset because he wants to live, but then he calms down and accepts death.\n\nLuckily, the Duke (secretly dressed as a friar) helps in their sticky situation. He brews up a plan; Angeloâs former flame Mariana was engaged to him, but he broke off their engagement after she lost her dowry in a shipwreck. The Friar (Duke) plans to have Isabella agree to sleep with Angelo, but then send Mariana in her place. In theory, Angelo would pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana by law.\n\nThe old switcheroo goes off without a hitch. But come morning, Angelo refuses to pardon Claudio, fearing he will seek revenge. The Duke, in collaboration with the Provost, send Angelo the head of a dead pirate (Ragozine) who died of natural causes. They claim that itâs Claudioâs head, and Angelo is satisfied, thinking him to be dead. Isabella is also told that her brother is dead and is encouraged by the Friar (Duke) to complain about Angelo to the Duke, who is returning home. Â\n\nThe Duke makes a grand return to Vienna, saying he will hear any complaints immediately. Isabella tells her story, and the Duke feigns disbelief, despite having orchestrated the plan himself. In an act filled with more twists and turns than a Marvel movie, everything comes out; the Duke reveals he was a friar all along, Angelo is forced to confess, and Claudio is pardoned amongst other things. To top it all off, the Duke proposes to Isabella. Crazy!\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nItâs important to acknowledge what was going on in the world during the writing of a text. This may help give insight into why the author has included (or not included) some aspect of their work.\n\nThe Divine Right of Kings\n\nThis holy mandate states that a monarch derives his right to rule from the will of God and is not subject to earthly authority. The âkingâ or monarch is hence practically divine, and questioning his orders is also questioning god; blasphemy.\n\nThe Great Chain of Being/Class divides\n\nThis chain is a hierarchy of all life forms and matter in the following order:\n\nGod\n\nAngels\n\nKings & Royalty\n\nNobles\n\nCommoners (Gentry, Merchants, Yeoman, Laborers)\n\nSlaves\n\nAnimals\n\nPlants\n\nNon-living things\n\nHence, alongside The Divine Right of Kings, this ideal gave monarchs huge power over their subjects.\n\nIn early 1600s England, there was a defined social hierarchy and class system. Everyone had a place in the hierarchy, and there was little movement between the classes. Within each class, men were considered superior to women.\n\nShakespeare encourages us to ask a few questions of our supposedly holy leader and his actions. According to the Divine Right of Kings, the Duke is godâs right-hand man, and thus all his decisions are holy and backed by heaven. However, the Duke is pretty shady when he plots his bed-trick plan with Isabella and Mariana. Is this deceptive behavior still holy? Furthermore, is it not sacrilege to pretend to be a holy friar when one is not truly a holy man?\n\nMoreover, when the Duke assigns Angelo as his deputy, would this transform Angelo into a divine ruler too? Could he be divine, considering his cruel rule and despicable request to Isabella?\n\nWomen\n\nWomen were considered subservient, lower class citizens then men. Alliances were forged between powerful families through arranged marriages of daughters. These girls may have received an education through tutors attending their homes (there were no schools for girls), but their endgame would be marriage, children and maintaining the home. Women and girls of a lower class did not receive any formal education but would have learned how to govern a household and become skilled in all housewifely duties. Impoverished and desperate women (Mistress Overdone) would turn to prostitution to stay alive.\n\nShakespeare perhaps highlights the struggle of women in his female characters; Isabella, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, and Kate Keepdown. Their futures appear bleak; Isabella is poised to enter a nunnery, Julietâs husband (her only source of income and protection) is to be executed, while the brothels that facilitate Mistress Overdone and Kate Keepdownâs livelihoods are being closed down by Angelo.\n\nJacobean Audience\n\nIt was a tumultuous time when Shakespeare penned âMeasure for Measureâ in 1604. A year earlier came the end of the 45 year long Elizabethan era and began the Jacobean era under the rule of King James. Since the late Queen Elizabeth had no direct heirs, King James of Scotland (a relative) took to the throne. Little was known by the English people of this foreign king.\n\nPerhaps, as Shakespeare portrays the ruler in âMeasure for Measureâ as clever and good-hearted, the Bard sought to appease the king by calming the people and encouraging them to trust in their new monarch.\n\nThe playwright characterizes the Duke as loving his people, but not enjoying being before their eyes and in the spotlight; much like King James, a quiet ruler who relished studying privately in his great library.\n\nâPlayhouses and Brothels\n\nThe general public (commoners) paid a penny (could buy you a loaf of bread back in the day) to see Shakespeareâs plays, standing in the âyardâ; on the ground, at eye-level of the stage. The rich (gentry) paid 2 pennies for seating in the galleries, often using cushions. The really rich (nobles) could watch the play from a chair set on the side of the stage itself. Shakespeareâs plays were performed at the Globe Theatre. Playhouses in Shakespeare's time were often close to brothels, both in terms of their physical locations in the suburbs and the way they were viewed by some of polite society. Thus, Shakespeare's relatively sympathetic portrayal of sexual deviance in âMeasure for Measureâ may also constitute a defence of other suburban entertainmentâhis playsâand a way to humanize lower classes who patronized them.\n\nWRITING ABOUT 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE'\n\nIf youâre lucky enough to study this interesting piece, the study design requires you to prepare âsustained analytical interpretationsâ¦discussing how features of the text create meaning and using textual evidence to support (your) reasonsâ. Basically, youâll be given a topic; this topic could surround themes, characters, etc., and you must write analytically.\n\nWhile you may choose to structure paragraphs around themes, ideas or characters, make sure to embed some historical context in there; thatâll show the examiner that youâve done your research and have a thorough and deeper understanding of why Shakespeare put this or that in. Talking about authorial intent in your analytical essay leads to a more in-depth analysis.\n\nâShakespeare portrays characters that are flawed as a result of pre-destined circumstances. These characters, such as bawd Pompey and prostitute Mistress Overdone, lived in a time when there existed strong class divides, and movement within the social hierarchy was rare. As per the âGreat Chain of Beingâ, a contemporary religious dogma, there was a hierarchy of all living things and matter, from lofty God and his angels down through the ranks of men and finally to animals and non-living things. In some cases, attempting to move up the social ranks was even considered a blasphemous rejection of the fate chosen by God.â\n\n- embedding historical context (The Great Chain of Being) into a paragraph that discusses characters being flawed because of their circumstances\n\nâShakespeare offers characters such as Isabella and The Duke who strive for self-improvement through understanding and temperance. Perhaps the playwright suggests that perfection is very difficult if not impossible to attain, even for a ruler like the Duke and a pure soul like Isabella. However, he posits that it can be strived for and that perhaps this attempt to become better is what truly matters.â\n\n- talking about authorial intent - what is Shakespeare trying to tell us?\n\nThink of it as an opportunity to make your very own soup! Add some themes, stir in character analysis, sprinkle in some quotes and serve with historical context and authorial intent. Just like with a soup, thereâs got be a good balance of all your ingredients; test out different structures during the year to find what works for you.

Well...). Keep on reading this blog post, where weâll delve into themes, characters and symbols/motifs. In the meantime, letâs have a break. Grab a snack, a drink, and enjoy this tasty Shakespeare meme.\n\n...Aaaaand weâre back!\n\nAre you ready for part 2 of the Shakespeare train? Hop on board as we explore themes, characters and symbols/motifs.ââ\n\nTHEMESâ\n\nThese are the major themes in âMeasure for Measureâ.\n\nAs you can see, the themes are interconnected. (Do you like the diagram? Made it myself :)) Why does this matter? Well, if you get an essay topic about Justice, for instance, you can also link it to Sexual and Gender Politics as well as Social Decay/Cohesion.\n\nSo, why is any one theme an important theme?\n\nWhich moments and characters are these themes related to?\n\nIs there a link to historical context?\n\nWhat are some key quotes?\n\nWhat could be Shakespeareâs potential message? (Keep in mind that depending which pieces of evidence you look at, the Bard could be saying something different. In this piece, weâll only discuss one or two authorial messages. The beauty of Shakespeare is that much is open to interpretation. You can interpret characters and ideas in so many different ways!)\n\nThose are some great questions. Letâs explore some of the biggest themes...\n\nPower and Authority\n\nPower not only dictates the Viennese society, but we see it is a basis for moral corruption (Iâm looking at you, Angelo!). The Duke is the leader of Vienna, ordained by God. He hands this power to his deputy Angelo, who misuses it in his request of Isabella. Now consider Isabella - she has power too, but a different kindâ¦ Also consider characters who have little to no power - Mistress Overdone, Pompey etc.\n\nThis theme could be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Women.\n\nâO, it is excellent to have a giantâs strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giantâ - Isabella when she pleads to Angelo to not kill her brother (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 130-132)\n\nâHe who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severeâ - The Friar (Duke) to himself, not happy with Angeloâs dog move (Act 3, Scene 1, 538-539)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\n\"Hence we shall see, if power change purpose, what our seemers be.â - The Duke lowkey suggesting that once Angelo gets power, heâll change into something evil (Act 1, Scene 4, Line 57)\n\nâSome rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.â - Escalus is sneakily hating on Angelo. This quote shows that power and authority often involve corruption (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 41)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare is suggesting that power is a dangerous weapon and that in the wrong hands, it could be deadly.\n\nMorality and Sin\n\nThis is an interesting theme. What defines sin? For instance, if Isabella sleeps with Angelo sheâs sinning before God. But if she doesnât, then sheâs letting her brother die, which is not good either. Bit of a pickle that one. Some characters to consider include Isabella, Angelo, The Duke, Claudio, Lucio, the Provostâ¦. jeez just about everyone! So many of the characters take part in questionable deeds. Was it immoral for the Duke to pretend to be a holy friar? Is Claudioâs sin of impregnating Juliet really punishable by death if both parties were willing, and no one else has been punished for the same âcrimeâ? Are Pompey and Mistress Overdone being immoral in being in the prostitution business, if itâs the only way to survive?\n\nDeep stuff man. This can be linked back to class divides, women and the contemporary playhouses/brothels.\n\nâWhat sin you do to save a brotherâs life, nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtueâ - Claudio begs his sister to sleep with Angelo (immoral, especially since sheâs poised to enter a nunnery), saying that itâs for a good cause, and will actually be a virtue/good deed (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 146-148)\n\nâMight there not be a charity in sin to save this brotherâs life?â - Angelo asking Isabella to sleep with him and trying to paint the act as a charitable deed (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 65-66)\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stickâ - Lucio, who represents sin and immorality in Vienna (weâll talk more about this later in symbols/motifs) (Act 4, Scene 3, Line 182)\n\nâTo bring you thus together âtis no sin, sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit.â - The Friar (Duke), encouraging Isabella and Mariana to do the dodgy bed-trick and trick Angelo (Act 4, Scene 1, Line 79-81)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare tries to tell us that there is a fine line between something moral and something sinful. Maybe heâs asking, âwho are we to judge?â, since we all do questionable things sometimes. Everyone from the almighty Duke to a lowly prostitute has committed potentially immoral acts. Perhaps audiences are encouraged to be more understanding of others, and their reasons for these deeds.\n\nJustice\n\nMmm, this theme ties in nicely with just about all of the others. How does one define justice? The play explores this idea; does justice mean punishment? Or mercy? How do we balance the two to deliver the right punishment/lack thereof? Characters that dispense justice include The Duke, Angelo (although they have differing ideas of justice) and Isabella. Since Vienna is a religious place, consider the divine justice system (ie. a perfect, flawless system meted out by God) and the earthly one (ie. the flawed, human justice system). Laws exist in an attempt to ensure justice. But does it always work? Consider also the Old and New Testament ways of thinking - the former strict and punitive, while the latter is more measured and merciful (see symbols/motifs below for more info).\n\nThis theme can be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, Great Chain of Being, Women, and Jacobean Audience.\n\nâJustice, justice, justice, justice!â - (Wait, are you sure this quote is about justice?) Isabella pleads for (you guessed it) justice to the Duke (no longer dressed as a friar), thinking Angelo has, in fact, killed her brother (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 26)\n\nâThe very mercy of the law cried outâ¦ âAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!â Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure, like doth quit like, and measure still for measureâ - The Duke, explaining that itâs only fair that Angelo die for âkillingâ Claudio. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 437-441)\n\nâliberty plucks justice by the noseâ - The Duke tells Friar Thomas that the laws have slipped over the years, and the citizens of Vienna are not being punished for immoral deeds (prostitution, sex before marriage etc)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare says that since we humans are inevitably flawed, that any justice system created by us will too be imperfect. Who are we to decide the fates of our fellow man? Furthermore, the Bard may be encouraging us to be kind when dispensing justice, leaning more to mercy than punishment.\n\nSexual and Gender Politics\n\nWho run the world? Gir- no itâs a bunch of men. This theme contributes to why âMeasure for Measureâ is a problem play. The exploration of the female characters in this play are very interesting, and kind of sad. Of 20 named characters, only 5 are women. Together, their lines make up only 18% of the play. Yikes! There is a lot to unpack here. Our female characters are Isabella, Mariana, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, Francisca (a nun who speaks twice) and Kate Keepdown (who we never meet). Their situations: a maiden poised to enter a nunnery, a prostitute, a pregnant girl about to lose her husband, a nun, and another prostitute. Quite gloomy, isn't it? Meanwhile, the men are leaders (The Duke, deputy Angelo, and ancient lord Escalus) and gentlemen (Lucio, Claudio, and Froth). Over the course of the play, our female characters are put into worse situations by men. Their experiences are dictated by men. Consider taking a âfeminist perspectiveâ and exploring âMeasure for Measureâ from a female point of view.\n\nThis theme links to the Great Chain of Being, Women and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâsee how he goes about to abuse me!â - These are the last words we hear from Mistress Overdone, as she calls out Lucio for betraying her even though she kept secrets for him. All this happens while sheâs being carted off to prison in only Act 3! What do you think Shakespeare is saying to us? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481)\n\nâThen was your sin of heavier kind than hisâ - The Friar (Duke) says to Juliet that she sinned more than Claudio, even though their sin was âmutually committedâ. Even though they were both consenting, the woman is blamed more. Consider what would become of Juliet if Claudio was executed. Sheâd probably end up like Mistress Overdone... (Act 2, Scene 3, Line 31)\n\nâWho will believe thee, Isabel?â - Angelo says this after Isabella threatens to reveal his disgusting request. Ouch. It really goes to show how untrustworthy women are deemed. Â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163)\n\nâWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?â - The Duke says this to Mariana. Basically, he says a woman can only be those 3 things. Jeez. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 196-197)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio. So, perhaps women do have some power. But, itâs due to their sexuality; something evaluated by men. Peachy. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that women are treated unfairly in society. Maybe he posits that women are afforded so few opportunities in a manâs world. The Bard potentially says that such sexual and gender politics do not create a cohesive and just society.\n\nMercy\n\nThis theme, again, connects to many others. It can link to all groups of people (The wealthy, the poor, women, criminals etc). Most of the mercy is dispensed at the end of the play when the Duke does his grand reveal. Characters who choose to mete out mercy over punishment include The Duke and Isabella. Also consider Angelo, who instead of choosing to spare Claudio, decides to kill him to uphold a law that hasnât seen anyone punished for the same deed. We might think this is harsh, but it a legal and lawful decision.\n\nConnect this idea with historical context, specifically Jacobean audience and playhouses/brothels.\n\nâI find an apt remission in myselfâ - Apt remission = ready forgiveness. The Duke says this after pardoning Angelo (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 539)\n\nâpray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to comeâ - The Duke pardons murderer Barnadine, asking him to use it to do better. How lovely! Â (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 525-526)\n\nâlet us be keen (shrewd/sharp), and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to deathâ - Escalus says this to Angelo, who wants to enact all strict laws immediately. The ever-reliable Escalus advises Angelo to be lenient and merciful. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 6-7)\n\nâMercy is not itself that oft looks so, pardon is still the nurse of second woeâ - Escalus says this, defending Angeloâs decision to punish Claudio. He suggests that sometimes being merciful can encourage further wrongdoing. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 282-283â)\n\nâI show it (pity) most of all when I show justiceâ - Angelo says to Isabella that he is showing Claudio pity/mercy by punishing him. A firm believer in the law, Angelo thinks heâs doing the right thing and teaching Claudio a lesson by punishing him. Â (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 123)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare encourages us to look at mercy and punishment from different perspectives. Angelo believes he is punishing Claudio for his own good, and cleaning up Vienna of lechery too. Maybe we ought to be merciful in our opinion of the deputy. Nonetheless, the Bard shows that in the case of young Claudio, mercy and forgiveness is the right path to choose. Finally, consider why Shakespeare may have portrayed a merciful leader to his Jacobean audience. Maybe if he were to portray a leader as fair and merciful, the Jacobean audience would trust that their new king (a man similar in character to the Duke) could be kind and merciful too. Earning the favour of the king and writing a killer play? Heâs killed two birds with one stone.\n\nHuman Frailty & Fallibility\n\nIâve encountered many essay topics about how humans are flawed and imperfect. Itâs a pretty big theme in many texts, not just in our friend William Shakespeareâs. Human fallibility is to blame for a lot of the going-ons in âMeasure for Measureâ. Angelo takes the law too seriously, he gets heart eyes for Isabella and kills Claudio even though he thinks heâs slept with Isabella. Why? He wants to save his own ass, fearing Claudio will seek vengeance. The Duke is flawed too. Heâs a leader, but he just avoids his problems, leaving Angelo in charge to deal with them. Then he plans to swoop in and look like a hero. Kinda dodgy. Consider Claudio and Juliet too. They, like Angelo, succumbed to lust and slept together before they were officially married. (Sigh, humans just canât get it right.) Itâs also worth thinking about the âlow-livesâ and poorer characters. Are the poor frail in a different way? For example, Mistress Overdone keeps Lucioâs secrets for him. In that way she is virtuous. However, she sells her body to survive. Perhaps she is not prone to desire like Angelo, but serves another desire - a desire to survive?\n\nIn terms of historical context, consider the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâThey say best men are moulded out of faults, and for the most become much more the better for being a little badâ - Mariana pleads to Isabella to support her in begging the Duke to pardon (her new husband) Angelo. She is optimistic for man, believing our bad deeds can lead to self-improvement. (Act 5, Scene 5, Line 473-475)\n\nâWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit onceâ - Isabella pleads to Angelo to pardon Claudio. She states that all souls were flawed before Christ offered redemption. (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 93)\n\nâI speak not as desiring more, but rather wishing a more strict restraintâ - Isabella is speaking to a nun as she is poised to enter the ranks of the nunnery. We usually think of a nun as living a very strict life, but Isabella wants it even stricter! Here we see her flaw is that her thinking is too singular and blinkered. (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 3-4)\n\nâLord Angelo is precise, stands at guard with envy, scarce confesses that his blood flows, or that his appetite is more to bread than stone.â - The Duke talks about how unhuman Angelo is. The deputy follows rules very closely, almost to the point where heâs like a machine. His nature is too strict. Â (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 53-56)\n\nâI love the people, but do not like to stage me to their eyesâ - The Duke says this to Angelo and Escalus as he hands over power to his deputy. Even the Duke is not perfect, in that he does not like being before crowds of his people (Act 1, Scene 2, Line 72-73)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that no one is truly perfect, not even a leader supposedly ordained by God, a law-abiding deputy, or a maiden who is poised to enter a nunnery. Yet while Angelo is overcome by his lust and emotion, the Duke and Isabella attempt to better themselves by showing mercy and temperance. Maybe Shakespeare suggests trying to improve oneâs flawed self is most important.\n\nGod, Religion and Spirituality\n\nPhew, weâre at our last theme. So, society in Vienna is very much religious. Their beliefs dictate actions and laws within the city. Some very religious characters include Isabella and Angelo. However, our novice nun, who is obsessed with virtue and chastity, agrees to and takes part in the bed-trick, a deception that is not particularly Christian. Our lusty deputy also succumbs, hellishly propositioning a maiden to sleep with him in exchange for her brotherâs life. Even The Duke, supposedly semi-divine, makes some dubious choices. He spends most of the play posed as a holy man, even though he is not. He plans the bed-trick to deceive Angelo and lets poor Isabella think her poor brother is dead, instead of saving her so much pain. Furthermore, the title of the tale, âMeasure for Measureâ, comes from the Gospel of Matthew. (See symbols/motifs for more deets). The question of how much we should let religion dictate us is another reason this piece is a problem play.\n\nThe theme of God and Religion can link to historical context such as the Divine Right of Kings.\n\nâmore than our brother is our chastityâ - (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 194) and âBetter it were a brother died at once, than that a sister by redeeming him should die foreverâ - (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 111-113) show that Isabella values her chastity and virtue over her brother!! Damn girl!\n\nâAy, but to die, and go we know not where, to lie in cold obstruction and to rotâ - Claudio tells Isabella that he fears the uncertainty of death. Perhaps his belief in a heaven has left him in the wake of his impending death? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 129-130)\n\nâLetâs write good angel on the devilâs horns - âtis not the devil's crestâ - Angelo is talking to himself about his lust for Isabella. Itâs an appearance vs reality (ooh another theme!) kind of idea, where you can try to pretend something is something else (ie. Angelo doesn't lust after Isabella), but it doesn't change the thing (ie. heâs still keen). The deputy is comparing his emotions to these religious extremes. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 16-17)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare criticises religious extremism in his portrayal of characters like Isabella and Angelo. Or maybe he just wants us to remain open-minded about ideas and our spirituality.\n\nYikes, there are so many themes in this play! Letâs move it along, and talk a little bit about characters.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nEach character can be viewed in different lights, even more so than themes can be. Weâre going to discuss characters very briefly because itâs up to you how you want to read them.\n\nHere are the characters, in order of how much they speak in the play. To keep things short, letâs pretend these are all tinder bios. Who would you swipe right on? (Hint: not Lucio)\n\nThe Duke\n\nsuper chill (the benevolent ruler of Vienna whoâs let the laws slip a little)\n\nloves dressing up (actually spends most of the play disguised as a friar)\n\nclever/cunning (secretly counteracts the injustices decreed by Angelo)\n\nIsabella\n\nstrong morals (would rather her brother die than she lives in shame)\n\ncan get wild (conspires with the Duke to complete the bed-trick)\n\nholy gal (poised to enter a nunnery)\n\nLucio\n\na gentleman (well, his title is. Heâs rude about the Duke and abandoned a prostitute that he got pregnant, so maybe heâs not that kind of gentleman)\n\nloves attention (legit! Heâs a minor character but he has the third most lines of them all! Lucio loves to stir the pot!)\n\nloves some symbolism (Lucio represents all the bad stuff in Viennaâ¦..see symbols/motifs)\n\nAngelo\n\nplays by the rules (a little too much)\n\nhypocrite (Sentences Claudio to death for sex before marriage, while asking the same thing of Isabellaâ¦. wow weâve found our antagonist)\n\nDeep (Angelo is a bit of a complex character. He seems aware of his misdeeds and struggles to deal with these desires. Itâs hard not to pity him at times)\n\nEscalus\n\nreliable (consistently counsels Angelo against acting too harshly)\n\nvirtuous (heâs merciful, lets Pompey go with a warning in Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nloyal (trusts in the Duke)\n\nProvost\n\nhard worker (heâs a prison ward)\n\nvirtuous (does whatâs right by him, disobeying Angeloâs orders to behead Claudio)\n\nmagician (not really, but he makes Angelo believe that pirate Ragozineâs head is Claudioâs)\n\nPompey\n\nclever (philosophically debates whether prostitution is worse than murder)\n\nfunny (his character is the clown, and heâs got some sassy comebacks)\n\npoor (Pompey is a bawd employed by Mistress Overdone. Not the best dating bio)\n\nClaudio\n\ndown for a good time ;) (impregnates Juliet before they are officially married)\n\ncool family (heâs Isabellaâs brother)\n\ngood hearted (initially is horrified at Angeloâs request of Isabella, saying she shouldnât do it. Unfortunately, his fear of death getâs to him. After heâs calmed down, heâs accepting of death)\n\nElbow\n\na man in uniform (a policeman)\n\na little dumb (he speaks a lot of malapropisms - hilariously using similar but incorrect words)\n\nnot like Pompey (Pompey is a clever poor man, while Elbow is a policeman whoâs a little bit all over the place)\n\nMariana\n\ndedicated (still in love with Angelo even though he called off their engagement because her dowry was lost)\n\na willing accomplice (participates in the bed-trick)\n\nMistress Overdone\n\npoor (sheâs a prostitute, who fears for her livelihood when Angelo announces heâs destroying all the brothels)\n\ngood hearted (kept Lucioâs secret. What secret? Read onâ¦)\n\nAbhorson\n\nworks for the Duke (as an executionerâ¦. thereâs no way to make that sound nice)\n\ndoesn't have a great name (câmon itâs true)\n\nJuliet\n\nalso likes to have a good time ;) (pregnant before official marriage)\n\ndependent (if Claudio dies she will probably end up as a prostitute to survive)\n\nBoy\n\ncan sing (Mariana asks him to sing a sad song about how she lost her beloved Angelo)\n\nFrancisca\n\nholy gal (she is a nun)\n\nKate Keepdown (we never actually meet this character)\n\na colleague of Mistress Overdone (a prostitute)\n\nsingle mum (Lucio got her pregnant and then ran away. He thinks marrying a prostitute is akin to whipping and hanging)\n\nRagozine (we never actually meet this character)\n\ndies (legit thatâs all he does)\n\nSYMBOLS & MOTIFS\n\nThese are people, objects, words etc that represent a theme or idea. For instance, the fact that Iâve used a bad soup metaphor AND a tinder reference means I need to go outside more. But letâs move onâ¦\n\nTitle\n\nThe title, âMeasure for Measureâ draws from the gospel of Matthew. The idea of heavenly justice vs earthly justice is prominent throughout the text. Moreover, itâs worth exploring the Old Testament ways of âan eye for an eyeâ and âmeasure for measureâ in comparison to the New Testament teachings which lean towards forgiveness and mercy. Now, where do the Dukeâs actions fit in? Is he harsh and equalising? Is he just and sympathetic? Â\n\nNew Testament vs. Old Testament\n\nWhen the Duke sentences Angelo to death, he makes a fancy speech which includes the playâs title.\n\nââAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!\n\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure.\n\nLike doth quit like, and measure still for measure.â\n\nAct 5, Scene 1, Line 439-441\n\nThis mimics the Old Testament views, which famously states âeye for eye, tooth for toothâ (Exodus 21:24). These ideals teach that the person who committed a misdeed shall have the same misdeed done unto them. (For example, if you donât like my new Facebook profile picture, Iâm not liking yoursâ¦..but way more severe.)\n\nIn comparison, the New Testament states that we âBe merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.â (Luke 6:36-37)\n\nSo, when sentencing Angelo the Duke employs the words of the Old Testament. However, he doesnât go through with Angeloâs execution, instead showing the mercy encouraged by the New Testament. Heâs not really following either way. Perhaps heâs instead choosing a middle road; one of temperance and justice.\n\nLucio\n\nWait, who? We havenât mentioned the âgentlemanâ Lucio much in the plot and in this blog post. Thatâs because he doesnât really do that much other than buzz around and annoy everyone. Maybe thatâs why his name rhymes with mosquitoâ¦.\n\nRegardless, we do see enough of Lucioâs character to learn that heâs not a very nice person. He treats Mistress Overdone and Pompey poorly, makes visits to the brothel, doesnât take responsibility for his actions (getting Kate Keepdown pregnant) and bad-mouths the Duke. So yeah, we donât like Lucio, whatâs the big deal? Well, in Act 4, Scene 4 Line 182, Lucio says something very intriguing.\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stick.â\n\nBurr - those little brown prickly things that get stuck to you.\n\nWe can think of Lucio as representing all the sins and misdeeds in Vienna - lechery, immorality, lack of justice, selfishness etc. Hence, Lucio is saying that these shortcomings and flaws will always be present to people and in Vienna, sticking to the city like a nasty burr. Damn, thatâs deep.\n\nProse/Verse\n\nThe metre of the verse (ie. the classic Shakespeare writing) in ââMeasure for Measureâ Â is iambic pentameter. This means that each line is divided into 5 feet. Within each foot, there is one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one.\n\nConsider:\n\nIâll TELL him YET of ANgelOâS reQUEST, And FIT his MIND to DEATH, for HIS soulâs REST. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 195-196)\n\nVerse does not have to rhyme, as the above lines do. Shakespeare often employs a rhyming couplet to close a scene and add some drama.\n\nVerse is usually reserved for the higher class citizens, with those who are less fortunate speaking in prose.\n\nProse is language in its ordinary form, with no metre.\n\nCertain characters, such as Lucio, switch between verse and prose depending on who they are speaking to. This could allude to Lucioâs duplicity, or perhaps a deep understanding of class divides in Vienna.\n\nNames: Escalus and Angelo\n\nEscalus is the ever reasonable and loyal lord and close confidant of the Duke. His name gives connotations of scales and balance - characteristic of the rational man.\n\nAngeloâs name has connotations of âangelâ. If we judge him only by his name, he should be a pure and heavenly being. Bah! Thatâs so fake! We can see that appearance is very different from reality. Isabella notices this too, stating that âthis outward-sainted deputy...is yet a devilâ (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 95-98).\n\nAngeloâs Words/Actions\n\nThere is so much to unpack about this douchebag. Let us briefly consider 2 ideas. When he propositions Isabella to sleep with him, he requests that she âlay down the treasures of (her) bodyâ (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 100).\n\nFirstly, thatâs weird. Perhaps Angelo can be seen as someone who is obsessed with the physical - Isabellaâs body and treasure. Maybe this obsession leads to his immorality and poor leadership.\n\nSecondly, Angelo struggles to directly say, âhey, letâs sleep togetherâ. He weaves his way around the request, propositioning Isabella so indirectly that at first, she does not even seem to understand his request! However, once she threatens to tell everyone about his vile demand, he speaks bluntly; âWho will believe thee, Isabel?â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163). Perhaps this shows Angelo is self-aware that heâs being an ass. Or maybe this scene is yet more evidence of a patriarchal society, with the men knowing very well the power they hold.\n\nRagozine\n\nWe never actually meet this fellow. Ragozine is a pirate who dies in jail while âMeasure for Measureâ unfolds. His head is used in place of Claudioâs to convince Angelo of the formerâs execution. Fascinatingly, Ragozine is the only person who dies in the entire play. ALSO, he dies of natural causes. Interesting. It feels like the play is full of death, grief and many heads on the chopping block. But curiously, there is only one death, of a minor character, of natural causes. Perhaps this says something about fate and justice or offers some commentary on life and hope.\n\nElbow vs. Pompey\n\nElbow is a silly policeman who speaks in malapropisms (using a similar but incorrect word for humorous effect). Pompey is a clever pimp who seems to have a deep understanding of justice and the Viennese people. The comparison of these characters, fortunate and dumb to unfortunate and clever, perhaps serves to show that the law is not always apt and that sometimes those who break the law are more clever than it.\n\nMistress Overdone (or lack thereof)\n\nMistress Overdone is a pitiable prostitute. She worries for her survival when Angelo begins pulling down the brothels, and she keeps Lucioâs bastard child a secret, only for him to throw her under the bus to save his own skin. The last we see of Mistress Overdone is her getting carted off to prison, crying âSee how he goes about to abuse me!â (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481) Yes, the last we witness of one of five speaking female characters is of her imminent incarceration. Furthermore, this happens in Act 3 of 5, around halfway through the play! The audience never hears from Mistress Overdone again, and her future is left uncertain. Even Barnadine, a convicted murderer, is given freedom and a happy ending.\n\nConsider writing a few sentences of your essay from a feministâs perspective. Think about the events of the play from the female charactersâ points of view. What is Shakespeare saying by portraying Mistress Overdone (and other women) in such a way? Perhaps he is pointing out the injustices of the patriarchal system, or how uncertain a womanâs life was in his contemporary time.\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ truly is an incredible text. This blog post is by no means an exhaustive list of all its quirks and complexities. This playâs relevance has survived centuries, and I believe it will continue to be pertinent to audiences well into the future. You are very lucky to be studying a text with such universal themes and ideas that you can carry with you even after high school.\n\nFor a detailed guide on Language Analysis including how to prepare for your SAC and exam, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Language Analysis.\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription 1]\n\nHey guys. Can you believe it is November already? Holy cow. Time flies so quickly. All my Year 12s have finished now, so if you're still here with me ... you must be in Year 11 or below, or you could be a Year 12 that's already finished, but you still enjoy my videos. I'm on to you.\n\nIf you didn't know already, I do have a personal YouTube channel. So head on over there if you guys have finished the year for English because I'd still really love to stay in contact with you.\n\nI've previously done this segment before and when I started it, everyone fell in love with it. So I created the segment a while ago now, and I have done one article... Actually it was two articles so far. If you haven't looked at those ones, I'd recommend you go ahead and check it out.\n\nBut this one, I'm going to do a 2001 analyzing argument article. The reason why I choose really old articles is because I feel like the more recent ones you probably end up doing at school, or you will probably do it in your own time. If not, you've probably already done it. That's why I want to leave those ones to you guys, maybe eventually I'll get up to it. But I want to be able to show you guys a little bit more, so that's why I choose really old ones, but it's still relevant to the course. Don't think that just because it's done in 2001, which is forever ago, what, were you born there? Oh, my gosh. I just realized that some of you could have, yeah.\n\nAnyways, the aim of today is just to go through the article, try to identify what the language techniques are and understand how they are persuasive or at least how the author intends them to persuade the audience. Actually, down the track we will talk more about structure, more at looking at arguments, that type of thing. But the goal here is more just about identification and understanding language techniques. So let's just get started.\n\nWith this particular one, you'll see that it is on a website, so you could analyze that in itself. But since I don't have it in front of me, I'm not going to, and I'm just going to look at the actual article itself.\n\n\"Keep healthy the informed way. Get in early. Get your Medi-Info card today.\" Automatically this might appeal to readers because it's saying \"Keep healthy the informed way,\" as though if they don't take onboard whatever this person is recommending them, then they won't be informed and so they're missing out on something. There's also this sense of urgency, \"Get in early.\"\n\n\"All of the world health professionals and their patients are waking up to the possibilities of the Medi-Info, MI Card.\" So \"All over the world\" is indicative of a global profile so this indicates that if it's good enough for the rest of the world, then surely it must be good enough for Australians like you and me. So that may invite readers to jump on-board with whatever this Medi-Info Card is about.\n\n\"Health professionals and their patients.\" \"Health professionals and their patients\" goes to show that if these people are recommending it and they are embracing the card, such as doctors or dentists or physiotherapists, then it's a really fantastic endorsement about that card and the product and what it's worth. Therefore, we should also support the product, too, either that could fall under the fact that they have credentials and so we trust them.\n\n\"Waking up to the possibility.\" So \"possibilities\" definitely has positive connotations. It's this idea of endless potential and so there is a lot to be gained from the card.\n\n\"Driven by breakthrough technology, the microchip-powered and credit-sized Medi-Info Card contains the info that carers and patients need to have now, on the spot, on time, on the screen.\" So \"breakthrough technology\" itself, \"microchip-powered,\" they both indicate that this idea is cutting-edge. For us, this may persuade readers because there's this idea that the latest tech often means the most effective or it's most likely to enhance your living.\n\nThe fact that it's credit-sized means that it is also portable. It's lightweight. What do you think this could mean for readers? It's user-friendly. How does this persuade them? It could persuade a person to adopt this card and take it on-board because it seems like it's convenient, it's easy to use. And it's not going to be a burden on them because all they need to do is really just throw it into their wallet.\n\nNow \"on the spot, on time, on screen\" really seems to push the idea of what do you think? Sorry, if it's out of focus. It's because I'm not looking at the camera. It could appeal to our desire to have things instantaneously. We're in the generation where things pop up in our face all the time, like notifications, shipping happens overnight. We just want things straightaway. So it could be that, but also this idea that this card is available any time and the information is accessible for you 24/7 so it's convenient. So I'll put that in below as well.\n\n\"This is the ultimate cool techno accessory.\" Okay. \"Cool techno\" itself is a bit of slang, or you could say that it's colloquial language to try to appeal to readers who may be interested in the latest tech, or people who want to keep up with the trend or the latest fashion accessories, for example. But there's this added benefit, it will actually save your life.\n\nThen this person moves on to say, \"Imagine you have an accident and are taken to hospital. Without the MI card in your wallet, can you be sure that vital information won't be missed? Think what the card might reveal.\" \"Imagine itself\" is a hypothetical situation. It's trying to get readers to see that the MI is a valuable tool. It has benefits that readers just cannot ignore and just between you and me, it could also appeal to our sense of FOMO. FOMO is not something that you would write into your essay itself, but there's this fear that if you don't have it, well, then what could potentially happen? It could be really bad.\n\nSo then there's all these dot points about what the card reveals, so it's those features, that for you, it comes back to the idea that all of these are the benefits that you can have. You can have also reassurance as a result because you know that all your information is there. People can access it when they need to, or when you're in times of need so then that in itself could relate to this idea of safety or comfort.\n\n\"All this and more can be downloaded fast from your MI Card. No forms to fill in. No stressful interviews about your medical history. No gaps because you're too stressed to remember your health details or insurance information.\" Okay. This idea that it can be downloaded fast is, again, convenient. It's not going to take up too much of your time. It's going to be really quick as well.\n\n\"No forms, no stressful interviews,\" so these two together will eliminate any of your negative experiences that you've previously had working with health professionals or the health sector. There's this idea of this simple, straightforward approach and this idea that there are no gaps, either. You might be fearful that because you're not providing all the information that you have because you just don't know it, then maybe you won't get the right type of treatment or people won't be able to look after you properly. But in this case, there's this sense of security that you'll be looked after.\n\n\"And there's more. It can even show you that in the event of your death, you want to live on as an organ donor.\" Organ donor itself has positive connotations. Everybody knows that if you're an organ donor, wow, you're very selfless and you're very giving, so this is like an added bonus that can make you feel better as a person. \"You could give someone else the chance of a new life.\" If you're able to do this, it puts you in power, so you could say that you feel empowered as a result.\n\n\"What about security?\" All of this section here maybe you could say specifically appeal to an audience who might be more concerned about security and about the information being put online or into this tool.\n\nThen the rest of it, it's pretty straightforward as well. It'll work pretty much anywhere, so this idea that you're always going to be covered. \"You can trust our technology. Get the Medi-Card Info today. Keep healthy the informed way,\" and then the rest of it, \"Send in your stories of medical emergencies.\"\n\nBecause I just want to keep this short, I think I'll leave it there. You could say that with this part, there's this very enthusiastic tone that's carried through the entire thing. Okay, cool. So I am just going to leave it there. I hope that was helpful to some extent, just to get you started and to get you thinking about some of the language techniques that might be there.\n\nHow did you guys go? I would actually really love to hear what kind of language techniques you found in the comment section below. But if you've got any questions for me, then please leave them as well because I know I haven't gone into this in immense detail, but yeah, hopefully you're able to walk away and learn something from it.\n\nSo if you like this type of thing, don't forget, I have an online course that's called How To Achieve A Plus In A Language Analysis? There's lots and lots of information there and videos that are around five hours long for you. Around 300 students have taken the course and it's rated something like 4.5 and above, so hopefully that's a good indication that it is actually really helpful.\n\nSo next week when I see you guys, we're going to go into part two, the article where it's about the family doctor. So I'd encourage you guys to go and analyze that yourself, and then let's reconvene next Friday and work through it. Hopefully this will prepare you guys in Year 11 for your end-of-year exam. Bye guys!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription 2]\n\nHey guys, so welcome back to part two. If you were here last week, then you know that I have already analyzed part one article for you and now we're moving into part two. You can just download the PDF for this language analysis article just down below in the description box, but let's just get started. Okay, so, \"I am a doctor with over 35 years experience.\" So automatically this doctor is establishing his credentials. So with credentials, it usually means that as an audience, we are impressed and we are respectful of this person and trust their opinion, especially if it's 35 years. \"I know what it is to be called to a local school in an emergency and find a child suffering from asthma, unable to tell me what medication has previously been prescribed. I know what it is to see older patients, day after day who experienced wariness and confusion in trying to remember all the medication they are taking.\"\n\nSo when he says, \"I know what it is,\" these are first hand experiences. It shows, again, and compounds on the idea that this guy is indeed experienced in the field and we should trust anyone, I guess, we should kind of trust the doctor, right, because he's exposed to this type of stuff every single day. It also shows that he is empathetic, which is a great quality to see in a doctor, because he seems to suffer as well when his patients are suffering. So with that in mind, as an audience, we are more inclined to like him and to value his opinion because he has directly been impacted as a result. When he talks about a child with asthma, it's a very interesting scenario to choose, he could have talked about anyone, he decides to talk about a child.\n\nSo potentially what this could do is appeal to a particular audience, for example, it could be parents, it could be other people suffering asthma, for example. But let's say if we're parents, generally we're... I say, we like I'm a parent, I'm not a parent. But we're protective towards young people, and you want to remove them from needless suffering as a result. Again, \"Those who experienced weariness and confusion,\" potentially that could appeal to the elderly. So, if you're somebody who's older and you're starting to experience the fact that you're getting a little bit confused or you're forgetting things, then this might really appeal to you and speak to you because it could be the answer that you're looking for.\n\n\"I recently heard about the pain and distress of a patient who suffered an epileptic fit while far from home. Unfortunately, everyone around him, unaware that he had mild fits, assumed he was drunk and ignored him.\" So this part here, like recalling a story, it shows the unfairness of the situation. That this person who was having epileptic fit, would have a much more positive outcome should he have had an MI card. And we feel sorry for him because nobody should have to experience their illness and be alienated or judged on by the community or by the public. So as a result, we may be encouraged to go out there and get our own and MI card or recommend our friends or family who we know are, who may be suffering from illnesses to get an MI card. \"We can all sympathize with this lad\", so that itself is quite easy. What is it, guys? Inclusive language.\n\nSo if you don't know already, inclusive language engages the audience because it encourages them to feel included and responsible in whatever the author is talking about, so we feel like there's something that we can do in this case. \"This lad,\" that's quite colloquial, why do you think he does that? So maybe it shows that this doctor isn't just a doctor who's distant and unfeeling, but he sees us, patients, as people and as friends, people that he cares about. And so, again, we're more inclined to listen to this doctor because we see him in a positive light. \"He can no longer feel confident when he goes out.\" So this is, again, like so unfair, nobody should go out and feel like they can't be confident. If this is something that's taken away from the person, but a Medi-Info Card could help relieve them of that, then maybe they should do it, maybe we should stop advocating for MI cards.\n\n\"We can all sympathize,\" do you guys know what that is? Generalization. Generalization is when it's indicated that everyone agrees, like we can all sympathize because if you don't seem like you sympathize, well then you're kind of that a-hole in the corner that's like being rude and not caring while everyone else is. So of course you're kind of more inclined to want to agree and sympathize and therefore support MI card. \"As a doctor,\" so yet again, that kind of goes back to like the credentials.\n\n\"I know that in emergency, he would have been given vital help he required immediately.\" So this sense of instantaneous, there's no waiting involved, everything happens straight away. So we can trust Medi-Info, it's going to do its job at making sure that people are well looked after. \"All Australians,\" same thing, generalization. \"Young or old, sick or well, bush or city, close,\" so this starts to appeal that to lots of different people. \"Lives that are free from anxiety,\" so appeals to their sense of freedom or this idea that this person couldn't feel confident anymore. We don't want them to go out there and feel anxious either, right?\n\nYou can see from all the different lines and where they're going, that I try to make connections to other parts of the article as I go through the piece, because I think it's really important to be able to look at things on more holistic scale than rather just one thing on a micro level. This means that you're able to better understand the contention, as well as the arguments that the author uses to build up that contention.\n\nSo let's finish this one off, \"The Medi Card doesn't waste people's time,\" for people who are very conscious of their time and want to be productive, it could appeal to them. \"Safe and secure,\" excellent, so we know that. We spoke about this last time with the MI, giving you security and comfort. And also you can also say that there's alliteration here, it's just as a side note though, I would much rather you guys talk about security and safety and how that appeals to people.\n\nAnd \"My work as a doctor would improve,\" I mean, if you really wanted to, you could even like put that together with as a doctor, and then it goes back to credentials. \"If I had more time to talk to my patients, they would be improved.\" Duh, duh, duh. Cool. \"To me, your Medi-Info Card means peace of mind for everyone.\" Okay, so what do you guys think of that? I'm not going to analyze it, I'm going to ask you guys to analyze it and put it down in the comment section below for me. So with this one, I analyzed a lot, but I'm sure there's still heaps more that I haven't quite looked at. And so I want you guys to put down in the comments below, what are the different types of analyses that you've pulled from this article, let's share around and help each other out.\n\nThe more we can collaborate and work together, the more we can lift each other up. So if you needed more help with analyzing arguments, you guys can definitely check out my study guide where I have an entire section, which covers everything from how to analyze, language technique list, structure, high response essays, low response essays, so you can see the difference and everything is annotated for you in those essays so that you understand why they actually did well or not so well. So that's it from me, I will see you guys next Friday, and chat to you then.

What Is The Creative Response?\n\nThe Creative Response, which forms part of the âReading and creating textsâ component of the study design, is part of the 1st Area of Study (AoS 1) - meaning that the majority of students will tackle the Creative Response in Term 1. Unlike the analytical text response, in the Creative Response you will be asked to write your own imaginative piece in response to a selected text.Â\n\nYou are expected to read and understand the selected text, analyse its key features, and write a creative piece which demonstrates your comprehension of the text.\n\n2. What Are You Expected To Cover? (Creative Writing Criteria)\n\nThe creative writing task assesses your ability to combine features of an existing text with your own original ideas. The key intention here is to demonstrate your understanding of the world of the text. You can achieve this by exploring and applying selected elements from the text, such as context, themes, literary devices like symbols, and/or characters. You should also consider the values embedded within the text - this includes explicit values (which can be seen on the surface of the text) and implied values (values we uncover through analysis of the textâs deeper meaning). Try to reflect these values within your writing.Â\n\nYour piece will be a creative response, after all, so you should apply the conventions of this style of "
