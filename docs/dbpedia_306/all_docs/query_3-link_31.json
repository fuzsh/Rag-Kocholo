        "text": "The Courage Film Festival is aimed at all the filmmakers and screenwriters who use their work to take a stand and fight for what they believe is right! We're now looking for submissions for our the edition in Berlin in Fall 2024.\n\nWe welcome films and screenplays that fight for good causes and portray the struggles and adversity that people and groups face when trying to bring about positive change and influence in a world where you sometimes have to shout in order to make yourself heard.\n\nWe are looking for stories that spark discussions and debates and are the protagonists for positive change and development in the world. All themes are welcome, covering topics such as women, immigration, the environment, family, equality, mental health, disability, etc.\n\nPeople face challenges every day. Will your story ignite courage in another human?\n\nWe want to hear your stories and give you a platform to share them and to also discuss the issues portrayed in your film with like-minded filmmakers. Our events include screenings and Q&A sessions about the main themes of the festival.\n\nLet the Courage Film Festival be the platform where you grab the world’s attention to champion your cause and raise awareness.\n\nWe're now also planting trees with Grow My Tree. Only our award winners receive certificates for the trees planted, but each and every submission contributes. Let's plant a greener world together!\n\nNote: Our website is down at the moment - we are working on getting it back up as fast as possible!\n\nAll filmmakers or script writers that submit to the Courage Film Festival must agree to the following conditions:\n\n- All films must include English subtitles if they are not in English.\n\n- All films must be submitted to the correct category: Feature films more than 25 minutes; Short films under 25 minutes; Documentary Feature films more than 35 minutes; Documentary Short films under 35 minutes.\n\n- All screenplays must be in English and have under 120 pages (approximately).\n\n- All student films must provide student ID or similar proof.\n\n- All Iranian films may be submitted for free only during the first deadline of each edition.\n\n- The festival reserves the right to check all material is suitable for screening and holds the right to reject material deemed unsuitable without issuing a refund.

We do not provide invitation letters for visa purposes either.\n\n- Filmmakers and scriptwriters are solely responsible and accountable for obtaining the correct permission to use any materials they do not already own the rights to, including but not limited to, music, logos, trademarks and all intellectual property rights. The Courage Film Festival will not be held responsible for failure to do so.\n\n- By submitting to us, you give consent to receive occasional emails (~4 per year) with tips and discount codes for submissions to us and partner festivals.
