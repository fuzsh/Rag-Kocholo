        "text": "The Courage to Change Ultimately the book, The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, is about having courage and strength to better your life. Throughout the book, Taylor has taken many steps of courage to hopefully change her life for the better. Taylor left Pittman County to start a new beginning, she had the courage to take in a child like it was her own almost immediately after leaving Pittman County, and she risked her life to take Estevan and Esperanza with her to Oklahoma. “Courage doesn’t mean you don’t get afraid. Courage means you don’t let fear stop you.”\n\n“Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is being afraid and doing it anyway.” This quote said by Lou Gehrig explains that courage isn't about having no fear; but rather, it is about one being filled with fear and deciding that something or someone is greater than that fear. In the book, The Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, by Jamie Ford, the protagonist, Henry Lee, turns against the will of his father and his own country values to run after forbidden love. Even though Lee is afraid, he courageously proceeds to follow his heart.\n\nThe word courage has been tossed around for centuries. From Christopher Columbus to Drake. The definition is knowing that something scares the living daylights out of you, but facing it anyway. The thing is, there are many different ways to look at courage. For example, perhaps a book about courage. Let's take The Schwa Was Here by Neal Shusterman. The book relates to courage because it show many examples of it by explaining some dares, challenges and messes two kids, one half Invisible, go through. The main person who shows courage is The Schwa, because he has to listen to a bothersome story, sneak into a cranky mans house, even though the whole town is scared of it, and gets in trouble with airport security.\n\nDid you know successful people are proven to have more courage than those who are not successful? A quote from Kelley Kalafatich does a good job explaining this fact, “You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face…”. This quote explains that courage is the ability to face your fears and pursuing the path that you want to. Courage is a very exceptional quality to have because it helps a person succeed in life. Courage lets you face your fears and move on with life. Courage allows you to make decisions that you don’t regret later on in your life. There are many people around us that show the quality of courage. Having courage builds integrity\n\n“Courage is not the absence of fear is the ability to act in the presence of fear.”This quote explains that it is an act of bravery when you do something that helpful or valuable to you even if you are afraid doing it. For instance risking your life to stand up for something that you care about or that you believe.\n\nThe concept of courage can be seen in Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby when Gatsby is trying to get Daisy back. For instance, in chapter five when Gatsby is about to meet Daisy for the first time since he left her. “Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pocket, was standing in a puddle in water glaring tragically into my eyes” (Fitzgerald, 45). This quote shows the fear that Gatsby has when he is about to meet Daisy for the first time since Gatsby left for the army during World War One, it also shows the courage Gatsby had to meet Daisy again. This supports the definition that courage requires fear because it shows that courage is hidden under the perception of dread and fear. Another example, is in chapter four when Gatsby is telling Nick about his past. “‘So I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody’” (Fitzgerald, 35). This reveals Gatsby’s subconscious fear of what Nick thinks of him and therefore he had courage to tell him the truth about his past. This further supports the definition of courage by revealing that in order to have courage there must be fear even if the person is not aware of it.\n\nCourage is a quality that is learned, not a quality a person is born with. Dana is afraid of facing her fears but after the reward she becomes courageous and faces her fears. Dana admits she is scared to a total stranger when she is begging for money. &lt; “I am a little scared.” I said, trying to sound convincing. That wasn’t much of an act. There had been few times since I’d left home that I wasn’t at least a little scared (7).’ &gt; Dana\n\n“It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are” This quote to me means that if I have courage when I want to get A’s and B’s or if I want to make the cross country team then I will be able to grow up and know I did it. My goals are to get A’s and B’s on all of my report cards this year because I want to make my family and myself happy, also to make the cross country team because I want myself to know that I’m a fast runner.\n\nIt is important to have courage because it will encourage and help you to meet new people and do better things for other people and yourself. In speak Melinda develops social problems because of her bad experiences in the past, which is why it took her a lot of courage to go to a pep rally for her school. This benefited her because it made her meet new people and socialize even if she didn’t want to, this made her step out of her comfort zone and gain self confidence. “I’ve always wanted to go to a pep rally. Can you imagine what it must be like to be on the football team and have\n\nEveryone experiences adversity. Challenges that everyday people experience can potentially shape, improve, or destroy one's sense of self and personality. Through all these hardships and seemingly impenetrable obstacles, the most pertinent component of one's ability to overcome can only be shown in actions taken despite the odds. People have one of two options; to let those obstacles overwhelm them and keep them from pursuing all that they were destined to accomplish, or to march forward, fight harder and push past the seemingly impossible circumstances to become greater than they ever expected to be, but until they take the step that enables them to be successful -- they are stranded. All of our actions, mistakes, successes, and behaviors shape our person and what we can or cannot become, but what will always matter is our individual decisions and actions not those of the people around us because at the end of the day, we are the ones who have to deal with ourselves.\n\nCourage is a necessity to overcome fears and achieve a desired goal. Fear is something that exists in all of us. There is no hero or any particular courageous figure that is without fear. Being fearless is not required to be courageous, one simply has to look past or overcome their fears to possess this great quality. When overcoming fears and going against the norm, there are always risks involved. There are different types of risks that come about. Someone could risk life or limb, while others risk their reputation. Either risk is serious enough that a person must have courage to endure that particular risk. Courage can occur anytime, anywhere, and often in our everyday lives. Everyone will experience courage no matter how young,\n\nIntegrity, as we all may know,is not a joke. Something many people take very seriously. I would hope you all would know the definition of integrity, if not I guess it would be helpful to tell you. Integrity in the internet's perspective is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness, the state of being whole and undivided. In my Perspective Integrity is being able to be honest and true, to not just yourself but everyone that's in your surroundings as well. There is another version of integrity and that is self-Integrity which is known as the process of knowing your self, a process of self-sought but never completed. Honesty is the state imposed by others, which is somewhat connected to self-integrity. Integrity is how a person will live their life however they please. In this crazy thing we call life, we tend to face many choices every single day that not only can we personally answer but everyone can answer as well. Integrity is doing the right thing versus the wrong thing, and I am not saying that any of the definitions are incorrect, but what I am portraying is that everybody's definition is different, and will always be different."
