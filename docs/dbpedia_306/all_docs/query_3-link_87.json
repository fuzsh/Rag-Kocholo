        "text": "When it comes to film intrigue, there are several methods and plot twists a writer can use to shock the audience. One of the most powerful twists comes when a movie takes a single event or plotline and completely changes the audience's interpretation of that moment.\n\nThese twists work incredibly well because audiences are predisposed to identify with the main character's point of view. Going back and seeing how events play out from another character's perspective is challenging to pull off, but there are more than a few examples of a film completely shocking the audience with this plot device.\n\nUpdated on September 8, 2023 by Kieran Loughlin:This post has been updated to include even more movies that show the same scene from a different perspective, as well as to meet with CBR's current formatting standards.\n\nRELATED: ​​​​​Top 20 Best Thriller Suspense Movies of All Time\n\n15 The Strays\n\nDirected by Nathaniel Martello-White\n\nThe Strays is the most recent film on this list, and is well worth watching. Blending thriller sensibilities with social commentary, the 2023 flick follows Neve as she goes to great lengths to conform with white suburbia. However, Neve's life starts to unravel when she keeps seeing the same two strangers wherever she goes.\n\nThe second act shifts from Neve's point of view and shows the films' events through the two mystery characters' eyes. Here the film delves into their motivations and explores their connection to Neve. Worlds then collide in an electrifying third act, where the tension is palpable.\n\n14 Bad Times at the El Royale\n\nDirected by Drew Goddard\n\nReleased in 2018, Bad Times at the El Royale weaved together the perspectives of multiple guests at a mysterious hotel. Each of these characters carried their own dark secrets, which served as a great source of drama.\n\nBad Times at the El Royale is a strong example of a film which shows the same events unfolding from different points of view. It really benefited the film, allowing the audience to really get to know each character. The interweaving storylines also helped build the suspense, with the movie dropping one twist after another.\n\n13 Courage Under Fire\n\nDirected by Edward Zwick\n\nIn 1996's Courage Under Fire, Denzel Washington played Nat Serling, an army veteran tasked with evaluating the merits of the recently deceased soldier Karen Walden. He was attempting to determine if she was worthy of a posthumous medal of honor.\n\nSerling tracked down other soldiers who had worked with Walden in the past, but each member gave him a wildly different story. Some said Walden was deserving of the medal, while others said that she was a coward and didn't deserve anything. Courage Under Fire is extremely emotional, showcasing the effects that military life can have on someone.\n\nRELATED: 30 Saddest Movies That Will Break Your Heart\n\n12 Snake Eyes\n\nDirected by Brian De Palma\n\n1998's Snake Eyes starred Nicolas Cage as Rick Santoro, a detective at a boxing match who investigated an assassination in broad daylight. Santoro started taking accounts of the different suspects behind the murder, who all tell versions of events that vary in significant ways.\n\nSnake Eyes increased the tension by giving Santoro a limited amount of time to solve the case. It was fairly criticized when it came out, with many citing the film didn't seem to have substance. However, the mystery elements of Snake Eyes were widely praised, and it became a great Nicolas Cage movie some fans missed.\n\n11 Knives Out\n\nDirected by Rian Johnson\n\nDaniel Craig made his debut as gentleman detective Benoit Blanc in 2019's murder mystery Knives Out. He was called in to assist local authorities with the mysterious case of a murdered author and his suspicious family fighting over the inheritance.\n\nKnives Out retold the accounts of the night before the author turned up dead, each coming from the various family members and people in the house that night. Each new perspective unlocked more of the mystery, but it was ultimately Blanc's unique deductive mind that uncovered the truth.\n\n10 The Usual Suspects\n\nDirected by Bryan Singer\n\n1995's The Usual Suspects followed the police interrogation of the only surviving member of a heist crew named Verbal Kint. He was being questioned by the cops after a robbery went horribly wrong. The entire film followed Verbal's perspective, surprising the audience at every turn as the story of the heist was recounted.\n\nThe Usual Suspects featured numerous plot twists as Verbal answered his interrogator's questions. More revelations about the origin of the heist crew and the fruition of their plans completely grabbed the audience as the truth about the disastrous job came out with a final, unforgettable plot twist.\n\n9 Hero\n\nDirected by Yi-Mou Zhang\n\n2002's Hero was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's 1950 classic Rashomon. The film followed a nameless mercenary played by Jet Li. He told a story to China's emperor about how he eliminated three deadly assassins. Hero explored the mercenary's interpretation of events before the emperor himself responded with his own version of the story.\n\nThe emperor provided his own interpretation of events based on his critiques of the mercenary's story. The audience didn't know who was telling the whole truth until a plot twist in the third act filled in the gaps and put all the pieces together.\n\n8 Vantage Point\n\nDirected by Pete Travis\n\nThe attempted assassination of the President of the United States was explored through the eyes of a few different characters in 2008's Vantage Point. Dennis Quaid starred as a Secret Service agent who used local news cameras to uncover the truth.\n\nOther characters in the crowd, with their own recorded evidence, worked their own way into the story, providing new viewpoints that either confused events or revealed more players in the event. Vantage Point added tense action to the classic Rashomon formula, but critics weren't immediately impressed by the film.\n\n7 The Handmaiden\n\nDirected by Park Chan-wook\n\n2016's The Handmaiden was an adaptation of a book titled Fingersmith. The story followed a girl hired as a handmaid for a Japanese heiress. The initial plot twist of the story revealed that the handmaiden was actually a part of a fraud scheme set up by a con man.\n\nThe handmaiden and the empress end up falling in love with each other in The Handmaiden's first twist. However, the second half of the film featured even more surprises for the audience. The Handmaiden replayed key events from another character's perspective that added new context to several moments.\n\nRELATED: 10 Movie Twists That Are Obvious If You Just Pay Attention\n\n6 Ghost Dog\n\nDirected by Jim Jarmusch\n\n1999's Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai utilized the plot twist in a comparatively minor way, as it happened only once and didn't exactly change the trajectory of the story. However, it's still an interesting subversion of what the audiences believed to be fact.\n\nThe origins of the titular character in Ghost Dog were called into question. Ghost Dog was a hitman who became completely loyal to his boss for decades due to a complete misunderstanding. However, that origin was then told from the boss's point of view, which revealed the truth about his selfish actions and manipulation of Ghost Dog.\n\n5 The Outrage\n\nDirected by Martin Ritt\n\n1964's The Outrage was a Western adaptation of one of Akira Kurosawa's classic films, 1950's Rashomon. It's extremely similar to Kurosawa's original, almost to a fault, as many critics felt underwhelmed that The Outrage didn't bother to add any unique flair to its narrative.\n\nThe Outrage followed the case of an assault and murder committed by a notorious bandit. The attack was explored from several different perspectives. However, the film never explicitly stated which perspective held an accurate retelling of what actually happened.\n\n4 Elephant\n\nDirected by Gus Van Sant\n\n2003's Elephant was a controversial film that deconstructed an event similar to the real-life Columbine Massacre. It followed the perspectives of several students in their daily high school lives. Elephant focused on these students as a school shooting interrupted their daily routines.\n\nThis proved to be a contentious approach, as some praised the approach to the narrative while others complained about the slow burn. These different perspectives added further context to the violence that shocked viewers in Elephant's finale.\n\nRELATED: 10 Best Twist Villain Reveals In Movies, Ranked\n\n3 Pulp Fiction\n\nDirected by Quentin Tarantino\n\n1994's Pulp Fiction was director Quentin Tarantino's second movie. It explored a series of events in a non-linear story. Each character introduced tied into these events in various ways which weren't detectable until the shocking climax of the film.\n\nPulp Fiction was bookended by a robbery at a diner where several characters came together, but each segment was told from a different perspective. The film followed the three main protagonists through distinct moments in their life, all happening around the same time. Each moment uncovered a surprising new ending for the characters in the non-linear story.\n\n2 Gone Girl\n\nDirected by David Fincher\n\n2014's perfectly cast book-to-screen adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl followed Nick Dunne, a teacher who became a suspect in his wife's disappearance. The first half of the film was told from Nick's perspective as he dealt with the stress of his missing wife, the process of becoming a suspect, and a final scavenger hunt of messages left by his wife.\n\nGone Girl then completely switched perspectives and told the story of his wife, Amy. Everything the audience had been led to believe was completely turned on its head. Not only was Amy revealed to be alive, but she was also the one who orchestrated her disappearance and framed her husband. This change in perspective and revelation was only the first major twist in the hit adaptation.\n\n1 Rashomon\n\nDirected by Akira Kurosawa\n\nAkira Kurosawa's 1950 classic Rashomon was one of the first times a filmmaker had presented a single event told through multiple perspectives. The film drove home the fact that multiple eyewitnesses to an event can complicate the situation further, leading to the origin of the term \"Rashomon Effect.\"\n\nRashomon followed the court hearing of an infamous bandit on trial for assault and murder. Multiple points of view of this same event were told, but the perspectives were wildly different from each other. This tops the list of same story, different perspectives examples as audience never learned which viewpoint was correct. It led to one of the most debatable endings in cinema."
