JOSEPH: KING OF DREAMS focuses clearly on God. God is given the credit, and even the songs witness to Him.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE GRINCH (2018)\n\nTHE GRINCH (2018) is a great movie about the true meaning of Christmas triumphing over alienation and materialism. It features powerfully loving parents and children, a joyous community of inspired Whos, and a terrific character arc for the Grinch, plus great Christmas carols and hymns focusing on Jesus Christ and His redemptive divinity, lordship and love.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nA CINDERELLA STORY\n\nA CINDERELLA STORY STARS Hilary Duff in a modern re-telling of the Cinderella fairy tale. Wonderfully written and entertaining, A CINDERELLA STORY gets better and better as it goes along and extols all the cardinal Christian virtues in a positive, winsome, attractive way.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nBOLT\n\nThe Disney animated feature BOLT is about a canine actor in a superhero show on TV who gets accidentally shipped to New York and must make his way back to Hollywood, with help from a sarcastic cat named Mittens and wacky hamster named Rhino. BOLT is great wholesome fun from beginning to end.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nCHICKEN LITTLE\n\nCHICKEN LITTLE, Disney’s first fully computer-animated movie, is big family entertainment. An energetic, funny, screwball take on the famous children’s fable, it has a heartfelt message about the transcendent power of true love – the kind of love that cannot be earned, but that can only be freely given.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nFREE WILLY\n\nIn desperate need of love and the security of a family, 12-year-old Jesse recognizes similar needs in his new-found friend Willy, a 7000-pound killer whale, living in the North West Adventure Park, and knows there can be only one solution...FREE WILLY. This film is well made and very clean, to the point of being refreshing. FREE WILLY is a great treat and suitable for the entire family.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTURBO\n\nTURBO is a super-charged animated comedy about a little garden snail with big dreams, who gets endowed with special powers that enable him to qualify for the Indy 500. TURBO has loads of hi-octane fun for all ages, with a positive redemptive message about being your brother’s keeper.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nCHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY\n\nCHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a wondrously quirky and heartwarming adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic children’s book about poor Charlie Bucket’s fantastic, life-changing visit to Willy Wonka’s amazing candy factory. The movie imparts many positive moral messages, not the least of which is the fact that having a loving family is the best reward of all.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nIT TAKES TWO\n\nIT TAKES TWO tells the story of two identical girls living at the extremes: one is rich; the other is an orphan. They switch places in order to stop the rich girl's father from marrying a woman he doesn't love, so they can pair him with the orphan's case worker. The movie is innocuous fun for families with small children, especially girls.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nA SHAUN THE SHEEP MOVIE: FARMAGEDDON\n\nA SHAUN THE SHEEP MOVIE: FARMAGEDDON is another great, funny, heartwarming, delightful Aardmore Studio stop motion family cartoon, where Shaun has some adventures with an alien and his flying saucer. Now playing on Netflix, FARMAGEDDON is full of fun and fantasy that will appeal to all ages as well as clever science fiction references that will appeal to adults.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nIMAGINE THAT\n\nIMAGINE THAT is the story of Evan, an executive competing inside his company for a promotion, only to discover that he needs his daughter and her imaginary friends in order to succeed. With little negative content but some magical elements, IMAGINE THAT is a heartwarming, funny movie showing the love that can grow between a father and a daughter.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE CROODS\n\nTHE CROODS is a new animated comedy about one of the world’s first families, who are fearful of the new when their cave is suddenly destroyed. THE CROODS is a fun adventure with a family who truly love each other, but it has some humanist, environmentalist elements.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nINCREDIBLES 2\n\nIn INCREDIBLES 2, the sequel to Pixar and Disney’s classic animated movie, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and their children spring into action once again when a supervillain hypnotizes innocent civilians to harm others. INCREDIBLES 2 is another fun, exciting, family-friendly superhero movie with lots of humor and heart, but it contains a couple light expletives and some scary elements requiring caution for younger children.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF SHARK BOY AND LAVA GIRL IN 3-D\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF SHARK BOY AND LAVA GIRL is a family fantasy film that tells how a 10-year-old boy saves his imaginary dream friends, Shark Boy and Lava Girl, who have become real. Despite some murky 3-D effects and unconvincing acting, this entertaining, funny allegorical fantasy builds to an exciting climax and encourages children to pursue their best dreams. It also urges children to forgive other people, even the school bully.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE LITTLE PRINCE (2016)\n\nTHE LITTLE PRINCE is an animated movie about a little girl living in a grownup world, who meets an aviator and discovers that miracles are possible and hope and faith are necessary. Promoting a strong moral worldview about love, courage, hope, and belief, THE LITTLE PRINCE is a delightful, whimsical story about childhood and imagination.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE SECRET LIFE OF PETS\n\nAn animated comedy for families, THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS tells what happens when pets are left alone, along with a story about a small terrier named Max who gets lost in the big city with a bigger dog named Duke. THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS is a very funny movie, with good characterizations and a strong moral, redemptive worldview, but it does have some scatological jokes and slapstick comedy requiring a light caution.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nRALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET\n\nRALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET is a hilarious, imaginative, heartfelt sequel where arcade game characters Ralph and his best friend Vanellope enter the world of the Internet to get a missing piece for Vanellope’s arcade game. RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET has strong moral themes surrounding friendship and courage, with positive Christian elements as well, but caution is advised for younger children for some innuendos and a few intense scenes.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nHOP\n\nCombining live action with animated animals, HOP tells what happens when a slacker in Hollywood literally runs into the son of the Easter Bunny. HOP is a very funny, high-octane children’s comedy with good moral lessons, but it has little to do with the real story of Easter, the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nKLAUS\n\nKLAUS is an animated fantasy about a young postman who teams up with a toymaker named Klaus to deliver toys to children living in a faraway, unhappy town split in two by a terrible feud. KLAUS has some cartoon violence, brief implied magic and no references to Christmas, but it’s a witty, charming movie with heartwarming moments.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nBEE MOVIE\n\nBEE MOVIE is Jerry Seinfeld’s animated family comedy about the secret life of bees, in a story about a young bee who learns that there’s more to life than just fulfilling your own personal desires. BEE MOVIE is brilliantly funny family fun for ages 9 to 90 that cleanly teaches valuable lessons about gratitude, friendship, working together, and maintaining the balance of nature created by God, but a few offhand remarks require caution for younger children.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTARZAN\n\nWalt Disney Pictures' TARZAN is the first animated feature to focus on the legendary jungle hero. Using a \"deep canvas,\" 3-D effect where Tarzan swings, skids and flips through the jungle as the camera zooms in and around the landscape, this mostly moral story has some mild action violence and some political correctness which calls for parents to spend a media-wise moment with their children if they allow their children see it.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nOPEN SEASON\n\nOPEN SEASON is a new animated comedy about a big grizzly bear and a mule deer who get into lots of trouble in the human city and in the vast forest. OPEN SEASON is very funny, lively and clever with marvelous animation and positive moral elements, but MOVIEGUIDE® advises caution for younger children because of some light off-color humor, strong slapstick violence and brief scary moments.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nNATIONAL TREASURE\n\nNATIONAL TREASURE is a rollicking, witty adventure mystery starring Nicolas Cage as a contemporary Indiana Jones hero hunting clues to a treasure hidden for hundreds of years. Although it shows a couple Masonic symbols that help locate the treasure, the movie is not occult or anti-Christian, but is a family-friendly entertainment that honors early American history, the Founding Fathers, the Declaration of Independence, and ideals such as liberty, traditional family values, bravery, honor, patriotism, loyalty, and justice.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nMIRACLE\n\nMIRACLE is a splendid, inspirational re-telling of the U.S. hockey team’s hard-earned road to victory play at the 1980 Olympic games in Lake Placid, New York. Though it contains some light obscenities, it is a fine, entertaining, and positive movie which shows that the success of the 1980 hockey team was not just some fluke or happy coincidence, but was the result of hard work, persistence, and detailed preparation.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nRACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN\n\nRACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN is an exciting, fast-paced science fiction adventure about two alien teenagers with extraordinary abilities and a down-and-out cab driver, who must depend on each other to save two worlds. This Disney remake is well produced, directed and acted, with exciting special effects and a well-crafted plot, and contains moral worldview with redemptive elements, but there is much action violence requiring caution for younger children.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nLEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE 3D\n\nLEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA’HOOLE features an animated tale of Owls striving to mend the weak, heal the broken, and vanquish evil no matter what. LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS is a beautifully crafted, exciting, redemptive animated fantasy of owls who do the right thing, with a rebuke of racism in the evil owls who call themselves “the Pure Ones” and a commitment to believing the truth.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTALL GIRL\n\nTALL GIRL follows a teenager named Jodi who has always felt awkward with her height, but, when a tall Swedish exchange student comes to school, she suddenly isn’t so self-conscious. A television movie on Netflix, TALL GIRL has a strong moral worldview with positive elements, but does have one scene with implied underage drinking at teenage party and some cursing. MOVIEGUIDE® advises caution for older children.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE KARATE KID (2010)\n\nTHE KARATE KID (2010) is an entertaining, action-packed and touching movie about a young American boy in China who learns kung fu from a reclusive maintenance man so that he can enter a tournament to escape the ceaseless bullying of a group of cruel peers. THE KARATE KID contains a solid moral message about treating others with kindness and respect, but there are also propagandistic references to Eastern spiritual mysticism that requires special caution.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nMARY POPPINS RETURNS\n\nMARY POPPINS RETURNS, set years after the original Disney movie musical, finds Michael Banks (and his sister Jane) all grown up, and Michael has his own children who are in desperate need of a Nanny. MARY POPPINS RETURNS has a strong moral worldview, with more imagination and less magical thinking, about supporting each other as a family. Adorable and enjoyable, MARY POPPINS RETURNS will entertain the entire family.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nA.X.L.\n\nA.X.L. is an exciting but flawed science fiction movie about a hybrid creation known as an A.X.L., which is part dog and part weapon, who befriends a teenage boy. A.X.L. has some good heart, but poor execution with a poor script. There are some positive messages about sacrifice, but it’s mitigated by brief foul language and risqué outfits that warrant caution.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nBEDTIME STORIES\n\nBEDTIME STORIES stars Adam Sandler as a hotel handyman, whose life is changed forever when the bedtime stories he tells his niece and nephew start to mysteriously come true. BEDTIME STORIES is reminiscent of NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, but without a cohesive plot, jeopardy, danger, or something important at stake.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nTHE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES\n\nTHE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is a modern-day fairy tale about a boy who must get help from his family to stop an evil ogre from getting his hands on a mysterious book containing powerful insights into the world of fairies and magic. THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is exciting family fun for children over 10, with some positive messages about family and the dangers of the occult, but it requires caution for older pre-teens because of magical elements, some scary violence and brief foul language.\n\nFull Review ⇾\n\nSPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE\n\nSPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE is an animated comic book adventure where different incarnations of Spider-Man from other dimensions, including two females and a talking pig, team together to stop a ruthless crime boss from destroying reality by using a gigantic machine to bring back his dead wife and son. Playful and lively, SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE is an exciting, funny movie with lots of action, heart, and faith, but there’s plenty of intense action violence, so caution is advised for children.\n\nFull Review ⇾"
