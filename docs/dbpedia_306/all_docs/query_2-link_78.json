        "text": "Closet2Pride reception & documentary premieres March 2nd at Robinson Film Center!\n\nShreveport, LA – February 5, 2024\n\nPACE’s OUTnorthLa is delighted to announce a special premiere that will show halfway to our next film festival! Closet2Pride: A Memoir of Shreveport, a documentary about the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals in Shreveport, LA, will premiere at the Robinson Film Center in downtown Shreveport on Saturday, March 2, 2024. A reception will precede the premiere with a Q&A with the filmmakers Robert Darrow and David Hylan afterwards.\n\nCloset2Pride provides a historical background to the struggles and successes of the LGBTQ+ community, featuring heartfelt interviews, archival footage, and personal stories. The film examines the difficulties of coming out and living openly and authentically in a conservative and religious environment, and the discrimination, violence, and social stigma this community faces. It also celebrates the ways in which the LGBTQ+ community has united to fight for their rights, from earlier activists to present-day movements. It is a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggle for acceptance and equality. The film celebrates the strength and courage of the LGBTQ+ community and highlights the challenges they still face.\n\nPACE will host a reception before the film’s showing at the Robinson Film Center at 6 pm, Saturday, March 2nd, followed by the film premiere at 7:30 pm. The reception will feature the filmmakers, heavy hors d’oeuvres, and a cash bar; tickets for the reception ($10) can be purchased at the OUTnorthLa Film Festival website. Tickets for the film can be purchased through the Robinson Film Center website or box office. All tickets will go on sale February 21st. We expect tickets to go fast as many local residents of northwest Louisiana are interviewed in the documentary.\n\nFilmmakers Robert Darrow and David Hylan have both been very active in Northwest Louisiana for many years in various capacities. Both have doctoral degrees from LSU-Shreveport, both have been longtime LGBTQ+ activists, both have experience with documentary filmmaking, and both have led non-profit organizations in Shreveport. They are widely known and beloved throughout our region.\n\nRobert Darrow, retiring this spring as the longtime Managing and Artistic Director of the Shreveport Little Theatre, has been active in the theatre community for 54 years. In 1990, he helped establish The Philadelphia Center, northwest Louisiana’s HIV resource center. Darrow, along with Sherry Kerr, was the filmmaker on Shreveport Little Theatre: Maker of Dreamswhich premiered on Louisiana Public Broadcasting in 2023.\n\nDavid Hylan recently retired as the longtime Executive Director of the Betty and Leonard Phillips Deaf Action Center in Shreveport, and is enjoying life in Cozumel with his husband Troy. Hylan was a founding member of PACE, and along with Raydra Hall, was the filmmaker of Small Town Rage: Fighting Back in the Deep South which premiered at PACE’s 2016 film festival and which won the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities Documentary Film of the Year award.\n\nAll tickets for the reception and showing of Closet2Pride go on sale February 21st! Also mark your calendars for PACE’s 2024 OUTnorthLa Film Festival at the Robinson Film Center which will open the Friday after Labor Day, September 6, 2024.\n\nFor more information about PACE, “People Acting for Change and Equality”, Northwest Louisiana’s leading advocacy organization for the LGBTQ+ community, go to www.pacelouisiana.org or find us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pacelouisiana.\n\nContact Info\n\nWendell Riley, Executive Director, Robinson Film Center\n\nwendellr@robinsonfilmcenter.org\n\nRobert Darrow\n\nrkdarrow58@gmail.com\n\nDavid Hylan\n\ndavidhylanjr@gmail.com\n\nSubmitted by\n\nAdrienne Critcher\n\ncritcher@earthlink.net\n\nRobinson Film Center will host a screening of the 2021 Oscar-nominated documentary ‘Time’, featuring a live Q&A and book signing with the subjects of the film, Fox and Rob Richardson on February 12th at 1pm, as part of its Black History Month programming. The Shreveport screening will be part of a 3 city Louisiana tour for the couple, who are also releasing a book this month through the Baker Publishing Group.\n\nMedia Release from the St. Charles Center for Faith Plus Action:\n\nTime: Families, Faith, and Fairness in Sentencing\n\nThe St. Charles Center for Faith Plus Action and Foundation for Louisiana are excited to announce its sponsorship of a 3-city tour of Time, an Academy Award nominated full-length documentary, tells the story of Fox and Rob Rich’s relentless fight for each other and justice, despite America’s broken prison system. As Rob survived two decades at America’s bloodiest penitentiary and Fox raised their sons solo, they never stopped fighting for Rob’s freedom and for their futures against the statistical odds. This program comes in anticipation of the release of Time 2023, the literary companion to the film.\n\nDespite its worldwide acclaim and due to COVID, Time has never premiered in Louisiana. Through this thoughtfully designed 3-city tour, the viewing of the film will be combined with a panel discussion and Q & A with the film’s subjects and authors of Time 2023. Fox and Rob Rich will take participants into a deeper discussion of how faith, strength and community organizing not only brought Rob home, but has served to free countless others. And their fight continues.\n\nThis work will be held as part of the community engagement, narrative change, activation, and education of participants in the Center's programming to mobilize people of faith/conscience to come alongside the work of those most impacted by harms of the criminal legal system and builds necessary allyship to expand community working to address the harms of the criminal legal system.\n\nThe film showings begin in New Orleans, February 7, 2023, Shreveport on February 12, and followed by Baton Rouge on February 28. The significance of these cities goes beyond the geographic coverage of the state by beginning at the entry point for slavery in Louisiana – and the country – of New Orleans and ending in Shreveport, the last stand of the Confederacy in the Civil War. Baton Rouge provides a focus on the heart of legislative power for the state.\n\nThis partnership integrates into The Center’s arts-as education-and-activation programming. Louisiana is the epicenter for mass incarceration. The mass incarceration system financially and socially destabilizes many families of color and reduces economic means with multi-generational effects. Amplifying the voices and experiences of people directly impacted by the system - most of whom are black, brown, and poor - through productions like Time fuels the fire for change, bridging a gap between experience and understanding.\n\nParticipants who attend experience a transition from separateness to solidarity, enabling them to engage in collective action. Communities of faith and conscience are in a particularly strong position to help change the moral framework through which our citizens and communities view incarceration. The deepening of community working to be restorative problem solvers means a thriving New Orleans for all who live here.\n\nTime amplifies the multitude of problems undergirding the criminal legal system, the sentencing laws, and harms within carceral institutions while highlighting the strength of black families through this powerful story of fortitude, faith and love.\n\nMission Statement of The St. Charles Center for Faith Plus Action\n\nFocusing on racial justice and systemic issues within the criminal legal system, The St. Charles Center for Faith + Action (\"The Center\") builds a broader, more diverse community of people working actively to make a just and equitable New Orleans - and beyond. We tap the wellspring of energy of people of faith/conscience through immersive art events focused on the realities of the criminal legal system, retreats, seminars, and opportunities for spiritual growth.\n\nWith a grassroots community campaign focused on people of faith and people of conscious, we bring people together for experiences that drive them to amplify their engagement in building a stronger, more thriving New Orleans, through restorative justice lens to address the harms of the criminal legal system. Working at the intersection of sacred story and social justice action, The Center convenes faith leaders, community members, and experts to foster action and partnerships based on shared understandings and experiences leading to personal growth, public advocacy, and service to the community.\n\nCo-sponsors include:\n\n· Foundation for Louisiana\n\n· The St. Charles Center for Faith + Action\n\n· The Contemporary Arts Center\n\n· Robinson Film Center\n\n· Advancement Project\n\n· Watson Memorial Teaching Ministries\n\n· Equal Justice USA\n\n· Baker Publishing\n\n· National Council of Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact Caroline Durham at (504) 729-8189 or CDurham@StCharlesAve.Center\n\nRobinson Film Center, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit arts organization based in Shreveport, educates, enriches and entertains through the power of film. RFC exhibits independent, international and classic cinema daily in two movie theaters, with a full-service bistro and special events space upstairs. RFC provides film history and media literacy classes for all ages, focusing strongly on K-12 students and senior citizens. RFC also supports outreach programs that promote and strengthen the state’s film industry.\n\nThis awards season, RFC has put together a list of their own favorite movies of 2022. We hope this can give you some movie inspiration as we gear up for the Oscars!\n\nNote from Wendell Riley: I don’t get hung up on “Best of” lists because so much of it is subjective. The enjoyment of a film, beyond its technical merits, can boil down to a number of factors such as personal bias, the viewer’s mood at the time (of viewing and writing), viewing format, environment etc. That being said, here are some of our favorite films of 2022:\n\nWendell Riley’s Picks:\n\nRFC Executive Director\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once - I apologize (a little) to those who’ve had to listen to me rave about this film. I absolutely love it, but I know it’s not for everyone. The easiest way to describe it without spoiling anything is that it’s a film that pretentious film school students will be waxing poetic about for decades to come. Many will copy elements from it, and few will succeed in doing it this well.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin - The ultimate guy breakup movie. It’s heartbreaking, hilarious, profound, and really dark. The performances are amazing, the visuals are sublime, but the standout for me is Barry Keoghan as Dominic.\n\nX and Pearl - This is a dual entry, as Pearl was a surprise sequel to X. Both are fantastic films made on modest budgets but fueled by some great performances, particularly by Mia Goth. The final shot of Pearl is haunting and tragic, and while Goth won’t get much recognition outside of the horror community, her performances show a fantastic range of talent.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick - Top Gun: Maverick is proof that a blockbuster can have heart and a brain, even if said brain switches off from time to time for some amazing adrenaline-fueled action. The cinematography in this film is top-notch, and it’s a fun, nostalgic ride from start to finish.\n\nTill - This was a tough watch for me, but it earns a spot on my list for its importance. This is a story that has not been told nearly enough, and I will echo Mamie Till’s sentiment that people need to see it if we ever have a shot at healing and not letting history repeat itself.\n\nHonorable mentions: The Menu, Tár, Deadstream, The Batman, You Have No Idea\n\nAlexis Salinas’s Picks\n\nRFC Box Office Manager\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once - This film is as stunning as it is action-packed, funny, touching, and creative. Michelle Yeoh is at the top of her game with her performance and her chemistry with Ke Huy Quan is off the charts. I expect this to be on “must-watch” lists for many years to come.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick - Going into this film, I was certain that it would be just a cash-grab riding on the coattails of nostalgia. Instead, it was everything that a sequel should be, bringing life to a familiar story by honoring the original and continuing the characters’ journeys in a believable way. Also… what’s not to love about big planes going fast?\n\nTurning Red - As a girl who grew up in the early 2000s, a time ruled by friendship bracelets, boy bands, and Tamagotchis, this movie struck all of the right chords for me. I think everyone can relate to that time in their life when they were an awkward pre-teen and mortified by absolutely anything their family does.\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On - Everyone needs Marcel in their life. His humor, wisdom, and charm are so captivating. It’s impossible not to fall in love with him and cheer this little stop-motion shell on.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin - I have a deep love for live performance and this just felt so much like a straight play in the best way possible. The beauty of the Irish countryside and the cinematography pushed it over the top to create a gorgeous experience.\n\nThe Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent - Such an absurd, over the top film in the best way. After leaving the theater, I immediately called my friends to set up a watch party so they could enjoy it, too. If you’re looking for an easy watch with a lot of comedy, this is the one.\n\nMadison Kane’s Picks\n\nRFC Marketing Coordinator\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On - Marcel is the most adorable shell you might ever have the pleasure of meeting. As a fan of the OG YouTube video in my younger years, this one has a special place in my heart. Seeing Marcel bond with his Grandma Connie and search for his lost family brought my love for this little guy to a new level.\n\nWhite Noise - I’m always amazed by the stories that Noah Baumbach manages to create and capture. This film has so many aspects to it, I couldn’t take my eyes away and still haven’t stopped thinking about it. Not to mention, the cast is great and the supermarket closing scene is everything.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once – One of the most creative films I have ever experienced. The Daniels have a wild imagination and everything in the film is beautiful. I could watch this one over and over again!\n\nThe Menu – Clever, shocking, and captivating with some dark comedy and a surprise dessert at the end. What more could you ask for in a thriller?\n\nBrian and Charles - The quirky and unique relationship between Brian and his homemade robot friend, Charles, is more heartwarming than you would think. It may not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed this fun watch.\n\nRachael Hansil’s Picks\n\nRFC Education Director\n\nAmsterdam – Not what I was expecting, but it was a good time. And based on a true events, which I didn’t know going into it. It’s a little off-beat, and Christian Bale is just fantastic, as always.\n\nShe Said – I’m a sucker for journalism films, especially female led ones. It’s in the same vein as All the President’s Men, but gets more personal in the lives of its lead characters. It’s an important topic and worth a watch.\n\nGlass Onion – Listen, I know people had issues with this one, but I enjoyed it. It’s fun, easy to watch, and has some surprising cameos. And seriously, you can tell Daniel Craig is just having a good time. Give it a go.\n\nPersuasion – This is on my list because I watched it more than once. A rarity for me. I’m an Austen fan, and this was a fun take on Persuasion, which isn’t my favorite of her novels. It didn’t take itself too seriously, and neither did I. Enjoyed it a lot.\n\nDeath on the Nile – Make a star studded who-done-it, and I’m all in. I really enjoyed Kenneth Branagh’s Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express, so this was a no brainer for me. It’s exactly what you think it is set in the backdrop of Egypt. An easy weekend watch.\n\nRFC has got you covered with Christmas movie suggestions to get you through the Holidays! We'll be posting selections from staff members throughout the rest of this Holiday season for your viewing pleasure.\n\nWendell Riley’s Picks:\n\nRFC Executive Director\n\nGremlins (1984) - I have fond memories of seeing this as a kid and having my mind blown by the amazing puppetry and practical effects. The setup is great, and the chaos caused by the gremlins is good unclean fun. It’s a must-watch for me every year.\n\nNational Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation (1989) - For me this is peak Clark Griswold, one of cinema’s finest repressed and slightly angry lame dads with a heart. The movie hums along with episodic shenanigans until the parents and cousins show up, and then all hell breaks loose. I love it.\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (1944) - This is one I saw for the first time only a couple years ago and I immediately fell in love with it. Judy Garland is radiant in the film, and her performance of “Have yourself a merry little Christmas” is wonderful. The cast is great and they chew on some fantastic dialogue throughout, but my favorite character is Alonzo Smith played by Leon Ames, the hapless father (many times unknowingly) caught up in the dramatic lives of his children.\n\nA Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) - Take Charlie Brown’s existential dread and juxtapose it against Vince Guaraldi’s fantastic score and you have a film that feels light and breezy but stays with you for a long time after you see it.\n\nDie Hard (1988) - For some reason there is still a debate raging about whether or not this is an actual Christmas movie, but for me it’s THE Christmas movie. This is a film my mom took me to see as a kid, and up until that point I had never seen an action film that was shot so beautifully and that felt so larger-than-life, which seems counterintuitive since so much of the movie takes place in small confines. As Argyle says at the end of the film, “If this is their idea of Christmas, I gotta be here for New Year's!\"\n\nAlexis Salinas’ Picks:\n\nRFC Box Office Manager\n\nLove, Actually (2003) - What can I say? I’m a sucker for a good rom-com and I love the way these stories cleverly intertwine. The cast is stacked, the soundtrack is great, and the whole journey is such a fun time.\n\nRise of the Guardians (2012) - While technically set during the Easter Holiday, there’s plenty of winter holiday elements that can qualify it as a Christmas movie. Additionally, the animation is beautiful and the story just gives me the feel-good fuzzies that the holidays should!\n\nMickey’s Once Upon a Christmas (1999) - One of my favorite things about Christmas is getting to feel like a kid again. I practically wore out this VHS tape because I loved watching my favorite Disney characters over and over again. On top of that, each of the stories are so classic.\n\nA Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) - This film is a holiday staple in my household. We watch it every year, even if it’s on in the background, so it’s an integral part of my family’s celebration.\n\nThe Holiday (2006) - Such a fun movie with a fantastic cast; both Cameron Diaz’s character and Kate Winslet’s character are so relatable. Plus, every time the Mr. Brightside scene comes around, it’s impossible not to dance and sing along.\n\nMadison Kane’s Picks:\n\nRFC Marketing Coordinator\n\nElf (2003) - It’s smart, it’s silly and Will Ferrell is hilarious! Seeing Buddy learn the ways of the world outside of the North Pole, eat syrup on his spaghetti, and create wild snowflakes and etch-a-sketch drawings is a highlight of the holiday season for me. Elf is one of the only Christmas movies I will watch any time of the year.\n\nNational Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation (1989) - The Griswold family’s misadventures are always entertaining. I love how well written and completely relatable this movie is. It seems to become more relatable the older I get.\n\nHome Alone (1990) - This one brings a lot of Christmas nostalgia for me. I can remember my twin brother and I (unsuccessfully) attempting to recreate the obstacles from the movie as kids. My brother also strangely looked exactly like young Macaulay Culkin back then which made us both even more obsessed. We couldn’t help but wonder what kind of shenanigans might happen if we were left Home Alone for the holidays like Kevin.\n\nBad Santa (2003) - Bad Santa is definitely a different kind of Christmas movie. If you’re looking for holiday cheer, this may not be the one for you. The main characters are a bit rude and crass, but it makes for such a fun, exciting, laugh-out-loud adventure!\n\nA Christmas Story (1983) - You can’t help but love how quotable and iconic this movie is. My favorite scene is when Flick is triple dog dared to stick his tongue to a frozen flag pole. I watch this with my family while we open presents on Christmas morning, so it always gets me in the holiday spirit!\n\nMelissa Goslin’s Picks:\n\nRFC Interim Education Director\n\nCupid For Christmas (2021) - With so many holiday movies on television, this one stands out for its original premise and clever holiday crossover. It also gets bonus points for being directed by SBC native Blayne Weaver.\n\nRudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964) - I can’t even think about this film without all the childhood holiday feels taking over. I even remember the old Norelco commercial that played just before the titles on our Betamax (google it, kids!) tape. It’s chock full of wacky, lovable characters like Yukon Cornelius, Bumble, and Charlie-in-the-box. But, Hermey, the elf who wants to be a dentist, pushes this to the top of the stop motion Christmas list for me.\n\nElf (2003) - I was not a fan at first watch, but now I think I love this movie more every time I see it (which is every year). There’s just something about Will Ferrel’s wide-eyed portrayal of Buddy that gets straight to the magic of the holiday season.\n\nTrading Places (1983) - I think about the scene with down-and-out Dan Akroyd shoving a whole smoked salmon in his Santa suit way more than I should. It has all the laughs, a solid message, and Eddie Murphy at his absolute best.\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990) - That last moment when Kim (played by Wynona Ryder) realizes the snow is actually ice coming from Edward’s mountainous ice sculpting—well, what else could you possibly want from a Christmas movie?"
