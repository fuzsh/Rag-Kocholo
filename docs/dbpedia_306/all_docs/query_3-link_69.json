        "text": "You’ve been looking for Brave quotes, and you have found us (just like young Merida found her freedom!). We’re sure you’ll find some inspiration in many of Merida’s words, and learn a lot about what a princess should or should not be, according to Queen Elinor at the beginning of the film. Also featured: quotes from the hilarious King Fergus and the Witch, in all their eccentricities. Feast your eyes:\n\nPrincess Merida\n\n“Some say our destiny is tied to the land, as much a part of us as we are of it. Others say fate is woven together like a cloth, so that one’s destiny intertwines with many others. It’s the one thing we search for, or fight to change. Some never find it, but there are some who are led.”\n\n“I’m the princess. I’m the example. I’ve got duties, responsibilities, expectations. My whole life is planned out.”\n\n“Oats it is, then!”\n\n“I suppose a princess just does what she’s told!”\n\n“You’re the queen, you can just tell the lords, ‘The princess is not ready for this. In fact, she might not ever be ready for this! So, that’s that, good day to you. We’ll expect your declarations of war in the morning!’”\n\n“I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.”\n\n“Oh, that’s attractive.”\n\n“I am Merida, first-born descendant of Clan DunBroch, and I’ll be shooting for my own hand.”\n\n“This whole marriage is what you want! Do you ever bother to ask what I want?”\n\n“You’re a witch! That’s why the wisps led me here!”\n\n“I want a spell to change my mum. That’ll change my fate.”\n\n“I didn’t ask her to change you into a bear, I just wanted her to change you.”\n\n“The story of this kingdom is a powerful one. My dad rallied your forces and you made him your king. It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship, and it lives to this day.”\n\n“I’ve been selfish. I tore a great rift in this kingdom. There’s no one to blame but me. And I know now that I need to amend my mistake, and mend our bond.”\n\n“There are those who say fate is something beyond our command. That destiny is not our own. But I know better. Our fate lives within us. You only have to be brave enough to see it.”\n\nQueen Elinor\n\n“A bow, Fergus? She's a lady.”\n\n“Some say that will o' the wisps lead you to your fate.”\n\n“Enunciate. You must be understood from anywhere in the room, or it's all for naught!”\n\n“A princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom.”\n\n“A princess does not chortle, doesn't stuff her gob, rises early, is compassionate, patient, cautious, clean, and above all, a princess strives for, well, perfection.”\n\n“Merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table.”\n\n“Don't just play with your haggis!”\n\n“A princess does not raise her voice!”\n\n“Legends are lessons, they ring with truth.”\n\n“Merida, all this work, all the time spent preparing you, schooling you, giving you everything we never had, I ask you, what do you expect us to do?”\n\n“In accordance with our laws, by the rights of our heritage, only the first born of each of the great leaders may be presented as champion, and thus compete for the hand of the princess of DunBroch. To win the fair maiden, they must prove their worth by feats of strength or arms in the games. It is customary that the challenge be determined by the princess herself.”\n\n“You are a princess. I expect you to act like one.”\n\n“Go back to avenging your leg.”\n\nKing Fergus\n\n“Let's be off, before we see a dancing tattie-bogle.”\n\n“Leave her be. Princess or not, learning to fight is essential.”\n\n“None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter!”\n\nThe Witch\n\n“Oh, look around. You holler if you see anything you like. Everything is half off.”\n\n“Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber.”\n\n“That's ridiculous. Wood can't be imbued with magical properties. I should know, I'm a wi-whittler!”\n\n“I'm not a witch! Too many unsatisfied customers.”\n\n“Never conjure where you carve. Very important.”\n\n“The last time I did this, it was for a prince. He demanded I give him the strength of ten men, and he gave me this for a spell. A spell that would change his fate.”\n\n“Welcome to the Crafty Carver, home of bear-themed carvings and novelties. I am completely out of stock at this time, but if you’d like to inquire about portraits or wedding cake toppers, pour vial one into the cauldron. If you’d like the menu in Gaelic, vial two. If you’re that red-haired lass, vial three.”\n\n“By the second sunrise, your spell will be permanent, unless you remember these words: ‘Fate be changed. Look inside. Mend the bond torn by pride.’\"\n\nLord MacGuffin\n\n“Let these lads try and win her heart before they win her hand, if they can.”"
