        "text": "What are your favorite movies based on true stories?\n\nThey say that real life is stranger than fiction, so it only makes sense for screenwriters to turn to true stories when it comes time to put pen to paper.\n\nMovies based on true stories can be just as inspirational, harrowing, heartfelt, dramatic, unbelievable, and funny as those that are purely fiction. Plus, they have that intriguing “based on a true story” quality that makes them even more appealing to audiences.\n\nThe 40 movies on this list run the gamut from historical epics to musical memoirs to nose-to-the-grindstone narratives, but just because they’re all based on true stories doesn’t mean they’re all the same. There are many ways to tell a story, after all.\n\nSpotlight (2015)\n\nSpotlight follows a team of investigative reporters at the Boston Globe as they attempt to expose the systemic sexual abuse cover-up by the Catholic Church. This Best Picture-winning movie features a stellar ensemble, gripping drama, and a highly realistic portrayal of the journalistic process.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody (2018)\n\nNamed for one of their most well-known songs, Bohemian Rhapsody tells the story of Freddie Mercury and the formation of the legendary rock band Queen. The movie features all of the biggest Queen hits and culminates with an incredible recreation of the group’s famous Live Aid performance in 1985.\n\nOn the Basis of Sex (2018)\n\nBefore the notorious RBG became a beloved American icon, she was a hardworking, scrappy lawyer who decided to take on a tax law case that would become a landmark in gender discrimination. It doesn’t hurt that the screenplay was written by the late, great Supreme Court Justice’s very own nephew.\n\nHustlers (2019)\n\nThe story of a group of cunning, down-on-their-luck former strippers who decide to swindle their Wall Street clients by running up their credit cards sounds too crazy to be true. But in fact, Hustlers is based on real events detailed in a 2015 New York Magazine article.\n\nMoneyball (2011)\n\nMoneyball the movie was based on “Moneyball” the non-fiction book by Michael Lewis, who wrote about the Oakland Athletics’ 2002 season during which general manager Billy Beane attempted to rewrite America’s favorite pastime using an analytical, numbers-based “moneyball” approach — phew, that was a moneyball mouthful. But with Aaron Sorkin’s magnificent monologues and Brad Pitt’s gorgeous hair, how can you go wrong?\n\nWild (2014)\n\nCan you imagine hiking over 1,000 miles through the wilderness? Me either. I can’t even imagine hiking 10, but hey -- I’m a writer, not a hiker. Wild is the crazy true story of Cheryl Strayed, who, after her life fell apart, decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail on an epic journey of self-discovery and healing.\n\nGood Night and Good Luck (2005)\n\nIn the 1950s, an epic battle played out on the silver screen. The most interesting part? The men engaged in the battle didn’t actually interact with one another. Good Night and Good Luck tells the story of how journalist Edward R. Murrow and his CBS news team took on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his anti-Communist musings during the height of the Red Scare using their weapon of choice: television news.\n\nHidden Figures (2016)\n\nWe all know that NASA put a man in space in the 1960s, but until 2016, not many knew about the incredible women who helped make that happen. This feel-good biographical drama follows Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, three female mathematicians who worked at NASA during the height of the Civil Rights era.\n\nSchindler’s List (1993)\n\nThis classic film follows Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved over a thousand Polish Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. Spielberg’s epic WWII drama will go down as one of history’s most well-known movies based on a true story.\n\nJudy (2019)\n\nThough most people know her from The Wizard of Oz, Judy turns its eye on beloved actress Judy Garland. The film flashes back to her playing Dorothy Gale as a teenager but frames the overall story by focusing on Garland’s sold-out “Talk of the Town” concerts in London near the end of her life.\n\nLincoln (2012)\n\nYet another Spielberg historical epic, Lincoln follows America’s sixteenth president in the final four months of his life, as he works to abolish slavery at the end of the Civil War and cement his legacy.\n\nJackie (2016)\n\nPartly based on a Life magazine interview from 1963, Jackie provides an inside look at one of America’s most well-known First Ladies immediately following the most difficult experience of her life.\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nThis over-the-top black crime comedy is, indeed, based on the true story of disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Not only does it have a record amount of swear words, but The Wolf of Wall Street also features a protagonist who speaks directly to the audience about the legality and morality of his own actions.\n\nThe Big Short (2015)\n\nKnown for its inventive cameo appearances, fourth-wall-breaking narrator, and star-studded cast, Adam McKay’s comedy-drama explained how the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by a national housing bubble so well that it landed him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nThe Farewell (2019)\n\nNot all movies based on true stories are of the epic nature a la Lincoln or Schindler’s List. Sometimes the most affecting are those that come from very personal, very true stories, like Lulu Wang’s comedy-drama The Farewell. Based on Wang’s own life experiences, the movie follows a young 20-something Chinese American who travels to China with her family under the guise of a wedding, to see their terminally ill matriarch one last time.\n\nJulie & Julia (2009)\n\nThough we all eat three meals a day, not many biographical films focus on the kitchen. Julie & Julia, however, does just that. This comedy-drama tells interweaving stories of famous chef Julia Childs and young New Yorker Julie Powell, who set out to complete all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook in one year.\n\nRocketman (2019)\n\nSome people deserve a movie version of their life that’s just as fantastically epic as they are. Elton John happens to be one of those people. And the fantastical epic based on his life is Rocketman, a musical biopic that doesn’t hold anything back.\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nThe logline is simple: star-crossed lovers meet on a doomed ocean liner. The story at the center of James Cameron’s romantic epic may be fictional, but the backdrop of the story is entirely real — which makes this film truly unforgettable.\n\nWalk the Line (2005)\n\nWhen a musician makes it big, everyone wants to know how they became a star. Based on the singer’s own autobiographies, Walk the Line centers on country music artist Johnny Cash and tells the story of his romance with June Carter and explains how he sang his way to the top of the charts.\n\nI, Tonya (2017)\n\nIn real life, figuring out the truth comes down to conflicting he-said-she-said perspectives. I, Tonya embodies this like no other film. With an inventive framing device and characters whose recollections of the events differ drastically, this biographical comedy-drama about controversial figure skater Tonya Harding is a roller coaster ride from start to finish.\n\nThe Big Sick (2017)\n\nIt’s not often that romantic comedies are based on true stories, but when you have a romance as wild as Kumail Nanjiani’s, it’s totally deserving of a big-screen adaptation.
