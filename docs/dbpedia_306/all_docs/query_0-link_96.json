When Fleming was standing sentry in the moonlight by the river, why did the rebel soldier call to him to go back into the shadows? Why didn’t the rebel soldier just shoot him?\n\n3. What types of guns were the soldiers using? How did they work?\n\n4. Why was the soldier trying to take the pig? Was this legal? Have you ever heard the term “live off the land” or “requisition?” What do they mean?\n\n5. What was so important about taking the Confederate flag?\n\nCOURAGE IN WAR\n\n1. Why did the soldiers in the regiment think at first that they had lost half their men but realize later that only a few had been killed?\n\n2. What is a little red badge of courage as the term is used in this film?\n\n3. Why did the officers drill and drill the soldiers until the soldiers were sick of it?\n\n4. Remember that just before the Union soldiers charged, the drummer boys started playing their drums. What was the purpose of the drummers?\n\n5. Why were officers posted to positions behind the lines during each battle?\n\nREDEMPTION AND COMING OF AGE\n\n6. After Henry ran away, he heard a bird singing and threw a stick at it. Then, at the end of the movie, after Henry had been carrying the flag, he heard another bird singing and had a different reaction. Why?\n\n7. When Henry came back to the front lines, why wasn’t it enough for him to simply stand and fight like most of the other soldiers? Why did he put himself in special danger?\n\n8. Why did Henry confess to Wilson? Why didn’t he make a full confession?"
