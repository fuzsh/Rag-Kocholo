        "text": "In November 1940, three women of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were awarded 50% of all the Military Medals (MM) received by members of that service during the Second World War. They were stationed at RAF Biggin Hill in Kent, which suffered some of the worst air raids during the Battle of Britain. In a devastating attack on 30 August, 39 people were killed. The next morning, those who had survived reported for duty as usual, at the start of a day that would see further air raids.\n\nOn 15 September 1940, Flight Sergeant John Hannah was the wireless operator and air gunner in a Hampden bomber that was carrying out a raid on German invasion barges at Antwerp, Belgium. After releasing its bombs, the Hampden quickly came under attack from anti-aircraft guns. It took a direct hit, which started a fierce fire that soon engulfed the whole fuselage.\n\nGunner George James bailed out after the floor melted beneath him in the intense heat. Surrounded by flames, Hannah would have been justified in following him. But instead he began trying to put out the fire with the aircraft’s two fire extinguishers. When those were empty, he used his log book and then his own hands to stop the spread of the blaze. He worked for ten minutes in the blistering heat, as ammunition exploded around him and another member of the crew bailed out of the stricken aircraft.\n\nWhile on patrol over the Dover area in September 1940, Pilot Officer Eric Lock (pictured here on the left) of 41 Squadron RAF took on three Heinkel He 111s of the Luftwaffe and shot one down into the sea. He then attacked another German aircraft immediately afterwards, using cool determination and great skill to destroy it. He was awarded a Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for this daring act of flying in October 1940. The details of this award also stated that he had ‘displayed great courage in the face of heavy odds’ and had destroyed ‘fifteen enemy aircraft within a period of nineteen days.’\n\nPilot Officer Bill Millington was flying as part of a section on aerodrome guard patrol over Kent on 31 August 1940. A large number of German Dornier and Messerschmitt aircraft were sighted and the RAF pilots went into the attack. Millington managed to cause damage to one of the Dornier bombers but he soon found himself under fire from three Messerschmitts. He quickly put one out of action and shook off the other two.\n\nMillington was now outnumbered by the Luftwaffe aircraft but he didn’t leave the fight, and instead fired on the bombers. Now the Messerschmitt fighters began to target him, and he drew on all his flying skills to evade one and shoot another down. But as he did so, one more fired a cannon shell into the engine of his Hurricane, which also wounded him in the thigh.\n\nWhilst on a patrol in August 1940, Acting Flight Lieutenant Peter Brothers’ flight of eight aircraft came into contact with around 100 Luftwaffe bombers. Despite being so heavily outnumbered, Brothers (pictured here on the left) did not hesitate in immediately leading in his flight against the enemy. But before he could attack, he was fired at by a number of Messerschmitts. Brothers kept his cool and turned to face them. But he found himself in a stalled position and had to use all his skill to spin out of it and recover. He then sighted a Dornier 215 bomber, quickly targeting it and shooting it down. Later on, during the same day, he also destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109.\n\nPeter Brothers was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for these actions on 13 September 1940. By the time of the Battle of Britain, Brothers was an experienced RAF pilot. His outstanding leadership skills were a huge asset during those intense months. He led by example and did all he could to boost the morale of his men and, in particular, new pilots. Later in the war he was awarded a DSO for his 'courage and brilliant leadership'.\n\nFlying Officer Gordon Cleaver was defending his base, RAF Tangmere, from intense Luftwaffe air raids on 15 August 1940. Cleaver was an experienced fighter pilot who had already destroyed a number of enemy aircraft in operations over France.\n\nDuring the raid, he led his section with courage and determination against the German bombers. Cleaver went into the attack and destroyed one of the German aircraft. But his Hurricane was hit – a cannon shell smashed into it, shattering the cockpit’s hood and sending Perspex splinters into Cleaver’s eyes. With his aircraft damaged and his sight severely impaired, the obvious choice would have been to bail out. But he refused to abandon his aircraft and instead, with great difficulty, made a successful landing.\n\nCleaver was rushed to hospital where his sight was partially saved, but he was unable to continue his flying career in the RAF. In September 1940, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bold bravery in attacking the enemy bombers and in saving his aircraft despite such painful, impairing injuries.\n\nFlight Lieutenant James Nicolson (pictured here, centre) was on patrol near Southampton on 16 August 1940, when his Hawker Hurricanewas fired on by a German fighter aircraft. Making the ‘loudest noises [he] had ever heard’, four cannon shells thudded into his cockpit, damaging his machine, setting his petrol tank alight and wounding him in the eye, leg and heel. Surrounded by flames and with blood pouring down him from his injuries, Nicolson prepared to bail out. But just as he did so, he spotted a Messerschmitt Bf 110 ahead. Despite being in severe pain, he put down his parachute and reached instead for his gun controls. He poured fire into the German aircraft, keeping up his assault even as it tried to turn and twist away from him.\n\nAmong the many airfields targeted in raids on 15 August 1940 was RAF Driffield in Yorkshire. As part of 219 Squadron, which was stationed nearby, Sergeant Oswald Dupee and Sergeant Thomas Banister were scrambled to intercept the incoming Luftwaffe force. Dupee was the pilot and Banister the air gunner of their Blenheim bomber.\n\nThey engaged a German aircraft off the Yorkshire coast, but it soon stopped returning fire on them. Dupee closed in and was about to continue to attack the German aircraft when it opened its guns on them once more. The Blenheim’s front windscreen was smashed and Dupee was severely injured in his arm.\n\nActing Flight Lieutenant Jack Adams of 29 Squadron RAF was on a night patrol on 20 August 1940 when he saw a German aircraft around a mile in front of him. He had spotted a light in the rear gunner position, making it possible for him to follow it, in his Blenheim bomber, for 50 minutes. During this time, he lost communication with his base, RAF Digby, but carried on in spite of this, determined to destroy the German aircraft. Finally, he made contact with it off the south coast, near the Isle of Wight."
