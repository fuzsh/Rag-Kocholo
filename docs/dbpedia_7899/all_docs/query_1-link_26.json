All throughout town there are murals, picture cutouts, signs and more to celebrate everyone's favorite sailor. Chester is the hometown of Popeye's creator, E.C. Segar - and the community celebrates Popeye every day of the year! There is a Popeye souvenir shop called Spinach Can Collectibles, and visitors can also go on a scavenger hunt for all 15 Popeye Character Statues scattered about town! Each fall there is the Popeye Picnic celebration, where a new Popeye Character statue is unveiled and added to the character trail."
