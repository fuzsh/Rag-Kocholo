Grant, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama\n\nFour US presidents claim Illinois as their home state: Lincoln, Grant, Reagan and Obama.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but moved to Illinois as a child where he was raised. Today, tributes to President Lincoln can be found all throughout Illinois.\n\nSimilarly, Ulysses S. Grant was born in Ohio and moved to Illinois after his retirement from the military.\n\nRonald Reagan is the only US President to actually be born in Illinois, and there is a museum in his birth town of Tampico.\n\nFinally, Barack Obama, while born in Hawaii, has lived in Chicago for most of his adult life, and served as an Illinois senator."
