They are especially important in our effort to reduce health care disparities in underserved communities,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “More than 31 million people across the country – in every U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia – depend on health centers, making them a vital resource. The Biden-Harris Administration wants all Americans to have access to high-quality primary health care services, regardless of a patient’s ability to pay, and community health centers help make that possible.”\n\n“HRSA-funded community health centers make it possible for anyone in the community to access high-quality primary health care, regardless of income,” said HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson. “We are proud to serve millions more people and expand the community health workforce in rural and underserved areas all across the country.”\n\nHRSA-funded health centers are required to treat all patients regardless of ability to pay, and in 2023 more than 90 percent of health center patients had incomes less than 200 percent of the 2023 Federal Poverty Guidelines. Health centers are now serving one in eight children across the country, more than 9.7 million patients in rural areas, over 6.4 million patients who live in or near public housing, and over 1.4 million people experiencing homelessness. Health centers have also expanded their preventive services, screening hundreds of thousands more people for cancer and infectious diseases and caring for patients with substance use disorders.\n\nHealth centers continue to be leaders in quality of care, increasing access and improving clinical quality across the board. Quality improvements since 2020 include Administering more than 4 million HIV tests; Treating 585,000 prenatal care patients; and Improving clinical quality measures for chronic conditions, including hypertension control (+8%) and depression screening (+7%).\n\nHRSA’s Health Center Program is a cornerstone of our nation’s health care system, especially for those who are uninsured; enrolled in Medicaid; living in rural, remote, or underserved areas; struggling to afford their health insurance co-pays; experiencing homelessness; residing in public housing; or otherwise having trouble finding a doctor or paying for the cost of care.\n\nEach year during National Health Center Week, HRSA releases the prior year’s Uniform Data System (UDS) data, which all of the nearly 1,400 HRSA-supported health centers report annually.\n\nChange Healthcare Offers Free Credit Monitoring\n\nPosted May 9, 2024\n\nAs reported earlier this year, Change Healthcare, a Tennessee-based vendor for Hometown Health Centers, had a significant security breach. Because of the seriousness the U.S. Congress is investigating the impact on patients throughout the country. Hometown, up until recently, used this vendor to send patient their invoices.\n\nIn an effort to protect patient information likely compromised, Change Healthcare is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protections for two years.\n\nYou may contact Change Healthcare by calling (866) 262-5342 or go to this link: https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/ns/health-data-breach.html\n\nAccording to the company, “A dedicated call center is available to offer free credit monitoring and identity theft protections for two years to anyone impacted. The call center will also include trained clinicians to provide emotional support services.” It further noted, “Given the ongoing nature and complexity of the data review, the call center will not be able to provide any specifics on individual data impact at this time.”\n\nNews Alert for Hometown Health Centers Patients\n\nPosted April 10, 2024\n\nChange Healthcare, a Tennessee-based vendor used by hospitals, private practices, and community health centers throughout the country for services including patient billing, is the victim of a cyberattack impacting clients throughout the country. Criminals were able to penetrate their systems to obtain confidential information.\n\nHometown has used this vendor for some services. Any information that may have been compromised would be limited. Hometown also has contacted the company several times regarding how the compromised health information may impact you. It is still waiting for information.\n\nHometown holds its vendors to the highest standards. Please be advised Hometown contacted the New York State Attorney General’s Office, the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office, and the Administrators for Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Labor.\n\nAlthough this is not legal advice, Hometown urges you, even in the best of times, to always monitor your credit reports. Updates will be provided on this website as information is acquired or by letter sent by U.S. Post if appropriate."
