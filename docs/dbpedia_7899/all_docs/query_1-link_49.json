        "text": "Introducing the ButterBurger\n\nFun fact: The first ButterBurgers were made with an ice cream scoop. That’s right — fresh beef for the first ButterBurgers was “scooped” into perfect portions, then pressed into the grill to achieve the sear we know and love today.\n\nFrozen Custard Inspiration\n\nCraig knew just what to pair with his signature ButterBurger: Fresh Frozen Custard, a one-of-a-kind, richer-than-ice-cream treat rooted in Wisconsin that he fell in love with back when he was in college.\n\nGeorge Culver\n\nGeorge knew a quality product could make all the difference. It was his unwavering commitment to “doing it right” that laid the foundation for how we make our food today: handcrafted with care.\n\nOrigins of the Table Tent\n\nBecause every meal was made fresh for every guest, the Culver family needed a way to keep track of who ordered what. Enter: upside-down foam cups with handwritten numbers.\n\nRuth Culver\n\nKnown by her friends and family as the “Queen of Hospitality,” Ruth was a true people person who made everyone feel loved. She believed in taking care of every guest, every time. Her way of treating people continues to inspire us today.\n\nWelcome, Franchisees\n\nIn 1990, the first successful Culver’s franchise opened in Baraboo, WI. Back then, part of the deal was that the owner-operator would work right in the restaurant. That’s still true today.\n\nCheese Curds!\n\nWe’re from Wisconsin, so it was only a matter of time. We began serving our famous Wisconsin Cheese Curds in 1997 — and the love for these little golden curds even inspired us to create National Cheese Curd Day on Oct. 15.\n\nOur Fish Fry Tradition\n\nThe Culver family has strong roots in Midwestern supper clubs. Inspired by the way a good fish fry could bring friends and neighbors together, Craig carried the tradition forward. We still batter each filet by hand and cook it to order, only after you order.\n\nGIVE LOCAL\n\nOur franchisees are members of the communities where their restaurants are and have always looked for opportunities to support the folks who support Culver’s. Fundraising events, donations and sponsorships continue to be some of those ways.\n\nLea Culver\n\nLea truly believes we are all better when we take care of one another. From our team members to our guests to our communities, she reminds us that our restaurants are our greatest opportunities to serve others and do our part to make the world the best it can possibly be.\n\nThe Culver’s Foundation™\n\nServing our communities goes beyond the restaurant to help make sure all folks have access to basic needs, as well as to promote the development of our youth and their families.\n\nThank You Farmers® Project\n\nTo make sure we have enough good, wholesome food to serve our growing population, we started this project in 2013 to support agricultural education programs that encourage smart farming.\n\nCraig Culver\n\nFrom a freshly seared ButterBurger to simply holding the door for a guest, having an opportunity to brighten someone’s day is a very big deal to Craig. He founded Culver’s knowing people just want to be treated nicely — and hopes our guests continue to feel just as welcomed 50 years from now."
