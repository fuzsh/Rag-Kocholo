Senator Durbin has been elected to this leadership post by his Democratic colleagues every two years since 2005.\n\nDurbin serves as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and sits on the Appropriations and Agriculture Committees.\n\nElected to the U.S. Senate on November 5, 1996, and re-elected in 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2020, Durbin fills the seat left vacant by the retirement of his long-time friend and mentor, U.S. Senator Paul Simon.\n\nSenator Durbin makes approximately 50 round trips a year between Washington and Illinois. He is married to Loretta Schaefer Durbin. Their family consists of three children--Christine (deceased), Paul, and Jennifer--as well as six grandchildren. They reside in Springfield."
