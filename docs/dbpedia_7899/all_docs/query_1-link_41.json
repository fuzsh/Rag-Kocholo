        "text": "So, there you have it. We don’t know Coach Beard’s full name, but we now know he’s from our very own Peoria. Wonder if he’s a Richwoods guy or maybe attended old Woodruff High School? Since he's a soccer guy, he might have ties to Illinois power Peoria Notre Dame, right?\n\nBut one thing we must know: Does he like Avanti’s?\n\nThe hometown reveal — assuming he's not talking about Arizona, of course — is not a huge surprise given that the actor portraying Beard is Chicago native Brendan Hunt, 50, who is co-creator of the show and a writer. He attended Illinois State University in Normal and studied with the famed Chicago comedy troupe The Second City.\n\nHunt also mentioned Peoria during a 2021 interview published online with Vanity Fair, hinting that Beard's history could include the River City.\n\n\"My sort of backstory that I have for him is, I don’t think he’s from Kansas, like Ted, but I do think he’s from central Illinois, like Peoria or something,\" Hunt said in story by Anthony Breznican published on July 30, 2021. \"I went to school in that neck of the woods. So I feel a bit of kinship.\"\n\nAnd the Peoria ties do not stop there.\n\nPeoria High graduate Lisa Helfrich Jackson, also a 1986 graduate of Bradley University, is a production executive for the show. Jackson, a senior vice president of production for Warner Bros., has worked on multiple award-winning TV shows. The Peoria native has two Emmy awards for her production work on \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\"\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" might not be done with Peoria.\n\nAccording to an interview with Awards Radar, Hunt says we might be finding out more about Beard as the third season concludes. Interviewer Steven Prusakowski asks Hunt if he has a backstory for Beard.\n\n\"Sure, I do have a backstory,\" Hunt said, \"but I’m afraid I cannot share it with you. As that would be tiptoeing dangerously close to a spoiler. You see, we see a few more things about Beard coming up in these last few episodes.\""
