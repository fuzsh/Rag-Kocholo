        "text": "The first stop when we get to Charleston\n\nis we are stopping\n\nand getting a sweet tea, immediately.\n\nHi, I'm Madelyn Cline and I'm going to personally\n\nshow you around Charleston.\n\nLet's go.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWhat makes Charleston a special place for me,\n\nfor starters, I am from there, so it is home.\n\nI'm from about 30 minutes outside of it.\n\nMy family is still there,\n\nso when we go shoot Outer Banks,\n\nwhich we shoot in Charleston I get to see my family.\n\nSo there's a lot of really special memories\n\nwrapped up in that city.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nIf I were gonna take you for coffee in Charleston\n\nI would first take you to The Daily.\n\nThat is my absolute favorite spot in Charleston\n\nto get coffee.\n\nI know everybody there.\n\nThey're always so friendly.\n\nThey make their almond milk in-house,\n\nand they do an incredible avocado toast.\n\nThe food is amazing.\n\n[jazzy music]\n\nThese are Benne Wafers and they're made with,\n\nI think it's like a lot of, I'm not sure how to make them.\n\nBut I know they're special 'cause they have sesame seeds\n\nin them. [wafer crunching]\n\nAnd they're kind of salty, super crispy.\n\nThey're like the Charleston cookie.\n\nAlso not pictured, get you some okra candy.\n\nThat's like final blast of Charleston sweets.\n\nAnd then there's also, these are pralines.\n\nI don't know why they're special,\n\nother than they just taste great.\n\nThey're like... [Madelyn giggling]\n\nI feel my blood sugar spiking.\n\nYou can find these things literally everywhere.\n\nThey are signatures of Charleston.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell you always have to do your lemon.\n\nThis is not gonna be graceful.\n\nSorry.\n\nLaughs maniacally.\n\nGive it a good stir.\n\nSweet tea's not sweet tea\n\nif there's not a little lemon in it.\n\nDelicious.\n\nYou can get this anywhere.\n\nIt's not just a Charleston staple, it's a southern staple.\n\nI also love that y'all put it in a mason jar.\n\nThat's so cute.\n\nAnd then we also, when you order half and half,\n\nit's like half sweet, half unsweet.\n\nI remember the first time I ordered half and half,\n\nI think I was in New York,\n\nand they came with like a half and half,\n\nlike what you put in your coffee,\n\nlike dairy product.\n\nI understood why they looked at me so strange\n\nis because I was asking for just straight half and half.\n\nIt just tastes like home.\n\nI have been known to be late for work\n\nbecause I was stuck in traffic\n\nin the drive-through to get a sweet tea.\n\n[bell dinging]\n\nI'm gonna get in trouble for that.\n\nOh well.\n\n[crew laughing]\n\nNo one's taking this.\n\nYes.\n\n[jazzy music]\n\nEverybody has their own opinions.\n\nOysters, that's a very personal experience.\n\nHowever, if I'm taking you to get the best oysters\n\nI'm taking you to Leon's Oysters & Poultry.\n\nBasically it's fried chicken and oysters,\n\nwhich I don't think you can get more southern than that.\n\nThey have the best oysters,\n\nthe best fried chicken, and the best orange wine,\n\nwhich for me is a successful dinner.\n\nIt's salt,\n\nstarch,\n\nbutter,\n\nand sweet tea.\n\nThose are the four pillars of a southern diet.\n\n[rhythmic music]\n\nI don't really go out in Charleston too much,\n\nbut if I'm really feeling like ripping,\n\nI would probably take you to El Jefe\n\nbecause there's a mechanical bull.\n\nShots and a mechanical bull is just like,\n\na recipe for a great night.\n\nAnd then at that point, anywhere sounds fun.\n\nEnough tequila we could go anywhere.\n\nWe could go to Trio, we could go to Republic,\n\nwe could go skinny-dipping.\n\nWe could go to Folly Beach and skinny-dip.\n\nI think that's illegal though.\n\nMy friends and I, when I was in high school,\n\nwe used to have this little place\n\nat the very, very end of Folly Beach.\n\nThere's this little clearing in the grass,\n\nand we would set up a little fire\n\nand then we would go and shoot Roman candles at each other.\n\nThat's my kind of night.\n\n[jazzy music]\n\nIf you're gonna go shopping in Charleston,\n\nyou know what's really fun is they shut down King Street\n\nand so you can walk in the middle of the road\n\nand everybody's out with their dogs, and there's vendors.\n\nAnd one of my favorite vendors,\n\nRed Rose Vintage, she has like a little truck,\n\nand she has vintage that comes through all the time\n\nand she has some really cool pieces.\n\nAnd I love that it's in like a little van.\n\nI've given her a lot of my money.\n\nThere's a really great shop called Worthwhile\n\nthat has very curated, cool like candles,\n\nclothes made by like small designers, local designers.\n\nReally, really cool place.\n\nThat's one of my favorite places in Charleston.\n\nTo see the most beautiful sunset,\n\nI would take you to Shem Creek, which is in Mount Pleasant.\n\nThere are restaurants literally on Shem Creek\n\nand you can sit and watch a sunset and have a beer\n\nor get bottomless crab legs, or eat oysters.\n\nUp to you.\n\nBeautiful usually because the fishing boats are coming in.\n\nThere's dolphins, so you can see dolphins in the creek.\n\nIt's very, very postcard-like.\n\n[relaxing music]\n\nA little bit less touristy.\n\nThe Old Village in Mount Pleasant\n\nis really picturesque and beautiful.\n\nWe shoot there quite a bit.\n\nIt's really, really lovely.\n\nPeople are just on their bikes or walking their dogs.\n\nIsle of Palms is great.\n\nIt is touristy, but also again,\n\nthey have an amazing strip of restaurants.\n\nThey've got a really great place called Poe's\n\nwith like sandwiches.\n\nMex 1, which is tacos,\n\nI can't remember the place,\n\nbut they have a frozen rosé, a frosé.\n\nYou can just go to the beach, get your frosé,\n\nand just sit there and let your mind go to mush.\n\n[relaxing music]\n\nI did grow up going to some theaters in the area.\n\nI used to go see the ballet a lot with my mom.\n\nThere's a very small theater\n\nand the company is called The Flowertown Players.\n\nThat was where I did my very first play\n\nthat wasn't a school play.\n\nThere's another theater downtown called Theatre 99,\n\nand that's like Charleston's improv troupe theater.\n\nThat's definitely a like very local's activity,\n\nand hilarious.\n\nAnd that was kind of where I got that spark\n\nfor theater again.\n\nIt was just so much fun and very freeing.\n\nIt's a great little place to go.\n\nGet tickets online in advance.\n\nThey sell out quick.\n\nCharleston is tiny.\n\nIt is an extremely small world.\n\nBut also the people are incredibly warm and friendly,\n\nand that's always really lovely to come back to.\n\nI love getting on a plane to go back home\n\nand hearing the pilot come over the speaker\n\nand be like, Hey y'all,\n\n[Madelyn giggling]\n\nwith a southern accent and greet everyone.\n\nSparks joy.\n\nJust talking about Charleston gets me really excited,\n\nand I hope you guys want to go check it out for yourself.\n\nIs there vodka in that?\n\n[crew laughing]"
