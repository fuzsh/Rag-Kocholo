        "text": "HINSDALE, Ill. (WLS) -- The Hinsdale Little League team is advancing to the Little League World Series.\n\nA watch party was held Wednesday in Hinsdale as fans cheered on the hometown team.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nHinsdale Little League is representing the state of Illinois. The 12-U team has been playing in the Little League Great Lakes regional tournament with the hopes to represent the region in the World Series, and that wish has come true.\n\nThey were up against Indiana in the regional championship in Whitestown, Indiana, and they won the game with a walk-off hit and a final score of 8-7.\n\n\"A little stressful. I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, but what a game,\" said Frank Favia, co-president of Devil's Baseball Club.\n\n\"This was amazing, this was much better than watching the pro ball players. These kids, the emotion. It was so intense out there for those pitchers,\" said Brian McGrath, spectator.\n\nJust days ago, the team has a comeback win in a nail-biter of a game against Kentucky.\n\nThe Hinsdale community has been rallying behind their little hometown athletes. At Fuller House, every TV was set to the game and people there were excited to cheer on the team.\n\n\"What a thrill for the community what a thrill for those families, for these families, for those kids, for these kids. We couldn't be prouder of these kids. A very exciting time for Hinsdale,\" Favia said.\n\nMcGrath said he's known most of the players since they were five years old, having coached them in the past.\n\n\"When they got the win it's like you're so happy for them and it's hard to put into words but it's just a really good feeling,\" he said."
