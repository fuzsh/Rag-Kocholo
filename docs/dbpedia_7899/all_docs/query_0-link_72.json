        "text": "CALUMET, Mich. (WLUC) - While you can’t turn lead into gold, you can make plastic into food.\n\n“We’re here demonstrating basically a process that was designed to take plastic waste and use both chemical and biological processes to convert those into food and fuel products,” Michigan Tech University (MTU) Research Assistant Professor Lindsay Putman said.\n\nOn Wednesday, this process is what the BioPROTEIN research team aimed to show attendees during a demonstration of their work. The team is made up of students from Michigan Tech University and members from Western University and the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) kicked things off with a request for technology that could turn waste into resources. It’s an $8,000,000 project that has been ongoing for four years.\n\n“Part of being able to use these is to decrease waste that we have going into the natural environment,” Putman said. “But it’s also waste and energy, basically things that can be turned into other useful materials.”\n\nMaterials created through the process include a protein powder similar to vegemite, lubricants, gases and even wax for candles. The process takes between 24 to 48 hours.\n\nOne challenge the project is facing is preventing products from being toxic.\n\n“Any kind of product that would be food needs to be analyzed with much greater scrutiny,” Project Principal Investigator Steve Techtmann said. “So far, we’ve found that all the tests that we’ve done are looking positive and that it is non-toxic.”\n\nTechtmann says there is still work to be done.\n\n“[The project is] scaled to the point that it can make enough product to be useful,” Techtmann said. “And we really just need to find ways of making it robust enough to then be used in a field setting.”\n\nMembers of DARPA will be visiting the Keweenaw Research Center on Thursday to see the project in action."
