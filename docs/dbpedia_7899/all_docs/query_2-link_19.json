        "text": "In April, when Kelsea Ballerini and a production crew arrived in Knoxville to shoot her \"Half of my Hometown\" music video, many were eager to catch a glimpse of the singer.\n\nCentral High School’s football stadium, iconic breezeway and the stairs embellished with cheerleaders' numbers all have a starring role in the video.\n\nThe Shopper News asked a few those who were part of the process what it felt like.\n\nIn a year filled with lasts for longtime, retiring cheer coach Jackie Raley, the music video was a first.\n\n“My 10th year coaching was actually last year, when COVID hit. I didn’t feel like I could bail on them; I wanted a smooth transition,” Raley said. “I went to turn in my keys and they said ‘You aren’t officially retired until we shoot the Kelsea video.' It was wild. It was great for the kids.”\n\n'We knew months in advance' about Ballerini video\n\nThe video shoot was scheduled and rescheduled.\n\n“We knew months in advance, but they wanted to keep everything quiet,” Raley said. “I was there on a Monday night on the track running and I didn’t even know until they parked five vans on the track.\n\nMore: Childhood dreams come true for Kelsea Ballerini with Jonas Brothers tour\n\nMore: Kelsea Ballerini shoots video in Knoxville. What makes Gibbs Drive a film spot?\n\n\"Kelsea wore a stunning red dress in the middle of the football field. As she sang that song, she really teared up, you could tell it was a special place for Kelsea and that she loved Central so much.”\n\nRaley had to put the call out to her junior and senior cheerleaders. “I couldn’t tell them why; if you tell teenagers, then it would come out,” she said. “They didn’t want any bystanders just watching; you had to be in it.”\n\nBallerini fit right in with cheerleaders\n\nWhen Ballerini changed into a cheerleader uniform, Raley said she confessed to the cheerleaders that they were helping her fulfill a dream she had growing up.\n\nCentral Bobcats had a variety of uniforms for the production staff to choose from. “They picked the one with ‘Central’ across the chest. That was the first uniform I bought when I came to the school,” Raley said. “I am really good at sizing the girls and was able to pick out the girl from my team whose uniform Kelsea would fit best. We fit her pretty much to a tee and asked Kelsea to autograph the sophomore’s shoes she wore.\n\n“Kelsea had that genuine personality; she was a lot of fun,” Raley said. “We shot a lot of things that weren’t in the video. Having her at Central was really special for us, something we will never forget. It just gives you chills, all of it was perfect.”\n\nRaley recalls seeing Ballerini singing and playing the guitar in the Central High School auditorium years before. “She was a sophomore and I remember her singing a song she actually wrote,” Raley said. “I said to my sister, ‘She needs to go to Nashville.’”\n\nSenior cheerleader Morgan Mcswain was handpicked by the Nashville crew to be in some scenes.\n\n“Our coach did a very good job of keeping it a secret,” said Mcswain. “I had no idea what we were volunteering for, we were just told that we wouldn’t want to miss it.”\n\nMcswain — who cheered through the youth Baby Bobcat program, on the Gresham Middle School team and all four years at Central — said she was surprised at first to see Ballerini in the uniform.\n\n“She fit right in and actually getting to talk and laugh with her was pretty cool. Getting to be a part of the music video was so special, especially right as I’m graduating — it’s a memory I’ll never forget.\n\n“The video does a perfect job of capturing Friday nights after the football games and Central’s school spirit as a whole,” she said. “Getting to see the whole thing come together was amazing.”\n\n'Half of My Hometown' brings out Central High pride\n\nNoah Nance, a senior and member of the Bobcats football team, said he was asked to put on his cap and gown in a scene. “When I saw the video, I thought ‘Wow, I really went there’,” said Nance, who was with one of his buddies in a scene. “It kind of gives us this sense that she really does care for this community and our school.\n\n\"School pride really goes back a long time in my family — my grandmother, my dad and my three brothers all graduated from Central. It felt weird to see myself in the cap and gown. I had grown up playing for Central and have everything Central at my house.”"
