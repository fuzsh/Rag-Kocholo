        "text": "Should I file an income tax return if I live in another state but worked in Illinois?\n\nQuestion\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat is the tax rate for property taxes?\n\nAnswer\n\nAnswer\n\nPage Content\n\nThere is no set rate for property tax in Illinois. Your tax bill is based on two factors, the equalized assessed value (EAV) of your property, and the amount of money your local taxing districts need to operate during the coming year.\n\nMost property is assessed at 33 1/3 percent of its fair market value.\n\nFarmland is assessed based on its ability to produce income (its agricultural economic value). A farm building is assessed at one-third of the value that it contributes to the farmâ€™s productivity. ( Farm home sites and farm dwellings are assessed at one-third of their market value.)\n\nCook County uses a different system that assigns assessment levels to different classes of property. Assessment levels range from 10 percent of market value for residential property to 25 percent of market value for commercial property.\n\nOther specific types of properties may qualify for a preferential assessment as permitted by law.\n\nSee our General Property Tax Information and Resources web page for more information."
