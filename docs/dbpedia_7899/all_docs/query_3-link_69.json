        "text": "Chicago is an American city located in the Midwest and appears in Invincible. It is one of the locations to be damaged by the world-changing battle between Invincible and Omni-Man.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn Where I Really Come From, Nolan asks him if it made a difference that he had killed him since he would have only lived another 50 years, but Mark tells him he could have had a life. Nolan asks if that had hurt him and punches him away over to Chicago, where he caused a lot of destruction with the fall. As a building falls, Mark pushes it so it does not, but he cannot stand the weight and it crushes everybody inside. He starts crying and asks Nolan how he could have done such a thing, and he tells him that his stubbornness to stop the inevitable has killed them. He asks Mark how many people needed to die and tells him that he knew he was right. Mark asks him if his mother's life is meaningless and Nolan that in the grand scheme of things, it is, which makes Debbie cry. Mark asks him how he could say such a thing and punches Nolan, who is angered because, for the first time in his life, he was telling Mark the truth. The City was in ruins as the fight continued between the subway smashed and killing innocent people. The Guardians and Eve mobilize to aid Chicago relief efforts as the world learns of Omni-Man's betrayal while Cecil helps Debbie and Mark by falsifying Nolan's civilian death.\n\nResidents[]\n\nInvincible\n\nAtom Eve\n\nGlobal Defense Agency\n\nOmni-Man\n\nDebbie Grayson\n\nGary\n\nGary's Daughter\n\nJessica Duvall\n\nAmber Bennet\n\nWilliam\n\nCurt\n\nTitan\n\nVanessa\n\nFiona\n\nAppearances[]"
