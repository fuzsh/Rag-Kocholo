        "text": "Springfield, Ill. – The Prairie Research Institute (PRI) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) marked a significant milestone with a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the upcoming testing and operations of the large-scale pilot testing of the Linde-BASF advanced post-combustion CO2 capture technology at City Water, Light and Power’s Dallman 4 coal-fired power plant in Springfield.\n\n“As someone who has researched carbon capture for over twenty years, it is gratifying to see carbon capture achieve this milestone. It is especially exciting to see how state and local support has enabled the construction of a facility that is globally recognized. It demonstrates Illinois’ leadership in carbon capture,” said Kevin O'Brien, director of the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center (ISTC) and the Net-Zero Center of Excellence at the Prairie Research Institute (PRI).\n\nThe $80 million project, funded by DOE, Linde/BASF and the state of Illinois, is a groundbreaking initiative to position Illinois as a leader in carbon capture research and development.\n\n“This phase is the last step in the development process to de-risk technologies before they go to commercial operation or commercial demonstration,” said Ronald Munson, point source carbon capture technology manager, NETL, DOE. “To see the progression of the technology and to see the application of the approach the Department of Energy has adopted is really gratifying.”\n\nThe Phase III pilot, which retrofits Dallman 4, is the largest of its kind globally, promising substantial economic and environmental benefits.\n\n“It is essential we have solutions to meet environmental goals through carbon capture to power our nation's infrastructure, power our homes and businesses, and support the operations of our manufacturers,” said City Water, Light and Power Chief Utility Engineer Doug Brown. “Just as power plants require sustainable solutions, so will manufacturers need to rely on low-carbon processes to meet these goals.”\n\nPRI projects that the construction and operation of the Dallman Unit 4 carbon capture facility will have a baseline regional economic impact on construction and jobs of at least $47.1 million, and it will generate tax revenue of more than $5.6 million.\n\nSpringfield Mayor Misty Buscher, alongside State Senator Doris Turner, State Representative Mike Coffey, State Representative Sue Scherer, and representatives from the offices of U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth, acknowledged the collaboration and support to bring the project forward along with local jobs benefits.\n\n“By providing Dallman 4 as host site, we are bringing a number of union jobs to our community for the construction and operation of the plant along with large opportunities for the future,” said City of Springfield Mayor Misty Buscher. “I’m thrilled that with our PRI partnership, our city and this workforce are at the forefront in such a hallmark project to help find the solutions needed to safeguard our environment for future generations.”\n\nWith city, state, and federal officials, the ribbon-cutting was led by key project stakeholders, including Kevin O'Brien, director of the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center (ISTC) and the Net-Zero Center of Excellence at the Prairie Research Institute (PRI); Bob Flider, senior director of community and government relations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; PRI Executive Director Praveen Kumar; Springfield Mayor Misty Buscher; Ronald Munson, point source carbon capture technology manager, NETL, U.S. Department of Energy; Doug Brown, chief utility engineer of City Water, Light and Power (CWLP); Aaron Gurnsey, president of the Central Illinois Building and Construction Trades Council and business agent of Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137; and representatives from project partner companies Linde and BASF.\n\n---\n\nMedia contact:\n\nAngie Coy, wisehart@illinois.edu, 217-265-4677"
