        "text": "The Voice has been Blake Shelton's home away from home for 23 seasons.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch the Season 26 premiere of The Voice on Monday, September 23 at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.\n\nBut where is Blake Shelton's real home — the place where he hangs his cowboy hat when he and fellow Coaches Kelly Clarkson, Chance the Rapper, and Niall Horan aren't focused on guiding talented new performers?\n\nWell, Shelton currently lives with his family in Oklahoma. His sprawling Ten Point Ranch is located close to the community of Tishomingo, which Country Fancast has described as his “adopted hometown.”\n\nShelton has actually said that a reason he’s giving up his gig as a Coach after this season is to spend more time there with his wife, Gwen Stefani, whom he met on The Voice, as well as his three stepchildren.\n\n“I think being a stepdad has changed my perspective in that I’m not the first person that I think about anymore,” he told Access.\n\nRELATED: Who Are Blake Shelton's Most Frequent Songwriting Partners?\n\nBeing a Coach requires “150 percent” of focus, Shelton explained: “I just feel like those days are behind me for now. I got a more important job.”\n\nOklahoma is a beautiful place to get busy with the fulfilling job of being a family man. Shelton connects the message of his hit song “God’s Country” to the Sooner State.\n\n“It’s really about a state of mind. Wherever you’re from and how you feel about that place. For me, it’s about being from Oklahoma – where I was born, raised, and still live today,” Shelton said of the song in 2019.\n\nShelton grew up in Ada, Oklahoma on a street with a bit of star quality — South Broadway Boulevard — that may have predicted his entertainment lifestyle.\n\nBack in 2018, when Shelton’s mother listed his childhood house for sale, Realtor.com reported that the most unusual feature of the house was a “rustic room” paneled in reclaimed barn wood. Clearly, Shelton's country roots run deep.\n\nShelton's community ties to Oklahoma are as rich and varied as the singing styles as the contestants on The Voice.\n\nThe country music man recently donated $200,000 to the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, according to NBC Insider. He has also given generously to the Jimmy Everest Center, an Oklahoma University children’s hospital, and stepped up for the United Way of Oklahoma by spearheading the 2013 NBC telethon “Healing in the Heartland: Relief Benefit Concert.”\n\nShelton's singing career does means he’s often away from home, whether he’s Los Angeles filming The Voice or on stage performing in his Back to the Honky Tonk tour.\n\nIn addition to his ranch in Tishomingo, Shelton has another home in Lake Texoma, Oklahoma, according to archute.com. The architecture-focused site reported in March 2023 that Shelton also has a home in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. Shelton formerly had residences in Tennessee.\n\nBut Oklahoma is his true comfort zone, he told PEOPLE. “That’s where I feel the most comfortable, happy and safe.”"
