        "text": "Fleeing or Attempting to Elude the Police\n\nBeing pulled over by a police officer can be a frustrating and, sometimes, frightening experience. But, once directed to bring your vehicle to a stop, it is always best to keep calm and pull over in a safe place. You may have seen suspects on television or YouTube videos attempting to outrun and elude the police. These chases are extremely dangerous, sometimes resulting in fatal collisions.\n\nWhat happens to those who don't pull over? In Illinois, you can be arrested and charged with Fleeing or Attempting to Elude a Police Officer.\n\nIn Illinois, fleeing from a police officer is a criminal offense with serious potential consequences. If you don't cooperate when you are directed to pull you over by a police officer, you face penalties including the suspension of your driver’s license, high fines, and even jail time.\n\nWhat Does the Law Require?\n\nSection 11-204 of the Illinois Vehicle Code requires that you comply when a police officer directs you with an audible or visual signal to stop your vehicle. The signal may be by hand, voice, siren, red or blue light.\n\nThe law requires that the officer giving the signal be in a police uniform. If the officer is driving a vehicle at the time the stop is initiated, the vehicle must display illuminated oscillating, rotating or flashing red or blue lights in addition to an audible horn or siren, which would indicate that the vehicle is an official police vehicle.\n\nPenalties for Fleeing and Eluding Police in Illinois\n\nFleeing or attempting to elude the police is a criminal offense under Illinois law. This offense is typically charged as a Class A misdemeanor. The maximum penalty is up to 1 year in jail and a $2,500.00 fine plus mandatory court costs.\n\nIf you are convicted of this offense, the Illinois Secretary of State will suspend the offender's driver’s license for 6 months. A second offense will result in 1-year suspension.\n\nFleeing and eluding the police can be charged as a Class 4 felony for a 3rd or subsequent offense, punishable by one to three years jail time and a $25,000 fine.\n\nAggravated Fleeing and Eluding\n\nFurthermore, this offense can be charged as a Class 4 felony if any of the following also occur at the time of the offense:\n\nThe offender drives 21 mph or more over speed limit\n\nThe offender causes bodily injury to any individual\n\nThe offender causes property damage in excess of $300\n\nThe defendant disregards more than two (2) or more traffic control devices (i.e. stop sign, stop light)\n\nThe offender conceals or alters the vehicle’s registration plate.\n\nA conviction for aggravated fleeing and eluding will result in a revocation of the defendant’s driver’s license. A second or subsequent offense may be charged as a Class 3 felony. A vehicle used in commission of the offense is subject to seizure and forfeiture.\n\nPossible Defenses to Fleeing and Eluding the Police\n\nEven though you've been charged with a crime, it doesn't mean you are guilty. Possible defenses include:\n\nLack of Intent – You didn't know the police were pursuing you.\n\nThreats – You were forced to evade due to threats.\n\nMistaken Identity – You own the car, but you weren't driving.\n\nNecessity – You were in an emergency situation and you couldn't stop.\n\nHow we can Help\n\nIt is always best to seek the legal representation of an experienced lawyer when charged with a criminal offense. If you've been charged with Fleeing and Eluding in Illinois, contact the defense attorneys at The Davis Law Group, P.C.\n\nThe legal team at The Davis Law Group, P.C. has been defending the people of Illinois against traffic-related offenses for decades.
