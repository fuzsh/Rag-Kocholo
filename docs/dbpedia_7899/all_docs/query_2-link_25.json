        "text": "I love using a small business for any and all of my needs in life, and this pharmacy is the perfect example of why! The second time I went into this location, the pharmacists and pharmacy technicians knew me by name and were a big part of making me feel welcome as a new member of the Big Rapids community! This store has a really nice selection of gift items in addition to the standard medical supplies. They even offer a short-term layaway plan year-round so I don’t have to find a hiding place for upcoming birthday gifts!”\n\nNICOLE\n\n\"\n\nAwesome people and quick fill times. Plus have had a medication that I needed twice now when a grocery store pharmacy decided that they’re not going to order them until the day I need them. Thank God for this place.”\n\nMICHAEL\n\n\"\n\nAfter the issues I had with a big box store pharmacy, these people were fantastic and sorted out my prescription within minutes with positive, professional attitudes and actions! I will be using HomeTown Pharmacy again!”\n\nDAVID\n\n\""
