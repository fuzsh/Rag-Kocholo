        "text": "Clean Lyric\n\nParagraph Lyric\n\nI was standing on the sidewalk in 1945\n\nIn Jacksonville, Illinois\n\nWhen asked what my name was there came no reply\n\nThey said I was a deaf and sightless half wit boy\n\nBut Louis was my name, though I could not say it\n\nI was born and raised in New Orleans\n\nMy spirit was wild, so I let the river take it\n\nOn a barge and a prayer upstream\n\nWell, they searched for a mother\n\nAnd they searched for a father\n\nAnd they searched till they searched no more\n\nThe doctors put to rest their scientific tests\n\nAnd they named me 'John Doe No. 24'\n\nAnd they all shook their heads in pity\n\nFor a world so silent and dark\n\nWell, there's no doubt that life's a mystery\n\nBut so too is the human heart\n\nAnd it was my heart's own perfume\n\nWhen the crepe jasmine bloomed on Rue Morgue Avenue\n\nThough I couldn't hear the bells\n\nOf the streetcars coming by toeing the track I knew\n\nAnd if I were an old man returning\n\nWith my satchel and porkpie hat\n\nI'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon\n\nAnd I'd hit everyone on Basin after that\n\nThe years kept passing as they passed me around\n\nFrom one state ward to another\n\nLike I was an orphan shoe from the lost and found\n\nAlways missing the other\n\nAnd they gave me a harp last Christmas\n\nAnd all the nurses took a dance\n\nBut lately I've been growing listless\n\nI've been dreaming again of the past\n\nI'm wandering down to the banks\n\nOf the great Big Muddy where the shotgun houses stand\n\nI am seven years old and I feel my dad\n\nReach out for my hand\n\nWhile I drew breath no one missed me\n\nSo they won't on the day that I cease\n\nPut a sprig of crepe jasmine with me\n\nTo remind me of New Orleans\n\nI was standing on the sidewalk in 1945\n\nIn Jacksonville, Illinois\n\nI was standing on the sidewalk in 1945 In Jacksonville, Illinois When asked what my name was there came no reply They said I was a deaf and sightless half wit boy But Louis was my name, though I could not say it I was born and raised in New Orleans My spirit was wild, so I let the river take it On a barge and a prayer upstream Well, they searched for a mother And they searched for a father And they searched till they searched no more The doctors put to rest their scientific tests And they named me 'John Doe No. 24' And they all shook their heads in pity For a world so silent and dark Well, there's no doubt that life's a mystery But so too is the human heart And it was my heart's own perfume When the crepe jasmine bloomed on Rue Morgue Avenue Though I couldn't hear the bells Of the streetcars coming by toeing the track I knew And if I were an old man returning With my satchel and porkpie hat I'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon And I'd hit everyone on Basin after that The years kept passing as they passed me around From one state ward to another Like I was an orphan shoe from the lost and found Always missing the other And they gave me a harp last Christmas And all the nurses took a dance But lately I've been growing listless I've been dreaming again of the past I'm wandering down to the banks Of the great Big Muddy where the shotgun houses stand I am seven years old and I feel my dad Reach out for my hand While I drew breath no one missed me So they won't on the day that I cease Put a sprig of crepe jasmine with me To remind me of New Orleans I was standing on the sidewalk in 1945 In Jacksonville, Illinois"
