On Tuesday, March 7, I had the chance to watch JAWNY’s engaging performance at Bimbo’s 365 Club in San Francisco.\n\nFrom a concert-goers perspective, this show was a breath of fresh air. He played hits like “Strawberry Chainsaw” at the beginning of his set to really vamp up the crowd. His vocals were filled with life, and the smile he had plastered on his face the entire night showed just how much he enjoyed being a performer. The interactions with fans between and during songs was heartwarming.\n\nClick here to see his remaining tour dates. You’ll fall in love with the artist and his unique discography after seeing him live. Trust me, I’ve had his music on repeat since the show."
