        "text": "Driving in Illinois Heading link\n\nDriving in Illinois may be different from driving in your home country. If you are new to driving in the U.S., or Illinois, visit the Illinois Secretary of State’s Office ‘New to Illinois’ website to familiarize yourself with some of the documentation and driving laws in Illinois. In the U.S., driving rules and laws are referred to as the “Rules of the Road.” Per Illinois State Law, auto/car insurance is required for individuals operating a motor vehicle.\n\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a variety of resources on their website for ‘motorists’ (drivers), including a short driving safety video.\n\nAgain, many Chicago residents, and most students living within the city, choose to not own a car. Parking can be very limited and expensive, and the added costs of insurance, gas, and registration fees often outweigh the benefits. That said, if you intend to commute to UIC from outside the city or have the added responsibility of transporting a family on a daily basis, owning a car may make sense for you.\n\nGetting an Illinois driver's license Heading link\n\nDrivers moving to Illinois may use their valid driver’s license from their home state or country for 90 days. Illinois does not recognize the international driver’s license. You may obtain an Illinois driver’s license or identification card only if you are becoming a legal resident of Illinois.\n\nTo apply for an Illinois Driver’s License, begin by visiting and reviewing the requirements on the Illinois Secretary of State’s webpage for the necessary documents.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security offers a fact sheet for individuals in F-1, J-1 or M-1 status that may assist you when preparing your documents to apply for a Driver’s License.\n\nCan I apply for an Illinois Driver’s License without a SSN?\n\nA Social Security Number is not required to obtain a State of Illinois Drivers License. Internationals (F-1, F-2, J-1, J-2, among others) in Illinois may obtain a Temporary Visitor Drivers License (TVDL) from various locations in the state. To apply, you will need to visit the Social Security Administration to request a letter stating that you are not eligible for an SSN, this is known as a Form L-676. If, however, you are eligible for an SSN, then you must apply for and receive the SSN before applying for a state driver’s license.\n\nIf I do not want a driver’s license, can I apply for an Illinois State ID?\n\nIf you do not intend to drive while in the U.S., you may be eligible to apply for an Illinois State ID. However, an SSN is required to apply for an Illinois State ID.\n\nRequired documents for an Illinois driver's license or state ID\n\nTemporary visitor driver's license\n\nDid you know that UIC is an official Bike Friendly University? There are over 800 bike racks around campus, and UIC has access to many Divvy stations if you do not own a bicycle.Visit UIC Sustainability for everything you need to know about biking on-campus and do not forget to register your bike with the UIC Police.\n\nFor additional resources on bike safety, check out the NHTSA’s website for Bicycle Safety and also their short safety video.\n\n“On your left/right!”\n\nShare the road with bicyclists. Common bicycle etiquette in the U.S. is to also verbally announce when you are riding up behind pedestrians or slower bikers. You may hear bikers shout out “On your left/right!” To indicate which side of you they will be riding past so you can move out of the way.\n\nBiking on-campus\n\nRegister your bike"
