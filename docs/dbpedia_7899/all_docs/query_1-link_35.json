        "text": "Absentee voting is available and no excuse is required. The last day to request an absentee ballot by mail is 5 days before the election. Voted ballots must be postmarked by Election Day and received within two weeks in order to be counted. You can return your absentee ballot request form through the mail, a secure drop box, or in person. Absentee ballots begin being counted on Election Day. Contact your local elections office for more information.\n\nRequesting and Returning your Absentee Ballot:\n\nYou do not need an excuse to vote absentee in Illinois. You can request an absentee ballot:\n\nIn person - no more than 90 days but before 1 day before the election\n\nBy mail inside the US - no more than 90 days or less than 5 days before the election\n\nBy mail outside the US - no less than 30 days before the election (to receive the full ballot), or less than 30 days but no more than 10 days before the election to receive the Federal Ballot only\n\nUpon receipt, complete the application. Make certain to include your name, home address, address where you want the ballot to be mailed, and please remember to sign the application.\n\nAfter completing the application, either mail it or hand-deliver it to your election authority. If you return the application in person or complete the application in the election authority's office, you may immediately vote with your absentee ballot in the election authority's office. If you mail the application and it is properly completed, the election authority will mail your absentee ballot to you.\n\nAfter receiving your ballot, VOTE THE BALLOT IN SECRET. Insert the ballot into the envelope provided, seal it, complete and sign the certification on the back and PERSONALLY return it or mail it. The absentee voter may authorize, in writing, that a spouse, parent, child, brother, sister, or licensed motor carrier, should deliver the completed absentee ballot to the election authority in sufficient time to be delivered to the polling place on Election Day. Voted ballots must be postmarked by Election Day and received within two weeks in order to be counted.\n\nPermanent Vote-by-Mail List:\n\nIf you are a registered voter in Illinois, you may apply to be added to a permanent vote-by-mail list. A notice of this new option will be sent to all qualified voters before the next general election along with the application to opt-in. Voters will still have the option to vote-by-mail for a single election. The permanent vote-by-mail application will be available online closer to the next election here.\n\nThose who requested an absentee ballot but end up voting in person:\n\nTo do this, voters must bring their mailed ballot to the election site and turn it in to the election judge. If they do not have their mailed ballot with them, they will only be able to vote using a provisional ballot.\n\nOverseas citizens and U.S. military personnel can find information on how to register to vote and request an absentee ballot from the Overseas Vote Foundation.\n\nRequest your Ballot\n\nTo be eligible to vote, you must be:\n\nA US citizen\n\nAt least 18 years of age by Election Day\n\n17-year-olds may vote in a General Primary if they will be 18 by the following General Election\n\n16-year-olds may pre-register to vote so they may start voting as soon as they turn 18\n\nHave been a resident of the precinct at least 30 days prior to Election Day\n\nNot be serving a sentence of confinement in any penal institution as a result of any conviction\n\nNot be registered to vote elsewhere\n\nIncarcerated Voters & Returning Citizens:\n\nIn Illinois, you only lose your right to vote if you are currently incarcerated for a misdemeanor or felony conviction. If you lost your voting rights because of a conviction, you could register to vote immediately after release. Your voting rights are not restricted by pretrial detention, misdemeanors, probation, or parole.\n\nVoters without traditional residence:\n\nIn Illinois, voters must provide a residence address for voter registration purposes. When providing the residence address, post office boxes should not be used. Individuals without a permanent or fixed home address may draw a map in the designated box on their voter registration form to indicate the exact location of where they stay. They should list the name of the subdivision; cross streets; roads; landmarks; mileage and/or neighborsâ€™ names.\n\nIf the individual does not receive postal service at their residence address, they must provide a separate mailing address, including the number, street, city, state, and zip code. The mailing address on their registration form can be a P.O. box, local shelter, advocacy organization, outreach center, or the home of someone who will accept mail for them.\n\nTwo forms of identification are required when registering to vote, one of which must show your current residential address.\n\nIf you register by mail, sufficient proof of identity is fulfilled by submission of your driver's license number or state identification card number.\n\nIf you don't have either of those, verification by one of the following will be required:\n\nthe last 4 digits of your Social Security Number\n\na copy of a current and valid photo ID\n\na copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, government check, or other governmental document that shows your name and address\n\nYou may also demonstrate sufficient proof of identity by submission of a photo ID issued by a college or university along with either a copy of the applicant's contract or lease for a residence or a postmarked mail delivered to the applicant at his or her current address.\n\nIf you register by mail, you must vote in person the first time you vote unless you submit your driver license number or state ID number, the last four digits of your social security number or one of the forms of ID listed above.\n\nThe voting systems used in Illinois are optical scan and DRE.\n\nTo find out what voting machine is used in your county, please visit your state's resource.\n\nOptical Scan: With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.\n\nDirect Recording Electronic (DRE): This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.\n\nThere are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.\n\nSome of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.\n\nYou let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.\n\nYou can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC) resource or through Verified Voting."
