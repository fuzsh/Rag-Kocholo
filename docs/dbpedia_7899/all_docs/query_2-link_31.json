The gal on the phone was helpful and nice. It's a relief when you ask questions and get knowledgeable answers. The cheese pizza was party cut as described ... cheese only ... because I didn't know what our various vegetarian & non-vegetarian friends would like. It was really good basic pizza! They even had it ready early as soon as I arrived at the store for pickup.\n\nYep, I'll be going back to this corner shop and I'll try m more things on their menu.\n\nPizza was amazing. Crisp crust, but not burnt and lots of toppings. Also ordered the garlic parm wings 'crisp' one of the best wings I have had. Cheese sauce was cold, but didn't even need the sauce because the toppings were edge to edge."
