        "text": "I sent out a query to the universe (or the social mediaverse): What does your hometown mean to you?\n\nOne friend replied, “love, strength, compassion.” My schoolmate, John, who no longer lives in El Paso, said, “My hometown will always mean where connection to family and friends were birthed, nurtured and remain to this day.” A very busy colleague reflected that her hometown of Fabens is still her happy place, a place that reminds her of a time in her life when life was simple and stress-fee. Another spoke of his hometown as his birthplace of Brockton, Massachusetts, the world he traveled as a young soldier, his new hometown of El Paso as his landing place.\n\nMore: Indictment against El Paso mass shooting suspect was made public; here's what it says\n\nDescriptions like a soft landing place, the place where families began, a sweet hometown, a place of kindness and togetherness, permeated the responses.\n\nIt makes me wonder — what is it that roots us to our hometown? Is it our connections with people? The security of family? Or is it the memories of days of yore that make and form us into the people we are today?\n\nOne thing is certain: Coming home, wherever it may be, is a grounding for most people. For others, returning to their place of birth and growing up is a place of pain and bad memories. But I think what is common in the thread is that a hometown is where we come from, frames how we see the world, defines our relationships.\n\nOur hometowns are the places of our youth but are also a reminder of an era when things were simpler, when we felt protected, when our basic needs (or at least most of them) were met.\n\nMore: Topgolf El Paso plants 22 trees to honor victims of Walmart shooting\n\nWhat are those basic needs? Shelter, food, friendship, love, education — these are the five fundamental needs that each human being requires for healthy development. A place to live doesn’t have to be elaborate, but it does have to be safe and protect us from the elements. Food doesn’t have to be plentiful, but it needs to be nourishing to help us grow into healthy adults. Love, the foundation of relationship, provides us with the security and space to grow into loving human beings. Education allows us to see the world in all its glory, to develop our skills and talents into the tools that sustain us as we strike out on our own, the work and activity that helps us express ourselves through our contributions to the world. Friendship helps us form the ability to navigate through social settings, to grow to respect boundaries, to be loyal to one another.\n\nPerhaps it’s nostalgia — our hometown grounds us and reminds us of our dreams and hopes. Sometimes those dreams and hopes have been fulfilled, sometimes they have been dashed by the reality of life. But home is where we recover, gird our loins, and strike out to face the world once again. Even when our parents and elders have gone on to glory, instinct brings us home.\n\nKeep up with El Paso news. Get a digital subscription to the elpasotimes.com.\n\nFollowing the terrorist attack of Aug. 3, many El Pasoans have come home. I’ve talked to many of these pilgrims who “had to come home” to make sure that everything was OK.\n\nWhat is it that roots us to this place? What roots us to any place? Is it the sweet smell of creosote in the early summer morning particular to this place? Is it the image of Christ the King, with arms outstretched to welcome us? Does the Star on the Mountain call us home? Or the traditional visit to Chico’s Tacos or our personal Whataburger to fill a craving hole in our hearts and give us strength to go onward and upward?\n\nI don’t have the answer — just the question. So I pose it to you: What does hometown mean to you?"
