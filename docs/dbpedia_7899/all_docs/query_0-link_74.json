        "text": "CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (KFVS) - On Friday, August 9, the Southeast Missouri Regional Jazz Orchestra will put on the final show in their summer 2024 concert series.\n\nThe show begins at 7:30 p.m. at the Bedell Performance Hall on Southeast Missouri State University’s River Campus in Cape Girardeau.\n\nTickets start at $15 and can be purchased online or at the door.\n\nOrganizers say all proceeds go to support the SEMO Marching Band.\n\nThe Regional Jazz Orchestra is a group made up of music lovers from around the area. Teachers, students, and musicians come together each summer to perform.\n\nSome of the group’s current members are SEMO Marching Band students as well, a group that’s received its second invitation in as many years to participate in the Bands of America Super Regional.\n\nThe opportunity will take them north to The Dome at America’s Center in St. Louis, as well as to Rock Bridge High School in Columbia, Missouri for an exhibition performance.\n\nThey’ll also perform at the Farmington High School, much closer to home.\n\nAccording to the University, the current band is the largest in the institution’s history, meaning travel costs are larger as well.\n\n“There’s 185 members of the marching band this year,” said Bailey Jennings, trumpet player and SEMO senior. “It really means a lot, because a lot of these kids are getting to go to where they’re from and show their families what they’re doing while at school.”\n\nJennings will perform on Friday, along with fellow seniors Ben Beckwith on trumpet and Sam Schwarm on trombone.\n\nIt’s a show they’re looking forward to playing.\n\n“The community loves to engage with the music around here, that’s one of my favorite things about the place,” Beckwith said. “They love to see the different types of music that we bring, and the different influences, it’s really awesome.”\n\nThe concert follows many hours of rehearsals.\n\n“I think you’re gonna hear really great music by some really great professionals, and it’s also going to a really great cause.” Schwarm said. “So a lot of really great [things] in the night.”\n\nOpportunities with SEMO Marching Band are coming to a close for these three seniors, but their eyes are looking ahead to futures full of music.\n\nFor Schwarm, that means returning to his roots in St. Louis to teach high school band. Beckwith hopes to pursue a master’s degree in orchestral conducting. Meanwhile, Jennings’ goal is to start them young, teaching music to elementary school students.\n\nAll three will put their skills on display in the Regional Jazz Orchestra concert on August 9."
