        "text": "Water Quality in the State of Illinois\n\nIllinois is a state rich with culture and a diverse economic base. So much so, that it is considered a microcosm of the United States. Chicago, the third-largest state in the US, contributes to 65% of the state’s population. The water supply for Illinois comes from surface waters (rivers, lakes and reservoirs) and groundwater from aquifers.\n\nWater Hardness Summary\n\nIllinois is a hard water state. The average water hardness for the Illinois resident is around 200 PPM, which is extremely hard and can leave white deposits on your plumbing fixtures and cause damage to your water heaters. Chicago, the most populous Illinois city, has a water hardness level of 148 PPM. The highest reported water hardness numbers come from the city of Rockford, with 308 PPM (or 18 grains per gallon).\n\nFor more information on the water hardness in specific cities, please see the table below.\n\nCityWater Hardness Data\n\nAurora\n\n60502 |60503 | 60504 | 60505 | 60506\n\n127 PPM (mg/L) or 7 gpg\n\nCarol Stream\n\n60188\n\n418 PPM (mg/L) or 24 gpg\n\nChampaign\n\n61820 | 61821 | 61822\n\n258 PPM (mg/L) or 15 gpg\n\nChicago\n\n60601 |60602 | 60603 | 60604 | 60605 | 60606 | 60607 | 60608 | 60609 | 60610 | 60611 | 60612 | 60613 | 60614 | 60615 | 60616 | 60617 | 60618 | 60619 | 60620 | 60621 | 60622 | 60623 | 60624 | 60625 |60626 | 60628 | 60629 | 60630 | 60631 | 60632 | 60633 | 60634 | 60636 | 60637 | 60638 | 60639 | 60640 | 60641 | 60642 | 60643 | 60644 | 60645 | 60646 | 60647 | 60649 | 60651 | 60652 | 60653 |60654 | 60655 | 60656 | 60657 | 60659 | 60660 | 60661\n\n148 PPM (mg/L) or 8 gpg\n\nCicero\n\n60804\n\n187 PPM (mg/L) or 11 gpg\n\nColumbus\n\n62236\n\n120 PPM (mg/L) or 7 gpg\n\nCrystal Lake\n\n60012 | 60014\n\n137 PPM (mg/L) or 8 gpg\n\nDanville\n\n61832 | 61834\n\n191 PPM (mg/L) or 11 gpg\n\nDecatur\n\n62521 |62522 | 62523 | 62526\n\n194 PPM (mg/L) or 11 gpg\n\nDekalb\n\n60115\n\n188 PPM (mg/L) or 11 gpg\n\nDes Plaines\n\n60016 | 60018\n\n350 PPM (mg/L) or 18 gpg\n\nDowners Grove\n\n60515 | 60516\n\n288 PPM (mg/L) or 17 gpg\n\nEast Peoria\n\n61611\n\n250 PPM (mg/L) or 15 gpg\n\nEast Saint Louis\n\n62201 | 62203 | 62204 | 62205 | 62206 | 62207\n\n210 PPM (mg/L) or 12 gpg\n\nElgin\n\n60120 | 60123 | 60124\n\n171 PPM (mg/L) or 10 gpg\n\nElmhurst\n\n60126\n\n362 PPM (mg/L) or 21 gpg\n\nElmwood Park\n\n61529 | 60707\n\n218 PPM (mg/L) or 13 gpg\n\nEvanston\n\n60201 | 60202 | 60203\n\n333 PPM (mg/L) or 20 gpg\n\nGlenview\n\n60025 | 60026\n\n299 PPM (mg/L) or 18 gpg\n\nGranite City\n\n62040\n\n250 PPM (mg/L) or 15 gpg\n\nJoilet\n\n60431 | 60432 | 60433 | 60435 | 60436\n\n388 PPM (mg/L) or 23 gpg\n\nKankakee\n\n60901\n\n196 PPM (mg/L) or 11 gpg\n\nLombard\n\n60148\n\n344 PPM (mg/L) or 20 gpg\n\nMelrose Park\n\n60160 | 60164\n\n222 PPM (mg/L) or 12 gpg\n\nMoline\n\n61265\n\n210 PPM (mg/L) or 12 gpg\n\nMount Prospect\n\n60056\n\n247 PPM (mg/L) or 14 gpg\n\nNaperville\n\n60540 | 60563 | 60564 | 60565\n\n288 PPM (mg/L) or 17 gpg\n\nOak Lawn\n\n60453\n\n222 PPM (mg/L) or 13 gpg\n\nOak Park\n\n60301 | 60302 | 60304\n\n212 PPM (mg/L) or 12 gpg\n\nOrland Park\n\n60462 | 60467\n\n322 PPM (mg/L) or 19 gpg\n\nPalatine\n\n60067 | 60074\n\n245 PPM (mg/L) or 14 gpg\n\nPeoria\n\n61602 |61603 | 61604 | 61605 | 61606 | 61607 | 61614 | 61615 | 61625\n\n250 PPM (mg/L) or 15 gpg\n\nPlainfield\n\n60544 | 60585 | 60586\n\n280 PPM (mg/L) or 16 gpg\n\nRockford\n\n61101 |61102 | 61103 | 61104 | 61107 | 61108 | 61109 | 61112 | 61114\n\n308 PPM (mg/L) or 18 gpg\n\nRomeoville\n\n60446\n\n395 PPM (mg/L) or 24 gpg\n\nSpringfield\n\n62701 |62702 | 62703 | 62704 | 62707 | 62711 | 62712\n\n88 PPM (mg/L) or 5 gpg\n\nPPM = Parts Per Million\n\nmg/L = Milligrams Per Liter\n\ngpg = Grains Per Gallon\n\nAgriculture, Food Processing and Water Hardness\n\nAgriculture is a thriving industry in Illinois. 75% of the state’s total land is occupied by farmland because the state has an ideal climate and rich productive soil. As of 2018, the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) reported that Illinois has 72,000 farms. Top Illinois agriculture products are corn, soybeans, livestock, dairy and poultry.\n\nWith the average water hardness in Illinois being 200 PPM, which is considered very hard, based on USGS water hardness measures. Many farms and food process plants experience issues related to scale buildup on their irrigators and other necessary equipment due to the mass quantities of water flow every day. In addition, contaminants polluting soil and waterways have increased greatly over the past few decades. There is a greater need for waste control and a decrease in chemical control. Many farmers are looking for eco-friendly solutions that can provide quality crop protection at a cheaper cost. Read more about how HydroFLOW can increase crop yield.\n\nSolutions to your Water Quality Problems\n\nFixing your water quality issues in the state of Illinois will depend on your specific water source. It is best to test your potable water supply in order to get a better understanding of your water quality. Testing is relatively cheap. The test results will allow you to understand if your potable water has issues that need to be addressed. Common solutions to water contamination problems may include a water filtration system, a reverse osmosis system or other whole home water treatment solutions.\n\nA problem that almost all Illinois residents will have to deal with is hard water. One old-fashioned, inefficient, expensive and unhealthy method to treat hard water is with a salt-based water softener. Most people don’t realize that if you’re using a water softener you are basically removing calcium and magnesium from your drinking water and adding salt to your diet. In addition, many states are banning the use of salt-based water softeners.\n\nAlternative water treatment solutions such as “water conditioners” have been gaining popularity in recent years because they are cheap to operate and the best eco-friendly solution for hard water. Hydropath technology, which powers the HydroFLOW water conditioners is by far the most efficient and cost-effective eco-friendly solution to deal with hard water problems.
