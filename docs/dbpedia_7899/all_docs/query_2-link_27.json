        "text": "How old is Anna Hall?\n\nAnna Hall is 23 years old. She was born on March 23, 2001.\n\nHow tall is Anna Hall?\n\nAnna Hall is 5-foot-11.\n\nWhere is Anna Hall from?\n\nAnna Hall was born and raised in Greenwood Village, Colorado, a suburb just outside of Denver.\n\nWhat other sports has Anna Hall played?\n\nGrowing up, Anna Hall skied, swam, and played lacrosse and field hockey.\n\nHall began running track at age 7, initially competing in the high jump and 1500m events. However, following in her father’s footsteps, she eventually decided to compete in the multi-events.\n\nWhere did Anna Hall go to high school?\n\nAnna Hall attended Valor Christian High School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.\n\nWhere did Anna Hall go to college?\n\nAnna Hall began college running track at the University of Georgia. However, at the Olympics Trials in June 2021, she sustained a foot injury that sidelined her through October. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs experienced a coaching change that led Hall to transfer to the University of Florida.\n\nWho are Anna Hall’s parents?\n\nAnna Hall’s father, David, was a three-sport athlete at the University of Michigan. He played football and basketball and competed in the decathlon.\n\nHer mother is Ronette Hall.\n\nHow many siblings does Anna Hall have?\n\nAnna Hall grew up with four sisters. Her older sisters, Kara and Julia, played tennis and ran track, respectively, at Michigan.\n\nJulia later transferred as a graduate student and joined Anna on the track team at Georgia for one season. Her youngest sister’s name is Lauryn.\n\nHow did Anna Hall do in college?\n\nIn her junior season at Georgia, Anna Hall earned a second-place finish in the NCAA indoor pentathlon and third in the high jump.\n\nThe following year, 2022, Hall had an explosive senior season, nabbing the SEC Indoor title with a personal-best 4,618 points in the pentathlon, earning the pentathlon and heptathlon titles at the NCAA Division I Indoor and Outdoor Championships, respectively, and helped Florida win both its first indoor team title in 30 years and first-ever outdoor team title.\n\nThat year, she also broke the collegiate heptathlon world record with a score of 6,412 points, sneaking past Joyner-Kersnee’s record of 6,390 from 1983, and ran the third-fastest heptathlon in world history (2:03.11).\n\nHow many medals has Anna Hall won?\n\nOn the international stage, Anna Hall has won two medals: bronze at the 2022 World Championships and silver at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nHow many Olympics has Anna Hall been to?\n\nThough she participated in the Olympic Trials for the Tokyo Olympics, Hall crashed out in the 100m hurdles race, breaking her foot in the process, which forced her to withdraw from the competition after one event. She later had a screw put in her foot.\n\nShe officially qualified for her first Olympic team at the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials on June 24.\n\nHas Anna Hall broken Jackie Joyner-Kershee’s records?\n\nWhile Anna Hall joined Joyner-Kersee as the only U.S.-born woman to win two medals in the multi-event with her silver medal at 2023 Worlds, Joyner-Kersee’s personal best of 7,218 in the heptathlon still holds the top spot.\n\nHall’s personal best is 6,988 — just one spot behind Joyner-Kersee on the all-time U.S. list.\n\nWho is Anna Hall’s mentor?\n\nRecently, Anna Hall has developed a close relationship with Joyner-Kersee, who often calls Hall to offer advice and lend a listening ear.\n\nWhat advice did Jackie Joyner-Kersee give Anna Hall before the Olympic Trials?\n\nAhead of the Olympic Trials in late June, Joyner-Kersee called Anna Hall three times and told her to believe in herself.\n\nWhat injuries did Anna Hall overcome before the Olympic Trials?\n\nFollowing the foot injury she sustained at the Olympic Trials for the Tokyo Olympics and subsequent surgeries, Anna Hall suffered a complex knee injury that required more surgery in January 2024 — just six months before the Olympic Trials began.\n\nHas Anna Hall qualified for the Paris Olympics?\n\nAt the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials in late June, Anna Hall finished first in the heptathlon, completing her redemption arc and qualifying for her first Olympic team.\n\nOn her relationship with her sisters:\n\nI lean on my sisters so much. I call them almost every day after practice, tell them if I had a rough day, if I had a good day. And they're just always there to uplift me with, whether it's track stuff, off-track stuff, and [they’re] always just supporting me.\n\nOn when she decided to become an Olympian:\n\nI was a really confident eight year old. I don't know where it came from, but I remember … the coach [at my track club] said, ‘Everybody write down their goals. Where do you want to be in ten years? Whether it has to do with track or non-track, what do you want to be when you grow up?’ And I remember thinking, and I was like, ‘Yeah, I'm going to go to the Olympics. That's what I'm going to do.’ And in my mind, there was no plan B.\n\nOn her father's support:\n\nHe was the one who really got through to me that you have to work really hard for things to go your way, and that in order to do that, it's not just about doing everything you're supposed to do, but you have to love the process. And so I think him speaking to me in that way really made a difference, because once I learned to love practice and love chasing progress, the entire sport changed for me.\n\nOn Joyner-Kersee's mentorship:\n\n\"It's meant the world. She’s been here for everything. She called me last week and she was like, ‘I’m going to call you every two days until trials [to] make sure your head’s right. You can do this. I’m behind you. You just have to believe.'\""
