        "text": "In an industry where hip-hop acts have become dispensable, Marcus Moody, aka PAYPA, is determined to secure his place among the greats. PAYPA grew up as a military-brat, and claimed home in the southside of Chicago where he was raised. Later, PAYPA and his parents would eventually make the move to Southern California. Overcoming the distance from home, PAYPA made sure he stuck with his Chicago roots. A weekend trip turned into spending summers and holidays in The Windy City, fueling him to represent his hometown with purpose. As far as music goes, PAYPA will tell you that he “just kind of fell into the music game.” When his younger brother passed away from kidney failure, Paypa was compelled to continue his brother’s legacy through music and performance. “My brother was the performer, and I was always the quiet and laidback one,” he recalls. Over the past ten years, Paypa vowed to make his mark in the music industry so that his brother could live on through his music. Now 26, Paypa is ready to share his story with the world.\n\nTracy Autman is a Hip Hop recording artist & producer who goes by the stage name, K!DD Tha Chicagoan. At the age of 8, he wrote his first song and had a passion for music ever since then. Growing up listening to artists such as Do or Die, Jay Z, Nirvana and Kanye West, K!DD draws upon many influences to craft his signature sound. Over the past two years, he has been signed by Coast2Coast, gained a faithful fan base, founded his label “2ill Entertainment” and signed to Chicago’s On The Grind Management. Look out for upcoming work from K!DD Tha Chicagoan and keep checking www.kiddthachicagoan.com for the latest news, shows, music & more.\n\nChicago Hip-Hop Props Award-Winner Anthony Di’Angelo Ingram, Jr. or “D2G” as he’s called in the Hip-Hop scene, is a laborer in music all around. Growing up on the southeast side of Chicago, 2G would always relate any life situation to a song that would describe his emotion at the time. Inspired by artists like Rakim, KRS-One, and Slick Rick, he began writing at age 11 and would later transform his writings into songs. Graduating from Hyde Park Academy in 2005, he would find himself enrolled into Columbia College Chicago, where he became fascinated by the artistic environment. This atmosphere would later introduce 2G to various artists and producers.\n\nA focused emcee in his own right, D2G seeks to bring glory back to his hometown of Chicago and earn his rightful place among hip-hop’s elite. Since releasing his first solo project in 2011, The Blood Diamond Tape, and his first album in 2013, July 9th: A Cancer Story, D2G has been performing and promoting his music across the city. After releasing his critically acclaimed sophomore effort, Short Summers Long Winters, in 2015, D2G went on to win the Chicago Props Award for Best Male Emcee. His latest effort, The Next Hot Day, brings the emcee back to his storytelling roots as he produces the sequel to his first “audiofilm”. There seems to be end in sight for this emcee’s emcee."
