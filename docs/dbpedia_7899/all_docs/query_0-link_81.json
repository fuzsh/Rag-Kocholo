        "text": "Champaign-Urbana and Chicago, IL, October 28, 2021 – On October 6, 2021, the United States Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE-NETL) selected the University of Illinois for $4 million in federal funding, in addition to cost share contributions by Holcim and Air Liquide, for research and development to support the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study. This commercial-scale carbon-capture study, based in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, is a partnership of the University of Illinois’ Prairie Research Institute, Holcim US and Air Liquide Engineering & Construction.\n\nThe University of Illinois is a leader in developing and managing carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) projects. The objective of this project is to deliver a FEED study for a carbon capture retrofit that can separate up to 95% of CO2 emissions at the plant. The captured CO2 will be pipeline ready for geological storage. Analysis of the project socio-economic impact will also be part of the study.\n\n“While we have partnered with energy-generation facilities on many of our carbon management projects, carbon from industrial sources is also a key piece of the puzzle,” said the Prairie Research Institute’s Kevin OBrien, the project’s principal investigator. “It’s exciting to collaborate with Holcim US to explore the application of this carbon capture technology at a commercial scale, in a way that has the potential for significant impact.”\n\n“We recognize that in our industry, the ability to decarbonize is the real game changer. This project selected by U.S. DOE is another significant step in advancing large-scale CCUS technology in our industry, something we are very excited about atHolcim,” said Derick Dreyer, Head of Cement Industrial Performance, North America. “This partnership, the second of this nature in the U.S., is a powerful example of how collaboration across industry, the public sector and academia can advance carbon capture, utilization and storage projects that are the critical steps to accelerating the transition to a net-zero future.”\n\nThe design will employ Air Liquide’s CrycocapTM FG system at the Holcim Ste. Genevieve cement plant, part of Holcim US, which features the largest single kiln in the world. The Cryocap FG system combines the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) capabilities with cryogenic refrigeration technologies to achieve high CO2 capture rates with high CO2 purity rates.\n\n“Air Liquide Engineering & Construction brings to the project, its unique, industry leading experience in CO2 capture and liquefaction technologies as well as operational experience to support the decarbonization of this sector,” stated David Maloney, Group Vice President and Chairman of Air Liquide Engineering & Construction. “We are committed to supporting our customers and making a difference by developing solutions to help them reduce CO2 emissions.”\n\nIn addition to completion of the FEED Study, the scope of work includes a business case outlining the potential business model for commercial scalability, as well as analyses on environmental justice, economic revitalization and jobs creation.\n\nAbout Holcim\n\nHolcim is the leading global building materials and solutions company. It has four businesses: cement, aggregates and ready-mix concrete as well as advanced solutions and products that include precast concrete, asphalt and mortar. With its broad portfolio Holcim solves the toughest challenges facing masons, builders, architects and engineers, bringing industry-leading innovations and services to customers challenged by urbanization, population growth and the demand for sustainability. Headquartered in Switzerland and with leading positions in all regions, Holcim employs approximately 80,000 employees in around 80 countries and has a portfolio that is equally balanced between developing and mature markets.\n\nIn the United States, Holcim companies include close to 350 sites in 43 states and employ 7,000 people. Our customers rely on us to help them design and build better communities with innovative solutions that deliver structural integrity and eco-efficiency.\n\nAbout Prairie Research Institute\n\nThe University of Illinois' Prairie Research Institute applies scientific expertise in geology, ecology and biodiversity, archaeology, water, weather and climate, pollution prevention, hazardous waste management, and sustainable energy to benefit the people, economy, and environment of Illinois. www.prairie.illinois.edu/.\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nPrairie Research Institute\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nTrish Baker\n\ntlbarker@illinois.edu\n\n+1 217.300.2327"
