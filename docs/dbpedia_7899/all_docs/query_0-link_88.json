Once underground, their plan calls for hungry microbes to consume the carbon-rich liquid and sequester it, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere where it could contribute to climate change.\n\nThe SIU team, “Carbon Down Under,” and the 22 other winning teams – all of them led by students – were announced today at the COP26 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Scotland. XPRIZE Carbon Removal is aimed at finding working technologies to fight climate change and rebalance Earth’s climate cycle.
