        "text": "BECAUSE so much of my work finds me online for hours a day, deciding to switch from a pokey dial-up modem to always-on broadband was a no-brainer. D.S.L. was available in my Manhattan neighborhood, so I ignored the many D.S.L. service nightmares that friends had warned me about and signed up.\n\nWhat nobody warned me about -- not my friends and, more disturbingly, not my Internet service provider -- was the scary stuff that happened after I was connected. At the end of my first day in the fast lane, I was shutting down my PC when a Windows prompt warned me that by doing so I would disconnect a user called Dr. Stealth from my computer. Was I sure I wanted to shut down?\n\nI gasped. I blinked. I hit the power switch.\n\nDr. Stealth? My computer was telling me that it had been hacked. Or if not actually hacked -- in the malicious sense usually associated with the term -- it had at the very least been electronically invaded by a total stranger whose motive I could only guess at during the hours I lay awake that night. Without realizing it, I had left my computer open to uninvited visitors.\n\nWhat I needed, several fellow fast-trackers told me, was a firewall. For any business that is connected to the Net, a firewall is a given. For most home users tapping into the Net with a fast cable modem or D.S.L. connection, however, firewalls are a foreign language.\n\nTo some extent, every computer hooked to the Internet on any kind of connection needs a firewall.\n\nEvery computer that connects to the Net has or is assigned a unique identifier called an Internet Protocol, or I.P., address, which acts as a kind of home address for sending and receiving information, and hackers use communications programs that scan the Net for I.P. addresses. The hackers are looking for computers with open ports -- entry points used by programs to communicate with the Internet -- that are vulnerable to attack.\n\nBroadband users are more vulnerable to attacks because their ''always on'' connections mean that their computers are out there as potential targets for many more hours a day.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
