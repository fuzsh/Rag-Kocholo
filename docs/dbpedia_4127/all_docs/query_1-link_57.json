        "text": "Who we are\n\nThere are a number of ways of looking at the World Trade Organization. It is an organization for trade opening. It is a forum for governments to negotiate trade agreements. It is a place for them to settle trade disputes. It operates a system of trade rules. Essentially, the WTO is a place where member governments try to sort out the trade problems they face with each other.\n\nWhat we do\n\nThe WTO is run by its member governments. All major decisions are made by the membership as a whole, either by ministers (who usually meet at least once every two years) or by their ambassadors or delegates (who meet regularly in Geneva).\n\nWhat we stand for\n\nThe WTO agreements are lengthy and complex because they are legal texts covering a wide range of activities. But a number of simple, fundamental principles run throughout all of these documents. These principles are the foundation of the multilateral trading system.\n\nOverview\n\nThe World Trade Organization  the WTO  is the international organization whose primary purpose is to open trade for the benefit of all.\n\nThe WTO in Brief\n\nA starting point for essential information about the WTO.\n\nAbout the WTO  Understanding the WTO’\n\nAn introduction, in more depth, to the WTO and its agreements.\n\n10 things the WTO can do\n\nThe world is complex. The World Trade Organization is complex. This booklet is brief, but it tries to reflect the complex and dynamic nature of trade and the WTOs trade rules.\n\nHistory of the multilateral trading system\n\nFrom the early days of the Silk Road to the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the birth of the WTO, trade has played an important role in supporting economic development and promoting peaceful relations among nations. This page traces the history of trade, from its earliest roots to the present day."
