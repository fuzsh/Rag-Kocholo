        "text": "The Good\n\nOther than a somewhat eerie atmosphere there's nothing much to like.\n\nThe Bad\n\nFirst of all, this game is unbelievably stupid. You die just about everywhere. Walk into a certain room, you die. Open a certain box, you die. Worst of all, if you're not fast enough you'll be overcome by some evil force and you'll die, and if that happens you have to start over again and solve the same tedious puzzles again. If you still want to play this game, whatever you do, avoid the NES-version. The sound on that version is the worst ear-terror I've ever heard. It's not music, it's strange high pitch noises coming out of the speakers in an arbitrary pattern. Awful, to say the least. The gameplay is identical to that of Shadowgate, and it has the same eerie atmosphere as that game. It actually makes me sick, both because of the strange atmosphear, and because of the extremely low quality of the game. If the story is good? Get outta here. Oh yeah, the graphics are quite crappy too.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nUgly game spiced up with some lovely ear-terror and some nice frustration to go.\n\nThe Good\n\nIt's a bit less difficult than the Déja Vu games or Shadowgate and short enough to have a quick, fun playthrough of. It's pretty violent and morbid, which I suppose is a strength, the ending is a bit like The Exorcist and there's other horror clichés. Of course point and click games were still quite new in 1986(the Japanese were also making them).\n\nThe Bad\n\nEven with its shortness, I think the problem solving is too difficult, the solutions don't always make much sense. The point and click can get fiddly too, actually causing you to die or ruining your game, because of the way the computer registers your click e.g you can accidentally burn your box of matches, which you need to win.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI'd recommend this over the other MacVentures to anyone who wanted to see the start of point and click adventures. It's good for a few playthroughs.\n\nThe Good\n\nI loved the creepy feel and the puzzling gameplay. You DO get the feeling you're being watched!! While it could get on your nerves a bit, the constant playing of the eerie music eventually adds to the experience. After all this isn't supposed to be a NICE experience, in a haunted house with EVIL lurking about! You're supposed to be a bit freaked out, yes? I loved the very well hidden rooms and puzzles. Some of the puzzles are not solvable until you find something 2, 3 or more panels or rooms ahead, and then you have to figure out how to use what you've been given. Sometimes a mistake can instantaneously cost you your life and the game, so be VERY careful! Are you sure you want to do THAT? lol! For a textual type RPG it is very creepy! Lots of areas to explore, with many more to find!\n\nThe Bad\n\nIt is a text game, but even so, some of the graphics are nasty. And the music, while appropriate for the game does tend to grate due to the repetition. You should be able to drop more stuff, after you have used it as intended, and it gets tedious scrolling through all the stuff to get what you're looking for. The game won't let you drop some things, even if you will never need them again. I suppose it adds to the mystery, not knowing if you'll need it again or not, but overall it bogs down the scrolling!\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith gaming on the eve of another quantum shift with the next gen consoles here or about to come, this game does pale in comparison. But, if you take it for what it was and where it came from, it is a great title! Lots of gameplay, lots of hidden levels/rooms to explore and mild to tricky puzzles to figure out! A great little gem from the \"past\"! If you find a copy, grab it. It still has some fun for the buck and is and will be a valuable rarity for any collection!"
