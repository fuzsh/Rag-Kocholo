        "text": "You electronically sign your DS-160 by clicking the “Sign Application” button at the end of the form. Failure to sign may result in termination of the application. Your electronic signature certifies that you have read and understood the questions in the application and that your answers are true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief. The submission of an application containing any false or misleading statements may result in the permanent refusal of a visa or denial of entry into the United States. All declarations made in the application are unsworn declarations made under penalty of perjury.\n\nUnless you are exempted from appearing in person, your fingerprints will be electronically scanned on the day of your interview. By providing your fingerprints, you will again certify that that you have answered all questions on the DS-160 truthfully and to the best of your knowledge, and that you will tell the truth during your visa interview. You will be directed to read the following statement prior to having your fingerprints scanned:\n\n“By submitting my fingerprint, I am certifying under penalty of perjury that I have read and understood the questions in my visa application and that all statements that appear in my visa application have been made by me and are true and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n\nFurthermore, I certify under penalty of perjury that I will tell the truth during my interview and that all statements made by me during my interview will be complete to the best of my ability.”\n\nExplanations of the following terms contained in the online DS-160 form are available to you as help topics while you complete the DS-160 and are also provided below.\n\nHelp: Surnames\n\nEnter all surnames (or family names) exactly as they are written in your passport. If only one name is written in your passport, enter that as your “Surname.”\n\nHelp: Given Names\n\nIf your passport does not include a first or given name, please enter 'FNU' (meaning “first name unknown”) in the space for “Given Names.”\n\nHelp: Other Names\n\nOther names used include your maiden name, religious name, professional name, or any other name by which you are or have been known.\n\nMake sure to enter the other names you have used in full. Thus, if you have only used another surname, enter it along with your usual given name. If you have only used another given name, enter it along with your usual surname.\n\nHelp: Telecode\n\nTelecodes are four-digit code numbers that represent characters in some non-Roman alphabet names.\n\nHelp: Date of Birth\n\nEnter as shown in your passport.\n\nHelp: Place of Birth\n\nPlease choose the name currently used for the place where you were born.\n\nHelp: Phone\n\nYou must provide a primary phone number. The primary phone number should be the phone number at which you are most likely to be reached; this could be a land line or a cellular/mobile number. If you have an additional land line or a cellular/mobile number please list that as your secondary phone number.\n\nHelp: Identification Numbers\n\nYour National ID Number is a unique number that your government may have provided. For example, the U.S. Government gives unique numbers to people looking to work or who pay taxes.\n\nHelp: Other Nationality\n\nEnter all nationalities you currently hold and all nationalities you have previously held (including United States, if applicable), regardless of whether you have formally and/or legally relinquished the nationality. If the country where you previously held nationality no longer exists, choose the name of the country that is currently used for that location. (For example, if you used to be a citizen of the former East Germany, choose “Germany.”)\n\nHelp: Permanent Resident\n\nPermanent resident means any individual who has been legally granted by a country/region permission to live and work without time limitation in that country/region.\n\nHelp: Passport/Travel Document Number\n\nEnter the number of the passport or travel document you will use to travel to the United States. This passport/document must still be valid, and must identify you and your nationality.\n\nHelp: Passport Book Number\n\nThe Passport Book Number is commonly called the inventory control number. You may or may not have a Passport Book Number on your passport. If you do, the location of the Passport Book Number on your passport may vary depending on the country that issued your passport. Please contact your passport issuing authority if you are unable to determine whether or not your passport contains a Passport Book Number.\n\nHelp: Expiration Date\n\nIn most cases your passport or travel document must be valid for at least six months after your arrival in the United States.\n\nHelp: Application Receipt/Petition Number\n\nIf you are applying for a petition-based visa, your application receipt/petition number was given to you by the Department of Homeland Security’s U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) after you filed your petition application at a USCIS Service Center. The application receipt/petition number is 13 characters long and the first three characters are letters.\n\nHelp: Previous Employer\n\nPlease enter information regarding your previous two employers only. Applicants may choose to bring along a separate written list of all previous employers to the visa interview for reference."
