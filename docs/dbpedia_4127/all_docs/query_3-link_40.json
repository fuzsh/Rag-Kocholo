        "text": "The American horror film The Uninvited (1944) is considered a classic of the genre. The movie is noted for its serious and understated take on the traditional ghost story.\n\nWhile on vacation, siblings Roderick (played by Ray Milland) and Pamela Fitzgerald (played by Ruth Hussey) impulsively buy a house overlooking the sea on the English coast. Soon, however, they begin to encounter numerous oddities, including strange noises and smells and unexplained chills. Stella Meredith (played by Gail Russell), a young woman who lived there as child, becomes convinced that the house is inhabited by the spirit of her mother, Mary Meredith, who died after falling off a nearby cliff when Stella was three. However, one night Stella is nearly killed at the house. Soon afterward, a second presence is revealed, that of Carmel, the mistress of Stella’s father. It is eventually discovered that Carmel is actually Stella’s mother and that her ghost has been protecting Stella from Mary. After Roderick confronts Mary’s ghost, it leaves, and the spirit of Carmel, no longer needed to safeguard Stella, also disappears.\n\nDirector Lewis Allen won praise for The Uninvited, which is effective because of its leisurely pace, allowing the tension to build gradually along with the level of supernatural activity experienced in the haunted house. The camerawork of noted cinematographer Charles Lang in The Uninvited added to the suspense. The film’s score produced the popular song “Stella by Starlight.”"
