Any image tagged only with {{fairuse}}, with no fair use rationale, may be deleted seven days after it was uploaded.\n\nCSD I7: Invalid fair-use claim 1. Any image with a clearly invalid fair-use tag (such as a {{logo}} tag on a photograph of a mascot) can be deleted at any time.\n\nCSD I8: Invalid fair-use claim 2. Any image that is from a company that makes money off of providing those images (such as Google Maps) may be deleted at any time.\n\n--Carnildo\n\nThe first two seem fine (although you're going to hear massive screaming if you don't grandfather in existing {{fairuse}}-tagged images), but I don't think the third one is correct. My impression was that using, say, an example image from Google Maps on an appropriate article (i.e. Google Maps) could qualify as fair-use, regardless of what purpose the company produces said images for. —Kirill Lokshin\n\nI agree with Kirill here.Voice-of-AllT|@|ESP\n\nProblem is, people are using arial photos from Google Maps to illustrate articles on geographic locations, and are using images from the Associated Press and other news services to illustrate current events. --Carnildo\n\nThis would have to be opened up for wide community examination before it could even think about being made into a CSD. If someone is using an AP photo inappropiately but claiming fair use, remove the photo from the article in question with a note that it \"may not be\" fair use. The burden in on them to show that it is before they replace it, and we've already got a blocking policy to enforce that. I don't see that we need another CSD for this. - brenneman{T}{L}\n\nI6 and I7 are quite all right, as long as you make it to be images after some target date. I8 is not so good. Use {{fairusedisputed}} instead. Stifle (talk)\n\nEvery discussion we've had about what you're calling I6 and I7 seems to end up with \"Yes, that's a good idea, just go slowly about it.\" Let's just implement them. Jkelly\n\nI've created {{db-norat}} for CSD:I6 (no rationale), and {{db-badfairuse}} for CSD:I7 (bad rationale). A system similar to the current {{subst:orfud}} and {{subst:nsd}} will be needed to make CSD:I6 work. Additionally, {{subst:badfairuse}} can be used to notify people on their talk page if an image is tagged or deleted under I7. Stifle (talk)\n\nI'm not really sure these should go into CAT:CSD. I think it should be a {{no license}} and {{no source}} type thing, where it gets deleted seven days after it's tagged as not having a fair use rationale, not 7 days after being tagged with a fair use tag without a rationale. This gives the uploader an opportunity to add a fair use rationale after it's tagged, like giving them a chance to add a source or whatever (except adding a fair use rationale can't really be abused by adding fake licenses or whatever ;)). --Rory096\n\nI just want to make sure we're on the same page here. If there is no rationale, the image is held for 7 days to add a rationale, then deleted if one isn't added. If there is an obviously invalid rationale, then it goes straight away. This parallels the lack of any license at all — if an image has no license, it's held for 7 days, but if it has a bad license (e.g. {{cc-by-nc}}), it's deleted immediately.\n\nIs that OK with you or would you prefer bad rationale and no rationale to both be held for 7 days? Stifle (talk)\n\nI meant I6 (no rationale) being put straight into CAT:CSD if the image was uploaded more than 7 days ago. I'm saying that it should be something like being tagged for 7 days, so the uploader can be notified that it needs a rationale. --Rory096\n\nI agree that where there is no fair use rationale provided, we must allow the uploader time to provide one - seven days after being tagged fits with other lag times. I don't think that we need a speedy deletion criteria for \"bad\" fair use claims, we should use {{fairusedisputed}} instead - if there is a backlog here then maybe that system should be strengthened, possibly along the lines of {{PROD}} - but that is not a discussion for here. Thryduulf\n\nAt the moment, the fair use dept. is rather backlogged (if you don't believe me, check out Category:Fair use magazine covers and see how many of them are actually being used to illustrate articles on magazines, not a lot...) This CSD refers, in any case, to the most obvious things like a photograph from Getty Images being tagged as {{symbol}}. Stifle (talk)\n\nRory: Yes, that's how it's been implemented, although the categories and tags haven't actually been done yet. Stifle (talk)\n\nWe absolutely need something like I7. It does not make sense to me to give 7 days (or whatever period of time) for someone to correct the license on an image after they have already lied about it once (whereas giving time for them to provide a license when they didn't bother to pick one seems reasonable). If you lie about the license an image is under, that image should be deleted immediately. Nandesuka\n\nIt seems to me that assuming good faith implies assuming that an incorrect license was a mistake rather than a lie. There's nothing wrong with giving an uploader seven days to correct a mistake. Angr (t • c)\n\nSure, there's something wrong with it. It puts the project at risk. Jimbo has already indicated multiple times that the Foundation lawyers are extremely concerned about the number and seriousness of copyright infringements in the image space. Putting the wrong license on an image is a substantively different act than uploading without one: it's an affirmative statement of either dishonesty or carelessness. Either way, such actions should never be allowed to jeopardize the encyclopedia. In this area, we really can't afford to assume any better faith than will be assumed by the various jurisdictions in which the project can be sued. Nandesuka\n\nThen why don't they stop being wishy-washy and prohibit fair use images altogether? German Wikipedia gets along just fine using only public-domain and free-license images. Angr (t • c)\n\nOK, I've redirected {{db-norat}} to {{No rationale}} (which was actually conveniently created in April by Carnildo), and also made various redirects, like {{norat}} and {{norationale}}. The {{subst:nsd}} type thing is {{subst:nrd}} (nr = no rationale). --Rory096\n\nHmm, we need a warning template like {{image copyright}}... --Rory096\n\nThat'll be {{Missing rationale}}. Stifle (talk)\n\nSee Category:Images with no fair use rationale. --Rory096\n\nI changed {{db-norat}} to match {{db-unksource}}. --Rory096\n\nI changed \"before 4 May\" to \"after 4 May\", which is what the policy has said. Stifle (talk)\n\nJust thought you guys might want to know that you can use {{subst:frn}} for images without fair use rationales uploaded after May 4, and {{subst:Image fairuse rationale|Image:image name}} for their uploaders' talk pages. Johnleemk | Talk\n\nLooks like we've had some duplicate work. Rory096 got a little ahead of you, see the top of the page. Since he created them first and they are slightly more in line with existing tags, I'm going to boldly redirect some and propose the extra categories for deletion. I hope you don't mind. Stifle (talk)\n\nSure, no problem. The templates actually stemmed from a discussion at the talk page of the fair use wikiproject, which led me to believe we didn't have any such templates yet. Johnleemk | Talk\n\nHere's the proposal: any article should be speedy deletable that is written as fiction rather than about fiction, such that it lacks real-world context and fails to reference what specific work of fiction the character or subject was portrayed in. This reference must be more specific than a general reference to a fictional world (such as Star Wars). A contributor should be able to at least note what novel, video game, film, or comic book a character came from; otherwise, they're obviously just copying a fan site or fan reference guide (which should not themselves count as sufficient works of fiction).\n\nThe articles that this targets pose two problems: 1) articles that fail to do more than summarize fiction are worthless to this project; 2) articles that merely repeat \"information\" presented in fan reference material (such as Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe) are likely copyright infringements. See, for example, The World of Kong, an encyclopedia of creatures set in the fictional world of the movie, but which exist only within its own pages; in addition to an article about the book itself (which is appropriate), someone has created individual articles for most of the beasts, which collectively constitute a copy of the book that directly competes with it. This is not a fair use.\n\nThis has been a recurring issue, and was again just raised on the village pump. Postdlf\n\nSupport! -- Malber (talk · contribs)\n\nI think this is an excellent criterion for regular deletion, but not for speedy deletion. It's too vague, and too easily fixable within five days. Angr (t • c)\n\nStrong support in principle, and as a CSD. The details need wordsmithing to clarify exactly what counts. I would support a fairly expansive version myself, in which an article has to show real-world notability for the specific subject of the article, not just the work of fiction or game it's part of. So a minor character or location in a work of popular fiction wouldn't qualify just because the the work was popular, and of course any character from or summary of fanfic would be right out (not to mention the fact that authors tend to view fanfic as infringing or threatening their IP rights). Please don't call it fancruft, though; I love that expression, but it's too polarizing for official use. · rodii ·\n\nComment: I am open to a speedy along the lines proposed, but I would want an assurance, such speedies could be easily undone, if somebody comes forward willing to fix the problem (e.g. add in missing info and/or merge into an appropriate article in context). There's nothing at all wrong, with giving a summary of fictional material. The problem is only when the entire article is the summary, and there's a lack of context for it. --Rob\n\nI'm fine with that. Postdlf\n\nSupport in that case. --Rob\n\nCSD is for material that's irredeemably garbage, not for enforcing vague (and quite obscure) stylistic guidelines. What benefits, exactly, would there be to deleting this stuff immediately, rather than in five days (or, even better, just adding the missing elements)? And would these hypothetical benefits outweigh the price—measured in numbers of contributors leaving after everything they've worked on is suddenly deleted—that we would pay for implementing such a policy? Kirill Lokshin\n\nShhh. Don't use rationality and good points - you'll only confuse them. Phil Sandifer\n\nThis proposal is a non-starter. Speedies are only for obviously unencyclopedic material. Lack of notability cannot ever be a criteria for speedy deletion (A7 only allows it when there is no assertion whatsoever of notability - which is different) --Doc ask?\n\nIndeed. But I do think it would be a good idea to expand WP:FICT to say that any article on a fictitious person, place, or thing must discuss the topic's relevance to the real world. Any character/place/object for which no significance in the real world is claimed should be at most mentioned in a larger article, but may not have an article of its own. Failure to meet the criteria of WP:FICT is, of course, a valid reason for either of the five-day deletion processes (WP:PROD or WP:AFD). Angr (t • c)\n\nAn article about a fictional subject that lacks any real-world references, and instead only describes fiction as if it were real, is lacking in meaningful context, so in that sense this is an elaboration of A1. An article about a fictional subject that does not assert the specific work(s) of fiction whence it derives utterly fails to assert its notability—the fictional counterpart to A7. That's what I had in mind, not the more \"expansive\" version Rodii urged in which notability is judged. And I believe an article on a fictional subject that does not exist outside of an encyclopedia of fictional subjects is perhaps unavoidably a copyright violation, and should be treated as inherently non-notable, so such sources should not count to satisfy the \"work of fiction\" requirement. In my proposal, the simple statement \"X is a fictional character appearing in the (novel/film/video game/manga/cartoon/flip book) Y\" would suffice to make an article survive this CSD criteria. I think that's far more objective than A7, and not obscure or vague in the slightest. Postdlf\n\nI agree that \"X is a fictional character apprearing in the (novel/film/etc.) Y\" without any reference to the real world should not be speediable, but I do think it should deletable after five days for not meeting the criteria of WP:FICT. I also think an article that says only \"Xantor is the King of Perfidion. He ascended to the throne after murdering his brother Myopsius\" is already speediable for lack of context, so there's no need for a new speedy criterion. Angr (t • c)\n\nSupport. This is an important and positive step to help keep the project on-topic. Hopefully all affected information will be made available on other wikis though... --Improv\n\n\"On topic\"? What? You seem to be saying \"on topic\" is \"anything I'm not personally interested in.\" If you can't accept the fact that articles about fictional characters, some of which you may not have heard of (gasp!), belong on in an encyclopedia, you shouldn't be editing. Full stop.--Sean Black\n\nStrongest possible oppose. No, no no no no. No. No! Terrible idea, horribly divisive, doesn't fit into anything normal, and can easily be dealt with via {{prod}}. Kill this before it spreads. --badlydrawnjeff (WP:MEMES?)\n\nHow is it divisive to insist that an article about a fictional subject at least mention what work(s) of fiction depicted it? Postdlf\n\n{{sofixit}}. An article that doesn't contain references to its source material needs to be expanded and articulated, not cut off at the knees. Oppose this as unnecessary scope creep. -- nae'blis (talk)\n\nYou've equivocated \"source\" as the references for an article with \"source\" as I have used it, the work(s) of fiction that are the only context in which the fictional subject exists. Postdlf\n\nOppose, notability requirements are evil. (I've linked to that a disturbing number of times today.) —Simetrical (talk • contribs)\n\nNo one who has voiced opposition to this proposal has addressed the issue I raised of articles about fictional subjects that are only depicted in fictional encyclopedias. My suggestions are that 1) \"articles\" about such subjects are unavoidably copyright infringements, 2) the lack of any depiction outside of such a fictional reference work should make a subject inherently non-notable. No thoughts? Postdlf\n\nThoughts, then:\n\nThis doesn't seem at all obvious to me; if you can get someone with actual legal expertise in copyright matters to comment on this, fine, but let's not base deletion policy on wild guesses about copyright law.\n\nHow do you propose to determine whether a subject has been depicted only in an encyclopedia of fiction rapidly (and reliably) enough for this to be workable as a shoot-on-sight criterion? Kirill Lokshin\n\nI actually am a lawyer, and my suggestion isn't a \"wild guess,\" but I've also posted that issue on Wikipedia talk:Copyright to get more comments; hopefully my explanation there will be more clear.\n\nAbsent CSD criteria requiring an article on a fictional subject to mention in what work of fiction the subject originated, this would have to be an AFD criteria, unless someone has a way to make it work. Postdlf\n\nFair enough; my apologies for not realizing that. (I'd still be interested in a more detailed explanation of how discussing something that appears in an \"encyclopedia\" of fiction differs, in terms of copyright, from discussing something that appears in a work of fiction itself, as it seems rather counterintuitive.)\n\nIf it can't be made to work as a CSD criterion, why are we even discussing it here? Just write it into WP:FICT and go from there. ;-) Kirill Lokshin\n\nWe'll work on it. It is conceptually difficult.\n\nIt's part of why I want that as CSD criteria. Postdlf\n\nAs I mentioned above, I think many articles on fictional subjects that don't mention what work of fiction the subject originates in are speediable under A1 (little or no context). Angr (t • c)\n\nI would think that a general reference like \"appears in Star Wars\" would be enought to avoid A1, no? Kirill Lokshin\n\nYes, and if by \"appears in Star Wars\" you mean the 1977 film, it would pass what I'm talking about too. I don't think that a general reference like \"exists in the Star Wars universe\" would fail A1, however, but it would what I have proposed. Postdlf\n\n\"Appears in Star Wars\" is mentioning what work of fiction the subject is from, so yes, it's enough to avoid A1. Not enough to avoid PROD/AFD, though, if there's no mention of the character's relevance to the real world. Angr (t • c)\n\nIt's been my impression that such AFDs tend to end up merging the article somewhere, which has the advantage of maintaining comprehensive coverage; we can wikify the name of a random minor character mentioned in Luke Skywalker and likely wind up at some meaningful \"List of Foobars in Star Wars\" article. Deleting the possibly-not-notable stubs outright would seem to prevent this (or force us to avoid mentioning minor details in more notable articles). Kirill Lokshin\n\nYour original proposal was in NO way clear that you were talking about fair-use violations with regards to fictional encyclopedias. Not everyone reads every page; going to VP helped some, going to WP:Copyright helped much more. That all being said, I don't think your proposal covers anything not already covered by WP's copyright policy. If it's copyvio, it's copyvio, and should be excised without prejudice. If it's \"fiction written as fiction\" (like Project Quicksilver is from time to time), then it needs to be clarified/sourced/placed in a framework. -- nae'blis (talk)\n\nThe copyvio issue was one of the problems I wanted to address, but not the only issue. Sorry if I've been unclear. I was hoping for a discussion so we could all clarify these issues, not an immediate vote. Postdlf\n\nIf we're talking nothing but a novel, then discussions about its characters would be fine copyvio-wise. As soon as any encyclopedia or similar copyrighted source appears (or looks as though it might reasonably appear), then we immediately have to be on guard, because we're competing for market and our usage is nontransformative. (Which, I think, illustrates that the transformation requirement is a bit incoherent, but then, that's probably just me.) In such a case, I would limit our articles to only major topics within the fan universe, unless in theory we can get the go-ahead from the copyright holder(s) (probably unlikely, but you never know).\n\nExcellent work at deflating my ardent anti-notability-requirement-ness, Postdlf. You're the first to put a dent in it that it probably won't recover from. :) Applicable only in certain cases, though. —Simetrical (talk • contribs)\n\nThis is one of the absolute worst proposals I've ever read. I cannot support it under any circumstances. It's completely unnecessary- If something cannot be used legally, then it can't be used legally, that's already covered by other policies. Everything else is just attempts to get rid of articles that could easily be improved (by simple cleanup, merging, etc etc etc) for no reason other than \"it's fictional and I haven't heard of it, therefore it can't be notable\". No.--Sean Black (talk)\n\nOppose. CSD is absolutely the wrong process for this. Vague things such as fancruft can and should be dealt with under Prod and AfD instead. CSD is meant to be the narrow process; if you want to delete something that you find is not currently deleteable, CSD is the wrong end of the scale to start fitting it in. Henning Makholm\n\nOppose. More than once I have seen articles tagged for speedy deletion as patent nonsense when the only thing wrong is that they fail to mention in which game/book/movie/play they are in. Usually a Google check can find the context giving an opportunity to add that at the beginning of the article. Shooting down such articles without checking if they can be easily saved might cost us some good content. Sjakkalle (Check!)\n\nOppose. This issue should be dealt with in the context of the WP:FICT guidelines, not CSD. As for the concern about reproducing content from \"fictional encyclopedias\", I think this is a red herring: some works of fiction (Dictionary of the Khazars comes to mind) present themselves as reference books. That doesn't mean that they're really reference books, or that the copyright concerns of an article discussing characters or elements from the books are any different from any other work of fiction. —Josiah Rowe (talk • contribs)\n\nSee the discussion going on at Wikipedia talk:Copyrights#Copying fictional encyclopedias for why the concern about reproducing content from encyclopedias of fiction is not a red herring. Angr (t • c)\n\nOppose needing cleanup or attention is simply need a good reason to delete an article. Add the relevent tags, and it should improve over time, or you can fix it yourself. We shouldn't delete something just because it needs work. --W.marsh\n\nComment If an article is ONLY brand new fictional content I'd be OK with speedying it. That's how I read the key sentence in the start of the proposal \"any article should be speedy deletable that is written as fiction rather than about fiction\". But unless you are an expert on that fictional milleau I don't think you should be the person speedying it... tag it with PROD instead, or put it up for AfD because you are not competent to decide if it's just poorly sourced, or if it really is new fiction. Articles ABOUT fictional characters or situations are perfectly encyclopedic if properly cited/sourced and grounded in some discussion of why the character is important, and the milleau itself is important. Many of such stub articles ought to be merged back to the mains though. Consider this category: Category:Kushiel's_Legacy which has 40++ articles in it!!!! That series, (although I love it dearly... I want an anguisette of my own... but I digress!!) in my view, deserves maybe 5 articles or so, and all the one/two line stubs about various houses need to be merged... ++Lar: t/c\n\nand with that comment in mind Oppose. CSD's should be something ANY admin can apply. Deciding if a stub is meaningful in a particular fictional context takes jugement not every admin can make. So... not a good idea. ++Lar: t/c\n\nOppose as above, it is definitely a consensus issue to determine whether something is valuable if it comes from a fictional context. Real-world comments are the limit of the average admin. Ansell Review my progress!\n\nI have added A9 based on Jimbo's recent comments to the mailing list and existing practice. When we encounter a biography of a living person that is unsourced and negative in tone, we should revert if there is an NPOV version in the history; otherwise, the article should simply be deleted. AFDs in such situations make matters worse because the potentially libellous content gets spread around the wiki. As with other speedy critiera, admins are welcome to rewrite an article instead of deleting it if there is sufficient solid information available to do so. In my experience, A9 reflects existing practice among many admins and it deserves to be codified. The Uninvited Co., Inc.\n\nSince right now we have an unused A4 entry, why not make it A4 rather than A9? --Nlu (talk)\n\nI think its best not to re-use old numbers, in case of historical discussion. --Rob\n\nI dislike the focus on being negative in tone. Often, people put in defaming stuff, but then use weasel wording, to present neutrality (e.g. suppose an article says this, without any citation: \"Some people say he did such-and-such bad thing, but many others insist he is totally innocent. Nothing has been proven.\"). It's not relevant whether the article is generally nice or mean (that's easily fixable), its important whether the negative pieces are sourced. We don't want people to \"save\" articles, by merely making them neutral (but failing to give sources). I propose:\n\nA biography of a living person that has negative unsourced claims, must have the all unsourced negative claims removed immediately. If doing this removes all content, or removes any claim of notability, then the article should be speedy deleted. Before deleting, see if an acceptable (e.g. sourced) version exists in history. --Rob\n\nIs this not just a duplicate of A6? Stifle (talk)\n\nSounds like it. Maybe A6 needs slight clarification for this, but seems clear enough already. Petros471\n\nI agree: let us merge this into A6:\n\nAttack pages. Articles that serve no purpose but to disparage their subject (e.g., \"John Citizen is a moron\"). This includes biographies of a living person that are negative in tone and unsourced, where there is no NPOV version in the history to revert to.\n\nMost attack pages are high-school kid biographies anyway. Kusma (討論)\n\nMoving this to a6 is good. But Jimbo's comment (that spurred this), goes well beyond that. We've always speedied blatant attacks. But when somebody writes an unsourced article that would be ok *if* sourced, we have in the past just tagged it as {{unreferenced}} and then hoped for sources to be added later. So, to me the reason for a revised speedy criteria, is so we can delete those articles on site. What you suggested, could let those articles survive, by people fixing the tone, without providing sources. --Rob\n\nI see A9 as dealing with cases more subtle than attack pages. Historically, attack pages are usually opinionated, juvenile, or both. I added A9 to deal with articles that read like they are factual and which, if sourced, might actually be OK. I don't have a problem with folding this into A6 as long as it's clear. The Uninvited Co., Inc.\n\nDoesn't this open the door for the speedy deletion of articles about people who do not wish their article to appear in Wikipedia? Becasue the subject does not want it to appear, it would be impossible for any article on the subject to be non-negative. -- Malber (talk • contribs)\n\nNo. There's no prohibition writing biographies that contain negative information about people. But those negative claims must be well sourced. --Rob\n\nYet the article's subject could then question the veracity of the cited sources. Unless it's an obvious personal attack, whether or not something could be interpreted as negative is subjective. -- Malber (talk • contribs)\n\nQuestions as to the accuracy, veracity, or propriety of various sources are generally resolved by one's looking at WP:V. Joe\n\nI understand Uninvited's argument that this wording is \"more subtle\" than the existing wording of case A6 and I agree that such articles are inappropriate but frankly the very subtlety of the distinction concerns me. Candidates for speedy deletion must be bright-line issues. They should be immediately identifiable by any admin acting in good-faith. I'd rather see this folded into A6. Rossami (talk)\n\n* A biography of a living person with a low degree of verifiable notability and where the subject has requested that the article be deleted.\n\nRationale: Wikipedia may be an encyclopedia, but it is not a newspaper. Legal issues are not problematic if the article is neutral and well sourced, but articles about living persons who request them to be deleted should be removed out of politeness to the subject. No one should have to have an article on the 'pedia if he or she does not want it there. Think of it this way: Say you, as a private person, did something highly embarrassing that gained yourself 15 minutes of fame. Your actions would be notable and verifiable enough to have a bio stub created. Now, for the rest of your or Wikipedia's lifetime, you would have to monitor this article about you. Future employers would be able to Google your name and see what you did even long after your actions have fallen out of pop-cultural reference. However, you would have no recourse since the article is notable and verifiable. Out of common courtesy, you should be able to request you article be removed. -- Malber (talk • contribs)\n\nAbsolutely disagree. This isn't a reason to delete, let alone a reason to speedily delete. If Bill Clinton turns around and says \"I don't want an article about me on Wikipedia\" (as if a politician would turn down coverage) then, well, tough. If the person in question doesn't believe they are sufficiently notable, they could propose deletion in the normal way, but the fact that they are the article's creator is irrelevant. —Whouk (talk)\n\nI agree, of course, with Whouk. See, e.g., Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (3rd nomination) for a discussion of why a subject's desire not to be the subject of a WP bio is wholly immaterial to our goals of writing a verifiable encyclopedia, such that such desire should be altogether ignored. Joe\n\nOppose. Infinite abuse potential. -- grm_wnr Esc\n\nYep, bad idea for above reasons. Also note that if an article on a living person was seen as a problem by the foundation, it could be deleted or edited via a WP:OFFICE action. Friday (talk)\n\nTo comment on the expanded rationale - first off, if you made any news source online, Googling your name is still likely to bring whatever incident this is up. There doesn't just need to be an article about you for this to be the case - you could be mentioned on a Wikipedia article. But a \"15 minutes of fame\" otherwise forgotten doesn't scream notability. —Whouk (talk)\n\nTrue, that the online sources could still exist, but that is not Wikipedia's responsibility. And online news sources tend to evaporate after a time. Wikipedia articles are likely there for perpetuity. Notability is a sliding scale from Bill Clinton to Brian Peppers. -- Malber (talk • contribs)\n\nI'll add to the pile-on in complete opposition; I can't see anything in this suggestion worth keeping. The kind of politeness and common courtesy urged above have no application on Wikipedia, where creating a neutral and comprehensive resource requires us to compile information that many people would rather we didn't. A value greater than this \"politeness\" is the acceptance by an individual that once he has become a notable subject of study and discussion, he has no right to prevent true and noteworthy information about himself from being disseminated. This policy would eventually result in Wikipedia only having flattering articles on living people, whether because all the individuals about whom unflattering facts are known have requested the removal of the articles, or because Wikipedia contributors self-censor to avoid having a topic they are interested in draw the ire of its subject and be deleted. Postdlf\n\nIf your only claim of notability is those 15 minutes of fame, you shouldn't have an article at all, even if you are mentioned in the news and regardless of whether those 15 minutes have been embarassing or whether the author requests deletion. - Liberatore(T)\n\nThen perhaps we should have a graded scale for notability so as to avoid articles on people who do not want to be notable. -- Malber (talk • contribs)\n\nIf a biography can be deleted as a form of courtesy, that means that the article was not necessary in the first place. Therefore, the person is not notable, and the article should be deleted regardless of subject's request. However, I know that we will never get rid of the clutter of \"unncessary\" articles of Category:Living people, so count this as a Support if the proposal is modified to take into account a \"degree of notability\". - Liberatore(T)\n\nBased on my work with m:OTRS, I can say with confidence that there are a significant number of people who are legitimate topics of encyclopedia articles who would just as soon have their Wikipedia article deleted. We get such requests about once a day and they are routinely refused. I don't think we want to change that. One of the things that people not involved with answering the mail and phone do not realize is that there is a huge volume of requests for intervention that are turned down. A frequent one is people writing to us claiming some minor error in their article and based on that wanting us to replace the article with a piece written by their publicist and lock it against public editing. When we refuse this is usually followed up by a request to delete the article. The Uninvited Co., Inc.\n\nMalber, could you add any refactored proposal as a new line rather than editing the original proposal? Currently it makes it appear to anyone new to the discussion that the comments are above are on the proposal at the top when they're not.\n\nOn the subject of your revised proposal, I'd like to reaffirm my opposition to what the article's subject wants one way or the other. Issues or verifiability and notability need to be taken on their own merits. And, if you have to weigh all these things up carefully, the decision isn't a speedy one at all. —Whouk (talk)\n\nNoted. Since the consensus seems to be swinging to oppose, and the question of notability is subjective, perhaps this should be taken to WP:DP. I feel that semi-notable people wishing to remain private should have the right to opt out of inclusion. I don't think this is unreasonable and isn't necessarily contrary to the stated goals. -- Malber (talk • contribs)\n\nI am also in a pile-on oppose to this. People don't get to choose whether they have an article or not. If they're notable, they get one. If they're not, they don't. Unless the page is an attack page, it shouldn't be going anywhere, at least not without an AFD. Stifle (talk)\n\nI'm also opposed to this. What it will mean is not that the semi-notable are removed, but the semi-notable notorious. People who get 15-minutes of fame for doing something good will not be asking to be removed. It will be the small-time embezzler, etc., who wants to run for mayor. The last thing wikipedia needs is to build in a systematic bias towards good-stories. Bucketsofg✐\n\nWould anyone mind if I added another criteria on images: Vandalism-only images, that is, images that were used to vandalism the article, either by parodying the subject; like, quite a popular one, Bill Gates. What do you think? Kilo-Lima|(talk)\n\nNot necessary. Images can be removed from articles as nonsense vandalism. The images are then orphaned FU images and can be flagged for deletion as such. -- Malber (talk • contribs)\n\nVandalism-only images can be immediately speedied under G3. No need to wait for the 5-day orphaned FU grace period. Besides, the original image might not have been fair use. Angr (t • c)\n\nA proposed new criterion:\n\nTemplates that are intended for use in user: namespace which are either not transcluded at all (orphaned) or are only transcluded by one user or on a list of templates. If the content is acceptable for a user page, the deleting administrator should \"subst\" the template before deletion.\n\nComments? --Tony Sidaway\n\n(1) I don't see any reason to limit this to userspace-intended templates. It should apply equally to any unused template. (2) How can the admin seeing whether this speedy criterion actually holds quickly determine whether or not it's being widely substed? Angr (t • c)\n\nThat's a good question. In general, however, user: namespace templates are not intended to be substed, so I don't think there is necessarily a problem with that. Perhaps a subst-only template could be placed in a suitable category so that its intended usage is obvious. --Tony Sidaway\n\nIf WP:MACK passes, then most User: namespace templates will be substed, and it will be a very big problem. Angr (t • c)\n\nI thought the whole idea of substing under WP:MACK was so that they could then be deleted. Isn't it the intention that userboxes be removed from template space and should be propagated solely by code copying? --Tony Sidaway\n\nNot just userboxes, all templates intended for userspace, except the ones that have to be updated regularly. Come to think of it, if WP:MACK passes, this criterion will be almost moot, because the only any templates intended for userspace will be things like {{Signpost-subscription}} and {{Pic of the day}} that are widely used and have to be updated regularly. Angr (t • c)\n\nSpeedily deleting orphaned templates is not a good idea. Only unused templates should be deleted. Whether an orphaned template is unused (nobody uses it for subst) is non-obvious, so it should not be a speedy deletion criterion. \"Intended for use in the user namespace\" is also not a good way to classify templates, they should be classified by content, not intention. Kusma (討論)\n\nAgreed that they should be classified by content. So how about \"orphaned non-encyclopedic\" templates can be speedy deleted. We're not putting the encyclopedia in any kind of risk of damage by getting rid of unencyclopedic stuff. --Cyde↔Weys\n\nDetermining what is and isn't encyclopedic has always required discussion. Neither articles nor images are speedied for being unencyclopedic; rather, they're taken to AFD/IFD where they can be discussed. The same should continue to apply to templates (regardless of their intended destination namespace). Angr (t • c)\n\nIndeed. However: One could argue that all userspace templates are inherently unencyclopedic - but then we've just gone full circle. -- grm_wnr Esc\n\nI don't think it necessarily applies to all templates ... as there could be a reason why some template is only temporarily not being used (an editing dispute for instance). But deleting user templates poses no risk to the encyclopedia, so substituting and deleting them sounds like a good way to get them out of template space where they don't belong. --Cyde↔Weys\n\nOppose this for:\n\nDestorys historical versions of pages\n\nMakes it much harder to use a template, subst'ing it in is easy, finding the code and c-n-p is hard\n\nEven if noone wanted it substed this now makes it qualify for this (suppose the subster could be blocked for disruption)\n\nToo much instruction creep for \"user template\" lets get a user template policy in place first.\n\n— xaosflux Talk\n\nOppose completely. Don't speedy orphaned templates - an orphaned template might still be useful, but just not currently in use. We have to evaluate it for usefulness, and since that's subjective, TfD is necessary. Don't speedy templates used by only one user - they might legitimately use a template that nobody else knows about to organise information in a useful way in both article and user space. This kind of proposal in my opinion overlooks the point of templates, which is as a tool for organizing information - readers do not browse our templates looking for things to be offended by, and I see no reason why we should artificially restrict the purposes for which templates can be used beyond the ordinary restrictions placed on content. Deco\n\nOppose, why put people's backs up by speedying their templates which are harmless? Stifle (talk)\n\nWe seem to be in the middle of an influx of CSD proposals where the proposer appears to reason directly from \"X is a nuisance and should be deleted\" to \"We must have a CSD item for X\". Folks, even when the premise is true, the conclusion is usually not. CSD is not, and should not, be the first recourse for cleansing Wikipedia of unwanted things. We have regular XfD processes for that. CSD is for things that not only deserve to be deleted, but that can be deleted with a minimum of fuss and red tape because the outcome is not in doubt anyway. The perfect argument for a new speedy criterion would be something like \"There has been many X's passing through XfD for some time. They all consistently end up deleted without any substantial discussion. Conducting and concluding poll on X's are a significant drain on the available manpower for XfD. We should streamline the easy cases to free up resources.\" But some of the proposals above seem to be fueled instead by \"There are many X's on Wikipedia. They are harmful and/or do little good. We must do something about them!\" Henning Makholm\n\nXfD processes are looking pretty broken right about now. --Cyde↔Weys\n\nI think people are thinking they can make policy without making policy. If you're tired of articles about, say, noodles, but you know that you have no chance of getting a WP:NOODLES adopted, it's easy to think \"if only we could just speedy articles about noodles!\" and voila, the idea of CSD N1 is born. · rodii ·\n\nI agree that we don't need more criteria. I don't think we really even need the ones we have, honestly. I think most speedies are done by common sense rather than the letter of the rules anyway. The inability of written policy to adequately cover what can be speedied has been pointed out many times before. Friday (talk)\n\nFunny that the response to a broken XfD process is to break the CSD process as well. This could be part of a more ambitious scheme to remove editors from the deletion process altogether. Watch out - soon only administrators will be able to weigh in on deletion. You heard it here first. --71.36.251.182\n\nWe don't need many more CSDs. {{subst:prod}} is a perfect solution to most of the articles that shouldn't be there. The kind of new CSDs that work are things like {{nn-band}}, because literally dozens of band articles were hitting AFD daily before the criterion came in. That one worked. I don't know if there have been any CSDs since that have been neither instruction-creepy or discord-causing. Stifle (talk)\n\nAnd note that {{nn-band}} as a CSD came at the end of a long process of discussion and consensus-crafting, not at the beginning. It was a solution to a problem that was widely recognized and processed upon, rather than an first reaction to a perceived problem. Proposing a new CSD as a quick and dirty policy proposal smacks of \"premature closure\" to the problem-solving process. · rodii ·\n\nI agree with this. I suggest that we put big bold letters at the top of the talk page stating that Any proposed speedy deletion criterion should be both objective and involve a significant proportion of articles currently handled by other processes. But then we'd have to remove half of the ones we got. Deco\n\nI floated this a while back, but WP:PROD was broken. Now that it's essentially in working order, I'd like to revisit it:\n\nWe should be prodding, and not speedying, articles that would fall under A7: \"Non-notable\" people, groups, bands. The best way to improve such articles would not be to speedy them, but to allow as many eyes as possible to see them and possibly fix them. Many such articles that would already qualify are being prodded already, and can often be rescued and improved upon. As speedies are simply a quicker way of prodding - i.e., they're allegedly for non-controversial issues, this merely extends the issue, doesn't bite newbies who don't understand our guidelines, and will ultimately make for better articles.\n\nI also think it would be beneficial to do this with A1 and A3.\n\nThoughts? --badlydrawnjeff (WP:MEMES?)\n\nIf you do newpage patrol, you really get a better grasp of how much stuff well, basically needs to be deleted under A1, A3 and A7. Of course, I apply them rather rigidly, along the lines of \"There's truly nothing here that would be used in a good article or even a stub, so no point in keeping it\". There's just dozens of \"Gina Smith is the most beautiful girl in the world, she sits in homeroom with Daniel Jones.\" kind of articles created every few minutes, watch newpages for a while if you don't believe me. Do we really want to keep these around for 7 days? There'd be probably 10,000+ of them after a week, many of which would get the prods removed and fall through the cracks and mess up other areas of maintenence.\n\nIn other words, applying the CSDs ridigly, we do need them and they really do only get rid of stuff we'd have to rewrite totally if we were writing an article there, so they do no harm. The problem is not everyone applies them rigidly. --W.marsh\n\nI've done it. But that's A1, and if that needs to stay speedy, I certainly wouldn't protest in order to fix the other two. But I disagree that it does no harm. I've worked on a number of articles thanks to prod that I would have never considered creating or looking at, and I'm sure A7 has plenty like that, too. --badlydrawnjeff (WP:MEMES?)\n\nI think it would be liable to significantly increase AFD again, because people would just deprod their article-that-should-be-a-userpage and require an AFD.\n\nIt is important, however, as W.Marsh says, to apply the criterion strictly. If the answer to \"could this conceivably be of any use in the encyclopedia?\" isn't \"definitely not\", then we should be thinking about changing speedy to prod. Stifle (talk)\n\nI absolutely agree with this. Although \"does not assert the importance or significance of its subject\" is much stronger than \"non-notable\", it's still quite conceivable that a useful article could fail to assert the importance of its subject through simple accidental omission. Let some people look at it and add such an assertion if it is warranted. Deco\n\nI would support getting rid of A7, because a few days on prod gives it a chance for improvement without being a burden on anyone. I do not support getting rid of A1 or A3. They should be used narrowly, but kept, because there's no point in such articles. An A7 eligible article has information, but lacks the important bit about notability, which is usually easily fixed by someone familiar with the subject, if the subject is notable. A1 and A3 articles are barely even attempts at articles and usually even if the subject was worth writing about, you'd have to start it from scratch anyway. NickelShoe (Talk)\n\nI think all existing speedy criteria are useful, as long as they are not over-applied, which is a consistent problem (and pet peeve of mine). We will lose very few good articles from properly-applied A7's. -- SCZenz\n\nOne approach, is a \"middle ground\" between speedies and PRODs. Call it \"medium speed deletion\". Some (but not all) things tagged as {{nn-bio}} could be given 5(?) days before deletion. If there's still no assertion of notability, delete without AFD. If there is an assertion, remove the tag (with an option of AFD, if the assertion is week). This gives the creator a fair opportunity to fix the problem. It also helps newbies who are confused by an article \"disapearing for no reason\". This could work a little like {{no source}} does, in the sense such a tag can only be removed if the problem is actually fixed (unlike PROD which can be removed without justification). I realize numerious articles need to be \"shot on site\" but I think many (not all) a7s pose no harm, if they sit for 5 days. --Rob\n\nG2 currently says:\n\nTest pages (e.g., \"Can I really create a page here?\").\n\nI propose to qualify this with:\n\nThis excludes speedy deletion of test pages created by logged-in users in their own user space, except with the consent of the user in question.\n\nAny objections? Arbitrary username\n\nDoes that happen a lot? And while it is polite to ask before deleting even a test page in user space, does its deletion do any harm? Kusma (討論)\n\nYes, the deletion may do harm: the user may be in the middle of testing something! I've no idea whether it happens a lot, but just think it would be good for the criterion to contain a safeguard against it being used to disrupt other users' tests. Arbitrary username\n\nI would think that no admin would be careless enough to delete a sandbox user subpage without first checking to see who had placed the tag there, and asking the obvious question if that person turns out not to have been the user who created the subpage. Kirill Lokshin\n\nI don't think the exclusion does any harm. User subpages that can be speedied should be at the user's request, which is a different criteria. Maybe a simpler wording is \"Test pages (e.g., \"Can I really create a page here?\") outside of the user: namespace.\" -- nae'blis (talk)\n\nThanks, but I think the status quo is better than any wording which excludes test pages created in someone else's userspace. Arbitrary username\n\nNo need. Nobody's going to speedy userspace pages anyway. I credit most admins with some common sense. Stifle (talk)\n\nStifle and the others are, I think, correct. First, where a subpage is being used for at least a tangentially encyclopedic purpose, no one is likely to tag it for speedy (except, perhaps, a vandal or other user with whom one has had a serious conflict); G2 wouldn't apply in such a case, and an admin coming to the page would surely observe this. Joe\n\nThanks for your replies. My summary is that there is consensus that the change is unnecessary although not harmful. In view of this, I will not make the change. If frivolous nominations of user sandboxes ever become an actual recurrent problem, then this can be revisited. Arbitrary username\n\nCSD G1, is rarely used properly. For example let's say I wrote an article on why the sky is green, backed up with pseudo science, such as that 'reflections from lettuce cause it to be green'. It is 7 sentences long, and well written. Would you:\n\nSpeedy delete it under G1\n\nProd it\n\nSend it to AfD\n\nIf you would do 1, YOU ARE WRONG. CSD G1 refers only to patent nonsense, and that article would not be patent nonsense. In fact patent nonsense is a useless CSD, as the things that it would include are already included under CSD G2 and G3. Should the patent be taken out, leaving only nonsense? The only downside I see is that this gives admins more power to interpret the policy. However, this interpretation is already available in speedy deleting under CSD G3. What do you think, are there other reasons not to do this I haven't thought of?\n\nProdego talk\n\nI don't see why the thing shouldn't just be deleted as rubbish. It's possible to be too pedentic about these things, you know. --Tony Sidaway\n\nBecause people don't always have good judgement as to what's rubbish. I've seen at least one article written by an advanced physicist AfD'd because it looked like pseudoscience; in fact, it was on a notable topic and had been written at too technical a level. -- SCZenz\n\nI agree completely here. This is why I don't think we need to lump these things as \"patent nonsense\". However this doesn't mean that we don't delete complete rubbish when we see it just because it doesn't fit some handy category. If we make a mistake, it's reversible. --Tony Sidaway\n\nBut if so, it should have a category. This page is a list of every reason something can be speedy deleted, correct? Prodego talk\n\nYou mean a speedy deletion criterion? Not really. Some trash that should be deleted doesn't have a matching criterion. It's just trash. Such deletions are not to be performed lightly, but I believe they are necessary. Prod (Proposed deletion) may be appropriate for borderline trash, but an article of the kind you list above is obvious bilge and it would be a waste even to tag it for prod. Even well written bilge should be deleted. --Tony Sidaway\n\nI think that makes sense; I've run into blatant and deliberate rubbish just this morning. However, I worry that although mistakes are reversible, they may never be caught in the case of speedy deletion. That's why I tend to favor following the CSD pretty strictly; so that something that could be controversial (even if the deleter doesn't think so) has a chance to be reviewed. -- SCZenz\n\nProdego is altogether correct; if we are to make something eligible to be deleted speedily, we ought at least fairly specifically to enumerate what precisely should be so deleted (and why). When patrolling new pages, I often find pages almost exactly as that which Prodego describes, and I find differentiating between patent nonsense and other unencyclopedic but not speediable content to be exceedingly difficult. But I can't abide Tony's suggestion that admins simply use their discretion here: first, because process is important, and it would be good for us to delineate exactly what obvious bilge should be deleted (and how we might identify such bilge); and, second, because admins aren't, on the whole, supposed to act discretionarily (rather, they act, in most cases, ministerially). I certainly understand for myself the difference between that which is nonsensical (even if well-written) and that which is only unencyclopedic and thus ought to be PRODded or AfDed, but I'm certain that others view the dichotomy differently, and it would be to our advantage to have a consistent criterion, though I fear that any we write will invariably be nebulous and invite discretionary deletions in any event. Joe\n\nI think the key of our difference is \"admins aren't, on the whole, supposed to act discretionarily (rather, they act, in most cases, ministerially)\" I don't believe this to be true. I'm a sysop because I've got a brain and I'm expected to use it. I don't think it's possible to delineate all the instances in which administrator actions are beneficial, and so we have discretion and our written policy follows behind at a much more conservative pace. --Tony Sidaway\n\nI think this is easily one of the most abused speedy policies. People use it for good content poorly written, content they don't understand and content they disagree with. Admins don't always have good judgment as to what's rubbish and what isn't and unfortunately many times when this happens it involves a new user so you get BITE thrown in as well. More than just about any other criteria, G1 one should be followed pretty close to the bone. That's one of the reasons Prod is such a good idea, it takes the pressure of off having to interpret speedy criteria in cases where it doesn't quite fit. Rx StrangeLove\n\nIn the case presented above, speedy is definitely the correct course of action. When I see jokeshop articles come up on AFD, I tag them with CSD. For example, JIMMY and X-Treme Napping, even if as in the AFD for Jimmy, others seem to disagree on the application of G1. I fully expect admins, as mentioned above, to use some parts of their brain. It is perfectly reasonable to delete hoax/vandalistic articles, even if G1 didn't exist. However, like the 2 examples I have given, they would have to be pretty outright stupid/hoax. Admins who delete good content poorly written or content that they don't understand or disagree with, its a problem with the admin and not with the liberal application of this rule. - Hahnchen\n\nI also believe that case G1 should be interpreted and applied very narrowly. Vandalism is speedy-deletable. Hoaxes are not. The reason we've never established a speedy-deletion criterion for hoaxes is that, as individuals, we have proven to be very poor at identifying them. Too often, something tagged as a hoax has turned out to be a true though poorly written article about a particularly obscure topic. I made a hobby of collecting examples for a while. But when you run a hoax through the full AFD process, we find that collectively we are very good at sorting out the hoaxes from the garbage.\n\nTony is partially right. We are supposed to use our brains. Admins are not supposed to be automatons. However, we must be very cautious about the risk of hubris - the assumption that we know best. Decisions which do not fit the narrow speedy-deletion criteria should be dealt with through our other channels. Rossami (talk)\n\nI agree. I see G1 applied to all kinds of articles that are not, in fact, nonsense; probably the only more-abused CSD is {{db|not notable}}. Patent nonsense actually means something very specific, and Tony's exhortations aside, it's rife with abuse. -- nae'blis (talk)\n\nI agree too. I see all kinds of things deleted as G1 that aren't--Monster raving loony party just the other day. It was a crap article but not patent nonsense, and it should have gone through AfD or at least {{prod}}. Increasingly I think admins are using G1 to indicate \"article I consider stupid.\" Saying \"If we make a mistake, it's reversible\" is too glib--that mistake might be the one that turns a potentially valuable contributor away from this place, in a way that's not reversible. Why not try not making the mistake? · rodii ·\n\nThat one should have been speedy-redirected to Official Monster Raving Loony Party, which is a pretty decent article. --Carnildo\n\nAnd ultimately it was. My point is just that all kinds of stuff gets the G1 treatment because an admin just doesn't \"get\" the page. It's not really a fault of the admin, but we should be careful. (And I just picked that example because I was familiar with it, having brought it up in deletion review, not because I thought it was a big huge hairy deal.) · rodii ·\n\nAgreed. The CSD criteria is clear (and always has been) on what is \"patent nonsense\". Patent nonsense does not mean \"does not make logical sense to you\". It means that is unintelligible or unreadable. I could tell you the earth revolved around the sun and you could tell me that this was nonsense, which is a subjective qualification. However, it would not be patent nonsense, which is an objective qualification. As WP has grown, this incredible inability of some of its members (including among admins) to separate subjective qualifications from objective qualifications has been the very plight of CSD. - Keith D. Tyler ¶ (AMA)\n\nPrecisely. Joe\n\nWell said, Keith -- Samir धर्म\n\nIs it possible we could now look at removing the time constraint on I3, which allows\n\nImages licensed as \"for non-commercial use only\" or \"used with permission\" that were uploaded on or after May 19, 2005, and for which no assertion of fair use is provided.\n\nGiven that the date is over one year ago, I would suggest there has been ample time to source alternatives for any such images. Thoughts? Hiding Talk\n\nWe would need to ensure that the categories are clear first. I'd favour listing them on WP:PUI (and have done so quite a number of times). Stifle (talk)\n\nHow about adding something allowing speedy deletion of orphans in with those criteria? They're not actually used, so they don't need time to find a replacement image. --Rory096\n\nThat sounds OK. Any objections? Stifle (talk)\n\nDue to the lack of objections, I have added this. Stifle (talk)\n\ndoes stuff like http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Webserver_directory_index&action=edit&oldid=54293158 come under the pure vandalism category? I presume it does but it could perhaps be mentioned explicitly. Plugwash\n\nPure vandalism is criterion G3. If the list had been visible, I would have said that the page did not apply under that case. Spam is not the same as vandalism. The fact that the anon user who created the page took the extra steps to attempt to hide the text, however, is a clear sign of bad faith editing. I think the vandalism case could apply in this situation. That's a case-specific judgment call, though. I think amending the wording of the speedy-deletion criterion based on this one situation is probably not appropriate. This is especially true because the contents clearly did fit criterion A3 (No content except a list of links) regardless of whether the edit was made in good or bad faith. It probably also fit criterion A1 (No context for expansion). So it was speedy-deletable without any changes to policy necessary. Rossami (talk)\n\nBut it was a talk page not an article page, so surely stuff in the \"articles\" section doesn't apply Plugwash\n\nWhat about adding non-notable sites as a CSD. This may fall under A7, but it needs clarification. Computerjoe's talk\n\nIf you mean websites that don't claim any notability (not just \"are non-notable\") and don't have any association with a company that's notable, then it might work. But in general, {{subst:prod}} works. Stifle (talk)\n\nNon-notable websites was a proposed CSD about a year ago at the same time A7 was proposed, but failed to get consensus. The idea of notability is actually rather slippery; even A7 refers only to \"evidence of notability\" or words to that effect. I agree that prod works very well for this. --Tony Sidaway\n\nNotability can sometimes be hard to discern, and I don't think one admin who thinks something is non-notable should be able to speedy delete a page. I've seen plenty of notable pages go up for AFD for non-notability because some people had never heard of it, but in the course of a few people looking at it, they were able to determine it was notable. Doesn't seem smart to let that one person who may not have heard about it delete a page on sight. The Ungovernable Force\n\nA website should be speedied if it doesn't claim notability, or has a very poor claim (we get 100 hits a month and soforth). Allowing speedy deletes of nn sites would clear up AFD. Computerjoe's talk\n\nAs of now, you could already speedy delete the following types of website articles: no context (A1); only a link to the site (A3); attacks on the website (A6); websites solely for a non-notable person, group, band, or club (A7); content copied directly from the website (A8); etc. -- King of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠\n\nI've removed two lines about checking the articles history and using Google to check context. Every little drip and drab goes towards making this page fatter, and if you're not already checking the history of things than please stop speedy deleting. - brenneman\n\nShould there be a policy created allowing speedy deletion of articles that are blatant advertisements? I cannot seem to find one anywhere. --D-Day(Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?, on WHEELS?!)\n\nNo, because what one person calls \"blatant advertising\" another person calls \"an informative article about a company\". PRODding (or, if that's contested, AFDing) gives people a five-day grace period to change an article from blatant advertising into an actual encyclopedia article. Angr (t • c)\n\nIt's a matter of judgement. Some things are blatantly spam; I delete those. Others, as Angr suggested, can be prodded or tossed to AfD. There's no real need for policy here. Mackensen (talk)\n\nIf you're really keen turn that blatent ad into an actual article. I know, adding content is too much like hard work, but someone should do it. - brenneman\n\nMaybe there should be a 'fast delete' which is, say 2 days, to give authors a chance to shape up. My concern is that Google seems to scrape and pick up WP very fast nowadays, and puts the adspam at the top of the search list, mission accomplished for spammer. Any ideas how to beat that strategy? Crum375\n\nJust remove the external links in the article, and any inappropriate internal links to it. Henning Makholm\n\nWhat if we have article for small company A, with one short paragraph describing it, and links to its web site. No link or ref to any neutral site mentioning it. If we delete their link, how does it make the article any better? (See this as case in point.) Crum375\n\nRemoving the link negates the benefit the spammer would get from a googlescrape. The article can be deleted using ordinary process afterwards. Henning Makholm\n\nThe problem is easy to see in the History for this case in point, where the spam promoter sits on top of the page and keeps reverting changes, and could bring up sockpuppets if needed. It is too wasteful for serious editors to engage in revert wars with a dedicated spammer. If admins are needed then it's wasteful of that resource also. A simpler delete process, shorter than the Googlescrape time window, would solve it, at least for clear cut cases like this one. Crum375\n\nMackensen, many of the articles in question are about companies which fall so far short of WP:CORP as to make the effort of saving them a waste of energy. I have been known to fix spam articles for genuinely notable companies. Just zis Guy you know?\n\nOne possible solution for these is immediate AfD (no prod). If the company is actually notable, people will notice during the time the article spends on AfD and it will be cleaned up. If the company is non-notable, the AfD tag (which cannot be removed) serves as a warning to everyone, the user responsible is likely to give up before the AfD page is complete, and it increases the chance that someone will notice an A8 and speedy it. --ais523 08:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nWhy is a redundant image defined as the same image file format? I propose changing the wording to \"An image that is a redundant copy, in the same or less ideal image file format and same or lower resolution, of something else on Wikipedia.\" Otherwise, we're liable to have the same image in GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, TIFF, BMP, ART, and RAW formats all over Wikipedia. —BorgHunter ubx (talk)\n\nI tend to agree, as long as it's made clear that the images must clearly be the same (as in not two different photos of the same object, but two different versions of the same photo) the source should also be the same so why say that different sized JPEG versios of the same image are speedy deletion candidates, but identical (except for some compression artifacts) JPEG and PNG images are not candidates for speedy deletion. -Sherool (talk)\n\nBecause different browsers support different formats. Some none at all => no problem. Some very old only GIF87a (no animation, no transpareny), but these browsers also don't support the \"Host: header\" for virtual hosts, it's almost impossible to use them today => almost irrelevant. The next generation had GIF89a (animation + transparency) and JPEG. I'm sure that they are still used, because I do. No inline PNG unfortunately. Another generation supported PNG, but had issues with its transparency. For important icons the best choice wrt backwards compatibility is GIF89a (the \"burn all GIFs\" LZW patent expired more than a year ago). Important icons are those where getting an ersatz-\"broken image\"-icon really won't do, e.g. warning templates. Icons also don't really need all PNG features, for 64*64 pixels 255 colours + transparency are good enough, and probably smaller than a 64*64 PNG with more colours. The IUP mainly addresses images, not icons.\n\nFor JPEG vs. PNG I can't judge what's better, but JPEG is quite popular, and supported on more platforms. -- Omniplex\n\nThat sounds like a debate you should take to Wikipedia:Image use policy wich is there the prefeered formats are outlined. This suggestion is merely that various identical images in different formats should be speedy deletion candidates in favour of the version in the prefeered format (whatever it is) for the type of image asuming they are otherwise \"identical\" (as far as the human eye is concerned). Just curious what browser is it that you are using? And why not simply upgrade or switch to a better one? --Sherool (talk)\n\nI would use the word \"pixel identical\" - it must have exactly the same pixels, with no loss of image information whatsoever, including any additional info like an alpha layer or separate image layers (like for example Photoshop and certain document files have). In particular, we should not be replacing PNGs of photographs with JPEGs - the invisible information is useful for editing and preventing generational decay. Deco\n\nOk, fair enough, but I see no reason to not allow the reverse. If we have a lineart image that as far as the human eye is concerned is identical in both JPEG (except maybe some ugly artefacts), GIF, PNG and SVG format why not allow speedying of the versions that are in a less desierable format (acording to our image use policy), those are all losless formats. Granted there is the alpha level transparancy issues, but it's rarely a major issue, and since we seem to have consensus to prefeer PNG over GIF (and SVG over PNG) that has presumably already been cosnidered. It's far more common to upload lineart as JPEG than uploading photos as PNG or GIF anyway (and if the photo is in GIF format you have already lost a whole crapload of color depth so it's not very usefull to keep as a \"grandparent\" for future JPEG versions). --Sherool (talk)\n\nThe policy page is unprotected now; someone want to add this yet? I don't want to; I suggested it, I'd rather another party do the adding. Much simpler, and greater chance of hitting a good consensus version. —BorgHunter (talk)\n\nI strongly object to this proposed change. Yes, our image use policy indicates that certain formats are preferable to others. This information is generally accurate, but there are exceptions to every rule. It's bad enough that some users fail to realize this (and perform illogical image replacements purely for the sake of following the rules). We certainly shouldn't allow the \"redundant\" images to be deleted on sight. —David Levy\n\nAfter watching and participating in CFD for a few months, I've developed the opinion that an empty category shouldn't be a criteria for deletion much less speedy deletion. Because of the way categories are implemented it is nearly impossible to know what the contents of a category were in the past so someone could empty the category and put it up for speedy deletion unless someone checks his edit history, which no one does. And two people could do it with no way of anyone else finding out.\n\nIt isn't really all that important anyway if a category is empty or not. What's important is if it is a logical category with a good place in the category bush. If it is a good, logical category, people will eventually put articles into it. --JeffW\n\nIt certainly will, and CSD is NOT SALT. If a new article comes along that fits a logical category, it will create it in the process of writing or categorizing it. Although I would love a \"category history\" of some sort from the category's POV, I don't think the code supports it now. — xaosflux Talk\n\nSomeone could blank an article and then put up new text that falls under one of the CSDs. In all deletions, the administrator doing the deletion needs to check the edit history. If admins are being too lazy to check edit history, it seems like overkill to remove a CSD to compensate... kmccoy (talk)\n\nA category isn't like an article. If a category is empty it is impossible to find the edit history of the articles that were in the category yesterday, since there is no way to find those articles. --JeffW\n\nThis criterion used to stand as having been empty for one day, but because of the concerns you raise now, it was felt that four days would be sufficient time for people to check that nothing \"suspicious\" has happened. Category deletion is no big deal. You are right that it's impossible to know what was in the category, but as User:Xaosflux states, if a category was wrongly deleted, it's quite simple to recreate it. Hiding Talk\n\nIs there a speedy deletion template that says the page is pure vanity? Please direct me to it if there is. If there isn't, I'll be happy to make it. -Kitty the Random\n\n{{db-bio}} (etc) is the closest we have. Note that \"pure vanity\" is not a recognized speedy criterion: vanity articles tagged with db-bio that do claim notability are routinely refered to prod or AfD instead. Henning Makholm\n\nUserfy them and tag the redirect for deletion as a cross-namespace redirect. The template {{nn-userfy}} is handy for this. Just zis Guy you know?\n\nI sometimes work on drafts like Talk:Interstate 10 in Texas that aren't ready for an article yet. I was concerned to find out that these can be speedied - where else should I put something like this so others can find it? --SPUI (T - C)\n\nUserspace is probably a good place - I think just move the page afterwards should do the trick. RN\n\nAnd if I never get around to finishing it? If I put it on the talk page, others can find it and complete it. --SPUI (T - C)\n\nI'm willing to bet that some of these drafts have already been deleted under this. Thus, unless anyone gives a good reason to tolerate this worsening of the encyclopedia, I will \"unilaterally\" remove this criterion from the CSD. --SPUI (T - C)\n\nIIRC, I think the CSD was changed from Talk pages of only deleted articles to all Talk pages without articles because anons can create Talk pages, which had been problematic because some anons were creating undesirable content in that namespace. I don't know whether that's a problem anymore, though. --AySz88^-^\n\nWell, Wikipedia articles are always in progress... they don't have to be perfect before they can be created. I've always found the concept of temp pages to be a bit of a misnomer, all articles are temp pages, the way I see it... something can always be improved. So I'd say that the article space is a good place to put this kind of stuff. --W.marsh\n\nYou think Talk:State Highway 550 (Texas) would be suitable for an article? --SPUI (T - C)\n\nNo, but why not just create a stub for the article? I could do it in 10 minutes and I've never even heard of State Highway 550. Then people can improve the actual article if they want, or discuss on the talk page. --W.marsh\n\nHere's a partial list so if they are deleted I can request undeletion:\n\nTalk:Interstate 10 in Texas\n\nTalk:State Highway 550 (Texas)\n\nTalk:State Highway Loop 1604 (Texas)\n\nTalk:State Highway Spur 5 (Texas)\n\nAnd others may have been deleted already. --SPUI (T - C)\n\nSPUI, here's a suggestion. If something good you are working on gets speedied, come to me (or David Gerard, or any number of other admins who are huge fans of yours) and ask us to quietly undelete it. The worst you could expect is a refusal. --Tony Sidaway\n\nHere's the issue - I make some notes on the talk page and don't necessarily get back to it, let alone realize it's been deleted. --SPUI (T - C)\n\nOh pop it on your watchlist. --Tony Sidaway\n\nHm, my experience is that page deletions do not appear in one's watchlist; the deleted page simply disappears quietly. One can see them as redlinks in the \"list all watched pages\" view, but even that does not distinguish between recent and old deletions. Henning Makholm\n\nYeah... I get an error trying to load my 28,787-page watchlist. So I can't check for redlinks there. --SPUI (T - C)\n\nTalk space is not the place to be working on drafts. That's what user subpages are for. I don't buy your argument \"If I put it on the talk page, others can find it and complete it.\" If others come across these talk pages without articles, they aren't going to think, \"Oh, here's a draft for me to finish!\" They're going to think \"WTF? This isn't a talk page, and there isn't even an article attached. Delete it!\" Just because SPUI has a habit of misusing Talk space this way doesn't make it acceptable and certainly doesn't justify removing an eminently reasonable speedy criterion. Angr (t • c)\n\nThat's just wrong. What else are talk pages for if not for working on the article? If we insist, SPUI can probably pretend he's \"talking\" to people, \"Hey, I'd like to do this, any objections?\" And if there isn't even enough information for a stub yet, use {{deletedpage}}. Those we are meant to keep the talk page for. - brenneman\n\nI agree that there is not a reason to remove this CSD; it, like all others, just needs to be tempered with common sense. If you see an orphaned talk page that looks like notes or a draft, you probably shouldn't delete it, at least userfy it. The same goes for a talk page archives. Kotepho\n\nSPUI, you'd probably get a lot of mileage out of a cear boldface note at the top of the page announcing that it contains some draft material for the as yet non-existent page. You could ask that admins not delete it without tugging on youyr sleeve first, and maye invite contribution from passers-by. You could problably design a template for it - {{DraftPage}} or something. -GTBacchus(talk)\n\nThis suggestion works just fine. As does creating a stub, which is hardly challenging. Let's not change the rules to handle a single editor's preferred way of working. Just zis Guy you know?\n\nDoes the above discussion constitute consensus that User:SPUI's \"note pages\" should be exempt from the criterion? I don't see overwhelming support that this is a use of talk pages that it worth the rule complication it would take to exempt it. Yet his edit summary changing the criterion claims consensus. Agreeing with JzG above, Henning Makholm\n\nThere is no consensus to remove the criterea, but the tweak he did seems fairly uncontroversial (at least no one have reverted it yet). I mean I would encourage people to create stubs rather than dump notes on talk pages for yet-to-be-created articles, but if there is some good starter info there I see no particular reason to blindly delete it either. The potential usefulnes of such notes seems to outweight the need to avoid orphanded talk pages at all costs... --Sherool (talk)\n\nAll,\n\nPlease remember not to edit protected pages, but also not to merely revert when asking the original errer to revert himself would be so much more conducive to happiness.\n\nJames F. (talk)\n\nHow are users able to edit protected pages in the first place? --68.190.51.99\n\nAll 800+ admins. Unfortunately we are not above edit warring... Petros471\n\nActually 900+ User:Prodego\n\nYes, I asked James to take a look because of the rather tense circumstances. I had self-reverted after inadvertently editing the page while it was protected (an easy mistake for a sysop to make). Another admin then made the same mistake, so I informed him on his talk page and asked him to revert. Meanwhile a third admin had reverted the second, which in the circumstances could have led to an edit war between administrators on a protected page--the kind of activity that tends to end in immediate temporary desysoppings and arbitration cases to confirm them. --Tony Sidaway\n\nPlease see Wikipedia:T1 and T2 debates and Wikipedia talk:T1 and T2 debates, where you'll find everything that's suddenly missing from here. Please proceed in an orderly fashion, no pushing. -GTBacchus(talk)\n\nAlthough this move might be controversial, I think it's a great idea. The T1/2 debate generate noise for as long as the rules exist and make it impossible to effectively discuss anything else here. I hope others won't mind. Deco\n\nAnd there was much rejoicing. Thank you! Henning Makholm\n\nI've also announced the new page at Wikipedia:Village pump (policy) -GTBacchus(talk)\n\nThis seems to be a reasonable move in general, but I have some minor concerns. The new \"summary\" page also includes a \"Discussion\" section. That seems inappropriate to me. If the page is intended to be an NPOV characterization of the debate, then the continued debate belongs on the talk page. Also, I would have preferred the summary to be a subpage of Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion, since that's it's main topic. That way, a bread crumb link would be at the top of the new page. Rfrisbietalk\n\nHow does one propose new criteria? If this page is the location, I would like to propose to add the following criterion for speedy deletion of redirects:\n\nA redirect to a page of which the subject is neither the same as nor extremely closely related to the subject one would expect to see under the title of the redirecting page.\n\n- Andre Engels\n\nThe proper procedure for dealing with that is to edit the redirect page either to point to something more reasonable, or to be a stub for the topic indicated in its title. If neither of these make sense, take it to RfD instead. Are there so many meaningless redirects left after the two first options that it is worth the trouble to have a speedy criterion instead of following the standard RfD procedure? And can the class be defined sufficiently objectively that it is safe to delete them as speedies? Henning Makholm\n\nWell put. fuddlemark (befuddle me!)\n\nI see that there has been some discussion of hoaxes before, but I feel that this issue should be revisited. Right now at AfD, there's a series of articles which are obviously hoaxes. The claims made in these articles (about a made-up band) are preposterous; #1 singles, smash-hit albums, and various other accomplishments are listed, despite the fact that the band, its members, and its albums get no relevant Ghits. However, despite the fact that these articles are so clearly unencyclopaedic hoaxes, they will remain on the mainspace for the next five days while the AfD runs its inevitable course. Perhaps if there is solid evidence that an article is a hoax, it can be considered for speedy deletion? I don't see any reason to leave these articles (or others like them) on the website any longer than we have to. Cheers! The Disco King\n\nI think \"solid evidence that an article is a hoax\" as a criterion is far too dependent on discussion and review to be well suited as a speedy criterion. A single AfD case is very far from being reason to add speedy criteria, and there is no particular cost associated with letting a hoax sit in article space for a few days while due process runs its course. As long as they are conspicuously tagged and the rest of article space can be kept free of gratuitous wikilinks to the hoaxes (through ordinary editor vigilance), what immediate harm does their temporary presence in the database do? The reason you ask for is that proper process is what keeps your article about some obscure corner of your hobby from being speedily deleted as a hoax before you get a chance to explain yourself and provide references. Speedy deletions are basically a weakening of process by relying on single persons making correct judgements. This is a necessity sometimes when the process (relative to the number of cases) is so bulky that everything would grind to a halt by following it each time, but it should not be extended lightly. Henning Makholm\n\nAccording to WP:HOAX, \"Hoaxes in Wikipedia are considered vandalism, and the originator of a hoax is subject to blocking and banning.\" WP:VAND clarifies that vandalism includes \"insertion of bad jokes or other nonsense\". Thus, a blatant hoax can already be speedied as G3. A hoax is NOT G1 patent nonsense, but according to both WP:HOAX and WP:VAND, a hoax would fall into G3. I agree, though, with User:Henning Makholm that you don't want administrators having to immediately evaluate whether or not something is a hoax. BigDT\n\nAH!!! I smell wikilawyering! *runs away* --M1ss1ontomars2k4 (T | C | @)\n\nI'd say that allows sufficient leeway to delete the blindingly obvious, and the balance need to go through a process of review (several supposed hoaxes have turned out to be valid but obscure, and the converse is also not unknown). Just zis Guy you know?\n\nObvious hoaxes are normally gone and they can count as nonsense, like for example I found some bs on a fake country in random pages before and it was quickly deleted like a minute after I tagged it, but alot of them just go though AFD or prod and has to wait five days for someone to delete it. There should be a new CSD critrea making all hoaxes a speedy cantidate. Someonebay\n\nAbsolutely not. The problem is that many apparent hoaxes are not at all obvious. Speedy-deletions are deleted on the view of a single administrator and get no oversight. Our own history has repeatedly shown us that as individuals we are not very good at sorting out the hoaxes from the poorly written stubs about real but very obscure topics. Too many such articles have been tagged as hoaxes only to be later verified. As a community, we are quite good at sorting them out but that's what the AFD process is all about. For a while, I was even collecting examples of such discussions. There's still a partial list somewhere on my userpage.\n\nNow, I'm not defending the articles which are patent nonsense (in the narrow way we use that term here) nor am I defending clearly identifiable vandalism. But an attempt to set an absolute rule that \"all hoaxes are speedy deletion candidates\" will do more harm than good. The AFD process works. Let it take its course. Rossami (talk)\n\nYes, AfD's triumph is the five day discussion that can be used to distinguish a hoax from a verifiable subject. We don't want to telescope that to a single administrator. Afd provides the opportunity for rigorous research prior to declaring a hoax, but it would be too onerous to require a single administrator at RC patrol to do it all. --Tony Sidaway\n\nI agree with Tony - and if it takes a while to prove that something is a hoax (\"I've never heard of it\" isn't proof), different admins could start the research, come to different conclusions, and revert each others actions. This is unadvisable. AfDs can and do close early if the research is done and everyone agrees that it is a hoax. Sometimes an apparent hoax is real, sometimes something apparently real is a hoax. GRBerry\n\nThe current wording might not be consistent with the current interpretation by (some? most?) administrators. There is a small discussion going on at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Many Speedy Deletions of talk pages. Ardric47\n\nWould it be possible to have a speedy deletion criteria for images that have an obvious watermark on them indicating their copyright? --Hetar\n\nCopyrighted images, whether watermarked or not, might be legal to use under fair use. Kusma (討論)\n\nEven if they might be legal under fair use, do we really want images with glaringly obvious watermarks on them? --Hetar\n\nWhat's wrong with glaringly obvious watermarks? --M1ss1ontomars2k4 (T | C | @)\n\nObvious copyvios, even though they can be trimmed the trademark. Someonebay\n\nThe purpose of a watermark is not to assert a legal copyright but to give credit to a particular entity. We don't really want them in images for the same reason we don't usually credit authors in articles. But we certainly don't need to delete them - they're not hard for any halfway-decent clone brusher to remove, and there are techniques for removing them even if they cover the whole image. Deco\n\nSince the page is currently protected due to the editing war on T1 and T2, this is to remind myself to add a very brief, digested note of the exemptions listed on WP:UP#How do I delete my user and user talk pages? in which user pages and talk pages do not qualify for speedy deletion. Zzyzx11 (Talk)\n\nWhich would be more efficient than just having \"See Wikipedia:User page for full instructions and guidelines\". Zzyzx11 (Talk)\n\nSo, a working sentence I was thinking about adding to CSD U1 is, \"This does not apply to user pages that contain evidence of policy violations or significant abuse, or pages in which there is an administrative need to retain the personal information\" or something like that. Zzyzx11 (Talk)\n\nI'd like to propose a CSD criterion for image description pages when the image in question is on Commons. Exceptions would be for IDPs for Featured Pictures when the picture is on Commons. Otherwise, there's really not much use for them as far as I can figure. Please correct me if I'm wrong, though. howcheng {chat}\n\nI've been deleting these anyway. They seem unhelpful as the obscure any changes to e.g. licensing that may occur on Commons, and the purpose of Commons is to have a centralised resource. This is a comparatively rare occurance, though, and it probably doesn't really need its very own CSD. Still, I'd not object. -Splashtalk\n\nWell for some kinds of images it can sometimes be usefull to add Wikipedia spesific info to the page. For example adding {{countryedit}} to flag images and such. If the description page is blank or otherwise serves no usefull purpose I'd say \"blank image\" (I2) applies since there is no image on the actual page you delete. --Sherool (talk)\n\nI've occasionally seen pages used to add images to categories. --Carnildo\n\nI wonder about the usefulness of that -- why keep that metadata local? Jkelly\n\nBecause when you browse Wikipedia categories you don't get to see Commons categorization (and in general Commons categories are differently specified and named than Wikipedia ones)? Henning Makholm\n\nI thought I2 was for when the image file itself existed but was just a blank GIF or PNG or something. So it seems that IDPs for Commons image sometimes do serve a purpose. Maybe a better wording would be something like:\n\nImage description pages for images or media that exist on Commons where the page serves no real purpose.\n\n--howcheng {chat}\n\nI seen in my time in wikipedia as a IP, images from commons get speedy deleted, I endorse a new policy on it. Someonebay\n\nI just saw a notice on a userpage that referred to 'CSD U2', but there is no such criterion that I can see from the main page. The notice was added by User:Tawkerbot to the page User talk:130.88.171.226 on 3 March 2006. Category:IP talk pages for speedy deletion was transcluded and the text of the notice states \"This page has been automatically marked for deletion under the criteria for speedy deletion U2 (recycling IP talk pages). If you are adding a new message, please remove this notice\". Looking at the category in question, this appears to have been an experimental speedy deletion criterion. Is this criterion still in force or under debate? Thanks for the input. User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nIt was an old criterion that was in effect until people realized that IP talk pages should be blanked, not deleted. -- King of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠\n\nthis page has been unprotected. Play nice. Homey\n\nI propose the following criterion:\n\nNo encyclopedic value whatsoever. Images used solely on pages deleted per A7, attack images, and images depicting unnecessary obscenities can be deleted immediately.\n\nThis image criterion would reduce the backlog on WP:IFD, and it would reduce the amount of time that obscene/inflammatory images would stay on Wikipedia. -- King of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠\n\nSupport the deletion of those, but don't think we need a special criterion. G1 and G3 seem to fit the bill. -- grm_wnr Esc\n\nG1 doesn't seem to fit the bill. G3 could be applied, but if I were an admin I would feel uncomfortable applying it unless there was a precedent to do so. Maybe we should just clarify G3 to include the proposal above. --Bachrach44\n\nThere is some merit to a CSD for images which were uploaded and used only on pages deleted per CSD:A7 (i.e. vanity images). Stifle (talk)\n\nWhy is I6 restricted only to images tagged specifically with {{tl:fairuse}} or {{tl:Non-free fair use in}}? It should apply to every image tagged with a fair use tag, as every fair use tag screams \"provide a rationale\" already. TheProject\n\nSome don't. We gain nothing by everyone writing copying and pasting the same fair use rationale for every album cover used in the article about the album. -- grm_wnr Esc\n\nThe main reason is maintenance overhead. Slapping a {{Non-free fair use in}} tag on a page doesn't take any thought, other fair use tags do. I agree that it should, eventually, be migrated, but not right now. Stifle (talk)\n\nI added a section listing some types of articles that are either frequently mistakenly deleted under misapplication of CSD or frequently raised here on the talk page. I hope I roughly captured the consensus of the community in doing this, but please feel free to edit it. It's not intended to be normative, i.e., it doesn't make new rules; it just clarifies how the ones we have are to be interpreted. Deco\n\nI like this a lot. I edited the bit about non-notability somewhat. -- SCZenz\n\nIt's broadly good, but the userbox one incorrectly implied that divisive templates cannot be speedied, so I've removed that one. --Tony Sidaway\n\nNo problem, thanks for the edits. I don't want this section to be contentious. Deco\n\nThese are great, except that I don't understand how the PNG/GIF one has anything to do with speedy deletion, pro or con. · rodii ·\n\nThese images are sometimes deleted under I1. The claim is that this shouldn't be done. Deco\n\nI can't parse how it says that: \"PNGs/GIFs replaced by JPEGs: Even if an image is a photograph or other continuous-tone image, JPEG encoding discards a variety of information that could be important for further editing. These are not redundant.\" Could the wording be made clearer? · rodii ·\n\nMaybe it's too technical. The point I'm trying to make is that when you convert a PNG or GIF to JPEG format, the resulting image (although visually similar) is not the same, and so the original PNG or GIF should not be deleted because it contains information lost in the conversion process. Deco\n\nAha, now I get it. I thought it was saying that the jpeg version shouldn't be deleted, even though it discards information... which didn't make much sense. I don't think it's too technical, just a little unclear. Actually, I think your explanation clarifies the issue completely. · rodii ·\n\nWhen doing NP patrol, I frequently come across a page that looks like the following: \"John Smith is the coolest person ever. Born in 1989 in Wichita Kansas, he currently attands whatchamakalit junior high school. Everyone should respect John because he's the coolest person ever and has single handedly discovered a cure for cancer.\"\n\nNow, this is obviously a load of junk and should be deleted, but the truth is it doesn't fit the criteria for nn-bio. A7 says \"does not assert the importance or significance of its subject.\" technically, the above article does assert it's subject's importance - John Smith is the coolest person ever - if true that would be notable. I sometimes flag these pages as nonsense if the claims within the article are nonsensical, but GQ explicityl does not include \"implausible theories or hoaxes,\" which is essentially what this is. In practice I've always seen those types of articles deleted, but I think we should expand the policy to reflect what we've been doing in practice. Maybe we could add a sentence to A7 which says something like \"or whose only assertions of notability are nonsensical or entirely false\". Thoughts? --Bachrach44\n\nSuch things are, in my view at least, \"[an] addition ... made in a deliberate attempt to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia\" i.e. WP:VANDalism. Thus they may be deleted by any administrator on sight, either simply for being vandalism, or more technically CSD G3. Of course, the line betwixt vandalism and \"I've never heard of this person/thing he does\" must be judged carefully by the deleter. -Splash - tk\n\nArguably, these edits were not made in order to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia, but rather for fun. If I saw your hypothetical article, I would remove the claim that they cured cancer from the article, which is clearly false, and the claim that he's the \"coolest person ever\", which is POV, and then PROD it for non-notability. Deco\n\nIANAP, but surely the element of fun is derived from seeing if you can get such an article into the encyclopedia, knowing and intending that it's trash? It would be no fun if it weren't trash, and then it wouldn't be a speedy anyway. (NB: Hoaxes are intentional trash, too, but that's not the question here.) -Splash - tk\n\nWP:DVAIN uses the phrase \"remotely plausible assertion of notability\" (emphasis mine). I consider this a very important distinction. We don't need to consider patently absurd assertions, such as owning a cottage on Mars, in determining whether an article is an A7 speedy or not. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nI would put it this way: if after you have edited out the nonsense and POV, there is no assertion of notability left, then CSD would apply (provided the removals were obvious and noncontroversial). Deco\n\nI think I've worded a db tag like this: {{db|all claims of notability are patent nonsense (WP:CSD G1 and A7)}}. Using multiple criteria at once seems to be legitimate nowadays (for instance, see {{db-blanked}}; A1 and G7. --ais523 08:55, 30 June 2006 (UTC)\n\nHas there been any discussion relating to speedy criteria specifically for spam? I want to propose the deletion of User:Mike McCracken, but finding speedy criteria to delete a user page seems tricky. In this case, the account was only used briefly to vandalize, but the user page remains and is nothing but spam. It would be nice to have a template such as {{db-spam}}. -MrFizyx\n\nYou seem to be working under the misconception that speedy deletes are the standard way to get someting unwahted removed from Wikipedia. They are not. If you feel strongly about getting rid of that userpage, go to Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion, observing the procedural advice at the top of the page. If MfD gets overwhelmed by a torrent of userpage spam for which the discussions always, consistently, result in deletion, then we can discuss relieving it by a speedy deletion criterion. Henning Makholm\n\nOr, alternatively, speedy it, and then put it up at DRV. If the speedy is consistently sustained for a few instances of this sort of page then it's clear that consensus is for the policy that a page that is nothing but linkspam needs to go and go quickly. I think putting stuff through the full process with every expectation that it's going to go away is excessively process wonkish. And I think I have some standing to say that! Policy here is made by people doing stuff boldly and seeing what sticks and what doesn't. ++Lar: t/c\n\nSee, this is what sucks about Wikipedia. Admins can delete whatever they want while DRVs take a long, long time with an uncertain result. It'a slso more based on who actually hangs around DRV (which, naturally, is a lot of admins). Template:User admins ignoring policy survived three TFDs and two DRVs and then an admin just speedied it, where it got killed on its third DRV. So, even after five long processes, an admin just speedied it anyway, and because DRV was tired of debating it over and over again, it remained deleted. Hbdragon88\n\nOK, but we're in this instance talking about a page that is nothing but linkspam, not about a controversial userbox. It is difficult in my view to argue that we need to go through long elaborate processes to get rid of spam when the common sense right thing to do is speedy it right away. To argue for process in the face of glaringly obvious deletion is excessive process wonkery. And again, I think I have standing to say so, as I am one of the biggest process wonks here. ++Lar: t/c\n\nAn article which is nothing but linkspam is already speedy-deletable under case A3. More ambiguous cases should be sent through the xFD process. The specific example cited above should go through MFD as a violation of the user-page policy. Given the user's contribution history, you might be able to \"prod\"-delete it but speedy-deletion is inappropriate. Rossami (talk)\n\nMoved to Wikipedia talk:T1 and T2 debates.\n\nAn article that I wrote was \"speedily deleted\", and I don't agree with the reasoning. Is there a way to appeal the decision or resurrect the content? --JimBurnell\n\nCheck out Wikipedia:Undeletion policy --Bachrach44\n\nWhat is the best SD criteria/template for when a new page obviously fails WP:CORP or WP:WEB? Such as when it is just a one-line description and link to a company's website, meant to be spam. Thanks. --mtz206 (talk)\n\nI think A7, but you should really consider using {{prod}} on them. It's better than speedying because it allows more editors who might nkow more to take a look at it. --badlydrawnjeff talk\n\nActually if it's just one line and a link, in many situations A3 (No content whatsoever) would be appropriate. No one's really going to argue with speedy deleting articles like \"OfficoSupplies.com - Your office supplies choice!\" that do pop up from time to time. But as they get longer and provide more context/content, PROD is more appropriate, since there might be something salvageable. --W.marsh\n\nAdditionally, one of the standards under WP:CORP is being part of a market index. Unless the article explicitly says that the company is private, that standard can't be judged without research. The number of market indices has been proliferating like flies in recent years. This makes company articles that have content and context almost require an AFD. GRBerry\n\nThanks, all. For \"one line desc"
