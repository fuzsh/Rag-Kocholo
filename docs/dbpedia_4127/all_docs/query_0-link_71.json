The characters are a pair of identical anthropomorphic yellow-billed magpies who usually cause problems to others and for themselves with their bizarre antics. Heckle speaks in a tough New York style manner, while Jeckle has a more polite British accent. They were voiced at different times by Dayton Allen (1946–66), Sid Raymond (1947), Roy Halee (1950–1955, 1959–1961), and Frank Welker (1979).[3][4]\n\nThe Talking Magpies, released January 4, 1946, was the first Terrytoons cartoon to feature a pair of wisecracking magpies. This was a husband-and-wife pair, not the pair of identical birds that they would become. Terry was taken with the idea of a pair of identical characters, and followed up with The Uninvited Pests (November 29, 1946), which established the pair as new characters.[5] Terrytoons made 52 Heckle and Jeckle theatrical cartoons between 1946 and 1966.[6] The early cartoons paired the duo with the popular song of the time, \"Listen to the Mocking Bird\", as their theme.\n\nAfter Paul Terry sold the Terrytoons studio to CBS in 1955, the studio's cartoons were repackaged in different timeslots. In summer 1956, the premiere episode of the primetime CBS Cartoon Theater included the 1947 magpie short Flying South.[7]\n\nThe Heckle and Jeckle Cartoon Show premiered on CBS Saturday mornings on October 14, 1956, and aired until 1966. The show also included shorts starring other Terrytoons characters, including Mighty Mouse, Little Roquefort and Percy the Cat, Gandy Goose, Dinky Duck and the Terry Bears.[8]\n\nAfter a hiatus, the show moved to NBC Saturday mornings in September 1969, and aired until September 4, 1971.[7]\n\nThe New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle premiered on CBS Saturday mornings on September 8, 1979. The show featured newly-animated 11-minute magpie cartoons, in which the characters were not as abrasive as their theatrical personas. The hour-long show featured two Heckle and Jeckle cartoons. The show was cut to a half-hour for the 1980-1981 season, and featured one Heckle and Jeckle cartoon.[7]\n\nHeckle and Jeckle made a cameo in the 1988 Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures episode \"Mighty's Wedlock Whimsy\", alongside a few other Terrytoons characters, but they have no speaking lines.\n\nIn an unreleased 1999 Terrytoons pilot called Curbside, Heckle was voiced by Toby Huss and Jeckle was voiced by comedian Bobcat Goldthwait. They were also changed from magpies to crows.\n\nHeckle and Jeckle have been licensed for toys, T-shirts, puzzles, games, salt and pepper shakers, Halloween costumes, plush dolls, puppets, coloring books, cookie jars and other consumer products for decades, variously through Terrytoons, CBS Television and Viacom. Selected cartoons from the original series of 52 theatrical titles were briefly made available on VHS home video in the 1990s, but a major DVD release has yet to materialize. The characters also regularly appeared in comic books over the years, including \"Mighty Mouse\", \"Terrytoons\" and \"Paul Terry's Comics\", and even headlined a number of their own comic book titles:\n\nSt. John Publications, Heckle and Jeckle #1–24 (1951–55)\n\nPines Comics, Heckle and Jeckle #25–34 (1956–59)\n\nDell Comics, New Terrytoons #6–8 (1962)\n\nGold Key Comics, New Terrytoons #1–43; 47 (1962–77)\n\nHeckle and Jeckle were planned to have a cameo in the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\" from the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.[9]\n\nAside from the public domain VHS tapes and DVDs there were a few authorized home video releases.\n\n1978 - Magnetic Video released VHS and Betamax tapes that included Heckle & Jeckle:\n\n5 Terrytoon Cartoons Featuring Heckle & Jeckle included \"Stowaways\" along with 4 other Terrytoons.\n\n5 Terrytoon Cartoons Featuring Mighty Mouse included \"King Tut's Tomb\" along with 4 other Terrytoons.\n\n1981 - RCA Selectavision CED discs (not laserdiscs):\n\nTerrytoons Volume 1 featuring Mighty Mouse included \"Wild Life\" and \"Miami Maniacs\" along with 13 other Terrytoons.\n\n1989 - Video Treasures released VHS tapes (at LP speed):\n\nThe Best of Terrytoons included \"The Talking Magpies\" along with 5 other Terrytoons.\n\nTerrytoon Olympics included \"Gooney Golfers\" along with 5 other Terrytoons.\n\nHeckle & Jeckle vol.1 featured \"Magpie Madness\", \"Free Enterprise\", \"The Power of Thought\", \"The Stowaways\", and \"Happy Landing\".\n\nHeckle & Jeckle vol.2 featured \"The Intruders\", \"Flying South\", \"Fishing By The Sea\", \"The Super Salesmen\", \"The Hitch-Hikers\", and \"A Sleepless Night\".\n\nNo official laserdiscs, DVDs, or Blu-rays were released.\n\n1946\n\nThe Talking Magpies (prototypes) (January 4)\n\nThe Uninvited Pests (official debut) (November 29)\n\n1947\n\nMcDougal's Rest Farm (January 31)\n\nHappy Go Lucky (February 28)\n\nCat Trouble (April 11)\n\nThe Intruders (May 9)\n\nFlying South (August 15)\n\nFishing By the Sea (September 19)\n\nThe Super Salesman (October 24)\n\nThe Hitch Hikers (December 12)\n\n1948\n\nTaming the Cat (January)\n\nA Sleepless Night (June)\n\nMagpie Madness (July)\n\nOut Again in Again (November)\n\nFree Enterprise (November)\n\nGoony Golfers (December)\n\n1949\n\nThe Power of Thought (January)\n\nThe Lion Hunt (March)\n\nThe Stowaways (April)\n\nHappy Landing (June)\n\nHula Hula Land (July)\n\nDancing Shoes (November)\n\n1950\n\nThe Fox Hunt (February 17)\n\nA Merry Chase (February 21)\n\nKing Tut's Tomb (September 29)\n\nRival Romeos (November 7)\n\n1951\n\nBulldozing the Bull (March 11)\n\nThe Rainmakers (May 11)\n\nSteeple Jacks (June 27)\n\n'Sno Fun (August 22)\n\nMovie Madness (November 7)\n\n1952\n\nOff to the Opera (February 22)\n\nMoose on the Loose (June 6)\n\nHouse Busters (June 22)\n\nHair Cut-Ups (October 11)\n\nPill Peddlers (December 13)\n\n1953\n\nTen Pin Terrors (June)\n\nBargain Daze (August)\n\nLog Rollers (November)\n\n1954\n\nBlind Date (February)\n\nSatisfied Customers (May)\n\nBlue Plate Symphony (December)\n\n1956\n\nMiami Maniacs (February)\n\n1957\n\nPirate's Gold (January)\n\n1959\n\nWild Life (September)\n\n1960\n\nThousand Smile Checkup (January)\n\nMint Men\n\nTrapeze, Pleeze\n\nDeep Sea Doodle\n\nStunt Men\n\n1961\n\nSappy New Year\n\n1966"
