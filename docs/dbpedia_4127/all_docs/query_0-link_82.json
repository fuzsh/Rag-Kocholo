        "text": "No. Title Original air date 1\"Awakening in the Other Realm\"\n\n\"Kigatsukeba Isekai\" (気が付けば異世界)October 3, 2013 ( )\n\nSecluded otaku Shinichi Kanou passes a multiple choice job assessment test for the multimedia entertainment company Amutec, but he is drugged with a hot beverage during his interview with his employer Jinzaburou Matoba. When he wakes up in a bedroom inside a mansion, Shinichi meets half-elf maid Myucel Foaran and JSDF bodyguard Minori Koganuma, as he finds himself on the outskirts of Marinos, the capital city of the Holy Eldant Empire. After finding out that Matoba is a government official, Shinichi is briefed about a portal between Japan and the Holy Eldant Empire. Shinichi is tasked with spreading otaku culture to the locals. Later on, Shinichi begins teaching Myucel about the Japanese language as a token of their new friendship. Shinichi then meets Brooke Darwin, a giant blue lizardman who is the gardener. The next day, Minori escorts Shinichi to the castle in order to meet with the empress Petralka Anne Eldant III. Shinichi starts off on the wrong foot as he exclaims that Petralka is a little girl.\n\n2\"The Moe Help Desk\"\n\n\"Moeru Osewagakari\" (萌えるお世話係)October 10, 2013 ( )\n\nMinori informs Shinichi about Petralka's chancellor Zaharl and Petralka's cousin and knight captain Galius En Cordbal. After Matoba tries to defuse the situation, Shinichi rebukes Galius for saying that otaku culture might be harmful or toxic. Impressed by this, Petralka fully supports Shinichi in his endeavors. After deciding to help Myucel study the Japanese language every night, Shinichi selects various otaku culture materials during the afternoon for several days. He has Myucel and Brooke sample some of these materials. Petralka pays a visit to Shinichi and forces him to read a manga, though Petralka becomes jealous when Shinichi gives special attention to Myucel. The next day, Minori and Brooke accompany Shinichi to the city, where the local signage uses simple pictures while the children are trained as soldiers. Later on, Shinichi stops Petralka from mistreating Myucel, explaining that freedom, philanthropy and equality are the basic principles of otaku culture. Pardoning Shinichi for his apparent misconduct, Petralka requests him to teach her about the Japanese language alongside Myucel. At night, Shinichi and Myucel discuss a manga about a moe relationship between a slave girl and an overlord.\n\n3\"You are an Invader\"\n\n\"Nanji no Na wa Shinryakusha\" (汝の名は侵略者)October 17, 2013 ( )\n\nWhile a school which focuses on otaku culture is in the process of being constructed, Shinichi continues to help Petralka study the Japanese language. Petralka enjoys spending time with Shinichi until he mentions Myucel. Minori warns Shinichi that he is trying to establish an educational system that fundamentally rejects the very structure of the Holy Eldant Empire. At night, Myucel is able to have a rather stagnant conversation with Shinichi in the Japanese language. When the school finally opens, Petralka completes two kanji workbooks in an effort to impress Shinichi, but she becomes envious when he focuses more on Myucel's progress. Alessio, leader of the Patriotic Knights, suddenly captures Shinichi, Myucel, Minori and Petralka. They learn that the Patriotic Knights obtained an orb called the Exterminating Flame, which is capable of destroying the school. The Patriotic Knights are a minority anti-imperial organization with no financial or political influence. Shinichi, Myucel, Minori and Petralka collaborate to escape the clutches of the Patriotic Knights, whereas Shinichi uses a fire extinguisher to prevent Alessio from activating the Exterminating Flame. Myucel shields Petralka from being stabbed by Alessio, making Petralka extremely worried about Myucel.\n\n4\"Furry Spy\"\n\n\"Kemono na Supai\" (ケモノなスパイ)October 24, 2013 ( )\n\nOn the first day of class, Shinichi teaches the elf and dwarf students their first lesson about the Japanese language. One month later, Myucel is fully recovered after having been put on bed rest. During class, Shinichi and Minori teach about inappropriate fan service and boy's love terminology to the elf and dwarf students. Shinichi and Minori spot werewolf girl Elbia Hanaiman hiding in the bushes, though Elbia claims that she is a wandering artist. Elbia is imprisoned with possible execution after it is believed that she is a spy from the Bahairam Kingdom, an enemy of the Holy Eldant Empire. Shinichi, Myucel and Minori meet with Petralka, Galius and Zaharl at the castle. Shinichi explains that art plays a crucial role in otaku culture. Since he is denied taking custody of Elbia, Shinichi tries to prove her innocence, but his interrogations only raise more suspicions of her. After Shinichi convinces Petralka with the idea of having Elbia relay false information to the Bahairam Kingdom, Elbia is entrusted as Shinichi's personal artist.\n\nIt has been a few days since Elbia moved into the mansion. During class, Shinichi gives a lecture about the history of gal games, and he even samples one of them as an example. When he comes home, Shinichi helps Myucel with Elbia's laundry. During dinnertime, Shinichi notices that Elbia exhibits strange behavior when she confines herself in her bedroom. The next day, Shinichi and Minori stops a heated discussion between the elf and dwarf students during class. Shinichi begins to believe that Elbia might be an assassin sent to target him. At the castle, Petralka starts acting like a tsundere towards Shinichi, while Galius enjoys a boys' love manga that Minori lent him. Back at the mansion, Shinichi offers to take Myucel to Japan when he will be permitted to leave the Holy Eldant Empire. Late at night, Elbia pounces on Shinichi in his bed as his scream alerts Myucel and Minori. The confusion is cleared up when it is revealed that Elbia is in heat during a full moon.\n\nDespite an ongoing dispute between elf student Loic Slayson and dwarf student Romilda Gardo still unresolved, Petralka does not allow Myucel to teach alongside Shinichi and Minori. After a golden soccer ball is found as part of a care package shipment of otaku culture materials, Shinichi decides to organize a friendly soccer match between the elf and dwarf students, convincing Petralka to approve of this. The following week, Romilda's team scores fifty goals against Loic's team during the first half of the match through unconventional means of prowess. At lunchtime, Shinichi makes up an etiquette of removing a rice grain from onigiri left on one's cheek before eating it. When Loic's team implements magic against Romilda's team during the second half of the match, this erupts into an all-out war. As the scores are tied at ninety-nine goals, Petralka and Elbia play as substitutes in a one-on-one match, in which Petralka manages to score a goal with Myucel's assistance. The elf and dwarf students all win a handheld game console since the match ended in a draw due to collateral damage.\n\n7\"Maid in Japan\"\n\n\"Meido in Japan\" (メイド イン ジャパン)November 14, 2013 ( )\n\nShinichi is granted repatriation for one day after complaining to Matoba about some purchasing errors of certain otaku culture materials. Once he is drugged and transported back to Japan, Shinichi realizes that Myucel hid inside a second duffel bag. While accompanying Shinichi to Akihabara by train, Myucel marvels at everything she sees. They spend the whole day exploring the area full of otaku culture, and they end up eating omurice at a maid café. Back in his bedroom at home, Shinichi suddenly gets nervous around Myucel when she offers to do chores for him. While Myucel takes a bath, Shinichi goes to the convenience store late at night in order to buy a change of underwear for Myucel. He rushes back home, and she dozes off while wearing his oversized T-shirt. Meanwhile, Galius and Zaharl try to stall Petralka from seeing Shinichi, but Petralka finds out that Shinichi took a trip to Japan. The next day, Shinichi returns to the Holy Eldant Empire, though Matoba berates Shinichi for forgetting to purchase the correct otaku culture materials. Shinichi comments that his trip was not a total loss as Myucel is shown making omurice for Elbia and Brooke.\n\n8\"The Melancholy of the Supreme Ruler\"\n\n\"Kōtei Heika no Yūutsu\" (皇帝陛下の憂鬱)November 21, 2013 ( )\n\nGrowing tired of her duties as empress, Petralka absconds from the castle. Shinichi finds her inside a crate in a storage room. The next day, Petralka confines herself in her bedroom, and Shinichi believes that she is becoming a shut-in. Minori and Matoba encourage Shinichi to fix the problem by himself. Shinichi learns that Petralka's parents were killed by Galius's parents when she was a child. Upon entering Petralka's bedroom, Shinichi shows Petralka the true lifestyle of a shut-in. They even recite the Shut-ins Allegiance Pledge. As Shinichi spends the night in the castle, he helps Petralka sneak past two Eldant soldiers in order to take a bath inside the spa. Meanwhile, Myucel stirs an empty pot as she waits for Shinichi to return to the mansion, while Minori, Elbia and Brooke are left to starve. Shinichi later tells Petralka how he became a former shut-in, mentioning all the melancholy that comes with it. When Petralka wonders if she is fit to be an empress, Shinichi tells Petralka that she should just be herself. The following day, Petralka finds the courage to exit her bedroom and resume her duties.\n\n9\"The Swimsuit Apocalypse\"\n\n\"Mizugi no Mokushiroku\" (水着の黙示録)November 28, 2013 ( )\n\nIt is shown that Myucel is now a teacher at the school. Since Minori is obligated to spend her accumulated paid leave time, Galius suggests that she should spend it at the imperial estate outside the capital. Shinichi decides to take Myucel, Minori and Elbia by the lake at the imperial estate in their swimsuits. Galius and Zaharl have arranged for Petralka to visit the imperial estate in the afternoon when she is done with paperwork, but Zaharl's scholars have trouble selecting the perfect swimsuit for Petralka. While Shinichi, Myucel, Minori and Elbia enjoy some onigiri, Loic alerts them that Romilda was tased in the bushes. After it is learned that three furry creatures are lurking in the bushes, Loic looks after Romilda, while Elbia is caught in a booby trap. Myucel is eventually captured by one furry creature after she catches the other two. When Shinichi rushes to save Myucel, Minori then realizes that the furry creatures are actually three JSDF soldiers in ghillie suits secretly snapping photos of Myucel, Minori and Elbia in their swimsuits. In the afternoon, Zaharl's scholars select a one-piece swimsuit for Petralka, who is very happy to wear it.\n\n10\"Magical Girl Petralka\"\n\n\"Mahō Shōjo Petoraruka\" (魔法少女ペトラルカ)December 5, 2013 ( )\n\nAfter Myucel accidentally spills vichyssoise on Minori's clothes, Minori is forced to borrow one of Myucel's maid outfits. Matoba informs Shinichi and Minori that there is an internet leak of footage from the friendly soccer match. In order to keep the Holy Eldant Empire from being exposed to Japan, Shinichi devises a plan to produce a behind-the-scenes of a fantasy film. Minori is the director, while Petralka agrees to be cast as a magical girl. Guided by elf woman Luna to a dragon's lair, Minori agitates a red dragon by spraying on antiperspirant. Loic and Romilda are tasked with film editing after more scenes are filmed. As the last battle scene is being shot on location, the red dragon is agitated again by Minori's antiperspirant and wreaks havoc. The Eldant soldiers watch in horror as the JSDF soldiers chase away the red dragon with their artillery. Petralka kisses Shinichi on the cheek as gratitude for her leading role. During a test screening of the fantasy film, Petralka is embarrassed that her scenes turned out as bloopers. The fantasy film ends up being shelved due to plagiarism.\n\n11\"Plot Silent, Plot Deep\"\n\n\"Fukaku Shizuka ni Inbō Seyo\" (深く静かに陰謀せよ)December 12, 2013 ( )\n\nMatoba informs Shinichi that the secret of the Holy Eldant Empire remains to be preserved. Shinichi notices that Elbia has changed the art style in her sketches, while elf student Edward Theodore Pertini has translated several light novels. Shinichi realizes that there is a shortage of otaku culture materials, which had led to various arguments among the elf and dwarf students. It is revealed that Matoba truly intended to stage an invasion based on otaku culture instead of military force. Minori explains that the Holy Eldant Empire is an unexplored territory for the JSDF. As Shinichi feels guilty for spreading otaku culture, Minori warns him what the government is capable of doing to a potential whistleblower. Matoba later informs Minori that Shinichi might need to be replaced. At night, Myucel makes several plates of omurice for Shinichi. After thanking him for influencing her life with otaku culture, she begs him to stay with her. The next day, Shinichi proposes an idea to Petralka of having otaku culture materials produced in the Holy Eldant Empire, which means that they will no longer need to rely on the JSDF. However, Matoba does not look so pleased by this.\n\n12\"Shoot the Invader!\"\n\n\"Shinryakusha o Ute!\" (侵略者を撃て！)December 19, 2013 ( )"
