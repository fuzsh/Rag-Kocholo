        "text": "New rules on corporate sustainability reporting: The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n\nOn 5 January 2023, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered into force. It modernises and strengthens the rules concerning the social and environmental information that companies have to report. A broader set of large companies, as well as listed SMEs, will now be required to report on sustainability. Some non-EU companies will also have to report if they generate over EUR 150 million on the EU market.\n\nThe new rules will ensure that investors and other stakeholders have access to the information they need to assess the impact of companies on people and the environment and for investors to assess financial risks and opportunities arising from climate change and other sustainability issues. Finally, reporting costs will be reduced for companies over the medium to long term by harmonising the information to be provided.\n\nThe first companies will have to apply the new rules for the first time in the 2024 financial year, for reports published in 2025.\n\nCompanies subject to the CSRD will have to report according to European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The standards are developed in a draft form by the EFRAG, previously known as the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, an independent body bringing together various different stakeholders.\n\nThe first set of ESRS was published in the Official Journal on 22 December 2023 under the form of a delegated regulation. These standards apply to companies under the scope of the CSRD regardless of which sector they operate it. They are tailored to EU policies, while building on and contributing to international standardisation initiatives.\n\nThe CSRD also requires assurance on the sustainability information that companies report and will provide for the digital taxonomy of sustainability information."
