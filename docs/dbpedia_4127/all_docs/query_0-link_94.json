Mitchell.[6] Her father, a Vietnam War veteran, was a factory worker for General Electric, and her mother worked in a bank.[7] She described her family as \"very meat-and-potatoes, old-school Irish Catholic.\"[8] Growing up, she played baseball and rode horses. She was in Little League when she broke her leg sliding into third base. She then tried out for the school play, which was her start in acting.[9]\n\nShe graduated from Pittsfield High School in 1992 and is a member of the Massachusetts Junior Classical League.[10] She attended the University of Pennsylvania,[11] where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta Sorority and was elected to the Friars Senior Society.

Her performance is all of a piece and in harmony, stylistically, with the performances around her.\"[20] In 2005, she appeared on the series Stella, and in May 2006, she had a role in the season five finale of the NBC sitcom Scrubs as Dr. Kim Briggs, the love interest of J.D.

Banks based her character, Rachel, on Rebecca De Mornay's character in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.[27] \"It was very important to me that every line reading I gave could be interpreted two ways,\" says Banks of her role, \"So that when you go back through the movie you can see that\".[27]\n\nBanks is a frequent co-star of actor Paul Rudd, the two having appeared in five films together to date (Wet Hot American Summer, The Baxter, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Role Models, and Our Idiot Brother).[28] She is also a frequent co-star of actor Tobey Maguire, the two having also appeared in five films together (Spider-Man, Seabiscuit, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, and The Details).[29]\n\nBanks was cast as a love interest for Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) in the fourth season of the Emmy Award-winning sitcom 30 Rock.[30] Intended to appear in four episodes in 2010, Banks went on to become a recurring character with 13 appearances by the end of the fifth season, including her marriage in the episode \"Mrs. Donaghy\".
