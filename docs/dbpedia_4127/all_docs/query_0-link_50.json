        "text": "American rock band\n\nThis article is about the band. For the film starring Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson, see Red Sun Rising (film).\n\nRed Sun Rising was an American rock band from Akron, Ohio[2] that is currently on hiatus.[3] The band has released two studio albums through the Razor & Tie record label; their first, Polyester Zeal, in 2015, and their second, Thread, on March 30, 2018. The band also released an EP titled Peel on March 22, 2019.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nRed Sun Rising formed in 2006 when Mike Protich and Ryan Williams, who used to be high school classmates, struck up a conversation about music at a gas station. By 2007, Red Sun Rising's first line-up was formed and they were playing local gigs. In 2011, Tyler Valendza joined the group, bringing a new element to the group's sound.\n\nThey built a following by previewing their self-released albums over their social media websites and were touring nationally by 2013.[4] In 2014, the band signed with Razor & Tie records and released their album Polyester Zeal in August 2015 which debuted at number 11 on the Billboard Hard Rock album chart.[5] In 2015, Tyler Valendza left the band and was replaced by Dave McGarry, who was first announced as the new guitarist in a Facebook post.[6]\n\nTheir singles \"The Otherside\" and \"Emotionless\" both reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart, making them the first band since Trapt to reach number 1 twice on their first album.[citation needed] Their third single \"Amnesia\" peaked at number 6 on the same chart. The band often uses the hashtag #WeAreThread, which is said to be the name of the genre of music they would like to represent. They explain that their influences are like the threads in fabric and they feel they cannot truly be described as one particular genre.[7]\n\n\"Deathwish\" was featured in the 2018 video game Forza Horizon 4 on its in-game rock radio station Horizon XS.[8]\n\nRed Sun Rising announced an indefinite hiatus on February 28, 2020.[3] Ryan Williams went on to form New Monarch The first single \"The Fray\" was released May 28, 2021 [1]. Members Mike Protich, Dave McGarry, and Pat Gerasia formed a new band, The Violent. In 2024, drummer Pat Gerasia joined forces with Jibe vocalist Joe Grah and former Gemini Syndrome guitarist, Filter, Theory Of A Deadman bassist Charles Lee Salvaggio to form the hard rock group Inside The Trojan Horse. The video for the first single, Burn, premiered on BraveWords on August 7, 2024.\n\nBand members\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent members\n\nRyan Williams – lead guitar (2006-2020)\n\nMike Protich – lead vocals, guitar (2007–2020)\n\nDave McGarry – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2015–2020)\n\nRicky Miller – bass, backing vocals (2015–2020)\n\nPat Gerasia – drums, percussion (2015–2020)\n\nFormer members\n\nMark Jendrisak – drums (2009–2013)\n\nHayes Hornish – bass, backing vocals (2007–2011)\n\nMitch Bandel – bass, backing vocals (2011–2013)\n\nMark Matthews – bass, backing vocals (2013–2015)\n\nAdam Mercer – drums, percussion (2013–2014)\n\nTyler Valendza – rhythm guitar (2012–2015)[6]\n\nBobby Consiglio - drums, backing vocals (2007-2008)\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Peak chart positions Rock Albums\n\nHard Rock Albums\n\nHeatseekers Albums\n\nPolyester Zeal\n\nReleased: August 7, 2015\n\nLabel: Razor & Tie\n\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\n41[9] 11[10] 7[11] Thread\n\nReleased: March 30, 2018\n\nLabel: Razor & Tie\n\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\n- 21 3 \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nIndependent albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Red Sun Rising[12][13]\n\nReleased: 2010\n\nLabel: Independent\n\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\nMaking of Kings\n\nReleased: 2011\n\nLabel: Independent\n\nFormats: CD, digital download\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Fix (2012)\n\nInto Forever (2013)\n\nPeel (2019)\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak chart positions Album US\n\nAir.\n\n[14] US\n\nMain.\n\n[15] US\n\nRock\n\n[16] CAN\n\nRock\n\n[17] \"Beautiful Suicide\" 2010 — — — — Red Sun Rising \"Making of Kings\" 2011 — — — — Making of Kings \"Love is All to Blame\" 2013 — — — — Into Forever \"The Otherside\" 2015 17 1 42 20 Polyester Zeal \"Emotionless\" 2016 17 1 38 45 \"Amnesia\" 27 6 — — \"Uninvited\"\n\n(Alanis Morissette cover)[18] 2017 — — — — Non-album single \"Deathwish\" 2018 33 7 — — Thread \"Veins\" — 30 — — \"Lonely Girl\" 2019 — — — — \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (Beach Boys cover) — — — — Peel \"Stealing Life\" 2020 — — — — Thread \"—\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nPromotional Singles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak chart positions Album Rock Airplay\n\n[14] \"Push\" 2015 23 Polyester Zeal \"Unnatural\" 43 \"Fascination\" 2018 20 Thread \"Left For Dead\" 34\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Director Album \"Beautiful Suicide\" 2011 Unknown Red Sun Rising \"Making of Kings\" 2011 Making of Kings \"Love Is All to Blame\" 2013 Into Forever \"The Otherside\" 2015 Brad Golowin[19] Polyester Zeal \"Emotionless\" 2016 Dylan Marko Bell \"Amnesia\" Ryan Valdez[citation needed] \"Uninvited\" 2017 Brad Golowin Non-album single \"Deathwish\" 2018 Thread \"Fascination\" \"Veins\" \"Stealing Life\" Jason Lester \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" 2019 Brad Golowin Peel"
