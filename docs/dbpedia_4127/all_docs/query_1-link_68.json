Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.\n\nIf you’re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.\n\nFeatures\n\nCreate stand-alone Spring applications\n\nEmbed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)\n\nProvide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration\n\nAutomatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible\n\nProvide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration\n\nAbsolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration\n\nGetting Started\n\nSuper quick — try the Quickstart Guide.\n\nMore general — try Building an Application with Spring Boot\n\nMore specific — try Building a RESTful Web Service.\n\nOr search through all our guides on the Guides homepage.\n\nTalks and videos\n\nMind the Gap: Jumping from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.x\n\nDemystifying Spring Internals\n\nAhead Of Time and Native in Spring Boot 3.0\n\nImprove Your Developer Experience with Spring Boot Dev Services"
