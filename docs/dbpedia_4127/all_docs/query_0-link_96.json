        "text": "American software company\n\nICOM Simulations, Inc.[3] (later known as Rabid Entertainment) was a software company based in Wheeling, Illinois. It is best known for creating the MacVenture series of adventure games including Shadowgate.\n\nFollowing the foundation in 1981 a number of game titles for the Panasonic JR-200 were produced. Later products for the Apple Macintosh included the debugger TMON and an application launching utility called OnCue.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nICOM Simulations was formed as TMQ Software[7] on March 4, 1981, by Tod Zipnick. With the MacVenture series, ICOM pioneered the point-and-click adventure interface and later multiplatform CD-ROM development with Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. Zipnick died of Hodgkin's disease in 1991[8][9] just as the company was beginning to take off.\n\nIn the early-to-mid 1990s, ICOM Simulations was a major third-party developer for the TurboGrafx-16 (TG-16) platform in the US. They produced many games for the console, including the TG-16 exclusive Shadowgate sequel, Beyond Shadowgate.\n\nThe company was acquired in 1993 by Viacom New Media which closed its operations in 1997.[10] Renamed to Rabid Entertainment, VNM/ICOM was dismantled in 1998.\n\nThe rights to ICOM's game portfolio were held by the company Infinite Ventures, but they are now owned by David Marsh who obtained most of the rights in January 2012.[11] On March 5, 2012, Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs, both former developers at ICOM Simulations, formed a new game development company called Zojoi, LLC, and have begun releasing upgraded versions of previous ICOM Simulations titles, starting with Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective for iOS Tablets.[13]\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Release Date Credited As Published By Platform Déjà Vu: A Nightmare Comes True 19850719850710July 10, 1985 (NA)[14] ICOM Simulations Mindscape Macintosh, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, Commodore 64, NES, Game Boy Uninvited 19860319860301March 1, 1986 (NA)[15] ICOM Simulations Mindscape Macintosh, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, Commodore 64, NES Shadowgate 19870719870730July 30, 1987 (NA)[16] ICOM Simulations Mindscape Macintosh, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, Commodore 64, NES Déjà Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas 1988 ICOM Simulations Mindscape Macintosh, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, Game Boy Color Addams Family, The 1991 ICOM Simulations NEC Technologies TurboGrafx-CD Yo' Bro 1991 ICOM Simulations NEC Technologies TurboGrafx-16 Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective 1991 ICOM Simulations ICOM Simulations PC Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Vol. II 1992 ICOM Simulations ICOM Simulations PC Road Runner's Death Valley Rally 1992 ICOM Simulations Sunsoft SNES Ghost Manor 1992 ICOM Simulations Turbo Technologies Inc.
