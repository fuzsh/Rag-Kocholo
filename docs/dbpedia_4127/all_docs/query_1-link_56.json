        "text": "IMPORTANT INSULIN BENEFIT!\n\nIf you use an insulin pump that's covered under Part B's durable medical equipment benefit, or you get your covered insulin through a Medicare Advantage Plan, your cost for a month's supply of Part B-covered insulin for your pump can't be more than $35. The Part B deductible won't apply.\n\nIf you get a 3-month supply of Part B-covered insulin, your costs can't be more than $35 for each month's supply. This means you'll generally pay no more than $105 for a 3-month supply of covered insulin.\n\nIf you have Part B and Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) that pays your Part B coinsurance, your Medigap plan should cover the $35 (or less) cost for insulin."
