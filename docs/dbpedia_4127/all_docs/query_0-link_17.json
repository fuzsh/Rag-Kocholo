Since you don't like anyone touching you special code, I figure I would tell you there is a problem rather than try, and inevitably fail, to fix it.--YabbaMyIcingTalk 22:36, January 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nFixed. Klow 22:41, January 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nRobot Grunt\n\nHey can you evaluate the article? I took out the overall fiction about what the entities names are and unneeded Sven coop info. Malekron 22:39, January 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk I'll peer into it, thanks. Klow 13:32, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAlso what type of gun is it holding in the early variant? Malekron 14:49, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's irrelevant, I removed it. Klow 16:18, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHey should there be an article for the soldiers, snipers, Human Sargeant and the Goose 3 pilot or should it just be put in to a new sub section in the HECU article? Malekron 16:37, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI've been considering splitting the HECU article for a while now, but I don't really know where to start... Klow 16:38, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhy don't you start with the soldiers first. Malekron 17:05, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDon't know which one really deserves it. I guess there's the sniper, the medic and the engineer. What else? Klow 17:09, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe Human Sargeant and HECU soldiers are left and I found sound files linked to the Human Sargeant and a video of him fighting the player in what appears to be the beta Residue Processing here it is during 1:46. Malekron 19:17, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah, I forgot about this guy. Him and the weapon definitely deserve an article. I also have some screenshots of that part. Klow 00:23, January 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNewbie Questions\n\nYeah, I actually was about uploading some more pics to add to the article, editing and trying things out took me quite some time though ^^'\n\nI noticed you changed the links I added for reference to < ref > tags, should I always use them instead of the brackets [] when adding a reference link? Didn't notice anything about that on one of the help pages yet, so I figured I'd just ask\n\nAnd one more thing, I'm not quite sure about those \"cat\" fields for image categories. The help page says I should just leave them blank rather then writing anything wrong. So, now that you created a MINERVA screenshots category is it correct if I type just\n\ncat type=MINERVA Screenshots\n\nin the summary field?\n\nAnd one last thing ^^' Did I make correct use of the Gamescreenshot and Fairuse license when uploading the pic?\n\nhope I don't bother you too much with asking all these questions... C.h.a.r.l.i. 02:07, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSo! For the ref links, you should always use the reflist system. For the external links, you should also put the title of the external page with its link. I didn't do it in the MINERVA page yesterday when I changed the thing, it was just a quick fix, but I more or less added to it now. {{Cite web}} should normally be used all the time for external links, but it's long to process, so we'll use simple links for now.\n\nFor the category fields, it's not that complicated. Actually just use what you see in existing images, that would be better than a lame explanation from me. I personally copy/paste all the time from existing stuff for the whole wiki. So for further MINERVA screenshots, just copy/paste what you see in the pic you have uploaded (since I fixed it), that'll be much easier. Also you should maybe remove the HUD from your screens, since it does not have anything to do with the subject (and especially when it's not in the game's original language). \"cl_drawhud 0\" is your friend for that, and, just in case, \"impulse 200\" will hide the weapon.\n\nAnd for the license: perfect! ;-) It's just logical.\n\nOverall don't worry, we're here to help, and we always help people like you who care for and respect the project. ;-) Klow 13:50, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAlright, thanks for the answers! Didn't know you could actually edit the picture pages too, but copy & paste really makes the whole thing easy :)\n\nAbout the pic, I actually found it on flickr but I might make a new one... ;) the others I have are from the Minerva Blog and show no HUD. And I noticed you changed the source from the flickr link to a link to the wiki entry, should I do the same for the rest of the pics or put the link to the Minerva Blog entry there?\n\nGlad I got those licenses right ^^ C.h.a.r.l.i. 19:01, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAlways use the original source. Whenever you find a HL2 screenshot for example, its real source is always HL2. Klow 19:07, January 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHalf life Wikia in spanish (original)\n\n(with translated it with a translator if you can not understand Spanish)\n\nI would recommend to put (the wiki below) in minority languages through its section.\n\nTHIS!!!! Half life Wiki in Spanish\n\nPlease sign your comments. The official Spanish version already exists, and we already link to it. Please work on that wiki, or ask for a redirect. Duplicate wikis are complete nonsense to me. Klow 17:14, January 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nLolwut changes\n\nHai Klow, You seem to be lacking a bit of grammar skillz. No offense, of course. I edited a page correcting \"a HECU\" to \"an HECU\". You reverted these changes. May I remind you it's always \"an\" before an abbreviation? Merlox 23:39, January 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, I challenge you to write in French as I do in English and keep up a decent level in thousands of articles, my dear friend. I just applied the rule that an \"an\" before a word starting by H is most of the time incorrect. Klow 10:59, January 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOK. You're right that if you had it non-abbreviated as Hazardous blah blah blah, it would be \"a\".. but abbreviations kinda sound wrong without the \"an\" to me, so whatever. Btw, this is Merlox, on a non-logged-in computer. 173.75.249.10 02:27, January 10, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe rules and what sounds good to you are different things... Klow 12:13, January 10, 2010 (UTC)\n\nShitty vertigo image\n\nPls delete vertigo image I uploaded, I chose wrong one :D\n\nDone.--YabbaMyIcingTalk 02:54, January 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDon't forget to sign, ШЛЫК! Funny I recognized you by the missing \"the\" before \"wrong\". ;-) Klow 10:56, January 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nthanks for\n\nthe welcome messege ^^ thanks --Darkchao700 20:16, January 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nG-man mumble 3 to 5\n\nI just looked in to the G-man sound file and found some interesting discovers such as for G-man's 3rd mumble sounds like this \"I want to give an offering\" for the 4th mumble sounds like \"I have wondered...so helpful\" the middle part I couldn't identified as for the 5th mumble I've identified as \"My employers approve\". Originally at first it sounded with his speech \"My employers groove\". Pretty cool. Malekron 02:20, January 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nInteresting, where are these files? Are you referring to HL1 or 2? Klow 14:32, January 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHL 1 in the valve sound folder. Malekron 17:06, January 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk I'll peer into it. Klow 18:15, January 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYour user page.\n\nDon't you mean \"expect\" rather than \"except\" any mercy from us? JgcxCub 10:13, January 10, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh yeah, thanks. Klow 11:57, January 10, 2010 (UTC)\n\nUnregistered user vandalism\n\nI've never actually reported someone on this site so I'm just going to you. Unregistered user 124.82.10.17 vandalized the Arlene article, putting \"LOL\"s in a section. A different user undid his vandalism. His LOL's can be seen here. Erickos 07:24, January 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nRe: Boxing Zombies\n\nIt didn't seem particularly relevant to the topic. I'll try to avoid \"random edits\", sorry. --Bramblepath 18:38, January 14, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's relevant to the evolution to the evolution of the HL2 Zombie, and the map is an interesting easter egg from the WC mappack. Any good pre-release Zombie screenshot is worthwhile. Klow 19:17, January 14, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNeed help?\n\nI can help you create the DMC weapons articles. (PS : I'M BETTER THAN BEFORE). B-MAN 17:30, January 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDarkman would rather have them in a list in the DMC article. Feel free to refer to him! Klow 00:39, January 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nReuploading\n\nNot that I wish to offense you, but why do you re-upload most of my screenshots? B-MAN 13:34, January 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSuch as? When I reupload a screenshot, it's mostly to provide a better quality version. Klow 14:00, January 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAre some Barney lines voiced by a different actor in the leak?\n\nMy pal keeps saying that there are some Barney lines in the leak that were voiced by other actor than Mike Shapiro. He says that you told him about the case sometime ago in a steam chat. He also send me some sound files that sound obviously like Shapiro. I don't beleive that any other actor was ever considered. Could you please confirm/deny? Also if there really are some sound files voiced by another actor in the depths of the leak, could you tell which ones? — Unsigned comment by 77.93.97.180\n\nPlease sign your comments and/or register, I don't talk to anonymous robots. I don't think there's another voice actor for Barney in the leak files, but that doesn't mean it's not true. I haven't listened to every single sound file. Klow 10:22, January 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nValve game wikis\n\nPls add w:c:ricochet:Ricochet Wiki to Valve game wikis on sidebar.\n\nAlso, your are going to 60000 edits! SiPlus 13:23, January 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDamn, it's time to stop.\n\nHD Battery\n\nAgain, my message.\n\nWhy did you deleted HD battery screenshot? The skin is made by Valve! SiPlus 13:28, January 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI have no idea what you are talking about?... Klow 15:16, January 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDeleted image of high definition battery texture from Half-Life SDK. [1] SiPlus 12:43, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI remember now. This is just because you disrespected the image policy. You were even blocked a week for that. Klow 12:46, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's Valve's skin. It's not disrespecting image policy. Or all images on this wiki disrespecting image policy. SiPlus 13:34, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt was not the image itself, it's related to the information template that was missing. Klow 13:36, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk. I will add information about HD skin, but I will not upload images. SiPlus 14:32, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou can add images, just respect the policy. Klow 14:37, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThumper\n\nCongrats for your 60,000th edit!\n\nThis is the huge coding of the thumper I found in the SDK. There is no sign of the large version in this coding. — Unsigned comment by B-MAN\n\n//========= Copyright © 1996-2005, Valve Corporation, All rights reserved. ============// // // Purpose: 'weapon' what lets the player controll the rollerbuddy. // // $Revision: $ // $NoKeywords: $ //=============================================================================//\n\ninclude \"cbase.h\"\n\ninclude \"basehlcombatweapon.h\"\n\ninclude \"NPCevent.h\"\n\ninclude \"basecombatcharacter.h\"\n\ninclude \"AI_BaseNPC.h\"\n\ninclude \"player.h\"\n\ninclude \"entitylist.h\"\n\ninclude \"ndebugoverlay.h\"\n\ninclude \"soundent.h\"\n\ninclude \"engine/IEngineSound.h\"\n\ninclude \"rotorwash.h\"\n\n// memdbgon must be the last include file in a .cpp file!!!\n\ninclude \"tier0/memdbgon.h\"\n\nConVar thumpFrequency( \"thumpfrequency\", \"2\" ); ConVar thumpRadius( \"thumpradius\", \"512\" );\n\n//========================================================= //========================================================= class CPortableThumper : public CBaseAnimating { DECLARE_CLASS( CPortableThumper, CBaseAnimating ); private:\n\nvoid ThumpThink( void ); void ThumperUse( CBaseEntity *pActivator, CBaseEntity *pCaller, USE_TYPE useType, float value ); void Precache( void ); void Spawn( void );\n\nint ObjectCaps( void ) { return FCAP_IMPULSE_USE; }\n\nDECLARE_DATADESC(); };\n\nLINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS( portable_thumper, CPortableThumper );\n\nvoid CPortableThumper::Precache( void ) { PrecacheModel( \"models/fire_equipment/w_firehydrant.mdl\" ); }\n\n...too much code, see old edits...\n\nIt's portable thumper from Half-Life 2 Beta.

SiPlus 19:51, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAgain\n\nThe leak weapons coding is in the SDK, if you're interested, also there is no article about the sterilizer, there is an unused Barney sound talking about them. (I'm talking the device seen right in the begining of the chapter before surface tension.B-MAN 14:32, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSterilizer? What's that?... Klow 14:43, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSterilizer? Do you mean Stampeder? Stampeder is available only on concept art. SiPlus 19:53, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\n\"Sterilizer\" is also the name the Combine use for their Sentry Gun. But B-MAN is talking about a device for the HL1 era, and the Stampeder is a creature from the HL2 era. I checked Questionable Ethics, and I see what you mean, B-MAN. So if you are sure for the name, feel free to create an article. It's true that some BM tech devices still need more detailed articles about them... Klow 21:37, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWha? Ok.\n\nSo, you removed a comment on my talk page, and I thought for a second you are going to remove my rollback rights because I haven't been in for a while. Good to see it's not the case.\n\nI have however had to take some time off. I barely got time for the Thief wiki, and when I returned, I found myself in the crosshairs of a flame attack. I bit back, and we both were demoted form administrators. You cannot read it from here. Or here. Or this, either.\n\nBig changes may be happening for me soon that will pull my attention, so you will have to forgive me. But, I really hope that it does. Lets just say I have test for two crime fighting organizations coming up next week. Big McLargeHuge 20:33, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI removed that some time ago, because I thought it was about someone else. Someone didn't sign and I got confused. I already explained that, it's old stuff. And you don't have to justify yourself for the amount of time you can devote to a wiki, you are free to do anything you want IRL. ;-) Klow 21:28, January 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOther HECU troops\n\nHey I found out the name for the medic and soldier in Adrian's squad. The name of the soldier beside Adrian's name is Benny (from the target name) and the Medic's name is Guido (from the target name). Malekron 16:06, January 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nO RLY? Cool! Where did you find that? Klow 16:08, January 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI used the impulse 106/sv_cheats 1 at the beginning of Opfor and looked at the NPCs. Malekron 16:12, January 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh, I didn't know that thing. Klow 16:23, January 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnd did you know that in the Op4 and BS that Gordon has an entity called monster_generic and also Rosenberg (when he is doing complex actions)? Malekron 00:54, January 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nPortal on HL wiki?\n\nJust out of curiosity, why is all the stuff about Portal on the HL wiki? Doesn't it seem that Portal should have it's own wiki, or at least not have called this the Combineover wiki? I don't think the Combine is in Portal.--With care and happiness, 'Cut Off You Nose To Spider-Face450 DO IT! 23:22, January 27, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell the Combine are a concept from Half-Life 2, yet we also have HL1 stuff on here so the name doesn't prove much as a point for anything. We cover the entire HL universe on this wiki, and Portal is an integral part of it. For some examples: Portal takes place in the HL universe which that alone makes it worth covering, Aperture Science is mentioned in EP2 and will probably be a large plot point in EP3, and in-game Portal may even make reference to the Combine controlled world of HL2 and for sure makes references to Black Mesa.--YabbaMyIcingTalk 02:22, January 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's hard to find a good name that shows we cover all these games. We cannot call the wiki \"Half-Life Half-Life 2 Portal Wiki\"... Despite its name it covers the whole HL universe, and if you didn't know Portal was part of it, you might not have played Ep2 nor Portal, or didn't read much about it... Portal has some duplicate wikis on Wikia, but there's not much content and it's very poorly written/organized - so not worth it at all. If you want to contribute to a Portal wiki, the best place is right here, and we'd be glad to welcome you. Klow 10:13, January 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHL2 Beta?\n\nAny idea where I can find a working HL2 beta, that I can (somewhat) play through all the way?\n\nNo. Klow 09:13, January 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nEarly Robot Grunt Image\n\nThe location looks like its in the Black Mesa Transit System. Malekron 01:54, January 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah, or maybe a deathmatch map. Klow 01:58, January 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHey also do you have any clue of what is the type of sniper rifle held by the HECU snipers? Malekron 02:16, January 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI just know it's a brush... Klow 11:03, January 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nEdits\n\nWhy did you undo my edits this time? --Crowbar 18:13, January 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSpelling\n\nIf you go into the beta files, which i assume you have, go into bin, and there should be something called scenemanager.exe, in it click on odell. --Crowbar 16:59, January 31, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThanks for that, I'll have a look. Good find, btw. I don't know everything about the Beta and find something new almost every day! Klow 17:07, January 31, 2010 (UTC)\n\nsteam\n\nWell, me and my brother share an account, and for some unknown reason, I think it's KoopaDude. Really, don't ask me why, i have no idea. But I'm not on much. --Crowbar 00:04, February 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAdded you. Steam can be very useful to resolve misunderstandings, share date more efficiently or just break the ice. Klow 12:42, February 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBeta\n\nWould it be possible for you to tell me where you got the beta, my version is sorta corrupted... Thanks! --Crowbar 23:19, February 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI never revealed that on the wiki, and I won't, sorry... I guess overtime people have customized things, and sometimes badly, so you might have neither the Anon nor the Russian. Klow 00:17, February 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCanonicty of Black Mesa\n\nHow conjectural is the information from the mod Black Mesa? Should it be treated as correct and canon? --Bramblepath 17:51, February 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nObviously, this is everything but canon. We'll see when Valve adopts it and sells it like for TF or DoD. Klow 18:27, February 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHaha, okay. I just wanted clarification. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if Valve did start retailing it. It wouldn't be much of a credit to that fact that it was all volunteer work, though.\n\nI bet many of the BM devs will be hired by Valve, so it might be a win-win case in the end. Klow 19:27, February 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCombine's age\n\nHey is there any approximation of how old the Combine is by Marc Laidlaw? Malekron 23:49, February 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNot that I know of. Klow 01:17, February 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOperation Black Mesa\n\nOk, I'll upload the rest of the images following your style. I'm glad to see you liked them. Spockjedi 11:29, February 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's not a proper copy/paste yet, but at least it's complete! Klow 12:16, February 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nUmm what?\n\nhttp://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Mesa,_and_epic_joke.\n\nI don't think they understand what a Wiki is. --Bramblepath 19:19, February 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, do you? You gave an external link linking back to the wiki instead of an internal link (and that didn't like to the related article), and you forgot to sign to boot! :-P Klow 17:40, February 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHeh, innocent mistakes. ;) What I meant was not really getting the \"encyclopedia\" basis for wikis. --Bramblepath 19:19, February 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah I got your point. I deleted that nonsense without reading beyond the first line.\n\nOperation Black Mesa\n\nHey I've sent the OBM logo via PM on OBM forums. — Unsigned comment by Spockjedi\n\nDon't forget to sign, and thanks, I answered. Klow 00:42, February 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nRollerwand\n\nScripts/weapon_rollerwand.txt — Unsigned comment by Crowbar\n\nDon't forget to sign, and thanks, I'll have a look! Klow 00:42, February 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMr Valve and (Op4 + Blueshift) and some HL1 beta\n\nYeah Mr. Valve (including the Gearbox motion picture) was in the intro phase in previous versions, now it doesn't look like he is on it. Also I found a model linked to the Robot Grunt named rgib.mdl with the appearance of the cogwheel. Finally a soundfile linked to the Human Sargeant which features the chaingun firing, spinning up and slowing down, and apparently it could have been fired in bursts all of the sounds are in \"hassault\". Malekron 22:43, February 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah, \"hassault\" is his sound folder. I'll create his article soon, when I'm content about the best title to choose. And \"rgib.mdl\" is obviously a Robot Grunt gib. Klow 00:42, February 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nUndoing my work.\n\nWhy was my article on Toxic Waste removed? It's more than just a reoccurring theme, it's a recurring physical hazard in both HL1 & 2, a product of Black Mesa (& probably the combine) yet it doesn't get an article while the \"Xen Healing Pool\" does despite having almost no information about it. Then there's the time when you removed the game entity information for monster_vortigaunt despite it already being in the trivia section. My mere comment on the [Fast Walker] resembling [Skitch] was removed twice without reason. I'm sure there is more that was undone that is no longer viewable from my ip history. Why? — Unsigned comment by The Dias\n\nThat Fast Walker comment was misplaced (most talk pages are just a complete mess where nobody cares about structure, signing, and revive conversations dead long ago), then I decided I don't really care. And nobody can remove stuff from your IP history. For the Vort, I never read the full article (it is still to clean up), so I didn't know about that. For the toxic waste, let's keep it as a redirect for now. Don't get all worked up about this, this is just a wiki, a hobby we are doing for free and that has no real consequences on anything. And bear in mind that as a user, I also make mistakes quite often, so I apologize for any bad move from me. Many admins say \"I'm right, you're wrong\" and block you if you answer, I never do that. Klow 10:49, February 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh, ok, I was just wondering if I was doing something wrong.--The Dias 07:01, February 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nLiterary references\n\n\"Raising the Bar\" is often listed as an appearance on some articles. Would it alright to denote it as a book, to clarify that Raising the Bar isn't a game? --Bramblepath 20:32, February 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhat do you mean? Add something to the appearances? Klow 22:01, February 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI mean, where Raising the Bar is listed as an appearance, would it be okay to add (Literary appearance)? --Bramblepath 22:28, February 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat would be kinda redundant, because it's obviously literary. If one wants to know what RtB is, just click the link. We list any official source, whether it is a game or not (the other non-game appearance I can think of is ApertureScience.com). If one day Valve releases another Rtb, we'll just put its name without any other mention. Wookieepedia for instance (I copied many layout stuff from there) doesn't mention what kind of source it is, while it can be a film, a book, a game, a comic, or a TV series episode. We need to have that section as simple as possible. Any other detail should be found after clicking the link. Klow 23:17, February 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI suppose that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up --Bramblepath 23:24, February 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNo problem. At some point I thought about making a difference between appearing in RtB in a text or an image, but that just overcomplicate things. Klow 23:40, February 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHiding weapons?\n\nIs there a console command that will sheath/hide the weapon? --Bramblepath 16:03, February 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOf course, I use it like systematically. Hiding the HUD is also good. It can be achieved in GoldSrc as well as Source. See here: Help:Images#Useful console tweaks. Klow 16:21, February 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAh, okay. Thanks! --Bramblepath 16:37, February 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\n\"ai_disable\" is often very useful but I was never able to find it in GoldSrc. I don't know if it even exists. Klow 16:39, February 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI knew about the \"notarget\", however it doesn't seem to work on the HECU snipers. Does the \"ai_disable\" command disable standard \"idle\" animations? — Unsigned comment by Bramblepath\n\nYeah, some entities like \"func_turret\" (the GoldSrc tanks, the HECU Sniper, etc. even the Xen Tree) do not care about notarget. \"Ai_disable\" mostly freezes the NPC in its current animation, but as I said, it doesn't work in GoldSrc.

Klow 19:03, February 14, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSome help\n\nHi, Klow :) Tell me, please, when you corresponded with Stephen Bahl? I mean this post (thanks you for it :) There is date on 16.11.2009, but i don't know, how for a long time there was a correspondence in Facebook. I want to add that new info in Race X article in russian Wikipedia and i need reference... 95.181.12.193 10:56, February 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHey there. Here are the details: I sent him a private message on Facebook on April 5, 2009, and he answered on November 13, 2009 (I had completely forgotten about it at that point!). I asked him my questions on the same day and he answered on November 16, 2009. But the problem with private messages you cannot give them as source on Wikipedia, since the proof cannot be accessed (while here readers have to take my word for it). So do as you like! Klow 13:06, February 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSo, because i'm asked, that you left the message here :) Probably, date is not so important, just sometimes i have kinks :) Gracias! Happy Valentin's Day, i wish you Episode Three :) 95.181.12.193 14:20, February 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAh, you want to use my talk page as the source?

No, not forums... Sorry, i be on friendly terms with English, but i'm not Advisor... ) I mean... you can edit your post, don't you? Just write there the year 2009, in the post itself, somewhere... That will be known concrete year of the correspondence, not only creation date of the post. 95.181.12.193 16:09, February 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nForums? No forums? You just told me both.

So i was planning on making a wiki page. Making a page for my mod is it something i have to do by myself using the page layout template or is it something I have to contact you about in order to get access?--FunkyMonk202 04:22, February 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI responded to him. Darkman 4 05:26, February 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nFunkyMonk, we answered on your talk page. Klow 12:06, February 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnti-aliasing\n\nHow do you antialiasing images? What program you're using? Or you're antialiasing by hand? SiPlus 12:26, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI antialiasing my games with a override in my graphik card options. It's writted on the page Help:Images. Klow 12:46, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nFound it in NVIDIA Control Panel. Thanks for information. I won't upload non-antialiased images anymore. Topic is closed. SiPlus 12:58, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou won't be able to play/view models without it now. ;-) Klow 13:05, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhy I won't able to play and view models without antialiasing now? I set \"Application-controlled\" for games and \"Override any application settings\" for HLMV. Also, how do you converting text into SVG lines? I haven't found this option in Inkscape. SiPlus 13:36, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBecause you will get used to it, and love it, and realize how ugly your games were before, so there won't be no turning back for you. ;-) As for SVGs, I don't use Inkscape, so I don't know. In Illustrator, it's just left click on the text, then \"create outlines\". Klow 13:40, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk. And the last message in topic. Why do you resizing images to lower resolution? What's point? SiPlus 13:49, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMost of the time to lessen the JPG artefacts left by screenshots taken in Source. I also brighten them, crop them, and improve sharpness. Klow 13:51, February 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDr. Breen's relationship part\n\nI do my best on it.Will you go and check it out? - Bling1907\n\nUse the four \"~\" to have your signature automatically added to your messages.

SiPlus 17:55, February 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI Blocked SiPlus\n\nFor a day just to stop him. As you will see, he kept using the bot program and still does not have our auths. I know you will speak on his talk page so I will let the conversation continue there.--YabbaMyIcingTalk 07:45, February 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBlock him until he'll be at least 16 :D --ШЛЫК 07:53, February 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nLol.

User:Bling1907\n\nLeaked Content\n\nIs there anywhere that i can legally download the Leaker beta content.I know MI has it but I need it for my mod and they are unwilling to share, even if they didn't make it. which i see as kinda dumb but.--FunkyMonk202 02:38, February 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nLeak models have different versions, so you won't be able to use them in your mod anyway. Hgrunt 10:28, February 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhat do you mean? then how did the Missing Information people do it? plus i copy pasted their models into my own folder for the time being just to play around with them and they work perfectly for me.--FunkyMonk202 06:33, February 27, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMI modifies their models to work on the current version of Source or remakes them completely. True leaked models run on a very old version of the source engine that almost completely has been rendered obsolete. Only the complete playable beta has an even somewhat intact early version of the Source engine and there are no tools to modify it.--YabbaMyIcingTalk 08:15, February 27, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell actually there are tools. The Source SDK is more or less in the leak, so you can fix leak maps with the early Hammer found there, and compile them for the leak HL2, so that you don't have to convert any models and have the real intended atmosphere (so that means no over the top HDR for which these maps weren't designed), but ppl who don't have the leak won't be able to play your maps. If you want to use leak models in a mod in the current Source engine, you have to use models converted to the current Source engine. So you either do it yourself by decompiling then recompiling them, or use the existing MI models (and they include really a few of all the leak models - around 2680 models vs. 560...), or models converted by other gamers (I know there are some on the Gmod website). So in a nutshell you cannot download it legally. There is only one \"official\" version of that old Source engine, and it was given publicly only in the leak. Klow 10:25, February 27, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSo there is no possible way, even if it is the old source sdk, i mean i can take matters into my own hands and personally decompile and recompile the models, and what about the textures? because those should work for the new and old source no? if not what do i have todo to get them to work? fix the .vmt files?--FunkyMonk202 00:31, March 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nTextures sometimes work without changes, but often they need adjustment. But it's really beyond my expertise, you should ask specialized people, maybe here (just translate the website with Google for registering, then ask in the English forums). Klow 13:13, March 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAchievements Icons\n\nWhat about changing size of achievement icons in galleries to 64x64? Current 140x140 versions are blur. SiPlus 15:04, February 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI see what you mean, but unfortunately I don't think you can change the size of a specific image within a gallery. You have to change the size of all images in the gallery tag, which we won't do. Klow 15:11, February 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHVR\n\nThe Apache doesn't use the HVR model for its rockets. Darkman 4 21:44, February 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nActually it does, I checked. ;-) Klow 22:55, February 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCaptions\n\nWould you like to improve captions of my screenshots in the Borealis and Odell articles? Hgrunt 16:05, February 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah I'll soon get to it. Thanks for those. Klow 16:06, February 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\n\"Entity\" field\n\nWhy do you placing console commands in Entity infobox field? \"Entities\" and \"console commands\" words meaning different things. It will be better if there will be separated \"Entity\" and \"Console command to spawn\" fields in infobox. SiPlus 10:08, March 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI do placing them when we don't have an entity; I obviously know they are different things. I'll have DØG rename the fields. Klow 11:07, March 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nEvery object has entity. For example, scout car uses entity prop_vehicle_jeep with parameters set for jeep, but can be spawned by ch_createjeep command. SiPlus 13:01, March 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou're right, silly of me. Anyway, is the new field name good for you? Klow 13:13, March 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nGood. SiPlus 09:55, March 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nTurrets\n\nIt would be better if all the articles about HECU stationary turrets, including the one about the M198 Howitzer, were merged. I don't see the point in having a separate article about such a minor thing as the Dam Turret. Hgrunt 12:30, March 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWe tend to have separate articles on each different weapon. As long as a weapon is different, it should have its article, and the M198 is very different compared to the dam turret. This wiki is about the HL universe, so we can allow us to expand on many subjects, and avoid long, confusing lists as much as possible. In the past most turrets and sentry guns on the wiki were not properly separated, and it's much less confusing now. It's worse on other wikis like the GTA wiki, where there are create articles about anything. So we could have an article about Northern Petrol, Veikko, the first Scanner to be seen in HL2 or any other random stuff, so I guess we are not the worst in that field. Klow 13:10, March 3, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNew ASCII pic\n\nNow it's coloured and with some notes.

Thanks, dear anon. ;-) Klow 20:35, March 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou're welcome. I may have gotten the pass wrong, and there's a lot more info out there. I'm actually \"Fireman V2\", but I'm on a school computer and can't be bothered to log in. --65.100.114.216 20:42, March 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh God, not him again... :P Klow 20:59, March 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\n:/ You do recognize the significance of the surname Rattmann, correct? --Fireman V2 22:38, March 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDamn I still have a lot to do on that goddamn updates page. Klow 22:44, March 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIndeed. It's hard to update a page when there's still new information coming in all the time. — Unsigned comment by Fireman V2\n\nOh, if you thought I was pestering you to update the page, I wasn't. I was just asking if you saw the possible connection between \"Rattmann\" and \"Ratman\". --Fireman V2 00:05, March 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's ok. They may be the same person, we'll see! Klow 00:13, March 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nTrailer Articles\n\nI'm just inquiring as to whether or not we should create articles for trailers, as they do reflect on how the game was in development and such, and I know many other wikis have trailer articles. - Halo-343 17:48, March 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhy not, this could be a great addition one day. But why don't we improve what's already there first?... Klow 17:50, March 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSeems fair enough. What improving to you have in mind? - Halo-343 18:10, March 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nJust in case, don't get me wrong and don't think I want to secure a despotic hold on the addition of articles about the trailers, but what exists simply really needs improving. So now that it's clear on that end, you might be interested in the Cleanup Project, dedicated to the articles to fix. I worked hard on the Black Mesa related articles (mostly consisting of splitting, fixing, expanding and correcting the BMRF article to make way to the mod that is not close to be finished, so I guess now we should concentrate our efforts on the articles related to Portal, and have them all cleaned up for Portal 2. While all Portal related articles to be fixed are listed on the Cleanup Project page, the Aperture navigation template will give you a quicker link to them all (so then the cleanup template above them will directly tell you if the article needs to be fixed). But start by reading the Cleanup Project to see how to proceed. Thanks!

That's what a retcon is, removal of editing of continuity, therefore this retconned fact has no place in the timeline. - Halo-343 16:36, March 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHey I know what a retcon is, I was the first to bring the concept to this wiki. It's just that I added that thing in many other parts of the wiki, and removing it from there is not enough. I didn't check the changes you made to Gordon's and Kleiner's articles, but adapting the facts is not a simple task. They have to be adapted in every article they are featured. Klow 16:53, March 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, I'll get right on that, if it's okay. - Halo-343 17:02, March 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk, so first, you should search the wiki for that particular date in every article, and adapt it. And on the timeline, I'd say we keep the date, and say something like \"This day was originally Gordon Freeman's first day of work, but it was removed/retconned in HL2 and its episodes\", or smth like that. Of course, any other day would remain, the only changing is for Gordon's first day. What do you think? Klow 17:13, March 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nPerhaps we could add a section at the end of the article for date retcons such as Gordon's first day and the amount of time he spent in stasis? - Halo-343 17:23, March 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI'd rather have these facts near their related dates, for clarity.

Klow 22:44, March 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDr. Arne Magnusson retcon\n\nCould you please take a look at Talk:Half-Life and Portal universe? I've asked there why you reverted a change I made, and I gave some reasons why I did that change. Thanks! :) --CrazyTerabyte 08:30, March 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI dunno, I'm overworked here most of the time. Just too much data goes through my head. Just readd your text or smth. Klow 11:09, March 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI see you moved Retcons to a separate page, and included that text in this new page. Thanks! (feel free to delete this section from your user page, as it's already solved) --CrazyTerabyte 05:41, March 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nTalk pages are never deleted. Once it has been said, it's too late! ;-) The retcon list has been greatly expanded these last months, and had turned in ugly proseline. And after the many recent retcons, I thought they finally deserved a page. Klow 11:47, March 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHL Decay PC port\n\nIs PC port of Half-Life Decay canon? Should I use PCSX2 to take Decay screenshots? SiPlus 12:24, March 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou can take screens in the PC port. It has a few changes, but overall it's the same. Anyway we warn readers in the image category, and most screens now found around the web are from the PC port. As long as your game has antialiasing and as long as you save your screens in a decent jpg compression, it's ok. Klow 12:42, March 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAlien Controller Concept Art\n\nHey do you know any concept art of the alien controller? Malekron 00:20, March 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nUnfortunately, nothing. Otherwise it'd already be on the page, obviously. The closest is here. It might also have stemmed from this guy... Klow 08:37, March 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSource particle benchmark\n\nI think that the source particle benchmark deserves its own article. It has some info on early stages of the Episode Two development, most notably an early background image, and script files suggesting that there were two characters, Fred and Cyril, which were subsequently cut from the retail game. Hgrunt 13:37, March 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou're right. It was deleted, I restored it. Feel free to complete it, and create what needs to be. Can you? You know how I'm always overworked here. ;-) Klow 13:45, March 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe Tripmine and Overwatch Soldiers\n\nAren't they different? Malekron 21:12, March 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\n???? Klow 21:27, March 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe Combine variant and the HECU variant aren't they different? Malekron 14:30, March 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAh, that makes more sense now. Well yeah they are. Do you suggest we should have two separate articles?... Klow 14:33, March 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYes. Malekron 14:39, March 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDo it, then! Klow 14:40, March 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAbout my Suppression Device pics\n\nWell, I tried putting the licensing on the two pictures I submitted, since I forgot to put it by mistake. By the way, when I put the licensing on the picture (which is I took it myself, and by editing the image page), it weirdly changed the template saying that it has no license to blank. Can you help me with this problem? --TFGamer2120 10:14, March 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWe all take the picture ourselves, that doesn't matter, that still belongs to Valve, so it's always fair use. The process about images is explained in your policy, did you read it? It can be found at Special:Upload. If you are confused with this, just take an existing screenshot (of the Beta, so that is already sourced and categorized) and copy/paste its information on your screens. Klow 11:07, March 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI got something for you!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVbJZr668P0 Hope it will give you some infos. B-MAN 11:05, March 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSorry, nothing new... Klow 11:20, March 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh really, play attention to the beta M40A1, I don't even think it is one. It ressembles more to a G3. B-MAN 17:29, March 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAh yeah, it is different! Klow 19:38, March 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nPlus the G3 uses the SAW HUD icon at 0:26. Malekron 19:53, March 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAlien Grunt Weapons\n\nHey should there be an articles about the Alien Chainsaw and Alien Spore Launcher? Malekron 23:05, March 27, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe spore launcher and alien assault rifle made it into the hivehand, but indeed the Alien Organic Chainsaw deserves an article. Klow 00:06, March 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBlock\n\nWhy do you keep blocking me?--STANCHRISRADU 15:21, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHuh? I blocked you only once, and for a good reason, and it was long ago. So I don't get it. Klow 15:28, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI didn't know you guys are so pretentious at pictures! I enjoy 99% the pictures on a site. --STANCHRISRADU 15:29, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWe are not \"pretentious\", we are organized. Other wikis use the same system, and it works fine. Klow 15:31, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThen what was wrong with my pictures and edits? I didn't write something unreal or post any pictures which do not include the game.--STANCHRISRADU 15:33, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI blocked you in July 2009, it was long ago - I don't even remember it, I just saw it in the log. It seems you disrespected the image policy, that's all. Klow 15:37, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBut I have been blocked recently again. If it's not you, then sorry. I just posted two pictures. Taken from Raising the Bar. I thought that if I use more pictures, it will attract people. I usually look at photos. Thats all. I didnt want to ruin you work or other admins work. If you usually discuss before putting a picture on the Wiki, then I am sorry and I will ask the admins from now on. --STANCHRISRADU 15:43, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAsk the admins? Well, I am one. So it seems you are the one who uploaded the low quality concept art image of an early scanner that we already had for ages. All concept art images from Rtb have been on the wiki forever, so no need to add low quality duplicates. But you might have done it with another account, am I right? Because the \"STANCHRISRADU\" account has only been blocked once, and in July 2009. And please add your signature after your text, not before. Klow 15:52, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYes. My actual account that I am writing now is with capital letters. I thought Stanchrisradu and STANCHRISRADU are one and the same. I am sorry for the confusion. Now I understand.So theyțre different. Because I have deleted the other account. I will ask if you have any pictures before I upload some. P.S You have all RTB pictures?--STANCHRISRADU 15:58, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou never thought about having a look at our Rtb article first?... Klow 15:59, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI have watched it now. You are right. I will ask you from now on if I want to put a picture or edit something. I wanna be part of this wiki because I consider myself the #1 Half-Life Fan(I know almost everything). — Unsigned comment by STANCHRISRADU\n\nGreat! We need passionate fans, although I'm not sure I get what you mean by \"I know almost everything\". And you don't have to ask all the time about doing anything, being careful is enough. Klow 16:07, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat is cool. Oh and before I forget, I like the game so I learned almost every detail of the franchise. — Unsigned comment by STANCHRISRADU\n\nDon't forget to sign, please. Klow 16:10, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI found some pages that need help on my WikiStickies. I managed to spell-check some of them. Hope it's not a bad thing.--STANCHRISRADU 18:22, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWikiStickies are random, don't trust them. They even suggest you to put images on articles whose subject has not existent image. Klow 18:26, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnd how can I find pages to edit?--STANCHRISRADU 18:28, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe pages that really need help are here. Just read the introduction. ;-) Klow 18:39, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nGearbox\n\nHey should there be a Gearbox-related wiki? Malekron 20:11, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou sometimes have very strange questions. Klow 20:40, March 29, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou know in the side menu right under Valve-Related wikis since they done a share on Half-Life and Counter Strike right? Also should there be an infobox on Game developers? Malekron 20:14, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIf you want to created a pointless \"gearbox.wikia.com\", go ahead. As for the infobox, the current one is good enough. Btw, you ask many questions, but did you do something for the Combine tripmine?... Klow 23:19, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCleanup Project\n\nI just modified a little of Codename: Gordon and I want to look on Half-Life 2 storyline. I've seen it's marked with the baby(it means it need help, right?). I know it well so I will announce you when I'm done to see the new page and say if it's good.--STANCHRISRADU 13:56, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCool thanks. Klow 13:57, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAt Half-Life's service;).--STANCHRISRADU 13:58, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI just finished editing every chapter of the storyline. As soon as I call you again, it means I have checked it again and it can be removed from the problem-pages.--STANCHRISRADU 14:50, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYes! No more mistakes from my point of view. But to be sure it's OK, please check out the Half-Life 2 storyline.--STANCHRISRADU 14:54, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk thanks, I listed it as cleaned up, with review pending. Klow 16:28, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHi Klow! I want you you to let me to repair the storylines. Excepting Portal(I don't know it).--STANCHRISRADU 17:16, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nFix any article you want, my friend! Thanks! Klow 17:18, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnd I'm very sad for you you don't know Portal. Klow 23:21, March 30, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI know the plot, but not so good(I haven't played the entire Portal), so I can't clean it very good, like I can at the Half-Life 2 and its expansions--STANCHRISRADU 10:19, March 31, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCake WIKI????\n\nokay, I dont know if this is supposed to be happening but, i typed in \"halflife.wikia.com\" and i forgot the dash, and it brought me to the \"combine Overwiki\".... but it was totally wrong. It redirected me to \"half-life.wikia.com\", but the page was COMPLETELY different, and the grammar was TERRIBLE. I even have a screenshot of the page to prove it. Again, I don't even know if this is supposed to be happening either. Zorakirby 01:47, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYou dissin our wiki?? You'd better take this off, cuz klow can get very mentally unstable. He banned a guy for a year because once wrote 'Gorden Freeman'. Big McLargeHuge 03:39, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI love cake! :D DAWeeE1 05:17, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nFinally! I've been looking for Cake Wiki for MONTHS now and every time it brought me to something called 'Combine Overwiki'. Shadgrimgrvy 06:13, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIs this an Aprils joke. Overlord Divine 07:00, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNO Darkman 4 07:25, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nExcellent joke! Hgrunt 08:21, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThis had to happen. We have to move on. Klow 09:54, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSigh, I bet he's been planning this for months. Working like a maniac to create all those red links. And that main image is very well 'shopped. Bramblepath 10:30, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSo, this Cake Wiki is for real or a joke? It was better before.--STANCHRISRADU 16:56, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDid you know there is a real \"Cake Wiki\": http://cake.wikia.com/wiki/Cake_Wiki ASBusinessMagnet 16:55, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNice April's fools joke, now turn it back! T_T - Bling1907\n\nCheer up emo kid, woah woah woah woah, cheer up emo kid, woah woah woah woah woah\n\nThis joke sucks. Malekron 19:50, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nRofl. Ok let's go back to normal before it becomes the spam wiki. (no need to check if it exists) Be aware that now the admins will be even fiercer after that, and that even good edits will have you all blocked. (just [partially] kidding) Klow 22:38, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHave fun deleting all the random pages people made! Erickos 22:45, April 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\njoahn freemant\n\nwhere is the articles on john freeman and the one about ordon and jimm? kthxbi\n\nNew Portal 2 screenshots (concept arts?) uploaded\n\nJust FYI.

They are very expensive so I'm pretty sure you didn't pay for them. I tried to found good ones in some P2P networks but I got no luck. And yes, this comment is breaking the law, so feel free to revert it :-P --Kyano 13:53, April 2, 2010 (UTC)\n\nGo to Half-Life 2 Beta files, hl2\\resource. You will find 2 fonts inside it. SiPlus 15:41, April 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCleanup\n\nI've finished with GLaDOS, and Chell as I mentioned before. Anything else you want \"cleansed\" specifically? - Halo-343 18:14, April 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nApart from the Portal article itself, the related articles still to fix are Doug Rattmann and Aperture Science Sentry Turret. Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube has been supposedly cleaned up, but needs checking and possibly rewriting/expanding. Personality Core is clean but needs expanding. The cake itself also deserves an article, but that's for later. Klow 18:20, April 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI'll get on it. - Halo-343 18:23, April 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThanks. ;-) Klow 18:37, April 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\n\"Italics\"?\n\nYou left a message on my talk page about italics and then undid it? Why? Bramblepath 09:09, April 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh, I see. You got the wrong bloke. Nevermind, then. Bramblepath 09:13, April 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOops!\n\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1217762\n\nKnock yourself out. JgcxCub 10:14, April 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNow this is just very confusing, you best read it for yourself - Steam Forums - Official: Resonance Cascade NOT in 1998\n\nNow, seeing as the person at the bottom of the thread has an image as proof, Laidlaw definitely said this. However, knowing Marc Laidlaw, he's very attatched to his work and hates the concept of canon. What makes things more complicated is that the 1998 stuff also came straight from Valve, Gameinformer did not \"screw up\" in any way, as they probably just copy/pasted the timeline from an email from Valve, as the writer of the article said that she only wrote the introduction. So, we're in a bit of a predicament here in the wiki. I'm thinking of sending Laidlaw a formal and properly written email, explaining all these contributing factors and the explanation I told you about how the 1998 date fixes the discrepancy on how GLaDOS took control, and get full clarification. What do you think? - Halo-343 12:02, April 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDamn damn damn. Let's just shut down the wiki. Klow 14:15, April 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSo, you're saying what exactly? - Halo-343 18:19, April 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBlargh. Go ahead and email Laidlaw; if We're really lucky we'll get a set date consistent with the 200# timetable. --Fireman V2 00:03, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHey! I found this first! I get credit for it D:< JgcxCub 09:39, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIndeed. But that's not very flattering, since that makes you the one who ruined the wiki! :P Klow 09:56, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI sent an email, formal, polite and well written, and he responded in about twenty minutes. His answer didn't make any sense and he seemed kinda pissed: \"Information coming out of Aperture about Black Mesa is bound to be biased and inaccurate. It is well established in the documentary evidence that was shipped with the original Half-Life that Gordon Freeman did not go to work at Black Mesa until sometime in the noughts.\" So, yea. We have two conflicting pieces of info, with an explanation from someone Valve that makes sense, and one from Marc that doesn't makes sense. Seeing as Marc is standing his ground on any changes in his work, the only other thing to do is to get clarification about all this from someone on the Portal writing team, Eric Wolpaw preferably. - Halo-343 10:07, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMarc's answer actually kinda makes sense. He suggests a theory I had, i.e. that Aperture Science didn't really know how far was Black Mesa in their work on teleportation, even though he rather seems to be trying to vaguely fix an inconsistency brought with that updated timeline. So maybe we should read that differently: in 1998 Black Mesa finally succeeded in their teleportation research and discovered Xen. That would actually make sense. Then Gordon arrived a few years later, between 2000 and 2003. \"200-\" was always set in stone, then. Then during that decade the BME happened.\n\nSo I'll soon write again to Marc (and I pray for a more in-depth answer), and I'll ask him to explain what exactly happened in Black Mesa in 1998, and tell him how it makes sense for the lockdown and incident to happen at the same time, because because of the incident, ppl forgot to worry about the trapped Aperture employees. Because even though we interpreted this as the date of the incident, it actually can be read differently, the \"ending the outside world\" reference being just the consequences of Xen's discovery, whenever it was. Oh man, my head hurts. Klow 10:14, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat's true, but what doesn't make sense to me is, if \"information coming out of Aperture about Black Mesa is bound to be biased and inaccurate\", then why would they create the illusion that Black Mesa won the race for functioning Portal technology? - Halo-343 10:24, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, that just doesn't make sense. I bet even Valve does not really know what information from Aperture is true and what is not. Klow 11:38, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBarney Calhoon\n\nNO!!! ok. Big McLargeHuge 23:24, April 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\n\"Calhoun\". We mocked those misspellings on April 1st. Klow 08:51, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOp4 intro soundfiles\n\nShould there be articles on HQ Radio Operator, Goose 3 and 7 pilots? Also their was a file called \"w6\" any idea what that is? Malekron 22:51, April 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMagic tricks\n\nWhat sort of magic did you use to get rid of the title on the main page? I can't see __NOTITLE__ anywhere. Bramblepath 11:17, April 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI have no idea. :D It was already that way when I joined. Ask on the Wikia Central forums. Klow 13:20, April 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAh, okay. Thanks. Bramblepath 14:19, April 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNorthern Petrol\n\nHi, it seem you had blocked the page Northern Petrol, and I would like to create it. I think it's the petrol company that appears in HL2, so I fon't know why is it blocked. I would be thankful if you unblock it. Thanks. Victor.spain 21:49, April 12, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk, what do you want to put in that article? That Northern Petrol was probably a company, probably providing petrol, probably before the Seven Hour War, and that it was probably an important company?... Klow 21:53, April 12, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI only want to leave constance of it's existence, is this very dificult? Have you seen the Splineter Cell Wiki? They have articles for every truck, car, building, etc. And the The Longest Journey Wiki too. Most wikis, like Mario's one, have articles for every pixel of every world. And I think it's important in the Half-Life universe since Gordon Freeman go the the refinery in a chapter of HL2. Victor.spain 21:59, April 12, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe only way this brand could make it into the wiki would be as part of an article on the brands (fictional or not) found within the universe - so that would also include the real USSR cars from HL2 (Trabant, etc.), the fictional drinks found in Black Mesa (Yuck, Dante, etc.), the cut brands found in the HL2 Beta (Teko, T-Dog, Pepsi, Mariposa, Zaida, etc.), the weapon brands (Heckler & Koch, Glock), the other HL2 brands (Veikko, Atlantic, and the others written in Cyrillic) etc. - a thing I actually have had in mind for some time. That would make more sense, even though there is not much to say about it, apart from speculation. In a nutshell it does not deserve its own article. Klow 22:04, April 12, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhat about the article Dynamite? Is it really useful? However it exists. Or the article M44 cargo truck?. Victor.spain 22:11, April 12, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThese are used by notable factions, and sometimes by the player themself (dynamite is pivotal each time it's seen, unlike Veikko or Dante). There are not there just for scenery like all these brands. No brand, even Dr. Breen's Private Reserve, has a relevant part in the plot (even though the Private Reserve is notable within the scope of the Combine occupation). I'm not telling NP is irrelevant, I'm just saying it belongs to a broader article about all the brands, which would make it relevant. Think about an article similar to the Combine imagery or List of Earth creatures ones. If you are willing to create an exhaustive article about the brands of the HL universe, I'm with you. But I still have a lot on my plate, like correcting that damn Black Mesa Incident date, finish the BMRF article galleries, and Resistance imagery, as well as proofreading some \"fixed\" articles. And there's also the real world... Klow 22:16, April 12, 2010 (UTC)\n\nLemme start a draft here. Klow 22:30, April 12, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNaked Overwatch in EP1\n\nI don't recall seeing them anywhere. You may be confusing it with MINERVA? --Fireman V2 02:22, April 13, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNope, you really see them. Still need to make a screenshot. And you were right. ;-) Klow 08:08, April 13, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhere exactly are they, then? --Fireman V2 23:35, April 14, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThey can be seen in the Citadel, right after the moment where you see a Dropship falling. Hgrunt 11:11, April 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThanks, I didn't remember and didn't feel like checking now. Klow 11:23, April 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI saw the stripped soldiers 'wall' some months ago, however, I forgot the place. I think, the wall is in ep1_citadel_01 or ep1_citadel_02 map. SiPlus 14:46, April 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOkay, I just looked all over the EP1 Citadel, twice, and didn't see anything. :C --Fireman V2 18:22, April 17, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat's because, as everybody here noticed, our friend Fireman V2 never can look closely. ;-) Search within \"ep1_citadel_02\" for this. Klow 18:56, April 17, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, no wonder. The fog on my comp is much worse than in your screenshot. I had to use noclip and scour literally every inch of the map just to make them out! --Fireman V2 21:45, April 17, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMy screen was actually made with noclip, because it's indeed not that obvious in normal gameplay. And tbh I was told that thing not so long ago; I didn't notice that back then in July 2006 when first playing Ep 1. Klow 00:11, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah. It's interesting that they'd make something so unique, then hide it away in a corner of the map where it's almost impossible to see. --Fireman V2 00:19, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWe could almost consider it as an Easter egg. But even in HL2 they are not that obvious to see... Klow 00:23, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWait, they were in HL2? During the pod ride? --Fireman V2 02:44, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThere are NO stripped soldiers attached to memory replacement device in HL2. The model was firstly shown in RtB, and used in Ep1 for first time. The only time we can see stripped soldier in the HL2 is in Nova Prospekt on the screen.

Hgrunt 14:10, April 15, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNot a Gmod Wiki\n\nWe should push that point, a lot of people seem to think it is. --Fireman V2 02:51, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nEverybody knows that HL2 is chip-ass fake of Gmod! --ШЛЫК 10:08, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah! We all know Gabe stole everything to Garry! More seriously Fireman, did you see many Gmod-related edits recently?... Klow 10:13, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, yeah. There's been plenty of activity recently from people who want help for G-mod. I mean, look at the section above this one! --Fireman V2 19:11, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat's just one question; that does not consists of high Gmod-related activity. A G-mod question from time to time seems pretty decent for one of the most popular HL2-related mods... Klow 20:57, April 18, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI don't mean to seem whiny, but I've been seeing a lot of G-mod related activity around as of late. I just had to undo an edit from someone who thought a particular Mortar synth SNPC (of which there are quite a few, mostly crappy) was worthy of mentioning. --Fireman V2 23:50, April 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSide menu\n\nI just noticed that in the Valve-related wikis on the side menu there is a link to this wiki, which is, you know, kind of weird to have there.Erickos 04:47, April 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDunno, it's just a list of all relevant Valve-related wikis. You think we should be removed from it?... Klow 08:27, April 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, it's kind of weird to have a link to this wiki on this wiki. Erickos 20:42, April 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nFair enough! Removed. Klow 21:02, April 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAn Angering Absense\n\nWell, long story short, and rather unfortunate, given my new place in administration and the fact that we're almost finished with the Portal aspect of the cleanup project, I will not be very active in the comming weeks. I won't go into details, as they piss me off, but I'm going to be quite restricted when it comes to internet access - I'll try be on as much as I can, but just a heads-up. Sorry about this, seeing as I'm now an admin, but I'm sure you'll understand. - Halo-343 17:04, April 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's alright, I'm not done with finishing what you started anyway. ;-)\n\nGetting deleted\n\nI noticed on your page about the flaregun that there was a request box, or whatever you might call it, to add some new images in order that the page might benefit. In reference to an occasion where the flare is used which was mentioned in the article, above the combine generator in city 17, i added an image of that event. The page lacks any picture of a flare being fired... The pic was perfectly relevant, so please tell me why it was deleted with the message that i shouldnt mess with the galleries and that you in particular wouldn't like that, despite the fact adding such an image was asked for? By the way, if any of that sounds rude, it isnt meant to be... Honest. Id just like to know... regards, Mrcow 19:46, April 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt appears that you disrespected the image policy (and uploaded 3 times the same image of a rather poor quality) and messed up the gallery code. What do you want me to say to that?... Sorry if it was a good faith contribution, but in the end it all makes sense. And please start your topics on the bottom of talk pages, not top. If you feel a bit confused, feel free to request some help and directions. Klow 20:53, April 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI'm sorry, i didnt know the image policy... and about where i put this... what would the policy be in this case? (if its that simple, this is quite literally my first day) i know how i managed to upload it thrice, and it wont happen again Mrcow 21:06, April 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nActually, with all the changes Wikia recently did to the way one can add images, the image policy cannot be seen with the way you used to upload your pic (adding it through a gallery), because I simply didn't know since I never use that way, and thus didn't customize the message seen when you choose your picture (so you have a good excuse, it just isn't your fault!). It can however been seen with the other ways, such as the original way, or the \"Add picture\" button above when you edit if you have the toolbar enabled (and I guess you have). So now check our image policy, and read it thoroughly. Klow 21:13, April 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThank you :). I wasnt expecting to be treated this nicely on here. I hope next time i can get it right - when i can be sure i will, may i put the picture back on that page? Mrcow 21:22, April 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAs long as you respect the policy and don't screw up anything, you can! But users can tidy up after you if needed, as long as you show some good will. But if you are planning to reupload the same pic, I'm afraid it'll be replaced at some point, since the jpg compression is way too high. Don't use Paint, and don't even use the default screenshot shortcut. (use Fraps!) Klow 21:27, April 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThanks again. I'll make sure i dont screw up next time. I cant use fraps because i cant register it to its jpeg feature, as i dont have anything to make an online transaction with... is there anything else i can use? Mrcow 21:36, April 20, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI tend to save them as PNG in Fraps, then save as jpg with Photoshop (because to me the jpg compression of Fraps is too high), but no everyone has Photoshop. Jpg is the best format for screenshots, but a decent compression is important. Klow 13:38, April 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI undid the edit, btw. I didn't realize he had added a picture. My bad. --Fireman V2 23:37, April 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhy do you edit so much as an anon?...

Besides, there's been an incredible upturn in G-mod-related activity now, which does not bode well. --Fireman V2 22:55, April 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh, I just noticed the new message at the top of the page. --Fireman V2 23:00, April 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah, I pondered over your remark and saw that indeed too many users think their irrelevant Gmod trivia belongs here. Klow 23:02, April 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAgreed. As for the links, Hgrunt, you had to have Gmod 10 just to run them in the first place, so the only potential problem is for pirates, which is actually a good thing. --Fireman V2 23:05, April 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI don't see why we should remove those links. For instance Wookieepedia provides links to the \"Hyperspace\" section of the official Star Wars website, a section of the site only available if you pay. So if it exists and is relevant to the article, let's link to it. Removing these links would just be acting with solidarity towards the pirates, which is not our purpose. Klow 23:11, April 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMy point exactly. Speaking of pirates, did you see the new episode of Freeman's Mind? :P --Fireman V2 23:14, April 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI was asking for help on a Half Life related mod not gmod 10 User:John W.\n\nUse the four \"~\" to sign, my friend.

I enjoy reading it. I am not a contributor because I do not know much about the game other than playing it. I turn the site EB Wiki and was wondering how you make the left hand navigation menu as you please. I don't know how it works cause there's no editing guide for that menu. Also, how do you make a main categories box on your Main Page with icons, etc? It's nice and I'd like to make my wiki easier to navigate as well. Thanks so much. --Vartan.haghverdi 01:24, May 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThanks a lot! So. For the left hand menu, I can't help you, because it's a Wikia thing, and it closely works with the Monaco skin (MediaWiki:Monaco-sidebar). For the icons on the main page, just look at the code, and copy/paste it on your wiki, then just rename the files. I can't help you more than that! Good luck! Klow 08:48, May 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThank you my friend. You are very helpful. And you even allow me to use the same code format! I am very glad I told you. I do not wish to copy code without permission. Thank you Klow!

Klow 07:04, May 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe Half-Life Blue Shift Page\n\nThe entire page for Half-Life: Blue Shift was deleted entirely, can you undo it? ---BlueFlamePRG 07:18, May 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nA Wikia helper made a mistake. Klow 09:36, May 9, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThey've been cleared up now. However, I think you have the date for the events of portal wrong; I don't think Laidlaw actually contradicted them. On the aperturescience.com timeline, it says it took place \"several years after 1996\", which is consistent with 1998.\n\nI also think the facts for the events in Portal 2 are messed up. The articles all say GLaDOS was already active and activated the lift; but in the GI article, it said that Wheatly accidentally activated the lift, which flipped all the fuse switches (which Wheatly was afraid of),activating GLaDOS. --FiremanV2 21:06, May 10, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOk I guess there may have been some confusion from us there. Are you suggesting GLaDOS was turned off when Chell was woken up by Wheatley and that they woke her with these switches?... Klow 08:08, May 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYep. I also think that the GLaDOS was activated in 1998; Laidlaw didn't actually contradict that when he responded to Quentin's (your?) Email, and it coincides with the information provided on the official website. (EG, several years after 1996). Do you agree with either of these points? --65.100.114.216 19:16, May 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe reason we changed the 1998 Aperture takeover date, is to fix a plot hole while not directly contradicting established info. Basically, the GI article told that the Black Mesa incident happened a few days after GLaDOS' takeover. But if the takeover happened in 1998 instead of 200-, that leaves a plot hole: why weren't the trapped employees rescued? Why weren't the army called to breach the building and evac survivors? The BM Incident a mere few days later fixes this - aliens teleporting everywhere, nuclear winter in New Mexico, the Seven Hour War, surely world governments would be concentrating on helping millions, if not billions of people instead of a mere few hundred scientists. In addition to this, if the BM Incident happened a few days later, and Marc Laidlaw firmly states that that happened in 200-, then the takeover had to have happened in 200- as well. - Halo-343 21:21, May 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYes, but I highly doubt anyone would really notice if the facility were locked up, considering how Aperture treats it's employees. Still a good point, though. --FiremanV2 23:14, May 11, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNew P2 stuffs\n\nSteam for mac promo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh5JrzTCAHM&hd=1 That test subject quote has got to be useful for one of the articles. --FiremanV2 13:46, May 13, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's annoying, I can't find the original link to that video. Do you have it? Klow 20:45, May 13, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI have no idea where the original is, either. I got this one off of Adam Foster's blog. Wait, the video was uploaded by \"Valve.\" Does that count? --FiremanV2 21:38, May 13, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat's all I needed to know. ;) Klow 07:08, May 14, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe P2 robots are there.

Klow 13:02, May 14, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah, I noticed the robots are there too. Rather snealy of Valve, don't you think? I mean, if we hadn't sene tham already. --65.100.114.216 14:27, May 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nRewrite\n\nHey just a word, I put the rewrite up there for review and next time I would appreciate it if you let me make the edit because I was proud of that rewrite and wanted the credit for it. Thanks - S.B.44 [Talk] 22:26, May 16, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSorry, I didn't mean to take the credit for me. Next time you do it, just edit the article itself, it's not really convenient to clog up a talk page with that (the cleanup project does not say you have to save an article elsewhere to submit it for review). You could copy/paste the contents again in the page so that you'll be in the editing history (but make a few changes or it won't be seen). And thanks for your work! I could be mean and say it's your fault, but I won't. :P Your friend Halo-343 told me about you, and I'm always glad to welcome mature writers here. They are hard to find in the gaming community, and assets like you are priceless! ;) Klow 08:38, May 17, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWeighted Storage Ball\n\nWhy did you revert my edit to the Weighted Storage Ball article? 66.156.90.250 16:12, May 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBecause we don't know yet what that Portal 2 ball is. It may or may not be the same thing as in Portal. Klow 16:38, May 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThey are both weighted balls, they are both created by Aperture Science and used in testchambers, is there any reason to think that they might be different?66.156.90.250 20:39, May 19, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMany Things\n\nAre you going to include my models on the Chumtoad article?\n\nIf you allow me I would like to take several in-game screenshots for weapons and items.\n\nIf you need any more Half-Life SDK recompiled models just ask me.\n\nB-MAN 09:04, May 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI'll soon include the Chumtoad pics. Please be patient, you have seen my huge list of things to do on my page. For more pics from you, I don't know, since (and no offense) your pictures have so far always been of low quality, and someone always has to take the screenshot again. And what happened to the information template of File:Spas12 office04 hd.jpg? It's clearly stated you don't have to alter it; now it's all buggy and trimmed. And if you don't include the pics you upload in an article, it's useless, and overtime will be deleted. Thanks again for the Chum models! Klow 12:55, May 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nTo-Do List\n\nWould you mind clarifying your to-do list a bit? \"G-man crow's name\" or \"Look! It's us!\" aren't really very helpful. Also, what's \"Citadelfarnode.mdl\"? --65.100.114.216 14:50, May 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, that list is mostly for me, and I add stuff quickly before I forget, hence the lack of explanation. If you want to help me shortening it, I suggest you only choose what you understand!... Klow 15:02, May 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnd why do you almost never remove the already done stuff from your to-do list? Hgrunt 07:24, May 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nQuick note\n\nhttp://www.giantbomb.com/portal-2/61-21662/all-images/52-163134/portal_co_op_robot_2/51-1295407/ is actually speculative fan art, not concept art. I saw it before Portal 2 was announced, on facepunch. --FiremanV2 22:23, May 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWhat can I say, except that we all know that? It was made during the ARG, and the other robot was made as well. But thanks for sharing. Klow 23:14, May 21, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's still worth noting that a surprisingly accurate drawing was made, don't you think? Oh, and I was pointing it out because one of the page calls it \"Concept Art\" and uses it as a reference. --FiremanV2 17:51, May 22, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah many people think this is official stuff, unfortunately. But calling it \"concept art\" is not incorrect, it's just not official. Klow 07:59, May 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMenu problem\n\nLast month, you deleted the Category:Cut content page, but a link to it is still in the menu under \"Categories\".

Klow 07:58, May 23, 2010 (UTC)\n\nImage policy\n\nI know you don't like it when users disrespect the image policy, but a ban for 336 hours? Wouldn't three days be more reasonable? These kids are coming in, making one edit, then getting blocked for half a month. People don't really want to come back after that. Big McLargeHuge 23:25, May 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWe lose a bad editor, so what's the deal?... Klow 23:26, May 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nIt's just a kid who uploaded a picture wrong. Usually 2 week ban is for the kid who replaced 'Gordon Freeman' with 'cumlol'. Big McLargeHuge 23:29, May 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDidn't I choose one week? Anyway I lifted the ban.

There are ads on the main page! --FiremanV2 23:35, May 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nLol, I was just saying right now to Darkman on Steam that I was eagerly waiting for your comments. Yes, I did something, the wiki is now in fixed width. I'm still experimenting, but so far that looks good. And there have always been ads on the main page for those who don't use an ad blocker. But thanks for your input! (I'm not ironic) Klow 23:38, May 24, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAh. Am I really that predictable?

Still, keep on experimenting. --FiremanV2 00:03, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nShit\n\nEditing the Answer wiki's skin is a bitch; I've edited both Monaco and Common.css and nothing's changing.

Klow 08:43, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAfter posting my message below, I noticed this message, so I transfered the custom skin over to the Answers wiki. Check the Common.css history to see what I did. Basically you have to add !important to the end of each variable to force it to take effect. I also made a minor tweak to the width of the fixed-width pages to allow for everything to fit (the question, the answer, and the right sidebar). I also removed CSS that doesn't apply to the Answers wiki. Leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions.

For example if you want it to be black, use this:\n\n/* User page edit count */ #user_masthead_scorecard { font-size: 35px; color: black; }\n\nYou can find a wide range of colors here. To change the light blue background color, use this (replace with your color of choice):\n\n/* User page header background color */ #user_masthead { background-color: white; }\n\nTo make image pages full width, use this:\n\n/* Fixed width for image pages */ body.ns-6 .monaco_shrinkwrap { width:100% !important; margin-left: 0 !important; left: 0 !important; }\n\nBasically all that does is undo the fixed width code for namespace 6 (.ns-6) which is File (images). Also, since you're now using background accent images, you'll want to hide them on image pages with this:\n\n/* Hiding background accent images on image pages */ body.ns-6 #background_accent1 { display: none !important; } body.ns-6 #background_accent2 { display: none !important; }\n\nI also figured out how to hide the Pages I'm following section AND make the normal contents of the page display across the whole page, so there's not a blank area on the right side. Here's the CSS for that:\n\n/* Removing Pages I'm following section */ #profile-sidebar { display: none !important; } #profile-content-inner { margin-right: 0 !important; }\n\nAs you can see, I used CSS comments to include brief explanations of what each code does to help you guys keep track of what code affects what on the wiki. By the way, I love the new skin. It looks great on my 1680x1050 monitor. :) JoePlay<staff /> (talk) 19:34, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWow Joe thanks a lot for your time. Every code you gave me perfectly worked. (of course, you might say! :P) Just for the accent images: I'm satisfied with the way they look, so I removed them for now. Also, thanks to add comments above the codes, because it can get very confusing! And for the skin, I just added back the worn-out posters that were used a long time ago but removed since they weren't seen. Apart from that, the current skin is not very recent. And it's true that the fixed width looks much better on higher resolutions! So thanks, I like it as well. I hope most readers do too. And actually I'm a webmaster, and what you gave me kind of makes sense, but since it's very specific to Wikimedia and Wikia, it can be a bit confusing. Klow 21:09, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnother thing: is it possible to reduce the width of the table found at Special:AllMessages to fit the new wiki width?... Klow 21:12, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI tried several different things using Firebug, but could not change the width of the Allmessage table. For the image galleries for new files and categories, Wikia's HTML (not CSS) is hardcoded to display a 120 pixel wide thumbnail on those pages. example:\n\n<img width=\"120\" height=\"96\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100601085901/half-life/en/images/thumb/7/77/The_Fisherman.jpg/120px-The_Fisherman.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\nThe part at the end of the image's url (120px-The_Fisherman.jpg) can't be changed. Using CSS, I could change the width of the thumbnail, but it wouldn't scale proportionally, so the image looked weird because it was essentially being stretched sideways.\n\nSorry I couldn't be more help this time. While I have gotten pretty good at troubleshooting CSS with Firebug, I wouldn't call myself an expert, so you might want to ask on the Community Central forum. I don't think there's anything that can be done about the thumbnail size, but maybe someone in Wikia land can figure out how to force the Allmessages table to display at a narrower width. JoePlay<staff /> (talk) 16:43, June 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat's too bad... Thanks anyway! Klow 16:59, June 1, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnswers Logo\n\nOn the answers wiki, the old logo look really weird without a border. But then again, this is an obvious problem. You'll have a new logo designed by the time I'm done typing this, won't you? --FiremanV2 21:53, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI haven't seen much of the Answers wiki yet, Darkman 4 started it. Klow 21:54, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOh, I see. It still needs a new logo, having one that says \"combine Overwiki\" on \"Half-Life Answers\" doesn't really make any sense. --FiremanV2 22:02, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nTBH, don't count on me too much for that Answers wiki... Klow 22:04, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\n'Kay. Do you by any chance have a version of the Overwiki logo without the text or something? I might try making one myself. --FiremanV2 22:06, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOf course I have. It's not like I deleted the PSD for no reason. I'll do something later. Klow 07:33, May 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAdmin\n\nDone. Darkman 4 22:08, May 25, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe CSS is fucked up. You should create a Portal / Portal 2 answers. Klow 07:30, May 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nPrima Guides\n\nI discussed this long enough with my father, he is ready to buy the prima guides, they will be available to you on October 2010. But before I purchase them, what Half-Life prima guida you want me to buy : The PC version or Dreamcast version? B-MAN 17:20, May 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDreamcast? I don't think there would be much of a difference, other than the keys. --FiremanV2 19:26, May 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nPC, of course. Tell your dad he's the best. ;) Klow 23:44, May 26, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWow.. just wow\n\nWow, Klow... you either do not have a life or are a machine designed for Wikia editing. I mean, the amount of work put into here by you is amazing. Seriously, keep up the good work.-----/THE GMoD - Admin - Slipknot Wiki\\--- 17:35, May 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, I used to have a lot of time on my hands. I have less now since I resumed working irl. In the past I did a lot that a bot could have done, so my real editcount should be slightly lower. But I dunno how I can take what you just said though. Is it nice or not? And there is always worse! Klow 17:52, May 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI meant for it to be a complimant. Really, you are one of the most thorough people I met. You are exelent at what you do, I said it once and I will say it again. Keep up the good work. -----/THE GMoD - Admin - Slipknot Wiki\\--- 17:55, May 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThanks. Indeed I take this project quite seriously. I'm quite content of the achievement and I'm glad that now that I won't have as much time as before what's done so far is satisfying enough to calm down on the edits. Klow 17:58, May 28, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYour welcome, yeah I can not see really any way to improve the site. The way I see it the only real thing left to do is wait for Portal 2 and such to come out and then you will have some real new content. What "
