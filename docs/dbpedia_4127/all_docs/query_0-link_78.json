        "text": "Japanese rock band\n\nColdrain (stylized in all lowercase) are a Japanese rock band from Nagoya, Japan, who were formed in 2007. The band combines melodic singing with screams typical of the post-hardcore genre.[1] Although the band is Japanese, all of their songs are written in English. Since its formation in 2007, the band retained the same lineup with no member changes. The lineup consists of lead vocalist Masato Hayakawa, guitarists Ryo Yokochi (Y.K.C.) and Kazuya Sugiyama (Sugi), bassist Ryo Shimizu (RxYxO) and drummer Katsuma Minatani. Hayakawa has a Japanese father and an American mother and speaks both Japanese and English fluently.[2][3]\n\nThe band's first two albums, Final Destination and The Enemy Inside, were both released exclusively in their home country of Japan. The group made their worldwide debut in 2014 with the reissue of The Revelation, which was previously released in 2013 under the label VAP, with the worldwide edition being released under Hopeless Records and Sony Music.\n\nColdrain later released Vena (2015), Fateless (2017) and The Side Effects (2019). Their seventh studio album Nonnegative was released on July 6, 2022. They are best known for their songs \"Mayday\", \"Gone\", \"Coexist\", \"Paradise (Kill the Silence)\", \"Die Tomorrow\", \"No Escape\", \"The Revelation\", \"Envy\" and \"Feed the Fire\".\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2007–2008: Formation and major label debut\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the disbanding of the bands Wheel of Life (RxYxO, Sugi and Y.K.C.) and AVER (Masato and Katsuma),[4] Coldrain was formed on April 17, 2007, in Nagoya with Masato Hayakawa on vocals, RxYxO (Ryo) on bass guitar, Katsuma on drums, and Y.K.C (Yokochi) and Sugi on guitars. The common musical interest of the members was one of the decisive factors in the formation of coldrain. Once, when AVER and Wheel of Life first co-debuted on stage, and AVER heard Sevendust's song played during Wheel of Life's rehearsal, an excited Katsuma asked RxYxO, \"Don't tell me you're a fan of Sevendust as well!?\"[5] Thereafter, each time they interacted, they wanted to form a new band together. RxYxO was originally doing vocals, but became a bassist because of coldrain.[5] The band gained their first followers from performing as a local band in their home-town while distributing demo discs after each performance.\n\nAbout a year after coldrain formed, they signed a major contract with VAP,[6] and the band released their debut maxi single \"Fiction\" on 5 November 2008. They then set off for their first nationwide tour and played in 30 venues across Japan.\n\n2009–2011: Final Destination and The Enemy Inside\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Final Destination and The Enemy Inside\n\nAfter the tour, the group released their next maxi single: 8AM. The limited edition included a DVD which featured the music video of the title song and three live videos: \"Fiction\", \"Painting\", and \"Come Awake\". \"8AM\" was also used as a theme song to the anime series Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger.[7] In 2009, saw their first performance at the Summer Sonic Festival 2009.[8] In October, they released their first album Final Destination[9] and embarked on another successful sold-out nationwide tour.\n\nThe band released their debut EP: Nothing Lasts Forever on 23 June 2010. One of the songs, \"We're Not Alone\", was used as an opening theme of the anime series Rainbow: Nisha Rokubō no Shichinin.[10] Another song, \"Die Tomorrow\", was used in the Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 soundtrack.[9] They also went on tour with several bands, including Mucc, Avengers in sci-fi and Totalfat.[11]\n\nOn 16 February 2011, Coldrain released their second album called The Enemy Inside, which keeps the melodic vocals and breakdown parts of the last songs. The song \"The Maze\" has Mah from band SiM singing in some parts. On 7 December of the same year, the band released their first DVD, Three Days of Adrenaline,[12] which was recorded in three cities: Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo. The DVD contains 19 tracks (all 10 songs from The Enemy Inside are included), 3 behind-the-scenes videos, exclusive performances, and the music videos of \"To Be Alive\" and \"Rescue Me\".[13]\n\n2012–2013: The Revelation\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Revelation\n\nOn 20 April 2012, the band released a new song, \"No Escape\",[14] which was used in the official trailer for the video game Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City;[15][16] the song was on the band's new EP, Through Clarity, released on the following 4 July.[17] This is their first album recorded abroad in the US.[18] The EP was produced by David Bendeth,[6] famous for his collaborations with international artists like Paramore, All Time Low and A Day to Remember.[19]\n\nOn 1 August, it was announced that because drummer Katsuma was devoting himself to medical treatment for a chronic hereditary disease, he was temporarily withdrawing from the band. Katsuma's withdrawal period includes three people, ZAX (Pay Money to My Pain), Tatsu (Crossfaith), and YOUTH-K!!!(BPM13GROOVE), playing the role of support drummer.[20] During the summer, they finally returned to the stage at Summer Sonic Festival 2012.[21] On 4 November, at Hiroshima University of Economics, two bands held a live performance, Maximum the Hormone and Coldrain. At that point Katsuma returned to the band.[22][23]\n\nOn 30 November, coldrain announced they would be in the studio from December to February to record their third studio album with David Bendeth.[24][25] On 2 March 2013, they performed at Megaport Music Festival in Kaohsiung for 5,000 people, along with many other artists such as Grizzly Bear, Cyndi Wang, Boris, Head Phones President, SiM, LTK Commune, Guntzepaula and Chochukmo.[26][27] Shortly afterward, on 17 April, they released their third full-length album, The Revelation.[28][29] On 5 May, the band held the opening date of The Revelation Tour in Chiba, Japan, at the same location where they performed during Ozzfest on 12 May.[30]\n\n2014: Worldwide debut\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2013, Coldrain signed a record deal with Raw Power Management, a British company with many international bands to its name, including Bullet for My Valentine, Bring Me the Horizon, Of Mice & Men and Crossfaith. This allowed the group to go on a European tour with Bullet for My Valentine and Chiodos between February and March.[31] Subsequent headline dates were also announced for the United Kingdom, along with the European release of the EP Through Clarity on 27 January, with free download of the song \"Inside of Me\" if the EP was preordered.[31]\n\nOn 21 February, they announced release of the DVD The Score 2007-2013.[32] On 18 January they recorded a live show called \"One Man Show Evolve\" for their second DVD, Evolve,[33] which was released on 30 April of the same year.[34] The album was also available on Blu-ray Disc, for the first time for the group.[35] During the same period came the news that coldrain would be performing at Rock am Ring, Rock im Park and Download Festival 2014[36] in June 2014.\n\nOn 9 April, the announcement came that coldrain had signed a contract with the American-based label Hopeless Records for a new edition of their third studio album, The Revelation, which would be released worldwide (except Asia, New Zealand, and Australia) for the first time.[37] On the same day Hopeless released the eponymous single, \"The Revelation\".[37]\n\nAt the announcement of the international release of The Revelation, the singer Masato Hayakawa wrote:\n\n\"It's hard to put in words how excited and proud we are that The Revelation will be released Worldwide. The dream we've had ever since we started playing music is finally coming true. I can't wait for everyone to hear the songs, learn the words and sing them with us live. We are grateful for the many fans in our homeland that have supported us in becoming the band we are today. Without them this would have been impossible. This step will be the biggest in our careers and we couldn't be more ready.\"[38]\n\nThe international edition of the album was subsequently released on 23 June in Europe, and 24 June in North America.[38] On 18 June they also released their third EP, Until the End in Japan.[39][40] The EP contains 6 new tracks, 5 of which were also included in the international edition of The Revelation, which was released by Hopeless Records in June 2014 in Europe and North America.

Another song called \"Mayday\", featuring Ryo Kinoshita from Crystal Lake, was also used as the opening theme for the anime Fire Force.[83] This would also get a music video on November 2, coinciding with the debut of the song as Fire Force's intro theme, also being the last single released by the band in the 2010s.[84]\n\nIn the same month, Coldrain would later announce that their own annually hosted concert \"BLAREDOWN BARRIERS\" would be turned into a festival and renamed to \"Blare Fest\". Blare Fest would take place at Port Messe in Nagoya. The 2020 edition of the newly formed festival would announce bands such as One Ok Rock, We Came as Romans, Fever 333, The Word Alive, Volumes, Crossfaith and Crystal Lake, as well as many more, who would all play on two separate days with Coldrain headlining both days on February 1 and 2.[85]\n\nThe band would release two new music videos for The Side Effects: \"See You\" on January 17, 2020, and \"Speak\" on March 21, 2020.[86][87]\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Coldrain was forced to cancel or postpone many gigs. As a result, they released all three of their live DVDs on YouTube for free for a limited amount of time to help entertain their fans during lockdown, including Three Days of Adrenaline, Evolve and 20180206 Live at Budokan, along with the music video for \"Speak\".[88] A notable gig that got cancelled was their highly anticipated performance at the Yokohama Arena in Yokohama, which was scheduled for October 18, 2020 that was later cancelled on September 4.[89][90]\n\nIn regards to the performance at the Yokohama Arena, a venue of a capacity of 17,000, frontman Masato Hayakawa issued a statement:\n\n\"Blarefest back in February, which hosted and announced the international acts.\n\nIn June, I had no choice but to announce the postponement of the tour in a hope that self-exclusion would begin and converge. We'll be able to make it to the rocks by October, can't we?! I was thinking that it's all the same that I was expecting. However, the reality is that we can't get together as the first member after we put together Coldrain, the time when we can't play live blows, we can't perform even if we want to perform, we can't see any breakthroughs, and it's time to make this announcement. Now that various forms have been explored and the number of festivals and artists holding festivals and artists has increased by reducing the number of people, it may appear that it is possible to hold them somehow. But the final conclusion is that by the standards of Coldrain, we still can't see the \"new shape\" and we still have to endure it as a live band. However, I don't feel like I can see Coldrain live when social distancing comes in to think about how many people can be packed into the arena by attacking the last minute, and sticking to how close I can get to the audience. I was troubled. But there is no hesitation. Because the situation is a situation, we have to use the word cancellation instead of postponing it, but what we can promise now is that we will definitely do it someday. Without the risk or anxiety caused by the corona, let's endure it until it is in a state where we can help each other like that time, go on a rampage, scream from the bottom of our stomachs, and go home. Let's make a happy live performance as much as you can endure.\n\nUntil then, I pray for everyone's health and dream of being able to welcome Coldrain's Yokohama Arena performance in perfect condition. I'm not going to waste 10/18, and I'm trying to take on challenges that I've never done as a band that I can't see everyone live.\n\nI'm just enduring it now, I'm not going to die! Regards from now on!\"[90]\n\nFurthermore, it was simultaneously announced on the same day that the band would announce a new live video album Live & Backstage at Blare Fest. 2020 that would slated for release on October 28, 2020.[91] It would feature their full performance on both days, as well as backstage footage of the band. To promote it, they released live performances of \"Revolution\" and \"Final Destination\" at Blarefest on the band's official YouTube channel.[92][93]\n\nThe band would hold live events in the new year again amidst COVID-19 cases drastically dropping in Japan. They would go on a nationwide tour of Japan for their \"Setlist Election\" in which fans would vote for which songs will be performed on each day.

The previously released single \"Paradise (Kill the Silence)\" was revealed alongside a lineup of ten new original songs and a cover of No Doubt's \"Don't Speak\" to be included on the album.[111] After the stream concluded and the clocks hit 00:00JST on 17 April in Japan, the band released the second single \"Calling\" from the album alongside a music video to commemorate their fifteen years together as a band.[112][113]\n\nOn 4 June, the band were revealed to have provided a preview for one of the new songs from the album, \"From Today\", for the TV advert promoting the Aquos X LED 30.[114] A couple of days later on 6 June, the band previewed the new single \"Before I Go\" as a part of the promotional campaign for the Sapporo Breweries product, Sapporo Beer Gold Star.[115] They then fully released the song with an accompanying music video on 8 June.[116][117] On 15 June, another song from the album, \"Bloody Power Fame\", was previewed in the new trailer as the opening theme for the Netflix anime, Bastard!![118][119] The song was later released as a single on 30 June alongside the release of the anime.[120][121] On 6 July, the band released the fifth single, \"Cut Me\", alongside an accompanying music video concurrently with the album's release.[122]\n\nOn 5 September, the band appeared and performed at \"Treasure9x4\". During the performance, they announced the second edition of Blare Fest that was scheduled to take place on 4 & 5 February 2023.[123] They later announced bands such as Hoobastank, Wargasm, Don Broco, Crystal Lake and SiM would be performing at the event as well as many others.[124] On 15 January 2023, it was announced that the band would be supporting Papa Roach and The Used on their co-headline \"Cut My Heart Into Pieces\" Australian tour in April 2023, starting in Perth, Australia on 21 April and ending on 30 April in Brisbane, with that being the only show that the band would unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts.[125][126][127] On 2 February, the band announced their fifth live video album, 15x(5+U) Live at Yokohama Arena, initially scheduled to be released on 19 April 2023. It was however later postponed due to the band being unable to require the licensing rights to include \"Don't Speak\" in the release, the edit in content caused the album to be delayed to 17 May.[128] A live music video for \"Calling\" recorded at the arena was released alongside the initial announcement.[129]\n\nOn 30 May, it was announced that Bastard! would be renewed for a second season that would start airing on 31 July 2023. Alongside this announcement, it was revealed that the band would retain their status as the opening theme with a new song titled \"New Dawn\" that was made available as a single on 2 August.[130][131]\n\nIn January 2024, it was reported that the band would be releasing a new unspecified song as the opening theme for Adult Swim's anime Ninja Kamui.[132][133] \"Vengeance\" was released as a single accompanied by a music video on 11 February 2024, concurrent with the release of Ninja Kamui.[134] The band initially released it alongside the fifteenth anniversary recording of Final Destination as an exclusive CD at the band's homecoming performance in Nagoya on 10 February, where they debuted \"Vengeance\" live for the first time.[135] Due to high fan demand, the fifteenth anniversary re-recording of Final Destination titled Final Destination (XV Re:Recorded) was released digitally on 26 May 2024.[136][137]\n\nArtistry\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band's musical style has been described as post-hardcore,[138][1][139] metalcore,[139][140][141] alternative metal,[142][143] alternative rock,[139][144][145][146][143] punk rock,[147][148] screamo,[140][143] hard rock,[149][150][151][152] nu metal,[153][154] and electronic rock.[155]\n\nEarly in its career the band played songs that sounded like alternative rock and especially like post-hardcore,[1][156] accompanied by guitar pieces reminiscent of classic metalcore[140] and thrash metal riffs. By their third album, The Revelation, coldrain's music came to be defined as a mix of post-hardcore and metalcore.[156] According to other critics, certain influences instead recall genres like pop punk and screamo,[140] and the band has been likened to groups like My Chemical Romance, Pay Money to My Pain,[1] Asking Alexandria, Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows, Bullet for My Valentine[140] and A Day to Remember. Masato Hayakawa himself has stated Linkin Park and Incubus to be his biggest influences to start recording music.[157] When Y.K.C, the main composer of the band, was asked about songwriting, he said, \"It is essential not to forget 'why a song is cool', the song itself needs to have holding power, and only then is there meaning. That's what I try not to forget when composing.\"[158]\n\nBand members\n\n[edit]\n\nMasato David Hayakawa (マサト, Masato) – lead vocals\n\nRyo Yokochi (ヨコチ, Y.K.C.) – lead guitar, programming, piano,
