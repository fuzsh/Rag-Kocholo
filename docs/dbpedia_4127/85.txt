Uninvited is a haunted house "point-and-click" adventure video game originally for the Macintosh, released in 1986 by ICOM Simulations. The unnamed hero must find the way through an abandoned house in order to rescue a sibling. The quest involves magic and solving logical puzzles while discovering sinister secrets of the house's former inhabitants.

The game uses the MacVenture engine that was introduced in ICOM's previous game, Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True. It is notable as the only MacVenture that takes place in the present day.
