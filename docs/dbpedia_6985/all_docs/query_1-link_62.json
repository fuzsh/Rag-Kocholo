        "text": "The night the sky shone red, green and purple\n\nOn the night of 2024 May 10/11 observers all over the UK and beyond marvelled at a glorious display of the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights.\n\nA giant Coronal Mass Ejection from the Sun arrived at the Earth mid-afternoon, which disturbed the Earth’s magnetic field and channeled high energy particles down towards the magnetic poles. When these particles excite atoms and molecules of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen the striking colours become apparent.\n\nPhotographs taken show vivid colours but to the naked eye observer sometimes the colours were not so obvious.\n\nBAA members from the north of Scotland, to the south of England, and in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Canada captured this event thought to be the biggest display since 2003.\n\nHere are a few shots taken by members and below you can browse a gallery of images,\n\nHere is a gallery of images by BAA members:"
