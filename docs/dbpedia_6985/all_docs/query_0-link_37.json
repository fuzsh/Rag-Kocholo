        "text": "Copper beech, also known as purple beech, is a cultivated form of common beech (although copper-coloured beech trees are also sometimes found in nature). It grows to a height of more than 40m. The bark is smooth, thin and grey, often with slight horizontal etchings. Twigs are slender and grey but not straight – their shape resembles a zig-zag. Torpedo-shaped leaf buds are coppery and up to 2cm in length, with a distinctive criss-cross pattern.\n\nLook out for: the red to purple leaves which mark a clear difference in comparison to common beech.\n\nIdentified in winter by: its sharply pointed buds, a feature it shares with common beech.\n\nWhere to find copper beech\n\nCopper beech doesn’t occur naturally, but is planted in urban and rural areas across the UK as an ornamental tree for its distinctive purple leaves.\n\nIt has several habitat requirements, including a humid atmosphere and well-drained soil. It prefers fertile, calcified or lightly acidic ground and is often found on the side of hills.\n\nUses of copper beech\n\nCopper beech is a popular horticultural plant, especially when planted as large specimen trees, but it is not loved by all. The 20th century gardener Russell Page said in his book The Education of a Gardener “Nothing destroys the harmony of a garden more than the dark blotch of a copper beech”.\n\nIt makes a good hedging plant, especially since it can be cut back hard. If clipped it doesn't shed its leaves, and provides a year-round, dense screen which is a great habitat for garden birds.\n\nLike common beech, copper beech timber can be used for a variety of purposes, including fuel, furniture, cooking utensils, tool handles and sports equipment. The wood burns well and was traditionally used to smoke herring. The edible nuts, or masts, were once used to feed pigs, and in France they are still sometimes roasted and used as a coffee substitute."
