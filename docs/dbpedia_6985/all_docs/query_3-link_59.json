        "text": "Purple yams, or ube, are nutritious, versatile, and starchy root vegetables. They are loaded with antioxidants that may help reduce blood pressure and blood sugar levels.\n\nDioscorea alata is a species of yam commonly referred to as purple yam, ube, violet yam, or water yam.\n\nThis tuberous root vegetable originates from Southeast Asia and is often confused with taro root. An indigenous staple of the Philippines, it’s now cultivated and enjoyed worldwide.\n\nPurple yams have greyish-brown skins and purple flesh, and their texture becomes soft like a potato when cooked.\n\nThey have a sweet, nutty flavor and are used in a variety of dishes ranging from sweet to savory.\n\nWhat’s more, they are loaded with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, all of which may benefit your health.\n\nHere are 7 surprising health benefits of purple yam.\n\n1. Highly nutritious\n\nThe purple yam (ube) is a starchy root vegetable that’s a great source of carbs, potassium, and vitamin C.\n\nOne cup (100 grams) of cooked ube provides the following (1):\n\nCalories: 140\n\nCarbs: 27 grams\n\nProtein: 1 gram\n\nFat: 0.1 grams\n\nFiber: 4 grams\n\nSodium: 0.83% of the\n\nDaily Value (DV)\n\nPotassium: 13.5% of the DV\n\nCalcium: 2% of the DV\n\nIron: 4% of the DV\n\nVitamin C: 40% of the DV\n\nVitamin A: 4% of the DV\n\nIn addition, they are rich in powerful plant compounds and antioxidants, including anthocyanins, which give them their vibrant hue.\n\nStudies have shown that anthocyanins may help reduce blood pressure and inflammation and protect against cancer and type 2 diabetes (2, 3, 4)\n\nWhat’s more, purple yams are rich in vitamin C, which helps keep your cells healthy, boosts iron absorption, and protects your DNA from damage (5).\n\nSummary Purple yams are starchy\n\nroot vegetables that are rich in carbs, potassium, vitamin C, and\n\nphytonutrients, all of which are important for maintaining good health.\n\n2. Rich in antioxidants\n\nPurple yams are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins and vitamin C.\n\nAntioxidants help protect your cells from damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals (6).\n\nFree radical damage is linked to many chronic conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders (7).\n\nPurple yams are a great source of vitamin C, which acts as a potent antioxidant in your body.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that consuming more vitamin C can increase your antioxidant levels by up to 35%, protecting against oxidative cell damage (8, 9, 10).\n\nThe anthocyanins in purple yams are also a type of polyphenol antioxidant.\n\nRegularly eating polyphenol-rich fruits and vegetables has been linked to lower risks of several types of cancers (11, 12, 13).\n\nPromising research suggests that two anthocyanins in purple yams — cyanidin and peonidin — may reduce the growth of certain types of cancers, including:\n\nColon cancer. One study showed\n\nup to a 45% reduction in tumors in animals treated with dietary cyanidin,\n\nwhile another test-tube study found that it slowed the growth of human\n\ncancer cells (14, 15).\n\nLung cancer. A test-tube\n\nstudy observed that peonidin slowed the growth of lung cancer cells (16).\n\nProstate cancer.\n\nAnother\n\ntest-tube study noted that cyanidin reduced the number of human prostate\n\ncancer cells (17).\n\nThat said, these studies used concentrated amounts of cyanidin and peonidin. Thus, it’s unlikely that you would reap the same benefits from eating whole purple yams.\n\nSummary Purple\n\nyams are a great source of anthocyanins and vitamin C, both of which are\n\npowerful antioxidants. They have been shown to protect against cell damage and\n\ncancer.\n\n3. May help manage blood sugar\n\nThe flavonoids in purple yams have been shown to help lower blood sugar in those with type 2 diabetes.\n\nObesity and inflammation caused by oxidative stress increase your risk of insulin resistance, poor blood sugar control, and type 2 diabetes (18).\n\nInsulin resistance is when your cells don’t respond properly to the hormone insulin, which is responsible for maintaining your blood sugar control.\n\nOne test-tube study observed that flavonoid-rich purple yam extracts reduced oxidative stress and insulin resistance by protecting insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (19).\n\nIn addition, a study in 20 rats found that administering them higher amounts of purple yam extract lowered appetite, encouraged weight loss, and improved blood sugar control (20).\n\nFinally, another study reported that a purple yam supplement reduced the rate of blood sugar absorption in rats with elevated levels, resulting in improved blood sugar control (21).\n\nThis is likely due in part to purple yams’ low glycemic index (GI). The GI, which ranges from 0–100, is a measure of how fast sugars are absorbed into your bloodstream.\n\nPurple yams have a GI of 24, meaning that carbs are broken down into sugars slowly, resulting in a steady release of energy instead of a blood sugar spike (22).\n\nSummary The flavonoids in purple yams may help promote\n\nblood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Also, purple yams have a\n\nlow glycemic index, which can help prevent blood sugar spikes.\n\n4. May help lower blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes (23, 24).\n\nPurple yams may have blood-pressure-lowering effects. Researchers believe this is likely due to their impressive antioxidant content (25).\n\nA test-tube study found that purple yams contain antioxidants that may help lower blood pressure in a way similar to that of common blood-pressure-lowering medications called angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) (26).\n\nAnother test-tube study showed that the antioxidants in purple yams could prevent the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2, a compound responsible for elevated blood pressure (26).\n\nWhile these results are promising, they were obtained in a lab. More human research is needed before concluding whether eating purple yams can lower your blood pressure.\n\nSummary Lab research has\n\ndemonstrated the impressive blood-pressure-lowering effects of antioxidant-rich\n\npurple yam extracts. Still, more human studies are needed.\n\n5. May improve symptoms of asthma\n\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways.\n\nResearch suggests that a high dietary intake of antioxidants like vitamins A and C are associated with a reduced risk of asthma (27, 28).\n\nOne review of 40 studies found that the occurrence of asthma in adults was associated with low vitamin A intake. In fact, those with asthma were only meeting about 50% of the daily recommended intake of vitamin A, on average (29).\n\nIn addition, the incidence of asthma increased by 12% in those who had low dietary vitamin C intake.\n\nPurple yams are a good source of antioxidants and vitamins A and C, helping you reach your daily intake levels for these vitamins.\n\nSummary Antioxidants like vitamins A and C in purple\n\nyams may help reduce the risk and symptoms of asthma.\n\n6. Promotes gut health\n\nPurple yams may help improve your gut health.\n\nThey are full of complex carbs and a good source of resistant starch, a type of carb that is resistant to digestion.\n\nOne test-tube study showed that resistant starch from purple yams increased the number of Bifidobacteria, a type of beneficial gut bacteria, in a simulated large bowel environment (30).\n\nThese bacteria play a vital role in your gut health, aiding the breakdown of complex carbs and fiber (31).\n\nThey may even help reduce your risk of certain conditions, such as colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). They also produce healthy fatty acids and B vitamins (32, 33, 34, 35).\n\nFurthermore, one study in mice found that purple yams had anti-inflammatory effects and decreased symptoms of colitis (36).\n\nHowever, more research is needed to know if eating whole purple yams has anti-inflammatory effects in humans with colitis.\n\nSummary The resistant starch in\n\nyams helps increase the growth of Bifidobacteria, which are healthy\n\nbacteria that play a vital role in maintaining your gut health.\n\nPurple yam vs. taro root\n\nTaro root (Colocasia esculenta) is a root vegetable native to Southeast Asia.\n\nOften called the potato of the tropics, it varies in color from white to grey to lavender and has a mildly sweet taste.\n\nPurple yams and taro root look similar, hence the confusion between the two. Nonetheless, when stripped of their skins, they are different colors.\n\nTaro is grown from the tropical taro plant and is not one of the nearly 600 types of yams.\n\nSummary Taro root grows from the\n\ntaro plant, and unlike purple yams, they are not a species of yam.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nPurple yams are an incredibly nutritious starchy root vegetable.\n\nTheir powerful antioxidants may help reduce your blood pressure and blood sugar levels.\n\nThey are tasty and versatile with a vibrant color, making them an exciting ingredient that can be used in a variety of sweet and savory dishes."
