        "text": "Less than a year ago I started dying my dark hair different colors. I went from blue, green, pink to pastel purple.\n\nBefore I start to tell you my story, I want to emphasize that back then I had no idea how to do it. I watched lots of Youtube videos to learn more about the process and asked a few friends that already did it with their hair. It looked kind of easy so I decided to try it myself.\n\nOne day I heard one girl saying in a video that \"Having colorful hair was more than a style, it was a lifestyle\" and she was so right. Having colorful hair implies patience and a time investment. If you want to do it, you need to really want this change, because the results will be dramatic and you’ll need to invest in some products and spend a few extra minutes a day to make it look great and not just messy.\n\nIf you go to a hair salon make sure they know how to work this trend. Read reviews and ask for pictures of their work just to make sure you are in good hands. I decided to do it myself because I had a bad experience in a hair salon.\n\nA few years ago I went to dye some of my hair in blue. It was a huge mistake. The color looked ok, but they literally burnt my hair! Horribly, it fell off in small pieces the days after the process. I was so mad. Even after that horrible experience, I really wanted to dye it again, but I waited a year or more until my fear subsided. I decided that this time I was going to do it myself to be able to control the damage and the way it look.\n\nHappily I made it work, and in the journey I learned so much about the process. So I want to share some tips and important facts that I've learned. These tips are just based on my own experience, I hope they help you make better decisions if you are planning on dying your hair yourself and even if you decide to go to a hair salon, also they will help you have an idea of how to take care of the fantasy color and how to keep your hair as healthy, soft and bright as possible.\n\nHow to go from dark brown to pastel purple hair:\n\nIf you have no idea about the process of dying your hair with fantasy color, here is how it works. You basically need to bleach your hair to have a “white” or “yellowish” base.\n\nAfter your hair has been bleached, you apply the fantasy color. This fantasy color is not permanent. You can get rid of it washing your hair everyday. It normally stays in your hair for a few days or weeks, depending on the color and/ or brand of fantasy color that you choose.\n\nWhen the color is out, you can bleach the hair again, in case you want your hair more “white”. You can also start using a new color to have a new look. That’s why it's so easy to go from pink to green and vice versa. You wash it all and can apply a new color again.\n\nIf your hair is too dark, the first time you bleach it you will get a “yellowish blond” tone. This “yellowish blond” is actually great if you want dark hair fantasy colors like red, navy blue, green (that was the first color I tried!) or purple.\n\nIf you want a pastel hair fantasy color, your hair should reach the ultimate level of discoloration, almost white. But to get that white, you’ll need to bleach your hair a few times for a few months, waiting at least 15 days between each process.To bleach your hair you’ll need bleach powder, crème developer and a pair of gloves. I also recommend that you get a shampoo special for bleach blonde hair, a conditioner mask and coconut oil or argan oil. You can go to the beauty supply store and ask for the best brands and products for your hair.\n\nHere are Some Tips to Protect your Hair from Damaging While Bleaching and Coloring:\n\nA lot of people and places recommend using 40 volume crème developer to bleach dark hair. I find that this 40 volume is too aggressive and damages your hair a lot. Instead, I used 30 Volume Crème developer. My hair didn’t look “white blond” at first, but every time I touched the color, I was getting that dreamy white blond that was great to get a beautiful pastel violet hair. This is a process that times time, but it’s totally worth it, you just have to be patient.\n\nNever never leave the products more than 40 minutes in your hair. The reality is that after 40 minutes you hair is just burning. The best thing to do is to remove the product 35 minutes after applying. If you want to bleach again, to get the “white blonde” tone, wait at least 15 days.\n\nUse a shampoo made for bleach blonde hair. Ask in the beauty supply store for one that is best for your hair.\n\nAfter you apply the fantasy color, do not shampoo, just add a conditioner mask so the color stays longer. You can start shampooing two or three days after you apply the fantasy color.\n\nUse oil, it can be argan oil, coconut oil and even extra virgin olive oil to protect your hair before your bleach it. Apply a significant amount of oil at night and wash it in the morning. Do this at least for a week before you dye your hair again."
