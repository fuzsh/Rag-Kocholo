        "text": "In the world of advocacy and awareness, Purple has become a hue representative for a tapestry of causes and messages. At \"Wear It Purple,\" we understand that purple carries many stories and signifies many days of importance, and we're here to celebrate that beautiful diversity!\n\nBut firstly, why Purple for \"Wear It Purple\" Day?\n\nYou may be curious about why we chose purple for our cause but before we reveal this let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. Wear it Purple was founded by high-school students in 2010 in response to global stories of real teenagers, real heartache and their very real responses. In 2010, several rainbow young people took their own lives following bullying and harassment resulting from the lack of acceptance of their sexuality or gender identity.\n\nBut back to the big question we often get asked - why purple? Well, one of our founders Katherine Hudson stated that she \"...saw purple as a way of bringing people together from all different backgrounds and creating one thing…a symbol of unity...”. And to this day we couldn’t agree more!\n\nSharing the love of Purple with Other Causes\n\nIn recent times we have been contacted regarding the fact that purple is also associated with other important causes. Awareness for Epilepsy, Fibromyalgia, Alzheimer's, Spirit Day, Pancreatic cancer and many other important causes (and of course ourselves at Wear It Purple) all have a shared love for not just a colour but also for making a difference.\n\nSharing the colour purple with various causes is a testament to its versatility and its power to bring people together. It's a reminder of the interconnectedness of our shared values and our collective goal of making the world a better place.\n\nPurple and it’s ties to LGBTQ+ history\n\nSerendipitously, the colour purple throughout history, and its vibrant cousin lavender, have been tied closely to queer rights and liberation.\n\nLavender, in particular, became synonymous with the LGBTQ+ community during the mid-20th century. It emerged as a symbol of love and solidarity amidst the challenging times of discrimination and persecution. The term \"lavender scare\" was even coined to describe a period of time where the U.S. government targeted and purged LGBTQ+ individuals from federal employment. Despite the adversity, relationships and alliances emerged as a source of strength, much like the colour itself. In the face of adversity, the LGBTQ+ community and its allies found solace and unity in lavender, but the connection to the colour doesn’t end there."
