        "text": "When brown and purple are mixed together, they make a new tertiary color. Tertiary colors are made by combining a primary color with a secondary color. In this case, brown contains red and purple contains blue – both primary colors. The resulting color when brown and purple are blended will be dependent on the specific shades used. Generally speaking, mixing these two colors will produce a dark, earthy tone that may appear closer to brown or purple depending on the proportions used.\n\nThe Color Wheel\n\nTo understand what color brown and purple make when mixed, it helps to look at a color wheel. The color wheel shows the relationship between different colors and how they interact. There are three main types of colors:\n\nPrimary colors – red, yellow, blue\n\nSecondary colors – orange, green, purple\n\nTertiary colors – made by mixing a primary and secondary color, such as red-orange, yellow-green, blue-purple\n\nOn the color wheel, brown is a shade of orange, located between the primary color red and the secondary color orange. Purple is located between the primary color blue and the secondary color purple.\n\nWhen looking at complementary colors on the color wheel, brown and purple are nearly opposite each other with purple on the cool, blue side and brown on the warm, yellow-orange side. This means mixing them will create a more neutral, muted tone.\n\nThe Color Mix\n\nMixing any two colors together creates a new tertiary color. The specific tertiary color that brown and purple make depends on the exact shades used. Here are some examples:\n\nDeep brown + vivid purple = very dark grayish brown\n\nLight brown + pale purple = soft muted lavender\n\nReddish brown + blue-toned purple = earthy gray brown\n\nA light hand is needed when mixing brown and purple to avoid getting mud. Start with small amounts and gradually increase one color or the other to achieve the desired tone.\n\nVariations in Color Mixing\n\nMany factors affect the final color mixture of brown and purple:\n\nProportions – Using more brown vs more purple will shift the tone towards one color or the other.\n\nShades – Darker or lighter shades of brown and purple will produce darker or lighter tertiary colors.\n\nTones – Brown with red or orange tones vs purple with blue or pink tones will yield different combinations.\n\nTexture – Flat, glossy, or metallic brown and purple paints, dyes, or fabrics can also change how the colors mix.\n\nBelow is a table showing some variations when mixing different shades and proportions of brown and purple:\n\nBrown Shade Purple Shade Mix Ratio Resulting Tertiary Color Dark brown Royal purple 1:1 Very dark grayish brown Medium reddish brown Lavender 3:1 Muted tan Light beige brown Pale lilac 1:3 Soft grayish mauve Golden brown Vivid violet 1:1 Dark gray brown\n\nUses for Brown and Purple Color Combinations\n\nMixing brown and purple together produces earthy, neutral tones that work well in many contexts. Here are some ways to utilize brown and purple color combinations:\n\nInterior design – Paint walls, furniture, or decor accents in rich brown-purple hues\n\nFashion and textiles – Choose brown and purple clothing patterns and accessories\n\nFloral arrangements – Incorporate brown and purple flowers like orchids\n\nArt and crafts – Use brown and purple paints, papers, yarns, etc. for mixed media\n\nCosmetics – Brown-purple eyeshadows and nail polishes for a trendy look\n\nFood presentation – Garnish plates with purple foods on brown backgrounds\n\nBrown and purple have a classic, elegant feel when combined. The muted tones create a soothing, earthy color palette. Adjust the proportions to make the mix more brown or more purple as desired.\n\nConclusion\n\nBrown and purple are complementary colors that combine to form tertiary colors in the neutral to cool range. The specific shade can vary from deep, dark brown-purples to softer beige-mauves depending on the types of brown and purple used and the ratios mixed. Many factors like tone, shade, and texture can influence the final result. When used together, brown and purple create sophisticated, versatile color combinations suitable for many uses."
