        "text": "6.3K\n\nThis is still officially the weirdest year ever and I thought it only appropriate to give myself my weirdest haircolor yet: Overtone Purple for Brown Hair.\n\nI know you’re thinking about it. I know you’re like me. You have this idea that you want to try a crazy color while you’re still spending most of your time at home. But you have all the doubts I had:\n\nI’m too old for crazy hair colors. (No, you’re not).\n\nI don’t want to commit to a color permanently. (Good. That’s what Overtone is for. They make it fun to use these coloring depositing conditioners that wash out in a few weeks).\n\nHow will it look on my hair? I need to look at approximately 853 different people that tried it before I make a decisions. (This is exactly how I felt and it’s why I’m posting my results. JUST FOR YOU!)\n\nWhat if I hate it? (Been there too.. Scroll down for tips on that.)\n\nSo whatever objection you have, I can meet it. Because I’ve been there. And I took the leap and it’s fun. Once my salon is back in full swing, the fun will be over so for now, I’m sharing my purple hair story with you.\n\nThe Best Color for Your Hair\n\nThere is no right or wrong but just know that some colors go better with your skin tone. I’m pale. You won’t ever find me with yellow or pink hair. It would look terrible on me.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, be sure to check out the time I turned my hair orange because, for some reason, I thought THAT was a good idea.\n\nI do better with “winter” colors and purple is my favorite color. I’ve had it in the back of my mind for a while but thought many of the purple shades weren’t right for me.\n\nThe Best Shade for Your Hair\n\nOnce I decided on purple, I had to decide which purple. For the record, Overtone offers the following purples:\n\nPastel Purple\n\nVibrant Purple\n\nExtreme Purple\n\nPurple for Brown Hair*\n\nThose first three colors are general hair colors that do best on light hair (either naturally or artificially). If you have brown hair and you choose Pastel Purple, you’re not going to see much of anything.\n\nI did, in fact, think that Pastel Purple might be what I wanted. I envisioned a lovely shade of lavender and even on the lighter parts of my hair, the shade was underwhelming.\n\nI knew that I needed a bolder shade of purple but I also wanted it to blend with my drab brown hair. So after waiting weeks for it to come back in stock, I ordered Overtone Purple for Brown Hair, which should *in theory* provide all over purple.\n\nUsing Overtone Purple for Brown Hair\n\nYou probably could have figured this one out but this shade is MESSY. In every kit, they send you a jar of the deep conditioner, a brief “instruction” sheet (throw it away, it’s useless), and a little package of disposable gloves.\n\nHere’s how I apply the hair coloring to keep it from getting all over me (and the bathroom):\n\nWear an old button up shirt that you don’t care about getting stained.\n\nKeep a damp washcloth at the ready that you also don’t care about getting stained. This helps you wipe up the dye that will inevitably get on your skin.\n\nBrush or comb your hair thoroughly.\n\nPUT THOSE DISPOSABLE GLOVES ON.\n\nGently apply the conditioner on small sections of dry hair from root to tip.\n\nTry to avoid rubbing it into your scalp (it will stain!)\n\nOnce finished applying, gently work your fingers down your hair to ensure even distribution to your strands.\n\nWait 10-15 minutes (I set a timer with Alexa or Siri – hands free!)\n\nStep into the shower and rinse your hair. For this part, you make want to continue to use your disposable gloves or your hands may get stained.\n\nAt this point, I use a gentle shampoo and a lite conditioner but if your hair is already clean, you can skip this step.\n\nWhen you’re using a dark color like Overtone Purple for Brown Hair, I suggest wrapping your wet hair in a dark towel just to make sure there’s no color transfer.\n\nAnd now… for the Results!\n\nWell, I can’t complain about seeing the color this time! It was definitely purple throughout my hair AND on my scalp (luckily that washed off after my next shampoo).\n\nIt’s dark but I knew it would be. I do see some hints of my old color peeking through so next time, I’ll either increase the amount of time I leave it on or work the conditioner into smaller sections of my hair to ensure it coats each strand individually.\n\nIf your’e ready to make the leap, be sure to use my referral link for $10 off your first purchase!\n\nOvertone Purple for Brown Hair Video\n\nJust in case you still have doubts, you can watch the whole process!\n\nRead my other Overtone posts!\n\nHow Long Does Overtone Last? Here’s what I found out."
