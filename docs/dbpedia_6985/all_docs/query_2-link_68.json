        "text": "Brown\n\nBefore 2012, the brown-colored M&M’S were the only color in a bag of M&M’S that did not have a corresponding character. My partner and I spent the entire year of 2011 building and developing every detail for Brown — her look, her personality, her humor, her accessories, her voice — and then launched her to the world during the 2012 Super Bowl. We then spent the next two years putting her in the spotlight across all of the brand’s channels.\n\nThe New Girl\n\nIn an effort to create better gender balance within the M&M’S cast of characters and to help lean into their new purpose of creating a world where everyone feels included, the client asked us to create a new female M&M’S character in 2021.\n\nMeet Purple.\n\nThe imperfect, quirky, hopelessly optimistic new M&M’S character whose self-acceptance reminds us that honesty and vulnerability are admirable traits. Purple never tries to be anything but herself.\n\nShe’s also the first peanut-shaped female M&M’S character whose shell color completes the colors of the rainbow for the brand."
