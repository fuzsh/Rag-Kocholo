        "text": "Hi\n\nWhere I live we don't get brown color or brown colored fondant. I need a dark brown, and am trying to color mine with primary colors and a tinge of black, as suggested by one of the posts here. But it has turned to a dull shade of purple. What should I do to make it into a dark brown. Help please!\n\nRed and green make brown so if you add yellow to purple (blue and red) hopefully it will have the right balance to get you to the brown you are looking for.\n\ni might be too late but i would suggest that you test with just a small quantity of fondant and not the entire giant blob if it is a big giant blob\n\nHi Guys,\n\nJust wanted to drop a line to thank you all for getting back to me. I added yellow color and it worked.\n\nThe cocoa powder idea sounds great Julia. I think i should be easier to incorporate than colors. Useful tip for next time :)\n\ndepends on the skin... for a white baby, use a the tiniest bit of ivory and a bit of pink. For a white adult, use a bit of ivory and if you feel it needs it, add some pink. You don't want to turn it yellowish, so use very sparingly. Fimo has a good chart on how to achieve different skin tones."
