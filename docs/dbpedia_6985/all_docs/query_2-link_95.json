        "text": "1. Introduction to Belt Rank System - Purple to Brown\n\n1.1. Purple Belt\n\nPurple belt is the third rank in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Many practitioners consider the purple belt to be the transition stage between a beginner and an expert.\n\nEarning a purple belt is considered to be the midway point of a martial arts student's career and signifies that the student takes Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu seriously, having dedicated a considerable portion of one’s adult life to it.\n\nBeing promoted to purple belt, students feel a sense of relief as they have reached the halfway point towards becoming a black belt.\n\nPurple Belt Expectations\n\nAn advanced purple belt should be able to perform nearly all basic techniques at the beginning of the course and move on to more advanced techniques.\n\nA student’s time as a purple belt is when they begin training in an advanced style of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu that best matches their needs, whether they want to perfect the finer nuances of the X-guard or to improve their knee-on-belly techniques.\n\nThe transition from blue belt to purple belt is typically the point in a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu career when the martial art begins to make sense and they are able to concentrate on the minute details that distinguish professionals from amateurs .\n\nAdditionally, purple belts should feel confident enough in the fundamental techniques that they are able to teach students basic lessons with the authority and effectiveness of white belts.\n\nPurple belts must know how to:\n\nPlay a dangerous guard game\n\nCan carry out a number of different combination attacks\n\nUse advanced guard pass variants (spider, deep-half, de la riva, etc.)\n\nExecute multiple submissions from any mounting position\n\nIntroduction of leg lock\n\n2.
