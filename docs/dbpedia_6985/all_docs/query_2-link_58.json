I've tried each one at least twice, and it's only worked once, and it just made my blue into green. I'd fade your hair as much as possible (use dish soap as shampoo, vitamin c treatments, hot oil treatments, wash with harsh shampoo in hot water,etc) and get it as light as you possibly can first, you might even be able to wash all the purple out. I'd do that as much as you can and then buy an ash brown from Sally's, but focus on getting the purple out first or it'll just stick out through the brown.\n\nImma going to miss the purple hair. I always click on your profile just so I can stare at it (part of me is just wanting to gain the courage to give myself a nice rich purple streak thru my hair) and plus its the best purple I've seen on hair in awhile. Brown is going to look great on you too but I'm going to miss the purple. xxx\n\nThank you all! @shelley I will miss it too but it's difficult to maintain lol not to mention messy! :p you should definitely go for a bold streak!!\n\nI'll start trying some if these ideas and keep you all updated. thanks again!!"
