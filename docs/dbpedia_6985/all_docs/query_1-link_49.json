        "text": "British gardens are full of nature and can attract many different species of bird throughout the seasons. Some birds are year-round inhabitants that you'll come to recognise, whilst others are seasonal visitors. Gardens provide a safe haven for birds, and if you plant up with them in mind, can provide them with all the food, shelter and water they need throughout the year.\n\nAs well as providing shop-bought food, why not have a go at providing natural food sources in your garden by planting small trees, berry-bearing shrubs and flowers that not only attract insects, but have seed heads to help encourage different species of birds into your garden. Look for foliage plants as well that will provide shelter and protection from prey that will clothe a wall or fence.\n\nHere are 19 of the most common birds that you are likely to spot in your garden in Britain.\n\n1. Robin\n\nThe Robin is consistently voted as Britain’s most popular garden bird and it’s easy to see why. With its curious nature and bright red chest the robin can be spotted all year round especially at Christmas, which is why it has long been symbolic of Christmas (you’re sure to find one on a Christmas card if not in your garden).\n\nTo encourage robins into your garden, as well as providing shop-bought food, create a garden that encourages their natural prey. Planting small trees and shrubs provide perfect habitats for the types of minibeasts that robins love to eat. Robins are ground feeders so provide some low-growing ground cover plants such as ivy, cottage geraniums and periwinkle.\n\n5. Long-tailed Tit\n\nThe Long-tailed Tit is a tiny, gregarious bird that is quite fluffy with pinkish colouring. It can usually be found in flocks or twenty or more. As the name gives away, this particular breed has a large tail that exceeds the size of its body.\n\nTo encourage Tits into your garden have a variety of feeders but tits especially love hawthorn and elderberries in the autumn so if you have the space try planting at least one of these in your garden. They also eat pollen and insects so grow a mixture of wildflowers to attract insects in and to provide pollen. As well as wildflowers easy flowers to grow to provide a great food source for tits include calendula, nasturtiums, salvias and lavenders.\n\n6. Goldfinch\n\nThe Goldfinch is arguably one of the prettiest British garden bird with its vibrant red face and yellow wings. Listen out for their peaceful twittering around the bird stand for a likely spotting. Increasingly Goldfinch are visiting UK garden feeders – however by winter they will have migrated to warmer climates as far away as Spain.\n\nGoldfinches love fine seeds like niger seeds and are particularly fond of Teasel and Verbena seed heads so have a go at growing these in your garden to encourage these gorgeous birds.\n\nThe article continues below, read on to discover more birds you can find in your garden.\n\n12. Wren\n\nSmall in size, the Wren is a slim brown bird that is roundish in shape with a fine tail, which can be vertical. Surprisingly the wren has a loud voice for its size. The Wren is the UK’s most common breeding bird and likes to feed on insects and spiders so try not to be too tidy in your garden and leave some areas where insects and spiders can make a home.\n\nAs Wrens are so tiny they need to hide from predators fairly quickly so try to have some climbing foliage plants in the garden where they can take shelter when needed. Pretty climbers that will provide shelter to grow include clematis, wisteria and honeysuckle.\n\nRead on further below to discover more birds."
