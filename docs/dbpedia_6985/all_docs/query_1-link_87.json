        "text": "England are set to wear their new purple away kit when they host Belgium in a friendly match tonight, but they are unlikely to don the strip at Euro 2024.\n\nNew kits were launched ahead of the tournament earlier this month, with Nike designing a purple away shirt instead of the more traditional red or blue strips that fans have come to expect in recent years.\n\nThe FA described it as a reimagination of \"iconic kits from the past with a modern twist, making a bold statement with an eye-catching purple - a modern mix of classic blue and red England change kits of the past.\"\n\nAnd England will wear it for the first time when they take on Belgium, despite the fact it's a home game being played at Wembley in an attempt to promote the new shirt following its release.\n\nHowever, it is extremely unlikely England will need to wear purple at the upcoming Euros. In fact, the last time the Three Lions wore their away kit at a major tournament was back in 2018 when they lost 2-0 to Belgium in the third place play-off.\n\nAt this year's Euros, England will kick off their campaign against Serbia and Denmark and, although they are the away side for both of those matches, they will be able to wear their white home strip as it does not clash with their opponents' red kits.\n\nThere would be a kit clash for their final group game against Slovenia, who also wear white as their home shirt, but England are the home side for that match and their opponents will have to swap strips. It is also unlikely Gareth Southgate's side will be drawn against another side whose home kit is white in the knockout rounds, although it is not out of the question.\n\nAgainst Belgium, England will also wear shirts without names on the back in the second half as part of a campaign with the Alzheimer's Society, with the shirts set to be auctioned off to raise funds for the charity. \"We hope this striking gesture with the player's shirts will once again get fans across the country talking, and thinking about the signs and symptoms of dementia,\" chief executive Kate Lee said.\n\n\"By using football to shine a spotlight and increase awareness of dementia symptoms, we hope to not only encourage fans to donate towards our early diagnosis research, but also to support their loved ones just as much as they support their football team.\n\n\"This means taking crucial first steps in seeking a diagnosis if they suspect someone they care about may be affected. A diagnosis can be daunting but itâ€™s better to know.\""
