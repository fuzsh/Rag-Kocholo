        "meta_description": "Putting up a Purple Martin house is like installing a miniature neighborhood in your backyard. In the East, dark, glossy-blue males and brown females will peer from the entrances and chirp from the rooftops all summer. In the West, martins mainly still nest the old-fashioned wayâ€”in woodpecker holes. Our largest swallows, Purple Martins perform aerial acrobatics to snap up flying insects. At the end of the breeding season they gather in big flocks and make their way to South America.",

        "text": "Migration\n\nLong-distance migrant. Most Purple Martins that breed in eastern North America probably migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. They form huge roosts (of several hundred thousand birds) in late summer along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida. Others may fly over Mexico and through Central America. Purple Martins are probably leisurely migrants that fly only during the day and forage as they go. Nonetheless, they are one of the earliest South American migrants to arrive in the spring, reaching Florida as early as mid-January and New England in mid-April."
