        "meta_description": "The Purple Finch is the bird that Roger Tory Peterson famously described as a “sparrow dipped in raspberry juice.” For many of us, they’re irregular winter visitors to our feeders, although these chunky, big-beaked finches do breed in northern North America and the West Coast. Separating them from House Finches requires a careful look, but the reward is a delicately colored, cleaner version of that red finch. Look for them in forests, too, where you’re likely to hear their warbling song from the highest parts of the trees.",

        "text": "Among the small forest birds like chickadees, kinglets, and nuthatches, Purple Finches are large and chunky. Their powerful, conical beaks are larger than any sparrow’s. The tail seems short and is clearly notched at the tip.\n\nRelative Size\n\nAbout the same size as House Finch and House Sparrow\n\nsparrow-sized or smaller\n\nMeasurements\n\nBoth Sexes\n\nLength: 4.7-6.3 in (12-16 cm)\n\nWeight: 0.6-1.1 oz (18-32 g)\n\nWingspan: 8.7-10.2 in (22-26 cm)\n\nMale Purple Finches are delicate pink-red on the head and breast, mixing with brown on the back and cloudy white on the belly. Female Purple Finches have no red. They are coarsely streaked below, with strong facial markings including a whitish eyestripe and a dark line down the side of the throat.\n\nPurple Finches readily come to feeders for black oil sunflower seeds. You’ll also see them in forests, where they can be noisy but hard to see as they forage high in trees. In winter they may descend to eat seeds from plants and stalks in weedy fields. Their flight is undulating."
