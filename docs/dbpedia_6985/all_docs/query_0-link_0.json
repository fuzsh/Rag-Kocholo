The series was devised and directed by Rich Webber and edited by Mike Percival,[1] who also offered the voices of the characters, and first aired in February 2006, on Nickelodeon's UK and Ireland channel, and then later became a staple on the US Nickelodeon network as part of its former Nick Extra short program.[2]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series was devised and was directed by Webber and edited by Percival,[1] who also offer the voices of the characters.
