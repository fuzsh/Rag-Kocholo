        "text": "Locally it's Brown, Purple , Yellow.\n\nOur largest municipality has a local rule restricting Orange to High-Leg.\n\nI had a job adding a 480 volt service to a building and used Yellow Brown Purple because I was re-feeding the old delta service that I used Black Orange Blue. The Fulton county inspector would not pass me until I changed it to Brown Orange Yellow. His reasoning was that because the other color code was common, an electrician coming in behind me would get confused.\n\nWhen do you use brown orange yellow? And when do you use brown purple yellow? Thank you for your help.\n\nThe industry norm is to use brown/orange/yellow, unless a local standard governs otherwise. The NEC doesn't enforce this standard, but it's the norm people follow. Some local jurisdictions strictly limit orange to the high leg, and thus violet is used for the B phase of a 277/480V system. Chances are, it really isn't necessary to avoid orange if the AHJ allows it, because if you have a 277/480V service, it's very unlikely to have a high leg anywhere on the property. Most big ticket loads would use the 277/480V system anyway.\n\nWhat we really need, is a standard for indicating voltage systems that are non-standard for the USA, such as 230/400V or 347/600V. A lot of people default to brown/orange/yellow, for anything other than 120/208V or 120/240V. One way you could do it, is to use all black wire, with the number of tape bands to tell apart phases. Such as 1-band violet for Phase A, 2-band violet for phase B, and 3-band violet for phase C. Another way, is to use light blue and pink tape, such that it is violet/pink/light blue.\n\nAlways been BOY here, never seen it the other way ever. But I have seen reference to it. The OP says BPY but I always thought it was BYP. Post 2 is YBP. Which is it really? I guess it sounds like an older color code.\n\nIt is an older one, there is a saying to remember the sequence, but is not really politically correct to say on here. Don’t know why it was flipped around when the newer color code came out, maybe because “BOY” was easy to remember."
