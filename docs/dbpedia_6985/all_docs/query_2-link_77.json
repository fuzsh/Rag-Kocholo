Due to the high courier cost in sending them out, we cannot supply them free of charge in all cases.\n\nImportant: The natural colour of our clay tiles means that no 2 tiles are exactly the same and this is what gives a Dreadnought roof its beauty and character. Within a single Dreadnought colour, there can be a number of different tones and we will include more than one tile sample to show you the range of tones you can expect."
