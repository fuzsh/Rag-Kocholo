        "text": "The powerhouse female character trio Green, Brown and Purple will feature on inspirational packaging, plus be the first united representation of the female trio ‘spokescandies’.\n\nThese debut M&M'S packs come as the next chapter for Mars' newest M&M'S character, Purple, featuring her not only on packaging, but in packaging as well, alongside green and brown candies.\n\n\"The M&M'S brand is on a mission to use the power of fun to create purposeful connections, as we work to create a world where everyone feels they belong​,\" said Gabrielle Wesley, Chief Marketing Officer, Mars Wrigley North America. \"Women all over the world are flipping how they define success and happiness while challenging the status quo, so we're thrilled to be able to recognize and celebrate them – and who better to help us on that mission than our own powerhouse 'spokescandies' Green, Brown and Purple?\"​\n\nIn celebration of the limited-edition packs, M&M'S is supporting organisations that are committed to uplifting and empowering women doing incredible work in their respective fields and daily lives.\n\nMars said $1 from every pack sold (totaling $500k) will go towards supporting women via strategic partnerships with She Is The Music and We Are Moving the Needle. Additional donations (totalling $300k), outside of the limited-edition packs, will be made to Female Founder Collective, Geena Davis Institute On Gender In Media and women who are flipping the status quo, as part of the overall programme.\n\nAs part of the additional donation outside of the limited-edition packs, M&M'S is inviting fans to visit MMS.com from January 5th – 15th to nominate women in their lives who are flipping the status quo, for the chance to be featured on M&M'S platforms and receive $10,000 grants to further fund their flip. Ten winners will be identified in partnership with the M&M'S FUNd Advisory Council and revealed on International Women's Day."
