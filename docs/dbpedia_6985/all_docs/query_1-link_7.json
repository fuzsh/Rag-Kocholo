        "text": "Dark Velvet is a very dark purple, rich and deep with warm red/brown undertones that add depth and drama to any space. Make a statement with this deep purple on a bedroom or living room wall, or if you love the idea but are afraid to turn it into reality on a grand scale, try it in the bathroom. This dark, moody shade will pair beautifully with white tiles and fixtures for a calming and serene look. Dark enough to use in place of a charcoal or navy, Dark Velvet is a lovely backdrop for artworks and feature lighting. Dark Velvet has a sense of the mystical, so introducing this unexpected colour to your home will only add to the magic."
