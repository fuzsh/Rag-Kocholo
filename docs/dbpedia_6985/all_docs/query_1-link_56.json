        "text": "Purple paint isn't a colour everyone would naturally turn to for their interior but it can lift a room and offer a soothing feel, too, so don't rule it out when decorating. Purple works well with white trims but it can also set off pink, blue and even yellow items in the home well. Find out more about how to deploy both dark and light purple paint if you are unsure about the conditions under which it will look best.\n\nAll Purple Paint Colours\n\nIf you have ever been in a room with dark purple paint then you will probably realise that this colour can divide opinions. However, it is the perfect colour to choose in many stylish settings, providing a degree of 'pop' as well as a sense of peace and calmness. Whether you use it for a feature wall or more extensively around the whole home to add a sense of uniformity, purple can deliver a great deal.\n\nFrom a subtle lilac through to a deep purple paint colour, these shades offer versatility. Once a room with purple paint has been entered, you'll know exactly what sort of dynamic decorating style to expect. Search our entire stock of purple shades and choose the perfect colour for your home.\n\nIf you are considering a purple wall as a feature of your room or even decorating more extensively with purple, then save some of these paints as potential on-trend options. Firstly, Ash Grove constitutes a great mid-tone, heliotrope purple with a raspberry undertone that is neutral enough for all spaces.\n\nAnother top pick from the range is Blackcurrent Magic. As the name suggests, it takes the fruit as its inspiration and comes in a matt as well as a mid-sheen finish. If you still want to find a dramatic feature wall option for your basket, then how about Dark Angel? This one will also work well if you fancy a purple ceiling.\n\nAn ideal choice for walls in a child's bedroom, for example, Lighter Than Air offers a muted, pretty peony purple that would look great against grey or warm complementing tones. It has a grape juice undertone. If you buy Pale Orchid for your walls, then expect a truly light purple paint that looks great set against brown or deep orange paint colours.\n\nAmong our stock of purple options in lighter tones is Frosted Lilac. It provides an icy purple hue with a mulberry undertone. Orders of it are suited to meditative and relaxing spaces making it an ideal paint for a guest bedroom, for instance.\n\nIf you are unsure which dark purple paint would suit your home best, especially if you are going to use one in a small room, then consider these three options. Distant Galaxy and Wild Hyacinth come with sumptuous indigo undertones for a rich blue-like feel while Bramble Patch is a heliotrope purple that offers an intriguing raspberry undertone. Add these shades to any room you want to look rich and inviting.\n\nNot all purples are strident paints that create a dramatic impact. Some are much more subtle and it is clear why when you add pastel purples to your home. Delicate Blossom is a great wall or ceiling paint, for instance. This shade is good to pair with accent greens or grey-silver tones.\n\nAlternatively, why not add Village Fair to your basket? It is a mid-tone, mulberry purple with a subdued royal blue undertone that would be perfect for a feature wall or even as a ceiling paint.\n\nTo begin with, Gothic Amethyst is saturated, dusty violet purple. Many people discover its neutral tonality works well with its mauve undertone. Good for dressing rooms and reading rooms, it has a classic feel. Another dusky purple that reviews well is Princess Castle. This dusty rose-purple with a peony undertone is another fine choice as a ceiling paint.\n\nIn terms of dining rooms, Pink Potion constitutes a perfect mid-tone choice. Buy it if you want your white trim to pop against its dusty violet-mauve purple appearance.\n\nIf you want the perfect purple wall but aren't sure whether one would suit your home, then a grey-purple paint is a good place to start. With a misty undertone, Silver Wedding seemingly filters the light that reflects off it with a soft shimmer. Meanwhile, Glistening Grey is a mulberry purple with a royal blue undertone that can save walls from looking drab without being too in your face.\n\nThere is no perfect way of describing the best purple paint application but if you are talking about interior dÃ©cor, then the feature wall approach has to be part of the discussion. Rich purples with a matt finish make great backdrops for visual art, especially paintings with bold, metal frames. Just one rich purple wall in a bedroom or lounge can really alter its character.\n\nIf you have a smaller space or one that doesn't see much natural sunlight, then opt for a more soothing pastel or light purple colour. Such shades will line up well with white architraves, white doors and white skirting boards which can help save time if you don't want to repaint those features to accommodate your new colour choice."
