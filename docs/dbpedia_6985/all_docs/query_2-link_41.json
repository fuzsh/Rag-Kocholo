I have been to some events where it is clear that for the main event everybody is expected to sing and hold hands. I had somebody mention to me that it seems like church. Good point. How do I feel about going to church and being required to pray? About the same. I can go along, but I feel ... like this is a version of permaculture church that isn't quite aligned with mine. And really, I'm there to talk shop and exchange knowledge. I have strong needs for \"talk shop\" and \"exchange knowledge\" but I don't have needs for holding hands and singing. And it does feel religious, and I really don't want my permaculture to be churchy.\n\nyukkuri kame wrote:Why stop at purple:\n\nPurple - we all intuitively know what this means\n\nBrown - ? ill defined in my mind, except in opposition to purple\n\nGreen - ecotopians, would rather be foraging in zone 5 than figuring out how to feed the urban billions\n\nBlue - businessmen like Gunter Pauli, author of the \"blue economy\" that are trying to bring systems design up to economy of scale\n\nRed - feel entitled to distribute the fair share on behalf of those who are obtaining a yield\n\nBlack - Doomers, Peak Oilers\n\nLavender - Nice ladies that like to dabble in the garden, who are happy as long as it blooms pretty and attracts butterflies.\n\nWhite - mycophiles who got a vision of permaculture when communing with the 'shrooms\n\netc., etc.\n\nI imagine there are as many colors of permaculture as there are permies.

Nothing will change, however, unless we change it ourselves. I used to fall prey to this rhetoric: \"Until things change...\" Don't wait for the change to come. Become the change. As a 23 year old who previously thought that I could do very little about the circumstances at large, I have realized there is far more that can be done other than buying your own land and entrenching yourself in mortgages (death pledges) and other silly institutions. In my case, I chose to join an egalitarian community that owns a prominent heirloom seed business. We eat much of what we grow, we dumpster dive, live low-impact lifestyles, and generally have our needs accounted for. Sure, we could work on some things.. Everyone can. Though to limit oneself to what money can buy is foolish. Sure, we still have one foot in to what many call, \"the mainstream world.\" We have money, we make money, we spend money collectively. But the money and resources are shared within the community, and we have a large political involvement with this mainstream world in producing the change we seek. I am not trying to say everyone should join an egalitarian community, nor am I saying my way is the best way, but I am merely just trying to illustrate that thinking outside of the box can land you in many interesting and productive living arrangements.\n\nForest farming in and of itself is agroforestry, by the way. Permaculture is a philosophy and a way of life... The food production/land management is but one component of it. The larger picture is humans and their relationship to their environment.\n\nJonathan 'yukkuri' Kame wrote:Why stop at purple:\n\nPurple - we all intuitively know what this means\n\nBrown - ? ill defined in my mind, except in opposition to purple\n\nGreen - ecotopians, would rather be foraging in zone 5 than figuring out how to feed the urban billions\n\nBlue - businessmen like Gunter Pauli, author of the \"blue economy\" that are trying to bring systems design up to economy of scale\n\nRed - feel entitled to distribute the fair share on behalf of those who are obtaining a yield\n\nBlack - Doomers, Peak Oilers\n\nLavender - Nice ladies that like to dabble in the garden, who are happy as long as it blooms pretty and attracts butterflies.\n\nWhite - mycophiles who got a vision of permaculture when communing with the 'shrooms\n\netc., etc.\n\nTate Smith wrote:What ever happened to the word......\"Farming\"....... How cool would it be to have a rotational chicken coop, 30 miles of electric fencing for your cows, 10 feet tall hugelkultur beds covered in another 4 feet of mulch. A house that is rag tagged together and only costed 400 dollars. Your neighbors would gossip about you, eventually someone would ask, \"What are you doing?\".............to which you would reply.............\"I'm farming\".\n\nThat's how to further the idea of what permaculture should be, the standard. So if we want permie practices to be the standard we need to call them by the standard name for standard acceptance. Farming.\n\nIf we teach our kids that permaculture and organics and all of these great things is just plain simple farming, the next generation will see huge tractors and planes and herbicides and all of these things as nothing different than a freeway.\n\nSo I know what I'll call it...............I'll call it farming. And what those call farming today, doesn't need to be discussed."
