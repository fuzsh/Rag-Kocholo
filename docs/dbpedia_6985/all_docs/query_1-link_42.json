        "text": "Purple crop Borage crowns grown in Magdalen Laver\n\nBritain is slowly turning purple as arable farmers turn to new crops and plants to keep their heads above water.\n\nIn many parts of the country fields of vivid colours have replaced some of the more traditional golden grain crops and the bright yellow rapeseed more often grown.\n\nFarmers are also planting many fallow fields with a mix of flowers that attract wildlife and insects in their droves - and are cashing in from generous Government subsidies as a result.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is paying farmers £593 per hectare to plant a mix of seeds known as NUM3, as part of a \"sustainable farming incentive\" (SFI), costing it hundreds of thousands of pounds each year.\n\nGrowing the plants, which includes phacelia with the purple colour, is said to improve soil health and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather through crop rotation.\n\nIt also encourages insects and wildlife to the area.\n\nREAD MORE: Farmer gets brilliant revenge on fly-tipper after pile of tyres dumped in field\n\nNUM3 seed mix is 50 percent vetch, 15 percent linseed, 15 percent buckwheat, 7.5 percent crimson clover, 7.5 percent berseem clover and 5 percent phacelia, which despite being the smallest component, gives it the bright purple flower.\n\nThe colour produced by the mix had people guessing on social media as to what it was in fields off the A142 between Chatteris and Mepal, Cambridgeshire, until a local farmer revealed what it was.\n\nTrevor Edgley, who runs the Nightlayer Leek Company, planted it as he found it difficult to sow wheat due to persistently wet fields in the spring.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"I think you'll start to see a lot of it about, ours has come out early because we drilled it in April, whilst we still had some moisture in the soil.\n\n\"The government pays farmers £593 per hectare per year to grow the crop.\n\n\"We have to pay for seed, labour and establishment costs out of that money.\n\n\"I have about 100 acres (40 hectares) growing this fairly new crop.\"\n\nIt means he will be paid £23,720 by DEFRA this year for growing it.\n\nBut, it could leave some farmers reliant of Government subsidies as he added: \"Spring wheat and barley are not always that profitable, so for me, it is a safe bet to sow NUM3, and it is better for the environment too.\"\n\nA DEFRA spokesperson said: \"Through SFI, our aim is to support farming and farmers.\n\n\"We want to protect and improve the environment, food production and food security. We obviously don’t want SFI to be used in a way that comes at a cost to any of them.\n\n\"The evidence shows that a small number of farmers, roughly 1 percent of those who applied for the sustainable farming incentive in 2023, entered 80 percent or more of their farm into actions that involve taking land out of food production.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\n\"The SFI scheme pays farmers to adopt and maintain sustainable farming practices that protect and enhance the natural environment alongside food production, and support farm productivity and resilience.\n\nThis summer, we have expanded the scheme to include the full-scale SFI offer, which includes the planting of CNUM3 (formerly NUM3). This action requires farmers to plant and establish a legume crop, such as common vetch, which has a purple flower.\n\n\"In the 2023-24 financial year the overall spend on SFI was £37.96m, £813.7 thousand was paid towards the planting of NUM3.\n\nWe continue to monitor the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme and the industry to ensure its impact is in line with expectations.\"\n\nOther fields are turning purple across the country as farmers are specifically growing crops such as linseed, lavender, and, more recently borage.\n\nThese are commercial crops with no Government subsidies.\n\nVideo filmed this month near Epping in Essex shows how one farmer has combined keeping honey bees with growing borage due to its attraction for pollinators.\n\nSeveral beehives are lined up at the back of the field with swarms of bees around them.\n\nA National Farmers Union (NFU) spokesman said: \"Borage is an oilseed - highly valued - which is really good for pollinators as well as soil health, weed control etc and used in food supplements, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"Borage is a commercial crop, but it's not government funded so not part of SFI.\"\n\nThe DEFRA spokesperson said: \"SFI does not pay for the growing of Borage. Borage is a commercial crop grown for star flower oil.\"\n\nIt follows a decline in the growing of yellow rapeseed plants after the withdrawal in 2013 of neonicotinoid-treated seeds made it susceptible to Cabbage stem flea beetle, the most significant pest of winter oilseed rape.\n\nThe Agronomist and Arable Farmer reported last month that average rapeseed yields in the UK dropped 10 percent during the most recent five-year period compared to the previous five-year average and the UK was the single worst performing country in terms of average yields when compared to all EU27 Member States.\n\nIt said in 2012 the UK harvested over 700,000 hectares of oilseed rape, but it has been in decline ever since."
