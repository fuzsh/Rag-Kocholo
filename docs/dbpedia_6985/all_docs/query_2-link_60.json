        "text": "DESCRIPTION\n\nLess vine than most of the other heirloom varieties of brown crowders. High yielding, delicious large brown seeds with reddish purple pods at green shell stage. Pods shell very easily. At the dry stage, they are purple. Concentration of pods at foliage level and is bunched. Pods contain about 14 seeds and mature over a short time. 24\"H semi-erect with semi-compact foliage. Lavender flower.\n\n**Cowpeas, Southern Peas, are the most productive and heat tolerant legumes around. Cowpeas come in bush, vine, tall and short varieties. Great for stopping soil erosion and weed suppression. Cowpeas make an excellent Nitrogen source ahead of fall-planted crops and attract many beneficial insects. Cowpeas grow well on poor land and add lots of organic matter to the soil. Also, they make a good animal fodder crop.\n\nCLASSIFICATIONS\n\nOPEN POLLINATED\n\nPollination occurs by insect, bird, wind, humans, or other natural mechanisms. Because there are no restrictions on the flow of pollen between individuals, open-pollinated plants are more genetically diverse. However, as long as pollen is not shared between different varieties within the same species, then the seed produced will remain true-to-type year after year.\n\nHEIRLOOM\n\nThis variety has a history of being passed down within a family or community, similar to the generational sharing of certain items like jewelry or furniture."
