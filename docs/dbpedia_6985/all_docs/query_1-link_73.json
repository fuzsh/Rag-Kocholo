        "text": "By Rebecca Bradbury | Thu 31st Mar 2022\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nWant to know how to mix the perfect purple? In his series on secondary colours, Grahame Booth shows you how it’s done\n\nIn this second instalment on mixing secondary colours, I look at how to mix the perfect purple for any occassion. The first part looked at how to mix the right orange, using the colour to explore the basic concept of an artist’s palette. Plus, it showed how a suitable choice of hues can make colour mixing so much easier and more predictable.\n\nThe twin primary palette uses two reds, two blues and two yellows. Each pair of primaries will be biased towards their two adjacent secondaries. This article looks at mixing purples and how the possibilities of the twin primary system really steps things up a notch.\n\nMixing purple: How to choose the right hues\n\nYou will know purple can be mixed by using red and blue. As I am going to utilise the twin primary system, I will be using two versions of each primary. For this article, I use the same reds as last month. These are Winsor Red (Pyrrole Red in some brands), which is biased towards orange, and Quinacridone Magenta, which is biased towards purple.\n\nFor the blues, I have chosen French Ultramarine, which is biased towards purple, and Phthalo Blue (Green Shade), which is biased towards green.\n\nI realise how confusing all this talk of bias can be. However, a look at the colour wheel should help. It may also be helpful to consider that a primary biased towards a secondary doesn’t really need much encouragement to become that secondary. Therefore, it will produce a purer, brighter version.\n\nUsing that principle a vibrant purple will be mixed from the primaries biased towards each other. For example, a purple-biased blue, French Ultramarine, and a purple-biased red, Quinacridone Magenta). Then if we mix the primaries biased away from each other (a green-biased blue, Phthalo Blue (Green Shade), and an orange-biased red, Winsor Red) we will get a duller purple.\n\nAgain, it is important to remember bright and dull colours are of equal importance. A vibrant purple that may be used for the flower of an iris is not a lot of good to us if we are trying to achieve the purplish-grey of the clouds in a stormy sky. In addition, the intermediate purples we get when mixing either French Ultramarine with Winsor Red or Phthalo Blue (Green Shade) with Quinacridone Magenta gives another series of distinctly different purple mixes.\n\nUnderstanding your paints\n\nIf you buy paints to practice recreating the swatches in this article, remember a similarly-named colour from different manufacturers is very unlikely to be precisely the same hue or even to have the same properties. Colour dot cards are an ideal way to compare paint and to try many different colours without the expense of purchasing full tubes or pans. Most manufacturers produce these cards which have a small but usable sample of every paint in their range.\n\nYou may also wonder why we need six colours when printers can get away with only three (plus black), yet seem to be able to “mix” an almost infinite variety of hues. The reason is they are used in different ways. Printers print tiny dots of colour very close together. While some overlapping of colour occurs, creating a layering effect, there is no physical mixing of the inks. The mixed colour is actually mostly created in our brains. Because the colour dots remain almost a pure colour on the paper, the optical mixes created are equally pure. But even this isn’t perfect – the three colours together theoretically should produce black. However, they actually result in a dark brown which is why a black ink is also required when printing.\n\nPhysically mixing our paints is an entirely different process. The inherent impurity of the hues, as well as physical changes mixing brings, causes the resulting possible colour range to be far from what printers can achieve. I would suggest our six-colour system gives us a good balance between the possible colours we can mix and remembering how to actually mix them. Pointillism used optical mixing in much the same way as the printing process. And it is generally considered the blended colours are brighter and more vibrant than if physically mixed.\n\nThe colour wheel for mixing purples\n\nYou can see how our twin primaries fit into our colour wheel. The precise colours are not really that important as long as they have the colour bias indicated. To mix a bright purple, mix the primaries closest to purple. While for a dull purple, use the primaries furthest away.\n\nHow to mix bright and dull purples\n\nUsing just French Ultramarine and Quinacridone Magenta, it is easy to mix a bright variety of purples and violets that will come very close to many proprietary colours (existing tubes of shop-bought paint). Try mixing this range of swatches yourself – there is no better way to get to grips with colour mixing. Aim to add just enough of the second primary for each swatch to create a subtle but definite colour change.\n\nOn the duller range, the orange bias of Winsor Red and green bias of Phthalo Blue (Green Shade) are so far from each other that the mixed hues could barely be considered to be purple. Instead, we get this useful array of purplish greys.\n\nHow to mix intermediate purples\n\nUnlike intermediate oranges, the intermediate purples provide a further array of colours. Plus, they are quite different to those in the bright and dull mixes. For example, the turquoise colour of pure Phthalo Blue (Green Shade) is much too cool for a sky. But with a touch of Quinacridone Magenta it is a perfect alternative to Cobalt or Ultramarine Blues – this time with the added advantage of being non-granulating.\n\nMeanwhile, the purples produced by French Ultramarine and Winsor Red are, as you would expect, much warmer. This means they tend towards maroon at the red end and with a decent purplish-grey in the middle, ideal for shadows.\n\nHow to mix purple neutrals\n\nI used the mix of French Ultramarine and Quinacridone Magenta to create a mid-purple. Then I mixed this with two yellows, Winsor and Cadmium. The blue in the purple mix produced some useful grey-greens with my green-biased Winsor Yellow. Whereas the orange-biased Cadmium Yellow has been pushed towards brownish greys by the reddish Quinacridone Magenta. Think of the almost infinite possibilities if you repeat this with each slightly different shade of purple.\n\nExamples of how to mix the perfect purple\n\nI used my intermediate purple mix of Phthalo Blue (Green Shade) and Quinacridone Magenta here. Essentially it created the variety of blues in the sky, sea and rooftops. The shadows and rocks were created mainly from the dull purple mix of Phthalo Blue (Green Shade) and Winsor Red.\n\nQuite by chance I discovered M Graham’s Cadmium Red mixed with Winsor & Newton’s Winsor Blue (Green Shade) created similar purple-tinged greys, but the mix separated. Used carefully here, the separation creates an interesting variety of distinct reds and blues within the clouds.\n\nThis painting was all about complementaries. I wouldn’t usually use such a bright purple for the shadow areas. However the complementary yellows sing out against them, creating a really lively look to this Provence landscapes.\n\nEnjoy this guide on how to mix the perfect purple?
