        "text": "What do purple emperor butterflies look like?\n\nCaterpillars: bright green with yellow spots and diagonal yellow lines along sides. They also have prominent, horn-like protrusions on their heads.\n\nAdults: large and dark with white banded wings. Males have an iridescent purple sheen to their upper wings, while females are brown. It is the second largest butterfly in the UK (only the swallowtail is larger). Males are the size of a small bird.\n\nWingspan: 7.5-8.4cm.\n\nHow do purple emperor butterflies breed?\n\nDuring July, males congregate on particularly tall ‘master trees’ awaiting mates. The same trees can be used year after year. Females either couple up with a male or swoop to the ground as a signal that they have already mated.\n\nEggs are laid on goat willow or grey willow leaves. Hatched larvae are well camouflaged with the midrib of the leaves. The caterpillars overwinter in forks in willow twigs then pupate in the summer.\n\nSigns and spotting tips\n\nIt can be spotted between July and August. Butterfly enthusiasts have been known to try to lure males down from the canopy with tempting treats such as banana skins and shrimp paste."
