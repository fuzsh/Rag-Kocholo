        "text": "The Purple Guide has been written by a group of experts drawn from across the outdoor events industry. Its aim is to help those event organisers who are dutyholders to manage health and safety, particularly at large-scale music and similar events. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which originally published the guidance, was consulted from the outset on 'the workplace health and safety' parts of this publication and continues to review any changes made to the Guide.\n\nThis guidance is not compulsory, unless specifically stated, as some elements go further than the minimum an organiser needs to do to comply with workplace health and safety law. If in doubt, organisers should refer to the requirements of the law at www.hse.gov.uk\n\nThe Events Industry Forum took over publication of the Guide in 2012 with the support of the HSE, The Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) and The Concert Promoters Association (CPA), who helped to fund its initial development.\n\nA wide number of industry associations, individuals and commercial organisations have contributed to the revisions of the Purple Guide since its publication and are recognised in the Acknowledgements pages - see here\n\nSupporters of the Guide\n\nThe Health & Safety Executive (HSE) has supported the Guide since its inception and continues to liaise with the Forum on health and safety aspects of the chapters. The HSE is Britainâ€™s national regulator for workplace health and safety which is dedicated to protecting people and places, and helping everyone lead safer and healthier lives. Their role goes beyond worker protection to include public assurance.\n\nInstitute of Licensing (IoL) has contributed to the licensing aspects of the Guide and has given its endorsement to it as guidance for outdoor events. The Institute is the professional body for licensing practitioners across the UK, comprising licensing practitioners from local authorities, other public sector organisations including the police, licensed industry and private practice (legal, training and consultancy). Operating through 12 regions across the UK, the IoL exists to promote and increase awareness and best practice within licensing law and regulation and related issues. The IoL's charity objectives concern raising the professionalism of licensing through education, communications and guidance, and to foster mutual understanding between all parties."
