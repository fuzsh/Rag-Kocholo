BSL is a rich and beautiful language comprising of hand gestures, facial expressions and body movement. It was recognised as a language in its own right in 2003.\n\nWhat to do\n\nLetâs work together to spread deaf awareness. Wear one item of purple, or go all out and dress head to toe in MDC colours! A generous donation of Â£1 made by anyone involved in MDC will collectively make a huge difference to the vital services we provide.\n\nDonate via our website here\n\nCompetition time\n\nWant to win a Â£10 Amazon gift voucher? Submit your photos of yourself wearing purple by tagging us across social media and using the hashtags #gopurpleformdc #mdcday â weâll pick our 5 favourites and announce the winners on 11/06/21 â gift vouchers will then be posted out. See the top bar of the website for our social media feeds."
