        "text": "Main symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer\n\nThe main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is a growth or unusual patch on the skin.\n\nAny part of your skin can be affected, but it's most common in areas exposed to the sun, such as the:\n\nhead, face and ears\n\nneck and shoulders\n\nback\n\nhands\n\nlower legs\n\nThe growths or patches can vary in colour, size and texture.\n\nWhat happens at your GP appointment\n\nThe GP may ask some questions about your health and symptoms, and how much time you spend in the sun.\n\nTell the GP if the growth or area of affected skin has recently changed. Also tell them if you or your family have had skin cancer in the past.\n\nThe GP will look at the affected area of skin. They may ask if they can take a photograph to send to a specialist (dermatologist) to look at.\n\nReferral to a specialist\n\nYou may get an urgent referral for more tests or to see a specialist in hospital if the GP thinks you have symptoms that could be cancer. This does not definitely mean you have cancer."
