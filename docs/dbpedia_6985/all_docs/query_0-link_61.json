        "text": "Tongue cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Cancer is when abnormal cells start to divide and grow in an uncontrolled way. Symptoms can include a spot or lump on your tongue that doesn't go away.\n\nThe main risk factors are smoking, drinking a lot of alcohol and infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV).\n\nThe tongue\n\nThere are two parts to your tongue:\n\nthe oral tongue\n\nthe base of the tongue\n\nCancer can develop in either part.\n\nThe oral tongue is the part you see when you poke your tongue out at someone. This is the front two thirds of your tongue. Cancers that develop in this part of the tongue come under a group of cancers called mouth (oral) cancer.\n\nThe base of the tongue is the back third of the tongue. This part is very near your throat (pharynx). Cancers that develop in this part are called oropharyngeal cancers (pronounced oar-o-farin-gee-al).\n\nWhat are the types of tongue cancer?\n\nThe most common type of tongue cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Squamous cells are the flat, skin like cells that cover the lining of the mouth, nose, larynx, thyroid and throat. Squamous cell carcinoma is the name for a cancer that starts in these cells.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of tongue cancer?\n\nThe symptoms of tongue cancer might include:\n\na red or white patch on the tongue that won't go away\n\na sore throat that doesn't go away\n\na sore spot (ulcer) or lump on the tongue that doesn't go away\n\npain when swallowing\n\nnumbness in the mouth that won't go away\n\npain or burning feeling over the tongue\n\nproblems moving your tongue or speaking\n\na lump in the neck\n\nunexplained bleeding from the tongue (that's not caused by biting your tongue or another injury)\n\npain in the ear (rare)\n\nIt's important to remember that these symptoms might be due to a less serious medical condition. But it's best to check symptoms with your GP just to make sure.\n\nThe photos below give you an idea of what tongue cancers can look like, but remember that they might appear differently from this. Contact your GP or dentist if you notice anything abnormal.\n\nThis picture shows cancer on the side of the tongue.\n\nAnd below is a picture of a red patch underneath the tongue.\n\nWhat are the risks and causes of tongue cancer?\n\nWe don’t know the exact causes of most head and neck cancers, but several risk factors have been identified.\n\nsmoking tobacco (cigarettes, cigars and pipes)\n\nregularly drinking a lot of alcohol\n\ninfection with a virus called human papilloma virus (HPV)\n\n(HPV) is a type of virus that infects the skin and cells lining the inside of the body. For most people, the infection will get better on its own and they will never know they had it.\n\nThis is a common virus that causes no harm in most people. But in some people, the virus can cause changes in the mouth and tongue that can increase the risk of cancer in that area.\n\nHaving a risk factors means that your risk is increased. But it does not mean that you will definitely develop cancer.\n\nHow do you test for tongue cancer?\n\nYour doctor will examine you. They might look at the back of your throat using a small mirror that they put into your mouth. They will check for swollen lymph nodes in your neck.\n\nA biopsy\n\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of cancer is to take a small amount of tissue (biopsy) from the abnormal area. A specialist doctor examines it under a microscope. They might test your cancer cells to check for HPV infection.\n\nAn examination under anaesthetic\n\nYou might have an examination and biopsy under a general anaesthetic. The doctor uses a tube and camera called a panendoscope to look into your throat.\n\nA nasaoendoscopy\n\nYou might also have a nasoendoscopy (sometimes spelt nasendoscopy). You have this in the outpatient department of the hospital. During this procedure the doctor looks:\n\ninside your mouth\n\nat the back of the tongue and throat\n\nat the voice box (larynx)\n\nYour doctor passes a flexible tube called a nasoendoscope through your nose. The tube has a camera and a bright light at the end so they can check for any abnormal looking areas.\n\nIt can be a bit uncomfortable, so your doctor may use an anaesthetic spray to numb your throat first. But if you have the anaesthetic spray you can’t eat or drink until it wears off, so you may choose not to have it.\n\nIf the specialist sees an abnormal area, they will take a biopsy from that area. This is usually arranged for another time.\n\nYou will also have one or more of the following tests:\n\nMRI scan\n\nCT scan\n\nPET-CT scan\n\nblood tests\n\ndental check\n\nultrasound scan\n\nWhat are the stages of tongue cancer?\n\nThe stage of your cancer tells you how big it is and whether it has spread. It helps your doctor decide what treatment you need.\n\nThe stage of your cancer depends on:\n\nhow far your cancer has grown into local tissues\n\nwhether it has spread to nearby lymph glands\n\nwhether it has spread to any other part of the body\n\nDoctors use different staging systems. The staging system they use for you depends on where your cancer starts:\n\nTongue cancer that starts in the front two thirds of your tongue (oral tongue) is staged as a mouth cancer.\n\nTongue cancer that starts in the back third of your tongue ( base of your tongue) is staged as oropharyngeal cancer.\n\nWhat is the treatment for tongue cancer?\n\nThe treatment for tongue cancer depends on:"
