It provides distilled insights and wisdom gained from employing the military instrument of national power in operations to achieve national objectives.\n\nEffective 1JAN19 per Director Joint Force Development: Joint Doctrine constitutes official advice, however, the judgment of the commander is paramount in all situations.
