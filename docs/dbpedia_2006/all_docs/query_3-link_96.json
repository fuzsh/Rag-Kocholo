        "text": "We celebrate EPA's \"birthday\" every December 2. What actually happened on December 2, 1970?\n\nA. President Nixon signed Reorganization Plan No. 3 calling for the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nB. The U.S. Senate confirmed William Ruckelshaus as EPA's first Administrator.\n\nC. Administrator Ruckelshaus signed EPA Order 1110.2 creating the initial organization of EPA.\n\nB is the correct answer.\n\nAdministrator Ruckelshaus was confirmed by the Senate on December 2, 1970, which is the traditional date we use as the birth of the agency.\n\nFive months earlier, in July 1970, President Nixon had signed Reorganization Plan No. 3 calling for the establishment of EPA in July 1970.\n\nTwo days after his confirmation, on December 4, Ruckelshaus took the oath of office and the initial organization of the agency was drawn up in EPA Order 1110.2.\n\nHey... No Peeking!\n\nYou need to select an answer to the question before we'll show you the right answer...\n\nThe American conversation about protecting the environment began in the 1960s. Rachel Carson had published her attack on the indiscriminate use of pesticides, Silent Spring, in 1962. Concern about air and water pollution had spread in the wake of disasters. An offshore oil rig in California fouled beaches with millions of gallons of spilled oil. Near Cleveland, Ohio, the Cuyahoga River, choking with chemical contaminants, had spontaneously burst into flames. Astronauts had begun photographing the Earth from space, heightening awareness that the Earth’s resources are finite.\n\nIn early 1970, as a result of heightened public concerns about deteriorating city air, natural areas littered with debris, and urban water supplies contaminated with dangerous impurities, President Richard Nixon presented the House and Senate a groundbreaking 37-point message on the environment. These points included:\n\nrequesting four billion dollars for the improvement of water treatment facilities;\n\nasking for national air quality standards and stringent guidelines to lower motor vehicle emissions;\n\nlaunching federally-funded research to reduce automobile pollution;\n\nordering a clean-up of federal facilities that had fouled air and water;\n\nseeking legislation to end the dumping of wastes into the Great Lakes;\n\nproposing a tax on lead additives in gasoline;\n\nforwarding to Congress a plan to tighten safeguards on the seaborne transportation of oil; and\n\napproving a National Contingency Plan for the treatment of oil spills.\n\nAround the same time, President Nixon also created a council in part to consider how to organize federal government programs designed to reduce pollution, so that those programs could efficiently address the goals laid out in his message on the environment.\n\nFollowing the council’s recommendations, the president sent to Congress a plan to consolidate many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency. This reorganization would permit response to environmental problems in a manner beyond the previous capability of government pollution control programs:\n\nThe EPA would have the capacity to do research on important pollutants irrespective of the media in which they appear, and on the impact of these pollutants on the total environment.\n\nBoth by itself and together with other agencies, the EPA would monitor the condition of the environment--biological as well as physical.\n\nWith these data, the EPA would be able to establish quantitative \"environmental baselines\"--critical for efforts to measure adequately the success or failure of pollution abatement efforts.\n\nThe EPA would be able--in concert with the states--to set and enforce standards for air and water quality and for individual pollutants.\n\nIndustries seeking to minimize the adverse impact of their activities on the environment would be assured of consistent standards covering the full range of their waste disposal problems.\n\nAs states developed and expanded their own pollution control programs, they would be able to look to one agency to support their efforts with financial and technical assistance and training.\n\nAfter conducting hearings during that summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. The agency’s first Administrator, William Ruckelshaus, took the oath of office on December 4, 1970.\n\nThe documents below shed more light on EPA's birth and early years.
