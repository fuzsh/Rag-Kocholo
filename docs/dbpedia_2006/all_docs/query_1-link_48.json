Read the Departmental Regulation (DR) 1020-006 [PDF, 18 pages] to understand USDA's current public access policy. Public Access is a critical part of our support of Open Science.\n\nLearn about our policy-related activities in the 2023 Implementation Plan to Increase Public Access to USDA-funded Research Results [PDF, 9 pages].\n\nPublic stakeholder listening sessions were held September 27 and October 12, 2023, and written comments were accepted through November 15, 2023 NAL-2023-0001). Summary Report [PDF, 5 pages].\n\nA Question & Answer Session on the USDA Implementation Plan was held on February 20, 2024. Q&A Session slides, [PDF, 20 pages]. A second comment period was open through February 28, 2024 (NAL-2024-0001-0001).\n\nTwo Formal Tribal Consultations relevant to Public Access were held April 11 and April 22, 2024.

If you have questions about the Ag Data Commons, please Ask a Question.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the USDA policy on public access to research products?\n\nAll peer-reviewed, scholarly publications and digital scientific research data assets arising from unclassified research and programs funded wholly or in part by the USDA must be made accessible to the public, to the fullest extent practicable.\n\nPublications covered by this policy must be made freely accessible through the USDA public access archive system (PubAg).\n\nAll scientific research that is expected to produce digital scientific research data assets must be accompanied by a reviewed and approved data management plan.\n\nDigital scientific research data assets covered by public access requirements must be published by a reputable data repository, and a standardized metadata catalog entry that describes the digital scientific research data asset must be submitted to the publicly available USDA scientific data catalog system (Ag Data Commons).\n\nWhy does USDA have a public access policy?\n\nOpenly accessible research products contribute to opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and scientific progress. Additionally, public access to USDA-funded research products helps maintain the integrity, credibility, and transparency of the Departmentâ€™s research findings and capabilities.\n\nUSDA policy on public access is consistent with requirements laid out in a Memorandum from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy that directed Federal Agencies with more than $100M in annual conduct of research and development expenditures to develop public access plans for the results of federally funded, unclassified research that are published in peer-reviewed publications and digitally formatted scientific data. USDA's public access requirements parallel the public access efforts of other scientific research agencies across the Federal Government and a general movement toward open science across many research communities.\n\nWhat research products are in scope of the USDA public access policy?\n\nScholarly publications and digital scientific research data assets arising from scientific research supported wholly or in part by USDA starting on or after October 1, 2022.\n\nScholarly publications are peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in a journal on or after October 1, 2022.\n\nDigital scientific research data assets are associated with a peer-reviewed publication OR the period of performance of the research award has ended, as determined by your USDA funding agency.\n\nWho must comply with the USDA policy on public access?\n\nUSDA employees who engage in scientific research during official duties (i.e., intramural researchers)\n\nAwardees and contractors from non-USDA organizations who are engaged in USDA-funded scientific research (i.e., extramural researchers)\n\nHow can I comply with USDA data management planning requirements?\n\nVisit the Data Management Planning Services page to find information about various aspects of data management including:\n\nHow to create a Data Management Plan (DMP), including a template and example annotated DMP\n\nA DMP reviewer checklist, with instructions to request an optional review by NAL staff\n\nHow to find an appropriate repository to provide public access and long-term storage for your data\n\nA glossary defining key data management terms\n\nData management videos and recorded webinars\n\nFor more detailed answers to these and other questions, consult the USDA Implementation Guide for Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data [PDF, 10 pages].\n\nA slide deck describing the general USDA policies [PDF, 18 pages] can be downloaded and re-used as needed. Questions about the specific policies or procedures of your USDA funding agency can be directed to the following points of contact:\n\nAgency\n\nContact\n\nE-mail\n\nFNCS\n\nJoseph Clift Joseph.Clift@usda.gov\n\nNRCS\n\nJonathan Smith jonathan.smith@usda.gov\n\nFS\n\nJim Lootens-White james.lootens-white@usda.gov\n\nERS\n\nKelly Maguire kelly.b.maguire@usda.gov\n\nNIFA\n\nInquiries electronic@usda.gov\n\nConnect Digital Persistent Identifiers (DPIs)\n\nIf you are a USDA employee, Register or connect your ORCID id, a persistent identifier for scientists, researchers, and authors.
