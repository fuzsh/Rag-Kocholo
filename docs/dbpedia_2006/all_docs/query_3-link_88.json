        "text": "VAWA’s housing safeguards apply to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and/or stalking. These forms of violence (collectively called “VAWA violence/abuse”) are defined below.\n\nDomestic Violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim under the family or domestic violence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant funding and, in the case of victim services, includes the use or attempted use of physical abuse or sexual abuse, or a pattern of any other coercive behavior committed, enabled, or solicited to gain or maintain power and control over a victim, including verbal, psychological, economic, or technological abuse that may or may not constitute criminal behavior, by a person who —\n\n(A) is a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, or person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim;\n\n(B) is cohabitating, or has cohabitated, with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner;\n\n(C) shares a child in common with the victim; or\n\n(D) commits acts against a youth or adult victim who is protected from those acts under the family or domestic violence laws of the jurisdiction.\n\nDating violence means violence committed by a person—\n\n(A) who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and\n\n(B) where the existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors:\n\n(i) The length of the relationship.\n\n(ii) The type of relationship.\n\n(iii) The frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\n\nSexual Assault is any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent.\n\nStalking means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to— (A) fear for his or her safety or the safety of others; or (B) suffer substantial emotional distress.\n\nA woman filed a complaint against Michigan housing provider, Czapp Real Estate, LLC, alleging that they denied housing to her because of her disability and status as a survivor under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The Complainant alleged that the landlord did not respond to her rental application due to her vision impairment and because she revealed a past tenancy was terminated due to experiencing dating violence and stalking. Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, Czapp Real Estate, LLC, will pay the Complainant $8,500. Czapp Real Estate, LLC, will also take affirmative steps to ensure their policies, practices, and procedures comply with VAWA and the Fair Housing Act. The Conciliation Agreement further stipulates that the Czapp Real Estate, LLC, will require all its staff to attend VAWA-related training.\n\nRead the Conciliation Agreement\n\nThe Voluntary Agreement stems from a limited compliance review initiated by HUD in November 2022 under Section 504 for Greenbriar Apartments, a 208-unit development in Tennessee owned by Alco Greenbriar Partners, LP, whose general partner is Alco Properties, Inc. The property is managed by Alco Management, Inc., which manages over 50 multifamily properties throughout the Southeast. The property receives Project Based Rental Assistance through HUD Multifamily Housing.\n\nFollowing the limited compliance review, the Letter of Findings of Noncompliance was issued in April 2023, describing the housing providers’ effective denial of multiple reasonable accommodation or modification requests. HUD also uncovered instances of VAWA noncompliance involving households that experienced incidents of sexual assault and/or domestic violence. Two tenants requested VAWA emergency transfers and in both instances, the housing providers failed to provide the transfer or take any additional action needed to process the requests. Under the Voluntary Conciliation Agreement, the housing providers agree to pay the aggrieved parties $50,000 in monetary compensation. The housing providers will also amend its reasonable accommodation transfer log, revise the transfer policy, revise its VAWA policies, construct or convert ten UFAS-accessible units, with an additional four units for the hearing and visually impaired and accessible common areas, designate a VAWA Coordinator, respond to VAWA-related grievances and transfer requests within ten days, and attend VAWA training.\n\nRead the Conciliation Agreement VAWA Memo Letter of Findings\n\nHUD’s investigation found that a tenant who had a Housing Choice Voucher alleged that a Public Housing Agency in Nevada (“PHA”) and its Housing Specialist violated the complainant’s rights under VAWA when the complainant requested to relocate mid-lease as an emergency transfer after being stalked by a former partner. The complainant alleged that the housing provider demanded confusing and contradictory documentation that it was not permitted to request under VAWA, threatened to revoke the complainant’s voucher, denied her request to extend her voucher, and stopped paying its portion of the rent while the complainant prepared to move to protect her safety. HUD’s investigation indicated that the PHA’s policies and procedures did not comply with VAWA, including policies for documenting someone’s status as a VAWA survivor in general and, specifically, when an emergency transfer is requested. The PHA also lacked an emergency transfer plan, as required by VAWA. The agreement requires the housing provider to adopt and implement policies that comply with VAWA and will protect the VAWA rights of its applicants and residents, including that the PHA has an Emergency Transfer Plan that will allow survivors who qualify to move quickly without losing their assistance, to hire outside experts to provide VAWA training to staff, and to pay the complainant a monetary settlement.\n\nA woman filed a complaint alleging that a housing management company in CA, which is a recipient of funds under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (“HOME”) and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”), and a property manager violated her rights under VAWA by denying her application due to a history of violations of the terms of previous rental agreements that were related to her status as a survivor of dating violence. Although the housing providers denied that the tenant disclosed her status as a dating violence survivor, they acknowledged that they failed to accompany the denial letter with any information about her rights under VAWA, as required by law, and that they did not advise her about how she might appeal the denial. Under the terms of the agreement, the housing providers will pay the complainant a monetary settlement, place her on the top of the waitlist for the next available unit at two properties, notify her in writing when such a unit becomes available, revise their policies and procedures to comply with VAWA and protect the VAWA rights of applicants and tenants, establish a VAWA Rights Coordinator to handle VAWA matters and compliance, and require their employees to complete VAWA training annually.\n\nHousing provider refused to rent a unit to the survivor because she would not disclose her children’s Social Security Numbers due to domestic violence safety and privacy concerns. Housing provider agreed to pay $20,000 to the survivor, accept truncated Social Security Numbers, provide points of contact for housing availability, revise its policy to include VAWA protections and allow VAWA accommodations, allow those who were illegally denied housing due to VAWA protections to re-apply, display a HUD fair housing poster in the rental office, provide VAWA and fair housing training to staff, and cooperate with HUD in future fair housing monitoring.\n\nRead the Conciliation Agreement\n\nA local ordinance (referred to as the “Three Strikes Ordinance”) punished survivors each time police were called for domestic violence protection and forced their landlords to evict them under the guise of “disorderly conduct.” The City of Norristown was required to: provide a copy of the Conciliation Agreement with employees and retain a copy for public review; provide fair housing training to City staff and anyone interacting with victims of domestic violence; develop an education program and brochure regarding rights under the Fair Housing Act; repeal the Three Strikes Ordinance; partner with local anti-domestic violence advocates to raise awareness about domestic violence through a community service activity and conduct such activity annually; report housing discrimination complaints annually to HUD; and cooperate with HUD in future fair housing monitoring.\n\nRead the Conciliation Agreement\n\nUjima, Inc.: National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community\n\nA national resource center whose mission is to mobilize the community to respond to and end domestic, sexual and community violence within the Black community.\n\nNational Organization of Sisters of Color Ending Sexual Assault (SCESA)\n\nAn advocacy organization of Women of Color dedicated to working with the communities to create a just society in which all Women of Color are able to live healthy lives free of violence.\n\nNational Organization of Asians and Pacific Islanders Ending Sexual Assault (NAPIESV)\n\nA program under Monsoon Asians & Pacific Islanders in Solidarity, supporting local and international community-based programs and governmental organizations in enhancing their services to victims of sexual violence from the Asian and Pacific Islander communities in the U.S., U.S. Territories in the Pacific, and Asia."
