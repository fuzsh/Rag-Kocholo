        "text": "These are introductory answers to frequently asked questions about the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and our holdings and services.\n\nSelect a subject from the menu on the left to view questions and answers relating to your selection.\n\nLinks will guide you to further information on our website or other sources.\n\nAbout the National Archives\n\nWhat is the National Archives ?\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is the nation's record keeper. Of all documents and materials created in the course of business conducted by the United States federal government, only 1%-3% are so important for legal or historical reasons that they are kept by us forever.\n\nThose valuable records are preserved and are available to you, whether you want to see if they contain clues about your family's history, need to prove a veteran's military service, or are researching a historical topic that interests you.\n\nVisiting the National Archives\n\nDoing Research\n\nHow do I do research at the Archives?\n\nLearn more about how to do research at the National Archives.\n\nBorrowing NARA Materials\n\nDoes NARA lend original documents for research?\n\nNARA does not lend original documents for research use.\n\nOriginating federal agencies or successors in function; courts; and the President, Vice President, former Presidents or Vice Presidents or donors, or their designated representative may request loans of their own original holdings for the conduct of official business. Loans to originating agencies are limited to instances of demonstrated need when copies will not suffice and are subject to conditions that exempt from loan any holdings of high intrinsic value or in need of preservation action.\n\nDoes NARA lend original documents for exhibition use?\n\nYes, original documents or artifacts may be loaned to qualified institutions for exhibition when the purpose of the loan is to inform and educate the public about NARA, its holdings, or the national experience while ensuring their continued availability for the future. Exhibitions must be accessible to the public and may not be primarily political or commercial.\n\nBorrowers should submit a written request 180 days prior to the loan date and include an American Alliance of Museums or equivalent. NARA's security, fire protection, environmental, and transport requirements are intended to preserve and protect NARA's holdings and borrowers are expected to comply with them.\n\nRead the complete guidelines for borrowing materials\n\nCaptured German Records and the Berlin Document Center\n\nWhat is the Berlin Document Center?\n\nThe records of the Berlin Document Center consist of personnel and related records of the Nazi party (NSDAP) and its affiliated organizations and activities from the founding of the Party in 1920 until 1945.\n\nNARA holds more than 70,000 rolls of microfilm. See Holocaust-Related Records at the National Archives. Reference copies of the microfilm may be viewed free of charge in the Microfilm Research Room, National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.\n\nSelf-service copies from microfilm can also be made in the research room.\n\nHow do I get the records for someone who was in the SS or a member of the Nazi party?\n\nThis information can be located in Holocaust-Related Records at the National Archives.\n\nCensus Records\n\nHow do I get census records?\n\nDigital images of federal population census records, 1790–1950, can be found online on popular genealogy websites such as FamilySearch.org (free), Ancestry.com (fee), and others, and some census records are also available in the National Archives Catalog. For more information, see Census Records, Search Census Records Online and Other Resources, and the “Microfilm” section of Information for Researchers.\n\nMicrofilm copies of the 1790–1930 censuses are available for research at the National Archives Building in Washington, DC, and in selected regional field offices throughout the country.\n\nMost public libraries provide free online access to Ancestry.com and other subscription genealogy websites. In addition, some libraries and other research institutions purchased microfilm copies of federal censuses. Check with your local library or genealogical society to see if the census may be available on microfilm in your area.\n\nThe National Archives at College Park does not have census records.\n\nCan I order copies of census materials by mail?\n\nNARA will only copy exactly identified pages of the federal census. To use this service, you must provide the following:\n\ncensus year\n\nname of the individual listed1880\n\nexact page number\n\nstate\n\ncounty\n\nenumeration district (1880–1950 only)\n\nCopies of the exact census page can now be ordered online, as well as through the NATF Form 82 (National Archives Order for Copies of Census Records). Find the NATF Form 82 within this list of National Archives Forms.\n\nWhat if I don't know the exact page of the census?\n\nLocate the individual or household in which you are interested in online census images. Note the state, county, locality, and page number (1790–1870) or Enumeration District number and sheet number (1880–1950).\n\nAlternatively, you might be able to find census indexes in book form near you. Check with your local librarian or genealogical society. Private firms produced indexes to census records for specific years, generally 1790–1870. These are widely available throughout the country in libraries that have genealogical collections. In addition to these printed indexes, there are microfilm indexes to the 1900 and 1920 censuses and partial indexes to the 1880, 1910, and 1930 censuses available in some libraries.\n\nFrom these indexes, you can determine the exact page on which a family was enumerated. With that information, you can use the NATF Form 82 to order a copy of the page. Find the NATF Form 82 within this list of National Archives Forms.\n\nCharters of Freedom\n\nWhat are the Charters of Freedom?\n\nThe Charters of Freedom are the founding documents of the United States. They are the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.\n\nWhere can I get copies (reproductions) of the Charters of Freedom?\n\nPosters and reproductions are available for purchase. You may also download copies from this website.\n\nCongressional Records\n\nHow do I get U.S. House of Representatives or U.S. Senate committee records?\n\nRecords of Congress in NARA are held by the Center for Legislative Archives in the National Archives Building in Washington, DC.\n\nHow do I get U.S. House or U.S. Senate hearing testimony?\n\nSome hearing testimony is available at the Library of Congress. In addition, published hearing testimony is generally available through the Federal Depository Library system. There are approximately 1,350 federal depository libraries throughout the United States and its territories, at least one in almost every congressional district. All provide free public access to a wide variety of federal government information in both print and electronic formats and have expert staff available to assist users. You can find more information about this system on the Government Publishing Office website.\n\nDo you have footage of Congressional hearings and speeches from C-SPAN?\n\nC-SPAN is a private organization not affiliated with the government. You may contact C-SPAN directly.\n\nHow long do Congressional records stay closed?\n\nCongressional records remain closed for varying lengths of time depending upon several factors. More information is available in the Records of Congress section of our website.\n\nCopyright\n\nMay I reproduce images from your website?\n\nThe vast majority of the digital images in the National Archives Catalog are in the public domain. Therefore, no written permission is required to use them. We would appreciate your crediting the National Archives and Records Administration as the original source. For the few images that remain copyrighted, please read the instructions noted in the \"Use Restriction(s)\" field of each catalog record.\n\nPlease note that a few images on other areas of our website have been obtained from other organizations and that these are always credited. Permission to use these photographs should be obtained directly from those organizations.\n\nMay I reproduce other NARA records?\n\nIn general, all government records are in the public domain and may be freely used. We do have some donated or other materials that might be copyrighted. If you have questions about the records you are interested in, speak to the archivist or reference staff that handles those records.\n\nCan I get a signed permission form from NARA to use materials?\n\nNARA as a policy does not sign documents stating that particular records are not copyrighted because government records are in the public domain. For other materials, it is the user's responsibility to determine copyright.\n\nCourt Records\n\nWhat court records does NARA have?\n\nNARA has records of federal courts. For the most part, we do not have records from state or county courts. There are a few units that have some naturalizations from county courts. Federal court records are kept in the field facility that covers records from that state.\n\nThe one exception is the District of Columbia. These court records are in the National Archives Building in Washington, DC. Please contact us if you have questions and please include where the records were filed.\n\nHow do I use the National Archives to research bankruptcies?\n\nPlease see information on how to obtain bankruptcy records.\n\nWhere can I research Supreme Court decisions?\n\nMany sources exist for locating Supreme Court decisions both in print and electronic format.\n\nVisit the Supreme Court website. Textual Supreme Court records are also held in the National Archives Building in Washington, DC, while recorded oral arguments are in the National Archives at College Park. Please contact us if you have questions.\n\nMost research into Supreme Court decisions can be done with printed sources at Federal Depository Libraries. In addition, please be aware of the following caution from the Supreme Court concerning electronic versus print versions of decisions:\n\n\"Only the bound volumes of the United States Reports contain the final, official text of the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States. In case of discrepancies between the bound volume and any other version of a case--whether print or electronic, official or unofficial--the bound volume controls.\"\n\nDigitizing Projects at the National Archives\n\nCan you tell me about digitizing projects going on at the National Archives?\n\nNARA recognizes that the expectation of easy online access to our holdings continues to grow. Research is no longer relegated to libraries and research rooms but is being done around-the-clock on computers around the world. To meet this need, we will create, to the greatest extent possible, an “archives without walls.”\n\nWe are creating digital versions of selected records, including those most requested by researchers. Digitizing materials from our holdings improves access to those holdings and helps preserve and protect the original materials from excessive handling.\n\nTo help achieve those goals, we are in discussions with several private companies and non-profit organizations to explore mutually beneficial opportunities to digitize -- and make available -- our holdings. The resulting non-exclusive partnerships will become an important component of our effort to further expand online public access to our nation’s archival records.\n\nAs we expand and enter into more of these partnerships, we will provide news about these pilot and longer-term projects; see more information about Digitization at the National Archives.\n\nDocument Appraisal\n\nCan you tell me about or appraise my historic document?\n\nThe National Archives does not appraise or look at privately owned documents or artifacts. To find an appraiser in your area, you may wish to contact the ABAA (Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America).\n\nDocument Preservation\n\nHow do I preserve a photo or other family documents?\n\nPersonal documents are no less valuable than government records and care should be taken for their proper storage. You can find more information in How to Preserve Family Archives (papers and photographs).\n\nDonations\n\nDoes NARA purchase old, historic pictures or accept them as donations?\n\nNARA does not add to its holdings through purchase. We may accept offers of donations when the documentary materials involved are closely related to federal records already in our custody. When documentary materials don't have a close federal connection, we direct potential donors to other appropriate archival facilities.\n\nElectronic Records\n\nWhat is the Electronic Records Archives?\n\nIn the federal government, electronic records are as indispensable as their paper predecessors for documenting citizens' rights, the actions for which officials are accountable, and the nation's history. Effective democracy depends on access to such records.\n\nNARA has been at the forefront of archival practice and theory relating to electronic records ever since the agency first accessioned “flat-file” databases and ASCII records in 1970. NARA must continue to find ways to preserve and keep the millions of records being created in electronic forms accessible indefinitely. The Electronic Records Archives 2.0 (ERA 2.0) is NARA's vision for a cloud-based, comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means of preserving and providing continuing access to authentic electronic records over time. You can read more about the Electronic Records Archives on this website.\n\nFederal Regulations\n\nWhat is the CFR?\n\nCFR is the commonly used name for the Code of Federal Regulations, an annual codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government. The current edition is available on the U.S. Government Publishing Office website.\n\nYou can search the CFR and browse through the editions.\n\nThe CFR is also available in Federal Depository Libraries.\n\nFinding People\n\nCan NARA help me find someone?\n\nThe National Archives does not have information to help you locate living individuals. The records in the custody of NARA are usually at least 20–30 years old. Information on living individuals is protected by the Privacy Act. NARA records, therefore, are not helpful in providing current information about individuals.\n\nIn addition to this resource, there are many online telephone directories that may be useful for locating individuals. You can also find them via most of the popular Internet search engines.\n\nForms\n\nWhere can I find NARA forms?\n\nSee a list of some of our most commonly used forms at National Archives Forms.\n\nAdditional forms are available from our nationwide network of Archives facilities.\n\nNARA has close to 600 forms, and some forms change regularly. Forms last until the office that created them cancels them. If there is a particular form that you have used but can no longer locate, you may contact us for assistance in determining the form's status.\n\nGenealogy\n\nHow can NARA help me with genealogy research?\n\nThe National Archives is a treasure trove of materials that can be used to trace your family lineage. Information is available on Resources for Genealogists.\n\nHow do I get started with genealogy?\n\nExperts often suggest beginning with your oldest living relatives. Find out more on Beginning Your Genealogical Research.\n\nHow do I find ancestors of Native American descent?\n\nNARA holds a great deal of information useful in tracing Native American descent.\n\nWhere can I get a copy of my ancestor's passport?\n\nPassport applications can be an excellent source of genealogical information, especially about foreign-born individuals. NARA has passport applications from October 1795 through March 1925; the U.S. Department of State has passport applications from April 1925 to the present. More on Passport Applications.\n\nWhat is Soundex, and how does it work?\n\nThe Soundex is a coded surname (last name) index based on the way a surname sounds rather than the way it is spelled. Surnames that sound the same, but are spelled differently, like SMITH and SMYTH, have the same code and are filed together. The Soundex coding system was developed so that you can find a surname even though it may have been recorded under various spellings. Find more information on Soundex.\n\nHow do I research my family name?\n\nNARA is not able to help you with broad research on a family name. However, you can hire an independent researcher.\n\nHow do I research when my family entered the country?\n\nYou can find Passenger Arrival Records in the genealogy section's Immigration Records or Naturalization Records. When researching in this area, working backward from the present should provide you with a manageable time frame in which to conduct research.\n\nWhere can I get copies of ship passenger lists?\n\nNARA has some ship passenger arrival records.\n\nThere are many other sources for these records, including an online guide at the Library of Congress. Your local library, historical society, or genealogical society can be helpful. For online research, simply begin by choosing a search engine and entering the words \"ship passenger lists.\"\n\nCan I see Ellis Island or other immigration records online?\n\nNARA does not hold those records, but some Ellis Island records are available online from the Ellis Island Foundation.\n\nHow do I get a copy of a Homestead application?\n\nThe publication Research in the Land Entry Files of the General Land Office describes NARA's holdings on this topic.\n\nReproductions of land entry files (such as credit, cash, homestead, and mineral) or surrendered military bounty-land warrants files (Acts of 1788, 1812, 1847, 1850, and 1855) can now be ordered online, through the NATF Form 84. Find the NATF Form 82 within this list of National Archives Forms.\n\nHow can NARA help me trace my Canadian lineage?\n\nThe Fall 2000 issue of NARA's Prologue magazine describes the materials available for this topic. Please see the information on NARA's holdings related to Canadian border crossings.\n\nHow can NARA help me trace my Latin American lineage?\n\nPlease see the information on NARA's holdings related to Mexican border crossings.\n\nHow do I find information about a lighthouse or a lighthouse keeper?\n\nThe document Basic Search Path for Records Relating to Lighthouses describes NARA's holdings on this topic.\n\nHow do I find information about a postmaster?\n\nInformation on Postmaster Appointments can be found in Post Office Records.\n\nWhich military records should I use for genealogical research?\n\nNARA has many military records that can be used for this purpose.

Anyone can ask questions and get help from National Archives staff and other experts, history enthusiasts, and citizen archivists.\n\nLearn more about Getting Started and searching and asking a question on History Hub.\n\nLaws\n\nWhere can I find federal laws?\n\nThe general and permanent laws of the United States can be found in the U.S. Code.\n\nThe Office of the Federal Register's Public Laws is a good place to research, or sign up for email notification of, recently enacted laws.\n\nNew laws can be further researched at the Library of Congress. It has the complete text of laws from the most recent Congress back to the 101st Congress (1989–1990). You can find summary and status information, but not the full text, back to the 93rd Congress. (1973–1974). GPO Access' Legislative Information website provides additional information.\n\nThe first 42 Congresses (1789–1873) are available online in the Library of Congress' American Memory Project.\n\nFederal laws are codified in the United States Code, the most recent edition of which is available to search or browse.\n\nLaws that are not online are available in the printed Statutes at Large, which is available in the Federal Depository Libraries.\n\nWhere can I research State laws?\n\nState laws are generally available in larger public and academic libraries. In addition, most state codes are available on line at each state's website. State websites can be searched on the USA.Gov website.\n\nMissing or Stolen Federal Documents\n\nI have a document that may be a federal government record. I wonder if it should be in the National Archives. What should I do?\n\nOccasionally, a document in private hands actually belongs in a government archives. If it is a federal, congressional, or presidential record, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) may be interested in recovering the document. Learn more about missing or stolen documents. NARA also has tips online for identifying historical U.S. government documents.\n\nIf you know of a document that you believe is a federal record and belongs to the National Archives you can also contact us via e-mail at MissingDocuments@nara.gov.\n\nMotion Picture, Sound, and Video Recordings\n\nDoes NARA have motion picture, sound, and video recordings?\n\nSee Moving Image and Sound Holdings at the National Archives in College Park, MD\n\nOnline Records\n\nWhy aren't all the records online?\n\nNARA tries to make as many records as possible available online. This is a daunting task, even with records that were created in electronic format. More information on this effort is available at Digitization at the National Archives.\n\nThe volume of records in NARA's possession that pre-date electronic formats is so vast, that costs and resource availabilities will most likely preclude the conversion of all of them to electronic formats. However, as resources permit, NARA will continue to select records to be digitized and made available electronically.\n\nPanama Canal\n\nDo you have records from the construction of the Panama Canal?\n\nYes. Please contact us with a question about the specific records or information you are looking for.\n\nPhotocopies\n\nIs photocopying allowed at NARA?\n\nSelf-service copying by researchers is permitted under specified conditions in most research rooms, using:\n\nNational Archives in-house equipment such as a coin or card-operated electrostatic copiers and microfilm printers, and, less frequently, snapshot copiers, dubbing devices, and others;\n\nResearchers' own equipment ranging from cameras to scanners, that has been specifically approved by the National Archives for work with the records in question. See also our information on using scanners.\n\nMore details are available on the reproductions overview page.\n\nPresidential Materials\n\nI'm interested in Presidential materials such as speeches, proclamations, Executive Orders, etc. Where can I find them?\n\nPresidential materials are first published in the daily Federal Register. They are then issued by the Office of the Federal Register in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents. The Weekly Compilation is published every Monday by the Office of the Federal Register, and contains statements, messages, and other Presidential materials released by the White House during the preceding week. The White House website is also a useful source for current Presidential documents.\n\nPresidential materials are codified as Title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The publication is available in both electronic and print formats and can be found in Federal Depository Libraries. The online Weekly Compilation is full-text beginning with the Clinton Administration.\n\nExecutive Orders (EOs) can be difficult to research. The full text of EOs is available online beginning with the Clinton Administration. Bear in mind, however, that they are not static documents. They often change over time. In addition, they can be repealed or superseded by subsequent Executive Orders. The Executive Orders disposition tables on this site can be very helpful in locating an Executive Order and in determining its current status.\n\nExecutive Orders published between April 13, 1945, and January 20, 1989 can be found in the publication Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders. This document is out of print, but in addition to the online version, it can be found in most Federal Depository Libraries.\n\nFind a Federal Depository Library near you.\n\nExecutive Orders and Presidential Proclamations have also been commercially indexed and filmed on microfiche by the Congressional Information Service (CIS index to presidential Executive Orders & proclamations. Washington, DC: Congressional Information Service, 1986-). These indexes and/or microfiche may be available in a local library.\n\nOr visit a Presidential Library and learn more about their holdings and educational programs.\n\nSales Catalog\n\nDoes NARA have a sales catalog?\n\nSnippet\n\nShop the National Archives Store\n\nWhere can I get copies (reproductions) of items displayed in one of your exhibits (online or not)?\n\nNARA sells reproductions of some of the materials it exhibits. The Publications section describes the items available and provides ordering instructions.\n\nDo you sell exhibit catalogs?\n\nYes. NARA does sell catalogs for many of its exhibits.\n\nTreaties\n\nWhere can I find the text of a treaty?\n\nThe printed series U.S . Treaties and Other International Agreements is the best source. It is not online, but should be available in most Federal Depository Libraries.\n\nUntil 1948, treaties passed by the U.S. Senate appeared in the Statutes at Large, which should also be available in a depository library.\n\nVarious other compilations and sources also exist. These may be available in a local library. Other single treaties may be available online and can be found using your favorite search engine.\n\nUnited States Code\n\nWhat is the U.S. Code?\n\nThe U.S. Code is a consolidation and codification by subject matter of the general and permanent laws of the United States.\n\nHow do I get to an online copy of the U.S. Code?\n\nA searchable version can be found on the Office of the Law Revision Counsel website at the U.S. House of Representatives.

You do not need to be an American citizen or to present credentials or a letter of recommendation. Please refer to the NARA regulations as published in the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nCan I bring and use cameras, scanners, and laptops?\n\nIn the Washington area, you may bring equipment. All bags and carrying cases must be left in lockers outside of the research room.\n\nCameras may be used only with natural light.\n\nFlatbed scanners without sheet feeders are allowed. When you are using a scanner, you must show it to the research room staff and receive special instructions.
