VS issues such permits for the interstate transport of organisms, vectors, or derivatives thereof – including tissues and blood – which are infectious or contagious to livestock, poultry, or aquatic species or are treated, inoculated, or exposed to such pathogens. However, VS does not require an interstate transport permit for materials such as organism and vectors, and derivatives thereof, meeting the criteria described below (i.e., which are not infectious, contagious, or treated, inoculated or exposed to any livestock, poultry or aquatic pathogen).\n\nWhether VS requires a permit or not, the material may be regulated by other authorities, including local, State, or Federal regulatory agencies. The shipper and receiver are responsible for identifying and gaining approval from all applicable regulatory and oversight agencies.\n\nMaterials and Conditions Where an Interstate Transport Permit is Not Required:\n\nVS does not require an Organisms and Vectors permit (VS Form 16-6A, United States Veterinary Permit for Importation and Transportation of Controlled Materials and Organisms and Vectors) for the interstate transportation of:\n\nNon-pathogenic microorganisms not able to spread communicable disease to livestock, poultry, or aquatic animals.\n\nBiological agents (such as vaccines, bacterins, blood and blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, antibodies, gene therapy, tissues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins) not capable of introducing or disseminating infectious diseases to livestock, poultry, or aquatic animals.\n\nToxins or toxoids that are not infectious (able to multiply) or able to spread communicable disease to livestock, poultry, or aquatic animals.\n\nSamples from animals or aquaculture systems not confirmed as infected by laboratory testing, not exposed to or suspected of illness caused by an infectious pathogen, and not experimentally infected with organisms or vectors.\n\nInactivated forms of pathogens.\n\nViable or dead insect vectors – excluding screwworms and other arthropods such as ticks – of livestock, poultry, or aquatic animal pathogens reared in a U.S. laboratory colony, not known to have been exposed to or to carry pathogens on the VS Pathogen List.\n\nProcedures\n\nShipping Materials Without an Interstate Transport Permit\n\nVS recommends that shippers sending materials for which VS does not require an interstate transport permit provide the recipient a written statement describing the material, including genus and species (if applicable). The statement should also affirm the material is not a pathogen of livestock, poultry, or aquatic animals; and (if applicable) describe the inactivation or extraction method for any deactivated materials.\n\nObtaining a Permit Application\n\nIf the material does not meet the above conditions, the recipient may need a permit. The recipient may obtain an application for a permit (VS Form 16-3).\n\nUSDA APHIS VS Permit applications can be submitted by any of the following ways:\n\nOnline via eFile: https://efile.aphis.usda.gov/s/\n\nBy e-mail: Submit a completed VS 16-3 (found on Animal Health Permits) to apie@usda.gov\n\nContact us at apie@usda.gov or 301-851-3300 with questions/concerns.\n\nAdditional information on application submission and payment is available at the Organisms and Vectors web page."
