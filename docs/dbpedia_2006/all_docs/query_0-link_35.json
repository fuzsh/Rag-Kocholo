        "text": "(a) Considerations. In soliciting competition, the contracting officer shall consider the guidance in 13.104 and the following before requesting quotations or offers:\n\n(1)\n\n(i) The nature of the article or service to be purchased and whether it is highly competitive and readily available in several makes or brands, or is relatively noncompetitive.\n\n(ii) An electronic commerce method that employs widespread electronic public notice is not available; and\n\n(iii) The urgency of the proposed purchase.\n\n(iv) The dollar value of the proposed purchase.\n\n(v) Past experience concerning specific dealers’ prices.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) When soliciting quotations or offers, the contracting officer shall notify potential quoters or offerors of the basis on which award will be made (price alone or price and other factors, e.g., past performance and quality).\n\n(ii) Contracting officers are encouraged to use best value.\n\n(iii) Solicitations are not required to state the relative importance assigned to each evaluation factor and subfactor, nor are they required to include subfactors.\n\n(iv) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3206(c), for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard—\n\n(A) The contracting officer may choose not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for award when a solicitation—\n\n(1) Has an estimated value above the simplified acquisition threshold;\n\n(2) Will result in multiple-award contracts (see subpart 16.5) that are for the same or similar services; and\n\n(3) States that the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors (see 2.101).\n\n(B) If the contracting officer chooses not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for the contract award, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the contracting officer shall consider price or cost as one of the factors in the selection decision for each order placed under the contract.\n\n(C) The exception in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section shall not apply to solicitations for multiple-award contracts that provide for sole source orders pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 637(a)).\n\n(v) Except for DoD, contracting officers shall ensure the criteria at 15.101-2(c)(1)-(5) are met when using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.\n\n(vi) Except for DoD, avoid using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to acquire certain supplies and services in accordance with 15.101-2(d).\n\n(b) Soliciting from a single source.\n\n(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(i) Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization).\n\n(ii) Where a single source is identified to provide a portion of a purchase because that portion of the purchase specifies a particular brand-name item, the documentation in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section only applies to the portion of the purchase requiring the brand-name item. The documentation should state it is covering only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name.\n\n(2) For purchases exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. The requirements at 13.501(a) apply to sole-source (including brand-name) acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5.\n\n(3) See 5.102(a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand-name justification or documentation.\n\n(c) Soliciting orally.\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall solicit quotations orally to the maximum extent practicable, if-\n\n(i) The acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold;\n\n(ii) Oral solicitation is more efficient than soliciting through available electronic commerce alternatives; and\n\n(iii) Notice is not required under 5.101.\n\n(2) However, an oral solicitation may not be practicable for contract actions exceeding $25,000 unless covered by an exception in 5.202.\n\n(d) Written solicitations. If obtaining electronic or oral quotations is uneconomical or impracticable, the contracting officer should issue paper solicitations for contract actions likely to exceed $25,000. The contracting officer shall issue a written solicitation for construction requirements exceeding $2,000.\n\n(e) Use of options. Options may be included in solicitations, provided the requirements of subpart 17.2 are met and the aggregate value of the acquisition and all options does not exceed the dollar threshold for use of simplified acquisition procedures.\n\n(f) Inquiries. An agency should respond to inquiries received through any medium (including electronic commerce) if doing so would not interfere with the efficient conduct of the acquisition.\n\n(a) General.\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall evaluate quotations or offers-\n\n(i) In an impartial manner; and\n\n(ii) Inclusive of transportation charges from the shipping point of the supplier to the delivery destination.\n\n(2) Quotations or offers shall be evaluated on the basis established in the solicitation.\n\n(3) All quotations or offers shall be considered (see paragraph (b) of this subsection).\n\n(b) Evaluation procedures.\n\n(1) The contracting officer has broad discretion in fashioning suitable evaluation procedures. The procedures prescribed in parts 14 and 15 are not mandatory. At the contracting officer’s discretion, one or more, but not necessarily all, of the evaluation procedures in part 14 or 15 may be used.\n\n(2) If telecommuting is not prohibited, agencies shall not unfavorably evaluate an offer because it includes telecommuting unless the contracting officer executes a written determination in accordance with FAR 7.108(b).\n\n(3) If using price and other factors, ensure that quotations or offers can be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion. Formal evaluation plans and establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, and scoring quotations or offers are not required. Contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance-\n\n(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and\n\n(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:\n\n(A) The contracting officer’s knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;\n\n(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;\n\n(C) The Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) at https://www.cpars.gov; or\n\n(D) Any other reasonable basis.\n\n(4) For acquisitions conducted using a method that permits electronic response to the solicitation, the contracting officer may-\n\n(i) After preliminary consideration of all quotations or offers, identify from all quotations or offers received one that is suitable to the user, such as the lowest priced brand name product, and quickly screen all lower priced quotations or offers based on readily discernible value indicators, such as past performance, warranty conditions, and maintenance availability; or\n\n(ii) Where an evaluation is based only on price and past performance, make an award based on whether the lowest priced of the quotations or offers having the highest past performance rating possible represents the best value when compared to any lower priced quotation or offer.\n\n(a) Basis for award. Before making award, the contracting officer must determine that the proposed price is fair and reasonable.\n\n(1) Whenever possible, base price reasonableness on competitive quotations or offers.\n\n(2) If only one response is received, include a statement of price reasonableness in the contract file. The contracting officer may base the statement on-\n\n(i) Market research;\n\n(ii) Comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases;\n\n(iii) Current price lists, catalogs, or advertisements. However, inclusion of a price in a price list, catalog, or advertisement does not, in and of itself, establish fairness and reasonableness of the price;\n\n(iv) A comparison with similar items in a related industry;\n\n(v) The contracting officer’s personal knowledge of the item being purchased;\n\n(vi) Comparison to an independent Government estimate; or\n\n(vii) Any other reasonable basis.\n\n(3) Occasionally an item can be obtained only from a supplier that quotes a minimum order price or quantity that either unreasonably exceeds stated quantity requirements or results in an unreasonable price for the quantity required. In these instances, the contracting officer should inform the requiring activity of all facts regarding the quotation or offer and ask it to confirm or alter its requirement. The file shall be documented to support the final action taken.\n\n(b) File documentation and retention. Keep documentation to a minimum. Purchasing offices shall retain data supporting purchases (paper or electronic) to the minimum extent and duration necessary for management review purposes (see subpart 4.8). The following illustrate the extent to which quotation or offer information should be recorded:\n\n(1) Oral solicitations. The contracting office should establish and maintain records of oral price quotations in order to reflect clearly the propriety of placing the order at the price paid with the supplier concerned. In most cases, this will consist merely of showing the names of the suppliers contacted and the prices and other terms and conditions quoted by each.\n\n(2) Written solicitations (see 2.101). For acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, limit written records of solicitations or offers to notes or abstracts to show prices, delivery, references to printed price lists used, the supplier or suppliers contacted, and other pertinent data.\n\n(3) Special situations. Include additional statements, when applicable—\n\n(i) Explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source);\n\n(ii) Supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier; and\n\n(iii) Except for DoD, when using lowest price technically acceptable source selection process, justifying the use of such process.\n\n(c) Notification. For acquisitions that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and for which automatic notification is not provided through an electronic commerce method that employs widespread electronic public notice, notification to unsuccessful suppliers shall be given only if requested or required by 5.301.\n\n(d) Request for information. If a supplier requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the contract award decision shall be provided (see 15.503(b)(2)).\n\n(e) Taxpayer Identification Number. If an oral solicitation is used, the contracting officer shall ensure that the copy of the award document sent to the payment office is annotated with the contractor’s Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and type of organization (see 4.203), unless this information will be obtained from some other source (e.g., centralized database). The contracting officer shall disclose to the contractor that the TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the contractor’s relationship with the Government ( 31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).\n\n(a) Except as provided under the unpriced purchase order method (see 13.302-2), purchase orders generally are issued on a fixed-price basis. See 12.207 for acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.\n\n(b) Purchase orders shall-\n\n(1) Specify the quantity of supplies or scope of services ordered;\n\n(2) Contain a determinable date by which delivery of the supplies or performance of the services is required;\n\n(3) Provide for inspection as prescribed in part 46. Generally, inspection and acceptance should be at destination. Source inspection should be specified only if required by part 46. When inspection and acceptance will be performed at destination, advance copies of the purchase order or equivalent notice shall be furnished to the consignee(s) for material receipt purposes. Receiving reports shall be accomplished immediately upon receipt and acceptance of supplies;\n\n(4) Specify f.o.b. destination for supplies to be delivered within the United States, except Alaska or Hawaii, unless there are valid reasons to the contrary; and\n\n(5) Include any trade and prompt payment discounts that are offered, consistent with the applicable principles at 14.408-3.\n\n(c) The contracting officer’s signature on purchase orders shall be in accordance with 4.101 and the definitions at 2.101. Facsimile and electronic signature may be used in the production of purchase orders by automated methods.\n\n(d) Limit the distribution of copies of purchase orders and related forms to the minimum deemed essential for administration and transmission of contractual information.\n\n(e) In accordance with 31 U.S.C.3332, electronic funds transfer (EFT) is required for payments except as provided in 32.1110. See subpart 32.11 for instructions for use of the appropriate clause in purchase orders. When obtaining oral quotes, the contracting officer shall inform the quoter of the EFT clause that will be in any resulting purchase order.\n\n(a) Each purchase order (and each purchase order modification (see 13.302-3)) shall incorporate all clauses prescribed for the particular acquisition.\n\n(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.213-2, Invoices, in purchase orders that authorize advance payments (see 31 U.S.C.3324(d)(2)) for subscriptions or other charges for newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or other publications (i.e., any publication printed, microfilmed, photocopied, or magnetically or otherwise recorded for auditory or visual usage).\n\n(c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.213-3, Notice to Supplier, in unpriced purchase orders.\n\n(d)\n\n(1) The contracting officer may use the clause at 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions-Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services;), in simplified acquisitions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold that are for other than commercial products or commercial services (see 12.301).\n\n(2) The clause-\n\n(i) Is a compilation of the most commonly used clauses that apply to simplified acquisitions; and\n\n(ii) May be modified to fit the individual acquisition to add other needed clauses, or those clauses may be added separately. Modifications (i.e., additions, deletions, or substitutions) must not create a void or internal contradiction in the clause. For example, do not add an inspection and acceptance or termination for convenience requirement unless the existing requirement is deleted. Also, do not delete a paragraph without providing for an appropriate substitute.\n\n(3)\n\n(i) When an acquisition for supplies for use within the United States cannot be set aside for small business concerns and trade agreements apply (see subpart 25.4), substitute the clause at 52.225-3, Buy American-Free Trade Agreements-Israeli Trade Act, used with the appropriate Alternate (see 25.1101(b)(1)), instead of the clause at 52.225-1, Buy American-Supplies.\n\n(ii) When acquiring supplies for use outside the United States, delete clause 52.225-1 from the clause list at 52.213-4(b).\n\n(4) When the senior procurement executive allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for the contract in accordance with 25.101(d), so that the initial domestic content threshold will apply to the entire period of performance, the contracting officer shall fill in the 52.213-4(b)(1)(xvii)(B) for 52.225-1 Alternate I as follows: For contracts that the contracting officer estimates will be awarded in calendar year 2022 or 2023, the contracting officer shall insert “60” in paragraph (1)(ii)(A) of the definition of domestic end product. For contracts that the contracting officer estimates will be awarded in calendar year 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, or 2028, the contracting officer shall insert “65”. For contracts that the contracting officer estimates will be awarded after calendar year 2028 the contracting officer shall insert “75”.\n\n(a) The following are circumstances under which contracting officers may establish BPAs:\n\n(1) There is a wide variety of items in a broad class of supplies or services that are generally purchased, but the exact items, quantities, and delivery requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably.\n\n(2) There is a need to provide commercial sources of supply for one or more offices or projects in a given area that do not have or need authority to purchase otherwise.\n\n(3) The use of this procedure would avoid the writing of numerous purchase orders.\n\n(4) There is no existing requirements contract for the same supply or service that the contracting activity is required to use.\n\n(b) After determining a BPA would be advantageous, contracting officers shall-\n\n(1) Establish the parameters to limit purchases to individual items or commodity groups or classes, or permit the supplier to furnish unlimited supplies or services; and\n\n(2) Consider suppliers whose past performance has shown them to be dependable, who offer quality supplies or services at consistently lower prices, and who have provided numerous purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(c) BPAs may be established with-\n\n(1) More than one supplier for supplies or services of the same type to provide maximum practicable competition;\n\n(2) A single firm from which numerous individual purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold will likely be made in a given period; or\n\n(3) Federal Supply Schedule contractors, if not inconsistent with the terms of the applicable schedule contract.\n\n(d) BPAs should be prepared without a purchase requisition and only after contacting suppliers to make the necessary arrangements for-\n\n(1) Securing maximum discounts;\n\n(2) Documenting individual purchase transactions;\n\n(3) Periodic billings; and\n\n(4) Incorporating other necessary details.\n\nPrepare BPAs on the forms specified in 13.307. Do not cite accounting and appropriation data (see 13.303-5(e)(4)).\n\n(a) The following terms and conditions are mandatory:\n\n(1) Description of agreement. A statement that the supplier shall furnish supplies or services, described in general terms, if and when requested by the contracting officer (or the authorized representative of the contracting officer) during a specified period and within a stipulated aggregate amount, if any.\n\n(2) Extent of obligation. A statement that the Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under the BPA.\n\n(3) Purchase limitation. A statement that specifies the dollar limitation for each individual purchase under the BPA (see 13.303-5(b)).\n\n(4) Individuals authorized to purchase under the BPA. A statement that a list of individuals authorized to purchase under the BPA, identified either by title of position or by name of individual, organizational component, and the dollar limitation per purchase for each position title or individual shall be furnished to the supplier by the contracting officer.\n\n(5) Delivery tickets. A requirement that all shipments under the agreement, except those for newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals, shall be accompanied by delivery tickets or sales slips that shall contain the following minimum information:\n\n(i) Name of supplier.\n\n(ii) BPA number.\n\n(iii) Date of purchase.\n\n(iv) Purchase number.\n\n(v) Itemized list of supplies or services furnished.\n\n(vi) Quantity, unit price, and extension of each item, less applicable discounts (unit prices and extensions need not be shown when incompatible with the use of automated systems, provided that the invoice is itemized to show this information).\n\n(vii) Date of delivery or shipment.\n\n(6) Invoices. One of the following statements shall be included (except that the statement in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this subsection should not be used if the accumulation of the individual invoices by the Government materially increases the administrative costs of this purchase method):\n\n(i) A summary invoice shall be submitted at least monthly or upon expiration of this BPA, whichever occurs first, for all deliveries made during a billing period, identifying the delivery tickets covered therein, stating their total dollar value, and supported by receipt copies of the delivery tickets.\n\n(ii) An itemized invoice shall be submitted at least monthly or upon expiration of this BPA, whichever occurs first, for all deliveries made during a billing period and for which payment has not been received. These invoices need not be supported by copies of delivery tickets.\n\n(iii) When billing procedures provide for an individual invoice for each delivery, these invoices shall be accumulated, provided that-\n\n(A) A consolidated payment will be made for each specified period; and\n\n(B) The period of any discounts will commence on the final date of the billing period or on the date of receipt of invoices for all deliveries accepted during the billing period, whichever is later.\n\n(iv) An invoice for subscriptions or other charges for newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall show the starting and ending dates and shall state either that ordered subscriptions have been placed in effect or will be placed in effect upon receipt of payment.\n\n(b) If the fast payment procedure is used, include the requirements stated in 13.403.\n\n(a) Use a BPA only for purchases that are otherwise authorized by law or regulation.\n\n(b) Individual purchases shall not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. However, agency regulations may establish a higher threshold consistent with the following:\n\n(1) The simplified acquisition threshold and the $7.5 million limitation for individual purchases ($15 million for purchases entered into under the authority of 12.102(f)(1)) do not apply to BPAs established in accordance with 13.303-2(c)(3).\n\n(2) The limitation for individual purchases for commercial products and commercial services acquisitions conducted under subpart 13.5 is $7.5 million ($15 million for acquisitions as described in 13.500(c)).\n\n(c) The existence of a BPA does not justify purchasing from only one source or avoiding small business set-asides. The requirements of 13.003(b) and subpart 19.5 also apply to each order.\n\n(d) If, for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall-\n\n(1) Solicit quotations from other sources (see 13.105) and make the purchase as appropriate; and\n\n(2) Establish additional BPAs to facilitate future purchases if-\n\n(i) Recurring requirements for the same or similar supplies or services seem likely;\n\n(ii) Qualified sources are willing to accept BPAs; and\n\n(iii) It is otherwise practical to do so.\n\n(e) Limit documentation of purchases to essential information and forms as follows:\n\n(1) Purchases generally should be made electronically, or orally when it is not considered economical or practical to use electronic methods.\n\n(2) A paper purchase document may be issued if necessary to ensure that the supplier and the purchaser agree concerning the transaction.\n\n(3) Unless a paper document is issued, record essential elements (e.g., date, supplier, supplies or services, price, delivery date) on the purchase requisition, in an informal memorandum, or on a form developed locally for the purpose.\n\n(4) Cite the pertinent purchase requisitions and the accounting and appropriation data.\n\n(5) When delivery is made or the services are performed, the supplier’s sales document, delivery document, or invoice may (if it reflects the essential elements) be used for the purpose of recording receipt and acceptance of the supplies or services. However, if the purchase is assigned to another activity for administration, the authorized Government representative shall document receipt and acceptance of supplies or services by signing and dating the agency specified form after verification and after notation of any exceptions."
