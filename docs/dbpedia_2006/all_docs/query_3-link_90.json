        "text": "Donald Trump's campaign team has accused polls showing Vice President Kamala Harris beating him of being \"fake\" and \"manipulated\" to favor the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nBrian Hughes, a senior Trump campaign adviser, lashed out at a recent survey from CBS News and YouGov that showed Harris with a 1-point lead over Trump nationallyâ€”50 percent to 49 percent. On average, the pair is tied with 50 percent each across several key swing states.\n\nIn his statement, Hughes shared a memo that said the poll of 3,102 registered voters sampled more liberals and fewer conservatives than a previous survey, and that Trump would be leading 51 percent to 49 percent if weighted correctly.\n\n\"The Fake News Media continue to help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft on crime policies. Now, as this analysis shows they'll even put a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results for her,\" Hughes said.\n\nHe continued: \"This analysis is why the American people are seeing through it and will not allow this national gaslighting campaign to win. Despite this manipulated result, from CBS/YouGov it's worth noting that in July and August of 2020, their data showed Biden leading by 10 nationally, reflecting a net positive movement of almost +10 to President Trump this election cycle.\"\n\nThe CBS News/YouGov poll is the latest survey that shows Harris leading Trump in the 2024 race, overturning the deficit recorded by President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race on July 21.\n\nA number of polling aggregators show that Harris has overtaken Trump in terms of national averages.\n\nFiveThirtyEight's national average poll tracker has Harris ahead of Trump by 1.6 percentage points, 45.3 percent to 43.7 percent.\n\nPollster Nate Silver, who founded the polling aggregator and now uses a similar methodology in his predictions, is also showing that Harris is ahead of Trump on average, 45.5 percent to 44.1 percent.\n\nThe Polling USA social media account, which aggregates national surveys, has Harris with a 1.7 percent lead over Trump as of August 4.\n\nThe memo shared by Trump's team also said that the latest CBS News/YouGov poll was \"entirely the result of a methodological decision allowing ideology to change significantly, while maintaining weights on age, partisanship, and race to make the survey appear not to have been manipulated.\"\n\nBill Mitchell, a conservative political pundit, expressed a similar sentiment on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"Why do people keep acting like these polls aren't completely fake? Folks these polls are completely fake. Imagine if I put out a poll with an R+8 sample,\" Mitchell wrote. \"Trump would be ahead by 10 points. Do you think the media would notice that. Of course.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted CBS News and YouGov for comment via email.\n\nTrump has long cited polls showing him beating Biden in the 2024 race as proof of his popularity and a signal that he is the favorite to retake to White House.\n\nOn X, political commentator Ed Krassenstein, a frequent Trump critic, commented on the change of opinion about polling numbers among the former president's supporters.\n\n\"MAGA is breaking down. They are back to calling the polls fake just because they don't reflect what they want them to say,\" Krassenstein wrote. \"It's funny how they touted the polls when Trump was up.\""
