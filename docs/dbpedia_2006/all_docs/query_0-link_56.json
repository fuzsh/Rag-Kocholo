Why use this guide?\n\nThis guide will help you to find records created by the Foreign Office since its birth in 1782, and by its successor, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and now held at The National Archives.\n\nThe records of the Foreign Office provide a wealth of information on British relations with foreign states from 1782 to the present day and can also provide insights into the history of domestic issues in countries around the world.\n\nThe guide provides advice on the different ways in which you will need to use our own catalogue as well as the indexes and registers created by the Foreign Office itself to find individual records. There is also advice on how to find treaties dating back to 1695 and now held among Foreign Office records.\n\n2. What were the Foreign Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office?\n\n4. Armed with the details of the relevant entries from the register, return to the advanced catalogue search to identify and order the relevant volume of correspondence, using the country name AND “embassy and consulates” AND “general correspondence” as keywords, and restrict to the relevant year.\n\n5. The volumes of correspondence (an example is shown below) are arranged by author and recipient, then by date. Within the relevant volume, look for the despatch number."
