        "text": "General Provisions\n\nWhat is the Pathways Programs framework?\n\nThe Pathways Programs framework consists of three separate programs that give students and recent graduates access to federal internships and potential federal careers through Schedule D excepted service appointments:\n\nInternship Program: Provides high school, undergraduate, and graduate students with opportunities for paid work in agencies and to explore Federal careers while still in school. Applicants must be enrolled at least part-time in school or an educational program (including Registered Apprenticeship Programs and certain volunteer service programs). Interns must complete a minimum of 480 internship hours (320 hours if they receive a waiver) to be eligible for conversion to the competitive service.\n\nRecent Graduates Program: Provides recent graduates with one- to two-year developmental experiences in Federal agencies. Applicants must have graduated from a qualifying educational institution or career or technical education program. Individuals must apply within two years of completing a degree or certificate. (Veterans unable to apply due to service obligations have up to six years after degree completion to apply.)\n\nPresidential Management Fellows (PMFs): Provides advanced degree candidates and graduates the opportunity to participate in the Federal government’s premier two-year leadership development program. Individuals must apply within two years of completing an advanced degree, defined as a masters, professional (for example, law), or doctorate. PMFs are assigned a mentor, participate in professional development, and complete at least 160 hours of formal, interactive training, an Individual Development Plan, and at least one developmental, rotational assignment.\n\nWhere are the Pathways Programs regulations codified?\n\nThese regulations can be found in 5 CFR parts 362, 213, 302, and 315.\n\nGeneral rules for all Pathways Programs are codified in 5 CFR part 362, subpart A.\n\nRules specific to the Internship Program are codified in 5 CFR part 362, subpart B.\n\nRules specific to the Recent Graduates Program are codified in 5 CFR part 362, subpart C.\n\nRules specific to the PMF Program are codified in 5 CFR part 362, subpart D.\n\nGeneral provisions about Schedule D of the excepted service are codified in 5 CFR 213.3401-2.\n\nRegulations governing how to fill excepted service positions, including how to apply veterans’ preference, are codified at 5 CFR part 302.\n\nAgencies are advised to refer to these provisions before filling jobs under the Pathways Programs and to confer with their counsel if they have any questions.\n\nEligibility\n\nWhat are the eligibility requirements for the Pathways Internship Program?\n\nTo be eligible, applicants must be:\n\nAccepted for enrollment or enrolled and seeking a degree (diploma, certificate, etc.) at a qualifying educational institution, on at least a half-time basis (as defined by the institution); or\n\nAccepted for enrollment or enrolled in a qualifying career or technical education program that awards a recognized postsecondary credential (such as a Registered Apprenticeship Program or Job Corps).\n\nUnder this program, an individual who needs to complete less than a half-time equivalent of an academic/vocational or technical courseload immediately prior to graduating is still eligible.\n\nWhat are the eligibility requirements for the Pathways Recent Graduate Program?\n\nTo be eligible, an individual must have obtained an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, professional, doctorate, vocational, or technical degree, or a certificate from a qualifying educational institution, or have completed a qualifying career or technical education program within the previous 2 years.\n\nWhat types of programs would meet the eligibility criteria for a qualifying career or technical education program?\n\nThree types of programs meet these criteria:\n\nFederally administered educational programs that provide rigorous academic content, technical skill proficiency, and a recognized postsecondary credential to prepare the individual for further education and/or a career in a current or emerging profession;\n\nRegistered Apprenticeship Programs; and\n\nFederally administered local, state, national, or international volunteer service programs.\n\nWhat is a Federally administered career or technical education program?\n\nA Federally administered career or technical education program is subject to programmatic oversight by a federal agency that includes:\n\nThe nature and scope of work to be performed by participants,\n\nThe type(s) and scope of training to be provided to participants,\n\nThe types of skills participants will acquire or develop during the program (e.g., teaching, environmental, business, scientific, public health/health care, languages),\n\nThe level and extent of mentoring participants will receive, and\n\nThe metrics for successful completion of the program.\n\nProgrammatic oversight may be reflected in partnership or cooperative agreements.\n\nWhat types of documentation may an agency accept when determining eligibility for the Internship Program?\n\nAn agency may accept a transcript (official or unofficial), a copy of the diploma, or other written documentation from the educational institution or career or technical education program (such as a letter confirming enrollment or acceptance into a qualifying educational program).\n\nWhat types of documentation may an agency accept when determining eligibility for the Recent Graduate Program?\n\nAn agency may accept a transcript (official or unofficial), a copy of the diploma, or other written documentation from the educational institution or career and technical education program. The documentation must be sufficient to allow the agency to determine that the eligibility criteria in 5 CFR 362.302 has been met. Such information includes but is not limited to:\n\nThe applicant’s name\n\nThe name of the degree or career or technical education program\n\nDate the degree or career or technical education program was or will be completed\n\nInformation on the length of the program for those meeting the eligibility criteria based on the completion of a certificate or participation in a Federally administered volunteer service program\n\nMust applicants have completed their educational degree requirements or career and technical education programs to be eligible to apply to the Recent Graduates Program?\n\nNo. Students who have not completed their educational degree requirements or career and technical education programs may apply and be considered for a Recent Graduates job in the weeks/months prior to the job being filled. These individuals must, however, meet the definition of a recent graduate in 5 CFR 362.302 prior to appointment.\n\nIn addition, agencies can choose to accept applications from individuals who will complete education by a certain cutoff, for example, announcement closing, date certificate issued, appointment date. Any such conditions must be established in the agencies’ Pathways policy and in the agencies’ application procedures under 5 CFR 302.301.\n\nWhat constitutes a valid certificate program for purposes of eligibility under the Pathways Programs?\n\nThe Pathways Programs regulation (see 5 CFR 362.102) defines certificate program as post-secondary education at either:\n\na qualifying educational institution (trade or vocational school, 2-year or 4-year college or university, or graduate or professional school) equivalent to at least one academic year of full-time study that is part of an accredited college-level, technical, trade, vocational, or business school curriculum; or\n\na qualifying career or technical education program of at least one year that awards a recognized postsecondary credential.\n\nMust candidates be U.S. citizens or Nationals at the time they are appointed to the Internship, Recent Graduates, or PMF Program?\n\nIt depends. There is no overarching requirement that applicants for positions in the excepted service be U.S. citizens. Many agencies, however, are restricted from paying non-citizens by their annual appropriations legislation or other agency-specific enabling statutes. Each agency will need to consider whether any such restrictions apply to it, in conjunction with its agency counsel. Moreover, an agency may appoint a non-citizen to a Pathways Program position only if the student or recent graduate is lawfully admitted to the United States as a permanent resident or is otherwise authorized to be employed. A Pathways intern, recent graduate, or fellow must possess full U.S. citizenship by the end of the Program to be eligible for consideration for non-competitive conversion to permanent Federal employment in the competitive service.\n\nPublic Notification\n\nWhat options are available to satisfy the public notification requirement under the Pathways Programs?\n\nAn agency may satisfy the Pathways Programs public notification requirement (found in 5 CFR 326.104(c)(6)(iii) and 362.105(b)), in 2 ways:\n\nPosting a searchable announcement on USAJOBS.gov; or\n\nPosting job information with a link to a USAJOBS custom job announcement on the agency’s public-facing career or job information web page.\n\nWhen using either of these options agencies are also encouraged to use additional recruitment and advertisement activities such as postings on third-party websites and/or social media.\n\nAgencies post PMF appointment opportunities when recruiting finalists for PMF positions on the PMF Program’s Talent Management System (TMS).\n\nWhat information must be included in a job announcement for a Pathways Internship position?\n\nAt a minimum, agencies’ job opportunity announcements or custom postings for Internship or Recent Graduate Programs positions must include:\n\nPosition title, series and grade of the position(s) being filled\n\nStarting salary of the position\n\nGeographic location(s) of the position(s) being filled\n\nMinimum qualifications of the position\n\nInformation about how to apply or a link to the agency’s website for more information and instructions for submitting an application\n\nReasonable Accommodation statement\n\nInformation about how to claim veterans’ preference\n\nInformation about the possibility of conversion to permanent appointment (if applicable)\n\nPromotion potential (if applicable)\n\nOPM also recommends inclusion of the following information in job opportunity announcements:\n\nBrief description of duties of the job(s) to be filled\n\nAvailable work schedules for the job(s) to be filled\n\nLinks to Pathways Programs information\n\nAvailability of relocation expenses or recruitment incentives (if applicable)\n\nBrief description of duties of the job(s) to be filled\n\nAvailable work schedules for the job(s) to be filled\n\nInformation about the possibility of conversion to permanent appointment (if applicable)\n\nPromotion potential (if applicable)\n\nLinks to Pathways Programs information\n\nAvailability of relocation expenses or recruitment incentives (if applicable)\n\nCan an agency advertise at a career fair (or host its own), accept applications only at that event, without providing public notification of the event?\n\nNo. Agencies must provide public notification (as described above) when recruiting and accepting applications for Pathways internship or recent graduate positions. Additionally, the agency must post an adequate alternative method of applying for candidates who do not attend the career fair or other event.\n\nWhat options does an agency have to manage its Pathways job announcement to avoid situations where the response to the USAJOBS announcement is an unmanageably high number of applications?\n\nAgencies have several options for managing the Pathways job announcement process so that it does not result in receiving an unmanageably high number of applications, including:\n\nLimiting the announcement open period. Agencies have discretion to determine the length of time a Pathways Program job opportunity announcement is open. When doing so, agencies should give consideration to the type of position, grade level, and geographic location of the position being filled. For example, an Internship not-to-exceed (NTE) administrative position in a remote location with a nearby campus being filled at the GS-4 level for the summer months may not need to be open as long as a scientific or technical Internship position being filled at the GS-11 level at the Department headquarters location.\n\nLimiting the number of applications received. Agencies have the discretion to set ‘cut-offs’ or limits (e.g., the first 75 or 100 applications received) on the number of applications it will consider when filling a given Pathways position. When using such limits, OPM strongly encourages agencies to accept any applications received up until 11:59 p.m. of the day the limit is reached (to accommodate applicants in non-Eastern time zones).\n\nUsing specific eligibility requirements for entrance into your agency’s Pathways Programs. With respect to your agency’s Intern Program, you may use requirements such as the ability to work a specified number of hours each week or be in good academic standing (i.e., maintenance of a minimum grade point average (GPA)) as eligibility criteria. [Note: Agencies may not require the completion of educational requirements for specific coursework for occupations that do not have a positive education requirement.] In addition, agencies may require that applicants affirm their ability to work in the specific location(s) listed in the announcement.\n\nAn agency's procedures for receiving applications (see 5 CFR 302.201) must address the use of these options. Additionally, when one or more of limitations are used the agency must state the limitation in the Pathways job opportunity announcements. Agencies must consider the merit systems principles when posting notices and consider whether the notice and time allowed will provide for a fair and open competition that assures that potential applicants for the position will receive fair and equitable treatment. Consultation with agency counsel is always desirable.\n\nCustom Postings\n\nWhat is a USAJOBS custom posting?\n\nA USAJOBS custom posting is a USAJOBS announcement that may only be accessed using a unique link or URL. The job posting is stored in USAJOBS but is not searchable on USAJOBS. If the Apply Online option is enabled on the custom job posting, the applicant can see their application status in USAJOBS, and the agency also receives post-audit applicant flow data to inform hiring trends.\n\nHow can an agency use a USAJOBS custom posting to meet the Pathways public notification requirement?\n\nThe use of a USAJOBS custom posting meets the Pathways public notification requirement when the agency shares the custom posting link with the public by posting it on the agency’s website. Agencies may also find it useful to share the custom posting link in other recruiting and advertising materials such as a third-party website.\n\nWhen would an agency want to use a USAJOBS custom posting?\n\nOPM encourages agencies to post Pathways job announcements using a standard USAJOBS posting for all student and recent graduate jobseekers to see. However, if the hiring agency does not want to use a traditional USAJOBS announcement for the Pathways job announcements, OPM permits agencies to use a custom job posting, and the hiring agency can receive applicant flow data as with a traditional USAJOBS announcement.\n\nHow is a USAJOBS custom posting created?\n\nThe custom job posting is created in the Talent Acquisition System (TAS). Once the posting is created, the HR specialist receives a unique URL that can be shared on social media platforms, agency career sites, or third-party job boards.\n\nWhere can an agency find more information on using a USAJOBS custom posting?\n\nFor specific steps on how to create a custom posting, reach out to your agency’s Talent Acquisition System (TAS) point of contact. Additional custom job posting questions can be sent to recruiter-help@usajobs.gov.\n\nRecruitment\n\nCan agencies conduct outreach prior to (or without) posting a USAJOBS announcement or custom posting?\n\nYes. Agencies have the discretion to conduct outreach on campuses before (or without) posting a USAJOBS announcement. These may be informational/awareness-type events or liaison activities.\n\nCan agencies use strategic outreach and recruitment efforts to build a diverse applicant pool?\n\nAs part of a broad overall recruitment plan, agencies may conduct strategic recruitment activities to enhance the diversity and size of the applicant pool. Agencies should ensure that such activities are one part of an overall recruitment plan, and that public notice of the opportunities is available to everyone.\n\nIf an agency decides to hold or attend an on-campus recruitment event at which it will accept applications for filling Pathways Program positions, what information must be in the announcement publicizing the event on USAJOBS or the agency’s public-facing career or job information web page?\n\nThe following information must be included in the announcement:\n\nLocation, date, and time of the event\n\nAny relevant information on how to access the event location (including reasonable accommodation information for persons with disabilities)\n\nPosition title, series, and grade of the job(s) to be filled\n\nGeographic location of the job(s) to be filled\n\nA public source (such as a link on the agency’s webpage) that contains information about how to attend the event and how to apply if interested parties cannot attend the event.\n\nInformation about how to claim veterans’ preference when applying.\n\nWhat are some effective practices agencies should follow when recruiting for Pathways positions?\n\nOPM encourages agencies to:\n\nBase their recruitment strategy on workforce planning\n\nConduct strategic recruitment with a variety of talent sources to attract qualified applicants from all segments of society\n\nRecruit from a diverse spectrum of campuses or schools prior to announcing and filling jobs through the Pathways Programs\n\nEnsure on-campus recruitment events are open to all, not just students at that campus. (Note that agencies must provide an adequate alternative means of applying and should provide any additional information about the opportunity that would be helpful to a potential applicant who is unable to attend the on-campus event.)\n\nTo the extent practicable, agencies should conduct outreach events to make students and recent graduates aware of the USAJOBS website, the Federal Internship Portal (https://intern.usajobs.gov/), and the Recent Graduate Portal (https://recentgrad.usajobs.gov/) and encourage them to apply for positions when they become available.\n\nWhen conducting on-campus recruitment, agencies should consider the proximity of the campus to the actual location of the job to be filled. The commute must be feasible for students to benefit from the event.\n\nWhat are some effective practices agencies should follow when recruiting for Pathways positions?\n\nOPM encourages agencies to:\n\nBase their recruitment strategy on workforce planning\n\nConduct strategic recruitment with a variety of talent sources to attract qualified applicants from all segments of society\n\nRecruit from a diverse spectrum of campuses or schools prior to announcing and filling jobs through the Pathways Programs\n\nEnsure on-campus recruitment events are open to all, not just students at that campus. (Note that agencies must provide an adequate alternative means of applying and should provide any additional information about the opportunity that would be helpful to a potential applicant who is unable to attend the on-campus event.)\n\nTo the extent practicable, agencies should conduct outreach events to make students and recent graduates aware of the USAJOBS website, the Federal Internship Portal (https://intern.usajobs.gov/), and the Recent Graduate Portal (https://recentgrad.usajobs.gov/) and encourage them to apply for positions when they become available.\n\nWhen conducting on-campus recruitment, agencies should consider the proximity of the campus to the actual location of the job to be filled. The commute must be feasible for students to benefit from the event.\n\nVeterans’ Preference and Pass Overs\n\nAre agencies required to apply veterans’ preference when making selections for Pathways Programs positions?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 5 CFR 362.105(c)(2), each agency is required to apply veterans’ preference when filling positions using the Pathways Programs.\n\nHow is veterans’ preference applied when filling jobs under the Pathways Programs?\n\nAgencies must apply veteran’s preference in accordance with the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 3320 and 5 CFR 302, and any applicable agency policy. How veterans’ preference is applied depends upon the selection method the agency chooses to use when filling its Pathways jobs. In accordance with 5 CFR part 302, agencies can generally choose from among three selection methods when filling jobs in the excepted service: the ranked list, the unranked list, or a category rating-like process.\n\nRanked list – This method works the same as the ‘rule of three’ rating-and-ranking process used in the competitive service. Individuals are assessed against criteria which produces a numerical score. Preference eligibles who earn a passing score receive 5 or 10 points, as appropriate, which are added to their score. Applicants are then listed in score order and selection is made from the highest-ranked three names available on the list. Preference eligibles with a 10 percent or more disability are placed at the top of the list, and thus achieve the highest ranks. Agencies cannot select a non-preference eligible veteran over a preference eligible veteran with an equal or higher score without going through the applicable pass over procedures.\n\nUnranked list – Applicants who meet basic eligibility criteria are listed by veterans’ preference category: 10 percent or more disabled veterans, other 10-point preference eligible veterans, 5-point preference eligible veterans, and then non-preference eligible veterans. An agency must consider the candidates in the highest preference group first. Agencies cannot select a non-preference eligible veteran until the preference eligibles are exhausted or the agency has gone through the proper pass over procedures with respect to the preference eligibles that are remaining.\n\nCategory rating- like process – Under 5 CFR part 302.105, agencies may establish their own systems for applying veterans’ preference provided that such a system results in preference eligible applicants receiving at least as much advantage as they would under the numerical ranking or unranked selection methods. Out of convenience, many agencies have adopted a category rating-like process. This method works the same way as category rating does in the competitive service. Rather than using numerical scores, individuals are assessed against agency-established criteria and placed in one of two or more pre-defined quality categories. Preference eligibles are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles in the quality category into which they are placed. Preference eligibles with a 10 percent or more disability are placed in the highest quality category (ahead of the non-preference eligibles). An agency must make its selection from the highest quality category. An agency cannot select a non-preference eligible over a preference eligible veteran until the preference eligibles in the top category are exhausted, or the agency has gone through the applicable pass over procedures with respect to the preference eligibles that are remaining in that top group. An agency may select any preference eligible veteran in the highest quality category.\n\nIf fewer than three people are in the highest quality category, the agency can merge the highest and second highest quality category into a new category – provided that all preference eligible veterans from both categories are listed ahead of the non-preference eligibles in the newly merged category.\n\nProfessional Order – When filling professional and scientific positions at the GS-9 level and above, the rules differ slightly. Agencies may list applicants either in a ranked list by score order or in an unranked list by preference status. When a ranked list is used, preference eligibles who earn a passing score will have an additional 5 or 10 points, as appropriate, added to their score. Applicants are then listed in score order (i.e., nobody “floats”), and selection is made from the highest-ranked three names available on the list. When an unranked list is used all qualified preference eligibles will be listed in order of preference status (which will consist of candidates eligible for 10-point veterans’ preference followed by candidates eligible for 5-point veterans’ preference), followed by all other qualified applicants. An agency must consider preference eligibles in the highest preference group first. An agency may not consider a non-preference eligible until all preference eligibles have been exhausted or the agency has gone through the proper pass over procedures with respect to the preference eligibles who are remaining.\n\nWhat are the procedures for passing over a preference eligible veteran who has a compensable disability of less than 30 percent in the excepted service?\n\nA preference eligible veteran, who does not have a compensable disability of 30 percent or more, can be eliminated from consideration only if the agency sustains the selecting official’s objection to the preference eligible for adequate reason. These reasons, which must be recorded, include reasons based upon the criteria for medical disqualification under 5 CFR Part 339, reasons based upon the criteria for making suitability determinations listed at 5 CFR 731.202, or other reasons considered by the agency. Agencies should be mindful of 5 U.S.C. 3320 and 5 CFR 332.406 in considering reasons for passing over a preference eligible and should consult with their counsel concerning whether a given reason is likely to meet the standard of making selections “in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service” standard set out in section 3320. OPM must approve the sufficiency of an agency reason to medically disqualify or pass over a preference eligible to select a non-preference eligible or to object to or pass over a candidate based upon medical reasons. The preference eligible (or his or her representative) is entitled to a copy of the agency’s reason(s) for the pass over, upon request.\n\nWhat are the procedures for passing over a preference eligible veteran who has a compensable disability of 30 percent or more in the excepted service?\n\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3312 and 5 CFR 339.102(c) and 332.406, the following special provisions apply to medically disqualifying a disabled veteran with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, based on inability to perform the physical requirements of the position:\n\nThe agency must at the same time notify, in writing, both OPM and the disabled veteran of the reasons for its desire to disqualify the disabled veteran and of the veteran’s right to respond to OPM within 15 days of the date of the notification.\n\nThe agency must provide evidence to OPM that the notice was timely sent to the disabled veteran’s last known address.\n\nOPM must make a determination on the disabled veteran’s physical ability to perform the duties of the position, taking into account any additional information provided by the veteran. The agency must submit sufficient evidence to support its request, including evidence that a reasonable accommodation is not possible, and that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the position without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others.\n\nOPM may ask the agency to submit more detailed information in support of its request.\n\nIf OPM agrees that the veteran cannot fulfill the physical requirements of the position, the agency may select another qualified person from the certificate of eligibles. If OPM finds the veteran able to perform the job, the agency may not pass over the veteran on the basis of inability to perform the physical requirements.\n\nThis procedure does not stop the agency from filling a position if it has more than one position to fill from the same certificate and holds open a position that could be filled by the individual against whom a request has been filed.\n\nOPM will notify the agency and the disabled veteran of its decision, with which the agency must comply.\n\nOPM is prohibited by law from delegating these functions to any agency.\n\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3318 and 5 CFR 332.406, the following special provisions apply to passing over a disabled veteran with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, for nonmedical reasons:\n\nThe agency must at the same time notify, in writing, both OPM and the disabled veteran of the reasons for its desire to pass over the disabled veteran and of the veteran’s right to respond to OPM within 15 days of the date of the notification.\n\nThe agency must provide evidence to OPM that the notice was timely sent to the disabled veteran’s last known address.\n\nOPM will determine if the request was for a proper and adequate reason under its regulations, and the sufficiency of the evidence presented, taking into account any additional information provided by the veteran.\n\nOPM may ask the agency to submit more detailed information in support of its request.\n\nIf OPM sustains the pass over request, the agency may select another qualified person from the certificate of eligibles. If OPM does not sustain the request, the agency may not pass over the veteran on the basis of the reason presented.\n\nThis procedure does not stop the agency from filling a position if it has more than one position to fill from the same certificate and holds open a position that could be filled by the individual against whom a request has been filed.\n\nOPM will notify the agency and the preference eligible or disabled veteran of its decision, with which the agency must comply.\n\nOPM is prohibited by law from delegating these functions to any agency.\n\nCan an agency use the Schedule A hiring authority for People with Intellectual Disabilities, Severe Physical Disabilities, and Psychiatric Disabilities to appoint a person with a disability to a position in the Pathways Program?\n\nNo. The Schedule A hiring authority cannot be used to fill Pathways Programs positions. The Pathways Programs hiring authority is Schedule D. The Pathways Programs and the Schedule A authority for persons with disabilities are two separate hiring authorities with separate eligibility requirements and hiring processes. An applicant with a disability may apply to positions in the Pathways Programs by following the instructions found in the job opportunity announcement on USAJOBS (external link). When doing so, students with disabilities are considered for Pathways Programs positions in the same manner as other, non-disabled students in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR part 302. An agency is, of course, required to provide reasonable accommodations, as required by law, and may wish to consult with counsel or its human resources office concerning such matters.\n\nQualifications and Assessments\n\nAre agencies required to use assessments as part of the selection process?\n\nFor the Internship and Recent Graduate Programs, agencies must use valid job-related assessments such as crediting plans, which are the same thing as rating schedules (i.e., occupational questionnaires) or structured interviews. Agencies may also use the Administrative Careers With America (ACWA) rating schedules when making selections for Pathways Programs positions. Depending on the selection methodology used to fill a particular job (see 5 CFR part 302), agencies may assess only for general eligibility/minimum qualifications. OPM uses assessments to establish a list of finalists for the PMF Program.\n\nThe Pathways regulations require recent graduates to meet OPM Qualification Standards. Does this mean agency-specific qualification standards may not be used for the Recent Graduates Program?\n\nYes. Agencies may not develop their own qualification standards for positions filled through the Pathways Recent Graduates Program. Agencies must use the OPM or OPM-approved qualification standards for the position being filled (or any qualification standards for the position required by law, if applicable).\n\nAre agencies required to use OPM Qualification Standards for Pathways Internship Positions?\n\nNo. Agencies may establish agency-specific qualification requirements, or use the OPM qualification requirements for the competitive service in place of the Group Coverage Qualification Standard for Schedule D, Pathway Internship Positions. (See 5 CFR 362.303(d))\n\nAre agencies required to use assessments as a part of the selection process?\n\nFor the Intern and Recent Graduate Programs, agencies must use valid job-related assessments such as crediting plans, which are the same thing as rating schedules (i.e., occupational questionnaires) or structured interviews. Agencies may also use the Administrative Careers With America (ACWA) written test or ACWA rating schedules when making selections for Pathways Programs positions. Depending on the selection methodology used to fill a particular job (see 5 CFR part 302), agencies may assess only for general eligibility/minimum qualifications. OPM assesses for a list of Finalists for the Fellows Program.\n\nPromotions and Reassignments\n\nAre Interns eligible for promotion without public notification and competition?\n\nYes. An intern appointed without a not to exceed (NTE) date may be promoted when an agency has an excepted service policy for promotion of employees in excepted service positions and the intern meets the qualification requirements for the higher-graded position. An intern NTE is similar to a temporary employee and is not eligible for a promotion.\n\nCan an agency reassign an intern with an NTE date to an intern position without public notification and competition?\n\nAn agency may appoint an intern NTE to a different position, but first the agency must provide minimum public notification (internal to the agency – not on USAJOBS) to similarly situated agency interns who may also be interested in the intern position. If more than one individual is interested, the agency must apply the selection procedures under 5 CFR part 302 – including the application of veterans’ preference and pass over procedures. This applies whether the intern position is a position with a career ladder, with a different job series, with a different series with a career ladder, or is the same series and grade level as the intern NTE position.\n\nCan an agency reassign an intern to another intern position without public notification and competition?\n\nAgencies must follow their own policies for movement of excepted service personnel, and the intern must meet the qualification requirements for the position to which he or she will be reassigned.\n\nCan an agency reassign Recent Graduates to another position within the same agency without public notification and competition?\n\nAgencies must follow their own policies for movement of excepted service personnel, and the Recent Graduate must meet the qualification requirements for the position to which he or she will be reassigned.\n\nAre Interns, Recent Graduates and PMFs subject to the time-in-grade limitations in 5 CFR 300 subpart F prior to being promoted?\n\nNo. Employees in Pathways Programs positions are not subject to time-in-grade limits. Time-in-grade limits only apply to movement to or within the competitive service. However, interns, recent graduates and PMFs must meet the qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade level. Promotions are never an entitlement, and agencies must have an excepted service policy in place that covers promotions for positions in the excepted service.\n\nTraining\n\nAre all Pathways interns required to have an individual development plan (IDP)?\n\nIn accordance with 5 CFR 362.203(i), OPM requires that agencies provide all interns with appropriate training and development activities regardless of the length of the appointment. OPM recommends that agencies ensure that within 45 days of appointment, interns appointed for an initial period expected to last more than 1 year and intern NTEs appointed for more than 90 days document their activities in a training plan, Individual Development Plan (IDP), or a Pathways Participant Agreement approved by their supervisor.\n\nWhat types of training activities should agencies provide for Pathways interns?\n\nAppropriate training opportunities for interns may include but are not limited to:\n\non-the-job training activities\n\nformal training classes\n\nmentoring sessions\n\ntesting products or tools\n\nassisting colleagues with projects or tasks\n\nCan interns and recent graduates participate in temporary detail assignments at another agency?\n\nYes, at the discretion of the home agency.\n\nConversion to the Competitive Service\n\nHow have the requirements for the conversion of an intern to a position in the competitive service changed?\n\nThe final rule lengthens the time period allowed for agencies to convert interns from 120 days to 180 days after the completion of a degree. OPM has also reduced the minimum number of hours required for conversion from 640 hours to 480 hours. However, an agency may require more than the minimum of 480 hours for conversion, as described below.\n\nUnder the Pathways Internship Program, when does the 180-day clock for non-competitive conversion to the competitive service begin? Does it start when the student completes their academic requirements or upon graduation (i.e., when the academic institution confers the degree, which could be several weeks or months later)?\n\nThe 180-day clock for non-competitive conversion starts when the student completes their educational requirements (as determined by the educational institution or career and technical education program). Agencies should defer to the educational institution for a determination of when degree or educational program requirements have been met.\n\nHow are current interns who have recently completed a degree affected by the change extending the conversion period to 180 days following completion of degree requirements?\n\nThe change to allow an agency 180 days instead of 120 days for intern conversion goes into effect on June 11, 2024. An intern who has not yet met the 120-day limit on this date may be converted within 180 days of the completion of their degree instead of 120 days. For example, if an intern completed their degree on May 4, 2024, the deadline for conversion under the 120-day provision would have been September 1, 2024. Since this date is after the effective date of the final rule, the new 180-day period will apply and the agency will now have until October 31, 2024, to convert the intern.\n\nThe requirement for an intern to complete a minimum of 640 work hours to be eligible for conversion to the competitive service has been lowered to 480 work hours. Is an agency allowed to require more than 480 work hours for intern conversion?\n\nYes. An agency may require more than 480 work hours and may set different higher minimums for different positions. An agency must specify the minimum number of hours required for conversion in the agency’s Pathways Policies.\n\nWhat are the criteria for approving a waiver for the intern work hour requirement as allowed by 5 CFR 362.204(d)?\n\nAn agency may waive up to one-half of the minimum service hour requirement provided the intern has completed at least 320 hours of career-related work experience under a Pathways Internship Program appointment with exceptional job performance and demonstrates high potential in an academic or career and technical education program. In other words, an intern must work at least 320 hours before the agency can waive any time towards the required 480 hours. The maximum amount of time an agency may waive is 160 hours (if using a 480 minimum) or up to 320 hours (if using a minimum of 640 hours or more). Here are some examples of how it would work:\n\nExample 1: An intern works 320 hours as a Pathways intern, the agency may waive 160 hours of the required 480.\n\nExample 2: An intern works 420 hours as a Pathways intern, the agency may waive 60 hours of the required 480.\n\nExample 3: An intern works 220 hours as a Pathways intern, the agency cannot yet waive any of the required 480 hours needed for conversion. If the intern is able to work up to 320 hours before completing their educational program, then at that time the agency could approve a waiver.\n\nExample 4: The agency has set a minimum service hour requirement of 640 hours. An intern works 320 hours as a Pathways intern, the agency may waive 320 hours of the required 640.\n\nExample 5: The agency has set a minimum service hour requirement of 800 hours. An intern works 480 hours as a Pathways intern, the agency may waive 320 hours of the required 800 hours.\n\nHow does an agency determine that an intern has shown exceptional job performance when considering a waiver for the intern work hour requirement?\n\nExceptional job performance means a formal evaluation conducted by the student’s internship supervisor(s), consistent with the agency performance appraisal program, that results in a rating of record (or summary rating) of higher than fully successful or equivalent.\n\nWhen considering a waiver for the intern work hour requirement how does an agency determine that an intern has demonstrated high potential in an academic or career and technical education program?\n\nAn intern can demonstrate high potential in an academic or career and technical education program by attaining at least one of the following:\n\nan overall grade point average of 3.5 or better, on a 4.0 scale;\n\nstanding in the top 10 percent of the student’s graduating class;\n\ninduction into a nationally recognized scholastic honor society; or\n\na letter of recommendation from an instructor or program administrator attesting to the intern’s outstanding performance.\n\nWhat is the criteria for granting credit toward the Internship work hour requirement for non-Federal internship experience?\n\nAn agency may grant credit for up to half of the minimum service work hour requirement for Pathways interns who have completed service in non-Federal internships at a federal agency through a third-party internship provider provided the intern has completed at least 320 hours of career-related work experience under a Pathways Internship Program appointment. In other words, an intern must work at least 320 hours before the agency can credit any time towards the required 480 hours (or other minimum set by an agency). The maximum amount of time an agency may credit is 160 hours (if using a 480 minimum) or up to 320 hours (if using a minimum of 640 hours or more). Here are some examples of how it would work:\n\nExample 1: Intern completes a non-Federal internship then is hired under Pathways. They’ve worked 320 hours as a Pathways intern. The agency may credit 160 hours from the non-federal internship to reach the required 480.\n\nExample 2: Intern completes a non-Federal internship then is hired under Pathways. They’ve worked 420 hours as a Pathways intern. The agency may credit 60 hours from the non-federal internship to reach the required 480.\n\nExample 3: Intern completes a non-Federal internship then is hired under Pathways. They’ve worked 220 hours as a Pathways intern. Because they have not yet worked 320 as a Pathways Intern, the agency cannot credit any time towards the required 480 hours needed for conversion at this time. If the intern is able to work up to 320 hours before completing their educational program, then at that time the agency could approve the crediting of hours.\n\nExample 4: The agency has set a minimum service work hour requirement of 640 hours. Intern completes a non-Federal internship then is hired under Pathways. They’ve worked 420 hours as a Pathways intern. The agency may credit 220 hours from the non-federal internship to reach the required 640.\n\nExample 5: The agency has set a minimum service work hour requirement of 800 hours. Intern completes a non-Federal internship then is hired under Pathways. They’ve worked 420 hours as a Pathways intern. The agency can credit up to 320 hours from the non-federal internship towards the required 800 hours needed for conversion at this time.\n\nWhat documentation should an agency consider when approving a waiver of the Internship work hour requirement?\n\nWhen approving a waiver an agency should consider documentation that demonstrates that the intern has exceptional job performance and demonstrates high potential in an academic career and technical education program. Examples of acceptable documentation include but are not limited to:\n\nPerformance rating (rating of record or summary rating) of higher than Fully Successful or equivalent, and one of the following:\n\nOfficial or unofficial transcript showing an overall grade point average of 3.5 or better, on a 4.0 scale or standing in the top 10 percent of the student's graduating class;\n\nLetter of acceptance into a nationally recognized scholastic honor society;\n\nLetter of recommendation attesting to the intern’s outstanding program performance from an instructor or program administrator.\n\nCan an agency non-competitively convert a Pathways intern to the Pathways Recent Graduates Program, upon successful completion of the intern’s academic requirements?\n\nNo, individuals on Pathways Internship appointments are eligible only for consideration for non-competitive conversion to positions in the competitive service, and only if all applicable program requirements are met. The intent of the Pathways Internship Program is to develop individuals for potential placement into the permanent workforce, or to provide them with an opportunity to explore Federal careers while still in school, but not to effectuate placement into yet another developmental program. As a reminder, per 5 CFR 362.303(a), public notification is required prior to filling positions in the Pathways Recent Graduates Program.\n\nAre employees on Internship and Recent Graduate appointments eligible for conversion to excepted service positions or only to competitive service positions?\n\nBy definition, and as provided in Executive Order 13562, the Pathways authorities are to be used as an exception to filling positions that would normally be filled through a competitive process. Accordingly, non-competitive conversion means assignment to a position in the competitive service. The Pathways Programs Executive Order and implementing regulations do not provide for conversion to an excepted service position for intern or recent graduate positions.\n\nMay an intern NTE be converted to a position in the competitive service?\n\nYes, an intern NTE may be non-competitively converted to a position in the competitive service provided the job opportunity announcement used to fill the intern NTE position stated the conversion potential and all other requirements for conversion have been met. However, the conversion of an intern NTE should be rare as intern NTE positions are to be used to complete temporary projects, perform labor-intensive tasks not requiring subject-matter expertise, or fill traditional summer jobs.\n\nWhen an intern completes their academic requirements and is eligible to graduate, does the agency have an obligation to convert the intern to a position in the competitive service within the agency?\n\nNo. An agency is not required to convert any individual in a Pathways position to a position in the competitive service, whether upon completion of program requirements or otherwise. Conversion to a competitive service position is not an entitlement. An agency does, however, have the discretion to convert an intern if the job opportunity announcement used to fill the intern position stated the conversion potential and all other requirements for conversion have been met.\n\nDo intern NTEs have a 180-day grace period following graduation from college to remain in program?\n\nNo. In accordance with 5 CFR 362.205 the appointment of intern NTE ends when the temporary appointment expires. However, the agency may convert the intern NTE before expiration of the original appointment if that date is within 180 days of the completion of degree requirements provided the job opportunity announcement used to fill the intern NTE position described this conversion potential and all other requirements for conversion have been met.\n\nMay an agency retain (without providing Public Notification or competition) a participant in the Internship Program after graduation if the intern is accepted into another qualifying educational program during the 180-day administrative period allowed for conversion to the competitive service?\n\nYes. In accordance with 5 CFR 362.203(b), an agency may retain an intern or intern NTE following graduation if the intern also has been accepted into another qualifying degree program at the time of graduation. It is not uncommon, for example, for students who graduate from college to immediately begin a master’s or professional degree program. In such situations, the acceptance into another qualifying educational program means the student maintains eligibility for employment as an intern. In these situations, public notification and competition are not required for the participant to continue in the agency’s Internship program.\n\nMay individuals participating in the Internship Program be non-competitively converted to a position that has an established career ladder?\n\nYes. An individual participating in the Internship who otherwise meets the program requirements for conversion (work hours, satisfactory performance, educational requirements, training completed, etc.) may be converted to a position with an established career ladder provided the job opportunity announcement for the position stated the career ladder. For instance, an intern GS-0299-04 Human Resources Trainee may be non-competitively converted to a GS-0201-05/7/9/11 Human Resources Specialist career ladder position.\n\nIs an intern required to serve a trial period?\n\nAn intern is not required to serve a trial period unless an agency has a policy that requires employees in the excepted service to serve a trial period.\n\nAre employees on Pathways Internship and recent graduate appointments eligible for conversion to excepted service positions or only to competitive service positions?\n\nBy definition, and as provided in Executive Order 13562, the Pathways authorities are to be used as an exception to filling positions that would normally be filled through a competitive process. Accordingly, non-competitive conversion means assignment to a position in the competitive service. The Pathways Programs Executive Order and implementing regulations do not provide for conversion to an excepted service position for intern or recent graduate positions.\n\nCan agencies convert interns, recent graduates, or PMFs to either term or permanent appointments?\n\nYes. interns, recent graduates, or PMFs who have completed all requirements for conversion may be non-competitively converted to term or permanent positions. When non-competitively converted to a term appointment, the agency may subsequently non-competitively convert the individual to a permanent competitive service position at any time before the term appointment expires. The option to convert the individual to a term appointment is provided in accordance with the Executive Order 13562 to allow flexibility when budgetary or other resource constraints would prevent an agency from converting an employee to a permanent position at the time the employee successfully completes the program.\n\nConversion at a Different Agency\n\nMay an intern be converted to a term or permanent position in a different agency?\n\nYes, an intern (who meets the requirements for conversion) may be converted to a term or permanent position in a different agency.\n\nAre there any resources available to help interns find positions in a different agency when the employing agency is unable to convert them?\n\nYes. The Pathways Internship Talent Program is available to help connect Pathways interns who are unable to be converted in their current agencies with employment opportunities at other agencies. The Pathways Internship Talent Program is found in the USAJOBS Agency Talent Portal (ATP).\n\nOnce an agency has informed the intern that the agency is not able to convert them, the intern will be offered the opportunity to participate in the Pathways Internship Talent Program. Agencies with early career positions available may use the Pathways Internship Talent Program to recruit interns for conversion to permanent and term positions.\n\nFor more information on the Pathways Internship Talent Program, Pathways interns and agency hiring managers should contact their agency Pathways Program Officer, and Pathways Program Officers should contact pathways@opm.gov. Agency hiring managers and Pathways Program Officers may visit the ATP Help Center for more information on the USAJOBS Agency Talent Portal.\n\nMay a recent graduate be converted to a term or permanent position in a different agency?\n\nYes, a recent graduate (who meets the requirements for conversion) may be converted to a term or permanent position in a different agency when the employing agency is unable to convert the recent graduate. The reasons for conversion at another agency may include but are not limited to unforeseen budgetary constraints, reorganizations, abolishment of positions, completion of cohort-based Pathways programs, or other appropriate reasons.\n\nMay an agency extend a recent graduate appointment to allow time for conversion to a position at another agency?\n\nYes, an agency may extend a recent graduate appointment for up to 120 days to allow time for the recent graduate to be converted to a position at a different agency. However, there is no allowance for extensions beyond 120 days.\n\nIf a recent graduate is being converted to a permanent position in another agency may the recent graduate be converted to a position with a career ladder?\n\nA recent graduate may be converted to a position with a career ladder in a different agency. The position at the new agency must have a full performance level that is equivalent to or less than the position they would have been converted to at the prior agency.\n\nTermination of Appointments\n\nIn general, as a condition of employment, an intern appointment expires 180 days after the completion of the academic course of study, unless the intern is selected for non-competitive conversion to the competitive service. If the agency is not planning to convert the intern, can the agency terminate the intern prior to the end of the 180 days?\n\nTermination as a condition of employment only occurs when the intern is separated at the end of the 180-day period after completion of the academic degree requirement. If the termination occurs before the end of the 180-day period, the agency must determine if the intern meets the definition of “employee” in chapter 75 of title 5 and is entitled to appeal rights before taking any action to remove the intern. If it is determined that the intern has appeal rights, then the adverse actions procedures in 5 CFR 752 would apply to a termination occurring prior to the end of the 180-day period.\n\nAs a condition of employment an intern appointment expires 180 calendar days after completion of the designated academic course of study or career and technical education program, unless the Participant is selected for non-competitive conversion under § 362.204.\n\nDo the reduction in force (RIF) rules apply to a recent graduate who is terminated when his or her appointment expires?\n\nNo. 5 CFR 362.306(a) states that the expiration of a Recent Graduates appointment is not subject to the RIF requirements in 5 CFR 351.\n\nPathways Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Agency Policy\n\nAre agencies required to provide MOUs and Pathways Policies to OPM?\n\nOPM has replaced the use of an MOU with a requirement that an agency must have a Pathways Policy in accordance with § 362.104 to make appointments under the Pathways authority. Similar to the MOU, the agency policy will outline the parameters under which the agency will use the Pathways Programs. An agency must make its Pathways policies available to OPM, applicants, agency employees, and other stakeholders upon request.\n\nMay agencies with existing Pathways MOUs continue to use the Pathways Programs?\n\nAgencies with existing Pathways MOUs may continue to use the Pathways Programs subject to the new regulations in lieu of an updated Pathways Policy while they are developing and updating their policies in accordance with the new regulations. Agencies without existing MOUs must establish an agency Pathways Policy before they begin making Pathways appointments.\n\nWhat information should be included in an agency’s Pathways Policy?\n\nThe Pathways Policy must reflect the requirements listed in 5 CFR 362.104, including but not limited to:\n\nInformation about any agency-specific program labels that will be used, subject to the Federal naming conventions identified in § 362.101(a) (e.g., OPM Internship Program);\n\nThe delegations of authority for the agency’s use of the Pathways Programs (e.g., department-wide vs. bureaus or components);\n\nAny implementing policy or guidance that the agency determines would facilitate successful implementation and administration for each Pathways Program;\n\nA description of how the agency will design, implement, and document formal training and/or development, as well as the type and duration of assignments;\n\nA commitment from the agency to:\n\nProvide OPM with any information it requests on the agency’s Pathways Programs;\n\nAdhere to any caps on the Pathways Programs imposed by the director;\n\nProvide information to OPM upon request about opportunities for individuals interested in participating in the Pathways Programs (including the posting of PMF appointment opportunities to the PMF Program’s Talent Management System);\n\nProvide a meaningful onboarding process for each Pathways Program;\n\nAlign the usage of the Pathways Program with the implementation of the agency’s workforce and recruiting plans.\n\nCriteria and procedures for agency-approved extensions for recent graduates and PMFs, not to exceed 120 days. Extension criteria must be limited to circumstances that would render the agency's compliance with the regulations impracticable or impossible;\n\nCriteria and procedures on how the agency will determine whether it has the resources available to convert a Pathways Participant to a term or permanent position in the competitive service. These procedures must specify the timeline for making the determination, which must include informing the Pathways Participant no later than 60 calendar days prior to the end of the appointment about whether the agency is able to convert them.\n\nThe minimum service-hour requirement(s) for conversion of an intern as required by § 362.204.\n\nThe program length for Recent Graduate Programs. If programs of longer than one year are identified the policy must identify a justification for using a longer program.\n\nThe agency’s Pathways Programs Officer (PPO) and Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Coordinator.\n\nHow do agencies establish recent graduate positions for longer durations?\n\nThe intent of the Recent Graduates Program is to provide a 1-year, entry-level developmental experience that may lead to a permanent job in an agency’s workforce.\n\nAgencies may establish Recent Graduate Programs in excess of 1 year if the training requirements of a specific position warrant a longer and more structured program. Any positions designated as having a program of longer than 1 year must be identified in the agency’s Pathways Policy and described on the Pathways Participant agreement. Individual managers, organizations, etc., may not individually decide how long the Recent Graduate Program will last.\n\nPresidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program\n\nCan PMFs complete their developmental assignments outside of the Federal government?\n\nNo. PMFs may only complete their developmental assignments in their organization, within their agency, in another Federal agency (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105), or in a participating Federal agency within the Legislative Branch. PMFs may continue to complete optional rotations outside of their agency at the discretion of their agency and following their agencies’ policies and procedures.\n\nWhat is the appointment eligibility period for PMF finalists referenced in 5 CFR 362.404?\n\nA PMF finalist has 12 months from the official finalist selection date to accept and start a PMF appointment. Under certain limited circumstances, an agency may request an appointment eligibility extension if it is unable to bring the finalist onboard as a fellow within that time, e.g., because of delays in completing a background investigation. This practice is consistent with PMF regulations in effect prior to the Pathways Programs regulations.\n\nMay individuals participating in the PMF Program be appointed to a position that has an established career ladder?\n\nYes. An individual participating in the PMF Program may be appointed to a position that has an established career ladder provided the PMF appointment opportunity for the position stated the career ladder.\n\nWhat is the deadline for an Executive Resources Board (ERB) to certify a fellow has successfully completed the PMF Program?\n\nThe deadline for an ERB to certify that a fellow has successfully completed all program requirements is 30 days prior to the fellow’s 2-year anniversary date and any fellowship extension up to 120 days. ERB certification is required prior to conversion.\n\nDoes “formal interactive training” include online training for fellows?\n\nYes. An agency may use online training if the training addresses the competencies outlined in the fellow’s IDP and will prepare the fellow for their target position. Interactive training includes communication between instructor and students and amongst students, etc. Ultimately, the agency’s ERB will determine if the fellow has met all program requirements, including the amount and type of training. Agencies may want to clarify training definitions in their Pathways Programs policies.\n\nMay a PMF participate in an agency-wide or Presidential or Administration initiative to fulfill the requirement for a 4-to-6-month developmental assignment?\n\nYes. Per 5 CFR 362.405(b)(4)(i), a fellow may participate in an agency-wide or Presidential or Administration initiative to fulfill the requirement for a 4-to-6-month developmental assignment. Such experience must be 4 to 6 months in duration to allow the fellow the experience he or she would have gained through a traditional developmental assignment; the duration does not have to be consecutive months.\n\nWill OPM grant extensions or waivers to the yearly PMF training requirements for agencies unable to comply due to budget constraints?\n\nNo. The agency must provide each fellow a minimum of 80 hours of formal interactive training per year and must provide each fellow with at least one 4- to 6-month developmental assignment during their 2-year fellowship. The PMF Program Office sponsors several training opportunities for all PMFs that may count towards the training requirements. Ultimately, the ERB certification process ensures each fellow has completed at least 160 hours of training as part of the program requirements.\n\nCan an agency whose positions are excepted by statute from the provisions of title 5 governing the competitive service or non-Executive Branch agencies participate in the PMF Program?\n\nYes. Agencies whose positions are excepted by statute or non-Executive Branch agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Library of Congress, and Congressional Research Service) may enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with OPM to participate in the PMF Program. Once an approved MOA is on file, the agency may appoint fellows. However, upon completion of program requirements, the fellow is eligible only for placement into an excepted service position. Such agencies must also have PMF Program policies in effect.\n\nMay a fellow be authorized to work a part-time work schedule?\n\nAn agency may approve a part-time work schedule at the request of a fellow for a limited period of up to 6 months. If the part-time work schedule is approved, the fellow must (1) still meets all program requirements during their 2-year program and any approved extension and (2) account for any adjustments to their training and developmental activities for each year of their fellowship.\n\nIs an agency required to approve a fellow’s request for a part-time work schedule?\n\nAn agency is generally not required to approve a request for a part-time work schedule.\n\nWhat information should a fellow and the employing agency consider when determining if a part-time work schedule is appropriate.\n\nThe fellow and the agency should consider how the use of a part-time work schedule would impact the fellow’s ability to meet all program requirements by the expiration of the fellow’s appointment. Additionally, both parties may also need to consider how a part-time work schedule may impact the fellow’s ability to meet the qualification requirements for promotions.\n\nIf an agency is unable to convert a fellow when should the agency inform the fellow?\n\nAn agency must inform a fellow no later than 60 calendar days prior to the end of their appointment or any approved fellowship extension. OPM encourages managers to make determinations about whether the resources are available to convert PMFs at regular intervals prior to the end of a fellow’s program period. OPM also encourages agencies to inform PMFs as soon as possible after the agency makes a determination about the agency’s ability to convert the fellow.\n\nAdditionally, OPM requires agencies to include provisions in their Pathways Policies that address procedures and criteria for determining if an agency will be able to convert PMFs and communicating those determinations to the employee. OPM encourages agencies to indicate on the Pathways Participant Agreement a time frame for when the agency will make the conversion decision.\n\nMay a fellow be converted to a position in a different agency?\n\nA fellow (who meets the requirements for conversion) may be converted to a term or permanent position in a different agency when the employing agency is unable to convert the fellow. The reasons for conversion at another agency may include but are not limited to unforeseen budgetary constraints; reorganizations; abolishment of positions; completion of cohort-based Pathways programs; or other appropriate reasons.\n\nMay an agency extend a fellow’s appointment to allow time for conversion to a position at another agency?\n\nYes, an agency may extend a fellow’s appointment for up to 120 days to allow time for the fellow to be converted to a position at a different agency. However, there is no allowance to extend beyond 120 days.\n\nIf a fellow is being converted to a permanent position in another agency, may the fellow be converted to a position with a career ladder?\n\nA fellow may be converted to a position with a career ladder in a different agency. The position at the new agency must have a career ladder that is equivalent to or less than the position they would have been converted to at the prior agency.\n\nDoes the reduction in force (RIF) rules apply to a fellow who is separated when their appointment expires?\n\nNo. Separation when a fellow’s appointment expires is not subject to the RIF requirements in 5 CFR part 351.\n\nDo the current PMF rules provide OPM the authority to waive any provision of the PMF requirements upon an agency request?\n\nNo. The current PMF regulations do not include a provision that would give OPM the authority to waive any PMF Program requirement. The PMF Program allows for appointment eligibility and fellowship extensions.\n\nQuestions"
