        "text": "SUMMARY: This Instruction reissues and cancels DoD 1400.25-M, \"Civilian Personnel Manual,\" and is composed of several volumes, each containing its own purpose. The purpose of the overall Instruction is to establish and implement policy, establish uniform DoD-wide procedures, provide guidelines and model programs, delegate authority, and assign responsibilities regarding civilian personnel management within the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Subchapters of the Civilian Personnel Manual (CPM) have been reformatted to conform to DoDI 5025.01. All CPM Subchapters have been numbered as Volumes. Most CPMs will retain their current numbering scheme, which is based on the originating 5 CFR cite (e.g., SC 630 is now Volume 630 and is numbered as DoDI 1400.25-V630). The reformatting project is nearly complete, with most Volumes issued April 6, 2009. Those Subchapters not yet reformatted are posted here to maintain continuity of information."
