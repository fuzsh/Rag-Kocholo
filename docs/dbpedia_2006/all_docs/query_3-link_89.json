At most, leave one line space and then restate initials.\n\nEnclosures: If there are any enclosures, first, write \"Encl.\" or \"Enclosures,\" leave one line of space, then, write the title of the enclosure.\n\nCopies: If you are sending copies of the memo to other people not included in the \"TO:\" line, have the heading \"CC:\" and include the names and titles two line spaces below the end of the memo.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nDATE: October 24, 2007\n\nTO: Jane A.

The time schedule for this project is three weeks.\n\nI would appreciate if you could reschedule any meetings that are supposed to take place in the aforementioned rooms for the next four weeks."
