The email comes from a member-osbar.org domain name, and purports to be a follow up to an email sent last week from OSB President Dave Rosen. This email and domain name are not affiliated with the bar. OSB was successful in getting these domains suspended by the provider. Questions can be directed to it-support@osbar.org. The OSB maintains a scam alerts page to help alert our membership and the public.\n\nOregon Law Help Soft-Launch\n\nOSB and our partners are now testing Oregon Law Help, a new website where low-income Oregonians can find civil legal information and free or affordable legal help. During this soft-launch phase, OSB is collecting user feedback to help make the site the best it can be. View the in-progress site here and use this form to share your feedback or suggestions.\n\nCourt Approves Supervised Practice Portfolio Examination (SPPE)\n\nOn November 7, 2023, the Oregon Supreme Court approved a new method to assess the skills and knowledge of OSB applicants. The SPPE will be offered in addition to the Oregon Bar Exam, beginning in 2024. More information is here.\n\nVolunteer with the Oregon State Bar\n\nThe Board of Governors is now accepting applications for lawyer and non-lawyer volunteers interested in serving on a number of bar boards, committees, and councils. A description of each opportunity accompanies the application on the links below. Applications are due by September 20.\n\nOregon State Bar Public Meetings\n\nClick here for notice of upcoming public meetings pursuant to ORS 192.640.
