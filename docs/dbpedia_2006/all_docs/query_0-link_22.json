Hispanic Heritage Month is observed from 15 September - 15 October of each year. The observance is celebrated during this time frame due to many significant events for various Hispanic communities which fall within the observance period.

Hispanics have had a profound and positive influence on our country through their strong commitment to family, faith, hard work, and service.

Over several years the observation was moved to different months but in 1990 Public Law 101-343 set the month-long observance in November. Each year the President issues a Proclamation in recognition of the observance. National American Indian Heritage Month is observed from 1 - 30 November of each year. The observance month recognizes American Indians for their respect for natural resources and the Earth, having served with valor in our nation's conflicts and for their many distinct and important contributions to the United States. Please note that the title of this observance varies between the various documents listed and DEOMI uses that title set forth in the 1990 and subsequent Public Laws. The theme for this event changes each year.\n\n► National American Indian Heritage Month DEOMI News Release\n\n► USD Personnel & Readiness Memo on National American Indian History Month\n\n► Poster Description\n\nNote: The posters may not be used in any manner that would reflect negatively on the DoD; degrade the name, reputation, or public goodwill of the DoD Components; or be contrary to DoD community relations objectives.
