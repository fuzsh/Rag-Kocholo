        "text": "CT DEALERS:\n\nTo read the 9/26 memo regarding the dealer inventory and other legislative changes click here\n\nTo access the new inventory form click here\n\nCT PISTOL PERMIT INSTRUCTORS:\n\nAs indicated in the memo dated March 18, 2024, DESPP has created a standardized PowerPoint, in accordance with Public Act 23-53, to supplement the NRA Basics of Pistol Shooting course as well as any independent curriculum approved by the Commissioner. After teaching this PowerPoint, in conjunction with the full safety course curriculum and live fire portion, the instructor should issue both the certificate of completion of the safety course, as well as the certificate of completion for the DESPP supplemental. While this supplemental is mandatory for any class taught on or after July 1, 2024, It is recommended that instructors begin teaching this supplemental as soon as possible, in case the students delay in submitting their application.\n\nPower Point Presentation\n\nCertificate of Completion\n\nPlease see the attached memo regarding updates about the NRA Course for the Pistol Permit Application Training Requirement. More information will be posted here as it develops. NRA Instructors - New Legislative Requirements\n\nTo read the memo for CT pistol permit firearms instructors click here\n\nTo access the instructor Lesson Plan Tracking form click here\n\nEffective 9/14/2023, SLFU will now be accepting pistol permit renewals online. For the instructions on how to complete an online renewal, click HERE. To access the online renewal portal, click HERE. This process can still be completed by mail; however, it is STRONGLY recommended that you utilize the online portal.\n\nStarting 1/1/24 all credit card transactions will include a 3% service fee. The service fee is applicable exclusively to transactions made with a credit card, both in person and online. The fee is not included when using cash, checks or money order as a form of payment.\n\nEffective 9/11/2023, SLFU will no longer facilitate the private sale of a firearm between two individuals. The State statute for a firearm sale requires a query of the FBI-NICS system, which is not authorized by the FBI unless an FFL is involved. In order to satisfy the state law and the federal regulation, every private citizen sale to another private person must be facilitated through an FFL.\n\nOn 6/6/2023, Public Act 23-53 (House Bill 6667) was signed into Connecticut law. Sales of so-called “other” and “pre-ban” weapons, unless pursuant to an exception, are now prohibited. Follow the link to File No 841 with the final text and summary of each section.
