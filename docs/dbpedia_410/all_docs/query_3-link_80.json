        "text": "South Korea's Kim Woo-jin won the gold medal in the men's individual archery final at Paris 2024 on Sunday 4 August. Thanks to a difference of just three millimetres in the tie-break he was able to beat the American Ellison Brady, who won the silver medal.\n\nThe Esplanade des Invalides was the stage chosen to name the champion. The Asian archer managed to beat his rival 6-5 after the so-called golden arrow had decided the title in his favour. The victory was Woo-jin's third gold medal at the Olympics after he also won the men's team and mixed team events.\n\nThe South Korean began by losing the first set 29-27 to a Brady who in the beginning was close to perfection. The second set brought the score back to level terms and in the next set it was the American who took the lead again. Woo-jin bounced back in the fourth round, taking advantage of a bad shot by his opponent, hitting 10 shots to make it 4-4 on aggregate and leave the competition open for the final leg."
