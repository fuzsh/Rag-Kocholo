        "text": "Three Questions: Prepping for the Olympics’ stretch run\n\nOur Nicole Auerbach has been busy over the last couple weeks in Paris. She’s led our coverage of swimming, but also chimed in on tennis, gymnastics and more. As we dive into week two of the Olympics, I snagged her for a quick Q&A to set the scene.\n\nOn Friday, we shared your story on Team USA’s first-week gold-medal slump. Any predictions for how the final overall count shakes out?\n\nNicole: I think Team USA will ultimately be fine, once track completes. I even think the Americans will end up with more gold medals in the pool than the Aussies, assuming the medley relays go OK on Sunday night. But it definitely was a weird first week, and I keep thinking how much worse it would have been if Team USA didn’t have Simone Biles or Katie Ledecky. Things would be very, very dire. Thank God for these women.\n\nSome sports haven’t even started yet! What are the top storylines you’re keeping an eye on this week?\n\nNicole: I’ve been extremely pool-focused, but I’m excited to zoom out next week and watch basketball play its medal rounds here in Paris. I can’t wait to see meaningful beach volleyball matches in front of the Eiffel Tower. And I’m intrigued by the debut of breaking — as well as the continuation of kayak cross, which might be the greatest sport ever invented??\n\nThe Olympics seem like an exhilarating and exhausting event to cover. Can you share a rose and a thorn from your experience so far?\n\nNicole: How much time do you have? I could answer this question in a million different ways. The worst part is the transit and travel; everything is far away from everything else. You have to plan meticulously, and you’re still going to be totally spent by the end of the day. But it’s worth it. And I’d say the coolest part of this particular Olympics has been a predominantly French crowd watching its hero Léon Marchand swim a race. It is unlike anything else I’ve ever experienced at a live sporting event. My favorite part of my favorite experience is when he swims breaststroke — the fans all yelp in unison every time he pops his head up. I’ll never forget it.\n\nThanks, Nicole! You can follow her coverage here.\n\nPulse Picks\n\nA fun read from Brendan Quinn: Nothing lasts forever — except Teddy Riner, French Olympic judo superstar.\n\nScott Dochterman went in-depth on UCLA, a proud athletic department whose lack of recent football success makes it stick out among the Big Ten’s four West Coast newcomers.\n\nTeam USA’s 3×3 basketball teams had a rocky start in Paris.

Here’s a by-the-numbers look at their unfortunate streak. (The single-season record: 26, by the 1889 Louisville Colonels.)\n\nMost-clicked in the newsletter Friday: David Aldridge’s fun piece on Simone Biles cementing her legend in Thursday’s all-around final — and rocking a diamond-encrusted goat necklace.\n\nMost-read on the website yesterday: Audrey Snyder’s roundup of great anecdotes about Stephen Nedoroscik, as told by former teammates, coaches and supporters.\n\nTop podcast in The Athletic network: On the latest Full Time podcast, Tamerra Griffin and Steph Yang react to the USWNT’s win over Japan as well as break down all 531 minutes of exhausting Olympic quarterfinal action.\n\nSign up for our other newsletters:"
