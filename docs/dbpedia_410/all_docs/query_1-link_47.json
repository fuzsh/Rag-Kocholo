        "text": "Nearly a dozen athletes with Cincinnati ties are competing in the Summer Olympics in Paris in 2024, hoping to bring hardware back to the Queen City in soccer, rowing, swimming, sport climbing and more.\n\nCarson Foster from Mason might be the favorite for gold in the 400-meter individual medley after he beat out the most recent gold and silver medalists in that event at US Olympic trials last month. Rose Lavelle and the US women’s soccer team will always be mentioned among favorites for gold in women’s soccer. Nina Castagna from Walnut Hills will be the coxswain for the women’s rowing eight, a team that has won three of the last four gold medals.\n\nThere are more athletes who have a chance to medal in Paris, but this contingent wouldn’t be the first gold medalists from Cincinnati.\n\nThroughout the last 100 years, the Cincinnati area has produced some of the best Olympic athletes in the history of the modern games. Darrell Pace from Reading is considered by many to be the best American archer ever. Swimmer Gary Hall Jr. won five gold medals across three different Olympics. Bob Schul became the first (and still today the only) American to win the 5,000-meter track race while a student at Miami University.\n\nHere's a look at the Cincinnatians who have earned gold medals at past Olympics:\n\nWilliam DeHart Hubbard, 1924 Paris Olympics, long jump\n\nCincinnati ties: Hubbard was an athletic star at Walnut Hills High School before going to the University of Michigan, where he was the first black varsity track letterman.\n\nOlympic results: On his first long jump attempt of the qualifying round, Hubbard was injured and couldn't finish the round. His first jump was enough to qualify him for the final, however. Hubbard leaped 24 feet, 6 inches (7.47 meters) in the 1924 Olympic final to win the gold, the first African American to win an individual gold medal. He qualified for the long jump again in 1928 but finished 11th.\n\nAfter the Olympics: After graduating from college, Hubbard worked as the supervisor of the Department of Colored Work for the Cincinnati Public Recreation Commission. Later, he became the manager of a public housing project in Cincinnati, before he moved to Cleveland to be a race relations adviser for the Federal Housing Authority. He also founded the Cincinnati Tigers, a baseball team that played in the Negro Leagues.\n\nMae Faggs, 1952 Helsinki Olympics, track, 4x100 meter relay\n\nCincinnati ties: Faggs grew up and went to high school in New York, but after graduating from Tennessee State, Faggs earned a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati and lived in the area until her death.\n\nOlympic results: Faggs participated in three Olympic games: London in 1948, Helsinki in 1952 and Melbourne in 1956. She won gold in Helsinki for the women's 4x100 meter relay and then a bronze medal in Melbourne for the same race.\n\nAfter the Olympics: She taught physical education around the Cincinnati area and eventually started working at Princeton High School. She led the Princeton girls' track and field team to the Ohio state championship in 1989. In 2000, she died at her home in Woodlawn, a village just north of Cincinnati.\n\nJerry Lucas, 1960 Rome Olympics, basketball\n\nCincinnati ties: Lucas is from Middletown and starred at Middletown High School, where he led the Middies to a 76-1 record and two state championships during his three years on varsity.

Lucas scored 21 points in the gold medal game as the United States defeated Brazil for the gold.\n\nAfter the Olympics: Lucas went on to have a storied career in professional basketball, leading him to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980. He played for the Cincinnati Royals from 1963 to 1969 before being traded to the San Francisco Warriors. He won the NBA Championship in 1973 with the New York Knicks. Across his 11-year pro career, Lucas was a seven-time All-Star and was named to an All-NBA team five times.\n\nBob Schul, 1964 Tokyo Olympics, track, 5,000 meter run\n\nCincinnati ties: Schul was born in the suburbs of Dayton, but he won Olympic gold while a student at Miami University. He graduated from Miami in 1966, two years after winning in Tokyo.\n\nOlympic results: Schul competed in just one Olympics, winning gold in the 5000-meter race in 1964 with a time of 13 minutes, 38 seconds. He's still the only American to ever win gold in the 5,000-meters.\n\nAfter the Olympics: Schul retired in 1965 due to knee issues. In 1973, he started a men's cross-country team at Wright State, which he coached until 1981 when the program shut down. The program returned in 1999, and Schul was the coach from then until 2006.
