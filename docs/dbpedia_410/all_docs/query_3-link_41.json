        "text": "New England is well-represented at the 2024 Paris Olympics this summer.\n\nDozens of athletes from the region are competing in a variety of sports. Here's a comprehensive list.\n\nArchery\n\nAfter watching the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Jennifer Mucino-Fernandez began her career in archery. Mucino-Fernandez was born in Massachusetts and raised in Mexico City, but she came back to the U.S. to train for the Olympics. Nearly eight years after that, she competed in the 2020 Olympic Games. And now at 21 years old, Mucino-Fernandez will compete in Paris.\n\nArtistic Swimming\n\nRuby Remati, an Ohio State junior, will compete in her first Olympic Games this year. The artistic swimmer helped her team sweep each category at the 2023 championship as a freshman. She's originally from Andover, Massachusetts, but is also an Australian citizen. She said she owes most of her involvement to her sport to her parents, although she admits the sparkles caught her attention to the sport as a child.\n\nBadminton\n\nJennie Gai was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, but now calls California home. She will compete in the mixed doubles event. Gai and her partner, Vinson Chiu, took home silver medals in the 2024 Pan Am Individual Championships and the 2023 Pan American Games.\n\nBasketball\n\nOlympic gold medalist, Napheesa Collier, was raised by her father from Sierra Leone and mother from Eugene, Missouri.

Dubbed \"Stewie\" by her friends and fans, the athlete only lost five games in her entire college career.\n\nDiana Taurasi is a veteran in the world of women's professional basketball. As a senior at UConn nearly 20 years ago, she first got called up to the senior national team. She was the No. 1 WNBA pick back in 2004 and has played for the Phoenix Mercury as a guard ever since. Taurasi will be looking for a sixth gold medal this Olympic season.\n\nAfter winning this years NBA championships, the Boston Celtics have a lot to celebrate. But competition hasn't stopped as three of their players are heading to Paris.\n\nJayson Tatum was born in Missouri and became one of the best basketball players in the country during his high school years. He played one collegiate season at Duke University before being drafted as third pick overall to the Boston Celtics in 2017. He finished third for the Rookie of the Year Award, and in his third season, he earned his first All-Star Game appearance. Now, seven years later, Tatum is a large part of the Celtics' success.\n\nDerrick White, the Celtics' point guard, was selected 29th overall to the San Antonio Spurs in the 2017 NBA draft. In 2022, he was traded to the Celtics, where he developed into a top scoring option on a team with such elite scorers as Tatum and Jaylen Brown. He is originally from Colorado and transferred to University of Colorado Boulder during his college career.\n\nJrue Holiday will be competing in his second Olympic Games later this month. Holiday helped Team USA win gold at the 2020 Olympics. Originally from the West Coast, Holiday is a UCLA alum. He began his NBA career with the Philadelphia 76ers after being drafted in the first round in 2009. Now, Holiday is a central figure for the Celtics and helped the team to victory in the NBA championship.\n\nThis will be the first Olympics for Connecticut Sun forward Alyssa Thomas, who grew up watching the Games. The Pennsylvania native attended Maryland and in 2014 she was drafted no. 4 overall in 2014 by the New York Liberty, then traded to the Connecticut Sun the same day.\n\nCycling\n\nKristen Faulkner started cycling after graduating from Harvard University in 2016 and nearly eight years later will head to her first Olympic Games.

The fencer has attended three World Championships and won gold for foil back in 2019.\n\nElizabeth Tartakovsky, a New Jersey native who attended Harvard University, first took an interest in fencing in 2008, when she watched as her great uncle, Ukrainian-born Yury Gelman, coached Team USA in the Beijing Olympics.
