        "text": "Australia’s campaign at the Paris 2024 Olympics is currently underway with over 450 Australian athletes competing in 329 events across 42 sports at the ongoing Summer Games.\n\nThe country will have representation in 42 of the 45 sports on the Paris 2024 programme, with fencing, handball and volleyball being the only exceptions.\n\nHeading into Paris 2024, Australian athletes have won 557 medals - 167 gold, 177 silver and 213 bronze - at the Olympics.\n\nWhile adding to the tally at Paris 2024 will be the top priority for the Aussie athletes, a select few will also be coming home with some nifty records, big or small, from France when the dust settles.\n\nHere’s a complete list of all of Australia’s records at the Paris 2024 Olympics so far.\n\nParis 2024 Olympics: Australia records\n\nLaura Paeglis records highest score by an Australian woman in Olympic archery ranking round\n\nWith a score of 640 from her 72 arrows in the women’s individual archery ranking rounds at Paris 2024, Laura Paeglis came in 44th.\n\nWhile it was well short of top seed Republic of Korea’s Lim Sihyeon world record score of 694, Laura’s score was the best-ever by an Aussie woman since the 72-arrow ranking round format began at Atlanta 1996.\n\nGrace Brown becomes first Australian to win a gold medal in women’s time trial road cycling\n\nRoad cyclist Grace Brown won Australia’s first medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics with a gold in the women’s individual time trial on July 27. It was also the first Aussie medal in the women’s individual time trial road cycling event.\n\nSara Carrigan, at Athens 2004, was the last Aussie to win gold in a road race at the Olympics. Brown’s medal in France also saw an Australian female cyclist stand on the top podium for the first time since Anna Meares won the women’s sprint track cycling event at Paris 2024.\n\nAustralian men’s rugby sevens team logs best-ever finish\n\nAfter quarter-final exits from both Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, the Australian men’s rugby sevens team logged its best-ever finish at the Olympics by making it to the semi-finals at Paris 2024.\n\nVictories over Samoa, Kenya and Tokyo 2020 bronze medallists Argentina saw the Nicholas Malouf-led side cruise to the quarters. In the top eight, the Aussie men blanked USA 18-0 to make the semis, where they lost to Tokyo 2020 champions Fiji.\n\nA close 26-19 defeat to South Africa ended their charge for a maiden Olympic medal.\n\nWomen’s 4x100m freestyle relay swimming team resets Olympic record\n\nThe quartet of Mollie O'Callaghan, Shayna Jack, Emma McKeon and Meg Harris clocked 3:28.92 to win the gold medal in women’s 4x100m freestyle relay swimming at Paris 2024. The time also saw the Olympic record in the event tumble.\n\nBronte Campbell, Meg Harris, Emma McKeon and Cate Campbell’s 3:29.69 from the Tokyo 2020 final was the previous mark.\n\nJessica Fox becomes first Australian to win medals in same event at four successive Olympic editions\n\nCanoe slalom ace Jessica Fox won the gold medal in the women’s kayak event at Paris 2024 and in the process, became the first Australian to medal in the same event at four successive Olympic Games. She won a silver in women’s K1 at London 2012 and returned with back-to-back bronze medals from Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. Fox also won the women’s canoe (C1) gold at Tokyo 2020.\n\nThe medal also saw Fox join Ian Thorpe, Leisel Jones, Shirley Strickland and Anna Meares as the only Australian Olympians to win five individual Olympic medals.\n\nJack Rossiter records best finish by an Australian in men's 10m air rifle\n\nShooter Jack Rossiter shot 628.5 in the men's 10m air rifle qualifiers to finish 16th. Though he didn't make the cut for the final, it was the best-ever result by an Australian in the event at the Olympics. Dane Sampson, with 626.9, finished 30th.\n\nMollie O'Callaghan sets new women's 200m freestyle swimming Olympic record\n\nAustralia's Mollie O'Callaghan won the gold medal in the women's 200m freestyle swimming event at Paris 2024, beating fellow Aussie Ariarne Titmus to the finish line. O'Callaghan clocked 1:53.27 to better Titmus' previous Olympic record of 1:53.50 set at Tokyo 2020.\n\nKaylee McKeown betters own Olympic record in women's 100m backstroke\n\nKaylee McKeown clocked 57.33 to defend her women's 100m backstroke crown at Paris 2024 and bettered her own Olympic record of 57.47 set at Tokyo 2020.\n\nMaddison Levi breaks records for most tries scored in women's rugby sevens at a single Olympic Games\n\nAustralia's Maddison Levi set the new record for most tries scored at a single Olympic Games by a women's rugby sevens player with 14 at the Paris 2024 Olympics. The Aussie team, however, stopped short of a podium finish after losing to Canada in the semi-finals before going down to the USA in the bronze medal match.\n\nJemima Montag resets national and Oceania record to win bronze medal in women's 20km race walk\n\nJemima Montag won Australia's first medal in the women's 20km race walk event at the Olympics since Jane Saville's bronze at Athens 2004. She bagged a bronze with a time of 1:26.25, bettering her previous national and Oceania record of 1:27:09 achieved at the Oceania Race Walking Championships in Adelaide earlier this year."
