        "text": "The 2024 Paris Olympics saw athletes from around the world represent their respective countries.\n\nAt the opening and closing ceremonies for each Olympic Games, certain athletes are given the honor of bearing their country's flag. The first U.S. flag bearer recognized by the Olympic committee was Ralph Rose, in the 1908 Summer Olympic Opening Ceremony.\n\nHere's a list of the U.S. Olympic flag bearers with noteworthy NCAA careers including highlights from their respective colleges.\n\nMorgan Taylor (1932)| Grinnell College\n\nMorgan Taylor attended Grinnell College, a Division IIII university, where he played football and ran track before turning to Men's Track & Field as an Olympic athlete.

As a football player, he took on the role of pass-catcher.\n\nRalph Craig (1948)| Michigan\n\nRalph Craig graduated from the University of Michigan in 1911 where he ran track and won the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America (IC4A) 220-yard event in back-to-back years — managing to equal the world record of the time each year (21.2).

Armitage first picked up fencing as a student at Columbia and won the Intercollegiate Fencing Association sabre championship before graduating in 1928. Armitage worked as a chemical engineer and despite suffering third-degree burns in a chemical accident in 1936 that left his fencing career in question, Armitage persevered and made the 1936 Olympic team. He later won bronze in sabre at the 1948 Summer Games.\n\nRafer Johnson (1960) | UCLA\n\nAs a two-sport athlete in track and field and basketball, and the student body president, Rafer Johnson was known as an all-around athlete at UCLA.

O'Brien is also known for being the first man to beat the 60-foot barrier.\n\nGary Hall (1976)| Indiana\n\nDuring his time at Indiana (1970-73) Gary Hall won eight swimming & diving NCAA championships, 13 Big Ten titles and 15 Athletic Amateur Union titles.
