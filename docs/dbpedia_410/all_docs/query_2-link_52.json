        "text": "Main stabilizer: From 29 to 36 inches long, it balances and stabilizes the bow when raised.\n\nTop/Bottom stabilizers: From 12 to 15 inches long, these also balance and stabilize the bow when raised.\n\nGrip: Wrapped in tennis grip material to prevent slipping.\n\nCounter-balance weight: Absorbs vibration and shock. Also helps balance the bow.\n\nVibration dampener: Helps reduce the vibration of the bow when the arrow is released.\n\nTorque compensator: Absorbs vibration of the bow.\n\nArrow Pile: The tip of the arrow. Shaped like a bullet, it penetrates the target.\n\nNock: The attachment on the rear end of an arrow that holds it in place on the bowstring. Also, to \"nock\" is to place the arrow on the string.\n\nShaft: The long, narrow middle of the arrow, connecting the pile to the nock. Any substance, such as wood, aluminum or carbon, is allowed, but the shaft may not exceed 9.3 mm (about 1/3 of an inch) in diameter. It is marked with the archer's name or initials for identification.\n\nThe Target\n\nArchers stand 70 meters (plus or minus 30 cm) away from a target that is on an incline of 75-80 degrees â€” regardless of what the target is set at, that is the incline to be used for all targets.\n\nThe target used has a diameter of 122 cm. The target is divided into 10 equal rings, each measuring 12.2 cm. The colors of white (1, 2), black (3, 4), light blue (5, 6), red (7, 8) and yellow (9, 10) are used to differentiate the 10 scoring rings.\n\nIn Olympic team events, there is a line marked one meter behind the shooting line. Behind the line is where teammates and coaches stand and where equipment is kept during the match."
