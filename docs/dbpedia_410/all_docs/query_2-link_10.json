Now Rod will run through all of the stations in his head (he said he was even doing this during our interview) and visualize himself shooting them successfully. He feels you have to have a successful mental picture. He said it's only the last round that can throw him, because he can hear the other arrows hitting the targets and it can be distracting wondering if the other archer is ahead."
