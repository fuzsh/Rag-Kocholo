        "text": "Pinned\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Team USA medal recap for July 28\n\nDay 2 of the 2024 Paris Olympics has come and gone, and the United States finds themselves with the most total medals.\n\nThe U.S. is the favorite to take home the most medals in this year’s Games, and multiple athletes added to the count that now stands at 12 in Paris.\n\nThe next closest? The host country, France, with eight. Japan (seven), Australia (six) and South Korea (six) round out the top five.\n\nHowever, Australia and Japan both have more golds, as they tallied four to the United States’ three thus far. Let’s take a look at which athletes medaled on Sunday:\n\nFENCING HISTORY\n\nThe first All-United States women's foil fencing final came on Sunday, as Lee Kiefer defeated her compatriots Lauren Scruggs, 15-6, to win gold. But this battle in fencing was one the United States could sit back and take in, as both women were guaranteed precious hardware.

Just 135 of the 3,089 athletes that competed were women.\n\nThe Olympic Games were starting to gain more relevance globally, as 44 countries sent representatives to Paris. All continents were represented in the 1924 Olympic games.\n\nThe 1924 Games were historic because it was the first Games where the Olympic Village was built. Later that year, in the winter of 1924, France was host to the first ever Winter Olympics. The competitions held in Chamonix are considered the inaugural Winter Olympic Games.\n\nThe history of Paris and the Olympics dates back further than 1924.\n\nGreece was the host of the first Olympics, but Paris hosted the second ever Olympic Games in 1900.\n\nIn fact, they were not even called the Olympics yet. “The Games of the II Olympiad” took place over the course of five months from May to October 1900.\n\nThe Paris 2024 games will make history as well: they will be the first carbon-neutral games, and the first gender-equal games.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Scott Thompson Share\n\nWhat is Sport Climbing?\n\nSport Climing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Games in Tokyo, and like breaking took its first steps to becoming an Olympic sport at the 2018 Buenos Aires Youth Olympic Games.\n\nThe sport was not only approved for Paris this year, but it has already been approved for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics.\n\nThere are two Olympic events in sports climbing: speed, boulder and lead.\n\nThe speed event is a one-on-one competition that shows the athletes trying to climb the 15-meter wall faster than their opponent. For the bouldering part of the event, athletes try and climb a 4.5-meter wall without any ropes. The lead part sees climbers try and scale a 15-meter wall in under six minutes with having seen the wall beforehand.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos and Scott Thompson contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Scott Thompson Share\n\nSteve Kerr: 'I felt like an idiot' not playing Jayson Tatum in Team USA's Olympic opener\n\nTeam USA men’s basketball had their best game this summer in its Paris Olympics opener against Serbia, as they won, 110-84, to start their tournament on the right foot.\n\nBut, while there were lots of things to be happy about if you’re rooting for Team USA, Jayson Tatum not touching the floor during the 40-minute contest turns a lot of heads.\n\nHead coach Steve Kerr was asked about Tatum’s absence from the rotation in the opener after the win, and he was very blunt about his own mistake in not having him play.\n\n\"I felt like an idiot not playing him,\" Kerr said, via ESPN.\n\nKerr sent out 10 total players on Sunday afternoon, including Tatum’s Boston Celtics teammates, starting shooting guard Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, who was a late addition to Team USA earlier this year.\n\n\"40-minute game, you can’t play more than 10 [players],\" Kerr said. \"So, I think [Tatum’s] an amazing guy, great player and handled it beautifully.

The men’s triathlon is set for Tuesday, while the women’s event is Wednesday.\n\nPoor water quality has been closely linked to the weather in Paris , which included heavy rains seen during opening ceremonies and several events on Saturday, including cycling that had several competitors falling off their bikes in the wet streets.\n\nHowever, there isn’t expected to be rain in the forecast this week, which is the main reason for the organizers’ optimism that the Seine can be used for one of the Olympics’ signature events.\n\n“We’ve seen what were the dynamics of the Seine over the past few weeks, and that’s what makes us confident,” Paris Deputy Mayor Antoine Guillou said, via the Associated Press, at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nGuillou added that similar rain has led to safe water quality in the Seine after 24 to 48 hours in the past.\n\nBut water quality was a concern before the Games arrived in Paris, which is why a giant basin was constructed earlier this year to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from getting into the river. Still, daily water tests in early June showed unsafe water quality levels, which included E. coli.\n\nTo show the people of Paris, and around the world, that the water was safe, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river less than two weeks before the Olympics began.\n\nAs of this past Tuesday, Eau de Paris, which monitors water quality, said levels in the Seine were acceptable.\n\nIf water quality does not improve by the time the triathlon is set to begin on Tuesday, the backup plan for the Olympics is to, first, postpone the event a few days to wait it out. If the conditions still don’t improve, the swimming portion of the triathlon will be canceled, and only running and biking will be performed.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Scott Thompson Share\n\nUSWNT dominates Germany, 4-1, to pick up second Olympic group stage win\n\nThe United States women’s soccer team is victorious once again in Paris, as they dominated Germany, 4-1, to win its second Olympic group stage match.\n\nStar forward Sophia Smith scored twice, both of which came in the first half as the U.S. put up three goals to Germany’s lone score in the first 45 minutes to take a commanding lead.\n\nSmith’s first goal came in the 10th minute, as Trinity Rodman’s cross into the box from the right side landed right at her foot and she delivered the perfect strike to put the U.S. up on the scoreboard first.\n\nThen, after Germany hit the equalizer, Mallory Swanson, who had two goals in the team’s opening Olympic match against Zambia, a 3-0 victory, found the back of the net yet again to give her team the lead once more.\n\nSmith would find the back of the net again in the 44th minute, where her shot deflected off a German defender, hit the right goal post, and redirected over the line to put the U.S. in the driver’s seat.\n\nThe second half was a bit more defensive for the USWNT, but that changed when Swanson took off with the rest of her teammates on a transition run with a few minutes left to play.

The lamé enables hits to register automatically.\n\nThe lamé may cover more or less of the body depending on which blade the fencer uses. There are three different kinds of blades used in the modern fencing: foil, épée, and sabre.\n\nThe foil blade weighs a maximum of 500 grams (1.1 lbs.) and is a thrusting weapon. When using the foil only the tip of the blade counts with the target area of the torso, which is covered by lamé.\n\nThe foil is the most familiar of the three disciplines. It has the smallest target area and is light, allowing for numerous different attacks.\n\nThe épée is also a thrusting blade but has a maximum weight of 775 grams (1.7 lbs.). Only the tip of the blade counts when making contact with the opponent, but your own target area is the entire body so there is no lamé.\n\nThe main differences from the épée and the foil, is that you cannot use the “flick attack” with the épée blade because it is so much heavier. The other difference is the whole body is a scoring area.\n\nThe sabre is a cutting and thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams (1.1 lbs.). The entire blade can be used to score with the target area being the upper half of the body, that includes face mask and neck bib. The entire upper half is covered by lamé.\n\nThe main difference with the sabre blade is that the body of the blade scores in addition to the tip.\n\nThe first to 15 points wins with the action taking place in three three-minute periods, with one-minute intervals as breaks.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nSamoa boxing coach dies in Olympic village after suffering cardiac arrest\n\nLionel Fatu Elika, the national boxing coach of Samoa, died at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Friday after reportedly suffering cardiac arrest while at the Olympic village.\n\nHe was 60 years old.

Several events were underway as Americans and others in the Western Hemisphere began to wake up.\n\nCompetitors in shooting, cycling road, judo, rugby sevens, fencing and swimming will be receiving the awards over the course of the day. A bronze medal match started the events in 10m air rifle mixed between Kazakhstan and Germany. The gold medal match was immediately after between China and South Korea.\n\nLater in the day, a medal in women’s 400-meter freestyle will be given out. It will be an event most people will be tuning in to watch. Katie Ledecky, Ariane Titmus and Summer McIntosh will certainly look to steal the show on Saturday afternoon.\n\n“I'm looking forward to the 400 free, day one. I like my chances,” Ledecky said, via the Olympics’ website. “I'm prepared and ready to race.”\n\nPosted by Ryan Gaydos Share\n\nWho stays at the Olympic Village and what are the rules?\n\nThe Olympic Village is comprised of 10,000 athletes, and a dining hall that can accommodate 3,500 people that will be open around-the-clock.\n\nThe dining hall will offer an array of diverse cuisines or grab-and-go options for athletes who are on the go.Some of the athletes are sleeping on cardboard beds with a mattress on top of them. A main theme of the Paris 2024 Games is sustainability, and all the cardboard beds will be recycled and reused.\n\nThe Olympic athletes must reside with their country's team, there are no sharing apartments with another country.The security is airtight, no friends and family are allowed in the Village. The only people residing in the Village are athletes, coaching staff, medical personnel, and security.\n\nAthletes who are minors, must room with only other minors on the team.\n\nQuiet hours are enforced daily from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. local time.\n\nThis year the Olympic Village will be located north of the center of Paris in the communes Saint-Denis, Île-Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, just five minutes away from Stade de France.\n\nFollowing the Games, the Olympic Village will turn into a place for 6,000 inhabitants, as the city is using the Olympic Games as an opportunity for urban development.\n\nFor the first time in Olympic Games history, there will be a ‘Floating Olympic Village’ on a 230-passenger ship named Aranui 5 for those athletes who taking part in the water-based events in Tahiti.\n\nThe same rules regarding who can enter the ship will be the same for those staying in the Village at Paris.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Ryan Canfield Share\n\nWhat is the Olympic Village?\n\nThe Olympic Village was created a century ago, at the Paris 1924 Olympic Games.\n\n“In bringing young people from every nation together, (the Olympics will) help foster this sense of cordiality that teaches men to become acquainted with each other better first and then hold each other in higher esteem,” Frantz Reichel, the secretary general of the organizing committee of the Olympic Games Paris 1924, said in the Official Report of the Games.\n\nFast-forward to present day, and now most Olympians cannot imagine what the Games would be like without it. The Olympic Village serves as a melting pot for all the athletes from all across the world to mingle and make friendships.\n\n“If you get rid of the Olympic Village , you get rid of a part of the Games,” Henri Specht, the director of the Olympic and Paralympic Village project at SOLIDEO, said, via the IOC.\n\n“It’s probably the only place and the only time on the planet when you have so many countries coming together at the same location. I think that every nation is very attached to the Village and the athletes who have in it have come out with a unique life experience.”\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Ryan Canfield Share\n\nWhat do the Olympic rings stand for?\n\nThe Olympic rings are plastered all throughout the world during Olympic times. But what do they actually stand for?\n\nThe logo was designed and hand-drawn in 1913 by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games.\n\nThe five rings were drawn to pay tribute to Games’ athletes. Each ring was representing a region of the world where the athletes came from: Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia.\n\nThe rings colors – from left to right – are blue, yellow, black, green, and red. They are put over a white background to symbolize the Olympics universality.\n\nWhile the iconic design was done in 1913, and the flag with the logo coming a year later in 1914, it was not until 1920 where the rings made their Olympic debut.\n\n“These five rings represent the five parts of the world now won over to the cause of olympism and ready to accept its fecund rivalries.” Founder of the Olympic Movement Pierre de Coubertin said.\n\n“What is more, the six colors this combined reproduce those of all nations without exception.”\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Ryan Canfield Share\n\nWhat is the Olympic motto?\n\nThe Olympic motto comes from before the official Olympic Games began.\n\nThe original motto was first said in 1881 by the Dominican priest Henri Didon in the opening ceremony of a sports event.\n\nIn Latin, the motto is, “Citius, Altius, Fortius.” In English that translates to “Faster, Higher, Stronger.”\n\nPierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Olympic movement, was in the crowd for Didon’s speech and adopted those words as the Olympic motto in 1894.\n\n“It expresses the aspirations of the Olympic Movement,” the IOC said. “Not only in its athletic and technical sense but also from a moral and educational perspective.”\n\nThe motto was changed during a session of the International Olympic Committee in July of 2021.\n\nIt now reads in Latin, “Citius, Altius, Fortius – Communiter.” Which in English translates to “Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together.”\n\nThe change was made to recognize the “unifying power of sport and the importance of solidarity.”\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Ryan Canfield Share\n\nHarrison Butker, Riley Gaines speak out on opening ceremony's Last Supper parody\n\nThe 2024 Olympics opening ceremony in Paris has sparked international outrage with drag-queen themed imagery of religious and historical figures.\n\nOne display on Friday showed what appear to be numerous performers, including drag queens and a large woman in an aureole halo crown, parodying \"The Last Supper,\" a universally recognizable painting by renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci of Christ and his apostles.\n\nHarrison Butker, an NFL football player who made headlines with his speech about Catholic faith quoted scripture to condemn the display, writing, \"Be not deceived, God is not mocked. For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.’ Galatians 6:7-8.\"\n\n\"Men in wigs front & center at the Olympic Games,\" OutKick's Riley Gaines wrote in a social media post of her own. \"No one ever tell me this group is ‘oppressed’ or ‘marginalized’ again.\"\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report written by Fox News' Alexander Hall.\n\nPosted by Ryan Morik Share\n\nHow will the Summer Olympics impact France’s economy?\n\nThe Summer Olympics may only take place for a couple of weeks, but the impact they have on France’s economy can stretch out for years.\n\nA study done by the French Center for Sports Law and Economics back in 2016 said that the 2024 Olympics “may generate at up to $11.6 billion and up to 247,000 jobs.”\n\n“Of the $11.6 billion, approximately $1.5-$3.79 billion (13-33%) is attributed to tourism-related economic impact,” the study said.\n\nThis study was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and the surge in inflation, so you must take the above numbers with some caution.\n\nHotel rooms have been at a premium, and with that the cost of hotels in and around Paris have skyrocketed. Three-star to five-star hotel prices have risen anywhere from 41%-64% above the yearly average during the Olympic Games.\n\nTo go along with the price increase, the tourist tax is now up to 200%. The tax brings room prices from $2.82 to $16.23 per night per Oxford Economics.\n\nThe hope for the French is that the tourists who visit during the games may come back and see things they did not get a chance to see during the Games.\n\nFrance will draw about 101 million international tourists this year, the most of any Europe destination and up from 98 million tourists in 2023 according to Oxford Economics. However, most of those tourists are coming for the Olympic Games.\n\nInternational tourism from before and after the Olympic Games is down compared to what it normally is. The high tourism tax’s duration is not just for the Olympic games and could be deterring travelers from visiting France outside of when Games occur.\n\nThe IOC understands the ramifications of what the Olympic Games can mean to a city and a country in the long term.\n\n“As the first Olympic Games aligned with Olympic Agenda 2020, Paris 2024 is proving that the Games can bring substantial economic benefits to their hosts, while being socially and environmentally responsible.” Olympic Games executive director Christophe Dubi said via the IOC.\n\n“These are Games that truly adapt to the needs of their host and to the times we live in, creating an impactful legacy before the Opening Ceremony and long after the sporting competitions have ended.”\n\nPer the IOC, about 181,000 people are currently working or set to work in roles connected with the Games.\n\n“Eighty per cent of the public investment is going to Seine-St-Denis, one of the youngest and most disadvantaged departments in France. The Olympic Village, for example, situated in Seine-Saint-Denis, will provide 2,800 housing units and two new schools, benefitting 6,000 residents.”\n\nThe goal for the IOC is for the Olympics not to just have a short-term impact on the economy, but a long-term one that leaves the host city in a better place after the games than before.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Ryan Canfield Share\n\nHow expensive is it for a country to host the Olympics?\n\nHow expensive is it to host the Olympics? In short, quite expensive.\n\nParis has already spent $9.7 billion on Olympic expenses, and the French taxpayers are paying for about $3.25 billion of that according to The Associated Press.\n\nThere is no guarantee you end up making that money back either.\n\nThe IOC projects Paris’ will receive $12.2 billion of economic benefit from these games, leaving them in the black should they come true.\n\nThe IOC says that the “economic benefits for the city, region, and country and predicted to far outweigh the Games-related investments.\n\nYet the numbers from past games tell a different story.\n\nIn 2012, London spent $14.6 billion and generated $5.2 billion. In 2010, Vancouver spent $7.6 billion yet only brought in $2.8 billion.\n\nIn 2008, Beijing spent a whopping $42 billion and only brought in $3.6 million.\n\nAccording to the University of Oxford, every Olympics since 1960 – except for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles – has been over budget by an average of 172%.\n\nThe reason the 1984 Olympics were profitable for Los Angeles was because most of the infrastructure required for the Games were already built.\n\nA lot of cities that were over their budget built brand new stadiums for the Olympic Games. Those stadiums have been seldom used since the Games left their respective cities.\n\nParis has only built one competitive venue for the 2024 Games, relying on previously built infrastructure and temporary venues to avoid having to build so many new venues.\n\nTime will tell if the 2024 Paris Games can join the 1984 Los Angeles Games as being the only Olympics that has been profitable in the last 64 years.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nCéline Dion wows with stunning performance at Olympics amid ongoing health issues\n\nSinging atop the Eiffel Tower, Céline Dion performed Edith Piaf's \"Hymne à l'amour\" to close out the opening ceremony. It was her first live performance since announcing her ongoing battle with stiff-person syndrome.\n\nDion was diagnosed with SPS in late 2022, causing her to postpone a tour. It is described by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke as a rare and progressive neurological disorder which causes rigid muscles and painful muscle spasms.\n\nThe beloved singer has opened up in the past about how the condition has affected her ability to sing and walk.\n\nOnlookers, including Kelly Clarkson on NBC’s broadcast, were left speechless and brought to tears by the Olympic performance.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nBreaking News\n\n2024 Paris Games officially begin with Olympic cauldron lighting\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics have officially begun after the Olympic cauldron was lit by a pair of French Olympians, three-time Olympic Judo gold medalist Teddy Riner and Marie-José Pérec, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field.\n\nAbout 10,000 people were chosen to carry the flame across France from the southern city port of Marseille, where it arrived on May 8, to the opening ceremony on July 26.\n\nIn the final leg of the relay, tennis greats Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams were among the group of athletes that took the torch by boat back up the Seine River where French tennis legend Amélie Mauresmo would take over and run it through the streets of Paris to the Louvre.\n\nSeveral other French athletes, including the oldest living French Olympian Charles Coste, got a chance to pass the torch before the cauldron - a hot air balloon - was lit.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nIOC president Thomas Bach opens Olympics with message of solidarity\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach officially welcomed the more than 6,800 athletes that participated in the opening ceremony on Friday night with a strong message about “solidarity.”\n\n“You have come to Paris as athletes, now you are Olympians. Stepping into the Olympic village like generations of athletes before you: now I’m part of something bigger than myself. Now we all are part of an event that unites the world,” he said.\n\n“As olympians we care for each other.

He later met with hundreds of Olympic athletes in the Olympic Village to share a message, \"Give peace a chance.\"\n\n\"When our founder, Pierre de Coubertin, revived the Olympic Games 130 years ago — right here in Paris — he saw it as a way to promote peace among all nations and people of the world.

The term “breaking” comes from the instrumental breaks in song that are usually accompanied by beats.\n\nThe 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires was the event to put Breaking on the map, and it is now in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe athletes are called “B-Boys” and “B-Girls” and the matches are called “battles.”\n\nThe inaugural Olympic competition will take place on Aug. 9-10.\n\nThirty-two athletes qualified for the event. As the host country France was offered two host quotas (one per gender) while four universality places (two per gender) were on offer.\n\nTo be eligible for a universality place the athlete must have competed in the Olympic Qualifying Series (OQS) and placed in the top 24.\n\nThe other 26 athletes qualified through their performances in last year’s world championships, the respective continental Games (Africa, Asia, Europe, Pan Am, and Oceania) and the OQS held in Shanghai and Budapest in May and June, respectively.\n\nThe scoring is made up of five categories: musicality, vocabulary, originality, technique, and execution. Each category makes up 20% of the judge’s score.\n\nThe battles are best-of-three, and each athlete has 60 seconds to complete their routine. Athletes can be penalized for misbehavior at the judge’s discretion.\n\nEach day starts with a round-robin phase consisting of four groups of four.

Even as recent as early June tests done by the monitoring group Eau de Paris indicated unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria until recent improvements.\n\nAfter taking a dip, Hidalgo called today “a dream” and a “testimony that we have achieved a lot of work.”\n\nCleaning up the Seine River has been a longtime goal for the French. Former French President Jacques Chirac vowed to clean up the river back in 1988 when he was the Paris Mayor but to no avail.\n\nHidalgo was initially supposed to swim the Seine River in June, but it had to be delayed due to snap parliamentary elections in France.\n\nWhen the date was announced of Hidalgo’s swim, the French people got “I’m pooping in the Seine” trending online to protest the Olympic games by defecating upstream before the mayor’s swim.\n\nDespite the threat, today’s event went without incident as numerous city officials and athletes invited to swim were throwing a ball around in the water and having fun.\n\nThe Seine River will be featured during the opening ceremony and will be the host of several open water swimming events during the Olympic Games including marathon and swimming and swimming legs of the Olympic and Paralympic triathlons.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nPosted by Paulina Dedaj Share\n\nWho are the US flag bearers for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris?\n\nTeam USA has two flag bearers: LeBron James (basketball) and Coco Gauff (tennis).\n\nFor the American side, team captains and fellow players normally choose flag bearers.\n\nThe Paris Games will be James’ fourth Olympics.
