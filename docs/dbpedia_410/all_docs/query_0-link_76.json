        "text": "Product news\n\nBeiter Hit-Miss available!\n\nThe Beiter Hit-Miss System is a completely new concept in archery. Developed by Werner Beiter over 15 years, it offers the archer a different type of aiming, shooting and scoring compared to existing systems...And it is easier for spectators to understand.\n\nThe System consits of a foam target, incorporating yellow “Hit”-discs, which are plastic inserts available in different sizes.\n\nYou either HIT it or MISS it, 1 or 0!... it is visible and most times,... also audible! Different modules are available, with different sized Inserts, to allow for different levels or archer skill or bow type, e.g. Recurve or Compound\n\nFor training purposes you can also use the Björn paper target faces included in the kit.\n\nFollow this link to know more about the system.\n\nBeiter Armguards produced according to the EC-guidelines\n\nThe Beiter Armguard and the Beiter Armguard Soft are now certified to the PSA-Guidelines of the EC - 89/686/EWG: the EC-Certificate can be downloaded here.\n\nThe certificate is another quality aspect for the Beiter Armguard and Beiter Armguard Soft, which are exclusively produced in Germany, as all other Beiter Archery Accessories.\n\nBeiter Out Nocks for new Carbon Express shafts\n\nCarbon Express released two new arrow shafts, which can be used either with Beiter Pin-Out Nocks or with Beiter Out Nocks . To determine the correct Out Nock size we got directly from Carbon Express the outer diameters of the shafts:\n\nCarbon Express Nano Pro EXTREME:\n\n- Out-Nock 4,5, Pin-Out Nock 145 for Spine 650, 700, 750, 800, 900\n\n- Out-Nock 4,7, Pin-Out Nock 149 for Spine 550, 600\n\n- Out-Nock 4,92, Pin-Out Nock 149 for Spine 450, 500\n\n- Out-Nock 5,0, Pin-Out Nock 154 for Spine 400\n\nCarbon Express Nano SST:\n\n- Out-Nock 1800, Pin-Out Nock 149 for Spine 1000\n\n- Out-Nock 4,92, Pin-Out Nock 149 for Spine 800, 900\n\n- Out-Nock 5,0, Pin-Out Nock 154 for Spine 700, 750\n\n- Out-Nock 5,2, Pin-Out Nock 154 for Spine 600, 650\n\n- Out-Nock 5,4, Pin-Out Nock 154 for Spine 500, 550\n\n- Out-Nock 5,5 for Spine 450\n\n- Out-Nock 5,7 for Spine 400\n\nOur Nocksearch database is already updated!\n\nBeiter Scope 29 - Frame Kit!\n\nSeveral archers worldwide asked for an aiming option, which is reducing the outer diameter of the field of view.\n\nDue to the different available diameters of the Beiter Scope 29 Frame Kit, this is now possible.\n\nWorld Class Compound archer Karina Marshall - AUS - was active part in this new development: \"I am able to aim without a dot! I can now circle the target!\" she says.\n\nSo you can use the Frame Kit to aim or simply to reduce the field of view in your Beiter Scope 29mm.\n\nThe Frame Kit for Scope 29mm is available in 4 colours - Black, Red, White and Yellow - and it includes 4 Frames in following diameters: 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20mm.\n\nCheck it out at your local Beiter Dealer!\n\nBeiter Compound Rest Launcher +15mm!\n\nDer Beiter Compound Rest Launcher 50mm is 15mm longer than the Standard Launcher.\n\nThe Launcher 50mm must be used exclusively with the grey tilting block (20°) and is offered also as Conversion Kit.\n\nThe longer Launcher gives again more chances to do a Fine Tuning on the bow and gives a greater range to finde the needed Pivot Point.\n\nIdeally the Launcher 50mm should be used for the OD88 or OD116 models, but can also be used on the Standard Beiter Compound Rest.\n\nAvailable width: 5mm and 6mm. Available thickness: 0,30mm and 0,35mm.\n\nBeiter Nocke for Carbon Express Predator II\n\nBeiter produces direct fit insert nocks for all Carbon Express Predator II shafts!

We at Beiter, are proud to announce that we will be supporting the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nTo celebrate our on-going support of the Games, Werner has produced, for the first time ever, two very special limited edition branded target pins to be used at the London 2012 Games.\n\nChris Marsh, Archery Competition Manager at LOCOG said: ‘we are very grateful of Mr Beiter’s generosity at donating these target pins at both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. We were particularly delighted at his creativity in producing two separate branded target pins for each Games. This unique touch will truly add to making these Games an amazing event’.\n\nThe London 2012 Olympic Games begins with the Opening Ceremony, July 27th with the archery qualification round commencing earlier on the same day at Lord’s Cricket Ground. July 28th, the Men’s Team event, will be awarding one of the first medals of the Games and starting 7 days of archery competition.\n\nThe London 2012 Paralympic Games begins August 29th with the Opening Ceremony. The qualification round on August 30th, starts 7 days of Paralympic archery action at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich.\n\nBeiter In-Out Nock for Easton Pro Field!\n\nFor the Easton Pro Field shaft series, Beiter offers two choices of nocks. First of all the universal Beiter Pin-Nock series. But also the Beiter In-Out Nock series 2-95 are fitting the ACE Pro Field. Both nock series are available in #1 and #2 asymmetric, as well as Hunter (symmetric). Ask your dealer!\n\nBeiter Pin Nock!\n\nWerner Beiter has invented the Asymmetric Nock! Not only: he was the first, that was able to produce specific nocks in different shapes for most arrows on the market! He developed Insert-Nocks, Outnocks, InOut-Nocks and PinOut-Nocks, to be used directly in or on shafts or on Bushings or Pins.\n\nNow Werner Beiter introduces the first Asymmetric Pin Nock, to complete the product line. With the introduction of the Beiter Pin Nock, Werner Beiter can now offer a nock for all shafts, until now used with other nocks than the unique asymmetric Beiter nocks.\n\nWerner Beiter still suggests to use PinOut-Nocks instead of Pin-Nocks if the shaft/pin combination allows the us of it, because it fits and preserves better the shaft.\n\nThe new Beiter Pin-Nock is available in the Asymmetric sizes #1 (small groove) or #2 (large groove). The Symmetric Hunter Version is also available!\n\nBeiter Pin-Nocks are available in 15 colours!\n\nBeiter Nocks for Carbon Express X-Buster!\n\nBeiter produces a wide range of direct fit Insert Nocks, among others Insert Nocks for the Carbon Express X-Buster. Direct fit insert nocks do not need any Adapter, Bushing or Pin: therefor these are the most precise nocks available!\n\nDue to the two different inners diameters, 2 nocks are needed to fit all available shafts.\n\nThe Beiter Insert Nock 23-808 - available in #2 and Hunter - fits all shafts with spines from 350 to 500, as well as all CXL shafts.\n\nThe Beiter Insert Nock 2014 - available in #2 and later this year as Hunter - fits all shafts with spines from 600-700.\n\nAvailable at your Beiter Dealer!\n\nBoth Scopes Ø39 & Ø29 with new colours!\n\nThe Beiter Scopes diam. 29 as well as the diam. 39 are now available in two new colours: Blue and Silver!\n\nThe reknown Beiter Scopes are not only the lightest on the market, they are also the most versatile. The available accessories - like aiming dots and rings, centerin aids, crosshair.... - are only part of the versatility. You can now choose from SIX scope body colours: the new Blue and Silver, but also Black, Clear, Red and Green.\n\nAvailable at your favourite Archery Shop!\n\nBeiter Scope Ø29 K-Lens LIMITED BLACK EDITION!\n\nLots of accessories and a special deal!! This is the Black Edition of the Beiter Scope Ø29 K-Lens, delivered in an exclusive black box, which can accomodate the whole accessories delivered with.

To better present the whole String and Serving related product line, Beiter decided to offer you a Beiter Winder Profi-Tool Kit!\n\nIncluded are different Tools, which are helping a lot while working on strings and cables easier. Some of these tools can also be used for other purposes during the daily work of any archer. Savings: if you buy a Winder Profi Tool Kit you save money, compared to the single buying of all the components!\n\nIncluded:\n\n1 Beiter Winder Profi 1 Beiter Twister 1ea. Beiter String Tool #1 and 2 with Tool Clip 1ea. Beiter Serving Shifter #1 and 2 with Tool Clip 4 Belt Loops (to have String Tools and Serving Shifters safely mounted on belts) 1 Draw & Carry\n\nBeiter Compound Rest!\n\nIf you first see the Beiter Compound Rest, you may think: \"What a massive and bulky rest!\" - Yes - it is!\n\nBut as soon as you take it in your hands, you will notice, that the weight is relatively low... and it is not an impression. Werner Beiter used thermpolasts wherever possible to reduce weight, but still allowing as much stability as possible. Werner Beiter developed a revolutionary horizontal and vertical adjustment, which allows adjustments precise as 0,2mm: you could move the rest instead of the sight to move your group into the Center!\n\nBeiter Tattos: Just Cool!\n\nEasy to place, wherever you want! And easy to remove. Beiter Tattoo's are available at all Beiter Dealers!!\n\nBeiter Sight Tunnel diam. 8 - White and Red\n\nThe request to be able to buy the Sight Tunnel Ø8 in White respectively in Red started right after the introduction of the diam. 12 Sight Tunnel in these new colours.\n\nThe logical consequence for Werner Beiter was to react and offer White and Red as colour option for the small diam. 8 Sight Tunnel.\n\nThe Sight Tunnel is available in following combinations:\n\ndiam. 8 White complete\n\ndiam. 8 Red complete\n\ndiam. 8 White, single part\n\ndiam. 8 Red, single part\n\nThe last two versions can be individually completed by Frame Kit Inserts or Sight Inserts.\n\nIn the following pictures you can see both Sight Tunnel diam. 8 in combination with a Black Frame Kit Insert.\n\nBeiter Centralizer \"White\" and \"Pink\"\n\nThe Beiter Centralizer is now available in two new stylish colours: \"White\" and \"Pink\"!\n\nBoth new colours are available - as the Black Edition - as single Long Rods or complete Set with Side Rods, Extender and V-Bar. Both stabilizer will have Tuner, Adapter and Covers coloured the same way: candy white and shocking pink!\n\nLogically you can combine both colours if you want and have a marshmellow-like pink-white or white-pink stabilizer!!\n\nAs for all other Beiter Centralizer, also these colours are made of a new UV-resistent pigment.\n\nPeep Centering Aid for Scope Ø39\n\nAfter the introduction of the Peep Centering Aid for Scope Ø29 Werner Beiter had a great amount of requests to have the same system for the Beiter Scope Ø39 as well! Immediately Mr. Beiter has reacted and presents now the Peep Centering Aid for Scope Ø39!!\n\nThe Beiter Scope Ø39 is the lightest large diameter Scope on the market and has a very thin scope housing. Sometimes too thin!\n\nTo better show the outline of the Scope, Werner Beiter produces now a set of 4 Centering Rings for the Scope Ø39.\n\nThanks to the 4 rings in different colours, you can interchange them according to your needs. The Kit includes following coloured rings: Yellow, Green, Red and Black.\n\nPeep Centering Aid for Scope Ø29\n\nThe Beiter Scope Ø29 has now a new very helpful accessories kit: the Peep Centering Aid!\n\nThe Beiter Scope Ø29 is the ligthest Scope on the market and its body is very thin. Sometimes too thin!\n\nTo better show the outline of the Scope, Werner Beiter produces now a set of 4 Centering Rings. Thanks to the 4 rings in different colours, you can interchange them according to your needs.\n\nThe Kit includes following coloured rings: Yellow, Green, Red and Black. Ask your dealer to try it out on your Scope Ø29!\n\n(In the picture you see a red Peep Centering aid mounted on a black Scope)\n\nBeiter Nocks - Updated compatibility list\n\nEvery year new arrow shafts are launched on the market. On our website you find a Nock Search Tool: this allows you to find the correct nock to almost all arrow shafts worldwide. A compatbility list of the latest Easton and Victory shafts can be downloaded here.\n\nBeiter Bow Wrench\n\nThe Beiter Bow Wrench has been developed especially for archers by Werner Beiter together with the leading German Tool Company WIHA.\n\nThis Tool includes 11 Hex Wrenches (8 inches, 3 metric) and one little screw driver. Due to the patented push out knob you can easily open the tool and take out the wrenches ONE AT A TIME!!!\n\nThe metric keys can be for example used for the Beiter Plunger or the Beiter Centralizer, but also for Shibuya Sights and many other products not produced in the US.\n\nThe screw driver was specifically included for the Plunger, but can also be used to remove and install E-Clips on the axles of Compound bows.\n\nSimply said: a practical tool for many needs!\n\nBeiter Serving Shifter #1\n\nThe large number of different string diameters forced Werner Beiter to produce a second - smaller - size of his Serving Shifter.\n\nThe Beiter Serving Shifter #1 is white and can be used also on very small strings (e.g. a Fast Flight 10 strands string) to move or compact the serving.\n\nThe Serving Shifter is available in pairs (1ea. #1 and #2) or in the respective size (#1 or #2) in the handy Tool-Clip.\n\nSight Tunnel Ø12 - Red and White\n\nSince several years the Beiter Sight Tunnel is available in Black and Clear.\n\nThe Beiter SIGHT TUNNEL Ø12 is now available also in two brandnew colours: Red and White.\n\nEspecially since the introduction of the Sight Tunnel Frame Kits, archers changed their attitude to aim, demanding for more contrast on the target.\n\nWith the White and Red Sight Tunnel Ø12 any archer has one more option to find his perfect way to aim.\n\nBeiter String Tool #2, 12,7mm (1/2\")\n\nThe Beiter String Tool #2, White, 12,7mm (1/2\") has been created to better insert any peep into a string. The already known String Tool #1 (Schwarz) - which is smaller - helps to first separate the string, the String Tool #2 makes it than easy to find the center of the string and to insert the Peep. The Beiter String Tool will be in future available in following combinations:\n\n- String&Clip Tool #2, White, 12,7mm (1/2\"), single\n\n- String&Clip Tool #1, Black, 9,5mm, single\n\n- String Tool #1 (Black) & #2 (White), sold in pairs\n\nBeiter Nock 3-49 for Easton H-System\n\nThe Beiter Insert Nock 3-49 can fit following Easton shafts directly, normally using the Easton H-Nock, without any bushing: ST Epic, ST Epic Camo, ST Epic Junior & ST Excel\n\nPlunger Spare Parts Kit\n\nAll what is needed to complete a Beiter Plunger, to make it shorter or longer or to replace used parts.\n\nEach Beiter dealer will have available following parts for your Beiter plunger.\n\nThe box includes:\n\n1ea. Nuts 7mm and 11mm in Black and Silver 5ea. Spanner Yellow, Spanner Red 5 Distance Bolt 5 ea. Spring 0,45, 0,60, 0,70 5 Springball 5 Pin Light 34mm, Pin Black 36mm, Pin Blue 38mm, Pin Green 42mm, Pin DarkGreen 44mm 5 pairs of Allen Hex Screws and Washer 2 Allen Head Wrench 1,5mm 2 Screwdriver\n\nBeiter Workstation\n\nThe Beiter Workstation 100 helps to keep your desk, counter or working table clean, holding different tools and accessories in place, needed to work on arrows, as for example glue, points, vanes, your Beiter Tri-Liner, Beiter Extractor, Beiter Wingholder, Beiter String Tool, Beiter Serving Shifter or the Deburring Tool, Plier, scissors, knives,...\n\nNot only, the Beiter Workstation 100 is an aid while installing points and feltching up to 6 arrows at a time.You may also easily store winter arrows in summer and summer arrows in winter!\n\nBeiter Limb Tip Line Gauge\n\nThe Beiter Limb Tip Line Gauges help to determine limb straightness and torsion.\n\nOne set of 4 gauges (#0421/0441/0461/0481) has sizes from 20,0-34,5mm: at least three of them can be placed on the tips of each available limb on the market.\n\nThe Beiter Limb Tip Line Gauges must be placed between the string and the limbs: this avoids the string to be retained in the string groove and shows if the limb alignment is good.\n\nBest if used together with a Beiter Brace hold on a Beiter RipClutch or Beiter Bow Holder System. We suggest also to use Beiter Limb Line Gauges #0401.\n\nBeiter X-Ruler for Recurve\n\nThe Beiter Limb X-Ruler is made to determine the center of the limb along the whole length of it. It is delivered with a rubber band and a Beiter Fastener, to be able to keep it fixed.\n\nIt must be used together with a Beiter Limb Line Gauge #0401!\n\nBeiter Multi Tool by Kaindl\n\nWith the Multi Tool for the Beiter Ripclutch System you can hold the bow in almost each position you need, but having two free hands to be able to work on it. You can easily mount accessories (such as Sights, Peeps, Arrow Rests, Plunger...) , serve your servings, adjust the Center Shot, control the alignement of the limbs and much more.\n\nBeiter Half-a-Nock\n\nThe Beiter Half-a-Nock has been developed to make it easier to serve-in a Beiter Nocking Point.\n\nAfter you have decided the correct position of the Beiter Nocking Point, you can install a pair of Beiter Half-a-Nock to hold the two halves of the Beiter Nocking Point, allowing you to concentrate on Serving the string e.g. with your Beiter Winder, aided by the Twister, String Tool, Serving Shifter...!\n\nArmguard SOFT\n\nThe new Beiter Armguard SOFT is completing the Beiter Armguard line, in addition to the well known Beiter Armguard, which will be available with any changes, being a little bit less expensive than the SOFT version.\n\nThe Beiter Armguard SOFT has the same design but is made out of a high quality and very flexible plastic.\n\nThanks to 3 rubber bands and 3 Fastener as well as ist soft material the Beiter Armguard SOFT can adapt better to the forearm, without loosing the gliding properties.\n\nThe Fastener are black, except for the colour white: in this case the Fastener are white. The Beiter Armguard SOFT is available in 14 solid colours, 10 of those are the same than the covers of the Beiter Centralizer Stabilizer System, these are the colours:\n\nRed, Yellow, Gray, Oyster, Pearl, Black, Orange, White, Azure and Darkgreen.\n\nScope Ø29 - NEW LEVEL!\n\nThe glass level system for Scope Ø29 has been replaced by a new level system, including a\n\nlevel with a new liquid and a new designed holder for it. This new level system can be used in ALL Beiter Scopes Ø29 on the market. Advantages: The new level is supposed to fade slower as other levels on the market and will keep the colour by far longer than the actual system. The old level system did loose the colour cause of UVA and UVB rays in a short period of time. The new level is not glued in ist holder and can therefor be replaced – e.g. with another coloured levels – very easily and fast. Available colours of the new level: Green, Blue and Red.\n\nThe holder is available only in clear. The new system is less expensive as the old one!\n\nBeiter Draw & Carry\n\nThe Beiter ”Draw & Carry” is a very versatile tool, available in many different colours and can be used for various purposes: to carry shopping bags (without compressing your finger joints and nervs), warm-Up exercises for Archery (with a Thera-Band®), etc.\n\nIt helps also to avoid Dry-Fire by trying to draw a Compound and can be used as a Key Chain in combination with a Beiter String Tool!\n\nBeiter Serving Shifter\n\nThe Beiter Serving Shifter is a practical tool, which allows to move the Center Serving or the End Serving on the string (e.g. if you want to move the Nocking Point).\n\nNot only – and much more important! – it allows to „compact“ the serving.\n\nMaking your own strings - normally - you can not put enough tension in the serving tool to achieve a very tight serving. Therefor it makes sense to move 3 to 5 windings a time approx 2mm to one direction… you will see that at the end the serving moved much more!! This means that you serving is more compact, tighter and will last longer!\n\nThe Beiter Serving Shifter can be stored and carried in the Beiter Tool Clip (the same used for the Beiter String Tool), for example attached to your quiver… ready to be used!\n\nBeiter Brace\n\nThe Beiter Brace is available at your local Beiter dealer! It is a tool for your Recurve Bow, which allows you to determine the Center Shot at extended draw, to measure the tiller in almost any position until your full draw length and to see the alignement of the lims at full draw.\n\nBeiter already produces some tools for a better use of the Beiter Brace, such as the Beiter Rip Clutch System, the Beiter Bow Holder, the Beiter Limb Line Gauges and very soon the Beiter Limb X-Ruler.\n\nBeiter Extractor\n\nThe Beiter Extractor has been developed to be able to extract broken nocks from an arrow shaft, without trouble and without damaging the end of the arrow.\n\nThe heat resistent plastic handpiece can be hold while the screw can be heated that much, to be able to be melt in the broken nock end.\n\nAfter some seconds you simply pull the Extractor and the broken nock comes out with it!\n\nTo exchange (pull and installl) nocks which are not broken, you can use Beiter's Push'n'Pull Tool.\n\nThe Beiter Extractor is available in two sizes:\n\nØ2,5mm,In-Out Nock for X-10, e.g. 0X1, 0X2, 0XH Ø3,0mm, for following nock sizes: 12/1, 12/2, 12/2H, 2X1S, 2X2S, 2X1L, 2X2L, 2X2H, 295X1, 295X2, 295XH, 265X1, 265X2, 265XH\n\nFrame Kit for Sight Tunnel Ø8mm\n\nThe overhelming acceptance of the Frame-Kit-Inserts for the Sight Tunnel diam.12 mm pushed Werner Beiter to produce the same aiming system also for the smaller diam. 8mm Sight Tunnel. You defintely have to try the Beiter Frame-Kit-Insert, which fits all Beiter diam. 8mm Sight Tunnels! Available in Clear, Red or Black, in the sizes 3 - 4 - 5 and 6mm.\n\nBeiter Rip-Clutch Info-Flyer\n\nThe Rip-Clutch-System developed by Werner Beiter is used by many dealers and archers world wide... and they love it.
