An Olympic sport that debuted in 1900, archery was a mainstay of the early Olympics through 1920, but fell out of favor, not to return until 1972. Since then, however, it's been a consistent presence and the 2024 Paris Games will be no different.

Team USA is sending four archers – one man and three women – to the City of Light in search of the nation's first gold medal in the event since 1996.

In Olympic archery, athletes are judged primarily based on their scoring accuracy, which reflects their ability to consistently hit the target’s scoring zone, with higher scores awarded for closer shots to the center.

Judges also assess the archer’s technique, including stance, draw, anchor, and release. Consistency throughout the competition, both in performance and adherence to rules, is crucial for athletes aiming to end up in top rankings and placements.

Four-time Olympian Brady Ellison leads the roster in Paris. The 35-year-old three-time Olympic medalist is gearing up for his last shot at Olympic glory. Ellison came into the 2020 Tokyo Games ranked No. 1 in the world, but fell short during the quarterfinals and lost to Mete Gazoz of Turkiye.

World No. 1 Casey Kaufhold, 20, is leading the U.S.'s women’s roster. Kaufhold began archery at a young age. In 2023, she became the first American woman to hold the World No. 1 ranking in women's recurve, per her Team USA profile. She's hoping to become the first U.S woman to win an individual medal since 1976, when Luann Ryon won gold in Montreal.

In a 2024 interview with Team USA, Kaufhold spoke to what extent Ellison has inspired her career thus far as gear up for the Olympics. “So, the thing that he’s taught me is that no matter where you are, just step up there and do the same thing you do every time.” She said. “It’s nothing special. It’s still the same you, the same bow, the same arrow, and the same target.”

“We are all genuinely excited,” said Kaufhold. “The dream of winning gold is no longer just a dream, it’s now the goal.”
