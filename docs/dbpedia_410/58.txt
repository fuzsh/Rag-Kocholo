Thirty-two countries will be represented at the Indoor Archery World Championships in Yankton over the weekend. The director at the archery center in Yankton, Bruce Cull, said the staff has been planning for two years for the competition. A 25,000 square foot space was added on to the existing center to accommodate for this competition.

More than 300 athletes will compete in the championships with the finals happening Sunday and Monday. The competition starts at 9:00 AM both of those days. It is free to the public if they would like to attend and watch the competition. The athletes will compete on teams of three in various rounds and will also compete individually. Rod White is a former athlete who won a gold medal in the 1996 Olympics in a team competition. He said for many of the athletes who are not competing for the United States, they are hoping to win money from their respective countries. The government pays them if they win. For the athletes in the United States, they are competing more for prestige.

Cull believes the championships will bring in more than $1,000,000 to the city of Yankton.
