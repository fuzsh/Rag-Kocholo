        "text": "Beyond Good & Evil\n\nMichel Ancel leaves his limbless wonder behind in search of something a little more real. Let's take a closer look at the highly promising BG&E.\n\nVersion\n\nAll PlatformsDeveloper\n\nUbiSoft Publisher\n\nUbiSoft Genre\n\nAdventure\n\nBy Alex Wollenschlaeger\n\nMichel Ancel, the father of Rayman, apparently has an itch that he's been struggling to scratch for nearly a decade. During that time, the developer has been thinking about and working on a game that would offer gamers more than just a simple bounded-by-genre experience. The talented Frenchman wanted to create a game that is a lot more real, a living, breathing world where players would be able to reach their goals through various means in ways that surpass the lame attempts of would-be jacks-of-all-trades. That game is Beyond Good & Evil.\n\nWhile the title might suggest a bent for German philosopher Nietzsche, the reality that sets the backdrop for this ambitious title is equally heavy. BG&E is set in an Orwellian world rife with conspiracies involving alien invaders and government propaganda that is used to keep the bourgeois at bay. Lead character Jade is having none of that, however. You see, Jade is a photo-journalist, and it's up to her to bring to light the machinations of the government juggernaut and in so doing to spark an upheaval among the citizens of Hyllis.\n\nNo doubt, BG&E has a much deeper story to tell than the majority of its brethren, and that complexity extends to the gameplay experience as well. A chief concern for Ancel was to create a logical world in which players can decide for themselves how they want to precede. Melding together driving, combat, exploration and stealth gameplay styles was never going to be easy, but the principal idea behind the project was to make these different styles as transparent to players as possible. The best style for a given section is the one that the player has decided on based on a logical analysis of the task at hand.\n\nImportantly, the game has also been designed with user friendliness in mind, so there are no major changes in the control setup as the game switches between its multitude of styles. Instead, the game relies on context sensitive controls throughout, meaning that the same pull of the analog stick that will have you jumping off ledges will have you climbing up rocks. While the different styles are not as in-depth as their fully fledged ilk in stand-alone games, they offer a satisfying experience without all of the heartache involved in learning the nuances of a half-dozen control schemes.\n\nA major part of the BG&E experience is Jade's hovercraft. While she can--and does--use the hovercraft for such routine chores as moving about the massive, aquatic game world, her ride is also used in vehicular combat missions that involve taking down alien monsters and other assorted baddies. The hovercraft can be upgraded by picking up pearls that are scattered around the world or offered as rewards for besting bosses. Upgrades include such simple additions as weapons and extend to overhauls that allow the hovercraft to become a hoverjet for flying around areas.\n\nGiving the world a wake-up call is hard work, so it's a good thing that Jade will have a lot of help in her mission. The principal supporting cast member is Jade's own adoptive uncle Pey'j, a burly, anthropomorphic pig. Pey'j will be a constant presence during the course of the game, with some of the story progression coming from conversations with the character.\n\nWhile there are several missions where Jade will have to watch her uncle's back, the game will also contain sections in which players take control of both characters simultaneously. For the most part, though, the game's AI takes care of the task of keeping Pey'j alive. Adding to the colorful cast is Secundo, a computer assistant that tells you how to progress further. In keeping with the game's emphasis on user-friendliness, audio hints are given if you stand around obviously not knowing what you're supposed to be doing.\n\nAs an investigative reporter, Jade's most important tool is her camera, which she must use to take photos that will convince the public of the wrongdoing of the government. But that's not where the photographic fun ends, however. Jade can also take photos of the hordes of intriguing animals that populate the planet. These photos are then immediately exchanged for cash, which will allow Jade to make essential purchases such as upgrades for equipment.\n\nThroughout the development process, one of the key aspects that Ancel wanted to infuse the game with is an epic, cinematic feel. Consistent with this, BG&E is one of the first games to be presented exclusively in glorious 16:9, widescreen format. The game itself is a visual cornucopia, with detail upon detail slathered onto the lush production designs.\n\nThe first few years of development went towards developing the Jade Engine, the graphical engine that powers both BG&E and Ubi Soft Montreal's upcoming Prince of Persia game. As a testament to the meticulousness of the design team, an enormous effort was made to bring the graphics of each version of the game to the peak offered by its respective platform, and with the game hitting all three home consoles and the PC, this is no mean feat.\n\nThe game features a rich world teaming with life and a highly detailed character models. Jade has undergone some radical changes in her wardrobe in the last couple months, shedding the tank-top and sweatshirt look for something a little less trendy and a lot more green. Equally revamped is Pey'j, who has gone from a respectable suit-and-tie wearing pig to a vest-wearing, tattooed swine.\n\nThe cinematic goals of the visuals are echoed by the sound design, which has been tweaked for optimal effect on each of the platforms. GameCube and PlayStation 2 owners can look forward to Dolby Pro Logic II audio, while Xbox and PC owners reap the rewards of their more powerful architecture by being able to make use of full Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The game makes extensive use of voice acting, and opponents of this oft-controversial inclusion will be pleased to hear that the quality extends to this facet of the production as well.\n\nThe critics are already waiting in the wings, daggers in hand, to storm BG&E and declare it an over-reaching could-have-been. But Michel Ancel is ready for them. His title exudes style, and the immediately obvious attention to detail and consistency of concept that effuses through the game is sure to win over many a gamer. Ubi Soft has been on a roll of late, and with the release of Beyond Good & Evil imminent, that trend is sure to continue."
