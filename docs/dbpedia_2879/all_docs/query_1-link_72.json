        "text": "After many months of rumours, a Beyond Good & Evil remaster has been officially announced by Ubisoft. Not only that, the game will be launching next week – on June 25th – for “all platforms”. This will include PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\nThe Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition offers a range of enhancements, making it playable on newer systems in 4K and at 60 frame per second depending on which platform you pick it up on. It will also feature brand new content, laying some narrative groundwork for long-awaited sequel, Beyond Good & Evil 2.\n\nThe game was announced during the Limited Run Games showcase, though Ubisoft accidentally went live with a trailer via its official social media account on X (formerly Twitter). The remaster was previously leaked last year with information on the game appearing on the Xbox store. Here’s what to expect from the upcoming re-release (via Ubisoft):\n\nAbout\n\nReturn to Hillys alongside Jade, Pey’J, Double H and all of Beyond Good & Evil‘s colorful characters and embark on a journey that will -literally- take you to the Moon!\n\nDiscover the new Anniversary Gallery, the re-orchestrated iconic Soundtrack and more in this special edition !\n\nThe Best Way to Play\n\nPlay Beyond Good & Evil in the best way possible with upgraded performances up to 4K, 60 frames per second and numerous quality of life improvements including autosave, cutscene-skip, full controller and keyboard & mouse support, and cross-save across all platforms.\n\nOn the Hunt for Treasure\n\nLearn more about Jade’s childhood and her link to Beyond Good & Evil 2 thanks to a new treasure hunt throughout Hillys!
