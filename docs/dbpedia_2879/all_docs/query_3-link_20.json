        "text": "Industry\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 Ship and Crew Update developer diary\n\nPublished 16 hours ago. 14 comments.\n\nPlus other tidbits from today's live stream.\n\n​\n\nUbisoft has released a new developer diary for Beyond Good and Evil 2 providing an update on the games ships and crews.\n\nDuring an hour-long live stream today, the development team at Ubisoft Montpellier shared more information about the game. Here are the notable tidbits, via Eurogamer:\n\n​\n\nThe game can be played single-player, but the team wanted users to be able to play with friends. Senior producer Guillaume Brunier said, A part of the story will be the story you tell as you meet and play with friends, and added that there will also be traditional narrative-lead stories with a beginning, middle and end, with strong characters, which will emotional.\n\nYour crew will help progress the story, rather than chat with an AI helper. Here we want [to feature] the crew members, the officers, you will meet on your journey, said creative director Michel Ancel. Like PeyJ and Double H. We dont want to force an AI  we want players to meet characters. A bit more digital and a bit less physical\n\nIn one storyline, you meet a chimp named Knox whose planet you visit and meet his family. Because of the game engines ability to create animal hybrid characters that look like others, Knoxs family will look similar to him.\n\nThe game engine allows for seamless transition from a small teahouse somewhere in a big city to a giant spaceship in space.\n\nThe development team has almost tripled in size since E3. Right now the focus is building a real, vibrant city for people to explore, according to Brunier, referring to the city shown in the E3 2017 trailer.\n\nRegarding whether Beyond Good and Evil 2 is a prequel, Ancel said, The first idea for Beyond Good & Evil was to make three games, a trilogy. But when we started thinking about the next game we thought the [series] world was so big, so dense it would be a shame to not talk about its origins. Who is Jade? Shes very mysterious. She has a dark side. We want to go deeper into these things. He continued, And will continue going through the episodes, the stories of this world, he added. But we wanted to start with a prequel.\n\nWatch the developer diary below.\n\n[YT]wf3t5p2XDAg[/YT]\n\n​\n\nsource: Gematsu\n\nIndustry\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 Staff Combat and Ship Maneuvers gameplay\n\nPublished 15 hours ago. 50 comments.\n\nMany surprises planned for E3 2018.\n\nUbisoft has released a new work-in-progress pre-alpha gameplay video of Beyond Good and Evil 2 showcasing how players can navigate the world via jetpack and ship, how groups of co-op players can stay close when traveling at high speeds by forming an armada, and how melee combat is coming together.\n\nAdditionally, during todays Space Monkey Report #2 live stream, Beyond Good and Evil 2 creative director Michel Ancel said the development team is preparing many surprises for E3 2018, which runs from June 12 to 14 in Los Angeles.\n\nHere is an overview of the game, via Ubisoft:​\n\nJourney to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisofts most beloved games! Fight alongside unforgettable characters in a stunning new solar system, as you struggle for freedom and the right to determine your own fate among the stars. Play the adventure by yourself or with friends in a vast and seamless online playground.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 is the spiritual successor to the cult classic, a prequel that will transport players into a profoundly multicultural world, capturing the spirit of the original with grandiose decors and intense dramas that play out across a vast universe. Through the Space Monkey Program, Ubisoft Montpellier will be developing the game alongside its community of fans.\n\nSystem 3 has become the center of interstellar trade and colonization in the Milky Way of the 24th century, thanks to the creation of Hybrid slaves. While private enterprises fight over resources and power, the first colonists weave together the rich and diverse spiritual and cultural heritages of Old Earth to give meaning to their existence. In this new era of piracy, we will rise from lowly pirate to legendary captain at the helm of massive star-faring vessels, adventuring alongside crews of colorful characters to fight for freedom and the right to determine our own fate among the stars!​\n\n​\n\nA release date and platform(s) for Beyond Good and Evil 2 have yet to be announced.\n\nWatch the new footage below.\n\n[YT]qz_F-Hh4xs4[/YT]\n\n​\n\nsource:Gematsu\n\nIndustry\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 private demo showcase set for E3 2018\n\nPublished 21 hours ago. 9 comments.\n\nRSVP now for a chance to attend.\n\nUbisoft will showcase a private demo of Beyond Good and Evil 2 to a few select members of the Space Monkey Program at E3 2018, the company announced in an e-mail sent out to members of the program.\n\nSelected Space Monkeys selected will receive a free Gamer Pass to attend E3 2018 and see the demo on June 14.

The sequel was official announced during last year's Ubisoft E3 conference and immediately became one of the most eagerly anticipated games of the next few years. Sadly, it seems that the Michel Ancel-directed sequel won't be released anytime soon andBG&E2 may actually be a next-gen title just like Bethesda's Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI.\n\nThe third Beyond Good and Evil 2's \"Space Monkey\" report hasn't revealed much regarding the game's release date of dedicated platforms. Instead of focusing on core gameplay mechanics, the Ubisoft Montpelier crew had decided to spotlight the community’s involvement in Beyond Good and Evil 2's creation process. If you can't wait to see actual gameplay from Michel Ancel's sequel, the fourth report featuring a demo from BG&E2's latest build will be livestreamed on December 10, 2018.\n\nThanks to the latest report, we know that Rayman composer Christophe Héral will return to score the sequel, as David Gasman will voice uncle Pey'j one more time. The video also gives you a chance to meet the game's cast and see the community's hard work that has been created in collaboration with HitRecord. Ubisoft has also released the portraits of the game’s key character you'll meet in the game.\n\nTake a look:\n\nJourney to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisoft’s most beloved games!

All these basic items can be upgraded with special augmentations to create even more deadly possibilities in combat. This and many other core features of the upcoming space opera were spotlighted during The Space Monkey Report #4 that just ended.\n\nThanks to the stream, we have now our first opportunity to take a look at Beyond Good and Evil 2's core gameplay mechanics. The said gameplay (that's actually over 20 minutes long) was initially shown to the press at this year's E3, but a lot of things has changed since then. Now, the game's even bigger, as Ubisoft Montpelier is aiming to create one of the biggest and richest sandbox games of all time.\n\nAt the moment, Beyond Good and Evil 2 is being created by five Ubisoft game development studios located in Montpellier, Barcelona, Sofia, Bordeaux, and Mainz, where one Blue Byte studio is based.\n\nJust like in No Man's Sky, BG&E2 is playable solo or in co-op, but even if you’re playing with a friend you don’t have to stick together, as you may have different objectives to do in-game. When it comes to the customization, you can design not only your own ship, but also your very own character, including the avatar's gender, appearance, and their DNA.

While we know that the game is being created by Ubisoft's internal studios located in Montpellier, Barcelona, Sofia, Bordeaux, and Mainz, we have no idea if it's a current, next, or maybe even cross-gen title, not to mention any news regarding the highly anticipated Michel Ancel-helmed project’s release date.\n\nThe BG&E2 team has gathered a plenty of answers to the community’s burning questions from the recent Space Monkey livestream chat and social media, and it sounds like even Ubisoft doesn't know what the space opera will actually launch, as the publisher representative explained on the game's website that they are not ready yet to answer the never-ending questions about BG&E2's release date.\n\nFans of Uncle Pey'j should be happy to hear that the monkey and pig hybrids will be in the final game, just like other hybrids appearing briefly in the trailers. According to Ubisoft, they are putting a heavy emphasis on Indian and Chinese cultures that will apparently have major roles in the game, but other parts of the world will also be represented in the title, as the developers' goal is to build systems that will make you feel like \"the World around you [...] react to your visual identity.\"\n\nUbisoft hasn't revealed if the parasitic, alien species from the first BG&E known as DomZ waging war over planet Hillys would return in the upcoming sequel, but they confirmed that the Alpha Sections will be back in BG&E2. \"Keep in mind that, since this is a prequel, we want to explore the origins of many elements from the first game (as many as possible, actually),\" Ubisoft explained.\n\nWhile it all sounds pretty good so far, the potentially bad news is that \"Beyond Good and Evil 2 is an online, multiplayer game with a rich co-op and seamless experience. As such, the game will only be playable with an internet connection in order to have seamless navigation, receive dynamic updates, and play with friends (which is certainly better when you're playing as a Space Pirate!).\"\n\nUnlike the first game, BG&E2 will require a constant connection to the Internet to be played, following in Tom Clancy's The Division's footsteps that also forces you to be always online, as a permanent internet connection is needed in order to play that Ubisoft title. Although the connection is required, you won't have to play with others, as experiencing BG&E2 solo is possible if that's what you want.\n\nThankfully, there will apparently be absolutely no limit to the distance between different players in the actual game, and that was made possible thanks to Ubisoft Montpelier's all-new engine, Voyager.\n\nJourney to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisoft’s most beloved games!

Ganesha City will reflect that particular approach, as it was founded on the planet Soma by the cloned members of an India-based corporation, Ubisoft has revealed.\n\nAccording to the French publisher, Ganesha \"is the capital of Soma and a popular metropolis for tourists, as well as a center of industrial and commercial activity for the whole System.\" The city is divided into several inter-dependent districts, two of which you will find described down below:\n\nOld City District\n\nCreated as a destination for spiritual experiences, most of the historical part of the city, like the giant statue of the Hindu divinity Ganesh, was built on top of the ancient foundations of Soma’s first colonial outpost. This central district contains the main thoroughfare where the System’s key corporations have flashy showrooms to exhibit their technological prowess and their role in the creation of this new civilization.\n\nThe Temples, lush gardens and shops, which adorn the upper parts of this district (and are forbidden to hybrids), attract tourists from across the System. Meanwhile, in the lower depths of the city, the older, buried and abandoned temples have come to serve many purposes, including sanctuaries for fugitive hybrid slaves and defective clones fleeing the oppressive system, black markets, drug dens, illicit laboratories and other unsavory activities.\n\nThe shining city we see in our first Beyond Good and Evil 2 cinematic trailer for E3 2017 was built on the backs of hybrid slave labor, who form an underclass relegated to the lower areas of the city.\n\nThis district, at the very heart of Ganesha City, offers a view of all the other city’s districts.\n\nEntertainment District\n\nLet us entertain you! Golden Ganesh looks down his trunk at the sprawling entertainment district on the waterfront of his Sacred City…\n\nFar from the fancy showrooms, luxurious shops and gardens, and impressive temples at the city’s traditional heart, an entertainment empire welcomes the Surya System’s tourists, gamblers, and thrill-seekers, bringing Ganesha City residents and tourists alike an array of food, drink, sports, casinos… and many more, well let’s just say, carnal pleasures…\n\nHere on the waterfront, an Entertainment Corporation runs the business of fun. An arena hosts extreme sports events, such as hybrid blood sports, where hybrid slaves and renegade human clones fight each other to the death, much like the gladiators of Old Earth. On another day, you might find Death Races, where the best space racers can take on one of Zhou Yuzhu pet pilots… or each other!\n\nBet on yourself and you might win a whole lot of moolah! Remember Zhou? Well, he’s the official head of the Entertainment Corporation who runs this district in Ganesha City and the man, uh… pig, who keeps the dark underbelly of this sprawling district as dangerous as it is fascinating.\n\nJust like No Man's Sky, BG&E2 will be playable solo or in co-op, but even if you’re playing with a friend you won't be forced to stick together, as you may freely explore the beauty of Genosha (and other, yet unannounced cities) on your own, even if you and your friend are traversing totally different planets on the antipodes of System 3. While the sandbox extravaganza's release date is still a mystery, we will definitely learn more about the Michel Ancel-directed space opera at Ubisoft's E3 2019 conference.\n\nJourney to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisoft’s most beloved games! Fight alongside unforgettable characters in a stunning new solar system, as you struggle for freedom and the right to determine your own fate among the stars.

While Ubisoft has already released plenty of fascinating details on Soma, one of the most important planets of System 3, and its oriental capital, known as Ganesha City, now it's time to learn more about the dark side of this planet-sized moon.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, \"Soma, the first place to be colonized in System 3, is not only the home to Ganesha City, but also Naraka, the Diwalite-rich “dark side” of this planet-sized moon. Orbiting around Dyaus and forever turned away from the protection of this gas giant, Naraka is a craterous and treacherous land frequently bombarded by meteorites, where the business of collecting Diwalite gets serious… and deadly.\" In BG&E2, Diwalite is a rare metal that can be combined with other materials and programmed to generate complex structures and, most importantly, living organisms.\n\nOn Soma, hybrids are forced by their corporate masters to risk their lives in a harsh environment to gather the dangerous and powerful resource raining down from the skies. In the prequel, you will take on the role of a space pirate, so you will have to choose between attacking hybrid slave ships and free them by force and boarding Diwalite transport ships in an attempt to steal their precious cargo.\n\nBe sure to take a look at the deadly Naraka zone in the latest Beyond Good & Evil 2 concept art below:\n\nJourney to System 3, for the prequel to one of Ubisoft’s most beloved games!
