        "text": "A sequel to Beyond Good and Evil could be in development by Ubisoft, its chief executive has hinted.\n\nTo many gamers, the 2003 action adventure is the great lost franchise – the series that Ubisoft should have spent the past decade creating new instalments for, but failed to do so.\n\nIn 2008, a follow-up was announced, but never materialised – though it was always assumed to be in development.\n\nMore recently, game site IGN published an interview with Ubisoft’s sales chief, Tony Key, who seemed to suggest that designer Michel Ancel had abandoned the project.\n\nUbisoft later denied this, but would not reveal more details.\n\nHowever, the Guardian met Yves Guillemot, who co-founded Ubisoft in 1986, at the E3 expo in Los Angeles, and asked directly whether Beyond Good and Evil 2 was still in development. He replied: “I can’t say the name, but there is a team working with Michel Ancel on a project that is... very interesting.”\n\nWhen pressed on the connection between this new project and Beyond Good and Evil, Guillemot said: “It’s a game I’m sure you will like very much, and we can’t say more.”\n\nReleased in 2003 to considerable critical acclaim, Beyond Good and Evil is an action adventure set on a futuristic world ruled by an oppressive alien race.\n\nLead protagonist, Jade, is a young photojournalist who discovers a link between the extraterrestrials and a sinister human trafficking industry.\n\nPlayers and reviewers appreciated the interesting protagonist, the atmospheric setting and the witty script – but it failed to sell in large numbers. Is that why Ubisoft has demurred over a possible sequel? “Michel knows that. He’s going to consider that,” said Guillemot.\n\nHowever, when asked about the difficulty of squaring fan enthusiasm with commercial reality, he seemed more forthright: “For us, what counts when we create the next game is that we feel can make the best possible game.”\n\nGuillemot added: “There are some limits that we have to get rid of, because things have changed in the meantime, but there are elements we can keep. That’s why we don’t want to say anything until we are well advanced on the project. It’s too early to say.”\n\nThere are reasons to believe that the project is happening. The enthusiastic response for both Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst and Shenmue 3 during this year’s E3 expo suggest that the nostalgia of a comparatively small group of dedicated fans can easily carry a lesser-known classic into mainstream territory.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 would have fitted in perfectly at this year’s E3, a show that recorded both a rise in the number of female protagonists and a huge number of reboots, remakes and returns.\n\n‘Have patience’\n\nAncel, meanwhile, now has his own small studio, Wild Sheep, but thisdoes not rule out his involvement in a new Beyond Good and Evil title.\n\nIn 2010 he appeared at a games conference in Montpellier and said: “It will take time. Please have patience. I’m sorry.”\n\nPerhaps we just need slightly more patience than we realised."
