        "text": "PAX Aus 2024 Indie Showcase Winners\n\nPAX Aus has announced the winners from this year’s Aus Indie Showcase, all made by independent creators around Australia. The showcase will be a part of PAX Aus 2024, from October 11-13.\n\nThe six winners of the Digital category:\n\nUntethered by True Anomaly Entertainment\n\nAnticitizen: Red by Queebly Software\n\nAscending Inferno by Oppolyon Studios\n\nRita by SporkTank\n\nThe Rewinder 2 by Misty Mountain Studio\n\nAnd last, but not least, Max Mustard, the VR game developed by Queensland studio Toast Interactive.\n\nThe six winners of the Tabletop category:\n\nFight with Spirit by Storybrewers Roleplaying\n\nOracle by Oracle Games\n\nGlade by Teafrog Games\n\nFrayed Ally by Button Fox\n\nNimbus by Neural Forge\n\nMEAN! by Mean Games\n\nThe Olympic Esports Games\n\nThe International Olympics Committee has announced a 12-year partnership with Saudi Arabia to host the Olympic Esports Games, a standalone event. Saudi Arabia had hosted the Esports World Cup, which did result in a number of people boycotting the event over human rights concerns.\n\nEsports has been ramping up over the last couple of decades, with schools and universities creating their own teams, competitive events gaining more and more popularity and viewership, and the introduction of esports events in the 2022 Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, where people from the Olympic Committee attended and were like ‘ok, now we get it’ according to Alban Dechelotte, CEO of G2 Esports.\n\nKeeping esports as a separate event is intended to ‘give more space for a celebration of gaming and esports’, rather than being one of the additional sports.\n\nRocket League, League of Legends, and Street Fighter are likely picks considering that they were a part of the Commonwealth and Asian Games.\n\nGotta’ Croc ‘Em All\n\nIf you are a wearer of Crocs, and a fan of Pokemon, listen up. We’re getting four new designs inspired by some generation one Pokemon: Charizard, with a flame-like marble print; Gengar, which is giving ghostly ‘glamoflage’; Snorlax, with a dreamy blue marble print; and finally Jigglypuff, all pink and pastel. Each pair of Crocs comes with some jibbitz, with the Pokemon the Croc is based off!\n\nNo Console Required\n\nAmazon now has a handy-dandy Xbox “No Console Required” bundle, launching alongside their Fire TV Stick Xbox Cloud Gaming app. What this means is that Xbox Game Pass users can stream games straight to their TV without requiring a console.\n\nMicrosoft has also released an ad that parodies the Scream movies, promoting the rollout with “you don’t need an Xbox to play Xbox”, although some Xbox fans do feel that the console itself has been deprioritised by Microsoft, while expanding Game Pass, and their reach across PCs, mobile phones, and now TVs.\n\nRemember that there have been a lot of changes made to Game Pass and the tiers available, as covered in the news last week by Paul. Only the Ultimate Tier will allow for Fire TV integration.\n\nNews Nibbles!\n\nAxis Studios, the animation and VFX team, is officially going into administration, affecting 162 employees. The studio has worked on a variety of trailers and cinematics for Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, and more.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, is the video game continuation of the film, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, which was released last year. A Heartful of Games, the team developing the game, will be keeping that stylised art-direction from the movie!\n\nIf you’ve been participating in the early access period for EA Sports College Football 25, you might have encountered a placeholder bug when trying to select your game mode. Players were given two options: a placeholder image titled ‘Lorem Ipsum’, and a placeholder image titled ‘Lorem Ipsum’. Oops.\n\nAnd now for some upcoming games!\n\nJuly 18th (that’s today!)\n\nFlintlock: Siege of Dawn – PS5, XSX, PC\n\nBo: Path of the Teal Lotus – Nintendo Switch, PS5, PC\n\nJuly 19th\n\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess – PS5, PS4, Xbox S/X, Xbox One, PC\n\nJuly 23rd\n\nExophobia – PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox S/X, Xbox One, PC\n\nF1 Manager 24 – PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox S/X, Xbox One, PC\n\nThe Star Named EOS – PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox S/X, Xbox One, PC, macOS\n\nJuly 25th\n\nArranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure – PS5, Nintendo Switch, PC, macOS\n\nFrostpunk 2 – PC\n\nCrazy Taxi Reboot\n\nAt the 2023 Game Awards Sega teased reboots for several of its classic titles like Jet Set Radio,\n\nStreets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi. A recruitment video for the Crazy Taxi reboot, features the\n\ncurrent team including Kenji Kanno, (the director of the original Crazy Taxi game) sharing details\n\nabout the project. They aim to preserve the gameplay of the original games, navigating a city at\n\nbreakneck speeds, but also to adapt it for the modern audience. So, what does the modern audience want?\n\nLarge-scale, open-world, massively multiplayer games of course. It’s a significant shift but might be what the team needs to make it the AAA hit they’re aiming for.\n\nThere is currently no release date for Crazy Taxi (or any of the other reboots) so we’re in for a wait.\n\nXbox partners with Amazon for console-less gaming\n\nMicrosoft has announced that later this month (July 2024) Xbox subscribers will be able to\n\naccess a wide range of games through their Fire TV Stick, without the need for an Xbox console.\n\nYou’ll need one of the newer Firesticks (4K or 4K max), a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, and\n\na Bluetooth controller, but that’s still likely to come in cheaper than a console.\n\nDon’t Nod Delays Game Release\n\nLife is Strange: Double Exposure, developed by Deck Nine, will be released in October 2024. It\n\ncenters around Max Caulfield, the protagonist from the first Life is Strange Game which was\n\ndeveloped by Don’t Nod.\n\nDon’t Nod, which is no longer involved in the Life is Strange series, is currently working on Lost\n\nRecords: Bloom & Rage. This game was set to be released in Q3 2024 but has been postponed\n\nuntil early 2025. A statement on Twitter revealed that this decision was made to avoid\n\ncompetition between the two games. “We know you’re all excited for both Lost Records and the\n\nnew Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait\n\nwill be worth it!”\n\nFrostpunk 2 Delayed\n\nThe release of Frostpunk 2 has been delayed from July 25th, until September 20th\n\nThis follows the game’s recent beta where several notable issues were highlighted. 11-bit\n\nstudios say they want time to fix those issues and add several additional features before\n\nrelease. We want to ensure Frostpunk 2 meets the high expectations of our fans and provides a\n\nseamless and engaging experience.” They also promised that until release they would provide\n\nbehind-the-scenes updates to show how things are progressing.\n\nUpcoming Game Releases:\n\nZenless Zone Zero will be released for PC, PS5, iOS, Android on July 4th.\n\nJuly 5th gives us Cyber Citizen Shockman Zero on PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One & Xbox Series X\n\nJuly 11th will see the release of Once Human and The Crush House, both on PC.\n\nFinally, Anger Foot will be released for PC on July 10t\n\nRemember Beyond Good and Evil 2?\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development! That’s it, that’s the news. Ubisoft have reassured us that they haven’t forgotten about it, and they’re still working on it, which is great because it was first announced in 2008, kinda disappeared, reappeared with a trailer in 2017, and then was kinda totally silent since 2018.\n\nThere’s been some concerns about its development since Emile Morel, creative director, passed away earlier this year, but Ubisoft has reassured that it is still in the works, and the 20th Anniversary Edition of Beyond Good and Evil, which was accidentally announced early on Twitter before the tweet was deleted, has launched digitally on the 25th of June.\n\nThe remaster is supposed to contain some more of Jade’s past, and other content to tie into the second game. There will be a physical copy, and a Collector’s Edition, with preorders for those kicking off 12th of July.\n\n$19 Billion Dollars!\n\nThat’s how much Steam users have collectively spent on games they’ve never played. So, congratulations everyone, I know each and every one of you helped to contribute to this remarkable achievement.\n\nThis is a bit of a guestimate, as only 10% of Steam accounts are public, but that 10% was responsible for at least $1.9 billion USD.\n\nGamer Rage\n\nWhat do you do if you have a dispute with another player in an online game? Most of us probably try to ignore it and move on. Maybe block ‘em. Maybe stooped to their level. You probably didn’t fly to a different state,buy a hammer and a flashlight, break into a home, and attack said player, in real life.\n\nWell, Edward Kang from New Jersey allegedly did just that, flying to Florida to confront a player that he had an argument with in ArcheAge, an online fantasy game. The two were found in a struggle by the player’s stepfather, who heard the player cry for help. Both the player and Edward were taken to a nearby hospital, with the player having severe head wounds, but both will be ok.\n\nEdward is facing charges of breaking and entering, and assault. When he asked how much time he might serve, Leeper, county sheriff, allegedly responded with “I would say, Mr Kang, it’s going to be a long time before you play video games again.”\n\nSo next time, just take a walk. Not to the hardware store.\n\nWar Thunder Apologises\n\nGaijin Entertainment, developers of the free-to-play multiplayer War Thunder, have officially apologised for ‘accidentally including imagery from the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster’ in some key art. The Challenger disaster was an event from 1986 where the space shuttle broke apart soon into its flight, killing all seven crew members.\n\nWar Thunder players noticed how an image of the disaster lined up with the artwork in the ‘Seek & Destroy’ wallpaper, with one person overlaying a photo from the disaster with the wallpaper.\n\n“Hey guys, please accept our apologies for this, the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost. We’ll change the key art on Monday and will make sure this doesn’t happen again,” said community manager Oxy.\n\nIn the past, the War Thunder community has managed to leak classified military documents onto the forums, often to win arguments or to make suggestions for the developers, so attention to detail is definitely a common trait.\n\nNews Nibbles!\n\nNintendo Switch Sports has had a few updates since it launched, adding golf, and soon, basketball! The motion control should allow players to pass, shoot, and dribble.\n\nSylvie Nightshade, a software engineer, made a Stardew Valley mod that adds a ‘hardcore’ mode to the game. What does that mean? Well, if you open the Stardew Valley Wiki, your farm will be deleted.\n\nRyan Lewis, a recent Cornell Tech graduate, created a program that converts the data from Google Maps into Minecraft worlds. The program first converts the data into voxels, and each voxel is turned into a Minecraft block, with the help of an algorithm, accurately recreating buildings, roads, terrain, and more.\n\nAnd now for some upcoming games!\n\nJune 27th\n\nLuigi’s Mansion 2 HD – Nintendo Switch\n\nNeo Sprint – PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox SX\n\nJune 28th\n\nGigantosaurus Dino Sports – PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox SX\n\nSPYxANYA: Operation Memories – PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PC\n\nJuly 2nd\n\nFinal Fantasy 14: Dawntrail – PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox SX\n\nThe First Descendant – PlayStation 5, Xbox SX, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC\n\nThat’s it this week in gaming news!\n\nhttps://wp-uploads.zedgamesau.net/2024/06/NEWS-733-240620.mp3\n\nNintendo Direct.\n\nI’m only going to run down the major headliners of the 40-minute June 18 Nintendo Direct, because if you’re into it you have either watched it or you’ve watched your favourite Youtuber’s summary. If you’re not, you probably don’t want a mega rundown. So here they are:\n\nMario lovers are getting Mario & Luigi: Brothership coming November 7, this year. It looks to be a dual-control platformer. As well as Super Mario Party Jamboree, a massive party game with the ability to host up to 20 players. Play it October 17.\n\nDonkey Kong Country Returns HD is coming Jan 16, 2025, with 80 levels plus some from the original 3DS hit.\n\nZelda fans were hit with a Nintendo Switch Online addition of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords (basically multiplayer Link). Then the new title The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was announced to much fanfare, where you play as Zelda and create echoes in your adventure to save Link. Coming September 26 this year.\n\nAnd finally, in Metroid news, also coming to Nintendo Switch Online Metroid Zero Mission is coming to the collection. And the long-anticipated, after the announcement of it back at E3 2017, Metroid Prime 4 will be gracing our consoles sometime in 2025.\n\nThere was a heap more, with the announcement and release dates of Just Dance 2025, Dragon Quest 3, some Marvel vs Capcom collections… lots of stuff.\n\nWant to learn more? Follow the links on our Facebook @zedgamesau\n\nGame Industry News\n\nThis week saw the closure of Game Industry’s 2022 and 2023 “Best Places to Work in Canada” studio Timbre Games by owner Sumo Group before the release of its first game. This is included in the 15% downsizing Sumo Group, a subsidiary of Chinese giant Tencent, had announced on June 11 (~250 people). Paradox Interactive is closing down their Tectonic Studio, makers of the upcoming life sim Life by You after Deputy CEO reportedly called the early access title “lacking in some key areas” and “the road leading to release… far too long and uncertain.” (24 people)\n\nAfter sales lagged on Wizard with a Gun, developer Galvanic Games has closed their doors (12 people). Embracer Group also blamed lacklustre sales for this week’s closing of Pieces Interactive, developer of Alone in the Dark released in March (42 people). VRChat has also announced a 30% reduction in staff (~30 people) blaming plateauing sales and a lack of management. And after the announcement in May of Microsoft’s closure of Tango Gameworks, the studio finally closed its doors this week.\n\nIn the wake of all the layoffs, the big name companies’ CEOs and shareholders in the industry continue to profit, with EA CEO’s compensation increased by 22% to over USD$25 million. And this after cutting 5% of its workforce in Feb (~670 people) for restructuring.\n\nAt least Gearbox has been somewhat released from Embracer Groups failing model with its deal with Take-Two Interactive closing this week. The deal moves most of the IP and studios under Take-Two’s wings. Including hits such as Borderlands, Risk of Rain, Homeworld, and Duke Nukem, but leaving behind the studios and IP of Lost Boys Interactive and Cryptic Studios.\n\nBut not all is lost, with staff from layoffs forming advisory companies – such as those from indie studio Modern Wolf forming Secret Sauce – or creating “support studios” like CodeDev: The Unreal Guys who work as a specialist team to help studios work with the Unreal engine.\n\nBut the industry is struggling. In an interview with Gamesindustry.biz Tencent advisor and former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden is cautioning the industry to take a more patient approach to game development.\n\n“It’s human nature, right?
