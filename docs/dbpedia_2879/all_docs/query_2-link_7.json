        "text": "When we first came up with IGN Insider, we took a long look at all of our existing IGN channels to find topics and areas we don't already cover; we searched for content that would be interesting to die-hard gamers and IGN fans alike. After thinking about issues that frustrate us, we discovered that there is one major trend that has emerged since the latest wave of gaming consoles sprang to life: developers frequently release their titles across multiple consoles. The editors at IGN try to do their best to write about each gaming system and objectively review all the major titles, but there is one thing we don't often do: compare games across platforms. Is Madden 2004 still worth a purchase on GameCube, or does the controller hinder the experience? Is Need for Speed: Underground just as thrilling on PlayStation 2 as it is on the often more robust GameCube and Xbox platforms? And where does the PC fit in?\n\nIf you're at a conflict every time a game debuts on multiple platforms, this feature is for you. The Head-to-Head series of articles cuts through all the different takes the editors have on games, compares the facts, and presents you with one uniform opinion on all the versions.\n\nAbout Our Head-to-Head Comparison\n\nThe following comparisons were drawn assuming the highest level of available equipment. To be completely fair, we examine all versions with the notion that everyone has HDTVs, surround sound setups, wireless controllers, etc.\n\nExample One: The PC version of a game features poor mouse and keyboard control, but supports controllers. We do not fault it for its substandard mouse and keyboard control.\n\nExample Two: The PlayStation 2 version of a game supports four-player, but it requires the use of a multitap. The functionality is still there. We do not fault it for it.\n\nExample Three: The GameCube and Xbox versions of a game support progressive scan, but the PS2 does not. The games all look graphically identical, barring the benefits of progressive scan. The result: an even tie between the GameCube and Xbox.\n\nWe highly recommend that you read the detailed reports for every area of comparison -- there are many facts that might sway your decision based on your setup.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil (GCN, PS2, Xbox, PC)\n\nFrom the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel, comes a beautifully directed, orchestrated, and executed action-adventure from Ubi Soft. Beyond Good & Evil sends players on an epic quest to save the world. It's a likely format for any videogame in the genre, but the beautifully implemented art, slick graphics engine, emotional soundtrack, and varied gameplay make for a must-play experience.\n\nPublisher Ubi Soft was also sure to release it across all four major platforms, which serves well to reach a larger audience, but for those of us that own more than one console and, perhaps, additionally a PC it can make choosing the right version to play difficult. That's where this Head-to-Head comparison comes in handy, complete with revealing side-by-side screenshots.\n\nNamely the graphics will effect your buying/renting decision here, but there are a few other things to consider for sure, like HDTV support and load times.\n\nSo without further delay, let's get to comparing.\n\nFeatures\n\nUbi Soft has made our lives and, more importantly, your lives easier. Beyond Good & Evil is the same game on all four platforms. The project, which was directed by Michel Ancel, has been in the making for many years, but it seems that the team focused more on nailing their original vision than implementing things like online play or GBA link-up; or maybe, none of these extras would have made much sense for the project.\n\nWhatever the case, if you want to play BG&E you don't have to worry about being gypped out of one option or another.\n\nWinner Ranking:\n\n1. GameCube/PlayStation 2/Xbox/PC (Tie)\n\nControl\n\nIf the games industry has learned one thing from the Superman comics, it's that bizarro world does exist. The PC is the bizarro console...or is it the other way around? Point is, where first-person shooters play brilliantly on the PC, adventure games have a habit of running into trouble -- when they don't support controllers, for example.\n\nYes, you heard right. Somehow, for some reason, the PC version does not support controllers. You have to assign everything to the keyboard and mouse. You can get by, but it's entirely awkward to play this kind of game this way. There's certainly no confusing that the PC version is a port of the consoles in this case.\n\nFollowing, we list all of the primary functions, but bear in mind the buttons do several different things. Still, this should give you an idea of how things control (and how our mouse/keyboard was setup by default).\n\nLoad PointGameCubePlayStation 2XboxPCCrouchLL1LCTRLMoveL. StickL. StickL. StickW-A-S-DCamera/ZoomR. Stick R. StickR. StickMouse/Up-DownPhoto/AimZR1YShiftRun/AccelerateRR2RSpaceAction/AttackAXAL. ClickDive/Roll/ReleaseBSquareXR. ClickAsk/In-HovercraftYTrianbleBEUseXCircleBlackQInventory PagingD-padD-padD-pad2/3Menu ScreenStartStartStartESCObjectives/MapsN/ASelectBackTAB\n\nThe only red-flagged portion of the table applies to GameCube. Why? Because it's a button short. When you get a new objective, map, or anything of the sort you can quickly navigate in a one-touch manner on PS2, Xbox, and PC. But with GameCube you need to press Start then select Objectives & Maps. Think you handle it? Because the stuff accessed in this menu is not something you will live or die on for the seconds saved, it's almost irrelevant.\n\nHowever, GameCube doesn't have a center-camera luxury, which the PS2 and Xbox activate with the Right Analog Stick button. Again, it's something you'll use rarely, but it is missing nonetheless.\n\nIn short, GameCube, PS2, and Xbox are all quite suitable over the PC. But, consider that GameCube is missing some very minor peripheral functionality.\n\nWinner Ranking:\n\n1. PS2/Xbox\n\n2. GCN\n\n3. PC\n\nDifference between 1 and 2: minor\n\nDifference between 2 and 3: major\n\nSound\n\nThe score that Christophe Heral composed for Beyond Good & Evil is powerful and moving, supported by a strong theme that chains the experience together like a backbone. It is a mix of orchestrated and on-cue audio that blends together for a truly ear-pleasing experience. Combined with the effects and voiceovers, it is one of the best-sounding of 2003. That said, you'll want to give the audio experience serious consideration.\n\nFor quality, the Xbox and PC are the best. They have clearer samples of both the music and the effects. You can't go wrong either way. Versus GameCube and PlayStation 2, the audio offers less clarity, but it's hardly \"bad\" in any way. GameCube is the better of the two, as even with an optical output the PS2 can sound slightly more compressed.\n\nThen there is surround sound to think about. It follows the same trend as quality. Xbox supports Dolby Digital across all five major surround channels. It's not the most discrete Dolby Digital out there, but the surround environment is fuller and clearer than the other consoles. The PC, if you've got the hardware to support EAX, sounds pretty clear and similar to Xbox.\n\nAs for surround between GameCube and PS2, the GameCube supports Dolby Pro Logic II while the PlayStation 2 does not. The PS2 stereo signal that is available still sounds okay if you filter it through a DPLII-enabled receiver.\n\nWinner Ranking:\n\n1. Xbox/PC (Tie)\n\n2. GameCube\n\n3. PlayStation 2\n\nDifference between 1 and 2: medium\n\nDifference between 2 and 3: minor\n\nGraphics\n\nBG&E runs on the incredible \"Jade\" engine, which Ubi Soft developed for many years as its primary \"next-generation\" technology. Combined with the unique art vision, it is certainly one of the prettiest games this year. The lighting engine, which casts a lovely real-time day/night cycle across the land, is robust on all the platforms. Likewise, the worlds are huge with lots of polygon and texture detail. Between all of the consoles and PC, the results vary.\n\nOur PC Rig\n\nDual 3.0 GHz Pentium 4\n\n1GB RAM\n\nGeForce FX 5900 w/128MB RAM\n\nHere's a look at the lighting in one of the opening cut-scenes. Other than clarity differences, it's undeniable that they all look great. The PS2's effects here aren't quite as brilliant, but backgrounds are still crisp and vivid. Meanwhile, Xbox might look more \"smudged\" but this is actually thanks to the heavier anti-alising methods, which give the title a nice, soft look. GameCube sits in between PS2 and Xbox, offering a slightly sharper display with some edge-smoothing.\n\nThe PC, with the download of a patch, supports anti-aliasing. But when applied the framerate suffers. Frankly, it doesn't help to improve the look of the game that much because it forces you to run the adventure at a lower resolution, which increases the edging problems.\n\nBut all of them suffer from framerate issues in one way or another. It's really a matter of degrees; like a thermometer, the framerate plunges when faced with the bitter cold of particle effects and transparencies. In that same vein, the performance of the platforms vary.\n\nMost notably, the PS2 is undeniably the most unpredictable and slowest overall. In small environments it runs pretty well, but particle effects or heavy transparencies can slow it down. It actually attempts to run above 30, but ends up averaging around there and falling below it often, especially in the larger environments where it is actually a bit of an annoyance. Texture-wise, too, as you can see in the above shot it doesn't have the depth of the others. The filtering isn't as flattering, either.\n\nXbox meanwhile, is pretty stable and averages around 30 frames per second, but it too reaches towards 60, sometimes maintaining a stable framerate at these higher peaks, too. It has the best framerate of the consoles on the whole. Its particle effects and lighting are also nicely implemented. As an advantage to both GameCube and PS2, the Xbox version's heavier anti-aliasing frees you the flickery, harsher look you'd find otherwise.\n\nGameCube actually looks excellent, though. It has more strongly contrasted colors, which draws the bright colors out even more. It also pushes towards 60 frames per second more often than PS2 and Xbox. The problem is that it simply cannot hold it, which makes the framerate choppier than the Xbox. Texture-wise it's about on par with Xbox, though.\n\nThere are two major environment contrasts in BG&E. The watery landscapes that buffer cities and hills offers up a far different look, especially when lighting plays with the reflected sky colors, deepening, lengthening, or shortening the shadows of the wavy waterscape.\n\nThe simple fact is, the Jade engine's water effects are some of the best this generation -- that goes for consoles and PC. On all four platforms you get excellent results. But the framerate plays with the effectiveness of those reflections. On Xbox everything is very smooth and seldom catches your eye with a hitch. On GameCube, it's got a slight stutter that you can see. PS2, meanwhile, just can't hold the framerate in these outdoor environments, which is really too bad.\n\nThe PC, if you've got powerful hardware, holds up okay, but it has its share of framerate trouble every so often, so it's not perfect even if you have the latest graphics card.\n\nOverall, however, the PC does look the best thanks to the ability to run at a resolution of about 1024x768 without too much slowdown. The texture quality is better and the aliasing is natively lessened at such a resolution. But, it's hardly a powerful PC engine; it's easy to tell it was ported from the consoles, which explains its performance cap.\n\nFor the consoles, the Xbox is the best bet. It has [480] progressive scan support, the most consistent framerate, and solid filtering for textures and edges. GameCube, like with Prince of Persia, has a more vivid, bright look. It also hits higher framerates more often, but it is far too inconsistent to make it valuable. It's a runner-up to Xbox, and not too far behind. It has no progressive support. The PlayStation 2 has a really sharp, crisp display, but the lighter load on texture quality and much worse framerate makes it the most visually inferior. Over GameCube, however, it does support progressive scan, a rare treat for PS2 owners.\n\nBG&E was created letterboxed, black bars capping top and bottom, and it seems true widescreen was impossible, as none of the four support it. Speculatively, implementing it would have heavily taxed the framerate, due to the increased screen-rendering area. If you have an HDTV that does special 16:9 stretch modes, you can play it that way and it doesn't look too distorted.\n\nWinner Ranking:\n\n1. PC\n\n2. Xbox\n\n3. GameCube\n\n4. PlayStation 2\n\nDifference between 1 and 2: medium\n\nDifference between 2 and 3: minor\n\nDifference between 3 and 4: medium\n\nPresentation\n\nUbi Soft didn't utilize Game Boy Advance functionality on GameCube, use Xbox Live for downloads or online awareness, or the PS2 or PC for any extra functionality either. Like the gameplay, the little \"extras\" are all the same.\n\nLoad PointGameCubePlayStation 2XboxPCBoot-up22 sec.30 sec.15 sec.15 sec.Into Hanger7 sec.7 sec. 3.5 sec.2-3 sec.\n\nAs you'll see, we didn't gauge too many load times, because they are usually five seconds or less on all of the platforms. GameCube and Xbox can take slightly longer. If you're counting, PC is the fastest, Xbox just after that, then GCN and PS2 are pretty similar.\n\nSo, for load times the PC should win presentation. But. And there is a but. There's one thing we can say about presentation that is pretty clear: the PC wasn't really factored into the equation. For what is largely a console-oriented adventure, it's painfully clear that the PC was an afterthought, as it lacks controller support, has no in-game options for video/audio (you have to do it before booting it up), and doesn't look as good as it could have.\n\nSo, while the PC might excel in things like load times, it certainly wasn't presented to gamers as it should have been. It won't kill the gameplay, but for this particular category we have to dock it.\n\nWinner Ranking:\n\n1. Xbox\n\n2. GameCube/PlayStation 2 (Tie)\n\n3. PC\n\nDifference between 1 and 2: minor\n\nDifference between 2 and 3: minor\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nMichel Ancel's gorgeous adventure is not to be missed. If you're going to check it out, do so on Xbox first. It controls perfectly, supports progressive scan, sounds great with Dolby Digital support, and has the most consistent framerate of the consoles. PC would have otherwise been the best choice, but without controller support it's rather awkward for this type of gameplay. For that reason, we really don't recommend the PC version at all unless they release a patch that fixes the issue.\n\nAfter Xbox, GameCube is a really solid choice. It controls fine (even with a missing button), looks fantastic, supports Dolby Pro Logic II, and it's only big downfall (in addition to the jumpy framerate) is the lack of progressive scan support, which Ubi Soft really shouldn't have had a problem implementing. PlayStation 2 is still a good choice over PC, and if you don't have the other console/platform you'd like to own it own, it's still nothing to complain over -- it's still a very pretty game that performs well on all the consoles.\n\nOverall Winner: Xbox\n\nWinner Ranking:\n\n1.
