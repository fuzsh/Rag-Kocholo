        "text": "Earlier this year I made a thread about Nintendo DS games and asked in a poll about which console should be the next for a thread. In the second place was PSP, which I made a thread in August. But the winner was the GameCube (and the 3rd place was \"no more of these threads, please\"). So now, it's GameCube time.\n\nGameCube Essentials\n\n\"Regarding concerns about the correlation between violence and video games, a 2009 study by Iowa State University found that certain games like Super Mario Sunshine and Chibi-Robo!, which were GameCube exclusives, would help players learn positive skills about helping others, empathy, and cooperation, as well as the game Super Monkey Ball, which was a GameCube exclusive, could help surgeons perform laparoscopic surgery better than surgeons who don't play video games.\" Wikipedia\n\nThis time we will do a \"Nintendo GameCube Essentials\" thread. So how will it work? Pretty simple: You will choose 15 games that you think that are must plays, essential games that everyone who has interest in playing GameCube games should play. No restrictions.\n\nVoting:\n\nThe voting time is over. Here's the original text:\n\nYou can write anything about the games but if you don't want to, that's ok, it's all up to you.\n\nAfter that 15 games (or less), you can also vote in 2 games that we will call Hidden Gems (HG). So what's a Hidden Gem? In my opinion, that great game that isn't (or wasn't) popular enough or that great game that almost no one played or heard about... Maybe that untranslated game that you had played and you think that's great. Something like that. But what is a Hidden Gem to you? It's up to you to decide what it is. I won't moderate that category but please, don't abuse it by voting in games like \"Smash Bros\" or \"Animal Crossing\" since these are popular games and aren't exactly \"hidden\" games. ​\n\nHere's how to vote:\n\nThe Results:\n\nHere I'll explain how I'll list the results. There's no action from the voters here.\n\nI will divide the games by categories and then list the TOP 10 of each category with comments about the game or small reviews from different sites/magazines (of course, if the category has 10 different games with more than 2 votes). Also, it will be post the 30 games that received more votes. The categories are \"Published by Nintendo, Action games, Fighting games, Racing/Sports, Puzzles/ Board Games/ Strategy/ Adventures/Simulation, Other and Hidden Gems\". The results are listed below.\n\nCategory #1: Published by Nintendo:\n\nThe 10 most voted games published by Nintendo in its first release(JP, US, EU). So a japanese game published by Nintendo of Japan, a NA game published by Nintendo of America and a European game published by Nintendo of Europe. To keep it simple, let's say that a japanese Namco game was published by Namco in Japan but Nintendo published it in EU and NA. This game won't be here because the original publisher is Namco (in Japan). This will give room to more diverse games to appear in the other categories. So, the top 10 Nintendo games will be automatically in this category to give some room to more diverse games to appear in the other categories. The other Nintendo games will be allocated in other genres (having enough votes, of course). The games listed here won't be appearing in the other categories, so Pikmin won't be appearing again in the Puzzle category, for example...​\n\n10. Pikmin\n\nNintendo, 2001, Puzzle/ Real Time Strategy, 1 Player.\n\nAesthetically Pikmin can appear intimidating and even complicated. Many would be quick to assume it a simple real-time strategy game, but in truth it is a blend of strategy, puzzle, and adventure. The concept is actually quite simple. The main character Captain Olimar crash-lands on a foreign planet, which sends 30 different pieces of his ship scattering to different areas of the mysterious world. This is all explained and highlighted in the opening cut-scene. You take control of Olimar as soon as he picks his dazed body up from the ground next to his smoldering ship. As you attempt to explore you'll noticed your perspective is extremely limited. You can see the ground right in front of you as well as some oversized plant life. This is intentional and does a great job of making players feel both very small and lost. Eventually you will stumble over an odd looking nest that, when approached, will spring up from the ground and set up.\n\nPlucking it from the ground reveals a curious red ant-like creature called a Pikmin. It immediately follows you like a child and responds to your glowing antenna that can be used to whistle and call the creature forth.\n\nAs you and the new creature search the perimeter you find the little fellow is attracted to the large, towering flowers and will chop them down like trees. In the center of the flowers is a pollen-like tablet, which the Pikmin brings back to the nest. Upon transporting the tablet into the nest, more Pikmin seedlings of the same color are produced. These tablets are scattered all over the world in all kinds of sizes, each labeled with a number that indicates how many Pikmin are required to carry it. At this point it's clear that with the help of more Pikmin, Captain Olimar could successfully find the 30 scattered parts of his ship, repair it and return home. On the way you're going to run into a lot of obstacles and the Pikmin will be your only hope.\n\nInterestingly, Olimar only has a window of 30 days before he has to return to his home planet, so he's on a tight schedule to find and return the ship's missing parts. That said, it becomes extremely important to take care of your Pikmin because of the tight 30 day schedule. Unfortunately, in game time each day is only about 15-20 minutes long depending on cut-scenes and pauses. So in the main adventure only amounts to about 10-12 hours of gameplay.\n\nEver worse the last two of the five environments are absolutely spectacular, packed with puzzles, and we need not spoil the awesome last boss for you. Why is that a bad thing? Simply because you don't want it to end. Pikmin is such a fresh, new kind of experience and you are rushed through it. It has that classic Nintendo feel, especially for some of the more clever puzzles and 10-12 hours just won't be enough for hardcore gamers.\n\nEqually great is the gameplay style which blends exploration, puzzle solving, and intelligent boss fights. It's one of those titles where you can't help but push forward and explore. Still, I think it's a must have for GameCube owners looking for this kind of adventure/puzzle experience. There's no multiplayer, which hurts, but its definitely one of the better single-player games on the system.\n\nFull Review (IGN)​\n\n9. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\n\nNintendo, 2006, Action, 1 Player\n\nWe could easily write a 10-page review of Twilight Princess, exploring every nook and cranny, detailing every character, every boss, and every last temple, but we don't want to spoil the adventure that awaits you. We realize that the last thing our viewers want with this review is to stumble upon major spoilers, so we've done our best to keep significant story developments and weapon and item upgrades from our critique.\n\nSome gamers have resisted the Wii version of Twilight Princess because they feel that the new control scheme is unnecessary. The GameCube build of the title provides a more conventional alternative that feels very familiar to anybody who has played a Zelda entry before and incidentally as polished as ever. There are even a couple advantages to playing with a traditional controller over the Wii remote. For one, players who enjoyed titles like Wind Waker will understand immediately how to maneuver Link like a pro in Twilight Princess because the same fundamental controls still apply.\n\nTwilight Princess is a gargantuan adventure filled with a dazzling variety of places to see, people and creatures to meet and things to do. The scope of the game is epic and you can play it however you please. For the purposes of this review, we tore through the main adventure and oftentimes overlooked the meaty selection of side quests. We later came back to them and were amazed by their depth.\n\nWhile the game has just about everything going for it, including improved controls, a long and engrossing quest, brain-teasing dungeons and some beautiful graphics, it's not perfect. The difficulty has been upped over Wind Waker, but I wish it were harder still – the boss fights are oftentimes too easy, for example.\n\nEverything said and done, this is still a major achievement for Nintendo and it arrives as GameCube's swan song – an epic farewell to what has been a great console.\n\nFull Review (IGN)​\n\n8. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\n\nRetro Studios, 2004, Action, 1-4 Players.\n\nPrime was, in essence, an unexpected and unadulterated success. In the last two years, Retro has perfected and evolved the form of its previous game to bring us Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, a sequel that takes the established framework and builds on it with diverse new locales, innovative abilities, and inventive gameplay. Despite the addition of a middling and somewhat unnecessary multiplayer component, Echoes stands shoulder to shoulder with its predecessor, delivering absolutely everything you'd want from a new 3D Metroid adventure. The game begins simply enough, placing you once again in the hefty cybernetic boots of noble interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran. Following a simple Galactic Federation directive to investigate a missing squad of troops, Samus tracks a signal to the remote planet Aether and descends to the surface to find the missing detachment. From here things become anything but simple. Within minutes, you'll find yourself being drawn into a bizarre civil war between the luminoth, a benevolent, mothlike race that inhabits Aether, and the ing, a vile host of dark creatures who reside in an alternate-reality version of the planet referred to as Dark Aether.\n\nRetro has done an outstanding job of bringing Aether's opposing halves to life. The light side is full of organically designed, varied environments ranging from arid wastelands to rain-soaked marshes to a stunning futuristic fortress located high up in the mountains. Dark Aether, on the other hand, is a hellish, twisted mirror image of the light world, with a generally identical layout and much of the same actual topography. Echoes looks better than Metroid Prime, but you might have to compare them side by side before that's apparent. The differences are subtle and perhaps made even less obvious by the fact that several elements of the two games' presentations--everything from the HUD to the pop-up info windows and many of the accompanying sound effects--are basically identical. But the environments and even Samus herself are more-detailed this time around, boasting greater geometric detail, more-dynamic designs, and impressive new lighting and other special effects.\n\nIf you finished Metroid Prime and were left wanting more, Echoes gives it to you in spades. As an adventure game with heavy action elements and an emphasis on complex puzzle-solving, Metroid Prime 2 is about as good as it gets, on the GameCube or on any platform.​\n\nFull Review (GameSpot)\n\n7. F-Zero GX\n\nAmusement Vision (Sega), 2003, Racing, 1-4 Players\n\nF-Zero GX is the latest installment in the classic franchise and not only does it surpass its ancestors in just about every way possible, it is easily the new showcase title for the GameCube system, finally unleashing all of the power and potential Nintendo promised when the console was original released. Not only is F-Zero GX one of the best looking games ever released on the Cube it is without a doubt the most challenging.\n\nF-Zero GX isn't a game to be taken lightly. First timers and novice racers will quickly find themselves overwhelmed and season veterans of the franchise are in for a surprisingly steep learning curve. The racers are faster and the tracks more fiendishly clever than ever before. There is so much eye candy assaulting your optical senses that you might just go blind trying to play this game. You'll only begin to appreciate the complexity of the level designs when you sit back and watch someone else play the game.\n\nThe selection of tracks is mind numbing, both in complexity and design quality. You'll be racing inside tubes fighting centrifugal force or flying high off of towering jumps or holding your breath as you squeak down narrow sections of track without any side rails. There are tracks with multiple paths, shortcuts, and loads of turbo power-ups and strategically placed pit areas. This could very well be one of the most comprehensive racing package available today. With 30 pilots, 20 tracks, 15 cup races and a 9-chapter story mode you will be playing this game well into 2004.\n\nAmusement Vision has created what may well be the perfect GameCube title. With its amazingly complex racing model even experienced gamers are in for a substantial learning curve and newcomers to the series will be in for quite a shock. Visually stunning and a total blast to play, F-Zero GX is a racing game that no GameCube owner should be without.​\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n6. Super Mario Sunshine\n\nNintendo, 2002, Action, 1P.\n\nWhen a new Mario game hits the market, there's an underlying expectation that it'll revolutionize gaming as we know it. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Nintendo developed the long awaited GameCube follow-up under the philosophy \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Super Mario Sunshine truly is 64-bit at heart. Just the look of the game should evoke a flashback of memories. Ironically, age is on Mario's side. Rather than experimenting with jet set technologies, Nintendo took the knowledge and experience from the previous game and used it to fashion the perfect sequel.\n\nSuper Mario Sunshine doesn't spur a game revolution, but it can be argued that it is the best Mario game to date. The gameplay mechanics are stripped from the 64-bit adventure, and the visual dynamics haven't evolved too terribly much, but the variety that has been included far exceeds anything that I ever expected to see, or wanted from a Mario game. I know this may be hard to believe, but there really is never a dull moment of play. Even if you're just messing around, it's always exciting and fast-paced.\n\nThe biggest difference between Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario 64 is the water cannon that Mario wears on his back. In addition to his arsenal of acrobatic moves, Mario can now shoot out streams of water, or transform the cannon nozzle into a hover device for brief segments of flying. As a whole, the gameplay really couldn't be much more complex. As is the case with every Mario game, the control schematic fits like a glove. It's perfect. If you see a ledge several stories up, there's a good chance that you'll be able to create a jumping combo to reach it. I had my doubts at first, but Super Mario Sunshine is the most addictive and beguiling entry thus far. Once you start playing, putting it down may be the hardest thing that you ever do.​\n\nFull Review (Game Informer)\n\n5. Mario Kart: Double Dash!!\n\nNintendo, 2003, Racing, 1-4 Players (offline).\n\nMK:DD!! closely follows Mario Kart 64's mold, but manages to improve on the formula in some respects. There's all manner of new ideas, features, techniques, and multiplayer stuff under the hood, and mostly these are a welcomed sight. MK:DD!! shines brighter than any other kart racing game thanks to the genius addition of the co-op two-player system. Essentially, you and friend will be able to play through the single-player game; one driving and one gunning as you go. Both players must hit the Z button at the same time if they wish to trade jobs; the gunner now gets a new side-dash move to take out the other karts with, and the drift mini-turbo move requires both players to perform certain actions in a smooth sequence to execute it properly. And, finally, the namesake move -- the \"double dash\" -- is achieved when both players hit a rocket start together at the same time. What then unfolds is two gamers working furiously hard as a team to mold the mechanics of the gameplay into a beast that can function as well as an experienced lone karter would play. I personally think this is the best feature of MK:DD!!, and while it takes a little time to adjust to the controls, once mastered, MK:DD!! is more fun than I ever thought possible.\n\nMario Kart: Double Dash!! is a great game. It delivers fun and challenging gameplay in both single-player and multiplayer modes, although the real test of time will show that multiplayer -- and, in particular, the co-op mode -- racing is the way forward. Once you've beaten the single-player game inside out, there's little incentive to go back and replay those harder tracks. MK:DD!! is a great- looking, great-playing game that most gamers will instantly warm to. We've all seen this kind of gameplay before, but the new additions make it worth checking out for sure. It's not the most original game this year, but it's one of the best you'll play on GameCube, and that's a fact.​\n\nFull Review (Gamespy)\n\n4. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\n\nIntelligent Systems, 2004, RPG, 1 Player.\n\nThe adventure begins conventionally enough: Princess Peach has gone missing again, and it's up to Mario to find her. She was last seen in Rogueport, a seedy and mysterious coastal town far from the familiar reaches of the Mushroom Kingdom, and this place serves as the game's central location. Soon enough, the quest develops a clear episodic structure involving the search for seven crystal stars, each one a powerful artifact. The stars are all tucked away in different parts of the world. So, in turn, the process of finding each one is like a unique and self-contained storyline in which Mario will meet some colorful new friends and foes and solve various puzzles using his ever-growing number of special abilities. That means Paper Mario is structured much like classic Mario games, in which each main level has a distinctively different tone and style to it.\n\nThe game has a terrific sense of humor, thanks partly to a first-rate English translation. Much of the absurd humor comes from how Mario is one of the only human characters in the game, and yet his constantly bright-eyed, cheerful, but nearly silent demeanor makes him the most enigmatic character of them all. Also, Mario's brother Luigi makes an excellent appearance. In each chapter, he'll fill you in on the latest of his own eerily familiar-sounding misadventures. The game's sense of humor has truly broad appeal--younger audiences will love the funny-looking, over-the-top characters, while older players will appreciate some of the subtler wordplay and absurdity.\n\nPaper Mario really isn't directly comparable to too many other games, though it's basically designed like other console RPGs. Gameplay is spent exploring various environments, encountering and battling foes in a turn-based combat system, and gaining experience levels and new skills. Exploration occasionally involves Mario-style conventions of having to jump from platform to platform, find hidden switches or passageways, or navigate around certain hazards. These action-type sequences are handled well in the context of the game, and--much like the action-oriented aspects of the combat system--they help make the experience of playing the game engaging (not to mention similar to classic Mario titles), rather than too slow and passive as in some other RPGs.\n\nPaper Mario has some real depth to it, which makes it a great-playing game and not just a great story with some battles thrown in to slow you down. If you've enjoyed any of Mario's past appearances, you really ought to give Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door a try. For that matter, you should try it even if you haven't. The game is clearly a labor of love, but it's a lot more than that--this is the product of some incredible talent in game design. It's difficult to imagine how someone could not be quickly pulled into Paper Mario's whimsical world if they give the game so much as half a chance to do its thing.​\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)\n\n3. Super Smash Bros.: Melee\n\nHal Laboratory, 2002, Fighting, 1-4 Players.\n\nAs the Melee part of the title suggests, Super Smash Bros. Melee is one of those games which really has to be played with others. It's a multiplayer fighter, but much more than a simple beat 'em up, or even just an update to its predecessor on the N64. SSBM is a dramatic reworking of the formula which now offers more of everything, providing a much more varied and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game is a contest of might between two to four players, some of whom can be computer-controlled, and the objective is simply to batter your opponent and then knock him off the edge of the arena while he's vulnerable. At the end of the round your various feats are totted up and the match is decided on points, with funky scoring categories to muse over before moving on. And that really is it. The joy of SSBM though is in the sheer variety of things you can get up to and the strategic elements of the game, not to mention all the minutiae and nuances you can feasibly imagine lurking just beneath the surface, and of course a boatload of memorable Nintendo characters to fight with.\n\nVariations on the simple multiplayer game help to extend SSBM's lifespan, although I had actually been playing the game with a few friends for hours before we even tried them - it's addictive in no small way, so make sure you don't overlook anything!\n\nAs you can probably tell, this is one of the deepest and most vibrant examples of a beat 'em up for many years, highly deserving of its countless awards and sterling sales record. You can be as good or as bad at it as you can be bothered to be, and you'll still be able to play competitively with newcomers or cope with seasoned opponents. I've also yet to meet somebody who doesn't like it…\n\nOverall it's an exotic cocktail of entertainment for Nintendo fans, who will slurp up every last drop, and if you want to talk about longevity, I've had this game on import for about six months and I still haven't finished it. People talk about killer apps and games that sell systems, and if you can put aside any preconceptions of this as a kiddie title or a game for beat 'em up virgins only, then you will have one of the finest videogames ever to issue forth from the caring hands of a developer. One to be remembered, and definitely one to own.​\n\nFull Review (Eurogamer)\n\n2. The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\n\nNintendo, 2002 (Japan), Action-Adventure, 1 Player.\n\nWind Waker's story, like so many Nintendo games, let alone Zelda titles, initially revolves around rescuing the damsel in distress. But, as players advance, there will be delightfully unexpected twists and turns that separate this adventure from the norm. It's hard not to fall in love with the designs here, the logic hidden behind each obstacle, or the satisfaction gained after having figured the puzzle out. It all comes together triumphantly.\n\nThere's so much to do and see, so many unique locales, so many secrets, that it's impossible to do anything but cherish every hour in Link's larger-than-life world.\n\nThe cartoony presentation shocked gamers when Nintendo unveiled it for the first time and sure enough some long-time Zelda fanatics even swore off the franchise because of it. The sad truth is that the mainstream audience may, with no understanding of the technology required to realize the style, shrug Wind Waker's visuals off as primitive. However, players with keen eyes and an appreciation for the art of making games will know that Nintendo has not only created a hugely stylistic world down to every last detail, but also pushed the power of GameCube to do so.\n\nWind Waker is a masterful achievement -- a shining example, in fact, of how videogames should be made and a case study for developers wondering what makes a compelling game. Nintendo has once again evolved the action-adventure and created a gargantuan world that seems to overflow with mystery and challenge, an epic undertaking that streams across a wide-open sea and through countless islands, into several dungeons, and more. It's all knitted together with a storyline, but it's Zelda's unrivaled design, balanced and varied, and its polished play mechanics and control that ultimately set the game apart from just about every other competitor on the market.\n\nSimply put, this is one of the best games in the last few years and one of the most compelling reasons to pick up a GameCube immediately if you don't already own one.​\n\nFull review (IGN)\n\n1. Metroid Prime​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nRetro Studios, 2002, Action, 1 Player.\n\nMetroid Prime is an action-packed adventure set in the first-person perspective that takes place just after the events in the original Metroid (NES). It has lead character Samus Aran, a bounty hunter by trade, chasing down the evil Space Pirates. Their intention is to use a genetic mutagen called Phazon to create a super army and take over the universe. While the installments in the series before have never been home to deeply involving storylines, Metroid Prime breaks the shell to offer up one of the most intriguing and read-worthy sagas yet.\n\nAs the player, it's easy to become absorbed in the grim tale, and furthermore because you save all data to your log book, it becomes a practical novel of research data available at any time. Complex puzzles play hugely into this design. Around every corner Metroid Prime demands that the player figure out something. Occasionally it's simple and at other times it requires drawing on everything you've learned to that point, but it is always gratifying. This system of awarding you for even the smallest of your efforts makes it extremely difficult to travel to the nearest save station and take a break. There is always something tugging at the back of your mind, begging you to try out your newest skill and solve what may have previously seemed like an impossible puzzle.\n\nExploration composes the bulk of the quest, and enemies are merely there to inject the game with a healthy dose of action. In fact, fighting enemies can often be a puzzle itself. There are a lot of cleverly designed creatures that require scanning them to find weakpoints, and making use of that information is very important.\n\nEverything about Metroid Prime is absolutely amazing.The only reason one would avoid it is if action/adventures are not part of your narrower taste in games. If you fall into that category, you have no idea what you're missing out on. Metroid Prime is an instant classic that you will use to measure forthcoming software by.​\n\nFull review (IGN)\n\nAction/Action-Adventure:\n\nThis category includes action games and the combination of the action and adventure. So platformers, stealth games, 3rd and 1st person shooters, survival horror games will appear here. Metroid games won't be appearing here because my intetion is list one game once. So, f it appeared before, won't be appearing again...​\n\n10. Prince of Persia\n\nUbisoft, Ubisoft, 2003, 1 Player.\n\nQuite simply, right from the start, almost everything about it feels right. The tone of the Prince's voice, the way he moves around the game's palatial labyrinth, the way he reacts to common gameplay scenarios (grasping a ledge at an angle, shimmying round corners, moving a box in any direction just by holding one side and using the analogue stick rather than having to run round it every time to push, etc), the way the combat fits in with the rest of the game, the way the puzzles are introduced, considered and solved, the placement of save points and foreshadowing of key game events through occasional 'visions' (it does work, trust me), and especially the Sands of Time angle, of which more shortly.\n\nPut it to any platform fan - heck, any gamer full stop - and they will agree that there are times in life when, as pause menus, restart options and reset buttons underscore the frustration of instant or unavoidable death, the most desirable thing in the world is an option to rewind the last few seconds and press a different button. Well, having looted a precious and mysterious dagger from the cavernous and well-defended underbelly of the Maharajah's palace, our princely protagonist quickly discovers he can do just that. As long as he has enough 'sands of time' stored up in his sand meter.\n\nAnd to call the rest of the game anything other than a masterpiece would be ridiculous. It doesn't just do everything in the third-person genre right, it builds on the template and binds key new ideas to the Sands of Time premise masterfully - so much so in fact that it's going to be difficult for developers working on similar games to justify not borrowing everything that makes the game good. See, it's easy to categorise POP as a simple platform adventure with puzzles and swordfights, but if you do that then you have to acknowledge that it's a deceptively simple game that rarely bores you and throws up countless different scenarios, changing pace and challenging you to do different things without falling into too much of a routine. That's why you keep playing. One minute you're jumping around a bit like Lara Croft, swinging between bars like a circus act-cum-monkey and climbing along crumbling walls, the next you're trying to organise a series of mirrors to channel light in a particular direction, or timing a wall-running jump to dodge spinning mechanisms of death - or having to juggle all three. To rehash what I said in the first place, it's inventive yet intuitive, logically designed and consistently rewarding without ever feeling contrived.\n\nThe Sands of Time is a towering achievement in far more areas than any other similar title. You've probably done a lot of the things you'll do in Prince of Persia before, but never to this standard, and apart from the innovations, the consistency, the logic and the spell-binding presentation, what makes it so special is just how well made it is.​\n\n10. Sonic Adventure 2: Battle\n\nSega, Sega, 2001, 2 Players\n\nUnlike recent GameCube ports that suffer from control schemes that don't adapt well to the GC's unique controller (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 comes to mind), SA2B works remarkably well with Nintendo's shapely pad. This port also benefits from faster loading times than its DC predecessor. Overall, it's a dead-on conversion that suffers nothing from the move. In fact, enhanced Chao-raising mini-games and a bevy of new multi-player options make it superior.\n\nCoddling the Tamagotchi-like Chaos (the included side-game) provided a neat diversion in the DC game, but the expanded options in this new version add to the fun. The little guys can now compete in two events: Chao Racing and Chao Karate. Racing requires high speed and endurance, while karate demands brute strength. Affect these statistics by giving them Chaos Drives, differently colored energy sources scattered throughout the levels. You can also alter their abilities and appearance by mixing them with animals. These cute mini-games provide an excellent incentive to pay attention to your virtual pets.\n\nThe new versus mode options flesh out the limited versus mode of the DC original. Sega has added nearly four times as many levels for competitive play, bolstering the roster to over 30 2-player modes. Every stage in the game can now be raced on, and some have even been graphically remixed, like a snow-covered version of the City Escape level. In addition to the new stages, this version boasts six new playable characters: Amy Rose and Metal Sonic from Sonic CD, Chaos Zero and Tikal from Sonic Adventure, and two different Chao Walker robots. Each of the twelve characters has distinctive strengths, weaknesses, and attacks. This mode truly offers a great deal of fun, addictive gameplay. SA2B gels nicely with the GameCube's reputation as a good party console.\n\nOverall, Sonic's Nintendo debut shows him in fine form, but he gets dragged down a bit by his slightly less-fun pals. The stellar graphics, tight control, and replayability easily make it the best action/platform game yet for the GameCube. Sega's addition of new multi-player and GBA-link abitlities further sweetens the deal. Mario must finally share his limelight with Sonic, and fans can now enjoy two incredible franchises on one platform.​\n\nFull Review (Gamespy)\n\n9. Star Fox Adventures\n\nRare, Nintendo, 2002, 1 Player\n\nStar Fox Adventures is an epic undertaking -- a perfect companion to the Zelda series. Fox sets down in ThornTail Hollow, a green-filled, peaceful hub world with various dinosaurs grazing about. It's not nearly as large or impressive as Hyrule Field was when gamers first saw it on N64, but it's ambitious nonetheless. The hub leads out most of the other areas Fox can travel to, which range from beach locales to icy worlds, volcanic points and crater-filled, moon-like terrains. There are additionally several locations that the character can only reach by Arwing -- scattered chunks of Dinosaur Planet adrift in space. The game moves in and around them.\n\nRare has done a lot right here. It has successfully created a vast world sewed together by a main quest and also connected by various sub goals. Fox must not only retrieve four Force Point Seals, but six Krazoa Spirits (ghostly entities that possess the power to free early-captured Krystal from her prison), too. He can only complete these objectives if he has first rescued Prince Tricky, a sidekick character that is more or less an annoying baby dinosaur.\n\nIn the end, Star Fox Adventures delivers gamers with a fun, long quest with inspiration from the Zelda franchise at every turn. It's our opinion that Link's exploits still beat out Fox's in every gameplay related category, but that doesn't make this -- Rare's final GameCube offering -- any less sweet. This is also one of the longest, more difficult games available for Nintendo's console, which is something of a relief for me and I'm sure for countless other players looking for something deeper than usual.\n\nThere's lots of exploration to be had, character building elements, fun puzzles and not so fun puzzles, and some amazingly beautiful worlds to see and visit. Rare's technology is practically unparalleled. Whether or not this needed to be a Star Fox game is debatable. The license seems to have been applied at the last hour and though there are a few interesting additions in this regard, the majority of the game deals with prehistoric happenings and magic. The flight missions come as more of an afterthought than anything else.​\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n8. Killer 7\n\nCapcom, Capcom, 2005, 1 Player.\n\nThis is a particularly difficult game to review because its Achilles heel is its awkward control setup, which feels archaic by today's standards. And yet, despite this issue we're confident that players who adore old-school adventure games like Myst and Snatcher will enjoy -- maybe even love -- Killer 7 for the very same reasons. Capcom has delivered a game with a bold vision and an intriguingly \"out there\" storyline that is bound to keep players guessing until the very end.\n\nThe videogame industry is filled with so many me-too clones of games that Killer 7 -- erupting with style, mood and undiluted craziness -- arrives like a crisp breath of fresh air.\n\nThrough gorgeous, exceptionally stylistic anime-influenced cut-scenes we learn that Killer 7 is set in an alternate timeline where the world has achieved total peace and prosperity. But just when all seems well, a new terrorist threat shows its ugly head.Fearing for the safety of the nation, the United States contracts the Killer 7, a group consisting of the world's seven deadliest assassins, to discover what evil force is behind the Heaven Smile and eliminate it.\n\nWhere some games struggle to define a single character, Killer 7 features seven, and all of them are well crafted and intriguing for different reasons. Gamers will want to become each one, which is good because it's a requirement. The game consists of three different play types. The first is third-person exploration and this is undoubtedly the area that some critics will have the majority of complaints about. For some strange reason, Capcom opted not to enable full freedom control during exploration. Rather, members of the Killer 7 follow branching pathways. They are on semi-rails.\n\nKiller 7 screams presentation from beginning to end and it's the game's totally out of control storyline, complemented by a cast of oddball characters, that makes the overall experience so inspired. The adventure oozes style, thanks in large to a wholly unique cel-shaded graphic technique that successfully blends the traditionally cartoony approach with very adult themes.

Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes\n\nSilicon Knights/ Konami, Konami, 2004, 1 Player.\n\nWhat most PlayStation fans already know and few Nintendo loyalists probably realize is that Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes -- like the game it's based on -- features a truly epic storyline. It is this story, filled with plot twists and subtleties, which is the backbone for the stealth and combat elements that engulf it.\n\nThe game features several hours of cut-scenes, which is why it comes on two discs, and though the dialogue remains the same throughout Konami has really upped the quality of the cinematics. All of the voice actors, including David Hayter, have re-acted and re-recorded their speech work for these sequences. Most of the changes are for the better, but a handful of MGS purists may complain about the differences. For instance, one of the characters who spoke with a strong Asian accent in the PS1 title talks without any accent at all in Twin Snakes. Meanwhile the action, guided by famed Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura (Versus), has been totally re-choreographed and it now shines with bullet-time camera pans and dazzling character acrobatics. And the graphics have been enhanced so dramatically that at points the real-time scenes appear to be more detailed and more stylized than many of the more impressive fully CG rendered videos in other games.\n\nThe story, which begins with operative Solid Snake inside an underwater pod which has been jettisoned toward a weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago, will suck you in from the very start because it's so well presented. The narrative is not shallow or unrefined, as tales in many of today's high-budgeted titles sadly remain, but smart and gritty, with unexpected bits of humor and a confidence by creator Hideo Kojima to every so often step outside of the game and poke fun at it​\n\nSilicon Knights has thankfully injected new abilities -- moves ripped directly from the PS2 sequel. The additions encapsulate everything from being able to target and shoot at enemies in first-person mode (a dynamic that dramatically changes boss fights) to being able to drag the bodies of guards, to hide in lockers, to hang from ledges, and more. These extras can alter the play experience in significant ways, sometimes for the better and other times for the worse. When Snakes finds himself surrounded by a set of soldiers on an upper level, he can now simply hop over the ledge to the ground below. Easy, safe, no mess and no fuss. On the other hand, targeting and blasting at bosses in the first-person can turn what was once a difficult battle into a decidedly easy one, which is a disappointment. You'll occasionally get the sense that more balancing was needed.\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n6. Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II - Rogue Leader\n\nFactor 5, LucasArts, 2001, 1 Player.\n\nRogue Leader is Star Wars the way you remember it. Except this time you're piloting the ships and fighting for the Rebellion, in the struggle to overcome the evil GALACTIC EMPIRE. We often compare games to movies, but from the archetypal star screen introduction right the way through to the game's monumental climax, this is the ultimate accompaniment and tribute to those three original Star Wars movies we all cherish.\n\nVisually this is Star Wars as you saw it on the big screen. Scenes from the films are remodelled in the crisp game engine and look almost perfect, accompanied by John Williams' inimitable score and virtually any of the films' sound effects you might care to mention. From the intricately detailed planes of the Death Star with TIEs swooping this way and that, to the sight of Bespin emerging from the haze, and the inevitable approach and decimation of the then imperial-laden city, Rogue Leader leaves little to the imagination. This is Star Wars. You will feel like you are there.\n\nRogue Leader begins with players taking on the guise of that whiny runt Skywalker, and as a warm-up budding pilots must down the original Death Star, first taking out laser towers and slaying a number of TIE Fighters. With a little help from Han Solo (and of course the Force) Luke puts pay to deplorable imperial machinations. And then the game gets interesting.\n\nRogue Leader is the absolute pinnacle of Star Wars games. It's bloody hard in places, but it pampers the nostalgic and conveys so effortlessly the beauty of the galaxy and the sheer tyranny of the evil Empire that you will Force your way through it until there's no stone left unturned. Some have said that it wouldn't be as good without the Star Wars aspect, that it's a fairly mediocre space combat game, but to me that's a ridiculous argument. Rogue Leader is the embodiment of Star Wars in a videogame. That is the point. This is a game charting the progress of Luke and Wedge through the Star Wars trilogy, and it's the perfect vehicle for fans of the series who have always wanted it to be real.​\n\nFull Review (Eurogamer)\n\n5. Resident Evil\n\nCapcom, Capcom, 2002, 1 Player.\n\nThe first thing you'll probably notice about the new Resident Evil is that the gameplay hasn't changed all that much since it debuted more than five years ago. Granted, all the improvements to the control scheme that Capcom has instituted over the years have been included, such as the quick turnaround and the ability to shoot while backing up. But many of the issues associated with the tanklike character movement have remained.\n\nThe gameplay isn't just the same old thing. A number of new twists have been added to Resident Evil for the GameCube, such as the defense items, which add quite a bit of strategy to the game. At the game's outset, you choose from one of two characters to play as, each of whom has his or her own set of weaponry. Jill can use a taser that will send electricity coursing through the zombies' bodies, while Chris can lodge a hand grenade into a zombie's mouth, shoot it, and watch the fireworks.\n\nCapcom has finally perfected the art of mixing prerendered scenery with ambient animations and polygonal objects, and the result is the most visually impressive video game ever released. The attention to detail is exceptional. Your character's image is reflected in the smallest bit of liquid, dust particles swirl in the light, patches of volumetric fog blow across the screen, and each blade of grass sways independently of the others. Of particular note is the gore--it is, by far, the most graphically realistic gore ever included in a game. Blood will gush from bodies and somehow realistically splatter onto the prerendered walls, and when large amounts of the red stuff hit the carpet you can still see the carpet's pattern through the stain. Taking off a zombie's head with the shotgun rewards you with an explosion of particle effects that simply has to be seen to be appreciated. The real-time lighting and shadows are equally impressive, and how Capcom managed to make them work so well with the prerendered backgrounds is anyone's guess.\n\nAll of Resident Evil's various elements come together to give you a good old-fashioned case of the creeps. With two playable characters, three difficulty settings, almost a dozen different endings, and branching story paths depending on whether certain objectives are met, the game also offers you plenty to do. Anyone with a penchant for the macabre will be blown away by Resident Evil, and even if you're only vaguely into this sort of game, it's still a must-buy. With the exception of the dated control scheme, Capcom has nearly perfected its craft and created the best Resident Evil ever.​\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)\n\n3. Luigi's Mansion\n\nNintendo, Nintendo, 2001, 1 Player.\n\nThe premise is extremely simple. By way of a peculiar stroke of luck, Luigi has won a mansion in a competition he never even entered, and agrees to meet his brother Mario there for a celebration. Unfortunately, after wandering aimlessly through a spooky forest, our hero discovers that his mansion prize is little more than an elaborate trap, and headstrong Mario has already fallen victim. Teaming up with local oddball Professor E. Gadd, Luigi vows to rid the mansion of its ghostly inhabitants and rescue his brother. The game is a bold departure from previous Mario Brothers titles.\n\nThe puzzles are never too hard, nor too easy, and utilize all areas of the control system. Along the way, Luigi catches fleeting glimpses of a greater adversary and his endangered sibling, both literally, through a secret tunnel in a murky place, and metaphysically, through the helpful psychic Madame Clairvoya, who will analyse a handful of things stripped from Mario during his passage to imprisonment if Luigi can find them. The mansion and tasks form an extremely congruous adventure, however all-over-the-place the game may feel, and little diversions and submissions - like the collection of dropped pearls to make better picture frames - add classic Nintendo diversity to the already unique atmosphere.\n\nSpeaking of atmosphere, one of the game's finest assets is its soundtrack. Although the haunted mansion theme is typically good, and whistled nervously by the game's star as he trundles down hallways avoiding phantom bats and rats, the little side pieces make all the difference. The game is eerie and uncomfortable, augmented superbly by the composers, and yet the end product still manages to look and sound like a Mario adventure.\n\nAlthough this is something of a compliment to the intuitive control system, finishing the game takes roughly five hours if you take it at a leisurely pace, and although coin-collectors are rewarded and Miyamoto has added a few extra bits and bobs to uncover since the Japanese and American releases, this isn't going to last you more than a weekend.​\n\nFull Review (Eurogamer)\n\n3. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem\n\nSilicon Knights, Nintendo, 2002, 1 Player.\n\nThis is one of those games you wait and wait for, hoping that is everything you expected it to be. And it turns out it's not everything you expected it to be, it turns out to be so much more. Eternal Darkness is one of those games that stood out.\n\nAn intriguing story that will confuse you at first, and will require you to put together all the pieces. It is very interesting, and with such an array of characters, this is the best story I have seen in a non-RPG yet.\n\nEternal Darkness has its share of magic in this game, and I am happy to say that it fits in well. You can enchant your weapon to make it more powerful, or just simple recover yourself. Of course your magic basically revolves around your opposing magic, which you will understand when you play the game. Luckily magic is not too powerful in this game, and besides the Shield and Enchant Weapon you will not be forced to use them that much.\n\nThere are three different methods to beat the game. Red/Blue/Green. Each of these will have a different boss battle against the Guardian, it will affect other cutscenes and how you play the game period. Also to fully understand the story another play through is needed, because you will be confused the first time through anyway. But one more time through it not enough, to solve the entire mystery of Eternal Darkness you will need to beat it three times, once with each color. That is how the game works, and it is not a hassle either. No, it is fairly fun. After you beat it the three times with each color, you may play through again with your favorite color or such, cause this is such a good game.\n\nHonestly, if you own a gamecube and don't own this, I don't know what is wrong with you. Turn in all the other Gamecube game to earn the money, or get a second job. Eternal Darkness is the sole reason to buy a Gamecube, and is the greatest non-RPG to date.​\n\n2. Viewtful Joe\n\nCapcom, Capcom, 2003, 1 Player.\n\nDigested at its most basic, Viewtiful Joe is a competent scrolling beat 'em up with a nice gimmick - dodging. As Joe moves along from left-to-right (although he'll often end up heading down spiral staircases and turn plenty of corners, the camera retains the side-on perspective throughout, preserving the 2D gameplay instead of picking odd perspectives like some sort of modern day Crash Bandicoot), he is faced with various enemies who leap into the picture and stick up their dukes. Let's be clear - we know people who own Viewtiful Joe and love it to bits, and they have no idea about the depth of the combo system, and that it's possible to rake in massive scores by collecting multipliers, keeping enemies in a dizzy state and smashing them into one another. They're happy anyway. The combo system is like a neat little extra for determined, stylish players who enjoy this sort of device. And though you might topple the easier \"Kids\" mode without much knowledge of it, beating the rock hard \"Adults\" difficulty setting (and the harder modes subsequently unlocked) requires a dedication to big points totals. With tougher enemies down the line (whose attack patterns take a lot more to overcome - like the gunslinging robots whose bullets need to be smacked back at them in Slow-Motion to achieve a dizzying effect), getting a big combo becomes increasingly hard, but increasingly rewarding, with more points on offer and more objects in the environment to crumple and explode their way into the combo.\n\nBut Viewtiful Joe is more than just a playground for the dextrous hardcore. One of the reasons you're almost guaranteed to persist, whether you're into the combo mechanism or not, is that it's been scripted, drawn and programmed with so much loving care. The visuals may look obscure to those of you with just screenshots to go by, but you'll love them from the very first cut sequence - as a towering, mechanised Captain Blue finds his beautifully detailed metallic backside crumpled unceremoniously across a cinema full of empty seats - to the very last boss.\n\nViewtiful Joe is imaginative, beautiful, engaging and above all else entertaining. It's a timeless piece of quality gaming that, with the exception of its visual element, would probably work on any format, past or present. We could level a couple of criticisms at it, maybe arguing that it's overcompensating for its relative brevity with a rock hard difficulty level, or that the camera doesn't always capture enough of the action, but those are points we've had to sit here and dream up, because unless you really try not to like it, very little is likely to dent your appreciation of Viewtiful Joe.\n\nFull Review (Eurogamer)​\n\n1. Resident Evil 4\n\nCapcom, Capcom, 2005, 1 Player.\n\nIt's clear from the start that Capcom have made huge changes to the series. Immediately, it's obvious that this is one of the best looking games you will see.\n\nYou will hardly ever find yourself wandering around lost, either. There is still a large element of exploration; you just won't have to stroll from one side of an area to another, then back again, just because you need a crank. There is just no wasted motion this time around, and it makes for a more enjoyable experience. You feel like you are constantly moving forward, constantly heading towards the next set piece or enemies and bigger, better rewards. Even something as simple as the inventory has been given a tweak, rotating and moving objects around so you can squeeze that one extra weapon in to it is like a mini puzzle game. It's just another area of the series where tedium has been replaced with pure gaming fun.\n\nWant more? What about replay value? RE4 has this in bucket loads. As well as the RE standards such as new weapons and alternative outfits, you can also unlock the Mercenaries mode, where you can play as some select characters from the series in a survival battle against legions of unlimited enemies, with the highest scores unlocking even more content! This mode is practically a game in itself, more like Robotron than Resident Evil, but still fantastic. Fantastic fun.\n\nGood sequels are an evolution of a series – improving on everything the previous incarnation did yet keeping what made it enjoyable in the first place. Resident Evil 4 is even more than this. It is a revolution, bigger than just it's older brothers and sisters. It's bigger than survival horror. It has not only completely revitalized Capcom's aging series, but given a rocket up the backside of everyone making a sequel in the gaming world - This is how you do it.\n\nI said Resident Evil 4 is the best game on the Gamecube, and I'll be honest, that's not totally true. Resident Evil 4 is more than that. It's the best game of this generation, across all three major formats and will take some beating well into the next one too. After all the glamour and graphics are taken away, one thing remains - games are supposed to be fun, and this one offers more fun than any other.​\n\nFull Review (Nintendo Life)\n\n​\n\nFighting Games:\n\nThe fighting games will be appearing here. As said above, games that already appeared won't be listed again. So Smash Bros isn't listed here because it is listed in the Nintendo category.​\n\n4. Godzilla: Destroy all Monsters Melee\n\nPipeworks, Infogrames, 2002, 1-4 Players\n\nYes, this is yet another game with gigantic lizards wreaking havoc on human civilizations, but unlike the other Godzilla video game incarnations that have hit the market, this one pays homage to the classic Japanese films. Not only do the monsters look like people wearing rubber suits, all of the original sound effects are in place, and the story is as outrageous as can be. With all of these components in place, Destroy All Monsters Melee is the first Godzilla game that captures all the beauty and comedic value of the license.\n\nYou'll certainly find yourself rolling over in laughter as the mutated titans clash onscreen and lay waste to the most populated cities across the globe, but you may also think that the gameplay is a laughing matter – actually, you may be completely turned off by it. There really isn't much to the fighting system. Each creature has an assortment of unique abilities, and every creature can pick up objects within the environment. So in a sense, if you are playing as Godzilla, you can perform a three-hit punch combo, spray the opposition with your energy breath, lift up a 10-story building and hurl it your adversary's head.\n\nThis gameplay design actually works quite well, especially for the rip-roaring four-player melees. This may sound absurd, but Godzilla's multiplayer presence is gargantuan. If you get sick and tired of beating each other senseless, you can always take out your aggression in Destruction mode – a timed match to see which player can destroy the most of a city.\n\nGodzilla may not be the deepest game in the world, and it may lack variety, but it's one heck of a party game and a highly amusing feast for the eyes.\n\nThere is little doubt that Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee is completely and utterly silly, but there is also no denying it is an incredible amount of fun. In fact, I would go so far as to say this is the most exciting wrestling/fighting game since WCW Revenge on Nintendo 64 – it's that entertaining.\n\nFull Review (Game Informer)​\n\n4. Def Jam: Fight for NY\n\nAki Corporation/ EA Canada, EA, 2004, 1-4 Players.\n\nEA has added a robust cast of characters, arenas, and an awesome Story Mode along with turning Def Jam from a strict wrestler into a true brawler. A lot has been done and the sequel is much better for it. Packed with more than 70 fighters, 30 licensed sound tracks, 20 venues, and 10 game modes, there's really little else you could ask for in terms of bulk. The fighter list is pretty impressive, especially considering more than 40 of those fighters are celebrities.\n\nIn Story Mode, your custom character will get new hair styles, tattoos, jewelry, and clothes. All of these changes are displayed in the mug shot load screen before each match as well as every single cut-scene in the 6+ hour story mode. That helps to make it feel like you are truly progressing through the story. The Story Mode is Def Jam's greatest strength. What I'm about to say may be shocking, it may be controversial, but damn if it isn't true -- Def Jam: Fight for NY's story is better than Fable's. Yes, the story of a fighting game is actually better than that of Microsoft's excellent RPG. In fact, this is probably the best story ever seen in a fighting game. That's not too hard, since most fighting games feature very bizarre and almost incomprehensible storylines.\n\nAlong with Story Mode, there are numerous multiplayer modes as well. The modes are good and with so many characters to choose from, Fight for NY will stay fresh and likely remain in your console for a good long time. There's no mode that isn't enjoyable and really no fighter that you can't win with.\n\nEven if you don't end up the biggest fan of the grappling system, the Blazin' Moves are certain to leave anyone impressed. There's a great sense of fun, of true enjoyment in the development of Fight for NY and that translates to the game. In the end, Fight for NY is a very good game that could well lead to a true classic if EA addresses the current issues in its next iteration.\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n2. Capcom vs. SNK 2: EO\n\nCapcom, Capcom, 2002, 2 Players.\n\nNintendo fans have waited far too long for a true fighting game, but the wait is finally over with arrival of Capcom Vs. SNK 2: EO for GameCube. The title comes to the console as a port of a port of a port of a port of a port, or something like that -- all based on a classic 2D brawler originally premiered in the arcades.It combines classic Capcom and SNK characters, different grooves and game styles, hordes of fighters on each side, and then douses everything with an endless supply of brawler moves and combos. For traditionalists, it's one of the most complete fighting packages around.\n\nThe play mechanics are ripped right out of the old school book of fighters: lots of high-flying punch and kick combinations, more over-the-top special moves, and a wide wealth of projectile opportunities in between. Some partnerships are meant to be and others have to work at it. Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO and the GameCube controller fall into the latter half, and this is quite honestly our biggest gripe with the fighting experience. We won't go so far as to suggest the relationship ruins the game -- that's an exaggeration that's simply not true. We've been able to deal with and, after some practice, master the setup, despite its drawbacks, and the end experience is still a fun one. Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO is a solid 2D fighter on GameCube. It's the type of game that won't win any benchmarks in any single department, but its presence fills a gap -- one that would have been felt for sure without it.​\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n2. Ultimate Muscle: Legends vs. New Generation\n\nAki Corporation, Bandai, 2002, 1-4 Players.\n\nFans of classic wrestling games know the Aki Corporation quite well, as it has developed some of the most time-tested and enjoyable wrestling games ever. Published by Bandai, Ultimate Muscle is a departure of sorts for Aki, since sim-based gameplay mechanics are nowhere to be found in the game and have been replaced by a blistering pace and frenzied style of action that make for a crazy, yet enjoyable, gameplay experience.\n\nUltimate Muscle controls very similarly to other Aki games, but, since the majority of standard wrestling mechanics simply don't apply in this game, there are some key differences. Special moves and power-ups are also a key factor in Ultimate Muscle's gameplay.\n\nThe most notable and surprising difference in Ultimate Muscle's gameplay, however, is its difficulty. Ultimate Muscle is, at its core, an arcade fighting game, and it maintains an extremely brisk pace. This speed, coupled with some extremely tough opponent AI, will require you to pay rapt attention at all times, because, quite simply, your opponent will absolutely destroy you if you aren't constantly one step ahead.\n\nIt's true that Ultimate Muscle isn't for everyone. Wrestling purists looking for another round of Aki-styled simulation wrestling are just going to have to look elsewhere, because this game contains very little of that. Furthermore, the game's high focus on timing and speed, coupled with its brutal AI, may prove to be a little too difficult for more-casual fans of the cartoon. However, anyone looking for an entertaining arcade-style wrestling experience will find plenty to like about Ultimate Muscle: Legends vs. New Generation and should absolutely check this game out.\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)​\n\n1. Soul Calibur 2\n\nNamco, Namco, 2003, 2 Players.\n\nIf you played and enjoyed the original Soul Calibur, chances are good that you'll also enjoy the sequel since it's so much like the first game. That also means Soul Calibur II won't impress you as much as its predecessor, since you've seen most of these characters, their weapons, and their moves before, and the available gameplay modes are nothing out of the ordinary. Nevertheless, on its own terms, Soul Calibur II is by all means a great fighting game, and Namco has done a fine job of making each respective console version equally enticing.\n\nThe gameplay has been tweaked since Soul Calibur, to account for some of the issues that highly experienced players of the previous game picked up on. However, most players won't really notice the different properties of crouching or of lateral movement or things like that.\n\nSoul Calibur II's artificial intelligence is pretty good. At higher levels of difficulty, the computer delivers relentless competition, and it knows how to turn the tables in situations where it's getting close to being knocked out of the ring--though, in time, you'll probably pick up on some moves and patterns that the AI can't effectively contend with. Of course, fighting games are best when played against other human players of equivalent skill, and in these situations, Soul Calibur II can be just as entertaining as the previous installment in the series. The gameplay is as accessible as ever--just pick a fighter like Maxi or Kilik, and jam on the slash buttons to witness their impressive combat styles.\n\nIf nothing else, Soul Calibur II is proof of how outstanding 1999's Soul Calibur really was. Like its predecessor, this sequel can provide countless hours of fast-paced, great looking battles--though if you played a lot of the previous Soul Calibur game, you'll be hard-pressed to sustain or even muster up the same level of enthusiasm over this update. That's not to say Soul Calibur II doesn't pack in any thrills of its own. It's certainly one of the most refined, most accessible, and best-looking 3D fighting games to date, and it's squarely the best game in its class for the GameCube.\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)\n\n​\n\nSports and Racing:\n\nObviously sports games like soccer, football, tennis, nba games, golf will appear here. Racing games too...​\n\n7. Ribbit King\n\nJamsworks, Bandai, 2003, 4 Players.\n\nRibbit King, a truly twisted title that creates a new sport called Frolf (which is, basically, golfing with frogs instead of balls), is yet another game aimed at hardcore devotees of Japanese whimsy.\n\nWhile the basic mechanics are that of a simplified golf game (with a rudimentary two-click swing), the real meat of the Ribbit King experience comes from exploring the strange \"gimmicks\" strewn throughout each course. These include spiderwebs that can bounce your frog further distances, giant snakes that shake you in their jaws until you jiggle the analog stick to break free, or even conveyor belts that take frogs to otherwise inaccessible platforms. Much of your score depends on mastering these gimmick combos, which earn you big points (often more than getting the frog in the hole). This makes for an odd brand of play, but often the gimmicks are too random in effect to really allow for strategy. Many times, you'll hit what looks like a bum shot, only to be whisked through an unforeseen sequence of gimmicks that place you right up to the hole. While it's certainly amusing, after a time the heavy reliance on gimmicks felt, well, kind of gimmicky.\n\nAs much as I dug this goofy little game, it's certainly not going to appeal to a wide audience. It's too basic and odd to strike a chord with mainstream gamers. But those who like their games heavy on Japanese flavor will definitely be pleased with this strange golf title. It looks a little bit sharper on the GameCube than on the PS2, but it's a bizarrely fun time on either system, and the unlockable cartoons on the bonus disc are a hoot. Yep, it's definitely as odd as it sounds, but if that's your thing (I know it's mine), then you'll have a blast with this title.​\n\nFull Review (Game Inormer)\n\n7. NHL Hitz 20-03\n\nBlaack Box Games, Midway, 2002, 4 Players.\n\nMidway's sports formula is simple: deliver tight, easy to pick up games that are good to play alone, but great to play with your buddies, and you'll have a hit on your hands.\n\nIf you love action sports games, this is a no-brainer. If you love hockey, it's an even easier decision. If you also have friends who like to play games against you and each other, well, then... you need this game, my friend.\n\nThe gameplay is as straightforward as it gets. Your three guys (and goalie) are trying to get the puck past the other three guys and their goalie. You can use any means at your disposal--blistering slap shots, ice-shaking hits, and dekes that would make Wayne Gretzky blush. There isn't anything too fancy about the Hitz engine, and that's a good thing. For action-based, arcade-style hockey, gameplay needs to be easy to pick up and hard to put down. Hitz delivers on both counts.\n\nLuckily, the controls are tight, responsive and easy to learn. Within ten seconds of grabbing the controller, you've got the basic moves down, and it's all about testing skills against your foe. It's the perfect dorm room game, in the same way the old Genesis NHL games were.\n\nHitz is a better multiplayer game than anything, but that shouldn't surprise anyone. What's nice about this year's edition, however, is that the franchise portion of the game has been expanded considerably. In addition, there is a full NHL Season mode, plus Mini Games and Hockey School with Scotty Bowman, the NHL's winningest coach.\n\nIf you're looking for one excellent multiplayer sports game, this one will fill that need. What's more, the single player game has been improved considerably. Not only is it more challenging, but the Franchise and Season Modes will result in hours of solo gameplay.​\n\nFull Review (IGN).\n\n7. Crazy Taxi\n\nHitmaker, Acclaim, 2001, 1 Player.\n\nThe addictive title was a smash hit in the arcades and was also one of the best pieces of software available for Sega's now-deceased Dreamcast system. However, despite the critical acclaim Crazy Taxi could only cater to Dreamcast's comparatively limited userbase. So Acclaim has nabbed the license from Sega in an effort to give the widening next-generation console audience. However, it appears that Sega has given Acclaim no creative freedom, so Crazy Taxi on GameCube is almost a pixel-for-pixel port. Nearly nothing has changed.\n\nThe concept behind Crazy Taxi is basic on the exterior. You are an extreme, edgy Taxi driver that gives the city locals the rides of their lives. The city is huge and there are a huge number of fares to pick up -- there's someone around every corner. Everybody has a different place to go and to give you an idea of how far you will have to travel your potential pick-ups are color coded. Red passengers want a short ride, yellow will take you slightly farther, and green fares usually want to go all the way across town. Because everything is time-based you have to try to make as much money as possible from the fares in the given time limit. Each successful pick-up results in a time bonus. So you'll have to constantly carry a passenger if you want to stay in the game. It's clearly an arcade game at heart and it shows, but, man, what a ride it is.\n\nInterestingly, Acclaim changed the voices from the Dreamcast version. We're not sure if Sega's contract ran short on the original or exactly what happened, but they have gotten worse. They weren't especially good to begin with, but now they're ever more mediocre.\n\nCrazy Taxi is an awesome game if you didn't play it on previous systems. Don't let its original 1998 release sway you from picking it up for GameCube if you haven't played it before. Chances are you've heard good things about it and now you can enjoy it on a Nintendo system.\n\nFull Review (IGN)​\n\n7. Mario Superstars Baseball\n\nNamco, Nintendo, 2005, 4 Players.\n\nWhile longtime Nintendo fans might be alarmed at the change in developers, they needn't worry. Mario Superstar Baseball is every bit as good as -- and in some cases better than -- Camelot's fantastic line of Mario sports titles.\n\nThe graphics are stylistically and technically impressive. Most of the characters have never looked better, particularly in the cutscenes, which are simply delightful. This is a gorgeous game that's sure to make any Mario fan giddy. The music and sound effects aren't as memorable, but help add to the game's personality. The tracks are cheery and each character spouts his or her trademark phrase.\n\nOne interesting facet of the game is its buddy system that takes advantage of each character's relationship. This affects the way you position your players on the field as well as your batting order. It's important to note which characters like each other; just because Luigi is fond of Daisy doesn't mean that Mario is as well. You'll want to make sure your infielders are \"friends\" so you can pull off double plays easier. You'll also want to lineup as many friendly characters in your batting order as possible since this will make multi-run rallies easier to come by.\n\nAnother twist on traditional baseball is the star system. You can use a star to pull off a super pitch or a super hit. When your captain friend characters do so, it costs you one star, but if another player opts for it then it costs two. There will also be one-on-one showdowns in the game where you can earn more stars. The star system adds layers of fun and strategy to each game. As a multiplayer game, Mario Superstar Baseball is pretty excellent. Up to four players can participate in straight up baseball games, the various mini-games, and an interesting Toy Field mode (which is really just a bigger mini-game that's given its own menu option). With a great main game and lots of fun mini-games, I'd go as far as to say that this is a much better party game than the last few Mario Party releases.\n\nFull Review (Game Spy)​\n\n7. Burnout 2: Point of Impact\n\nCriterion Games, Acclaim, 2003, 2 Players.\n\nLet's get one thing out of the way right now: Burnout 2 is no driving sim. It has about as much in common with real-world driving as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater has in common with real-world skateboarding. Anyone looking for the next Gran Turismo should simply stand aside now. Anyone looking for the fastest-moving street racing game in the world, however, should step right up.\n\nLike its predecessor, Burnout 2 cuts right to the chase. There's no fancy storyline to be found here. The game simply breaks it down into a couple of different modes.\n\nBurnout 2 has very tight control, which is an absolute necessity, given the high-speed nature of the game. It sticks to a few simple mechanics--gas, brake, turbo, shifting (if you decide to go with a manual transmission), and, sure enough, your horn. The courses are filled with law-abiding traffic, and the only way to fill up your boost meter is to drive recklessly. Near misses with other cars, driving on the wrong side of the road, powersliding, and catching air are all things that will fill up your boost bar. Once it's full, you can hit the boosters, which causes a The Fast and the Furious-style nitrous effect to kick in, causing the road to seem like it's stretching out in the process. If you continue to drive in a dangerous manner without actually crashing, you might even score a second boost bar immediately after your first drains. Indeed, if you're sharp enough on the road, it's conceivable that you could simply boost your way through the entire race. But once you really get moving, staying safe becomes much more difficult.\n\nThe game moves incredibly quickly and maintains a firm, smooth frame rate throughout. You need to keep your eyes on the road when you're really cooking, because the traffic comes up suddenly, and you have to react just as quickly. Simply put, the sense of speed delivered by Burnout 2 is nearly unmatched.\n\nIn the end, Burnout 2 isn't terribly different from the original Burnout--it just makes significantly better use of all the elements that the game does well, from its blistering sense of speed to its hilariously destructive crashes. The crash mode alone makes this game worth seeing, and the inclusion of the well-done championship and multiplayer modes makes it a must-own for fans of arcade racing.​\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)\n\n7. Mario Power Tennis\n\nCamelot Software Planning, Nintendo, 2004, 4 Players.\n\nMario Power Tennis is a fantastic example of Nintendo in top form. Here's an offering with brightly colored visuals and cheery music. It is, in a word, adorable. But under this gingerbread exterior lies a deep and challenging game of tennis. It certainly takes some liberties with the sport--because the last time we checked, you weren't allowed to bring giant hammers or jetpacks onto the court--but these twists definitely keep things interesting and are intrinsic to the goofy, character-driven style of the Mario name.\n\nThe game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, especially if you've already been playing Top Spin, Virtua Tennis, or the original Mario Tennis for the N64. It's pretty much self-explanatory.\n\nBecause of the wild visuals and some of the insane mechanics the game adds to the mix, the great lengths Mario Power Tennis goes to in making its fundamental tennis mechanics incredibly realistic are not immediately obvious. The power of your shots is affected by your position relative to the ball, the ball's height, and the direction in which you're going when you strike the ball. Each character also has a unique set of strengths and weaknesses, which makes who you choose to play with almost as important as how you play.\n\nOne of the most attractive points of Mario Power Tennis is that just about every mode can be played with four players. Whether it's a full doubles match or one of the crazy minigame challenges, Mario Power Tennis is an incredibly attractive package for those looking to kill some time with friends. The quick pacing and variety of gameplay styles mean that a group of four can play for five minutes or an hour and still come away with a great experience either way.\n\nIf you think that you're too cool for brightly colored visuals and cheery music, get over yourself. Yes, Nintendo may be making a concerted effort to appeal to a younger audience with its aesthetics, but it hasn't forgotten about adults, either. Mario Power Tennis is a shining example of Nintendo's \"family gaming\" philosophy. It's such an expertly crafted, well-rounded package that it goes well beyond appealing to just Nintendo fans or to just tennis fans. Instead, it's a suitable game for players of all shapes and sizes​\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)\n\n4. Super Mario Strikers\n\nNext Level Games, Nintendo, 2005, 4 Players.\n\nHere in Super Mario Strikers, the gang takes on the beautiful sport in four-on-four competition that focuses squarely on the main cast of Nintendo greats. Each team you control includes three sidekicks and one team captain.\n\nWhile the sidekicks have their place on the field--and can be effective in the right situations on both offense and defense--you'll likely want the ball at the feet of your captain when the game is on the line. Captains, after all, are the ones with the superstrike abilities--essentially massive aerial stunt kicks that, if they find the back of the net, are worth two goals as opposed to a measly one. Each captain has his or her own superstrike animation and, while they're all unique and dramatic in appearance, they're all relatively easy to pull off. Still, despite these flaws, it's undeniable that Strikers' pick-up-and-play design will have you playing like a cartoon Pele in no time. Lob passes are a breeze, as are one-time kicks, which usually result in some fantastically animated trick shots such as headers and bicycle kicks.\n\nSuper Mario Strikers is an enjoyable but unremarkable game, especially in multiplayer, where up to four players can battle it out in any combination of matchups (two-on-two, three-on-one, or four player co-op). With a number of tournament cups to win, variable difficulty levels, and a decent number of unlockable prizes, the game has some nominal replay value. While there are moments of pure Nintendo-branded fun in Super Mario Strikers, these moments are really just punctuation marks on the longer stretches, which, despite dashes of Nintendo charm, feel far more traditional than you might expect.​\n\nFull Review (Gamespot).\n\n4. NBA Street Vol. 2\n\nEA Canada, EA Sports, 2003, 4 Players.\n\nWith so much fun crammed onto one disc, the fifty dollars you'll spend on NBA Street Volume 2 could be the best money you'll spend on a videogame this year. So far in 2003, it's the MVP of sports games and only a few of its EA football siblings have a chance to take that crown.The structure of Vol. 2 is at least as important as the gameplay itself since every game you play, in any mode, has the potential to make you successful in every other gameplay mode.\n\nSince they're all linked together, there's a good 30-40 hours of single player gameplay between NBA Challenge, Be a Legend and Street School. Be a Legend is by far the most satisfying since it's designed to build up both your and your character's skills step by step so that you'll quickly be putting on your own highlight show in every game you play. In creating your character, everything has a certain cost in development points. Your character's physical dimensions, shoes, outfits, move list and attributes all cost DP's that you'll have to earn in Be a Legend mode itself or they can be purchased for reward points in the game's rewards store.\n\nBy separating the career mode of the previous game into separate parts, Street 2 allows gamers to experience different aspects of the same great game without ever feeling like they're wasting time or effort. But of course, the fact that NBA Street Volume 2 is an absolute blast to play is what holds everything together.\n\nBut as a total package, Street 2 is going to be tough to beat. The only thing that could challenge it at this point would be a football version of the same thing. Until that happens rest assured that you're in very good hands with the depth, the moves and the themes of NBA Street Vol. 2.​\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n4. 1080º Avalanche\n\nNintendo, Nintendo, 2003, 4 Players.\n\nThis 1080 sequel is very much modeled after the winning formula that powered the original game. It's a snowboarder with a greater emphasis on speed -- on flat out racing -- than on tricks and air time and it's here that the game is a success. The developer has done a fine job of making Avalanche look and feel fast and as a result you will find yourself sucked into many of its race scenarios.\n\nHowever, the real show stealer are the destructive avalanches in the game, which are extremely well done, occasionally huge and frantic, and extraordinarily entertaining. You'll outrace snow waves, dodge falling trees and rolling boulders, jump objects and take turns, and you'll do it all with the screen shaking and with a dangerous force chasing right behind. Actually, enjoyable is not the word. Insane, rather, is more descriptive.\n\nThere is a healthy selection of four gameplay modes, all of them entertaining for different reasons. The main draw is Match Race, which features 15 standard tracks spread across novice, hard and expert modes.\n\n1080: Avalanche is a fun snowboarding game that you'll probably like if you prefer speed over tricks in your downhill experience. That's basically what it boils down to, really, for this title's sense of speed is very satisfying and its avalanche elements make for absolute frenzied entertainment.​\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n2. Kirby Air Ride\n\nHal Laboratory, Nintendo, 2003, 4 Players (LAN).\n\nKirby Air Ride is a pretty strange game. At first, the racing mechanics appear mind-bogglingly simple, and the visuals sickeningly cute, but after digging a little deeper, a decent arcade-style racing title is uncovered. It's a simple premise at best. You need to pilot Kirby around a variety of fantastical courses in order to cross the finish line in first position. Using only the left analog control stick and the A button on the gamepad, you'll need to master a few different techniques in order to maximize your racing skills.\n\nYour vehicle -- or star -- will automatically accelerate throughout the race, so the A button is used to slow Kirby down, which in turn, builds up a boost meter. Boosting is the key to pipping the other guys across the finish line as well as gaining invaluable bursts of speed with which to hit ramps and jumps. Once airborne, Kirby can glide and dive around; a useful technique needed to gain more advantage over the other competitors.\n\nAll of this simple functionality adds up to make for a surprisingly deep racing experience. A lot of the winning and losing has to do with the myriad different stars that become available as challenges are met and beat, but the racing mechanics never deviate from a simplistic form.\n\nCompleting the challenges is a large task indeed. But you'll find plenty of distractions in the other two main gameplay modes: City Trial and Top Ride. Top Ride offers up some great four-player, top-down view, Super Sprint-style racing, while the more adventurous City Trial mode concentrates on a few solid minutes of powering up, rounded off by a large battle royale to conquer.\n\nFull Review (Gamespy)​\n\n2. SSX Tricky\n\nEA Canada, EA Sports BIG, 2001, 2 Players.\n\nEA Sports Big, the developer behind the game, has managed to produce a sequel that improves on the original in almost every respect and provides enough new content to keep fans of the original from crying foul.\n\nSet one year after the original game, SSX Tricky finds two of the riders from the original SSX on sabbatical, but they have been replaced by a stable of five young guns with even more personality. The foundation of the game is still the world circuit, where you must compete against six other riders in circuits consisting of three runs down the same hill. As you win bronze, silver, or gold medals in each circuit, new tracks and boards are unlocked and attribute points are awarded to enhance the abilities of your rider. Unlike last year's game, where the third and final race in each circuit was much more difficult than the prior two, the AI has been refined so that the difficulty for each race gradually builds to a crescendo for the final run.\n\nThe biggest change SSX Tricky makes to the series is the improvement of its trick system. Like in the PlayStation 2 version, pulling off various grabs, flips, and spins is accomplished by pressing combinations of the shoulder buttons and the directional pad. This was no problem in the PlayStation 2 version thanks to the Dual Shock 2's four easy-to-use shoulder buttons, but using the GameCube's stiff Z button for tricks takes some getting used to.\n\nThe tracks may be lengthy and full of hidden shortcuts, but the real star of the SSX Tricky show is the animation. Regardless of whether you're pulling a simple method or one of the game's astounding uber tricks, the riders animate with a fluidity that few sports games can match. It goes a long way toward making what are impossible moves not only look good, but also plausible in the real world. The gameplay is hectic, the new trick system adds substantial depth, and the overall production is top-notch. If you're looking for a snowboarding game for your GameCube, it's hard to go wrong with SSX Tricky\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)​\n\n1. Wave Race: Blue Storm\n\nNintendo, Nintendo, 2001, 4 Players.\n\nThe title of the game Wave Race: Blue Storm almost encapsulates the ideas behind the gameplay. Racing atop a bed of dynamically changing waves, gamers must navigate their way through eight different environments under random weather conditions, including the powerful Storm setting. The concept is simple; it is the execution behind these ideas that makes Blue Storm a knockout title.\n\nEach setting is unique, often for each course, and dynamically affects visibility, wave height, and water level. Lowered visibility of course makes maneuvering around buoys more difficult, increased wave height demands more cautious control, and changing water levels reveal secret shortcuts or harder track layouts. For example, in Aspen Lake, brother to Drake Lake from Wave Race 64, a calm day's water level exposes large rocks and even a shortcut under a dock. During a rainy day a higher water level covers up all but the smooth tops of the large boulders that litter the lake, which would otherwise be dangerous obstacles. Even more impressive is that weather changes over the course of your three laps. A race might begin under heavy rain but clear to a drizzle. In turn new strategies must be formed with each new lap depending on the water level. Wave height varies from one to nine feet depending on conditions. As with the original, you can use the waves to launch your craft over obstacles and dive through larger waves to cut down lap times.\n\nControlling your racer and taming the waves is the whole challenge behind Blue Storm, a challenge that requires persistence and skill. Every bump, rise, and swell of the waves affects your watercraft. Even on a calm day, ripples from a small waterfall can push you away from a buoy. From a user standpoint controls take a while to master.\n\nOnce you begin to explore the control scheme you can really see just how deep the game gets. There are a lot of subtleties that I think will go unappreciated by less patient critics. However, if you put effort into it and beat the learning curve, you are rewarded with an extremely deep gameplay experience.\n\nPlain and simple, Blue Storm is the definitive \"wave racer.\"​\n\nRPGs:\n\nIncludes tactical rpgs also and roguelikes.​\n\n10. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\n\nThe Game Designers Studio, Nintendo, 2003, 4 Players\n\nCrystal Chronicles is a hack-and-slash action RPG that in some ways has more in common with dungeon crawls like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Diablo than it does with its own namesake. It's a decidedly Japanese-flavored take on this style of gaming that contains some truly bizarre elements and one of the most unique (and slightly off-putting) multiplayer implementations we've ever seen. It's not for everyone--but, in the end, Crystal Chronicles can be a tremendously entertaining multiplayer game for those willing to work together to overcome some obstacles both in the game itself and in its design.\n\nCrystal Chronicles' story is novel but also very thin, and ultimately it serves more than anything as an impetus to get you traipsing and fighting through the game's fanciful world.\n\nMuch ballyhoo has been made about Crystal Chronicles' rather unique multiplayer setup, which (as you may have heard) requires all players to use a Game Boy Advance and link cable to play the game. That's right--you cannot play this game's multiplayer mode without every player owning and using a game system other than the one the game is running on.\n\nThe utter calamity that results from getting all the people and hardware required to play this game together in one room: Priceless. Of course you're free to play through the entire thing by yourself, and will likely have a decent enough time doing it, but this sort of game is really made to be played cooperatively with friends--not to mention there's a raft of puzzles and areas you simply can't access on your own.\n\nThe saving grace of this plot-to-sell-GBAs-cum-multiplayer-\"feature\" is that Crystal Chronicles is a ton of fun to play with your friends.\n\nSo if you're into action RPGs and you like cooperative multiplayer games, you must be asking if you should get this game. Well, that really becomes a question of resources. If you have two, or better yet three, friends with the requisite hardware and the interest and will to learn how the game works, then yes, Crystal Chronicles will definitely tickle your fancy. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles really is a fun action RPG with its own style and a fair amount of replay value.​\n\nFull Review (Gamespot)\n\n7. Pokemon Colosseum\n\nGenius Sonority, Nintendo, 2003, 4 Players.\n\nSince the game puts players in the role of an established Pokemon trainer instead of starting a Trainer career from scratch like the Game Boy adventures, Pokemon Colosseum assumes one already knows what they're getting into, and have at least some idea to what's expected in a Pokemon adventure.\n\nThough the RPG follows most of the rules and gameplay established in the Pokemon RPG series up to this point, Pokemon Colosseum brings forth a new element: Shadow Pokemon. Shadow Pokemon are essentially \"abused\" Pokemon creatures, noted by the writers as \"Pokemon with the doors to their heart closed.\" The Shadow Pokemon are the foundation to the GameCube adventure's quest and storyline, as well as the gameplay itself.\n\nSee, unlike the Game Boy RPG, in the GameCube game players don't wander around the wilderness to build up their own collection. In this adventure, players will encounter in battle a trainer who has a Shadow Pokemon in his party, and when it arrives players can attempt to snag it in battle; the same rules apply to catch one, though, so players will have to work to weaken a Shadow Pokemon and use an appropriate Pokeball to snag it.\n\nSince the Shadow Pokemon remain Shadow Pokemon in one's party, players will have to use it in battle to weaken the \"door to its heart\" in order to convert it to a normal Pokemon status.\n\nIt's clear that the designers limited the direction of the GameCube's quest so as not to overshadow the Game Boy Advance design; if you want the full Pokemon experience, you're going to need a GBA system. But even with the lack of gameplay variety in its quest, Pokemon Colosseum is one hugely challenging game, and it has enough originality, not to mention a whole assortment uniquely catchable creatures, in its design to encourage both newbies and veterans alike to experience a new style of Pokemon adventure.​\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n7. Custom Robo (Custom Robo Battle Revolution)\n\nNoise, Nintendo 2003, 4 Players.\n\nCustom Robo is a popular and long-running series in Japan. It's a mecha game for the Myron Reducto set -- these robots aren't giant as per the norm, they're actually only a few centimeters tall, and fight each other in tiny worlds called holosseums. But thanks to the huge amount of customization options, this game offers much more depth of gameplay than what's found in your average fighting game.\n\nThe tedium comes from story mode. Enduring story mode will build up your stable of parts. A robo's parts consist of a body, legs, and three weapons: a gun, a bomb, and a pod. Each part type has five different stats, some of which are common across types. A body is rated for attack power, defensive power, how easy it is to knock down, how fast it moves while running, and its agility in the air.\n\nWhat really creates the depth in the game, though, are the variations between individual parts themselves. The differences between the multiple, non-homing, high-speed shots of the gatling gun, the powerful, short-range shotgun, and the long-range, single shot, slow-moving dragon gun create a wide variety of tactics options. And those are just three of the fifty-two guns available! With the addition of thirty-four different bodies, sixteen leg types, forty-four bomb types, and forty-four pods, each with fairly distinct behavior, it can take a long time for you to find what parts complement both each other and your play style.\n\nAs such, this isn't a casual game. It really doesn't even have the casual appeal of Soul Calibur II, much less Super Smash Bros. Melee. If you're a fighting game fanatic, it's a title that you could play for a long, long time. It ranks with Virtua Fighter 4 in terms of depth, maybe even surpassing it on some level. Thus, it's not really much of a party game unless you're all experienced. You should really have a fellow fanatic to play regularly with to get the most out of the game, which may rule it out for some.For the hardcore, there is no better fighting game on the GameCube.​\n\nFull Review (Game Spy)\n\n7. Baten Katos Origins\n\ntri-Crescendo/ Monolith Soft, Nintendo, 2006, 1 Player.\n\nWhen it boils down to the basics, Baten Kaitos is a card game with some seriously impressive polish, and much like the original game players will build up decks, find new cards, and do battle against baddies making use of their custom-made collection. As a bit of a change, however, Origins has actually simplified the design, taking out the ability to equip armor or accessories outside of battle. Instead, all magnus are used either for key moments in the game (as solutions to puzzles gathered from virtually anywhere in the overworld), or as \"battle magnus\" which can be comprised of attack cards, spells, equipment, or attribute boosters.\n\nTo keep things simplistic and user-friendly, each character resets to full health and default attributes after a battle, so each bout is self-contained. The lack of multiple magnus classifications will be a bit too simplistic for some hardcore players, but the overall change was for the better, as gamers can worry about each battle as it happens, rather than being paranoid about wasting key items or equipment. If you find the card, it's yours until you swap it out for something better.\n\nIn fact, nearly every element of Baten Kaitos Origins needs to be handled on a player-to-player basis, as the game is so incredibly niche. You'll either love it or hate it, and the game won't make apologies for what it is. Battles can be amazingly simplistic or entirely ruthless depending on what cards come up, and a good player could take as much time customizing his deck as he does actually exploring the overworld to gain experience. The game is extremely open-ended in comparison to the original, as players can use an air ship to move from world to world, take on fetch quests or \"beat the boss\" missions to gain new magnus and experience, or simply force their way though the game as fast as possible. Be warned, however, as the game will expect you to do at least a fair amount of nonlinear exploration in order to beef up for fights, and there are a few areas where we regretted skipping over \"boring\" fetch quests, taking dozens of attempts to beat bosses that, quite frankly, were out of our league. Baten Kaitos is a game that demands coherent players, and has no problem kicking ass when it wants to.\n\nThis is a game that doesn't come down to a simple \"buy it/don't buy it\" conclusion, as it is entirely dependant on what type of player you are. Traditional RPG fans may not get as much out of this one as they would if it was more conventional, while veterans to the series (or newcomers that love the battle mechanic) will defend it to the bitter end. When comparing it to its predecessor, Origins does the series justice.​\n\nFull Review (IGN)\n\n6. Phantasy Star\n\nSonic Team, Sega, 2002, 4 Players.\n\nPhantasy Star Online Episode I & II is an online role-playing game that takes elements of the previous Dreamcast versions and expands upon them. It's not an entirely new game, but Sonic Team, the developer, likes to think of it that way; Episode I is a slightly tweaked and upgrade version of Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Online Version 2, and Episode II is completely new, designed for the GameCube release. For those not familiar with the series, PSO is a leaving, breathing world, a futuristic paradise that gamers with Internet access can escape to. With a few catastrophes and twists, there's enough to reason to feel compelled to explore the dangerous worlds before you, but mostly, as the name of the series indicates, this is an online game. After experiencing it ourselves, there's no question that PSO is only worthwhile if you can enjoy the online community.\n\nThe whole process of playing PSO begins with creation your character. You can choose from a total of 12 different character types that fall under three character classes: Hunter, Ranger, and Force. Once you create your perceived self in the world of Phantasy Star, things become very interesting. The dynamics of your ability to use items, weapons, and magic are readily apparent when you team up with other players in the online world. Hunters will have to look danger in the face and provide hand-to-hand combat support, while Rangers will have to sync up attacks from afar. The fighting engine is completely real-time, as it would be in a real world.\n\nCommunity is what makes PSO a worthy investment. Without it, it may still be a better than average RPG with real-time battle mechanics, but it will lose its sweetness very quickly. A final feature worth mentioning is the all-new inclusion of split-screen multiplayer for offline use. No you can't play splitscreen with a friend in the online world, but you can when you're not connected via the Internet.\n\nOnline, I can tell you, the experience is completely different and the sense of being in a whole new world shines through brilliantly. This is where PSO becomes addictive and rewarding. The options are many, ranging from having experts help you learn to teaching lower-level beginners the tricks you've picked up.\n\nFull Review (IGN)​\n\n5. Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness\n\nGenius Sonority, Nintendo, 2005, 4 Players\n\nLike Colosseum, Pokemon XD starts out with an impressive introduction that sets the overall mood for the storyline that follows -- a dynamic scene of a ship at sea being hijacked by a mysterious Lugia creature. The adventure that follows isn't quite as energetic as the scenario that introduces it, but for those already familiar with the battle-based, exploration gameplay of a usual Pokemon adventure it fits the series. The same \"wander around, battle Pokemon vs. Pokemon\" gameplay is the core to the Pokemon XD, with the occasional crate-pushing, switch-flipping puzzle mechanics to spice-up the action.\n\nIt would be unfair to say that the whole game is a repeat, because there have been some improvements. On the visual side, the game improves the detail of the graphic engine by providing a bit more shading, lighting and shadowing on the characters, creatures and environments, all the while retaining the same 30 frames per second animation players experienced in the last game. A few new abilities have been added to the gameplay, such as the opportunity to catch Pokemon not "
