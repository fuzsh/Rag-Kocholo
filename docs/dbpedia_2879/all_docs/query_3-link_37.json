        "text": "Beyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition for Nintendo Switch is a special edition released by Ubisoft to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the acclaimed action-adventure game Beyond Good & Evil.\n\nThis version features major graphical, audio, and control improvements promising to deliver the best gameplay experience across platforms. It also adds many new functions to optimize the gameplay such as Autosave, Skip Cutscene, full controller and mouse & keyboard support, and cross-save across all platforms.\n\nNot only that, Ubisoft introduces a Speedrun mode to challenge the skills of the gaming community, adds 20 new Achievement rewards, and an Anniversary Gallery section to explore more about the game’s development process.\n\nFor those unaware, Beyond Good and Evil is an entertaining action-adventure game that tells the story of Jade’s journey – a journalist investigating the alien invasion of the DomZ on the planet Hillys. This anniversary edition has added an entirely new quest revealing more about Jade’s past as well as the connection between this part and Beyond Good & Evil 2."
