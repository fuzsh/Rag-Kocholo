        "text": "In Beyond Good & Evil 2, the prequel to the 2003 game, players will encounter a young, ferocious version of heroine Jade. Ubisoft dropped a new trailer today showing off the game’s gorgeous, epic space vibes, featuring surprise appearances from several familiar faces.\n\nUbisoft is also partnering with Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s company HitRECord to help crowdsource different aspects of the game, for the game, from poster designs and radio ads to music.\n\nNo word yet on when the action-adventure RPG will launch, though as of last year it was still very early in development. It’ll deviate from the more linear version of the original, however, offering players the chance to play alone or with friends in co-op."
