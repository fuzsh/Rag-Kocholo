        "text": "Ubisoft has acknowledged the leak of their new Beyond Good & Evil remaster but insisted it was only an early build.\n\nThe truth behind the Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is stranger than initially realised, as it wasn’t a result of someone accidentally setting something live before The Game Awards, it was ‘an early development version.’\n\nHow that got anywhere near a public store is a mystery but not only is it not going to be at The Game Awards, it’s not going to be released until next year – which means that technically it will miss the 20th anniversary.\n\nIt also implies that there’s probably no plans to feature Beyond Good And Evil 2 at The Game Awards, as Ubisoft’s tweets suggest that the Anniversary Edition won’t be officially announced until 2024.\n\nThat explains why the graphics were less impress than fans were hoping for but it also seems to imply that the game is closer to a remake than a remaster.\n\nUbisoft don’t use either name to describe it though, so at this stage it’s not entirely clear what it is.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nThere’s still no word on the constantly delayed sequel but Ubisoft at least has an upcoming announcement about the original Beyond Good & Evil.\n\nThe safe bet would be say that Beyond Good And Evil 2 is never going to be released. It was first announced in 2008, as something that seemed to be a direct continuation of the original, and then re-announced in 2017 as a prequel that seemed to have nothing in common with the first game in terms of either characters or gameplay.\n\nAfter series creator Michel Ancel left Ubisoft in 2020 it seemed like the sequel was doomed to be cancelled but, much like Skull And Bones, it’s hobbled on and now proof has emerged that Ubisoft is going to celebrate the franchise’s 20th anniversary.\n\nA Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition was already mentioned on an age rating board listing in August but this time the game itself turned up on the Xbox Store and was actually available to play for a short time, via the Ubisoft+ service.\n\nThere was also a trailer, which has since been taken down, and Ubisoft has been removing copies all morning, which suggests the reveal is not imminent. Instead, it’s likely it was intended to take place at The Game Awards next Thursday.\n\nIt seems it will be a shadow drop at that time, perhaps as a means to promote the sequel, which will hopefully get a new trailer – although that’s just speculation at this point.\n\n‘Embark on this epic adventure in up to 4K and 60 fps with improved graphics, controls, and audio, along with brand-new autosave and cross-save features,’ read the original listing.\n\n‘Enjoy exclusive new rewards as you explore the planet and discover more about Jade’s past in a new treasure hunt throughout Hillys.\n\n‘Put your skills to the test thanks to the new speedrun mode and updated achievements, and learn more about the game’s development and secrets in the anniversary gallery.’\n\nThe game already had a full HD remaster in 2011 but this seems to be a completely new version, with fans already arguing over whether it’s an improvement or not.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that The Game Awards is when it was meant to be unveiled but either way it’s clearly imminent.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\nMORE : Skull & Bones and Beyond Good And Evil 2 updates reveal troubled development\n\nMORE : Jade returns in new Beyond Good & Evil 2 trailer – announce Joseph Gordon-Levitt collaboration\n\nMORE : New Beyond Good And Evil 2 update still doesn’t mention a release date\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.uk\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader’s Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page."
