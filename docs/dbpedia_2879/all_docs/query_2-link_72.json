        "text": "Welcome to Hillys The Black Isle ... Of Death Welcome to IRIS The Factory ... Of Death Jumpin' Jade Flash Slaughterhouse ... Of Death Exploring Hillys To The Moon And Back\n\nWalkthrough - To The Moon & Back\n\nWith the spaceship, it's quite easy to go from one place to the next. Be sure to explore all of Hillys, since once you get to a certain point of progress on the next mission, you won't be comin' back to the planet at all. You can go and buy the space engine with no problem, but know that once you start pulling switches and solving mysteries on the moon, Jade-Shauni-Photowoman may be stuck there forever (game-wise).\n\nWhen you're ready, buy the space engine.\n\nThis is a neat thing (one some of us would like to see in future planet-spanning adventure games). Buy the engine, install it, and jet up to the Hillyan stratosphere. Once there, press item use on the space engine to go into orbit. From there on out, there's the moon and there's Hillys. While you're in space, don't forget to snap the photo of the big ass space whale. Shoot the ice off to take its picture before the ice chunks kill you.\n\nHead for the moon.\n\nThat should be obvious. You can buy the PA-1 at the docking port as well. It will probably be the last one if you've explored the game to its fullest. Again, keep all PA-1s with Jade-Shauni-Photowoman. No one else will need it. Although you can do it later, you can also move the bridge to the transmitter control room now to save time later.\n\nClimb the large object to the box on the crane. Hang on it and have the soldier push the switch. Land on the Thia'ar spaceship and hand on the other box. The switch to control this box is across the chasm. Use a gyrodisc then hang on. Once across, turn the dial switch and you'll have access to the transmitter later on. But right now, head to the two switch elevator to the Dom-Z base.\n\nStep on the lift to the Dom-Z Base\n\nThere're no enemies in the base, but some puzzles to solve. Grab the focus mirror first off and use it on the broken stalk. Focus the beam of light on the door where the lift is for a second mirror, then open the door that leads deeper into the base. The next set of mirrors are on spinners. Gyrodisc the two nearest the light beam to shoot the beam straight down the long hallway into the inner chamber.\n\nManuever the light beam to strike all the crystals in each wall at once to lower that wall. The walls are easy - if you set up the pole correctly, the second and third only requires a slight change in the first pole's beam to hit the smaller circles. If you've ever drawn a five-pointed star with one line as a kid, that's how you do it. At this point, you can save (you can still go back to Hillys), but here's the warning you've been waiting for - once you take a mission photo in the next area after the crystal-lightbeam stasis cell puzzle, you cannot go back to Hillys for the rest of the game. Make sure you have done all you want to do on Hillys before proceeding to the end.\n\nWall #1\n\nWall #2\n\nWall #3. A good thing to do is to buy 50 or more K-bups and 50 or more Sets of PODs for the upcoming boss fights before you proceed onward (our game has 99 K-Bups and about 40 Sets of PODs). With all the credits on that Easy Unit card, this shouldn't be difficult to arrange. The best mix is to have a few K-Bups (you can get by with less than 10 if you 'know what you doing') but the spaceship fight is actually the grueling one - take about 30 Sets of PODs or more. Our game has about 30,000 cees at this point (not buying the pearl detector and the crappy super attack will add more cash to your Easy Unit Card) so money should be no object.\n\nThere's No Going Back Now\n\nSqueeze past the glass door and head to the next area. Incredibly, there's two guards at the far end of the teleporter. Gyrodisc these last two goons and send them to chlorine hell. Head to the teleporter and appear in what seems to be a teleporter maze. Not really. Just aim for the green teleporter and take the mission photo at the end. Then backtrack to the deep blue teleporter and head back outside. Some bee-ess occurs, and Jade-Shauni-Photowoman can take the pig and soldier to the transmitter.\n\nClimb the large object to the box on the crane. Hang on it and have the soldier push the switch. Land on the Thia'ar spaceship and hand on the other box. The switch to control this box is across the chasm. Use a gyrodisc then hang on. Once across, turn the dial switch and you'll have access to the transmitter later on. But right now, head to the two switch elevator to the Dom-Z base.\n\nBroadcast and escape to the spaceship under 00:01:30\n\nYou may want to save (especially, if you're in good health). Take the tram to the transmitter and engage in some non-interactive movies. Then raace back to the lift and take off in the Thia'ar spaceship under time. Escape in the shipship and you'll have a vehicle boss fight for a bit. This boss basically pulls the spaceship along and fires missiles (that do two points of damage) and laser barriers (which do one point of damage). Use the homing shot to fry the red spots on the ship and homing shot the center laser array after it fire.\n\nThe patterns of the laser barriers, missiles, and indestructable Tesla field change, but there's enough room at the edge of the screen and the outer edge of the boss for Jade-Shauni-Photowoman's spaceship to squeeze past. Restart as many times as you think you need to, and use a POD or whatever to regain vehicle health. After this boss, there's a save point.\n\nKill the machine spider boss and head inside it.\n\nLooks like you won't be saving just yet. The large sea mine deployed at the entrance of the spider boss contraption is indestructable except for the small homing mines that are launched. Drop the hovercraft and use its speed and jumping ability to destroy the large sea mine blocking the dock. Do that, dock and Jade-Shauni-Photowoman can save.\n\nGo inside the boss' wreckage and kill the guards (should be easy). Take the lift up, engage in some last rites bee-ess, and turn off the tractor beam. Go back outside and - this is the last save in the game. Take the spaceship and head for the lunar base. Engage the Dom-Z fighters for thirty seconds (it helps to kill some) and soon, the coast should be clear for the spaceship to land (the white plast-alloy structure in the middle of the base). Land the ship and head for the teleporter for the last boss.\n\nFight Last Boss.\n\nThe final boss attacks in several phases. The first phase is just killing regular Sarcophogi (last chance to photograph them probably), then whacking the boss if it appears. After the pig gets schlurped, have the soldier hammer pound the phantoms so Jade-Shauni-Photowoman can bat them past the crystal wall and into the boss.\n\nBoy that was easy. The next few phases involve hiding behind the soldier when the boss fires its sterilisation beam at Jade-Shauni-Photowoman. Use this time to gyrodisc the boss quickly (and once) before moving on. When the soldier is schlurped, kill the phantoms and get ready for the hardest phase of the last boss (of which some no-talent ass clowns could not pass).\n\nIf you die, there are two checkpoints in this battle, so see what happens by using your next life to get the timing down for the attacks before committing tons of food to a lost cause.\n\nThe boss will teleport and attack one-half second after it appears - this gives you one-half second to react and attack the boss before Jade-Shauni-Photowoman gets shredded. Attack the boss and it will teleport to another spot on the same level as Jade. When the boss appears above her, it's time to shoot-dodge. Instead of attacking, press shoot-dodge to get out of the way and attack the boss immediately after it misses with its own attack. Once that is done, the last boss will reverse your left joystick controls and do the same attack.\n\nAlternately, you can press and hold attack and charge Jade-Shauni-Photowoman's super attack and hit the boss like so -- this is actually how UbiSoft \"planned\" for players to beat this boss, but you will have to remember where the boss teleports to if you miss. The boss will go to the same spot every time you screw up (and get hit) so you will need to remember how many times the boss appears to Jade-Shauni-Photowoman's sides before it appears above her to time the charge attack.\n\nIf you die, there are two checkpoints in this battle, so see what happens by using your next life to get the timing down for the attacks before committing tons of food to a lost cause.\n\nDuring reverse controls, all you need to remember is to push the stick in the opposite direction to where the boss appears. If you understand this, you've beaten the game (and used some K-Bups in the process no doubt). Again, only shoot-dodge when the boss appears right above Jade-Shauni-Photowoman. Stick that lightsaber-toothpick through the boss' huge squishy eye and you'll be finished with the game."
