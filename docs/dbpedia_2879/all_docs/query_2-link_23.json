        "text": "Okay, a rare occasion for me...but I am simply stuck in this awesome game!\n\nAfter finally doing research online and getting some cheats to help me get past the Central Hall bug in the PC version of this...I am now stuck in the East Wing.\n\nThis is the part where you walk across a catwalk and go down a ladder on the left hand side. There are three guards total in this room. One just ahead of where the ladder drops you off, and 2 others on a lower area at the back. One is turning in 3 directions to guard what I assume is my exit. The other just walks a very short partol between this guard, and and the transparent blue columns. There is also a security droid that hovers at the back just outta site that is deactivated. I have managed to use the boxes and columns to sneak all the way up to the guard who is standing in front of the entrance. But I can't sneak past him. He always detects me just as I pass him. He sounds the alarm, which then turns on red laser beams to close off the exit and then I have 3 guards trying to kill me at once. And of course...they activate the droid that targets me and gets me in one shot.\n\nWhat the heck am I doing wrong in this room? I also noticed just to the left of the ladder you drop from, there appears to be another door. Next to it is a lever. But I have approached it several times and the game never seems to register an action for that lever. I even jump into camera mode and zoom in on that lever, but the game never brackets it to give me information on it like it will for other equipment.\n\nI have struggling trying to get past this part for literally several hours and finally the frustration won me over so I called it a night.\n\nany ideas? What is the proper strategy to get past this? I know attacking the gaurds can't be right since you can't take down the droid and it will take you out with one shot. So sneaking has to be the answer....but how?\n\nWell I don't know if its anything like the Cube version but I assume it is.\n\nI think in that room, your best bet is stealth and sneaking. You can sneak right behind and almost next to the guards if you time it right. I can remember hanging there off that platform until the boss in the distance turns his back to Jade; then I dropped off and scrunched down and came towards \"you\" (erm, down ) and then snuck from point to point. You can move your camera around while ducking and hiding and watch the guards -- just keep down and sneak from hiding place to hiding place when it feels right.\n\nHey have you put any of your internet codes in at Ubi.com, Cafeman? If you do there is a mission you can get to in the Akuda Bar. You know that case/locker next to Francis' airhockey table? There's a mission on Ubi that gives you the password to that locker. I've gotten 2 different passwords, but I can't get to the locker , because my saves are all on Selene and you can't go back to the planet from there. (or else I just haven't figured it out yet)\n\nI'm going to try playing again and trying loading up a code while I am still on the planet to try to get to it. I'm not sure how far you have to be in the game, before you can get the mission, but I know the password is different for each save.\n\nI want to tell you both THANKS!!!\n\nI finally figured out what I was doing wrong..\n\nYou were right on how to get past that part. You just sneak all the way through. What I was doing wrong, I think..it either touching the Alpha sector dude guarding the doorway...or not getting past him quick enough before he turns in my direction again.\n\nEither way you guys were spot on...and the sad thing is...after reading what you said...and finally getting back to trying it again this weekend...I did it on my first try.\n\nI am now quite a bit further...I just got the Baluga repaired..and have been told to get to the moon. Now I am on the quest to get those 30 pearls!!! I only have 6 so this will take a while. I snagged what I could from the Hillys city...but not sure where others are to be had. Any ideas?\n\nExcellent game and I am tempted to pick it up for the Cube when it gets even cheaper than the 19.99 price point it is at now. I have the PC version, but it is sooooo full of bugs that it almost isn't fun to play in some parts due to frustration.\n\nSince neither of you have the PC version...I will tell you that this game is the first game I have had to get a Cheat for...just to get around a bug in the game.\n\nThe PC version has a nasty bug where in the central Hall, after defeating the 3 robots that drop down...a second triangle key card falls from the same place or is actually supposed to fall from the last robot killed. However, in the PC version, what actually happens is that the key card tries to fall in the center of the room. In the process, it actually gets \"Stuck\" in the ramps that came down from which the robots fell from. But the ramps pop back up after the drop out. Well, the key is stuck up there. If you press the button to release more robots, the key doesn't fall still and is just Stuck. This make it impossible to get past this part since you can't ever give the second key to Double HH and get the door open.\n\nI had to use both a save game editor, and another fix that some fan created that gets past this. Ubi themselves have not provided any sort of fix for this. Very irritating. I understand the console versions don't suffer these bugs and that of the 3 avail. The Xbox is the best looking..but the Cube is the next best thing to the PC and Xbox versions. So, the Cube version I will have to get I suspect.\n\nThanks again for the assist guys, and Cafeman...get away from the controller..and get back to coding that Adventure II!!!...hehe"
