        "text": "We discovered yesterday that the long-awaited Beyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition will be launching on the Nintendo Switch and other platforms next week on 25th June. Today, it has emerged that the remaster of the game will feature an exclusive new mission which reveals a narrative link to the previously presumed dead, Beyond Good & Evil 2. When we will see a new trailer for Beyond Good & Evil 2 is anyone’s guess, but journalist Tom Henderson recently said that Ubisoft has had one ready for at least a year.\n\n“Beyond Good & Evil follows reporter Jade as she investigates the DomZ alien attack in the world of\n\nHillys. Allies like her adoptive uncle Pey’j and Double H support her in accomplishing this objective. Alongside learning more about her past, Jade will combat various creatures, solve puzzles, play\n\nminigames, and take photos with her camera on hand. There will also be an exclusive new mission revealing a narrative link to Beyond Good & Evil 2.”\n\nVia"
