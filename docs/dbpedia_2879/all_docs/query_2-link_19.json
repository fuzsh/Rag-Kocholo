Once again, the most reliable Ubisoft leaker is Ubisoft.\n\nJun 20, 2024\n\n#12\n\n.... why wouldn't they put this in Ubi Forward?\n\nBecause Ubi Soft loves going backwards.\n\nBut seriously, never played BG&E, so maybe now is my time to experience this cult classic?\n\nEarthbounder\n\nBoing!\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nJun 20, 2024\n\n#14\n\nUh, what happened to the tweet?\n\nRelease delayed to June 25th, 2025.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil fans can't catch a break.\n\nJun 20, 2024\n\n#15\n\nLooks nice.

Having BG&E on a handheld would be pretty great, but 4k60 on my PS5 is also very tempting for a game like this. Fingers crossed that the new orchestrated soundtrack ends up being as good or better than the stellar original.\n\nSuch a shame that we'll likely never get the sequel(s) that this game deserved, but I'm all for revisiting this all-timer in an enhanced release.\n\nEarthbounder\n\nBoing!\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nJun 20, 2024\n\n#20\n\nI wonder what the new content will be.

This only makes me more angry at the follow-ups. Every attempt to make a sequel has gone reboot/prequel direction, when a decent chunk of what makes the game special is Jade/Pey'j and the backstory.

Got it for Switch. I only just finished the intro and haven't grabbed her camera yet so my knowledge is limited on how the rest of the game looks or performs. It tries to hit *30 but can dip sometimes, during gameplay I noticed zero dips but only during a camera pan in a cutscene it did. It seems to hit 720p in handheld with some form of aliasing to help fend off most jagged edges. Texture quality seems mixed, in some places it makes me wonder if they're worse than the GC original. But overall it uses all the new lighting and models they've shown off so far so I'm liking the way it's all presented here, seems like a great port so far!\n\nEdit: *Initially I mentioned it hit 60fps but I guess that was my tired eyes from last night misinterpreting it! It does appear to be 30, sorry for misleading anyone.\n\nLast edited: Jun 24, 2024\n\nbashfluff\n\nPiranha Plant\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/him\n\nJun 24, 2024\n\n#33\n\nThis is a very good game, and if you haven't played it, I encourage you to do so.

It seems to be 30 fps and still has drops, and also doesn't hit 1080p. It seems to struggle the most with particle effects and the like.\n\nEarthbounder\n\nBoing!\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nJun 24, 2024\n\n#44\n\n20 bucks?

Performance wise, besides some drops during some of the effects work due to the nature of the engine, it's a solid conversion, and runs mostly at 30fps. Resolution wise, I don't recall him mentioning anything, but I would imagine it's 720p handheld/1080p docked."
