Originally, Beyond Good and Evil 2 was said to take place before Jade was born, but instead a “ferocious young Jade” will appear in the game’s storyline.\n\nThe long-awaited follow-up to Ubisoft’s critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful 2003 action-adventure-photography game made its last appearance at Ubisoft’s E3 conference last year.\n\nIt will actually be a prequel to the events of the first game, in which players will create their own character and explore an open-world outer-space environment. But characters like Jade and pig-friend Pey’j will factor in heavily to the game’s story, its developers said at Ubisoft’s E3 press conference today.\n\nHere’s the cinematic trailer shown at E3, in which Jade shows up.\n\nUbisoft showed a bit of “pre-alpha” gameplay of the still-in-development game, but said that the demo would be “behind closed doors” at E3."
