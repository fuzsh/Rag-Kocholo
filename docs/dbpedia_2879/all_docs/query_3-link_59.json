        "text": "The original Beyond Good and Evil back in 2003 became a cult classic, with fans clamouring for a follow up for years to no avail. The story of the sequel that never came spans from 2008 till late last year, when Michel Ancel, the director of the first game, finally gave the nod that another Beyond Good and Evil game was in development.\n\nUbisoft had first raised hopes in 2008 that Jade and Pey'j, BGE's principle characters, would make a return by releasing a CG trailer featuring the pair to promote BGE2. But after that trailer's release, and a subsequent leak of gameplay footage in 2009, all was silent at Ubisoft for a long, long time. By the middle of the following decade, many had assumed that the game had been permanently canned and would never re-emerge.\n\nThen last year, Michel Ancel made a surprise announcement via Instagram: Beyond Good and Evil was, at very last, back in business.\n\nThe game that Ancel was talking about made a stellar appearance at this year's E3, and it looks a whole lot different from the one we glimpsed back in 2009. The scale, and ambition of Ancel's new Beyond Good and Evil 2 is enormous, and the project is now so dramatically changed that it barely resembles the original game.\n\nWe've gathered all the important information about Beyond Good and Evil 2 in one place, and will be updating this page as new details surface.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 release date: When can we monkey about in space?\n\nAccording to Michel Ancel, Beyond Good and Evil 2 is at \"day zero of development\", and no release date has been hinted at, in spite of the game's showing at E3.\n\nWhy did it take so long to get to this point? Well, Ancel and his team spent an enormous amount of time working on the base tech for his ambitious project.\n\n\"So we waited for three years just working on the technology, so that now you can really travel across space, planets,\" said Ancel during the E3 livestream.\n\nThe game is clearly in its earliest phases, and though Ancel's team has created the tech on which the game will function, it's worlds away from a playable state. For that reason, our best guess is that Beyond Good and Evil 2 won't be with us until 2019 at the earliest.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 platforms: What can I play it on?\n\nThere hasn't, as of yet, been an official announcement about Beyond Good and Evil 2's platforms, but the \"Space Monkey Program\" – Ubisoft's method of keeping fans informed of the game's progress – allows users to select one of three devices: PS4, PC, or Xbox One.\n\nIt looks like Ubisoft is targeting these platforms, with no word yet on whether the game will be coming to Nintendo Switch.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 trailer: How's it looking?\n\nUbisoft's E3 trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2 certainly caught everyone's attention. It's not every day that a major publisher releases wondrous animated sequences about a foul-mouthed monkey stealing from an equally foul-mouthed pig before jaunting off into space.\n\nIt's light-hearted, vibrant, energetic, and seems to carry with it the spirit and tone of the original game, albeit with a few totally unnecessary expletives.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 story: what happened to Jade and Pey'j?\n\nUnfortunately we'll have to wait till another day to find resolution for Jade and Pey'j, the stars of the original Beyond Good and Evil. Ancel's team opted for a prequel, rather than a sequel, knowing that only a small number of its potential audience played the first game.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 takes place well before Jade was born, but Ancel has promised that the characters of the previous game will be honoured in some way.\n\nThe official game description reads as follows:\n\n\"System 3 has become the center of interstellar trade and colonization in the Milky Way of the 24th century, thanks to the creation of Hybrid slaves. While private enterprises fight over resources and power, the first colonists weave together the rich and diverse spiritual and cultural heritages of Old Earth to give meaning to their existence.\n\n\"In this new era of piracy, we will rise from lowly pirate to legendary captain at the helm of massive star-faring vessels, adventuring alongside crews of colorful characters to fight for freedom and the right to determine our own fate among the stars!\"\n\nIn the original game, Jade was determined to seek out and expose injustice, and it sounds like players will be faced with plenty of the same in Beyond Good and Evil 2.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 gameplay: Another straight-up action adventure?\n\nAncel and his team are setting their sights high with Beyond Good and Evil 2, which is a far broader, more expansive project than its predecessor.\n\nWe don't know much about the gameplay mechanics, mostly because the game is so early on in development, but we do know a few key facts. All of this, of course, is subject to change.\n\nSpace, and spaceships ahoy! Beyond Good and Evil featured a few vehicles, but BGE2 spaceships will be key. The game is being pitched as a space pirate adventure: players begin with nothing (Ancel suggests that you may start \"delivering pizzas\"), but slowly earn money to buy bigger and better ships.\n\nIt's going to be BIG: One of the principle reasons the game was delayed according to Ancel is that his team had to generate the scale tech that would let players freely explore rooms, ships, cities, planets, and solar systems, all within the same engine.\n\nAnd we're not talking empty, procedurally generated environments where there's nothing to do, Ancel wants this to be a living and breathing universe full of quests and points of interest, \"but not empty planets. Or not empty, generated, whatever planets.\n\n\"Real planets with cities, logical connection between the cities. And even all the natural events that you could have on these kind of planets, gravity, all the moons, and all these things.\n\n\"We needed to make sure, before coming here today, making sure that we will deliver the game.\"\n\nCheck out this demo from E3 of Ancel showing off the scaleability of the game's engine.\n\n\"You can get out of the Chinese restaurant, jump into your spaceship, go across the atmosphere, and go into your giant spaceship, and then change the planet,\" Ancel said. \"And all this does no loading, and you can be attacked whenever it's happening.\n\n\"It's like GTA but in space, in three dimensions.\"\n\nAccording to Ancel, the entire experience features no loading screens. \"Everything is seamless.\"\n\nYou can customise your character: Though Ancel can be seen playing around with the monkey from the trailer in the above game engine demo, you'll be able to choose your own character in Beyond Good and Evil 2. With a world full of human-animal hybrids to choose from, we're excited to see what options await.\n\nWe're fairly sure that the game will feature platforming and third-person combat, but exactly what form that will take remains unclear."
