        "text": "In late 2023, a leak confirmed that Ubisoft was working on a new version of the original Beyond Good and Evil. Soon after the leak, Ubisoft confirmed that the special version was coming to celebrate the franchise's 20th anniversary, hence being named 20th Anniversary Edition. The developer promised to share more about the new game in early 2024, with a launch following soon after, but up to now, we haven't heard anything about the upcoming game.\n\nAlthough we still don't have any official news about this version, a game titled “Beyond Good and Evil Remastered” has recently been listed by the Korean Game Rating and Administration Committee (via DSOG). Although the name differs, this listing probably refers to the 20th Anniversary Edition announced in November 2023.\n\nFor those who may not know, this committee has a reliable track record regarding game leaks. They were the source that revealed the GTA Trilogy before Take-Two or Rockstar confirmed it. The same thing happened with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered. So, it's safe to say that this rating is legitimate.\n\nLike most remasters, we expect the Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition to feature enhanced visuals and other improvements. This is great news for PC players who enjoyed the original game, especially since its sequel has been in development for quite some time.\n\nDiscuss on our Facebook page, HERE.\n\nKitGuru says: If you didn't play the original Beyond Good and Evil, this remaster is a good chance to try out a cult classic that is still as unique as it was on its launch day."
