        "text": "Jade Empire is the seventh Bioware developed title, published by Microsoft Game Studio and released in 2005 on the Xbox, ported to PC in 2007, and then mobile devices in 2016. It takes place in a fictional world influenced by Chinese culture, history, and mythology melding martial arts, mysticism, and elements of steampunk technology. In place of more traditional Bioware combat there is real-time martial arts action backed by an RPG system. The plot broadly follows the player character, a young martial arts student, chasing down the people responsible for the destruction of their village and the kidnapping of their teacher, Master Li. They and their companions learn that the attack is tied to the very heart of the corrupt empire they live within. This is Bioware’s first RPG with an original intellectual property. In the lineage of the company, it is the intriguing experiment that has not been completely forgotten, but certainly holds far less cache than any other RPG from what many consider the company’s golden era; a period of time with much debated endpoints, but I would argue begins with Baldur’s Gate in 1998 and ends with the release of Mass Effect 3 in 2012. Jade Empire slots into this time span in the transitional period of Bioware where they evolved from beloved PC RPG developers to mainstream hit makers for all platforms. It should come as no surprise that this transitional period was an awkward one. The result is Jade Empire became a necessary stumbling point for Bioware to continue to refine its formula for what would be their entrance into blockbuster status during the seventh generation of consoles.\n\nExpansive Journeys\n\nIn KotOR, the player character travels across the galaxy to a number of planets each with their own distinct stories tying back into the main narrative. In Dragon Age: Origins they journey across the nation of Ferelden, to locations that again, all have their own stories that tie back into the larger narrative. Many of these locations can be tackled in whatever order the player sees fit. With Jade Empire however, there is a rather linear path the whole way through. Though it would appear this was not the original intention.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with IGN, producer Jim Bishop stated, “Early in the game the PC gains access to a flying machine, with which he can travel to the farthest reaches of the Empire. After an introductory chapter the player can complete quests in any order you choose, and we give you lots of choices about where to go. Naturally there is a story arc with a beginning, middle, and end, and at times the story takes over — but we always try to keep control for the story in the player’s hands.“\n\nWhat Bishop describes is a far more typical Bioware design, but the reality of game development often means the final product is never a 1:1 match with the originally intended design.\n\nThe story begins in the small town of Two Rivers and the martial arts school located there, which serves as the tutorial area. The player character, known canonically as the Spirit Monk, is customizable to a degree. While the name and stats can be altered the physical appearance of the seven — four male and three female — cannot be altered. Roughly an hour in, the character of Dawn Star — the childhood friend of the Spirit Monk and first companion — is kidnapped. It’s upon arriving back at the village that the main plot kicks into gear and the monomyth really takes hold. The village has been destroyed, your master kidnapped, and a villainous group to set your sights on has been revealed. Typically at this point a Bioware game would open up. Giving the player a few options of where to head next. Instead, the Spirit Monk and their slowly growing party arrives in another small zone in the wilderness that takes all of 15 minutes to move through and only then do we get to something that resembles a locale comparable to the planets of KotOR. The town of Tien’s Landing is a modest fishing village on the outskirts of the Empire. It acts as a hub for the surrounding zones that you’ll also be visiting. Each spoke of the proverbial wheel that is Tien’s Landing has its own story that ties back into the overall area. For instance the now abandoned portion of the village is littered with the spirits of the dead, and helps to tell the tale of a working class town whose history was forever shifted by an industrialized empire. Tien’s Landing itself is populated with scenic views and a number of side quests that make the little village feel alive with the mundane issues you would find in such a place.\n\nAfter dealing with pirates — that are camped out near the small village and were involved with the attack on Two Rivers — Spirit Monk and their now sizable party of quirky adventurers gain access to an airship. Once more this is not the part where the game opens up, though it’s pretty clear that it was once supposed to. You do receive a map after all, but only one location is available. At any point you can revisit Tien’s Landing, but you’ll likely have little reason to. You don’t even get to see the interior of the ship outside of some pre-rendered cutscenes. Ultimately, the airship only serves as a plot device, and reason to introduce the shmup mini-game. Mini-games are not outside the Bioware formula, Mass Effect is fairly infamous for them, and KotOR places the player in the gunner’s seat of its Millennium Falcon ripoff, the Ebon Hawk. Though the shmup here is rather mundane, with its most notable feature being the odd difficulty spikes. Thankfully, the whole affair is skippable.\n\nUpon arriving at the one available location post Tein’s Landing, Jade Empire’s weakness becomes even more clear. Environmental design makes a huge impact upon the Bioware Formula. After all, becoming invested in a place is made all the easier when the design of it tells a story of its history and the people who currently call it home, or are just passing through. The Imperial City does have a surprising number of people strolling about through the main thoroughfares. You’ll bump into a few unique characters with quests that give off the identity intrinsic to cities. For example, investigating the crimes of slave trader, Chandler Bing… Or you could deal with a European coded traveler voiced by John Cleese. He’s incredibly racist, but at least he’s mostly portrayed as a punching bag in a “humorous” side quest.\n\nWandering the city is an act of exploring homogeneity. Much of it glazed in a dull color palette with little strewn about. It is utterly perplexing that the skyboxes here never give off a sense that the city is bigger than the handful of little areas you get to explore. You never even get to see the palace which allegedly floats above. Despite earlier portions of the game exclaiming the hustle and bustle of the capital, and the proliferation of flyers, you see pretty much nothing outside the landing zone. Districting gives little sense to economic diversity. The main thoroughfare looks relatively well off with a number of nobles out and about. There is only ever the vaguest suggestion that poverty exists.\n\nThe hub and spoke design is present here as well, leading the adventures into the headquarters of the secret police, the Lotus Assassins, and the floating palace itself. This is the last of this design though, and the journey only becomes more linear from here. The final third of the game rockets the player through a handful of smaller, linear locations. With only a few locations mapped out and the in-between hardly ever suggested at, the portrayal of the Empire feels not only small, but unfinished.\n\nA World With History\n\nThis is not a world with deep history. This is a world that barely exists beyond the confines of the main plot and anything relevant to it. Previous Bioware games obviously benefited from having much of their history already written. Baldur’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights had the Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting, Forgotten Realms, created by Ed Greenwood. KotOR has Star Wars. Even being set well before the films, they were able to pull from already written extended universe material. Jade Empire — in its ever unfinished state — fails to bring its world to life in the same way. The foundation of the Empire, the scope, who’s been absorbed by it, what are its internal divides, religious structures, and what exists beyond are hardly discussed. This is a game with an incredibly weak attempt at a codex. Sparsely populating environments with non-diegetic signs that give scraps of information that cannot be read at the player’s leisure within the menus. Upon arrival at the Imperial City, you hear a town crier damning the exploits of an enemy of the state. They’re speaking about the Spirit Monk, but have twisted the events around. For example, the pirates outside of Tien’s Landing who were operating a black market slave trade for the Empire. I of course attacked them and destroyed their operations. The crier frames it as a group of water-faring business men brutally attacked. The crier only speaks of your actions though. As if significant events do not occur outside of the player character’s sphere of influence.\n\nThe Empire isn’t quite a monoculture but the strong cultural divides you would expect to find between people who’ve been absorbed hardly exist. We know it has conquered lands, but all we see is the city and a few small villages whose ways of life feel like they come from the same culture, broadly suggestive of urban vs rural life. There are no ethnic groups, no peculiar little idiosyncrasies specific to how one village handles a topic vs another. There is a made-up language that is used to, as the developers put it, “bring an exotic flavor.” Despite hiring a linguist to write it, they ended up falling back on what they did for alien languages in KotOR. Recording a few random lines of gibberish and slapping them on top of sentences that clearly do not mean the same thing.\n\nWithin the Lotus Assassin compound — which is infiltrated by pretending to be an interested recruit — there is a keeper of knowledge. You can ask them about a handful of subjects surrounding the organization. The first question covers leadership. The keeper tells you that the leader is Death’s Hand who acts as the will of the Emperor and Grand Inquisitor Jia runs the day to day. The Spirit Monk already knows all this because they hear about Death’s Hand constantly. He is framed as the main villain from fairly early on. They’ve also already seen Jia ordering assassins around. The second question is about Master Gang, who is the assassin the Spirit Monk is training under. He’s failed many times and has a rivalry with Master Shin. Already known. Master Gang told the Spirit Monk five minutes ago. You can also ask about the formation of the group. Again, you’ve heard about the emperor’s brother Sun Kin who was the head of the Lotus Monks — the predecessor to the Assassins — until his death. Death’s Hand, who was loyal to the emperor took over and shifted things from monks to assassins. This comes up in several conversations throughout the game with other characters. You can finally ask about the recent campaign. The keeper tells you about the slave trade with the pirates at Tien’s Landing, the attack on Two Rivers, and the capture of Master Li. Further reinforcing this is not a world that exists beyond what is in the player’s orbit.\n\nIn Stray Falls Into the Usual Orientalism Pitfalls of the Cyberpunk Genre by Sisi Jiang, they bring up a similar criticism in regards to the game drawing upon the city of Kowloon for its setting. That aesthetics of southeast Asian cultures are being borrowed into western created media, but often fail to engage with the politics of where those aesthetics come from historically and still exist in.\n\nThe 2000 film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon illustrates an obvious influence on the game and a good point of comparison to Jiang’s piece. Yes, there are characters with names like Jade Fox and there are ponderous philosophies and mysticism in the film. However, its plot is far more grounded and allows its characters and world to be more than the broad tropes that Jade Empire pilfers. Crouching Tiger supplements its wire-fu and mystical setting by making the thematic focus surrounded by the follies of revenge, the place of women in societies dominated by male codes of honor, and the regret fueled by years of inaction. Jade Empire is far grander and more straightforward; a simple story of the hero’s journey to seek out revenge and right the wrongs of those in power. The mysticism, the cliche names, the ancient proverbs, that’s text and “subtext.” When the focus of a narrative pulling from another culture is on the broad features of that culture and its stories, it can become easy to read such as insensitive generalization. At best, so much of Jade Empire reads like a cheap “homage” to Chinese martial arts movies delivered in a less efficient form.\n\nHome Spaces\n\nWhen not out questing, players can return to camp and chat up any companion. It’s the perfect time to take a breath, catch-up with your crew, and maybe learn a little more about them and the world around you. Key to making these spaces feel like a place these people would chat comfortably within is environmental design. I have a lengthy video on the Normandy from Mass Effect that shows just how much work goes into home spaces. Unfortunately, Jade Empire has very little going on in this department. More often than not, your companions stand around gormless without purpose with almost nothing in the environment to expand upon them or the world around you.\n\nThe above is the camp for Tein’s Landing, which is situated slightly outside the village. There is some thought to this. You can initiate a conversation with Dawn Star about camping outside of town and she’ll talk a bit about the situation in the village. With the financial downturn due to trade being cut-off from the river drying up, there aren’t many sleeping options in town and she would rather not put anyone out. When you get back to camp to see them all just standing around in their basic poses in some old ruins with a single fire to symbolize the bare minimum idea of a camp, it leaves a lot to be desired. This remains true with each campsite until at the very last location on the chilly mountain peaks where the Spirit Monk temple is located. Finally a few tents are tossed up, but even then it does little to make it feel truly livable.\n\nBy no means does the proximity of companions increase interactions between them as compared to KotOR. They do happen, many of the big conversations that serve as all hands sort of meetings play out in these spaces. Personalities collide and potential morale quandaries the player may have to face preview themselves. It’s not to the fault of the environment design here that the characters are largely devoid of interesting personalities and motivations. It’s for this reason that the Marvelous Dragonfly — the ship you get at the end of Tien’s Landing — not being the home space is even more frustrating, and just one of the many areas Jade Empire comes out looking underbaked.\n\nSmall Party Combat and Exploration\n\nParty sizes, including the player character, have been variable throughout Bioware’s history. In Baldur’s Gate there can be six total party members roaming about. In all the Mass Effects there are three. Meanwhile, the Dragon Age series has four. I find that there should be at least three. That way you not only have party member’s bouncing off of you, any NPC, and the environment, but each other. It’s important to have that last bit to best flesh out the dynamic within the overall group. Jade Empire allows two. Despite the fact that they still chime in regarding your surroundings or quests, those that travel with you may not speak for so long that the journey can feel lonesome. There are few moments when thinking of companions who might be interesting to bring along to a certain locale given their knowledge or history with it. This is partly because so much of this world feels like it has no history and thus the people in it don’t either. For example, if you were to bring Henpecked Hou around the city in hopes of bumping into his wife that he loathes in the style of a 1950’s sitcom character, well, maybe it’s for the best that doesn’t happen…\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, exploration is rather limited and as the game progresses the world’s beauty regresses. In the G4 making of documentary art director Matt Goldman spoke about the usage of sweeping vistas to help identify where you are in the world so the player could navigate without having to use the map. This does not work out. Instead, outside of Tien’s Landing the vistas are largely devoid of any detail. Now, ambition meeting reality is a common thing in development, but given the lush images shown while he’s speaking, clearly the actual skyboxes fall short of even being eye-catching.\n\nFor no reason would I suggest someone play Jade Empire on console if they can avoid it, but I think we can better understand the issues with the world design when taking the following into consideration. Darrah was a lead programmer on Jade Empire. In his video, Memories and Lessons- Jade Empire & Neverwinter Nights, he remarks about the technical troubles of development. The game pushes the Aurora engine more than KotOR had. Using a PC centric engine on Xbox led to issues with memory.\n\n“We didn’t have the best control over our memory, and levels had a tendency to leak memory as they went.” The solution as Darrah puts it “every single time you do an area transition (it) reboots the entire Xbox and then loads a save game in the area you have entered.” As Darrah points out, this is the source of the long load times.\n\nMuch of the management typical to an RPG is not present here. There is no equipment for companions. There is little for your character either. You have zero control on companion appearances or leveling. In combat you can set them to an attack or support role, neither makes them feel like more than someone else for the enemy to aggro besides you. As you might surmise, there is little loot to be found. Money exists to spend on training in new styles or purchasing gems for a medallion that modifies only the Spirit Monk’s stats. There is plenty of both, but the gems largely lean on slight number modifications to stats rather than unlocking different abilities. You simply need to hit sort by strongest and then swap the most advantageous in and out when you get some new gems.\n\nFighting styles have all sorts of ideas behind them. From basic melee forms, weapons, and styles that serve to sap the chi of an opponent. I had little issue making my chi and focus bars so large that combat became trivial though. Chi essentially is a mana pool that dictates how much you can use certain combat styles, such as elementals and transformations. Focus dictates the same for weapons and how long you can slow down time. I had both high enough that my strategy became shouting “Toad demon form” at the start of combat then proceeding to turn into a giant toad who runs around like The Flash. Knocking out all but the most powerful enemies in a few flipper swipes. Cranking things up too hard offers no relief as it merely makes the numbers more lopsided in the enemy’s favor in the most basic and boring way that difficulty is adjusted in games. When it does get though, it’s not because something interesting happens, but rather the game has stretches that can be rather resource starved so you may enter a fight against a challenging boss with little health, chi, or focus. Combat rapidly devolves into a question of how fast can you bash through the tedium?\n\nThe inclusion of non-combat companions is not unique to Jade Empire, Dragon Age: Origins has a number of people who will appear at your camp, notably the dwarf merchants. Jade Empire has a merchant, though given how little the game makes you interact with many of its systems, it’s easy to forget about them. Of course there is also Kang, the mad scientist who builds and pilots your airship. The obvious point of comparison is Joker from Mass Effect, but the fact that the groundwork for such was laid in part of Jade Empire is worth noting.\n\nDynamic Relationships With Party Members\n\nBioware has seen the fervorous fandom it has in part because of sex appeal. The cast of their games continue on for years after relevance in the form of fan creation. Bioware gets this, and seemingly also doesn’t, given writer Drew Karpyshyn’s confusion about the passion Mass Effect fans have for the alien, Garrus Vakarian. Nevertheless, Bioware creates games with space for players to explore relationships between characters, both of the platonic and non-platonic nature. Jade Empire is no different. You can chat up companions at almost any moment, and depending on your dialogue choices and gender, you can romance three in particular.\n\nThe issues begin with the brevity of the main plot, and the lack of compelling spaces to engage with your companions. Compounded with a dearth of subjects to discuss because this is a world with little history, and it is easy to not feel compelled to head back to camp to catch up with everyone. Unlike other Bioware titles where you have distinct planets and locals with their own quest lines that act as chapters, such isn’t as present here. You are not guided back to your home space upon completion of a quest at the same frequency. Instead, you are often whisked off to the next area and pressing event. Which only ramps up in the last two thirds. A character such as Silk Fox, who comes in late bears the brunt of such. I had the intention of romancing her, but by simply being nice to Dawn Star in the dialogue choices I ended up with the milquetoast girl next door.\n\nAs much as Bioware has been lauded for being progressive with regards to the types of romances and characters they portray, it’s a distinction earned by comparison. Much of the games industry — especially the AAA portion — certainly fails in this regard. The inclusion of queer romances between cis-gender characters is indeed progressive by those standards. Dawn Star will only romance a male protagonist. Then Sky and Silk Fox will romance either a male or female. It is also possible to initiate romance subplots with multiple characters at once, though this isn’t a portrayal of polyamory as much as it is a harem. As a male protagonist, there is the possibility that Dawn Star and Silk Fox will become jealous of each other’s relationship with the Spirit Monk and it is possible for the player to convince them that they can share, in a scene that comes off like a high school boy’s sexual fantasies.\n\nBefore going any further though, we should run through each one in the order they appear. First is Dawn Star, the second best student at Two Rivers’ martial arts school who is set up as a childhood friend in touch with the world of spirits. She’s a bit of an outcast in town but is kind to all despite such. Some Bioware companions will often have “main companion syndrome.” This is when a party member is clearly more important to the overall plot than most others. Making them feel like the default companion to bring along. Dawn Star falls into this category given that she shares the same motivation of tracking down who attacked Two Rivers and kidnapped Master Li. She’s the goody-two-shoes of the bunch and will often push back against any “evil” actions the player character makes.\n\nSagacious Zu is a mysterious man who lives in the swamps outside your village and seems to harbor some sort of dark past. At a certain point in the story, you will learn that he was once a member of the Lotus Assassins who left after being ordered to kill an innocent family. Zu is a cynical self-described pragmatist. Willing to fight the Empire, but often doubtful of the odds of any sort of success. Though this is all thrown out the window in the final third as he makes the heroic sacrifice against the imposing masked figure of Death’s Hand, buying time for the young hero to escape. Though Zu does pop back in as a force ghost to help guide the Spirit Monk.\n\nNext is Wild Flower/ Chai Ka. Wild Flower is a little girl who is surprisingly accepting of the fact that a guardian spirit possesses her and orders her to follow the player character around. Chai Ka being said spirit, who swears loyalty to you based on your position as the sole remaining Spirit Monk. There isn’t a whole lot going on here, even with regards to the internal battle between Chai Ka and another spirit within Wild Flower who is rather malevolent. Think Ying and Yang but the most basic interpretation of it.\n\nSky is a dashing rogue archetype who is seeking revenge for those responsible for the death of his wife and child. His most compelling personality trait is that he is bi. His quest for vengeance is wrapped up rather quickly and he continues to pal around with the Spirit Monk because he’s the thief with a heart of gold and that’s about all there is to him.\n\nThe next five are all so equally cliche that they’re hard to describe past a singular sentence. All fitting firmly into the “not primary companion” category. Kang the Mad is a quirky scientist who developed advanced technology including flyers. He the wacky mad scientist trope all the way through. Black Whirlwind is a giant man who brutishly enjoys killing, drinking, and women. Henpecked Hou hates his wife and because she’s a controlling woman who made him give up martial arts. He really is a 1950’s sit-com character. Zin Bu is a bureaucrat from heaven who serves as a merchant for your group who I previously mentioned is entirely forgettable. So much so that I did indeed forget about him because he’s never seen in camp and does not travel with the party. Honestly, not sure why he is included as a companion. Death’s Hand does become an optional companion in the very end for players willing to make the “evil” moral choice required to obtain him. But it’s so late in the game that he’s just a combat companion for the final hour.\n\nLastly, Silk Fox is a mysterious woman who seems to be following your party and eventually reveals her true identity. She is very clearly modeled after Jen Yu from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon — the daughter of the Emperor — who seeks to expose that Death’s Hand and the Lotus Assassin’s are to blame for all the woes of the world.\n\nIf companions are not interesting then there is little reason to engage with the relationships. Black Whirlwind, Kang the Mad, and Henpecked Hou are hardly more than the cliches they are initially set up as. Talking to them is an act of frustration as you are forced to watch the same conversation beats play out time and time again. Wondering when they will offer up anything new or if you’re really going to have to sit through anymore of their ceaseless cliched rambling. It’s easy to see where the sorts of archetypes can, and would eventually be taken. Mordin Solus and Urdnot Wrex of Mass Effect are building off the mad scientist and battle loving brute tropes. Both take those concepts and twist them until those characters are something more. They become deeply introspective of these aspects of themselves. Thankfully the boomer era, wife hating sit-com character of Hou doesn’t come return.\n\nIt isn’t that there is no potential amongst the other companions. Silk Fox is a spoiled and demanding princess very much aware of her power over others. Her intentions of seeking justice are to exonerate her obviously culpable father. There is room here to pull down this very typical archetype. To not only see that her father is corrupt, but the whole Empire is. However, because there is only a tentative and fading interest in class struggle, that second part of the revelation never comes for Silk Fox, which I’ll detail further later on.\n\nThe mechanics driving all of this are understandably not all that different from KotOR, but less dynamic here. No matter your choices, everyone will follow you until the very end of the game. While they will voice their opinions on matters, there is no point where they will storm off. For example, even though Dawn Star is far and away the most open palm companion, even if the player character pursues a closed fist path, Dawn Star is still romanceable. This makes every companion feel devoid of agency, blindly follow the Spirit Monk no matter the moral cost. The epilogue which is a series of end cards cheaply attempting to rationalize this in a paragraph or so, but understandably these are not a compelling fulfillment of any sort of character arc.\n\nChoice Driven Narrative\n\nLike those that came before and after, Jade Empire’s cast and plot are guided by the player. Despite the description of an action RPG, this is still very much in the form of a Bioware RPG, and with that comes lots of talking. From asking directions, chatting with quest givers, big cinematic moments, and getting to know your companions. All of it has varying influence on the direction of the story, but all of it serves to color the story as the player sees fit. At times the forks in the road are readily apparent. Usually coming at the end of a long line of quests, but something as simple as a conversation at camp could lead to romance. More often than not, dialogue is a way to explore the world through its people.\n\nAt the heart is a morality system pulled straight out of KotOR. A vertically situated bar in the menu. Choices of dialogue or actions taken can affect where alignment. Despite what some reviews at the time imply, the morality is no more complex. Choices are coded in nearly identical fashion. It doesn’t take much examination to figure out an open palm choice is more “morally” correct than a closed fist choice. Especially, given the extra context of the in-menu user interface. The way of the open palm sits at the top and is colored blue. The body language of the player character becomes more at peace as their morality rises. Conversely, the way of the closed fist is colored red and the body language becomes angry and imposing. Early on, there is mention of more complex notions.\n\nA character in Two Rivers who serves as a sort of assistant instructor to Master Li describes the way of the open palm and closed fist. When describing the latter, he says “It is the low path, the way of aggression and discord. A misunderstood path often measured by those who wish to justify a thuggish nature. It is not as simple as crushing your enemies, or as mindless as terrorizing the weak. It is a mindset born of impatience, of imposing your will.”\n\nIf the player character responds “What else is it, if not evil?”\n\n“An evil man might ignore a plea for help because he does not care, but that shows a disconnection with the world. That is not part of the way. A man on the low path might also ignore the plea, but he would do so because that person should demonstrate they are fit to survive on their own.”\n\nThis exchange highlights the game’s stumbling attempts at what Bioware would handle better in later games. The most generous reading of this is that it’s an attempt to say that anger isn’t always evil. Which when you think about in conjunction with Bioware’s previous game and the strict code of the Jedi Order, you can understand how they would get to this conversation. A better example of this would be Dragon Age 2’s attempt at removing the moral coding of dialogue choices, and rather simply code them emotionally. Making it far more possible to be a character who responds to injustice with anger, and not have the game frame that as “an eye for an eye makes the world go blind.” This exchange is a moot point though as rarely does any of this come up again in the narrative or mechanics. I imagine they wanted to do more with this as was probably the case with much of this game’s ideas. As is, it’s more so a “hey, here’s something to think about as you play this game.”\n\nIn an interview with IGN, Bishop said “Like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire puts the player in control of his destiny, and the paths of evil and good in the game are distinctly different. Unlike our last game, the realities of good and evil are much muddier, and the choices much harder — people in Jade Empire sometimes do terribly bad things for what seem like good reasons at the time. To support these multiple paths of course we have multiple game endings, and multiple branching side quests, as well as styles and amulet gems that are only available to the most ruthless and benevolent PCs.”\n\nBishop still clearly implies a binary of good and evil and this is also stated by Muzyka in the G4 making of documentary and by Zeschuk in an interview he and Muzyka had with GameSpy. “There’s an awesome storyline, where you get to make meaningful choices for good (way of the open palm) or evil (way of the closed fist).”\n\nIt’s no wonder that the end result was a confused morality system when they so clearly were not able to leave behind the simple binaries while describing it.\n\nTo be fair, moral binaries are also present throughout much of Bioware’s catalog. However, KotOR lets you play around in a binary system given how easily it is to tie such into lightside vs darkside in entertaining ways. I found neither to be as interesting here. Again, this partly ties back into the world being so difficult to get invested in. As I’ve previously stated, Tien’s Landing is the portion that feels most complete and therefore, even if the morality is rather transparent , it’s easy to become motivated to make a choice based on how you’re roleplaying. The player’s big choice is focused around the dam. Should you open it, the river will fill back up and the trade lanes vital to the economic health of the town will begin again. Destroying the controls to ensure it stays closed for much longer, will likely bring about the town’s demise, but a local merchant who has gotten rich from the increased drinking habits will pay you a hefty sum. The temptation of monetary gain means little in a game with almost no economy though. It’s not a morally difficult choice, but it is one whose consequences mean something. You’ve walked through Tien’s Landing. You’ve spent roughly six to eight hours here getting to know its people and how they struggle because of the dam’s closure. The combination of incompetence and inaction by the Empire and local government has been costly. There is also the extra wrinkle that, if you flood the river again before finishing up any side quest in the abandoned part of town, then those quests and the restless spirits will be unresolved. To be in control of how healed the town can become, certainly plays into notions of games as power fantasy. Such is often at the core of the Bioware Formula for better and worse, but at least this is playing to the formula’s strengths.\n\nUpon entering the Imperial City, the stakes scale significantly. Local problems give way to national politics as your party sets its sights on the floating palace. To get to the royal palace you must first infiltrate the headquarters of the Lotus Assassins, the empire’s secret police. In more ways then one this is a rehashing of KotOR’s mission on the Sith planet of Korriban. The Spirit Monk pretends to be a hopeful recruit and steps into the lion’s den of a bunch of power hungry schemers attempting to climb in status. Only upon successfully infiltrating and discovering their true plans do you then get to ascend to the royal palace. This all sounds rather dense with potential political ramifications and moral choices. What does one do to keep their cover in order to overthrow a brutal dictatorship is a compelling question. Before entering, your companions express concern over your well being and how the Lotus Assassins break their initiates. Dawn Star worries that you’ll come out changed for the worse, even if you do succeed. This is a non-concern. There are fairly few tough choices beyond which of the Rube Goldberg styled machinations do you want to deploy to off the heartless secret police.\n\nAt one point the solution to getting a high ranking member to let their guard down is a bit more roundabout than I desired. In particular, a room needs to be cleared of witnesses. In it are two Lotus Assassins who can be a little stubborn about leaving unless you take some extra steps. Feeling mildly impatient with a game I rather dislike, I decided to just fight them then and there. You can’t witness a future murder if you’ve already been murdered after all. I received points towards the path of the closed fist as a result. For extra context, one of them was talking about killing kittens seconds before I chose to off them. Now, this does actually play into what Smiling Mountain was talking about earlier, but given how comically evil the Lotus Assassin’s are and the very immature presentation of the closed fist path everywhere else in the game, it’s rather head-scratching.\n\nWhat happens if you get the path of the open palm ending is that the Lotus Assassin’s are destroyed. Everyone around you, Silk Fox included, begins to defer to you for major choices regarding the Empire’s fate. Even then you really don’t have a lot of sway with the final outcome of the Empire. The open palm leads to the Empire remaining almost exactly as is. Instead, they install a “good” empress. It’s an incredibly naive solution. It undercuts what good narrative beats do come about that are critical, such the negligence at Tien’s Landing, and how easily corrupted even well intended parts of the political structure became.\n\nBoth of Bioware’s games on the Xbox are less concerned with the tough choices as much as they are leaning into the moral binaries they are constructed upon. But whereas KotOR manages to create interesting story possibilities for either light or dark side players that engage with the themes of the rest of the story, Jade Empire takes a far more juvenile approach while also failing to make either style any fun.\n\nCritical Conclusions\n\nNot unlike KotOR, Jade Empire is remembered in part for its late game twist. The player defeats Emperor Sun Hai, who you’ve discovered is the eldest brother to Master Li. As you approach Master Li, he reveals that he has actually been playing a game of big brained chess this entire time. He then strikes the Spirit Monk down, sending them to the afterlife. As he does so, he gives his explanation for his betrayal and how he manages to kill you so easily. First, as the last Spirit Monk, you were the only one who could defeat Sun Hai who had become infused with the power of the Water Dragon spirit. Also, while instructing you in martial arts, he created a fatal flaw that only he could take advantage of. Though in the cutscene that flaw appears to be simply tossing something up in the air as a distraction. Master Li, then assumes the throne and his nearly two decade long plan for revenge against his brother is complete. It is truly a knee-slap worthy reveal, even if it is foreshadowed in some rather obvious ways.\n\nThe player character has been a tool for the political machinations of the nobility. Their people, the spirit monks, were destroyed by imperialism. They were gaslighted into serving Master Li, one of the people most responsible for so much suffering. That agency, that narrative of being the chosen hero? All an elaborate fiction. Thrownness determined their fate. That is until they awake in the afterlife, and are guided by the spirit of the Water Dragon back to the land of the living, to change destiny and become the chosen hero. Depending on your choices at the end, a very influential person, nevertheless completing the hero’s journey.\n\nThe narrative conclusions ultimately do not support my earlier points about empire. Nor does it support the righteous conclusion to the story of Tien’s Landing. Instead, as is the case with Bioware titles from time to time, the political conclusions are that “if there is a bad emperor, one need not change the system, but simply install a good emperor.” There is no further interrogation of this. There is room to be had where, yes, ultimately the power system that has been in place for so long does not topple easily, even with righteous criticism. That it is held in place by those who benefit from it. That progress will unfortunately be incremental at times. Such lofty political theming is not Jade Empire though. Putting Silk Fox on the throne is a moment of jubilee.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned throughout, Jade Empire feels rather rushed. The final third is the most telling sign of what I suspect were significant development struggles. It becomes a cannon of linearity blasting you headfirst into extensive and redundant conversations. Through areas that exist so briefly that you have to wonder about their inclusion from a resource allocation level. Villains who are built up for five minutes — one of whom seems to be this world’s Satan — that get shuffled off screen as quickly as they are introduced. Companions are hardly around for extended periods, only to rejoin you in one final battle that includes new mini-games that strips the core experience of fighting out to be a pedestrian beat-em-up for five minutes.\n\nWe do have some sort of idea about the state of development. In Bioware: Stories and Secrets there is a short aside about Arryn Flynn — who would later be in charge at Bioware — explaining the first time he had coffee. Saying that it began when the project director on Jade Empire went to get coffee around 10pm one night and Flynn decided to give it a try. He goes on to say “Then the next night, I did it again. And I probably did that for, I don’t know, six months straight in the closing months of Jade Empire. Six, seven, days a week getting a coffee at night and working till two or three in the morning…I’m pretty sure I gained ten pounds doing it…”\n\nIn the aforementioned GamesIndustry interview with Zeschuk, he said “it would have been great to put it off a bit, and polish it up a bit more.” It’s not hard to hear all this and imagine a story of Bioware being told to, or realizing they needed to ship Jade Empire sooner rather than later. That the system it was being developed for was being sunsetted. That they had other projects in the works. So Jade Empire shipped as is. Becoming another game- and development team- in the ever-growing list that suffered from crunch.\n\nOver the years, fans of Jade Empire have wondered where the sequel is, despite there being no obvious sequel-hook. In modern times it takes just a quick twitter or google search to see a non-insignificant number of people asking for it or at least a remaster. The reasons no such thing has ever come are multi-faceted. At the time of release it didn’t sell well. Zeschuk claimed in the interview in 2013 with GamesIndustry that “game sales are down because people are waiting for new consoles, and we released Jade Empire into that kind of window.” This probably has some truth to it, but operates so heavily on how the game industry used to be understood, and was likely overly simplistic even in 2013, or even 2005. Why a game or console fails is often more complex.\n\nFirst, there is the lack of big brand names on Jade Empire. Baldur’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights could lean on the pre-existing fandom of Dungeons & Dragons, while KotOR had Star Wars. It’s also worth noting that Jade Empire was an Xbox console exclusive for nearly two years. An RPG from a company whose foundations were in the PC RPG space having such a delayed release undoubtedly hurt the sales number at launch. A time that is critical to the perception of success in the eyes of the developer and more so, the publisher. As of May 2006, Xbox had confirmed roughly 24 million Xbox systems had been sold around the world. Presumably a few million less by the time of Jade Empire’s release in 2005. Not an insignificant number, but it was a system that largely sold off the back of Halo and Halo 2. There certainly was an audience built for the RPG genre given the success of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and KotOR on the platform, but to cut out the audience on PC was costly. By July of the same year, Jade Empire had sold around 500,000 copies. If you compare that to KotOR, which sold 250,000 in its first four days on Xbox alone, yes, that is a disappointment.\n\nIn the video, Jade Empire Retrospective an Extremely Comprehensive Critique by I Finished a Video Game, they blame part of the failure on the marketing. Pointing to a trailer that shows flashy kung-fu combat, but not really detailing much else. I’m not so convinced as trailers have long been vague about what a game is beyond its action and graphics. Countering this is Bioware: Stories and Secrets from 25 Years of Game Development. It provides some details on the presence of Jade Empire on show floors such as E3. Preview coverage of Jade Empire was extensive, given this was Bioware coming off KotOR, backed by a hungry Microsoft trying to get a foothold into the console market. Jade Empire was a thoroughly previewed game with interviews on the biggest gaming websites leading up to its launch with a 30 minute making of documentary produced at G4, as well as a full episode of the TV show, Cheat.\n\nIt’s worth noting that a Jade Empire 2 was in development for quite some time. However, the project went through a tough development and was ultimately canceled before it was ever publicly announced. Revolver- as it was eventually known- began as a direct sequel, but with the rise in popularity of open worlds with the advent of the seventh generation of consoles, the project shifted from being similar to the original, to being an open-world. Though that too eventually was pulled back. But then another change came as writer Patrick Weekes described it “Jade modern…one thousand years in the future, taking place in a city reminiscent of Hong Kong.” The changes kept coming though, as the direct connections to Jade Empire were stripped out as the project became less about Chinese mythology and more about a gritty urban landscape with cyberpunk influences, including cultural aspects from far more than just China. In 2008 after the tumultuous development, the project was shelved.\n\nBy the time it was canceled, passion for the project had been drained. As Weekes said “Morale definitely took a hit each time we rebooted.” Also stating, “It was going to be in the same world but we would never mention it, because people were not as confident in Jade Empire and didn’t feel as excited about it.” Jade Empire was a passion project, specifically of co-founder Greg Zeschuk, having built a vertical slice for a title called Five Fingers of Death around the time of Baldur’s Gate, using that game’s engine and essentially reskinning a lot of aspects. Zeschuk left Bioware in 2012. While some staff who worked on Jade Empire remained at Bioware for quite some time, many — including leadership roles — have since left. It’s easy to see how a sequel turned spiritual successor with a troubled development and eventually being canned in 2008 would leave the Jade Empire IP by the wayside. After all, in 2008 Bioware was in the midst of the ambitious Mass Effect trilogy, the also new and incredibly popular Dragon Age franchise, developing a MMORPG in Star Wars: The Old Republic, as well as being attached to a few other projects.\n\nDarrah details this in his video Memories and Lessons- Jade Empire 2 / Jade Modern/ Revolver. He was the final director on the project and stated “I wasn’t on Revolver for very long before EA started putting in cutbacks and restrictions on Bioware. The EA of the time of 2008, that’s just how they operated. Studios would get bigger and then they would slam restrictions in place and ask for layoffs and reduced team sizes.” Though Darrah remarks Muzyka was able to prevent lay-offs at the time due to his influence within EA. Darrah later explains that the version of Revolver that was in production alongside Dragon Age: Origins and Mass Effect 2 was around the time of those proposed layoffs. That all three teams actually needed to expand at the time to ramp up production and well, Revolver lost that fight. Though this also killed the project Javelin, and the handheld/mobile team.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Jade Empire has never had the staying power of Baldur’s Gate, KotOR, Mass Effect, or Dragon Age. While it was well received at the time, I firmly do not believe it holds up to its contemporaries from Bioware. The modern fandom of Jade Empire does not have the same passionate fervor. There is no central reddit sub-forum. The two largest sit at 1,000 and 400 users. Both of which can go weeks without a new post. In the Bioware subreddit which has 18k users, posts about Jade Empire can be spread out by weeks. Meanwhile the Mass Effect and Dragon Age subreddits have 300k and 180k users. The largest Bioware discord server meanwhile relegates Jade Empire from having its own channel to a legacy game. In fairness this is anything older than Mass Effect, but conversations about Jade Empire don’t appear at the same frequency as other titles.\n\nIn the modern consciousness, a western developer creating a game about another culture would be under far more scrutiny. Bioware has become a more diverse studio in the time since, and Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima shows that such success could be found, even if the criticism remains. However, for a developer with safer bets in the form of Dragon Age and Mass Effect, that is also still attempts to be seen as a truly progressive developer, why take the risk?\n\nJade Empire is a perfect example of how the Bioware Formula is not a constant. Whether through experimentation or lackluster execution, all of which is present here. The formula is a guiding foundation, but can be changed as needed. Sadly, Jade Empire is more than worthy of the criticism it has received over the years, failing to prove that its deviations are worthwhile. Its place in history as is a deserved one. Jade Empire is not simply a lesser — but still good — Bioware title, but rather it is a thoroughly flawed curiosity in the lineage of one of the most influential developers of the last couple decades."
