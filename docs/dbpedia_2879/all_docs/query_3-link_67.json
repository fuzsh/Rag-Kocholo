        "text": "I don't think Ubisoft understands what people loved about the original game as evidenced by the trailers/builds they've shown in the years since the sequel was announced (cuss monkey?). We just want a bigger single-player Zelda-like game starring Jade continuing the same story that ended on a cliffhanger.\n\nIt's infuriating like how Nintendo keeps trying to 'innovate' on every new Star Fox game. Like we just want a better Star Fox 64 without the control scheme gimmicks. That first gameplay snippet from 2006(?) that showed Jade parkouring over rooftops was the closest Ubisoft has been to delivering a fan-pleasing sequel. Everything else? I don't know what game they think they're making that they're okay with slapping Beyond Good and Evil 2 on the box.\n\nI am definitely interested but at this point we know so little about what kind of game this will actually be. I suspect it will be a tremendous departure from the first game.\n\nIf that is a good thing or a bad thing is currently unclear.\n\nIf the game is fun to play, then it doesn’t matter when it releases. I judge each game for what it is when i play it not what the hype expects it to be.\n\nTake Skull and Bones as an example. I was hoping i would get the same fun i had when playing Black Flag. I tried the demo and it wasn’t so i don’t play it.\n\nSo many potentially amazing games on the horizon I hope this is as well and i am excited but if it turns out to be something bad or just not the type of game i like to play than it isn’t.\n\nI am excited and will be glad to see it finally come out, but I am going to be fully honest, I don't expect it to be a masterpiece. A great game, but not a masterpiece. I expect somewhere in like the 75-80 range. But I am more than willing to be pleasantly surprised!\n\nNot at all. And this is coming from someone who at one time wanted to dress like her and become a photojournalist. lol.\n\nGoing back to remind myself, I was more put off by the trailer than I was the first time. The swearing, the violence, the attitude of the monkey guy, it just points to a very different vision and sensibility than the original. The original game was about family, loyalty, and courage, showing how friendship can stand up to hopelessness. But only the ending where their Yamato-looking ship takes off looks and feels anything like the original game.\n\nAlso, besides the monkey guy dropping the f-word over and over again, there's another reason I'm not looking forward to it. Ubisoft has become a horribly greedy company with their constant live-service games, and \"AAAA\" marketing BS and that's enough for me to say nope.\n\nPersonally it looks so far from BG&E that I don’t see the point. This feels like one of those games with the name but not the soul of its namesake. I will need amazing reviews and to see extensive gameplay in order to buy this game. I also think the full prequel route is a bad idea unless that is the first half of the game. The original ended on a cliffhanger. Get back to that.\n\nI can only agree with the above comment, the new game will have lost the 'soul' of the original and is now just exploiting the IP.\n\nMaybe it will be a good game in own right, but when a team takes this long to deliver its usually cause theres something not right with the original concept and they go around in circles for years trying to make it work.. I hope that's not the case with this.\n\nI played the first one on PS3 and really enjoyed it, but the way the second has this 'on again, off again' thing happening with it, it's been difficult to get hyped. Frankly, I'm still not sure it will ever release, but if it does, and it's good, I'll buy it."
