        "text": "Since the dramatic introduction of Beyond Good & Evil 2 at E3 2017, the folks over at Ubisoft have been working hard on the game. Now, they’re ready to update players on it, and in a new video released today, players can get a good look at some of the ship designs that Ubisoft has created.\n\nAs you can tell in the video above, a ton of ships have been created so far, ranging from “puttering tuk-tuks” to “towering motherships,” and there’s still more to come. Much of the video features developers from Ubisoft Montpellier discussing their vision for the game, with senior creative director Michael Ancel saying the studio is focused on bringing player’s motivations into the game. The video also delves a bit into the hybrid character models that bled human and animal to form the characters in the game, and players also get a chance to hear how their crew will be one of the driving forces of adventure in the game.\n\nThe video also talks a bit about the Space Monkey Program, the name for Ubisoft’s open design initiative. Ubisoft Montpellier is using the Program as a way to get player feedback much earlier in the process of game development than usual, and today, they actually held a livestream to go over how the game is doing and invite players to leave constructive feedback on their updates.\n\nAccording to the folks at Ubisoft Montpellier, the team is looking to make the Program even more involved in the creative process, and players are encouraged to sign up for a chance to join that conversation at the Beyond Good & Evil website. Make sure to stay tuned for any future updates regarding the game.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 2 currently has no release information and is still in development."
