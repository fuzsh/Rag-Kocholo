While it says Next Generation in the title it’s going to focus on gaming across the board as it’s just our silly/clever way of saying it’s our second challenge within this realm.\n\nToday, we want to get things going by talking about the games that have been forgotten, the IP that still stands out in a big positive way for you years after it’s fallen by the wayside. Can and should it be revived?\n\nBonus question: What IP needs to lie fallow for a generation or two in order to get a much-needed break?"
