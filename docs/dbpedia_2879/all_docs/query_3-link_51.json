The music in this game SLAPS. Within the first five minutes, the music was able to capture my attention. And the music continued to capture me throughout the game's runtime; the energetic music, the melancholic music, and everything in-between.\n\n++ Blend of gameplay. The game never felt like it dragged because there were so many different gameplay elements. There are simple platforming and puzzle sections. There is combat here and there, and while it is quite basic, it's quite enjoyable because of how nimble and acrobatic Jade moves. There are stealth sections (which were my least favourite). There are vehicle sections (racing and combat). And there is also the photography aspect which gave me a good reason to slow down and appreciate the world that they had created.\n\n++ Charming. Jade, Pey'j, Double H, and all the other characters were quite loveable and voice-acted well enough. The character designs and the art style was also quite unique and I liked it a lot! And the small world they created was filled with locations that had tons of personality.\n\n++ Narrative. The story wasn't anything too complex, but I cared for the characters (mainly Jade and Pey'j) and found the overall plot to be interesting.

I don't know if this would have been a big issue with a controller, but I really struggled with the camera while using keyboard & mouse. I also found it annoying that the camera would switch from free to fixed angles frequently. Another issue was how zoomed-in the view was. It was hard to know what was happening around Jade because it was soo zoomed-in to her. And while using the hovercraft, you can only move the camera around when not moving which was a bit bothersome.\n\n-- Stealth sections. It was a minor gripe, but I didn't like the stealth sections in the game, and I'm usually a fan of stealth. The main issue was that the sightlines of the enemy guards was inconsistent.\n\n-- Companion AI. Minor gripe, but my companions stopped following me from time to time and got stuck on objects or the environment.\n\n-- Collecting pearls. Getting the pearls was quite varied and fun, but the game often required the player to collect a certain amount in order to update the hovercraft and progress. While this did give the player a reason to explore the world, I think it slightly affected the pacing of the story.\n\nSo this is the first title I finished this year, and it seems that 2017 is off to a great start. Beyond Good & Evil is a fun and varied action adventure with racing and stealth elements. It tells a great story set in an original gameworld full of quirky, likeable, but refreshingly non-clichéd characters, and features one of the most kick-ass female protagonists I've seen.\n\nThe setting remixes common tropes in an interesting fashion : A tranquil, maritime planet far away from Earth, where people and humanoid animals of different cultures live peacefully together, has come under attack from an evil outside force (the D.O.M.Z.) that devastates the land, abducts its people and would long have taken over if it wasn't for the \"Alpha Sections\", the special forces that protect and defend the population...or so they claim... In the midst of this conflict, you play as Jade, a young photojournalist, whose job it will become to investigate and expose what is really going on. Jade and her \"uncle\" Pey'j, a tinkering two-legged pig with a passion for motors, also happen to run an asylum for children whose parents have been abducted, so for them, the struggle is close and personal right from the start. Also, Jade has many friends around town, and the game does a great job contrasting their laid-back friendliness with the quasi-totalitarian overlordship of the Alpha Sections... And so, before you know it, you start to forget that you're playing a game and start to actually care about fictional people and their relationships, and I found this to be the game's greatest strength.\n\nThe well-written dialogue, lovely character art, expressive animations and catchy tunes all support this feeling of immersion. Gameplay-wise, Beyond Good & Evil was fun, but not revolutionary. …\n\nSo this is the first title I finished this year, and it seems that 2017 is off to a great start.

Gameplay-wise, Beyond Good & Evil was fun, but not revolutionary. The difficulty level is quite low -- not that I didn't still manage to suck in some sections -- so I suspect it was designed with younger players in mind. The game's area is relatively small, but it can be freely explored, with a number of optional side missions to make it worthwhile. For example, as a photojournalist, Jade is tasked with taking an inventory of the animals alive on the planet, and this makes for some engaging (and sometimes exasperating) non-bloody hunting. She can also enter a string of races with her little hoverboat, which were fun and thankfully easy to win. I generally liked how much variety there was in the gameplay -- stealth, platforming, combat and puzzles were all present. My favourite thing to do, however, was hoverboating on the open sea, which conveyed an awesome feeling of freedom after the more confined spaces inside buildings.\n\nThe game's few flaws are to be found in the technical department, most notably in the controls: Since it was originally designed for consoles, the directional buttons don't move you relative to where your character is facing, but Pac-Man style -- left is always left, up is always up. I found this very hard to get used to in a 3D PC game. Also, the camera is supposed to adjust automatically but sometimes just doesn't, so you can't always quite see where you're going. And lastly, one sidekick you get later in the game has a really annoying habit of standing in your way. None of this detracted too much from my overall enjoyment, however. I ended up playing the entire game twice (once in French, once in Dutch, since the game makes it super-easy to switch languages -- bonus points for that!). The second time around, I chased down every last collectible it had to offer, and I definitely don't regret the time spent on this. So, I suppose I'm officially a fan of this cult classic now, and find myself looking forward to the next installment.\n\nIt's not a great look to spend your review of a game talking about the sequel that has been repeatedly teased/cancelled/restarted for the better part of 20 years, but Beyond Good and Evil is such a specific odd duck, there's really no way around it. Released back in 2003, BG&E received positive reviews for being a heartfelt, entertaining genre-hopper of a game that introduced us to a promising new universe. It had people pretty excited, but If you look at the game objectively, there isn't a ton to chew on. It's a brief game that earned a lot of goodwill due to it's likable photographer protagonist Jade and an amiably cartoonish sci-fi visual style which featured humans, animals and other weird creatures living in harmony. It had a kind of underdog spirit that gave it a certain amount of \"cred\" as a game that a lot of people slept on but is actually quite good. As time has moved on and demand for a sequel grew, that sentiment reached a sort of mythological level as multiple starts and stops plagued the floundering follow-up's development. All the while, BG&E stayed in the conversation as a great game that really REALLY needed a sequel. I would go so far as to say this game has now been dramatically overrated by the games media, which simply refused to let it just drift off to the great beyond.\n\nAnd now here we are. Beyond Good and Evil 2 is STILL in development, re-revealed to much excitement at E3 2017. The CG trailer that was shown was a banger, too. Really exciting stuff just oozing with character. And then silence. Word on the street …\n\nIt's not a great look to spend your review of a game talking about the sequel that has been repeatedly teased/cancelled/restarted for the better part of 20 years, but Beyond Good and Evil is such a specific odd duck, there's really no way around it.

And then silence. Word on the street now is that the game is some massive MMO and there's an animated series in the works with Netflix? Also, they wanted artists to work on the game for free through some bizarre crowd-sourcing campaign? It's just a mess. Here's hoping the sequel to Beyond Good and Evil, a modest little game with a lot of heart from 3(!) generations ago, can circumvent decades of game design evolution, explode our expectations, be the massive hit that we all want it to be, and make this review look really outdated. Until then, I'm not going to dwell on it.\n\nA great game although time has not been the kindest to it.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil is an action adventure game with a 3rd person view. You play as Jade - a reporter picking up work for a resistance group in order to discover alien/government conspiracy in a beautifully crafted world inhabited by all kind of creatures.\n\nStarting of with bad to get it out of the way. Configuring graphics was a nightmare in order to run it smoothly and not have flicker but it is possible. No gamepad support although the game almost screams for it. The settings for subtitles were never saved so had to on each lunch set them manually - annoying to say the least. Camera work leaves a lot to desire - especially in tighter spots where it for no apparent reason switches from 3rd person view to fixed angle.\n\nApart from that - a masterpiece - though at least a star comes from nostalgia related to this game. Played it at least twice though this is my first time finishing it.\n\nThe visuals are what they are. A little outdated but still not that bad looking. However the world is so unique and great that it's easy to forget the age of the game. And there's this wonderful atmosphere around it that you just immerse yourself in it.\n\nGame play wise it's a little bit of everything. Mostly it's exploration - sneaking into various places in order to take some photos and create a report. There's a little bit of combat but it's not the best part of the game. There are races in hovercraft and a couple of odd places to collect pearls which are essential to complete the game.\n\nAudio wise it's really well …\n\nA great game although time has not been the kindest to it.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil is an action adventure game with a 3rd person view.

The music is varied and fits the locations really well.\n\nThe story is intriguing and well written. It's not really aimed at mature audience - but I really enjoyed it throughout. With plenty of stand out characters it just makes sense and keeps you interested towards the end.\n\nIt's also not hand holding you through entire game and figuring stuff on your own is that more rewarding.\n\nOverall I love this game. Mostly for the atmosphere I think. But there's just some magic around it that makes it really stand out and worth playing even in this day and age - as long as you can get pass the technical difficulties."
