        "text": "The more I play Beyond Good and Evil the more respect I have for it. Its one of the best games I've played all year, and perhaps ever. The other thing I kept picking up on was how much it's like Zelda, and how much better is in a lot of ways. Such as: <BR><BR>1) The world. The waterlogged place in Wind Waker is standard Nintendo fare. Its bright, cheery, and rather simple. The people have very little personality. The world of Hillys in BG&E on the other hand is amazing. Its beautiful to look at, sure, but it also have amazing amounts of personality. You walk around the streets, go into bars, into shops, and everything just feels real. A lot of love went into the creation of the backstory and the logic of the world, and it shows. Amazing. <BR><BR>2) Characters. Link is...well, he's Link. He's cool, but at the same time, he overslept on his birthday, and he finds out that he has a destiny and blah blah blah. Its so overdone. Jade on the other hand is complex. She's brave and resourceful, but also very human. Ahem. Her sidekick Pey'j is no Tingle either, he's fat, boisterous, and when he talks you get the feeling that he and Jade have been working together for a long time and there's actual emotion there. Combine that with the Rasta Rhinos that ran the local chopshop (Mamma only takes Pearls, you know) and the other array of animal/human hybrids you run into with great animation and style and you have a great character driven story. <BR><BR>3) Music. This may be a dead tie. The music is Zelda was great and all, but DAMN if BG&E doesn't have something for everyone. Listen to the music in the bar, on the water, in the streets. There's hip-hop, rock, reggae, flamenco, there's everything. The game has an interesting multicultural vibe, and it adds a lot to the game. If you can leave the Akuda Bar and not be humming the song inside for at least an hour you're a better man than I. <BR><BR>4) Minigames and diversions. Zelda had the famous \"splish\" moments and fishing, but BG&E has races (almost good enough to be a game on their own) and Pallet, an insidious time killer. The shooting segments are no slouch either, and trying to collect pictures of the animals is rather challenging. <BR><BR>5) Hay guyz, boatz! The boating in Zelda got to be a pain rather quickly. In BG&E the hovercraft is a zippy little thing, upgradeable and somewhat of a badass once you get it going. Its a joy to pilot, race, and to fight in. The boating segments are short and the hub world isn't as big meaning you won't meander around. <BR><BR>6) Voice Acting: Other than Tingle's HAAAAYYYY!!!!!! I don't remember much voice in Zelda. In Beyond you get a ton of it, and shock of all shocks its sublime, some of the best voice acting ever done in a game. Every voice just drips with personality, and Pey'j is laugh out loud funny in places. While not EVERY line has voice behind it, enough do that every character feels real. <BR><BR>Beyond Good and Evil simply put IS that good. I think we need to bring it back up every now and again but there's no reason it shouldn't have been a huge hit. I'm not even dogging Wind Waker that heavily, I loved that game and got my money's worth, but Beyond Good and Evil in a lot of ways is far superior. <BR><BR>Its also on every platform and only $20, so there's no excuse not to pick it up. Even though its on the short side (12 hours or so) that's still a great value for the money. There are used copies but if you don't mind the extra $2 get a new, send Ubisoft a message that the game is good and PLS SND SEQUEL. <BR><BR>Wind Waker was a good game and deserved to be a hit. Beyond Good and Evil is a great game that deserved to be a monster.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Gendal:<BR><BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by WangButter:<BR>If BG&E was about 3 times bigger, it would be good competition for Zelda. It could have done with another two proper planets, where you could really put that space ship to good use. Sorry, but 12 hours is just too short for me to consider it in the same class as Zelda. I remember when 12 hours was the amount of gameplay you could expect in an _expansion pack_ <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>I used to agree with this, but then I found myself never finishing the larger games out of boredom (wind waker included) while the shorter games I usually finished feeling good I had beaten it. I just get bored with the mechanics of the game after awhile and I hate filler material. Zelda has a huge chunk of this at the end and I just washed my hands of the whole affair when I reached it. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>++ (am i allowed a third plus? oh well...) +<BR><BR>Though I'd say they're VERY different- Zelda is far more fighting-oriented, whereas BG&E focuses on the sneaking and, like PoP, is maybe a little too linear insofar as having one route through a level.<BR>This may be part of why BG&E hit length so perfectly- I feel like any more and it might have felt repetitive, and I fear the sequel can't possibly be as good for this reason. Though I do wish they'd taken a little more time in the last section.<BR>Better than the racing: the on-foot escape sequences.\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr>I've come to realize that the game would be a lot more appealing if it held your hand a bit more.<br> <hr>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br><br>Over time with Final Fantasy games I've grown sick of how they like to hold your hand. Sure you can get lost in WW and other games but if you get discouraged you can always look up a FAQ. If a designer decides to lead a character through a game though they tend to do it in such a way that makes it nearly impossible to have freedom in the game to do sidequests whenever you like. You have to wait until certain times when you can, usually towards the end when you have vehicle X that allows you to get everywhere. When I got bored going straight from dungeon to dungeon I could go do something else for awhile in WW. <br><br>I'm still in the early stage of BG&E, but I honestly hope it doesn't end up restricting my movements too much.<br><br><blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr> I suppose I'll have to try BG&E too. Just curious: How did it sell? <hr>\n\n</blockquote> <br><br>Within a couple months or less the price dropped considerably, so I don't think it did that well. -- View image here: http://episteme.arstechnica.com/infopop/emoticons/icon_frown.gif --\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr> Originally posted by WangButter:<br>I thought there were a fuck TON of great moments in WindWaker.<br><br>- SPLISH!

You condensed all my thoughts into three lines. My middle brother really liked this game at first and was a neophite to Zelda, but I believe the repetitiveness of WW turned him away from Zelda games. <br> <br><blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr> Originally posted by Horrible Oscar:<br>People say they like non-linear games, but that does bite them in the ass occasionally <hr>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br>Although that usually happens with me (yet I still love nonlinear-ness) it didn't happen with WW.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Another question - which platform should I get it on? I have Xbox and Gamecube, and my first instinct is to get it on Xbox, thinking the graphics and sound will be better. But this seems like a game that would be a lot of fun, and look pretty good on the 'Cube, too (maybe it has something to do with Stasis' comparisons to Wind Waker). Also, I noticed that for some reason, the cover art for the 'Cube version is different than that of the Xbox and PS2 versions. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>IGN's head-to-head concluded that the xbox and cube versions were nigh-identical, with the cube version suffering from an ever so slightly less stable framerate, and ever so slightly lower quality audio (prologic II rather than dolby digital, and apparently things sound a tad more compressed). Oh, and you have to go to the pause menu to see the map, since the cube pad has less buttons. Basically, i'd just go for the platform with the controller you like better, unless you've got hdtv and a surround-sound setup, in which case you might be able to notice the slight differences between the cube and xbox versions (the cube version doesn't support proscan, despite the fact that even the ps2 version does )."
