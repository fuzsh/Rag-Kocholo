        "text": "\"Beyond Good & Evil\" is one of my absolute favourite games.\n\nI'm interested in HD's new music (upload, anyone?) and the promised additional content (whatever that is). Apart from that, the HD version looks pretty much exactly like my seven-year old PC version. This is of course Ubisoft's test to see if there might be a casual gamer audience for this franchise today and must be seen more as a re-release than an actual \"HD version\".\n\nUbisoft is not an attractive company for PC gamers any more, with DLC not getting released for this platform and, most of all, an abomination of a copy protection system that absolutely MUST affect their sales for the sake of the future of PC gaming. Unfortunately, if it DOES affect their sales, they might think that they should ban the PC releases altogether.\n\nThe new cover is... hmmmmOK, I guess. All right, Jade doesn't look like Jade, Pey'J looks like his redesign from the early \"BG&E2\" teaser (that was 2008...). Also, I am really convinced that Jade's left arm is broken. Mr. artist, you will have to take another look at how radius and ulna work, because this thing is sub-par for a professional.\n\nThe \"traitor\" trailer was a massive letdown. The most important aspect of the game is not even mentioned. Jade does fight with weapons against \"the government\", if that is how you want to put it. But quite essentially, she's a journalist, a photographer. She is investigating, she is collecting photographic evidence. That is, in fact, the game, it's what makes the game special, and the trailer doesn't bother to give us that crucial information!\n\nMarketing fail: Yet again.\n\nShe is raising and protecting orphan children in her lighthouse. She photographs animal species to earn money. Could they please tell us that??\n\nApart from these VERY VALID points of criticism, I suggest every next-gen-console owner who missed this when it came out, please play it now. Do it before it's too late, really. You might be disappointed by the game's length (seven to ten hours is pretty much the maximum you'll get out of it), but you'll be stunned by its gameplay versatility, its bold design choices, and of course Jade's subtle facial expression. Even today, her character intensity is unsurpassed. She's a legend, pretty much.\n\nThere is a reason why, besides only very few games like Monkey Island and Sam & Max, you'll even find fan art of her in my DeviantArt gallery.\n\nI remember loving photographing the animals\n\nDid the animals do anything that would let you make Pornographic pictures?\n\nI have the PC version and played with it a little got busy playing unreal tournament 2003 and 2004 and never touched it again since.\n\nSo I could already run the PC version at super high resolution above HD back then So I se no point of buying the game again unless they added new GPU effects or something but the PC already had it's own shader 2.0 effects and higher res textures back then. If they did it over again and it makes it look better I might.\n\nSame with prince of persia HD it looks exactly like the old PC version at high res so I see no big deal.\n\nSO i see no point of adding the words HD on everything especially games with PC versions since you could run the games at HD resolutions back when the came out years ago.\n\nSerious sam HD they should have just called it something else since calling it HD is stupid HD is a resolution standard for Tv's the first PC game already ran at and the reason it is in HD is it has a new 3d engine called serious engine 3 and they are not using serious engine 1 that came out with the first game back in 2001 or when ever it was.\n\nThey need to stop with this HD thing it is dumb, the only games that should get a HD tag on it is games that ran under HD resolution or not in widescreen and there was nothing you could do about it like alien hominid HD is appropriate since that game enver really ran in HD before...everything else it just lame.\n\nand god those lame HD sunglasses don't even make sense\n\nWhat are these things going to do make me see more Pixels when I am looking at real life?"
