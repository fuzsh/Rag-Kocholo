        "text": "In the case of many movies, videogames are a happy consequence of a successful film. But for others, the videogame is the starting point (or at least, earlier on in the chain of development).\n\nVideogame adaptations have, however, been hit and miss... mostly miss, from Assassin's Creed to Silent Hill. Recent films have been more firm in the hit category though, with both Sonic the Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu achieving box-office and critical success.\n\nAnd now the man behind the cinematic take on Pikachu is back in the world of video games, tackling the cult classic Beyond Good & Evil. The film, unlike his previous work, however, will debut on Netflix.\n\nRelated: Sonic the Hedgehog is an entertaining video game adaptation that's strictly for kids\n\nMuch like Detective Pikachu, the Beyond Good & Evil adaptation is set to be a blend of CGI and live action which worked well for the Pokemon film. Whether or not the same sense of humour applies to Beyond Good & Evil remains to be seen.\n\nThe source material is rather serious. Beyond Good & Evil is set in the year 2435, on a distant mining planet called Hillys, populated by humans and anthropomorphic animals. The game begins with Hillys under attack from aliens called the DomZ.\n\nThey abduct Hillys' population and drain their life force for power, or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves. The game's protagonist (and, in all likelihood the main character in the film) is Jade, a photojournalist who, with her uncle (a boar-like creature) open their home to children orphaned by the DomZ.\n\nJade begins working with a resistance movement to reveal a planet-wide alien conspiracy, in which the very rulers who vowed to protect Hillys' population may be in cahoots with the DomZ. It was planned as part of a trilogy of games, but no more were made.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil debuted in 2003 to mixed reviews. Despite its commercial failure, it was nominated for game of the year. Since its so-so release, it has developed a cult following.\n\nIn 2017, Ubisoft announced a prequel was in the works (which would be the second release-wise in the planned trilogy) and a controversial plan to crowd-source material for it transpired.\n\nDespite claims that the prequel was going ahead, there have been no further developments. Well, besides the movie.\n\nThe premise is certainly cinematic, and with Detective Pikachu's Rob Letterman at its helm, Beyond Good & Evil could turn out to be a hit. The fact that it will debut on Netflix will likely work in its favour, as casual viewers who may not know the video-game at all are more likely to watch a film for \"free\" than venture to the cinema.\n\nKeep your eyes on this space as more details are released. You know, like the cast, plot, release date, and a trailer!\n\nDigital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.
