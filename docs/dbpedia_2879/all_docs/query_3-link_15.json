        "text": "Beyond Good & Evil 2 is finally starting to take shape. We've seen the game in action before in the previous old in-game footage showcase, but the latest developer livestream was our first proper look at the game. There are so much information surrounding the game from the development team, so I'll try to post everything in here. Note that everything posted here is mostly taken from the Unofficial - Everything we know about the Game! thread in Ubisoft forums, so all credits are due to everyone involved in compiling the information.\n\nTitle: Beyond Good & Evil 2\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montpellier & others\n\nEngine: Voyager Engine\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nPlatforms: Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC (not final)\n\nKey Features\n\nThis space RPG game will incorporating the main pillars/elements of BGE1 such as, 3rd person perspective, friends, combat, vehicles, exploration(first-person view for photos), stealth (also other elements we see in games like Witcher3 such as dialogues, quests, collectibles, and leveling) and on top of that the Co-OP option.\n\nYou will be able to create your own character which can be human or hybrid and that comes with negative and positive effects for each species. Also, side characters should be playable too.\n\nYou start as lowlife guy with a space tuk-tuk. You evolve yourself over time with your crew and your ship. That is why an XP system is in place. We heard stuff along the lines of delivering pizza as an option to grow.\n\nMinor characters are randomly generated and therefore unique to everyone.\n\nThere will be multiple solutions for a quest to solve it.\n\nActions may have consequences (like disturbing supply lanes for a city).\n\nThe game is an open-world title.\n\nThere's a police system, \"GTA in space\"\n\nAbility to go from character scale out into space without loading screens, possibly within seconds, and then traveling between worlds. It's compared to No Man's Sky but emphasized that they want to focus more on few, specifically designed worlds, while still allowing some parts to be intelligently generated like in Dwarf Fortress.\n\nGrappling gauntlet and jetpack are methods to move vertically as shown in the trailer.\n\nMinigames, like card games.\n\nIt is an online singleplayer game with seamless multiplayer feature. Play solo or with friends.\n\nGame Setting\n\nThe game takes place before BGE1 (prequel)\n\nGametime is in the 24th century where India and China have become the global superpowers in the 22nd century. They working on creating human-animal hybrids for interstellar colonization. However, those hybrids are treated as slaves and are probably the lowest class in this society.\n\nThe location of the game will take place is System3. System 3 is rich in resources and worlds in the habitable zone, a place full of spacefaring commerce. Also, System4 is involved in the game to explain some history.\n\nFled hybrid slaves work for their own freedom which causes a growing space piracy.\n\nEven under hybrids there are classes. Domesticated are seen as lesser.\n\nThere will be different species under hybrids, therefore, we will see multiple cultures and languages.\n\nThe story focus is about hybrids which are fighting for their freedom, to get accepted as equal.\n\nThe story should feature important characters which drive the story(Ancel mentioned, a similar way Zelda does). Characters from the first BGE1 should be somehow involved.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the game goes with \"story across generations\".\n\nSpaceships and Vehicles\n\nSeems like we start with lowend space tuk-tuk^^\n\nYou will be able to fly around in your spaceship keep your small spaceship at the time you are getting a bigger one. It will be parked in the bigger one.\n\nBigger spaceships can be considered home or garage of the player, customizable with e.g. trophies (Who doesn't like a moving base?)\n\nWe have seen spins, loopings and even drift as possible maneuvers.\n\nVehicles each have 5 velocity settings, e.g. ranging from 10 to 120 km/h for the jetpack. The acceleration between these is dependent on the \"character attributes\" of the vehicle. Overall speeds may range from 4 to 1 million km/h. (This has only been observed so far.)\n\nGoing into atmospheres too fast may cause you to burn up\n\nThere will be dogfights coming.\n\nWe will get racing again. yay\n\nShips can be shut down so the player has to escape the ship before it crashes.\n\nShips have the ability to follow another if you want that (fly in a formation).\n\nYou can enter enemy ships.\n\nModular ships so you can change appearance and traits.\n\nThere will be Mammago \"Stations\" for your ships.\n\nFear of empty planets?\n\nAncel asured us he wants the planets to be alive.\n\nThere will even be submarine exploration.\n\nAlso there should be active trading between cities(including people/slaves to some extend).\n\nAncel mentioned that all the cities or other places of interest/quest relevance are designed from the ground up, not procedurally generated.\n\nAncel actually referenced Dwarf Fortress as an inspiration (for generation of places). Ancel also said: \"We have some techniques that allow us to populate the planet in a logical way,\" In fact, they have full control over the generation of the worlds.\n\nThey use generation and hand-made content. It would almost be impossible for the devs to fully make all those structures themselfs or very time-consuming at the targeted scale.\n\nGlobal Scale Effects\n\n\"Exploration will span the galaxy, as the developers want players to zip across planets from city to city and fly from planet to planet.\"\n\nImportant to know here is that the game takes place in one Solar-System, not the galaxy.\n\nSpace debris falling on the surface causes effects(Population will be on the safe side of planets).\n\nThe surface will be affected by those and therefore seem to be modifying it in real time.\n\nSince the game runs a whole simulated Solar-System, day and night cycle are a natural cause of this.\n\nHaving a Crew\n\nWe know you will be able to have a crew with the mediumship.\n\nThose people may join you or not based on your actions.\n\nAlso those people may leave you due to some actions you may perform in the future.\n\nThe Crew will improve your ship statistics(depending on their skills). Find a good combination.\n\nAncel mentioned it would be way more realistic to win crewmembers with for example a card game.\n\nCombat\n\nMelee combat does have dodge with Jetpack, a drop-down attack and normal hits it seems.\n\nSome enemies are able to block incoming attacks while other may have healing abilities.\n\nCombat can be outside and inside ships.\n\nThe Jetpack adds a layer of complexity.\n\nCombat can happen anywhere. As mentioned by Ancel on the clip of the second SpaceMonkeyReport\n\nThey want to keep the same DNA which probably hints to the classic BGE1 one-button combat or rather close to it.\n\nUse of guns were shown with augmentations \"perks\" which for example slow enemies or put them into full stasis temporarily.\n\nImportant Characters\n\nKNOX Hybrid monkey who is always looking for trouble\n\nZHOU YUZHU Hybrid pig, pretentious collector and ruthless crime boss\n\nLI DAIYU Rejuvenated madam who runs Zhou's backrooms\n\nSHANI Badass biker and ingenious mechanic of Somalian ancestry\n\nDAKINI The very mysterious Captain of the Gada...\n\nPEY'J The cook of the Gada and famous for his Space-Chili\n\nCALLUM Ship mechanic of the Gada\n\nGADA AI You know. This is a smart speaking ship. It is like Kitt in Space I guess\n\nUMA Chief Medic of the Gada\n\nHSING-HSING It is a Panda with tea\n\nKIM HYUN-JUN A Tiger who survives with participating in daily blood sports\n\nJADE Standing against the crew of the Gada on the side of Alpha-Sections\n\nALPHA SECTIONS They are back! With some really beefed up armor it seems\n\nMedia\n\nMore here\n\nGet The Latest Space Monkey News:\n\nThere are so much more information in the original thread, check it out if you're interested. I'll add more information here when I find one, gradually."
