Don't think I'd encounter most of these problems if I was replaying the game.\n\n1) I like cameras that follow you. I like Resident Evil 1-3 style cameras. I don't like when they switch between the two constantly.\n\n2) During some sections (stealth or maybe crouching) the camera would either drop to the floor and look at your ass OR fly in the air and focus on your hair. In both cases you have limited visibility of what's in front of you. It was impossible to set it in between those two extremes. If you try that it's gonna spaz up and down.\n\n3) There were at least 2 dozen times when I was running away from an enemy I didn't want to fight or was trying to get out of a cave when the camera would suddenly (*imagine me snapping my fingers*) switch 180 degrees and make me run into enemies. One particular spot made me carefully tiptoe forward till the camera switched and then press the opposite direction and tiptoe there.\n\n4) The main problem for me is that the normal 3rd person camera seems to have been programmed into specific points of view. You can change it if you want to look around but for no reason in a particular spot you have to move your mouse 3 times across the mat to turn it.\n\n5) The boat.\n\nNot even gonna mention when the camera collides with objects or walls. I wish I recorded myself on a boat trying to find the secret entrance in Race 3. The camera was stuck looking back hitting walls, I was moving my mouse across the mat like 7 times, the camera kept moving back, then I pressed forward and... I mean honestly, it was kind of incredible how fucked up the camera got in that racetrack.\n\nFunny thing is, I had very similar (almost exact) problems with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Another Ubisoft game from 2003.\n\nCamera bitching aside the game was ok. Nothing I can say I really liked, except maybe photographing animals. But it was fine. It was a game.\n\nThe story didn't connect with me and some \"dramatic\" moments were either laughable or fell flat but the ending was great. The pig was annoying so when he suddenly gave you a disk with what I assumed were letters from dead parents and was immediately \"killed\" I actually burst out laughing. The only thing missing was him saying how he likes to live and has 2 days left until retirement. The knight that replaced him was funny. Enjoyed having him around. The kids being kidnapped had zero impact on me. I saw them once 7 hours ago, I have no idea who they are. The ending spider boss fight was cool, as was the final boss.\n\nThe combat was fine. I actually liked it more than stealth so I fought enemies instead of sneaking around them when possible. I had this super attack that can basically incapacitate every guard in the room if you're lucky. Unfortunately, I couldn't use it unless I was already detected, that kinda sucked.\n\nOoh, this is a small thing but I loved the design of the code entering device. That helix shaped thing was cool.\n\nIt was odd how you have to collect like 88 pearls and it seems like the game is huge, this is gonna take a long time, and then like 45 of them are in 4 places.\n\nBut yeah, overall it was okay. I wouldn't care for a sequel but I had some moderate amounts of fun playing it.\n\n6/10\n\nCompletion time: 8 hours 49 minutes.\n\n11 Yr s♥$✓#\n\nReplying to Monolight\n\nDad jokes aside the camera really was terrible.

Another Ubisoft game from 2003.\n\nThey actually use the same engine. If I remember right it was first made for BG&E and called the Jade Engine after the main character, then also used for PoP. I played BG&E on console, and the camera was mostly fine there for me. No worse than most other contemporary stuff anyway. I tried playing PoP on PC, and the camera and controls were a goddamn nightmare.\n\n10 Yr s✓#\n\nReplying to Monolight\n\nDad jokes aside the camera really was terrible.

I wouldn't care for a sequel but I had some moderate amounts of fun playing it.\n\n6/10\n\nCompletion time: 8 hours 49 minutes.\n\nThis was pretty much what I thought of the game, back when it came out. It was fine, I'm not sure what all the clamor for a sequel was about. Honestly I think it's because it had such an incredible twist/hook ending that would apparently never be resolved.\n\n7 Yr s♥$✓#\n\nJust finished it up, here are some quick thoughts.\n\n-Loved the code helix. Nice twist on something that doesn't get much variation\n\n-The ending fell flat for me a bit. Through the whole thing it was about loss and stuff and then everyone lives. I feel a more bittersweet ending would have felt more natural given the rest of the game, but maybe I can chalk that up to it originally intending to be the first of a trilogy? Perhaps with the 2nd and 3rd it wouldn't have had that effect but as a stand alone it felt like it through some things out for a happy ending.\n\n-On that note, I wish the sequels had actually happened. I want to know more about her and her parents and everything. So much was hinted at through the game.\n\n-Combat was meh. Stealth was okay. Favorite part of the stealth/combat was launching a gyro disk at enemies' packs from in hiding then doing the same to whoever came to help. Ended up with a room full of flailing enemies to pick off almost every time haha.\n\n-Photography was one of the better parts of the game.\n\n-Ended up getting every pearl since it was pretty easy. Most annoying one was that dumb shuffleboard-y game. Was going to get all the animals but didn't feel like backtracking through the Slaughterhouse lol.\n\nOverall it was a good game. Despite its flaws and more-or-less meh combat/stealth it tickled my fancy. Glad I finally played it. Also might have to bring Jade up now when people complain about how there are NEVER EVER any good female protags lol. I can see why it has a cult following and will be eagerly awaiting the prequel... even though it literally just started development...\n\n10 Yr s✓#\n\nReplying to PlushWraith\n\nBeat it last week, so might as well write something here as well. Overall I quite liked it, I felt like they did a pretty good job balancing the sillier moments with the more serious stuff. The ending was kinda weird, though not really bad per say. I also liked collecting the animal photos. The combat was fairly dull. The stealth was better, but still nothing special and I think I'd have liked playing it more with a controller.\n\nI don't understand what the cliffhanger is, I thought it wrapped everything up?\n\nWe never found out what the connection between Jade and the Domz was. That seemed to be a pretty big deal.\n\nSo I think you and Monolight both hit on what the big cliffhanger was. For the entire game Jade appears to be a more or less normal human with the power of photography, and then that ending happens.\n\nWhy does Jade have supernatural powers? Which also begs the question, did she inherit those powers from her parents? Who or what were her parents? And yes, what is her connection to the Doms? They mention at the end that they'd been hunting her for centuries. Huh? So Jade is a centuries old supernatural being?\n\nI just remember seeing that ending and yelling \"Wait what?! What does all that mean! You can't just end it without explaining any of that!\"\n\nAnd NinjaRic, that's actually really good to hear :) Since all of the questions revolve around Jade's past, a prequel is just the thing to give us some answers.\n\n10 Yr s♥✓#\n\nReplying to jmdoane42\n\nSo I think you and Monolight both hit on what the big cliffhanger was.

For a 13+ year old game, it holds up pretty well. There are some hints at its age, such as the auto-jump and the clunky game save method, but niggles aside I've really been enjoying the game so far. The two main highlights for me have been the soundtrack and the photography."
