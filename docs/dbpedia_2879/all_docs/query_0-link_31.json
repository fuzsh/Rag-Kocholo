        "text": "I have a strange history with this game. Back in 2003, I saw the ads in Gamepro and thought it looked interesting, but for whatever reason never thought to give it a chance. Probably because I was a poor high school student and blinded by love for existing franchises.\n\nFlash forward a few years. I currently major in Interactive Design and Game Development at the Savannah College of Art and Design, and about a year ago (give or take a few months) I took a course called Survey of Interactive Entertainment. The course was basically the history of gaming and interactive devices/peripherals, and critiquing a variety of games. Part of the latter involved actually playing the games in class. Well, the professor said that one of the games was going to be Beyond Good and Evil, and I managed to miss that class because I was an idiot and slept late. I was disappointed because I had already heard the game was good and critically acclaimed but sales were poor due to its competition.\n\nSo I was at Gamestop the other day checking out used games while my cousin was picking up a game she reserved, when I found Beyond Good and Evil in the Used PS2 games for $10. I had to get it, especially since it was only $7 because my cousin paid for it with her Gamestop Edge card.\n\nI really wish I had given this game a chance when it first came out in 2003 because I really love it. Even when certain elements of the game are reminiscent of other games (especially Metal Gear Solid), Beyond Good and Evil has this wholly unique feel to it. I think this is the only game I've played where a camera actually serves a practical purpose.\n\nThe story is good, even if it is relatively linear, and the characters are well-developed and interesting. Jade is probably the best female protagonist I've seen in years. She isn't busty and/or scantily-clad, nor is she motivated by her feelings for some guy she likes. She's in it for the oppressed people of Hillys. Pey'j and Double H are great comic relief, but manage to provide more than humor.\n\nThe item collecting, while integrated into the plot, doesn't feel forced and repetitive like Mario 64 and its clones which force you to go to the same level several times to get all of the objects. I actually like it more than most item quests because everything has a reward. A full roll of film gets you new Pearls and MDisks, and the Pearls are actually used for the vehicle upgrades you need to advance the plot.\n\nThe style of the game and the world of Hillys is whimsical yet serious, and feels very familiar. I want to say it reminds me of Don Bluth's work, maybe that's because he directed Titan A.E. which had talking anthropomorphic alien animals. It also reminds me a bit of Treasure Planet for mostly the same reason.\n\nI'm currently in the Slaughterhouse and am intrigued as to where the game is going after that. Obviously space, considering some of the blatant hints through the game, but there has to be some surprises. I don't know what's coming, but I have a bad feeling about the ending as I've heard it's abrupt due to plans for a trilogy that Ubisoft has abandoned.\n\nAnyone else like Beyond Good and Evil? Please tell me I'm not the only person here who does. And for the heck of it, who hasn't played, or even heard of it?\n\nActually I like the sneaking stuff. Shooting is easy, and got a little boring for me about a decade ago.\n\nI love the game, though it is a little on the short side. Well designed, great humor. I would love to see a \"Wii-ified\" version released with some control and content enhancements to see if the game could actually find the audience it deserves.\n\nMay I also recommend Psychonauts? Its another highly acclaimed title that failed to sell last gen. It is a solid platformer (there is collecting, but it is not essential to get the story) and flat out hysterical in a very twisted way. It may be my favorite game of the last generation (KOTOR, Jade Empire, Eternal Darkness and, of course, RE4 are the other contenders).\n\nI've gotten further into the Slaughterhouse and I have to say, I'm starting to like the sneaking a little more. I've gone through about three rooms that I found very challenging. Two of them I got killed in a few times, the third took only one try but it was a close one. The challenge involved created so much tension and it became fun. It doesn't get much more exciting than crouch-walking right behind a patrolling guard and diving into the hallway to safety, but drawing the guard's attention by triggering the door to the next room.\n\nAnd Psychonauts is another gem I've mostly learned of well after the fact. I heard of it when it got released, but didn't pay attention to it because it was only on X-Box and PC at the time (don't have the former, don't do much gaming on the latter). Wish I had paid attention to it when the PS2 version came out. I'm also kicking myself for not buying Okami when it came out, but I didn't have my PS2 with me while I was at school and was broke whenever I was home."
