        "text": "2D\n\nSure, these days have almost every game sporting the newfangled 3D, but way back when, everyone had to live with plain old 2D. 2D, or two dimensions, limit the game to scrolling backgrounds, but some games even now make use of this basic concept.\n\nAchievements\n\nAchievements are extra challenges added into video games that sometimes carry a point value or unlock bonus material, and are sometimes solely for bragging rights.\n\nAcrobatics\n\nThe ability to fling oneself around an environment gracefully. Wall-running, jumping, massive drops, climbing, and other physical activities are what acrobatics is all about.\n\nBoss Fight\n\nA boss fight is a culminating challenge that pits the player against one or more enemies representing a greater threat and/or difficulty than those previously faced. These scenarios typically feature unique antagonists.\n\nBuddy Throw\n\nSome cooperative games let the players pick up and toss each other around. Sometimes this serves a purpose, like killing an enemy or leap over a gap but most of the time it just serves as an aspiration to great assholery.\n\nDigital Distribution\n\nThe concept of purchasing media and having it delivered over the internet. No physical representation of this content is given, and although the content resides on the user's hard drive they are typically granted a license to the product, rather than ownership of it.\n\nDouble Jump\n\nA double jump is the ability to jump while already in mid-air to get some extra lift. In reality, double jumps are not possible and violate fundamental laws of physics.\n\nGames Based on Movies\n\nWhenever there's a new Pixar, superhero or Harry Potter movie they have to make one of these.\n\nGreatest Hits\n\nGreatest hits is a general term for re-releases of games which have sold a certain number of copies, as part of a program managed by the console manufacturer.\n\nIdle Animations\n\nAn Iconic concept of video games is the use of an idle animation for the players character, when during gameplay there's no control given. It's an example of emergent game design, and is used as a way to add depth to action characters.\n\nJade Engine\n\nGame engine developed by Ubisoft Montpillier with the involvement of Michel Ancel for Ubisoft games used on the Xbox, Gamecube, PS2 and PC. It was first introduced in 2003 with the release of Beyond Good & Evil (deriving it's name from, Jade, the main character of the game). It had since been used in several games of that generation.\n\nLicensed Game\n\nThese games are based off of established licenses, such as movies, comics, or TV shows. Examples are the James Bond 007 and Spider-Man franchises.\n\nMale Protagonists\n\nThis concept is for games in which at least one of the main characters is male.\n\nNinja\n\nLegendary, stealthy assassins from Japan's feudal era, who are well-trained in the art of the sword, and who may or may not have access to magical powers.\n\nNon-Five Achievements\n\nWhile most games feature achievements with gamerscore values in multiples of five, not all games do so.\n\nParkour\n\nParkour is a type of athleticism that involves going from point A to point B as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nPolice\n\nPolice are paid protectors who enforce the law through legal use of force. They are supposed to help ensure public safety and social order. Their motto is to protect and to serve."
