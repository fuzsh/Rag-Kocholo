        "text": "Yep.\n\nI did the Dragon's End meta just for exp earlier. I wondered around every corner of Kaening and Echovald the other day just out of boredom looking for little collection items or just trying events I hadn't done before. I was hoping I'd see something and be like, WOW. Instead I just wound up feeling like everywhere I went was a dead map or there was nothing to do but micro-events that aren't very engaging.\n\nThe story - the worst yet. The technical delivery of the story with the cut scenes, the camera effects like landing on Shing Jea - really cool. The story felt short but I think the issue was the subject matter. We have a bunch of characters we're focused on far too much at the beginning because they seem to be more keen on character building than the lore/mysticism/fantasy that originally drew me into the game.\n\nAs a veteran who has always been extremely intrigued by the elder dragon lore, having the chunk of the story dealing with Scarlett and Aetherblade nostalgia, Ankka who just... wants to be evil for the sake of being evil, and Joon who is just an amalgamation of Braham and Taimi or Li who is basically just another Caudecus with no real intrigue...\n\nThen to end the story the way it did, after only having minor interaction with her the entire time.. all these pre-existing interesting factions and lore from Cantha's past get swept aside or pushed to collection items in favor of jade tech. Not just jade tech but forced mount and combat golem training. If they wanted to do this I feel like they should have saved it for side events, compensated the story in other ways, or just went full in and made Tengu playable and incorporated this in a starting area. (Yes, the last part is unrealistic and I never expected it.)\n\nI also listen to Aurene's dialogue sometimes and it's like.. okay, this is cheesy af. Mainly the Dragon's End meta. And all I hear are the writers from guild chat putting their personality into Aurene. Even the voice and pronunciations sound... different to me for some reason.\n\nTo me, it feels like the devs listened to feedback and fanfiction, made a list, and then threw it together last minute in their best attempt to push out an expansion. And I respect them for that given the pressure they've likely been under for the past few years, covid, and all the other obstacles they've faced. Development, deadlines, crunch time... is stressful beyond belief...\n\nThat being said I think what they chose to focus on, how they made things fit, and the general plot of the story mixed with the masteries that seem to only exist to sell gemstore skins or in the case of the jade bot, for now, simply a way to provide jewelcrafters a way to make their craft useful again...\n\nI don't know. I've always been a huge fan and passionate about the game. My love for the game, their ideals and emphasis on inclusion and representation are what inspired my career change. Tyria and this game has got me through nearly a decade of severe depression and isolation.\n\nBut I'm afraid this expansion severely misses the mark for me. Maybe it's stress, maybe it's the fact that I'm getting older.. maybe it's just that I don't have the time that I used to and can't enjoy the small things the way I used to but I feel like their design decisions since IBS have really left me feeling disconnected from the game.\n\nI think the thing that bothers me most about their development process and releases is that they never seem to learn from the past. It's extremely inconsistent. Take these new crafting items for example, how many times have they retroactively added something to material storage because of player complaints about inventory clutter. Yet every release they do it again, and again, and again. That's only one MINOR inconsistency that really doesn't even bother me that much. Sometimes I think they try a little too hard to reinvent the wheel and they're more focused on doing things differently than they've done in the past than doing things that are beneficial to the player or gameplay.\n\nI've spouted a lot of hate about this expansion since release and I'm not trying to devalue the work they put into this expansion or the journey they've been through to get here. I'm just frustrated, because as you said, they had SO much potential just because of the location alone.\n\nI get that things will have changed over the past 250 years and resources are too tight to do the story they'd probably LIKE to tell, but I I've suffered through the story twice and I still don't even remember what I did in Echovald besides chat with people in Arborstone and battle Ankka. It's like we leave the reactor instance in Kaening and the story just takes this rushed nose dive towards the ending for the sake of \"being done\" with it.\n\nOn the plus side I think they're entering a brand new era and the pacing at the studio may be a little less hectic now so we might start seeing them get their bearings back again. I know it's been tough and I think they've done a great job at listening to player feedback and making changes at a pretty rapid pace to address some quality of life issues in relation to the expansion but it would be nice if they would be a little more consistent.\n\nI love the story but I think there's just a lot of emphasis since IBS on trying to tell these elaborate character building stories and I'm sure some people are into that, but the story in EoD a little too disjointed the characters really weren't that interesting to me. But honestly, it's hard for me to get invested in new characters when we have Gorrik and Canach.\n\nI like skiffs but fishing annoys me so bad I rarely even use it, even with maxed masteries. I legit tried to catch a fish for like 30 minutes in Windswept yesterday and finally, after having the stupid bar bounce back and forth a dozen times a second I just couldn't keep up and gave up. Not really enjoyable or relaxing when I'm chasing some tiny bar tunnel visioning the screen and unable to appreciate the fact that I'm on my own boat, in a beautiful location somewhere. I don't really know what would improve it for me and it's mostly optional so it's not really a big deal but I think it might be worth spending some time revisiting this and finding a different approach that's more player friendly.\n\nThe elite specs - Harbinger, Specter, Willbender - all incredibly fun for me and Willbender doesn't feel THAT different from core guard with teleports or shiro rev but it is a very nice flowing spec with a great pace. The rest - lukewarm at best for me.\n\nI still think Catalyst just needs to be gutted and reworked into a new spec. It has a \"flow\" to it but if I'm going for melee bruiser, Weaver does the job much better and far more enjoyably.\n\nUntamed - I thought I would hate this and I'm not sure that it would be enjoyable without running very specific builds but it's still leagues better than Catalyst.\n\nI've always loved mesmer and thought it was one of the most unique classes in an mmo, but Virtuoso feels like an entirely different class and not in a good way. I think it plays fine, outside of the still incredibly awkward cast times on the elite and the shatters.. but I've tried condi grieving and viper, and power builds, and they just don't feel rewarding to me. It really just feels like I'm playing scepter ele but instead of channeling lightning on skill 1 I'm making long cast times for shatters.\n\nVindicator - honestly just boring for me in pve.\n\nMechanist - I haven't played around much but condi support seems to be a little more interesting than trying to run a power build. I think the biggest issue with this on me is that I feel like I'm just afk farming while my bot does everything for me and the mace skills, personally, feel a little out of place. I think I'd almost rather run rifle and auto or just use grenade kit.\n\nBladesworn - gunblade feels like a hot mess and I'm not a warrior main to begin with but this is probably the spec I would put directly above Catalyst on the bottom of the list. I think the whole root and dragon slash thing is just a little too... \"look at me I'm going super sayian isn't this cool?\" and it just doesn't really have a purpose outside of strikes and raids if you're running the max charge version. I think I've collected more deaths just trying to figure out how to use this class in any viable setting than I ever did playing on core ele.\n\nI'd say one of the biggest issues I've had with elite specs is that some of the weapon choices and skill choices on those weapons just feels out of place or separated from the identity of the spec. For some, like Virtuoso, I feel like it could have been better with an off hand dagger option or a longbow. Catalyst - Umm.. I don't know.. figure out what you actually want to do with the spec before designing weapon skills. Why am I a melee bruiser with mixed range weapon skills? And not just mixed ranger but a negligible 600 yards with, frankly, boring skills.. one slot of which is dedicated to this orb mechanic that expires too quickly, forces you to be in range to do damage despite it being a mixed ranger weapon, and don't even get me started on the \"jade sphere.\"\n\nThe other big issue with these elite specs - the utilities often feel either so overloaded they're mandatory or they're so useless you wind up with most slots using core.\n\nLast but not least - GUILD HALLS. I wasted a 100 gold ready to capture this place, couldn't find a group unlike previous expansions, tried solo'ing it and couldn't... and finally watched a video of someone exploring post catpure. Personally, it looks dull and tiny to me. I'm sure there are interesting decorating possibilities but it looks like they may be intentionally trying to design guild halls with little need to decorate as possible because, frankly, I feel like they're just tired of dealing with it.\n\nHere's the problem, if you're listening - It's an abandoned feature and I get it. It was what partially made me fall in love with the game and I've spent thousands of gold across three guild halls decorating and creating my own scenes, enjoying the sandbox life. But scribing is and always has been too expensive, guild upgrades have always been too expensive and grindy, and the actual decorating tool is TERRIBLE and always has been.\n\nIf you don't plan on expanding this feature, please for the sake of new players entering your game, make them affordable enough that even one person wanting a supplementary home instance can upgrade one to full restoration. Stop making convoluted scribe recipes and just sell the decorations from unique vendors throughout the world like you did during the Lake Doric release. Also, if you can't increase the decoration limit I believe that giving the decorating tool the ability to rotate axis, and adding somekind of arcing target ability with a tether indication and allowing people to place decorations without needing solid ground to place them on would be HUGE improvements to the system. Maybe there are technical limitations, maybe it's just not deemed worth the resources. But even after all these years this feature still has potential, but some of that potential may not be worth the effort until you make them more affordable.\n\nGuild content in general - for an expansion with siege turtles and strike mission focus, there is yet to be a single new guild mission related to either of the new game types Path of Fire or End of Dragons introduced. Guild missions, if I'm not mistaken, haven't been updated since core. I suspect this is probably some legacy code issue and I totally get it, but if you have the time and resources and are looking for community engaging teamwork based ways to improve the game over this expansion, maybe this would be a good place to start putting some of that innovative thinking in.\n\nI know this is a wall of text nobody will read, but I'll drop it here because I haven't given Arenanet my 2 cents yet today. Despite it all I'm not very technically saavy or \"hip\" and am too lazy to google the markup so I'll just put *laughing crying emjoi\".\n\nTo a new beginning and smoother sailing ahead!"
