After a desperate struggle to defend her island, a Hyllian named Jade collapses in exhaustion - only to be tormented by disturbing visions.

When a rebel organization reinforces her doubts, Jade begins a harrowing journey to get to the core of the conspiracy.\n\nArmed with her camera, aikido staff, and resolute investigative skills, Jade sets out to expose the truth and to liberate the minds of her deceived people. Pushed to the very edge of her physical and spiritual will, she soon discovers that even these limits are not what they seem ... Her quest for the truth knows no bounds.\n\nFeatures:\n\nFLUID GAMING EXPERIENCE: Enter a riveting new era of gaming, where diverse gameplay styles blend into one uniquely fluid and immersive experience - powered by the innovative JADE game engine\n\nAN EPIC STORY OF TRUTH & DECEPTION: Plunge into a mysterious, gripping saga where nothing is as it seems and unravelling the truth is the only hope of restoring freedom.\n\nLEAD THE REBELLION: Fight using stealth, force, and wits against the only reality you have ever known. You must stop at nothing until the perpetrators are exposed.\n\nBOUNDLESS, AWE-INSPIRING WORLDS: Journey through the reaches of a strange and ever-changing universe - a place beyond earthly imagination that spans the galaxy and mines the very soul of Jade herself.\n\nFROM THE CREATOR OF THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED RAYMAN FRANCHISE: Created by Michel Ancel, Project BG&E is his latest masterpiece - a title in development for the past 3 years.\n\nSource: ubi.com"
