        "text": "So it does still exist. I’m really unsure how I feel after the trailer they dropped. I’m disappointed that it’s a prequel, and the realistic artstyle isn’t working for me. Also, what the heck is up with the ridiculous amount of profanity they’ve been throwing around? I feel kind of scarred.\n\nSo does anyone think this will actually come out this time or will it vaporize again?\n\nYeah, the swearing is kind of off-putting…Kind of out of place from the first game. Well, besides that, I really like the aesthetic of the world Ancel has created here. It’s like a living breathing Angkor Wat!\n\nI don’t know…I don’t usually care for prequels as they are always forced to connect to the source material in the end. Sometimes this can limit the creative direction. And sometimes that can be a disaster, if done incorrectly or can just ruin what the first game alluded to entirely. But, this is the second game in the series, so there is a lot to build upon.\n\nAs far as a release: please don’t turn into a Last Guardian scenario!..Also, he said it was going to be online? Can we please just have a standalone off-line game separate from the online features!!!\n\nTo tell you the truth, I think the Switch will last at least 6 years, 7 at the most. So that’s the release window we have. See you in 10 ha, ha!!!\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nMaking it seem more grown up increases the likelihood of better sales (since adults are the ones with cash). Whereas a superficial look at the original Beyond Good & Evil might lead one to perceive it as a children’s game. Ubisoft obviously expect to make money off BG&E2, otherwise it wouldn’t happen.\n\nThat said, I’m not how I feel about this new direction. Perhaps others who have played the original all the way through can comment about whether this is an acceptable compromise.\n\nThe direction and aesthetics as far as the world is concerned, is spot on. And what you would expect continuing the themes and art direction of the first game. The Angkor Wat-like city is definitely something you’d see in this universe.\n\nFrom what I\"ve seen, character personality is comparable to the first game. I mean the pig, monkey, and girl all had their own distinct personalities. I didn’t feel like anything felt forced or wooden (apart from the profanity, but adult audience an all now…) Jade and Pey’j both felt like they had flowing organic personalities. I hope these characters do as well. No forced dialogue or contrived humor. The monkey escaping through the roof after giving the pig a chocolate idol was pretty hilarious, after his potty mouth talk!\n\nGameplay? Well, they mentioned online…So if there isn’t a single player narrative and we are playing a subscription fee-themed online game. That is incredibly disappointing…We’ll just have to wait and see until they show the first gameplay footage.\n\nI don’t know what is about more modern games, but the photorealism coupled of the artwork feels like it makes it LESS immersive for me, than many games in the past. I just don’t feel invited into these world as before. I dunno if I’m just getting old or what…\n\nCompared to that first trailer and gameplay footage for this game, featuring Pey’j and Jade…this does not grab me at all. Obviously it’s CG, so the in-game graphics and style might make a bit different but…I’m not feeling it.\n\nI read this article on the game https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15801280/beyond-good-evil-2-preview-michel-ancel-interview-e3-2017 and it seems the whole premise is vastly different than the first game.\n\nI’m not sure about game developers ability to make compelling narratives in games that feature coop and branching story aspects. This game sounds like an action/adventure Mass Effect kind of game…set in BG&E universe. Hmmm…we’ll see\n\nThere is an ign article that talks about you creating either a human or hybrid character. You will then be able to amass a bunch of pirates (all unique to your game session) and travel from the ground, to the other side of the planet, and into space all seamlessly, without loading times.\n\nThey talked about how you would get random side characters, serving as your main party, who could do different things (have different skills, perform certain tasks), aside from the fixed story characters.\n\nThis game is still at least 3 years off, by the way. They said they aren’t even past the planning/tech demo stage of development yet…!\n\nBG&E is still one of my all-time favorite games. My first impressions of the trailer weren’t good. The profanity and breast jiggling may give the impression of a more mature game, but personally I found it has the reverse effect. The original BG&E is as much of a kid’s game as, for example, Zelda. This is something entirely different and not necessarily more mature. On its own, this is a great trailer, but as a sequel (actually a prequel, curiously named BG&E 2) to BG&E I’m not sure what to think about this. On the other hand, what’s retained is the multi-cultural influences and diverse cast. That’s really the only thing that reminded me of BG&E.\n\nUltimately, it’s clear fans of the original need to set aside their initial expectations and accept this as a totally different game. It’s probably the most ambitious game I’ve ever seen, what they’re trying to do seems impossible. I remember when No Man’s Sky was unveiled, thinking it would be impossible for the game to deliver on its promise. Now, Ancel is basically making a game that’s supposed to be a combination of Star Citizen, Mass Effect and No Man’s Sky. I hope they succeed. The CGI trailer alone must have been incredibly costly."
