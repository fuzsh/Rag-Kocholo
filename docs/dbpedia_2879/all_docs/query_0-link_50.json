        "text": "Awesome, I'm really glad to hear that this is a good remaster. I will 100% be getting this then! Not a bad price too all things considered! I thought Ubisoft was going to price it a good bit higher than that.\n\nAnother year another load remasters etc.\n\ntodays remaster headlines.\n\nMickey and his paint brush\n\nLuigi mansion 2, boo\n\nBeyond this and that.\n\nAt least the second half of the year looks new.\n\nYeah, I will get it at some point. I would love to play this again all these years later.\n\nThat being said, I think it is important that people new to the game realize what they are getting here. It is a game from a different time in gaming when expectations for what made a narrative single player game special may not be the same as today.\n\nI think if you took all the resources of all these remasters etc over 2023 and 2024.\n\nYou could make the most amazing new ip that would blow every AAA game out of the water.\n\n@OldGamer999\n\nI think if you took all the resources of all these remasters etc over 2023 and 2024.\n\nYou could make the most amazing new ip that would blow every AAA game out of the water.\n\nPerhaps, but I bet the collective revenue from all those remasters combined is much higher than what that one game would bring in.\n\nI won't be buying - I have the OG version which I believe is playable via BC if I actually wanted to return to it. I thought it was 'OK' at best 20yrs ago but likely to find it very dated today.\n\nIt's good that people can play it for the 'first' time but as I've played as much as I would want to play, I'm unlikely to buy a new version...\n\nI’d like an actual comparison of the BC HD version to the new one to know if it’s really worth the upgrade.\n\nA damn shame your site doesn’t seem to be reviewing it. We need a review from an Xbox point of view.\n\n@awp69 It looks good! There are some videos on youtube and they went and retextured the clothes, skin, and even some of the effects like the sky and space.\n\nThey said that the lighting was also redone, but that part looked pretty much the same as the HD version.\n\nThat being said, even though I'm buying the game again, I can see why someone would be happy with the original. The changes are cool, but since the gameplay and animation is the same, unless you have the two versions playing side by side you might not notice the differences."
