        "text": "Swarm: This game owns. It's a bit of an Xbox sacred cow for those SB folks in da know. I mean, it's basically a Japanese Half-Life and Halo clone, but with an absolutely insane Japanese sci-fi story and totally ludicrous first-person fighting system. Interestingly enough, it actually does a few things that Half-Life 2 would also do, but a year earlier. Things such as driving in large outdoor areas, an AI companion named Alex who accompanies you through most of the game and a bunch of cutscenes that play out within the environment. I recommend playing on Easy if you're just checking out this game to see its insanity. The combat in the game is enjoyable when frustration is at a minimum. There's this move in the game that they never tell you about when you press both triggers to slide into an enemy which stuns them, then immediately pressing the right trigger again sending them flying half way across the room with an uppercut. On Easy this is enough to one-shot kill most enemies and it feels awesome every time you do it.\n\nNi Go Zero Ichi: Campaign has aged astonishingly well. It feels like the missing link between classic and modern shooters, in the sense that it combines the best aspects of both and comes out ahead for it: you've got regenerating and limited health, levels that have well-paced linear progression but are also huge and (somewhat) open-ended, weapons that feel hefty and strategic but also aren't rendered boring and samey by pointless devotion to realism. Every single enemy, weapon and vehicle type looks and feels immediately distinct and fills a vital strategic niche in the combat system. The game engine is so delicately tweaked and balanced it's no wonder the campaign and multiplayer are equally beloved. The Anniversary/Master Chief Collection edition fucks up the game's art direction to such a spectacular degree that I can't believe someone allowed it, but also you can toggle back to the original visuals in up-res'd widescreen with the press of a button so who cares really.\n\nNi Go Zero Ichi: Not really as good as the first game, and ironically feels like it's aged a little worse due to having early iterations of things that have since become smoothed out genre staples (e.g. dual wielding, true regenerating health, etc.). The campaign sort of tries to introduce too much new stuff at once - mechanically and narratively - and quickly loses focus. There are also a few more segments which are kinda slogs. It's still very good though, faster paced and more streamlined (for better or worse) and capable of holding its own against most contemporary shooter campaigns. The Anniversary edition actually looks good this time.\n\nelvis.shrugged: JSFR…I find hard to recommend. I loved the original JSR, a lot. It's one of my favorite games ever, and JSFR just reeks of “missed opportunity.” They took the urgency of the original—the time limits, the arcade-styled scoring system, the cops always chasing you—and replaced it with an exploration game. Hence, there is no urgency. The cops have been boxed in, and can't chase you (!!!). You no longer hurriedly twist the analog stick to create graffiti. In addition to that, the graphics have this very washed out and blurred look compared to the crisp, clean lines of JSR. Even the soundtrack pales compared to JSR's!\n\nDecinoge: Cheesy doesn’t even begin to describe this game. It’s ridiculous turned all the way up to 15. Loved every little bit of terrible voice and real live acting (found on the credits they were actually 2 completely different things). I have to admit this was one of the funniest one and half hours I’ve had in the last month or so. I can’t really say I’ll play the game again. Might do so to get better scores. But that one time was amazing. I’ll probably consider one of the best “one offs” I’ve ever played.\n\ndmauro: It won't be readily apparent that this is a good game, but if you stick with it for a little bit (my Dad got me playing this one and kept making me playing it with him) you'll realize it's really got something going on. The one thing that I haven't been quite able to enjoy is that you kind of need to memorize the courses and they are decently long, but they give you enough laps that you might be able to memorize it before you get to the end of the final lap.\n\nIt's far from the best game, but it runs in widescreen and hi-def, and you'll feel really awesome when you firgure out just the right amount of air to get on a series of jumps so that you clear them with the least amount of up and down as possible.\n\nNi Go Zero Ichi: Still the best game in its genre imo. Compared to DMC there's less emphasis on racking up style points and combos and more about just straight-up surviving every encounter. Years before Souls came along, control and movement is so fine-tuned and precise (almost nothing is automated and there's no mechanic even remotely resembling a QTE) and the level design is so nice and playground-y (with mild Metroidvania elements, even) you feel like you have an incredible amount of control in how you tackle the game's imposing challenges. The character models are gorgeously animated and the art direction is good, so it looks better than most games of its era too. The only thing that hasn't aged gracefully is the camera.\n\nSwarm: From Software on that Japanese acid-mythology tip, with airborne combo-based combat like out of some god darned Dragon Ball manga. Has a great atmosphere with oddly sinister art and music. Wailing on an enemy and sending them flipping across the map crashing through a bunch of destructible buildings is some good shit. Otogi 2 is the better game. It has more mission variety and more generals to play as, plus a whole bunch of unlockables. I played through the entire game again just to unlock a cool outfit for Seimei, your shinto priest lookin' princess badass. Otogi 2 is also one of (if not THE!?) prettiest games on the Xbox.\n\nAnother Coma: I thought the form changing was unneccesary, stupid, and not fun. Then I hit the second and third episodes, where it totally began to make sense. You must always be conscious of what form you're in to do well (to survive, even!) Is it heavy handed to assume the player should know what form to be in? Maybe, but this is a Rail Shooter for crying out loud. Even then, form-changing is not always a formula, really. You have to be clever if you want to upgrade the not oft-used but very useful Glide Wing, for instance.\n\nI actually loved the approach to boss encounters, coming (rather recently) off of Zwei. Every boss battle seems to be constructed from the assumption that the player has A) Finished Zwei and B) thought the final encounter in Zwei was the bee's knees. Because just about every serious fight in Orta has that much effort evident in its design. I'll concede that this approach was probably unneccesary for the first couple of episodes, but that never really bothered me. Although the bosses are heavily armored, I realized at around the midpoint of the game that nearly all of them can be defeated before they begin to loop their attack pattern, provided you have become intimate with the capabilities of each form my then. If you haven't, well, you probably spent most of the time in Base Wing.\n\nThe music, though. It started out good, and then they rewrote the same piece over and over and over until it faded into the background. Oh well!\n\nBotageL: That game is very special to me. It came along at just the right time, and created just the right mood, to carve out a very particular place in my heart. It's a game about playing games, and it does it wearing a warm smile. Battles flow so well; you build a rhythm, ambushing opponents who you've yet to defeat in this arena, blasting any of a number of odd and energetic songs purchased at the local record shop from your robot's stereo. By the time you're ready to start challenging the reigning champions of each area, you feel like you've trained yourself to be the baddest non-lethal robot fighter around. The localization is the sort of spotty, but good-natured translation which has largely been done away with, and gives the game a bit of whimsy.\n\nIt also has really cool robot and world design. I love how this game looks.\n\nNeoEsZ: the most underrated game I've ever played in my life. This game should have gotten a sick amount of attention. Some of the best style implemented in any video game ever. If you're a fan of the setting of Midgar in final fantasy 7, you'll love this one. The game play is essentially a card game in disguise, but you won't know it until someone points it out. Really challenging at parts and overall engaging. The enviroment, story, and graphics work so well with eachother that the end result is something euphoric.\n\nIntentionally Wrong: People bag on Psychonauts for being “just another platformer” but they were too caught up being offended by the routine to notice what an odd fusion Psychonauts really is. It's got the hub design of Mario Sunshine but the levels are all over the map: several are traditional platforming action, others are more about adventure game sensibilities. Every level has some unifying characteristic that makes it unique, though: one level has you combining scripts and scenery with mood-lighting on a stage to create different platform configurations; another involves personally recruiting and deploying units in a strategy board game against Napoleon Bonaparte. Taken together with the brilliant writing, Psychonauts becomes one of my top three games of all time.\n\nVictor: Rallisport Challenge 2 is a pretty sweet game. One of the best 'in-cockpit' experiences available. Visceral. Night driving is of special note. Huge front-mounted lighting rigs beaming spotlights a couple feet in front…trying to make sense of all the boulders and twigs and dirt zipping by. Visuals kind of suffer from the kind of n64-ish pallette-blandness (that seems to be prevalent on the Box) at times, but they get the job done at the very least. Often they are quite nice. It forgoes hardnosed simulation: they went with something rooted somewhere much closer to reality than say NFS, Burnout, Outrun etc. but still slip-slidey and loosey goosey and fun and shit. The interface, soundtrack…the non-gameplay ambiance is decidedly American-Developed Xbox Game, so that may or may not be a little superficially offputting; but the core of this game is rock solid and a good time. Makes you wish it was on a system with, I don't know, say, support for Logitech's Driving Force Pro (PC Port? I think so. But still)\n\nSwarm: A bunch of Bungie people left after Halo and made this neat microgame you can finish in about 3 hours. You eat the brains of enemies to build up a zombie posse who then also swarm onto other enemies. You have a bunch of zombie powers including detaching your arm to strategically possess enemies, such as snipers and rocket infantry. Has a neat retro-50s artstyle with remixed 50s tunes. Feels like one of the last games before the 7th gen dark age where you could make a smallish AA game and sell it for $60. A nightmare to get working on PC nowadays, your best bet is the Xbox version."
