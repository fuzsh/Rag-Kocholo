        "text": "Beyond Good and Evil 2 made a big splash at E3 last week when a spectacular cinematic teaser made a surprise appearance at the end of Ubisoft's press event. But there was no actual gameplay on display, and creator Michel Ansel later said that the project was on \"day zero of development,\" despite many prior years of promises that it was \"still in development.\" But based on the \"in-engine demo\" video released today, I'd say his characterization of the current state of the game is pretty much on the money.\n\nTechnologically, the demo looks fantastic. The player's home base is a 400-meter mothership that can deploy a smaller shuttlecraft, from which characters can depart and fly around—like \"Russian dolls,\" as Ancel put it. It promises full planetary simulation with different biomes, and even details like atmospheric friction that causes a halo effect around ships when they depart or reenter the atmosphere.\n\nAncel also demonstrates planetary-scale deformation with \"real-time giant meteorites, asteroids, falling and modifying the planet's ground.\" And this isn't just a mechanical feature, but also central to the game's story: Once meteors start to strike the planet, the corporations send in slaves to harvest the minerals they deposit—an extremely dangerous job. \"There are a lot of slaves dying [while] trying to gather the meteorite's goods ... They are taking those rare materials, risking their life,\" Ancel says in the video. \"So it's not just about the planet on one side and the story on the other one. The planet and the story are connected. That's a very important thing for us.\""
