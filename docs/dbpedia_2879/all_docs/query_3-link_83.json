        "text": "Ubisoft has finally satiated the ravenous appetites of clamouring franchise fans tonight with the world premier trailer of a new Beyond Good & Evil game, most likely a follow up to designer Michel Ancel's much beloved action adventure game released in 2003.\n\nIntroduced by the company's CEO Yves Guillemot at today's Ubidays 2008 event in Paris, the untitled game was described as Ancel's latest project. What was stunning about the gorgeous trailer was that it utilized the game's impressive in-game engine.\n\nOpening with a view of two moons, the camera panned down to reveal a barren desert landscape, little to be seen aside from clumps of gnarled trees and a broken-down vehicle. On the bonnet sits a mysterious figure, obscured by a bright red parasol, sheltering from the sun. Actually, we say mysterious, but it's obvious to anyone who's played Beyond Good & Evil that this female character is most likely Jade, the first game's main heroine and protagonist.\n\nAs the camera continues to plunge down to the ground - pausing to display the title '1. The Pig' - suggesting that we'll probably be seeing more of these little buggers in the future, right up to the reveal of you-know-who, a pool of oil collects beneath the car's hover-wheels. A laser spanner (yes, we're kind of making these terms up now) is strewn in the muck and we're slowly introduced to the form of a sleeping pig, most likely your lovable talking pig companion, Pey'J.\n\nIt's probably worth mentioning at this point that although the trailer featured nothing to explicitly confirm this as a Beyond Good & Evil game, even the most half-witted idiot could probably feel rightly confident in their conclusion based on simple deduction alone. Anyway - yes that pig and some business with a fly before the camera pulls away and the image fades. The trailer flatly refusing to put a name to what we've just seen but leaving us in little doubt that the follow-up we've all been waiting for is tantalizingly close to reality.\n\nIf Guillemont's claims about the trailer using the in-game engine are true, then we're in for an absolutely astonishing treat somewhere down the line.\n\nNo word on what systems the game will appear on yet, but to tide you over for now, here are some screens of the beauty."
