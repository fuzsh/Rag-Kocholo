This?!\n\nThis game with it's terrible controls boring combat and frustrating sections and one of the worst cameras in the history of video games is considered one of the greatest games of all time?! I don't get it. I just don't get it. I don't get why Style so completely trumps Substance in so many people's eyes. Yes, this game has Style in spades. The art design is good. The characters are good. The story is good. The dialogue is good. This has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. All that is great and if this were a movie, then that would be enough, but this is NOT a movie. This is a game and the actual gameplay sucks balls. The controls are awkward. The combat is terribly dull. The difficulty of the game ranges from mind-numbingly easy to so difficult that I want to tear my own eyes out and eat them and it flips back and forth between the two extremes like a pendulum. And then there's the camera. That piece of crap camera. That bastard camera that was crafted in the pits of Hell. The only games I can think of that I've played with worse cameras are 'Resident Evil' on the Playstation and 'Super Mario 64'. It's so awful. My throat is literally hoarse from screaming \"I CAN'T SEE! I CAN'T ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SEE!\" at this game over and over time after time.\n\nWhy is it that games get such a pass on bad gameplay just because they're pretty? So many times I've played a game because people go on and on about how wonderful and magnificent it is and I'm smacked by a game full of frustration and awful design. 'Oh, but it's pretty and it has a great story so it's the greatest game ever and if you don't like it then you're a stupid dummy poo poo head'. No. Video games are GAMES and games need good gameplay. They need good controls. They need good cameras. The players need to be able to see what the hell is going on. This game has a lot of good things about it, but, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s got some really bad parts that people just seem to ignore just because the soundtrack is good."
