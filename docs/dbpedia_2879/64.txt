Games using a version of Ubisoft's proprietary JADE game engine. It was first used in Beyond Good & Evil and has the same name as that game's main character. The engine's flexibility allows for different gameplay sequences, displaying graphics as far as you can see them, and both detailed cinematics and gameplay. The engine was originally developed at Ubisoft Montpellier, and has been upgraded and fine-tuned for later games.
