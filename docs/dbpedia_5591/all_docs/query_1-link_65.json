        "text": "It’s over between Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman.\n\nThe “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star filed for divorce from her husband Monday after nearly nine years of marriage.\n\nTMZ reported that Sidora, 37, submitted her petition at 1:10 p.m., beating Pittman, 40, to the Gwinnett County courthouse in Georgia by 61 minutes.\n\nPittman’s own documents were stamped at 2:11 p.m., signaling that the divorce is already contentious.\n\nIn fact, the estranged couple can’t even agree on when they separated: Sidora listed Feb. 23, while Pittman said Feb. 19.\n\nBoth parties did, however, concede that their union is “irretrievably broken,” according to the outlet, with the Bravolebrity adding that she “reserves the right to add additional ground for divorce” if the pair cannot amicably reach a settlement.\n\nPage Six has reached out to Sidora for comment.\n\nThe “Game” star and Pittman said “I do” in August 2014.\n\nThey share two children: son Machai, born in June 2015, and daughter Aniya, whom they welcomed in February 2018. The actress also has an older son, Josiah, 11, from a previous relationship.\n\nThe filings come just two weeks after Sidora helped celebrate her husband’s 40th birthday with an elaborate bash.\n\n“#itsAParty #Happy40th,” she captioned a video last month.\n\nThe pair’s marital woes were well documented on the hit Bravo series, with the “That’s So Raven” alum revealing at one point that she had stopped wearing her wedding ring.\n\n“At first, mine wasn’t fitting after the babies. And then as I lost weight, we were having some issues. So I just never put it [back on]. I stopped wearing it,” she told her castmates and their husbands during an episode that aired in May 2022.\n\n“I should be wearing it. I’m sorry. But at marriage counseling that we just had, we made an agreement which, so, for 30 days, we can’t … argue, attack each other, disrespect.”\n\nIn the episode, Sidora’s co-star Kandi Burruss also asked the couple for an update about Pittman’s former female assistant, who offered him a massage in an allegedly flirty text exchange.\n\n“I had to fire the assistant, you know?” Pittman said, to which his wife responded, “Emotionally, I’m still dealing with the fact that we were even dealing with another woman, you know, and even that conversation.”\n\nSidora’s fellow “Housewives” certainly didn’t hide the fact that they weren’t Pittman’s biggest fans, as Kenya Moore said she finds Pittman to be an “a—hole.”\n\n“See, let me say this to you right now. If my husband said that to me, I would flip this table over because that is so disrespectful,” she explained, drawing comparisons to her estranged husband, Marc Daly.\n\nMoore continued, “That would piss me the f—k off if somebody said that to me to my face — especially if I’m hurting. Do you not understand that? You’re tearing her down.”\n\nDespite their ups and dows, Sidora told BET last summer that the pair planned to continue working on their relationship.\n\n“I thought it was like Cinderella, like a happily ever after, and so we thought that’s what it was going to be,” she said.\n\n“My parents who have been married for like 60 years made it look so easy. I’m in a situation where we have children, we’re moving to a new city — life is happening and people are growing as well as changing.”\n\nShe added, “It’s hard because sometimes you’re like, ‘Do I need to stay in this marriage or am I better off by myself?’ Then I think to myself, when two people commit and you keep committing to each other, what can we do to fix this?”"
