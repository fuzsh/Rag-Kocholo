        "text": "Oop! Roomies, Drew Sidora and her ex-husband Ralph Pittman separated over a year ago, but they still live together!\n\nRELATED: ‘Let’s Be Real’: Ralph Pittman Says Drew Sidora Asking Him To Adopt Her Oldest Child Was A ‘Money Grab’\n\nDrew & Ralph Still Share The Same House\n\nIn an exclusive interview with PEOPLE, Drew Sidora updated fans on her situation with ex-husband Ralph Pittman. The ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ star revealed that their legal battle remains unresolved, and they continue to live under the same roof.\n\n“I didn’t even know that could happen. I was like, What?’ But yeah, he is living in the basement, and that was court-ordered,” Drew explained.\n\nDrew Sidora said living with Ralph has been challenging, and it would be much easier if they had separate spaces.\n\n“We’re kind of like, the blueprint for a s**t show divorce. It’d be much easier if we were able to move on separately; you know, out of sight, out of mind, with your own space and your own energy. But that’s clearly not in the cards. So sharing space has been a double whammy,” Drew stated.\n\nMore Details About Their Divorce\n\nPEOPLE reports that Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman separated in February 2023 after eight years of marriage. The next month, they filed for divorce within an hour of each other.\n\nDrew explained that their legal battle has been marked by disputes and delays due to ongoing claims and court schedules, which have contributed to the slow progress.\n\n“When you’re dealing with someone who wants everything and is just not willing to walk away with what he came in with, it makes it very, very hard. So I’m just learning how this process can go in the worst-case scenario. And I’m taking it literally one day at a time,” Sidora explained.\n\nAs The Shade Room previously reported, fans watched Drew and Ralph’s divorce unfold in the season 15 finale of ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta.’\n\nThe episode highlighted several issues between the couple, such as Ralph sleeping in the guest room and his response to Drew’s dispute with his cousin, Courtney Rhodes.\n\nIn a March 3 confessional, Drew discussed their ongoing issues, noting that while their problems weren’t new, they “weren’t getting any better.”\n\n“It has been a lot of things that have been happening over the course of the marriage, and, honestly, things were just not getting better. I allowed him having inappropriate relationships with women. I allowed Tampa,” Drew said."
