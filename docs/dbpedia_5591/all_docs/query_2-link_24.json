        "text": "Ralph Pittman is sending Drew Sidora his “sincere” apologies amid their divorce.\n\nThe business strategist took accountability for his “part in the deterioration of [their] relationship” in a statement to People Friday.\n\n“Although we know the real reason that ultimately led to my request for divorce, I’m taking this time to be more introspective and working to become the best version of myself,” the 40-year-old wrote.\n\n“As seasons change, I’m hopeful and optimistic for brighter days ahead,” he continued.\n\nPittman, who shares son Machai, 8, and daughter Aniya, 5, with his estranged wife, went on to tell the outlet that he loves Sidora, 38, “with all [his] heart.”\n\nHe added, “It is no secret that marriage is a challenging journey, one that is not for the faint of heart. My family means the world to me and I’ve dedicated myself to providing support, encouragement and acting as a pillar of strength for my wife and children.”\n\nSidora’s rep did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment on Pittman’s remarks.\n\nNews broke of the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” stars’ divorce in March, nine years after the duo tied the knot.\n\nIn February court documents, Sidora accused her partner of cheating, “blatant disrespect and mental abuse.”\n\nThe “That’s So Raven” alum told People four months later that her “boiling point” occurred when Pittman’s alleged “behavior and inappropriateness” continued when they joined the Bravo series in 2020.\n\nCan’t get enough ‘Real Housewives’?\n\n10 most expensive homes owned by Housewives\n\nWhy so many Housewives divorce their husbands\n\nWhich ‘Real Housewife’ Are You Based on Your Zodiac Sign\n\nDespite the “embarrassment” she suffered onscreen, Sidora shared her hopes for an “amicable” co-parenting dynamic in the future.\n\n“I’m hoping for us to come out of this and be able to be friends and be respectful,” the actress, who is also the mother of son Josiah, 12, from a previous relationship, said in the June interview.\n\nSidora and Pittman’s tumultuous romance played out on “RHOA,” with the “Game” alum even neglecting to wear her wedding ring during Season 14.\n\nShe stopped wearing the jewelry after her husband’s former assistant allegedly offered him a massage via flirty texts.\n\nWhen Pittman slammed Sidora at the time for her inability to “move beyond” the “incident” — which he labeled a “figment of [her] imagination” — viewers and castmates alike called out his alleged gaslighting.\n\nKenya Moore referred to the businessman as a “disrespectful … a–hole” at the time, comparing him to her estranged husband, Marc Daly.\n\nWhile Sidora and Pittman both listed different dates of separation in their divorce filings — Feb. 23 and Feb. 19, respectively, they agreed that their union is “irretrievably broken.”"
