        "text": "Real Housewives of Atlanta star Drew Sidora is questioning the genuine love that her husband, Ralph Pittman, feels for nine-year-old son Josiah from a previous relationship.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CJMXMK0gC0c/\n\nIn the new episode of Real Housewives of Atlanta, People Magazine reported that the reality star said during the show, “I mean, I understand there’s a biological difference, but I guess not just showing him how to be a man, but actually giving him that love. Like, showing him it’s okay to hug, it’s okay to nurture,” Drew said about her husband’s parenting style. “You know, giving him that emotional love.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CJ7KBjDgSiz/\n\nDrew went on to say in the confessional, that Josiah was 3-years-old when she and Ralph first met.\n\n“Ralph took my heart because he really loved my son. But it’s very much that tough love. Because Josiah’s super sensitive, I do not want Josiah to ever feel that the love that Ralph is showing him is different than his biological children.”\n\nThe Step Up actress is mother to Josiah, 9, son Machai David, 5, and daughter Aniya, 2.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CIrdf2KApv9/\n\nSince the premiere of the new season, the 35-year-old actress has been very open about her marriage and admitted to People in a previous interview that, “We’ve got to get our act together for the sake of our kids and for our marriage if we want this thing to last.”\n\nOn Sunday’s episode, Drew shared more with the new couple’s counselor, Love McPherson, about her relationship with her husband.\n\n“Ralph and I have tried couple’s counseling a time or two or three or a dozen, I’ve lost track. But after our huge blowup on our anniversary, which was probably the biggest argument we’ve ever had in our marriage, we know we have serious problems that we really need to commit to working out and fixing — quickly.”\n\nDon’t miss an episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta this season. We are hoping that the journey for Drew and her family will be a positive one. The Real Housewives of Atlanta airs on Sunday’s at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo.\n\nPhoto Credit: @heatherlashun"
