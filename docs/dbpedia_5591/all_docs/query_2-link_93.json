        "text": "Drew Sidora is back on the market. Ralph Pittman Jr. filed for divorce from the 37-year-old actress on Monday, Feb. 27, according to documents, obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nThe couple married in 2014 and share two minor children. Drew also has a child from a previous relationship.\n\nRalph appeared on The Real Housewives of Atlanta with his wife.\n\n“There is no chance or hope of reconciliation,” he stated in court papers.\n\nPEOPLE also obtained documents that show Drew filed her own divorce papers an hour before he did.\n\nRalph listed the couple’s separation date as Feb. 19, while Drew claims they have been separated since Feb. 23.\n\n“Love is a beautiful thing,” Ralph, 37, said in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\n“Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other. Drew and I have decided to file for divorce. We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.”\n\nRELATED: Drew Sidora’s Sister Confirms Drew Dated LeBron James – While He Was with Savannah\n\nTensions grew between Drew and Ralph on the reality TV series. Trouble began after she found a suspicious text message between him and his female assistant.\n\nMonths later, she said they were in marriage counseling.\n\n“That’s the journey we’re on every day honestly,” she told Us Weekly last May.\n\n“We’ve made a decision to stay committed. We’re not willing to give up that easy, and we’re pushing through, and it’s not always nice. It’s not always easy and you guys just kind of have a front row to that.”\n\nDrew made blog headlines last year when she admitted creeping with Savannah James‘ husband, LeBron James.\n\nIn an episode of RHOA, Drew admitted the Lakers star flew her out to NBA games before she was a happily married woman."
