        "text": "Drew Sidora is remembering a time when Nicki Minaj gave her \"advice\" on her post-baby body.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta star, who joined the Bravo series this season, appeared on Kandi Burruss' Speak On It series on YouTube. The two chatted about everything from Drew's first impression of her co-stars to her weight loss journey.\n\nIn fact, the 35-year-old actress opened up about her past experience with Nicki, in which the rapper commented on her body. Drew explained that she was auditioning to play Nicki in an ABC Family sitcom based on her childhood.\n\nDuring their first meeting, Drew recalled Nicki saying, \"Girl, you don't look how you looked in TLC.\" The Queen rapper was referring to Drew's role as T-Boz in the 2013 TV movie, CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story.\n\n\"Nicki herself said that,\" Drew told Kandi. \"She said, 'I don't look how I looked when I played T-Boz.' I was like, 'Nicki!'\"\n\nDespite the 38-year-old musician's bluntness, the White Chicks star said she became focused on her health.\n\n\"What I took away was, 'Girl, get your life together. Get back in the gym. You can't keep blaming it on the baby and get to work. I took some real constructive criticism and real advice,\" Drew explained. \"Like, yes, I had a baby. Let's not body shame, but it did give me that energy and motivation.\"\n\n\"So I turned it into lemonade, like let's get in the gym and really get my career back,\" she added. \"So, I've been on a journey of weight loss and just getting back to good health.\"\n\nE! News has reached out to Nicki's team for comment on Drew's claims. We have yet to receive a response."
