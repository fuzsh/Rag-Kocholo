        "text": "Ralph Pittman receives backlash for his treatment of Drew Sidora.\n\n“Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Drew Sidora has been open about her marriage since her first season on the show. In fact, she told the ladies about Ralph Pittman abruptly going out of town after they had a heated exchange. The issue was Ralph wouldn’t tell her where he went for months. He then eventually revealed that he traveled to Tampa to clear his head. RHOA fans have questioned if Ralph is telling the truth. Some suspected Ralph may not have been faithful. Regardless, Drew and Ralph said they were working on their marriage. And things were improving. However, the cracks were still visible during the last season.\n\nIn one episode, Ralph planned a surprise romantic dinner for Drew. She wanted to get some things off her chest. But Ralph wasn’t feeling this. He felt like Drew bringing up their past issues ruined their night. So he told her he regretted planning the dinner. And he felt she only deserved Lunchables from him. Needless to say, his comments resulted in backlash from RHOA fans.\n\nDrew also didn’t like it when Ralph’s assistant offered him a back rub. She told Ralph to fire the woman.\n\nAt the reunion, Ralph apologized to Drew for hurting her over the years. And he said he would do better and be mindful of the way he talks to her moving forward.\n\nIt’s over for Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman’s marriage.\n\nWell, Ralph has now filed for divorce. According to TMZ, court documents state that the couple has been separated since February 19 of this year. Ralph wants joint physical and legal custody of their biological children. He is not requesting custody of Drew’s oldest child, Josiah. His birth father is in the child’s life.\n\nAnother interesting part to note is Ralph is fighting against paying spousal support. He claims Drew can support herself with the money she makes from RHOA."
