        "text": "Drew Sidora gave her daughter, Aniya Grace Pittman, a beautiful baby Blessing ceremony despite the drama that ensued on Sunday night’s episode of the Real Housewives of Atlanta (RHOA).\n\nThe celebrity mom had her mother, Pastor Jeanette, rendered services at the ceremony. She took the place of Prophet Lott who was accused of having inappropriate relations with RHOA star LaToya Ali. Rumors of Prophet Lott and LaToya having sexual relations spread quickly and ultimately led to Drew initially canceling her daughter’s Blessing ceremony.\n\nDelayed did not equate to denied in the situation as Sidora relied on her mom, who is also a person of the cloth, to perform the service. “Despite all the drama, my baby was Blessed,” Drew told her social media fans after the event.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CNnpMIPgrBM/\n\n“And what a Blessing it was,” Sidora exclaimed. “It wasn’t aired on Rhoa, but the ceremony was absolutely breathtaking and beautiful! Officiated by non-other than my mama…Pastor Jeanette! Thanks to all our family and friends who attended in celebrating our beautiful baby girl. Thank you for being a part of @aniyagracepittman ‘s journey.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CNlj5KFgzCF/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\nBlessing services are a tradition in the Christian Church. The officiant typically says prayers meant to dedicate the child to God while also spreading positive energy.\n\nKandi Burruss and Cynthia Bailey were two of several RHOA cast members to attend Aniya’s Blessing ceremony. “It was a lot of talk about @drewsidora’s baby blessing on last week’s episode but everything worked out,” Kandi shared after attending the event. “Her beautiful daughter @aniyagracepittman was blessed by her mom at their beautiful home,” Burruss revealed. “It was perfect!”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CNlj5KFgzCF/\n\nSome scrutinized Drew Sidora for focusing on the drama revolving around Prophet Lott before deciding to go with her mother in the end. “You did all that fussing with Toya just for your momma to do the Blessing,” one critic shared on Instagram. Another of Drew’s social media followers wrote, “You should have used your mother in the first place instead of being messy.”\n\nAniya is Drew Sidora’s youngest child with her husband, Ralph Pittman. The celebrity couple also has a son named Machai. Drew has three kids in all."
