        "text": "In the least surprising breakup news ever, Drew Sidora and Tampa Ralph Pittman announced their split in March of this year.\n\nNaturally, the aftermath was a mess. The Real Housewives of Atlanta star called Ralph a “serial cheater and adulterer” and accused him of abuse. But Drew isn’t letting this split drag her down.\n\nIn a recent Instagram post, she expressed gratitude while taking her oldest son on a trip to Dubai with his biological father (not Ralph).\n\nBonding in Dubai\n\nIn the video, Drew told her son, “Our first trip to Dubai, Jojo,” while they hung out on the flight over. She also chronicled their hotel and shopping excursions while overseas.\n\nIt looks like Drew is not only in a good place geographically but emotionally as well. Her caption read in part, “Gratitude filled my heart as we traveled because it was a step toward building a stronger bond, which is nothing short of life-changing. Thankful for this blessing in creating memories for my [first-born,] who is so deserving.”\n\nShe also spoke about “second chances,” writing, “Rebuilding the father-son bond is a testament to second chances, the power of resilience[,] and the opportunity to create beautiful memories. This is my new normal and looking forward to this new chapter and journey ahead. We had a whole blast!!!!”\n\nOne of Drew’s RHOA co-stars was happy to show her excitement for Drew. Kenya Moore commented, “Amazing Drew.” It looks like the two former foes have likely bonded given their shared experience of messy splits.\n\nStaying positive\n\nThankfully, Drew has maintained a positive spirit throughout tough times. Back in August, Drew described her divorce as a “blessing.” The accomplished actress added, “Even though I’m going through a tough time in my life, I’m really giving in to God. He’s blessing me and sustaining me to be able to push through each day.”\n\nShe concluded, “I’ve learned that I have resilience and I’m grateful for that. I’m grateful for that inner strength that I’ve discovered. I’m definitely in an uncomfortable spot, but I feel like discomfort can help you to go to the next level, so I’m grateful for the journey.”\n\nNow let’s see if Drew gets another blessing, in the form of a call back for RHOA."
