        "text": "By Leila Kozma\n\nUpdated April 21 2021, 3:36 p.m. ET\n\nA recent episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta shed light on a dilemma Drew Sidora is about to face. Drew gave birth to her first son, 9-year-old Josiah \"JoJo\" Jordan, in 2011, a few years before she met her husband, Ralph Pittman. She and Ralph made strong efforts to help JoJo feel at home — and in 2015, Ralph successfully became his adoptive father. But trouble might be brewing. As Drew revealed, her baby daddy has reached out with the hope of reconnecting with JoJo.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDrew Sidora says her baby daddy was in prison for a while.\n\nReportedly, Drew's baby daddy is record executive Ricky Brascom.\n\nJosiah was born on March 21, 2011. It's understood that he met his dad when he was 2 years old. Reportedly, they had another get-together around a year ago. As a recent episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta revealed, Drew's baby daddy got in touch again with Drew more recently.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBrascom was reportedly arrested in 2012 for smuggling $4 million worth of cocaine in a private jet across the U.S. He was sentenced to prison for drug trafficking charges.\n\n\"I felt like I had been tricked. I started to question my own judgment,\" Drew told People. \"I started asking myself, ‘How did I miss that?’ I had major trust issues, and I probably sabotaged a lot of potential relationships because of it. But when I delivered [my son Josiah], there was just this overwhelming joy. And if that is what I had to go through to get my son, it was so worth it.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDrew met her husband, Ralph Pittman, when Josiah was around 2 years old.\n\nDrew and Ralph were first introduced to each other in 2013, while she was promoting a TV movie, CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story. They tied the knot at a beachside wedding in Los Angeles in 2014. Drew and Ralph share 5-year-old Machai and 3-year-old Aniya.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"Josiah's biological father was in prison when Ralph and I met and Ralph took my heart because he really loved my son,\" Drew explained in the episode titled \"If You've Got It, Haunt It.\"\n\nThe reemergence of Josiah's biological dad likely came as a shock to Drew.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk in our household recently about biological parents versus non-biological parents and because Josiah's biological dad has been reaching out wanting to build a relationship with him,\" Drew explained in a previous episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAs the episode titled \"If You've Got It, Haunt It\" revealed, Drew wasn't sure how to tell Josiah the latest turn of events. A crucial scene of the episode captured a conversation between her and Ralph, who emphasized that Josiah might come to resent not taking active steps to build a strong bond with his biological dad later on in life.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"You are the only dad he knows,\" Drew told Ralph in an episode of 'RHOA.'\n\n\"I don't even know what I'm going to say. Like, I don't want to push anything on him,\" Drew said. \"You are the only dad he knows. It's like, he's good. Like, he doesn't need anybody else. So I just, in my mind I want to keep it like that, but it's just not the reality.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"I just don't want Josiah to ever grow up saying that, 'You stopped me from having a relationship with my dad.' And so yeah, I understand how he feels right now, but I want to make sure that we don't stand in the way from that relationship actually blossoming and them actually being able to establish something and create that real, true father-son bond,\" Ralph said."
