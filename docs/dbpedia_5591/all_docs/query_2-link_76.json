        "text": "Drew Sidora is the newest cast member on The Real Housewives Of Atlanta and she’s already proving that she’s not afraid to speak her mind. During her December 13 appearance on Kandi Burruss‘ YouTube series Speak On It, Drew dished on an uncomfortable interaction she allegedly had with rapper Nicki Minaj! At the time, Drew was auditioning for a role on an ABC sitcom based on Nicki’s childhood.\n\nThe latest RHOA star, 35, recalled that she had been told, “Girl, you don’t look how you looked in TLC,” referring to her role as TLC’s T-Boz in the 2013 TV movie CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story. Drew then alleged that it was Nicki who made the comment! “I was up for an ABC family series, a Nicki Minaj pilot. And Nicki herself said that. She said I don’t look how I looked when I played T-Boz,” Drew claimed. “I was like, ‘Nicki!’ It was like, all these ABC execs around but I had gone through about five rounds. And she really, really liked me.”\n\nDespite whatever warm feelings Drew and Nicki may have had for each other, Drew was initially caught off-guard by the comment. “She said that in front of all of these [executives],” Drew reiterated. “It is was it is. I was like, ‘Look, I just had a baby.’ I think at the time my baby was like three months old. I was literally still breastfeeding.”\n\nBut instead of letting the comments allegedly made by Nicki, who recently had a baby herself, defeat her, Drew took the words in stride and thought of them as “advice” to start her weight loss journey and get back to her ideal body weight. “What I took away was, ‘Girl, get your life together. Get back in the gym. You can’t keep blaming it on the baby and get to work,'” Drew told Kandi.\n\nFinally, Drew had a very clear message for anyone who wanted to shame new moms’ bodies. “Like, yes, I had a baby, let’s not body shame,” she said to Kandi. “But it did give me that motivation. So I turned it into lemonade like let’s get in the gym and really get my career back. So, I’ve been on a journey of weight loss and just getting back to good health.”"
