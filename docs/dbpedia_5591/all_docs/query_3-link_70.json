        "text": "Drew Sidora and husband Ralph Pittman are calling it quits.\n\nIt has been reported that the couple are getting a divorce after nine years of marriage. Pittman said,“Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other.”\n\nHe continued, “Drew and I have decided to file for divorce. We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.”\n\nPittman filed for divorce on Monday citing “there is no chance or hope of reconciliation” between the both of them. Drew and Ralph married in August 2014 and share two children together.\n\nThe actress has another child from a previous relationship. The couple’s marital issues were displayed on the show “Real Housewives of Atlanta.” Drew found some text messages in Ralph’s phone between him and a female assistant who was later fired.\n\n“Finding out my husband was getting close with his assistant was really hard for me,” she said. “I packed up my kids and we went to Chicago. I literally ran away from home.”\n\nBefore making this tough decision, Drew spoke on fighting for their marriage with Ralph. “I thought it was like Cinderella, like a happily ever after and so we thought that’s what it was going to be.” She continued, “My parents who have been married for like 60 years made it look so easy. I’m in a situation where we have children, we’re moving to a new city, life is happening and people are growing as well as changing.”\n\nShe added, “It’s hard because sometimes you’re like, do I need to stay in this marriage or am I better off by myself? Then I think to myself when two people commit and you keep committing to each other, what can we do to fix this? You’re switching counselors to find the right one but we’re committed and I think that’s what keeps people together.”\n\nWe are wishing Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman all the best."
