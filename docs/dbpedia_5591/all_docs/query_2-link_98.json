        "text": "Update: (March 1, 2023): We’re getting answers about why “RHOA” star Drew Sidora and her now-estranged husband Ralph Pittman have separated.\n\nAccording to reports, the peach holder is claiming that Pittman cheated on her and “mentally abused” her in her recent divorce filings. As you may recall, news broke yesterday (March 1) that the ex-couple seemingly raced each other to the courthouse to file for divorce last month, with Sidora beating Pittman to file first by 61 minutes.\n\nReportedly, in Sidora’s amended complaint she said that she couldn’t handle Pittman’s “continued blatant disrespect and mental abuse any longer.” According to the former Disney star, Pittman would interfere with her finances and recently withdrew a “large sum of money” from her account as leverage.\n\nSidora’s accusations against her soon-to-be ex-husband didn’t end there, she also noted that he is a serial cheater and the women he cheated with would often send her screenshots of their “sexts.”\n\nIn addition, she said their issues have turned physical and Pittman became aggressive with her during a recent fight. He allegedly snatched her phone from her hands, which caused her to fall to the ground.\n\n[VIA]\n\nUpdate: (March 1, 2023): Looks like “RHOA” star Drew Sidora and her now-estranged husband Ralph Pittman had a race to the courthouse to file for divorce.\n\nInitial reports claimed that Pittman was the one to file for divorce from the “That’s So Raven” star, however, that may not be true. According to new reports, Sidora actually had her own divorce papers stamped by Gwinnett Co. court on Feb. 27 at 1:10 PM.\n\nWhich is an hour and one minute BEFORE records reportedly reflect that Pittman had his documents stamped (that same day) at 2:11 PM.\n\nAs of now, it’s unclear what prompted the former couple to sprint to the courthouse but it seems that they are beyond ready to be single again, with both claiming the marriage is “irretrievably broken.”\n\nDespite them being on the same page regarding a divorce, Sidora and Pittman may want to consider taking a moment to chat about when they officially separated. As previously reported, Pittman noted in his divorce petition that they separated on Feb. 19. However, according to Sidora’s documents, they separated on Feb. 23.\n\n[VIA]\n\nOriginal story: (March 1, 2023): Seems like “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” cast will be down one husband this upcoming season.\n\nAccording to reports, “RHOA” star Drew Sidora and her husband Ralph Pittman, both 37, have decided to call it quits. The couple married in 2014 and share two children together, a 7-year-old son named Machai and a 5-year-old daughter named Aniya. Drew Sidora also has an 11-year-old son, Josiah, from a previous relationship.\n\nReportedly, Ralph Pittman was the one to file for divorce. In the legal documents, Ralph Pittman allegedly claims that he and Drew Sidora officially separated last month on Feb. 19. He’s seeking joint physical and legal custody of their two children. In addition, he wants his Porsche Taycan and his 2018 Cadillac.\n\nAs far as spousal support goes, Pittman has requested that it not be granted, claiming his soon-to-be ex-wife makes a hefty amount of money from her Bravo gig and she’ll be just fine without the financial compensation.\n\nThe divorce papers also reportedly note “there is no chance or hope of reconciliation” between the former love birds.\n\nPittman has released a statement on his pending divorce and said,\n\n“Love is a beautiful thing. Unfortunately, we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other. Drew and I have decided to file for divorce. We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.”\n\nSidora joined “RHOA” starting with season 13 in 2020. Since being on the series, she has been open about the ups and downs of her marriage. Last year viewers watched as “The Game” actress discovered questionable text messages between her estranged husband and his female assistant. While previously speaking on the discovery, she said,\n\n“I packed up my kids and we went to Chicago. I literally ran away from home.”\n\nHowever, it’s unclear if that incident played into the couple’s divorce.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this entire situation? Do you think Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman will be able to work things out? Tell us in the comments below!"
