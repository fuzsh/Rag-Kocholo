        "text": "Drew Sidora is accused of cheating on her now-estranged husband, Ralph Pittman, with Tamera “Ty” Young in the explosive midseason trailer for “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” Season 15.\n\n“She was cheating with a well-known basketball player,” Shereé Whitfield alleges in a confessional as headlines about her co-star and the former WNBA player flash on-screen in the clip, which Bravo released Friday.\n\n“That’s what the streets are saying.”\n\nWhen a producer asks Sidora, 38, about her alleged involvement with Young, 36, she remains coy.\n\n“I don’t know what I can say and not say,” the “Already Know” singer responds.\n\nSpeculation about Sidora and Young first came up in March when “Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta” star Mimi Faust — who was previously engaged to the athlete — suggested that an affair was taking place.\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates…\n\nListen to our “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nFaust, 53, posted a photo of Sidora and Young to her Instagram Story, soundtracked by Ice Spice’s song “Munch (Feelin’ You)” — which includes lyrics about oral sex performed by two women.\n\n“What’s done in the dark will come to the light,” Faust later said in an interview with online personality Anthony Lofties.\n\nIn the new sneak peek, Marlo Hampton expresses shock over the situation.\n\n“I can’t get over she’s dating a woman, the way she is, ‘I’d never kiss a girl!’” the Le’Archive founder says of Sidora.\n\nIn another moment, Sidora is seen embracing Young as she states in a voiceover, “Don’t tell me I kissed this girl. I didn’t kiss this girl.”\n\nWhile it remains unclear whether “RHOA” fans will gain clarity about Sidora’s potential romance with Young, the “CrazySexyCool” actress certainly got intimate with another woman — but seemingly just for a role in a film produced by Kandi Burruss’ husband, Todd Tucker.\n\n“When we get to those sex scenes, I’m a little nervous,” Sidora says before footage plays, showing her filming an erotic scene with a female co-star.\n\n“She’s acting her ass off,” Tucker, 49, says proudly.\n\nMeanwhile, Sidora’s spouse, Pittman, 40, seems unnerved by her relations with the woman.\n\n“Did you kiss her?” he presses, prompting Sidora to reply, “This is work.”\n\nVisibly annoyed, Pittman then asks, “So you’re a method actor?”\n\nSidora and Pittman both filed for divorce — 61 minutes apart — on Feb. 27 after nine years of marriage. In court documents, Sidora accused her partner of cheating, “blatant disrespect and mental abuse.”\n\nSidora — who shares son Machai, 8, and daughter Aniya, 5, with Pittman — told People months later that her “boiling point” occurred when the businessman’s alleged “behavior and inappropriateness” continued when they joined the Bravo series in 2020.\n\nLast month, Pittman issued a public apology to Sidora, owning his part in “the deterioration of [their] relationship.”\n\n“Although we know the real reason that ultimately led to my request for divorce, I’m taking this time to be more introspective and working to become the best version of myself,” he said in part in a statement to People.\n\n“As seasons change, I’m hopeful and optimistic for brighter days ahead.”\n\n“The Real Housewives of Atlanta” airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo."
