        "text": "The Pittman Pack is growing up fast!\n\nEarlier this week, The Real Housewives of Atlanta’s Drew Sidora provided another update on her oldest son as well as the two children she welcomed with her husband, Ralph Pittman. The Atlanta mother took to Instagram on Aug. 2 to share a quick video of her three kids returning home from their first day of school. Yes, it’s hard to believe that summer vacation is officially over for many students across the country, but perhaps even more unbelievable is just how quickly Drew’s kids have grown.\n\nDrew Sidora shares her kids' first day of school\n\nThe post shows the actress/singer walking in her front yard, greeting her son Machai as he exited the school bus.\n\n“Hey, buddy! What’s up?” she told the 8-year-old, who had his Spider-Man backpack and water bottle in hand. “Hey, big bro.”\n\nDrew then turned the camera toward her home’s front door, where her youngest child — a 5-year-old daughter named Aniya — was seen smiling ear to ear with her Encanto backpack.\n\n“Aniya! How as kindergarten, girl?” the mom asked.\n\n“Good!” she enthusiastically responded.\n\nDrew and Ralph Pittman's daughter reaches a milestone\n\nAniya’s first day of kindergarten took place about two months after she graduated from pre-K. Ralph documented the milestone via Instagram on May 20, sharing photos of his daughter holding her diploma while rocking the cutest cap and gown.\n\n“Our baby girl Aniya Grace… graduated Pre-K and it’s her weekend!” he captioned the carousel. “Join me in congratulating her and pray my strength because her energy is on another level.”\n\nRalph celebrated the graduation with Aniya and his son, Machai, at Atlanta’s Sky Zone trampoline park.\n\nDrew's oldest child, Josiah, is in the gifted program\n\nElsewhere in Drew’s video, the Atlanta mom is seen welcoming her son Josiah, aka Jojo, who had just completed his first day of 7th grade.\n\n“How was school?” she asked him as he walked through the door.\n\n“Good. I mean not — it was boring,” he said with a slight grin.\n\n“You’re so smart,” Drew responded. “How was the gifted program? Poppin’?”\n\n“No,” Josiah flatly replied, causing his mom to laugh.\n\nDrew Sidora Is \"So Proud\" of Son Josiah After Their Difficult Conversation on RHOA\n\nThe post received thousands of likes and hundreds of comments, some of which came from Bravolebrities. RHOA friend Monyetta Shaw-Carter and Shamea Morton left a series of heart and heart-eye emojis, respectively, while rapper/actress Lil Mama pointed out just how big Josiah has gotten.\n\n“Yes it’s crazy how time flies sis,” Drew responded to the latter message.\n\nDrew and Ralph's Divorce\n\nThe update came as Ralph and Drew continue divorce proceedings. The husband and wife, who tied the knot in August 2014, both filed for separation in late February. Their marital problems have played out on TV ever since Drew joined the RHOA cast in 2020. The Chicago native opened up about her relationship struggles in the July 30 episode, which followed the ’Wives during their trip to Portugal.\n\n“Ralph and I have been dealing with issues of transparency, of faithfulness,” Drew said in a confessional, “and it is really starting to wear on my mental health.”"
