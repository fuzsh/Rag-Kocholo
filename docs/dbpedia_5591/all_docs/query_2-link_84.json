        "text": "634\n\nRHOA couple Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman get into a war of words on Twitter amid their ongoing divorce. Get all the tea!\n\nDrew Sidora and Ralph Pittman‘s divorce is getting UGLY. The estranged RHOA couple are airing out all their dirty laundry on Twitter as their divorce rages on.\n\nDuring part one of the RHOA reunion, Drew slammed Ralph’s cousin Courtney Rhodes for talking about her 12-year-old son, Josiah, who is from a previous relationship.\n\n“Don’t you ever keep my son’s name in your mouth,” Drew said. “You don’t know what the f*** you are talking about.”\n\nCourtney denied talking about Josiah, but a flashback scene from the RHOA season 15 finale shows her saying, “Yeah, she was like adopt this child so I can go be in my gay lover relationship and you pay the bills.”\n\nFast forward to Monday, when Drew decided to call out Courtney and Ralph on Twitter. Drew alleges that Ralph allowed his cousin to speak “evil” about Josiah on TV.\n\n“I must always protect and stand for my children against this type of evil. I gave him the opportunity to shut his unverifiable fake “cousin down for her disgusting comments made concerning my son. However, he refused to do so & it breaks my heart,” Drew shared on Twitter Monday night.\n\nThe 38-year-old continued, “She meant to be nasty & rude, making comments and dragging my child into this… KIDS ARE ALWAYS OFF LIMITS!!! That’s it, that’s all….we’re done!”\n\nRalph replied to Drew’s tweets, alleging that Drew’s request for him to adopt Josiah was nothing more than a “money grab.” Ralph also accused Drew of “taking advantage” of him and “playing the battered victim role.”\n\nThe 40-year-old wrote:\n\n“It’s time to speak truth, so let’s be real. You expect me to pay child support when he has a father [who] wants to play an active role in his life, but you won’t let him. Your adoption request was only a money grab and control.\n\nSince the age of 3, I stepped up to fill the gap as a man and unconditionally provided from my heart without expectations. I will continue being there, but you’re not going to take advantage of me or use this show to get your way.\n\nI understand playing the battered victim role earns you sympathy on this platform, but you will respect me as a Father. I love all my kids and have given them the world, including you. It’s about them now. #Respect.”\n\nPart two of the RHOA season 15 reunion airs on Sunday, September 10, at 8/7c on Bravo.\n\nThoughts on this all? Sound off below!"
