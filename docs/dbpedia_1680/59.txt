A graduate of Carnegie Mellon University and the Florida State Film Conservatory, Greg Marcks has earned dozens of awards for his work as a filmmaker, most notably a student Academy Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Marcks first wrote 11:14 (2003), a darkly comic thriller about a night-gone-wrong in small-town America. The tightly-crafted script was quickly passed around Hollywood, and Oscar-winner Hilary Swank signed on to produce and star in the picture. Marcks then assembled an impressive ensemble cast for his debut, including Patrick Swayze, Ben Foster, and Rachael Leigh Cook. The well-reviewed film has become a cult favorite.

Marcks wrote several screenplays for major Hollywood studios before taking on his next directorial effort, Die Echelon-Verschw√∂rung (2009). An action-thriller with filming locations in Sofia, Bangkok, Prague, and Moscow, the film tracks an international conspiracy and stars such notables as Ving Rhames, Jonathan Pryce, and Martin Sheen.

Marcks' next project, "You Don't Love Me Yet," will film in the Silverlake neighborhood of Los Angeles.
