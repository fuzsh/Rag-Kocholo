        "text": "Marcks received an MFA in directing from the Film Conservatory at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. His film âLectorâ won a student Academy AwardÂ®, bringing him notice.\n\nRelocating to Los Angeles, Marcks worked briefly as an assistant while outlining â11:14.â Having saved enough rent money for one month, he quit his job and wrote a draft in four weeks. Script in hand, he attached himself as director and secured representation. LionsGate offered to buy the script if he would detach as director but Marcks refused, believing the script would attract top talent. Soon thereafter Academy AwardÂ® winner Hilary Swank agreed to star and executive produce. One year to the day after he quit his job, principal photography of â11:14â began in Los Angeles. The film premiered a year later at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nMarcks spent the next few years performing writing and rewriting services for such studios and networks as LionsGate, DreamWorks, Summit Entertainment, and Sony Pictures Television. His latest directorial effort, âEchelon Conspiracy,â an international thriller, was released in 2009.\n\nGreg Marcks began making movies at age thirteen in his hometown of Chelmsford, Massachusetts. By age sixteen he had created a sketch comedy show for local cable which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in.\n\nMarcks attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he studied creative writing and film. He ran the student film festival and received grants to direct short films through the non-profit Pittsburgh Filmmakers. He also interned at both KDKA and WQED, assisting none other than Fred âMisterâ Rogers."
