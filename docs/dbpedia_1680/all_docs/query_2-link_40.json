But forecasting the paper's future is another matter.\n\nHOUSE OF CHANG\n\nFor more than 30 years, this location housed Lucky Garden, one of the first neighborhood Mandarin-Szechuan restaurants in Greater Boston, and one of the best in stretches.\n\nOSCAR PREDICTIONS 2010\n\nAfter years of shrinking audiences and low-grossing Best Picture nominees, the Academy this year is hedging its bets.\n\nBEACH HOUSE | TEEN DREAM\n\nBefore I talk about Beach House's third album — the top dreampop album of 2010 until further notice — I should reveal that I had the big gay whirlwind romance of my life under the influence of a steady stream of Beach House Mania at SxSW three years ago.\n\nIS THERE 'HOPE' IN HOLLYWOOD?\n\nBuoyed by President Barack Obama's campaign slogan, many had hopes for change after his election.\n\nIN PAWTUCKET, A HAITIAN-AMERICAN FAMILY ANXIOUSLY WAITS\n\nTheir roof is a blanket held up by sticks, their bed is dirt. Every morning, they wake — the grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews — and begin their journey on foot to search for something to eat and drink.\n\nBRAVE NEW GLOBE?\n\nSizing up the Boston Globe 's recent past is easy: simply put, in the past 12 months, the paper has seen enough gut-wrenching drama to change the name of Morrissey Boulevard to Melrose Place. But forecasting the paper's future is another matter.\n\nORWELL AND SHAKESPEARE IN A MINUTE\n\n\"I thought we were going to be talking about windmills,\" Jenny Sawyer mutters as she looks into the camera, sandwiched between two pigs.\n\nTHE HARVARD PSYCHEDELIC CLUB\n\nTimothy Leary brought the bowl of mushrooms up to his nose and sniffed."
