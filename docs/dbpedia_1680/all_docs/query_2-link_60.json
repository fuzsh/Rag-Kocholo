Taking it outside, he does his best to show how it is used but is unable to keep the hula hoop around his waist. Luckily, Paul Tifford is in the Neighborhood offering hula hoop lessons and Mister Rogers decides to pay him a visit.\n\nAt Mr. Tifford's studio, Mister Rogers listens to a few suggestions and is able to successfully keep the hula hoop spinning around his waist. He then steps back and watches in amazement as Mr. Tifford demonstrates his ability to spin multiple hula hoops at the same time. Mister Rogers continues observing as Maggie Stewart stops by for her hula hoop lesson.\n\nIn the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, Prince Tuesday is about to share the details of his accident with Mayor Maggie when King Friday interrupts. As Lady Aberlin and Lady Elaine Fairchilde arrive, King Friday announces that all flying lessons are to stop. Lady Elaine apologizes to Prince Tuesday for making him think the propeller hat she gave him would make him fly. Prince Tuesday suggests that Lady Elaine teach hula hoop lessons instead.\n\nInside the tree, Lady Aberlin and Prince Tuesday talk with X the Owl who is still feeling somewhat responsible for the Prince's accident. Prince Tuesday explains that X's instruction to be careful could have prevented his fall. X feels much better knowing that he was a good teacher.\n\nOutside, Lady Elaine's first hula hoop lesson is underway with Mayor Maggie.\n\nBack at the house, Mister Rogers spends some time thinking about children who are just learning to walk. He concludes by talking about practicing skills in order to get better and sings I'm Proud of You.\n\nNotes\n\nPaul Tifford, Jr. would appear in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe as Fortune Cookie Man in the first series of episodes from the next year.\n\nThis episode is included on the It's a Beautiful Day Collection (DVD).\n\nAppearing In This Episode\n\nKing Friday XIII\n\nLady Aberlin\n\nLady Elaine Fairchilde\n\nMaggie Stewart\n\nMayor Maggie\n\nMister Rogers\n\nPrince Tuesday\n\nX the Owl\n\nGuests\n\nPaul Tifford Jr.\n\nSongs\n\nI'm Proud of You\n\nIt's Such a Good Feeling\n\nThe Weekend Song\n\nWon't You Be My Neighbor?\n\nImages\n\nEpisode Credits\n\nWith Fred Rogers\n\nNeighbors: Betty Aberlin, Lenny Meledandri, Maggie Stewart, Paul Tifford Jr.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Civic Light Opera Academy\n\nExecutive Producer: Fred Rogers\n\nProducer: Margaret Whitmer\n\nDirector: Bob Walsh\n\nLocation Director: Gary Hines\n\nAssociate Producer: Allen Feuer\n\nMusic Directors: John Costa, Michael Moricz\n\nEditor: Susan Howard\n\nArt Director: Kathryn Borland\n\nAssistant Art Director: Catherine McConnell\n\nProperties: Andy Vogt\n\nProduction Assistants: Chris Boulton, Lenny Meledandri\n\nAssistant Directors: Chelle Robinson, Susan Howard\n\nLead Technician: Tom Deluga\n\nTechnical Director: Jim Ochtun\n\nProduction Interns: Greg Marcks, Cindy King, Abby Anderson\n\nLighting Director: Frank Warninsky\n\nAssistant Lighting Director: Bob Lubomski\n\nVideo: Don Williamson\n\nStudio Cameras: Kevin Conrad, Don McCall, Art Vogel\n\nAudio: Dick LaSota\n\nVideotape: Bob Millslagle, Bill Moore\n\nFloor Managers: Jim Seech, Nick Tallo\n\nLocation Production: Joe Abeln, Win Bernfeld, David Brannigan, John Burdick, Chris Dahl, Alec Harrison, Mark Knobil, Bob Lubomski, David Meek, Mike Schmeh, Rich Schutte, Rich Seig, Donny Stegall, Doug Suhr, Jerry Wheat\n\nScenic Artists: Joe Abeln, Jim Bruwelheide, Pam Lewis, Gregg Puchalski, Sandra Strieff\n\nMake-Up: Patty Bell\n\nVideotape Editor: Kevin Conrad\n\nPost Production Sound: Dick LaSota, Bob Millslagle\n\nMusicians: Carl McVicker, Bob Rawsthorne\n\nOriginal Scenic Design: Jack Guest\n\nDirector of Production: Sam Newbury"
