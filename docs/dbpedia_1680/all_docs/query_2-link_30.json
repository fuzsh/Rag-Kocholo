        "text": "Amazing Spider-Man, The\n\nWhere to go with Spider-Man? That's the billion dollar question that has plagued Sony Pictures. One of their flagship franchises, Spider-Man is a proven money-maker that could not be allowed to lie fallow simply because the creative engine ran out ...\n\nAmerican President, The\n\nIt's hard to believe that The American President was made by the same man responsible for the no-holds-barred satire of This Is Spinal Tap. Is there any element of American culture more ripe for the humorist's razor-sharp wit than presidential pol...\n\nApocalypse Now\n\nSince its 1979 release, Apocalypse Now has been widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential films about the Vietnam War. Were it not for the final thirty minutes, I might agree. There's little doubt that the bulk of the movie, whi...\n\nBobby\n\nIn the movie business, there's no such thing as \"truth in titling.\" If there was, Bobby would be called A Bunch of Boring, No-Name, Cookie-Cutter Characters.

Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have taken the B-grade Hong Kong crime flick Infernal Affairs and re-imagined it as an American epic tra...\n\nEchelon Conspiracy\n\nEchelon Conspiracy is a more evocative title than a movie this stupid deserves. Once again, Hollywood displays a blatant ignorance of the capabilities of modern computers by providing a \"God machine\" that seemingly has no limits, except when it co...\n\nGandhi\n\nTo a younger generation, Richard Attenborough may be best known for his portrayal of John Hammond in Jurassic Park and its firsts equel.
