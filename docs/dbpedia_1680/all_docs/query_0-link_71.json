        "text": "At 11:14pm, the lives of several townsfolk will come together and intertwine to fit snugly with a brutal murder. The story starts off with a genuinely eerie sequence: a drunken man (Henry Thomas) driving into a sleepy little down turns on the radio as he slowly drifts in and out of a somber daze, only to be rudely awakened by a disfigured, dead body crashing through his windshield. By the time the bronze five-o pull up, it seems that our unlikely hero is the center suspect in the grizzly killing.\n\nSnagging Hilary Swank can work wonders for any kind of movie, much less a low-budget one. She's one of the most gifted actresses in the industry, working such beautiful roles in dramas like Boys Don't Cry and the wonderfully-crafted Million Dollar Baby. Truth be told, she doesn't even steal the show here as yet another southern drama queen working at a quick-stop grocer. Her work with Shawn Hatosy seems a bit unbelievable, as she sets up an inside-job robbery and literally begs to be shot to make the hold-up look legit. C'mon, now. Nobody does that.\n\nBen Foster of Six Feet Under even appears in this most unlikely of talented casts. The ensemble is truly stacked, as Patrick Swayze, Barbara Hershey, Rachael Leigh Cook, and many others pitch in to create a surreal atmosphere. Of course, as things roll out we're treated to a lot of overacting. It's sporadic, really, as the acting fluctuates from terrific to downright bad.\n\nAll the while, the story plays off surprisingly well for an unknown indie flick from a first time director of a feature-length film. Writer/Director Greg Marcks channels a nice blend of Lost Highway-era David Lynch and Following-era Christopher Nolan. Unfortunately for him, that's not necessarily the best timeline for either director. We're given decent characters on the surface, but the entire plot feels seedy underneath. This would work perfectly, if it were actually intended that way, but by the looks of things it's accidental since we're not given even a subtle description for the bad vibe we're feeling.\n\nThe few evident flaws that the film possesses revolve around the poor construction of merit within the tale, although the few overbearing performances certainly don't help to get the point across, either. When all is said and done, the film isn't hard to understand at all. In fact, it's all spelled out for you rather than piecing it together in your mind like many of the movies that it borrows from, which is one of the main faults.\n\nWatching 11:14 is like buying a really unique jigsaw puzzle only to find that four of the pieces are missing. Unlike most mysteries, it's not the story pieces that are misplaced, but rather what makes you want to solve the film's Rubik's Cube in the first place. It seems Marcks focuses too much on connecting the stories and not enough on the details in-between that make a tale enjoyable. Yes, the story connects, but just because you can take five separate groups of characters and link their stories together isn't justifiable to concoct the mystery to begin with. It's still rather enjoyable, and gives hope to future Marcks projects. Hey, even the Nolans of the world had to start somewhere.\n\nScore: 6 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nThe transfer suffers from a lot of grain problems. It could be argued that it's intentional, but don't be swayed; this is obviously the folly of a faulty transfer. Overall, the film just looks dirty—-and there's no excuse that it should, since the movie was made in 2003. The film is presented in Widescreen 1.85:1, and is \"enhanced\" (for lack of a better word) for Widescreen television sets.\n\nScore: 4 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nA decent little score works well and comes out clearly in this 5.1 Dolby Digital presentation. While most of the film has normal speaking tones, the Patrick Swayze portion of the film is basically him ranting to himself and talking to his adorable pooch pal, and it's really, really tough on the ears. The sound effects bear down over the vocals at alarming rates from time to time, to boot.\n\nScore: 6 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nThe DVD for 11:14 features the following extras:\n\nFilmmaker Commentary with Director Greg Marcks\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\n46 Minutes to Midnight: The Making of 11:14\n\nCharacter Jump\n\nStoryboard to Screen\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nSurprisingly packed with extras, 11:14 sports a decent Making Of feature—for those of you that aren't familiar with my views, let me express that I generally truly dislike Making Of featurettes. For me to actually enjoy a Making Of segment, it has to add to the movie itself, and this one actually does. The Storyboard to Screen offers a couple of scenes worth the production storyboards, and they're about as interesting as storyboards can get. There are four Deleted Scenes that can be played with or without director commentary. They're worthy additions as they add to the story... well, outside of the dog urinating on a log, anyway.\n\nThe soft-spoken writer/direct offers a detailed commentary track. He sounds almost nervous through most of the commentary track, but still pipes in with tidbits of knowledge from time to time. The Character Jump feature allows you to watch the movie and jump to different characters as they follow the paths to 11:14pm. It's really unique and, while it doesn't add much since the movie is as clear as day in explanation, it's still an interesting extra.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10"
