        "text": "Philip Pullman, the hugely successful British children's author behind the His Dark Materials trilogy, has had his novel, Clockwork, optioned by Universal Pictures. The 1996 book, a dark fairytale that intertwines three stories, will be developed by children's TV producer Ilene Staple, who brought the book to the studio, acocrding to the Hollywood Reporter. The rights to the His Dark Materials trilogy have already been bought by rival studio New Line, which is in talks with Tom Stoppard to adapt the books.\n\nHilary Swank will star in and act as executive producer for 11:14, a film by first-time feature writer/director Greg Marcks. Marcks, who is just 26, won praise for his short student film, Lector, and soon found a buyer for the spec script of 11:14. Swank will be joined on screen by Colin Hanks, Rachael Leigh Cook and Henry Thomas, as well as young stars Ben Foster (Get Over It) and Jason Segel (SLC Punk!). Negotiations are also currently underway with Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey. Variety reports that the script works in reverse chronology, and follows a number of different characters and storylines, all of which meet up at a car accident which happens at - of course - 11:14."
