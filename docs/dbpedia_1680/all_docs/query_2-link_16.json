        "text": "FSU GRAD IS BACK WITH HIS FIRST HOLLYWOOD FEATURE\n\nMark Hinson\n\nGreg Marcks, 27, figured he'd scored an all-access pass to Hollywood with \"Lector,\" the award-winning short film he wrote and directed in 2000 while he was a graduate student at Florida State's film school.\n\nIt took him a little longer than he planned, but he finally got his shot to write and direct a feature film with \"11:14\" - a gritty, dark comedy with a big-name cast that will have its Tallahassee premiere on Sunday as part of the Seven Days of Opening Nights arts festival at FSU.\n\nIt is the polar opposite of \"Lector,\" which was a quiet, meditative tale of a man who read books aloud to workers in a Tampa cigar factory in the early 20th century. When the new technology of radio arrives it puts him out of a job. The period piece was based on a real profession. The straightforward story struck a chord with audiences, and the film-festival folks who hand out prizes.\n\n\"I don't know off the top of my head how many awards and festivals it won, but I think it was around 50,\" Marcks said. \"I used to keep the list with me, but I don't anymore.\"\n\nMost impressively, \"Lector\" took home the Student Academy Award and just missed the cut for a grown-up Academy Award nomination in the short-films category.\n\n\"It didn't make the final list, but it was right up there,\" Marcks said.\n\nWhen the Massachusetts native got to Hollywood, he shopped \"Lector\" around town but no one hired him to direct. The moguls and agents were only interested to know if he had a feature-length script to sell. He didn't.\n\nAfter sucking up his pride and taking a job as an assistant to an agent, Marcks banged out a script \"while being chained to a desk\" in an office.\n\nThe result was \"11:14\" - a jet-black comedy about five people whose lives violently collide one night at 11:14 p.m. The story is told as a fractured narrative that moves chronologically in reverse.\n\n\"I tend to rebel against the last thing I did and take off in another direction,\" Marcks said. \"This is a perfect example of that.\"\n\nThe unconventional, independent movie attracted a high-powered ensemble cast that includes Oscar-winner Hilary Swank, Patrick Swayze, Barbara Hershey, Colin Hanks (the son of Tom Hanks), Henry Thomas (\"E.T.\"), Rachel Leigh Cook (\"She's All That\") and Stark Sands (\"Six Feet Under\").\n\n\"We only had eight weeks to shoot,\" Marcks said. \"Hilary Swank was available during that window of time so that's when we shot. We got lucky with the casting. All the actors were there because of the script. No one tried to pull any ego trips and did their jobs very professionally.\"\n\nBeing at the helm of a movie with name stars and a $3million budget was not daunting thanks to Marcks' years as a student filmmaker.\n\n\"When you've done a lot of guerrilla filmmaking like I have, you're used to disasters and problems at every turn,\" Marcks said. \"If anything, this took less of a psychological toll because everyone was there doing their jobs. All I had to do was direct my script.\"\n\nWhile he was living in Tallahassee, Marcks was consumed with film school and led an austere life off campus in a cement-block apartment in the shadow of FSU's Mag Lab in south Tallahassee.\n\n\"My apartment was really more like a prison cell with a mattress and one light bulb dangling down,\" Marcks said. \"That or a serial killer's apartment. On nights when I couldn't sleep, I would just ... drive around the Mag Lab. It's like its own city out there. I was also hired as a census worker in my neighborhood. I really saw a different side of Tallahassee than most students.\"\n\nMarcks said he chose FSU over Columbia, where he also was accepted, because he cared more about gaining hands-on experience than the Ivy League brand name.\n\n\"FSU had really good facilities, and it was a small program. I felt like I could stand out,\" Marcks said. \"And you actually got to make movies at FSU. You'd be surprised at the film schools where you never actually get to make a movie.\"\n\nMarcks is keeping busy writing a heist movie and \"doctoring\" an action-movie script for DreamWorks. He's still waiting for the official release date for \"11:14\" to be announced.\n\n\"I don't have a definite answer for you other than some time this year,\" Marcks said. \"Believe me, it frustrates me more than you.\"\n\nThe film hasn't been rated by the Motion Picture Association of America, but don't expect it to get a G.\n\n\"Make sure no one walks in there who's faint of heart, and please don't bring the kids,\" Marcks said. \"It's not rated yet, but it'll definitely be an R. It's definitely for adults.\""
