        "text": "ECHELON CONSPIRACY is a B-movie thriller about a National Security Administration (NSA) computer gaining access to all computers and surveillance cameras in the world for malicious reasons. The pace is quick, the story implausible, and the content grounds for extreme caution.\n\nThe movie opens with a woman following text message directions to her death in a subway tunnel. Then Max (Shane West), a computer security specialist, receives an anonymous gift of an amazingly modern cell phone. The phone begins sending him text messages that show him how to make huge sums of money in the stock market and at a casino. His astounding success at the casino brings John (Edward Burns) from casino security and Dave (Ving Rhames) from the FBI down on his case.\n\nEveryone, from the NSA, to the Casino owner, to the Russians, wants to know who is sending the text messages. The competition to get the answer becomes violent, includes a scene of seduction, and lots of the usual car chases and shootouts. Sadly, the premise is so outlandish that, when the villain is revealed, the movie’s credibility completely falls apart. The final scene is a laughable politically correct twist.\n\nHighly successful thrillers, like the INDIANA JONES movies, are not filled with foul language and sex. They appeal to a broader audience and often even have a moral or biblical message. ECHELON CONSPIRACY comes across as politically correct silliness pretending to be serious action drama."
