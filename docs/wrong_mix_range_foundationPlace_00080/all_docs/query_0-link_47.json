        "text": "Tuition and Education Assistance\n\nProvidence partners with Guild to provide more opportunities for caregivers to grow their careers, with select programs available up to 100% tuition-free. A wider selection of programs are covered up to $5,250 per year, either through tuition assistance or reimbursement.\n\nAll caregiver service qualifies for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) . We partner with Tuition.io to guide all caregivers through their student loans. Parents of college-bound children can also use Tuition.io to learn how to save and pay for tuition.\n\nWe also offer a variety of online and in-person opportunities for caregivers and their dependents to receive an education conveniently and affordably through our partnership with the University of Providence (UP) . Caregivers who use their benefit at UP can participate in immediate tuition reimbursement, providing funds earlier to pay for schooling at the beginning of the term."
