        "text": "Efficient project management is a must-have when delivering projects on time, within budget, and satisfying all stakeholders.\n\nBut what does best-practice project management look like, what are the best frameworks to use, and what features make or break the software you choose?\n\nOur definitive project management guide answers all these questions and more. You’ll learn about project management processes, the best frameworks, and how to manage a project effectively.\n\nGet started\n\nWhat is project management?\n\nProject management is the application of processes, methods, skills, knowledge, and experience to deliver the project goals within scope, time, and budget constraints.\n\nProject management (PM) is the practice of planning and managing projects, from start to finish. It involves coordinating all the necessary activities and resources to meet deadlines and achieve your desired project outcome. For example, your goal might be to launch a new product, develop software, or plan a networking event. To achieve your end goal, project management includes:\n\nSetting goals\n\nScheduling tasks\n\nManaging teams\n\nMonitoring progress\n\nCollaborating with stakeholders\n\nNumerous structured frameworks, such as Agile, Kanban, or Scrum, can help you achieve your project objectives. Although these frameworks take different approaches, each focuses on taking the necessary steps to complete your project on time and within budget.\n\nWhy is project management important?\n\nProject management is critical because it provides the leadership, motivation, and problem-solving that enable teams to introduce new products or services, grow revenue, and meet company goals. If you prioritize effective project management styles, you can proactively and continuously improve workflows to avoid any mistakes, overspending, or other project challenges.\n\nThe most successful companies know how to manage a project to remain efficient and productive.\n\nWho uses project management?\n\nAll types of organizations use project management, from small and medium-sized businesses to large multinationals. Whether you are leading a team in the office or remotely managing teams around the world, effective project management ensures your organization reaches its goals.\n\nProject management encompasses any type of project, including (but not limited to):\n\nProduct and service development\n\nSoftware engineering\n\nEvent planning\n\nConstruction projects\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nIT system implementations\n\nTraditionally, a project manager heads up the project team and is responsible for the project’s overall success. The manager assigns tasks to team members, tracks progress, and ensures that deadlines and budgets are met. However, in smaller teams without a dedicated project manager, several team members can share the responsibility for project management.\n\nA brief history of project management\n\nThe history of project management spans thousands of years, with early examples, such as the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2570 BC and the Great Wall of China in 208 BC, demonstrating the basic principles of organization, planning, and resource management.\n\nThe foundations of contemporary project management were laid during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, with pioneers like Frederick Taylor and Henry Gantt developing methods to optimize workflows and visualize project schedules.\n\n(Image Source)\n\nIt continued to evolve throughout the 20th century when professional organizations like the International Project Management Association (IPMA) and the Project Management Institute (PMI) were established to promote and standardize project management practices. Since then, computer technology, project management software, and agile methodologies have made project management more flexible.\n\nProject management approaches\n\nIt’s important to remember that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to project management. The best methodology often depends on the specific needs and constraints of the project and organization, such as:\n\nProject complexity and scope\n\nFlexibility of the work environment\n\nAlignment with organizational goals and team values\n\nIndustry requirements and regulations\n\nMany successful project managers adapt and combine different approaches to create a tailored methodology that works best for their particular situation. Here are four of the most common project management approaches:\n\nPredictive project management\n\nThe predictive (traditional) approach — also known as the Waterfall methodology — is a linear, sequential process in which each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next. It’s best suited to projects with clearly defined goals and requirements that are unlikely to change. Examples of predictive project management include the Critical Path Method (CPM) and PRINCE2.\n\nAdaptive project management\n\nThe adaptive (agile) approach is a flexible, iterative process that breaks projects into short “sprints,” incorporates frequent feedback, and allows for changes throughout the project. It’s well-suited for projects that may evolve or require adaptability, like product development. Examples of adaptive project management include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP).\n\nHybrid project management\n\nThe hybrid approach combines elements of both predictive and adaptive methodologies. It allows teams to use the best aspects of each approach depending on project needs and can be customized to fit specific organizational requirements. The best example of hybrid project management is Scrumban, which combines elements of Scrum and Kanban.\n\nSix Sigma project management\n\nThe Six Sigma approach focuses on improving quality by reducing errors and defects, and uses statistical tools to identify and eliminate causes of variation. It’s often used in large organizations to improve processes and eliminate waste, and includes methodologies like DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).\n\nWhat are the areas of project management?\n\nThe Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) defines ten key project management knowledge areas. These areas cover the core aspects of managing a project successfully and provide frameworks for planning, executing, monitoring, and controlling projects across different industries.\n\n(Image Source)\n\nIntegration management: Coordinating all aspects of the project to ensure they work together cohesively.\n\nScope management: Defining and controlling what is and isn’t included in the project.\n\nSchedule management: Planning and controlling the project timeline and schedule.\n\nCost management: Estimating, budgeting, and controlling project costs.\n\nQuality management: Ensuring the project meets quality requirements.\n\nResource management: Organizing and managing project team members and physical resources.\n\nCommunications management: Planning and executing effective project communications.\n\nRisk management: Identifying and managing project risks and uncertainties.\n\nProcurement management: Acquiring goods and services needed for the project from external sources.\n\nStakeholder management: Identifying and engaging with project stakeholders.\n\nWhat tools are used in project management?\n\nThe specific tools used in project management can vary based on the methodology — e.g. Agile, Waterfall — and the organization’s needs. Many modern project management software platforms combine multiple tools into comprehensive solutions. Some of the key project management tools include:\n\nGantt charts for scheduling and tracking project tasks and milestones in visual timelines.\n\nWork breakdown structure (WBS) to divide the project into smaller, manageable components.\n\nProject baseline for measuring project performance against the original plan.\n\nDashboards to provide at-a-glance views of project status, metrics, and KPIs.\n\nTask management tools such as task lists, Kanban boards, and calendars for organizing and tracking work.\n\nResource management tools for allocating resources and managing team workloads.\n\nTime tracking and timesheets to log hours worked and track time spent on tasks.\n\nBudgeting and cost management tools for tracking expenses and managing the project budget.\n\nRisk management tools to identify, assess, and mitigate project risks.\n\nCollaboration tools like chat, file sharing, and virtual meeting software to facilitate team communication.\n\nReporting tools for generating status reports and other project documentation.\n\nPortfolio management tools to manage and align multiple projects.\n\nWorkflow automation for streamlining repetitive processes.\n\nMobile apps to access project information on-the-go.\n\nIntegrations with other business software like email, calendars, and file storage.\n\nProject management templates\n\nProject management templates save project managers countless hours when starting a new project. Instead of starting each project with a blank sheet, you can use templates to fill in the placeholders, replicate and reuse the structure of previous projects, and standardize your processes.\n\nHere’s a selection of monday.com project management templates you can use to get your projects up and running in next-to-no time:\n\nSingle project template\n\nProject portfolio management template\n\nAgile project management template\n\nProject workflow template\n\nRisk register template\n\nLearn more in our guide to project management templates.\n\nResource management template\n\nProject cost management template\n\nProject timeline template\n\nProgram risk register template\n\nLearn more in our guide to writing a project plan.\n\nProject milestone template\n\nProject requests and approvals template\n\nLearn more in our guide to project charter templates.\n\nKey project management roles\n\nProject management roles may vary depending on the organization and project size, but these represent the core functions typically involved in project management.\n\n1. Project sponsor\n\nProvides financial and organizational support for the project\n\nMakes critical decisions on resources and budget\n\nCommunicates project progress to stakeholders\n\n2. Project manager\n\nOversees the entire project from start to finish\n\nDefines project goals and creates plans\n\nAllocates resources and ensures the team stays on track\n\nManages budget, risks, and timelines\n\n3. Team members\n\nCarry out day-to-day tasks to complete the project\n\nCollaborate and report progress\n\nContribute expertise to ensure project success\n\n4. Project stakeholders\n\nHave a vested interest in the project’s outcome\n\nMay include customers, suppliers, regulatory bodies, etc.\n\n5. Project customer\n\nDefines project objectives and requirements\n\nApproves the final product or service\n\n6. Project Management Office (PMO)\n\nDevelops standards and policies for project management\n\nSupports project managers and archives project data\n\n7. Steering committee\n\nProvides governance and oversight\n\nEnsures projects align with organizational goals\n\nWhat are the 5 phases of project management?\n\nSuccessful project management begins with designing and following a simple roadmap to set expectations. As Matt Burns, a project manager at monday.com, says:\n\nThe number one thing to do before initiating any project is to outline the project roadmap at the beginning. Because if you want to go somewhere and you don’t have this map, you’re probably going to get lost.\n\nTo help you develop your roadmap, let’s dive into five essential phases in the project management lifecycle. Here’s the high-level information you need to know about each.\n\n1. Initiating\n\nAs with any good project, preparation is vital to complete the work on time and within budget. During the project initiation phase, determine the following to create the project foundation:\n\nProject scope: This covers the specific limits and boundaries for the project, including what you’ll accomplish and what you will not (i.e., the project objectives). Establishing these boundaries prevents something called “scope creep,” where the deliverables change and your project deadlines may get pushed back.\n\nHigh-level project overview: This outlines the resources, time, and goals required to complete a project and a strategy to monitor these requirements over time.\n\nBudgets: You’ll liaise with stakeholders to determine the amount of money available for your project and the cost required to achieve a successful project.\n\nFor larger projects, you might establish a project charter or “Project Initiation Documentation” (PID), which goes into these areas in more depth.\n\n2. Planning\n\nDrawing up a clear and intentional project plan ensures all team members move toward the same goal. During the project planning phase, you’ll:\n\nSelect your project team members\n\nOutline your deliverables\n\nEstimate your required project resources\n\nDetermine any associated activities\n\nSet key milestones and dates, including the final project completion date\n\nDuring this process, you can also outline the team’s project management methodology. There are many to choose from, including the popular options below. We’ll get into more specifics about some of these later in this project management guide.\n\nAgile\n\nWaterfall\n\nPRINCE2\n\nScrum\n\nLean\n\nKanban\n\n3. Executing\n\nDuring the project execution phase, you will carry out the details of your project plan (or project deliverables) to deliver your products to your specific stakeholders. This stage occurs simultaneously with the monitoring and controlling phase (below) and might involve:\n\nManaging workflows\n\nRecommending changes\n\nSuggesting corrective actions\n\nUltimately, it’s about staying in control, collaborating with the entire team, and staying on track.\n\n4. Monitoring/Controlling\n\nConstant monitoring is essential in any project life cycle as it helps project managers answer the question: “Where are we vs. where should we be according to the project plan?” Effective monitoring requires:\n\nRegular, consistent project “check-ins.”\n\nUsing proper project documentation and tracking tools to visualize project progress, such as Kanban Boards, Gantt Charts, and Workload Views — just some of the 15+ dynamic board views available in monday work management.\n\nThe more visual and real-time this is, the better.\n\n5. Closing\n\nThis final step, sometimes known as “project delivery” or the project closeout phase, is when you wrap up all activities and deliver the final product. This handover might be to the client, an internal team, or an external stakeholder. Some additional components could be:\n\nConcluding any formal contracts or agreements.\n\nA full review or audit of what went well, what didn’t go as planned, and how future teams could learn from this project.\n\nWhat are the four types of project management?\n\nYou can use several project management types and frameworks to manage projects successfully. Choosing the right one is crucial because it dictates how you structure your team and how you plan and monitor your projects.\n\nAs promised, here are high-level descriptions of the leading project management frameworks (with links to even more comprehensive deep dives). We also have a great blog on top project management methodologies to further help you understand your options.\n\n1. Waterfall project management\n\nWaterfall or traditional project management focuses on “perfect planning” by breaking down and scheduling the entire project from start to finish. It’s sequential with little room for iteration, meaning that your project will progress through defined stages, with one stage beginning only after you’ve completed the previous stage.\n\nBest for: Teams who can accurately define all project requirements and details upfront, and are comfortable with set-in-stone deadlines.\n\nCheck out our complete guide to Waterfall project management here.\n\n2. Agile project management\n\nAgile is an iterative approach to project management that enables teams to react quickly to project feedback. It’s a popular framework for tech projects such as software development, as it prioritizes adaptability, collaboration, and incremental delivery, which are all essential when testing and adjusting new digital products. Agile project managers break their projects down into small, manageable iterations called sprints, and rely on constant feedback from stakeholders to make quick changes and ensure the final product meets the project goals.\n\nFor many teams, having the flexibility to amend project details is integral to a successful project completion. However, the challenge with using an Agile approach is that it can be hard to scale this framework beyond a smaller team level as it relies on smaller increments and details. Check out our walkthrough to learn more about running your next project using an Agile framework.\n\nBest for: Software development teams working on complex projects with evolving requirements.\n\n3. Kanban project management\n\nKanban project management focuses on continuous improvement by visualizing and managing the flow of work. A Kanban project management board is divided into columns representing different stages of work and tasks move across the board as the project progresses.\n\nUnlike the sequential Waterfall approach, Kanban enables continuous adaptation as teams track tasks, respond to changes quickly, and identify and resolve bottlenecks. It’s an ideal fit for teams with many incoming requests, such as IT teams. To learn more about Kanban project management, check out our guide.\n\nBest for: Projects requiring continuous flow and focus on optimizing work processes, particularly when dealing with maintenance tasks, support requests, or projects with unpredictable workloads.\n\n4. Scrum project management\n\nThe Scrum framework is another popular way to implement Agile project management. It divides larger projects into shorter, 1–4 week sprints that adapt to demands as the project evolves. It also lays out rules for team size, team roles, planning, meetings, deliverables, and more.\n\nBest for: Teams that seek to deliver functioning increments of their work during a project, such as marketing campaigns, product design, or other creative projects.\n\nRead our guide on the Scrum methodology to learn more.\n\n8 tips for successful project management\n\nWith solid project management, companies can develop new products or services, optimize internal business operations, and provide customers with value — all with less friction and more efficiency. These building blocks create innovation and control essential resources like time and money. To help you succeed with project management, we’ve put together eight tips to propel your organization instead of holding it back:\n\n1. Invest in the initiation and planning stages\n\nWhen it comes to answering, “Why do projects fail?” many of the reasons can be traced back to poor planning and research—crucial parts of the initiating and planning stages of the project life cycle.\n\nBy establishing, syncing, and agreeing on key aspects such as organizational priorities, objectives, and requirements early on, you’ll reduce the odds of confusion later.\n\n2. Pick the right framework or methodology for your project\n\nThe second step toward successful project management is finding the right framework or methodology. Whether you use a critical path methodology to determine project duration or a Waterfall methodology to provide clear project stages, your choice of framework will determine how you visualize, prioritize, and complete each project stage.\n\n3. Promote a culture of transparency and ownership\n\nTransparency makes all the difference when managing a project as complexities and sensitivities arise. With a strong culture of transparency, team members and leaders rely on each other to raise flags or take ownership of their work, regardless of how granular or stressful plans get.\n\nThis starts with clear communication, so each project contributor can understand your long-term goals, KPIs (key performance indicators), plans, and where they fit into the puzzle. One way to achieve this is to involve every employee at some level in the planning process, and give them ownership over tasks and deliverables. To do this, a platform like monday work management enables you to create a versatile project management workflow that you can customize to your unique requirements.\n\n4. Decide on a realistic scope\n\nScope creep is a key challenge project managers face when unexpected work or project changes crop up. While this could be related to uncontrollable factors throughout a project, having the right people at the planning table can help you more accurately define the project scope and prevent things from going off track. One way to set realistic scope is to refer back to old project data to make projections.\n\n5. Prioritize efficient scheduling\n\nIf you want your team to stay productive, you need to create work schedules that are realistic to your team’s workloads and the intended delivery date. Balancing these two factors is a worthwhile investment of your time.\n\nClearly communicated schedules mitigate delays and costly setbacks. The type of project management methodology you use shapes communication and can affect how your team uses its time to reach a goal. If you use an Agile framework like Scrum, you will focus on the short-term and smaller deliverable increments. It’s also important to schedule time for things you don’t plan for.\n\nWith a Work OS like monday.com, you can see individual or team workloads with Workload View in the same workspace where you manage calendars, timelines, and resources.\n\nGet started\n\n6. Practice effective resource management\n\nResource management is an important tenet of project management and describes the process of pre-planning, scheduling, and allocating your resources to maximize efficiency. These resources might include people, capital, and other material goods.\n\nAn example of physical resource management could be a contractor managing construction projects — they could decide to book a concrete pourer for two sites instead of having to pay the cost for two simultaneously.\n\nFor digital projects, resources often refer to specific employees or teams. A graphic designer may have several concurrent projects, so you’ll need to plan according to their schedule to complete the job.\n\n7. Engage your stakeholders\n\nA stakeholder is someone directly invested in the project’s success. They could be a key client, internal product user, executive, or product manager.\n\nA successful project relies on strong communication and input between all parties before, during, and after a project. Each stakeholder offers unique insights and perspectives relative to the organization’s goals and the team’s capabilities. monday work management offers collaborative dashboards with 30+ drag-and-drop widgets you can use to display high-level project data, enabling all stakeholders to make fast, sharp decisions.\n\n8.

For example, with monday workdocs, team members can explore and understand in real-time the flow of a project and their part.\n\n2. Create your roadmap and high-level project plan\n\nA project roadmap is a visual, high-level overview of a project’s goals and deliverables organized on a timeline. This is useful for managing stakeholder expectations, communicating plans, and coordinating resources with other teams.\n\nProject management software allows you to create a living and dynamic document that everyone can easily access. Better yet, project roadmap templates like this one from monday.com can help you get started even faster.\n\n3. Build a customized workflow\n\nOnce you have a roadmap or some other high-level project plan, it’s time to get more granular with your workflows.

This feature allows easy assignment of tasks and subtasks to individual employees and teams, empowering everyone to remain accountable for their work. You can even implement automations that send notifications to task owners when a project phase is complete.\n\nIn addition to assigning task owners, it’s also a good idea to give each team member simple responsibilities like reporting on progress during status meetings and identifying their roadblocks. This helps maintain a culture of transparency and builds momentum.\n\n5. Display key data for faster decision-making\n\nTake your projects to the next level with actionable insights, all displayed on dynamic dashboards in monday work management. Here’s some data you might like to track:\n\nTime Tracking Column: This allows teams to see how long tasks take.\n\nCustomizable Status Column: Any stakeholder can see the current status of your projects, and common bottlenecks.\n\nDeadline Column: This date field holds every team member accountable for the project’s success.\n\nOnce you’ve created different workflows, use them as a resource and easily create reports and dashboards. Assess project success against KPIs, then use this data to guide decisions or new projects.\n\n6. Automate repetitive tasks to speed up project management\n\nAutomations can speed up your workflow for more efficient project management. For example, you can notify managers automatically when due dates are passed, create a new task item every week, and more.

There’s a lot of buzz around artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications in the project management sector by automating repetitive tasks and uncovering key insights. In response to this trend, monday work management now offers a built-in AI Assistant, offering a range of generative AI capabilities to automate task creations, email compositions, formula-building, and summarizations.\n\nIndustry professionals like world-renowned technology writer Peter Giffen have documented the power of innovations like AI:\n\nAI could incorporate data analytics and automatically analyze project team data, providing clear indications about how to improve performance.\n\nIn addition to AI, there are three other project management trends we can expect in the near future:\n\nProject managers will need both AI and EI skills: EI — emotional intelligence — is becoming a required skill in the PM space. The ability to understand other humans is critical. Read this article for other essential project management skills.\n\nAdoption of customized or hybrid PM approaches: Gone are the days when a single PM methodology will suffice. Models will likely need to be flexible to accommodate different teams and various projects.\n\nA more diverse team structure: Increasingly diverse teams will bring a wider range of skills, experience, and technology to the table. Teams must learn how to embrace these diversities, to collaborate effectively and efficiently.\n\nWe’ve covered the project management phases, its frameworks, tips for success, and future trends, but what about the key players who will take the project from A-Z? We’re talking, of course, about your team.\n\nWith all this in mind, let’s now look at how to ensure you choose the right people for the project.\n\nHow can you build a productive project management team?\n\nPeople are a core part of effective project management, but how you structure your project team largely depends on your framework and project scope. The good news is there are a few proven strategies for building a successful and productive team.\n\n1. Recruit talent across departments\n\nYour project team will likely come from different departments because projects benefit from and require varied expertise and input. Instead of hiring external talent, you can utilize existing resources and sync multiple departments on a larger organizational goal. For example, a new marketing campaign could require website designers, copywriters, and product managers who are already working for your internal teams. Use a Work OS to audit and display internal skills to build stronger teams for your next project.\n\n2. Choose a project manager wisely and define responsibilities accurately\n\nA project manager could be a professional PM or a subject matter expert (SME) — someone highly knowledgeable in the project area. A professional PM might play more of a facilitating role during initial planning. They allow stakeholders and SMEs to shape the project plan with hands-on experience. Smaller companies may be unable to afford a dedicated project manager role, in which case, an SME or executive is the logical choice.\n\n3. Set an “all hands on deck” expectation\n\nEmpower your team members to exercise their own judgment, push forward by encouraging task ownership, and provide complete transparency of what’s expected in the project’s early stages. With remote working on the rise, you’ll also need flexible tools to accommodate different teams and various projects.\n\nThis is where the right project management software comes in. A tool like monday work management makes it easy to collaborate with team members, break down silos, and achieve more.\n\nCreate workflows your way with monday.com\n\nSuccessful project management requires understanding the right approach to meet your needs.

Various globally recognized professional accreditations, such as the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification, can further help you develop the necessary skills. Finally, networking with other project managers will ensure you stay on top of industry trends.\n\nWhat is the difference between project management and program management?\n\nThe key difference between project management and program management lies in scope, complexity, and strategic impact. Project management focuses on delivering specific outcomes within defined constraints, while program management oversees multiple related projects to achieve broader organizational goals.\n\nAs a result, project managers concentrate on tactical execution and day-to-day operations with defined timelines, whereas program managers take a more strategic view, aligning projects with business objectives over a longer, often open-ended timeframe.\n\nWhat is the difference between project management and project portfolio management?\n\nProject management focuses on achieving a company's unique, short-term goal, while portfolio management focuses on balancing multiple projects that assist with achieving the company's long-term goals.\n\nProject managers concentrate on tactical execution and day-to-day operations of single projects, whereas portfolio managers take a strategic view. They align and prioritize projects with business goals, optimize resource allocation across projects, and ensure the overall portfolio delivers maximum value to the organization."
