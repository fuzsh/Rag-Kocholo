When we received our Phase I funding in 2010 we were two founders. As of 2022, our team within Cisco has grown to 700 employees and growing.\"\n\nMohit Lad CEO, ThousandEyes, acquired by Cisco for $1 billion, according to CNBC (NSF-1058602)\n\n\"NSF helped us refine our vision, figure out if our technology could be used for different applications, and helped us figure out if we can manufacture our technology in a scalable fashion — taking it from an academic project to a real-scale commercial project.\"\n\nShreya Dave Co-founder and CEO of Via Separations (NSF-1831203)\n\n\"We were able to spin out from the University of Washington and get started as an independent company entirely with the support of our first NSF SBIR, and we are incredibly grateful for NSF’ continued support over the years!\"\n\nDavid Younger Co-Founder & CEO, A-Alpha Bio (NSF-1950992)\n\n\"It's no secret that there is a dearth of black and brown women in technology; but for immigrants with accents (like me) things get even more complicated: I look and sound too different from anyone who has successfully led a company to an exit, making it extra hard for me to raise money from investors. Having the opportunity to get non-dilutive funding from an early start has helped not only de-risk our engineering development but has validated me as a founder and built confidence in my business, that I’m betting will grow over the next decade.\"\n\nMaria Artunduaga Founder and CEO, Respira Labs (NSF-2112096)"
