        "text": "The Critical Path Corporation (クリティカルパス・コーポレーション, Kuritikarupasu Kōporēshon) is a multi-planetary conglomerate seen in Macross VF-X2. They pioneered research into the applications of fold quartz, and bankrolled Dr. Mao Nome's 117th Research Fleet to study the Vajra. They also developed and sold weapons to anti-governme nt groups, including opposing forces like Latence and Vindirance.\n\nOverview[]\n\nIt is a multi-planetary organization that has strong ties with military manufacturer General Galaxy and the black market, and were one of the antagonists during the events of Macross VF-X2. It is headed by Representative Director Manfred Brando who had inherited the company after his father's death in 2045.\n\nThe company's rapid growth was due to Brando's ambitions and rumored unethical practices and disregard for human life. They created the powerful \"Jamming Sound System\" that would be use to cripple Earth's planetary defenses leading to its eventual takeover. Despite being a private company, they hold a large private squadron of VF-17 Nightmare. In 2048, they were critical in financing the 117th Research Fleet and developing research on the Vajra and its relationship with the V-Type Virus and fold minerals, things that would play a critical role in the Macross Frontier television series.\n\nNotes & Trivia[]\n\nIn the Macross Frontier novelization, Ozma Lee was dishonorably discharged from the U.N. Spacy after he beat Brando up when he took issue with how his Board of Inquiry was interrogating young Ranka Lee over the loss of the 117th Research Fleet.\n\n[]\n\nMacross VF-X2 Wiki"
