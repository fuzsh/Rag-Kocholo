        "text": "What Is a Project Charter?\n\nA project charter is a formal document delineating the project’s purpose, scope, stakeholders, objectives, and comprehensive plan. It’s an important document for anyone who runs projects, because it’s designed to guide all subsequent decisions and actions.\n\nEssentially, a project charter works like a project’s roadmap. It communicates exactly what the project is about, who’s involved, and how it will be done. It’s the go-to guide for all project decisions, helping keep the project on track and aligned with its original goals.\n\nIt helps prevent scope creep and budget overruns by providing a written reference throughout the project. It also emphasizes stakeholder consideration, ensuring the project aligns with expectations and standards.\n\nWhat is a project charter in project management?\n\nIn project management, a project charter is the foundation of a successful project, offering clarity and direction to the team and ensuring everyone is on the same page.\n\nWhen starting a new project, it’s essential to have a clear plan in place to ensure project success. That’s where a project charter comes in.\n\nAs a primary project timeline reference document, the project charter is there to help you navigate issues that arise proactively. In a sense, it’s to the project manager what a blueprint is to an architect. It gives you an overview of the project in its entirety.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a closer look at the project charter definition and what it entails. We’ll talk about the benefits it brings as well as tips for writing one. And we’ll also share a project charter example, with all the essential components.\n\nWith Wrike, you can easily create and customize project charters to suit your specific project needs, streamlining the planning process and increasing productivity for an improved return on investment. Try Wrike for free today and experience the benefits for yourself.\n\nProject charter vs. project plan: What’s the difference?\n\nEasy to confuse, the project charter and project plan share similarities but serve different purposes.\n\nThe project charter is a high-level strategic overview that seeks to lay out the terms of the project, along with other key details such as relevant stakeholder information. It provides the parameters within which your team must operate in order for the project to be a success.\n\nA project charter is typically created at the initiation stage of the project. When pitching a project, the project charter helps stakeholders understand the rationale behind the project and its potential value.\n\nThe project plan is more of a nuts-and-bolts outline that explains how you’ll go about executing the project on a tactical level. It is developed after the project charter has been approved. In the project plan, there should be a greater emphasis on specific actions, processes, and workflows that will help you complete your work efficiently and to a high standard.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of a project charter?\n\nThe main reason for putting together a project charter is to establish the direction, framework, and guidelines for an upcoming project. Throughout the project life cycle, everyone on the team will be able to refer back to it for guidance, which can help to avoid costly mistakes and setbacks.\n\nA project charter is similar to an essay plan.\n\nBefore writing an essay, you would normally:\n\nResearch to find data that supports your claims\n\nCreate a skeleton structure for your argument\n\nIdentify and address reader objections so you can answer the questions that might emerge in the reader’s mind\n\nContained within a project charter document, the data incorporates all relevant details that are necessary to complete the project. Using that data, you follow a similar process to an essay, where you identify potential objections, which then become challenges that need to be overcome. These objections could come from team members, sponsors, clients, or other project stakeholders.\n\nFor example, objections might include budget constraints, conflicting priorities, resource limitations, or technical problems. By identifying these potential objections early on and acknowledging them in the project charter, the team can proactively plan how to overcome challenges during the project’s execution.\n\nWithout the benefits of a project charter, you’re forced to fumble your way through the project, finding solutions for emerging problems on the fly.\n\nAnother goal of a project charter is to sell the project to stakeholders by demonstrating its worth related to business needs. This helps stakeholders understand the value proposition and potential return on investment of the project. It also serves as a communication tool, ensuring transparency and alignment among stakeholders regarding project expectations and commitments. In essence, it’s like making a pitch to get stakeholders firmly on board and excited about the project.\n\nThe project charter overview\n\nThe project charter typically documents the following parts of the project:\n\nProject objectives and constraints\n\nKey stakeholders\n\nRisks identified\n\nBenefits of the project\n\nGeneral overview of the budget\n\nSuccess metrics\n\nProject objectives and constraints\n\nFirst, outline what your main objectives are for the project. These objectives should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound.\n\nHaving SMART objectives helps guide the project team. It also serves as a persuasive tool when selling the project to stakeholders, making them more likely to understand the project’s purpose and feel confident in its feasibility.\n\nThen, identify potential constraints or obstacles that could prevent you from achieving them.\n\nWhen considering constraints, think about your available budget, team member capacity and general resource management, and other factors such as stakeholder requirements.\n\nTimeline\n\nMap out the estimated start and end dates for the project, along with any milestones you should hit along the way. You can then translate this information to a dynamic timeline model in your project management software to track project progress in real time.\n\nKey stakeholders\n\nIdentify and list every stakeholder with a vested interest in the project and its success. Detail what their role is in relation to the project, what you might need from them, and how you can contact them.\n\nRisks identified\n\nCreate a risk management plan for mitigating or avoiding risks that pose a threat to the completion of your project. First, identify what they might be, then figure out what the best course of action would be for each.\n\nBenefits of the project\n\nConsider and describe how the project will positively impact:\n\nStakeholders\n\nCustomers\n\nEnd users\n\nBe as specific as possible, as it’s important to keep the benefits in mind as you work through the project to prioritize effectively.\n\nGeneral overview of the budget\n\nWrite a high-level financial overview in which you break down your budget for the project, factoring in the funds available and any anticipated costs. This can help you avoid going over budget and also provide stakeholders with a summary of the project finances.\n\nSuccess metrics\n\nDefine the success criteria or metrics of the project, which might include things like key performance indicators (KPIs) or other specific targets for project outcomes. Success metrics are not always included in a project charter, but they can help ensure clarity and alignment among team members and stakeholders regarding project objectives and expectations right from the start.\n\nHow to write a project charter\n\nThere are four clear steps to creating your own project charter document.\n\nStep 1: Understand key project goals and objectives\n\nIdentify and clearly define the vision and scope of the project. This step is essential for creating a project charter, as it establishes the project’s objectives and outlines any constraints or limitations within its scope.\n\nStep 2: Define project organization\n\nList all of the essential roles for the project, including customers, stakeholders, and the day-to-day project team. The project charter should clearly outline the responsibilities of each team member, as this helps to ensure everyone involved in the project is aware of their respective roles and can work together effectively.\n\nStep 3: Create an implementation plan\n\nOutline major milestones, dependencies, and the timeline for the entire team and stakeholders. Dependencies are crucial to consider as they point out tasks or activities that must be completed before others can start, influencing the project’s overall schedule.\n\nThe implementation plan is a critical component of the project charter, as it provides a roadmap for how the project will be executed, including key deliverables. This allows the project team to stay on track and ensure that the project schedule is met.\n\nStep 4: List potential problem areas\n\nThis isn’t about being a downer — it’s more about being realistic. By identifying potential problem areas in advance, the team can develop contingency plans to mitigate risks and address challenges as they arise, ultimately helping to keep the project on track.\n\nWhat do I do once I finish writing my project charter?\n\nOnce you’ve finished writing your project charter, you should have a clear process in place for making sure your project execution goes to plan.\n\nStep 1: Authorize the project\n\nOnce the project charter is complete, it will need to be presented to stakeholders for approval. This step gives the team the green light to kick off work on an approved project. Stakeholder approval is a critical aspect of the change management process because it ensures they are informed about and supportive of the project.\n\nStep 2: Develop a scope statement\n\nThe project scope statement should clearly define what the project will accomplish and what it will not. This helps to establish a baseline for ensuring the project stays on track and that the project team and stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project’s goals and objectives. Any changes to a scope statement will impact the work breakdown structure by potentially requiring adjustments to tasks, deliverables, and project components to align with the revisions in scope.\n\nVideo transcript:\n\n“Hey, what are you working on?” “Just ordering tables and chairs for next week’s launch.” “Were those in the project charter? I thought it was going to be standing room only.” “Well, I heard the RSVPs aren’t coming in like we thought, so I figured I’d fill in the space a little better.” “Maybe, but we’ve got a budget to think about too.” This is why you always need a project charter in project management. It’s a short document that helps keep the project’s priorities and budget front and center for everyone on the team. You see, project charters describe your project in its entirety. Your project charter will include the reasons for the project, the objectives and constraints of the project, how the project will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are. You’ll also outline the benefits of the project, any risks you’ve identified, and a general overview of the budget. When you have a project charter, the whole team can refer back to it. Like say, when you’re about to make a change to how the project will be carried out before getting approval from any of the stakeholders. It’s not hard to put a project charter together. You call a little meeting, make sure the coffee’s hot, and get down to brass tacks. There are four simple steps to create your project charter. First, identify the project vision and outline the scope. Then, list all the essential roles for the project’s organization, like customers, stakeholders, and your project team. Next, write your project plan with milestones, dependencies, and a timeline. And the last and most important part: list potential risks and problem areas, like the potential for low attendance that might require you to pivot and order tables and chairs. With a robust project charter in place, your entire team will have access to the same information, and you’ll be able to avoid costly mistakes and delays."
