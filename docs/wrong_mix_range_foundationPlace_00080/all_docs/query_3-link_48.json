Your level of education will determine the amount of experience needed to complete the program and whether that experience is an entry or exit requirement. Eligibility Requirements\n\nCandidates have three years to complete the requirements of the CIA certification program.\n\nExam registrations are valid for 180 days, or until your certification program expiration date, whichever is sooner.
