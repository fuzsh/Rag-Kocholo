        "text": "The opportunity to study is a fantastic gift. Whatever your starting point is, you can add knowledge and skills.\n\nThe ability to share your talents can be your special way to connect with others and grow with your community. The world is a better place with you and your contribution.\n\nThank you for every effort you make each day.\n\n– Lorena Taraschi\n\nIt is certainly clear that becoming educated allows one to come from a place of power. In today’s world this speaks loudly in a voice that will be heard. Attainment will allow for ongoing opportunities, which include being able to educate and mentor one’s peers.\n\nAt times it feels difficult to attain and I hope that lack of funds is never a reason to stop the process. Becoming educated is always money well spent.\n\nAll the very best,\n\n– Judith Rackham\n\nIf a student is willing life teaches. Chinese proverb.\n\nFocus on the end goal, there are many temptations out there,\n\nThink of Education as feeding the soul,\n\nKeep the circle going we need more educators,\n\nMay your head stay clear and may your heart stay open,\n\nMay your days be bright, may your nights be calm, sleep well and start fresh,\n\nIf you learn from your mistakes they are not mistakes,\n\nThe mind is like a parachute. It doesn’t work unless it is open,\n\nGrowth comes if we make the right choices-Vernon Howard.\n\nNo act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted-Aesop!\n\n– Mickey Parachuk\n\nBe bold, brave, and courageous as you continue to pursue your dreams. Education opens many doors of opportunity but we walk through them and continue the journey with the support of others. Never be afraid to ask questions, reach out, and get support along the way. I’m proud of what you have accomplished so far and I believe in you. There is more to come. Never forget that you are the dream of your ancestors: have gratitude for their sacrifices and be an inspiration for those that follow!\n\n– Natasha\n\nEach one of you are gifts from God, blessed with many unique talents, and worthy of success in all that you hope to achieve. At 76 I am still learning. Have been able to try and succeed at a multiple variety of jobs and hobbies that have given me much joy in life. I’ve been blessed by the strong support of my husband, my children, my friends, and my community of faith. You are not alone in your journey. When the going gets rough, lean on someone from you network to help you move forward. Then return that help when they need encouragement. And remember, your life matters in this world. Keep up the good work, I’m proud of you all.\n\n– Lenna Whyte\n\nYou inspire me! You are the hope of our country and this planet. Whatever you do, no matter how hard it gets, no matter who tells you that you can’t do it, keep going! I am an elder and when I look back on what made me stronger, it was the challenges. Every bit of effort will magnify you success as a person, a community member, a child of this earth. You are a success already. You have started on an amazing journey that never ends!\n\n– Gerry Walsh\n\nIn a recent Parliament of Canada committee meeting, indigenous Tibetans told about the Chinese-language residential pre-school and grade schools being used to assimilate Tibetans against their will. It was moving to hear Tibetans ask for Indigenous Canadians’ advice and support. As you may not know it, I therefore share this, well-known in Tibet:\n\n“NEVER GIVE UP\n\nNo matter what is going on\n\nNever give up\n\nDevelop the heart\n\nToo much energy in your country\n\nIs spent developing the mind\n\nInstead of the heart\n\nBe compassionate\n\nNot just to your friends\n\nBut to everyone\n\nBe compassionate\n\nWork for peace\n\nIn your heart and in the world\n\nWork for peace\n\nAnd I say again\n\nNever give up\n\nNo matter what is going on around you\n\n“Never give up”\n\n― Dalai Lama XIV\n\n– Renée Cosgrove\n\nWhen times are hard – as they sometimes will be – remember to look back and see how far you have come rather than worrying about how far there is to go. You have already accomplished so much and it is all just beginning. Remember that there are so many souls cheering for you and urging you on – even folks who you have never met. Laugh, eat, sleep and start again tomorrow. Reach out to others if you are low; it is a gift to yourself and to those would would lend a hand. The future is by definition unknowable but you are helping to create it. That is everything.\n\n– Michelle Mullen\n\nI am always thrilled to read about the many directions in which young indigenous people are moving in their lives, with a little financial help. You give back so much to us, with the expressions of energy and confidence on your faces. Your lives will be a blessing to us all, bringing the insights from your heritage into a host of professions and enterprises.\n\nTo support you means a great deal to me, coming from settler stock. It is one immediate way to work for reconciliation. And also to meet you as individuals, in correspondence like this, fosters by Inspire.\n\n– Marilyn Jackson\n\nYour present situation isn’t your final destination.\n\nSometimes it feels challenging and overwhelming to pursue a goal when the pressures of every day life need to be the focus for a time. The path to a goal is like a river sometimes calm moving in a chosen direction, occasionally rough waters remind you to stay alert. Unanticipated rocks or fallen trees may require creative solutions and extra time to think a little so you can continue down the river to your destination. You can do it . You will find a way, your unique way to reach that goal. Thank you for striving to get there and being the ‘indspiration’ for others.\n\nGrowing up in an academic family, I was privileged to know that a good education was always a given for me. It is something that I have always encouraged for my own children as well. A wise woman once said to me “an education is a pretty easy thing to carry around.” For many young people, this seems out of reach so I am proud to support initiatives that will help Indigenous students find their way. Education opens doors to possibilities you may not even know exist yet. It is all worth it! The connections you make, the friends you find and the opportunities that are unlocked are life changing.\n\n– Miriam Mann\n\nIn 1988, before you were born, I soloed the Canol Heritage Trail from the Mackenzie Mountains to Dehcho (the big river). This was part of the route used by the Mountain Dene every year in their life of and off the land. Like them, you must make a hard trek to complete your degree. Their skills helped them survive in the traditional times, now you must develop new skills (including life-long-learning) to survive and thrive in the 21st century.\n\nI know you can do it. Make the trek, one step at a time!\n\n– S.R. “Sandy”\n\nDear Student,\n\nJust a note to encourage you on your way through your studies and whatever else is on your plate. You are to be graciously commended for your resilience, especially in light of the history of your people, who have surmounted so much injustice for centuries. You are a new light in the unfolding story of such courage and conviction, in the face of untold tragedy.God bless and keep you, God make God’s face to shine upon you God be gracious and kind to you. God bring you peace and steadfastness on your journey.\n\nTake care.\n\n– Patrick Callaghan\n\nFrom time to time there may be roadblocks, potholes and detours. One of those detours may be a godsend. That happened to me. When I was finishing at McMaster and deciding on graduate school, a prof with whom I wanted to work because of his area of interest declined to accept me, as I was female. That decision caused me to reconsider my future. I wound up at Western, obtained a PhD, did post-graduate work and worked in the pharmaceutical industry for 30 yr. Looking back from the perspective of a retired medical scientist, the road taken has been successful and comfortable.\n\n– Alice Marshall\n\nI see such beauty, dignity and worth in the Indigenous people of Canada. In you and your sisters and brothers here. As a musician I’m so inspired by Indigenous people, culture and art. Both contemporary and ancient. The drums, the singing, the dance and so much more. It gives me such a sense of beauty and joy when I see you and your brothers and sisters excelling in any field of practice, science, business, law, writing, art, music. It is healing. My ancestors created an unjust system of oppression that still exists today. It heals me to see you and your families stronger as we work towards the needed truth and reconciliation. That’s what we all want to see here. We want to see you and your families thrive. I’m grateful for this place that connects the community and allows us to work together towards truth and reconciliation. And I’m so inspired by your spirit, your perseverance, your mercy, your heart.\n\n– Joel Anderson\n\nI was one of the many students who dropped out of high school in the 80’s and went back to high school years later while we raised a family. I was once mistaken for the teacher which made me laugh. This was difficult at times but worth it when I graduated and went further in my education.\n\nI encouraged my daughters to do something in life that they love and achieve higher education to fulfil their dreams. I can see that advice was also shared with the students who benefit from Indsoire. I’m proud to be the mother of two children who achieved more in academic life than I did. One is a nurse who works in an Hospital and the other is a law clerk who moved to Yellowknife to work with the federal government. They both enjoy their chosen professions and continue to learn just for the love of it.\n\nI hope by helping in a small way I can also help students to achieve higher education but also a love of lifelong learning. You are an inspiration to your friends, family and those who will follow in your footsteps. It may seem hard sometimes but it’s worth it. You may even enjoy learning so much you will continue with cultural and/or academic learning and pass it down to your children.\n\nGet your education and go out there and take on the world. I know you can do it.\n\n– Lorna MacIsaac-Rogers\n\nI want to tell you that you inspire me by choosing to continue with your post-secondary education. In some ways, it may seem easier to just get any job after high school that does not require any specific training. However, you’ve been blessed with certain skills and abilities that are unique to you. As you develop those skills and learn how to use them, your sense of satisfaction and accomplishment will increase. Many of your parents and grandparents and generations before them never had the chance to complete high school let alone attend post secondary education. Presently, there is a new understanding in Canada that our governments have not treated indigenous people fairly in the past. I am now realizing that by isolating you and your ancestors, my parents and grandparents have contributed to this inequality and how you have been treated. When I learn that you and other indigenous teens are wanting to reach and develop your potential, I want to support you however I can. Know that I respect your work ethic and want to encourage you to keep aiming high. I want you to be the best that you can be……\n\n– Gerry\n\nDear students of Indspire,\n\nIt was such a blessing for me to assist you in a small way to help you with your education. Once you have an education no one can take that away from you and it is something you will use and benefit from for the rest of your life. Get as much education as you possibly can while the door is open for you. I know you will never regret the gift you have in an education.\n\nWe hope our words lighten the weight of some of your concerns, and remind you that you are not alone.\n\nThe uncertainty you feel is common, and we felt it when we were young as well — but, we both know that with the effects of Covid on our country and economy the challenges are not the same as when we were young.\n\nAs I stated in the opening sentence – I wanted to remind you that you are not alone. It often feels that way, but I can assure you that the local community – your home community, and even the internet community is a connection point to help you during those times. Don’t isolate yourself, rather – look for others that “feel alone” and break the wall that surrounds yourself and them……and, in doing so – you help yourself and the other person.\n\nIndspire has opened the door for US to help out as well — and, we trust that the donations that we and many others send in, will be a help and encouragement to you and others who have a bright future as you strive to grow and learn valuable skills and knowledge. Keep your chin up – DO YOUR BEST – and be proud of your BEST efforts. Learn from your mistakes and share the lessons you learn freely with others. In doing so, we all grow stronger and smarter together.\n\nTake care – and know we’re cheering you on from Winnipeg, Canada !!!\n\n– Brent and Janet Conrad\n\nYou are amazing and an inspiration to me! Back in the 70s I left university because I couldn’t make ends meet. I really thought that I would go back before too long. However, it took me 40 years to go back to my studies. For those 40 years, I felt so disappointed in myself and thought inadequate in so many ways. I want better for you.\n\nYou’re actually doing it. You’re just about there. See that?? That’s the finish line.\n\nThe pride you’ll feel is indescribable. Hang in there and be an inspiration to those coming up behind you. You got this!!!\n\n– Mary Sarsfield\n\nI myself know how challenging and exhausting being a student is. Sometimes, everything just piles on top of each other and it feels paralyzing. I hope you can reflect on why you are a student in the first place and what it is you hope to achieve. Forget about that one assignment that you’re procrastinating and is making you want to rip your hair out. Forget about that upcoming test, or that last test that was trickier than you thought. Just take a second to focus on the “why.” What makes you want to be a student? What can you do for yourself, your family, your community, and the world, through being a student? Schooling is not a linear success experience, so if you are in a pit, please use your resources, get the help you need, and cling onto this “why” to help push you through the tough and uncomfortable times. If you have the passion, determination, and tenacity, you can conquer the pits in the journey and arise victorious. I am so proud of you for making it this far, and please know that there are people cheering you on who know you can do it!\n\n– Sarah Paiva Spadafora\n\nEducation is key to learning and knowing so much about the world, but just as important, knowing and learning about yourself.\n\nWe all need love and support and education is our most profound tool to fashion our lives in order to achieve our goals. Education is the foundation from which one can learn and choose an area of expertise, follow one’s specific dream, and provide inspiration to others, and in doing so, build community.\n\nEducation is an intense manner of acquiring so many skills in a relatively short period of time, and gives us so many abilities to cope with life and its challenges. These skills and abilities are more important than ever in our quickly changing world. Do not be left behind or lost; find your place with education.\n\n– Anna Belle Emery\n\nAlthough I do not know you personally, I know you have worked hard to come this far. Education is a must for YOU and all Indigenous peoples everywhere. Please ensure it makes a difference in your life and in other lives. I came from a poor family who struggled with the costs of my schooling, but it was the most important thing when it came to opportunity and choice. So stay the course. I truly respect what you are achieving and wish you success and a healthy enriching life.\n\n– Geraldine Campbell\n\nHello,\n\nI was privileged to run a cross sectoral leadership program for 3 years, and worked with many young Indigenous leaders from across the country. Their innovation, strength, and pride, was exciting to see.\n\nIt was their intelligence and enthusiasm, that enabled me to finally acknowledge that I had a role to play in reconciliation. I made a commitment to work towards the Calls to Action #92, which is why I work in reconciliation, and chose to donate to this scholarship program.\n\nSo I encourage you to always seek out opportunities to work with existing leaders, as they are eager to mentor the younger generation, and looking to build you up. But mainly I just wish you the best, and remember when you have a tough day it does get better, and there are so many people truly wishing you all the best!!\n\n– Joanne Hughes\n\nIt is an honour and privilege to be able to provide support for you to achieve your dream in obtaining your educational goals and making your family, friends and your community proud of your aspirations. I also want to congratulate you on starting this chapter of your life! One day you will look back on this time at university/college and realize this is a huge turning point for you. The subjects you study and career you are heading towards,the friends you make and keep,the life experiences you choose to have…your options are limitless! Breathe in the freedom of endless choices and life paths. Explore. Think outside the box! We can’t wait to see you receive an Indspire Award one day yourself! As an Indigenous student, you have all of our ancestors supporting you on your journey. Remember that you are not alone!\n\nWishing you the best and much success !\n\n– Natalie Ballentyne\n\nAcademic studies are a wonderful place to be to enlarge one’s view of the world, perspectives on life, and career opportunities (though not always in the ways you expect!).\n\nBut they also are often built on a model of interaction and expectations that can make any one of us feel “not enough” sometimes — like we are slower than everyone else , not clever enough, not “talented” enough. This comes from the academic world’s promotion of what is called a “fixed mindset” – that you are what you are, born with certain skills and talents and not others, that if you are “good enough” in an area you will grasp the material quickly and easily, otherwise maybe it’s not the area for you.\n\nI want to encourage you toward a “growth mindset” instead. This perspective says that we are always growing; that challenge is what promotes growth; that if something seems “easy”, it’s probably not challenging enough; that “talent” is not necessary – just commitment to your learning.\n\nYou are enough and you CAN do this. You’re already on your way!\n\n– Karen Shue\n\nIt’s 35 years ago that I graduated with my Occupational Therapy degree from U of T and 24 years since I last worked as an Occupational Therapist, but getting that degree made all the difference to my life’s journey. Attaining that degree was tough, since I had to take out student loans and work part-time throughout my schooling just to get by. And I remember how jealous I was of those students whose parents paid their way, including holiday vacations to Jamaica! But the work and the worry were worth it. That career set me on my way, first by giving me financial security, while providing me with the satisfaction of knowing I was helping my patients achieve their goals, and then allowing me to branch out in other directions beyond that degree. And that is what I hope your education will do for you: help you develop the tools you need to achieve your own goals, whatever they may be; give you the tools to help make social and/or individual change for others; and open doors to new and wonderful experiences. Hang in through the tough times and hopefully it will be worth it for you too.\n\n– Phyllis\n\nSecondary Education can be daunting and hard sometimes, especially the first year. If you are in difficulty or do not understand something, ask a tutor, friend, or even the prof. Then, the projects that follow will get easier instead of harder. Graduation gives a wonderful sense of accomplishment and the knowledge gained can be very useful too. Not just in the classroom, but also in friendships formed. I am 75 and still have two best friends from my years at Queen’s University.\n\nGood luck to you in your endeavours.\n\n– Cynthia Nidd\n\nTalking specifically to Gareth who’s at Memorial University in St John’s. I went to MUN back in 1968. Just living in a big city was frightening enough without the added pressure of making sure I did well in my studies. I finished my B.Sc. down in Guelph Univ.in Ontario.\n\nYou , however have set yourself a real mountain to climb with both studying and raising a family at the same time. I take my hat off to you.\n\nIt makes me feel good onside to know that a lot of Indigenous, Metis and Inuit people are trying to change their world’s for the better. From all I have read and come to understand about how the world has treated indigenous people of all races I’m so pleased to help anyone who is trying to fight back. As the saying goes ” the pen is mightier than the sword” and all you wonderful people are trying to prove that. Good on you.\n\n– Barbara Gaudry\n\nI know that this time of year can be especially challenging for students as you’re coming up to exams and deadlines for projects and papers. You have made a commitment to yourself and your family and your community to reach for your dreams, and I hope that you will not lose sight of that. You are smart and I know that you can achieve your goals. After many years of working with women giving birth, I know that the path can be hard and for sure painful, but the joy and satisfaction that is the culmination of all that effort is so wonderful. When you feel stuck, try going for a walk and connecting with the trees, the water, the sky; let yourself feel the many ways the Creator is supporting you and all life on this precious mother earth.\n\n– Judy\n\nDear Students,\n\nThere has never been a single person pursing a college or university degree who did not at one point feel discouraged. That is so very normal. I found that the best way to continue when I was struggling — and I did struggle through undergrad and law school — was to find one prof to confide in, to trust in, and to whom I could bring my fears. It was scary at first but the reward was significant. My mentor in law school shared this Beckett quote, “Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” Because you are students and by definition learning, you will have the opportunity to try again. Please know that there are people like me across Canada wishing you on to your heart’s success.\n\n– Kathleen Gallivan\n\nWhen I went to school in the 1950s and 60s, There were black kids, Asian kids, Jewish kids, immigrant kids, and even refugees from the Soviet Union in my classes but no Native kids, no deaf kids, no blind kids, and no kids with learning disabilities, they all went to boarding schools. As a result, most people had no idea that the Indian residential schools were any different than the schools for children with special needs. In the past 20 years, society’s eyes have been opened to the horrors your parents and grandparents endured. It is your own people who have shown us the truth, your own people who, against incredible odds, became teachers, writers, journalists, musicians, lawyers, artists, and leaders. They tore back the curtain of secrets and showed society the truth, while at the same time, showing all Canadians their personal gifts and strengths and demanding national respect and accountability. You are walking in the footsteps of giants. Hold your head high as you blaze new trails. University is hard, one in four do not graduate in four years, but you have your lives ahead of you with enough time to achieve your goals.\n\n– Veronica Leonard\n\nYou are survivors…and more. From the days of my teens and reading about indigenous people around the world I knew that there was something special about indigenous cultures but so sad and shameful in how folks had been treated. Now more and more I’m seeing change come. Now young indigenous people like yourselves in different places we’ve lived – New Zealand and Australia and Nunavut and NWT-are speaking out and claiming pride in their heritage. You are moving past the struggles and horrors of previous generations and owning the future. It won’t always be easy but You’ve got this!! And now, finally, you have the hearts and minds of many many non-indigenous folks behind you as well. You are leaders. You are the Hope for the future. You are so full of potential. You are the culmination of the love your ancestors sent forward to you. Be your best You. I send you love and strength to clear the hurdles and find balance, fulfillment and mostly happiness in your lives.\n\n– Donna Newhook\n\nHey fellow students,\n\nI am a settler living and attending school on the traditional and unceded territory of the Syilx/Okanagan people in British Columbia. I’m taking an Environmental Management diploma program, and recognise the absolute importance of Indigenous perspectives and leadership in repairing the damage done to our natural environment. I am particularly awe-inspired by the work of Okanagan Nation Alliance in returning the sockeye salmon to the Okanagan! Being a student is hard work and a serious financial struggle, but we can do it! I believe in you, and look forward to working with you one day in whatever capacity to help make a positive difference in this world!\n\n– Sheila Kerr\n\nI know sometimes participating in making change happen can seem like a burden. You give me hope that I might see meaningful change in society during my lifetime. Be gentle and kind to yourself and others but be fierce when it comes to standing up for your rights and opportunity to fully participate in whatever field of study you have chosen. Your determination is very important to those of us who are no longer in the workforce and the generations that are coming into it. Remember to breathe deeply when you feel overwhelmed, time passes and you get through whatever difficulties or challenges you face, it is important to celebrate your successes and learn lessons from when things don’t go the way we planned. I am so proud of each and every one of you for taking these steps!!!\n\n– Anne Juneau\n\nTo the students working so very hard in their chosen areas of study, i hope you never lose your quest for knowledge, that your curiosity motivates, and your interest sustains you, throughout your entire lives.\n\nHaving “missed out” on pursuing my education, whether it was financial or lack of self-belief or otherwise, please know that there are many out here like myself who are so very inspired by your determination, and happy to help in any way we can.\n\nMay your experiences of place and people feed your spirit and fulfill you in a way that makes it possible to share and pass on your gifts with others. and please remember there are many unseen hands and voices who hold you and call out their encouragement to, and pride in, you.\n\n– Renée Olson\n\nHaving witnessed the arduous journey my daughter took towards obtaining her Ph.D., while at the same time being the main support of her family and also having 3 of her 4 children during her studies, I am full of admiration both for her and for you all in continuing on the path to higher education. I am honoured to be able to offer any support I can to help along the way, and wish you all the best for now and in the future.\n\n– Deborah Varley\n\nI often think about you.\n\nI am honored to have the possibility to give a hand.\n\nWhen I was about 35 years old I read this phrase: « Integrity is one of several paths, it distinguishes itself from the others because it is the right path, and the only one upon which you will never get lost. »*\n\nYou are walking your own path. You chose the many challenges you are now facing and you are doing your very best to realize your vision. Step by step.\n\nFrom time to time , take a step back, and appreciate your efforts and your journey. Be proud. And be grateful.\n\nI often think about you, and I wish you the best.\n\n– Johanne Ratelle\n\nGodmanchester, Qc\n\n* M. H. Mckee\n\nWhen I look at all that is going on in the world today I sometimes get a little down and feel a bit hopeless. Then I think I think about the youth such as yourselves and I feel a little more hopeful. Never doubt the importance of what you are doing. The indigenous ways are what is going to pull us out of the mess we are in. I’m not only speaking about climate but also as a society. There is so much to learn and to recover and uncover. You are forging a path for future generations. You bring hope not only to the older generations but you also are setting a very important example to the younger generations as well. Thank you so much for your dedication to learning and perserverance despite the adversities you have faced. I wish you success and joy on your journey!\n\n– Bobbi-joWith McGlynn\n\nDear students, I am a happy 90 year old, what I want to tell you is from my own experience.\n\nI never had the chance to go to university but in those days was ok.\n\nWhat I want to emphasize is, today is very important to have a education, please go to school and try to study and have fun at the same time, if you love to learn you will be happy and your Family very proud, you are the future. Love to all of you.\n\n– Maria Ines Burke\n\nThis message of support is geared to indigenous technical students, although I hope those in an non-STEM area will also get something from it. I have a PhD in elementary particle physics from the University of Toronto and have been a long-time member of both the Canadian Association of Physicists and the Canadian Nuclear Society. For over 30 years I have worked in the Canadian nuclear reactor industry. I did not get to this point in my life without some significant struggles. For instance, I almost gave up a number of times in university. What brought me through was not ‘sheer determination’, but key relationships that I could trust, such as friends and professors. Over the years I have learned that to excel in technical pursuits, you need a laser focus on the subject balanced with the recognition that there is a time for everything, and a season for every activity. Allow your life to have other facets beyond your work – things that bring you health and happiness without unwanted consequences. Excel in your pursuits and may they bring you happiness and fulfillment.\n\n– Randall McArthur\n\nI am reminded of a line from a poem that goes something like this, ”there are little eyes upon you and they’re watching day and night, there are little eyes upon you to see what’s wrong and right.” (Apologies to the author who’s name I don’t recall.) You have taken a big step forward and now stand as a role model and leader wether you recognize that or not. Like a pebble thrown into a pond the ripples go on and on and your example can and will inspire others. Continue to have faith in your abilities and trust that there is no growth without struggle. All good things.\n\n– Larry\n\nAs a junior high math teacher, I always used to tell my students to do the very best they could with what they had. Pay no attention to someone else’s negative evaluation of you because only you know how hard you have worked and all the difficulties you have overcome. Keep putting one foot in front of the other until you get to where you want to go. As Brene brown says, the trick is to pick yourself up as many times as you get knocked down. It happens to all of us. I sat outside my advisor’s office and cried with fear and frustration when I was working on my master’s degree. A friend came along, sat down beside me and offered … I don’t know anyone with a master’s degree that hasn’t done that at some point. So I picked myself up and put one foot in front of the other. My counsellor said … when you can’t see very far … go as far as you can see. My high school math teacher constantly told us … nothing ventured, nothing gained. All the best to all of you who struggle to make a difference in this world. My thoughts and prayers and financial support are with you.\n\n– Betty Doherty\n\nAt 86 years of experience I am honoured to be asked to encourage young Indigenous students to press on … it’s in your culture to do so. I have been an advocate for First Nations equality most of my life … I bear a tattoo on the inside of both my forearms as a statement that “Every Child Does Matter”. You may be past that age of development but trust me the child in us never leaves. My peers are nodding their heads … lol! Don’t give up … EVER … your time is fast approaching. The TRUTH is being unveiled for everyone to witness. You ARE the future of our Nation … hold that thought!! If the early migrants … invaders reallly … had pursued your forefather’s way of life rather than forcing their failing culture on your ancestors how great Canada would be today! May Love and Peace envelop your world, and may all manifestations bring you Joy.\n\n– Edgar Murdoch\n\nHi! We have a son who just started his first year of university away from home for the first time. I think what we told him is the same thing I would like to tell you – We are proud of you and everything you have done to get to this point. Ask for help when you need it and surround yourself with people that like you and inspire you to be your best.\n\nGood luck with all that you are doing! Stay healthy and strong. We need you.\n\n– Judy Silver\n\nI am old. I want you to know that I and many others like me want you to succeed and be happy. I was a single mom when I decided to go to university again because I needed to support myself and my kids. I got a grant to go to school to become a teacher when I was 46! I also worked before and after classes every day and took housekeeping jobs when I could get them. I guess I’m writing this to let you know that you are not alone and that we understand what it is to have to get an education the hard way. Keep going! Keep pushing forward, even when you are exhausted and you feel like you can’t do it. Friends and teachers helped me on my worst days…even some counselling. You will get through to achieve your dreams and I wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart, little brothers and sisters! Keep going!\n\n– Gerry Walsh\n\nIt is difficult to be “ the other”, especially in your native home. I know this feeling and the feeling of not having roots or history. My parents were Holocaust survivors and growing up I had no grandparents, cousins or any links to my history. Like Indigenous cultures our history was story based and dependant on surviving elders. As I age, I crave these roots and my curiosity and sense of pride at the ability of my parents to survive, leads me to research and hunt down as much of my history and the history of my “nation”.\n\nThis background makes me find a deep kinship to Indigenous youth.\n\nFor this reason I share elements that helped me find who I am and where I belong. Seek out your history and own it. Love yourself as a result of your roots and bring pride to your ancestors by becoming the best you can be, embracing the world and all its inhabitants!\n\n– Natasha\n\nStand up, be proud. Your ancestors went through a lot so that you can be standing here today. Those seven generations that came before you are proud of you and you are about to embark on an incredible adventure in education so that you can be a good ancestor for the next seven generations. It’s so important that you, your voice, your perspective is part of the conversation at whatever educational institution you choose to attend. Congratulations on your journey so far. Keep it up and remember who you are.\n\n– Jennifer David\n\nIt is an honor to send you a message of encouragement…..getting through school is never easy and I can only imagine it is made that much harder when faced with financial challenges. Your strength and determination will not only help you get through this challenge but it will give you a depth of character that the average person doesn’t have. It will serve you well not only to overcome school but other challenges you may face. Stay the course, it won’t always be perfect but seeing it through to the end is a feeling that can never be taken away from you. They never asked me what my grades where, just if I graduated. Keep at it, one day, one week, one course at a time.\n\nUniversity life is tough and I commend you for your hard work and perseverance. I’d encourage you to continue your focus on what you dream to achieve. Choose your friends and how you spend your time wisely. Like some of you, I worked 20 hrs @ minimum wage while in school. I had to struggle with language since English is my second language. Once I graduated, I faced prejudice and discrimination when applying for jobs. It’s easy to do that, they just needed to look at my name on the resume.\n\nConsider any of these external reactions as distractions. Shrug them off. Believe that you have a place in the world. Believe that you have value/worth. Believe that there is a portion already set aside for you. All you need is persistence in order to grab it. Never stop trying.\n\nI remember what it felt like when I went back to school after over 8 years. Initially,as I sat in class, there were times when I felt like an imposter saying to myself ‘do I really belong here with all these other students?’ I realized though that I had a spark of curiosity, an eagerness to learn and courage to ask questions or give voice to a difference of opinion. Know this,that no matter how long you have been out of school or what you choose to study, you belong in that classroom. Your life experiences will enrich the conversation, your perspective will excite and sometimes challenge another student’s thinking and this is a good thing, because this is how we grow in our learning. Best Wishes for wherever your learning path takes you.\n\n– Catherine Smith\n\nHello All You Amazing Students:\n\nI am moved by your courage to show up, pursue your dream and your passion in the face of many difficulties and barriers. It is a privilege to play a small support in supporting you and cheering you on. May you be inspired by what you are learning, may you reach out for help when the going gets tough and may you sense the encouragement all around you as you engage with the work or learning and living, day by day, week by week. I am proud of what you are doing, great work.\n\nCheers,\n\n– Brent Unrau, Surrey, B.C.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your stories. I am encouraged and inspired by your commitment and perseverance.\n\nPost Secondary education at anytime is a challenge, the pandemic has made that even more difficult.\n\nI have been an educator for over 35 years, now retired, and my best advice is to trust your gut – you have already proved your determination and resilience. When we are trying to learn /process individually or in a team and it just isn’t working – stop, take a break – outside if possible, and when you come back to it try something different. You may want to find another source – the sites or books you are using just may not be”speaking” to you, the way a team has been organized just isn’t productive/supportive. We all learn different things in different ways and finding what works best for you and any team that you are working with is the first step.\n\n– Franklynn Chernin\n\nRemember there is no such thing as failure, unless you give up. Every time you don’t succeed is just a practice session, until you do succeed. Some things take longer to achieve than others. Don’t beat yourself up if every day is not better than the one before as there will be setbacks along the way. It makes success that much sweeter. And when I wanted to put something in perspective I would ask myself to think about what my thoughts on it would be in 5 years time. It’s amazing how many things that I thought were life and death were totally insignificant just a short time later. Hang in there, you are stronger than you realize.\n\n– Deedee Davies\n\nAs a recent graduate during this pandemic, I am rooting for you! I know this has been a hard time. I do not know if this will help but I suggest that you mentally give yourself a gold star for every big or little thing you do every day. I found for me this kept me productive in my studies and it helped me be really active during this time. I was able to thrive as a student in the pandemic and I want you to as well. And also, it’s okay to self-care if you need to. Without you, there can be no you that can do the things you’re currently working hard for.\n\nI hope as support for you grows, especially in recent months, that things can get better for you. Canada needs you and all of your voices contributing to make it a better place!\n\n– Zain Rajani\n\nCongratulations – to use baseball imagery, you have stepped up to the plate, and you are going to hit that ball wherever you want it to go! Be careful to stratagize: better to be present and aware every moment than count on being the one who hits the ball out of the park. (In other words, divide up your assignments into doable parts even if it means doing some early; don’t be the student who tries to cram 5000 exams and papers into the last week!) And don’t forget to have fun. At least once a week, laugh yourself silly, stop to smell a wild rose, hug somebody, let yourself be hugged back, and enjoy the whole experience of being you.\n\n– Suzanne Edgar\n\nI didn’t have much growing up but we had a happy family until my teens when i lost my brother and my dad. I really wanted to go to Art school but that was out of the question-no money. I got a student loan and did a one year course that got me into the work force. I eventually got my BA at night school and it took almost 15 years but I did it. I was the first person in my family to get a BA.\n\nI know most of you have had a lot to deal with in your young lives but you can’t let that hold you back. With some determination , you can do it. You deserve it. You have a right to it.\n\nI hope we’ll have a better world in the future where we can all feel equal. Together, let’s make that happen.\n\nGood luck to you in your future endeavours. I’m rooting for you!\n\n– Helen Duplassie\n\nYou can absolutely 100% do this. I went back to university a couple years ago, in my early forties, to pursue a degree that was much more academic than my first, and there were so many times I felt lost and incapable. More than once I took a moment to wonder why the heck I had decided to do this. But those moments passed, and I learned. I pushed myself, and I learned. I stumbled, and I learned. Those moments are part of the journey, say hello to them, breathe, and then keep going. I believe in you!\n\n– Erin Millar\n\nI’m a bilingual Secondary School teacher.\n\nI can’t begin to humbly feel, know and much less understand the past. However, the only thing that I know which brings success to anyone, is firstly, not to give up, and secondly, only repeated and continued hard work can bring you success. ‘YES WE CAN’ (Obama). ‘Remettez cent fois votre métier à l’ouvrage’. The translation that comes closest would be:\n\n‘Don’t give up, and keep that resilience going, no matter what,’ Or ‘Put your craft back to work a hundred times’.\n\nDo not frown on your past, and regret the struggles, hardships, nor the obstacles, for it is because of that suffering which has shaped you into the person you are today, with all the knowledge and experience, not forgetting what you had to endure that defines you, and become that special person that you are.\n\nThere is hope, and when we think there isn’t, at that very moment, suddenly, hope always springs up to manifest what was already there.\n\n– Joyce Gagnon\n\nKnowing that you are engaged and dedicated to your studies inspires me. You will the leaders of the future, and that gives me great hope for family, our country and world. When things get tough, remember that you are not alone. Reach out to those around you, help and support is all around you, all you have to do is ask! Also, remember to take care of yourselves and take time out for fun it will give you new energy and passion for your studies.\n\n– Crystal Sissons\n\nRemember this note of encouragement when you’re half awake at 4:00am trying to finish an essay for an irritating professor: every single thing you do can be a gift to this world. You just have to have the courage to make that choice. And you, my friends, are already so courageous! You are strong and resilient and influential and determined. Even though it might be late and you can’t stretch out the words in that essay any longer, remember the hugely important impact you as students have on others. On your family. On your friends. On people who wholeheartedly support your mission to Indspire this world. I know that I am not alone when I say that your courage is noticed. We as Canadians are here for you. Be proud of yourself and be proud of your identity–and don’t give up on that essay!!\n\n– Naomi\n\nLife is super tough, I’m sure we can all agree on that. In moments of discomfort, difficulty, and challenges, just know that nothing is permanent. This too shall pass.\n\nIt can be easy to get caught up in our stories and our thoughts — and in this moment, what can you do to take care of your mind, body and spirit? Sometimes it’s easy to sacrifice ourselves for a greater purpose. Taking care of ourselves with compassion and warmth can help us be that much more impactful in the work we do, whether it’s studying for a final or standing up against oppression and social injustice.\n\nMay you find peace, grace and warmth in your journey. You’re doing great. I love you and I believe in you!\n\n– Juno Kim\n\nPlease continue to pursue your dreams and your goals and your passions – Canada needs you as leaders and teachers, including leaders in government, leaders in health, leaders in education. We hope you will share your wisdom and your ways of seeing, and your culture, voices and stories. I pray within my heart that the eyes and ears of Canada open to you, like a flower turning towards the sun. Bring your light and be your true self in whatever path you are choosing. Even though our paths may never cross, please know in your heart that there are many people, like myself, cheering for you and wishing you success and happiness.\n\nPlease keep going, you are important, and you can make amazing things happen for your generation and generations to come. You can do it.\n\n– Meaghan Jefferson\n\nIt is been my pleasure to help in the smallest way to assist any student to get an education. I believe education is instrumental to a successful life and the more people that can get an education the better chance we have of making the world a better place. I wish every student who might have the opportunity to receive an Indspire bursary or otherwise every success in their education and their lives ahead. All the best to you all.\n\n– Karen Chow\n\nCompleting school while working and juggling family and other responsibilities is hard. I know, since I am doing it too! While you are and will always be more than your grades, remember your final goal and why you wanted to study your subject in the first place. It helps to picture what your educational goal will add to your life, and imagine how good it will feel to have finished your studies, the sense of pride and accomplishment you will have that no one can take away. Imagine how it will benefit your families and communities, or how you can use it to make an impact in the world. You are showing impressive courage, optimism, and perseverance, and you are proving to yourselves and the world that you can do it! Keep going. You’re on your way.\n\nTo all the students who are working hard each and everyday to pursue their studies, know that you are investing in yourself, in your future and in your community at large and I thank you for that. As a lifelong learner myself, I strongly believe that getting an education broadens our knowledge, invites us to see/learn other points of view, encourages us to meet others and push the boundaries of our comfort zone and is more than worth the effort. I wish everyone all the success they deserve. And I hope that you will continue to learn all through your lives and inspire others to do the same. Bravo to all and keep on learning!\n\n– Francine Poissant\n\nGood Morning my friend,\n\nI grew up during WW2 and the London, England blitz and the food shortages and I did NOT finish High School. On Saturdays I had been working in Woolworths and when I left school I started work as an office Junior. I emigrated to Canada in 1965 in my early 30’s and married for a second time. At age 39, almost 40 I gave birth to a wonderful son (now aged 48 this month. And when he was growing up I started going to York University. BTW U of T had turned me down because I had never completed High School. Then, when I had some A’s and B’s from York U of T accepted me and because I took 2 summer courses as well every year, I graduated with a BA after 4 years. Now, it wasn’t easy and I self diagnosed that I have always had ADD (attention deficit disorder). The whole experience for me to study/read/write essays and exams – I liken the experience to ‘pulling teeth’. All to tell you that it was all worth it just to know I could finally attain a degree. My advice to you my friend is simply this: HANG IN THERE it is all worth it to know you have achieved something so important. I have my Graduation photo on the wall to the left of me and the BA Certificate in front of me as I type this to you. I should explain that I am sitting in a small space so these reminders are close to me. I send you my Best Wishes and all the encouragement I can offer. And finally, one step at a time go on to get your MA and then your PhD. Love June Gurvich born August 21 1933.\n\n– June Gurvich\n\nFirst I’ll say that I’m proud of you for taking this path, and having the initiative to pursue your studies, and showing that you have the stamina and determination to continue in the face of a world that the pandemic has changed, at a time when finances may be challenging. Just making the commitment to education is an accomplishment, and I applaud you for that. I hope that by offering some financial support, I can make your burden a little lighter, and you can enjoy these years more, and benefit greatly from your learning.\n\n– Maria Borkowski\n\nAgainst all odds.\n\nI’m a woman that owns and runs a construction company and must compete with my male counterparts. Yes, there is still inequality.\n\nHere is what I’ve learned throughout my career. The most important thing is “Set Goals” – if you don’ t know where you are going, how do you know when you get there?\n\nDrown out the negative and keep your thoughts positive because you know you can do this!\n\nYou can make a change.\n\n– Zuzika Hoare\n\nLast year in March I stood, as a white ally, with Wet’suwet’en and others at the legislature in Victoria. I learned a great deal during those cold days that were days of inspiration. The most important thing I learned was the power of leadership by the Indigenous youth leading those days, youth who were hard at work on university degrees. I think in 50 years or less, Canada will be fortunate to be run by Indigenous peoples, such as you who are now studying against tremendous odds in many cases, I am happy to have recently discovered Indspire and to support you. I am 79 this year. I have a Master’s degree in Psychiatric Nursing and a PhD in Clinical Psychology. Education along with personal trauma healing is a power combination. Keep at your studies no matter how tiring or tedious. Keep your end goal in sight and all the annoyances and difficulties of the moment will be background to your goal in the foreground. Do self care each day. Go out into Nature even if you only have 10 minutes with a tree’s wisdom. Or a rock’s which you can carry in your pocket to remind yourself of all the love and support you have, from people you know and people you have not yet met. Women, support each other. Get a doctorate so men are less able to talk down to you as you stand, a leader. We would all like sexism to be a thing of the past, but it is not, any more than racism is. I look forward to reading more stories of your successes and to supporting you as I am able.\n\n– Naida Hyde"
