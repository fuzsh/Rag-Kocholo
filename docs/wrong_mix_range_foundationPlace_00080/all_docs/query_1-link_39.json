        "text": "CPM or the Critical Path Method is an algorithm used in project management that is used to schedule project activities. The critical path refers to the longest stretch of the activities, and a measure of them from start to finish.Â\n\nGetting certified as a project management professional is simple with Simplilearn's PMP Certification. Take advantage of this opportunity by enrolling now.\n\nWhat is the Critical Path Method (CPM)?\n\nA strategy for surveying plan adaptability and distinguishing undertakings fundamental for project culmination is the critical path method (CPM). In the project, the executives, the basic way is the longest succession of undertakings that should be done on time for the task to be done. If crucial tasks are postponed, the project will also be delayed.\n\nCPM Key Elements\n\nThe elements of CPM in project management are as follows:Â\n\nEarliest Start Time (ES)\n\nThe initial stage in the project is when an activity can be begun. You cannot make this decision without initially understanding whether you have any task dependencies.\n\nLatest Start Time (LS)\n\nThe very last second when a task can be started without affecting the timeline for your project.\n\nEarliest Finish Time (EF)\n\nThe earliest a task can be finished is determined by its duration and earliest start time.\n\nLatest Finish Time (LF)\n\nThe latest that a task can be finished is calculated using its duration and latest start time.\n\nFloat\n\nThe concept of \"float\" refers to how long an activity can be postponed without affecting its task order or the project timeline. The critical path tasks have no float since they cannot be delayed.\n\nWhy Use the Critical Path Method?\n\nCPM can advise sage on setting priorities, distributing resources, and scheduling projects.\n\nThere are various reasons to use this method, including the ones listed below:\n\nImproves Future Planning\n\nImproves future planning by utilising CPM to compare expectations with actual progress. Future undertaking thoughts can be affected by the information accumulated from progressing projects.\n\nFacilitates More Effective Resource Management\n\nIt lets project managers prioritise tasks, giving them a better understanding of how and where to deploy resources.\n\nHelps Avoid Bottlenecks\n\nProject bottlenecks can cost precious time. By outlining project dependencies using a network diagram, you can more accurately decide which tasks can and cannot be finished in parallel. After that, you can adjust your schedule accordingly.\n\nWith the help of CPM, weâll be able to create a model that enables you to determine the following:Â\n\nTasks required to complete the project\n\nDependencies between tasks\n\nThe duration required to complete an activity\n\nNow, before we can get started with CPM or Critical Path Method, weâll have to understand two major concepts which are Events and Activities. To help understand them better, letâs have a look at the network diagram (which is also the output) of the process.Â\n\nThis output represents some of the most important parts of the process: Events and Activities.\n\nEvent\n\nEvents are represented by a circle and will occur at the start and end of an activity. Event 1 is the tail event and Event 2 is the head event. In the case of our example, the events are 1, 2,3,4, 5, and 6. Taking into consideration, nodes 1 and 2, and the connection between them, 1 will be referred to as the tail event, and 2 will be referred to as the head event.Â\n\nSimilarly, for 2 and 3, 2 is the tail event, and 3 is the head event.Â\n\nActivity\n\nActivities represent action and consumption of resources like time, money, and energy required to complete the project. In the case of our example, A, B, C, D, E, and F represent the activities taking place between their respective events.Â\n\nDummy Activity\n\nA dummy activity represents a relationship between two events. In the case of the example below us, the dotted line represents a relationship between nodes 4 and 3.\n\nThe activity between these nodes will not have any value.Â\n\nOther rules to consider\n\nThe network should have a unique starting and ending node. In the case of our example, event 1 represents a unique starting point and 6 represents the unique completion node\n\nNo activity can be represented by more than a single arc (the line with an arrow connecting the events) in the network\n\nNo two activities can have the same starting and ending node.Â\n\nNow, letâs talk about the process of the Critical Path Method with an example.Â\n\nThe Critical Path Method\n\nThe objective of the question below is to determine the critical path, based on the information available, like activity, immediate predecessor, and duration (which in this case, weâll take as months)\n\nFirst, letâs analyze the activities and their immediate predecessors.Â\n\nActivities A, B, and C donât have any immediate predecessors. This means that each of them will have individual arcs connecting to them. First, weâll draw nodes 1 (which is the starting point) and 2. Weâll add the activity on the arc, along with the duration.Â\n\nWeâll have to also keep in mind that A acts as the immediate predecessor for both nodes E and F. Similarly, letâs draw the arcs for nodes B and C.Â\n\nBefore we can draw the nodes for activity D, a quick look at the table will tell us that it is preceded by activity B and that a combination of activities C and D act as immediate predecessors for activities H and J. This means that both activities C and D have to connect at some point. Thatâs why weâll be drawing an arc from events 3 and 4.Â\n\nSo now, weâve completed activities A, B, C, and D of the critical path method. Next, letâs take a look at activity E.Â\n\nActivity E is preceded by activity A and acts as the immediate predecessor for activity J. Since this is an independent activity, weâll be able to draw an arc like this.\n\nIf we have a look at activity F, itâs preceded by activity A, and a combination of F, G, and H act as immediate predecessors for the activities K and L. So letâs wait before we take it up. Instead, letâs shift our attention to activity G. Itâs preceded by B. So, weâll draw it like so.\n\nNow, letâs take a look at activity H. It is preceded by both C and D and will act as the immediate predecessor for K and L, along with F and G. So, we can connect node 4 to 6.Â\n\nNow that weâve done that, letâs go back to activity F.Â Now that we know where activities G and H connect to, we can combine nodes 2 and 6, fulfilling the conditions required for activities K and L.\n\nFollowing this, we have an activity I. The activity I is preceded by activities C and D. It also acts as an immediate predecessor to activity M. Since itâs an independent activity, we can draw it like so.Â\n\nNext, letâs take a look at activity J. Activity J is preceded by activity E. We can also see that a combination of J and K will act as an immediate predecessor for activity N. We can then draw an arc like this.Â\n\nLetâs go on to activity K. Here we can see that K is preceded by F, G, and H. It also acts as an immediate predecessor to activity N. So, weâll connect nodes 6 to 8.Â\n\nNext, letâs continue with activity L. The table now shows that L, M, and N donât act as immediate predecessors for any other activity. Hence it can be assumed that itâll connect to the final node.Â\n\nL is preceded by activities by F, G, and H. The arc can be drawn like so.Â\n\nWeâll now go to activity M. This activity is preceded by activity I. Similarly, we can connect an arc from node 8 to 9 for activity N.Â\n\nNow, the network is complete!Â\n\nNow, to find the critical path. For this, weâll need to find two values, Earliest Start Time (Es) and Latest Completion Time (Lc).\n\nThe process of determining the Es for all events is called a forward pass.Â\n\nThe process of determining the Lc for all events is called a backward pass.\n\nLetâs get into the forward pass. For this, first, weâll need to create boxes at all nodes. These are then divided into two. The lower half of the box represents the earliest start time of the node, while the upper half represents the latest completion time.Â\n\nYour network diagram should look something like this.Â\n\nFor this, weâll be using the formula, Esj = max (Esi + Dij)\n\nWhich when simplified, the earliest start time for the second node (head node), is the maximum of the combination of the earliest start time of the tail node and the duration between the two nodes.Â\n\nSo, for node 1, the earliest start time is always zero.Â\n\nFor node 2,\n\nit would be, Es2 = 0 (earliest start time for node 1) + 3 (duration between 1 and 2) = 3\n\nFor node 3,Â\n\nit would be, Es3 = 0(Es1) + 4(D1 to 3) = 4\n\nFor node 4, we can see that two arcs connect to it. This means that weâll need to choose among the largest of the two options available to us.Â\n\nEs4 = 0(Es0) + 6 = 6 or\n\nEs4 = 4(Es3) + 3 = 7\n\nWeâll choose 7 since itâs larger.\n\nSimilarly, we have three options to choose from when it comes to node 6. Since three arcs connect to it.Â\n\nEs6 = 3(Es2) + 1(D2-3) = 4\n\nEs6 = 4(Es3) + 4(D3-6) = 8\n\nEs6 = 7(Es4) + 5(D4-6) = 12\n\nHence weâll select the last option since itâs the largest among the three.Â\n\nNow, for node 5. Since itâs directly connected to node 2, we can directly apply the formula.Â\n\nEs5 = 3(Es2) + 9(D2-5) = 12\n\nLetâs take node 8.Â\n\nEs8 = 12(Es5) + 3(D5-8) = 15 or\n\nEs8 = 12 (Es6) + 6(D6-8) = 18Â\n\nWeâll choose Es8 as 18 since itâs the larger of the two.Â\n\nNow for node 7. We can directly apply the formula to these nodes.\n\nEs7 = 7(Es4) + 4(D4-7)Â = 11\n\nFinally, weâve got node 9.\n\nIt has 3 nodes connecting towards it. Weâll have to choose the maximum of the three.Â\n\nEs9 = 18(Es8) + 9(D8-9) = 27\n\nEs9 = 12(Es6) + 3(D6-9) = 15\n\nEs9 = 11(Es7) + 6(D7-9) = 17\n\nWeâll choose the arc from node 8 since itâs got the highest value.Â Â\n\nAnd like that, the forward pass is complete. Now, for the second part of the critical path method.Â Letâs take up the backward pass. For thatâ we will be using the following formula.Â\n\nLci = min(Lcj - Dij)\n\nThis, when put simply, means the latest completion time of the tail node is equal to the latest completion time of the head node minus the distance between the two.Â\n\nLetâs start from the final node, number 9.Â\n\nThe Lc for this node will always be equal to its Es.\n\nSo, Lc9 = 27.\n\nNext, letâs have a look at the latest completion time for the 8th node. Since itâs directly connected only to the 9th node, we can directly apply the formula mentioned earlier.Â\n\nLc8 = 27(Lc9) - 9(D9-8) = 18\n\nNow, letâs have a look at the latest completion time for node 7. Since thereâs a direct connection between nodes 9 and 7.Â\n\nLc7 = 27(Lc9) - 6(D9-7) = 21\n\nLetâs move on to node 6. As we can see in the diagram, there are two points extending to nodes 8 and 9 from node 6. So we have two options to choose from.Â\n\nLc6 = 18(Ls8) - 6(D6-8) = 12 or\n\nLc6 = 27(Ls9) - 3(D6-9) = 24Â\n\nWeâll choose the Lc of node 6 as 12.\n\nWeâll now go to node 5. Since itâs directly connected to the 8th node, we can directly apply the equation.Â Â\n\nLc5 = 18(Lc8) - 3(D5-8) = 15\n\nNext up, letâs find the latest completion time for node 4.Â\n\nSince there are two connections extending from the node, to nodes 6 and 7 respectively, weâll need to select the minimum between the two.Â\n\nLc4 = 21(Lc7) - 4(D4-7) = 17\n\nLc4 = 12(Lc6) - 5(D4-6) = 7\n\nWeâll choose 7 as the latest completion time for node 4.Â\n\nNow for node 3.Â\n\nSince there are two nodes connecting from node 3 to nodes 4 and 6. So, weâll need to choose between the 2.Â\n\nLc3 = 12(Lc6) - 4(D3-6) = 8 or\n\nLc3 = 7(Lc4) - 3(D3-4)Â = 4\n\nWeâll choose 4 as the latest completion time for node 3.Â\n\nLetâs now go to node 2. Again, since there are two connections made from 2 to node 5 and 6, weâll need to choose the minimum among the two.Â\n\nLc2 = 15(Lc5) - 9(D2-5) = 6\n\nLc2 = 12(Lc6) - 1(D2-6) = 11\n\nWeâll choose the latest completion time of 2, as 6.\n\nAnd finally, we have node 1.Â\n\nSince there are connections to 2, 3, and 4 from 1, weâll need to choose from the three.\n\nLc1 = 6(Lc2) - 3(D1-2) = 3\n\nLc1 = 4(Lc3) - 4(D1-3) = 0\n\nLc1 = 7(Lc4) - 6(D1-4) = 1\n\nWeâll choose 0 as the latest completion time for the node.\n\nAnd there we go! The backward pass is complete.Â\n\nNow, for the final step of the critical path method. To determine the critical path, there are three major criteria that need to be satisfied.Â\n\nEsi = Lci\n\nEsj = Lcj\n\nEsj - Esi = Lcj - Lci = Dij\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that nodes that satisfy the requirements are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.Â\n\nHence the activities on the critical path are B - D - H - K - N.\n\nHence the critical path is B + D + H + K + N = 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 27.Â\n\nAnd there we go! Weâve found the critical path!Â\n\nPros and Cons of Ssing CPM\n\nThe pros and cons of the critical path method (CPM) are as follows:\n\nPros of Using CPM in Project Management\n\nThe pros of using CPM are as follows:\n\nEffective Communication: All phases of a project's life span must be considered when creating critical path method schedules. The program's structure becomes more achievable and firm when the skills shared by various team members are integrated.\n\nEasier to Prioritise Tasks: Project managers can more effectively prioritize tasks and estimate the float of each one by determining the critical path. Float indicates the amount of time a task may be put off before it affects when it will be completed. A lower float indicates a greater priority.\n\nAccurate Scheduling: CPM is a popular and dependable methodology for enhancing the precision of project schedules. Several project managers utilize CPM with the Programme Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), which supports teams in estimating overall project length.Â\n\nBetter Visualisation: Gantt charts and CPM network diagrams, which show critical path timelines, can help project managers understand a project's timeline and progress more quickly. These visual tools allow them to understand a project's direction more intuitively than a less eye-catching alternative.\n\nCons of Using CPM in Project Management\n\nSome of the cons of using the critical path method are as follows:\n\nMultiple Complexities: Several moving elements and detailed computations are involved in the CPM. The software may automate the computations, but entering accurate data requires thorough research and leaves room for human error.Â\n\nLimited Applicability: Not every project type is suited to the critical path method. Projects requiring creativity, like product design or research work, that tend to come along in unforeseen forms fail to lend themselves well to CPM.\n\nLess Understanding of Resources: The critical path method also lacks sufficient understanding of how resource limitations impact project schedules. The accessibility of equipment or labor resources is not considered in the network diagram or CPM schedule.\n\nStep by Step Guide on How to Find the Critical Path With Examples\n\nThe time of essential and non-critical tasks can be used to identify the critical path. This is a list of the steps, along with examples.\n\nList Activities\n\nList all the venture exercises or errands essential to create the expectations utilising a work breakdown structure. The rest of the CPM is built on the list of activities provided in the work breakdown structure.\n\nIdentify Dependencies\n\nChoose the occupations based on your work breakdown structure that is interconnected. This can identify any task that can be finished alongside other chores.\n\nThese task dependencies are based on the example mentioned above:\n\nTask A is necessary for Task B.\n\nTask B is necessary for Task C.\n\nC and D can be carried out concurrently.\n\nTask D is necessary for Task E.\n\nTask F depends on Tasks C, D, and E.\n\nAn activity sequence, which will be utilised to identify the critical path, is a set of dependent tasks.\n\nCreate a Network Diagram\n\nThe network diagram, a flowchart that depicts the order of tasks, must then be created from the work breakdown structure. Each task should be represented by a box, with task relationships shown by arrows.\n\nUntil the overall project timetable is determined, you will add other time-bound components to the network diagram.\n\nEstimate Task Duration\n\nYou must first estimate each activity's length before determining the critical path, which is the longest series of critical tasks.\n\nTry these to get a sense of the time:\n\nUsing knowledge and experience to make educated assumptions\n\nEstimating using information from past projects\n\nEstimating using established industry practices\n\nTry the forward pass and backward pass technique instead:\n\nForward pass: This method uses a previously stated start date to determine early start (ES) and early end (EF) dates. ES is the direct ancestor with the highest EF value; EF is calculated as ES plus duration. The calculation begins at ES of the first action with 0 and moves forward through the schedule. Establishing ES and EF dates enables early resource allocation for the project.\n\nA backward pass determines the dates for late starts (LS) and late finishes (LF). LF is the lowest LS value among immediate successors, and LS is LF - duration. The calculation begins with the final action on the timetable and works its way backward.\n\nThe scheduling flexibility of each activity can then be determined using the early and late start and end dates.\n\nCalculate the Critical Path\n\nAlthough the critical path can be determined manually, adopting a critical path algorithm can save time.\n\nBelow are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Next to each action, note the start and end times.\n\nThe initial activity lasts for the allotted period and starts at 0.\n\nThe start time of the next activity is determined by the finish time of the previous one, and the end time is calculated by multiplying the start time by the duration.\n\nDo this for each activity.\n\nStep 2: To discover how long the entire sequence lasted, look at the last activity in the sequence's end time.\n\nStep 3: The critical path is the series of operations that takes the longest time.\n\nYou can construct the entire project schedule around the critical path once it has been identified.\n\nCalculate the Float\n\nIt illustrates how much extra time could be added to the task without impacting other activities or the project's deadline for completion.\n\nThe project's degree of flexibility can be determined by identifying the float. Use the resource known as \"float\" to cover project risks or unforeseen problems.\n\nThe dates of critical tasks are fixed since they have zero floats. Positive float tasks go on the non-critical route, where their delay won't affect the project's completion. Non-critical jobs might be skipped if you need more time or resources.\n\nDealing with Contingencies and Constraints\n\nTwo ways to deal with contingencies and constraints in CPM are as follows:\n\nFast Tracking\n\nFast-tracking is the method of carrying out several tasks on the critical path while simultaneously minimizing the project's duration. Fast-tracking is feasible for tasks that lack \"difficult\" attachments or don't start completely dependent on previous tasks. Fast-tracking necessitates more resources.Â\n\nCrashing\n\nCrashing is a process of allocating additional resources to your project to complete it in a faster and more efficient way. Crash durations are effective in projects that would benefit from additional resources and can use some resources from tasks with higher floats.Â\n\nCritical Path Method Software\n\nPrograms or software specifically designed for project management that lets you create critical path schematics for a given project are called critical path software or CPM software. These tools make your daily activities easier by helping you analyze, schedule, and manage project tasks, reliance, and resources.\n\nHere are some of the critical path method software:Â\n\nOffice Timeline\n\nSmartsheet\n\nZoho ProjectsÂ\n\nLiquidPlanner\n\nProjectManager\n\nWrike\n\nnTask\n\nLucidChart\n\nFeatures of Critical Path Software\n\nThe general features of critical path software are as follows:\n\nComplete process visibility using Gantt charts and Kanban boards\n\nSet a task, an overview of the task, assignees, and to-do lists\n\nInteract on discussions or challenges to projects\n\nMake dependencies between tasks\n\nSet both the actual and projected dates\n\nControl spending and produce a financial summary\n\nIdentify challenges and risks, eventually delegate them\n\nIntegrations by third parties\n\nTrack your tasks\n\nKey Critical Path Terms for the PMP Exam\n\nSome of the critical path terms which can be important for the PMP exam, which includes the question of what CPM is, are as follows:Â\n\nCritical Path Method: It is a sequential managing projects approach for process development that distinguishes between essential and minor duties, thereby avoiding delays and workflow constraints.\n\nCritical Path DRAG: An essential action's total time adds to the project's overall duration. Alternatively, cutting the length of one essential activity to a minimum would shorten the time needed to complete the project.\n\nCriticality Index: It is employed in risk analysis, displaying how often a specific activity has been on the critical path throughout the study. High Criticality Index activities are more inclined to be placed on the critical path, which increases the likelihood that they will delay the project.\n\nTotal Float: The amount of time that can be added to an activity's early start date yet to prevent the project as a whole from being pushed back.\n\nFree Float: The duration of a task can be postponed without pushing back the early start time of a succeeding task.\n\nForward Pass: The strategy for figuring out the critical path method's early start or finish times for tasks.\n\nBackward Pass: The strategy to determine when an activity in the critical path method will have a late start or finish.\n\nNetwork Diagram: A diagram that shows the connections between project activities. It is typically created from left to right to symbolize the project's sequence.\n\nNetwork Analysis: Deconstructing a complex project into its various components (tasks, timelines, etc.) and then graphing those parts to show how they relate.\n\nTotal Float vs Free Float\n\nTotal float: This is the amount of time an activity can be postponed from the early start date before the project's completion date or a scheduling restriction is violated. Total float is equal to LS-ES or LF-EF.\n\nFree float: The amount of time a task can be postponed without influencing the one after it. Only when two or more activities share a common successor can there be free float. This is the point where activity converges on a network diagram. ES (next task) - EF = free float (current task)\n\nHow to Use the Critical Path Method\n\nCPM gives you an insight into the status of your project and enables you to keep track of activities and their turnaround times. These are some additional uses for CPM.\n\nCompress Schedules\n\nThere are situations when project deadlines may be advanced, but this could be better. In those circumstances, you can use either fast tracking or crashing as a schedule compression strategy.\n\nFast-tracking: Analyse the critical path to identify tasks that can be completed concurrently. The entire length will be shortened by using parallel processes.\n\nIncreasing resources is a step in the process of \"crashing\" operations. Be sure the additional resources will still fit inside the project's scope before acquiring them, and inform the stakeholders of any modifications.\n\nResolve Resource Shortages\n\nRemember that the availability of resources is not taken into consideration by CPM. Therefore, you can employ resource-leveling tactics to resolve a resource deficit, such as an overbooked team member or a lack of equipment.\n\nTo ensure that a project can be finished with the currently available resources, these strategies work to alleviate resource over-allocation problems.\n\nYou should modify the critical route or use this strategy for activities that have floated since resource-leveling works by changing the start and end dates of the project.\n\nCompile Data for Future Use\n\nSince you're working with informed estimations for activity durations, the schedule generated by CPM is liable to alter. Therefore, as the project progresses, you can contrast the original critical path with the current one.\n\nFuture studies can use this information to predict work durations more precisely.\n\nChoose the Right Program\n\nAre you looking to take your project management skills to the next level?

This is the fundamental distinction between PERT and CPM.\n\nCritical Path Method vs Gantt Chart\n\nHorizontal bar charts, called Gantt charts, lay out project activities that may be monitored within a predetermined timeframe. The dependencies between tasks are displayed using both CPM and Gantt charts.\n\nHere are some distinctions between the two tools:\n\nCPM\n\nProject duration is calculated, and critical and non-critical pathways are visualised.\n\nShown as a network diagram with connected boxes.\n\nDoes not indicate the resources needed\n\nPlots activity without a time frame on a network diagram\n\nGantt Diagram\n\nVisualises the development of project activity\n\nPresented as a horizontal bar graph.\n\nDemonstrates the resources needed for each action\n\nCreates a timetable of activities\n\nGantt charts and CPM can be used in conjunction to monitor critical pathways over time and keep your project on schedule.\n\nLearn from experts who help you pass the examination post enrolling in Simplilearn's PMP training course.

What is the critical path method example?\n\nAny project that requires a flow of certain steps to finish can use the critical path method, such as building a house; each task would need some time and resources to complete and step into the next activity.Â\n\n2. What is the difference between CPM and PERT?\n\nThe differences between CPM and PERT are as follows:\n\nPERT is a probability model, whereas CPM is a deterministic model.\n\nPERT is used to manage uncertain project tasks, and CPM is used to manage certain project tasks.\n\nPERT is a non-repetitive job, whereas CPM is a repetitive job.\n\n3. Where is PERT used?\n\nPERT calculates a realistic amount of time any project will take to complete.Â\n\n4. Why is critical path important?\n\nIt is crucial because it determines all the activities required to finish the project. It also indicates the tasks that are needed on time and can be delayed.\n\n5. What is slack or float?\n\nIt is the amount of time for which any task can be delayed that would not lead to any delay to other activities or the projected completion time of the project."
