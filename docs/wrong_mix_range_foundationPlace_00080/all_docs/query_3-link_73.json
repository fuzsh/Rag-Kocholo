        "text": "Administration and Management\n\nSocial work administrators are proactive leaders in public and private agencies that provide services to clients. Many elements of this area of social work practice are common to administration in other organizations. However, administration and management also require knowledge about social policy and the delivery of social services, vision for future planning, an understanding of human behavior, and commitment to social work ethics and values.\n\nDownload Administration and Management Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nAdvocacy & Community Organizing\n\nAdvocacy is one of the keystones of social work practice. Social work advocates champion the rights of individuals and communities with the goal of achieving social justice. Community organizing and advocacy work with the power of numbers—many people thinking, working, and acting together—to counterbalance wealthy and powerful groups and the means they have to protect and extend themselves.\n\nHistorically, community organizing and social work were responses to the many forces that created inequality in our society. They remain as necessary and effective as ever today.\n\nDownload Advocacy and Community Organization infographic (JPG format)\n\nAging\n\nSocial workers link older adults with services that help them live independently and with dignity, thereby maximizing their quality of life and participation in society. Social work with older adults focuses on the physical, psychological, social, and economic aspects of daily living.\n\nDownload Aging Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nChild Welfare\n\nChild welfare social workers serve some of the most vulnerable children, youths, and families. Social workers specialize in building on the strengths of families and helping them to provide a safe and nurturing environment for children and youths.\n\nHowever, when families are unable to do this, social workers must intervene to protect the children from harm. Child welfare social workers ensure that children and youths who have experienced abuse or neglect are supported through a range of services.\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities\n\nSocial workers also help parents of children with developmental disabilities understand their legal rights. They help parents learn to be advocates and find special services that enable their children to be as independent as possible.\n\nDownload Developmental Disabilities Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nHealth Care\n\nSince the early 1900s, professionally trained social workers have helped people deal with personal and social factors that affect health and wellness. Some health care social workers are in direct services and concentrate on individuals, families, and small groups.\n\nOthers work in settings where the focus is on planning, administration, and policy. In the health care setting, social workers may conduct research, develop programs, and administer social work and other departments.\n\nDownload Health Care Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nInternational Social Work\n\nThe functions of social work in international development are diverse. They include direct services in communities, refugee camps, orphanages, hospitals, and schools, as well as supporting the efforts of national governments, intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations to enhance social well-being.\n\nDownload International Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nMeet Athena Viscusi, LCSW, of Doctors Without Borders\n\nJustice and Corrections\n\nSocial workers who work in justice and corrections can be found in courts, rape crisis centers, police departments, and correctional facilities.\n\nDownload Justice and Corrections infographic (JPG format)\n\nMental Health and Clinical Social Work\n\nClinical social workers are one of the nation’s largest groups of providers of mental health services. They provide mental health services in both urban and rural settings, where they may be the only licensed provider of mental health services available.\n\nDownload Mental Health and Clinical Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nMental Health and Substance Use Social Work\n\nSocial workers help individuals, families, and communities find ways to recover from substance use. They provide a much-needed ecological perspective to treatment that focuses on the client in relation to family and neighborhood environments, community support systems, cultural attitudes, and policies.\n\nConsequently, social workers trained in treating alcohol, tobacco, and other drug addictions can be found doing case management, group and individual therapy, family counseling, advocacy for jobs and housing needs, community resource development, education, and policy making.\n\nDownload Mental Health and Substance Use Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nOccupational and Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Social Work\n\nOccupational social workers help organizations re-engineer their structure and methods to improve efficiency, creativity, productivity, and morale. They may also work for a union and be involved in job counseling or organizing.\n\nDownload Occupational & Employment Assistance (EAP) Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nPolicy and Planning\n\nSocial workers analyze policies, programs, and regulations to see what is most effective. They identify social problems, study needs and related issues, conduct research, propose legislation, and suggest alternative approaches or new programs. They may foster coalitions of groups with similar interests and develop organizational networks.\n\nDownload Policy and Planning Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nPolitics\n\nThere is a natural progression in the careers of many social workers from activism to leadership. Increasingly social workers are holding elective offices from school boards to city and county governments, from state legislatures all the way to the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Social workers also play leadership roles in local, state and federal agencies.\n\nDownload Politics Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nPublic Welfare\n\nSocial work in public welfare entails planning, administering, and financing programs, training and supervising staff, and setting and evaluating standards and criteria for service delivery. Public welfare offers many challenges that require creative thinking and leadership from professional social workers.\n\nDownload Public Welfare Social Work infographic (JPG format)\n\nResearch\n\nSocial workers in research typically tend to be academics with postgraduate degrees in social work. Research provides the framework for effective practice. Although considered an art by some, social work is also a science based on evidence.\n\nDownload Social Work Research infographic (JPG format)\n\nSchool Social Work\n\nSchool social workers act as the connection for school, home, and community services to help children with emotional, developmental, and educational needs. Most school social workers practice in public and private schools, although a small percentage may work in social services agencies or other service sites such as a preschool program or residential treatment center for children who are emotionally disturbed."
