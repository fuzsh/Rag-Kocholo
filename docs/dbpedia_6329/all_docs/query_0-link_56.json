        "text": "Director: Giacomo Gentilomo\n\nFirst released: 1964\n\nContains spoilers\n\nAhh… Italian sword and sandal movies. We have had them here before, in the form of Hercules in the Haunted World. Of course, the big difference between this and that was that Haunted World involved the talents of Mario Bava.\n\nThis, unfortunately, did not. When it comes to vampiric aspects we are primarily concerned with Selene (Delia D’Alberti), Queen of the Moon Men. She has definitive vampiric overtones, as we will later see, and whilst she is barely in the film as a character, the entire point of the plot is her resurrection.\n\nThe film explains, at the beginning, how a fiery rock fell from the sky and hit a mountain, carrying with it a monstrous life form that the people of the fair kingdom of Samar now have to offer sacrifices to, in order that they might survive. Current ruler of Samar is the originally named Queen Samara (Jany Clair) and her advisor Gladius (Nando Tamberlani) suggests that there is one man who can save them.\n\nSamara is dismissive, expressing a belief that it is too risky to court rebellion against their oppressors, but we soon discover that she is a baddy. Her loyal soldier tells her that Gladius is due to meet Hercules (Sergio Ciani) anyway. We see Hercules travelling and he is attacked by thugs (who are actually Samara’s guard). He defeats them with his mighty arms (and a tree he uproots).\n\nSamara is visited by a creature with a masked face – that I’ll describe as a moon priest. He is semi-transparent, so I guess it was a projection, and he tells her she has failed as Hercules is still alive. It becomes clear that she is to sacrifice her sister, the Princess Billis (Delia D’Alberti). Billis – who I swear I spent the film thinking was actually called Phyllis – is in love with her royal cousin Darix (Jean-Pierre Honoré) and they wish to marry.\n\nHercules is met by Agar (Anna Maria Polani), daughter of Gladius, who takes him to her father. Hercules, of course, agrees to help against the moon men. Gladius is showing him to the rebels, by secret passage, when Agar realises that Samara has spied on them. She goes to warn the men but it is too late, traps are triggered and her father is spiked, and as for Hercules…\n\nWell, he kind of falls down a pit but who knows where it was as it took Agar forever and a day to find him. The pit fills with water and so, rather than floating upwards, Hercules breaks down the wall of the pit and then bends metal bars to escape. Unfortunately there is a monster there so he kills it too. Agar finds him and gets him away.\n\nThere is a backwards and forwards then with Hercules captured eventually. Once captured Samara has him executed in the most convoluted way – he is in a spiked piece of apparatus that he can push back on as slaves try to close it! As it is, the equipment breaks due to the power of his manly arms and, at that point, Samara decides she wants him. For his part, Hercules decides to fake love and then avoids drinking the love potion she gives him. Once she spills the location of the (by that time) kidnapped Billis he escapes and goes off to the rescue.\n\nSo, why Billis? It turns out that she is a dead ringer for Selene who is dead but preserved. Her blood, on a certain night when the planets are aligned and the moon can be brought crashing into earth, will restore Selene’s power, resurrecting her. So we do have a blood aspect to all this – indeed, the moon priest cuts Billis wrist and lets it drain down onto the Queen. There is also a pulsing rock seen in this scene, who knows what that was for (potentially pulling down the moon).\n\nBizarrely, as well as bringing the Moon Queen back to life, Billis’ blood also seems to cause flowers to grow around the Queen’s head. Luckily for Billis, Hercules rescues her (not really a spoiler, it was obvious he would) and the main reason for mentioning this is the interruption in the process causes the Queen to rapidly age and die – so we had life through blood and rapid aging on death. It is also said to Samara that she would be made like the moon people, in order that she is able to survive once the moon crashes into the earth; whether they meant she would be like the Queen or the minions is moot as the transformation doesn’t happen.\n\nNow the rapid aging is a rather good effect, surprising given the other effects – especially the moon men which were big rock things. The acting was, well it is difficult to say (though it seemed cheesy) smothered as it was by the blooming awful dubbing. The version I saw was completely washed out colour wise and all in all it wasn’t a great film. There is a bit when Hercules is going to rescue Billis when all I could think was “get on with it”, bored as I was by the endless wandering through wind-machine buffeted fake fog. 1 out of 10.\n\nThe imdb page is here.\n\nFirst released: 2006\n\nContains spoilers\n\nSometimes a film manages to rise above its limitations and there are many ways in which this can happen. Certainly for a low budget film, which Two Front Teeth definitely is, it is concept and story that can carry it above said limitations.\n\nWhen it comes to concept there is none more unique than two front teeth. Indeed it is the only vampiric Christmas film, where Santa, or Clausferatu (Josh Buchbinder), is a vampire, that I can think of off the top of my head. Indeed tying the vampiric traditions into the Christmas mythology is a rarity, though my own The Meaning of Christmas is another example, as is The Munsters’ Scary Little Christmas.\n\nThat’s not to say that the budget constraints do not show in this, the lighting, for instance, is terrible, the sets limited and it looks cheap but sometimes you can touch a special something…\n\nNoelle Snow (Megan Pearson) loves Christmas, to a fetishist level, so it is just a shame that her husband Gabe (Johnny Francis Wolf) is Christmas phobic, to the point of having panic attacks when he sees Santa models. Noelle, consequently, is cheating on him with a mall Santa named Kevin (Eric Messner). They are about to get down and dirty when she hears something, firstly on the roof and then downstairs. She sends Kevin to investigate. Kevin is attacked by an elf. Later the same elf captures Noelle.\n\nLet us, for a moment, talk elves. These are not your atypical Santa’s little helpers. Described as zombie elves they have sharp pointed teeth, foul mouths, heads that continue to mouth off when removed from the body and a perchance for fetish type wear. The primary one is called Frost (Lisa Oberg), though there is a whole army of the pernicious little buggers. Actually the makeup work for them wasn’t too shabby either.\n\nAs for Gabe, he works for a tabloid dedicated to holiday weirdness called the X-Mass Files. We see many of the front pages and he has been investigating a crashed plane, he has a source who has given him info about the crash. He has written a note to Noelle – which also contains divorce papers as he knows she is fooling around. His editor, Ed (Michael Brecher), tries to get details re the source and then gives him a gun for Christmas. Why a gun? All he will say is that he went to Gabe’s house and lost an ear… Now I know what you're thinking, lost an ear… plot improbability at the very least, but we have left reality at the head of the film.\n\nGabe gets home and finds Kevin’s head on a train set and Noelle tied up. He frees her and tries to get Kevin’s car keys (Ed has driven off in Gabe’s car). An elf has the car keys. They manage to get the key, though Gabe is bitten. A group of carollers get in the way as they make their escape and later we see that the elf slaughters them for their trouble. Gabe heads away but when they try to phone the cops they aren’t believed. They are hijacked by Ed who says that *they* want to know who the source is, but he is thrown from the car for his troubles. Gabe heads to his source, a gunslinger wannabe called Pete (Joseph L Johnson). Pete knows what is going on… Santa is evil, a vampire.\n\nClausferatu is a creature who comes out at night, who dresses in red and has no fear of fire – hence coming down chimneys – and injects greed into the Christmas festivities (all very similar to Gabe’s story, ‘Yes Virginia, there is a vampiric Santa’). The flight was brought down by a ‘bird strike’ involving a reindeer escaping from Clausferatu – we get a bizarre little animation at this point. It died and Pete has its head mounted, but the elves are trying to get the red nose for their master. When it flashes it causes them pain.\n\nThe elves are using Gabe and Noelle to find Pete. They have placed a tracking device in the shape of a gingerbread man in Noelle’s foot. Gabe has to remove it. They decide to hide out in a place that Christmas has not touched for many years – Gabe’s old family home. It is here that we discover why Noelle has a Christmas fetish and why Gabe has a Christmas phobia.\n\nWe can also throw into the mix the Silent Knights – a group of nuns who have taken a vow of silence but are also Vatican assassins. It is they who took Ed’s ear and they seek to get the nose as this will be the decisive battle for Christmas and, yes, it is all very, very bizarre.\n\nOver all this should be dross, badly lit and very cheap, but… the dialogue is well done, the constant Christmas gags work well and Noelle and Gabe work as a mismatched couple who actually do love each other – they’ve just got lost in their own little worlds. The story is so bizarre it can only be worth a watch and, if you can stand the low budget, this actually had something going for it.\n\nIt is far from perfect, it has no logic base to work from and yet it is fun, a guilty pleasure would probably be the best descriptor. If you can handle the excesses of low budget aspects then this is worth a watch. 5 out of 10.\n\nThe imdb page is here."
