        "text": "THE MURDER OF SANTA CLAUS\n\nDir. Christian-Jaque, 105 min.\n\nFrance, 1941.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nTUES, DECEMBER 13- 10PM\n\nSAT, DECEMBER 17- MIDNIGHT\n\nWED, DECEMBER 21- 7:30PM\n\nFRI, DECEMBER 23- 10PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nAfter the fall of France to Nazi forces in 1940, it took little time for the German government to end all film production except for a state-run production company. That company was Continental Films, established in October 1940, and its first film, released a year later, was L’Assassinat du père Noël, translated as The Murder Of Santa Claus. Based on the Pierre Very novel, the film is a kind of fairy tale that slowly turns both more magical and darker, a film at stark contrast to the circumstances of its creation, and yet deeply connected in ways which become stranger and more subversive as we reach the solving of the title’s riddle.\n\nAn old watchmaker, playing Santa Claus, is found dead, and on a primary level the film is a detective story led by the rules of the fantastic, as likely to drift into love story or fable as anything. Led by the great Harry Baur (THE GOLEM), who plays the watchmaker with charm to burn, the performances all bring a brio and mystery which ties perfectly with the astonishingly dreamlike setting. Director Christian-Jaque (A LOVER’S RETURN, FANFAN LA TULIPE), in one of his first films, works for the first time with actress Renée Faure, who would become not only his go-to star, but his wife as well. Anyone looking to avoid yuletide treacle should definitely investigate this rarely-seen gem.\n\nHarry Baur, a year later, was arrested by the Gestapo after attempting to defend his wife; he was released in 1943 but died shortly thereafter under “mysterious circumstances”.\n\nFLORENCE, ARIZONA\n\nDir. Andrea B. Scott, 2014\n\nUnited States. 78 minutes.\n\nTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15 – 7:30 PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nFlorence, Arizona is a cowboy town with a prison problem. Founded in 1866, this bastion of the Wild West is home to 8,500 civilians and 17,000 inmates spread over nine prisons. Through an unconventional lens, Andrea B. Scott’s FLORENCE, ARIZONA weaves together the stories of four key residents, whose lives have all been shadowed in some way by the surrounding prison-industrial complex. The result is an intricately crafted cinematic tapestry, threaded through with deep strands of Americana, humor, intimacy, and pathos, revealing as much about ourselves as it does about our modern carceral state.\n\nFestival Screenings / Awards:\n\nDOC NYC\n\nCamden International Film Festival\n\nDOXA\n\nAshland Independent Film Festival\n\nCollinsville Film Festival (Best Documentary)\n\nBig Sky Documentary Film Festival\n\nGreentopia Film Festival\n\nAndrea B. Scott is a Brooklyn based documentary filmmaker and editor enamored with the worlds of Americana and nostalgia. Her debut feature length documentary FLORENCE, ARIZONA premiered at DOC NYC in November 2014. Her latest short film, JUST A DOG, premiered at Hot Docs in 2016 and was published online through The Nation. Andy edited the CNN documentary film, FRESH DRESSED and co-edited the Netflix documentary HOT GIRLS WANTED, both of which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2015. She was an editor and an associate producer on Participant Media’s documentary A PLACE AT THE TABLE, directed by Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2012 and was released nationwide by Magnolia Pictures. Andy recently edited a documentary about a bird hoarder from upstate New York, and is at work on several short films.\n\nQ&A with the director following the screening!\n\nNAKED MASSACRE\n\naka Born For Hell\n\naka Die Hinrichtung\n\nDir. Denis Héroux, 1976\n\nWest Germany/Canada/France/Italy, 86 min.\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11 – MIDNIGHT\n\nSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 26 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nBased on the infamous case of nurse-butcher Richard Speck—also portrayed in Kōji Wakamatsu’s VIOLATED ANGELS (1967), B-movies from 2002, 2007 and 2012, the original US poster for Fernando Di Leo’s SLAUGHTER HOTEL (1971), a Wesley Willis song, self-appointed ‘murder metal’ band Macabre’s 1993 tune “What The Heck Richard Speck?: Eight Nurses You Wrecked,” and, uh, master painter Gerhard Richter’s 1966 work “Eight Student Nurses”—this unusually sadistic international co-production is indeed the only version that grafts his story onto The Troubles in Belfast, Northern Ireland and re-casts Speck as a Vietnam vet, all while depicting a sexual perversity that allegedly outpaces that of the real-life killer.\n\nTHE SATAN KILLER\n\n(aka DEATH PENALTY)\n\nDir. Stephen Calamari, 1993\n\nUSA, 90 min.\n\nSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19 – MIDNIGHT\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 25 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nA boozy addled, revenge-driven cop squares off with a crank fueled, devil-worshipping biker the hardboiled, mind-ruining crime flick THE SATAN KILLER. Filmed entirely on location in Virgina Beach, VA, and directed by the questionably named Stephen Calamari (most likey the film’s star, Steve Sayre) THE SATAN KILLER (aka Death Penalty and Rampage) features a little bit of something for everyone- murder, machine guns, drugs, drag queens, private eyes, beach babes, former male nurses, a frequently-visited t-shirt shop, punks, pimps, a frequently-visited coffee shop, strippers, a haunted house and a scene where the killer screams at a church, “You never fooled me!”\n\nA MORE PERFECT UNION\n\nDir. Steve and Ari Sheinkin, 105 min.\n\nUSA, 1995\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4 – MIDNIGHT\n\nSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nPossibly owing to the success of another film set in Austin, A MORE PERFECT UNION stumbles aboard an East Texas zeitgeist-bus of scrambled ambition and self-importance. Four roommates, being equal parts young, inexperienced, white and male, are fed up with involuntary membership in the bland Clinton-era generation. So they decide to secede and start their own country from the comfort of their ubiquitous 90s oversized couch. Stu, who wears culottes and refuses to leaves the house, provides the bulk of the philosophical leadership. The country eventually rallies around goals of Justice and Revenge, taking them into rebel territory and adolescent vigilante justice. Featuring local Austin tunes from the likes of Sidehackers, Magneto USA, Yah Yah Littleman, Javelin Boot and Prescott Curlywolf.\n\nSEXANDROIDE\n\nDir. Michel Ricaud, 1987\n\nFrance, 51 minutes\n\nSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 5 – MIDNIGHT\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nWelcome to the temple of fear and eroticism, as a monstrous madman slowly mutilates poor young girls! See the sensual act of voodoo preformed on an innocent bar patron! View the lustful bite of a vampire!\n\nOriginally marketed in France as blurring the lines between fiction and reality, this rarely seen, often talked about, shot-on-video classic is finally making its Spectacle debut. A unique and bizarre flick that defies easy classification, Sexandroide is a must for fans of extreme entertainment. Simultaneously sexy and sick, Sexandroide has it all.\n\nBertrand Mandico has outlined his filmmaking aims in his “Incoherence Manifesto”: artifice, irrationality, and the inherent magic of aging film stock and analog effects. But a certain affinity for genre, plot, and character, at least as starting points for distortion and unpredictable development, keeps most of his works oddly engaging. Take his most elaborate to date, Our Lady of the Hormones, in which two aging actresses take a long weekend in the countryside to practice their latest roles, but become side-tracked when they fall into a violent love triangle with a purring oozing organ discovered in the woods. Here the familiar, the imagined, and the wildly hallucinatory merge into a cinema resolutely true to its own logic alone.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3- 10:00PM\n\nTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 8- 7:30PM\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18- 7:30PM\n\nTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29- 10:00PM\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nDEPRESSIVE COP\n\n2015, Scotland / France, 13 min.\n\nA noir: on a remote Scottish island, a mask-visaged police officer helps a mother seek a vanished teen daughter. But both mother and daughter — or conceivably even all three principles — are played by Löwensohn, pointing the film into an absurdist maelstrom of eyes, sex, and confused identities. Genre conventions, here, provide just enough of a spine for film to mutate at will.\n\nOUR LADY OF THE HORMONES\n\nAKA Notre-Dame des Hormones\n\n2015, France, 31 min.\n\nTwo aging actresses take a long weekend in the countryside to practice their latest roles, but become side-tracked when they discover a purring oozing organ alone in the woods. This organism quickly becomes the object of their games and fascinations, and an inevitable love triangle develops. But among actresses, can even the grand guignol confrontation that awaits be taken at face value? Narrated by Michel Piccoli, whose words of explanation just add another layer to the increasing disorientation, and shot in dazzling color photography whereby every bit of artificial nature, human furniture, and deer-with-breasts explodes hallucinatorily onto the screen.\n\nPREHISTORIC CABARET\n\n2014, Iceland / France, 10 min\n\nSomewhere in Iceland a surrealist, colonoscopic nightclub act offers a biological portal into the past.\n\nSALAMMBÔ\n\n2014, France, 8 min\n\nAgainst a stark and empty landscape a young women taunts one much older, through gorgeously overlaid 16mm film. Could these apparitions be those of memory, of her own past, or of something more arcane?\n\nThis March, Spectacle presents a diptych of blistering econo-graphic deep dives by celebrated documentarian Stephanie Black. H-2 WORKER profiles migrant laborers flown from Jamaica to Florida to cut sugarcane, at the behest of big-box food manufacturers taking advantage of the extranational economy. LIFE AND DEBT, the more famous of the two, returns to Jamaica to methodically dissect Clinton-era loan policies and import/export subsidies, while pitting the island nation’s jawdropping poverty against its tourist-friendly image. Black – whose career originated in environmental activism – has clearly cultivated a unique relationship to the island nation, and yet these are anything but grass-is-greener reaffirmations of exotic stereotypes. Instead, her films show us the Caribbean we know, deep down, we’ve been seeing all along: a mirage of paradise operated by an elite few, kept for the foreign dollars of a few more.\n\nDVDs of both H-2 Worker and Life and Debt will be available for purchase at Spectacle during this series.\n\n[gfycat id=”SlightBrightEft”]\n\nH-2 WORKER\n\ndir. Stephanie Black, 1990\n\nUSA/Jamaica. 70 mins.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9 – 10:00 PM\n\nTUESDAY, MARCH 15 – 7:30 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24 – 7:30 PM – ONE NIGHT ONLY ON 16MM FILM – Q&A with filmmaker Stephanie Black\n\nSUNDAY, MARCH 27 – 5:00 PM\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE\n\nGRAND JURY PRIZE WINNER – 1990 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL\n\nShot guerilla-style over the course of two years, H-2 WORKER is an unmissable document of pre-NAFTA neoliberalism, made at a time when over ten thousand Jamaican men per year were coming to toil in the sugarcane fields of Florida. (The filmmaker herself appears with her back to the camera, when the crew is not-so-subtly advised to cease shooting at one of the company stores where laborers can buy snacks, toothpaste, etc.) Aided by legendary cinematographer Mayrse Alberti (Creed, Crumb), H-2 WORKER captures a microcosm of indentured servitude: dimly lit dormitories, dusk-to-dawn shifts, brutal deductions in pay from both the sugar company side (and upon remittance to Jamaica.)\n\nWhile the beyond-cheap labor is defended by sundry American executives as a lucky break for Jamaica’s depressed economy – the opposite of a “handout” – cane harvesters inevitably begin organizing for the purposes of work stoppage. With heartbreaking snatches from letters written by the workers to their families back home, Black’s debut exposé wears its advocating spirit on its sleeve, brazenly appealing for a change in the status quo in classic advocacy-doc style. The H-2 program was ultimately disbanded after a fifty-million-dollar class-action lawsuit, but the film’s contemporary pertinence speaks for itself: the wages offered these men are paltry to the point of destitution, but they’re working a job with no real claimants on the U.S. side. Sound familiar?\n\n“H-2 WORKER does not pretend to offer any answers, but it solidly frames issues about the economy, employment and the treatment of workers who seem just steps away from slavery.” – Caryn James, The New York Times\n\n[gfycat id=”SameElaborateCoelacanth”]\n\nLIFE AND DEBT\n\ndir. Stephanie Black, 2001\n\nUSA/Jamaica. 80 mins.\n\nMONDAY, MARCH 7 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY MARCH 15 – 10:00 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24 – 10:00 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 30 – 10:00 PM\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE\n\n“Every native of every place is a potential tourist, and every tourist is a native of somewhere. Every native would like to find a way out. Every native would like a rest. Every native would like a tour. But some natives – most natives in the world – cannot go anywhere. They’re too poor to escape the realities of their lives, and they’re too poor to live properly in the place where they live – which is the very place that you, the tourist, want to go.”\n\nNarrated by Jamaica Kincaid (reworking the second-person narration of her 1988 classic A Small Place), Black’s breakout 2001 documentary interrogates the power structures imposed by the Bretton Woods organizations on so-called “developing” economies, and the psychological chasm that separates a nation’s exported reputation from reality on the ground. LIFE AND DEBT investigates International Monetary Fund levers in agonizing detail: “structural adjustments” designed to keep Jamaica’s post-colonial government in permanent debt, brutal export subsidies on agriculture, and loopholes for American fashion companies – many of whom are directly namechecked in the film, via first-hand testimonies from textile workers, paid an infinitesimal wage by American standards.\n\nNot unlike the reggae-intensive soundtrack (featuring tracks by Peter Tosh, Buju Banton, Sizzla and the Marleys), the film finds melancholy drenched in beauty. While it’s a tired trope to call a film’s cinematography “sumptuous”, Black and her team of cinematographers (including Malik Sayeed) use their 35mm palette to sharply play Jamaica’s endemic lushness against itself, interrogating tropical tourist desire as its own system of imaging and control. Arguably the most rigorous dissection of postcolonial economic policy ever committed to film, LIFE AND DEBT is a penetrating critique of what the “New World Order” actually means for millions, and a sober-eyed ode to a culture in embattled flux.\n\n“In Stephanie Black’s devastating, artful, and intelligent documentary, Jamaican farmers tell of the downward spiral of one livelihood after another: Cheap American-imported powdered milk usurps the local dairy supply, Chiquita squashes Jamaican banana farmers, Idaho potatoes nudge out regionally grown crops.” – Lenora Todaro, The Village Voice\n\n“After the structural adjustments, the cuts in public expenditure, the removal of tariffs on imports, the privatisations and devaluations, Jamaica is still plagued by financial crisis. Development plans have been abandoned as the vision of independence recedes. LIFE AND DEBT is a very powerful weapon in the arsenal of the global movement for a more equitable economic order.” – Linton Kwesi Johnson, The Guardian\n\nONE NIGHT ONLY – WITH LIVE PERFORMANCE\n\nSATURDAY, MARCH 12 – 7:30 and 10:00PM\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE\n\n“I’m a female Charlie Chaplin, I could have made slapstick comedy. I’m thinking more and more about acting again, in my films. My body in a movie is very important, it says something by itself, it has the weight of the Real. I can’t have actresses playing my clumsiness.” – Chantal Akerman\n\nF is for Frame features a series of short video works by artists who use the camera to reframe, unframe, and construct feminists performances and identities. The artists use their bodies in a number of ways, ranging from minimal cameos and the use of childhood home video footage to staged performances created for the camera. Dialoguing with the history of feminist artists who positioned their bodies as sites for production and political intervention, the range of selected videos create a constellation of contemporary feminist strategies produced by and for the camera.\n\ncurated by bottom.\n\nbottom is Millie Kapp & Georgia Wall’s curatorial project.

II\n\nSpecial thanks to João Pedro Rodrigues, Joaquim Sapinho, and Rosa Films.\n\nTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9 – 8:00 PM\n\nPURCHASE TICKETS HERE\n\nCurated by Gabriel Abrantes, Alexander Carver, Benjamin Crotty and Daniel Schmidt, LIFESTYLE PORN, PART II is a rejoinder to a program of short queer films screened at Light Industry (LIFESTYLE PORN, PART I) from the last 60 years, marking a shift in the cinematic stylizations of homoeroticism from the guise of criminal marginality to bourgeois “lifestyle” fetishism.\n\nThe Spectacle program features LE MURA DI SANA, a short film made in Yemen by Pier Paolo Pasolini as an appeal to UNESCO, against what he perceived to be the corrupting forces of global economic development. Pasolini’s films and activism alike championed a certain romanticization of poverty and the “pre-modern” lifestyle as vitalist and sexually liberated, as a viable alternative to the repressive architecture of the burgeoning global-capitalist world of rampant consumerism and mono-culture. Whereas modern subcultural lifestyles have often exploited and have been exploited by cinematic form to various political ends, Pasolini sought to politicize the entirety of the developing world in service of his cinematic, aesthetic and personal anti-modernist politics.\n\nThe feature presentation is O FANTASMA, by contemporary Portuguese filmmaker João Pedro Rodrigues: a meditation on the alienated sexual encounters of a Lisbon garbage collector whose obsessions are the film’s sole subject. Here the refuse of the fully modernized city becomes the debased medium through which the protagonist’s burgeoning sexual fetishisms arise. Rodrigues’ ‘Fantasma’ can be seen as the ghost of Pasolini’s eccentric idealisms.\n\nStructured as a “before and after” of ‘Late Capitalism’, the program will begin with a radical Marxist’s direct political appeal to curb capitalistic destruction of the “good life”, and thus to preserve and valorize the perceived innocence of pre-modern sexual freedoms and political naiveté. The “after” of these fantasies are imaged in O FANTASMA as the vast landfill of Lisbon – a monument to the rotting detritus of consumer culture that has displaced Pasolini’s unalienated innocence.\n\nFriends with Benefits, a retrospective of works by Abrantes, Carver, Crotty, and Schmidt, will run at the Film Society of Lincoln Center from February 5-11. LIFESTYLE PORN, PART I plays Light Industry on Tuesday, February 2nd."
