        "text": "The past five years had seen numerous innovations in horror, and none of them arose from the major Hollywood studios that had ruled the genre since the early thirties. Alfred Hitchcock made Psycho at Universal Studios but produced it under his own Shamley Productions, which was responsible for his popular macabre TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents (Paramount distributed the film). One certainly could not mistake Hitchcock’s follow up to the ultra-glossy North by Northwest for a big Universal or Paramount production. Inspired by the low- budget intimacy and gimmickry of William Castle’s recent schlocker shockers, Hitchcock used his TV crew to shoot Psycho in simple black and white with a small cast and small sets and on a miniscule budget. He even employed a Castle-esque shuck to promote the picture (“No one... but no one will be admitted to the theater after the start of each performance...”).\n\nHitchcock may have scaled way back on the frills and felt it necessary to use a bit of corny hucksterism to sell tickets, but he’d never made a picture more suspenseful, disturbing, or brilliantly plotted than Psycho. Of course, Joseph Stefano deserves a lot more credit for the picture’s greatness than he usually receives. The screenwriter exaggerated the pacing of Robert Bloch’s novel to build the film’s ingenious structure: get the viewers so involved in the story conflicted thief Marion Crane (Janet Leigh, the film’s one big star) for the first half hour that they forget they are even watching a movie called Psycho, then carve up their expectations with cinema’s most famous shower scene, a scene that would have been impossible to slip into a Hollywood film before censorship martinet Joseph Breen retired from his role as administrator of the Hays Code in 1954.\n\nThere was no way its sequel would fully recapture the power of Hammer’s Dracula because Christopher Lee refused to revisit the Count for fear of being typecast (his stance would crumble soon enough). Still there’s a lot of what made Dracula great in The Brides of Dracula. Not suffering any of his costar’s reservations, Peter Cushing happily returns as Van Helsing, and he gets more opportunities to display undeath-defying heroism than in the previous film. His showdown with a dashing non-Dracula vampire is likely Terence Fisher’s most thrilling sequence, climaxing with Cushing getting chomped and taking some rather extreme measures to vaccinate himself against vampirism. Martita Hunt is nearly as arresting in the role of the eccentric Baroness Meinster, while Fisher’s trademark mastery of color and artificial environments provides further distraction from Lee’s absence. The screenwriting team, led by Hammer Stalwart Jimmy Sangster, also came up with an intriguing mystery (why is the Baroness Meinster keeping a young man prisoner in her sprawling castle?) that arguably makes the film more engaging than Hammer’s previous horrors to those already well familiar with how Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Mummy pan out. As is the case with most Hammer pictures, the main allure of The Brides of Dracula is that it provides yet another opportunity to gawk at marvelous sets and costumes rendered in glorious Technicolor and gloriously Gothic images of vampire brides rising from the grave.\n\nThe first half of the film follows Shirô Shimizu (Shigeru Amachi), a theology student with the worst luck in the world, beginning with his involvement in a tragic hit-and-run accident. The supernatural element of this opening movement is limited to a general air of uncanny unease and an encounter with a doppelgänger. In the second half, Shirô has his own fatal encounter, after which he is demoted to Hell where he is set loose in an environment straight out of the right-hand panel of The Garden of Earthly Delights. There’s a field of needles, brutish blue demons bearing truncheons, surreal decapitations, and a screeching baby floating on a river of blood. Ferocious as all of this is, Nakagawa realizes his nightmare images with great artistry. The film’s jarring movement from relative normalcy to surreal horror heightens its power to unnerve and presages the work of a filmmaker born less than a month after its release: Takashi Miike, who would grow up to make the similarly plotted and even more disturbing Audition twenty nine years later.\n\nHouse of Usher was a bit slow because of Richard Matheson and Roger Corman’s refusal to stray too far from the source text. They allow themselves a lot more roaming range with their take on The Pit and the Pendulum, and the results are a stark improvement. Matheson fleshes out one of Poe’s most teasingly slim mood pieces so fully that his script doesn’t get around to the story ’s title apparatus until the final reel (I always thought that pendulum blade was too damn small anyway).\n\nAs Nicholas Medina, Vincent Price plays another troubled shut in not too different from his Roderick Usher. He’s the center of much more action this time as Matheson tosses chunks of standard haunted house stories and revenge plots into his Poe-pourri (sorry). This time, Price is not the only one worth watching as Barbara Steele is at her witchy best as Price’s not-quite-dead-yet wife Elizabeth and Luana Anders grounds the whole thing as his sister Catherine. She also features in what may be the project’s most unforgettable sequence: a genuinely disturbing prologue Corman created in 1968 so his movie would be long enough to fit into a two-hour TV time slot.\n\nIn 1945, Britain’s Ealing Studios essentially invented the horror portmanteau with Dead of Night, but the sub-genre then remained dormant for nearly two decades despite its tremendous potential. In 1963, the portmanteau received new life when Mario Bava made his first pure horror film sinceThe Mask of Satan three years earlier. Although the sub-genre would find its truest home in the U.K. two years later when Amicus established itself as the house of portmanteau horror, the Italian production I tre volti della paura (The Three Faces of Fear) is the first such film to truly master the formula. Bava wastes no time with the too-brief or too-comedic episodes that watered down Dead of Night and Roger Corman’s The Black Cat of 1962. He taps into the simplicity of the short-and-scary story with three of them, and each is highly effective in its own way.\n\nThe first, “The Telephone”, has often been labeled a proto-Giallo in the vein of Bava’s The Girl Who Knew Too Much from earlier in ’63 since it eschews the supernatural, but its simple theme of a woman receiving increasingly threatening phone calls from an unidentified stranger would become a stock horror trope from Black Christmas through Scream, though its surprise twist is thoroughly unique.\n\n“The Wurdalak” is more typical horror fare with Boris Karloff playing a vampire in everything but name. It still gets the job done with its sinister atmosphere and what may be Karloff’s most legitimately scary performance.\n\nHowever, the scariest story is saved for last. “The Drop of Water” is an almost too-simple tale of greed begetting vengeance from beyond the grave as a nurse decides to swipe the gaudy ring of a recently deceased medium. Bava builds tension with the title dripping faucet and delivers the heart-stopping goods when the dead woman springs to life to terrorize the thief with her horrible, horrible rictus. The grinning corpse looks like the rubber dummy it is, yet that face is so awful and the suspense that precedes its appearance is so intense that all phoniness is forgiven.\n\nDespite the truly atrocious dubbing of its English-speaking actors (replacing Karloff’s iconic lisp is criminal), the original Italian edit of The Three Faces of Fear is arguably preferable to the bowdlerized version released as Black Sabbathin the U.S. in 1965, which scrubs themes of homosexuality and prostitution from “The Telephone” and some of the violence from “The Wurdalak”. But I guess without that version, Ozzy and the guys might still be called Earth.\n\nFrankenstein Created Woman is the best of Hammer’s Frankenstein sequels. What could have just been an update of Bride of Frankenstein in the same way Curse of Frankenstein dragged James Whale’s Frankenstein into the fifties is a totally individual film. Hans (Robert Morris), a young assistant of Dr. Frankenstein (Cushing—who else?), is beheaded for a crime he didn’t commit. The good doctor resurrects Hans by transferring his soul into the body of his girlfriend, Christina (Susan Denberg), who’d drowned herself after witnessing Hans’s execution. A severely scarred brunette in life, Christina somehow springs back to life as a blonde with pristine skin—as well as Hans’s yen for revenge against the trio of snotty rich kids who committed the crime for which he was executed.\n\nFrankenstein Created Woman is unique in the Hammer canon for the sympathy with which it treats its monsters—and this time, Dr. Frankenstein is a genuine monster, having been brought back to life just as Hans/Christina is. Yet he is also at his least villainous. Screenwriter Anthony Hinds also crafts a more complex main monster than the usual purely evil Hammer creature as Hans/Christina is so justified in their revenge and the objects of their revenge are so thoroughly loathsome.\n\nThe monster is also intriguing because of its multiple personalities and genders, though the film does not really explore the ramifications of that very deeply. Ultimately, the woman Frankenstein creates is a female body piloted by a man’s consciousness, so we can’t exactly praise the film for boasting more female agency than the usual Hammer cleavage-fest. Frankenstein Created Woman may be complex for a Hammer movie, but it’s still a Hammer movie.\n\nSo far horror has remained an almost fundamentally fantastical genre. Even when it came closest to touching talons with reality, it either embellished its non- fictional storytelling with phantasmagoric imagery (Häxan) or presented realistic horrors with such heightened style (Psycho) that the effect was as otherworldly as that of a werewolf picture. By 1968, reality and unimaginable horrors commingled so freely that what was most real became most terrifying. It had been just five years since the one-two-three punch of the assassination of Medgar Evers, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, and the assassination of JFK. As the sixties continued slouching toward Bethlehem, nightly news reports brought such nightmares as the assassinations of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., and Bobby Kennedy, as well as the ongoing atrocities of the Vietnam War, into American homes.\n\nAlways reluctant to take a hard look at its place in the world, America was not where real-life horror first invaded cinemas. Rather it was Tigon British Film and English director Michael Reeves who accomplished this with Witchfinder General. Vincent Price is the title character, the actual historical monster Matthew Hopkins who marauded through Cromwell-era England accusing women and men of witchcraft and instigating the executions of 300 innocent people by some accounts. The picture mainly focuses on two fictionalized victims (Ian Ogilvy and Hilary Dwyer, both excellent) who actually survive Hopkins’s work but are left completely shattered by it. Even though there is some attempt to give audiences satisfaction with the historically inaccurate death of Hopkins at the film’s climax, the film’s lingering taste is bitter, cynical, and devastating. In essence, Witchfinder General rang truer than any scary movie before it.\n\nBeyond its reality, Witchfinder General is also daring for its depiction of abuses made in the name of god and for sympathizing with sexually active young people. The filmmakers were less self-consciously daring when casting the title role, and Reeves severely objected to the scenery-chewing star of the House on Haunted Hill playing the villain of such a serious film. Yet Price proves that he can dial back his persona to portray a quieter, more insidious kind of evil than he usually did."
