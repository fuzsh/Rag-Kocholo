        "text": "[Editorial] 10 Horror Witches Who Need More Love\n\nAlongside vampires, ghosts and monsters, the witch is an iconic symbol of horror, showing up in pretty much every culture since the inception of storytelling, and instantly recognizable in various forms and figures. Almost exclusively presented as outcast women, the archetype of the witch has long been a place of comfort and relatability for the most misunderstood and marginalized of our community. It’s no wonder that the image and iconography of the witch is such an integral feature of horror.\n\nAlthough there is such a huge variety throughout horror history, it seems we witness the same witches popping up over and over in lists and think-pieces (Thomasin, Nancy, Elaine etc) While those witches are iconic and deserving of all their praise, let’s take the time to celebrate some witches who often fly their broomsticks under the radar.\n\n1. HOLDA (Gretel and Hansel, 2020)\n\nWhy Oz Perkins’ Gretel and Hansel, with its distinctly A24 folk horror feel, isn’t more beloved is a mystery. Rich in stunning visuals and cinematography, this moody slowburn presents an eerie retelling of the classic fairytale, thanks in huge part to Alice Krige’s performance as Holda. With her soft-spoken voice and uncanny, deliberate movements, Holda lures the audience in just as much as the eponymous children, making it impossible not to fall under her spell.\n\n2. THE BLAIR WITCH (The Blair Witch Project, 2000)\n\nNever seen on screen yet responsible for changing the entire face of horror, the Blair Witch is a mysterious entity and subject of an urban legend that our fated filmmakers find themselves entangled and entrapped in. Various sequels, books and video games flesh the Blair Witch’s story out further, but for the first and arguably most iconic film, nothing is seen or known of her - yet her name changed horror cinema forever. Now that’s power.\n\n3. MINNIE AND ROMAN CASTEVET (Rosemary’s Baby, 1968)\n\nRoman Polanski’s 1968 masterpiece Rosemary’s Baby is widely considered to be one of the greatest psychological horror films of all time, thanks in no small part to its two main antagonists - nosy neighbors and devil worshiping witches Minnie and Roman Castevet. With their constant barging in and disregard for privacy, Minnie and Roman manage to be frightening even before we know about their status as devil worshippers. After all, what’s more terrifying than an unwanted guest who doesn’t respect social cues?\n\n4. MARIE LAVEAU (American Horror Story, 2013/2018)\n\nDid you know that the Voodoo Queen of New Orleans depicted in Ryan Murphy’s show is actually based on a real person? Born a free woman of colour in the 1800s, Laveau was a Voodoo healer, herbalist, teacher and occultist. Angela Bassett’s portrayal of Madam Laveau is one of the most revered in all of the AHS franchise: a bloodthirsty and beautiful powerhouse practitioner of ancient African diasporic witchcraft who manages to stand her own against the (equally iconic) Fiona Goode.\n\n5. MADAME BLANC (Suspiria, 2018)\n\nDario Argento’s Three Mothers trilogy explores three gruesome stories of witches, the most famous perhaps being 1977’s Suspiria. But it’s Tilda Swinton in the 2018 remake who cuts an imposing, ethereal figure as Madame Blanc, the primary dance instructor at the coven-owned academy. Swinton gives a triumvirate of stunning performances in Suspiria ’18 as the Madame Blanc, the Mother of Sighs AND Dr Klemperer, but it’s her tender yet terrifying version of Madame Blanc that is one of the standouts of Luca Guadigno’s remake.\n\nHAVE YOU LISTENED TO OUR PODCAST YET?\n\n6. PANNOCHKA (Viy 1967)\n\nUkrainian writer Nikolai Gogol’s 1835 folktale Viy received a faithful adaptation in 1967 by Konstantin Yershov and Georgi Kropachyov, becoming the first Soviet horror film and still remaining a beloved cult classic by genre fans. After her hag form is beaten bloody in an act of self-defence by student Khoma, the witch Pannochka transforms into a beautiful young girl, hellbent on tormenting Khoma by summoning all manner of goblins and ghouls – plus the eponymous gnome chief from which the film takes its name. Viy is outrageously entertaining, and Natalya Varley’s enjoyment of her role as the wide-eyed witch is palpable, whether she’s crying blood or coffin surfing.\n\n7. AUNTIE (Hausu, 1977)\n\nAlthough Auntie is never explicitly referred to as a witch in Nobuhiko Obayashi’s technicolor girls trip, the iconic Auntie checks all the boxes of a powerful magical woman. She lives alone in the hills, in a killer magic house full of murderously kitsch inanimate objects, feeds off the souls of unmarried women (read: virgins) and has her own loyal familiar in the form of fluffy cat Shiro. Truly a life that so many of us women can aspire to.\n\n8. JESUS VELASQUEZ (True Blood Season 3 - 5)\n\nWhile we stereotypically consider ‘witchcraft’ to be a woman’s practice, brujeria – a form of witchcraft found in Latin American and Afro-Caribbean cultures – proves that magick, like any good occult practice, should bend and break the rules of gender conformity. Nurse by day, brujo by night, Jesús was dedicated to caring for his patients, his love for Lafayette and the practice that tied him to his Mexican roots. Poor Jesús had a rough old ride mingling with the witches and vampires of Bon Temps, but at least he got out before the show really went off the rails (although some might argue it was never ON them)\n\n9. LEÁK QUEEN (Mystics in Bali, 1981)\n\nIn a shining example of true ‘fuck around and find out’ energy, Mystics in Bali follows Kathy, an American tourist who wants to dabble in Indonesian black magic. Happy to grant her request is the long-taloned Leák Queen who spends 80% of her screen time cackling and 20% turning people into pigs, snakes and nebulous talking fireballs. Mystics in Bali is not the greatest film ever made, but it is worth watching for its depiction of Balinese folklore and an especially icky creature known as the Penanggalan It’s also available to watch for free on Youtube, albeit with a pretty atrocious English dub.\n\n10. JOAN (Hereditary, 2018)\n\nAs Queen Ellen’s best friend and one of the highest ranking members of the Cult of Paimon, Joan evidently has some pretty hefty dark magic skills under her belt. Along with the rest of the Cult, Joan has been pivotal in putting Peter’s possession in motion long before he was even born. Now, that’s dedication. It takes a lot to stand firmly beside Toni Collette’s earth-shattering performance in Ari Aster’s adored debut, but Ann Dowd as caring, motherly Joan is utterly spell-binding and with a roar that’s just as bone-chilling. On your next Hereditary rewatch, pay close attention to all of Joan’s lies, and especially what’s in the trunk of her car.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nGhouls Gang Shop\n\nEXPLORE\n\nMORE ARTICLES\n\nAmber T / Contributor\n\nTwitter | Instagram"
