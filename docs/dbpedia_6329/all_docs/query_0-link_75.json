        "text": "Just as two different bands have recorded as The Damned, more than one film has went under that name too. In fact, there’s one just out set during America’s Civil War which I have yet to see.\n\nOver the years, I’ve heard different versions of how the English punk band hit upon their moniker. Brian James maintains he already knew what he would call the group before their line-up had been finalised, the inspiration coming via Luchino Visconti’s 1969 film The Damned and also Children of the Damned, the British sci-fi horror from 1964. I’m sure I’ve also heard Captain Sensible claiming their name derived from the Hammer movie shot in 1961 also titled The Damned.\n\nCertainly, Dave (Transl) Vanian was a big Hammer and horror fan generally. In Barry Hutchinson’s unofficial biography The Damned – The Chaos Years, he quotes the singer complaining about how other kids where he lived didn’t get into watching late night horror movies and instead worshipped football. ‘That was the best time,’ he explains, ‘when Hammer Films were doing really well and you could grow up reading Famous Monsters of Filmland!’\n\nI get you, Dave. The pre-teen me used to love being allowed to stay up past my normal bedtime to see whatever was on STV’s Don’t Watch Alone strand on Friday nights, usually something starring Vincent Price, Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee, or even Ollie Reed in movies like Paranoiac or The Curse of the Werewolf. As for football, my one aim during every game was to deliberately do as little as possible, straying into areas where I was unlikely to have to get involved in any action. Sorry, teammates.\n\nIt’s definitely easier to imagine Dave, Rat, Brian and the Captain sitting down to watch the Hammer Damned rather than Visconti’s two and a half hours long and uber bleak historical-drama set in the early days of Nazi Germany. This I imagine would have appealed more to the art school punks and others such as Siouxsie and Steve Severin with a taste for the decadent.\n\nAdmittedly the British film was far from yer typical Hammer production. Directed by Joseph Losey, an American blacklisted from Hollywood who would go on to work on a trio of films scripted by highbrow playwright Harold Pinter, it features sculptures by Elisabeth Frink, one of Britain’s most highly rated post-war artists. There’s even an obvious political message here which you certainly didn’t get in The Evil of Frankenstein or Scars of Dracula. And this is much more science fiction than straight horror.\n\nNot that you would guess it in the early stages of the film. It kicks off like a Transatlantic cousin of the kind of juvenile delinquency movies that Roger Corman specialised in producing around this time.\n\nA good-looking gal called Joan (Shirley Anne Field from Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and My Beautiful Laundrette), lures an older man into a brutal beating by a gang led by her older brother King (played by the aforementioned Ollie Reed).\n\nIn reviews, the thugs are generally referred to as Teddy Boys but with their leather jackets and motorbikes, they more resemble rockers, although King wears a shirt and tie and tweedy jacket and looks full-on respectable, the clobber being chosen to set him apart. Though shot in 1961, The Damned wasn’t released till 1963, a year before real-life rockers began battling it out with mods on the seafronts of towns like Margate and Hastings in Britain’s first big youth related moral panic since the rise of the Teds.\n\nSet in another coastal resort, Weymouth in Dorset (which seems to have escaped most of the mid-1960s beach violence), the portrayal of the gang here clearly comes from the imagination of someone who has never encountered anybody even on the fringes of a real gang. Ollie Reed’s King, though, does effectively exude menace and some have speculated that his character is perhaps a prototype for Alex in A Clockwork Orange.\n\nHis gang even have their own theme song (kind of) which they whistle as they go about their distasteful business. The music for Black Leather Rock was composed by serial Hammer score composer James Bernard, and I’m guessing his knowledge of rock and roll matches my expertise in current chart music. In other words, close to non-existent.\n\nIt’s rumoured that Reed provided the vocals for the track although I can’t say for sure whether he did or not. I should really have ordered my team of researchers and fact checkers to deliver a definitive answer to this but I think it is very likely. Ollie did release a couple of singles in the early 1960s and later sang in Ken Russell’s madcap reimagining of The Who’s Tommy, most notably on a duet with ex-Elvis girlfriend Ann-Margret. I think I can say with a very high degree of certainty which ‘King’ she reckoned had the best voice.\n\nToday, many older folk will remember Reed more for his hellraising antics than his acting; turning up blootered to TV studios for interviews and generally making an arse of himself. I’ll take that kinda thing anytime over today’s average actors, who appear only interested in spouting some PR approved virtue signalling and talking up their generally awful films, but it’s a pity too that Reed became such an out of control and clownish character, as he really was a gifted actor, turning in memorable performances in a range of work including Ken Russell’s The Devils, David Cronenberg’s The Brood and Nicolas Roeg’s Castaway. At one point he was even among the favourites to take over the role of James Bond. Honestly! Just imagine: ‘A pint of vodka martini. Shaken not stirred.’\n\nHammer did little to promote The Damned. Against the director’s wishes, its running time was trimmed from 96 to 87 minutes, and it was relegated to the bottom half of a double bill with a psychological thriller named Maniac.\n\nIn America, it took another few years to be screened. Renamed These Are The Damned, its running time there was further cut down to just 77 minutes. Among those who watched the film when it was later shown on TV were Cleveland act The Electric Eels, a nihilistic bunch of ‘counter counter-culturalists’ who made music that nowadays tends to get described as proto-punk. They loved the movie. ‘Oliver Reed as a sexually deviant Teddy Boy, can’t get better than that,’ guitarist John Morton enthused to Noisey a decade or so ago. The Electric Eels even went as far as to record their own very short and cacophonous version of Black Leather Rock and Morton later recorded the track for a second time with new band X___X. Here’s his first stab at the tune:\n\nThe Eels only ever played five or six shows while they were together and none of their songs were released until after their implosion. Luckily, much of it has surfaced since, including Black Leather Rock, which is on their compilation The Eyeball of Hell (and more recently it found its way onto another comp, Spin Age Blasters).\n\nTheir music (or what they liked to term anti-music) anticipated punk in many respects and they also embraced experimentation onstage, utilizing vacuum cleaners and lawnmowers, so a little bit Stooges, a little bit Karlheinz Stockhausen. If you wanna hear a wee bit more, this is the first of their posthumously released music to be made available, Agitated, which Rough Trade brought out in 1979 – and has any singer ever sounded as mightily pissed off as Dave E?\n\nOnly one of their members went on to taste any real success in the music business, drummer Nick Knox, who played for a lengthy spell with The Cramps.\n\nSpeaking of that band, here’s a song from Knox’s time behind their drumkit. This one made the soundtrack of Martin Scorsese’s disappointing Cape Fear in 1991. This is The Creature from the Black Leather Lagoon:\n\nFifty years ago, Merry Xmas Everybody clocked up around half a million advance orders and entered the British singles chart at #1. It went on to sell a million and has been included in roughly a million Christmas compilation albums since then. Estimates suggest that the song generates royalties of around £500,000 every year and, as I type, it’s #33 in the UK Christmas chart but forget all that. There are better Slade tracks out there.\n\nI don’t always agree with Noel Gallagher but when he declared How Does It Feel? to be ‘Easily one of the best songs ever written,’ on the 1999 doc It’s Slade, this was an assessment that I wasn’t going to argue with.\n\nIt’s early 1975 and two music related films are playing at cinemas around Britain. One is Stardust with David Essex; the other is Slade in Flame. Both are more glum than glam.\n\nIn the case of Flame, the downbeat nature of the movie proved a surprise. A big surprise. Slade were perceived as a good-time band. Never preachy, the foursome were more keen to give folk a laugh than a lecture and looked like naturals to star in big screen comedy along the lines of A Hard Day’s Night. This almost came to pass, with a quip-heavy script being touted for them called The Quiteamess Experiment, aiming to parody The Quatermass Xperiment, the 1955 British sci-fi horror movie.\n\nInstead, the Midlands band chose a very different vehicle. As director Richard Loncraine explained: ‘I wanted to make a film about the dirty end of the rock’n’roll business. I wanted to show the shitty little clubs that these bands have to play. Slade were very on board with this.’\n\nAndrew Birkin, the brother of Jane, was drafted in to write a screenplay and, along with Loncraine, he travelled to North America with the band on tour to get to know them better and gain an insight into what life on the road consisted of.\n\nFilmed mostly in the summer of 1974, Flame is set in 1967, in an England that is no hotbed of hippiedom, a world where you’re more likely to see a pigeon shack than a peace symbol. Here’s a small illustration of the film’s gritty nature: Noddy Holder’s character Stoker, a pigeon fancier, is shat on by one of his birds.\n\nCommercially speaking, this approach was always going to prove, at best, a gamble. Many young fans found it difficult to distinguish between Slade and Flame and didn’t want to see their idols bickering onscreen against such a bleak backdrop. They wanted slapstick and fantasy.\n\nMusically too, this was a very different Slade from the chart behemoths of recent years with their string of raucous, singalong number one hits. Piano, horns and flute were not standard Slade song ingredients, but they work fantastically well on the relatively subdued How Does It Feel? Here’s a slightly abridged version from Dutch music show TopPop, I believe.\n\nOn its release, Slade in Flame was neither a critical hit nor box-office success, although its reputation has rightly grown over the years. Mark Kermode even called it ‘the Citizen Kane of British rock movies’ and later even named one of his books How Does It Feel? Noddy’s performance, incidentally, impresses the most, while the rest of the boys don’t disgrace themselves. Johnny Shannon is perfect as the band’s vindictive bawbag booking agent, soon replaced by Robert Seymour (Tom Conti), a posho moneyman branching into music, who begins to (not) look after their interests. Alan Lake also convinces as a low-grade Lothario singer ditched to make way for new vocalist Stoker.\n\nThere was talk of a follow-up film. Birkin favoured a more upbeat cinematic outing second time around and got as far as penning a treatment provisionally titled Down in Flames. A Titanic spoof, it imagined the band playing a cross-channel ferry that hits an iceberg and sinks. Sounds like it might have ended up quite a mess if it had ever been green-lit.\n\nChart-wise, Slade’s hits began to dry up with How Does It Feel? only reaching #15 in Britain, while most subsequent singles failed to match even that. By 1977, they could even title an album Whatever Happened to Slade. This is also the title of a new book, Daryl Easlea’s Whatever Happened to Slade? When the Whole World Went Crazee, which I’m currently reading and would recommend.\n\nRichard Loncraine went on to helm episodes of Band Of Brothers and won a Silver Bear for Best Director at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 for Richard III, a cinematic success which Andrew Birkin also enjoyed, earning his Silver Bear award for his flawed but utterly fascinating version of Ian McEwan’s brilliant novel The Cement Garden starring niece Charlotte Gainsbourg.\n\nBefore that, he’d co-adapted The Name of the Rose and also co-wrote and directed Salt on Our Skin in 1992. The latter was not the success it had been tipped to be, perhaps due to my appearance as an extra talking to Greta Scacchi – who I’d fancied ever since seeing her in The Ebony Tower with Toyah and Larry Olivier – didn’t make the final cut. On reflection, possibly other more important factors counted against the film, though.\n\nFrom a 1970s act looking back to the previous decade to the real thing. The Creation recorded How Does It Feel To Feel as the profile of Flame was supposedly exploding. No such fame for The Creation, though they were briefly a pretty big deal in what was then West Germany.\n\nProduced by Shel Talmy, this is the fifth single by the band beloved by the likes of The Television Personalities, Alan McGee and Paul Weller.\n\nMerry Christmas, Everybody!\n\nThis week, two 1987 Hong Kong action thrillers for the price of one.\n\nFirstly, a little explanation. These were shot back to back by Taylor Wong, but it was the sequel Tragic Hero which came out first. Why?\n\nWell, John Woo’s A Better Tomorrow had recently established itself as a landmark in East Asian cinema. Not only did it break box-office records, but critics loved it too. It won best film at the 1987 Hong Kong Film Awards, while Chow Yun-Fat picked up the best actor gong. His trademark trench coat even set a local fashion trend – with Triads themselves reputedly embracing the craze\n\nWith the actor’s profile sky-high, producer Johnny Mak wanted to take full advantage of his star power and decided that as it was more action packed and Chow Yun-Fat was more prominent in the latter movie, Tragic Hero should be released first with Rich and Famous following on three months later.\n\nThis is a flawed but understandable choice, which also allowed time so Cantopop superstar Alan Tam of The Wynners could be incorporated into the movie, his addition being seen as another marketing boost.\n\nI can’t see any advantage in anybody watching Tragic Hero first myself.\n\nRich and Famous is the more epic of the pair, aiming for the kind of historical sweep of The Godfather and Once Upon a Time in America. It starts as refugees are flooding out of mainland China to escape the murderous and totalitarian regime of Chairman Mao.\n\nWhen one refugee dies in an overcrowded camp, his pal Kit feels dutybound to adopt his little boy Lam Ting-kwok (Andy Lau), who bonds speedily with new family, cousin Tang Wai-chu (Pauline Wong) and most particularly, brother Tang Kar-yung (Alex Man).\n\nTaylor Wong then fast-forwards us to 1969 with the trio now young adults. Yung has developed a serious gambling problem. In an illegal gambling den, he alters his betting slip, forging the number of the winning greyhound in a race but the bookie spots his tampering and has Yung beaten up. Kwok attempts to help, but they’re hopelessly outnumbered.\n\n‘The penalty for forging tickets us cutting off fingers,’ Yung is warned, when taken to see the man who runs the gambling operation on behalf of powerful crime boss Lee Ah-chai. Kwok pleads on his behalf, and Yung is given 10 days to pay it off his debt of almost $10,000 HK, fingers intact.\n\nHe devises a scheme to steal the money from a gang of drug traffickers led by Boss Chu Lo-tai (aka Old Chu) and this ends disastrously with Wai-chu being stabbed and Kwok held prisoner.\n\nLuckily, Lee Ah-chai (Chow Yun-fat), has taken a shine to Wai-Chu, who now works as a bar hostess. She persuades him to intervene on their behalf. Chu does release Kwok but not before making him swallow boiling coffee and stubbing out a cigar in his mouth.\n\nKwok’s bravery impresses Chai, who enlists both brothers into his gang, though he turns down the chance to offer their wannabe gangster pal Mak Ying-hung (Alan Tam) a job with him after he fails to collect a debt.\n\nBy 1973, both Kwok and Yung have risen through the ranks with Chai clearly rating Kwok higher than his brother, who employs an obsequious manner whenever he’s together with his boss. Chai, of course, sees through this ploy to gain favour. Yung also talks when he shouldn’t, which Chai finds disrespectful.\n\nTheir growing antipathy is exacerbated when Yung finds himself falling in love with Lau Po-yee (Carina Lau), a nurse who looks after Chai’s friend Fan. Like Chai, she sees through Yung’s fake facade. ‘I know what kind of person he really is,’ she tells her cousin Ying-hung. ‘Hiding his ruthlessness behind that smiley face.’\n\nShe prefers Chai, who is smitten by her too.\n\nOne outburst during a meeting of Triads earns Yung a vicious putdown and demotion by Chai. This sets in motion, a plan that will make sure that the wedding of Chai and Po-yee in a big church in Happy Valley (no, not the one in West Yorkshire where Sarah Lancashire pounded a beat) will always be remembered for all the wrong reasons.\n\nTragic Hero picks up in the 1980s, with Kwok having given up his career in crime, relocating to Malacca in Malaysia where he has married and adopted the number of children that would drive Keir Starmer apoplectic – I’d guess around ten too many for the Labour leader’s liking.\n\nChai’s aim now is to become a legitimate businessman but this will be no easy task with Yung utterly determined to kill him.\n\nNot surprisingly Chow Yun-fat is great as Chai and if I had to make a list of the ten best actors of my lifetime, it would be hard not to find a place for the man. Pauline Wong deserves plaudits too for her portrayal as Wai-chu, who clearly loves Chai, but makes do with helping him whenever possible in her role as housekeeper and confidant.\n\nDanny Lee makes a ‘special appearance’ as a maverick cop and it’s a pity he wasn’t given a more substantial role, as in his limited scenes with Chow Yun-fat, the pair display a great chemistry – they did get a lot of practice together around this time and would soon go on to star together in one of Hong Kong’s biggest box-office hits of the era, John Woo’s The Killer.\n\nMany might disagree, but I reckon Alex Man puts in the finest performance here as the increasingly unstable psychopath Yung, who by the end of Tragic Hero has proven himself one of the big screen’s most vindictive ever villains.\n\nIt’s likely best not to approach either film hoping to witness the level of cinematic genius that Francis Ford Coppola achieved with his Godfather saga, but this epic story of brotherhood, backstabbing and bullets, is – despite an occasional touch of melodrama – one of the best examples of Hong Kong’s ‘heroic bloodshed’ genre with some highly memorable characters and stunning action sequences.\n\nThe movies are released today on the Eureka Classics imprint. For more information, click here.\n\nThis week, Junya Satō’s 1973 action classic based on the cult manga.\n\nI’m no expert on this kind of thing, but discovered yesterday that Takao Saitō’s Golgo 13 is the world’s longest running manga series. Incredibly, it’s been in circulation since the tail end of the ’60s and is still proving popular today, despite its creator’s death in 2019. Inevitably, as its success spread in the 1970s, the major Tokyo film studios began considering adapting one of the Saitō’s tales for the big screen, a common enough practice with Lady Snowblood and Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance being two other manga inspired movies that also appeared around this time.\n\nGolgo 13 begins in Tehran, where a man in a Saturday Night Fever suit is ferociously beaten by a gang of thugs. He’s then tortured as the henchmen interrogate him, desperate to know who he works for. He’s killed before he can reveal the answer to that one.\n\nWe then cut to a plane landing in Beirut. One of its passengers is known as Duke Togo or Golgo 13, the latter alias given to him in a West German prison, a reference to Judas Iscariot, whose betrayal sent Jesus Christ to his crucifixion at Golgotha, while the 13 derives from that number’s reputation for bringing bad luck. I guess he wasn’t the most popular inmate in that particular penitentiary.\n\nTogo/Golgo is a rude man with no time for formalities and no observable sense of humour. He only ever speaks when it’s strictly necessary. As characters go, he isn’t a million miles away from Clint Eastwood’s Man with No Name, but there’s also a little Sean Connery era Bond in Togo’s DNA.\n\nRather than a bounty hunter or spy, though, he’s an assassin, one of the few facts we ever learn about him. Not being saddled with any real backstory, though, only adds to his air of mystique. The worldwide intelligence community can’t even pin down his true identity but a shady organisation somehow manage to track him down. This is to offer him the chance to carry out the killing of another mysterious figure, Max Boa (Ahmad Ghadakchian). Supposedly a shipping agent, Boa is believed to be an international smuggler of weapons and drugs. And wherever he operates, beautiful young woman regularly disappear. Richard Flanagan (Nosratollah Karimi), the leader of the organisation, believes that one of these presumably kidnapped females is his daughter.\n\nTogo’s price for the hit is half a million American dollars to be deposited in his Swiss bank account. The fee is agreed.\n\nKen Takakura, who rose to fame in his home country during the 1960s cycle of classical yakuza movies, plays Togo, a highly appropriate choice since the manga character’s appearance was, at least to some extent, based on the actor. An undisputed legend in Japan, cinema fans outside Asia might know him from Sydney Pollack’s The Yakuza, or Ridley Scott’s Black Rain from 1989.\n\nHe turns in a powerhouse performance here, oozing charisma even though his character is so unpleasant. Not only is he rude, but he lacks any sense of morality too. He’d likely agree to shoot his granny between the eyes if the price was right.\n\nTakao Saitō set two conditions for Tokyo’s Toei Studios before granting permission for them to adapt his work. Togo had to be played by Ken Takakura, and the film must be shot abroad, hence the entire movie was filmed in the Middle East, mainly in Tehran but also taking in the visually stunning ruins of Persepolis.\n\nIn these days before the overthrow of the Shah by the theocratic dictatorship of Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran looks very different to what we see from news clips today. Many men have adopted Western 1970s fashions such as big ties, big lapels and even bigger flares, while most of the women have embraced styles such as fur jackets and bright dresses. A couple are shown smoking and drinking alcohol and we even see one belly dancing on the stage of a club.\n\nI should mention that the Iranian characters curiously all speak Japanese even among themselves, while many have Western sounding names. In addition to Nosratollah Karimi in the role of Flanagan, Pouri Baneai, for example, plays Catherine Morton, who is arranged to act as Togo’s escort during his stay in Iran. This, incidentally, must be the only ever example of a Japanese/Iranian cinematic co-production.\n\nIt has been difficult to see Golgo 13 outside of Japan for many years, although it did make a rare appearance at the 70th Edinburgh International Film Festival. It’s released today on the Eureka Classics range in a new 2K restoration. This is its UK debut on home video and I’m certainly glad to have finally caught up with it, fifty years after it was made.\n\nTremendously entertaining throughout, the movie features an array of colourful villains, including Max Boa with his green parrot almost permanently perched on his shoulder and a hitman who hides his pistol in his prosthetic leg. There are some great set pieces too. The gunfight in the ruins is very spaghetti western (and some of the soundtrack definitely owes a debt to Ennio Morricone’s work for Sergio Leone too). The pace is perfect, the cinematography spectacular and there’s some interesting plot twists such as one police inspector’s wife joining the list of local abductees. A fate which befalls Catherine too.\n\nPouri Baneai is highly compelling in this role, and it’s a shame she didn’t enjoy a much longer time in acting. Not too surprisingly, after the revolution, she was summoned to Evin Prison, a jail synonymous with human rights abuses, and questioned. Although not incarcerated, her career in films ended abruptly as the Ayatollah waged war on the arts in Iran.\n\nI doubt I’ll be seeking out the manga series – though I wouldn’t completely rule it out – but I’m definitely keen now to see the 1977 sequel Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon, where Ken Takakura is replaced by another celebrated Japanese actor, Sonny Chiba. Hopefully, this will receive a Blu-ray release soon too.\n\nExtras on Golgo 13 include a new audio commentary by Mike Leeder and Arne Venema, a pair who are always informal and funny but also informative. The first print run of 2000 copies will feature a limited edition O-card slipcase and collector’s booklet.\n\nFor more details, click here.\n\nThis week, a look at a couple of new Eureka Classics Blu-rays that are released today. First up is Knockabout, an early example of Hong Kong’s kung fu comedy craze, and the first film to star Sammo Hung (who also directed it) and Yuen Biao together.\n\nBryan Leung Kar-Yan is Dai Pao, while Yuen Biao, in his first leading role, is his brother Yi Pao. They’re are a pair of low-grade grifters who would happily rip each other off if the chance arose. They do enjoy the odd success – like conning a gold dealer who is equally greedy and gullible, but they pick the wrong mark in Old Fox (played by Lau Kar-Wing in a not terribly convincing grey wig).\n\nOutwitted by the older man, they seek revenge by attempting to beat him up. This is another bad idea and results in him giving them both black eyes. Sensing that learning a mastery of kung fu could come in handy whenever their scams fail, they offer to become his students. Old Fox is reluctant but eventually relents, enlisting the brothers to help him in his struggle against some longstanding enemies.\n\nOld Fox really is far from the kindly and virtuous master that we usually meet in kung fu movies, as the brothers will soon discover to their cost.\n\nThe balance between comedy and martial arts tips in favour of the former for much of the movie with Yuen Biao and Leung Kar-yan making for a highly likeable double act.\n\nThe role of Yi Pao was intended to launch Yuen Biao into the kind of stardom that his fellow Peking Opera School pals Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung were already experiencing after box office hits like Drunken Master and Enter the Fat Dragon.\n\nBiao did go on to enjoy a long and successful career, without ever reaching the heights of his two ‘brothers’. His acrobatic cartwheels, kicks and backflips are a true joy to watch here, and Sammo Hung’s Beggar putting him through his paces with a skipping rope is one of the great martial arts training sequences. Sammo, incidentally, is predictably good in the role of the jovial beggar, a man with a pet monkey and some kiss ass monkey kung fu moves. As for ‘Beardy’ Leung, despite having never studied any martial arts, he looks pretty accomplished in his fight scenes.\n\nThe cast are all in good form actually, Karl Maka’s memorable cameo as Captain Baldy being only one of many highlights. The movie is a delight which keeps getting better and better. Its ferocious finale is one of the longest in Hong Kong action movie history and entirely justifies its length.\n\nNext up, another kung fu cult favourite, this time one directed by Yuen Woo-ping, the legendary action choreographer of The Matrix, Kill Bill and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\n\nYuen Woo-ping plunges us straight into the action here with an eruption of mayhem in a teahouse, which leaves a number of police officers and the wife of a fearsome criminal dead.\n\nThat criminal, known as White-Fronted Tiger (Yuen Shun-yee), seeks out an old pal who lets him hide out with a theatrical troupe he is involved with. It’s here his path crosses with Little Gueng (Yuen Biao), a laundry worker who is scared of dogs; scared of the men who refuse to pay their laundry bills; and even more than a little scared of his domineering big sister – who beats him up because he’s so hopeless at collecting debts. Needless to say, even though he doesn’t know the true identity of the troupe’s newcomer, he’s terrified of White-Fronted Tiger. Worse still, the psychotic wrongdoer takes an immediate dislike to him.\n\nMaybe Gueng’s best pal Leung Foon (Bryan Leung Kar-yan) can persuade his master Wong Fei-hung (Kwan Tak-hing) to teach the fearful young man the fighting skills required to take on the man that Gueng calls Painted Face.\n\nNobody could ever accuse Yuen Woo-ping of being scared to shift tone. Dreadnaught begins like a Chinese version of a spaghetti western, then switches into slapstick mode soon after. There is some superb physical comedy on display, such as Gueng demonstrating his unorthodox kung fu method of drying laundry – later referenced by Joel Schumacher in Batman Forever – and also some less amusing broad Hong Kong humour, although I did laugh at one visual gag involving some incompetent police officers drawing the wrong conclusion about a dead man covered by a blanket.\n\nThere are also elements of the buddy movie, while the final third of the film strays into serial killer territory – and it is bizarre that a movie with cross-eyed cops and men with weird hair sprouting from unsightly facial warts also manages to feature a genuinely unsettling scene when Leung Foon clashes with White-Fronted Tiger.\n\nConsistently entertaining, Dreadnaught also marked the final time that Kwan Tak-hing portrayed Cantonese folk hero Wong Fei-hung – a man also portrayed onscreen by Jackie Chan and Jet Li. The actor bowed out on a high on what is said to have been his 77th time in the role. No, that’s not a typo.\n\nTak-hing, who was in his mid-seventies during filming, even features prominently in the film’s standout scene, a long brawl between two Lion Dance teams that brilliantly showcases Woo-ping’s virtuoso choreography skills.\n\nThis Eureka Classics releases of Knockabout and Dreadnaught are their UK debuts on Blu-ray, both in brand new 2K restorations.\n\nSpecial features on both include limited edition O-Card slipcases featuring new artwork by Darren Wheeling [2000 copies]; reversible sleeve design featuring original poster artwork; new feature length audio commentaries by Frank Djeng & Michael Worth, and new feature length audio commentaries by Mike Leeder & Arne Venema, plus collector’s booklets featuring new writing by James Oliver.\n\nFor more on Knockabout, click here.\n\nFor more on Dreadnaught, click here.\n\nThis week, a review written two and a half years ago for Louder Than War on an award-winning film from 2018 that examined the conflict in Ukraine at that point. It’s been described as ‘a sprawling black comedy’ but if you’re looking for laughs, then best avoid this one. Donbass, though, might give at least some insights into the horror of what we’ve been seeing on our TV screens in recent days.\n\n*\n\nNamed after a region in Eastern Ukraine, Donbass is a film about what is going on there and how it affects the people living there on both sides of the divide. The Ukrainian regular army and volunteers fight separatist gangs, supported by Putin’s Russia. Corruption and criminality of all kinds are rife. Humiliation is commonplace. Violence can flare at any moment.\n\nEach of the thirteen segments that make up the film is based on a real event and are loosely linked. Most characters only feature in one section, although some feature in more.\n\nBorn in Belarus, when that country was part of the Soviet Union, writer/director Sergei Loznitsa has been dubbed the ‘maestro of miserablism’ and ‘art cinema’s ultimate bad time merchant.’ Watching Donbass, it doesn’t take very long to figure out why.\n\nIt’s like a series of thirteen nightmares, which when taken together, offers a damning critique of this part of the world.\n\nAs Donbass opens, we see a group of actors and extras getting their make-up applied in the back of a trailer. A production assistant orders them to get out, presumably to film their scene. But this isn’t a feature film or TV drama that they’re taking part in. This is propaganda, a fake news story with controlled explosions in the background and a burnt-out bus. A woman who moments earlier was complaining to a makeup artist about not enjoying her job is suddenly acting like a stunned witness to bombings. ‘It’s impossible to live like this,’ she complains. ‘Every morning I wake up full of fear.’\n\nLater, we see a snippet of the incident being viewed as authentic reportage.\n\nA looter is made to walk a gauntlet where he is beaten by around twenty soldiers with long sticks. A German journalist is repeatedly branded a fascist, without a shred of evidence. ‘If you aren’t a fascist,’ one Russian soldier taunts him, ‘then your grandfather was.’ A news reporter is given a guided tour of an overcrowded bomb shelter that is now home to city-dwellers seeking safety. The poverty is Dickensian, several inhabitants lie on beds obviously very ill. There is no electricity and little food or medicine. The sole toilet isn’t working. ‘It’s as if we’re living in the Stone Age,’ one of the inhabitants observes.\n\nThe most memorable scene, though, is where a Ukrainian man with his hands cuffed, is forced to stand by a lamp-post in Russia’s proxy Donetsk People’s Republic. The intention here being that passers-by can abuse him verbally or physically. It sounds medieval but some young men who blow smoke into his face record events on their smartphones to give the punishment a modern twist.\n\nA hate mob soon assembles, with one old woman squashing a tomato into his face. It’s gruelling to watch as the barbarism only gets worse.\n\nDonbass lasts just over two hours long but never feels like it. With one possible exception, a raucous wedding ceremony, the vignettes don’t overstay their welcome.\n\nThe story ends where it began. In the trailer with some of the actors glimpsed in the opening scene. It’s the longest sequence in the film and its final ten minutes or so is filmed in one long take with the camera static and focussing on characters who we can hear in the middle distance but not identify. It’s a chilling finale to an often compulsively mesmerising film.\n\nSergei Loznitsa won the prestigious Un Certain Regard Award for Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018 and he fully merited the recognition.\n\nFor more on the film, click here .\n\nPrano Bailey-Bond’s Censor must be one of the most promising debuts of 2021.\n\nThe film takes us back to the mid-1980s, when following on from muggings, punk rock and football hooligans, a new moral panic emerged in the shape of video nasties. Encouraged by newspapers like The Daily Mail and Christian conservatives like Mary Whitehouse, some films eventually ended up being prosecuted, many were cut and a list of ‘video nasties’ was drawn up. Many making their way on to the list were worthless trash. Others like Tenebrae, Suspiria and Scanners are today available uncut and critically acclaimed.\n\nOf course, as usually happens with this kind of crusade, many were alerted and attracted to something they might otherwise never have been aware of, some becoming intent on tracking down as many as they could get their paws on.\n\nHere, one of the country’s moral guardians is Enid Baines, played by Niamh Algar. Uptight, everything is far from alright with Enid. She works in a drab warren like environment for a version of the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) and believes utterly that she’s ‘protecting people’ in her role.\n\nEnid suffers from the fallout of a traumatic incident in her past when her younger sister Nina mysteriously disappeared in a local wood while out with her. She clings on to the hope that Nina is still somehow alive and while assessing a B-movie chiller by director Frederick North, she convinces herself that the low-rent scream queen onscreen might indeed be her long-lost sister.\n\nNiamh Algar is a revelation here, managing always to ensure that we empathise with her cold and prudish character even when disagreeing absolutely with what she says and does. Censor looks striking too, with shades of Italian masters like Mario Bava and Dario Argento, as well as British documentary photographer Martin Parr. As for the ending, I think I better watch it again.\n\nThe unluckiest film to be given a general release in 2021 must be Our Ladies. It’s based on Alan Warner’s 1998 novel, which on publication was optioned almost immediately. The fact that the novel was titled The Sopranos necessitated a switch of names once the American classic TV of the same name came to our screens the following year. By the time it had finally been filmed, comparisons with Derry Girls, a sitcom also about a bunch of pals attending a Catholic all-girls school in the 1990s became inevitable. There are even some comments on IMDB suggesting it’s a rip-off of the Channel 4 show.\n\nOur Ladies eventually premiered at the 2019 BFI London Film Festival and was then screened at the 2020 Glasgow Film Festival on 28 February, just prior to what was scheduled to be its cinematic release in Britain that March. Then COVID-19 struck, and a string of delays gradually put its general release back to August 2021 in Britain. Good things come to those who wait, though.\n\nThe plot concerns a group of Fort William schoolgirls who travel to Edinburgh to take part in a choir competition. In the big city, the girls are more interested in boys, booze, boots and the only singing they’re interested in is at an all-day Northern Soul karaoke session, where they even perform a surprisingly enjoyable version of Tainted Love.\n\nI’m sure some of the faces here will become much better known in years to come.\n\nLook out too for Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza, Julia Ducournau’s Palme d’Or winning body horror Titane, and Parallel Mothers, the latest melodramatic marvel by Pedro Almodóvar starring Penélope Cruz.\n\nBest film of the year? I couldn’t claim to have watched enough new dramas over the past twelve months to make any definitive judgement – I’m still catching up hence the belated nature of this post – but The Card Counter was certainly a standout.\n\nPaul Schrader specialises in bleak films about intense loners facing existential problems. Still delivering the goods in his seventies, his latest focuses on a man known as William Tell (Oscar Isaac), who teaches himself the art of card counting while in prison.\n\nI love my Cincinnati Kids, Mississippi Grinds and California Splits. In an average year it’s about three to one on that I’ll see a new gambling film that hooks me in. The Card Counter did just that. Not that’s it’s really about poker.\n\nWilliam doesn’t like to draw attention to himself and possesses the self-discipline to bet small and leave a casino with more money than he entered with but not the kind of money that will change lives. Winning big would counterproductive. If casinos pick up on his card counting skills he’d be banned.\n\nDespite himself, his expertise is spotted by La Linda (Tiffany Haddish), a ‘people person’ who runs a stable of gamblers bankrolled by a wealthy syndicate and judges he’s ready to hit the big time.\n\nThis tempts William, as by winning big money, he could pay off the debts of Cirk (Sheridan), the son of an Abu Ghraib guard who worked with William and who later committed suicide. They go on the road, with Tell hoping to win enough cash to rid the younger man of his debts and impart some much-needed wisdom to him too.\n\nThe three central performers share an impressive chemistry, and Willem Dafoe is very good too. As always.\n\nAn Oscar for Oscar Isaac? He might deserve it, but Will Smith would be a better bet for that Best Actor gong. As for Paul Schrader gaining even a nomination for his script or directing, here’s another tip: keep your money in your pocket. Overlooked in the past for his screenplays for films like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, Schrader’s sole nomination came via First Reformed and he pissed off Hollywood by admitting that he was conflicted as ‘I have never really respected the Academy for their choices.’ This won’t be forgotten any time soon.\n\nA million miles from Hollywood is Nobody Loves You and You Don’t Deserve to Exist (my favourite title of the year) written and directed by Brett Gregory. This is a microbudget independent shot in Manchester on a Sony A7R III. Consisting of a series of extended monologues, which might be better suited to a theatrical piece, it tells the harrowing story of a man going through a emotional and psychological breakdown. That man Jack is played by David Howell. His searing performance won’t be seen by the millions sat in multiplexes but it will lodge in the memories of those who do take a chance to see the film.\n\nFinally, there were some impressive physical releases in 2021 too. BFI gave us Dennis Hopper’s nihilistic Out of the Blue, Mike Leigh’sfinest drama Naked, and Chris Petit’s underappreciated post-punk road movie Radio On.\n\nEureka Masters of Cinema, meanwhile issued Spaghetti Western classic and Tarantino favourite The Great Silence, and VIY, a legendary 1969 film made in the Soviet Union based on Nikolai Gogol’s novella of the same name. It’s said to be the only real horror movie made during the Communist era and only allowed to be made as Stalin had been a fan of Gogol.\n\nAnd if anyone has ever wondered who the witchy female on the left of my header is, that’s Natalya Varley, who plays Pannochka here.\n\nFor obvious reasons, 2021 was a year when my visits to cinemas were few and far between. As in, you could count them on one hand. With three fingers to spare.\n\nThe most hyped movie of the year was No Time To Die which I felt No Desire To See – the last time I paid in to see a Bond was back when Roger Moore was regularly arching an eyebrow as if to acknowledge the silliness of the scripts he was being saddled with. The publicity machine around Peter Jackson’s The Beatles: Get Back was also great, arguably unprecedented for a music documentary. Whether it was justified, I can’t say. Disney+, no thanks.\n\nAnyway, here’s some words on the two films – both music docs – that I did make sure to see on the big screen. First up, Todd Haynes’ The Velvet Underground.\n\nThe young Lou Reed adores doo-wop and rockabilly. He plays in bands from a young age and even records a single as a member of The Jades, which gets a spin on the radio. ‘We got a royalty cheque for two dollars and seventy-nine cents,’ he notes dryly. ‘Which, in fact, turned out to be a lot more than I made in The Velvet Underground.’\n\nHe is prone to temper tantrums and is generally disagreeable – although this trait is common in many talented artists musicians and too much niceness can lead to becoming Travis. Lou’s younger sister Merrell debunks talk of their parents forcing him to undergo electric shock therapy to rid him of any homosexual tendencies as ‘simplistic and cartoonish’, which his old pal Allan Hyman, who knew the family, agrees with. His father was certainly distant but far from the ogre he has sometimes been presented as.\n\nJohn Cale’s granny, though, comes across a bigoted old tyrant. A fearsome Welsh nationalist, she bans the use of English in her home, where Cale’s mum and English father reside after marrying. As his father isn’t a Welsh speaker and John hasn’t been taught English, they can’t properly communicate for years.\n\nAfter a spell studying music in London, Cale heads to New York in 1964. It’s a hotbed of experimental cinema, avant-garde music and pop art. He teams up with La Monte Young, who’s being seen as a successor to John Cage and joins his Theatre of Eternal Music. He practices drones on his viola every day, while developing a taste for Muddy Waters, The Everly Brothers and beat music.\n\nAccommodation is found in an apartment where Jack Smith of Flaming Creatures fame lives. Smith is one of the leading lights in the city’s underground movie scene, along with Jonas Mekas, Andy Warhol and Barbara Rubin. I say underground but as a young Mekas puts it: ‘We are not part really of any subculture, we are the culture.’\n\nMeanwhile, Reed lands a job with Pickwick Records as their in-house songsmith and is paid to churn out sets of songs from nine to five for themed albums sold in Woolworths, ‘twelve surfing songs or twelve breakup songs,’ he explains as examples. It sounds like a not so Brill Building.\n\nPickwick then persuade John Cale and his pal Tony Conrad to back Lou on a track called The Ostrich. This fails to launch a new dance craze but is a great listen with a whole lotta whooping and a guitar riff borrowed from Then He Kissed Me. Merrill Reed even demonstrates how to do the Ostrich and it’s a delightful moment.\n\nThe Primitives are not destined to last long, and neither is Lou’s association with the label, who won’t let him record any of his more personal compositions. A literate live wire, his dark lyrics are influenced by various Beats, Baudelaire, Hubert Selby Jr. and his former tutor Delmore Schwartz.\n\nEnter Sterling Morrison, a university pal of Lou’s with a sinuous yet precise guitar style, who isn’t wearing any shoes when Lou recruits him one day in winter and then enter Maureen Tucker, whose basic but inventive drum style will perfectly anchor their sound together and who is presumably wearing shoes when she’s invited to join.\n\nBarbara Rubin witnesses an early performance at the Café Bizarre and persuades Warhol to see them too. Warhol agrees to sponsor them. They dress in black and wear Ray-Bans indoors at night. They sing about scoring heroin and sado-masochism. Warhol films and a light show are projected onto them and Gerard Malanga and Mary Woronov dance with them onstage, brandishing whips. Herman’s Hermits, this bunch are not.\n\nEnter Nico, a German who is conventionally beautiful and who intones her vocals with a very unconventional voice. She becomes a temporary member at the insistence of Warhol. They’re like no other group: High Art/Low Art. American/European. Male/Female. Gentile/Jewish. Straight/Not so Straight.\n\nMoves are made to build a reputation outside their Manhattan milieu. On the West Coast, the gang hit Venice Beach to work on their suntans, with Reed especially keen to fit in some surfing after all those tracks on the subject he’d penned at Pickwick. No, I’m joking. California in 1967 is not a natural habitat for the Velvets. ‘We hated hippies,’ Mary Woronov sneers. ‘I mean, flower power? Burning bras? What the fuck is wrong with you?’ Maureen Tucker also rails against the ‘love and peace crap.’ As she explains: ‘You cannot change minds by handing a flower to some bozo who wants to shoot you.’\n\nThe most creative acts tend to have high levels of conflict with their ranks – remember too much niceness can lead to becoming Travis – but when Cale and Reed go to war, the conflict is just too excessive. ‘I really didn’t know how to please him, Cale admits, still astonished by Lou’s vituperative nature five decades later. ‘Try and be nice and he’d hate you more.’\n\nHaynes doesn’t shy away from this abrasiveness and he also lets Amy Taubin take a swipe at the Factory, complaining about women being judged by their looks there. So she likely won’t like me saying that she resembles an angel during her Warhol screentest. The director also limits talking heads to those who were there at the time, so thankfully no bores like Bono or Chris Martin gabbering on about how important Reed & Co were to U2 or Coldplay.\n\nThe documentary speeds up. Nico leaves. Lou fires Andy. Andy is shot. Lou sacks John. Doug joins. They stop wearing black but continue to craft some superb music. Pale Blue Eyes is one of the most beautiful tracks ever committed to vinyl, as is Candy Says, which Doug Yule sings.\n\nMany hated them but nobody could deny their versatility. Their previous album had ended with the avant-garage rock squall of Sister Ray. This time round, the final track was a slice of hipster vaudeville with a quirky vocal by Moe.\n\nAlbum #4, Loaded, is even further removed from their revolutionary beginnings. For Joseph Freeman, they become ‘a regular rock and roll band,’ but what a remarkably good regular rock and roll band they become. Success, though, continues to elude them. Sterling Morrison drops out to return to his studies and Lou goes to live with his parents for a spell. End of band.\n\nOnly, a version in name only led by Yule did continue on. They even toured Britain and played in Glasgow at Strathclyde Uni. There was another new album Squeeze credited to The Velvet Underground with no original members involved. None of this is mentioned here, though. Perhaps wisely.\n\nInstead, we get a frenetic montage of photos of what the Velvets got up to next flashing before our eyes, accompanied by Ocean (the drums thundering gloriously around the cinema) which morphs into a tamer version played by the reunited Velvets in 1993. This is followed by a clip of Lou in, I’d guess 1975, on the phone discussing Cale and Tucker and showing a frail looking Warhol a picture of the band in Guy Peellaert’s book Rock Dreams. An acoustic take on Heroin from the 1972 Paris show that reunited Cale, Reed and Nico, then leads us into the end credits, a curious choice as it moved the story backwards and left out two key players.\n\nRolling Stone claim the documentary is ‘as radical, daring and brilliant as the band itself,’ but that would be an impossibility. Haynes mimics the split screen technique that Warhol utilized in movies like Outer and Inner Space and Chelsea Girls, which is appropriate (and must have been a nightmare to edit together) and the story is told in a largely linear fashion with talking heads, archive footage and photos.\n\nThe effect is kaleidoscopic, the screen bursting with a dizzying array of rapidfire imagery – sometimes you wish it could be slowed down like Warhol’s Kiss movies so you could take in more. With so many of the central figures of the story now dead, it’s as near to a definitive take on the band that we’re likely to ever get and a fine tribute to the most innovative band that has ever existed. I could happily have watched even more, much more, maybe even the near eight hours runtime of Get Back.\n\nHopefully, a physical release crammed with extras appears soon, including a commentary from Haynes.\n\nThe Sparks Brothers is already out on DVD and Blu-ray with an extra disc containing a 22-song live show from London and over two hours of deleted scenes and more.\n\nEdgar Wright is a self-confessed fanboy, which he jokes about in the documentary. His idiosyncratic take on the idiosyncratic cult pop duo is two hours and fifteen minutes long and most of that time is a joy, although I would question if we really needed the gushing thoughts of so many of their enthusiasts like Jack Antonoff and DJ Lance Rock, whoever they are. Some of these clips would have been better suited to being extras. Ron and Russell are very droll though, as is Steve Jones, and it’s incredible that during their fifty-year career they’ve somehow managed to reinvent their music so many times. Ron’s look, on the other hand, never really changes.\n\nThis might be the Wright film I’ve enjoyed most since Shaun of the Dead.\n\nAs for Annette, the musical drama conceived by the Mael brothers, I’ll just say that I preferred Rollercoaster, the 1977 B-movie they appeared in.\n\nLast week saw the release of the Mockingbird Love EP, four new tracks by former Cocteau Twin Robin Guthrie. They’re all predictably good and conjure up many of those adjectives that critics love to use to describe his former band’s music. Celestial, spellbinding and ethereal for starters.\n\nBy a wee coincidence, I finally got round to watching Gregg Araki’s White Bird in A Blizzard from 2014 on the night before I became aware of the Guthrie release.\n\nSometimes the right piece of music can really set you up for a film. And Sea, Swallow Me by The Cocteau Twins and Harold Budd worked the trick for me here. A perfect mood setter, with Budd’s exquisite soft pedal piano complementing the band perfectly.\n\nYou can always rely on Araki for some solid soundtrack choices. He’s one of those American directors like Richard Kelly with a thing for what might loosely be described as British alternative music of the 1980s. It’s easy to imagine rows of shoegaze albums in his record collection, together with everything ever released by New Order, The Jesus and Mary Chain and, of course, The Cocteau Twins. In White Bird in a Blizzard, those three acts are joined by The Psychedelic Furs, Talk Talk, Echo and The Bunnymen, Everything But The Girl and others, while Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd also provide some incidental music.\n\nUnfortunately, after having my hopes built up, it turned out that the music is much better than the film as a whole.\n\nSet in suburban America from 1988 to the early 1990s, White Bird in a Blizzard is the story of 17-year-old Kat, played by Shailene Woodley, who comes home from school one afternoon to be told by a pensive father (Christopher Meloni) that her mother Eve (Eva Green) has gone. She’s been threatening to leave him for years, and he doesn’t reckon she will be coming back any time soon.\n\nThis isn’t the devastating blow that you might assume for Kat. Through a series of voice-overs and flashbacks, we learn that Eve was never mother of the year material. Or wife of the year material either. Once, her parents had been ‘the quintessential American couple’ – although Eve’s accent is more Paris than Paris, Texas – but it didn’t take long for their marriage to turn sour, with Eve treating her husband like a doormat and Kat not much better. In one particularly disturbing episode a raging Eve wakes her in the middle of the night to grill her on her sex life.\n\nKat is said to physically resemble her mother, and Eve is becoming inordinately jealous of her daughter’s youthfulness and potential future. She also doesn’t make much of an effort to disguise her sexual interest in Kat’s boyfriend Phil (Shiloh Fernandez) and her behaviour becomes increasingly irrational and her skirts progressively shorter, the longer Kat dates him.\n\n‘Not bad for 42,’ a boozed-up Eve boasts one night to the young couple as she stumbles down into the cellar wearing a skimpy outfit. And yep, she certainly hadn’t scrubbed up too badly.\n\nLike Eve, the film gets a little irrational too. Looking like the sort of thing you might expect to see on some porno website where a young man is employed to deliver pizzas (not that I watch that type of thing, honestly!), the scene featuring a barechested Phil in shorts searching for his mother’s cat as Eve sunbathes in her swimsuit is unintentionally funny.\n\nWith Eve still untraceable and Phil showing more interest in gaming and ganja than in having sex with her, Kat’s suspicions about the two maybe having had a thing surface, though not to that great an extent, with Kat maintaining a kind of ‘whatever’ attitude to her mother’s disappearance for much of the movie. And if she doesn’t give a shit about the vanishing act, why should we?\n\nDespite this, she agrees to her dad’s idea that she sees a therapist, played by Angela ‘right here, right now’ Bassett. Kat’s voice-over reveals that she feels ‘feels like an actress playing myself’, while Dr. Thaler reminds her ‘of an actress playing a therapist.’ Bassett reminded me of an actress that deserved a better role.\n\nLines of dialogue might be clunky and draw attention to themselves, but there are pluses. With some striking dream sequences, the film strays into David Lynch territory and Laura Palmer herself (Sheryl Lee) appears briefly as the new woman in Kat’s father’s life. Of course, Kat has no problems with this turn of events. Initially at least.\n\nShailene Woodley and Christopher Meloni both put in impressive enough performances and Eva Green does a great line in unhinged, although that accent of hers really should have been explained. Ultimately, the film is a disappointment but one that was still worth a watch.\n\nOne huge revelation late on, which is difficult to buy into, is delivered by a voice-over (Araki obviously isn’t a believer in the old screenwriting maxim ‘show don’t tell’) and this is immediately followed by a flashback, though not a flashback of Kat’s, which explains the disappearance with a twist ending that was even more difficult to buy into due to a lack of any real clues given. Not only that but the fact that it was never revealed whether Kat was aware of these events did niggle at me.\n\n*\n\nHere’s another of those inspired Araki soundtrack choices. Sung by Gordon (now Cindy) Sharp, formerly of The Freeze and an old pal of The Cocteaus, this is Fond Affections from This Mortal Coil’s 1984 collection It’ll End in Tears (the video is unofficial in case you’re wondering):\n\nFinally, back to Robin Guthrie, whose new album Pearldiving should be out next month on Soleil Après Minuit. For the time being, here’s Copper, the opening track on the aforementioned Mockingbird Love EP:\n\nFor more on Robin Guthrie:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/robinguthrieofficial/\n\nhttps://robinguthrie.bandcamp.com/\n\nThis week Stephen Kijak’s Shoplifters of the World, a new Smiths related comedy drama set in Denver, that tells the story of a bunch of Smiths devotees in the wake of the announcement of the band’s 1987 breakup.\n\nThe Smiths were far from the most original band of the 1980s, but with his startling wordplay and unique take on life, Morrissey would have to loom large in any discussions of the most adroit lyricist of that decade, while I would struggle to name a more gifted or versatile guitarist than Johnny Marr. Yes, I was a big fan but never an obsessive uberfan. No gladioli waving and no cardie, quiff or NHS specs for me in any attempt to resemble Morrissey, thankfully. That kind of thing always struck me as more than a little sad.\n\nThe main characters in Shoplifters of the World have no such qualms about hero worship. They adore The Smiths and in particular Morrissey. The man is pretty much the perfect human being and whatever he says goes. Remember, this is 1987.\n\nCleo (Helena Howard) is the first of this group of outsiders to discover that the band have split up – via one of the least convincing news bulletins in cinematic history. Luckily, she has gathered up some beer cans left by her dipso mum on the living room floor, so she we can see the severity of her shock as she drops them in sheer disbelief, before letting out one almighty scream, although, as the report mentioned, there had been months of speculation in the music press about the possibility of the band calling it quits.\n\nShe drives straight out to her local independent record store to discuss the bombshell with Dean, a Morrissey lookalike behind the counter, who is clearly smitten by her, and is reading about the news in Melody Maker. Impressively, in the short time since Cleo left her home, the British music press has already arrived in Colorado with Johnny Marr’s version of events making front page news in NME.\n\n‘Our music died today and nobody even cares,’ Cleo sulks. ‘I wish there was a way to get all the posers in this town to take notice.’\n\nWhat good this would achieve, I have no idea but Dean might just have a solution. ‘Something that would go down in musical history.’ But he’s keeping schtum about the details of his plan.\n\nWe soon meet more of Cleo’s pals. There’s Billy, who’s joining ‘Reagan’s army’ mainly to please his parents, and there’s Shelia (yes, really) and Patrick (honestly), a couple who are planning to visit England. Sex isn’t featuring in their relationship because Patrick wants to emulate Stephen Patrick’s celibacy. Or because he is obviously gay and looking for a convenient excuse not to have to take his frustrated partner to bed.\n\nLike Dean, Cleo, Billy, Sheila and Patrick all love endlessly punctuating their conversations with Smiths lyrics and song titles to the extent that Morrissey – who liked to swipe the odd snatch of film and theatre dialogue into his lyrics himself – ought to have been given a screenplay credit. For a bit of variety, though, they also like to quote anybody who ever inspired their Mozziah: Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and even Saturday Night and Sunday Morning‘s Arthur Seaton for starters.\n\nThis barrage of references quickly begins to grate.\n\nAs they attempt to find a party, a lovestruck Dean, presumably in an attempt to impress Cleo, makes his way over to local radio station Kiss 101 with a bunch of Smiths albums. There, he points a loaded gun at macho deejay Full Metal Mickey, interrupting his monthly Metal Marathon, and ordering him to play Smiths records back-to-back all night long.\n\nFull Metal Mickey is no fan of ‘depressive haircut bullshit’ and when told that The Smiths were the only band that mattered, he gives Dean an incredulous look and sneers: ‘You’ve clearly never listened to Twisted fucking Sister!’ But he does what he is told, although there’s never any sense that Dean would shoot him even if he continued to play Sabbath and Slayer.\n\nIronically, it’s the metalhead who is easily the movie’s most rounded and likeable character. He’s the only one with any real sense of humour or genuine insight. ‘One day, your heroes are gonna grow old,’ he warns the younger man. ‘They’re gonna change. They’re gonna put out shitty music. They’re gonna say stupid things that betray the past.’\n\nAmen to that, dude.\n\nIf you’re wondering about the inspiration behind this part of the story, a depressed young Smiths fan did once drive to a radio station in Denver, carrying a rifle and planning to force the station to air his Smiths mixtape although he failed to carry out this plan of action.\n\nThe soundtrack – and there are twenty Smiths tracks included on it – is undoubtedly magnificent, albeit it’s used with as much imagination as an episode of Heartbeat. When Cleo makes her way out of the record shop and throws a pile freshly stolen cassette tapes into her car, she does so to the sound of Shoplifters of the World Unite and when the Sally Ann brass band strikes up the introduction to Sheila Take A Bow, you won’t need me to tell you who the camera focusses on. She even takes a bow.\n\nThe film begins to flip between Cleo and her pals out on the razz and Dean and Mickey in the radio booth, where the pair learn that they might have more in common with one another than they first assumed.\n\nShoplifters of the World is not an entire stinker but neither is it a film that I’ll likely ever be tempted to watch again. None of the performances really stood out bar Joe Manganiello as Mickey. Kijak often demonstrates a good eye for a shot, and while I found his script mediocre at best, I did like the fact that not everything is magically resolved for all the characters as the closing credits beckon. The way he weaved archival Smiths footage into the film was skilfully handled too.\n\nMy main problem is that I failed to find any of this bunch very interesting. Just because they see themselves in opposition to the awful one-dimensional jocks who surround them doesn’t automatically make them likeable.\n\nWe’re especially supposed to admire Cleo’s feistiness although she oozes a snobbish sense of superiority over anyone with a different taste in music. She pretends to her pals that she’s a student with a boyfriend when neither is true. She’s a petty thief, and she complains about posers and yet smokes in the most incredibly affected way, using a long cigarette holder. She also lacks self-awareness. She criticises Molly Ringwald’s character in Pretty in Pink, thinking she was ‘kind of a bitch’ by refusing to get together with her ‘cool’ friend just because he dotes on her, while Cleo refuses to get together with a guy who would leap in front of a flying bullet for her.\n\nHe did actually say that, and I almost screamed with the same ferocity as Cleo had earlier.\n\nAnd speaking of flying bullets, she loves the idea of someone threatening another person’s life with a gun just so she can get to hear her favourite music. Yep, I much preferred Molly Ringwald’s Andie, and for all its faults, Pretty In Pink is a much better film than this.\n\nFor more on the movie click here."
