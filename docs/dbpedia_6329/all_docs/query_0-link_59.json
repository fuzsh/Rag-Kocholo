        "text": "The Museum of Modern Art announces Horror: Messaging the Monstrous, a 10-week film series that includes over 110 features and a selection of short films that capture the horror genre’s uncanny ability to express the lurking fears of a society and the anxieties caused by social, cultural, and political change. Presented in the Museum’s Titus Theaters in the Black Family Film Center from June 23 through September 5, 2022, Horror: Messaging the Monstrous is organized weekly by fluid themes that shaped how the works were conceived: Slasher, Horror of Place, the Undead, Creatures, Folk Tales, Women Make Horror, Body Horror, Eco Horror, Messaging Race, and Messaging Gender. The exhibition features films from 19 countries, including genre benchmarks from the United States, Europe, and Asia, starting with Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960) and spanning the 1970s into the 1990s; 21st-century films from emerging voices in Guatemala, Ireland, Iran, Laos, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, and Zambia; and a focused look at emerging independent women filmmakers making horror over the last decade. Horror: Messaging the Monstrous is organized by Ron Magliozzi, Curator, and Brittany Shaw, Curatorial Assistant, Department of Film, with Caryn Coleman, guest curator.\n\nThe exhibition opens with a 3D screening of George A. Romero’s horror classic Dawn of the Living Dead (1978). Other highlights include a screening of Night of the Living Dead (1968), which was restored in 2016 by MoMA and the Film Foundation, in MoMA’s Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden on July 27; the New York premiere of the new 40th anniversary restoration of The Thing (1982) on August 29; the New York City premiere of Garth Maxwell’s rarely seen masterwork Jack Be Nimble (1993) on July 12; and post screening discussions with Maxwell, Jeff Barnaby (Blood Quantum, Rhymes for Young Ghouls), Karen Arthur (The Mafu Cage), Stephanie Rothman (The Velvet Vampire), Douglas Buck (Family Portraits), and Mary Lambert (Pet Sematary).\n\n“Messaging the Monstrous proposes that horror, among the oldest forms of popular entertainment, has evolved to become the signature motion picture genre of the early 21st century,” said Ron Magliozzi, Curator, Department of Film. “A fertile network of cross pollinating sub-genres have coalesced to provide a diverse community of filmmakers and audiences with a compelling, at its best intellectually stimulating, mind-expanding fictional medium for dealing with real world issues of personal and global concern.”\n\nMuch like musicals and gangster films during the Depression of the 1930s, or science fiction amid the threat of McCarthyism and nuclear war in the 1950s, horror movies reflect\n\nthe major concerns of each generation and serve as a popular barometer of troubled times. The genre provides a cinematic language for unleashing uncertainty, distrust, uncomfortable laughter, anger, and nihilistic rage across such polarizing subjects as gender equality and female sexuality (Slumber Party Massacre, Ginger Snaps, Jennifer’s Body); the sanctity of the family (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Relic); sexual difference and alternative lifestyles (Hellraiser, Teeth, Jack Be Nimble); cultures of racism (Tales from the Hood, Blood Quantum, Get Out); the conflict of truth and belief (The Wicker Man, The Babadook); ecological crisis and responsibility (The Long Weekend, Unearth, Gaia); cultural disintegration (We Are What We Are, The Host, The Sadness); and governmental oppression (La Llorona, His House).\n\nThis series roster of directors includes foundational masters like George A. Romero, Wes Craven, Stephanie Rothman, Karen Arthur, John Carpenter, Clive Barker, Sam Rami, Rusty Cundieff, James Bond III, Mario Bava, Bob Clark, David Cronenberg, Tobe Hooper, and Frank Henenlotter; such representatives of the new generation refining 21st-century horror as Jennifer Kent, Jordan Peele, Karyn Kusama, Bong Joon-ho, Jeff Barnaby, Philip Ridley, Remi Weekes, Jorge Michel Grau, Julia Ducournau, Pascal Laugier, Alexandre Aja, Julien Maury, and Alexandre Bustillo; and fan-favorite stars like Karen Black, Carol Kane, Adrienne Barbeau, Marlene Clark, Duane Jones, Tony Todd, Bruce Campbell, and Anthony Perkins, whose indelible performances are touchstones of the genre.\n\nHorror Comes Home, a mini-program of Horror: Messaging the Monstrous, will be simultaneously co-presented on MoMA’s virtual cinema platform available to members. Horror Comes Home addresses the influence that horror films being available for home viewing has had on viewership, censorship, and the cultural psyche. The program includes 10 films classified on the infamous “Video Nasty” list created in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, when a moral panic stoked fear of mass access to home video proliferation. Now a badge of honor, these Video Nasties are emblematic of censorship and the fear of violence begetting more violence if viewed in private. The virtual component of Horror: Messaging the Monstrous will also include horror documentaries to provide context to the in-person series.\n\nA full screening schedule for Horror: Messaging the Monstrous and Horror Comes Home will be announced in the coming weeks on moma.org.
