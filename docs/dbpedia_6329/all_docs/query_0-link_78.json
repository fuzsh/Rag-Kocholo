        "text": "*Keep up with our ongoing end of the year coverage here*\n\nIf all the articles (the endless, unyielding articles…) about physical media’s imminent demise are true, why was this list nearly impossible to narrow down? It’s known that the grass is a little greener for horror fans when it comes to home video, and devotees tend to be a ravenous bunch: Even when we subscribe to multiple streaming services, a solid number of fright fans value having their own collections that can be accessed without worrying about bandwidth or rights issues, not to mention the sweet, sweet special features. Add to that, “boutique labels” that uncover older and obscure films and give them a renewed shine to new generations of audiences and weekly catalog and new releases that (usually) impress both give us continued hope that our collecting days may still have some years in them.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my picks for the best of the best, and it’s been a year packed with releases just throbbing with high-definition scares and bone-deep behind-the-scenes looks. While a lot of great horror movies from big studios skimped out on the extras⁠—I promise you, we still want commentaries!⁠—there are still some gems. That said, unsurprisingly, the smaller, genre-focused labels stole my heart and my wallet. They just wanted it more!\n\n(Please note that only region 1 or 0 discs were included to make this task remotely possible.)\n\nGodzilla: The Showa-era Films, 1954–1975 from The Criterion Collection\n\nGojira is no stranger to unfair fights, and The Criterion Collection mimicked that history when they decimated the competition by releasing 15 Showa-era Toho Godzilla films on Blu-ray in a giant set⁠ with eye-popping original art—with treasures including both the original Japanese and the English version of King Kong Versus Godzilla—in the kind of splashy, blockbuster release that thrills collectors and gets mainstream media attention, reminding everyone that building your own film library can be like the grown-up version of being a kid in a candy store. It’s a mixed bag of acknowledged classics and some entries only a huge fan of this colossal franchise could love, but this is both a wonderful primer to Godzilla’s world and an enormous valentine to existing fans, and the included essays add some much-appreciated historical and social context. This may be a bit of a chore to fit onto your shelves, but it’ll slide into your heart with no problem.\n\nDon’t Miss: The “Toho Unused Special Effects Complete Collection,” a 1986 hour-long Japanese-language special detailing how many special effects were pulled off throughout the series, along with lots of footage that never made the final films.\n\nCrimson Peak Limited Edition from Arrow Video\n\nAccording to many of his diehard fans, Guillermo del Toro’s 2015 sanguine-soaked love letter to gothic horror and romance is his most overlooked film to date. Arrow Video set out to right that wrong with its lush limited edition set, complete with an ornately illustrated box, a hardcover book in a slipcase filled with essays and pages of original conceptual design illustrations, a poster and postcards. If you missed out, however, the standard edition includes all the same goodies on the disc, including a feature-length making-of documentary and featurettes on pretty much every aspect of the film, along with more academic extras like a new video essay from Kat Ellinger. Whether you’re a new fan, one of the devoted, or anywhere in-between, this set is a beauty that perfectly conveys the film’s message that so much more lies beneath the surface.\n\nDon’t Miss: A commentary from Guillermo del Toro is a joy forever: His enthusiasm is matched only by his attention to detail and his willingness to share filmmaking tricks, behind the scenes facts and the multitude of influences on his work. For picks exclusive to this release, Ellinger’s video essay and an interview with writer Kim Newman provide a wealth of knowledge into this specific subgenre and also offer some great viewing recommendations.\n\nViy from Severin Films\n\nBased on the horror novella from famed Russian author Nikolai Gogol (as was Mario Bava’s Black Sunday, loosely), Viy is a gem from 1967 that should appeal to lovers of folk horror, dark fairytales, and innovative practical special effects. With both an original language and an English dubbed option, this is a wonderful way to explore older horror films or beef up your already impressive collection with a demonically atmospheric and beautiful tale. Important in cinematic history as the first full-length horror film produced in the Soviet Union, this gorgeous movie is too much of a fun, spooky ride to ever feel like homework. Including a spirited interview with fan and filmmaker Richard Stanley and a great half-hour feature on the history of Soviet sci-fi and fantasy films, both the film and the Blu-ray are a journey not to be missed.\n\nDon’t Miss: Three short silent Soviet horror films “The Portrait,” (1915) “The Queen of Spades/Pikovaya Dama,” (1916) and “Satan Exultant” (1917) are fascinating and atmospheric.\n\nThe Blob Collector’s Edition from Scream Factory\n\nSince its initial theatrical release, 1988’s The Blob has been labeled “underrated” by legions of gore-loving fans, but there’s just no way that claim can hold water any longer after this exhaustive release. The movie itself earns every bit of love: Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell wrote an incredibly fun tribute to classic drive-in monster movies that they infused with a 1980s splatterpunk twist. While it might be impossible to sate the Blob, there’s no way fans will leave this disc hungry: There are hours of in-depth interviews from director Chuck Russell, multiple actors, the cinematographer, the Blob mechanic (!), special effects, mechanical, and production designers, behind the scenes footage, and three freakin’ commentaries. This was pretty much an ideal horror remake, and the disc is, unquestionably, the ideal way to treat such a blast on disc; it may very well become the quintessential Scream Factory release.\n\nDon’t Miss: I watched every single interview, and I can honestly say they’re all energetic and detailed, as this was an early film for many of the creatives involved and everyone seemed to have a great time. That said, Bill Moseley’s interview that details his early career is charming and a must for Chop Top fans. When it comes to commentaries, they’re all interesting for different reasons, but the one with Russell, special effects artist Tony Gardner, and cinematographer Mark Irwin moderated by filmmaker, podcaster, and uber-fan Joe Lynch is the best bang for your buck when it comes to enthusiasm and on-set stories. The commentary with Ryan Turek and Russell is where to go for a more focused (but fun!) talk on the details of the filmmaking.\n\nThe New York Ripper from Blue Underground\n\nHow well does a notoriously sleazy and dirty giallo from legend Lucio Fulci fare in high definition? If this limited edition Blu-ray is anything to go by, we don’t have to worry about a thing when it comes to bringing cinematic smut into the 21st century. Not only is the 4K restoration from the original camera negative stunning, keeping the grit and grime of old-school New York City intact while giving us a crisp, clear picture of the film’s vibrant colors, but the extras here are also a huge upgrade from Blue Underground’s original release that only included the interview with actress Zora Kerova and the short “NYC Locations Then and Now” featurette. Now we have tons of interviews and a fresh new commentary, not to mention a booklet with an essay from Travis Crawford and a CD featuring the soundtrack from Francesco De Masi. Pair this with Blue Underground’s also exemplary 4K restoration of William Lustig’s Maniac and Arrow Video’s great Driller Killer release, and you’ll be as close to getting coated in the film of the dangerous days of 42nd Street as you can these days.\n\nDon’t Miss: Two titans of gialli research here: Author Troy Howarth provides a detailed commentary and writer Stephen Thrower gives a fascinating and informative interview packed with background details.\n\nOpera from Scorpion Releasing\n\nIn the past few years, Dario Argento has been the belle della palla when it comes to getting extensive Blu-ray releases of some of his most celebrated films, and Opera is no exception. Considered by many to be Argento’s last masterpiece (and one of my personal ultra-favorites of his), this is a three-disc odyssey into 1987’s rhapsodic bloodbath. Each disc contains a different cut of the film, each with a new 2K restoration: the 1.78:1 version, 2.35:1 version, and the US Orion Studios dubbed cut. There are commentaries for the first two cuts and tons of interviews adorn each disc, and while I know it’s hard for many of us to move on from the great old school Anchor Bay limited edition DVD set from long ago, this is truly a must for every fan of Opera and the discerning Argento completist. With gorgeous cover art from Yannick Bouchard, this edition instantly classes up any horror shelf.\n\nDon’t Miss: The almost one-hour-long interview with actor William McNamara is a treat as he’s very personable, and it’s both hilarious and informative hearing his stories about filming in Italy as an American actor. From tales of getting an audition with Quentin Tarantino due to this role in Opera to the very specific reason Vanessa Redgrave actually left the film, this is a fun, dishy talk fans shouldn’t skip. “It was always either pasta or a bank holiday with these guys!”\n\nWoman Chasing the Butterfly of Death from Mondo Macabro\n\n“It sucks, but I’ll keep on living.” 1978’s Woman Chasing the Butterfly of Death is outlandish by most standards, and until this lovingly wrapped gift of a release, it was also pretty freaking hard to get hold of. Now, however, this dreamlike skeleton-palooza complete with a beach party has a 4K transfer from the film negative, digital restoration, and a lot of wonderful new interviews from the South Korean creatives connected to the film, including a great one with actress and frequent collaborator with director Kim Ki-young, Lee Hwa-si. If Parasite whetted your appetite to get further into South Korean cinema, this film promises imagination, heart, weirdness, and some great haunting set pieces that are as colorful as any splashy Technicolor or giallo film from the same time period.\n\nDon’t Miss: An audio commentary from writers Kenneth Brorsson and Paul Quinn from the “What’s Korean Cinema?” podcast is informative and lively, but the two-part interview with prolific director and producer Jung Jin-woo, who worked frequently with Kim Ki-young, is living film history delivered with a lot of style and humor.\n\nUniversal Collection Volume 1 from Scream Factory\n\nOriginally slated to be distributed as a Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi set before the name was changed to a more series-inclusive title as more editions of catalog Universal horror titles are being rapidly released, the first set is still a tribute to the ghoulish grandfathers of cinematic horror. The Black Cat comes to us with three new commentaries, and new 2K scans of The Raven, The Invisible Ray, and Black Friday round out the set, each with at least one commentary. The black and white picture is inky and crisp on each, and it’s great to have a beautiful, compact set of so many genre touchstones in one place looking as good as they do and accompanied by plenty of reverence for their place in horror and film history at large.\n\nDon’t Miss: A superb four-part documentary, “A Good Game: Karloff and Lugosi at Universal,” is separated into one part per disc. It’s filled with fascinating information from experts and plenty of great behind-the-scenes photographs, and I was a little heartbroken that a similar kind of extra wasn’t included in the second Universal Horror set. On The Black Cat disc, there’s an illuminating hour-long documentary (narrated by Doug Bradley himself!) called “Dreams Within a Dream: The Classic Cinema of Edgar Allan Poe,” and I bet you can guess what it’s about. From silent films to the aftermath of the American International Pictures boom when the Italians started taking over the bulk of adaptations, it’s an overview worth your time.\n\nThere’s Nothing Out There! from Vinegar Syndrome\n\nWhile this micro-budget-comedy-sci-fi-horror flick might not be your cuppa (Full disclosure: It’s most definitely mine), there’s no denying the love that was heaped on to this release of the chaotic goofer made by very, very young filmmakers in 1991. There are four commentaries for the movie (a new one that includes Joe Lynch, two archival ones, and another from the podcast The Hysteria Continues!) and even one each for the trailer, the stills gallery, rehearsal footage… I could go on for a while. There are also short films from director/screenwriter Rolfe Kanefsky and new, in-depth interviews. If you already love the film, it’s a treasure trove, but if it never fully seduced you, the winning behind-the-scenes looks at very passionate people working with very little might just do the trick.\n\nDon’t Miss: Charlie Lyne’s short documentary feature “Copycat,” which is a fun “remix” kind of feature that was made a few years ago. It uses interview audio and tons of film clips to illustrate There’s Nothing Out There’s connection to Wes Craven’s Scream. Whether you believe that there’s a direct correlation between the films or a scant few distant points they both have in common, it’s incredibly well-done and entertaining.\n\nAlice, Sweet Alice Limited Edition from Arrow Video\n\nArrow came through yet again with a superb restoration from the original 35mm camera negative for this beloved 1976 slasher. With new interviews, a location tour with Michael Gingold, two commentaries, and the Holy Terror re-release cut of the film, this benchmark of the genre will leave even the most devout satisfied.\n\nDon’t Miss: Both the archival commentary with director and co-writer Alfred Sole, editor Edward Salier and William Lustig (who worked as assistant makeup special effects on the film!) and the new commentary from author Richard Harland Smith are terrific, and they both cover a lot of different ground.\n\nThe Very, Very Honorable Runners-Up\n\nBLOODY TERROR: The Shocking Cinema of Norman J Warren, 1976-1987 from Indicator, The Hemisphere Box of Horrors from Severin Films, The Omen Collection from Scream Factory, An American Werewolf in London from Arrow Video, Paganini Horror from Severin Films, The Ring Collection from Arrow Video, The Prey from Arrow Video, The Devil Rides Out from Shout! Factory, The Killer of Dolls from Mondo Macabro, Quatermass And The Pit from Shout Factory, Us from Universal Studios, Grandma’s House and Nightbeast from Vinegar Syndrome, All the Colors of the Dark/All the Colors of Giallo limited set from Severin Films, The Body Snatchers from Shout Factory, Alien 4k: 40th Anniversary Edition from 20th Century Fox, and 1979’s Dracula from Shout Factory.\n\nBemoaning how Hollywood treats its franchises these days is quite the cliche. So much so that it’s become a favorite pastime for movie geeks all over the world. It’s even more “basic” to spill ink about the nostalgia treadmill that no studio exec can resist jumping on with a glee usually reserved for kids in candy stores. Specifically, they seem to have an aversion towards moving forward and sowing new ideas on grounds fans deem oh-so sacred. And yet, here we are on the precipice of yet another vaunted horror franchise reaching into the past to chart its creative future.\n\nNeve Campbell’s recent comments about Scream’s seventh installment compared it to Halloween’s 2018 recipe. The irony is David Gordon Green’s film owes a debt to Halloween H2O. To say nothing of Scream 4, which already riffed on the idea of an older Sidney Prescott facing off with not only another deranged teenager in a Ghostface mask but also her survivor’s guilt and complicated feelings about her hometown. Notice a theme?\n\nHorror is overflowing with original ideas and stories; this isn’t about the genre. But there’s something to say about the fact legacy films can’t quit examining, well, their legacies. A longing for the “good old” days and fears of upsetting even moderately vocal fanbases created a cul-de-sac for franchise horror with no way out in sight.\n\nBefore going any further, this isn’t some new creatively bankrupt phenomenon. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween famously tried that whole evolution thing in the 1980s. While connoisseurs appreciate those deviations now, those wild swings didn’t generate the necessary box office or fan response at the time. The Halloween franchise felt the sting so hard that they ensured everyone knew the fourth installment featured Michael Myers. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was comfort food for those who found Halloween III: Season of the Witch a little hard to digest. But only to a point. While Halloween 4 looked like a series going back to basics for most of its runtime, it did something very different in its final minutes that telegraphed a unique direction going forward. And yet, that moment gets explained away and rendered moot by the time Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers arrives one year later.\n\nThe creative urge for something new constantly clashes with the business need for something that prints money. The dollars and cents worshipers at the top of the industry often believe that taking the most minor creative risks makes the most sense because it leads to more dollars.\n\nThat’s why Nancy and her dad couldn’t escape Elm St. Or why Michael rarely stopped chasing his relatives. Or even the improbability that the Brody’s couldn’t escape Great White Sharks even while vacationing in the Bahamas. As the calendar turned and fandoms grew more significant, the demand for that type of thing only got louder. To quote one of the great fictional philosophers of our imaginary time, Philip J. Fry, “Clever things make people feel stupid and unexpected things make them feel scared!” Futurama’s insight is a bit harsh, but there’s still some truth buried in the satire.\n\nIn some cases, shifting to tried and true formulas is somewhat understandable. While they’re tacit admissions that sometimes the best idea is the first one, they’re also, at times, necessary business decisions. John Carpenter never envisioned Halloween as more than one movie. The same goes for Wes Craven and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Dollars to donuts, that’s probably the same story for most films that morph into the two words familiar to most people reading this website: intellectual property. That distinction comes with responsibilities to shareholders and CEOs and, no pun intended, the lifeblood of some companies. Ghostface is no longer just a person in a Spirit Halloween robe and a cheap dime store mask; Scream’s chief killer is a brand.\n\nWhat was once taboo is now a t-shirt at almost any department store. There are Ghostface Funko Pops, ceramic mugs, backpacks, and even a hockey jersey for the little ones. Let’s keep it real: Scream and other franchises of its ilk have more in common today with McDonald’s or Burger King than the original horror flicks studios produce. That’s not an inherently bad thing, but it is a thing; viewing these properties through that prism makes the math add up. That’s why Jamie Lee Curtis found herself at the center of not one, but two Halloween “reboots” twenty years apart from one another. The movies about the psycho wearing the William Shatner mask established their formula in ’78, so no matter what, they always revert to something from that time period. Even the proposed Halloween TV series is a “creative reset” returning to… ’78.\n\nStaying trapped in the familiar is on the con side of the ledger when horror becomes more significant than just a simple movie. Easily discernible why? Sure. But can it also mean preaching to the same choir from one installment to the next? Also yeah.\n\nFede Alvarez embraced yesteryear with Alien: Romulus, but he believes he did so without alienating (pun very much intended) a new audience. “You never want an audience to go see a movie and furrow their brow thinking, ‘Who is this person?’ Why is half the cinema so excited about this man and I don’t know who he is?” said Alvarez in a recent interview. “It becomes an excess I’m not interested in.”\n\nHow one feels about the excesses of which he showed great interest in Romulus aside, his overall point rings true. Rooting franchises in their glory days means not making them relevant for today. Everyone involved becomes so focused on paying homage to the past or dealing with older characters that they don’t justify the present or chart a future. That’s precisely where Scream finds itself right now. There’s a lot to how the seventh entry arrived at this point. So much so that there isn’t enough ink to cover it all here. What matters now is the beloved series moving away from a story that attracted old fans and created new ones in favor of playing the hits. Given the circumstances, the creative team behind the next Scream didn’t simply break glass in case of emergency so much as they shattered it by throwing a 100 mph fastball in the form of the Sidney Prescott solution.\n\nFor several reasons, some that look incredibly cynical, Scream can’t escape the vicious cycle even though it charted new waters.\n\nWe had a new core cast. The Grim Reaper finally collected on Dewey Riley’s long-term debt. Sidney was out of the picture, and who knows how many more attempts on her life Gale Weathers could weather. Scream and Scream VI reflected on their legacy without bathing in it. The movies looked fresh through the eyes of new characters rather than being slavish to Generation X and Millennials. Scream 4’s original ending almost pulled off this same high-wire act in 2011 until it didn’t. Some people behind the scenes got cold feet in the 9th inning for whatever reason. Writer Kevin Williamson’s bold move went bye-bye in favor of the status quo. Almost 15 years later, the Scream franchise still suffers from chili digits. Sadly, it’s not the only one.\n\nFor a genre built on punk rock sensibilities, there’s far too much conformity and timidness at the top of the food chain. Cul-de-sacs keep us in comfortable places by design, but horror isn’t about comfort. It never was. The second these prominent properties remember that is the reason Target happily sells t-shirts to children with masked killers etched on the front, we might finally get off this road to nowhere."
