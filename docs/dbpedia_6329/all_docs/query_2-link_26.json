        "text": "As with many memorable stories, “Viy”by influential Ukrainian-Russian author Nikolai Gogol, originally published as part of his 1835 collection Mirgorod, begins with an outright fabrication: “The Viy is a monstrous creation of popular fancy. It is the name which the inhabitants of Little Russia give to the king of the gnomes…The following story is a specimen of such folk-lore. I have made no alterations, but reproduce it in the same simple form in which I heard it.” One-hundred-and-eighty odd years of thorough scholarship can find absolutely no references to the Viy before Gogol’s story, indicating that it is something that he invented himself (this is not unlike the false claims of being based on legends that I saw in the opening of Caltiki.) Regardless of the veracity of Gogol’s inspiration, “Viy” feels like something that could be real folklore—a story of mysterious countrysides and the dark magic lurking just beyond, and while at first it seems based in a religious good-vs-evil struggle, there’s an arbitrariness and cruelty (and dark humour) to its morality that is something else entirely.\n\nThe story starts out on a fairly light note, describing the behaviours of the different factions found within a seminary school in Kiev: the grammarians, the rhetoricians, the philosophers, and the theologians—we learn that those deep in religious study are not without their quirks. Although we begin with a group that contains students of multiple groups, the central figure is the philosopher Khoma (or Thomas) Brutus, an easy-going sort who loves his pipe and, when receiving thrashings for indiscretions, he “[endured them] with complete philosophic calm, saying that a man cannot escape his destiny.” The rest of the story becomes about testing that worldview—a journey through the countryside during summer vacation ends with a stay at a lone barn, where an old woman approaches him in the middle of the night, jumps on his back, and forces him to gallop like a horse. He quickly realizes that she is a witch, and after finally throwing her off, he beats her to a pulp and then is horrified when she turns into a beautiful young woman. After fleeing back to the monastery, Khoma is informed that he has been specifically requested to say prayers over the dead body of the daughter of a wealthy Cossack colonel for three nights, something that he immediately has a bad feeling about. As he should!\n\nDespite the rewards promised for fulfilling his task—and the threats of violence for not doing it—Khoma frequently tries to escape this job, but finding it impossible, he hunkers down at night to read from his prayer book next to the daughter’s coffin, placed in a small church on the colonel’s land. As you could probably guess, the daughter is in fact the witch whose death Khoma had caused, and her requesting his presence was part of a revenge ploy—during the night, the girl rises from the dead and attempts to approach him (or flies around in her coffin), only being stopped by a sacred circle he draws around himself. Each night is even more frightening than the last, taking a toll on Khoma’s sanity (and causing his hair to go gray), and on the third and final vigil, the girl calls for the assistant of numerous “earth-spirits”, including their notorious leader Viy, an “ungainly human figure” that is “covered with black soil”, with an “iron face” and distended eyelids that droop to the floor and must be lifted so he can see. Despite the initial promise of protection his circle brings, things don’t go well for Khoma when the Viy shows up.\n\nIt was the little details that stood out to me in this story: while most of the conversations with the social-drinking Cossacks is there to provide some levity before the supernatural shenanigans begin (a good sentence: “After giving this satisfactory answer, the Cossack considered himself entitled to remain silent for whole of the rest of the journey”), other details are more darkly humorous, such as the way the rector of the monastery sells Khoma out for some peeled barley, eggs, and the possibility of sturgeon (apparently because the fish sold in their town market are bad.) The character of the girl’s father is interesting in that his grief and his desire to bring to peace and salvation to his daughter’s soul seems genuine, and he is apparently unaware of her witchy activities (but still fairly violent when he doesn’t get his way, or when Khoma tries to tell him about her dual life)—meanwhile, the rest of the Cossacks share stories of some of things she got up to in their village, such as riding around on a local hunter and causing him to wither away, or sucking the blood of an infant (the former story really reinforces a perverse sexual reading of the story, because unlike Khoma, the hunter asked to have her ride him.) There’s a bit of a class divide there, where the working types have to live with the problems caused by their employer’s obliviousness to his own family. The demonic presence (whose designation as earth-spirits, highlighted by the image of them covered in soil, seems to place them as old, vaguely Pagan figures) is gradually brought into the story, with Khoma at first only hearing them as they scratched at the windows of the church and rumbled beneath the floorboards—and after ending Khoma’s life, they fail to respond to the call of the rooster in time, becoming embedded into the church itself as they try to escape, (“they all remained hanging as though fastened to the door and windows”), and the whole building is abandoned and left to be reclaimed by nature. In an interesting turn, the monsters end up punished by the universe just like Khoma was.\n\nIf there’s any real moral to the story, it’s a rather harsh one—for all his faults, Khoma’s fate is not really determined by a personal fault, but by momentary weakness. Had he simply remained within his circle and not looked at the Viy, the demons would not have “seen” him and beeen able to attack. Khoma’s chum Khalava laments that while “God had appointed it so”, he felt that Khoma “lost his life for nothing.” To the reader, that would seem accurate. The ending of the story has Khoma’s other friend Gorobetz speculate that it was his fear that caused his death: “If he had not feared her, the witch could have done nothing to him”, which he knows because “all the old women in the market-place are witches.” It is possible that in giving into his fear, it showed that Khoma’s faith in God’s protection was not strong enough, allowing Viy and his demon hordes to slip in—it might also be a side effect of his guilt (he does seem concerned when the colonel swears retribution against the one who caused his daughter’s death), although you’d wonder why someone would feel guilty for accidentally killing someone who (allegedly) drinks the blood of infants. Even taking all that into consideration, his punishment seems disproportionate, but in Gogol’s cynical, borderline prankish universe, I guess that’s just the way of things.\n\nA fairly faithful film adaptation of Viy was produced in the Soviet Union in 1967 (apparently it’s considered the first real horror film released in the USSR) directed by Konstantin Yershov and Georgi Kropachyov, using the movie’s visuals to emphasize a dream-like unreality. That begins early on with some exaggerated scenes that emphasize the comedic aspects—the early scene of the seminary school students all running off at the commencement of summer vacation is high-speed chaos, and the moments of Khoma heavily drinking and carousing at the inn with the colonel’s men is full of silly performances and sight gags. By seeing them on film, it feels like some of the finer details become more pronounced—the self-serving nature of the rector and the landowner’s intense emotions, for example, and obviously Khoma’s increasingly damaged state after each night of prayers. Interestingly, the way the actor plays it, Khoma’s final bad decision to look at Viy seems more like him jumping the gun, thinking he has gotten through it, rather than fear (which could be more damning or more cruel, depending on how you look at it)—and in the ending, the conversation between his two friends includes one skeptical that Khoma is dead at all. Reality may be even more ambiguous in this version.\n\nThis is the type of movie that feels like it should only be done with the stagey, simple special effects of the time (provided in part by one of the writers, Aleksandr Ptsushko, a prominent Soviet filmmaker whose fantasy films were sometimes dubbed into English with titles like The Day The Earth Froze and ended up on Mystery Science Theatre 3000)—it is much more charming this way, and you get interesting moments like the proto-Sam Raimi scene where the camera spins around Khoma as the witch tries to get into his sacred circle. The church itself is this disturbing set of mouldy grey, walls covered in paintings of angry saints looking down accusingly. Then, of course, there are the demons themselves, who as before only show up at the very end of the story, but make quite an impression here. Shown to literally come out of the woodwork, the make-up and costumes are great, showcasing a wide variety of imaginative designs, a genuine nightmare menagerie that reminds me a lot of the make-up effects in the Yōkai Monsters movies. They all show a high level of deference to the Viy, a cobweb-encrusted lump of a thing whose stubby arms seem to exist solely to point at people—if what you want is memorably bizarre depictions of supernatural creatures, you’ll find that here!\n\nJust on a level of faithfully representing the more evocative imagery of the story, the film version of Viy is worthwhile—it lacks some of the finer narrative details that Gogol doled out in prose, but the vibes come across in any case. There is a sense that Gogol wanted something maybe a bit ambiguous than a simple exorcism—these demons are much craftier, or at least more able to take swift advantage of someone’s slightly imperfect faith. Even so, both the men and demons in this story are bound by very stern rules, and following those rules may be much more difficult than they think—the universe isn’t pure chaos, but that doesn’t mean that it’s fair."
