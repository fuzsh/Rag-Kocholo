        "text": "Lake Mungo was shit. I don't remember enough about it to offer my reasoning. It was recommended on another message board I follow that's populated by people who think of themselves as having impeccable taste, and I was really disappointed in it.\n\nAlice Sweet Alice is fantastic.\n\nSee No Evil (1971, Mia Farrow) is great and is coming out on blu ray soon.\n\nLet's Scare Jessica To Death is extremely well made and creepy.\n\nBrian De Palma's Sisters (1973) is crazy, and also exceptionally well done, and although it's recently gotten the high-definition treatment and streaming services distribution that it deserves, it hasn't really gotten the recognition it ought to get from horror/suspense fans.\n\nOP, your suggestion looks like one of those ubiquitous, shitty, newfangled Netflix horror movies that no one would ever have heard of if it weren't for Netflix—a straight to video affair. I refuse to even consider it. Been burned too many times by those.\n\nNewer thrillers are bound to disappoint because the people writing, directing, and editing them do not have the sophistication of filmmakers from previous decades, especially the 70s. I know I sound like an old fuddy duddy saying that, but it's true. There are a couple exceptions—House Of The Devil is one. The Innkeepers, that director's followup, is terrible. I always bristle when I see them mentioned as a pair, as if they're equals. I was also disappointed by The Babadook, Paranormal Activity, The Strangers (yeesh, what an ugly movie with no payoff or explanation for what transpired), and The Invitation.\n\n[quote]The Possession Of Michael King. It's about a documentary filmmaker who tries to disprove possession by going to different satanists and witches etc. and asked and then for spells and incantations to get possessed.\n\nSeconding this recommendation. The movie has one of the creepiest scenes I can think of in recent years: when the now-possessed Michael King passes by a mirror, the demon stops and gazes for a while, as if in wonder at seeing itself in a corporeal form...and then ever-so-slowly smiles. It sent chills down my very-difficult-to-chill spine.\n\nI really enjoyed a film called Starry Eyes (2014) - it's filmed in black and white, and in the early going seems to be a satire of the typical Hollywood wannabe's experience - grinding away as a waitress, surrounded by other vapid wannabes, going on endless auditions with no luck. But then our would-be starlet catches the eye of a mysterious production company, which promises her stardom if she'll jump through some VERY disturbing hoops. A really unusual horror film with a great performance by its lead actress.\n\nAnother pair of recommendations I've made her on DL before, but will do so again...Delivery (2013, aka Delivery: The Beast Within) is about a couple whose pregnancy is being documented for a TLC-type reality show. Let's put it this way: something ain't right with that baby. There are a number of horror films with this basic premise, but this one stood out for me - It just has a genuinely unnerving atmosphere once it gets going, and I loved that it WENT THERE in the end (you'll know what I mean if you see it). Also, The Conspiracy (2012) is about a pair of documentary filmmakers who are trying to make a film about a local streetcorner conspiracy nut...which leads to them going undercover at Bohemian Grove. It is disturbing as fuck, and the last few minutes creeped me out for days afterward. It's really intelligently made, and will make you wonder about all sorts of things.\n\n[R78], I like your taste. I'm watching Starry Eyes right now. Got any more recs, horror or non-horror?\n\nGot all day? ;)\n\nContracted (2013) - Has a similar premise to It Follows, but I feel it's a stronger film, with a MUCH better lead actress. A great, ascending feeling of dread throughout.\n\nChariot (2013) - A group of strangers wake up on an airplane in mid-flight - and none of them know how they wound up there. No contact from the cockpit, no way to contact the outside world except for a rapidly dwindling smartphone. The US is under attack - or is it? This had great suspense, and kept me guessing till the end.\n\nEstranged (2015) - A young woman is forced to move back home after a devastating motorcycle accident that has not only robbed her of her mobility but also a good deal of her long-term memory. She apparently hadn't talked to her family in years - why? Are they sincere about wanting to heal the apparent breach, or is something more sinister going on?\n\nThe Atticus Institute (2015) - A government experiment to find people with genuine psychic abilities like ESP receives a promising subject in the form of a troubled woman named Judith. She displays powerful psychic abilities in every area, but is she really psychic, or is it something else?\n\nLovely Molly (2011) - I think I might be the only person who hated The Blair Witch Project but has loved most everything Eduardo Sanchez has done since. This has a fantastically eerie atmosphere, oozing with dread, and is truly disturbing at times. A young woman with a troubled past moves back into her father's house with her new husband, determined to build a new life, but it soon because clear that The Past - if that's what you want to call it - simply won't let her be.\n\nThe Cave (2005) - An unusual vampire film set in the Carpathian Mountains. A group of archaeologists exploring a 13th century abbey discover an underground river in the cave system beneath the ruins, and set off to explore. Hint: they should have paid attention to those murals of Knights Templar fighting winged creatures with fangs up above...\n\nWillow Creek (2013) - I'm not really all that into Bigfoot movies, but I liked this one, A young couple set out on a trip to see if they can document the legendary creature, and well...these things don't usually work out, do they? It's worth watching if only for a twenty-minute sequence of the pair in their tent in the middle of the night, listening and listening...and hearing. Gulp.\n\nAbsentia (2011) - A woman whose husband disappeared seven years earlier is in the process of having him declared legally dead, and her younger sister, a recovering junkie, comes to live with her as she tries to move on to the next phase of her life. Unfortunately, it begins to seem as if a tunnel at the end of their street might be more than just a tunnel, and maybe her husband's not so disappeared after all.\n\nAlien Abduction (2014) - A family goes on a camping vacation with their autistic son, who uses his video camera like a security blanket, filming EVERYTHING. On their first night, they see unexplained lights in the sky, and...it's all downhill from there. Has one of the creepiest sequences I can think of in recent horror films, in which the family, driving on an isolated backwoods road, come upon a trail of abandoned vehicles - doors open, lights on, contents still present...and follow it to a huge tunnel where they get up close and personal with shit you don't want to get up close with. Brilliant sequence.\n\nOutcast (2010) - An Irish traveler woman and her teenage son are on the run, hiding out from apparent bounty hunters, who are determined to kill the boy. It soon becomes apparent that Mom is no ordinary woman but something supernatural, and she's broken with her powerful clan to protect her son...why? Really cool updating of ancient Celtic lore. Several actors from GOT, for fans of that show.\n\nBTW, I just went and watched a clip from Starry Eyes, which I saw some time ago - why in the world did I remember it as being in black and white? Maybe part of it is in B&W?\n\nI'm racking my brain trying to think of the name of a Spanish language film that was quasi-horror -- it might have been Latin American rather than Spanish. Maybe someone can help.\n\nTo be honest I don't remember much about the plot but definitely remember how it made me feel.\n\nIt's about an affluent family who own a large house in a rural area and the father and the family has to go away for a while. But for some reason the father has to return to the house before planned and when he does he discovers something's been stolen from the house by the locals. They find out that he found out and they kill him. There's also a very creepy scene at the end in the kitchen, where the shadow of a demon is seen creeping through the deserted room.\n\nThere's also this weird ecstatic scene in the beginning with the family running through the woods at night (I think) perhaps looking for a lost child?\n\nSorry I'm sure that all sounds insane!"
