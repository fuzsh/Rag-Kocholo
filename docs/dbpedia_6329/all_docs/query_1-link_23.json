        "text": "It makes no sense but it compels me so!\n\nKnives Out is a playful progressive ride that's less about taxing your mind and more about celebrating our fascination with whodunits in 2019 amidst the American fascist-friendly political climate.\n\nIt's more about the white privilege, racism, and progressive charade much like Jordan Peele's Get Out that was squarely focused on white liberals hiding their racist levels. Ana de Armas' character Marta is at the center of this rich white family's inheritance squabbles among all the \"self-made overachievers\". She's fun to watch with the most emotional range to show, from anxiety and sadness to bravery and poker-face, as she navigates the mystery while avoiding to puke if she ever lies or facing the microaggressive running gag where people can't pin the country where she's from (Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay). There's a puking climax that is sure to be a big laugh getter. Jaeden Martell's Jacob is a dapper neo-nazi teen who's very much a reflection of the current political climate with his online racist trolling and harassment, although was hoping there was more to analysing and criticising his character like the others get. Michael Shannon's Walt might say he wants to financially care for Marta and her family, but again if he's left out of the money, the harassment and threats commence. Toni Collette's Joni might mention that she cares about children being put in detention camps by Trump's administration or Katherine Langford's Meg might apologise for her family's racism, but when it comes down to money their charade is ultimately just that.\n\nThere is fun in remembering the details of the events and how the different characters' versions of the events differ but it's not necessary when Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc steps out of the shadows as this drawly super detective who's willing to walk you through the lies and piece together the narrative jigsaw. Or at least cover up the donut hole (inside the donut hole). His amusing character through Daniel's hammy performance (second time he's having fun with a Southern character since Logan Lucky) is where the film is most self-aware what we desire from whodunits. It's not about attempting to be realistic, this is no \"CSI KFC\" which means the more duty-bound realistic Lakeith Stanfield's Lt Elliott has to get sidelined. He reminds of the odd language of Rian Johnson's debut film Brick, also being a mystery film but was more a noir homage while this is a whodunit homage (references to Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, Poirot, and more abound). All the characters are having a whale of a time in being caricatures but it also removes any strong emotions from the proceedings, which is fine as there's still tonal consistency.\n\nSpecial mentions go to Jenny Eagan's exquisite costume design (lots of sweaters), David Crank's eye-popping production design (a wall of knives being the visual motif), Bob Ducsay's editing, and Steve Yedlin's punchy cinematography. The strong ensemble cast plays to their strengths thanks to Rian Johnson's whip-smart writing and confident direction. Surprisingly, this is his most family-friendly film so they should go to the cinema together to watch it while having that political relevancy to take away so there's something more than just the shenanigan escapism. Saw it with mine and they really enjoyed it too.\n\nI watched those at the end of November, but didn't take the time to post about them, so here goes.\n\nFrozen 2 (2019): I quite enjoyed the first one, and I'm a sucker for animated movies, so it's very naturally that I went to see this (and convinced friends do so as well). It was endearing, fun, lovely, it didn't bore me once, and despite the plot being rather weak and vanilla, it still ended up being a lovely story about self-love and self-discovery. The aesthetics, as usual were stunning, as someone who appreciates and enjoys animation and 3D, this was stellar to look at. The songs were great (one of them was literally made for adults as children won't get what it's referencing to, and it was a bit of a genius move there), although nothing as iconic as Let It Go thus far. Overall, it was a pretty good moment, and very fluffy, although one that won't last with me for a long time. Still wish I could bring my nieces and nephews to watch it though.\n\n6/10\n\nBajirao Mastani (2015): I hadn't dabbled much into Bollywood territories before. If at all, even. I came across a clip of one of the musical bit of this movie, and decided, right away, to just watch it. I am incredibly happy I did so. Bajirao Mastani is an epic tale, a great historical drama, an incredible & tragic love story, an aesthetic wild ride, and a perfection of composition, lighting and directing. It is purely and simply visually breathtaking, I would often pause and look at some scenes and be immersed in their visual richness, in the mastery of colors and lights, the set design, the costumes. This movie oozes care and love for cinema as a visual art, and a huge chunk of those shots would blow me away for how much they would remind me of classical paintings. It is just fucking beautiful, is what it is, there's just no denying it. The story itself was enthralling as well, despite the romance part going from 0 to 100 in a way I didn't quite relate to at the beginning. However, the talent, charisma and chemistry of the three main characters played by Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh & Priyanka Chopra, were absolutely felt, palpable and all three fleshed their characters out in all their humanity, flaws and strengths. The story is quite the tragic one, as it depicts the intense but full-of-obstacles love between an Indian General (Bajirao, played by Ranveer Singh) and a Princess of Muslim descent (Mastani, played by Deepika Padukone). The story itself is inspired from an actual poem about their love and life story, and it is quite the tragic one. Of course, we have some of the typical Bollywood gimmicks here and there, like slow motion being used for overtly dramatic effect, but it never crosses the line nor becomes ridiculous, it never breaks the charm of the movie overall, it actually fits it all, since everything about this movie is grandiose, epic and magnificent. This was the first time I ever watched a movie from Sanjay Leela Bhansali, and it instantly made me wanna watch more of them, right away.\n\nAs a final part, here is the musical clip that initially triggered my interest in the movie to begin with:\n\nIf it does absolutely nothing to you, nor makes you a little bit curious, I don't know what would.\n\n8/10\n\nRam-Leela (2013): As I said, Bajirao Mastani made me wanna watch more movies from Bhansali right away, so I did. This one is also starring Deepika Padukone & Ranveer Singh, and their chemistry, is again, at an all-time high. Legend says this is the movie set on which they met each-other and fell in love with each-other, and they are now married. On the subject of the movie, Ram-Leela is a modern-day Indian take on the good old Shakespearean Romeo & Juliet tale. Both protagonists, Ram & Leela, are the son & daughter of two rivaling shady mafia-esque powerful families, and things... do not end well for either of them, as you would expect from any Romeo & Juliet adaptation. The movie is intense, in everything it does. And I vibed with it all. The characters are intense, their love is intense, the colors are intense, everything is vibrant and brimming with life and love. Singh and Padukone gets to play characters that go through a wide range of emotions and growth, at first they're both care-free lovebirds, fun, frivolous and flirtatious, but as you see their families rivalry descend into more and more violence, their characters became slowly but surely entrapped in the expectations and roles their families push onto them relentlessly, which ultimately leaves the both of them incredibly unhappy and will be their demise. Visually, it was quite the treat, as it seems to be the norm with Bhansali's cinema, and I definitely enjoyed all the aesthetics that were served to me (which were absolutely flawless, of course), leaving me wanting even more. It's a beautiful and intense movie, and while the rhythm might suffer a bit here and there, and the drama was a bit too intense at times, it definitely absolutely is worth the watch, and I recommend it greatly.\n\n7/10\n\nPadmaavat (2018): It's a Bhansali movie, with, again, Deepika Padukone & Ranveer Singh as main leads. Honestly at this point, why change a winning team, right? Except, this time, unlike for Ram-Leela & Bajirao Mastani, they're not THE couple here. And Ranveer Singh plays... well the main antagonist of the movie. It's a first, after having seen him skillfully play a flamboyant playboy (Ram Leela) and a devoted-in-love army general (Bajirao Mastani), this time, it goes a step further, he plays the role of an entitled twisted Muslim general (Alauddin) whose sole purpose in this movie, is to finally meet and see the queen Padmavati (played by Deepika Padukone), who has been acclaimed and revered for her beauty all across the land. Problem is, Padmavati is married to the Indian King Ratan Singh (played by Shahid Kapoor). And neither are remotely interested nor willing to let Alauddin come anywhere close to their kingdom, much less close to Padmavati herself. The story is inspired by Indian history, and is quite important to Indian culture, and Queen Padmavati is universally loved by Indian people for the way she handled this conflict and conducted herself until the very end, which was, you guessed it, extremely tragic. It's an epic tale of politics, love, misplaced entitlement and unhealthy obsession. Ranveer Singh particularly shines in this with how much he brings to the table as the character of Alauddin, crazy and obsessed, willing to create any wars, and to go to any lengths, in order to get what he thinks should be his. Deepika is stunning as well, and tries her best to bring to life a romance that we seldom get invested in, partly because of the way it's been written, but also partly because Shahid Kapoor is, sadly, not as charismatic and compelling as I'd liked him to be. Regardless, you still get invested in those characters enough, despite lacking much of the emotional depths that were displayed in Bajirao Mastani. Aesthetically speaking, Padmaavat is legitimately the most expansive Bollywood movie that has ever been made. And it fucking shows. It is a festival of luxurious set designs, of amazing compositions, lighting, and colors being used in the most visually pleasing ways possible. It is an explosion of visual mastery and one hell of a visual treat, much like Bajirao Mastani & Ram-Leela were. It definitely surpasses Ram-Leela easily, and it probably even surpasses Bajirao Mastani, honestly, even though I'll still forever have a softer spot for the latter anyway. Everything is carefully right where it should be, every color is being used in precise ways, costumes are amazing and intricate, and all of that adds even more to the feeling of epicness of the movie, as it was also the case for Bajirao Mastani.\n\nOverall, it was a great movie that still suffered from the lack of depths of their characters, as well as from the rhythm. It still blew my mind visually, but I found myself being a bit less enthralled about it. The character of Padmavati was a bit too conventional, and the ending was a bit controversial to me as well, as I didn't feel very comfortable about the obvious glorification of her act. Regardless, I enjoyed this movie enough to recommend it to anyone who's willing to give Bollywood movies a chance like I just did, because they absolutely should. I definitely will watch more movies from Bhansali, and keep an eye on him and his production in the future, that's a given.\n\n7/10"
