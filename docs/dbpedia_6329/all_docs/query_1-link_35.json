Perhaps it is precisely for this reason that I never in my life sold anyone out or betrayed them. Although of course I managed to perpetrate umpteen little dirty tricks and peccadillos.\n\nYuz Aleshkovsky, “Autobiographical Information”\n\nY\n\nuz Aleshkovsky was born in Siberia in 1929, the year of Stalin’s “Great Turn” toward industrialization and collectivization. Raised in Moscow, where he recalls that he became acquainted with street obscenities much earlier than he learned about the fairy tales most children read, he endured some of the key experiences of the Soviet century—wartime evacuation,\n\nx\\\n\nIntroduction\n\nimprisonment in Siberia (on a petty criminal charge), liberation upon the mass amnesties that followed Stalin’s death in 1953, and the ideological totalitarianism that forced some of Russia’s best literary talents into writing “for the desk drawer,” i.e., with no hope of publication.1 The paradox of the unfreedom of official literary life in the Soviet Union is that it engendered literature of a breathtaking freedom of form and language, of which Aleshkovsky’s works are a prime example. By 1979, Aleshkovsky realized that his personal freedom was in peril, and he and his wife, Irina, left the Soviet Union. In the same year, Priscilla Meyer, a scholar of Soviet-era Russian literature and professor of Russian at Wesleyan University, invited them to settle in Middletown, Connecticut, where Aleshkovsky has been a precious literary and cultural resource for students and faculty of Wesleyan University ever since, and where his wife Irina is a beloved professor of Russian language and film. Aleshkovsky received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fiction in 1987 and the Pushkin Prize of the Alfred Toepfer Foundation in 2001 for his entire body of work. Two of his novels and one novella have been published in English: Kangaroo (1986), a tragicomedy narrated by a man accused of “the vicious rape and murder of an aged kangaroo in the Moscow Zoo on a night between July 14, 1789, and January 9, 1905”; The Hand; or, The Confession of an Executioner (1989), the monologue of a vengeful Soviet security police agent, which Oliver Ready has called “a 300-page outburst of bile, traumatic recollection, and historical speculation”; and A Ring in a Case (1995), a fantastic tale that captures the absurdity of the early post-Soviet period.2 This volume is the first published English translation of Nikolai Nikolaevich, Aleshkovsky’s debut work of prose, as well as Camouflage (Maskirovka). The original Russian texts of both works appeared first in print in a single\n\nvolume published by Ardis in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1980, after Aleshkovsky had left the Soviet Union for the West.3 Nikolai Nikolaevich (written in 1970) and Camouflage (written in 1977) focus on two historical eras: the immediate postwar years just before and after Stalin’s death (Nikolai Nikolaevich) and the Brezhnev era, later labeled by Mikhail Gorbachev “the period of stagnation” (Camouflage). The “science fiction” novel Nikolai Nikolaevich is a monologue spoken to a drinking companion by the titular hero. A pickpocket by trade, Nikolai Nikolaevich is released from prison after World War II and finds a job in a Moscow biological laboratory. He begins as a kind of janitor but is soon recruited to provide sperm for strange experiments intended to create life in the Andromeda galaxy. The uneducated but preternaturally perceptive hero eventually finds himself at the center of the 1948 purge of biological science in the Soviet Union. The novel is not just a science fiction (and science fact) tale, but also a Bildungsroman and a love story. Nikolai Nikolaevich was first circulated as samizdat (“self-publishing,” usually typescripts with multiple carbon copies passed from hand to hand among trusted friends). Aleshkovsky says that copies of it, as well as his songs, the most famous of which is popularly known as “Comrade Stalin” (1959), “spread through Russia like a pandemic of flu.” He gave a copy of the manuscript to Ardis publisher Carl Proffer in Moscow, with the injunction that it not be published until Aleshkovsky was in the United States, because he felt that gaining fame in the West was not worth risking the loss of his freedom in the Soviet Union. Despite the wide distribution of Nikolai Nikolaevich and his songs, Aleshkovsky believes that he escaped arrest because “critically thinking KGB men” read his “phantasmagorical works and had a good laugh.”4 Introduction\n\n\\ xi\n\nxii \\\n\nIntroduction\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich is perhaps best known as an example of Aleshkovsky’s virtuosic deployment of the rich tradition of Russian obscene language, known as mat. The word mat is derived from the Russian word for “mother,” probably because some of its most taboo expressions involve the speaker copulating with the addressee’s mother. (The common expression “Yob tvoyu mat,” often translated as “Fuck your mother,” literally means “I fucked your mother.”) In an excellent introduction to mat published in The New Yorker, the writer Victor Erofeyev describes the political significance of Russian obscenity: “Mat expresses aggression, but in a country that has suffered from a chronic lack of freedom it also plays the role of a language of dissidence, of protest against official ideology, both political and religious.”5 Although Russian literature of the fin de siècle and early Soviet period could be quite frank about sexual matters, by the 1930s, with the establishment of socialist realism as the only acceptable writing style, the language of official literature became sanitized. Russian mat had always been to some extent an underground phenomenon, transmitted orally (notably in obscene folktales or the humorous couplets known as chastushki) or in unpublished manuscripts (the works of the eighteenth-century writer Ivan Semyonovich Barkov or Alexander Pushkin’s erotic tales). Aleshkovsky’s incorporation of mat into literature was a perfect expression of the taboo-breaking ethos of samizdat. As his friend, the major writer Andrei Bitov, wrote, “The use of Soviet phraseology in his pages sounds far more indecent and obscene than vulgar slang and thieves’ argot. But the noble crystals of mat, the only natural and inherent part of the Russian language that has been preserved in Soviet language, continue to send us the light of human speech, like extinguished stars in the darkness of a planetarium.”6\n\nMark Lipovetsky has linked Aleshkovsky’s challenge to Soviet official language to Mikhail Bakhtin’s theory of carnival: The poetics of the lower bodily stratum, the “slum naturalism,” the eccentricity of plot and style, the reliance on coarse language, the blasphemous defamation of official dogmas and symbols of truth, the comic grotesque and in general “unrestrained carnival word— familiar, cynically frank, eccentric, eulogistic-abusive” (Bakhtin)— all of the most important components of the carnivalesque tradition, including the drama of confrontation with “that one-sided and gloomy official seriousness which is dogmatic and hostile to evolution and change” (Bakhtin), appear in Aleshkovsky’s fiction with exceptional precision and in an utterly natural, unmannered style.7\n\nThis is no mere coincidence—Aleshkovsky was close friends with scholars like Sergei Bocharov, who were instrumental in reintroducing the works of Bakhtin to a broad public in the 1960s, and he also knew Bakhtin personally.8 Priscilla Meyer sees Aleshkovsky’s use of mat as serving “an incantatory, purifying purpose, purging the corrupt language that is forced upon every Soviet citizen.”9 The plot of Nikolai Nikolaevich is particularly transgressive, since it deals with masturbation, a subject that even today in the West, not to speak of the puritanical official culture of the Soviet Union, bears a lingering burden of shame and embarrassment. In his Writer’s Diary for 1873, in a feuilleton called “Little Pictures,” Fyodor Dostoevsky describes listening to a group of drunken workmen on the street and realizing that the language of obscenity is the perfect language for a drunk person, whose physical ability to articulate is impaired but whose “flow of thoughts and sensations” Introduction\n\n\\ xiii\n\nxiv \\\n\nIntroduction\n\nhas increased along with his intoxication (a perfect description of many of Aleshkovsky’s narrators). Listening to the workmen, Dostoevsky realizes that their language can be encapsulated in one word: “Purely and simply, it is one noun not found in the dictionary, so that the entire language consists of but one word that can be pronounced with remarkable ease.” Listening to the workmen, he “realized that it was possible to express all thoughts, sensations, and even entire, profound propositions using only this one noun which, besides, has very few syllables.”10 In fact, the word that Dostoevsky has in mind, khui, the vulgar term for the penis, has only one syllable and is spelled with only three letters in Cyrillic. Dostoevsky clearly exaggerates when he claims that the workmen are carrying on a complex conversation using only this one unadorned word. But it is undeniable that Russian mat is in general a more flexible and multifarious linguistic tool than are English obscenities, although the deployment of obscenity in present-day hip-hop discourse is probably the closest approximation to the richness of mat. Jesse Sheidlower has assembled an impressive lexicon of the permutations of the English word “fuck.” But in Russian, not only is khui only one of several deeply taboo words on which mat is founded, but these nouns can be endlessly varied by the use of prefixes and suffixes to create a panoply of verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with connotations ranging from positive to negative. The word khui can also be combined with various prepositions to create cogent twoword mat idioms.11 This translation attempts to capture the rhythm and verve of the demotic speech of Aleshkovsky’s narrator, but the predominance of “fuck” in English obscenity cannot be wished away. English simply has no precise equivalent for the richness of Russian mat.\n\nYet another layer of language in Nikolai Nikolaevich is the narrator’s deployment of criminals’ and prison slang (fenia or blatnoi iazyk), which is very much in character for a pickpocket recently released from a prison camp. Some of these words are derived from Yiddish. According to tradition, the use of Yiddish originated with Jewish criminal gangs as a language that would be incomprehensible to police, and it came to be used by non-Jewish Russian criminals as well. Nikolai uses the words ksiva (from the Yiddish ksiveh, translated here as “papers,” chapter 2) and tsimes (tsimmes, a sweet stew, translated here as “the most delicious thing in the world,” chapter 3). The most important of these words in Nikolai Nikolaevich is fraer (freier, translated here as “amateur”). Although this word is often translated as “sucker,” it in fact refers to “a free person,” a person who has never served time. Nikolai and other criminals see themselves as set apart from the amateurs by their experience, worldview, and not least of all, language. For many of the educated Russian readers of Nikolai Nikolaevich, both the obscenities and the prison slang would require glossing, which Nikolai sometimes provides himself in the space of a single sentence. (The original Ardis edition included a few explanatory footnotes for the slang, but by no means enough to render the text fully comprehensible to the uninitiated.) Just as important as mat and prison slang for the texture of Nikolai Nikolaevich is its engagement with the tragedy of twentieth-century Russian biology. Starting in the late 1920s, the peasant agrobiologist Trofim Denisovich Lysenko (1898–1976) made claims for a native Russian form of biology based on the work of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin (1855–1935) in hybridization. In broad terms, Lysenkoism claimed to be materialist, as opposed to the supposedly Introduction\n\n\\ xv\n\nxvi \\\n\nIntroduction\n\nidealist theories of Western genetics as represented by Gregor Mendel, August Weismann, and T. H. Morgan. Lysenko rejected the methods of experimental science in favor of getting \"practical\" agricultural results. The story of Lysenkoism is a long and complicated one that has been widely studied by historians of science and of Stalinism.12 The episode in the saga that is crucial for Nikolai Nikolaevich is the postwar triumph of Lysenkoism, supported personally by Stalin, and the rout of the geneticists at the 1948 meeting of the Lenin All-Union Agricultural Academy. At this meeting, as Ethan Pollock writes, “Practical science was equated with the ability to transform nature. One of the speakers, a director of a cattle-breeding station, was fearful of the results of Mendelism-Morganism, which he said was ‘reactionary to the core since it is bound to lower the role of Soviet man into a passive appendage of nature, a placid contemplator of nature who humbly waits for gifts and favors from her.’ In contrast, Michurinism was the ‘great transformer of nature.’ ”13 In the aftermath of the 1948 meeting, the Central Committee of the Communist Party acted to replace supporters of \"Mendelism-Morganism\" in research institutions and other venues of scientific enterprise. Although Aleshkovsky invents a fanciful research program for the scientists who employ Nikolai Nikolaevich, the destruction of their laboratory has its roots in Soviet reality.14 Aleshkovsky says, “I know important biologists who were driven mad by Lysenkoism and by the strange hatred the ignoramuses in power had for the bases of modern genetics and microbiology, which held back the growth of this science for decades.”15 Oliver Ready, the author of one of the best analyses of Aleshkovsky’s work, writes, “Nikolai Nikolaevich . . . deals in equivocation\n\nand paradox, leaving the reader uncertain as to the exact balance in his speech of idiocy and cunning, affected simple-mindedness and true ignorance.”16 The same can certainly be said of Camouflage, in which equivocation and paradox are the very essence of the plot. For most of the novel, we are left in doubt, not only about the narrator’s sanity but also about the nature of the story that he is telling to a man he addresses as his brother, the General. The narrator, Fedya Milashkin, claims to be “a camouflager of the eighth (highest) rank” (chapter 1), part of a vast team engaged in creating a simulacrum of depressing Soviet reality for the benefit of American spy satellites flying overhead. According to him, the drunks, prostitutes, and people standing in line for scarce food products are performing an elaborate charade to deceive the Pentagon, while underground, in sparkling laboratories, scientists and technicians are hard at work on nuclear bombs, which are transported in vans labeled “MEAT” and “EAT COD FILLET.” But throughout the novel, the reader is left unable to decide: Is this a science fiction tale or a realistic picture of Soviet life in the 1970s? Is the city of Staroporokhov (“Old Dusty”) a godforsaken provincial town, a mythic conception like Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin’s Glupov (“Stupidtown”), or is it Moscow itself (as becomes more and more likely as the tale goes on)? Like most of Aleshkovsky’s works, including Nikolai Nikolaevich, Camouflage is a monologue by a narrator with a strongly marked linguistic profile. If Nikolai Nikolaevich’s speech reflects his experience as a criminal and former camp inmate, Fedya Milashkin’s speech, although also rich in mat, is far more steeped in the clichés and rhetoric of Marxism-Leninism-Brezhnevism, as filtered through the Soviet mass media. Nikolai Nikolaevich is the Soviet version of a social drinker, while Milashkin is an out-and-out alcoholic, so the Introduction\n\n\\ xvii\n\nxviii \\\n\nIntroduction\n\npeculiar slang of drinkers plays a more prominent role in Camouflage, while prison slang is virtually absent (Milashkin’s experience with imprisonment is limited to stays in the drunk tank). While Nikolai Nikolaevich deals with the tragic derailment of Soviet biological science by blind ideology, Camouflage, written seven years later, grapples with bread-and-butter issues in the most literal sense. The novel centers on the bitter realization that a revolution in the name of the People has devolved into a system in which those at the top enjoy a luxurious life while the People starve and descend into mindless drunkenness. In a deliriously imagined meeting of the Politburo (the ruling group of the Central Committee of the Communist Party), KGB director Yuri Andropov proposes prohibition, to which Premier Aleksei Kosygin replies, “Are you all crazy? Prohibition would bring an immediate halt to the construction of the Baikal-Amur Railway and all our other youth-initiative construction projects! You can’t buck people up just with slogans. . . . People in the provinces have nothing to eat, so let them at least get drunk” (chapter 10). Perhaps the most pointed satirical thrust of Camouflage is what Ready calls “a critical view of Russian drinking habits as an instrument of state oppression.”17 The drunkenness and resulting impotence of the men of Staroporokhov, as well as the genetic defects appearing in their children, lead the women to stage a protest that goes well beyond Lysistrata (and will not be spoiled in this introduction). Milashkin’s wife, Duska, the ringleader of the women’s rebellion, goes to the heart of the novel’s morality in her speech to her interrogators: “You see, Comrade Prosecutors, we too want to sleep with our husbands like normal broads, just for fun and for pleasure, and to have babies. And we don’t want to feel ashamed when we compare our babies’ brains and appearances\n\nto those in other countries. Let Kosygin know: we’re going to stand up for ourselves!” Referring to the frantic preparations for the 1980 Olympics to be held in Moscow, Duska continues, “We . . . don’t give a damn about your stadiums! The Dotsenkos’ daughter can hardly walk. She has eight toes on each foot. Do you expect her to set new records at your 1980 Olympics? And the Dolidzes’ little Givi—he’s got a crooked vertebra—are you going to send him out on the ice to do double toe loops?” (chapter 9). Lipovetsky discusses the “epic scope” of Aleshkovsky’s grotesque plots, which intersect with and interpret the major landmarks of the Soviet story: “All of Aleshkovsky’s characters are highly historical.”18 Aleshkovsky’s son, Aleksei, echoes this statement when he writes that his father aspires to the laurels of Oswald Spengler or Arnold J. Toynbee, historians whose works have broad civilizational ambitions: “The object of his study is not fates or characters, not the general and not the typical; the object of his study is Soviet power, the civilization of horror. His books are an encyclopedia of Soviet life, the image of which has become the novella Camouflage—a devastating metaphor of lies.”19 Aleksei Aleshkovsky is paraphrasing Vissarion Belinsky’s 1845 characterization of Pushkin’s novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, as “an encyclopedia of Russian life.” Belinsky also called Pushkin’s novel “an act of consciousness for Russian society”—a label that applies just as well to Camouflage, which cuts through the illusions of propaganda (whether emanating from Soviet television or the Voice of America) to the essence of the Soviet experience.20 The “unprintable” language in which Aleshkovsky couches his artistic engagement with the fate of Russia in the twentieth century is an indispensable part of his mission—to return a voice to a suffering nation. Joseph Brodsky compares Aleshkovsky to Mozart in the Introduction\n\n\\ xix\n\nxx \\\n\nIntroduction\n\nway he is able to hear and capture Russian speech; Lev Loseff says that he “does not encrust his prose with vulgarisms, the way writers of the past did to create portraits of the common people; he saddles the powerful element of the common people’s speech. . . . He seldom uses indecent speech to describe sexual phenomena, rather it is an oceanic eros out of which myths arise.”21 We may return to Dostoevsky for an answer to the charge of indecency. He responded to a critic of his feuilleton about the cursing tradesmen by asserting that there is really nothing obscene about the Russian people’s use of obscenity. The common people who bought up copies of the journal in order to laugh at his feuilleton “did not laugh for the sake of the abomination, not from love of that and the art of it; their laughter was extremely simple-hearted and not depraved; healthy, though coarse; entirely unlike the laughter of some of those who spread filth in our society or in our literature. The People use profanity to no purpose and often when talking about things that are not at all indecent. Our People are not corrupt and are even very pure, despite the fact that they are unquestionably the greatest users of profanity in the whole world.”22 There is a healthy dose of romanticization here, but Dostoevsky’s words are applicable to both Nikolai Nikolaevich and Fedya Milashkin, whose “unprintable” language, ultimately the instrument of loyalty, faithfulness, and love, is juxtaposed with the truly obscene persecutions of the Soviet state.\n\nA NOTE ON THE TE XT This translation is based on the original publication, Nikolai Nikolaevich & Maskirovka (Ann Arbor, MI: Ardis, 1980), checked\n\nagainst Sobranie sochinenii v trekh tomakh (Collected Works in Three Volumes), vol. 1 (Moscow: NNN, 1996). In the notes, we have used a slightly modified Library of Congress transliteration. In the text, we have used the somewhat inconsistent principle of “what looks good to an English-speaking reader.” Russian names consist of a first name, a patronymic, and a last name. The patronymic is formed from the father’s first name plus the suffix “-ovich”/“-evich” for men or “-ovna”/“-evna” for women. Russian also uses a wide array of diminutives for the first name. “Nikolaevich” is not Nikolai’s last name, but his patronymic (his father also was named Nikolai). He is sometimes referred to by the diminutives “Kolya” or “Kolenka.” We never learn Milashkin’s patronymic. His formal first name is Fyodor, but he is more often called by the nickname “Fedya.” The Soviet secret police were founded in 1917 by Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky and given the official title “All-Russian Emergency Commission for the Struggle with Counter-Revolution and Sabotage,” most often referred to by its shortened name, “Cheka.” The agency was given various names over the course of the twentieth century, but continued to be called “the Cheka” in colloquial speech. In 1954, it became the Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti (Committee for State Security), better known as the KGB.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\\ xxi\n\nNIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH AND CAMOUFLAGE\n\nNIKOLAI NIKOLAEVICH A Science Fiction Story\n\n01\n\nN\n\now listen up. I know this won’t be boring. If you do get bored, it’ll mean you’re a complete dickhead and don’t understand a damned thing about molecular biology or the story of my life. Look at me: I’m a good-looking guy, I’ve got new threads, and I can wiggle my mustache in a cool way. I own a nice car, a “Moskvich” (sure, it’s old, but it runs). My apartment is not a co-op, and my wife will soon have her PhD. The wife, I have to say, is a puzzle—a mystery of impenetrable depths. That sphinx the Arabs have—I saw it once in a short film—is nothing compared to her. There’s nothing in it to figure out, if you really think about it. Well, more about the wife later. Hey, don’t fill your glass all the way, try half-full. That’ll give you a more intellectual sort of high, and your eyes won’t go wandering off in all directions. Have a bite to eat as well. Otherwise, you’ll get bombed and won’t understand a damned thing of what I’m saying. To make a long story short, I was nineteen when I got out of prison after the war. My aunt wangled me a permit to live in Moscow (her boss at the Passport Bureau was fucking her right on the floor of his office!). My first month in Moscow, I didn’t work. Didn’t feel\n\n4\\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nlike it. I spent some time picking pockets on the tram or on the trolleybus—didn’t even have a partner to pass the goods to. For me, it’s an art. See these fingers? Oistrakh can go fuck himself: my fingers are longer.1 You know, I could tell, just with these fingers, what kind of bills people were carrying—in their wallets or in their pockets. I could feel the color with my fingers. And never made a mistake. So many guys get busted just for the sake of a ruble or an affidavit from the housing office! These idiot amateurs go after a ruble as if it’s a million-dollar banknote. They waste so much energy, balancing on their toes, slowly pulling it out, and then they’re the ones who get their asses hauled off to the cooler (here in the USSR, it doesn’t matter how much you swipe, the important thing is: don’t steal). So, as I say, I was doing some pickpocketing. I’d gotten the knack of the “Bukashka” trolleybus route and the “Annushka” tram.2 But I never stole food ration cards. When they turned up, I’d send them back by mail or toss them into lost and found. I had enough money. I was planning to get married. Out of the blue, my aunt said to me: “Our neighbor’s taking you on at the institute. You’ll be a lab assistant. Sooner or later, you’re going to get busted. They’re about to increase the jail terms. My man was telling me about it: he has a brother at the Lubyanka, his brother hunts spies and gets everything straight from Beria.” And it was true. They’d just come out with a decree. Five to twenty-five years for theft. I shit my pants. I knew my luck couldn’t last much longer. I wanted to learn a trade, but I didn’t like working. I just can’t work. That’s all there is to it! For the life of me, I can’t. In the camps, they’d taught us how not to work. But this time around, I knew I’d better go to work with my neighbor at the institute because of the omen: If you shit your pants, you’ll soon get busted.\n\nThis neighbor and I used to exchange greetings in the morning. He’d always take a long time sitting on the toilet, rustling his newspaper and laughing. He’d flush and then howl with laughter. Scientists are all so screwed up. It looked to me like he was fucking my aunt too. Anyway, I got the job in his lab. His last name was Kimza—you couldn’t tell his nationality, but you knew he wasn’t a Jew or a Russian. A good-looking guy, but somehow he always seemed tired. He was about thirty. “Your job,” he said, “will be to carry the chemicals and help set up the experiments. If you want, you can take some courses. What do you say?” “It makes no difference to us Tatars,” I say, “whether we drag in the ones who are going to be fucked or drag away the ones who’ve been fucked.” “I do not want to hear any more of your filthy language.” “Okay.”\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\5\n\n02\n\nI\n\n’d been working in Kimza’s lab for about a week. They had me dragging all sorts of crap around the lab, and I washed out the beakers. One time, during lunch break, I burned my tongue on some kind of acid and shat blue for about four days! I thought it was cooking salt, but the damned thing turned out to be a chemical of some sort. I didn’t take any sick days, though. I was afraid they’d stick a mine-thrower up my ass like they did in camp when I downed a vial of ink so they wouldn’t send me up north on the next convoy. So, I was working. I was setting up a new lab. Microscopes up to your ass, instruments, motors, and all that stuff. Soon, I’d had it with working so hard. So, just for the hell of it, I lifted a wallet from the boss of the Personnel Department. I did it for the sake of my professional artistry—took it from his side pocket while he was standing in the buffet line. What a fucking big deal they made of it! In about an hour and a half, a plainclothes platoon arrived, and they wouldn’t let anybody leave the institute. A general search of the premises: the only place they didn’t look was up your anus. Why make such a big deal of it? I took the wallet with me down to the toilet to take a shit. I opened the wallet. No money, just papers. Denunciations, that is.\n\n8\\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nThere was even a denunciation of my Kimza. It said he was pushing science backward to fuck knows where, and he doesn’t sing or clap at meetings. When he votes, it said, he looks disgusted, and he turns the radio off when it’s playing light music by Soviet composers. His experiments are directed against “Man, which has a proud sound,” and therefore, his work indirectly undermines the economy. Understand what I’m saying? It was smelling like a quarter-century for Kimza. Article 58.1 I don’t like squealers! So, first I wiped my ass with the statements aimed at the other scientists (according to them, the entire institute had turned into a conspiratorial hornet’s nest—did that include me?). Then I pocketed the denunciation of Kimza, sliced up the wallet with a razor, and tossed the pieces into the toilet. Someone was tugging at the door, yelling and screaming. I opened the door and explained that I’d had it up to here with chemistry, and doors are not teeth, so there was no fucking reason to pull on it like that. “Look,” I say to Kimza, “a piece of paper about you.” He reads it, turns pale, thanks me, understands everything, and stuffs the letter right the fuck into the strongest acid he can find. It dissolves right down to nothing more than a fucked grandmother right before our eyes! That’s when they drag me off to the Head of Personnel. I, of course, don’t know a thing. “Better tailors than you have sewn suits for me,” I say, “and even those fell apart at the seams the first time they were tried on.” “There’s testimony that you were rubbing up against people from behind in the buffet line. Could it be you were remembering the good old days?”\n\n“Fuck their testimony. Just tell me: was there a lot of money in the wallet?” “There wasn’t any money at all.” “Well, then, why would I want to waste my time on shit like that?” The plainclothesmen laughed (they seemed to relax when they heard my simple language), and they let me go. Next day, I tell Kimza I’m not going to work there anymore. I tell him it’s against my principles to be a worker. I tell him I’m an artist, dedicated to my craft. I also tell him I love to lie on the couch and devour books. That’s when he looks at me strangely—for a long time. Then, in a roundabout way, he tells me all about the importance to mankind of his biology, and about the research he’s just begun, the likes of which has never been tried before. In a word, it’s an experiment, and I am an indispensable part of it. He says the work will be rewarding and creative. The most interesting thing about it, he says, is that it’s not work, but pure pleasure. On top of that, it’s highly paid. The only thing required, he says, is to approach it without prejudice and with thoughts about the future of mankind (he kept stressing this last point most of all). “Listen, neighbor,” I say, “don’t fuck with my brains. What the hell are you talking about?” “You must become a donor.” “Give blood?” “No, not blood.” “What then,” I laugh, “shit or piss?” “Sperm is what we need, Nikolai, sperm!” “What’s sperm?” “The stuff little children come from.”\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\9\n\n10 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n“What do you mean ‘sperm’? That’s jizz, or jizzum in scientific circles.” “Okay, call it jizzum. Are you willing to give it up for science? Don’t worry, there’s nothing to be ashamed about here. By the way, complete confidentiality is guaranteed.” “So why aren’t you donating any yourself?” I asked suspiciously. He frowned. “Because they might accuse me of nepotism in my chosen object of research. Is it a deal?” All I could do was sit down on the floor and laugh. Not fucking bad work! I almost pissed my pants, and my appendicitis flared up. Kimza says, “Stop acting like an idiot. Sit down and listen to why we need your sperm.” So I stop laughing and listen. It turns out this is Kimza’s plan: First, I beat off and wank off (which are one and the same), then they will put my jizz under a microscope and study it, and after that, they will try to introduce it into the womb of an infertile broad and see if she gets pregnant. At this point, I interrupt, concerning the issue of child-support payments (you knock up five women or so, and there goes your whole paycheck). “That’s one thing you don’t have to worry about,” he says. He also has certain top-secret plans for my jizz that he promises to tell me about, just as soon as the experiment gets under way. Would you believe? Just from listening to this, my little snot-nosed one stood right up: “Let’s get started then!” This wasn’t the first time for me. . . . In the camps, there’d always be that one person in a hundred who’d hold back, while the other ninety-nine were wanking like a hundred (all you had to do was not feel guilty about it). Sometimes there’d be a guy who’d wank off and\n\nthen walk around for the next three days like a dead man, suffering from shame. The experience could cripple him for life. I knew this Lyovka Milstein—a real swindler. They’d pound on a rail as the signal to go to sleep, the skin pistons would pick up speed, and Lyovka would grit his teeth, struggle with himself, and then, little by little, quiet down. I would try to make him feel better about it: “The organism calls,” I’d say. “You must show it respect. It’s not to blame. Don’t be its public prosecutor.” Okay, so I think it over for a while. I ask Kimza about working conditions. How many times a day do I have to come? What’s the work schedule? What’s the salary scale? And what’s the title for this position in the labor book? “Orgasm once a day, in the mornings. We’ll register you as a technical consultant. The salary will be the standard state allowance: 820 rubles. The workday is not fixed norm. After orgasm, you can go to the movies.”\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 11\n\n03\n\nI\n\ndon’t let on that I am surprised, even fucking amazed. All I’ll have to do is arrive at work, I’ll wank off, and spend the rest of the day picking pockets on the Annushka tram or the Bukashka trolleybus. If I get busted, there’ll be mitigating circumstances: I work at the institute. So I agree to take the job. That same evening, I drop in on a friend of mine who is an old internationalclass thief. He was a world-class crook until they locked up the borders with the crack guard Karatsupa and his faithful dog, Ingus.1 When he hears the news, the thief says to me, “You’re fortunate and lucky, but you’re also selling yourself short. After all, cum is more expensive than black caviar. It’s almost on a par with platinum or radium. You stupid jerk! If I were you, I’d sell my spermatozoa one at a time to these biologists. That’s why they’ve been given microscopes—to count up small items. Sell them by the piece, goddammit! Understand?!” “I understand. How could I not? I’m an ass, I really am. After all, the spermatozoon is the most delicious thing in the world. And frequent wanking is so injurious to one’s health! Don’t worry,” I say to the international thief, “I’ll up my price gradually. I’m no amateur.”\n\n14 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n“Too bad you can’t dilute jizz the way they do sour cream in the store. You could skim off more profit that way.” “Fuck it!” I say, slapping myself on the forehead. “Of course! Next time I’ll hold back and give them a second coming, I’ll outwit them and overfulfill the plan!” “I wouldn’t advise doing that,” the thief says, speaking seriously. “Never interrupt sexual relations, even if it’s with Dunyasha the Fist. It’s bad for you. I once had to get rid of a broad because of that. She started howling at me, ‘Do your coming somewhere else!’ ‘How about in your middle ear?’ I asked. ‘I don’t give a damn where you do it, just not in my pussy!’ And would you believe: my goddamned toenails almost stopped growing because of that! I had to get rid of her. Because you’ve always got to come like a man. That’s my advice, and for that, you can treat me to a bottle on payday. Also, get some milk off them on grounds of compensation for damages. Tell them blood donors are normally given some sort of meat to eat after they donate. Don’t be a fucking amateur. Remember: in America, you come five times, and you earn enough to buy a car. Got it?”\n\n04\n\nW\n\nell, when I arrive at work the next morning, I try not to laugh. I’m feeling a little ashamed, but, on the other hand, why the hell should I be embarrassed? Why shouldn’t all fucking humanity make use of it?! Maybe it’ll be of some use to people? I take a look, and see they’ve already prepared a little cubicle for me. About 3½ meters square, without windows. There’s fluorescent lighting. It’s warm inside. There’s an ottoman couch in there. And on the chair beside it, a test tube. “This is your workplace, Nikolai,” says Kimza. “Let’s just agree: no bullshit,” I reply. Kimza insists that I should not develop an inferiority compass about what I’m doing. On the contrary, he says, I should feel proud. “Make yourself comfortable and start as soon as I give the order, ‘Attention! Orgasm!’ After orgasm, seal the test tube with a cork.” “So they won’t run all over the place?” “Work quickly and without losses! Didn’t you read the sign?”1 I locked the door, lay down, thought for a while, and remembered the time when a friend and I escaped to the women’s camp\n\n16 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nand fucked our way right through all the lady thieves. The ones we didn’t manage to get to (mostly fascists and amateurs)—they ripped off our underpants, tore them into little pieces, and passed them around among themselves so they’d at least have our manly aroma to keep them company under their little government-issue blankets. As I remembered this, my snot-nosed one started moving his head around in all directions like a cobra hearkening to a flute. I’d been doing so little fucking at the time that I came right away—a whole half-test-tube full. “The whole Milky Way,” as my bunkmate in prison used to say. Astronomy was his specialty. A friend ratted on him for saying, fuck planet Earth up the ass if all this outrageous shit takes place on it. Forgive me, I got carried away. So I brought the test tube to Kimza. “Ah,” he said, “let’s have a look.” He smeared some of it onto a little slide, and then shoved the rest into some sort of ice-covered apparatus that was giving off steam. After he looked into the microscope, Kimza just stared at me as if he’d won the lottery. “Nikolai,” he said, “you are a ‘Superman’! Superhuman! Unbelievable! Don’t ask me why. You’ll understand later. I’ll teach you what you need to know about biology.” “Can I have a look?” “Another time. Run along now. See you tomorrow.” Well, that’s when I say to him politely that in America, they pay a much higher price for sperm. I also say: “From now on I need to be fed my fill after every orgasm. Otherwise I’ll only be able to come on a weekly basis. All of science will have to stop: my jizz will run out!”\n\n“Well,” he says, “what would you like in the way of snacks? Remember it’s tough to get groceries these days. The whole country is starving, except for our leaders and heads of supermarkets.” “Two hundred grams of meat,” I say. “Bread and butter. Maybe also a glass of sunflower seeds. And some strong tea.” “Why sunflower seeds?” Kimza asks. I tell him, when I get bored while wanking, I can snack on sunflower seeds with my other hand. “There will be no sunflower seeds,” says Kimza, getting angry. “But I’ll work on getting the meat. My boss is an academicianvegetarian—I’ll get his meat ration coupon. He attaches great importance to you.” “They’ve got to raise my salary. You aren’t paying for this out of your own pocket, are you?” “We’ll raise your salary. I’m organizing the laboratory. I’ll hike up the rates for your position, and we’ll give you a raise. We will pay you well for that jizz of yours. That’s wicked stuff you’ve got there, Nikolai! Now run along, or these spermatozoa I’m holding are going to croak. Just tell the doorman that you’re going out to pick up the order for the oscilloscope.” “Don’t you worry, I’m a master at cover-up.” After that, when I’d walk around the institute, my conscience would start to bother me for the first time in my life. All those doctors, scholars, and lab workers—slaving away! And all I had to do was wank off to my heart’s content, and I’d be done for the day. I get to go home. Somehow it made me feel awkward. On the other hand, I could see that my jizz was needed not only by science, but by the whole country as well. I’m getting paid by the job. The only problem was that I’d feel drowsy after orgasm. Even too lazy for pocket-picking! Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 17\n\n18 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nSo I headed out to a bar to drink and stuff myself on crayfish and crackers. By the way, do you know you can get an erection just from drinking beer? After five mugs of beer, all you have to do is think about a woman and not about taking a piss. But if you take a piss, you lose it. I know what you’re going to ask next. You want to know how you can do without pissing? You have to be able to instill selfdiscipline. For example, there are people in India who can go for a month or more without taking a shit, and their piss is transformed into sweat and tears. I suppose if you look at this in scientific or our biogolical terms, you could say the excrement, that is, the shit of these Indian philosophers, becomes transformed into smell. Take alcohol, for example. If you don’t put a cork in it, it goes flat. Spirits go flat right away, but shit takes a long time. There’s a completely different molecule in it (in shit, that is). That bastard really stinks. And let’s not even talk about the shit atom. That bitch probably wouldn’t split even in a synchrophasatron. By the way, I’ll have to ask Kimza what would happen if the shit atom did split. There’d probably be a worldwide stink rising up to the clouds. . . . Hey, drink up! This stuff is as pure as it gets. They give me two liters a month so I can disinfect my balls before orgasm. But then, since I am a true Soviet citizen, I’ve introduced economizing measures. Here’s how it was. One time, when Kimza was handing out alcohol to everyone but me, I thought to myself: “Well, fuck this!” And I scraped some mud from my shoes into my test tube of jizz (I’m no amateur), and Kimza immediately sounded the alarm: “Why aren’t these spermatozoa sterile? Why are they so grimy? Is it so difficult for the donor to wash his hands?” “During the experiment, it’s not the hands that need washing; it’s the penis—the instrument of production. It spends most of its time\n\nin our pants, not in a vacuum. And God knows where it’s been in any twenty-four-hour period.” “How much do you need?” Kimza frowned. “Two liters,” I say. “That’s a little much. Three hundred grams should do the trick.” But I argue that before I take hold of my dick, I have to wipe off all the fingers on both hands—since I do switch hands. And the groin area needs to be sterilized as well! “Very well, we’ll order a liter a month.” “What?” I put my foot down. “That’s not going to do the job. A liter is fine for an off-duty dick in recumbent position, for example, a soggy dick that’s just come out of the cold Black Sea waters at Gagry. But for an upright dick, you need three times as much. I’m asking in good conscience! Hell, I’m giving up the most valuable stuff I have for the people’s sake. In America I’d already have a summer house at a health resort, and I’d own a Lincoln Continental and other property. I want you to know I’m no Chichikov, these aren’t dead souls I’m selling to the government. These are my own fresh, native sperm. So don’t try to skimp on me. I’m a man! Pickle me in alcohol, and I sure as hell won’t drink it. What do you shitheads think, I’m going to preserve my dick in alcohol while I’m still alive? Bastards! If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t be defending your dissertations, you’d be defending your asses in an emergency meeting at the Director’s office. My dick is supporting all of you!! Our institute has a bad reputation, there’s no order here at all—not like it is in prison or in the cooler.2 I’ve never squealed in my life, but if you snakes put the squeeze on my spirits, I’ll squeal to the Party Committee, the Local Committee, and the Trade Union!!” “All right, two liters,” says Kimza, “and not a gram more!!” Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 19\n\n20 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nAnd he gives the command, “Attention—Orgasm!!” So, as you can see, my friend, I was all set in the alcohol department. I’d rationalized the whole procedure—I’d sterilize my dick when it was limp, not erect, and that way I’d get a bonus. To your health! Eat up, my friend! The sturgeon and red caviar I reserved specially for you today. So that’s the way it is. By the way, I don’t much like black caviar. It gives me a diathesis. My ass breaks out in spots, and it itches. It’s awful, you have to drink calcium, and that scummy stuff is really bitter. So that’s the way it is. Back then, I never would have dreamed of snacks like these.\n\n05\n\nS\n\no: mornings I’d go to the institute, I’d punch in, and I wouldn’t do any screwing around with the Mashas (because I didn’t want to get my personal fill of fucking and disappoint the lab with my sperm count, or, as they say these days, “be a cock-tease”). After I’d settled in, I presented Kimza with an ultimatum. “You expend only ordinary energy at work, while I expend the most important kind. After I come, I can barely stand up, and there’s a tugging feeling in the pit of my stomach. Maybe I’ve got another fifteen years to live if I’m lucky, and all you sons of bitches do is loaf around!” Meanwhile Kimza’s experiments had gotten off to a great start. Sometimes he would even joke about erecting a monument to my dick—with a wind-up mechanism attached—so it could rise with the first rays of the sun. In ancient times there really were such monuments, but later they took them down. People got embarrassed. Why? Really, if you think about it, my friend, the penis is the most important thing. It’s more important than the brain. A million years ago we didn’t think with our brains, we thought with our\n\n22 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\ndicks. Brains have evolved only recently. If this weren’t so, a rocket wouldn’t look like a dick. It would look like an asshole, and nothing would come out of it but a smelly rumbling. That’s not what you need to make it to the moon. But why bother talking about it. Just remember what I’m saying, you’ll see! When the brain runs out of room to evolve in, there’ll be one big final fuck-up. Nobody will be able to get it up, not even fools like you and me. All anyone will be able to do is kick the bucket, and they’ll have to turn the maternity wards and newlywed salons into funeral homes and flower shops. On all the streets, there’ll be wood-shavings crunching underfoot. Carpenters will be busy. Okay! Why the fuck are you bugging your eyes? Don’t worry—it will be a long time coming. In fact, there’s not even going to be an absolute final fuck-up. I’ll tell you more about that later. . . . So I say to Kimza: “Give me a raise. I need new threads, and televisions are going on sale soon. If you don’t give me a raise, I’m going to have to go back to picking pockets, or learn how to drive the Bukashka trolley. If you want to, pay me out of your own pocket. I’ll make a private deal with you to get you the sperm. Two and a half thousand rubles is what I’m asking.” “Okay. We’ll let two of our cleaning ladies go, and put you down as having more than one position.” “Fuck that floor work.” “You’ll just be listed as a cleaning lady. Other lab workers will do the cleaning. Is that clear?” “That’s okay, then.” “Your appetites have grown, I must say.” “What are you saying, whore? You want me to get married?”\n\n“No, no! Keep cool. Really, I wouldn’t mind giving you ten thou. And if I should receive the Nobel Prize, I’ll pay you off properly, but these are difficult and worrisome times in our science.1 God willing, we’ll complete our experiment! Tomorrow we will begin the crucial phase!” Well, I was overjoyed! Twenty-four hundred rubles! You can’t earn that on the bus, let alone on the Bukashka trolley.\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 23\n\n06\n\nI\n\nset off for the planetarium to celebrate. Of course, first I have a drink as is required. I love doing this: You sit down in a soft chair feeling a light buzz, the lecturer tells all sorts of tall tales about life on other planets and moons, and you just sit there feeling sleepy. The sky appears above your noggin, and you can see all the stars and planets that you can’t see in our country.1 The Southern Cross, for example: to see that, you’d have to cross a border, and if you did, they’d nail you on the spot with Article 58, which I need like a pussy needs an alarm clock. Then you can see the little stars and the various constellations blinking up above you, and the sky becomes completely dark, quietly revolving. You’re sitting in the easy chair with a light buzz, and it seems like you’re the only one on the whole earth. At this moment, there’s not a fucking thing that you, wretched creature, could possibly be in need of. Then suddenly it begins to get light. You can’t see the Milky Way anymore, and the sky turns pink along the edges. Smart-assed apparatus! Then the clock chimes: bim-bom. I’ve let six o’clock slip by me. Wouldn’t it be great if it were morning and time to go to work again! I think to myself: Thank God\n\n26 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nI don’t have to sleep on those prison beds and gag on that prison soup, and then run off to the guard post like a goner. Next, I stop in at a bar and have some more to drink to celebrate my raise. Then, I go over to the former international thief ’s house, but there’s nothing spending the night in his cupboard that’s worth eating, so I’ve got to run to the supermarket. The thief has also been doing some drinking. He envies me, praises me, and warns me not to blab: otherwise, some prick student will smell me out. “Watch out for volunteers,” he says, “they’re up to our asses and beyond.” I get soused too and oversleep at the thief ’s place. So, next morning I’m fucking hurrying to get to work on time, and my head feels like a basket with fried nails rattling around in it. When I get to the lab, Kimza really sets the dogs on me: “You’re holding up the most important experiment! ‘Attention! Orgasm!!’ ” I notice there’s a new instrument in the lab, giving off steam. An academician in a black cap is running around it, rubbing his pink hands together. I lock myself in my little cubicle and turn on the fluorescent light. My hand is trembling, no matter how hard I bang away on the balalaika, I can’t come. I’m wanking away, sweating up a storm, when Kimza knocks on my door. He thinks I’ve passed out from a hangover. “Why are you withholding orgasm? This is an outrage!” I no longer had the strength to lift my hands. I was starting to get really scared. I think to myself: “That’s it! I’m finished! They’ll can me, the bastards, without severance pay. The jizz is gone. My jizz has run out!” I open the door and call Kimza. “Do whatever you want, I have a dry hard-on. I just can’t come.”\n\nThe academician pokes his head in and says: “What’s the matter, my boy, are you unable to ejaculate any spermatozoa?” I was so fucking tired! I wanted to resign on the spot, voluntarily. But suddenly a young research associate named Vlada Yurevna gives the order to Kimza and the academician: “Colleagues, please do not disturb the recipient” (me, that is). She comes in and closes the door. “Turn away, please,” she says, and she turns off the fluorescent light. Then, dear buddy, with her own little hand, she takes hold of me so sincerely—by my rude, boorish, stubborn bastard, by my penis . . . and everything in me tightens up, as if someone’s pounding diamond tacks into my spine with a silver hammer and dipping me, head to toe, in a bathtub of draft beer. Red crayfish are crawling along the foam, and there’s dark crackers floating next to them. That’s how fucking pleasurable it was! I don’t even know how much time went by, but, suddenly, I could feel I was about to come, and I couldn’t hold back for the life of me. I gritted my teeth, bent backwards, and screamed. . . . Later, Kimza told me I screamed for about twenty seconds. The test tubes even started ringing, my sound wave burned out the light bulb on the oscilloscope, and I fell off a cliff into unconsciousness. When I finally open my eyes, the light is on, and all the buttons on my fly are done up. Inside my head, it’s as cold and quiet as if it’s been stuffed with soft cheese and raisins (which I like a lot). Not a trace of hangover. I exit my cubicle into the lab, and everyone’s shushing me. The academician, working on the instrument that’s giving off steam, seems to be performing some sort of magic ritual and singing: “in place of the heart—a flaming motor . . .”2 How can you not respect yourself at a moment like this? Well, I did! Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 27\n\n28 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nSuddenly something snapped, they opened something up, they unscrewed the nuts on the top of the instrument, and the academician shouted, “Hurrah!” Then he ran over and shook my hand: “You, my boy, may be on your way to becoming the progenitor of a newly engendered human tribe on another planet! Every one of your spermatozoa will play its part in it! In a single thermos—a whole People! In two thermoses—a whole Nation! Or maybe it’s the other way round! The devil himself wouldn’t be able to make sense of these Stalinist formulae.3 I congratulate you! I wish you success!” And off he ran. I don’t understand what the fuck is going on. Vlada Yurevna is looking at me as if she isn’t the one who just jerked me off. It turns out, this is what happened after I came. First, they immersed my wicked little jizz in various liquid gases, then they fucking froze it all the way down to almost nothing, to a rock, and then they thawed it out again. After it was thawed, they took a look to see: Are the little flagellates still alive? Have the genes reshuffled? At first, they had trouble adjusting the temperature and the gas, but finally they got it just right. The next step? Well, they didn’t have rockets yet, but Kimza’s dream was to launch my jizz to Andromeda. In general, I try not to get too involved in this: I’m waiting to see how it will all turn out. Understand? Don’t sit there with that big mouth of yours hanging open. You still haven’t heard the most important part. Their idea was to send my sperm to the Andromeda galaxy in a glass test tube that would be like an impregnated belly. Nine months later, just like that, there’d be little Nikolai Nikolaeviches on planet Andromeda! A hundred or so would be born right away, and they’d fucking well adapt fast to their new surroundings. You don’t believe this could happen? Well, dickhead, try buying a live carp, freeze it, and throw\n\nit into the bathtub. You’ll see: it’ll come back to life. A-a-a! Gotcha! Careful you don’t fall over from amazement! That’s when the academician came back. . . . No, that’s not right: first I say: “Just let me take a little look out of the corner of my eye at these spermatozoa.” I put my headlights to the microscope. I look, and I can just barely see them. I can just make out that they really are either a People or a Nation; and every little spermatozoon is a Nikolai Nikolaevich! I think to myself: There should be a woman for each one of them, but science hasn’t thought that far yet. Okay, this is when the academician comes over to me and says: “Nikolai, my boy, try to get hold of yourself! Please don’t bellow, and don’t roar during orgasm. There’s already a rumor spreading that we’re conducting vivisections here at the institute. Don’t you know what difficult times we’re living in? We geneticists are five minutes short of being enemies of the people. Yes! Not friends, but enemies. You must get a grip on yourself! It’s difficult, I know, but you must. Try gnashing your teeth instead.” “That I can’t do. When you gnash your teeth, you get tapeworms in your intestines.” “Who told you that, my dear boy?” “Mommy used to tell me that.” “Kimza! Toss this idea out to Lepeshinskaya.4 Her boys should try gritting their teeth and see if they get spontaneous generation of tapeworms in their rectums. According to the theory of probability, success is guaranteed. Even better: shove prosthetic teeth up their asses. . . . Charlatans! Barbarians! Parasites! Enemies of the people!” At this point, the academician starts coughing. His eyes bulge, he turns white as a sheet, and he starts to shake as if he’s about to flop onto the floor. I grab hold of him: “Don’t shit your pants, Pops,” I say, Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 29\n\n30 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n“fuck it all up the ass, spit on the sun as if it’s an iron, and smooth out the wrinkles with your left hand.” The academician begins to laugh and kisses me. “Thanks for the good, living word. I won’t shit my pants. I won’t. Lepishinskaya’s gang won’t live so long. Let those who are unjust shit their pants!” (He added this in Latin.) At this point, Kimza fetched some alcohol from the safe. I brought out a snack from my donor’s allowance, and we all drank to the success of science. The academician got drunk and started shouting that now it wouldn’t be so terrible if there were a worldwide catastrophe. If there were a complete fuck-up and everything started mutating, then my sperm would be there to generate a new, healthy human species on another planet, and the intellect, that will come with time, if humanity even needs it at all—because really, my friend, what the fuck is the intellect for? What’s the point of intelligence? If only you could have seen how those academicians were devouring one another whole, without salt, the bastards (although they did spit out the buttons). What’s the international situation? A total fuck-up! That’s what it is! You can bet that wild beasts—lions, jackals, even sharks—don’t have an international situation, but human beings do, and it’s all on account of our intelligence. All right, excuse the lecture. Drink up! Radiation, that fucking whore! Do you know how many of us have become impotent on account of radiation? It’s a good thing I’m immune to her—the damned bitch!\n\n07\n\nI\n\narrive at work the next day, or, I mean, the day after Sunday. I lie down on the little sofa inside my cubicle . . . but I can’t get my dick to stand up. I grind away, grind away, but it just won’t stand up. It’s really gotten out of hand, gotten spoiled, the little snake! The problem is simple: all day Sunday I dreamed about Vlada Yurevna. I fantasized about her, held erotic séances, fell in love with her—I couldn’t fucking resist. But now it’s time to start work. Kimza roars senselessly, “Attention, comrades, orgasm!” I’m getting nervous again. Vlada Yurevna explains to me that some sort of dynamic stereotype has formed in my head, so she will have to intervene again. I almost come just hearing her say this. Then she sits down right next to me, my friend, and with her little fingers she takes hold of it. Ahhhhhhh!! I close my eyes and go flying off to the netherworld. . . . I grit my teeth (to hell with the tapeworms). Again, someone’s pounding diamond nails into my spine with a silver hammer . . . one after the other. Ahhhhh! So fucking good! So fucking good! So fucking good! And it’s not blood that’s flowing through my veins anymore—it’s music. Would you believe it, the nails on my hands and feet start to itch so badly, I’m like a cat in heat. I just\n\n32 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nwant to scratch and scratch, and rip everything to bits. Have you ever been hit by an electric current? Three hundred eighty volts, amps up to your dick and beyond, alternating current? I’ve been hit like that. But that’s shit compared to what happens when your orgasm is in the hands of Vlada Yurevna. Twenty flashes of lightning strike you between the major hemispheres (not of the ass, you idiot, of the brain). And that’s it! All that’s left of you after that is golden steam: you’ve evaporated into quivering droplets. It’s scary to think that all twenty of your pink lightning bolts have dissipated forever. It turns out, I’ve been roaring again, I’ve fallen off into the abyss. Kimza bursts in. He’s rabid, all white, foaming at the mouth, stammering, he can’t come out with anything that makes any sense. Vlada says to him, as she’s wiping her hands off with alcohol: “We will pursue our experiments to the end, Anatoly Magomedovich. Do not abandon the scholarly bearing that suits you so well. If Nikolai screams during orgasm, it means his psychic parameters have been sharply altered, and the braking mechanisms are out of control. This is the underlying problem. What’s needed, I believe, is an isolation vacuum chamber. You must order the latest electronic instruments to go with it.” You should have seen her when she said this: her soft, strawberryblond hair, her peaceful green eyes, and no whorishness on her face. The bitch is a complete mystery, that’s all there is to it. Meanwhile, Kimza’s jaw is trembling. He looks like he’s spent the night in the doghouse. If he’d had a Mauser, he would have made a sieve out of me. I know I’m not wrong about that! I’m no amateur. I’ve been coming on stealthily like a Magadan lynx, and I think to myself, fuck work, since I’m in love and a second stag has appeared on the blue horizon.\n\n“And you, Nikolai,” Vlada Yurevna says to me, “I ask you please to abstain from drink, not a single gram for the next two weeks—lest time be wasted during masturbation. We have so little time. They’re about to break up the lab.” My darling Vlada says this, and leaves the room. Then I say to Kimza: “Why were you so pissed off? If it irritates you so much, I’ll stick a gag in my mouth.” “Can’t you manage without a gag?” “Why don’t you give it a try yourself,” I say. Again he turns white, but doesn’t say anything. Meanwhile I was making Napoleonic plans. Why not find out where Vlada Yurevna lives? I wait for her at the bus stop, keep my distance as people are getting off. It’s dark. She’s walking along beneath the streetlights in a caped black overcoat. Her legs are like the columns on the Bolshoi Theatre—so damned white, well proportioned, and tapering beautifully at the bottom. I’ve already got a hard-on that’s like a new felt boot. . . . I’m wearing no coat and a crappy little cap I bought at the Dubinsky Market. Somehow, I manage to bend my dick over to the left. I keep my hand in my pocket. I’m limping slightly. She’s just gone into the entranceway. I look: she’s slowly climbing the stairs. Her little knees are visible every step she takes. The fifth floor . . . she’s gone . . . and I can still see her in my mind’s eye: her leg and her knee—oh, what a knee, my friend! Suddenly a cop comes up to me and asks: “What are you staring at there, wise guy?” “What do you mean? Looking isn’t allowed?” “Take your hand out of your pocket! Make it snappy!” “Get lost! Did I pour salt on your dick or something?”\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 33\n\n34 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nAnd I think to myself: how can I take my hand out of my pocket? It will be so embarrassing. “Hands up!” the cop screams. I laugh. “I said hands up!” And (this is really true) he pulls out a pistol and puts the muzzle between my horns. I get scared, put my hands up, and my dick sticks out like I have a Maxim machine gun in my pocket. The cop gasps, shifts the muzzle so it’s pointing at my heart, and grabs hold of my dick. “What’s this?” he asks. “Squeeze it a little harder and report it to your boss. Satisfied?” “Do you have your documents?” he says, putting his gun back into its holster. “Nope, just a penis.” “Why . . . why do you have . . . a hard-on . . . out here on the street?” “I’m in love. So I have a hard-on.” “Go home, you fool. You look as ugly as a tree stump. Did you see something or somebody?” The cop cranes his neck around to see if, by chance, there’s a naked dame’s ass in the window, and then he walks away, disappointed. I sit down on the curb across the street and gaze up at Vlada Yurevna’s house. I feel like I’ve been driven crazy by a sack full of bedbugs. Love, my friend, is worse than ten years in prison. This fucker is much scarier. You’re in it for life, and you have to serve out the full term. Oh, how I was suffering! It was if someone was shoving spikes under my fingernails. And don’t think the only thing on my mind was fucking. I just wanted to go on looking at her face, pure white without whorishness, her strawberry-blond hair, her green eyes. And her hands! Nobody has hands like hers anymore. What could you compare them to? Well, imagine this: you’re standing barefoot on an iceberg, seven winds are blowing into your seven little holes\n\n(men have seven, blockhead, while women have eight. There’s only one hole more, but so much more dangerous!). A cold draft is blowing in your soul, and your life seems like someone else’s green snot (make that phlegm). You’re surrounded by a convoy of guards in white sheepskin coats, munching on roast leg of lamb (they’re burning their tongues while you’re freezing). You’re trembling, you little shit? Have a drink! Okay. Suddenly, that all just disappears—no guards, no someone else’s roast leg of lamb. Instead, there’s warm sand and palm trees, may your heart be transplanted into me. And under the palms, there are chocolate brown babes. And one of them, the fairest of all, comes over, and, free of charge, massages a whole jar of pink cream onto your balls. Not shaving cream. It’s what they put in chocolate éclairs. Pleasant? More than pleasant! You’ve been transported so quickly from one environment to another! It’s like getting transferred from the cooler to the hospital—you can’t believe it’s happening. You scream from fear, and bam, you’ve fainted again. Don’t worry, I know it’ll happen to you too someday. You’ll come across a chick like Vlada Yurevna, and you’ll pass out. You’re hotblooded: there’s quicksilver in the head of your dick. So what are you lacking? A little warmth!! You need your own legitimate ration of warmth. So why the fuck are you asking me questions about fainting? What do you think I am, a professor? You keep asking me, “Why? Why?” Fuck off! Stretch those brains of yours for a change! Actually, it’s rare for guys to pass out. It’s more common for women. What sort of women? Ordinary ones. Working women. Not just asphaltlayers, asshole! This includes cashiers and bookkeepers, women who work in the dry cleaners (the ones who take our puke-covered clothes), nursery school teachers, salesgirls (especially the ones who sell things like fruits and vegetables and ice cream in the winter), Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 35\n\n36 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nand broads from construction sites, from meat-packing plants, and from all sorts of factories and workshops. What’s it like for them? Well, she gets so fucking tired at work, all she wants to do when she gets home is grab something to eat and hit the sack. She’s freezing, her ass hurts from sitting, her hands ache, and her eyes hurt (if she’s a draftswoman). So what’s the real secret? When the husband or the lover fucks an ordinary broad like that, the sweet thing is transferred to another planet (I’ve chewed this one over with you more than once, you congenital blockhead). When a pilot changes altitude too quickly, he also feels faint. It’s the same for cosmonauts, until they’ve pulled themselves out of our stinking atmosphere. What it is, is an overload. Knock this into your stupid head. When you’re fucking, and you come, you can experience overloads that are incomprehensible to the mind and intolerable to the body. At that moment, every fucking bit of her goes up in flames—all her troubles, her aching bones, the overdue rent, that stocking that some cunt ripped on the bus (to replace them costs five rubles, which is one and a half days’ work). Let me emphasize this one more time, everything is forgotten—everything that is so fucking hard on our ordinary working girl in the course of her day. On the other hand, take something like billionairesses. Not only do they not pass out, they can’t even come—I’ll tell you that officially. Let’s analyze why. And you, you doubting Thomas, may you get a dick up your dumb-ass! I’m going to hit you right between the horns with my logic. Have you ever heard of Mussolini’s film La Dolce Vita? It shows what I’m talking about.1 Or have you read about the lives of movie stars? They get married five times on average. Do you think a woman would run from her husband if he could bring her out into outer space? If she’s dying from happiness when he’s\n\non top of her? Not on your life! Yes, our little lives are constructed in such a smart-ass way. Let’s say, for example, you’re a billionairess who’s served cockatoo for dinner every night, along with stuffed fruit drops and aardvark kebab. Let’s say you have lackeys strutting around the house in bathing trunks, and a wardrobe of fur coats like the ones in our consignment stores. And let’s say you have three cars downstairs, and in each one there’s a chauffeur, each with his tool hanging down to his knees (just call—and he’ll come running and give you a fuck). With all that superabundance, you won’t pass out. You won’t even come at all! You’ve gotten spoiled. And that’s where we get hooliganism that leads to bloodshed and light bodily injury. Sometimes the injuries are serious. She can’t come, so she starts biting the billionaire, and he, the little bastard, doesn’t scream about it: he likes it. Then he himself begins to bite her, growling with pleasure. Well, they get so sick and tired of each other, they both want to puke. Divorce. Either that, or the billionaire goes and watches some broad undress to music. Why does he watch? Here’s why. If you’re a normal guy, and a broad undresses in front of your nose (tosses her dress to the left, her slip to the right, panties in another direction, and whips off her bra), and if, while this is happening, there’s a blue spotlight shining directly on her concentrated cunt, and a pink one on her tits—I don’t know about you, pal, but I swear—may your heart be transplanted into me if I’m lying—I would run right up over all their heads onto the stage and, while the police would be twisting my arms, beating me over the head with a club, blowing a damned whistle, and spraying gas in my eyes, I’d be banging away at that striptease until I'd come. After I'd come, then you could go ahead and take me to court in a black Ford. In their court, I’d make my final statement: Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 37\n\n38 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n“Since I’ve been caught red-handed, I confess: yes, I fucked her! And rightly so! Don’t get undressed right in front of me; you’re not my wife! I’m at your service for custody pending trial!” This is how a healthy Russian man, who’s opposed to depravity, would act. Why do multimillionaires go to see striptease? Because they know it’s okay not to fuck the broad. They’re happy the law forbids them to climb up on stage. But a normal, healthy guy just wouldn’t go there because his balls would swell up so much from watching the show he’d have to walk bowlegged all the way home to the Motherland. Well, is this all clear to you now? And how do I know all this? Well, back in ʼ44, I was screwing this woman in camp. She was the wife of the director of a firewood depot. Since it was so damned hard to get firewood during the war, he was able to scrounge millions. And she, the millionaire’s wife, bit off half his dick—without extenuating circumstances. They put her in the camp, but he was given medical treatment and told: “Get yourself to the front. You’re leading a debauched life, scum, while the whole nation is shedding its blood!” So, as you see, all those millions can backfire on you. Are there any questions? Yes, I have screwed a cashier, and a dry cleaner, and a cook. You’d be better off asking me which profession I haven’t screwed. Maybe the only exception is the driver on the Annushka tram. I’ve screwed state functionaries, not just working women. Yes, I have. And they all passed out—repeatedly. Why don’t you believe in these fainting spells? Logic has never spent the night in your head! I’ll prove it. Have you ever noticed that liquid ammonia is often sold out in the pharmacies? Well, why do you think this is so? No. People don’t drink it, they smell it—it helps when you’ve fainted. And when does this happen? During orgasm!! Maybe\n\nyou’ve noticed that sometimes you can’t find cotton wool in a single drugstore? It means that all the women in those neighborhoods are starting their periods on the same day. That’s just the way it happens according to probability theory. You just have to analyze these things. Remember when you couldn’t get razor blades anywhere? That was because the Chinese were hurling pubic crabs at us across the Amur River.2 You had to shave right up to your eyebrows, and I sure as hell wasn’t about to shave my beard with the same blade I used for my balls. That’s why the stores were all sold out of blades. In a word, you have to learn to think logically. And don’t clog up my brain with any more of your shit questions! Pour me some mineral water. You’re so slow you give me heartburn. I say this, but I love you just the same. Anyway, where did we leave off? Oh, yes. I fell in love. I fucking fell in love up to my ears.\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 39\n\n08\n\nT\n\nhe next day, Kimza watched me like a wolf and didn’t talk to me. But Vlada Yurevna asked me in her gypsy voice: “Do you think you can do it by yourself today? I’ll set up the instruments.” “Of course,” I say. I lock myself in my cubicle and wait for the command: “Attention—Orgasm!” I think about Vlada Yurevna and get a hardon right away. Just then she knocks, shoves a book through the door, and advises me: “You must think of masturbation as work—you must utterly exclude the sexual element as such. Would old man Vasya be able to do his work in the morgue if he sobbed at the sight of every corpse?” Her logic convinces me. But I can’t help wondering: What would life be like if I excluded the sexual element? I wouldn’t be able to get a hard-on! However, I have faith in her. So I wank with one hand and read my book with the other. Kimza, the scum, my rival stag, knocks twice, telling me to hurry up. I tell him to go suck cock, I’m not his Mamlakat Mamayeva, I’m not left-handed, and I can’t work with both hands.1 The book I’m reading is Far from Moscow. It’s interesting. You know, I worked on that same pipeline myself.2\n\n42 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nWhat strange twists fate takes! I carry my test tube of jizm over to Vlada Yurevna. “Thank you,” she says. “Don’t leave, Nikolai. It’s time for you to become privy to the very essence of our experiments. Anatoly Magomedovich has given me permission to explain it to you. Today, in this device, we will bombard your spermatozoa with neutrons and irradiate them with gamma rays. Then, over here, in this apparatus, the IM-1, observation of the developing fetus will begin. And this is a uterus—but an artificial one. We are investigating the mutations and genetic makeup of embryos, under acute conditions of cosmic irradiation, with the goal of developing a more highly resistant human individual.” Yes, my mug was just hanging open, like yours is now. I didn’t understand a thing she was saying, but I watched. They smeared my jizz onto a thin piece of glass and put it into some sort of chamber. Then Kimza shouted: “Discharge!” And I felt scared and sorry for my jizz. Imagine! The neutrons that were bearing down on my own little Nikolai Nikolaevich sperm were going so fast—like they’re getting fucked up the ass! And they were whopping little Nikolai right between the horns. His little tail was knocked sideways! You’d have to be a sadist to feel good about such a thing! I clenched my teeth— any more of this, and I’d have to knock the shit out of the whole lab! Next, they extracted some of the jizz and looked at it under a microscope. It doesn’t know whether it’s dead or alive, and they shove it into a gas medium to stimulate activity. Then they separated one spermatozoon from its relatives and placed it into the artificial uterus. Oh Lord, I think, where have we strayed when we resort to such complexities? Who thought up this science? I’d be better off picking pockets on the Bukashka trolleybus or the Annushka tram.\n\nWhat really got to me was the artificial uterus. There were all sorts of hoses hanging out of it, and wires. It was shiny. Its indicator arrows were darting back and forth. It was blinking its little lights, the bitch! And four women lab assistants were running around it on tiptoe, each one with a uterus that was nicer than anything you could imagine—no matter how big your brain is. That’s where they put little Nikolai Nikolaevich! What if he comes out of there in nine months with his right eye knocked out by a neutron, with crooked legs and one back shorter than the other? And what if instead of an ass, he has a pouch, like a kangaroo’s? Well? I could see this shit was really getting to me. At this point, Vlada Yurevna asked: “Were you thinking about something, Nikolai?” “Well, yes. I’m doing some thinking on my own about progress.” I say this with both headlights fixed on her. My heart’s pounding, my legs are giving way under me, I’m short of breath. It’s love! Calamity! That same evening I grab some alcohol and snacks and go for a consultation with the international thief. “It’s thus and so,” I say, “so what should I do?” “With that tarpaulin mug of yours, you shouldn’t try to crash the genuine-leather crowd. You’ll contract a hernia and your bare ass will get knocked up onto their painted fence. Forget love, remember your Mama.” “Go suck cock at low speed,” I say. “Good answer. Well put! If they’d give us answers like that in the State Welfare Department, we wouldn’t have such a problem with bureaucratic logjams. They’re taking forever to get me my pension. They don’t have a kopeck’s worth of patriotic feeling.” I knew the thief was angling for a disability pension. You could see he was starting to think, and that was getting him depressed. Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 43\n\n44 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nSo I took off for home. My soul felt rotten. I was thinking to myself: “Maybe it’s time to do some time and hibernate for the winter in Taganka—sit out this entire love affair.”3 I didn’t have the strength for it. It didn’t occur to me to question whether Vlada Yurevna had a husband. I didn’t give a shit about that! My eyes were popping out of my head, and remember, this wasn’t a sexual problem I was having. Try to think on a higher plane. I didn’t sleep the whole night. I paced back and forth, pouring water over my head from the faucet. I even knocked on Kimza’s door. But he didn’t let me in. Maybe he was asleep? I couldn’t wait for morning to come. As if out of spite, my clock stopped. So I came running into work late the next morning, and everybody in the lab was congratulating Vlada Yurevna for something. She was shaking hands with people, holding a bouquet of flowers, nodding her head like a princess. And when she saw me from her position on high, she came over to me and gave me a little flower. Kimza, I noticed, was weeping quietly, tears streaming down his face. “Nikolai,” she says, “this is a holiday for you too, in a way.” My jaw just drops. It turns out: Vlada Yurevna has gotten pregnant from me—the first ever artificial pregnancy (I don’t remember whether it was first in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic or first in the whole world). “How? How?” you ask. God, what an idiot you are. If your ears were horns, the only thing you could hang on them would be crusty undies. A hat would be too great an honor. Have you ever gone on a hunger strike? I did once. They had to feed me artificially through my ass. Those citizen-bosses had a hard time with it! Just when they’d get the tube full of cream of wheat inserted, I’d fart; and they’d be covered from head to toe. They’d kick me in the ribs with their boots and stomp on my stomach to release the\n\ngases, and, again, they’d shove some sort of kasha or a soup course— I don’t remember which—up the tube. And, again, I’d suck in and scream at them: “Get away or I’ll hit you again!” And then I’d blow them away. Where I got the farts from, I can’t imagine. Maybe from voluntarism. Or maybe from my soul of steel.4 Would you believe: they transferred me from the Kazan Prison to Taganka—just what I’d been aiming for. So I lost a little weight—that’s all. In short, Kimza had inserted a tube into Vlada Yurevna, and my Nikolai Nikolaevich had danced his way along this tube to his rightful place. That’s the kind of weird bitch of a situation I suddenly find myself in. I don’t know how to act or what to say. I feel like I’m about to go crazy. I should be feeling happy, like the future papa. I should be hugging and kissing the mother of my own child. But instead I feel sad. I think to myself, “Biology, you motherfucker, if only I’d lived a hundred years ago, before you were around!” I feel like I’m about to go crazy, I look at Vlada Yurevna. There she is, just one step separates us, but there’s no way to step across. Not a single vein is trembling in Vlada’s face, not so much as a capillary. A sphinx. A mystery. She seems to possess some secret knowledge that the rest of us will never unlock, even if we put a jackhammer to our temples. As I’m trying to get my psychics under control, Vlada says to me, “Don’t be upset, Nikolai, don’t you worry about a thing. If all goes well, you will name him. I can understand what you’re going through. . . . This is all a bit sad. But science is science.”\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 45\n\n09\n\nT\n\no keep from crying, I go into my little cubicle, lie down, and daydream about Vlada Yurevna (prison bunks had gotten me used to this manner of arousal). I masturbate and read Far from Moscow. Suddenly there’s a commotion in the lab outside my door. I jerk off quick into my test tube, and take it with me as I leave my cubicle. Damned if there isn’t an entire fucking delegation standing out there: the Deputy Director, the Party Committee, the Head of Personnel, and a bunch of people who aren’t from biology. They’re reading out an official order to Kimza. The laboratory is to be eliminated. He and Vlada Yurevna are to be fired. The lab assistants will be transferred to being cleaning ladies, and I will be put on trial. Can you fucking believe it? The charges are misrepresentation, absenteeism, and engaging in onanism, not in keeping with the normal duties of a technical consultant. They’re stripping me of the money I got from being registered as a cleaning lady, and they’re freezing my wages until the trial. So there I stand with jizz in hand, and there I remain standing. I twitch my eyelashes, wondering which article they’ll nail me with, and in no time at all, I’ve come up with the answer: Article 109—abuse of official\n\n48 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nposition, section 1. The Deputy Director continues to read out the charges—something about sabotage in the biological sciences, and about how Lysenko has unmasked the saboteurs on grounds of imperialism-Mendelism and Cosmopolitanism.1 I try to sniff out what’s going on. It’s beginning to smell like my own fate is weighing heavily upon me: my fate smells raw, like moist autumn leaves lying on top of a pile of year-old dog shit. “There he is! Look at him!” says the Deputy Director, poking his finger at me. “Look what kind of helpers our godforsaken scholars have stooped to hire. They so like to present themselves as representatives of pure science! Pure science should be done with clean hands, ladies and gentlemen, Mendelist-Morganists!” My jaw just drops when I hear this. This is the final fuck-up, I think. Now, on top of my own fate, I can smell the stink of other people’s politics. Right then, I decide to have a deaf-and-dumb fit. I don’t know this Mendel guy. So, when they take me in for the lineup, I’ll say, “This is the first time I’ve seen him, and friends like these I exterminate with Politania, the way I do with crotchcrabs.” As for Morganism, I’ll tell the investigating prosecutor I’ve never set foot in a morgue and never will, so I wouldn’t know who’s fucked the corpses and who hasn’t. Try anything else, but you bastards aren’t going to nail me for Morganism! They hit you with more time for that than for live rape! Don’t ask me why, pal, ask the prosecutor, since you only have one convolution, and it’s in your ass, not your brain, and it’s not even a convolution, just a straight line. Stop interrupting, you shameful lout. Have another snort and listen. This is when the academician comes running in, screaming: “You are the ones who are the obscurantists!” Then the Deputy Director\n\ngrabs a crowbar from the boilerman, takes a full swing at the artificial cunt, and smashes it to bits. He says, “No use squandering the people’s finances on such wasteful contraptions!” And he rips the jizz out of my hands, the snake, and tosses it out the window. I conclude from this that he’s no longer the Deputy Director, he’s Director of the whole fucking institute! And I’m right. Kimza suddenly starts to laugh. So does the academician. Vlada Yurevna begins to smile, and the whole premises fills up with a huge crowd of people—up to your prick. The academician roars: “Monkeys! Troglodytes! You should be ashamed of your own genes!” But the Deputy Director cuts him off: “I beg your pardon. We don’t have those. We have cells, not genes! Do you acknowledge your mistakes?” Then they composed a welcoming speech for a certain person, subscribed to a state bond, and dragged me off to a meeting of the Academic Council.2 That’s when another sort of fate began for me— they were cleaning the dog shit out from under the autumn leaves. I was digging it out myself with my own hands. But let me tell it from the beginning. First, they sat me down at a conference table and grilled me. They said they’d ask me some questions, and the more truth I told, the better it’d be for me in my position as simple intelligentsia victim of the saboteurs of biology. The Deputy Director began with the question: “What was the relationship between Kimza and Vlada Yurevna Molodina? Did he write her dissertation; and were they ever left alone?” But I’ve got to tell it in the order it happened, so I’ll act out the whole interrogation: “Their relationship was scientific. They didn’t get it on in my presence.” Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 49\n\n50 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\n“Is it true that the academician said Lepeshinskaya’s coworkers only pollute the air?” “I don’t remember. Everyone pollutes the air. Some come right out with it, others do it on the sly.” “Have you allowed yourself to make insulting analogies with reference to Mamlakat Mamayeva?” “No, never. I’ve admired her since childhood. I have her portrait.” (I realize immediately that one of the lab assistants has squealed. It has to be Valya—that bitch!). “Kimza promised you part of the Nobel Prize, didn’t he?” “No.” “Who made the gloomy prognosis with regard to the future of our planet?” “I don’t remember.” “How did you react to the bombardment of your sperm with protons, neutrons, and electrons?” “Compassionately.” “Did Kimza promise to make you the progenitor of a future human race?” “Why the fuck would I need that?” I yell. “Are you trying to make me out to be the prime suspect here?” “Don’t curse. We understand that you’ve been victimized. What did the academician say about Stalin’s definition of ‘nation’?” “In my opinion, all nationalities are fine as long as they don’t give false testimony in court. It doesn’t matter whether they’re kikes or Tatars.” “Why did you scream repeatedly? Was it painful for you?” “On the contrary, it was pleasant.” “Did they ever suggest that you undergo vivisection?”\n\n“No, not once.” “Do you know what vivisection is?” “First time I’ve heard of it.” “What exactly was your . . . your occupation?” “My job was to wank off and donate my sperm. I don’t know any more than that. I acted upon the command: ‘Attention—Orgasm!’ Whenever I heard that command, I switched on the skin piston.” “What was your coworkers’ attitude to Mendel?” “Exceptionally bad. Nelya even said that during the war, the Mendels gave bribes to the Uzbeks in Tashkent, so the Uzbeks were sent instead of them to some place called Auschwitz. And she said they were lazy. They don’t wage war, but are happy to give themselves up to be killed.” “Who advocated Morganism?” At this point, I realize they’ve arrived at the most important part of the interrogation, and I recall what Vlada Yurevna said: “What would happen, Nikolai, if old man Vasya were to sob over every corpse in the morgue?” So I quickly try to cover up, saying, “What’s Morganism?” “You’re better off not knowing. Who spoke respectfully of the Cosmopolitans?” “Who are they? That’s the first time I’ve heard of them.” “They’re degenerates! People for whom borders do not exist.” Fuck, I think, I’ll have to warn the international thief about this tonight. “How long was your workday, and how much alcohol did you receive for your work activity?” Well, I think to myself, it’s time to take extreme measures. Time to fake a fit. So I start to tremble, hold my breath until I turn blue. Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n\\ 51\n\n52 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nThen I run to the other end of the table and heave a whole bottle of ink right into the Deputy Director’s mug (the bottle’s shaped like a globe). I fucking heave it, and go straight into my epileptic fit routine. I fall down, growl, and make myself foam at the mouth. I start kicking with my legs and manage to smash the Head of Personnel in the balls. Someone yells: “Pull his tongue out of his mouth or he’ll choke! Shove something metal between his teeth!!” Then someone shoves a pocket watch between my teeth. I move my jaw, and it stops ticking. I roll my eyes senselessly. My epilepsy was first class, good enough for the Maly Theatre. Idiot that I am, I overdid it and smashed the back of my head against the table leg. Little by little, I quieted down. Next thing I know, they’re holding a meeting in a circle around me about how to keep from airing their dirty laundry in public (giving the West food for propaganda). They call an ambulance. “This I never expected from my ex-wife,” says the Deputy Director (whose whole mug and shirt are covered with ink), “although I did guess correctly about her affair with Kimza. She’s nothing but a petty pervert. As of today, we are divorced.” When I heard him say that, I almost jumped right up off the floor—but I managed to restrain myself. Meanwhile (you can call the ambulance when you’re dying and it won’t show up), I thrashed around for a while longer, and then I quieted down, saying: “Waterr-r! Where am I?” For some reason, I’m spitting ink myself, and violet foam is oozing from my lips. I stagger around as if I’m hurting all over. To calm me down, they promise they’ll find work for me, and they get me some water. Then they ask me to write up a statement about Kimza, and to remember whether or not he brought a camera to the experiments (the ambulance never did come). In general, they’re shitting their pants, all on account of me.\n\n10\n\nA\n\ns soon as I’m out the door of the institute, I grab a taxi and take off for Vlada Yurevna’s place. My head is pounding and I’m thinking, “Holy shit! She’s his wife!! Holy shit! The four-eyed bastard! Too bad that inkwell was shaped like a globe and our planet Earth is not a square cube! How I wish I’d smashed him with the sharp corner, the louse, from the temple to the hypothalamus! How can he spread around such garbage about the best woman in the world? ‘Petty pervert’!” As we’re approaching her building, I’m thinking, “Damn them all,” and I say to the driver: “Stay here and wait.” I find her apartment on my own, and I ring the bell. Vlada Yurevna herself opens the door. Thank you, oh Lord! “Nikolai, why is your face all covered in ink?” “Your former husband interrogated me. But I didn’t break. I didn’t betray anyone.” “Ah, so he’s already managed to publicly repudiate me—the Mendelist-Morganist? Come in. As for me, I’m about to leave. I’ve already packed.”\n\n54 \\\n\nNikolai Nikolaevich\n\nIn short, I don’t hold back, and I say: “Let’s go to my place—don’t get me wrong—I live alone, but I can hang out at my friend’s place, and you can make yourself at home at my place!” “Okay, let’s go,” she says, “but you know, you and Tolya (Kimza) live in the same communal apartment . . .” “Well, what of it?” I yell, already clutching her suitcase by the throat. I was living alone at the time. They’d collared my aunt about six months earlier. You may remember, the Passport Office was fucking her, and through him, she was arranging residence permits for people—for big money. But she got busted. One of the people she registered turned out to be a spy. And these scum are not like the rest of us, who go down the long road of interrogation not remembering a thing. He broke down and squealed on my aunt. “Grandpa grabbed the radish, grandma grabbed grandpa . . .” as the folktale goes. So my aunt squealed on her man, and he spilled the beans. They shook the apple tree, and all the people who’d gotten their residence permits through her were evicted (by the way, I send my aunt parcels every month, and money too: I’ll be damned if I’ll ever leave her in need). So there we are, Vlada and I, riding along in the taxi, she’s wiping the ink off my face with some cotton, and I’ve got a hard-on from happiness. This was the first tim"
