        "text": "As SPECTOBER IV draws to a close, we invite you to once again bunker down in the Goth Bodega for the 4th Annual Spectacle Shriek Show horror marathon! Starting at noon on Saturday, October 25th we’ll be presenting 7 features (not to mention spooky tunes, trailers, shorts, and more!) over the course of the next 12 or 14 or so hours to chill you to your very marrow! This years line-up is the craziest yet and features films from the 60’s to 2014! As always it’s $25 for the entire day or $5 each film if you are too much of a scared little baby to hang out the whole time.\n\nNoon – NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965)\n\n2:00 PM – SLASH DANCE (1989)\n\n3:30 PM – MONDO MAGIC presented by Massacre Video (1975)\n\n5:30 PM – KOLOBOS (1999)\n\n7:30 PM – MARLEY’S REVENGE: THE MONSTER MOVIE presented by Horror Boobs (1989)\n\n10:00 PM – THE STRANGE COLOR OF YOUR BODY’S TEARS (2014)\n\nMidnight – BURIAL GROUND: THE NIGHTS OF TERROR (1981)\n\n$5 for individual films! $25 for the whole day!\n\n*****BUY TICKETS HERE*****\n\nNIGHTMARE CASTLE\n\n(aka: GLI AMANTI D’OLTRETOMBA, THE FACELESS MONSTER)\n\nDir. Mario Caiano, 1965\n\nItaly, 104 min.\n\nDubbed in English\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 25 – NOON\n\n“You don’t know the hate I have inside, if you could see it you’d be terrified.”\n\nWhen a vicious count catches his wife Muriel (played the lovely Barbara Steele) being unfaithful, he tortures her and her lover and eventually cuts out their hearts. Things get even dicier (if you can believe it) when the count discovers that he can’t even get any of that sweet murder money as his wife has left everything to her sister Jenny (*also* played by the lovely Barbara Steele) who is currently in a mental institution. Not one to be out-crazied even from the beyond the grave, the count marries the sister and settles in for a nice quiet life. Naturally, the sister begins seeing visions and experiences terrible night hauntings. The ghosts of the murdered Muriel and her lover have returned and the only way to end the terror is to DESTROY THEIR HEARTS!\n\nFirst released in Italy and then subsequently released in butchered versions all over the world under various titles and runtimes NIGHTMARE CASTLE gained steam as a late night cult favorite due in no small part to the presence of Barbara Steele (last seen in our humble theater as part of SPECTOB3R in THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH) and the atmospheric cinematography of Enzo Barboni. Spectacle kicks off our 4th year with this gothic classic!\n\nSLASH DANCE\n\nDir. James Shyman, 1989\n\nUSA, 83 min.\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 25 – 2:00 PM\n\n“SLASHDANCE has the sad atmospherics of a McDonald’s employee training tape.” – Joseph A. Ziemba, Bleeding Skull\n\nAn undercover lady cop (played by G.L.O.W. star “Americana”) gets *in too deep* as she tracks a hooded murderer with a saw in a theater who is picking off members of the troupe. That’s pretty much it, you get the idea.\n\nWhile doing it’s best to ape the likes of DEATH SPA, KILLER WORKOUT, and even STAGE FRIGHT: AQUARIUS (a Spectacle favorite) this late 80’s slasher is at it’s heart a spandex clad PHANTOM OF THE OPERA ripoff and perfect for a mid-afternoon chuckle. Though it packs about 1/10th of the punch of the films it desperately tries to emulate, it does feature some strange cameos and a death by high heeled shoe. If you bring the nachos, this film brings the cheese.\n\nMassacre Video presents: MONDO MAGIC\n\n(aka: MAGIA NUDA)\n\nDir. Alfredo Castiglioni, 1975\n\nItaly, 99 min.\n\nIn Italian w/ English subtitles\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 25 – 3:30 PM\n\n“One of the bloodiest and most sever pictures of its genre, MONDO MAGIC made even it’s own distributors, Carl Peppercorn and Irving Worsmer, want to vomit.” – Bill Landis, Sleazoid Express\n\nMONDO MAGIC – more daring than MONDO CANE, more shocking than AFRICA BLOOD AND GUTS.\n\nJourney into a world of primitive African tribes, Indian faith healers, and Amazonian hunters. Witness their barbaric rituals and brutal sexual rites. Enter civilizations where gruesome acts of magic are the cornerstones of their cultures. MONDO MAGIC is a horrifying testimonial to the brutality of man, black and white. Not even your bloodiest nightmares can prepare you for MONDO MAGIC, because MONDO MAGIC is real!\n\nSince the very first Spectacle Shriek Show, our pals at Massacre have had a huge presence in every line-up – 555, DEMON QUEEN, THE ABOMINATION – and this year is no different as they bring us what is without a doubt one of the most jaw-dropping and shocking films of all time! Made during the fevered height of the “Mondo” films craze in the 70’s, this shockumentary changed the game and rocked 42nd street audiences to their core. Not to be missed.\n\nKOLOBOS\n\nDir. Daniel Liatowitsch & David Todd Ocvirk, 1999\n\nUSA, 84 min.\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 25 – 5:30 PM\n\nFive strangers agree to live in a lavish house together under constant video surveillance, supposedly for an “experimental film”. The first night unfolds along the lines of any Real World episode, with the attendant personality clashes and flirtations – that is, until blades shoot out of the kitchen appliances, disemboweling Tina, the spastic raver girl, just as the doors and windows slam shut, trapping the survivors. With even more senselessly brutal deaths awaiting them in every booby-trapped room, they turn on each other, eventually uniting their suspicions against their most unstable housemate, artist/mental patient Kyra (who can’t find her pills). But Kyra frantically warns them of a mysterious man she glimpsed on TV slicing his own face off with a razor blade while cackling and chanting “Kolobos…today…I…exist…”\n\nHorror films with a Big Brother-inspired reality TV premise would eventually emerge as a familiar trope in the early aughts with films like MY LITTLE EYE and SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS but KOLOBOS predated all of them, completed months before Big Brother itself debuted in the US.\n\nUncommonly for a direct-to-video slasher film, KOLOBOS’S main source of inspiration is Dario Argento, and it is an impassioned tribute indeed, with hyper-gruesome practical effects, set-piece murders, expressionistic lighting, surrealistic logic and an effectively Goblin-esque knock-off score. Loaded also with overt references to Fulci, Bava and early Carpenter, KOLOBOS is one of the earliest explicit odes to 80s horror, even as some of its ghostly phantom effects anticipated films like RINGU and DARK WATER. KOLOBOS is truly an under-appreciated and ahead-of-its-time horror film awaiting rediscovery.\n\nFirst screened at Spectacle back in May in celebration of it’s 15th Anniversary KOLOBOS fits nicely in what ended up being a very Italian-centric marathon this year while also breaking the mold and making a space all its own.\n\nHorror Boobs presents: MARLEY’S REVENGE: THE MONSTER MOVIE\n\nDir. Jet Eller, 1989\n\nUSA, 83 min.\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 25 – 7:30 PM\n\n“I don’t know about you, man, but I’m still huuuuungry.”\n\nTwo bozos get picked up by a gang of vigilantes out to scrub the streets of scum after mistaking the men for drug smugglers. The problem is – they’re actually smuggling in their aunt and uncle. The four are whisked away to the local island where they murder all the other drug smugglers. You know what though? None of this even matters because once they get to the island – things get really out of hand. Zombies rise from the grave, a giant hell monster shows up, and the vigilantes aren’t too pleased either? How will anyone escape this island alive?\n\nAnother marathon mainstay and VHS monolith – Horror Boobs has been providing not only marathon fare but midnight fodder at Spectacle for over a decade!* This years entry is…well, something special indeed. With the Spectacle Shriek Show in full swing this will be the proverbial “third bowl of porridge” to your melted brain.\n\nTHE STRANGE COLOR OF YOUR BODY’S TEARS\n\n(aka: L’ETRANGE COULEUR DES LARMES DE TON CORPS)\n\nDir. Hélène Cattet & Bruno Forzani, 2013\n\nBelgium, 102 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 25 – 10:00 PM\n\n“I was amazed with the strange colors of this film!” – mario_c, IMDb user\n\nFrom directing duo Hélène Cattet & Bruno Forzani (AMER), comes this homage to the masters of classic Italian Giallo horror. Dan returns home to find his wife is missing. With no signs of struggle or break-in and with no help from the police, Dan’s search for answers leads him down a psychosexual rabbit hole. THE STRANGE COLOR OF YOUR BODY’S TEARS is a bloody and taut fantasia of suspense that leaves the viewer entranced in this highly original erotic thriller.\n\nAs this years line-up reaches a boiling point, Spectacle is proud to present this visual symphony, this auditory feast, as our penultimate film this year. If you didn’t catch it while it was here a few months ago, now is your chance. A beautiful, unsettling work that begs to be seen.\n\nBURIAL GROUND: THE NIGHTS OF TERROR\n\n(aka: LE NOTTE DEL TERRORE, ZOMBIE III)\n\nDir. Andrea Bianchi, 1981\n\nItaly, 85 min.\n\nDubbed in English\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 25 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“The gore is heavy, the violence untamed, and frustrations are augmented\n\nrather than relieved.” – Dan Dendle, The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia\n\nThree groups of couples arrive at a stately villa to visit their friend, a professor, who has (unbeknownst to them) recently been killed by the zombies he elected to raise from the dead. As the reanimated corpses converge on the tasty, mortal flesh of the visitors they manage to hole up in the old mansion and fight off the rampage til the break of dawn. And it don’t stop.\n\nBURIAL GROUND is true to it’s roots – an Italian gut-muncher that even works in a skewered eyeball for good measure. Some edits were even passed off as ZOMBIE III to unsuspecting theater goers. The perfect nightcap to this year’s festivities and just in time for the witching hour. Be on the lookout for a small role by Massacre Video’s own Louis Justin in the background! Blink and you’ll miss him!\n\nONE (LONG) WEEKEND(ISH) ONLY – OCTOBER 16 – 22\n\nFollowing the success of last year’s inaugural REMIX TO COGNITION series, we present to you its sequel – REMIX 2 COGNITION. What better way to describe this experience than to resurrect and edit last year’s text?\n\nREMIX 2 COGNITION is a long-weekend serving of work that was conceived by/associated with Spectacle Theater’s all-volunteer staff roster, with a focus on the repurposed and remodeled. 100% of ticket profits and donations go directly to supporting the space.\n\nIn its four years, Spectacle has often functioned as a creative space, offering its screen to amateur and established editor-filmmaker-curators as a means of exploring new ways of engaging with the moving image. Evoking the traditions of New York arthouses, third-world videotheques, and the high school stoner basement, Spectacle has never shied away from dismantling the cinematic canon, puzzling at its the parts, and feverishly reassembling, hoping Dad doesn’t notice. Since the cinematic form’s inception, artists have drawn inspiration from rejiggering the constituent parts of the apparatus. In recent years, international video sharing, increased bandwidth, and the ready proliferation of digital moviemaking tools have all provided unprecedented material, accessibility, and ease – of making movies like WORLD WAR Z totally new and better.\n\nLikewise, though Big Cinema exhibition is not likely to be outpaced for long, we are presently at a moment where the gap in audience-perceived quality between a $152,550 D-Cinema system and a “prosumer” enthusiast purchase is relatively small. Therefore, as we have crested the digital conversion, DIY HD remixes are capable of carrying as much screen-authority as the video content projected at hallowed cinema grounds; simultaneously the textures of “obsolete” video mediums are now a prized ingredient in the visual stew. When interviewed by intrepid boy-reporter Keanu Reeves in the 2012 documentary SIDE-BY-SIDE, Fox Filmed Entertainment CEO Tom Rothman portentously cautions that we are entering an era in which “anyone can make a movie.” REMIX 2 COGNITION is probably what he’s sad about. Join us in salting the wound.\n\nTHE LINEUP\n\nSHR INK MAN: A LIVE SCORE BY MIL KDU DES AND LOUIS PIQUETTE\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 16 – 8 and 10 PM\n\nSTRONG–THING (b/w TENDER PREY)\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 17 – 8 and 10 PM\n\nSOUTH THIRD STREET FOREVER: AIM FOR THE TRASH CAN\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 17 – MIDNIGHT\n\n***CANCELLED*** PARIS GROUP INTERNATIONAL PRESENTS P3: PASSION, POWER, AND PROFIT\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 18 – 7:30 PM ***CANCELLED***\n\nYOUR GENIUS ON THE BIG SCREEN: A SPECTACLE GROUP SHOW\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 18 – 10 PM\n\nTHE SIMPSONSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 18 – MIDNIGHT\n\nANTI-BANALITY UNION PRESENTS: STATE OF EMERGENCE\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 19 – 8 and 10 PM\n\nSPED: A LIVE SCORE BY SCRIMPY\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22 – 8 and 10 PM\n\n======RRRRRRR222222CCCCCC======\n\nSHR INK MAN\n\nEdited by Louis Piquette, Live Music by MIL KDU DES, 2014\n\nUSA, 42 min.\n\nTHURSDAY OCTOBER 16 – 8 and 10 PM\n\nMIL KDU DES (aka Mark Freado Jr. and Steve Pellegrino, with the hired bow of Erin Routson), having previously live-scored UNIVERSE: I SEE NO GOD UP HERE, and THE SOUND STAGE MASSACRE (based on the cult Italian horror gem STAGE FRIGHT: AQUARIUS), will tackle SHR INK MAN, a melancholic re-imagining of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN. In addition to the milky walls of Spectacle, MIL KDU DES have also hauled a s s e s to the Cinefamily in LA, and the Museum of Arts and Design in NYC.\n\nFirst premiered during Spectacle Theater’s residency in the abovementioned museum’s NYC Makers: A MAD Biennial, Louis Piquette’s edit on SHR INK MAN directs the live score as an added monstrous presence, threatening the cinematic walls of diegesis. As the titular protagonist inversely scales to the increasing size of his troubles, MIL KDU DES paws and nibbles at, and then eventually swallows the entire soundtrack from the original film.\n\n======RRRRRRR222222CCCCCC======\n\nSTRONG-THING and TENDER PREY\n\nby H.A. Campbell & Jon Dieringer\n\nFRIDAY OCTOBER 17 – 8 PM and 10 PM\n\nFollowing its explosive premiere at The Museum of Arts and Design this summer, STRONG-THING flexes its guns at Spectacle alongside the premiere of TENDER PREY, a harrowing parable about the toxic atmosphere of pedophilia in Hollywood.\n\nSTRONG-THING\n\nDir. H.A. Campbell & Jon Dieringer, 2014\n\nUSA, 30 min.\n\nSTRONG-THING is a mythic meditation on the biographical, on-screen, and celebrity personae of Arnold Schwarzenegger that presents a master narrative built with material repurposed from the entire breadth of his pre-gubernatorial filmography. Hysterical, lucid, action-packed, and elegiac, the journey of the Strong-Thing from lab-engineered specimen through interplanetary exile, arrival on Earth, discovery of its means to success, and rise through the ranks of celebrity and power mirrors the parallel allegorical threads running through virtually all of Schwarzenegger’s filmography as well as his personal rise from Austrian immigrant to unlikely leading man and governor of California. Free of dialogue, STRONG-THING is a nimble work of uniquely character-driven cinematic détournement cycling through incisive narrative drive and surreal interior interludes exploring the Strong-Thing’s feelings of ambition, loss, vindictive determination, alienation, and fear. This eisegetical voyage is accompanied by sound design/composition by artist C. Spencer Yeh (Burning Star Core).\n\nTENDER PREY\n\nDir. H.A. Campbell & Jon Dieringer, 2014\n\nUSA, 14 min.\n\nTENDER PREY restructures the 1985 werewolf film SILVER BULLET, starring Corey Haim, into a parable concerning the toxic atmosphere of pedophilia surrounding child actors in Hollywood. Radically abridged and shuffled, the film now tells the story of an All-American Boy living in perpetual fear of a sexual predator, a narrative horrifically parallel to Haim’s own experience as a preteen Hollywood coverboy. Meanwhile, his guardian, Gary Busey, is portrayed as hopelessly complicit for his unresponsiveness, manifest in his repeated sublimation into alcoholic stupor. Both characters retreat into anxious fantasia as they recognize their inabilities to cope with the cycles of abuse and denial in which they are enmeshed. Juxtaposed then synthesized, unspeakable acts of on- and offscreen predation violently scratch away the veneer of child stardom.\n\n======RRRRRRR222222CCCCCC======\n\nSOUTH THIRD STREET FOREVER: AIM FOR THE TRASH CAN\n\nDir. Various, Compiled by C. Spencer Yeh, 2014\n\nUSA. 82 min.\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 17 – MIDNIGHT\n\nFollowing warm on the heels of SOUTH THIRD STREET FOREVER: APPROVED FOR ALL AUDIENCES (as seen at the Museum of Arts and Design’s NYC Makers: A MAD Biennial), a survey of custom-edited movie trailers compiled from the over-700 created since Spectacle’s scrappy beginnings, comes SOUTH THIRD STREET FOREVER: AIM FOR THE TRASH CAN. Whereas ALL AUDIENCES attempted a broad overview, strategically edited for the museum’s broad audiences, TRASH CAN kicks a 180 and lures all the nasty exploitation, howling horror, and explosive action-packed genre trailers out of the Spectacle gutter into one seamy vacation package. This 82 minute-long shitty cruise traverses all the rank detours and volatile twists and turns you might’ve missed unless you’ve spent mad N.I.S.S. (Nights In Spectacle’s Service). Spoiler alert – the calls are coming from inside the trash can and this boat never left the sewer.\n\nVarious versions of the SOUTH THIRD STREET FOREVER trailer compilations have screened at Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Film Festival, the Kinomuzeum festival at Muzeum Sztuki Nowoczesnej w Warszawie.

Aaron Schimberg, 2014\n\nUSA, 7 min.\n\n“Dr. Arthur Newman suggests that “we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking” as a means of adopting a “socially acceptable image.” Are masks really a metaphor? Can we choose the masks we wear? Can we remove our masks at will? Are these masks always socially acceptable? These questions may or may not be answered, or posed, using sound and image from two films, Peter Bogdanovich’s MASK (1985), a biopic about Rocky Dennis, an affable Southern California teenager, and Charles Russell’s THE MASK (1994), concerning the adventures of Stanley Ipkiss, a hapless bank-clerk from Edge City.”\n\nPRETY WOMAN\n\nDir.

From where does he attack? How do we distinguish him from one of our own, and how do we immunize ourselves against him?\n\nBut it’s too late for these questions. The illness that society feels victimized by has metastasized to an irreversible degree. It can’t be cured with surgery, heavy medication, or even wholesale amputation. “Stability at all costs! No life-support machine is too expensive!” But the virus is becoming stronger than its host, and its hostility is irrepressible.\n\nThe Anti-Banality Union is an amorphous pack of movie critics. The movie they never tire of criticizing is the one we all live in, and if they ever write anything, it’ll be its end credits.\n\nThe Anti-Banality Union is not a fixed collective. Everyone who has experienced enough narrative closure through Hollywood to know from the signs all around us that the story of Western Civilization is coming to an end is a member.\n\n======RRRRRRR222222CCCCCC======\n\nSPED – A LIVE SCORE BY SCRIMPY\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 22 – 8 and 10 PM\n\nSPED\n\nDir. 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, 1994–2014\n\nUSA, 50 min.\n\n“Speed is the hope of the West.”\n\n–Paul Virilio\n\nTwenty years ago, when millions flocked to see SPEED, they got there as fast as they could. Subways and cabs were too slow—people ran across the hoods of cars stuck in traffic. Imagine their disappointment when they got there: Keanu has to keep the bus going at 50 mph. Fifty!? That’s below the freeway speed limit everywhere in the USA. Without Mark Mancina’s pulsing score, we would’ve fallen asleep after the first explosion, maybe waking up for the famous leap across the void and the Benghazi-reminiscent bus-plane collision.\n\nIf SPEED thrilled viewers back then, it certainly doesn’t anymore. The smug complacency of the 90s has been replaced by a need for speed more desperate than ever, an urge to stifle the uneasiness we feel about our unstoppable momentum toward the abyss. We can’t be expected to have patience for long, slow, boring movies—we don’t have enough time left for that. French producer Marin Karmitz once said that runtimes of over 110 minutes are a sign of contempt for the viewer. At 116 minutes, SPEED is an insult.\n\nBy accelerating it to twice its original velocity, we’ve made SPEED adequate to its essence. Having banished Mancina’s orchestral deceptions, we’ll be convoyed by the electro-psychedelic warriors of Scrimpy as we rip through Los Angeles at 100 mph. “There’s enough C-4 on this thing to put a hole in the world!”\n\nFor the fourth year, Spectacle is proud to present a month-long, lovingly-selected series of unknown, mysterious, and shocking films from around the world: SPECTOBER IV.\n\nBEGOTTEN\n\nDir. E. Elias Merhige, 1990.\n\nUSA, 72 min.\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 2 – 7:30 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8 – 7:30 PM\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 20 – 10 PM\n\n“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” -John 3:16 (King James Bible)\n\nEasily one of the most singular films in the history of experimental cinema, E. Elias Merhige’s BEGOTTEN is a deeply religious, allegorical nightmare carved onto celluloid distanced from place or time, uncovering visceral, primitivist brutality that may be unparalleled in the history of the moving image.\n\n“One of the ten most important films of modern times.” -Susan Sontag\n\nDespite its near-total lack of cultural reference points, the churning, repetitive, symbolic actions of the entities depicted on-screen—all players from Merhige’s radical Theater of Material troupe—suggest a broad mythology culled from sources as widespread as ancient Egyptian apologues, disparate pagan lore and, of course, Christian allegory. There is no dialogue or traditional narrative, yet BEGOTTEN’s hypnotic aesthetic and the engrossing actions of the film’s characters—named God Killing Himself, Mother Earth and Son Of Earth, Flesh On Bone—are never anything but riveting and pointed.\n\n“…seems almost entirely self-contained, with little effort to engage an audience on even the level of moth; the film’s approach is far too grotesque for that. The experience of watching ‘Begotten’ can best be characterized as intense.” -Janet Maslin (NY Times)\n\nBEGOTTEN was painstakingly re-photographed and optically printed in order to achieve the film’s iconic chiaroscuro, famously requiring up to 10 hours of post-processing for every minute of on-screen time. Its widest mainstream exposure came long after the festival circuit and art-house run, when the aesthetically-consonant, Goth-as-fuck Marilyn Manson tapped Merhige to direct his video for the song “Cryptorchid” from the 1996 album Antichrist Superstar, a video which ended up including quite a bit of footage from BEGOTTEN directly. After this, Merhige entertained an unlikely flirtation with Hollywood and the world of commercial video, directing SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE (2000), SUSPECT: ZERO (2004) and one of the best Interpol music videos (for “The Heinrich Maneuver”… not a great song).\n\n“Evokes Alexander Sokurov and Francis Bacon as well as early David Lynch and a great many splatter films… if you’re looking to be freaked out you shouldn’t pass it up.” -Jonathan Rosenbaum (Chicago Reader)\n\n[Trigger Warning: Extended, recurring scenes of violent religious ceremony.]\n\nBLOOD THEATER\n\naka Movie House Massacre\n\nDir. Rick Sloane, 1984.\n\nUSA. 78 min.\n\nSpecial thanks to Rick Sloane\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 5 – 7:30 PM\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 12 – 5 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 30 – 7:30 PM\n\nThe staff of the Spotlight movie house is pleased to be opening their new location. That is, until they find out that every time the theater has been opened – someone gets killed. Unfortunately for these (doomed) kids, the bottom line is all that matters to their boss, and more importantly – his boss. Legacy of death aside – the show must go on!\n\nIn accordance with the unintentional Spectober tradition of having one of the films in our program take place in a movie theater (see also: ANGUISH) – the first feature from director Rick Sloane (HOBGOBLINS, HOBGOBLINS 2, MIND BODY & SOUL, etc) is peppered with strange theater related deaths, tinny synths, hilarious loudspeaker announcements, inside jokes (all the films projected in the movie theater were made by Sloane while attending school in LA), and a heaping helping of Mary Woronov <air horn>. Clocking in at just under 80 minutes, the film wastes no time establishing the set up and getting right down to business. Mary Woronov shines as the evil Miss Blackwell and relishes at the chaos around her.\n\nKing of the Witches – previous presenters for DESPERATE TEENAGE LOVEDOLLS, LOVEDOLLS SUPERSTAR, & SURVIVE – return to Spectacle for another piping hot slab of analog pie with their brand new VHS release of this video store staple. Join us for the final screening on Oct. 30th w/ KOTW in attendance with tapes, posters, and who knows what else!\n\nDON’T DELIVER US FROM EVIL\n\nDir. Joël Séria, 1971.\n\nFrance, 110 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 11 – 10 PM\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 18 – 7:30 PM\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 20 – 7:30 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 30 – 10 PM\n\n“Really about the obsessive nature of female friendship, of girls suffering a tedious, square world filled with hypocrisy and becoming hopped up by literature and the forbidden and hellfire and all the stuff that’s so intense when you’re 15, [DON’T DELIVER US FROM EVIL] is a fiendish paean to the freaky bad girl—girls who, when staring into that bland void would rather, quite literally, burn out than fade away.” – Kim Morgan, Sunset Gun\n\nSpecial thanks to Pete Tombs and Mondo Macabro\n\nOne of the great unhearalded works of early ‘70s youth rebellion, DON’T DELIVER US FROM EVIL is about a pair of upper-class parochial school BFFs who swear themselves to Satan and set out, in their own seemingly innocent way, to inflict pain and cruelty on do-gooding “idiots.” Over the course of a summer, the two have neighboring country vacation homes, and when Anne, the instigator of the two, is left on her own, her place becomes a haven for all kinds of wickedness. The girls amuse themselves with sexual intimidation of their neighbor, restaging Christ’s Carrying of the Cross with a lame groundskeeper, holding a Satanic ceremony, and seducing a married man. When they return to school, they make the ultimate statement of contempt for middle-class values.\n\nThe film is as much about hiding under the covers with flashlights and dirty books and sneaking cigs and communion wine as it is figuring out where to hide a body. It’s not difficult to imagine why the film never received US distribution: it’s not a lurid exploitation that could appeal to a grindhouse crowd, but its arthouse style and whimsy is rooted in too much anti-bourgeois perversion to appeal to sophisticated New Yorkers. (Though Amos Vogel does single it out in FILM AS A SUBVERSIVE ART.) Consider it a cross between Jean Eustache and Michael Haneke with a bit of Buñuel and Larry Clark thrown in—but one that seems uniquely attuned to its young, rebellious female protagonists. It’s a true diamond-in-the-rough.\n\nRally your best friend and check it out: this is essential bad girl viewing.\n\nTrigger warning: attempted sexual assault of a minor\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nDir. Vernon Zimmerman, 1980\n\nUSA, 102 min.\n\nSpecial thanks to Vernon Zimmerman\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 4 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 14 – 10 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 23 -10 PM\n\nEric Binford is a lonely, chain-smoking film addict eking out a meager living by delivering film canisters around LA for a small distributor. One day, he crosses paths with a Marilyn Monroe-lookalike whom he somehow gets to agree to a date. When it appears that she stands him up, his cinema-obsessed brain snaps. Transforming himself into a rotating cast of classic horror characters, Binford sets out on a killing spree to destroy his oppressors! Will a coked-out, harmonica-blasting cop be able to stop him in time?\n\nA labor of love for writer/director Vernon Zimmerman (whose credits span everything from the Terrance Malick-scripted trucker pic DEADHEAD MILES to road flick BOBBIE JO AND THE OUTLAW to roller derby gem UNHOLY ROLLERS to camp classic TEEN WITCH), this oddball early 80s effort isn’t gory enough to be a straight slasher and too weird to be a straight drama, as Dennis Christopher (BREAKING AWAY) infuses BInford with a healthy amount of depth and empathy. It feels like TAXI DRIVER crossed with an abandoned John Waters script, all the while predating the self-referential, postmodern SCREAM horror sensibilities by over 15 years.\n\nIf anything, the film-obsessed lead has a few lines that, admittedly, hit pretty close to home for some Spectacle members! And be on the lookout for a young Mickey Rourke as a bully!\n\nFEAR HAS 1000 EYES\n\nDir. Torgny Wickman, 1970\n\nSweden, 76 min.\n\nIn Swedish with English subtitles.\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 7 – 7:30 PM\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 12 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 21 – 7:30 PM\n\nThe first (and only?) Swedish erotic horror film ever made, FEAR HAS 1000 EYES isn’t the grindhouse film that title might suggest. Instead, it’s a moody, atmospheric film about the eerie relationship between Anna, her priest husband, and their friend/caretaker, who has sold her soul to the devil. Anna is pregnant, with a shadowy history of mental trouble and anxious tendencies, living with Sven in rural Sweden. Surrounded by snow and not much else, Anna’s mind runs wild, until their friend Hedvig comes to stay with them, ostensibly to care for Anna…but there are other forces at play in the household.\n\nThe film asks more questions than it answers, and the ending is explosive and enigmatic. Anita Sanders gives an appropriately blank-eyed performance as Anna, a priest’s wife trapped in the middle of nowhere. With more in common with a Bergman film than your average sex occult thriller, FEAR HAS 1000 EYES brings a sexy slow burn to SPECTOBER IV.\n\nLIZARD IN A WOMAN’S SKIN\n\nDir. Lucio Fulci, 1971\n\nItaly, 104 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 11 – 7:30 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 23 – 7:30 PM\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 28 – 7:30 PM\n\nBefore becoming renowned for orchestrating some of the nastiest gore sequences in cinema, Lucio Fulci directed a string of (still fairly gory) gialli, or lurid Italian mystery films, of which LIZARD IN A WOMAN’S SKIN is one of the finest. And though the psychedelic lounge vibe is no stranger to the genre, LIZARD is the most drug-addled orgiastic giallo trip ever conceived.\n\nIn one of her iconic performances, genre legend Florinda Bolkan plays Carol, a frustrated housewife who experiences anxious erotic dreams about dalliances with her libertine neighbor, Julia (Anita Strindberg). When one of the fantasies turns spectacularly sour and Julia appears as a corpse, Carol wakes up to learn that Julia has been actually murdered in reality under mysterious circumstances. Initially convinced of her own guilt, but then unsure, Carol is thrust into a paranoid gauntlet of drugs, sex, murder, and suicide as she, her philandering husband, and investigators all try to untangle the killer’s identity.\n\nWith it’s LSD-laced narrative and ghoulish hippies, LIZARD IN A WOMAN’S SKIN gives a whole new meaning to the phrase “death trip.” And besides being a great showcase for Bolkan, it features a number of stellar behind-the-scenes credits, including composer Ennio Morricone and special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi (E.T., ALIEN, POSSESSION), whose work on this film actually landed him in court—pegging him with the distinction of being the first special effects artist ever called before a judge to prove his effects weren’t real.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: a brief hallucinatory scene of simulated animal cruelty\n\nTHE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED\n\nDir. Lee Madden, 1971\n\nUSA, 85 min.\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 4 – 10 PM\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 13 – 7:30 PM\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 26 – 7:30 PM\n\n“Summon the AAAy-toner!”\n\nCan your soul stand the theological implications of 1971’s THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED? You get old-school 42nd Street madness with this lost exploitation flick about the dangers of uncanny Bible-quoting hippies and the generation gap.\n\nIf you hate religion, goodness gracious, do we have a flick for you! Not quite a “gem,” but certainly an object of intense fascination: THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED is an almost forgotten, “ripped from the headlines,” deliciously nasty 1970s grindhouse flick that has gotten better with age as its subtextual philosophical questions have gotten more prescient over the years.\n\nNeither the Manson-esque followers of psycho-prophet Billy Joe Harlan (a perfect Michael Sugich) nor the “Squares” who spend their last dime on religious trinkets instead of necessities, are spared: foolish Reverend Pierce has used this month’s mortgage payment on a giant wooden cross; and drug-pushing Billy Joe exults to his faithful, “They was all just a bunch of sinners…but I saved them, Lord! I showed them that using dope was the way to turn on to You!\n\nMeanwhile, Billy Joe’s hooded henchman, the Atoner (“the AAAy-toner!” shrieks the mystical nutjob in a way that will become a secret code to everyone who sees this film), lurks and slaughters for his master, like a medieval Jason Voorhies transplanted to suburban SoCal, prefiguring those killers with superhuman powers who stalked 1980s slasher pix.\n\nAfter testifying against these “Kill for Jesus” freaks because they crucified (!) her preacher husband, Fanny Pierce (former Hollywood starlet Jeanne Crain, fresh from 1967’s”youth in revolt”/drag-racing exploiter Hot Rods to Hell) finds herself in Straw Dogs territory as the incensed cultists seek holy revenge—by stalking her to a house where she’s babysitting—dig this—college students.\n\nEnlivened by beyond over-the-top performances and some extraordinary documentary-style footage of the soup kitchens of Los Angeles’ Skid Row, this is the exploitation market in overdrive, plugging into then-topical/now-dated qualms: Fear the Hippies! The Mansons are everywhere! Beware of longhairs! Christians are murderous, brainwashed loonies! Hey, wait a minute…\n\nYet with all its sleazy and grim turns, 1971’s THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED is a valid primer on the nature of guilt, earned or not—with a great twist ending (that you should just forget we ever mentioned).\n\nHelped by a breakneck—hint, hint—pace, the script that feels like something John Waters wrote, but taken absolutely seriously.\n\nWith nary a sense of irony, the movie seems too bleak and malicious to be considered “Camp,” but its overwrought earnestness means it should be seen as the epitome of such: the unselfconscious overacting, the old-fashioned Hippie-Fear, the sociological pondering of the necessity of organized religion in an age of random mass-murder and widespread unemployment—this movie seems to has faith in its own nonsense, and it’s honestly infectious—while being too cheap and slapdash to be completely believed.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, director Lee Madden also helmed the exploitation classics Hells Angels ’69 (1969; a must-see biker-heist flick starring the actual Hells Angels) and the better-than-average bikers-join-hippies-against-dune-buggies Angel Unchained (1970). Now catch his largely unseen THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED!\n\nLA PAPESSE\n\naka The High Priestess\n\nDir. Mario Mercier, 1975\n\nFrance, 95 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 7 – 10:00 PM\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 14 – 7:30 PM\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 24 – 7:30 PM\n\n“Penitence for the sinner!”\n\nNewly married Laurent is initiated into a coven led by a mysterious woman in order to learn the secrets of black magic through mental and physical struggle. Once he becomes a member, he is told he must bring his wife Aline into the fold, and as Laurent tries to convince her, Aline suffers a series of nightmares brought on by the High Priestess in order to break her resolve.\n\nSet in a desolate rocky area of rural Frances shot in beautiful Eastmancolor, the easiest comparison to make would be to the films of Jean Rollin or else to the great Morgane et ses Nymphes, yet with Mercier there’s a more malevolent feel, a sense of brutality that’s as much about leather-clad skinhead thugs as nightgown orgies. Mercier’s third and final film (after the similar EROTIC WITCHCRAFT), LA PAPESSE is as psychedelic as a Renato Polselli film, has more whippings than three Robbe-Grillet films, offers some of the most frenetic nude dancing you’ll ever see plus a great moody synth/organ/percussion score by Éric Demarsan.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: Animal Cruelty (hen sacrifice)\n\nPEONY LANTERN GHOST STORY\n\naka Kaidan botan-dôrô\n\nDir. Satsuo Yamamoto, 1968\n\nJapan, 88 min.\n\nIn Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 5 – 5 PM\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 10 – 10 PM\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 27 – 7:30 PM\n\n“August 13 is the first day of the Festival of Obon, when people honor their ancestors – and when the spirits of the dead return.”\n\nHagiwara Shinzaburou (Kôjirô Hongô) is disowned by his upper-class family for refusing to agree to a marriage of convenience. He returns to his life as a schoolteacher in a working-class village. On the first day of the Festival of Obon, he is approached by a beautiful young woman, Otsuyu, and her maid, Oyone, who impart to him their tragic tale. He falls in love with Otsuya, but his health steadily deteriorates after each tryst. Even after realizing that Otsuyu is a ghost and that the affair will soon kill him, he cannot resist her. At the insistence of the priest and his own schoolchildren, Hagiwara agrees to be locked in the village temple until the end of the Festival, but Otsuyu will not be so easily thwarted.\n\nKaidan Botan-Dôrô dates back to at least the Meiji Period. Director Yamamoto, an outspoken member of the Japanese Communist Party, infuses the ghost story, initially a Buddhist moral tale, with political substance. The film expands its focus to take in the workings of the community, and instead of a lone priest protecting Hagiwara from the ghosts, as in the original tale, the whole village is enlisted to help. Hagiwara has refused his family fortune to teach poor children, but it is greed which leads to the final tragedy.\n\nTHE SNOW WOMAN\n\naka Kaidan Yukijorô\n\nDir. Tokuzô Tanaka, 1968\n\nJapan, 79 min.\n\nIn Japanese with English subtitles\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 2 – 10 PM\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 10 – 7:30 PM\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 27 – 10 PM\n\nThe story of Yuki-Onna, the Snow Woman, who kills any man who sets his eyes upon her, is best-known to western audiences as one of the segments in Masaki Kobayashi’s 1965 portmanteau horror classic KWAIDAN. Made just three years later, Tokuzô Tanaka’s poetic and haunting feature-length interpretation adheres to the basic outline of the folk tale (which is also referenced in Kurosawa’s DREAMS), infusing it with added emotional depth and political subtext and one-upping Kobayashi’s version with some truly inspired and terrifying set-pieces.\n\nShigetomo, a master sculptor, and his apprentice Yosaku set out for the Mino Mountains to find the suitable wood from which to carve the Buddhist statue for the state temple. Caught in a blizzard, they take refuge in a hut, where the Snow Woman finds them asleep. She murders the sculptor but, struck by Yosaku’s “youth and beauty”, impulsively decides to spare him if he promises to never tell anybody what he witnessed. He returns safely to his village but soon falls in love with a new arrival named Yuki, who is really the Snow Woman disguised as a human.\n\nVIY\n\nDir. Konstantin Yershov & Georgi Kropachyov\n\n1967, 78 minutes\n\nIn Russian w/ English subs.\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 6 – 10 PM\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 24 – 10 PM\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 28 – 10 PM\n\nA young student must pray for 3 days over the body of a recently deceased woman – believed to be a witch – while her restless spirit and a gang of ghouls temp, prod, and terrorize him to no end. Based on the story (also called Viy) by Nikolai Gogol, the film boasts some excellent effects work and a beautiful score."
