        "text": "Uwe Boll‘s Event Film and German group Kinostar have taken world sales rights to Viy, a 3D fantasy epic from Russian director Oleg Stepchenko featuring Jason Flemyng (X-Men: First Class) and Game of Thrones star Charles Dance.\n\nLoosely based on the short story of the same name by Russian fantasy writer Nikolai Gogol, Viy is set in the 18th century. Cartographer Jonathan Green (Flemyng), on a trip across Europe, finds himself trapped in the dark woods of Transylvania, where a strange village, cut off from civilization, hides a dark secret. The Gogol short story has been the inspiration for several films, most famously Mario Bava‘s schlock horror classic Black Sunday (1960).\n\nPHOTOS: ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 3 Premiere: Westeros Meets Hollywood\n\nProduced by Alexey A. Petrukhin and Alexander Kulikov for Marins Group Entertainment and Russian Film Group, Viy is said to be budgeted at $75 million. The feature shot at Prague’s Barrandov studios and the Russian/German/U.K./Czech co-production is currently in post at CinePost in Munich.\n\nEvent Film will begin sales on the feature in Cannes and plans to release a first trailer for Viy later this month."
