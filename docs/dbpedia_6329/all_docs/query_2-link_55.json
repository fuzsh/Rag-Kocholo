        "text": "One bit of housekeeping about this review first: technically this is a “Soviet” film, even though Nikolai Gogol, who wrote the original story, was from Kiev and set this story there. I’m instead going to give credit where it’s deserved – Slava Ukrani.\n\nThis isn’t actually about politics or national policy anyway – rather, it’s a surprisingly fun ghost story. Khoma (Leonid Kuravlyov) and his two friends are travelers from a seminary near Kiev, heading home during their Spring Break. They’re on foot, so it’s slow going and come nightfall they are forced to ask for shelter from an old woman out in the countryside. She agrees, but insists that the three all sleep in separate places – one in the house, one in another outbuilding, and Khoma in the barn with the cows (which is only fair, since Khoma was a bit of a jerk to her). Khoma starts bedding down when the old woman suddenly joins him, staring at him meaningfully.\n\nKhoma thinks it’s a sexual come-on and tries to fend her off – but suddenly she jumps on him piggy-back and starts whipping him like a horse. And just as suddenly, Khoma is compelled to start running – faster than he is capable. Then he starts flying, the woman still on his back. Realizing she’s a witch, Khoma curses her and compels her to land – and then beats her when she does, stopping only when she magically turns into a beautiful young woman (Natalya Varley) and begs him to stop. That’s enough for Khoma – he runs all the way back to the seminary, abandoning his two friends.\n\nHowever, when Khoma gets there, the Rector of the seminary wants to see him – a rich merchant nearby has a gravely ill daughter who’s asked if someone could read prayers by her bedside. In fact, she specifically asked for Khoma himself. Khoma is thus whisked right back to the same farm, this time a bustling farmstead with a number of workers – but it’s too late, she’s just died. Her grieving father mentions that his daughter’s dying wish was for Khoma to read prayers over her corpse for three straight nights while she lies in state. Khoma glances at said corpse – and sees it’s the young woman. But there’s nothing for it – Khoma is locked up in the church that night, his lectern sitting right bang next to the coffin. And as he starts to read – her eyes open…\n\nSo this is a fun ghost story, basically. The special effects were pretty damn good for 1967, but for someone used to CGI they were a little creaky – but that helped. There’s a homespun feel to them that keeps the film from feeling too creepy. The recently-coined slang term “spoopy” feels apt; it’s trying to be scary, but for me it ended up charming. The creepiest effect was probably the appearance of the title character – a lumpy, vaguely humanoid demon with enormous eyes and even bigger eyelids, ones so big that Viy has to ask his companions to manually lift them up for him. It’s not quite as terrifying as Gogol’s depiction – an iron face, body covered in dirt, hands and legs looking like tree roots, and five-foot-long eyelids drooping down to the floor – but it’s as creepy as you could get at the time.\n\nThis feels right for a tweens’ Halloween party, strangely; just creepy enough, but with some hokiness to keep the more sensitive kids from getting too wound up.\n\nBack in my stage manager days, there was one performance of one show I worked on where everything seemed to go wrong. Someone in the cast had a stomach bug, so I had to scatter a number of strategically-placed buckets about backstage so they could dash off and tend to things quickly if need be. Part of the set broke in the middle of a scene change. We had a short in the electrical system that brought down a whole panel of lights, and the sound crapped out while our team was doing a ninja wire repair on that. Then another light rig shorted out. Someone fell over during the dance sequence. Another person blanked on their lines. A costume ripped. And on and on, in a parade of misfortune. The crew were so punch-drunk by the end of the show that when someone bumped their head on a doorframe while making their final entrance, we all just collapsed in silent giggles; one of us even grabbed a paper napkin and waved it as a flag of surrender.\n\nThis kind of relentless chaos is also plaguing the men in The Fireman’s Ball – only instead of a crew of seasoned stagehands working on a play, the characters are a team of older men in a small Czech volunteer fire department trying to hold their annual fundraising ball. They have some grand ambitions – they’ve planned a fundraising raffle, with two tables’ worth of donated prizes on display, and they also plan to present their retired chairman with a ceremonial birthday gift. And just before that presentation, they’ll have a beauty pageant, to ensure that the prettiest girl there will be the one to formally present their chairman with the gift.\n\nBut their plans keep going wrong – starting even before the ball, as the guy hanging a decorative banner gets trapped hanging from the ceiling when his ladder collapses. People keep stealing the raffle prizes. The firemen haven’t told anyone about the pageant plans beforehand, so the pretty girls they approach during the ball and invite to compete all think it’s a pervy scam, and the less-attractive girls all flock to compete (some are shoved in by their mothers). The younger men in attendance all get drunk and try to leave without paying. And right in the middle of the chaos, someone’s house in town catches on fire.\n\nThe firemen aren’t laughing in the middle of this all – but the audience is. Or, at least, I was. And so was director Miloš Forman; this whole film exists because Forman was visiting a small Czech town with screenwriters Ivan Passer and Jaroslav Papoušek to work on an entirely different screenplay, but they got hit with massive writer’s block and went to the local fireman’s ball to clear their heads. The ball was such a ridiculous affair that the three abandoned their screenplay and started over with this film. To add to the bumbling amateur-hour feel, Forman enlisted a bunch of unknown actors (and several non-actors) for the cast.\n\nMy viewing even came with its own difficulty – the version of the film I watched was subtitled, but they were woefully out of sync with the film itself – each of the subtitles appeared on the screen two or three minutes before the characters said their respective lines. But the lines were on the simple side, and many of them were repetitive; people trying to solve a crisis often wander about wondering aloud what they should do; and that was often the case here as well, so I was still able to follow along. It was also a simple and charming enough story; some of the “beauty pageant” scenes are a tiny bit icky, but Forman calls attention to that, and the pageant contestants even stage their own mini-revolt which kicks off three other waves of chaos.\n\nThe Czech government didn’t take kindly to the film, assuming that Forman was trying to make a larger allegorical comment about them. Forman played coy – he was just trying to make a comedy, he protested, but hey, if they saw themselves reflected in the film, that was certainly telling, wasn’t it. ….He was more apologetic to the actual Czech fire departments who felt attacked themselves, and even made a national apology tour visiting them and setting them at ease. The government objection to his film was still one of several reasons Forman left Czechoslovakia only a year later, moving to Hollywood and restarting his film career there.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of film this is. It’s a crime drama with elements of film noir, but also has some of the fractured jumps in timeline and some of the visual playfulness you’d find in French New Wave.\n\nLee Marvin stars as “Walker”, a low-level tough guy who’s talked into helping his buddy Mal Reese (John Vernon) with a sting – Reese knows about an organized crime money drop at Alcatraz, and Reese suggests the two ambush the couriers and split the money. Oh, and Walker should bring his wife Lynne as well (Sharon Acker). The three carry out the plan perfectly, only once they’ve got the money, Reese shoots Walker and takes all the money, with both Reese and Lynne leaving Walker for dead. Walker survives, however, and manages to escape the island; and a short while later, a mysterious man named “Yost” (Keenan Wynn) reaches out and encourages Walker to go get his money back. He could even take down the shadowy crime syndicate “The Organization” in the process – and Yost can help him.\n\nNow, that sounds pretty straightforward, and as far as the plot goes, this is. The style is pretty unusual, though; that opening sequence on Alcatraz is shot out of order, with Reese shooting Walker very close to the start of the film, and clips of Walker writhing painfully on the floor of an Alcatraz cell are interspersed with all the scenes of Reese approaching Walker for help, Lynne and Walker preparing for their trip, the sting on the couriers, and Walker’s escape itself. And then the clips of Walker staggering to the beach and starting to swim for shore are interspersed with a recovered Walker on a tourist ferry, gazing grimly at the water in reflection until Yost sidles up to him. It was a little tough for me to follow at first, but only because I was expecting something more straightforward; once I adjusted I could follow along easily.\n\nThat unusual time-jumping was thanks to both the source material, and to Lee Marvin himself. This is an adaptation of The Hunter, a 1963 crime novel about a career criminal; The Hunter features this same kind of non-linear storytelling, and both Marvin and director John Boorman were drawn to it. However, an early script edited all that out. Boorman and Marvin hadn’t worked together before – and Boorman was new to the scene to boot – but Marvin was encouraged they both had the same kind of vision for the film; so much so that during an initial meeting with producers, Marvin first asked whether he personally had script and casting approval power. When producers confirmed he did, Lee Marvin simply said “then I defer all those approvals to John Boorman,” and left the meeting, leaving Boorman free to pitch their ideas. Marvin and Boorman also overruled a studio casting choice, insisting on casting Angie Dickinson as Walker’s sister-in-law “Chris”.\n\nThe character of Chris, and her part in the plot, was the only thing that left me uneasy. The plot holds that Chris and Walker had had an affair, and so had Chris and Reese; in fact, Reese wanted to rekindle things. And – after meeting her again – so did Walker. Poor Chris thus ends up getting drafted into a Mata-Hari kind of role, distracting Reese with a visit and seduction so Walker could catch him by surprise. Walker also drags Chris along to one of his next stings – Yost sneaks the pair into a safe house where a high-level member of The Organization (Carrol O’Connor, and I did not recognize him at first), is due to arrive, so Walker can confront him. Walker has dragged Chris along “so he can protect her”, but it’s very much against Chris’ will. After staging a fantastic temper tantrum (slapping the hell out of Walker before running into the kitchen and turning on every appliance, just to be annoying), she and Walker fall into each other’s arms. (…Because of course they do…) However, even here their subsequent “love scene” is interspersed with clips of Walker and Lynne embracing…and REESE and Lynne….and Reese and Chris….and Walker and Chris from their affair….and Walker and Chris in the present. As far as the story goes it was a fun reminder of the shifting loyalties – but I still wish Angie Dickinson had had a bit more to do.\n\nOne fun final comment – there is a 1999 Mel Gibson vehicle, Payback, which was also based on The Hunter. It had mixed reviews – Boorman was one of the naysayers, and joked that maybe it was so bad because Mel Gibson had found the original draft of the script for Point Blank that he and Lee Marvin had discarded.\n\nOnce again, we have a case where there’s a line we should probably all just say right now and get it out of our system. So – one, two, three…\n\n“They call me Mister Tibbs!!!”\n\nSo, I knew that line. I also knew that Sidney Poitier starred as Mr. (Virgil) Tibbs, a Philadelphia homicide detective swept up into a case while passing through tiny Sparta, Mississippi. I knew that a good deal of the film concerned how he locked horns with the white leadership of the town and the police force, mainly with Sheriff Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger). But there was still plenty to surprise me with this tightly-constructed police procedural drama.\n\nThe racial-politics angle is something that could have easily taken over. It’s there, alright – Tibbs is initially arrested by one of Gillespie’s officers early in the morning, after a prominent business developer has turned up dead. Gillespie has sent his men out to find a likely culprit, and Officer Sam Wood (Warren Oates) stops by the train station and sees an unfamiliar black face – and that’s enough of a reason to cuff Tibbs as far as Wood’s concerned. It’s not until Gillespie is interrogating Tibbs back at the station that they learn that Tibbs is a detective, was just passing through, and is pretty damn pissed off. A quick call to Gillespie’s commanding officer sorts things out – but Tibbs has missed his train, and his boss suggests he help Gillespie out with the case while he waits for the next one.\n\nNeither Tibbs nor Gillespie is all that keen on the idea. But Gillespie soon realizes that Tibbs is a really good detective – he spots clues about the case that exonerate a couple of early suspects, and he is able to make connections that Gillespie couldn’t (at one point, when heading out to interview a woman in Sparta’s black community who may be a witness, Tibbs simply tells him that “I’m going someplace ‘whitey’ can’t”). Also, Tibbs being an outsider means that he doesn’t have the same deference to local bigshot Eric Endicott (Larry Gates), a plantation owner Tibbs suspects may be behind the murder. …Conversely, Gillespie can also protect Tibbs when his ambition or temper run away with him – like when a group of thugs gang up on Tibbs, or like when a scandalized Endicott hits Tibbs during questioning, and Tibbs answers him slap for slap.\n\nThere are a couple of heavy-handed racial-commentary moments – like when Gillespie and Tibbs are heading to the Endicott house and Tibbs balefully looks out the car window at Endicotts’ field hands, all black and all picking cotton. But for the most part, it’s more of an undercurrent to the police-procedural story. And I’m a sucker for a good police procedural, so I got into this (and I’m going to be really vague about the details, it’s better if you not know). Some reviewers felt that the murder story was wrapped up a little too quickly and with an out-of-nowhere solution – but the curve ball was something I appreciated, and I had no trouble following along. Endicott being the kingpin in a murder conspiracy would have been an easy and obvious plot twist, so I appreciated that they instead did something a little different.\n\nIn The Heat Of The Night cleaned up at the Oscars that year – including Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and a Best Actor award for Rod Steiger. As for Sidney Poitier, he went on to star as Tibbs in two sequels which did modestly well at the box office, but were considered pale imitations of this film.\n\nApologies for the delay first. I’m in the midst of a job hunt that’s been throwing a higher-than-average number of curve balls at me (not that job hunts are ever straightforward, but this has been a doozy). On the plus side, it’s left me with the time to watch a 3-hour Czech film in an afternoon….but the downside is I wasn’t mentally firing on all cylinders and I struggled to come to grips with this one.\n\nIn theory: this is a story set in the 13th-Century Czech Republic, and deals with the power struggles between two communities – one a feudal lord and his minions, the other a family of robber-knights and their court. Two of the robber band ambush a bishop and his entourage; during the attack, one of them, Mikoláš (František Velecký), discovers their family rival Lazar (Michal Kožuch) helping himself to some of the spoils. Mikoláš is on the verge of killing Lazar in revenge, but has a strange mystic vision of Lazar’s daughter Marketa (Magda Vášáryová) and lets Lazar go. He has a chance to meet the real Marketa some time later, when he asks Lazar for help protecting their villages from a neighboring king; but Lazar has a long memory and beats Mikoláš up in revenge.\n\nLazar has high plans for Marketa, you see – he has promised her to a local convent. Marketa is all in on a religious life, fortunately, and Lazar is more looking forward to the financial compensation he would get. But after a visit to the convent to seal the deal, Lazar and Marketa arrive home to find Mikoláš lying in wait. He attacks Lazar, leaving him for dead, and sets off with Marketa in tow – raping her en route so she is no longer the virgin promised to the convent. By the end, Marketa has to decide where she truly belongs – with her father, with the convent, or with Mikoláš, or somewhere altogether different.\n\nWhat threw me is that the telling of this story was seriously murky, and I have just had to rely on the Wikipedia summary to clarify exactly what I’d seen. The film is assuming I have a working knowledge of medieval Czech history, and….unfortunately I don’t. So I was left to try keeping track of a baffling collection of people, with no real clear understanding of how they all related to each other. Okay, yes, I did follow that Mikoláš raped Marketa and that was bad, but…I didn’t know who Mikoláš was, or how he figured on the pecking order, or who Lazar was, and who that other woman was hanging around Mikoláš’s fort (Mikoláš’ sister Alexandra, played by Pavla Polášková) and what was going on with her own subplot (a love triangle between herself, a captive from Mikoláš’ raid at the start of the film, and another of her and Mikoláš’ brothers). It felt a little like I’d somehow stumbled upon a season 4 episode of Game Of Thrones dubbed in Urdu.\n\nThat said, there are still some moments that were arresting. Towards the end – after a whole hell of a lot has happened to her – Marketa tries to make good on her pledge to join the convent. And the Mother Superior still tries to put her through her paces; but she is less than welcoming, as if she knows what Marketa’s been through. And it puts Marketa off her game a bit – and so when she is taking a very extensive list of vows, instead of repeating after the Mother Superior, she starts going off script a bit. (And now that I type that, I’m realizing one of my recent job interviews took a similarly weird turn.)\n\nThis might be one I revisit at another time – right now really wasn’t a good headspace to tackle something this heavy.\n\nTypically, after watching each film on this list, I take a quick browse online to read other reviews – some contemporary to the time of its release, some not. Some professional, some not. Sometimes this helps me put vague ideas I have into words, and sometimes I have fun seeing just how different my opinion is from others’ (the late Roger Ebert and I had very, very different opinions about Rio Bravo, for instance). I always wait until after I’ve watched the film first – and for this film, I was struck by just how different my own reaction was to the general consensus. But I also think I know why.\n\nDavid Holzman’s Diary is an early “mock-umentary”, sort of like Spinal Tap or the Borat films; it pretends to be the spontaneous musings and thoughts of its main character, but most events are scripted, or at least the scenarios are pre-arranged. L.M. Kit Carson plays “David Holzman”, a young and neurotic New York film fan who’s at loose ends and begins a sort of film diary in an effort to sort himself out. He tries filming everything – wandering about his neighborhood and pointing out various landmarks, passing by a long row of park benches and filming the people sitting on them, interviewing neighbors or friends. He repeatedly speaks directly to the camera, discussing his various ups and downs. In one oddly fascinating sequence, he watches TV and captures a single frame from each scene in each show he watches; among the images flickering past are scenes from Bewitched, clips from news reports, and some images from the very first Star Trek episode.\n\nBut this isn’t just an innocent artistic experiment; some of David’s filming crosses the line into voyeurism and exploitation. In one early scene he gushes about his model girlfriend Penny (Eileen Deitz), but when we finally meet Penny, she is not at all happy to be filmed, and spends most of her time trying to dodge his camera before finally demanding he turn it off. He complies – but in a later scene, he films her as she sleeps in the nude, stopping only when she wakes up and hits him before storming out. It’s not just Penny – David also develops an obsession with a neighbor he sees through his window, going so far as to dig up some of her trash in an effort to learn her name. There’s also an extremely uncomfortable sequence where he films a woman on the subway (Fern McBride), following her as she tries to edge away from him on the car and then leaves the subway; David follows her two blocks as she tries to escape, looking fearfully over her shoulder at him a few times. He only stops when she finally whirls around to confront him, demanding that he “get lost!”\n\nEven some of his own musings turn sour towards the end. Early on David quotes Jean Godard as saying that film is “the truth at 24 frames a second”, and says this is his inspiration for his project – hopefully by filming everything, David will finally be able to have some kind of “truth” to anchor himself in. But in a later scene, David confesses that it’s not quite going according to plan; trying to film everything is making him act strange and out of character. But he blames his equipment instead of himself; at one point he actually punches the tape player and editing equipment on the table behind him, wailing “why doesn’t this help me? WHAT DO YOU WANT?” before turning his camera off for the day.\n\nA lot of the reviews I’ve read compare this film to the Youtube vloggers of today – idle examinations of everyday life. Reviews from its original release compare it to early attempts at cinema verite. But I caught something in the very first scene that many reviewers seem to have overlooked – and for me, it completely changed how I viewed the rest of the film. In the very first scene, when David is introducing his project, he says that he has recently lost his job – and as a result, he is now considered eligible for the draft. Periodically, through the film, we hear news coverage of the developing conflict, and soundbites of reporters discussing the Pentagon’s plan to send yet another several thousand soldiers overseas. And that completely changed how I viewed David’s efforts. He was a young man up against a ticking time bomb; he had just barely begun to figure himself out, and now there was a strong possibility he wouldn’t have time to finish.\n\nFor me, that gave everything poignancy. The creepy stalkerish behavior was still creepy, but it also wasn’t all David was filming…he sometimes filmed simple street scenes, or shots of flowers in sidewalks, or the way the light fell. In one late sequence he wanders down the streets at night, filming inside people’s windows and capturing bits of mundane ordinary life – life that he may lose the chance to enjoy. He might not have the chance to plan out the message he wanted to leave to the world, so he was going to just film everything and hope it said enough. And even the stalkerish behavior – even though Penny strongly objected to being filmed, David is filming her out of pure admiration for her beauty; and, I thought, a desperate effort to capture and hold that beauty before the war takes it away from him.\n\nI was genuinely surprised that none of the other reviews I’ve read seem to have taken that into account. Many young men at risk for the draft were often terrified and went to great lengths to save themselves; while I can’t speak for him entirely, I know my father had to make a few choices of his own that were driven by fear of the draft (one of them was a career choice, in fact). I sensed David’s fear underscoring everything he did in this film – fear that his life could end before it had barely even began, and that this lackluster film would be the only record he’d ever existed at all.\n\nI…I seriously do not know what to say about this one.\n\nThis is a highly experimental film by Canadian filmmaker Michael Snow. All that “happens” is a couple of brief scenes play out in a nondescript empty city office loft, as the camera very slowly (over the course of 45 minutes) zooms in on a photo of a beach scene tacked to the far wall. And I do mean brief – at the top of the film, a woman directs two movers to leave a large bookshelf against one wall; about ten minutes later she returns with another woman to listen to a recording of the Beatles’ “Strawberry Fields Forever”; and then several minutes after that a man wanders into the room and collapses, and is shortly thereafter discovered by one of the women, who calls the police.\n\nWe never learn where the office is. We never see anything on the bookcase. We never definitively learn whether the man is alive or dead after he collapses. We never learn who any of these people are or what they’re doing there.\n\nAnd aside from the Beatles, occasional lines of dialogue and one or two other surprise sound effects (including a flatulent raspberry near the end), the only other thing we hear is a droning buzz of synthesized feedback, starting with a low tone and gradually rising in pitch. And aside from one or two light changes and color filters, the only thing we see is that slow zoom into the photo. The sound cuts out at the very end (the notes I’m finding now say that it rises to a pitch people can’t hear), just as the camera is zoomed in full on the photo on the wall; just after the sound cuts out, the focus starts to blur and then fades to white, and the film ends.\n\nI am honestly and sincerely not clear what this all means, even after reading a few articles about it. I will say, though, that – I did my best to watch the whole thing, and pay attention. In fairness, though, the biggest reason I focused on this was largely out of fascination that “this….really is all that happens in this, isn’t it? Huh.”\n\nWell, it exists, and I watched it, and I can move on.\n\nNo one told me this would be a French New Wave remake of An American In Paris. Right down to Gene Kelly even being in it.\n\nOkay, so it’s not necessarily a remake as far as the plot goes; but it’s definitely got the same kind of vibe. It’s a big-budget musical set in the little French coastal town of Rochefort, on the weekend a traveling carnival is in town. Delphine (Catherine Deneuve) and Solange (Françoise Dorléac), a pair of fraternal twin sisters, fantasize about traveling the world – or at least to Paris – to make it big in show biz, instead of staying stuck in Rochefort and teaching ballet (as Delphine does) and music (Solange). Their mother Yvonne (Danielle Darrieux) welcomes the business; she runs the local cafe, and a pair of carnies (Georges Chakiris and Grover Dale) quickly become steady customers, befriending some of the other clientele and even pitching in to babysit Yvonne’s youngest child, a scamp named Booboo (Patrick Jeantet).\n\nLittle does everyone know that love is also in town – for everyone. One of the regulars in Yvonne’s cafe is a young soldier, Maxence (Jacques Perrin), who’s taken up painting as a hobby and has even done a portrait of his “Ideal Woman”, which hangs in the local art gallery. By sheer coincidence – it looks exactly like Delphine. But Yvonne hasn’t had the chance to go to the gallery to see it, and Maxence and Delphine keep missing each other. Delphine has seen the painting, but the gallery owner (a jealous ex-boyfriend) has lied and told her the artist is in Paris by now.\n\nMeanwhile, Solange gets some good news from Monsieur Dame (Michel Piccoli), owner of a new music shop in town; M. Dame’s good friend, a musician named Andy Miller, is willing to meet Solange in Paris and possibly become a mentor. M. Dame secretly hopes she doesn’t leave, though – Solange has become a bright spot in his life, as he’s still recovering from a ten-year-old heartbreak; his ex refused to marry him because his name was silly. …Last he heard, she was somewhere in Mexico; alas, maybe his beloved Yvonne would be happier there. But – at the same time, Yvonne is confiding in the two carnies about how she’s still kicking herself over breaking up with a guy named Monsieur Dame, and maybe someday she’ll meet him again.\n\nAnd – what luck, also at the same time Andy Miller (Gene Kelly) has come to Rochefort to pay M. Dame a surprise visit. And he bumps into Solange when she drops her bag and he offers to help her pick everything up; they’re both instantly smitten, but forget to introduce themselves in the confusion. All Andy has is some sheet music that Solange leaves behind in the shuffle – something he tries to play over at M. Dame’s store and is duly impressed by.\n\nSo: that’s a whole heck of a lot of missed connections. Will Delphine ever meet Maxence? Will Solange ever meet Andy properly? Will Yvonne and M. Dame find each other?\n\n….Well, what do you think?\n\nIt’s a paper-thin plot, bolstered by countless songs and dance breaks. Unsurprisingly, too, since this was directed by Jacques Demy – his prior Umbrellas of Cherbourg was entirely sung-through, and here he clearly carried things even further into full-on classic-Hollywood-musical territory; where it’s the kind of plot that would fall apart in three seconds if you thought about it, but the singing and dancing and color and energy carry things instead and you really don’t care so much.\n\nAnd surprisingly, I didn’t care so much about the plot holes. There was one moment when I was really dubious that Yvonne never saw one of Maxence’s sketches of his “ideal woman” so she could say “oh, that looks like my daughter Delphine”, and when Gene Kelly showed up I think I said out loud “oh, come on, really?” But the next song came along just seconds later and sucked me back in, to the point that when one of our missed-connections hadn’t resolved itself by the last scene, I was upset about it. (And then cheered when things got fixed in literally the last second.)\n\nThere’s actually a great explanation for how Gene Kelly ended up here – aside from the obvious “old Hollywood musical legend” connection. Kelly was apparently a huge Francophile, and even accepted a studio deal to send him to Europe in the early 1950s for an attempt at an international collaboration. The films produced through the deal fell through, and movie musicals were on the way out when he came home; but Kelly had fallen in love with both France and directing while in Europe, and made regular visits for artistic projects; he choreographed a ballet for the Paris Opera in 1960, he directed Jackie Gleason in a French film in 1962, he was even awarded the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur. So his ending up in a French New Wave homage to MGM Movie Musicals was kind of a no-brainer.\n\nOne last sad note – Françoise Dorléac was Catherine Deneuve’s sister in real life, and had been a working actress for about seven years; this film was considered by many to be the big break that would seriously launch her into success. However, a few months after its release, Dorléac was killed in a car crash.\n\nIt was…fine.\n\nLook, I’m sorry, I’ve just always been kind of lukewarm on classic Disney and this is no different. Even when I was a child I could tell when things were being defanged and dumbed-down “because this is for kids” and I bristled at it; and classic Disney movies are notorious for toning things down in their adaptations. Even the more modern Disney films leave out some oogy details (look up the original story of The Little Mermaid, for starters). Especially sensitive kids might need a cuddlier version, but most kids actually would get into the more Grand Guignol elements of classic fairy tales – I know I would have done. (I got a book about Saints as a gift when I was young, but instead of getting any religious messaging I would spend fascinated hours reading the martyrs’ death scenes.)\n\nRudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book was similarly toned down here – at least in the final product. The original screenplay was a closer adaptation, with the orphaned boy Mowgli hopping back and forth between the world of men and the jungle as he tries to balance his two lives, with a showdown between himself and a hunter who wants to burn the entire jungle in an effort to kill the tiger Shere Khan. Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther are also in Kipling’s story, but Baloo is more of a lazy sort and Bagheera confides to Mowgli that he was raised by humans himself, and bonds with him over having stakes in both camps.\n\nWalt Disney didn’t like the dark tone, however, and brought in a fresh team of writers. And what we get is cute and all, but still kinda fluffy – Baloo is turned into more of a slacker, Bagheera is just generically helpful and both Shere Khan and Kaa the python are defanged considerably. The writers also tried to mix in pop music influences – the four vultures Mowgli meets at one point were inspired by The Beatles (Disney even approached The Beatles to play the roles in voiceover, but John Lennon said no), and King Louie, leader of a tribe of orangutans, was a chance for swing singer Louis Prima to play himself. (Disney originally wanted Louis Armstrong, and writers had to point out that casting a black man as an ape would likely incense the NAACP.) The writers also decided that Mowgli wouldn’t have left the jungle unless he’d somehow “fallen in love” with the human world, and created a cute girl for him to fall in love with at the very end.\n\nEven though the story was too slight for me, the songs and the animation made up for that. I first heard Baloo’s big song “Bare Necessities” as a child, and it’s been stuck somewhere in my head ever since; as has the monkey’s song “I Wan’na Be Like You,” and “My Own Home”, the song the village girl sings to lure Mowgli out of the jungle. And the animation is absolutely spot-on.\n\nThere are also moments that are surprisingly poignant – towards the end, as Mowgli is following the girl back into the village, he pauses to look back into the jungle, where Baloo is watching nervously and Bagheera is smiling. It’s his one last look back into the jungle and his family there – but Baloo and Bagheera are far enough in the distance that we can barely see their faces, they’re just animals lurking in the bushes. And so Mowgli turns and leaves them.\n\nSo It’s not a terrible film, just really, really fluffy and slight. It’s like a puff of cotton candy – sweetness and air and color and fun that dissolves to nothing as soon as you ingest it."
