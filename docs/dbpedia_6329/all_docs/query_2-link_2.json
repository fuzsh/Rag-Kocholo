        "text": "I first came across Nikolai Gogol‘s Viy when I saw it mentioned as the source material in the opening titles from Mario Bava‘s iconic Gothic Horror film La maschera del demonio (1960, a/k/a Black Sunday). I loved the movie so much I hunted down the story and was confused when it had nothing to do with the Gothic fantasia portrayed in the Bava film. The story I read, in The Complete Tales of Nikolai Gogol Vol. 2, was what critics nowadays would describe as a Folk-Horror story. It was full of colorful characters, clever wit, folksy charm, and almost surreal dark fantasy and horror. The tale recounts the misadventures of Khoma Brut, a philosopher (seminary jargon for sophomore) as he travels with a couple of mates during a holiday break in rural Ukraine.\n\nThe young men find themselves in search of shelter when they stumble upon a small farm in the middle of nowhere. They knock on the gate and are greeted by a withered beldam. Reluctant at first to take them in, she seems to take secret offense to a snide remark by Khoma and suddenly changes her mind, consenting to house them for the night with the stipulation that they stay in separate areas of the farm. The youngest one is allowed in the house proper, the eldest is put in a hayloft, and Khoma in the stables. Once everyone is abed the old woman visits Khoma. At first he thinks she is trying to lie with him and so he condescendingly rebuffs her. Nevertheless, she does not relent, and instead chases him around until, finally overpowering him, she mounts his back and rides him like a horse into the sky and over the rural landscape. Here things become a bit fanciful. As Khoma strides over a wetland, he sees a beautiful water sprite, which Wikipedia, in their entry on the story, explains as a reference to Rusalki, the restless spirits of drowned maidens. That is as maybe, but I think the whole incident is basically all part of an elaborate succubus visitation. He is literally hag-ridden. Gogol describes how Khoma experiences sensual pleasure while being ridden and he has erotic fantasies about the nude water sprite. Even so, he eventually overturns the hag and starts to beat her savagely. When she cries out however, it is in the voice of a young woman.\n\nHe stops his frenzied thrashing of the witch and finds that she has transformed into the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. Fearful of the implications, both worldly and supernatural, of what has just happened, he leaves her and runs back to the seminary. Soon after, he is summoned by his master and told to travel to a rich cossack’s home to read psalms over his daughter who has crawled home and is at death’s door after being attacked by some ruffian. Her dying wish is that Khoma Brut (she asks for him by name) keep a vigil over her corpse and read psalms over her for 3 nights to allay her disquieted spirit and redeem her sullied soul.\n\nKhoma is reluctant to comply after his recent scare but is compelled to go, escorted by a retinue of hardened cossacks (whom he betimes befriends during a pit stop at an inn where they get soused on vodka) to ensure he completes his task. When he finally sees the girl in her coffin, he recognizes the young witch he’d beaten to death. The vigil is held in a neglected chappel and each night the cadaver of the young witch rises from her coffin and assails him, abetted by a host of imps and night creatures, all of which are kept at bay by Khoma’s psalm recitations from behind the aegis of a protective circle that keeps the fiends from either seeing or touching him. On the third night the witch summons Viy, which Gogol refers to as The King of Gnomes in a footnote to the tale, as a capper to her phantasmagoria of goblins and devils.\n\nIt wasn’t until around 20 years later that I discovered the 1967 film adaptation and actually got to see it in one of those aforementioned questionable DVD editions. This is not the only film adaptation of the tale, but I believe it is probably the most faithful one. It is a beautiful movie which captures the humor and fantasy of Gogol’s story very well, as far as I understand it, and paints a picturesque portrait of what the Ukrainian people were like in the early 19th century, at least as they are described by Gogol, and for the most part when the horror elements finally pop up they are very faithful to Gogol’s vision, save for the few scenes which were purportedly not depicted due to restrictions from the Soviet censors as well as the technological limitations of the time period. These scenes involved the young witch shapeshifting and displaying graphic vampiric behavior. That being said, there are plenty macabre sights during the 3 night vigil and some pretty impressive scenes featuring a flying coffin.\n\nThe Severin remaster, which is available in both DVD and Blu-ray formats, is very clean and sharp and is the best I expect one will ever see outside of the Russian Federation for some time. There are two video commentaries in the bonus features, one with South African director Richard Stanley, who is the talk of the town these days with his own adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s 1927 story The Colour Out of Space, and the other with John Leman Riley talking about the history of Russian fantasy film. These are, I believe, of limited relevance to the feature, and both men seem to oversell this idea of Viy being a pioneering bit of vampire cinema. Although Gogol’s story does have scenes of vampirism, none of these are actually shown in the film, where the young woman is only ever referred to as a witch. Also, in traditional lore many of these creatures are conflated. Witches and Werewolves, share traits and become vampires upon death, so when Gogol wrote Viy he was most likely not thinking of it as a vampire tale per se. Wrapping up the special features are three silent Russian fantasy shorts.\n\nIn closing I feel that, yet again, I must acknowledge an influence on my own work. Seeing the film again after so many years and rereading the Gogol tale, I realize that the idea of the death vigil of the beautiful vampire/witch most likely was a subconscious influence, on my Sanguinary Saga of Morbidezza Vespertilio, Vampiress, especially in the Vampire Vigil episode. I also noticed that she sheds a tear of blood, which Morbidezza does in Kiss of Life. I, like most other authors, simply assimilate and regurgitate everything I read, watch, or hear. The trick is to give it one’s singular spin."
