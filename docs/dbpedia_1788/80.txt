Bridal Veil Falls is a two-tiered, 36.5m waterfall. For decades the falls was dry due to lumber mill diversions upstream, including by the Bridal Veil Lumber & Box Company, which manufactured cardboard boxes for Kraft Cheese. The company closed in 1960 and in 1991 the land was purchased by the Trust for Public Lands. Bridal Veil Falls is a favorite of families and young and aspiring couples. Of the company town of Bridal Veil, only the post office remains, keeping busy adding their cancellation to wedding invitations.
