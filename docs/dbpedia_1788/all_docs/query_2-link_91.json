Its diverse seasons offer infinite possibilities, allowing you to tailor your Colorado elopement to your unique vision. With our abundant sunshine, boasting 300 days a year, you can rest assured there’s always a breathtaking backdrop for those seeking to elope in Colorado anytime of the year.\n\nSummer, my favorite season in Colorado, encapsulates the distilled Colorado experience. Long days invite hiking and backpacking through wildflower-filled valleys, culminating in an epic alpine lake. You can top off your day with a draft beer at a local brewery or roam the open tundra while taking in the scenic beauty from one of our many mountain passes. Eloping in Colorado during the summer is a true adventure!\n\nLet’s keep it real and talk about September and October, when peak fall colors adorn the aspens. Wandering through valleys alive with orange and yellow foliage heightens your Colorado elopement experience. The colder months are perfect for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, with plenty of bluebird days to enjoy.\n\nCheck out below for a more thorough breakdown of the best months to elope in Colorado!\n\nCheck out this chart below for a bigger breakdown of what you can expect each month to look like in Colorado.\n\nBEST PLACES TO ELOPE IN COLORADO – BEST REGIONS\n\nYes, it makes sense! Here is a refined version to enhance clarity and flow:\n\nHonestly, exploring the best places is the most fun and crucial part of every Colorado elopement. Personalization is key, and it’s something I’m deeply passionate about. With 13 years of immersing myself in Colorado, I’ve gathered insider insights that have allowed me to uncover those truly epic elopement spots scattered throughout the state – something that never fails to excite me! Yet, it’s essential to fine-tune specific details based on each couple’s responses to their questionnaire. That’s where the magic happens.\n\nSome of the questions you’ll see in your couples scouting questionnaire after booking will include:\n\nWhat type of scenery in the mountains do you like the most? (Bodies of water, flowers, cliffs & edges, forests, waterfalls, ect)\n\nHow many miles are you up for on a hike? And at what pace? Are you feeling adventurous enough to hike in your wedding attire, or would you prefer to change once you’ve arrived at your chosen location in Colorado?\n\nDo you have any kind of elopement wedding celebration, reception, drinks or meals planned? Where is and what time do you envision your reception happening?\n\nHow do you handle heights and exposure? Thoughts on being near cliff edges or drop-offs?\n\nWhat adventures are you envisioning for your Colorado elopement? Are you keen on backpacking, hiking, or perhaps a first look and dance? Maybe climbing, flying a kite, kayaking, or even a tranquil picnic? How about visiting a local brewery or paddle boarding?\n\nSAN JUAN MOUNTAINS ELOPEMENTS\n\nThis is my favorite area of Colorado, hands down. It hits differently and is an absolute paradise for adventure enthusiasts! These mountains, ancient volcanic peaks, traverse the heart of southwestern Colorado. Today, the jagged summits are home to a colorful carpet of summer wildflowers and a number of breathtaking turquoise alpine lakes, waterfalls and off-roading routes. Navigating these roads can be challenging, with their winding paths and rough terrain, requiring vehicles with ample clearance.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN THE SAN JUAN MOUNTAINS\n\nHaving your ceremony near Ouray is always a good choice—it’s the gateway to every part of the San Juan’s. Gold Mountain Ranch has killer views overlooking Ouray, ideal for up to 40 guests, with 6 wooden benches and endless photo ops in the stunning Ouray Valley. I especially love coming here in the fall time! If you are up for a drive, I love Molas Campground near Silverton that has amazing views of the Grenadiers!\n\n• ADVENTURE SPOTS IN THE SAN JUAN MOUNTAINS\n\nThere is a reason why I spend the majority of my time out here, and that’s because you barely see anyone! So if you’re seeking an epic, private adventure spot in Colorado, this is it. While some spots have blown up on social media, the San Juan mountains are massive, and I’ll show you the local gems. You can settle in and explore a myriad of unforgettable elopement experiences, such as hiking, backpacking, and off-roading. Just choose your adventure and set up your lodging in one of the famous Colorado towns Telluride, Silverton, Ouray, and Durango and you’ll be set.\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE IN THE SAN JUAN MOUNTAINS\n\nThis region of Colorado shines in every season except for mud season, when locals tend to hibernate between winter and summer. Personally, I find the summer and fall months particularly enchanting for elopements when the flowers are on steroids and the aspen trees are popping. Drive from Telluride to Ouray in the fall time and watch as Sneffels is lined in orange and yellow. You will thank me later!\n\nASPEN ELOPEMENTS\n\nA little place I like to call Aspen! The true allure of Aspen lies in its peaks and valleys, where Independence Pass, alpine lakes, and breathtaking high alpine vistas showcasing some of Colorado’s finest peaks in the Elks range await your hiking boots! My couples love eloping in Aspen for its convenient proximity to neighboring towns. With easy access to Twin Lakes, Snowmass, Carbondale, and Basalt, there are ample lodging choices available.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN ASPEN\n\nMaroon Bells Amphitheater is the most sought-after elopement ceremony spot in the Aspen area but can be challenging and overwhelming to secure! If you can’t obtain a permit for Maroon Bells, I recommend exploring ceremony locations in nearby towns like Carbondale or Twin Lakes. Ashcroft Ghost Town also offers some really cool venues in a historical setting!\n\n• ADVENTURE LOCATIONS IN ASPEN\n\nEloping in Aspen? Trust me, it’s an absolute blast! Tons of adventure options to choose from in the Elk Range to Snowmass and Twin Lakes areas. Or keep it chill with a drive to Independence Pass for epic sunrises or sunsets. Some of my favorite alpine lakes are here – They’re not just your average lakes; they’re like something out of a dream – crystal clear and calling out for a refreshing dip after exchanging vows on a warm summer’s day. In short, get ready to be stoked!\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE IN ASPEN\n\nI typically recommend waiting until Memorial day when the mountain passes, like Independence Pass and Maroon Bells, start to open up. Additionally, Aspen’s known for its aspen trees is unparalleled, particularly during the fall season when the Maroon Bells valley transforms into a canvas of orange and yellow tones. This is peak tourist season but there are plenty of hidden gems away from the crowds in the nearby valleys you can sneak away to capture the Aspen beauty if you know where to look.\n\nVAIL ELOPEMENTS\n\nVail – it’s the Colorado version of boujee, no doubt about it. But don’t let the fur coats and expensive coffee fool you! Nestled within the White River National Forest, Vail is situated amidst the rugged and iconic Gore Range, some of my favorite and Colorado’s most challenging and breathtaking peaks for those seeking a bigger adventure for their elopement. This region doesn’t just offer fun; it’s a type 4 fun experience, the kind that leaves you feeling alive and exhilarated, especially on your elopement day.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN VAIL\n\nFor a laid-back and intimate wedding ceremony, consider the Betty Ford Alpine Garden right in the heart of Vail. It’s a serene and romantic departure from typical adventure spots and holds the title of the highest botanical garden in the United States at 8,250 feet! I have captured a number of ceremonies here and they are insanely beautiful in the summer when the flowers are in bloom.\n\n• ADVENTURE SPOTS IN VAIL\n\nThe Gore Range in Vail is a summer go-to for me. Tough on the legs, but the views are wild, and those rugged peaks? Unmatched. Stick around for fall, and watch as the aspen trees paint Vail valley in gold! You work hard for those summit beers in this area. Additionally, it’s important to note that a lot of the trails start in residential areas, so be mindful of the locals when parking and exploring the Vail area.\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE IN VAIL\n\nI have a special fondness for summer elopements in Vail, especially considering how costly winteractivities can be. Save your money and opt for hitting the trails starting in late June when you can tackle the alpine lakes in the Gore range, relishing the stunning fall colors that last through October.\n\nBRECKENRIDGE ELOPEMENTS\n\nBreck, or us as the locals call it, is a laid-back ski town full of Western spirit. It’s known for having amazing skiing, summer hiking, and year-round high-alpine activities (including a roster of fun festivals). When the snow melts away, it reveals a whole new world of summer hiking adventures just waiting to be explored. And the Breck location is prime. Right off I-70, making it an absolute breeze for anyone traveling to Colorado. Breck continues to steal couples’ hearts for its beauty and convenience.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN BRECKENRIDGE\n\nI love capturing elopement ceremonies at Windy Point Campground. It’s pricier ($250 compared to $120) than Sapphire Point and it’s only open in summer, but you get an entire campground with epic views of the area and is totally worth it!Book your Windy Point Campground reservation. Side note: Sapphire Point is the go-to for most elopement wedding ceremonies in Breckenridge, but privacy can be lacking, especially with the local chipmunks.\n\n• ADVENTURE SPOTS IN BRECKENRIDGE\n\nI spend a lot of time capturing elopements in the summit county area, where the adventures are endless. I especially love the sunrise hikes in Breckenridge, as most of them are western facing, giving off some amazing morning alpenglow! Whether it’s a chill Jeep ride up Boreas Pass or a hike to alpine lakes surrounded by wildflowers in summer or vibrant foliage in fall, the options on both sides of the Continental Divide are abundant. Choose your adventure!\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE IN BRECKENRIDGE\n\nI love capturing elopements out here, particularly stunning in two seasons: in the summer, when there are countless wildflowers and open vistas for you to explore, and in the fall, when the aspens are lit up in shades of orange and yellow. But winter is also really awesome because you have so many ski resorts in the area! You can go to a big resort like Breckenridge, but I prefer heading over to A-Basin or Keystone for a winter elopement.\n\nBOULDER ELOPEMENTS\n\nBoulder, nestled snugly at the base of the Indian Peaks Wilderness. It’s more than just a college town; it’s a doorway to endless adventures and cool spots waiting to be explored for your elopement. Whether you’re craving laid-back vibes or seeking adrenaline-pumping thrills, this area has something for everyone. And let me tell you, ending your big day with some brews and bites on Pearl Street? It’s the perfect way to toast to your unforgettable adventure.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN BOULDER\n\nI absolutely love capturing elopements at Sunrise Amphitheater outside of Boulder. Just a quick 20-minute drive from Chautauqua Park, you’ll find yourself surrounded by pine trees and stunning vistas. Plus, it’s super easy for couples and their guests to get there by car. It’s the perfect blend of convenience and breathtaking scenery for an intimate elopement wedding! Please Note – photographers should either have a limited or unlimited annual commercial use permit.\n\n• ADVENTURE SPOTS IN BOULDER\n\nYou can find plenty of scenic elopement locations right outside Boulder or venture further out towards Nederland or Eldora where you can hit up some jagged peaks and explore plenty of alpine lakes for your elopement. I always love to hit up Crosscut Pizza after a big hike in the Ned area!\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE IN BOULDER\n\nIf you are eloping to Boulder County, then you are good to go year-round. If you are heading out towards the Indian Peaks area, I love the summer months when the flowers are blooming and the trails are primed and ready! I would just avoid popular areas like Chautauqua Park on the weekends when it’s a mad house. You’ll thank me later!\n\nTELLURIDE ELOPEMENTS\n\n“To Hell You Ride” – Ask someone to name towns in Colorado, and chances are they’ll mention Telluride. Remote, rugged, yet somehow it manages to embrace you with a touch of luxury. Telluride has this magnetic pull that keeps drawing me back year after year for elopements, and I can’t help but answer its call! It has great places to dine, a free gondola, lots of mountain passes to explore and even has the one the worlds most dangerous airports to fly into for your elopement! Or you can fly into Montrose if you want to be safer.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN TELLURIDE\n\nI’ve loved working with Telluride Sleighs and Wagons over the years. It’s this rad spot just on the outskirts of town where you can seamlessly blend your ceremony and reception into one epic experience. The views there are absolutely top-notch, offering some of the most breathtaking vistas in the area. It’s out of this world!\n\n• ADVENTURE SPOTS IN TELLURIDE\n\nYou don’t have to go far to see an epic spot in Telluride. Nestled at the head of a box canyon, Bridal Veil Falls, the state’s tallest waterfall, cascading a jaw-dropping 365 feet to the canyon floor. It’s a sight that never fails to take my breath away. But not only that, it’s the base camp for a bunch of epic hikes in the area, and you can even basin hop! Feeling extra spicy? Grab a jeep and make a trek on your elopement over the pass to Ouray for a full-day elopement experience!\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE IN TELLURIDE\n\nI highly recommend eloping in the summer and fall months when the town is bustling with locals and visitors, giving you the full vibe and energy. It’s also when local festivals are in full swing, allowing you to immerse yourselves in the Telluride community after your elopement. Side note: my favorite festival is the mushroom festival!\n\nGRANBY ELOPEMENTS\n\nGranby stands out as one of my top picks for couples eloping in Colorado, thanks to its rugged peaks and secluded alpine lakes. But be prepared – the hiking and backpacking trails here demand serious endurance, strong legs, and determination, as they’re not for the faint of heart! Additionally, Winter Park and Mary Jane are some of the best local ski areas, offering great vibes compared to the big resorts. The tailgating here on the weekends is a riot! Pack your PBRs so you don’t stick out.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN GRANBY\n\nGranby is adorned with local ski resorts and mountain passes, offering fantastic ceremony options all year round. Or you can keep it super chill and easy and go over to Grand Lake for a ceremony on the water.\n\n• ADVENTURE PLACES IN GRANBY\n\nThis is less traveled and explored side of the Indian Peaks Wilderness resides near Granby, Colorado. You will find a ton of epic hikes in this area and can even find the backdoor to Rocky Mountain National Park via Trail Ridge Road. It’s truly insane how many places their are to explore on this side of the pass, yet no one really talks about it. Win for you!\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE IN GRANBY\n\nGranby is an excellent choice for elopements throughout the year, with its proximity to numerous ski resorts like Winter Park and the allure of hiking trails and mountain passes, particularly shining in the summer.\n\nBRAINARD LAKE RECREATION ELOPEMENTS\n\nDo you want some big views? Brainard, accessible by car, it’s like stepping into a postcard with those jaw-dropping views of the surrounding Indian Peaks. I still remember the first time I laid eyes on it almost a decade ago – utterly mesmerized doesn’t even begin to cover it. Despite its growing popularity and the permits they’ve had to introduce over the years, there’s something about Brainard Lake that keeps pulling me back time and time again. Trust me, once you experience its beauty for yourself, you’ll understand exactly why!\n\n*2024 UPDATE: Brainard Lake requires a day-use permit. You can make a reservation online.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS AT BRAINARD LAKE\n\nYou’re welcome to host your ceremony at Brainard Lake, but parking can be tough. Smaller groups help manage this and respect the area’s serenity for other visitors. If you have a larger group, I suggest going towards Boulder and renting out a spot there after your photos at Brainard.\n\n• ADVENTURE OPTIONS AT BRAINARD LAKE\n\nBrainard Lake sits at the trailhead of 10 different hiking trails and stands out as one of my favorite spots during the summer. Don’t miss the chance to trek up to Lake Isabelle, which was my first Colorado hike, for some truly epic views!\n\n• BEST TIME OF YEAR TO ELOPE AT BRAINARD LAKE\n\nThe primary road leading up to Brainard is only open during the summer months, typically starting in late June and closing in late fall when they stop being maintained.\n\nGEORGETOWN ELOPEMENTS\n\nGeorgetown – it’s like a hidden treasure chest of everything you could want in a Colorado elopement. I fell in love with this place instantly – it’s adventurous, intimate, and overflowing with that irresistible small-town charm. Tucked snugly between two majestic peaks just off I-70, it’s a haven for anyone craving breathtaking views, yummy food, coffee, and epic 14ers and 13ers for the adventurous souls among us. And here’s the cherry on top: after a day filled with love and exploration, there’s nothing quite like winding down at one of the local breweries, toasting to the magic of it all.\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN GEORGETOWN\n\nFor smaller elopement groups, consider heading up to Guanella Pass for your ceremony. It’s particularly breathtaking in the fall when the aspen trees paint the roadsides in hues of yellow and gold and then cap it off by exploring the area by visiting the Georgetown Loop Railroad.\n\n• ADVENTURE PLACES IN GEORGETOWN\n\nThe Georgetown area is packed with adventure and it’s incredibly close to Denver. If you head up Guanella Pass, you’ll have a ton of hiking trails, along with some 13ers and a 14er. In other directions, you can Jeep around up a pass and catch an epic sunset. Or head in the other direction and go check out St. Mary’s Glacier. The options for adventure are endless, but make sure you plan for a weekday because this area is insane on the weekends!\n\n• BEST SEASON TO ELOPE IN GEORGETOWN\n\nI typically recommend eloping in the summer and fall months since the road to Guanella Pass closes during winter around November and opens again around Memorial Day. It’s an area you definitely don’t want to miss!\n\nBUENA VISTA ELOPEMENTS\n\nWhenever I journey back from the San Juan Mountains to Denver, I make it a point to stop here for a dose of adventure. Buena Vista exudes charm and offers endless opportunities for exploration. With the majestic Collegiate Peaks dominating the skyline and the super cute town boasting an array of restaurants and of course Mount Princeton Hot Springs, it’s a haven for adventure seekers. There’s no shortage of cool things to experience here!\n\n• BEST CEREMONY LOCATIONS IN BUENA VISTA\n\nIf you’re looking for a laid-back vibe, head on up to Cottonwood Pass and soak in an epic sunset! This spot is absolutely jaw-dropping, especially during the fall season. Just make sure to hit complete your elopement by indulging in a soak at one of the six local hot springs in the BV area.\n\n• ADVENTURE PLACES IN BUENA VISTA\n\nTake your pick from the plethora of epic 14ers and alpine lakes nestled among the Collegiate Peaks. This region is brimming with adventure opportunities for elopers, especially in the summer time when the snow is gone and the trails are prime for hiking.\n\n• BEST SEASON TO ELOPE IN BUENA VISTA\n\nHonestly, eloping Buena Vista is fantastic all year round, but if you’re aiming to conquer of the eight nearby 14ers, summer is your best bet when the snow has melted. Winter tends to be quiet since it’s not very close to ski resorts aside from Breck.\n\nSIGNATURE COLORADO ELOPEMENT LOCATIONS\n\nCraving more than just a taste of Colorado’s beauty? Picture this: iconic postcard-worthy views, or perhaps the serenity of a National Park setting. Luckily, Colorado has it all, and then some, when it comes to dream elopement locations. Personally, I’m all about those offbeat, adventurous elopement weddings – you know, the ones that push the boundaries and leave you with unforgettable memories. So, if you’re ready to ditch the ordinary and dive into the extraordinary, let’s explore the best elopement locations that’ll ignite your imagination and leave you breathless with wonder!\n\nELOPING IN COLORADO AT RENTAL SPOTS\n\nEloping in Colorado adds another layer of magic to the experience. Beyond the breathtaking views, what’s great about permit spots is that you snag a designated time slot and date for your elopement. It’s a game-changer, especially for those meticulous planners and folks eloping in Colorado with family. Plus, it’s a cheaper option than a big venue! But listen up: scoring permits for these destination locations can be a bit of a competition. So, don’t tie yourself down to a spot until you’ve actually secured the permit. Side note: Always aim for a weekday for a better chance to grab a permit and for maximum privacy!\n\nMAROON BELLS AMPHITHEATER ELOPEMENTS\n\nMaroon Bells, just outside Aspen, is where you will find the two most iconic peaks in all of Colorado. It’s like stepping into a dreamland – surrounded by whispering aspen trees, a beautiful alpine lake where you can catch reflections, and views of some iconic peaks. For couples eloping in Colorado, Maroon Bells is the ultimate elopement paradise.\n\nAnd let’s talk seasons—there’s something truly enchanting about Maroon Bells in the fall. Picture those quaking aspens setting the mountainside ablaze with shades of gold and yellow, with a sprinkle of snow adding an extra touch of magic. It’s a sight you won’t soon forget, a perfect blend of autumnal warmth and wintry charm!\n\nThere is a $200 application fee to elope in Maroon Bells Wilderness Area. You can reserve your Maroon Bells ceremony spot at recreation.gov.\n\nSAN SOPHIA OVERLOOK ELOPEMENTS\n\nThe best part about San Sophia? You get to combine your wedding and honeymoon into one big adventure in one of the most scenic venues and areas of Colorado!\n\nTake a free gondola ride up to this gorgeous overlook where you can show off the San Juan mountains to friends and family for your ceremony. The grass venue overlooking Telluride can accommodate up to 250 guests.\n\nThe price for renting out San Sophia Overlook starts at $5,000.\n\nFor venue availability, you can reach out to their coordinator at weddings@tellurideskiresort.com\n\nSAPPHIRE POINT OVERLOOK ELOPEMENTS\n\nSapphire Point Overlook used to be one of my favorite spots to catch the sunset after a long day on the mountain. Perched at 9,500 feet, it offers a breathtaking view of Dillon Reservoir, a large lake with a squiggly, forested coastline surrounded by the famous Gore Range.\n\nSapphire Point is an ideal location year-round for couples eloping in Colorado because you can drive up to the site and rent out two-hour blocks for your ceremony. It’s a wonderful choice for couples who want to include family members!\n\n*2024 UPDATES: According to Recreation.com, Sapphire Point reservation system is unavailable for new reservation.\n\nCOLORADO ELOPEMENTS IN NATIONAL PARKS\n\nLooking to elope against the stunning backdrop of Colorado? While it might not have as many national parks as some states, don’t count it out just yet! Colorado still serves up some jaw-dropping scenery for your intimate ceremony. Keep in mind though, most of these spots require permits for elopements, and they often have designated areas for weddings. This can actually be a plus if you’re planning to include family in your elopement!\n\nBut here’s a pro tip: Think about timing. The day of the week and the time of day can drastically affect how private your ceremony feels. I know. a lot of hidden gems in Colorado that don’t require permits and offer the same breathtaking views. So, if you’re not keen on the permit hassle, just give me a shout, and we’ll uncover some of those lesser-known locations together!\n\nROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK ELOPEMENTS\n\nI don’t venture into Rocky Mountain National Park all that much because of the permits and crowds, but it definitely has a draw for its views. I think it’s gotten less popular over the years for elopements as the permits have become harder and more competitive to get. But if you’re lucky enough, you’ll have a great experience at one of their designated spots. Dream Lake, Bear Lake, and Sprague Lake are some of the most popular spots to take photos at and have ceremonies at in the park. Please make sure to only have ceremonies in designated spots!\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, the cost to get married in the park is $300 and comes with a reserved ceremony location.\n\n*2024 UPDATES: According to the park, all dates for the months of July through September 2024 are fully booked.\n\nGREAT SAND DUNES NATIONAL PARK ELOPEMENTS\n\nFun fact: Colorado hosts North America’s tallest sand dunes, the Great Sand Dunes. It’s an otherworldly sight, with rippling sands framed by mountains and a vast valley. This remote location, meaning you’ll feel like you’re walking among the stars on moonless nights! The dunes offer a unique experience, perfect for couples seeking a different kind of backdrop for their Colorado elopement.\n\nAccording to NPS.GOV, you must apply and pay anywhere from $50 – $250 for the photography permit at the Great Sand Dunes National Park.\n\nESTES PARK ELOPEMENTS\n\nQuaint, old-school Estes Park is the base camp for all things in Rocky Mountain National Park. Estes is known for its wildlife (which have around 3,000 elk around Estes!) and is surrounded by miles of jagged peaks, secluded forests, open tundra, and the famous Stanley Hotel from ‘The Shining’! ‘Red rum, Red, Rum.’ Estes Park is the perfect spot for those eloping in Colorado and wanting convenient services, good food, and big views.\n\nGARDEN OF THE GODS & COLORADO SPRINGS ELOPEMENTS\n\nAlright, let’s talk Colorado Springs and Garden of the Gods—they’re practically a package deal! When you think of Colorado, Garden of the Gods is that iconic spot that just can’t be missed. Those towering red rocks against the backdrop of Pikes Peak? Pure magic. It’s like nature’s own cathedral, tailor-made for couples seeking an unforgettable elopement in Colorado Springs.\n\nNow, what’s even better? The ceremony spots in Garden of the Gods are absolutely free. First-come, first-served basis means you’ve got to beat the crowd and stake your claim.\n\nAccording to Coloradosprings.gov, there are six free ceremony spots at Garden of the Gods.\n\nCHOOSING YOUR COLORADO ELOPEMENT LOCATION\n\nEloping in Colorado is your golden ticket to an unforgettable adventure set against a stunning backdrop! With a landscape as diverse as your dreams, each spot has its own story of excitement and magic, offering unique experiences just waiting to be discovered. The photos and list above are really meant for inspiration and as a starting point to get started before we nail down the exact spot together.\n\nBut there are some main things you should consider when narrowing down the selection of your elopement spot.\n\nYour elopement location should resonate with you—Was there photo from above that got you super stoked? Was there a place on that trip where you shared a special moment together? This place should inspire and be unique to you!\n\nWhen choosing a place to elope, consider the season. If you’re on the hunt for those pristine alpine lakes and fields bursting with wildflowers, summer’s your golden ticket. But remember, accessibility is key when picking your spot!\n\nProximity and practicality is huge, especially if you are having guests! A lot of couples choose to keep things close to Denver to make things easy, but Colorado is a big state and there are some awesome spots if you are willing to travel!\n\nHow popular is the elopement location? Certain areas of Colorado tend to draw more attention than others. I make it my mission to team up with every couple, pinpointing those hidden locations where privacy and intimacy are guaranteed to elevate your experience to the next level!\n\nAre you having guests? You should probably consider a location that does not require long distances of driving such as places in the front range. You can choose a location in more secluded parts of the state, but you might have to fly to smaller airports.\n\nConsider the activities. There are some places in Colorado that better than others for hiking, rock climbing, backpacking, and off roading.\n\nHOW TO PLAN AND ELOPE IN COLORADO\n\nThere’s no single path to eloping in Colorado, but I’ve got a pretty good elopement process after 5 years of doing this thing and I’m here to hold your hand.

Remember, everything you pack must be carried in on the hike, so consider the weight of the fabric, especially for wedding dresses, which can be heavy.\n\nAs you hike in for your elopement, you’ll be in your regular outdoor clothes, so wear whatever attire keeps you comfortable and suits the weather conditions. Weather can be unpredictable, and higher elevations can be considerably colder, so pack layers accordingly.\n\nOnce we reach your elopement location, you’ll change into your wedding attire, and it’s time to exchange vows! Bonus points: Getting-ready photos for an adventure elopement are absolutely priceless!\n\n• SKIN PROTECTION\n\nSunscreen is an absolute must, especially when you’re up high soaking in the rays in Colorado or on snowy terrain.
