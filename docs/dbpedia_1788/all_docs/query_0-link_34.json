        "text": "Top 10 Best-Selling Two-Way Radios in Gresham, Oregon\n\n1. Motorola MOTOTRBO CP200d\n\nThe MOTOTRBO CP200d is known for its simplicity and affordability. The lightweight, rugged, and IP54-rated waterproof design makes it a top choice for excellent audio quality and superior coverage in any industry.\n\n2. Motorola MOTOTRBO SL300\n\nThe Motorola SL300 is designed for ease of use, featuring an ultra-slim design, curved edges, and a short antenna that can fit comfortably in a hand or pocket. Despite its small size, this radio offers enhanced range in a compact casing.\n\n3. BearCom BC300D\n\nOur BC300D digital two-way radio is produced by Motorola, specifically for BearCom. Boasting a lightweight, compact, and easy-to-use design, the BC300D offers the coverage and clarity of cutting-edge DMR digital technology.\n\n4. DTR700\n\nThe Motorola DTR700 is one of the few business class radios that does not require an FCC license.Â Most radios designated for business use must go through an FCC license process that includes FCC coordination, granting of the license by the FCC and finally construction notification to the FCC when you start operating your two-way radio system.Â Donât worry, at BearCom, we can handle all of that process at a very competitive rate and make sure you and your radio system are FCC compliant.Â But with the DTR700, you donât have to go through that expense and time.Â The DTR700 operates on special 900mhz frequencies, set aside by the FCC to be license free for business operation.Â This is a great radio to get up and running fast and being digital and on the 900mhz frequency band means you can expect excellent range with secure and private channels.Â In addition to traditional group calling that you would expect with a two-way radio system, the DTR700 also allows you to make and receive private calls from an easy to use contact list that you can see on its color display.\n\n5.
