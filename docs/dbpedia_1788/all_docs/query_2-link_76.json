        "text": "Do you ever feel like bridal terminology is a foreign language? All those phrases like \"fingertip length\", \"cathedral length\" and \"drop wedding veil\" are enough to make your head spin!\n\nWell I am here to break it down for you in this simple and easy guide that will help you to decide whether you should wear a long or short wedding veil.\n\nThere are 2 main factors that go into determining the best length for your veil. You should consider:\n\nthe silhouette of your wedding dress\n\nthe style and formality of your wedding and venue\n\nWe will be discussing both of these in more detail as we figure out what the best length and style is for you and your wedding dress.\n\n1) Silhouette of your wedding dress\n\nFuller A-Line and Ballgown Wedding Dresses\n\nIn general, ballgown style wedding dresses or fuller gowns look more balanced with veils that are longer and more voluminous. You need a bit of volume and length in your wedding veil to look balanced and proportional with all that fabric of your wedding dress. Your dress is already dramatic, so you need a veil that matches the drama of your dress by elegantly extending beyond the train of your wedding dress. Long veils are perfect for the princess bride, the Cinderella-inspired bride, or for the bride who really wants to make a statement.\n\nCathedral length veils (that are generally beyond 100 inches in length), chapel length veils (that are around 90''), and floor length veils (that just gently skim the floor) are the most popular long veils. All of them will drag on the floor, making a striking visual impact that will impress your guests.\n\nLet's take a look at a few examples of fuller gowns with longer veils...\n\nSheath Dresses and Other Slimmer Cut Wedding Dresses\n\nDresses that are more form-fitting and without a lot of volume work beautifully with shorter veils so that the veil does not overshadow your dress. So if you have a column style dress, a mermaid dress, a trumpet dress, or basically any slim cut dress then you should look into a mid-length or shorter wedding veil. Consider a fingertip veil (that ends at the fingertips), or an elbow veil (that ends at the elbows) to match the more modern look of your wedding dress.\n\nLet's take a look at a few examples of slim wedding dresses with shorter veils...\n\n2) Style and Formality of Your Wedding\n\nWhat is your wedding style or feeling that you are trying to evoke? Are you having a more formal church wedding or is your ceremony and reception more laid-back and casual with a boho vibe? Different wedding veil lengths can be more appropriate for different styles of ceremonies and receptions.\n\nLonger veils\n\nLong veils are more traditionally worn for formal and elegant weddings where brides want a sense of ceremony and royal opulence. Extravagance, formality, and grandeur are the name of the game for chapel and cathedral veils, and they make for an incredibly dramatic walk down the aisle. Not to mention they allow you to capture some stunning wedding photos!\n\nYou should ask yourself these questions:\n\nAre you getting married in a church or cathedral?\n\nAre you having a \"black-tie\", formal wedding?\n\nAre you having a huge wedding with lots of guests in a grand, spacious ceremony space?\n\nIf you answered \"YES\" to any of the above, then maybe you should consider the more traditional long veil so that your wedding day look is just as formal and grand as your event and venue.\n\nShorter Veils\n\nMaybe you are more of a \"go with the flow\" bride who wants a rustic, casual party vibe for your special day. You want something chic, stylish, and no-fuss. A shorter blusher, elbow or fingertip veil has your name written all over it.\n\nBasically, you want a veil that is not so long that it touch the ground so that you are able to move around freely. A short or mid-length veil is a bridal accessory that is ideal for the fun, flirty, playful bride. It also works for brides who are nontraditional and who want a bridal day look with an alternative flair.\n\nIf you are having an outdoor wedding, then a shorter veil is easier to move around in. A long veil can get caught up in the wind more and be a bit more cumbersome as you walk around. It's not that you cannot do it - I have had plenty of brides who get married outside who do choose a long veil. It is just that you will require the help of your bridesmaids a bit more as you move around.\n\nSo Long or Short Veil?\n\nSo in conclusion, long cathedral and chapel veils are more suited for wedding dresses that are fuller and for ceremonies that are more formal in nature. Shorter elbow and fingertip length veils are more appropriate for slimmer wedding dresses and for weddings that are more casual and relaxed.\n\nBut please keep in mind that these tips are not hard and fast rules! These are just general style tips to get you thinking about what you may want for your fairy tale ending."
