        "text": "Looking for more hikes in the Cascades along Stevens Pass?\n\nCheck out my reviews for hiking to Heybrook Lookout and the Iron Goat Trail.\n\nCURRENT INFO\n\nTrail reviews are available on the WTA (Washington Trails Association) website. Good info and maps are also included in the book Best Hikes with Kids: Western Washington by Susan Elderkin. As a popular hike, it’s listed in many other guidebooks as well, such as Moon Washington Hiking by Craig Hill. Many books pair it together with Lake Serene, a longer hike that shares the same trailhead.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nSince Bridal Veil Falls is on National Forest land, you can hang an America the Beautiful pass (or other national parks pass) in your car window to cover the parking fee. Some individuals, including veterans and fourth graders, may qualify for a free pass. You can also purchase an annual Northwest Forest Pass for $30 or a day pass for $5. It’s generally easiest to purchase these passes online ahead of time, but you can also purchase them from a local vendor. Personally, I recommend the America the Beautiful pass if you can afford it, because it covers entrance fees for all national lands, including national parks.\n\nBridal Veil Falls share the same trailhead as Lake Serene, a longer 8.2-mile hike with twice the elevation gain of Bridal Veil Falls. The two hikes share the same trail until the the path to Bridal Veil Falls branches off to the right for the final half mile to the waterfall.\n\nThe trailhead parking lot is large, but can fill up, especially on sunny summer weekends. Try going early, on a weekday, or in late spring or fall. Visiting on a cloudy, cooler day like we did also means fewer crowds. The trail is typically covered in snow and impassable throughout the winter and into mid-spring.\n\nVault toilets and garbage bins are available at the trailhead.\n\nPets are allowed on the trail on leash.\n\nBecause of the rocky and sometimes muddy and slippery nature of this trail, boots or shoes with good traction are a must. Hiking poles are also recommended but not required.\n\nAlways follow Leave No Trace principles.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nBridal Veil Falls is an impressive waterfall at any time of year. Sliding down the rock face of Mt. Index for more than 1,300 feet, it’s impossible to take in the entirety of the seven-tier waterfall. The two tiers that are visible from the viewpoint don’t disappoint, however, and the view across the mountain pass to the north is also a treat.\n\nTHE KIDS’ TAKE\n\nFor adventurous kids with hiking experience, Bridal Veil Falls is a great hike. It’s starts off fairly gentle, but turns into a parkour course over the final half mile to the falls. My boys loved this part. The waterfall is also a great spot for a snack break — you’ve earned it! Just be sure your kids stay on the trail and use care on the muddy, slippery rocks and stairs. As always, exercise caution when venturing out near waterfalls and rushing rivers.\n\nWHILE YOU’RE HERE\n\nHearty hikers with a day to spare can extend their hike to Lake Serene, an enchanting alpine lake located another 1000 feet above the Bridal Veil Falls viewpoint. Other nearby hiking options abound, such as the two-mile hike to Heybrook Lookout. Deception Falls is a great option further east along Highway 2. Stop here for a picnic and a beautiful half mile loop through the woods and past thundering Deception Falls. The Iron Goat Trail is another favorite, and can easily be adapted for a shorter or longer hike. For year-round hiking, check out Wallace Falls, an incredibly popular trail near Gold Bar.\n\nIf all this hiking makes you hungry, Zeke’s Drive In, located a short drive west of the trailhead on Highway 2, is the place to go. Zeke’s offers good burgers and sandwiches (especially the delicious patty dip), and excellent shakes. I’m pleased to say that on our recent visit, the fries were also nicely crispy! They have plenty of outdoor seating, offer free mini-ice cream cones for dogs, and your kids can watch the trains scream by on the opposite side of the highway. It’s a win for everyone!\n\nIn need of caffeine? Stop by the Espresso Chalet, located just a few minutes’ drive east of Bridal Veil Falls on Highway 2. Known for its Harry Henderson Sasquatch statue, the Chalet is more than just a roadside curiosity. Come here for good coffee and outdoor seating with mountain views.\n\nIt was a cloudy afternoon, the kind of day us northwesterners find so refreshing after tiring of the summer heat (we need a little damp and cool from time to time so we don’t melt). Cloudy days are ideal for waterfall hikes, so we headed for Bridal Veil Falls along Stevens Pass.\n\nThis area was once home to mining and logging, so the trail starts out, as many do, following an old road through the forest. This section was damp, but not especially muddy, and the woods had that fantastic earthy fresh smell that blooms after a rain shower.\n\nFrom time to time, the trail narrowed and became rockier, giving us a taste of what was ahead. There were a few puddles and minor stream crossings, but nothing too bad. It was easy to imagine how muddy this trail must get during the late spring or early summer snowmelt, or during wet fall weather. Frequent dips in the trail, eroded by recurring seasonal streams, and dry creekbeds made it clear that we were visiting during a “dry” time of year.\n\nAs we neared the turnoff for Bridal Veil Falls, the forest opened up, providing us with beautiful views across Stevens Pass to the north. Shrouded in clouds, the mountains had an ethereal, mystical quality about them.\n\nBefore long, we reached the spur trail to Bridal Veil Falls, where a small wood sign directed us to the right. At this point, the trail immediately starts a steep ascent toward the waterfall, while the trail to Serene Lake dips down and appears much gentler. Don’t let this fool you; the trip to Lake Serene takes hikers on a steep series of switchbacks, ascending 1000 feet above Bridal Veil Falls. If you want to visit both the waterfall and the lake, it’s suggested you stop by Bridal Veil Falls first, otherwise you may be tempted just to skip it altogether on your way back down.\n\nWith the kids, not to mention the fact that we didn’t even start our hike until 2:30, we opted to skip Lake Serene. The final half mile to Bridal Veil Falls provides a good idea of what to expect on these steep mountain trails, however, with plenty of roots and rocks to navigate.\n\nAnd stairs — lots and lots of stairs! The first series or stairs were relatively dry, and they were certainly easier than climbing over mounds of sharp boulders. But as we encountered more stairs (oh yes, there were more), they became muddier and muckier.\n\nFortunately, the mud was a sign that we were nearing the falls. At the end of the trail, a small loop takes hikers on a final bumpy path right to the base of one of Bridal Veil Falls’ many tiers. By now, the sound of rushing water filled our ears, and we all stood in awe at the display before us.\n\nWell, we stood in awe briefly at any rate. Then the boys began clamoring for a snack. But who could blame them? After that trek, anyone would be hungry. I passed out some snacks before we made our way down to the lower viewpoint.\n\nFrom the lower vantage point, it was easier to take in the scale of Bridal Veil Falls, although it was still difficult to comprehend that what we saw was only a portion of this giant waterfall. Because the water level was relatively low, we walked carefully out across the exposed rocks in the river for more views. Below this point, the water disappeared suddenly, dropping down another tier and out of view. This gave us another wide open look across the highway to the mountains beyond.\n\nAfter enjoying the sights and sounds of Bridal Veil Falls, we turned to head back down. On and on the stairs stretched below us, but this time we knew what to expect. The kids stepped nimbly down the muddy planks, and ably navigated the obstacle course of roots and rocks.\n\nBack on the main trail, the going was easy again. Sure, there were the occasional rocks and streams, but nothing we couldn’t handle. We reached the trailhead in high spirits. For an afternoon adventure, Bridal Veil Falls is hard to beat!"
