        "text": "The mountains and foothills of Western North Carolina are laced with waterfalls, from the majestic Whitewater Falls, highest east of the Mississippi, to simple, small, burbling but beautiful falls found in branches and creeks, especially after a rain.\n\nThe beauty of these natural wonders offers spiritual as well as physical refreshment and renewal. The chilly mountain waters at the foot of many falls collects in natural swimming holes. Wildlife drink from the crystal clear waters, anglers search out trout that lurk beneath the surface at the foot of many waterfalls. (Photo: Whitewater Falls by Mark File, romanticasheville.com.)\n\nWaterfalls in the Far West\n\nYellow Creek Falls, Middle Falls, and Sassafras Falls are worth seeking out in Graham County in the far western part of the region."
