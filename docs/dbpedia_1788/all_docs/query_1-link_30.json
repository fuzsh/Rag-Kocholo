The road was washed out about 2½ miles in, but after a short gauntlet of swampy, log-filled terrain in a wetland restoration project, you’ll reach Multnomah Basin Road. A quiet loop can be made by circling back up over Devils Rest and then down user trails in lovely forest, on what is sometimes called the Bridal Veil Plateau, to the trailhead on Palmer Mill Road. Note that these trails are unofficial and, although there are a lot of new signs, those unfamiliar with the area need to navigate precisely in order to avoid getting lost.\n\nYou can complete this loop at any time of year when snow levels are amenable. The only slightly challenging section of the route is the navigation of the restoration project in Bridal Veil Creek above the Palmer Mill Road Washout. This is easier in the summer and fall, but at other seasons, you may want to bring water shoes to help your passage.\n\nBefore hiking up past the gate, walk to the road bridge to get your best views up and down Bridal Veil Creek. Below on the upstream side is the site of the original Palmer Mill, which burned down during the 1902 Yacolt Burn, a series of fires which actually began on the Oregon side of the Columbia River Gorge but which destroyed far more acreage in Washington. The mill, and its attendant complex of structures, was relocated two miles upstream.\n\nAfter passing the gate, you’ll reach Palmer Mill Road proper. (You may be relieved to know that target shooting is prohibited within ⅛ mile of Palmer Mill Road.) Thirty yards after reaching the main track, you’ll see a rough trail descending to the road on your left - this is return route. Big-leaf maple, Douglas-fir, red alder, and cottonwood shade parts of the road; at this lower level the track is sometimes mowed. You’ll get some views down to Bridal Veil Creek rushing below. Massive stumps on the slope attest to the big old growth that once thrived here. Salmonberry, devil’s club, sword fern, and elderberry form a thick understory.\n\nAfter 1½ miles, you’ll see a rusting, overgrown gate on the right. This blocks a road that leads down to Bridal Veil Creek and then once crossed a bridge to ascend the other side of the canyon to reach the mill town of Palmer, which was razed in 1945 after the Bridal Veil Lumbering Company abandoned it. You’re now crossing a tongue of land belonging to a logging company, and you’ll begin to see a few younger tree plantations; however, there hasn’t been any logging on this side of the creek for a few decades.\n\nAbout 1.8 miles from the trailhead, there’s a small clearing on the left with a trail sign. This is the southern end of the She Devil Trail. Keep hiking up the road bed though, noting how the soft road embankment is riddled with mountain beaver burrows. More shrubbery encloses the road now, but there is still a wide path. Across Bridal Veil Creek, you may be able to discern a large quarry. Soon after this, you’ll pass above an alder bottomland and see a Forest Service boundary marker. Then you’ll come to the area where Palmer Mill Road was washed away by the creek a number of years ago.\n\nThe next section is perhaps the most challenging as the Forest Service completed a rehabilitation project here that has allowed Bridal Veil Creek to braid all over the old road bed. Sedges and rushes have established themselves to create a new wetland! You have to stick to the creek/road corridor, but you’ll be crossing and reusing various channels of Bridal Veil Creek. Sometimes these are stepovers, but for others you’ll have to balance across logs, which can be very slippery when wet. There’s a path on the left at first, but it switches back and forth from one side of the corridor to the other. Thankfully, this section is not too long (about 0.4 miles), and then the road bed branches left away from the creek to climb a steep bank of gravel. From here the old road bed has been churned up but is easy walking to a boulder barrier and brown gate at the junction with the Multnomah Basin Road.\n\nTurn left, and follow Multnomah Basin Road, which is off-limits to public vehicles, through mature, quiet but previously logged forest. The road rises gently to a junction with an old logging road, where you’ll stay right to descend. Where the road levels, walk through a huge, mossy log cutting to take a short tie trail which reaches the Devils Rest Trail. You may get some glimpses of Mount Adams through the trees.\n\nYou’re now on the edge of the rim above the Wahkeena Bowl. Turn left on the Devils Rest Trail, getting views down to the Columbia River, with Larch Mountain and Silver Star Mountain behind the Cruzatt Rim. The rugged cliffs of Devils Rest loom ahead. Soon, you’ll also be able to pick out Mount Saint Helens. You’ll enter a small area of canopy burn from the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire and cross a couple of footbridges. A viewpoint close to the trail offers a great vista east to Hamilton Mountain, Table Mountain, and Mount Adams. A longer side trail leads to a clifftop viewpoint which produces the best views of the hike. Views extend across the Wahkeena Bowl below to Mount Saint Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Silver Star Mountain, Archer Mountain, Hamilton Mountain, Beacon Rock, Birkenfeld Mountain, and Table Mountain.\n\nFrom here, the trail first passes a \"To Primrose Path\" sign indicating the new Shy Devil Trail, and then switchbacks and winds up in unburned woods. From a junction, you’ll see the mossy boulders of Devils Rest, one of those Boring volcanoes, up to the right. The prominence is entirely surrounded by trees, but you’ll get glimpses of the Columbia River below through a screen of burned conifers.\n\nDescend from Devils Rest, keep right at the junction, and soon arrive at the junction with the She Devil Trail, which you’ll follow to the left. This trail winds around in deep woods with an oxalis, Oregon grape, and sword fern carpet. You’ll pass the short Li’l Devil Trail coming in from the left (a connector to The Way) and then come to the junction with the Devils Fork and its coyly posed host. Shortly after this, look for a trail leading down to the left with a “Smith Road” sign posted on a tree. This is the continuation of the She Devil Trail.\n\nThe She Devil drops to cross the salmonberry-choked bed of Smith Road. You’ll enjoy the mossy, spongy tread as it meanders under a dense canopy of Douglas-fir and hemlock. The trail continues to descend a slope and reaches Smith Road again at a sign for the She Devil Trail. Turn left here, and follow the road bed to a sign that says “Devils Rest 1.2.”\n\nThe Vacuum Cleaner Trail, a.k.a. the Oil Pan Trail, turns sharply off Smith Road here. You’ll pass under arching bowers of vine maple and through small bracken clearings. The trail often follows another road bed but also detours off of it. After crossing a salmonberry/alder junction, you’ll rise to an old road junction and make a sharp left. (You may notice the remains of a long-discarded vacuum cleaner here.) Through the trees to the right, you can see the Columbia River. Where another old road comes in from the right, there are more “artifacts” and old trash, including tires and the “oil pan”. The route winds down, and you need to keep right at a junction. More old trash appears, and a makeshift footbridge takes you across a small creek. Then the route passes through a salmonberry thicket on a grassy road bed and arrives at sign for the Bullet Car Trail.\n\nThe Bullet Car is a worthy ⅓ mile diversion. You’ll drop to cross a three-log footbridge and pass under a mossy vine maple bower among alders to then negotiate the well-signed Ariel’s Footbridge, which apparently serves both mermaids and humans. At a junction, keep right into a thicket and you’ll immediately encounter the Bullet Car, a perforated, upside-down 1941 Chrysler.\n\nReturn to the Vacuum Cleaner Trail, and continue right to hike down along the edge of a steep ridge. The trail turns at a pile of old tires and heads down the slope above Bridal Veil Creek. After a sharp switchback, look for a trail heading down to the right off the main road bed.\n\nThis route, down a steep logging track, is a shortcut to Palmer Mill Road. Bridal Veil Creek can be heard rushing below. You‘ll switchback and descend steeply to Palmer Mill Road, where you turn right to get back to your vehicle.\n\nMaps\n\nMaps: Hike Finder\n\nNOTE: The user-created trails between Devils Rest and Palmer Mill Road are not shown on these maps:\n\nGreen Trails Maps: Bridal Veil, OR #428\n\nGreen Trails Maps: Columbia River Gorge - West #428S\n\nGeo-Graphics: Trails of the Columbia Gorge\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service/Bureau of Land Management: Columbia River Gorge\n\nNational Geographic Trails Illustrated Map: Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area\n\nFees, Regulations, etc.\n\nTrails that are user-maintained do not appear on official maps\n\nIf active logging signs are posted on Palmer Mill Road, do not enter.\n\nTrip Reports\n\nSearch Trip Reports for Palmer Mill Road Devils Rest\n\nDevils Rest, Monday, April 22\n\nPalmer Mill Road-Devils Rest-She-Devil-Vacuum Cleaner Loop 11-14-23\n\nFun explorations on the Bridal Veil Plateau, Sunday, Feb. 13th\n\nPalmer Mill Decommissioned Roads\n\nBullet Car 12/21/18\n\nRevisiting Bridal Veil Plateau and the Primrose Path\n\nLost Trail Treasures near Bridal Veil\n\nMore Lost Trails in the Gorge\n\nForgotten road ramble in the Gorge\n\nPalmer Mill - Devils Rest Loop - 01/27/13\n\nA Big Loop Around Devils Rest 19-Jan-2013\n\nRelated Discussions / Q&A\n\nSearch Trail Q&A for Palmer Mill Road Devils Rest\n\nGuidebooks that cover this hike\n\nnone\n\nPalmer Mill Road and the Bridal Veil Drainage (Recreating the Columbia River Highway)\n\nPalmer Mill Expedition (Ride With GPS)\n\nPalmer Mill Trail (All Trails)\n\nGhost Town of Palmer, Oregon (Pacific Northwest Photoblog)\n\n“Palmer and Brower, Oregon” (The Columbia River: A Photographic Journey)\n\nContributors"
