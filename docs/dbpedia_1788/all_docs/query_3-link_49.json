        "text": "Wedding Hair Accessories:\n\nEverything You Need to Know\n\nYou’ve spent hours daydreaming about your ideal wedding gown, but have you thought about your wedding hair accessories? Bridal hair accessories aren’t only beautiful, they can add a sense of elegance and uniqueness to your ensemble on the big day. Between wedding tiaras, wedding headbands, and traditional bridal veils, there are plenty of different kinds of gorgeous wedding hair accessories available, so you are sure to find the right fit for you. Whether you’re looking for a regal wedding tiara or a dainty, delicate comb, with a little research, you’ll be well on your way to finding the perfect bridal hair accessories.\n\nBecause sometimes it’s easiest to find inspiration for your own wedding outfits by looking at other brides, browsing our library of weddings, which has over 10,000 weddings from all over the world, can be a great first step in determining what type of wedding hair accessories you gravitate to. You’ll find hundreds of images of wedding headbands, wedding flower crowns, and of course wedding veils, and can filter the results by season, location, or wedding theme to best match what you’re looking for. Having a winter wedding in a grand, opulent ballroom? You might go with a wedding tiara. Is a casual beachside wedding in the Caribbean more your vibe? Some simple wedding hair flowers that are local to the area may be all you need. If you are looking for something unique for your bridal hair, you’ll come across plenty of custom-made wedding hair accessories too.\n\nNo matter what you are looking for to make your bridal hair stand out, you’re sure to find amazing ideas in our wedding library. The wide range of options you’ll come across may help you narrow down what kind of wedding hair accessories you like. Then, get in touch with the designers who created your favorites.\n\nHow do you choose the perfect wedding hair accessories?\n\nIf you are looking to add your own personal flair to your wedding, bridal hair accessories are an excellent tool because they allow you to express your personality. What could be more unique than a custom wedding tiara? Experts know that there is a lot more to know about bridal hair, wedding veils, and other hair accessories than meets the eye. If you’re looking for something less traditional than a wedding veil, there are tons of unique wedding hair accessories—and we don’t just mean flower crowns. But also big fans of a traditional wedding veil as well, and will guide you through the different wedding veil lengths and styles. Once you step your foot into the world of bridal hair accessories, you’ll find that the some of the most popular options include everything from jeweled wedding tiaras atop a cathedral-length veil, to ornate wedding headbands, to bohemian-inspired wedding flower crowns that are ethereal all on their own. When it comes to bridal hair accessories, flowers are a popular choice—and with good reason. However, the decision of which wedding hair accessories to wear itself can prove difficult. Luckily there are a few components of your big day that can help guide you in the right direction:\n\nWedding Dress Style\n\nThe first step of selecting your bridal hair accessories is ensuring that they complement your wedding dress. Think of your wedding dress as the main event that anchors your total ook. You’ll want to ensure that your wedding hair accessories, jewelry, and shoes all complement the beauty of your wedding dress—not take away from it. If you have a simple dress with little to no embellishment, there is more leeway for you to get creative with your wedding hair accessories. In this case, you might opt for bridal hair flowers, a wedding flower crown, or one of the many ornate wedding headbands that are out there. If your wedding dress is glamorous and ornate, a muted hairstyle and veil will accent your wedding look without detracting from the gown. In addition, consider the hue of your wedding dress when selecting your wedding hair accessories. If your dress is cream-colored or blush, you’ll want to ensure any lace or fabric hair accessories that you select are in the same shade.\n\nWedding Venue\n\nYour wedding venue should also be taken into consideration when you’re choosing your wedding hair accessories. There are certain bridal hair accessories that will particularly complement your venue and your wedding dress. For instance, if your nuptials are taking place in a church, you might opt for a cathedral-length wedding veil instead of a beach-reception-ready wedding flower crown. You’ll find that the average price of a cathedral-length wedding veil is well worth feeling confident and and making your grand entrance in a religious setting. Other well-paired accessories would be birdcage bridal veils at a courthouse vs. a wedding tiara at a French château. Dreaming of bridal hair flowers for your reception after removing your wedding ceremony veil? You can ask your wedding hairstylist to switch up your bridal hair after you say “I do.”\n\nFormality of Event\n\nYou’ve considered your wedding dress itself, as well as your venue. But how formal is your big day? If you are having an ornate ballroom wedding, bridal tiaras might be a better fit than bohemian bridal hair flowers or flower crowns for weddings. Stylish and upscale bridal headbands, however, could be the perfect compromise. When working with your wedding hairstylist to choose the ideal style for the big day, you should mention to them how formal the event will be. This could help them create an appropriate look and guide you towards the perfect wedding hair accessories.\n\nWedding Hairstyle\n\nYour wedding day is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and you’ll have pictures documenting your bridal hair forever. For this reason, it’s essential that you are happy with your bridal hair. Some brides have dreamed of their wedding hair for years. Others begin to think of which wedding hairstyles they like when they get engaged. No matter which type of bride you are, if you have a wedding hairstyle that stands out to you, mention it to your wedding hairstylist. Your wedding hairstylist has years of experience making wedding hair dreams come true, and can find the perfect hairstyle to wear under a veil, or with any other hair accessories. Therefore, if you communicate your wedding hair expectations and wishes to your hairstylist, they will work diligently to create the bridal hair of your dreams. If you’ve always dreamed of your very own wedding tiara, now is the time to mention it. Or, if you’ve thought about working with your wedding florist to transform some of your wedding blooms into a wedding flower crown, you can discuss this with your wedding hairstylist, too. Sometimes, brides don’t have as clear of a vision about their desired wedding hairstyles, and that’s okay! In this case, you can work with your wedding hairstylist to try on different types of wedding hair accessories. They might also have some ideas for bridal hair accessories that suit your venue, event formality, and wedding dress, so bring pictures.\n\nWhat are the different types of wedding hair accessories?\n\nWedding veils and flower crowns and bridal combs, oh my! To say there are a variety of bridal hair accessories options would be an understatement. In fact, there are so many different kinds of wedding hair accessories—particularly when it comes to wedding veils—that you might not have heard of all of them. In addition to the traditional wedding veils, there are also new and noteworthy wedding hair accessories on the market.\n\nWedding Headbands:\n\nWedding headbands can be as simple or ornate as you’d like. When it comes to the different types of wedding hair accessories, wedding headbands are a fan favorite because of how comfortable and easy to wear they are. They have a classic, timeless feel that can either be sweet or a statement. In addition, wedding headbands can actually be paired with a variety of different wedding hairstyles—and wedding veils. Whether you’re planning on wearing bouncy curls for the big day, or you’re getting a wedding hair updo, a wedding headband can be the perfect accent. If you have long hair, you must check out the selection of wedding headbands. Because wedding headbands come in myriads of styles, try on a few.\n\nWedding Tiaras & Wedding Crowns:\n\nA wedding tiara or crown is the go-to for elegant brides looking to elevate their wedding day hair to regal levels. A wedding tiara or crown are best suited to a glamorous ballroom wedding venue, or an opulent estate. In addition, you can work with your wedding hairstylist to find a hairstyle that suits your wedding tiara best. Choices range from a classic wedding updo to soft, beautiful waves. Wedding tiaras are elegant wedding hair accessories that work indoors and outdoors. In addition, you should note the differences between a wedding crown and a wedding tiara. A wedding crown differs from a tiara in that it fits farther back on the head. Bridal tiaras will add an elegance to your look.\n\nWedding Hair Flowers\n\nKeep your wedding blooms centerstage by adorning yourself with wedding hair flowers. Not only are wedding hair flowers chic, they also seamlessly tie your florals in with your wedding look. A bohemian or beach bride might also decide to confer with their wedding florist about a wedding flower crown, or you could go with a single blossom. When it comes to wedding hair flowers, there is no end to the imagination. When it comes to bridal hair accessories, flowers are ideally suited for also showing off bridal hair clips, wedding hair pins, or ribbons and bows.\n\nWedding Hair Bows\n\nUp next we have the variety of bow and ribbon options for your wedding hair. The minimalist bride might consider a sleek black velvet or white satin ribbon tied as a headband or around a ponytail for their bridal hair. Or you can go big with a white tulle wedding hair bow that makes a statement and nods to the traditional wedding veil. Wedding hair bows and ribbons work with both updos and loose, flowing styles. Ribbons can also make for beautiful wedding hair accessories, especially if they will be featured elsewhere in your reception.\n\nWedding Hair Pins\n\nWedding hair pins add a bit of sparkle to a gorgeous updo. These are a popular wedding hair accessory because they can be as large or as tiny as you’d like. In addition, you can stick with just one or two wedding hair pins, or make more of a statement with multiple. On the big day, your wedding hairstylist will place your wedding hair pins in the perfect spots to showcase their beauty and accentuate your hair. Another option is to add brooches, barrettes, or necklaces as bridal hair accessories.\n\nWedding Hair Combs\n\nThe wedding hair comb is another classic hair accessory, partially because they’re often used to hold a wedding veil in place—and they’re a gorgeous hair accessory once the veil is removed as well! Wedding hair combs range from simple to decorative, so you can find one that matches the aesthetic of your wedding dress. The wedding hair comb is yet another way to personalize your wedding hair to make it unique-to-you. Even if you are not looking to wear a bridal veil, a wedding hair comb is among the beautiful bridal hair accessories on its own. Not only is a wedding hair comb helpful for bridal veils, it’s also a gorgeous piece that can be its own wedding hair accessory during the reception.\n\nWith so many different types of wedding hair accessories available, you truly should have no problem finding one that fits your style. Whether or not you want to wear one of these hair accessories on its own or with a veil, it’s helpful to understand the different types of wedding veils that exist too. Yes, there are even more choices! Much like hemlines, wedding veil lengths go in and out of fashion over time. But the grandeur of Meghan Markle's wedding veil worn in 2018 re-ignited an enthusiasm for all types of bridal veils. As you start to think about your own, it’s helpful to understand the terminology often used for the various wedding veil lengths and styles.\n\nLong Wedding Veils:\n\nAn epic, long wedding veil can make a stunning statement when a bride walks down the aisle. Glamorous and perfect for formal settings, a “cathedral wedding veil” measures about 110 inches at a minimum but can go much longer. Princess Diana’s cathedral wedding veil measured 25 feet, which is why you might hear this style called a “royal length” wedding veil as well. For something nearly as grand but not quite as cumbersome (and better suited to an outdoor wedding venue), a chapel-length wedding veil measures at least 90 inches and falls three or four inches behind the train of the bride’s wedding dress. If you’re looking to make a stunning entrance, one of these long wedding veil styles may be right for you.\n\nMid-length Wedding Veils:\n\nTypically referred to as a “ballet” or “waltz wedding veil,” this medium-length wedding veil is usually between 50 and 60 inches long and falls anywhere between the knee and mid-calf. It is an excellent choice when you like the flair of the cathedral look but do not want your wedding veil to include that much material—particularly if you are getting married at a windy outdoor location, like a mountaintop or New England beach. A similar, slightly shorter option is the “fingertip veil,” which is typically 40 inches in length. For a little more drama, a double-tier wedding veil, or “blusher,” has an additional 30-inch front piece that drapes over the face, and a longer piece in the back.\n\nShort Wedding Veils:\n\nIf you are planning on an outdoor wedding or will have your nuptials at a venue less formal than a cathedral, you might choose a “flyaway wedding veil” that only measures 20 inches and grazes your shoulders. This style still feels celebratory, but is easier to wear longer, and is a fun, feminine flair to pair with more sleek, courthouse wedding looks like a wedding suit or minidress. The shortest option—but not at all lacking in drama—is the “birdcage” style that is a net partially covering the face. If you are thinking of wearing a veil all night long, either of these veil styles are a great fit.\n\nOf course, in addition to the variety of lengths, there are wedding veil styles and materials. Wedding veil details could include lace, embroidery, pearls, rhinestones, blush-colored tulle, or even precious gemstones.\n\nNext, there is the question of how to fasten your wedding veil to your hair. This typically calls for an ornate wedding hair comb or some delicate wedding hairpins. But the beauty of it is that you can be as grand (with a wedding crown) or understated (with an invisible hair comb) as you want.\n\nWhy do brides wear wedding veils?\n\nEarlier we talked about the different types of wedding veils. As a general rule of thumb, selecting your preferred wedding veil types has to do with personal taste and functionality at your chosen venue. However, have you ever wondered why brides wear wedding veils in the first place, and what the history of wedding veils is?\n\nCenturies ago, there were superstitious reasons why brides wore wedding veils. Some historians trace the use of wedding veils back to Roman brides who hid their faces from evil spirits and their jealousy. Other historians point to the ancient meaning of the wedding veil as a sign of purity. It signaled to the groom and his family that they were receiving an untouched maiden into their midst.\n\nSome less romantic folks say that the bridal veil covered the woman’s face during the time of arranged marriages. It may have been to hide her facial expression upon seeing her would-be husband; or, it may have been intended to keep the groom from backing out after seeing his bride-to-be. Today, the wedding veil allows for the romantic gesture of having the bride’s partner lift it during the ceremony, but no longer carries the same rules or superstitions. But what about the other wedding hair accessories options? Wedding tiaras, worn in addition to a bridal veil, symbolized the transition from a single to a married woman. In antiquity, the wedding tiara hinted at the loss of innocence by the crown of love. The wedding crown goes back to Pagan Greece. Back then, it would be a wedding flower crown. In Christianity, this wedding crown came to symbolize a Stefana, which transformed the couple into the king and queen of their home.\n\nToday, you can choose between wedding headbands, bridal tiaras, wedding flower crowns, with little to no symbolic implications, but merely based on your style preferences. Now that you know the history of wedding hair accessories, what a luxury it is to get to choose your own!\n\nHow do you find wedding hair accessories?\n\nOnce you’ve landed on what kind of wedding hair accessories you might prefer for your big day, it’s time to find The One! One of the easiest ways to source romantic and beautiful bridal hair accessories is by browsing our library of weddings to view pictures of real brides who got married at your wedding destination or whose dress style is similar to your gown. Perhaps that winter bride with an off-the-shoulder dress looked fantastic with a wedding crown and simple long veil. Or get inspired by a bride who also got married at your barn wedding venue, and had a sprig of baby’s breath tucked into her half-up hairstylePeruse pictures and make note of any styles of wedding hair accessories that stand out to you, then find out exactly where your favorites came from. If you fall in love with a specific wedding veil or wedding tiara that you see, being able to connect directly to the vendor where the bride got it is extremely helpful.\n\nAnother great wedding hair accessories resource is the boutique where you buy your wedding dress. Some dress stores also sell wedding headbands, bridal combs, and bridal veils. These stores may have a more limited selection than what you might find online, but they could have wedding veil styles that are a true extension of your wedding dress.\n\nIf you’re foregoing the typical bridal veil in favor of something a little less traditional, you can find fantastic options at high-end fashion stores and websites. Many sell bridal hair accessories including wedding headbands, hairpins or necklaces that can be woven through your wedding hairstyle. Or you can do both, and combine an elegant headband or comb with a wedding veil. Whatever you like, discuss your vision with your wedding hairstylist, who will be the one to bring it to life. Your wedding hairstylist is truly an amazing resource for all things bridal hair and accessories. These wedding hair specialists have worked with hundreds of brides who have chosen everything from wedding tiaras to wedding hair flowers to the traditional bridal veil. They may have suggestions for wedding hair accessories that will complement the wedding dress you’ve chosen, as well as how they can style your hair to coordinate with them. Others will coordinate with your florist to craft a wedding flower crown or affix a single bloom to your wedding hairstyle. When it comes to bridal hair, trust that your wedding hairstylist is the expert.\n\nHow much do wedding hair accessories cost?\n\nYou can browse and dream away, but don’t forget to factor wedding veil costs into your budget. Studies show that the average price of a wedding veil is $128. If this seems a little low, it’s important to remember that the average price of a wedding veil is dictated by where the vendor is located, the quality of the materials, and the designer you are purchasing it from. Wedding veil prices also depend largely on the embellishments you choose, and the amount of fabric you need to have cut. Embellishments like embroidery and beading are time-consuming, which means that these different types of wedding hair accessories could easily cost upwards of $500. And, if you have your heart set on a wedding veil by an upscale design house, prepare to spend even more. To put these numbers into perspective, the average cost of a wedding in the US is currently around $33,900, and the average fee for a wedding hairstylist is $110. Here’s a breakdown of what components dictate the price of wedding hair accessories:\n\nMaterials: A wedding crown made of fresh flowers will, no surprise, be less expensive than a wedding tiara made of precious gemstones. Similarly, high-quality fabrics like silk and handmade lace will be more expensive than machine-made synthetic fabrics.\n\nIntricacy: The more intricate the craftsmanship is on wedding veils, bridal headbands, or other bridal hair accessories, the more expensive it will be. Wedding veils with hours and hours worth of hand-stitched embroidery and carefully applied pearls will be more expensive than a simple tulle veil.\n\nCustomization: If you want a custom wedding veil that uses pieces of lace from your dress, or you want to embroider something personal, these special touches will also mean additional costs. An engraved wedding tiara or wedding comb featuring an heirloom jewel requires the hands-on work of an artisan and therefore increases the overall cost of your wedding outfit. Of course, these personalizations make your wedding hair accessories all the more meaningful, so they may be worth the cost.\n\nHow long should you keep your bridal veil on?\n\nWedding veils are the quintessential bridal hair accessories that identify you as a bride. Because a wedding veil is such a beautiful and ornate part of your wedding hair accessories, it’s not unusual for brides to want to wear the wedding veil for as long as possible. However, if you are dealing with a cathedral-length bridal veil, this is not a workable option.\n\nThe wedding veil is traditionally worn for a portion of your wedding photos and during the ceremony. You then remove it before you move into your reception space for dinner and dancing. If you are doing photos before your ceremony including a First Look shot, think about whether you want to be wearing your wedding veil in those photos. If not, make sure there is enough time for your hairstylist to attach bridal veils, wedding tiaras, or bridal headbands between photos and the ceremony.\n\nThat said, shorter wedding veils are easier to wear into the reception because it is easier to move around with them. Bridal veils also contribute to your overall wedding style, and if a wedding tiara or wedding flowers aren’t your thing, you might consider wearing a shorter bridal veil during the reception. However, the majority of brides will opt to show off their wedding hair without a bridal veil—at least after the wedding ceremony is complete.\n\nTalk to your wedding hairstylist about how you can pull off a gorgeous look throughout the reception and after-party. If you want to look your best throughout the festivities, have the stylist stick around to touch up your wedding hair after the ceremony and photos. The same is also a good idea if you are thinking of changing your hair once you take your veil off, or switching from a bridal tiara to a whimsical flower crown after the ceremony. The expert touch of a wedding hairstylist for any hair changes will keep you looking fantastic throughout the celebration.\n\nWhat else should you know about bridal hair accessories?\n\nWhat wedding hairstyle are you planning on wearing for your wedding, and how will that work with a wedding veil or other types of wedding hair accessories like bridal headbands or wedding tiaras? How will the weather play into the celebration? These are all things to consider when you are deciding which wedding hair accessories you would like to incorporate into your big day.\n\nDoes your wedding venue lend itself to one style of hair accessory or another? Good examples are birdcage bridal veils at a courthouse vs. a wedding tiara at a French château.\n\nOnce you narrow down your selection of bridal hair accessories and wedding veils, bring them to your wedding hair trial for your stylist to work with. This will quickly reveal the best wedding hair accessories for your big day. You’ll be able to see if your ideal wedding hairstyle enables you to wear a cathedral bridal veil or if wedding hair flowers would work better. It’s also wise to test wedding veils, crowns with wedding hair flowers, wedding tiaras, or any potentially heavy bridal hair accessories for comfort before the wedding in order to make sure they will not be painful or give you a headache as the night goes on.\n\nRest assured that it’s perfectly fine to change your mind about your wedding hair. You might think you want a wedding flower crown only to realize that a wedding tiara would look better with your desired bridal hair. Or, maybe you realize that an elaborate wedding hair updo isn’t your style, and you’d prefer to wear your hair down with a simple wedding headband. This is your big day, and you want to be sure that you feel both comfortable and beautiful. If you’re uncomfortable with your wedding hair accessories, consult with your wedding hairstylist about other options. With so many bridal hair accessories on the market, you are sure to find the right one with a bit of patience. So remember: if a wedding tiara isn’t the right fit for you, maybe a delicate barrette is!\n\nWhile discussing different wedding hair accessories options with your wedding hairstylist, remember to factor in the location of your nuptials. On a very windy day, a wedding veil may be less cooperative—or it could be beautifully dramatic in photos. Your wedding hair at a high-humidity beach location might be different than what it looks like during your test at the salon downtown, so an updo and some wedding hair flowers might be best\n\nAnother consideration in your selection of bridal hair accessories is what wedding hairstyles and bridal hair accessories you’d like your bridal party to wear on the day of your wedding. If they are wearing hair accessories, yours should be more noticeable and significant.\n\nFor example, if you’ve decided that you and your bridesmaids will wear fresh flower crowns, simply provide your bridesmaids with a toned-down set of bridal hair flowers or a less elaborate wedding flower crown than yours. This will allow your floral wedding crown to shine while maintaining consistency with the bridal party.\n\nWhat’s the next step in finding your wedding hair accessories?\n\nWhether you are enamored with traditional wedding veils, can’t stop thinking about a platinum wedding crown, or envision yourself walking down the aisle with pearl bridal headbands, our wedding vendor directory has the resources you need to find your dream bridal hair accessories.
