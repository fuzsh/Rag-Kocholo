        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nSan Juan Mountains Elopement Locations\n\nThese San Juan Mountains Elopement Locations are some of my favorite locations in Colorado! The San Juan Mountain Range is one of the most distinct and unique mountain ranges in Colorado. They stretch from southwest Colorado to northwest New Mexico. They’re known for their lush green and red mountainsides along with their gray rocky peaks ranging from dark gray to light gray. They have some of Colorado’s bluest lakes. And it’s known for some of the best off-roading trails in the state. Plus with towns like Ouray, Telluride, and Silverton you really can’t go wrong with choosing the San Juan Mountains as an elopement destination.\n\nFrom easily accessible locations where you can just step out of your vehicle and be at the destination to epic hikes and backpacking spots. The San Juan mountains have everything you can possibly imagine for an adventurous elopement location. I’ve written this list of over 30 locations as a guide for those thinking about eloping in Colorado’s Southwest region. You will find locations ranging from easily accessible with a 2WD vehicle and no hike all the way to harder-to-reach locations via either a 4×4 trail or a hike.\n\nThe Towns of the San Juan Mountains\n\nTelluride\n\nTelluride, Colorado is one of the most iconic towns in the state. It’s like it’s own little world. Its packed with epic adventures year round and surrounded by some of the most gorgeous terrain in the state, the San Juan Mountains. Telluride has world class skiing and riding (including heli drops into the backcountry) in the winter. Plus every outdoor enthusiasts dream list of summer adventures like hiking, backpacking, paddle boarding and 4x4ing in the most gorgeous mountain range in the state.\n\nRidgway\n\nIn my mind, Ridgway is the gateway to the San Juans. It’s not until you start getting closer to Ridgway do you begin to see the infamous 14er, Mt. Sneffels. It’s a tiny little town with a beautiful river and park area that runs right through the middle of it. It’s got great tubing in the summer time and a few good restaurants that are worth checking out.\n\nOuray\n\nOuray is known at the “Switzerland of Colorado” and the second you pull into town you’ll see why. It’s got that old wild west movie vibe. Ouray is a great central hub for local hikes and 4×4 trails. The town boasts a few cool restaurants and several hot springs lodges.\n\nSilverton\n\nSilverton feels like the SxS capital of the state. The land between Ouray and Silverton (and everywhere else around them) is covered in epic trails to ride. Silverton is another town straight out of a wild west movie. It’s doesn’t have any hotels but it does have an RV park and plenty of epic places to disperse camp. The hikes around Silverton are some of my favorite in the SJs.\n\nDurango\n\nDurango is South of Silverton on 550, just before you hit New Mexico. It’s an awesome and colorful little town with the Animas River running right through it. You can take the Silverton to Durango trail for a gorgeous ride through the San Juan Mountains. You’ll pass through Chicago Basin, a popular backpacking area that is only accessible via the train. Durango is a little bigger of a town and offers more modern amenities like hotels, restaurants and big chain grocery stores. The San Juan River runs through town where you can find tubers, kayakers, and white water rafters.\n\nPagosa Springs\n\nPagosa Springs is just a little east of Durango. It’s famous for it’s geothermal hot springs and accompanying hot springs resort. It’s an often popular town for mountain goers because of it’s direct access into the San Juan Mountains.\n\nLake City\n\nLake City is a small little town on the east of the San Juan Mountains. It’s on the other side of California Pass from Silverton & Ouray. Here you’ll find the trailhead for multiple 14ers including one of the easiest and most beautiful, Handies Peak.\n\nPlan an elopement experience that is authentic and exciting to you.\n\nJust getting started with planning your Colorado elopement?\n\nIf you’re looking for a photographer who knows these San Juan Mountain Elopement Locations well, loves all kinds of mountain days, and knows how to adventure like the best of them.\n\nEasily Accessible Elopement Locations in the San Juan Mountains | 2WD or AWD\n\nSan Sophia Overlook\n\nVenue at the top of San Sophia Gondola near the top of Lift 7 at Telluride Ski Resort\n\nEasily accessible walk to the location upon getting off the gondola\n\nAvailable to be reserved starting at $5000 for weddings and $2000/hour for elopements or photos on the overlook\n\nBooking info here\n\nNearest town: Telluride\n\nNote- photos & elopements can be happen elsewhere near the overlook on National Forest lands with no reservation.
