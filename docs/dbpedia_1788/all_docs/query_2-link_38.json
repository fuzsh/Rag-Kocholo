        "text": "Just miles from Portland, you can explore dozens of majestic waterfalls.\n\nWhere it rains, it pours — waterfalls, that is. A great side effect of the Portland area’s wet winter weather is a steady stream of cascades running throughout the region. (Many of these breathtaking sites are only a short shuttle bus or scenic bike ride away, to boot.) Get your fill of natural wonders at these waterfalls near Portland.\n\nColumbia River Gorge Waterfalls\n\nFed by glaciers and swollen by snowmelt and prodigious winter rains, the waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area — an 80-mile-long (129 km) swath carved out by ancient floodwaters — plunge from sheer cliffs, hidden slot canyons and rock grottos rimmed by massive trees and moss in a thousand shades of emerald and jade. In all, 90 major cascades flow here, alongside countless other smaller falls. Luckily for visitors, many of these misty gems are accessible year-round, either by short hikes or from roadside pullouts on the Historic Columbia River Highway, which parallels Interstate 84.\n\nMultnomah Falls\n\nOne of the most picturesque places in Oregon, Multnomah Falls is worth the crowds. With accessible and more rugged trails, come for a picnic, a hillside hike, or a snapshot on your way through the Gorge.\n\nMultnomah Falls\n\nLocated just 30 miles (48 km) east of downtown Portland, Oregon’s tallest waterfall attracts visitors of all ages and abilities for stunning year-round sights of cascading water with complimentary flora and fauna.\n\nLatourell Falls\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nTake Exit 22 from I-84 to the Historic Columbia River Highway, stopping first at the Vista House at Crown Point, then proceeding 2.4 miles (3.9 km) to Latourell Falls.\n\nUsually, the first falls that visitors encounter in the Columbia River Gorge, Latourell Falls is just east of the must-see views of Crown Point and along a 2.1-mile (3.4 km) loop where hikers can watch it drop straight down, 224 feet (68 m). It’s just a short walk to the lower falls, but a tougher uphill hike brings more daring explorers closer to the upper falls. Flowing strongest in winter and spring, Latourell gets a bit of sun in the summer, making for photos that are just as stunning.\n\nBridal Veil Falls\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nProceed another mile (1.6 km) east on the Historic Columbia River Highway. Also accessible via Exit 28 from I-84.\n\nLocated 27 miles (43 km) east of Portland, just off Interstate 84, the misty, white Bridal Veil Falls consists of a pair of quick cascades that are well worth the short but steep half-mile hike to the viewing platform. An upper trail also leads to cliffs that reveal great views of the Columbia River Gorge.\n\nWahkeena Falls and Fairy Falls\n\nWith a viewing platform off of the historic highway, you can admire Wahkeena Falls from afar or hike up switchbacks to see its three tiers up close and also catch great views of the Columbia River Gorge. A moderate hike, not for the faint of heart, takes you to the top of the falls. And if you dare, you can continue the climb to Fairy Falls, also known as “Ghost Falls,” when the sun hits the water just right.\n\nHorse Tail Falls\n\nAn easy, low-elevation loop trail takes you to Horse Tail Falls and Ponytail Falls. Just step away from the highway, and you are transported through the mineral layers of ancient lava flows with cascading water.\n\nGorgeous Gorge\n\nFrom hiking, to biking, to farm fresh foods the Columbia River Gorge has a lot to offer.\n\nCrown Point Vista House\n\nCalled the crown jewel of the Columbia River Gorge, the Crown Point Vista House is a century-old observatory, rest stop and museum. Enjoy a 360-degree of the gorge and a bird’s-eye view of the Columbia River.\n\nTwo Days in the Columbia River Gorge\n\nSavor the views and flavor of Hood River and the scenic gorge with this 48-hour itinerary.\n\nBonneville Dam\n\nAdmire wonders of engineering and migrating salmon at this historic landmark on the Columbia River.\n\nWaterfalls in Other Areas\n\nRamona Falls\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nKeep in mind, wilderness restrictions apply in this area, and to reach it, permits are required from mid-May to mid-October.\n\nTucked away in Mount Hood National Forest, Ramona Falls drapes like a 120-foot (37 m), a near-sheer curtain over the basalt rock face beneath, a gorgeous midpoint for a seven-mile (11 km) round-trip hike along the Pacific Crest Trail. The waterfall is located 57 miles (92 km) from Portland, attracting campers and day-trippers alike.\n\nOregon City\n\nThe final wagon stop on the Oregon trail, Oregon City welcomes visitors with food, drink, museums and outdoor activities.\n\nWillamette Falls\n\nA quick 20-mile (32 km) drive southeast of Portland to Oregon’s first capital city, Oregon City, will bring you to Willamette Falls. Find several viewpoints of the falls from an amble along Canemah Bluff Walk to a pull-off on Hwy-99 E to an aerial view with a picture-perfect frame of Mt. Hood off of I-205 N.\n\nSilver Falls\n\nA 60-mile (97 km) drive south of Portland in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, Silver Falls State Park is a popular spot for hikers because of its Trail of Ten Falls. An 8.7-mile (14 km) loop, the trail is only moderately difficult, and though it can get crowded (especially in the spring when flows are heaviest), it provides 12 months of waterfall watching. The park has plenty of campgrounds, picnic spots, and a historic lodge that’s open 365 days per year. There are also four waterfalls that you can walk behind, so be sure to dress for the chance of getting wet.\n\nSilver Falls State Park\n\nFamous for its abundance of picturesque waterfalls, Silver Falls State Park is the largest state park in Oregon at 9,200 acres (3723 hectares) and one of the most popular."
