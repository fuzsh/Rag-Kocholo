These birds migrate each fall to warmer climates in tropical regions of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. A sure sign of spring is the return of these colorful, transcontinental travelers, which awaken us with their songs.\n\nIn comparison, \"resident\" birds, such as the northern cardinal, hang around all year. Some migrants, like the American robin, travel short distances to spend the cold winter months in warmer areas of the United States.\n\nThe annual migration of North America's neotropical migratory birds is a biological wonder. It's hard to imagine that a blackpoll warbler that nests in the Northern States, makes an 86-hour, 2,300-mile nonstop flight across the Atlantic. These tiny birds must double their body weight in the late summer and early fall to build up enough body fat to make the long-distance flight.\n\nWith the advent of spring, most neotropical birds return to the place where they were born. The Southern Appalachians are a popular nesting ground for these birds, because the area provides some of the largest blocks of mature forest in the Eastern United States. As part of the Southern Appalachians, North Carolina's national forests offer the perfect habitat for a diversity of neotropical migratory birds.\n\nWith large blocks of forest and unique combinations of elevation, topography, climate, soil, and geology, North Carolina's national forests provide a huge sanctuary for many of these birds.\n\nThe national forests are managed not only for large tracts of mature hardwood forest, but also for grassy openings, brushy thickets, young forests, and high-elevation spruce-fir forests. These habitats provide homes and food for 160 bird species."
