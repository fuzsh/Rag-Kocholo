        "text": "Upper Latourell Falls was kind of like the sibling waterfall to the much larger and well-visited Latourell Falls further downstream on Latourell Creek.\n\nIt featured a pair of drops that twisted away from the alcove that it dropped into with a cumulative height of around 75-100ft.\n\nSo compared to its bigger downstream neighbor, the Upper Latourell Falls was modest in size even.\n\nThat said, I’ve seen plenty of situations where waterfalls of this size would get more dedicated tourism infrastructure devoted to it, and some even get their own reserve!\n\nIndeed, it just goes to show you how waterfall-rich the Columbia River Gorge is that a year-round waterfall of this size can feel neglected.\n\nNevertheless, I found that its relative obscurity (especially since it required a hike to reach) meant that this excursion offered a far more peaceful experience, which was especially important for social distancing.\n\nIn my mind, that tranquility and chance to be more intimate with the lush surroundings were the main appeal of pursuing the Upper Latourell Falls.\n\nHiking to the Upper Latourell Falls\n\nTechnically, visiting the Upper Latourell Falls can require as little as 2.6 miles round-trip in an out-and-back hike or as much as a 3.6 miles in a loop hike.\n\nSince I did this hike in a clockwise loop (which is the direction I recommend for reasons that will be apparent later), this is the manner in which I’ll describe the experience in this section.\n\nSo starting off from the Guy W Talbot State Park parking lot (the same one for Latourell Falls; see directions below), I immediately went up a sloping path instead of the trail going down to Latourell Falls’ base.\n\nAfter a few paces, I encountered an elevated lookout that allowed me to experience the “Lower” Latourell Falls in its entirety.\n\nOften times, since this waterfall would get a lot of visitors, I tend to use them as photo subjects to convey the scale of its sheer drop.\n\nNext, I continued uphill on the trail as it offered unusual views of Latourell Falls the further up the gorge that I went, especially where there was a rest bench.\n\nEventually after roughly a quarter-mile from the elevated lookout (or perhaps 0.3-mile from the parking lot), I reached another lookout with a partial view back towards the Columbia River Gorge.\n\nThen, the trail veered upstream alongside the east bank of Latourell Creek as the path flattened out and gently undulated for the next 0.6-mile or so before reaching the Upper Latourell Falls.\n\nAlong the way, there was a path leading to Latourell Creek that seemed to go nowhere (just upstream from the lookout at the end of the initial climb), but I suspect there was a bridge washout.\n\nMy old trail maps suggested that had the bridge been there, it could have been a shorter loop hike though cutting the longer loop here would mean not visiting the Upper Latourell Falls.\n\nAt roughly a quarter-mile from the aforementioned spur trail to the bridge washout, I noticed that there was an intermediate cascade on Latourell Creek, which was referred to as “Clara Falls” on GoogleMaps.\n\nAnyways, on the final approach to the Upper Latourell Falls, I was able to see most of both of its twisting drops.\n\nAs I got closer to the base of the waterfall, the upper tier became more hidden from view.\n\nAnd when I made it to the footbridge fronting the base of the lower tier of the falls, the upper drop was completely hidden from view.\n\nIt’s for this reason that I recommend doing this loop hike in a clockwise manner so that you don’t have to look over your shoulder to notice that upper tier (possibly making you miss it entirely if you don’t keep your eyes peeled for it).\n\nAt this point, I had the option of turning back and making this the 2.6-mile out-and-back hike, but I opted to continue on past the footbridge to finish the loop.\n\nBy the way, there was also some informal use-trails just beyond the west side of the bridge leading into the alcove behind the lower drop of Upper Latourell Falls for a somewhat unusual view of this falls.\n\nCompleting the Upper Latourell Falls Loop\n\nContinuing downstream along the west side of Latourell Creek, the trail made minor undulations though it generally seemed to be climbing on this side.\n\nIt got close to “Clara Falls” after around 0.4-mile from the footbridge, and it reached an unsigned fork right when the trail made another short climb roughly another quarter-mile further.\n\nAt this unsigned junction, the narrower lower path descended over some basalt columns towards a precarious bluff overlooking the brink of Latourell Falls, its associated trails and parking lot, and the Columbia River Gorge.\n\nSince the dropoffs here were sheer vertical plunges, I had to be very careful not to make a misstep.\n\nContinuing on with the loop trail, at another 0.1-mile, the trail reached its apex at a lookout right next to a sharp bend.\n\nAgain, this lookout with a bench yielded partially-overgrown views over the Columbia River Gorge, but it was high enough to reveal the wide Columbia River itself.\n\nThen, the trail made a fairly lengthy descent over a run of about 0.5-mile as it surprisingly took me back to the Historic Columbia River Highway.\n\nWhile I could choose to walk the road east directly back to the parking lot, the loop trail continued to descend on the other side of this road.\n\nFrom there, the trail then skirted by a tranquil-looking picnic area before swinging back towards Latourell Creek underneath the arched bridge holding up the Historic Columbia River Highway.\n\nFinally, the trail then followed the west side of Latourell Creek for the final quarter-mile or so before reaching the base of Latourell Falls from the other side of its fronting footbridge.\n\nNot surprisingly, at this point, I saw many more people (more than the one hiker that I saw the entire time I did the rest of the Upper Latourell Falls Loop) as all that was left was the short jaunt beyond the footbridge back to the parking lot.\n\nOverall, I spent a little under 2 hours doing this loop hike logging about 3.6 miles.\n\nAuthorities"
