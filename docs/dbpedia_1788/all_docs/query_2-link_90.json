These were the most unforgettable places I experienced along my last road trip in the Upper Peninsula, places that I have recommended over and over again. It’s incredible to live in such a diverse state that offers unlimited adventures. And Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore’s unique experiences make this region unlike any other part of Michigan.\n\nThe Off-Season Beauty\n\nWhen summer reaches its end, northern Michigan’s heat subsides and the winds off Lake Superior grow crisp. But that’s no reason to pass on a visit to Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, which only grows lovelier in autumn. The beauty of Great Lakes whitecaps and the multi-colored cliff faces are enhanced by the brilliant reds, oranges and yellows of the Upper Peninsula’s hardwood trees. Hiking along the shoreline promises spectacular vistas for visiting shutterbugs. And Pictured Rocks Cruises carry visitors past this brilliant coast well into mid-October, allowing opportunities to view the vibrant foliage from the water.\n\nThe beauty of this region is almost indescribable; you just have to go live the adventure for yourself. These were the most unforgettable places I experienced along my last road trip in the Upper Peninsula that I’d recommend over and over again. It’s incredible to live in such a diverse state that offers unlimited adventures. And Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is unlike any other part of Michigan because of the unique experiences that await around every curve."
