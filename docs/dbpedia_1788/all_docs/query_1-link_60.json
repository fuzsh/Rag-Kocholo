This definition is not meant to include irrigation ditches, canals, storm or surface water runoff structures, or other artificial watercourses unless they are used to convey streams naturally occurring prior to construction of such watercourses. For the Management Plan, streams are categorized into two classes: perennial streams and intermittent streams. Perennial stream means a stream that flows year round during years of normal precipitation. Intermittent stream means a stream that flows only part of the year, or seasonally, during years of normal precipitation.\n\n(153)\n\nStructure: That which is built or constructed, an edifice or building of any kind, or any piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner.

A thinning becomes a forest opening in coniferous forests when the average canopy closure of the overstory layer is zero or less than 40 percent and the understory layer is less than 60 percent average canopy closure of trees averaging less than 5 inches diameter at breast height. A thinning becomes a forest opening in oak woodlands when the total average canopy closure is less than 25 percent.\n\n(158)\n\nTotal canopy closure (SMA): For forest practices, the percentage measuring the degree to which all layers of the tree canopy combine together to block sunlight or obscure the sky as measured from below.\n\n(159)\n\nTravelers accommodations: Any establishment having rooms rented or kept for rent on a daily or weekly basis to travelers or transients for a charge or fee paid or to be paid for rental use or use of facilities.\n\n(160)\n\nTreatment (SMA): For forest practices, a site-specific operation that carries out the forest management objectives for an area.\n\n(161)\n\nTreaty rights or other rights: Rights reserved by the Indian tribes through the Treaties of 1855.

As opposed to structures that are fully screened, structures that are visually subordinate may be partially visible. They are not visually dominant in relation to their surroundings. Visually subordinate forest practices in the SMA shall repeat form, line, color, or texture common to the natural landscape, while changes in their qualities of size, amount, intensity, direction, pattern, etc., shall not dominate the natural landscape setting.\n\n(173)\n\nWater dependent: Uses that absolutely require, and cannot exist without, access or proximity to, or siting within, a water body to fulfill their basic purpose. Water dependent uses include, but are not limited to, docks, wharfs, piers, dolphins, certain fish and wildlife structures, boat launch facilities, and marinas. Dwellings, parking lots, spoil and dump sites, roads, restaurants, trails and paths, trailer parks, resorts, and motels are not water dependent.\n\n(174)\n\nWater related: Uses not directly dependent upon access to a water body, but whose presence facilitates public access to and enjoyment of a water body. In the GMA, water related uses shall be limited to boardwalks, trails and paths, observation decks, and interpretative aids, such as kiosks and signs.\n\n(175)\n\nWetlands: Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. This does not include riparian areas, rivers, streams, and lakes.\n\n(176)\n\nWetlands functions: The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwaters and stormwaters; groundwater recharge and discharge; protection of water quality and reduction of sediment and erosion; production of waterfowl, game and nongame birds, mammals, and other living resources; protection of habitat for endangered, threatened, and sensitive species; food chain support for a broad range of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archaeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities.\n\n(177)\n\nWinery: An agricultural facility used for processing grapes into wine, including laboratories, processing areas, offices, and storage areas.
