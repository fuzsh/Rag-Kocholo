Usually a natural oasis requiring some effort to reach, these bodies of water are known to wash away all worries on a hot day.\n\nNorth Carolina has dozens of these natural pools. The better known typically lie at the base of a cascade in the mountains. But our coast and central region also have their share of hidden pools where the escape is just as refreshing."
