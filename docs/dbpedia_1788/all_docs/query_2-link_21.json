        "text": "For nearly two years, the BVMR team has carried out a broad consultation process with Stó:lō Communities and Leadership, aimed at having collaborative, respectful and meaningful discussions. As of July 2022, we are actively involved in the very early stages of Community consultation and engagement with 20 Stó:lō Communities. Those consultations are being conducted in full accordance with all Stó:lō community consultation protocols. Our goal is to be the first four season mountain resort in Canada to be jointly planned, developed, owned, and operated in a full partnership with local participating First Nations Communities. Should it proceed, Bridal Veil Mountain Resort would provide Stó:lō with exclusive rights to manage, control, and regulate an 11,500-acre resort site that would be jointly designed, developed, and owned by Stó:lō in partnership with BVMR Ltd., fully in accordance with Stó:lō environmental, traditional and cultural values and land stewardship principles.\n\nFor more information about our core principles and our ongoing Indigenous consultation, please visit www.bridalveilmountainresort.ca\n\nBVMR recognizes the critical importance of accommodating diverse user groups within the context of proper environmental oversight and, most importantly, full protection of the Stó:lō lands in accordance with Stó:lō land stewardship values. Regarding public access, should the project be invited to proceed to the next stage of the application process (Formal Proposal), we would seek to draft a preliminary Backcountry Access Management Plan developed collaboratively with public user groups, including the offroad community. BVMR and Stó:lō Communities will jointly develop the BVMR project to the highest environmental and sustainability standards, applying Stó:lō cultural, traditional, and land stewardship values. Should the proposed Bridal Veil Mountain Resort proceed to the next stage in the application process, any decisions, including those related to public access, will be jointly determined in collaboration with our Stó:lō Community partners.\n\nRegarding traffic, exit points off the highway, and existing or new access roads to the valley village, these issues would be studied as part of detailed traffic impact studies that would be completed as part of the Formal Proposal and Master Plan stages of the proposed project’s application process, should the project be invited to proceed. Rest assured the project is fully committed to exploring all options to minimize traffic impacts. BVMR will work closely with the City of Chilliwack, the Fraser Valley Regional District, the Provincial Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, and all Stó:lō Communities, to ensure we meet or exceed all applicable traffic, cycling, and pedestrian safety standards.\n\nLike the Cascade Skyline Gondola project, BVMR would require extensive planning and detailed studies, as well as approvals from the Province, the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD) and the City of Chilliwack before it can move forward. B.C.’s All-Seasons Resort application process is a complex and comprehensive multi-stage process that typically takes years to complete. At this time, the Bridal Veil Mountain Resort Expression of Interest is being evaluated by BC’s Mountain Resorts Branch. As part of that evaluation process, the Branch has collected feedback from First Nations, provincial agencies and stakeholders. If approved, the next step in the application process would be the submission of a much more detailed Formal Proposal. For more information, visit the Province of B.C.’s All-Seasons Resort application process website.\n\nA mountain resort operator will typically be sourced later in the project proposal process. Currently, our team includes Whistler-based Brent Harley and Associates (BHA), one of the world’s most experienced and respected mountain resort planning and design firms. For more about BHA’s experience on mountain resort projects around the world, please visit their website at www.brentharley.com.\n\nOur team also includes RRC Associates, a Boulder, Colorado-based research and analysis firm with nearly 40 years’ experience serving high-profile clients in the travel, tourism and ski industry sectors. For more information, visit their website at www.rrcassociates.com.\n\nBVMR has initiated a broad consultation process with the local Stó:lō Communities and Leadership, aimed at having collaborative, respectful and meaningful discussions. Our engagement work with the Stó:lō began in early January 2021, when Bridal Veil Mountain Resort Ltd. began its formal consultation process with the 15 Stó:lō Member Communities of the S’ólh Téméxw Stewardship Alliance (STSA), as managed by the People of the River Referral Office (PRRO) in Stó:lō. All the Project documents, including the EOI that was filed with the Province, were made available to the 15 Communities. Additionally, we filed a comprehensive Formal Response to initial issues raised by the PRRO on the BVMR Project in early March, which was circulated to the 15 Communities. Our active and ongoing consultation with these Stó:lō Communities includes filing updated Project documents and new information regularly with the PRRO, which makes that material available to the 15 Communities through its online portal.\n\nWe have also reached out to the nine other Stó:lō Communities that are not members of the STSA, to initiate respectful consultation and engagement with them, in accordance with each Community’s local consultation protocols. We are now actively engaging five of those Stó:lō communities, fully respecting their own consultation processes and procedures.\n\nAs of July 2022, we are actively involved in various stages of Community consultation and engagement with 20 of the 24 Stó:lō Communities. One of the four remaining Stó:lō Communities has formally withdrawn from the Provincial consultation and engagement process.\n\nIn addition to the engagement efforts described above, in early January 2021, we sent a personal letter to all the Stó:lō leaders, including Chiefs and Councilors, in all 24 Stó:lō Communities. The letter introduced the Project, acknowledged it was on the Traditional lands of the Stó:lō people, and asked for their advice and guidance on how we could follow their protocols and begin our formal engagement processes with all of the Communities.\n\nIn April 2021, we again connected with all 24 Stó:lō Communities and each Community’s Leadership personally, providing our Project announcement press release and website address, and again asking how we can continue to properly engage with their Community, in accordance with each Community’s protocols and procedures. In addition, we have reached out to the broader Indigenous communities and business organizations in S’ólh Téméxw.\n\nTo date, we have provided detailed presentations about BVMR to 12 Stó:lō Communities. The presentations include information about the project provided by BVMR’s owners, Brent Harley and Associates (the mountain resort designer) and our advisor on Indigenous matters. Presentations to Stó:lō Communities and Leadership are ongoing.\n\nGenerally, we have had a positive response to our engagement with Stó:lō Leadership and we continue to provide Stó:lō Communities and Leadership with Project updates through direct and ongoing correspondence. Although the BVMR Team has been very active and engaged throughout S’ólh Téméxw, it is important to note that the Project is still in the very early stages of its consultation and respectful relationship-building with the Stó:lō Communities.\n\nWe strongly believe that any project undertaken on Stó:lō lands must involve the participating Stó:lō Communities in whatever capacity they deem appropriate. Recognizing that the proposed site is in S’ólh Téméxw, the traditional and unceded lands of the Stó:lō people since time immemorial, our core values are to first work closely with local Stó:lō Communities and Leadership to explore: opportunities for meaningful involvement; joint equity ownership and management; jointly designing the Project with the Stó:lō to the highest environmental standards and Stó:lō traditional, cultural and land stewardship values; as well as laying the foundations for a mutually respectful partnership, to jointly advance BVMR with the participating Stó:lō. To that end, we have initiated a broad Stó:lō consultation process aimed at having collaborative and meaningful discussions with Stó:lō Communities, to achieve these core values.\n\nAdditionally, we see Stó:lō ownership and meaningful participation as key foundations for this Project, and believe their business expertise and Indigenous world perspectives would contribute greatly to the success of the Project. From an environmental perspective, we recognize that the Stó:lō have used and protected these lands for thousands of years and no one understands them better. If this Project proceeds, every decision we make together would honour Stó:lō cultural and traditional values, and the Stó:lō commitment to environmental responsibility and land stewardship protection.\n\nNotably, Bridal Veil Mountain resort has the opportunity to be the first four season mountain resort in Canada to be jointly developed, owned and operated in a full partnership with local participating First Nations Communities.\n\nThe BVMR team is engaging in proper and respectful consultation with all 24 Stó:lō communities within S’ólh Téméxw, the traditional territory of the Stó:lō people.\n\nWhile this engagement is mandated by the Province of BC’s All Seasons Resort Policies and Guidelines, our actions are guided by the core Indigenous values upon which BVMR was founded. First and foremost is the belief that no major resource projects in Canada should proceed, unless the local First Nations upon whose traditional territories the proposed project is located, are invited to be meaningfully engaged and become major owners in the project. This focus on joint management and equity ownership in the BVMR Project are the foundations of our Stó:lō consultations. Those consultations are being conducted in full accordance with all Stó:lō community consultation protocols.\n\nAdditionally, the BVMR Project will be jointly planned and developed to the highest environmental standards and sustainability principles with the participating Stó:lō communities, applying Stó:lō cultural, traditional and land stewardship values.\n\nThe BVMR team is engaging in proper and respectful consultation with all 24 Stó:lō communities within S’ólh Téméxw, the traditional territory of the Stó:lō people.\n\nWhile this engagement is mandated by the Province of BC’s All Seasons Resort Policies and Guidelines, our actions are guided by the core Indigenous values upon which BVMR was founded.

This would include an Environmental Inventory of the entire study area, completed by a qualified environmental professional (QEP) in advance of the Formal Proposal stage, and an Environmental Audit and Mitigation Plan completed by a QEP as part of the Master Plan stage. Further, based on the projected size of BVMR, the project would trigger an Environmental Assessment under the BC Environmental Assessment Act. The results of these environmental studies and the prescribed mitigation actions would shape the refinement of the resort concept during the Master Plan stage. Finally, if the BVMR project is ultimately approved, prior to construction, we would have detailed surveys of proposed development sites (e.g. buildings, ski lifts) completed by qualified environmental professional.\n\nIt should be noted that, among our highest priorities are the meaningful participation by the Stó:lō Communities and meeting or exceeding the highest environmental standards. To that end, in addition to carrying out the Provincial processes dictated by the All Season Resort Policy, we are fully committed to continued consultation with the Stó:lō Communities and incorporating their traditional land stewardship principles as part of the foundation for the resort planning and design process.\n\nRegarding public access to the existing Controlled Recreational Area, one of the options we would seek to explore is the creation of a Backcountry Access Management Plan developed collaboratively with public user groups. Of course, it should be noted that our highest priorities are the meaningful participation by the Stó:lō Communities, First Nations land stewardship values; and exploring this resort concept and joint equity ownership and management with the Stó:lō Communities. Therefore, should the proposed Bridal Veil Mountain Resort proceed to the next stage in the application process, any decisions will be jointly determined in collaboration with our Stó:lō Community Partners.\n\nThe preliminary concept includes 18 chairlifts (plus the 2 gondolas), but this number isn’t fixed and will likely move around somewhat as we move through the planning process. The ratio of Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced ski trails is not known as we have not progressed to that level of detail. We can say that, based on the ski slope analysis, the EOI study area contains a mix of ski terrain that closely aligns with the skier marketplace (approximately 20% beginner/green, 60% intermediate/blue, and 20% advanced/black). One of our priorities if/when we get to more detailed planning will be to ensure that the ski trails on offer line up with this breakdown. We will have advanced/expert terrain for the experienced hard chargers, and beginner, ‘never-ever’ terrain for the people putting on skis for the first time.\n\nFor more information on terrain analysis, please check-out the Expression of Interest PDF found within the Resources section of our website.\n\nThe resort development application process is a three-phase process that includes (1) the description of the project vision known as the Expression of Interest, (2) the generation of a Formal Proposal, and (3) the creation of a Master Plan. Each phase provides provincial ministries and agencies, the federal government, First Nations, local governments and local stakeholders with opportunities to provide input on application requirements and decisions.\n\nExpression of Interest\n\nThe general location, project vision, projected market, and key aspects of the proposed resort at a high level.\n\nFormal Proposal\n\nGreater detail on the proposed resort concept, its potential environmental, cultural, social, and economic impacts and benefits, and overall feasibility of the project.\n\nMaster Plan\n\nA complete and fully detailed resort concept, supported by a detailed environmental audit and mitigation plan, archaeological assessments, market and economic analysis, and infrastructure, servicing, and management plans.\n\nFor more information about the application process, All Season Resorts Guidelines, and requirements for Expressions of Interest, Formal Proposals, Master Plans, please visit the Mountain Resorts Branch website.\n\nAmong our project’s highest priorities are the meaningful participation by the Stó:lō Communities, the integration of First Nations land stewardship values, and exploring this resort concept and joint equity ownership and management with the Stó:lō Communities. As part of the Mountain Resort Branch’s EOI review process, MRB has distributed a referral package to local First Nations and local government to collect their feedback about the two projects proposed for this area. The meaningful participation of local First Nations will be a critical component of each phase of the Province’s project review process."
