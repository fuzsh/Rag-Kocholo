        "text": "Visit DuPont State Forest\n\nDuPont State Forest, made famous as the setting for the movies The Hunger Games and The Last of the Mohicans, is home to amazing waterfalls, mountain lakes and hiking trails. DuPont State Forest is located in Western North Carolina near the South Carolina state line, and is less than an hour drive (40 miles) south of Asheville.\n\nChoose from 86 miles of trails in the 10,000-acre forest. While most people visit DuPont to hike, it's also one the Asheville area's best places for mountain biking.\n\nTop Things to Do at DuPont State Forest Near Asheville, N.C.\n\n1. Hike to waterfalls: The most popular waterfall hike in DuPont State Forest takes you to three of the Asheville area's most beautiful falls on an easy-to-moderate, 2.2-mile round trip hike. Check out our guide to the Hooker Falls, Triple Falls, High Falls waterfall hike for more information and directions. Or, download a waterfall trail map and create your own hiking adventure. You can also purchase a digital GPS trail map from Friends of DuPont Forest, a nonprofit organization that works to protect the Forest’s natural resources. All proceeds go back into projects supporting the Forest.\n\nHere is an at-a-glance look at the four top waterfall trails and hikes in DuPont:\n\nHooker Falls — Just a one-mile round trip hike from the parking area of the same name, Hooker Falls is easy to explore. While the falls is only 12 feet high, it's a wide waterfall, creating a beautiful pool that is a popular swimming hole on warm days.\n\nTriple Falls — In the other direction from the parking area from Hooker Falls, Triple Falls is also just a one-mile round trip hike. This unique waterfall features three cascades that drop a total of 120 feet! A short detour off the trail down a series of stairs takes you to a large, flat rock area just above the third cascade. It's a great spot for a picnic.\n\nHigh Falls — A half mile from Triple Falls, you'll find High Falls. High Falls is the tallest waterfall in DuPont State Forest as it drops 150 feet. There is an overlook on the trail that provides a great view of the falls, especially when the leaves are off the trees in late fall and winter. Or, add another half mile to your adventure on a spur trail to reach the base of the falls. The trail to High Falls can be accessed by either the Hooker Falls or High Falls parking areas.\n\nBridal Veil Falls — This 120-foot waterfall is a 4-mile round trip hike from the High Falls Parking Area. Bridal Veil Falls doesn't have a dramatic drop like the others, instead it rushes over a sloped rock. See our guide to hiking to Bridal Veil Falls.\n\n2. Go mountain biking: DuPont State Forest is a top mountain biking destination in the region. Ride on forest roads or granite rock faces along the more than 80 miles of trails that are open to mountain bikers. Among the most popular biking trails is Cedar Rock Mountain, best accessed by the Corn Mills Shoals Access Area.\n\n3. See the covered bridge: The Covered Bridge above High Falls was built by a developer who had planned to build homes in this part of the forest before the state of North Carolina purchased the land for preservation. Now, you can enjoy this scenic location that makes a great spot for photos.\n\n4. Explore mountain lakes: While not as heavily visited as the waterfalls, the lakes in DuPont State Forest are no less beautiful. Lakes include Fawn Lake and Lake Julia, both of which you can see on the same 4-mile round trip hike.\n\n5. Spot wildflowers and wildlife: The State Forest features all kinds of wildlife including deer, turkey, bear and snakes. In the spring, wildflowers such as yellow lady's slippers, flame azalea, Turk's Cap lilies and yellow fringe orchids burst into bloom\n\n6.
