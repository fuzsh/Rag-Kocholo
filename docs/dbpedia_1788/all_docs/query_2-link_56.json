        "text": "ITATIAIA NATIONAL PARK\n\nThe Itatiaia National Park is a conservation area that protects important remnants of the Atlantic Forest Biome. Located in the Itatiaia Massif in the Mantiqueira Mountains, between the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, it includes part of the cities Itatiaia and Resende in Rio de Janeiro, and Bocaina de Minas and Itamonte in Minas Gerais.\n\nThe Itatiaia Park is the oldest national park in Brazil, created on June 14, 1937 by the then President Getulio Vargas.\n\nFor visitation purposes, the Itatiaia National Park is divided into: The Itatiaia Plateau, The Lower Regions, and the Visconde de Maua Region.\n\nIn the Plateau:In this region, the predominant vegetation is characterized by altitude grasslands and the main natural attractions are: the Agulhas Negras peak, the Shelves Massif, Aiuruoca Valley, the Altar Stone, the Couto Stone, Hermes' Wing, the Bell Stone and the Seated Stone; besides being the starting point for the Ruy Braga, Sierra Negra and Fallen Ranch trekking paths.\n\nIn the Lower Regions:The predominant vegetation is dense ombrophilous forest (Atlantic Forest) and the natural attractions are the trails through the forest that lead to many waterfalls. Some of which, like the Itaporani and Maromba, stand apart for their large volume of water as well as beautiful natural pool formations. The enchanting Bridal Veil waterfall (on the Maromba river) is 40 m high, forming a cold and serene veil of mist at its base. The Three Peaks trail crosses through the forest and leads to a 1,622 m overlook of the Paraiba River Valley. Other beautiful attractions include the Foundation Stone and the Last Goodbye overlook. The starting point for the waterfall trails is the Visitor´s Center, where several resources can be found, including a scale model of the park, maps, and films about the park.\n\nThe Visconde de Maua Region:this is one of the main tourist poles of Rio Janeiro, with many hotels and restaurants. The main attractions of the Itatiaia National Park in the Visconde de Maua region are the Escorrega and Santa Clara waterfalls. This area will soon have an Information and Control Checkpoint as well as a Visitor´s Center\n\nClick on the image below to download the folder of the Park.\n\nWhen To Go\n\nThe Park can be visited every day of the year, but the best time to visit the plateau is in the winter, when there is less rain, the paths are safer to walk and the view of the valley is privileged by the clear skies. While the lower regions can be enjoyed all year round, the greater incidence of rain in summer not only swells the waterfalls adding to their natural beauty, it also adds to their natural danger, keeping in mind the risk of flash floods and sudden surges of water from storms upriver.\n\nVisitation Schedules\n\nThe admission times are different for the Plateau and the lower regions of the park:\n\nOn the plateau- admission is from 07h00 to 14h30. Visitors are permitted to stay no later than 18h00.\n\nIn the lower regions- the schedule for admission starts at 08h00, and visitors can stay until 17h00.\n\nHow To Arrive\n\nThe Itatiaia National Park is located between the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, near the state of São Paulo, in the Mantiqueira Mountains.\n\nIn the South Fluminense region, also known as the Agulhas Negras region, the National Park includes the cities of Itatiaia and Resende. In southern Minas Gerais the park includes the cities of Itamonte and Bocaina de Minas.\n\nGeographically, it is located between parallels 22 º 19 'and 22 º 45' south latitude and median 44 º 15 'and 44 º 50' longitude.\n\nYou can also find the map for how to access the Park onGoogle.\n\nclick to open\n\nAdministrative seat of the Park (lower regions)\n\nStarting from Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, the visitor should follow the Presidente Dutra Highway (BR 116) to the town of Itatiaia, at km 318. The trip takes about 2h 30min from Rio de Janeiro and 3 hours from Sao Paulo.\n\nPlateau Region\n\nDeparting from Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, the visitor should follow the Presidente Dutra Highway (BR 116) to Engenheiro Passos at Km 330. From this point follow the BR 354 highway in the direction of Caxambú for 26.5 km, to a place known as Garganta do Registro at an altitude of 1.669 meters. From there, 14 km of dirt road leads to the Marcão station, and another 3 km will take you to the Rebouças Shelter.\n\nBelow is a table with the distances to the two entrances to the park, gate 1 and the Marcão gate. The first part of the list refers to the distance from the three major metropolitan centers of the region, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. The second part lists the cities near the park where visitors can find hotels and hostels, as well as reference points for access to the Itatiaia Park.\n\nSource: Google Maps (http://maps.google.com/maps?ct=reset)\n\nThe bus terminals nearest the park are in Resende and Itatiaia at 24 km and 5km, respectively, from the entrance to the Lower Region of the park. In the center of Itatiaia city, there is a circular bus that goes to the park.\n\nThere is no regular bus line to access the Plateau region of the park. From the Resende Bus Station visitors can take a bus to Caxambu / MG and get off early at the Garganta do Registro (the border between the states of Rio and Minas). From this point to the Marcão gate is 14 km of dirt road (uphill).\n\nBus: Bus Routes and Schedules\n\nBUS ROUTE ITATIAIA X NACIONAL PARK - Viação Penedo (24) 3381-8861\n\nDepartures from downtown to Visitors Center - 07:00a.m / 12:00p.m / 3:00p.m / 6:00p.m\n\nDepartures from downtown to National Park entrance - 10:20a.m\n\nDepartures from National Park entrance to downtown - 11:00a.m\n\nDepartures from National Park Visitors Center to downtown - 08:00a.m / 1:00p.m / 5:00p.m / 7:00p.m\n\nOrientations\n\nBefore you program your trip to the national park, check if the route (trail or crossing) you wish to do is currently accessible.\n\nAttention:In the rainy season observe the orientations of park management about the possibility of flash floods, which can make it impossible to access the waterfalls.\n\nBy accessing any of the entrances of the park, remember\n\nThe entry of pets is prohibited;\n\nUse only authorized trails (Check at the gate if the trail you wish to do is currently accessible);\n\nThere are no restaurants in the park;\n\nConsumption of alcoholic beverages is not allowed;\n\nDo not smoke on the trails or in the forest because of the risk of fire;\n\nThere are no authorized camping areas in the lower regions of the park;\n\nStarting fires in natural areas is strictly prohibited;\n\nThe removal of species of flora is not permitted;\n\nFeeding animals (even fruits) is strictly prohibited;\n\nThe visitor is responsible for all trash produced, take everything with you.\n\nNote:For those visiting the Plateau Region of the park for the first time, the park has, as an option, a guide program for visitors.

They are however autonomous professionals, and not employees of the park, so the cost of contracting a guide must be agreed upon directly with them.\n\nFor those visiting the Plateau, even with a light backpack, the trails take hours. Establish a time limit to be back before 16h30. Come back before the time limit, even if you haven’t made it to the end of the trail. Always carry a flashlight with spare batteries in your pack.\n\nWith heavy packs, the trails can take much longer to complete. Pay attention to slower or tired walkers and never leave them alone.\n\nPack wisely; try to avoid unnecessary weight, and when possible, try to pack everything into the backpack in plastic bags, to avoid damage from unexpected rains during the walk.\n\nSome trails are wide and well defined, While others can be faint and require a lot of attention on the part of the group. Finding the path at night or in the fog can be difficult.\n\nTemperatures in the Plateau Region of the park frequently approach 0ºC. Always come equipped with a good jacket, hat, and rain cape, even when expecting sunny weather.\n\nUse the existing camp sites. Don’t cut new clearings, don’t make camp fires.\n\nThere are many treacherous and demanding trails in the park. With a heavy pack, it can take a full day to cross some of the trails. There are steep uphill and downhill stretches over rocks, as well as places where ropes and equipment are necessary. The trail can be hard to recognize over the rocky slopes, and having an experienced guide, or at the very least someone who knows the path very well, is highly recommended.\n\nIt is important to redouble your attention on rainy days, the steep slopes can become dangerous, and walking on wet terrain can make the trek much more demanding. For these reasons, when rain is forecast, consult the park’s employees at the park’s entrance.\n\nUnder no circumstance whatsoever should you defecate or urinate near the water harvesting locations. Bury human waste along with toilet paper. It is recommended to bring along a small gardener’s shovel. Never bury baby wipes, they contain synthetic elements whose decomposition takes many years.\n\nIf you need to wash dishes, first scrape any food residue that might be left and bag it along with your trash. Harvest water, and use it to wash your dishes away from the flowing water. Keep the flowing water clean, without residues.\n\nDon’t cut or make shortcuts, not only do they confuse others following the trail, they also provoke erosion.\n\nMany people go to the mountains looking for peace and quiet, respect this. Don’t be noisy, especially at night in the camping grounds.\n\nTake all trash back with you, including candy wrappers and cigarette butts. If possible, help remove any trash you happen to find on the trail.\n\nIf you happen to find someone disrespecting the mountain or other visitors, approach them calmly and talk to them, in this way trying to gain an ally and not make an enemy.\n\nIf you happen to run into a wild animal, respect it. Don’t offer wild animals food, and don’t eat in front of them. Avoid contact so that diseases don’t pass from humans to wildlife or from the wildlife to humans."
