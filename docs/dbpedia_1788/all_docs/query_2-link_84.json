        "text": "Arriving in Fjord Norway by train is a very scenic experience and is often an easy way to access the fjords (except in Northern Norway).\n\nThe traditional coastal express Hurtigruten calls at ports all along the coast of Fjord Norway.\n\nGuided tours are offered in many places, and are an effective and rewarding way to explore the landscape. A winter journey from Bergen to Flåm is strongly recommended.\n\nElectric ferries and other ferry services operate all year round.\n\nTunnels and bridges tie Fjord Norway together and make travelling by road easy.\n\nMany cities have domestic and international flights connections nearby.\n\nFjord Tours also have tailor-made Norway in a nutshell round trips to many of the fjords.\n\n1. UNESCO has included the fjords of Fjord Norway, exemplified by the Geirangerfjord and the Nærøyfjord, on its prestigious World Heritage List.\n\n2. The fjords are often described as “nature’s own work of art”, formed when the glaciers retreated and seawater flooded the U-shaped valleys.\n\n3. Gudvangen and Geiranger, the two innermost villages of the Nærøyfjord and the Geirangerfjord, are amongst the most popular cruise ship ports in Scandinavia.\n\n4. Thanks to the warm Gulf Stream and air currents caused by the coriolis effect, the Norwegian fjords enjoy a relatively mild climate and remain virtually ice-free. Seals, porpoises and a variety of fish species swim in the fjords, while eagles and other birds soar in the skies above.\n\n5. The fjords are often very deep. The Sognefjord is the deepest as it drops 1,308 metres below sea level. Since the fjords are so deep, they permit navigation by large ships, allowing you to experience their beauty at close range."
