        "text": "Updated: Aug 23, 2024\n\nShould you get a permit?\n\nA permit is required and is available two weeks ahead of your date on rec.gov. This permit is only good for Multnomah Falls. To see all six major waterfalls and state parks we recommend renting an ebike and cruising through the forest to each falls or hopping on the waterfall shuttle which takes you to each park in the early afternoon and our favorite time to visit, sunset.\n\nHow to visit without a permit?\n\nE-bike to Multnomah Falls:\n\nAn E-Bike is a fun and easy way to chase waterfalls. Get a hassle free front row spot at Multnomah Falls and the 5 other major waterfalls allowing you plenty of time to explore each of the parks, take a dip and enjoy the views. E-bikes are just 3 miles from Multnomah Falls in Bridal Veil and start at $60. Make a reservation on their website.\n\nBook a guided waterfall tour:\n\nThe Multnomah Falls Tour from Waterfall Shuttle visits the 6 major falls on a 3.5 hour hiking tour with pickup in Portland. Six short hikes (1/4 mile) take you to the waterfalls and the Crown Point Vista House. We highly recommend their Sunset Tour if it’s not sold out.\n\nWays to visit totally FREE:\n\nThere’s no permit requirement before 9am or after 6pm 365 days/year. Just show up at 8:59 am or 6:01 pm and enjoy lower crowds and free entry! They also give away free permits as available in Cascade Locks at the Museum and in Troutdale at the Visitor Center downtown.\n\nUse your own bike and do the ebike tour route. Ample free parking at Guy W Talbot park in Latourell.\n\nPark in the day use area below Wahkeena Falls and hike 1/42mile to Multnomah Falls from there. (you may have to wait for parking)\n\nThings to know:\n\nFrom 8/23 to 9/6 at least there’s a closure of the West Viaduct accessing Multnomah Falls. It is still accessible via these tours but you can’t drive the historic highway on your own anymore and it’s harder to access Horsetail Falls.\n\nWhile you’re here you have to check out Latourell, Bridal Veil, Horsetail and Wahkeena Falls. They’re only a couple miles away and many prefer these falls as they’re also huge but have way less people and feel more natural.\n\nThis Historic Highway is a slow going tourist route not an actual highway. There’s next to no parking either so use I84 if you’re just visiting Multnomah Falls\n\nThe dream! To have a full day in waterfall alley. Here’s how I’d do it from Portland, it works in reverse just as well if you’re coming from Hood River.\n\nStart from exit 18 off 1-84 and drive along the Sandy River to Corbett Country Market for gas and fresh hot local snacks.\n\nContinue to some farm stands that you’ll spot along the road. After the stands enjoy what you got at the women’s forum and crown point vista house.\n\nPack a lunch from the market, the farm stands, or. if coming from Hood river in Cascade Locks.\n\nCarry on down to Latourell Falls where you’ll do a 2.5 mile easy hike to spot native species, old growth cedar and fir, and two waterfalls.\n\nGet on your bikes and ride! Meet your ebike rental and ride to the relaxing and peaceful scenic highway to the rest of the waterfalls. If you didn’t bring lunch get some at the lodge. Pizza and hot dogs are available easily there too.\n\nReturn to your car and go get dinner!\n\nMcMenamins Edgefield if going to Portland. and Gorges Beer Co if going to Hood River from Portland"
