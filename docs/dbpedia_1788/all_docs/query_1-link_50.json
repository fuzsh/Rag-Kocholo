        "text": "I’ll never get over living in the PNW, truly. Oregon and Washington have so many insanely incredible locations for any couple looking to elope. Whether you want to elope in the mountains, on the beach, in the forest, at a waterfall, you name it! Because there are sooo many amazing options, it can be hard to narrow it down when choosing your elopement locations! So here are 13 of the best places to elope in Oregon – no matter what type of scenery you’re looking for. Happy exploring!!\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nBeach Elopement Locations\n\nCannon Beach\n\nHug Point\n\nNatural Bridges\n\nWaterfall Elopement Locations\n\nToketee Falls\n\nAbiqua Falls\n\nWahclella Falls\n\nLatourell Falls\n\nBridal Veil Falls\n\nSilver Falls\n\nMountain Elopement Locations\n\nSaddle Mountain\n\nMt. Hood\n\nOther Elopement Locations\n\nColumbia River Gorge\n\nCrater Lake National Park\n\nOregon Beach Elopement Locations\n\nCannon Beach\n\nHow far is Cannon Beach from Portland?\n\nCannon Beach is 80 miles west of Portland, usually around a 1.5-hour drive.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nCannon Beach is one of the most popular spots to visit along the Oregon Coast. It’s famous for its iconic Haystack Rock (that you’ve probs seen on a postcard from Oregon at some point) and adorable coastal town. The town is super fun to walk around & explore! You can walk right down to the beach, or hike up into Ecola State Park if you wanna be in the trees + get some amazing views of the coastline!\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Cannon Beach\n\nTo legally get married on the beach, you might need to get a Special Use Permit. This depends on your party size! Reach out to the Ocean Shores office via email here & ask if you’ll need a permit based on your elopement date, location, & size!\n\nCannon Beach gets SUPER crowded during the warmest summer months (typically July & August). Keep that in mind if you want to hold your elopement right at Haystack Rock or another popular tourist spot. There’s a good chance there will be a ton of tourists walking along the beach and in the background of your ceremony. Definitely consider not having your elopement during the busy tourist season, or at least have it at sunrise and/or on a weekday to avoid crowds as much as possible!\n\nThe town of Cannon Beach is adorable and really fun to explore, but if you want some more shops & options of places to stay, drive to Seaside nearby!\n\nHug Point\n\nHow far is Hug Point from Portland?\n\nHug Point is right near Cannon Beach (just a 7 minute drive south), about 83 miles from Portland.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nHug Point State Recreation Site is right down the coast from Cannon Beach. It’s super easy to pop over to both beach spots on your elopement day. I looove Hug Point because of its diverse scenery. It has a really pretty waterfall that flows down to the beach, rocky areas to climb, super cool caves, forests & greenery, tide pools, and gorgeous scenic viewpoints. Truly the best of everything Oregon has to offer all in one spot!!\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Hug Point\n\nHug Point is great because it’s very easily accessible; it’s easy to walk around the beach and into the forest without having to hike or anything. Just make sure you and your guests are prepared & able to walk down the stairs & large rocky area to get to the sand!\n\nWatch how high the tide is before you go, because the area of the beach with the waterfall & caves can be hard to get to if the tide is too high & blocks off the walking area. You can access Hug Point tide information here!\n\nNatural Bridges\n\nHow far are the Natural Bridges from Portland?\n\nThe Natural Bridges are on the very southern border of Oregon in Brookings, 318 miles from Portland & just under a 6-hour drive. It’s definitely the furthest location from major cities but so worth the drive!\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nThe Natural Bridges Viewpoint is one of the most stunningggg, unique spots on the entire Oregon Coast, in my opinion, and sits along the Samuel H. Boardman State Scenic Corridor. It’s an easy 0.7-mile round trip trail near Brookings that takes you to epic views of the blue coastline. These views are filled with cool sea stacks, caves, trees, & of course the two natural bridges created by rock formations! The layers of sea stacks & rocks in the background make for such a unique scene & look seriously unreal as the backdrop of an elopement.\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Natural Bridges\n\nDogs are welcome on the trail as long as they’re leashed!\n\nThis trail is kid-friendly, so you’re welcome to bring along the younger guests for this “hike” too.\n\nTo get to the Natural Bridges, you’ll park at the Natural Bridges trailhead lot. You can read this helpful article for exactly how to get to the scenic viewpoint, or just ask me & I’ll take ya there! 😉\n\nOregon Waterfall Elopement Locations\n\nToketee Falls\n\nHow far is Toketee Falls from Portland?\n\nToketee Falls is located 230 miles south of Portland, about a 4-hour drive.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nToketee Falls is part of Umpqua National Forest, which I think is a totally underrated part of Oregon. It’s a gorgeous waterfall at the end of an easy 0.9-mile round trip trail near Idleyld Park that flows over the coolest-looking basalt cliffs and is framed by lush trees & vibrant green moss. I love love shooting here because there are a few rocks at the front of the pool the falls flows into, which are perfect for couples to stand on & get that epic waterfall backdrop!!\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Toketee Falls\n\nThe Toketee Falls Trail is dog-friendly and there are actually some off-leash areas for them to roam around!\n\nThis trail is kid-friendly and the round trip takes less than 30 minutes to complete, so you can bring little ones or beginner hikers along to your ceremony with no problem.\n\nIt’s a popular trail, so you’ll likely run into other hikers and people out exploring! Avoid the warmest parts of the day especially in the summer, if you want to try and avoid crowds as much as possible.\n\nAbiqua Falls\n\nHow far is Abiqua Falls from Portland?\n\nAbiqua Falls is closer to Portland, just 1.5 hours & 53 miles away.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nAbiqua Falls is another gorgeous waterfall that flows over basalt rocks & is surrounded by moss and vibrant greenery, located in the Santiam State Forest. The 0.7-mile round trip trail to get to the falls is considered moderately challenging, so it’s definitely not as easy as the trails to other falls like Toketee Falls (see above section). The waterfall flows into a super beautiful pool and down into the Abiqua Creek\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Abiqua Falls\n\nDogs are welcome on the trail to Abiqua Falls as long as they’re on a leash!\n\nThis is also a popular trail, so you may run into other hikers during the warmer parts of the day when the weather is nice.\n\nTo get to the trailhead, you can park before the dirt road & walk to the trailhead, or if you have a high-clearance vehicle, you can drive the gravel road & park at a turnout just past the unofficial trailhead.\n\nSometimes it can be difficult to find the right way to go on this trail, so make sure you download the offline map from AllTrails (or just book me as your photog and I’ll lead the way 😉 )!\n\nWahclella Falls\n\nHow far is Wahclella Falls from Portland?\n\nWahclella Falls is fairly close to Portland, sitting along the Columbia River Gorge, just 40 minutes & 40 miles away from the city!\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nDid I mention that Oregon is literally filled to the brim with gorgeous waterfalls?? Well now you know! Wahclella Falls is another beautiful waterfall that’s fairly easy to get to via a 2.4-mile round trip trail that takes you through a slot canyon. What’s unique about Wahclella Falls is that it’s two-tiered: there’s an upper AND lower falls that are both super pretty!\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Wahclella Falls\n\nIt’s a fairly easy trail to complete, so it’s a great option if you have guests with you who may not be able to do more challenging hikes!\n\nDogs are welcome on a leash on the Wahclella Falls Trail, so bring your furry friend(s) along for sure!\n\nYou’ll need to pay a $5 entrance fee or have a Northwest Forest Pass to enter the trail.\n\nLatourell Falls\n\nHow far is Latourell Falls from Portland?\n\nLatourell Falls is also pretty close to Portland, only 30 miles away & typically a 35-minute drive.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nI love Latourell Falls because of how EASY it is to get to & how much variety there is in the area. To get to Latourell Falls, all you have to do is park in the parking lot just off the Columbia Gorge Scenic Highway, and walk down a quick path through the trees. Then bam, you’re at the falls! Or, you can take the longer (moderately difficult) 3-mile loop trail if you want a little bit of a longer hike. Not only is the falls sooo gorgeous, flowing over basalt and surrounded by greenery, you also have access to beautiful forested areas and a little bridge that looks super cute in photos, too.\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Latourell Falls\n\nOnce again, dogs are welcome at Latourell Falls as long as they’re leashed!\n\nThis is a highly-visited waterfall, so be prepared to see other hikers & potentially have them in the background of your elopement if you hold your ceremony at a busy time of day/busy day of the week.\n\nBridal Veil Falls\n\nHow far is Bridal Veil Falls from Portland?\n\nBridal Veil Falls is super close to Latourell Falls, so it’s just 30 miles from Portland.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nThis is a great spot to visit if you’re already visiting Latourell Falls – you can easily hop from one waterfall to the next when you’re driving along the Gorge! Bridal Veil Falls State Park has two trails you can choose from, one 0.3-mile lower trail that takes you to the base of the waterfall, and one 0.5-mile overlook trail that takes you to some epic views of the Columbia River Gorge.\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Bridal Veil Falls\n\nLeashed dogs are welcome on the trails at Bridal Veil Falls!\n\nThe hike to the falls is short but fairly steep, so keep that in mind when picking your footwear & deciding if you’ll have guests come along.\n\nSilver Falls\n\nHow far is Silver Falls from Portland?\n\nSilver Falls is a part of Silver Falls State Park (crazy right??) and is located 55 miles south of Portland, a little over an hour drive away.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nSilver Falls State Park actually has 10 different waterfalls in it!! There are a few trail options you can choose from, the most popular ones being the full moderately-difficult 6.9-mile loop to see all 10 waterfalls. You can also take a shorter 2.8-mile loop by turning back after the Lower South Falls, or opt for a quick 0.7-mile hike by looping to the bridge at the base of South Falls. No matter which option you go for, you’ll get gorgeous forest & waterfall scenery!\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Silver Falls\n\nSince Silver Falls is part of a state park, you’ll need to purchase a 1-day parking permit on-site or buy an annual parking permit beforehand.\n\nMake sure to research trail conditions & statuses before visiting this park, as there has been some trail damage due to 2020 wildfires recently that could affect where you want to go. You can take a look at all important notices for the park here!\n\nUnfortunately dogs aren’t allowed on the trails in Silver Falls State Park!\n\nOregon Mountain Elopement Locations\n\nSaddle Mountain\n\nHow far is Saddle Mountain from Portland?\n\nSaddle Mountain is on the way to Cannon Beach from Portland, 72 miles northwest & a little over a 1.5-hour drive from the city.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nSaddle Mountain is the highest point in northwest Oregon and offers gorgeous panoramic views of the Oregon Coastline, and even multiple mountains in the distance! The hike to the summit is a more difficult trail as it gets pretty steep, so be prepared for that if you want to get to the summit with the best viewpoint.\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Saddle Mountain\n\nUnfortunately as of the time of writing this (March 2022), the Saddle Mountain Trail is closed until further notice due to a failed footbridge. Hopefully by the time you read this, it’ll be open again!\n\nDogs are welcome in the area as long as they’re on a leash!\n\nMt. Hood\n\nHow far is Mt. Hood from Portland?\n\nMt. Hood National Forest is 62 miles east of Portland, about a 1.5-hour drive.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nThe Mt. Hood National Forest is suchhh a beautiful area of Oregon that I think is also underrated & doesn’t get the attention it deserves! It extends across more than a million acres of land filled with forests, mountains, lakes, and streams, and most obviously, Mt. Hood. There are tons of amazing hiking trails in Mt. Hood National Forest for all ages & ability levels. You can find some of the best ones here on AllTrails!\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Mt. Hood\n\nMake sure you monitor alerts & notices for the area before your elopement, because unfortunately there’s been some recent damage and closures due to wildfires.\n\nCheck out the conditions of the area you want to visit in the weeks & days leading up to your elopement to make sure everything is open & available for you to explore. You can see the current conditions of nearly every area in the forest here!\n\nMt. Hood Elopement Guide\n\nI freaking love Mt Hood sooo much that I even created a whole guide on How to Elope at Mt Hood – check it out here if you’re interested in choosing Mt Hood for your elopement location!!\n\nOther Oregon Elopement Locations\n\nColumbia River Gorge\n\nHow far is the Columbia River Gorge from Portland?\n\nIt depends on what part of the Columbia River Gorge you’re visiting, but the beginning of the scenic area is just 20 minutes east of Portland, about 16 miles!\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nThe Columbia River Gorge is one of THE most unreal, beautiful areas in the state. It’s actually the largest National Scenic Area in the country, spanning 80 miles filled to the brim with epic scenery & viewpoints, more than 90 waterfalls, gorgeous cliffs, lush greenery & forest areas, and trails galore. All you have to do to experience the amazing views is legit just drive along the Columbia Gorge Scenic Highway & pull over anywhere you want to!\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Columbia River Gorge\n\nCertain spots along the Gorge can get suuuper crowded, because obviously everyone wants to experience the incredible scenery. If you’re eloping on the Gorge during the summer, consider eloping at sunrise, on a weekday, or finding a more secluded spot to at least have as a Plan B in case your original location is too crowded!\n\nBetween May 24 & September 5 2022, you may need a timed-access permit to drive along the highway, depending on the area you’re visiting. Learn more about how to get one here!\n\nCrater Lake National Park\n\nHow far is Crater Lake National Park from Portland?\n\nCrater Lake is a bit of a trek toward the southern area of Oregon, about 4.5 hours & 246 miles away from Portland.\n\nAbout the landscape\n\nCrater Lake is the only national park in Oregon, but does notttt disappoint. It’s the deepest lake in the whole country and provides some of the most UNREAL views of its blue water & the surrounding Cascade Mountain Range! It would be an EPIC place to elope if you’re looking for an Oregon elopement location both in the mountains & by a gorgeous body of water.\n\nWhat to know about eloping at Crater Lake National Park\n\nSince it’s a national park, you’ll need to pay an entrance fee of $30/vehicle in the summer & $20/vehicle in the winter.
