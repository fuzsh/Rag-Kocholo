        "text": "A Weekend Exploring the Columbia River Gorge and Portland, Oregon\n\nThe Columbia River Gorge, which serves as the state line between Oregon and Washington, is one of those places you see in pictures and can’t believe exists. It is so strikingly beautiful and lures thousands of visitors every year to the Pacific Northwest.\n\n*This post contains affiliate links, so I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links on my site at no additional cost to you.\n\nSadly, in 2017, a significant portion of the Gorge suffered a devastating fire, known as the Eagle Creek Fire. The fire burned 48,000 acres of land and closed more than 100 trails. Six years later, I am happy to report that area is full of new growth and most of the trails have reopened. There is also a great effort by locals and visitors to protect and care for the land, including some tourist restrictions and usage rules, all of which are easy to embrace.\n\nWhile I was planning my trip to see and hike through the Gorge, I quickly realized the area is much bigger than I had imagined. There are over 90 waterfalls along with breathtaking views, hiking and mountain bike trails. The choices are overwhelming. Unless you live in the Pacific Northwest and are able to re-visit the Gorge frequently, chances are you will need to narrow down your list of sights and activities to fit into the length of your visit.\n\nIn this post I will share what I was able to see and accomplish over a late-summer weekend. I did a ton of research before settling on a final plan, finding out which hikes were do-able for me and which views views I couldn’t miss. Depending on your walking stamina, you can tailor your trip to hike more or less than I did. Or, there are even options for people who don’t want to hike at all!\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe historic Columbia River Gorge waterfall route is located a mere 30 miles east of Portland. If your visit will be primarily focused on Portland with a day trip out to the Gorge, I would suggest staying downtown near Old Town. However, if your visit is focused on exploring the Gorge area, I would recommend staying somewhere near or east of the Portland airport.\n\nThe hotels near the Portland airport are in close proximity to the entrance to the The Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area, which starts just east of Gresham. My pick was the Marriott Courtyard Portland East for two nights. I spent a third night in downtown Portland at the Hi-Lo Hotel so I could explore some of the city highlights before my departure.\n\nWeekend Itinerary\n\nI arrived in Portland on a Friday morning. Immediately after getting situated with my rental car, I headed out to the coast to explore the beaches, parks, and seaside towns. To read about my visit to Cannon Beach and Ecola State Park, please click here.\n\nSaturday morning I woke up bright and early to begin my next adventure hiking the trails along the Columbia River Gorge. The following were the key stops and activities for the day:\n\nChanticleer Point Overlook\n\nMultnomah-Wahkeena Loop Trail Hike\n\nHorsetail Falls\n\nOneonta Gorge Tunnel and Bridge\n\nBridal Veil Falls Hike\n\nLatourell Falls\n\nShepperd’s Dell Falls\n\nVista House at Crown Point & Columbia River Overlook\n\nColumbia View Lavender Farm\n\nThe next morning, I went over to the other side of the Columbia River in Washington State. This side does not have quite as many waterfalls and trails, but I wanted to see the landscape from the other side.\n\nBridge of the Gods\n\nBeacon Rock\n\nBy lunchtime, I was ready to head into Portland to discover some of the cultural and historical sights of the city. To read my post about what to see and do in Portland, please click here.\n\nColumbia River Gorge Hikes + Sights\n\nChanticleer Point\n\nThe scenic overlook at Chanticleer Point offers a stunning view of the historic Vista House framed by the Columbia River Gorge. The overlook is just a short distance away from Vista House and can be combined with your visit to the landmark.\n\nHowever, I decided to visit Chanticleer Point early in the morning as my first stop so I could see the misty morning light over the gorge — and saved my visit to Vista House until later in the afternoon. It was just slightly out of the way while en route to Multnomah Falls. The parking lot was empty and it was a perfectly peaceful spot for a few deep breaths of fresh air.\n\nAbove photo: View of Vista House and the Columbia River from Chanticleer Point\n\nMultnomah Falls and the Multnomah-Wahkeena Loop Trail Hike\n\nTotal Distance 4.8 mi | Elevation gain 1700′ | Type: Loop | Difficulty: Moderate | Forest Service Map\n\nThe most popular waterfall and tourist attraction in the Columbia River Gorge is Multnomah Falls with more than 2 million visitors stopping by each year. It is visible from the highway — and even from across the Columbia River in Washington State. The falls drop a total of 620 feet, which is a combination of the upper fall of 542 feet and the lower fall of 69 feet with a 9 foot elevation drop between the two falls. Visitors can walk across the viaduct between the upper and lower falls for a closer look at the striking cascade.\n\nAbove photos: Multnomah Falls Visitor Center\n\nAbove photos: Multnomah Falls\n\nAbove photo: Multnomah Falls\n\nThe majority of visitors to the falls stay close to the Visitor Center and simply enjoy this bucket list attraction. For those looking for more adventure, there are several trail heads leading to other waterfalls and scenic areas. Visitors can choose to take a short walk to an upper viewpoint over the falls or head further back along the Multnomah Creek and Wahkeena Trail Loop, This is what I did!\n\nThe trail, also known as Wahkeena Trail #420, is classified as moderately difficult. As someone who is in reasonably good shape, I found it to be challenging. Regardless of whether you walk the loop clockwise or counter-clockwise, there is a seriously steep ascent with a dozen or more switchbacks weaving up the cliffside. Once further back, the trail is rocky and continues at an incline until you reach a fairly level ridge with views over the Columbia River.\n\nAbove photos: Along the Multnomah-Wahkeena Loop Trail\n\nThe hike back down is easier, but can still be challenging due to the uneven terrain and steep grades. The total distance of the loop is just under 5 miles. Normally, this distance would take me about 1 – 1.5 hours on a track or a level trail. But due to the level of difficulty, I completed the loop in roughly 3.5 hours, including multiple stops to rest and take photos.\n\nThe Multnomah-Wahkeena Loop Trail rewards hikers with access to numerous other waterfalls that you can only see if you are willing to put in the work. It was worth it!\n\nAbove photo: Wiesendanger Falls from the trail\n\nAbove photo: Ecola Falls from the trail\n\nAbove photos: Along the Multnomah-Wahkeena Loop Trail\n\nAbove photo: Fairy Falls\n\nAbove photo: Wahkeena Springs from the trail\n\nAbove photo: Wahkeena Falls from the footbridge\n\nAbove photos: A footbridge over Wahkeena Springs (left) and Lemmons Viewpoint (right)\n\nHorsetail Falls to Ponytail Falls Hike\n\nTotal Distance 0.8 mi round trip | Elevation gain 600′ | Type: Out and back | Difficulty: Easy\n\nHorsetail Falls is another waterfall that is easily visible from the side of the Historic Route 30 Highway. The falls drop 176 feet over a cut in the columnar basalt cliff and have the appearance of a horsetail, hence the name. Visitors can swim in the water at the base of the falls or enjoy lunch at the picnic area.\n\nThis is also the trailhead for Horsetail Falls Trail Hike, which passes behind the base of Upper Horsetail Falls (also called Ponytail Falls). While the trail continues further back towards the Oneonta Gorge, it was closed while I was there due to the dangerous conditions of the trail resulting from the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire.\n\nAbove photos: Horsetail Falls\n\nOneonta Gorge Tunnel and Bridge\n\nThe Oneonta Gorge Bridge and Tunnel were built in 1914 as part of the Historic Route 30 Highway. This 125-foot-long tunnel passes through a 200-foot-high bluff on Oneonta Creek’s right bank. When construction began on the new Interstate 84, the tunnel was bypassed and abandoned. It filled up with debris and remained unusable for decades. In the summer of 2006, the tunnel was dug-out and restored as a walking and biking path for visitors to the area.\n\nAbove photo: Oneonta Tunnel\n\nThe original bridge passing over Oneonta Creek provides views into the Oneonta Gorge, which has historically been a huge draw for visitors. However, the Eagle Creek Fire ravaged the gorge resulting in the indefinite closure the trail to the public. From the bridge, the lichen-lined cliff walls and infamous log jam up the creek can still be seen albeit not quite the same as it once was.\n\nAbove photos: Oneonta Gorge\n\nBridal Veil Falls Hike\n\nTotal Distance 1.0 mi round trip | Elevation gain 70′ |Type: Out and back | Difficulty: Easy\n\nBridal Veil Falls is often the first or second stop for eastward traveling day trippers to the Columbia River Gorge due to its location on the western side of the scenic area. But, for me, I decided to pass Bridal Veil until later in the afternoon so I could accomplish my more challenging hikes in the cooler morning temperatures.\n\nBridal Veil offers two different hikes. One is a loop that goes out to an overlook and the other is an out-and-back trail that goes down to Bridal Veil Creek and the falls. I chose to do the latter.\n\nAbove photos: Bridal Veil Falls Trail\n\nThe hike is downhill on the way to the falls and uphill on the way back to the parking area. Thankfully, the park commission has placed some benches along the way for those who may need to stop and catch their breath, making this an ideal hike for all ability levels. This is also a very do-able hike for kids.\n\nBridal Veil Falls consist of a 2-tiered waterfall with a total drop of 120 feet. The top of the falls is tucked underneath the highway bridge that passes over the creek. At the base of the falls you can still see remains from the old Bridal Veil Falls Lumbering Company.\n\nAbove photo: Bridal Veil Falls\n\nLatourell Falls Loop Trail Hike\n\nTotal Distance 2.4 mi | Elevation gain 600′ | Type: Loop | Difficulty: Moderate\n\nLatourell Falls is a 224-foot single-drop waterfall within Guy W. Talbot State Park. If you are driving west from Bridal Veil, it is the next big thing. You can see the falls from the viewpoint at the park without even having to hike, if you are tuckered out by the time you get here.\n\nThe hike is a little challenging in parts, especially over the rocky terrain and on the switchbacks. But, of course, those who make the effort are richly rewarded with views of the Upper Latourell Falls. On the way back, the views of the 1914 highway bridge are pretty cool. It is a lightweight construction due to the instability of the ground which is evident from the reinforcements and bolstering of the ground in various areas.\n\nAbove photos: Latourell Falls (left) and Highway Bridge (right)\n\nShepperd’s Dell Falls Hike\n\nTotal Distance 0.2 mi round trip | Elevation gain n/a | Type: Out and back | Difficulty: Easy\n\nShepperd’s Dell Falls are just a stone throw away from Latourell Falls. Directly off the highway, there is a short, steep path and stairs leading down to the base. The total height of Shepperd’s Dell Falls is 220 feet, but just the 45-foot lower drop can be seen from above the bridge. The falls actually have two upper tiers and two 20-foot drops below the bridge.\n\nAbove photo: Shepperd’s Dell Falls from the bridge\n\nVista House at Crown Point State Scenic Corridor\n\nAs my day began to wind down (and I was too tired to do anything else), I made a stop at the Vista House at Crown Point. Back in the day, this was essentially a roadside rest stop. The views overlooking the Columbia River Gorge are amazing, but the interior of the Vista House is also quite impressive.\n\nAbove photos: Vista House\n\nBuilt in 1917, this beautiful observatory now serves as a museum and memorial to Oregon pioneers. If you can fit it into your itinerary, it is a really special piece of history to see. It is completely free to enter. However, be aware that opening hours are limited to Friday – Monday 9am-5pm contingent on staffing. It will also close if winds go above 50mph.\n\nAbove photos: Vista House\n\nAbove photos: Columbia River views from Vista House\n\nColumbia View Lavender Farm\n\nAddress: 38401 Historic Columbia River Hwy, Corbett, OR 97019\n\nJust down the road from Vista House in Corbett, the Columbia View Lavender Farm was an unexpected find while en route back to Portland. The rolling field of purple flowers caught my eye. I immediately turned my blinker on and pulled in. This local farm offers cut-your-own lavender bouquets and a super sweet little lavender-lemonade stand, along with several other homemade lavender products. I bought myself a lemonade to sip on while walking through the fields and a jar of lavender honey to take back home with me.\n\nAbove photos: Columbia View Lavender Farm\n\nBridge of the Gods\n\nBridge of the Gods is a steel truss cantilever bridge spanning the Columbia River. It connects the Oregon-side of the gorge to the Washington-side of the gorge, slightly upriver from Bonneville Dam. While I didn’t have time to fully explore Cascade Locks, this area has quite a few interesting viewpoints and a Marine Park, which includes an exhibit of the Oregon Pony steam engine that brought passengers and freight past the rapids in the mid-1800s.\n\nI crossed the bridge en route to Beacon Rock State Park. The drive alone was very scenic and crossing the bridge was a really cool experience! Note: There is a small toll to cross the bridge.\n\nAbove photos: Bridge of the Gods\n\nBeacon Rock (Washington Side)\n\nBeacon Rock State Park is a a 4,458-acre, year-round camping park on the Washington State side of the Columbia River Gorge. I almost crossed this off my list at the last-minute, but I am so glad I mustered up the mojo to go!\n\nThe main attraction at this park is Beacon Rock, a 848 foot-tall core of an ancient volcano. There is a mile-long switchback trail that takes you to the top. I would classify the hike as easy to moderate. The switchbacks have a mild incline and offer incredible views of the Columbia River and the Oregon side of the gorge along the way.\n\nThe Beacon Rock trail is open daily from 8 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discover Pass is required and can be purchased on-site or online in advance.\n\nAbove photos: Beacon Rock\n\nOther Helpful Planning and Visiting Tips\n\nThere aren’t many places to eat or pick-up groceries along Historic Route 30. I swung by a grocery store in Gresham before starting out in the morning to pick-up a few things for a picnic lunch. Water is also a must.\n\nThere are public restrooms at several of the trailheads. Always a good idea to make a pit stop when you see one of these. The restrooms are fairly well maintained and have actual facilities and running water.\n\nWatch the weather and plan accordingly. Heavy rain will create dangerous conditions on some of the trails.\n\nPack layers. The mornings can be chilly. But, by afternoon, you may want to shed some layers. My complete packing guide can be found here.\n\nMake a rough plan of your stops and hikes. I put the most challenging hikes at the top of my itinerary in case I ran out of steam. I did. I ended up missing a couple things on my list, but still felt really good about what I was able to see and enjoy.\n\nMost of the trail maps can be downloaded here. Another option is to download the AllTrails app to your mobile device so you don’t have to print anything out. If all else fails, trail maps are posted at each of the trailheads. You can commit the route to memory or snap a quick picture to have with you for reference.\n\nThank you for reading my post!
