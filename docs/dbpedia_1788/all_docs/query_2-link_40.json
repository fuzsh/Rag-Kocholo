        "text": "Yosemite is home to countless waterfalls. The best time to see waterfalls is during spring, when most of the snowmelt occurs. Peak runoff typically occurs in May or June, with some waterfalls (including Yosemite Falls) often only a trickle or completely dry by August. Storms in late fall rejuvenate some of the waterfalls and all of them accumulate frost along their edges many nights during the winter.\n\nThis is not a complete list of Yosemite's waterfalls. While all but the last two of the waterfalls listed below are in Yosemite Valley, both Yosemite Valley and many other areas of the park have waterfalls both big and small.\n\nYosemite Falls (2,425 ft)\n\nFlows: approximately November through July, with peak flow in May.\n\nLook for the ice cone at the base of the upper fall during winter and for roaring runoff April through June. Yosemite Falls, one of the world's tallest, is actually made up of three separate falls: Upper Yosemite Fall (1,430 feet), the middle cascades (675 feet), and Lower Yosemite Fall (320 feet).\n\nYou can see Yosemite Falls from numerous places around Yosemite Valley, especially around Yosemite Village and Yosemite Valley Lodge. A one-mile loop trail leads to the base of Lower Yosemite Fall (the eastern side of the loop, from the shuttle stop to the base of the waterfall, is wheelchair accessible).\n\nIt's also possible to hike to the top of Yosemite Falls as a strenuous, all-day hike (see a list of Valley day hikes).\n\nCheck out the Yosemite Falls webcam for a current view of the waterfall!\n\nView a 10-minute podcast episode about Yosemite Falls."
