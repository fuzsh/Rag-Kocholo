        "text": "The Amalfi Coast is known for its rugged shoreline dotted with small beaches and pastel-colored Italian fishing villagesâ€”but when it comes to weddings, it offers so much more.\n\n\"The best [wedding venues along the Amalfi Coast] are the locations that are a bit off the radarâ€”the ones that don't have websites because they are historical locations owned by the government, or private islands which [book] by recommendation only,\" explains Diana Sorensen of Sugokuii Events. To access these types of wedding properties for a truly unique event, you must work with a local planner who knows the area.\"\n\nSome of Sorensen's favorite scenes? The chic Villa Tre Ville in Positano, the lemon-infused scenery of Da Paolino restaurant in Capri, the lush outdoor gardens of Villa Astor in Sorrento, and the bohemian feel of Quattro Passi restaurant in Nerano. For a classic Amalfi experience, opt for a vintage Italian sailboat to cruise the coast whenever possible, rather than traveling to your event locations by car.\n\n\"Lake Como is a luxury destination, unlike other luxury destination. The decadence [here] is less obviousâ€”its a traditional, historical luxury, not with flashy cars and designer stores, but an authentic, old-style, aristocratic luxury,\" says Rachel Birthistle of The Lake Como Wedding Planner. \"I would advise that couples take time to explore the area thoroughly. It is a unique place full of contrasts, which can create an exciting flow of events that, in turn, make for a truly phenomenal and authentic Italian experience,\" she adds.\n\nOpt for the picturesque Villa Balbiano of The Heritage Collection, like BAZAAR Bride couples Kristen and Zack (pictured here) and Chris and Simon. Or, head to the exclusive and utterly romantic Villa Pizzo, where John Legend and Chrissy Teigen tied the knot. If you're looking for something a little less chartered, opt for the indulgent Villa Sola, located just down the road from the iconic Grand Hotel Tremezzo (the hotel and villa share the same owners, so a seamless event is guaranteed). If you're looking to get a comprehensive look of all the venues on the lake, explore Birthistle's top venues prior to your arrival in town.\n\nPuglia, a southern region forming the heel of Italy's \"boot,\" is known for its whitewashed hill towns, centuries-old farmland, and miles of Mediterranean coastline. \"The best part about Puglia is its variety in scenery and styles for weddings,\" says Norma Cohen of Norma Cohen Productions. When chatting with Cohen, she described a spectacular wedding event she produced at Borgo Egnazia, which was able to accommodate 480 wedding guests on-site and provide a plethora of activities and vibes for the full wedding weekend, which was packed with various dinners, parties, and celebrations.\n\nCohen's #1 piece of advice when planning a destination wedding internationally? Work with local vendors as much as possible. You'll be grateful you did when you're looking to coordinate details in advance, and avoid excess taxes and fees attempting to bring in supplies from abroad.\n\nWhen it comes to getting married in Ireland, Dublin-based event planner, Tara Fay, insists couples always keep the weather top of mind. \"We have been known to have four seasons in one day [in Ireland]. We always plan for rain and hope for sun,\" she says. For those planning a wedding abroad, Fay suggests having your legal or civil ceremony in your home country and a blessing or second ceremony in Ireland. The registration system can be more challenging than it's worthâ€”and this applies to all destination weddings outside your home country.\n\nAs for choosing your Irish venue, Fay recommends the newly renovated five-star Adare Manor for larger, more lavish weddings. Others on her list include Ballyfin, an exquisite house that can be yours for the weekend, Ashford Castle, Ballynahinch Castle, Markree Castle, and Luttrellstown Castle (made famous by David and Victoria Beckham when they wed here in 1999). If you're looking for something smaller, consider more private spaces like the beautiful Merrion Hotel in Dublin, Virginia Park Lodge, Gloster House, and Powerscourt House.\n\nAn established holiday destination, with paths connecting many coastal villages and towns, the Cote d'Azur features some of the world's most famously luxe beach locales, like Saint-Tropez and Cannesâ€”and beautiful venues for a destination wedding. Asking your guests to travel here won't require much convincing, but do keep your wedding itinerary in mind when you do, and leave some time for friends and family to explore on their own.\n\n\"We often find that destination wedding couples tend to want to plan something every hour to keep their guests occupiedâ€”but some things can be left optional. While some may enjoy a perfume making class (highly recommend!), others may want to explore the medieval village of Ãˆze at their leisure. Make sure to provide your guests with some suggested local activities, along with expectation-free maps and suggested times to visit,\" advises David Beahm of David Beahm Experiences. \"Far and beyond, [our] favorite venue is the Grand-HÃ´tel du Cap-Ferrat, A Four Seasons Hotel on the CÃ´te d'Azur,\" adds Beahm. While the hotel boasts a richly storied past, it has been beautifully renovated with modern amenities, all the while maintaining the South of France's undeniably relaxed glamour.\n\nWith world-class facilities, available international air links, and an unparalleled selection of unique venuesâ€”from 5-star luxe hotels to medieval and royal palaces, London offers a truly unique experience for a destination wedding. \"In terms of style, finesse, and authentic 21st-century glamour, our vendors have experience at the very highest-end of the spectrum. Having worked on weddings for A-list royals, state banquets for Her Majesty the Queen, and unique celebrations for the world's leading international families,\" says London-based Sarah Haywood of Sarah Haywood Events. For those looking to plan a wedding in London from abroad, \"Contact the embassy or high commission of the country you wish to be married. In most countries, it is possible to organize civil or religious ceremonies, the former usually being simpler to arrange,\" adds Haywood.\n\n\"Couples considering London as a destination could marry at any of our working palaces which are conveniently overseen and run by Historic Royal Palaces,\" Haywood explains. \"Imagine a Rehearsal Dinner at the Tower of London, a Wedding Ceremony in the Kensington Palace State Rooms, followed by a reception at Banqueting House, and a farewell event at Hampton Court Palace,\" Haywood suggests. For an authentic wedding fit for a queen (literally), there is no better location.\n\nUnique textures, patterns, and vibrant colors highlight this Moroccan cityâ€”gaining popularity as an adventurous destination wedding location. Need proof? Check out BAZAAR Bride couple Jane and Shane's Marrakech wedding, complete with camel riding, ATVing, and playing with falcons (pictured here).\n\nBruce Russell typically works on 1-2 weddings per year in Morocco and recalls how \"very laid back\" it can be. He suggests couples hire a wedding planner with experience in the area who is in the know when it comes to the culture, but also to the hotels, food, vendors, and more. \"Visit your venue before signing a contract, do the research, and get trusted recommendations to ensure that the vendors you hire meet your expectations,\" he adds. As for where to celebrate, Russell has a few recommendations. \"The Royal Mansour is the ultimate in luxury with premiere food & beverage; La Mamounia features the most beautiful gardens; Beldi Country Club is all about classic Moroccan style, and the grounds are a photographer's paradise.\" As for the events surrounding the ceremony, Riad El-Fenn is the perfect location for a welcome party, and The Capaldi Hotel sits at the base of the Atlas Mountains, which offers panoramic views that are out of this world.\n\nFamous for its rich history, culture, and incredible scenery, Istanbul \"can be so much more exciting for an active group than a beach destination,\" says Marcy Blum of Marcy Blum Associates. There are a plethora of things to do for guests that have traveled far, and there are so many artisans to work with when it comes to creating a one-of-a-kind wedding experience.\n\nFor those planning a destination wedding in Istanbul, Blum suggests moving guests by sea if you must relocate for various parts of the wedding weekend. Traffic can be a challenge, and like Lake Como and the Amalfi, sometimes it's just better by boat. For those considering importing food and florals, \"couples should love a destination for what it is and what it has to offer,\" Blum adds. As for venue ideas, Blum recommends Ã‡ubuklu 29 from a recent wedding, which has spectacular views.\n\nBali is an extraordinary location for a wedding. But \"one thing to keep in mind is that it requires almost 24 hours of travel time from New York City,\" notes Lisa Vorce. That said, a destination wedding in Bali is well worth itâ€”it's a lush and verdant location, and well off the beaten path. Bali's rainy season is from October to April, so you must make sure to have weather backups in place (i.e., a tent instead of an open space.). \"One of my favorite things about Bali is the Rain Stoppers, who perform a ritual with incense and fire that creates smoke, believed to push the rain clouds away,\" Vorce adds.\n\nWhen it comes to the look and feel of your event, \"My best design advice for couples is to partner with local artisans. Balinese artisans can provide handmade dÃ©cor, such as Capiz-shell chargers, and create many different hand-woven textilesâ€”from chandeliers to placemats,\" she says. In addition, hand-strung jasmine is readily available, and makes for a dramatic ceremony structure. \"We often hang strung jasmine on the backs of the bride and groom's dinner reception chairs for an extra-special touch,\" she explains.\n\nExpert planning also avoids long lines at the airport. An essential travel tip from Vorce: Work with your hotel to pre-plan \"Visas on Arrival,\" which almost all guests will require; they are social, tourist, and cultural visas for their stay. When it comes to venues, \"both of the Aman properties in Bali, Amandari and Amankila, are incredibly beautiful; of course, the Aman hospitality is 5 star,\" Vorce recommends.\n\nFrom tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins, and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha, Thailand is a Southeast Asian country filled with a rich and unique culture. In Bangkok (the capital), you'll find an ultramodern city next to a quiet canalside community. Nearby, the iconic temples of Wat Arun, Wat Pho, and the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew), plus beach resorts like the bustling Pattaya and fashionable Hua Hin.\n\nWhen planning a destination wedding in Thailand, Lynn Easton of Easton Events suggests having \"a small team on the ground\" in addition to your primary wedding planner. There will undoubtedly be a language barrier, and you'll want to have someone local along with your trusted planner to help with the details. As for venues, Easton recommends the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, the Four Seasons Chiang Mai, Dhara Dhevi Chiang Mai Resort, and Amanpuri Phuket as ideasâ€”and we're ready to pack our bags.\n\nLocated on the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal has an Old World charm, unlike many destinations. And while it's not on the Mediterranean, it does feature some of Europe's most beautiful beaches. When it comes to planning a destination wedding in Portugal, look no further than The Wedding Company. \"Plan at least 10-12 months ahead of [your wedding] date, and make time to visit before committing to a venue,\" says founder Jasmine Lazzari. Lazzari suggests couples be flexible with dates, as the weather in Portugal can be tricky. With cooler temperatures in the summer and warmer weather in September and October, you'll want to avoid the busiest month for tourists in August.\n\nAs for venue recommendations, The Wedding Company suggests PalÃ¡cio Fronteira, a 17th Century Palace, in Lisbon. \"It's the perfect size for our weddings, which tend to be around 100-120 guests, though the venue can hold much more,\" she says. \"The quintessential blue and white tiles speak to important historical moments, and serve as grand artwork for this impressive palace,\" Lazzari adds. The Four Seasons Hotel Ritz, Lisbon, for winter/early spring weddings only, is a classic choiceâ€”suitable for larger groups looking to emulate a timeless glitz and glamour with a 1950's European vibe. Other venue options include PalÃ¡cio de Seteais, a boutique hotel \"35-minutes from Lisbon; it's where the Portuguese Royal family went to stay for their summer holidays,\" Lazzari says.\n\n\"Spain is an extremely diverse destination, making it an ideal option for the client that has a love of the arts, music, beaches, cities, and the countryside,\" explains Jennifer Zabinski, owner of JZ Events. \"It's easily accessible via a relatively short, direct flight from the northeastâ€”and it's also an easy country to navigate once you're on the ground.\"\n\nAs for where in the country to wed, \"hidden vineyards and castles make this destination both romantic and enticing,\" says Zabinski, whose favorite venues include Castell Son Claret in Mallorca. \"It's an old castle turned hotel, nestled amongst gorgeous gardens, and boasts a 2-star Michelin restaurantâ€”the only starred restaurant in the Balearic Islands.\"\n\nLocated in Southern Spain, Punte Romana in Marbella is a larger beach resort that has many versatile event spaces. But don't forget the cosmopolitan options; \"city lovers should consider Villa Magna, located in the heart of Madridâ€”it \"has ballrooms with terraces available\" for the couple looking to plan a wedding weekend packed with various parties.\n\nThis French-speaking Caribbean island is known for its white-sand beaches and luxe shopping. When planning a destination wedding in St. Barths, Mindy Weiss, wedding planner of Victoria's Secret model Devon Windsor and Jonathan Barbara's epic island wedding, recommends trying to limit your guest count. \"The island is small, so it lends itself to more intimate groups,\" she says. \"But there are lots of great resources on the island, so you don't have to bring everything in if you don't want to. Just remember, the professionals there work at a calm pace, that's in part what makes them so friendly, but you'll want to pace yourself as well and manage your expectations of urgency,\" Weiss adds.\n\nTwo wedding venues that Weiss loves in St. Barths are the iconic Eden Rock, an Oetker Collection property, and the newly rebuilt Le Sereno Saint Barthelemy. \"Both are gorgeous backdrops for events, very wedding-friendly, and easy to work with,\" says Weiss. \"When getting married in a foreign country, it helps to choose a venue that you can rely on, in addition to one you love the look of.\"\n\nAnguilla, located in the Eastern Caribbean, is comprised of a small main island and several offshore islets. Its beaches range from long sandy landscapes to secluded shores, making it ideal for couples looking for something different, with all the comforts of a luxury tropical respite.\n\n\"For couples planning a destination wedding, itâ€™s crucial to keep in mind that an international location requires a completely different type of time commitment,\" says Michelle Rago of Michelle Rago Destinations. Rago planned her first destination wedding in the Caribbean in 2004, and specializes in planning weddings around the globe. \"Anguillians are an incredibly proud group of people, and Anguilla is such a great place, culturally, to get married. To get to the island you do have to take a boat, but there are so many fun activities to doâ€”and the smaller islands make for great private parties.\n\nAs for where to stay? Rago suggests the Four Season Anguilla or the Malliouhana. From incomparable views to endless activities for your guests, Anguilla is a romantic and gorgeous destination wedding location in an area of the world that can tend to feel a bit too saturated when it comes to beach weddings.\n\nA compact, bright, and charmingly beautiful city, Cartagena has quickly become a travel and wedding hotspot. Case in point: Virginia and Ian's tropical wedding, featured on BAZAAR Bride. \"Itâ€™s colorful colonial streets filled with historyâ€”and the beautiful romantic lightâ€”make it a very desirable destination with natural charming backdrops for your big day,\" explain Matthew Robbins and Luis Otoya of RobbinsOtoya Destination Weddings & Events.\n\nCartagena books up very quickly so planning with sufficient time is key. \"We recommend to starting to plan a year out (at minimum), and working with a team that knows the ins and outs of the city; a local team can help you facilitate the process with all the local vendors,\" adds Robbins and Otoya. Cartagena is a tropical destination, so itâ€™s warm year round. \"The best months for outdoor celebrations in Cartagena are December, January, February, and March,\" says the experts, RobbinsOtoya. This is considered dry season, so the boutique city is at its best.\n\n\"In our opinion, the best venues in Cartagena are totally unconventional,\" Robbins and Otoya recommend. Privatizing a fraction of the World Heritage Wall that surrounds the old city of Cartagena is a very unique experience. \"You basically have to build the venue to your liking with natural colonial beauty all around you,\" they add. Other popular spots include Baluarte San Ignacio and Baluarte San Francisco Javier; or, opt for a grand colonial home with interior courtyards and patios. Lastly, the Capillas (chapels) of Hotel Santa Teresa and Hotel Santa Clara are stunning options as well.\n\nWhen it comes to getting married in the Great American West, embrace the terrain, and work with the landscape and season to create an event that is harmonious in the environment. \"A nod to Western themes can be fun, but try not to be too on-the-nose,\" encourages Laurie Arons of Laurie Arons Special Events. \"Weddings should feel personal to the couple, so injecting some individual style is what makes a wedding special,\" she adds. Pay attention to the comfort of your guests. Western landscapes are rugged, and making guests trek through unpleasant terrain in formalwear can start the event off on the wrong foot. \"Weather in these places can also be unpredictable, so have a solid rain plan in place, and make sure guests know to pack for a variety of temperatures. Things can change in an instant, especially in the mountains,\" Arons admits.\n\nRanches are incredibly fun settings for destination wedding weekends because guests bond over the shared activities and experiences. Consider some favorite locations with both activities and natural beauty, such as Brush Creek Ranch and The Ranch at Rock Creek. Or, opt for the sweeping mountain views of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where \"there are several pieces of private property that allow couples to create and curate their wedding from scratch,\" Arons suggests. Want something a bit more modern? Head to Amangiri for your wedding weekend insteadâ€”the brand's dreamy respite in Antelope Canyon, pictured here, in Dana and Justin's elopement.\n\nWine Country may boast unmatched outdoor venuesâ€”but, it's essential to do your research. \"If you are looking to select a winery, you will find that Napa County has just a select few grandfathered in that are permitted to host weddings,\" advises Stephanie Cole and Sarah Drake of Cole Drake Events. \"There are more options on the Sonoma County side of the hill with equally beautiful vistas,\" they say. If a full bar is a priority for your fete, be aware that in most cases, wineries are licensed for beer & wine only (read: no hard liquor), and there are noise restrictions for outdoor events. \"Make sure that you are aware of when sound ordinances go into effect, and plan for an after party if you are wanting to keep the party going late,\" the duo adds. Should you be looking to party until the wee hours here, choose your after party venue wisely, or opt for a silent disco.\n\nAs for where to wed, Calistoga Ranch has a little bit of everythingâ€”from caves, vineyard, Mountains, sweeping views, and lakes, to fabulous food & beverage. \"You can also host your event until 2 a.m.,\" Cole Drake confirms. Other prime properties include Beaulieu Gardens, a remarkable French Country Estate, Meadowood for its significant guest count capabilities and 1 a.m. curfew, and Auberge du Soleil for its sweeping views of the Silverado Trail valley floor.\n\n\"In Southern California, the weather tends to be good all year round, so we see weddings occur every month of the year,\" says Brooke Keegan of Brooke Keegan Special Events. \"The ideal months, however, are September and October. The weather tends to be perfect, and we usually do not see much rain during this time,\" she adds. Southern California is such a desirable destination, it's easy to understand why many guests will make the trip hereâ€”and then typically tack on a few extra days to make it a vacation.\n\nSome of Keegan's favorite Malibu and Southern California wedding include Rancho Valencia Resort and Spa in Rancho Santa Fe, Cal-A-Vie Health Spa in Vista, Gull's Way (Private Estate) in Malibu, and San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara.\n\nWhether you opt for the Caribbean coastline of the YucatÃ¡n peninsula, like CancÃºn or Tulum, or head to Mexico's Baja peninsula for a Cabo celebration, Mexico has so many vacation-like experiences for you to consider when planning your wedding. Be mindful of the weather, and give your guests some ideas on dress codeâ€”trust us, no one wants to wear black tie on a hot day on the beach. Think cocktail chic, loose and linen wedding wardrobe.\n\n\"Although everyone loves unique and clever welcome items, consider providing practical items for your guests upon arrival. Items such as sunscreen, insect repellent, and stain removers will all come in handy to help your guests enjoy their experience on location in Mexico,\" suggests Debbie Geller of Geller Events. \"Design for your environment. It should feel authentic and local. There's no reason to take your guests on the road and design a space that could be in New York or Los Angeles,\" she adds. And lastly, don't forget to give your guests time to explore and lounge by the pool.\n\nAs for where to wed, \"Nizuc [in CancÃºn] is a great option for a destination wedding in Mexico for several reasons. Our clients love its contemporary architecture, but its design still feels authentically Mexican,\" says Geller. The base price of their rooms is affordable for most guests, and upscale suites are available for those wanting a more luxurious experience. \"On the east coast, Rosewood Mayakoba offers access to a unique chapel in an authentic Mexican village for up to 85 guests, and the village itself is a space that works perfectly for a rehearsal dinner that truly gives a sense of place,\" she adds. They also have amazing venues on-property for more substantial sized events both outdoors as well as a \"palapa\" that can accommodate up to 250 guests. \"For smaller weddings, we love both the One&Only Palmilla and Las Ventanas, a Rosewood Hotel in Cabo,\" Geller suggests.\n\nWhen it comes to planning a destination wedding in South Florida or the Bahamas, consider the weather and time of year. You'll want to avoid hurricane season and \"remember that these are widely popular destinations for family vacations, so planning accordingly when booking a venue can be critical to the overall experience,\" says Bryan Rafanelli of Rafanelli Events.\n\nAs for the best venues, \"The Breakers, located in Palm Beach, is a Rafanelli Events favorite. We have produced events [there] ranging from 50 to 300 people, all in different layouts. There is a space for any type of event there,\" Rafanelli says. Thinking Miami? Opt for the other-worldly Vizcaya, or take inspiration from this Miami Beach wedding of BAZAAR.com Beauty Director Jenna Rosenstein and opt for a more cosmopolitan hotel like The Edition Hotel or The Faena. Planning to wed in the Bahamas? Consider the Four Season Ocean Club or the Rosewood Baha Marâ€”both offer waterfront options, as well as unparalleled service."
