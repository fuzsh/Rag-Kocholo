        "text": "Growing up in the glorious Pacific Northwest, I took the incredible waterfalls in Oregon for granted for far too long.\n\nIn fact, it wasn’t until I moved out of Oregon that I started feeling homesick for the unparalleled nature of the Pacific Northwest and regretted not spending even more time outdoors.\n\nHeck, even though I spent most of my free time (weekends and vacations) over the past 5 years exploring amazing Oregon waterfalls, I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface.\n\nI mean, Oregon is home to more than 230 waterfalls (that we know of)! Some of the most striking waterfalls in the world are found in our very backyard. So learn from my mistake and get out there.\n\nPack your car and call a friend, today we plan your trip to the best waterfalls in Oregon. Let’s get to it!\n\nWhy should you trust my list of the best waterfalls in Oregon?\n\nFor starters, I’m a lifelong Oregonian! I was raised in Portland and spent most of my childhood exploring the spectacular natural wonders of Oregon.\n\nShortly after meeting my husband we embarked on a whirlwind tour of the state — visiting every corner and popping off at every small town we passed.\n\nMy husband films national parks and forests for a living (I know, I can’t believe that can be a real job either) and so we hike a lot.\n\nWe both thoroughly enjoy hiking (and living in Oregon) and have made it our mission to find the best waterfalls in Oregon to share with anyone interested in planning a trip to our beloved state. To that end, if there’s a waterfall I missed that’s worthy of inclusion on this list please drop me a comment below!\n\nTips for Exploring Oregon’s Waterfalls\n\nLeave no trace\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Leave No Trace, it’s a measure to be a good steward of the land. You can read about the seven principals of Leave No Trace here.\n\nYou + Sunscreen = Best Friends (Forever)\n\nI swear by this sunscreen (and so do 5,000+ other people), I discovered it in France and now buy it in bulk. It works like a charm and doesn’t leave strange residue or smells, you’ll NEVER catch me without it!\n\nBest time to see waterfalls in Oregon\n\nWaterfalls vary by season, so based on the time of year you choose to hike to a waterfall in Oregon you will see drastically different results. Hiking conditions are ideal during the pleasant summer months but most waterfalls reduce to a trickle.\n\nHiking in winter is dangerous but the weather conditions completely transform the landscape and the force of the waterfall is greatly intensified. There’s no bad time to do an Oregon waterfall hike, just be aware that the seasons affect the waterfall condition.\n\nWear hiking boots with good traction\n\nEven though (most) Oregon waterfall trails are well maintained, exposed roots are common. It’s easy to trip on the trail, so set yourself up for success by wearing proper shoes. These are my hiking boots and I’d sleep in them if I could.\n\nBest Waterfalls in Oregon\n\n20. Downing Creek Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Detroit, Oregon\n\nSituated near the town of Detroit, Downing Creek Falls is one of my favorite waterfalls in Oregon because of the striking contrast between the rushing 40-foot waterfall and the thick carpet of moss that insulates every inch of the stunning landscape.\n\nThis is one of the harder waterfalls to find in Oregon, which is why it remains elusive to so many folks.\n\nIf it wasn’t so photogenic I’d have been more mad about getting lost on the trail. I’ve pinned the approximate parking spot for the falls here. My recommendation is this – when you turn off onto the access road from Hwy 22, park at the last “turnout” if you can (about a mile in). The road is rough and overgrown so if you’re nervous about your car park at one of the earlier “spots”.\n\nWherever you end up parking, hike to the end of the gravel road and take the trail from there. You may be tempted (like me) to take the “trail” from an earlier turnout. Don’t. It’s not a trail and will only lead to a profanity-laden slog through the dense brush along the creek.\n\nFrom the end of the road it’s only about a quarter of a mile to the falls, which are really stunning. Seriously, wow. Pack a snack and enjoy it for a while. Odds are you’ll be the only one out there. This is easily the least trafficked of the best Oregon waterfalls on this list for those who make the trek.\n\nThis is a great Oregon waterfall for photographers because chances are high you’ll have the whole place to yourself and you can play around with all the angles.\n\n19. Sweet Creek Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Mapleton, Oregon\n\nSweet Creek Falls is an epic four-tier waterfall that cascades down 70 feet over mossy rocks and smooth logs into a large pool of icy water. The base is a great spot to enjoy a snack or packed lunch and just admire this picture-perfect Oregon waterfall.\n\nThe trail guides visitors to all four tiers of the waterfall which is handy because some of the tiers are only visible from certain vantage points as each of the drops pivots a bit from the last.\n\nThe first tier cascades 10 feet, the second drop creates a horsetail formation whilst dropping 30 feet before merging with the final two tiers that clock in at 15 feet each. The culmination of this watery splendor is a feast for the eyes.\n\nAnd since certain bends in the creek keep some of the waterfall out of view, the best way to experience this in all its glory is by hiking to each one. Otherwise you may only see the bottom two tiers, which are still pretty epic but only half the story.\n\n18. Paulina Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Bend, Oregon\n\nThe first time I saw Paulina Falls it was mostly frozen over. It was the dead of winter and I had snowmobiled to get there. Well, in all fairness my husband did most of the snowmobiling. All the same we got there and it was amazing. Although I may or may not have tipped over the snowmobile on the way…\n\nAnyway, after wondering what the falls might look like when not frozen-over for long enough, I decided to see for myself. They’re gorgeous!\n\nOregon has a lot of beautiful waterfalls but these are pretty unique in the way there’s multiple sections cascading down of a single plateau. Not the only waterfall that does this but worth the stop in my book.\n\nThe best time to see Paulina Falls at its peak is probably in late June some time after the snow has melted off but before it dries up too much.\n\nGetting to the falls is quite easy (in the summer) via a .5 mile trail. While you’re in the area, be sure to hike the Big Obsidian Flow Trail & Paulina Peak!\n\n16. Gorton Creek Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Columbia River Gorge\n\nThis epic waterfall hike is as whimsical as you can image. It starts at Wyeth Trailhead near Gorton Creek where a heavily moss-laden trails leads you to Gorton Creek Falls, a secluded 115 feet waterfall.\n\nThe reason Gorton Creek falls is one of the best waterfalls in Oregon is because it feels like a secret. Unlike its very popular neighbors along the gorge, few folks choose to hike out here.\n\nAfter witnessing my husband slip and smack his head on a rock it makes sense why. Word to the wise – this trail is slippery to the point of dangerous so be careful and don’t rush (like he did).\n\nThe trail follows a path for 1/2 mile before ending at Emerald Falls, another pretty Oregon waterfall. The adventure doesn’t stop there, rather this is where the fun begins.\n\nFollowing a peaceful creek, the hike between Emerald Falls and Gorton Creek Falls requires sturdy slip-proof shoes and a sense of adventure.\n\nHiking to this incredible Oregon waterfall you get the feeling of being on an expedition searching for El Dorado or something. Towards the end you’ll need scramble up some boulders to reach it. As long as you watch your step and don’t rush, you’ll be completely fine — Gorton Creek Falls is worth the effort.\n\n15. Watson Falls (Southwest Oregon’s Tallest Waterfall)\n\nWaterfall Location: Douglas County, Oregon\n\nIn the safe confines of the Upmpqua National Forest, a mere stone’s throw from Oregon’s only national park (hey, Crater Lake) lies the highest waterfall in southwest Oregon and the third largest waterfall in the state.\n\nWatson Falls plunges a staggering 293 (continuous) feet and makes for one heck of an incredible display.\n\nObserving the falls, your eyes start with the lush mossy, fern-filled floor and follow the beautiful white ribbon of cascading water up through its rocky cathedral, past the the spill-over point, and into the healthy forest layer above before reaching the deep blue sky.\n\nA short half-mile hike leads you directly to a magnificent viewpoint that displays this incredible Oregon waterfall in all its glory.\n\nRead the interpretive signage along the trail to learn more about the geology of this incredible landscape.\n\n14. White River Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Maupin, Oregon\n\nWhite River Falls is intriguing in the sense that it’s situated in an arid landscape that doesn’t seem primed for the impressive and lush waterfalls we’re used to and yet here we are.\n\nDiving a stately distance of 90 feet into a striking pool of ice-cold water is one of the most breathtaking waterfalls in Oregon – White River Falls.\n\nThere’s two ways to see this incredible Oregon waterfall – either from a parking lot platform or with a short (but steep) half-mile hike.\n\nFrom there you may notice a side trail. Should you choose to take it you’ll find yourself at the foot of the waterfall, free to dip your feet in the icy water.\n\nThis waterfall is out there. Those who have been to Maupin know what I’m talking about. It’s out of the way for most traditional road trips but if you happen to be in the area, well worth the detour.\n\nThe last time we were here was on a road trip being chased by a big storm. We got to White River Falls just in time to see it in full splendor before the clouds moved in.\n\nHeads up: This Oregon waterfall swells with people during the hot summer months because it provides and invaluable reprieve from the oppressive summer heat.\n\n13. Punch Bowl Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Columbia River Gorge\n\nLocated about 2-miles into the epic Eagle Creek Trail en route to Tunnel Falls, Punch Bowl Falls is an aptly-named Oregon waterfall well worth the trek. This adventurous hike lives up to to the hype, even with the charred tattoo of the teenager-caused Eagle Creek Fire of 2017.\n\nThe trail follows towering basalt walls, mammoth conifers, vine-tangled maples, and a plethora of cascading waterfalls. Indeed, every inch of the trail treats hikers to the quintessential Pacific Northwest experience, which adds to its status as one of the best waterfalls in Oregon.\n\nLocal’s Advice: One thing to note is that while the photo above is current, most of the images you see of Punch Bowl Falls are no longer accurate. As a result of the fire, a massive log jam now blocks the original entrance to the falls. Reaching the waterfall requires a difficult (but doable) trek over the log pile.\n\nGood to Know: Locals swarm to this beloved watering hole in the hot summer months, but take warning – cliff diving is prohibited (and subject to a $300 fine).\n\n12. Bridal Veil Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Columbia River Gorge\n\nBridal Veil Falls is one of the best waterfalls in Oregon to explore with kids because the viewpoint is located right off the parking lot.\n\nThe waterfall drops 120 feet between two distinct tiers and visitors can explore both via a quick hike.\n\nThe lower trail descends to a creek before ascending to a beautiful viewpoint at the base of this iconic waterfall. You’ll pass by Bridal Veil Creek and notice what remains of the Bridal Veil Falls Lumbering Company. Read the interpretive signage to learn more about the mill if you’re interested.\n\nThe Overlook Trail is a paved half-mile trail that leads to a vista overlooking the breathtaking Columbia River Gorge. Since both trails are easy to do with kids I highly recommend making the effort them in tandem.\n\n11. Sahalie & Koosah Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Camp Sherman, Oregon\n\nSahalie and Koosah Falls is another great Oregon waterfall hike for families because it’s good for all skill levels. In fact, both waterfalls are visible from parking lot viewing platforms but the best way to experience these Oregon falls is by hiking closer to them.\n\nAn easy 2.6-mile loop trail takes hikers past both Koosah and Sahalie Falls while offer breathtaking scenery of moss-laden towering trees and the scenic McKenzie River.\n\nThe moss here deserves a moment of pause. I have never seen more in my life and this stuff is thick. Be careful when approaching the falls as the spray can get you pretty soaked in no time.\n\nOf the two waterfalls, Sahalie is larger (dropping 100 feet over a lava dam) but 70-foot Koosah is usually the crowd pleaser (personally I prefer Sahalie). In any case, hike to both and see which you prefer for yourself.\n\n10. Ramona Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Mount Hood National Forest\n\nTell any Portlander that you plan to spend a day at Mt. Hood National Forest and you’re bound to get a recommendation to visit Ramona Falls, easily one Oregon best waterfalls.\n\nFollowing the Sandy River, the 7-mile trail to Ramona Falls is best described as moderate, but it’s so scenic the time seems to fly by. We’ve hiked so many trails in Oregon over the years and consider this one of the most beautiful.\n\nReaching Ramona Falls requires sturdy footwear and a sense of adventure. An old bridge that connected the trail past the Sandy River was washed out so hikers now need to cross the river by balancing on logs. The adventurous hike to the falls is half the fun!\n\nThis is one of the most popular waterfall hikes near Portland during summer because of the trail’s proximity to the city. I recommend getting to the falls as early as possible to avoid crowds. We hiked it last summer about an hour after sunrise and had the whole trail to ourselves.\n\n9. Salt Creek Falls (The second tallest waterfall in Oregon)\n\nWaterfall Location: Willamette National Forest, Oregon\n\nLocated within the vast and beautiful Willamette National Forest lies the second-tallest single drop waterfall in Oregon. The powerful force of this 286-foot Oregon waterfall can be experienced from one of two viewpoints.\n\nOne viewpoint is accessible directly from the parking lot and the other view requires a quick .6 hike but leads directly into the canyon and eventually to the base of the falls. The power of these falls is hard to describe but wow, this is one that must be experienced first hand.\n\nWhile you’re in the area be sure to check out Waldo Lake, one of the clearest lakes in the world and a spot that I think is worthy of consideration for the Seven Wonders of Oregon.\n\n8. Latourell Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Columbia River Gorge\n\nBeing the closest waterfall in the Columbia Gorge to the city of Portland, this is one of the most popular waterfalls in Oregon. Everyone and their dog has seen it, loved it and told the tale.\n\nSo believe me when I tell you that this waterfall is crowded, but you simply can’t miss it.\n\nPlunging a jaw-dropping 220 feet over the lip of an impressive amphitheater made of dark columnar basalt, this Oregon waterfall hike feels like a great reward for little effort.\n\nAn easy 2.4-mile trail leads visitors directly to the first viewpoint before opening up to a dirt path that heads uphill and gets you closer to one of the most epic waterfalls in Oregon.\n\nFrom here you can choose to return to the car or hiker further uphill to Upper Latourell Falls, which I recommend you do so that you can enjoy this waterfall in all its glory.\n\n7. South Falls (The Trail of Ten Falls)\n\nWaterfall Location: Mehama, Oregon\n\nOf all the breathtaking Oregon waterfalls on the Trail of Ten Falls, none is more photographed than South Falls and there’s a reason for that.\n\nPlunging to striking depths of 175 feet, hikers are allowed to go behind the thundering curtain for a unique waterfall hike that feels like a sacred privileged.\n\nAt 9,000 acres, Silver Falls State Park is the largest state park in Oregon. Home to numerous waterfalls, it’s considered the crown jewel of the state park system.\n\nThe best way to explore this area? Hike the epic Trail of Ten Falls where you’ll wander past 10 waterfalls in the span of less 8 miles.\n\nWhile all 10 waterfalls along the trail are worth exploring, South Falls takes the cake because of its undeniable beauty and the fact that you can walk behind the curtain of water. It’s a rush like no other and an experience you simply can’t forget.\n\nSo if you’re looking for the best waterfall hikes in Oregon, the Trail of Ten Falls simply can’t be missed.\n\nNote: Dogs are prohibited on the Canyon Trail portion of this Oregon hike — which is where the waterfalls are located.\n\n6. Proxy Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Bend, Oregon\n\nJaw-dropping waterfalls in Central Oregon almost seem commonplace but not all of them are as easily accessible as Proxy Falls.\n\nOffering a spectacular treat for very little effort, this scenic waterfall hike in Oregon is one of the best ways to stretch your legs before brunch.\n\nThe 1.5-mile loop trail meanders through a healthy forest that loops around two waterfalls. The first waterfall on the hike is Lower Proxy Falls.\n\nWhen you reach the falls you may notice some folks getting really close to the base, the area is ripe for exploration just make sure you’re wearing proper shoes because it’s very easy to slip.\n\nThe massive log in front of the waterfall is a popular spot for folks to take photos but I was too nervous to get on it because it was so slick (ha!) but I saw plenty of other folks having a blast, the adventure is up to you.\n\nThe second stop along the trail is Upper Proxy Falls and you would be remiss to skip it!\n\nBoth of these waterfalls are incredible and serve as proof that Oregon has some of the best waterfalls in the country.\n\n5. Tumalo Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Bend, Oregon\n\nTumalo Falls is one of the prettiest waterfalls in Oregon because it looks picture-perfect. An impressive force of nature, this waterfall cascades nearly 100 feet before splashing into a log-jammed pool below.\n\nEncapsulated by a healthy pine forest, this whole scene looks like a scene from a fairy tale. So you probably won’t be surprised to learn that Tumalo Falls gets very crowded.\n\nSince this is one of the easiest waterfalls in Oregon to access (you can see it from the parking lot), it’s a popular pop-off spot for folks en route to Bend.\n\nThankfully, there’s a great little viewpoint that requires no effort to get to. But if you’d like to avoid crowds, I suggest trekking to the upper viewpoint to get a unique vantage point from the top of Tumalo Falls.\n\nThe 0.5-mile trail is well maintained and easy to follow and offers an opportunity to spot a handful of smaller waterfalls along the way.\n\nTip: The parking lot fills up very quickly, so come early or carpool with friends. I noticed a lot of bikers during my visit, make sure to watch out for them on the trail — it’s a popular mountain bike trail.\n\nFurther Reading: 15 JAW-DROPPING Hikes Near Bend, Oregon\n\nDeschutes National Forest Film\n\nMy husband and I traveled through Bend extensively because he was commissioned to create a film on the Deschutes National Forest. The film features Tumalo Falls along with many more. I posted the video above!\n\n4. Abiqua Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Scotts Mill, Oregon\n\nAbiqua Falls is one of Oregon’s best kept secrets. Tucked into a majestic amphitheater of striking basalt adorned with moss and red lichen, is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Oregon.\n\nThe reason? There’s a little bit of effort involved and an adventurous spirit is required.\n\nThis 0.8-mile trail is considered one of the best waterfall hikes in Oregon. It’s short but steep, so make sure you’re wearing proper hiking shoes.\n\nYou’ll notice a handful of ropes on the trail, use them during the steep descents and ascents to avoid slips.\n\nYou may need to scramble over boulders and rocks, but it’s nothing too crazy. Trust me, this is one of the best waterfalls in Oregon and is well worth the effort.\n\nThe trail leads to a pleasant creek that you will follow until the trail ends at a massive basalt bowl that houses Abiqua Falls. But let’s get real — you’ll be hearing this Oregon waterfall long before you see it because the rushing force of 90 feet is powerful.\n\nNote: Parking at the trailhead requires a high-clearance vehicle, otherwise you will need to park further up and hike in.\n\n3. Toketee Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Idleyld Park, Oregon\n\nYou probably know by now that Oregon is truly the land of waterfalls. We definitely have our fair share of jaw-dropping waterfalls to choose from but for me personally, none is more notable than Toketee Falls in Douglas County, Oregon.\n\nThe name Toketee stems from a Chinook word meaning “graceful” or “pretty” and there’s no denying this is an aptly named waterfall.\n\nThis two-tiered waterfall cascades an impressive 113 feet into a pool of pristine aqua-colored water. Similar to Tumalo Falls, it feels like a scene from a fairy tale, which is why I consider this one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Oregon.\n\nThe hike to reach Toketee Falls is a mere 0.8-mile round trip and only 200 feet of elevation gain. You’ll get views of the pristine Umpqua River along the trail but nothing will prepare you for the breathtaking viewpoint that opens up to the waterfall in full force.\n\n2. Tamanawas Falls\n\nWaterfall Location: Mount Hood National Forest\n\nOf all the incredible Oregon waterfalls I’ve had the privilege of exploring, none has impressed me more than Tamanawas Falls at Mount Hood National Forest.\n\nThe waterfall reveals itself at the lip of an impressive lava cliff and cascades down a thundering 110 feet before reaching the chilly pool at your feet.\n\nThe best part? Reaching this epic waterfall requires an effort because of the 3.4-mile trail, so the waterfall isn’t as crowded as some of the other more popular waterfalls in Oregon.\n\nClean mountain air and a striking evergreen forest guide the way as the trail hugs the pristine Cold Spring Creek for 1.5-miles before spitting you out at a breathtaking viewpoint.\n\nDon’t rush your time at the viewpoint and allow the magic of the moment to enchant you. You are at the base of one of Oregon’s best waterfalls, take it all in because you’ve earned it.\n\n1. Multnomah Falls (The Tallest Waterfall in Oregon)\n\nNote: Timed Entry Only\n\nParking Pass Required?: Yes, must reserve in advance\n\nDogs Allowed? Yes, must be kept on leash.\n\nPlunging a staggering 620 feet, Multnomah Falls is the tallest waterfall in Oregon. Attracting international visitors on a daily basis, this waterfall is a breathtaking sight that can be enjoyed up close and personal. Take a hike to the Benson Bridge (pictured above) for a better vantage of the towering falls.\n\nMeander past the rushing force of Multnomah Falls and feel the mist along the paved trail.
