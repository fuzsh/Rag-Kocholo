        "text": "We absolutely love that more people are starting to realize that large, elaborate weddings are not for everyone. If you’re someone who isn’t dreaming of having a traditional wedding day and want something more intimate, an elopement might be perfect for you. And if you love sweeping mountain views and pristine lakes, this list of places to elope in Colorado just might be what you’re looking for.\n\nPlease note: be sure to check with all local parks, national forests, and/or municipalities regarding permits that may be required before eloping to one of these locations. We provide general permit information below, but these requirements change often so reach out to the appropriate place for the most up-to-date info. :)\n\nIf you want a short list before viewing the whole blog, check out our top 10 places to elope in Colorado in the video below!\n\nPlaces to Elope Near Denver + Boulder\n\nPlaces to Elope Near Colorado Springs\n\nPlaces to Elope in Western Colorado\n\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison\n\nProbably the least visited National Park in Colorado, the Black Canyon is extremely unique. Along the ridge, you can see just how steep the walls of this canyon are, going deep down below. Definitely not for those afraid of heights or close edges here! :) It’s also in one of the darkest places in the state, making it fantastic for night sky photos and stargazing.\n\nBest Seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall\n\nPermits: Yes\n\nPlaces to Elope near Aspen, Vail, and Breckenridge\n\nPlaces to Elope in Northern Colorado\n\nHorsetooth Reservoir\n\nIf you want something farther away from crowds, a lot of us locals really love the area near Fort Collins and the Horsetooth Reservoir. You get nice mountain and lake views, and you can even rent boats or kayaks to get out onto the water during your elopement day!\n\nBest Seasons: Summer, Fall\n\nPermits: Yes\n\nBest Waterfall Elopement Locations in Colorado\n\nThere’s something truly magical about waterfalls: the sound, the mist in the air, the pounding of water on rock and earth that you can feel under your feet. All of this and more is what makes waterfalls a perfect, dreamy backdrop for elopements!\n\nIf your wedding day vision wouldn’t be complete without a stunning waterfall as a centerpiece in the scenery for your elopement, check out some of the best waterfalls in Colorado to visit for your big day!\n\nRifle Falls State Park\n\nSo many people living in Colorado don’t even know this place exists, which makes it even lesser known to those outside of the state. Rifle Falls feels like a tropical hidden gem right in the middle of the Rockies, complete with lush greenery all around three streams pouring from above during summer (or complete ice in winter!).\n\nAlthough this may change over time (and it’s always best to check the park for updates), the park currently does not require a permit or reservation for elopements with just the couple. They do offer a small amphitheater area for small, intimate ceremonies with a handful of guests, as well, and it’s super affordable at only $120 per day. One of the best parts about this spot is that the waterfalls are a super short, flat and easy walk from the parking lot — no hiking involved!\n\nAlberta Falls, RMNP\n\nIf you’re wanting something with a bit of a more wilderness vibe, you can take some elopement portraits at Alberta Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park. Although they do require any wedding and vow ceremonies to be reserved at specific locations inside the park, you can always opt for an elopement day that includes coverage for this 1.5 mile easy roundtrip hike (with only a 240 ft. elevation gain over the hike) to take portraits at the base of the falls.\n\nThis spot is located on Bear Lake Road and also includes some forested and aspen grove areas along the trail.\n\nOuzel Falls, RMNP\n\nAnother beautiful waterfall in RMNP for elopement portraits is Ouzel Falls. This hike is a bit more moderate at about 5.5 miles roundtrip with an elevation gain of just under 1000 feet, but it can be well worth it. Along this trail, you’ll not only get to see the creek and waterfall itself, but also have some mountain and meadow views, wildflowers, and potentially some wildlife.\n\nCrystal Mill\n\nFor those looking to do an all-day hiking elopement, the river and small waterfalls at Crystal Mill in Carbondale, CO may be the perfect option. We’ll need to save at least 4-5 hours to complete the 9 mile hike, not counting some time at the Mill for your elopement ceremony. It can be a very busy spot on weekends in summer, so be sure to book your elopement on a weekday for this location.\n\nSouth Mineral Creek\n\nAnother hidden gem of a location for waterfalls in Colorado is the South Fork Mineral Creek, located in the San Juan Mountains (also totally underrated!). This gorgeous turquoise waterfall is surrounded by some red riverbed rock, is easily accessed from the South Mineral Campground, and is open from May through September.\n\nBridal Veil Falls, Telluride\n\nAs the tallest free falling waterfalls in all of Colorado, Bridal Veil Falls are surely a sight to see, especially for adventure elopements. Located in Telluride, the waterfalls are 365 feet tall and require a moderate hike with a 1,300 foot ascent with a roundtrip length of about 4 miles. Definitely one of the best views in all of Colorado!\n\nHelen Hunt Falls\n\nBy far one of the easiest waterfalls to access in the front range, Helen Hunt Falls is located in Colorado Springs and a lovely option to consider for your Colorado elopement. There’s a parking area at the base of the falls inside North Cheyenne Cañon Park, and if you want to you can add on an extra little hike to Silver Cascade Falls as well.\n\nWhere to Elope in Colorado with Family + Friends\n\nBringing some guests along with you for the adventure? We love helping couples find the perfect location to celebrate with their loved ones!\n\nIt’s pretty standard in Colorado for any groups over 10 people to require a reservation and/or permit in advance for elopements and small weddings of 30 people or less (anything over this amount, and you’ll likely need to find a larger wedding venue to accommodate you). Here are our top recommendations for elopements with a guest count between 10-30 people:\n\nSunrise Amphitheater\n\nChautauqua Park\n\nA Colorado State Park\n\nBrainard Lake Recreation Area\n\nMaroon Bells Amphitheater\n\nDillon Marina Park\n\nSmith Cabin, Aspen\n\nSapphire Point\n\nWindy Point Campground\n\nBreckenridge Nordic Center\n\nJuniper Mountain House\n\nEcho Lake, Mount Blue Sky (formerly Mt. Evans)\n\nPoint Park, Grand Lake\n\nLunch Rock, Winter Park\n\nVail Wedding Deck\n\nSan Sophia Overlook, Telluride\n\nDunton Hot Springs\n\nAlta Lakes Observatory\n\nTwin Lakes\n\nRocky Mountain National Park\n\nGarden of the Gods and/or Garden of the Gods Resort\n\nPeanut Lake / Woods Walk, Crested Butte Land Trust\n\nBlack Mountain Lodge\n\nCamp Hale\n\nAshcroft Ghost Town\n\nColorado National Monument\n\nThree Peaks Ranch, Westcliffe\n\nCheesman + City Park, Denver\n\nAirbnbs/VRBOS that allow events\n\nColorado VRBO Rentals that Allow Events\n\nAlthough this may change over time, as of March 2023, the following VRBO listings currently allow events such as small weddings on site. Always be sure to ask the owners first.\n\nMountain Oasis near Nederland, Black Hawk\n\nModern Wheat Ridge House\n\nBeautiful Denver Home\n\nBoulder Mountain Retreat\n\nMt. Vernon Ranch House\n\nConifer Mountain Home\n\n72 acre Wildlife Preserve House\n\nMountain Boho A-Frame\n\n15-Acre Estate North Colorado Springs/Monument\n\nHistorical Resort Home\n\nAward-winning Mountain Home in Silverthorne\n\nMaverick Hollow Getaway near Steamboat\n\n35-acre Home in Crested Butte\n\nTelluride Mountain Home\n\nAlta Lakes Observatory\n\nHow to Elope in Colorado\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to making your Colorado elopement dreams come to life:\n\n1. Select a date.\n\nOne of the best parts about eloping here is that you can literally choose any day of the year. This means that you can choose a day that already has significant meaning for you, a day with the seasonal weather you love (think: snow vs. sunshine), or simply one that works for your schedule.\n\nThat said, most of our elopements occur during summer and fall, when the mountain passes like Trail Ridge Road and Independence Pass are open for the season (Memorial Day – late September/October). It’s also the time of year that provides the most color in Colorado’s landscape, like greenery, wildflowers, and golden aspen leaves. Here are some general notes on the seasons in Colorado:\n\nDecember – March: best chances for snow are often in February and March, but never guaranteed. Could be heavy with snow one day, and sunny with warm temps the next.\n\nApril – May: often considered “mud” season in Colorado, when it can be very wet, rainy, and muddy on the trails. This is when the snow starts to melt, we can still get a random heavy snowstorm, several roads are still closed from winter, and not much greenery can be found unless you’re in the Denver/Colorado Springs metro areas.\n\nMay – June: our typical “springtime” weather, with longer and warmer days, although still a chance for fluke snow storms to come through one last time.\n\nJuly – August: lots of sunshine, lots of visitors outdoors, wildflowers are blooming, and afternoon thunderstorms possible. Lots of greenery around, and chances to see wildlife, like bighorn sheep and bobcats (although rare).\n\nSeptember – November: this is often one of the “safest” times of year to elope in terms of weather. Fewer storms, mild temperatures (not too hot, not too cold), and some autumn color on the trees around late September – late October.\n\n2. Find your vendors.\n\nColorado has hundreds of amazing elopement + wedding vendors to choose from. Our photography and videography team works all across the state, and we have several recommendations for other nearby vendors as well. It’s important to know that not everyone travels for work here, so you may want to start on vendors that live and service the area you’re eloping to.\n\nWhether it ends up being us or someone else, we believe you deserve to work with a vendor team you feel comfortable with. Be sure to check reviews for reliable companies to hire, and lock in the most important vendors as soon as you have a date. Many of us book up 6-12 months in advance.\n\nHere is a short list of some of the types of vendors you may want to book:\n\nPhotographer\n\nVideographer\n\nOfficiant\n\nHair/Makeup Artist\n\nFlorist\n\nPersonal chef / picnic company / bakery\n\nMusician(s)\n\n3. Make your guest list.\n\n…Or choose a “just-us” elopement experience! Some of our pro-tips when it comes to deciding who to invite:\n\nClose your eyes. When you picture your wedding day, who are the people you absolutely cannot imagine not having there with you?\n\nIf you had to name the top 5-10 people who have always been there for you and your partner, who spark the most joy, who support you in more ways than one, which people come to mind?\n\nThe opposite is also true: who are the people that would hinder your elopement experience, the ones who may only cause drama, pressure you, belittle you, etc.? This is your wedding day, and we’re here to give you the permission you need to only invite the people you actually want to be there.\n\nAlso keep in mind some compromises: maybe you elope just the two of you and celebrate with a reception later, maybe you cut back your guest count to immediate family only, or maybe something else entirely. There are also some great ways to involve guests who can’t or won’t be at your wedding.\n\n4. Book your lodging + other reservations.\n\nNow that you’ve got all the other details figured out, it’s time to figure out other important plans like where you’ll stay, where you’ll eat/drink the night of your elopement day, and transportation such as a rental car.\n\n5. Get your marriage license.\n\nAlthough you can get the legal paperwork done in your home state prior to eloping to Colorado, it can also be fun to have an official Colorado marriage certificate. In Colorado, you don’t need any witnesses or even an officiant to sign on your marriage license at all, and you can even have your pet sign as a witness with a paw print!\n\nHere are the county offices you’ll most likely need to check with in regards to the documents, timing, cost, and potential advanced appointments needed to get a Colorado marriage license:\n\nDenver County\n\nJefferson County\n\nEl Paso County\n\nBoulder County\n\nLarimer County\n\nSummit County\n\nLake County\n\n6. Plan your activities.\n\nThink of your elopement experience as the best day (or entire trip) you could ever imagine. What would that look like? Get creative and brainstorm all the other fun ideas you’d like to incorporate into your celebration. Nothing’s off limits! Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nHike / backpack\n\nEat / drink at local eateries, bars, distilleries or breweries\n\nCamp under the stars\n\nRelax by the fireplace or in a hot tub\n\nGo out for a fancy dinner\n\nSpend a day in a luxurious spa\n\nGo horseback riding, skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, kayaking, or canoeing\n\nRide in a hot air balloon\n\nDrive a Jeep, truck, ATV, or SXS on some 4WD roads\n\nRent a boat and ride out onto a lake surrounded by mountain views\n\nContact an Elopement Photographer + Videographer"
