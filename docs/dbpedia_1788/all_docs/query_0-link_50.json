        "text": "Multnomah Falls is easily the Columbia River Gorge’s most famous waterfall and could very well be the state of Oregon’s prime natural attraction.\n\nWhile our visits have constantly shown that it was always busy here (hardly surprising as it’s said to be visited by over 2 million people a year), all of that was forgotten once we stood before this towering 620ft two-tiered column of water with year-round flow.\n\nIn fact, we’ve frequently seen this waterfall proclaimed to be the second tallest year-round waterfall in the United States and the fourth tallest in North America.\n\nWhether these claims are true or not, it felt like all the academic trivia didn’t matter so much as we were content to simply enjoy it for what it was – a majestic waterfall!\n\nThus, we could totally understand its popularity, especially considering it was pretty close to Portland (roughly a half-hour’s drive).\n\nHeck, we enjoyed this waterfall so much that we even felt compelled to put it on our Top 10 List of the best waterfalls in the USA as well as our Top 10 Best Oregon Waterfalls List.\n\nThe Heritage of Multnomah Falls\n\nEven though we’ve seen quite a few towering waterfalls of at least this size, what really made this one stand out was that it seemed to have a bit of heritage to go with it.\n\nCase in point, there was an arched bridge spanning across the waterfall’s lower 69ft drop.\n\nCalled the Benson Bridge, it was built in 1914 and named after a Norwegian-born lumber baron who deeded this falls as well as a few others to the City of Portland.\n\nI think it was this bridge that really made Multnomah Falls a recognizable icon.\n\nFronting the falls was the historic Multnomah Falls Lodge, which was built in 1925 and had a classic look about it thanks to designer Albert E. Doyle who designed many recognizable buildings in Portland.\n\nSome of Doyle’s classic-looking buildings include the US National Bank Building and the Multnomah County Public Library.\n\nThese days, the lodge was being used as a souvenir shop, visitor center, and restaurant, and it’s not so much a place to stay overnight.\n\nExperiencing Multnomah Falls\n\nAs for visiting the falls, it was literally a breeze.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge was to find parking despite its massively large combined parking area encompassing an area right in front of the historic lodge as well as a separate lot sandwiched between the opposing lanes of the I-84 (see directions below).\n\nOnce we parked the car, we literally just had to walk towards the concrete walkway adjacent to the historic lodge and immediately start cranking our necks to gawk at the towering waterfall.\n\nIf the views weren’t enough, it was possible to hike up a paved path towards the Benson Bridge even up to the top of Multnomah Falls or beyond (which I’ll describe later on in this page).\n\nJulie and I have been to the falls on at least four separate trips so far (maybe more as I’ve lost count at this point).\n\nThe first time was in the midst of some pretty nasty late Winter storms in late March/early April of 2009.\n\nAs you can see from the photo above, the thickness of the Multnomah Falls was quite noticeable under those wet conditions.\n\nAs a result, the viewing area at the base was sprayed with mist so it wasn’t easy to take photos from there without waterspots getting on the lens.\n\nThe next two times we came here were in August of 2009 and 2017.\n\nWhile the falls took on a more slender appearance (see the photo at the top of this page), we felt it was just as beautiful (if not more so) than the swollen state of the falls that we saw it in during our rain-drenched Spring 2009 visit.\n\nOne thing we hadn’t done was to try to photograph the falls with Autumn colors, which I’m sure would add a whole different character to the scene.\n\nFinally, we got to spend a bit of time at the visitor center – once during bad weather on our first visit here in March 2009 and again in early April 2021 when the global pandemic caused some changes to facilitate social distancing.\n\nNevertheless, from our visits to the visitor center, we’ve had a chance to learn a bit more about the geology of Multnomah Falls as well as the greater Columbia River Gorge.\n\nIn fact, there were pretty cool 3-D models on display, waterfall comparisons between the Multnomah Falls and other famous ones, lots of historical and scientific tidbits, and more.\n\nI guess in the end, there were certainly many ways to linger here and soak in the experience, so to speak.\n\nThe Top of Multnomah Falls (Difficulty: 2.5)\n\nWhile the views from the immediate lookout would be pretty sufficient for viewing and photography purposes, sometimes we felt like we needed to do something more to savor the experience.\n\nThat’s where this option to extend the visit by going to the top of Multnomah Falls comes in.\n\nWhile the vast majority of visitors (some jokingly say 95% of them) would be content to go no further than the Benson Bridge (about a quarter-mile up or a half-mile round trip), I actually managed to go all the way to the top and back.\n\nThis longer hike encompassed the Benson Bridge as well as a surprise waterfall further upstream of the main drops of Multnomah Falls.\n\nThe top of the falls was a one-mile hike in each direction or 2 miles round trip.\n\nThe paved ramp to ascend beyond the main lookout began behind the Multnomah Falls Lodge.\n\nAfter passing through a gate (which I’d iamgine would be closed if the there was trail work or if the conditions were too dangerous), the path made a couple of switchbacks before following beneath an overhang.\n\nCages were set up to prevent large objects from falling onto the trail at this overhanging section.\n\nUnder rainy conditions, we also spotted a temporary waterfall that flowed before the overhangs then underneath the trail eventually joining up with Multnomah Creek down below.\n\nAfter a quarter-mile, I approached the often crowded Benson Bridge, where I could look upstream at the 520ft upper drop of Multnomah Falls or look down at the crowded main lookout where people were already starting to look tiny.\n\nBeyond the bridge, the trail ascended towards one switchback close to the upper waterfall before veering away and going around a bend towards a shaded forested area.\n\nRight around the bend, I was greeted with a sign saying “Switchback 1 of 11” so I treated that as sort of a progress indicator though some of the switchbacks didn’t seem to be counted if they were shorter and in succession.\n\nThe path remained sloping and paved as it navigated up the switchbacks, and even though the crowds had considerably thinned out compared to the Benson Bridge and the base of the falls, there were still enough people on the narrow trail slow my progress.\n\nThis was especially the case when I had to be opportunistic about passing slower hikers, especially those in groups.\n\nSome parts of the paved trail showed damage from tree roots growing beneath the asphalt while others had rocks strewn across them.\n\nI wonder if it’s perhaps cheaper to have a natural trail instead of a paved one.\n\nNevertheless, some of the switchbacks revealed partial glimpses of the Multnomah Falls while others revealed parts of the Columbia River.\n\nThe climb actually topped out at around switchback 7 or 8, where it had climbed about 895ft up to that point.\n\nThen, the trail started descending for the remaining switchbacks before a signed trail junction took me onto the final spur leading to the overlook above the top of Multnomah Falls.\n\nThe continuation of the main trail kept going towards Larch Mountain.\n\nOn the final approach to the overlook, I saw plenty of people enjoying the calmer parts of Multnomah Creek as it appeared to be the only place in the immediate vicinity to access the creek (it definitely wasn’t allowed at the bottom).\n\nWhen I finally got to the overlook platform (about a mile or more from the base of the falls), there was a surprise cascade or waterfall about 15ft tall, which sat a little more set back from the main drop of Multnomah Falls.\n\nWith the railings at the overlook, I was able to try my hand at steadying the camera for some long exposure shots.\n\nAnyways, more often than not, I generally think that experiencing the top of waterfalls to not be the most compelling spots to enjoy them.\n\nHowever, in this instance, the different perspective and that sense of vertigo when I looked down towards the parking lot had definitely made the experience memorable.\n\nWhile this lookout platform was nowhere near as busy as further below, there were always at least a handful of people around so it was still relatively busy.\n\nFinally, when I had my fill of the top of the Multnomah Falls, I then went back the way I came, which initially climbed the first few switchbacks before descending the rest of the way.\n\nDuring the descent, I tried to use my momentum to make quick progress and get back down in nearly half the time it took for me to go up.\n\nThat said, it took me just under 75 minutes to complete this hike.\n\nAuthorities"
