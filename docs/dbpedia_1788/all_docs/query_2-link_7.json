        "text": "As I said in a post about Malanaphy Spring Falls, one doesn’t really expect to find many waterfalls in Iowa. And honestly, there aren’t a whole lot, though there are still more than one might expect. Malanaphy Spring Falls was flowing very well in June of 2014, but Bridal Veil Falls wasn’t flowing very well.\n\nWhen I visited the area, it was relatively warm, and at that point, any water source for the falls had mostly (though not all) dried up. And maybe there really isn’t ever much water flowing over the falls. I have to admit I don’t know if I’d go out of my way to see the falls (unless I knew there had been a lot of rain recently). And yet, I also have to admit that Pike Peaks State Park (where Bridal Veil Falls is found) is a really beautiful park. There are great views of the Upper Mississippi River from a 500′ bluff. So…if you decide to stop, then the trek along the stairways through the park is enjoyable as you discover Bridal Veil Falls.\n\nDirections:\n\nFrom US-18 right near the Iowa/Wisconsin border (on the Iowa side), take the exit before you head over the Upper Mississippi River into Wisconsin.\n\nHead south along 1st Street. You’ll pass the Lady Luck Riverboat Casino if you’re headed in the right direction.\n\nAt some point, 1st Street will turn into River Street, which will then turn into Main Street.\n\nPass through the town of McGregor. Main Street will come to and end, and you will have to turn left onto Walton Street.\n\nAfter turning left, you will very quickly after turn right onto Clayton County Road 56.\n\nDrive along Clayton County Road 56 to the entrance of the park. (You want the entrance on Pike Peak Road. You will turn left on this road.)\n\nDrive to the parking area, and then obtain a map to help you find the falls. If I remember correctly, the signs to the falls are pretty clear.\n\nAccessibility: 8/10 (easy/moderate)\n\nHeight: 10′\n\nLength of Hike: Less than 1 mile round trip (multiple possible paths)\n\nWhere in the World is Bridal Veil Falls?"
