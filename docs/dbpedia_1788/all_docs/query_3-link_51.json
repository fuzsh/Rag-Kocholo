In fact, if you love comfortable hikes, cozy weather, and beautiful views there might not be a better time to get outside here. Fall foliage surrounds everyone who ventures out and the best way to enjoy it is on a fun hike. This one, leading to Bridal Veil Falls In New Hampshire offers a particularly beautiful way to experience the season here in the Granite State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bridal Veil Falls Trail is a great way to see fall colors in New Hampshire. It can be accessed any time of year, though I especially love it during the fall foliage season. Other visitors suggest that it’s best between May and October. This route is considered moderately challenging, so it’s best to have some hiking experience before heading out. You’ll also want to tell someone where you’re going and when you plan to be back. And, always make sure you have the right gear for your trip. I always bring layers with me, just in case. Most importantly, feel free to bring along the pups, but be sure to keep them on a leash.\n\nFor more information about visiting the White Mountain Nationa Forest check out the official U.S. Forest Service website. To learn more about the trail and for help planning your visit check out the Bridal Veil Falls page on AllTrails.\n\nLove New Hampshire in the fall? There’s more where this came from! After enjoying this hike, head out on a road trip to see some of the best fall foliage in the state.\n\nWant more New Hampshire in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around New Hampshire!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
