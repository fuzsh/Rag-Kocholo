        "text": "PROVO, Utah — Utah County Search and Rescue was called into an area at Provo’s Bridal Veil Falls Saturday afternoon to locate and rescue a 12-year-old child.\n\nSgt. Garrett Dutson with the Utah County Sheriff’s Office said the boy was rescued from Provo River. The boy was pulled out of the water just south of 800 North and University Avenue in Orem.\n\nAn Orem swift water rescue firefighter jumped in and was pulled back to the river bank holding the kid.\n\nThe boy was spotted in several locations along the river before being pulled out. He spent about 30 minutes in the water, which is a concerning amount of time, according to Dutson.\n\nOne responder was taken to the hospital with rope burns to their hands and the child was taken in an ambulance.\n\nThe boy has now been reported to have passed away, according to the Utah County Sheriff’s Office X page.\n\nDutson is asking everyone to stay careful and to keep a close eye on children, especially near the rivers which are very strong, fast and cold.\n\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\nRelated:"
