        "text": "Your wedding venue plays an integral part in shaping your big day. It establishes the look and feel of your celebration, dictates your guest count, and often accounts for up to half of your total wedding budget. All this to say, couples should spend a considerable amount of time choosing the best spot to exchange vows and say \"I do.\" But what happens if you don't have the budget to select your dream locale?\n\nHere's some good news: There are plenty of budget-friendly wedding venues available that don’t require you to sacrifice style or personality—though choosing an affordable option will come down to what you deem as inexpensive. \"Affordability is relative to each client,\" says wedding planner Roxane Bellamy. \"I'd suggest that clients take the time to assess their wedding budget and determine how best to distribute [it].\" Once you solidify a price point, however, landing on the right location will be an absolute breeze—and can allow you to splurge on more important wedding day details. “Choosing a less expensive venue will enable you to spend more of your budget on the things that matter most to you—whether that's food and beverage, design and décor, or photography,” says Amy Nichols of Amy Nichols Special Events.\n\nFor those currently searching for the wedding venue of their dreams, we put together a quick and easy guide to help you secure the best location for your nuptials. Read on for everything you need to know.\n\nHow to Book an Affordable Wedding Venue\n\nThe best way to find an affordable wedding venue is to work with a planner—or someone familiar with your proposed location—to help you secure and book the ultimate space. According to Bellamy, couples should start by asking themselves crucial questions about what matters most: \"What experience do you want to provide to your guests? What time of year? How far away from home are you willing to travel? How convenient to an airport should the location be? By providing your planner with all of this information, they are able to tap into their network and create a list that should meet most, if not all of your location needs,\" she explains.\n\nOf course, we know that not everyone chooses to hire a wedding planner (especially when on a budget), so if you and your partner are organizing your big day on your own, Nichols suggests checking out a few places that resonate with your relationship and fall within your desired price range. “If you don't have a planner, start by thinking about places in your area that are naturally beautiful, or have meaning to you and your fiancé,” she says. “This could mean public parks, beaches, vistas, or other public areas. Generally speaking, venues like that will have lower site fees than say a hotel or resort.”\n\nIt’s also important to consider what other wedding necessities you'll need to host your dream celebration. Specifically, Nichols advises couples to keep the below key points in mind when booking a venue on a budget:\n\nDouble-check if the pricing stated includes items such as tables, chairs, décor, games, or catering.\n\nWhen considering a public space as your venue, double-check if the space is required to stay open to the public during the event.\n\nIf your date is flexible, work with the venue to find the best date that suits your budget, even if it’s a Friday or Sunday.\n\n15 Affordable Types of Wedding Venues—Plus, Real-Life Examples to Inspire Your Own\n\nReady to start planning? Here are the 15 most affordable types of wedding venues, including a few examples to inspire your search.\n\n1. National Parks\n\nConsidering an outdoor wedding in a park or garden? Some of the most popular locales (think: Beaulieu Garden in Napa Valley, California, or the Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh) can have years-long waitlists and budget-busting prices. National parks, on the other hand, offer special use permits for a fraction of the cost, and offer you a chance to tie the knot surrounded by nature. Visit the National Park Service’s website to find the permit requirements for the park of your choice, where fees will run you around $100.\n\nBridalveil Falls, Yosemite National Park, California\n\nHow could you resist a ceremony site with a name like this? Bridalveil Falls is an easy 1⁄2-mile loop near the entrance to Yosemite, and is one of the first falls you’ll see in the park. A special use permit at Yosemite costs $150.\n\nUpper Beaver Meadows, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado\n\nA one-and-a-half-mile hike (with both a dirt trail and paved path available) leads you to a gorgeous spot with uninterrupted views of the Continental Divide. The open Upper Beaver Meadows will make you feel like you’re the only ones in the world—except for the herds of elk nearby. A special use permit at Rocky Mountain National Park costs $350.\n\nTimber Creek Overlook, Zion National Park, Utah\n\nLooking to keep your ceremony small? To maintain the area, Zion limits groups hiking to the Timber Creek Overlook to 12 or less—perfect for a mountain elopement. The trail follows a ridge overlooking the Kolob Canyons, and you can even see Mt. Trumbull at the northern edge of the Grand Canyon. Head there in the summer for a spectacular wildflower display. A special use permit at Zion National Park costs $100.\n\n2. City Halls\n\nA city hall wedding doesn’t have to be an elopement; while most are designed for more intimate groups, you can still say “I do” with close friends and family in attendance. Many are housed in historic buildings, so even if the ceremony room isn't gorgeous, the post-ceremony photos on the front steps will be completely stunning. As a bonus, having a ceremony at city hall is super affordable, and usually only requires a small fee in addition to the cost of your marriage license.\n\nSan Francisco City Hall\n\nThe stunning San Francisco City Hall may scream “luxury wedding venue,” but you don’t have to rent the building for the entire night. Host a simple celebration Monday through Friday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. with up to 100 guests for $1,000. Sure, it’s more expensive than a civil ceremony at the Office of the County Clerk ($93, plus the $112 marriage license fee), but the setting and the history make the investment well worth it.\n\nSt. Louis City Hall\n\nFor a ceremony only, the rotunda at St. Louis City Hall is a steal—only $150 for a group of fewer than 99 people. You’ll have access to the space for two hours (including photos), which is plenty of time for a walk down the aisle and a kiss. This dramatic space was inspired by the Hotel de Ville in Paris and will infuse your celebration with French opulence.\n\nAtlanta City Hall\n\nAtlanta City Hall offers a few different options for on-site ceremonies. A number of judges are available to perform ceremonies in their chambers, by appointment, and do not charge an additional fee beyond your marriage license. Some are also available for off-site or after-hours ceremonies, for which an additional fee may be charged. Looking for something a little more formal? Much like San Francisco City Hall, certain parts of the building are available to rent for your wedding celebration. Wed beneath 1929 chandeliers in the Old Council Chambers for $1,500, or celebrate in the City Hall Atrium for between $2,500 and $3,500, depending on the date and time.\n\n3. Backyards\n\nWhile having a backyard wedding definitely isn’t free, the amount you’ll save on a venue means you’ll have more to spend on the necessities (like furniture rentals, décor, and catering). It also gives you a cozy and comfortable place to get ready, and it means you’ll always be able to go back to visit where you tied the knot. Of course, there are a few things to consider: Be sure to check with your town and county about permitting and insurance, and consider looking into renting luxury portable restrooms (so your home’s system isn’t overloaded).\n\nA Sophisticated Backyard Wedding in Connecticut\n\nAs a wedding producer at Fête NY, Allison Aronne has years of experience planning weddings—but planning her nuptials to Ryan Beauchamp was that much more special of a job. Through her industry connections, Aronne found the perfect location for their nuptials—her boss, Jung Lee's, stunning backyard in Kent, Connecticut. With a gorgeous backdrop for their ceremony and the most beautiful tent set up on the lawn for dinner, this backyard wedding left no detail untouched.\n\nA Backyard Wedding at a Historic Maryland Farm\n\nOne couple opted to say \"I do\" on the 17th-century farm in Maryland where the bride grew up. It was the perfect setting for their English garden-inspired celebration—plus, thanks to the acres and acres of farmland, it had more than enough space for their 220 guests.\n\nA Poolside Backyard Wedding\n\nWhat do you think about partying poolside for your wedding? One real couple pulled it off flawlessly with a stunning backyard wedding in San Jose Del Cabo, Mexico. With a stunning view, paired with beautiful palm trees, this backyard soirée was truly breathtaking.\n\n4. Family Homes\n\nWho says you need to go far to tie the knot? If your house holds a special place in your heart, it might just be the perfect venue. Hosting your wedding at your childhood home, or the home your partner grew up in, can add so much more meaning to the day.\n\nA New England Home\n\nWhen your family home is a stunning Padanaram Village property in Massachusetts, you don't have to go far to tie the knot in a gorgeous setting. Couple Maddy and Andrew both had ties to the New England area, and Maddy dreamed of showing off the important place she considered her own summer oasis to friends and family. With a stunning harbor backdrop for the ceremony and a lovely dinner set up on the lawn, this wedding brought together the perfect balance of nostalgic childhood memories and a toast to the future.\n\nA Family Home in Texas\n\nWedding photographer Claire Pedregon wanted to evoke the feeling of a welcoming atmosphere when it came to her wedding—and she did just that by filling her family home with love and laughter for her and her partner's big day. “I’ve always dreamed of an outdoor, hill country wedding, and my parents’ space is so beautiful,” the bride shared. “I love that we will be able to revisit the spot with all of our friends for picnics and camping our whole lives!”\n\nA Childhood Home in New York\n\nAnnie Starke and Marc Albu knew they wanted to tie the knot at Annie's childhood home from the very beginning of planning their wedding. Located in Bedford Hills, New York, the couple held onto so many memories of the property and knew it would be the perfect place to bring together family and friends to celebrate. The ceremony was held beneath apple trees on the property, followed by a tented dinner set amongst a stunning wildflower field.\n\n5. Beaches\n\nIf a seaside soirée has been your lifelong wedding dream, you can absolutely make it happen. Of course, booking a venue that's actually on the beach is doable, but it may come with a hefty price tag. Consider asking friends or family members who have access to beaches to help you out, or look for a vacation rental on the beach that will allow an intimate gathering.\n\nA Beach Wedding in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico\n\nThe beauty of a beach wedding is that offers the most gorgeous backdrop for wedding photos. Here, Brittani and Jared tied the knot in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico amongst 171 guests. “We loved the luxurious feel of the resort, the amazing backdrops, and the surprising price point per room,” Brittani shared about her beach wedding. “We wanted all of our guests to leave thinking this was the best wedding they’ve ever attended.”\n\nA South Carolina Beach Wedding at the Bride's Childhood Home\n\nIf you're lucky enough to have beach access from your childhood home, why not use it as the perfect backdrop for your nuptials? Bride Lauren Schaper knew from the age of seven years old that's what she wanted to do, and she made it happen when she married her partner. With a ceremony on the beach and a tented reception on the lawn of this family home, this South Carolina wedding made perfect use of easy beach access for a gorgeous wedding.\n\nA Beachside Tulum Wedding\n\nBeach venues are also great because you can use nature as your backdrop, which, in turn, can save you tons of money on wedding décor. “The venue is like a blank canvas,” bride Meghan said about her Tulum beachside celebration. “After research, we saw so many weddings taking place there, and each one had its own charm to it. You can have as little or as much décor as you want, and the location still looks amazing because the scenery around is all breathtakingly stunning. The palm trees, the blue water—we couldn’t imagine getting married anywhere else.”\n\n6. Courthouses\n\nGetting married at a courthouse can sometimes get a bad rap, but there are some stunning architectural options out there—and we are totally here for them. Get married for next to nothing, and set up a photoshoot on the front steps or lawn of the courthouse to commemorate the day.\n\nSanta Barbara Courthouse\n\nThe Santa Barbara Courthouse is a stunning, historical spot to host a wedding. Built in 1929, the Spanish-Moorish architecture provides the perfect background for your nuptials, surrounded by beautifully maintained lawns and gardens. Couples can reserve the Courthouse Gardens space for $900, with an additional $200 reservation fee, with a maximum capacity of 250 guests.\n\nThe Historic DeKalb Courthouse\n\nWhile this courthouse may no longer be a government seat, it’s a gorgeous reason to get out of Atlanta. The beautiful marble building operates as a museum and offers weekday, daytime rentals of several stunning spaces for just $650.\n\nBeverly Hills Courthouse\n\nThe Beverly Hills Courthouse is the perfect option for couples looking for a quick elopement in style. This venue boasts stunning architecture, along with a volunteer marriage ceremony program that schedules volunteers who truly want to be part of your special day. The marriage license fee is $91, and the ceremony fee is $35, for an incredibly affordable option. The best part? Once the ceremony is over, you can head out to meet your photographer and capture stunning photos on the front steps.\n\n7. Libraries\n\nOf course, libraries are a special venue option for couples who love literature. But, libraries have the potential to offer something special to everyone, as some of these historic options are simply beaming with historic charm and elegance.\n\nGeorge Peabody Public Library\n\nWith space for 170 to 200, depending on seating, the George Peabody Library at John Hopkins University in Maryland is absolutely dreamy. Host your wedding amongst the stacks in this storybook setting. Rental fees are certainly pricier on Saturdays, but if you're open to a Friday or Sunday wedding (or even a weekday), you can rent this beautiful space starting at $5,000.\n\nBoston Public Library\n\nSince the Boston Public Library is world-renowned as a beautiful wedding venue, it isn't the most inexpensive option on this list. However, this setting does offer a few areas that could work for couples on a budget. For example, the courtyard offers a stunning option with rates starting at $6,500, or the Guastavino Room offers a gorgeous columned space for a reception starting at $3,000.\n\nProvidence Public Library\n\nProvidence Public Library in Rhode Island offers the most stunning, early 1900s architecture to host your nuptials. With marble flooring and hand-carved details, this space is absolutely spectacular. Plus, with a capacity for 200 to 300 guests, you won't have to leave anybody off the guest list. Rental rates range from $2,500 to $6,000, based on your date and time, with access to multiple rooms.\n\n8. Museums\n\nBeaming with architectural and artistic charm, museums are another unique option when it comes to wedding venues. Transport yourself to another world, depending on the space you book—though fair warning: With these options, be sure to consider that there may be quite a few venue rules to follow.\n\nCleveland Museum of Art\n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art was founded in 1913, offering a space to showcase a vast collection of art. It's also the perfect place to host your nuptials, offering multiple spaces for a ceremony including The Ames Family Atrium, as well as an on-site restaurant and private banquet room. Rental fees for this artistic gem start at $3,500.\n\nAmerican Visionary Arts Museum\n\nThe American Visionary Arts Museum offers multiple dreamy locations throughout the property to host a beautiful wedding. The Sculpture Barn & Wildflower Garden provides room for 130 guests, complete with outdoor garden space for a ceremony or the use of a stunning marble spiral staircase as a backdrop. Hoping for a restaurant setting instead? The on-property restaurant also boasts an outdoor terrace for ceremonies. Choose from a variety of space options, ranging from $750 to $9,000 to accommodate any guest list and budget.\n\ndeCordova Sculpture Park and Museum\n\nWhat better place to host an outdoor wedding than a gorgeous sculpture park, right? Located in Lincoln, Massachusetts, deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum is the perfect wedding location for the couple who loves art and the outdoors. Wedding events can be hosted on the Sculpture Terrace, on the Rappaport Roof Terrace, or inside the Dewey Gallery, and pricing ranges from $4,500 to $7,000, depending on your date.\n\n9. Restaurants\n\nRestaurants are often overlooked as wedding venues, but they can truly offer something special. Many restaurants design their spaces to accommodate large groups, whether they offer a private patio, a banquet room, or a full buy-out. \"Restaurants and country clubs tend to have lower food and beverage minimums than luxury resorts or private estates,\" adds Nichols.\n\nCity Winery\n\nWant the same vibe of a winery wedding without a huge expense? City Winery in D.C. is just the place. With exposed brick, a gorgeous wall made of pieces of barrels, and views of aging oak barrels, this is a gorgeous option for groups of 120 guests. What's more, this unique venue doesn’t require a separate venue fee and offers a package option to accommodate your guest count. At a rate of $175 per person, you’ll have access to private event space and a wedding suite, with the addition of passed hors d’oeuvres, a seated two-course dinner, sweet treats, and an open bar. There are also plenty of other add-ons including linens, tables, and chairs, along with a dedicated event manager to make sure things run smoothly.\n\nBottino\n\nBottino has been a New York staple for years, offering expertly prepared Italian cuisine in the Chelsea neighborhood. But the restaurant doesn’t just offer great food—it also boasts a stunning garden patio perfect for intimate weddings. The covered North Garden patio offers space for 34 guests, with a food and beverage minimum of $2,200. Couples can also opt for a smaller space, the East Garden, offering seating at a maximum of 26 with a food and beverage minimum of $1,200.\n\n10. Cafés\n\nHosting your wedding at a café may offer the perfect vibe for an intimate ceremony and reception. How? These venues are often decked out with lively décor, offering the chance to play off of it for your wedding theme. They can also range from coffee shops to small bistros with garden patios, presenting so many gorgeous options for a unique venue.\n\nSoho South Café\n\nLocated in Savannah, Georgia, Soho South Café is well-known for its Sunday brunch and gorgeous, unique event space. The building was built in 1945 and provides the perfect backdrop for a reception dinner or party on the dance floor. Couples can expect to budget for a $3,500 venue rental fee, with a $3,500 food and beverage minimum to apply to all of the space's delicious in-house food and drink.\n\nAnodyne Coffee\n\nAnodyne Coffee is a lovely café in Milwaukee offering a wedding venue option near the waterfront. The space is set in a rustic building that once served as a warehouse and features stunning exposed wooden beams and original brick. With plenty of warm ambiance in the space, it can also comfortably accommodate a crowd of 150 guests. As for fees, a Saturday wedding will cost about $2,800, which covers the ceremony and reception on-site, including tables and chairs, bartenders, and even a day-of coordinator.\n\n11. Theaters\n\nWant to announce your nuptials in style? The idea of getting married in a theater is absolutely timeless, incorporating elements from when you were teens. Best of all? It's totally affordable.\n\nGrand Canadian Theater\n\nIf you've always wanted to see your name light up on a marquee, The Grand Canadian Theater is definitely the venue for you. This unique gem in Purcell, Oklahoma boasts gorgeous architecture featuring a 1930s Hollywood glam vibe. All-day rental options start at $4,400 which gives you space for your ceremony, along with bar and lounge areas, tables and chairs, plenty of parking, and, of course, your new married name on the big marquee.\n\nStifel Theatre\n\nThe Stifel Theatre, located in St. Louis, is such a timeless, stunning option for a sophisticated wedding. The 3,100-seat theatre opened in 1934, and since its debut, performers such as Frank Sinatra and The Rolling Stones have graced the stage. Now, you can utilize this historic gem for your wedding, hosting your nuptials in the main theatre, or options for the grand lobby or ballroom instead. Rental fees range from $800 to $6,500 depending on your date and the space you choose, but your pricing will include tables and chairs, tableware, and an in-house event manager to help with your big day.\n\n12. Hotels\n\nHotels have always been popular wedding venue options, especially since you can host all of your wedding events in one place, with nearby sleeping accommodations. But to get the most bang for your buck, the trick is to find a boutique hotel with low venue rental pricing.\n\nLa Valencia\n\nLa Valencia is a stunning property located in La Jolla, California, offering the most beautiful Mediterranean-style décor without having to hop on a plane. Host your ceremony in El Jardin with a gorgeous oceanside backdrop, and move the party to Patio Sol and Solarium for your reception. Venue rental fees range from $1,000 to $2,500 with a variety of options for add-ons, including food and beverage menus from La Valencia's on-site chef.\n\nDella Terra Mountain Chateau\n\nIf you're looking to head to the mountains, Della Terra Mountain Chateau is the perfect option. Located right near Rocky Mountain National Park, this secluded Colorado gem is the ideal spot for a getaway wedding. Pricing ranges from $4,000 to $8,500 depending on your wedding date, which includes space to get ready before the ceremony. Choose from multiple backdrops for your ceremony and photos and add on mountain cabin rentals to complete the weekend.\n\nHotel Figueroa\n\nHotel Figueroa is one of the oldest hotels in Downtown Los Angeles, and with that comes plenty of gorgeous character. This architectural gem offers multiple spaces for a ceremony and reception, including the option for private outdoor space to dine alfresco at Rick's (with its unique black and white tiled floor and views of the L.A. skyline). Pricing begins at $149 per person, with plenty of flexibility, giving you a budget-friendly option if you're planning to host a more intimate wedding.\n\n13. Gardens and Greenhouses\n\nA huge array of stunning blooms, big glass windows, and brick-paved sidewalks? Yes, we're talking about an iconic garden-party wedding. Most cities operate some type of community garden or greenhouse, offering the perfect location for a romantic celebration. If considering this venue, however, be sure to confirm if the grounds stay open to the public during your rental, or if they close the gates. \"Public spaces typically have less expensive site fees,\" says Nichols. \"But the spaces may be required to stay open to the public; you may have short to limited set-up time for things like setting up chairs, and popular spaces book up far in advance.\"\n\nGarfield Park Conservatory\n\nGarfield Park Conservatory, located in Chicago, is the perfect way to escape to a tropical paradise without even hopping on a plane. This unique venue offers multiple greenhouse rooms, all with lush greenery and stunning, unique flowers. Couples can opt to rent specific areas of the conservatory, or rent all of the public spaces for $4,500.\n\nBrooklyn Botanic Garden\n\nWeddings hosted in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden are simply magical, but there’s one catch: Your wedding has to be held between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. However, with that comes a huge cost savings, offering a venue fee of only $600 for up to 50 people, with an additional $18 per person after that for up to 60 guests. Couples can choose from the rose garden, Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, or the water garden, depending on their preferred backdrop.\n\n14. Farms\n\nFor a rustic-style wedding, there's no better venue than an actual farm or ranch, complete with a stunning barn for a party. Often, these sites offer multiple options on the property for a gorgeous ceremony backdrop, along with plenty of space to roam for photos and room for a reception to follow, whether it's dinner on the lawn or a dance in the barn.\n\nAllenbrooke Farms\n\nWe can’t think of a better location for a stunning barn wedding than in Nashville, and Allenbrooke Farms is a gorgeous option. The venue is owned by two high school sweethearts, offering ceremony and reception options in the barn or on the lawn, with multiple suites to choose from for getting ready. Package pricing comes in under $7,000, with gorgeous rustic decorations, tables and chairs, and even lawn games included.\n\nMontesino Ranch\n\nLess than an hour outside of Austin, Texas, Montesino Ranch boasts 225 acres of stunning, expansive views. Couples can choose from a ceremony in the mountain view pavilion or find a unique spot on the grounds. The barn offers a gorgeous, rustic option for an indoor reception, but outside on the lawn is equally beautiful. Package prices range from $3,500 to $6,000, with the potential to include lodging as well.\n\n15. Historic Venues\n\nIf you're hoping to capture old-world charm throughout your wedding, then a historic venue will be your best bet. Just remember: There may be several rules to follow to preserve the age-old architecture.\n\nRhodes Hall\n\nDoes getting married in a castle sound totally unattainable? Think again! Atlanta’s Rhodes Hall is the perfect option, boasting a stunning fairytale vibe, all while fitting into your budget. Built in 1904, this incredible mansion is constructed entirely of granite, accompanied by Victorian design. Rental fees for the site range from $2,000 to $4,000 depending on the date, size, and length of the event, but wedding fees include complimentary time for your wedding photos, as well as rehearsal time.\n\nThe Ancient Spanish Monastery"
