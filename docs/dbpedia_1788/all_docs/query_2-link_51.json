The park’s waterfalls change moods with the weather and the seasons and can range from roaring plunges to delicate bridal-veil mists to gleaming frozen titans. Winter and spring visits reveal them at their best. The rugged splendor of Clifty Canyon offers exciting year-round hiking and scenery.\n\nClifty Creek’s stony bed is littered with fossil remnants telling of a long-vanished marine ecosystem that teemed with life that included ancient corals, ancestral squids, brachiopods, and more. Fossil collecting within Clifty Falls State Park is prohibited but nearby collecting locations are readily accessible.\n\nIn Historic Madison, tour the Lanier State Historic Site, the former mansion of frontier banker James F.D. Lanier, and enjoy the drive along the beautiful Ohio River. Plan a park visit during one of the community's special events, such as the July Regatta hydroplane boat race or the Madison Chautauqua Festival of Art in late September.\n\nPlease note: Brough’s Tunnel is closed for an indefinite period of time due to an early spring rockslide and the possibility of more large rocks falling near the entrance. The park is evaluating how to mitigate any future rockslides, with the intention of opening the tunnel in the future. Guests can enjoy the many other features of Clifty Falls State Park while creating memorable experiences safely.\n\nDuring the summer, pool hours may change because of weather and staffing. Please contact the property office for exact times before your visit.\n\nSubscribe to e-mail news from Clifty Falls State Park\n\nClifty Falls Interpretive Plan\n\nNote: For trail locations, view the property map under the MAPS tab.\n\nThe Friends of Clifty Falls State Park and Jefferson County Library partnered to create a StoryWalk® on the paved walking loop that begins at the trailhead of Trail 7 near Clifty Shelter.
