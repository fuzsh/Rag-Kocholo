It takes you to a majestic waterfall and then to clifftop overlooks offering vistas up and down the Columbia River Gorge. The state park is a favorite of tourists and families on summer weekends, but is relatively quiet at other times. The two trails here begin east of the parking area near the restrooms. One trail descends to Bridal Veil Creek and then rises to a viewpoint of two-tiered Bridal Veil Falls. You also have the option here to descend the creek and explore a little of the Bridal Veil Lumbering Company's mill site. The second trail is a paved universal access loop that passes along the rim of the basalt Bridal Veil Bluffs overlooking the Columbia River. Across the road from the parking area is the historic Bridal Veil Lodge, now a B & B, which was opened in 1927 as one of the official \"respites\" along the Scenic Highway.\n\nMake a right at the junction east of the parking lot, and hike through a wood of tall Douglas-firs. Drop down a gravel trail lined by a now deteriorating rock wall that has slipped away in places. Make two switchbacks, passing licorice fern-draped slopes to look down on Bridal Veil Creek. A set of concrete steps leads down to creek level (In winter, you can see rusting pipes from the old mill operation in the undergrowth). Cross a segmental arch footbridge, and go right at the junction. Ascend along the maple-shaded creek to reach steps leading up to a viewing platform. Bridal Veil Falls plunges under the Old Columbia River Gorge Highway's 1914 bridge and through a mossy basalt defile in two tiers, a drop of about 120 feet altogether. The creek ran near-dry for decades because the lumber mill below diverted the water. Now the mill is a memory, and Bridal Veil Falls has returned. A massive basalt boulder, detached long ago from somewhere above, lies in the creek below, testament to the dynamic nature of this landscape. The viewing platform itself has become something of a romantic destination (Note all the hearts carved into the woodwork).\n\nWhen you return to the footbridge, keep on the east side of the creek, which is buttressed by a wall that once bordered a mill race. A dike separates the creek from a man-made former pond. Pass around a gate above the pond, noting a decaying wood structure in the depression. This may have supported a log conveyor that led to the old sawmill or mill yard. You'll come to a blackberry-infested area of old foundations and paved expanses, now sometimes a dumping ground for those not inclined to pay for regular garbage service. Circle around to your left, passing into the blackberries, and come to the last remaining structure from the mill days, a corrugated iron shed now decorated with graffiti. According to a former resident of the company town, this was a covered cistern that contained water for fire emergencies. A paper mill was constructed here in the 1880s. Later, the the Bridal Veil Falls Lumbering Company's planing mill was built east of the creek. Higher up, in fact 1,500 feet higher up on Larch Mountain, was their Palmer Mill operation. The sawmill there rough cut the lumber, and then sent it down the creek valley in a flume that ended at the resaw building. At least one million board feet of timber was moved in this way. The operation shut down in 1937 after a destructive fire, and thereafter the remaining buildings were taken over by the Bridal Veil Lumber & Box Company, which manufactured wooden boxes for Kraft Cheese as well as ammunition boxes during World War II. The Box Company closed in 1960, and the town site was gradually abandoned. In 1991, the Trust for Public Lands purchased the acreage, but for years a petition to declare the area a historic site was pursued. After the petition was denied, the three remaining mill buildings - the resaw building, maintenance shop, and warehouse - were demolished in 2001. The town's church was torn down in 2011. The last building remaining on the property is the Bridal Veil Post Office near the freeway exit and said to be the second smallest post office in the United States. It was once a tool shed for the mill. The post office is kept busy applying their trademark cancellation to batches of wedding invitations.\n\nReturn to the junction near the restrooms, and go right for the short loop. The paved trail heads out from under the conifer canopy into a small field of camas, which blooms in mid-April. At the first viewpoint and picnic table, lilacs will be blooming in spring. The freeway and rail tracks are just below, while you can see east to Archer Mountain, Hamilton Mountain, and Beacon Rock. Across the river are the 400-foot palisades at Cape Horn, which stream with narrow waterfalls in the wet season. Phoca Rock, named by Lewis and Clark for the seals they saw in the vicinity, is offshore from Cape Horn. Then the trail loops west under oaks, cottonwoods, and maples to other fenced clifftop viewpoints over the river and past more camas meadows. Poison oak lines the trail in places. Pass a deep cleft in the cliff through which a small creek tumbles. A spur heads out to the last viewpoint, which looks west up the railroad tracks to the remaining Pillars of Hercules, Sand Island, and Crown Point. Return to the parking area through leafy woods. On your right, across a gully, you'll see a patch of forest scarred by the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire, the closest that conflagration got to these trails.\n\nMaps\n\nMaps: Hike Finder\n\nHistoric Columbia River Highway Map (Friends of Multnomah Falls)\n\nGreen Trails Maps: Bridal Veil, OR #428\n\nGreen Trails Maps: Columbia River Gorge - West #428S\n\nGeo-Graphics: Trails of the Columbia Gorge\n\nNational Geographic Trails Illustrated Map: Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area\n\nFees, Regulations, etc.\n\nDay-use only: 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.\n\nRestrooms, picnic tables, interpretive signs\n\nDogs on leash\n\nTrip Reports\n\nSearch Trip Reports for Bridal Veil Falls\n\nGoalTech hikes Bridal Veil Loop - Snow in the hills\n\nRelated Discussions / Q&A\n\nSearch Trail Q&A for Bridal Veil Falls\n\nGuidebooks that cover this hike\n\nDay Hikes in the Columbia Gorge by Don J.
