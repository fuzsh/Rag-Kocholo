        "text": "Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer, is set to become the interim leader of Bangladesh, overseeing a temporary government intended to help stabilize the South Asian nation after a month of political violence.\n\nMr. Yunus was named to the post on Tuesday, a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country. He was the choice of the student groups that led the popular uprising against her.\n\nOne of Bangladesh’s best-known citizens, Mr. Yunus was among those Ms. Hasina considered a political threat for years, her critics say. Now, those who ousted her have propelled Mr. Yunus, 84, into one of the most powerful positions in the new government.\n\nHere’s what to know about Mr. Yunus and his rise in Bangladesh:\n\nHe received the Nobel as a microfinance trailblazer."
