        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBangladesh Protests: Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been appointed to lead Bangladesh's interim government after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted. Yunus, noted for his microcredit model through Grameen Bank, has had a controversial history with Hasina. The appointment comes after deadly protests against Hasina's administration and demands from activists.\n\nBangladesh interim govt: Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been appointed as the head of Bangladesh's interim government by President Mohammed Shahabuddin. The decision, made during a meeting on August 6 night between President Shahabuddin and the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, aims to fill the leadership void created by the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The heads of Bangladesh's three armed forces were also present at the meeting.\n\nMuhammad Yunus, known as the \"banker to the poorest of the poor,\" is stepping into this role years after a significant fallout with Hasina. Yunus was removed from his position as head of Grameen Bank in 2011 by Hasina's government, which led to widespread public outrage. Thousands of Bangladeshis protested his removal by forming a human chain.\n\nNow, the banker who had a tiff with Sheikh Hasina, is the one who will fulfill the duties of the ousted PM of Bangladesh as the head of the interim government.\n\nWhy Muhammad Yunus?\n\nBefore Hasina fled on Monday, Bangladesh had been facing weeks of protests over a quota system that reserved some government jobs for the families of those who fought for the country’s independence in 1971. The protests and the police response turned deadly, with over 250 people killed in the clashes.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nBangladesh unrest: Muhammad Yunus, the 'Banker to the Poor,' poised to tame the chaos\n\nYunus, a notable critic of Hasina, was often at odds with her during the 21st century. Given the strong protests against Hasina, it makes sense that the activists would suggest one of her most prominent opponents as a solution.\n\nOn Tuesday, the main organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement strongly demanded that the interim government in Bangladesh appoint Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus as the chief advisor. They warned that any other government would not be accepted. Coordinator of the movement had said they would not accept a government led by the military or one with fascist elements.\n\nMuhammad Yunus' journey\n\nYunus's academic journey began in 1969 when he earned his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States as a Fulbright scholar. He then taught at Middle Tennessee State University before returning to Bangladesh in 1972, which had just gained independence. He joined the department of Economics at the University of Chittagong, the region where he was born in 1940. The Bangladesh famine of 1974 prompted Yunus to explore the microcredit model to assist impoverished Bangladeshis, particularly women.\n\nYunus's microcredit initiative took root in 1976 in Jobra village, Chittagong district. By 1983, the project had evolved into Grameen Bank. Unlike traditional banks, which require collateral for loans, Yunus championed providing small loans without such requirements. Grameen Bank now operates in 94% of Bangladesh's villages, reaching nearly 45 million people through its 10.6 million borrower members. According to the bank, 97% of its borrowers are women, and as of June 2024, it had disbursed loans worth $38 billion, maintaining a recovery rate of 96.3%. In 2006, both Yunus and the bank received the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead interim government in Bangladesh\n\nChallenges that Muhammad Yunus faced\n\nHowever, Yunus faced significant challenges after his rise to global prominence. In 2007, amid a caretaker military government in Bangladesh, he was associated with a potential new political party. During this period, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and other political leaders were either under house arrest or incarcerated.\n\n“So, people kept coming to me, that you should join politics... And they put pressure and ﬁnally I said ‘okay, I’ll join politics and I’ll create a party’... Within two months I announced that ‘no I’m not going to create a party’. That’s all — I never created a party,” Yunus told The New York Times in 2012. But he believes Hasina misread his intentions. Asked about his equation with Hasina, he told NYT, “She never explained so I don’t understand what went on, just speculation in the press. One is that she feels I’m a political threat... This is again speculation. She never said that I’m a political threat... We’ve never had a face-to-face meeting, although I’ve tried to seek her appointment so I could see her, but it never happened.”\n\nSheikh Hasina vs Muhammad Yunus\n\nIn 2011, Hasina's government announced Yunus's removal from Grameen Bank's managing director post. She accused the bank of “sucking blood of the poor” and claimed Yunus treated the institution as his “personal property.”\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nBangladesh Parliament dissolved day after Sheikh Hasina fled to India\n\n“They removed me and still they couldn’t ﬁnd a replacement... after all this bank is owned by poor people. The borrowers own 97% of the bank and the government owns only 3%,” he had told NYT.\n\nYunus faced further legal challenges. In 2013, he was tried for violating foreign currency rules. He was also prosecuted in relation to the companies he founded.\n\nEarlier this year, in January, Yunus was sentenced to six months in jail for violating labor laws, although he was released on bail in March. His legal battles continue, with his lawyers stating he faces over 100 additional charges related to labor law violations and alleged corruption.\n\nDespite these issues, Yunus's reputation remains largely intact both domestically and internationally. Last August, more than 170 global figures, including former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, signed a petition urging Hasina to cease what they described as the “persecution” of Yunus.\n\n(With inputs from ToI)\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n10 stocks that can defy the yen upheaval, as Sensex comes out of Dow shadow\n\nThree reasons why Mumbai, NCR beat Bengaluru in the IPO treasure hunt\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nIs the great Indian snacking boom slowing down finally?\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nAnalysing Hindenburg’s three key allegations against Sebi’s Madhabi Buch\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
