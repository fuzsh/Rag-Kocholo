        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Muhammad\n\nMuhammad is an Arabic masculine name with a rich past. The name means ‘praised one’ or ‘praiseworthy.’ This Muslim name is derived from the Arabic word ‘hamid,’ which means praise. Al Hamid or ‘the All-Laudable’ is a trait of God or Allah that gives rise to the name Abd al-Hamid. This Arabic term itself has an intense past. It comes from the triconsonantal Semitic root H-M-D.\n\nMuhammad is mentioned many times in the holy book of Islam, the Quran. It is almost always associated with the final prophet in Islam, Prophet Muhammad. As per Islamic belief, when Muhammad was 40 years old, he was visited by Gabriel, an archangel in the Hebrew tradition. The angel is regarded as a messenger of God. Gabriel provided Muhammad with the first verses of the Quran. The verses and revelations laid the foundation of Islam, founded by the prophet.\n\nMuhammad was renowned for his intelligence, empathy, and leadership. As a result, people in his community and beyond respected him immensely. As a result, with the spread of Islam, the popularity of Muhammad’s name also increased.\n\nAfter that, the name was borne by many Abbasid caliphs and six sultans of the Ottoman Empire. A notable name bearer is Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, the 9th-century Persian mathematician who founded algebra.\n\nDue to its underlying significance, the name has been shortened to Md., Mohd., Muhd., Mhd., and M. However, the name also has many variations. In Arabic, it is spelled as Mahomet, Mahometus, Mohamad, Mohamed, Mihammad, Mohammad, Muhammed, and Mohammed. In Turkish, it is Mehmet, Muhammed, and Muhammet, while in Azerbaijani, it is Məhəmməd, Mahammad, Mammad, and Məmməd.\n\nDespite being a culturally significant name, we don’t find many mentions of this name in popular culture. Muhammad Avdol from Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is one example. However, one of the most notable mentions is the movie ‘Muhammad: The Messenger of God,’ which was released in 2015 in Iran. It is an Islamic epic directed by the famous Iranian film director Majid Majidi and co-written with Kambuzia Partovi. The story takes place in the sixth century and focuses on the early years of the prophet Muhammad, depicting his childhood and upbringing.\n\nHow To Pronounce Muhammad?\n\n‘Muhammad’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Muhammad\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Muhammad famous with their contributions in various fields.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nZodiac sign or Sun sign\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year.
