He strives, he asserts, for a world of three zeros: zero poverty, zero unemployment and zero net carbon emissions.\n\nBangladesh descended into chaos on Monday as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina surreptitiously resigned and fled the country in a military aircraft while the Army stepped in to fill the power vacuum.\n\nProduction: Yuvasree S"
