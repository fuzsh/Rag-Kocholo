The army has temporarily taken control, but it is unclear what its role would be in an interim government after the president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday to pave the way for elections.\n\nStudent leaders who organized the protests want Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics as an adviser to its organizers, to lead an interim government.\n\nHe could not immediately be reached for comment, but key student leader Nahid Islam asserted that Yunus agreed to step in during a discussion with them.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nViolence in Bangladesh leaves dozens dead, hundreds injured\n\nBoy ends up 4,000 km away after playing in shipping container\n\nYunus, 83, is a well-known critic and political opponent of Hasina. He called her resignation the country’s “second liberation day.” She once called him a “bloodsucker.”\n\nAn economist and banker by profession, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the use of microcredit to help impoverished people, particularly women. The Nobel Peace Prize committee credited Yunus and his Grameen Bank “for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nYunus founded Grameen Bank in 1983 to provide small loans to entrepreneurs who would not normally qualify to receive them. The bank’s success in lifting people out of poverty led to similar microfinancing efforts in other countries.\n\nYunus ran into trouble with Hasina in 2008 when her administration launched a series of investigations into him. Yunus had announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government, although he did not follow through.\n\nDuring the investigations, Hasina accused Yunus of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank. Yunus denied the allegations.\n\nHasina’s government began reviewing the bank’s activities in 2011, and Yunus was fired as managing director for allegedly violating government retirement regulations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize and royalties from a book.\n\nHe later faced more charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country’s largest mobile phone company, GrameenPhone, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor. In 2023, some former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. He denied the accusations.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nEarlier this year, a special judge’s court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over the $2-million embezzlement case. Yunus pleaded not guilty and is out on bail for now.\n\nYunus’ supporters say he has been targeted because of his frosty relations with Hasina.\n\nYunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, a seaport city in Bangladesh. He received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, Yunus said he had a “eureka movement” to establish Grameen Bank when he met a poor woman weaving bamboo stools who was struggling pay her debts.\n\n“I couldn’t understand how she could be so poor when she was making such beautiful things,” he recalled in the interview.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
