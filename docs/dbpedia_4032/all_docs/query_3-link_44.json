        "text": "Yunus: What does the surname Yunus mean?\n\nYunus is a common last name among people of South Asian descent and is derived from the Hebrew name, Jonah. It usually refers to a person with the qualities of “dove-like” attributes such as peace, and containment. It’s believed to be derived from the Arabic or Farsi-speaking world and likely originated in the Middle East.\n\nThe literal translation of the name Yunus is ‘dove’ or 'bird' - referring to the purity and peace. It’s a popular name among Malays, Javanese, and Sumatrans of the Indonesian archipelago, as well as Hindus and other groups of South Asian descent.\n\nThe name Yunus is also tied to Islam, as Prophet Yunus (Jonah) of the Old Testament is referenced often in the Quran. In the scriptures and folklore, Jonah is known for his patience, intelligence, wisdom and compassion, which are also qualities associated with those bearing the name Yunus.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, there are certain communities who have inherited the given name of Yunus from parent to child for generations. Such people may be known as Yunus Khan or Yunus Shaikh, and commonly hail from parts of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.\n\nYunus is closely associated with terms such as “wise”, “patient”, “tolerant”, and “forgiving,” and is a popular choice for a name of any kind. In the Islamic religion, Prophet Jonah is held as a messenger of God, and thus veneration for this figure is widespread amongst Muslim communities.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nYunus: Where does the name Yunus come from?\n\nThe last name Yunus is commonly found in Central and South Asia, particularly in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Iran, and Pakistan. It is also known as Yunes, Yonus, Younus, Yunas, and Yunusi.\n\nThe surname is associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad and is derived from the Arab word for a dove. It is believed that Yunus was an ancestor of Muhammad, who was mentioned specifically in Muslim sources.\n\nThe decedents of Muhammad are called descendants of Yahya. This family then took on the surname from the word 'Yunus', and it has been passed down the generations ever since.\n\nYunus is a respected and privileged name in some countries, including Bangladesh. The Yunus family traditionally held land ownership in some of the most important areas of the country and wielded considerable political and social power.\n\nYunus families that have travelled to the United Kingdom and the United States over the last few decades have adopted the English surname \"Jones\" as an adaptation of the Yunus name. Jones is the seventh most common surname in the United Kingdom, and Yunus is the eighteenth most common in Bangladesh.\n\nYunus remains a respected surname throughout Central and South Asia, and its modern-day descendants still bear the mark of their prestigious heritage.\n\nVariations of the surname Yunus\n\nThe surname Yunus is of Arabic origin, with several variants, spellings and related surnames. The most common of these is Yunus, which is often spelled Yonus or Yoonus. Related surnames include Yunez, Yunes, Yunis and Yunusovich.\n\nThe Yunez spelling is a more modernized rendering of the name, and is sometimes interchangeably used with Yonus and Yunus. Yunes and Yunis are also variants of the name, which can be used in both the singular and plural if there are multiple members of the family that share the name.\n\nThe Yunusovich surname is a patronymic form of the name, denoting a son or descendant of Yunus. This spelling is typically seen among southern Slavic populations such as Bulgarians, Serbians, Croatians and Montenegrins, although it is not limited to them.\n\nIn addition to these various spellings of the surname, the root of Yunus is still in use among other Arabic surnames. These include Anis, Eliyunus, Elianus, Ibn Aunis, Ibn Yunus, Yunesi, Yonis and Yussuf.\n\nOverall, the surname Yunus has many forms and variations, and is found among regions and populations across the Middle East and further afield. While the origin of the name is Arabic, centuries of immigration have helped to spread it across different countries and cultures in Europe, Africa and parts of the Americas.\n\nFamous people with the name Yunus\n\nMuhammad Yunus: He is a Bangladeshi economist, banker and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.
