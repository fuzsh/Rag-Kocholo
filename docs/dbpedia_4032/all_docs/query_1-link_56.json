        "text": "The secretive commander behind Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel may have been killed in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nIsrael said Mohammed Deif and a second Hamas commander, Rafa Salama, were the targets of the strike, which the Hamas-run health ministry said killed dozens.\n\nIsrael said it was still verifying the results of the strike.\n\nBut who is Deif, the commander of the militant group's military wing who is known as \"The Guest\", or sometimes \"the cat with nine lives\"?\n\nThe first nickname is taken from his nom de guerre - Deif means guest in Arabic - referencing his habit of staying with different sympathisers each night to avoid detection.\n\nThe second is a reference to his knack for evading Israeli assassination attempts.\n\nA rare public appearance\n\nIn the hours after Hamas's surprise attack on Israel, Deif appeared in a recorded video message announcing the beginning of what he called \"Operation Al Aqsa Storm\".\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he said in the message, as he called on Palestinians to join the fight.\n\nHe said the incursion was in response to the 16-year blockade of Gaza, Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, violence at Al Aqsa - the disputed Jerusalem holy site - increasing attacks by settlers on Palestinians and the growth of settlements.\n\n\"We've decided to put an end to all this,\" he said.\n\nHamas's elusive military commander\n\nDeif joined Hamas around 1990 and learnt the skill of bombmaking under Yehya Ayyash, a renowned bombmaker known as \"the engineer\".\n\nHe was accused of masterminding a slew of suicide bombings from 1995 onwards and was held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nHe was also credited with being the architect of a sophisticated network of tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip and designing the Qassam rocket.\n\nA Hamas source, who has known Deif since the 1990s, told Reuters Deif has been at the heart of developments inside the armed wing since 1994.\n\nIn 2002, he became head of the Qassam Brigades - the military offshoot of Hamas - after Israel assassinated its former leader.\n\nDeif's low profile is the reason for his success, according to a former senior Hamas leader who spoke to the Washington Post in 2014.\n\nThere are hardly any photos of Deif in the public domain, testament to his secretive nature.\n\n\"He keeps a low profile and lives hidden among the population. He moves with different passports and different identities,\" Imad Falouji said.\n\n\"He's successful until now because the circle around him is very small. That is why he is still alive.\"\n\nFalouji told the newspaper Deif was perceived by Palestinians as down-to-earth and his hard-line attitude towards Israel was seen as an accurate reflection of the interests of Palestinians.\n\n'The cat with nine lives'\n\nDeif has been Israel's most-wanted man since 1995 and has survived multiple attempts on his life.\n\nBut he did not escape unscathed. He is partially paralysed and reportedly uses a wheelchair.\n\nHe also reportedly lost an eye and an arm in one of the attacks.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nZelenskyy reacts to Biden's 'President Putin' gaffe\n\nMinister swims in Paris river amid safety fears ahead of Olympics\n\nAn Israeli airstrike targeted at Deif in 2014 left his wife and two children dead.\n\nDeif is listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the US Department of State.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nEarly life\n\nHe was born Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al Masri in the Khan Younis refugee camp in the 1960s. Little is known about his upbringing.\n\nHe went on to study science at the Islamic University of Gaza, where he was part of a theatre group called The Returnees.\n\nDeif kept up acting after joining Hamas, sometimes playing parts in propaganda videos, Avi Melamed, a Middle East expert at the Eisenhower Institute, told the Washington Post.\n\nBreaking his silence\n\nThe last time his voice was heard was in 2021, when he warned Israel would pay a \"heavy price\" if it did not meet Hamas's demands over Jerusalem.\n\nIn the 11 days of conflict that followed, at least 250 people were killed in Gaza, and 13 in Israel.\n\nBefore that, he had not been heard from for seven years."
