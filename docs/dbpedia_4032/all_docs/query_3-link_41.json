It is derived from the Arabic given name Yunus, which means \"Jonah\" in English. The name Yunus itself is of significant historical and religious importance, as the Prophet Yunus (Jonah) is a well-known figure in Islamic tradition, revered for his story of repentance and forgiveness, which is also shared with Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe surname Younis can be traced back to medieval Islamic society, with records indicating its usage during the Islamic Golden Age, which spanned from the 8th to the 14th centuries. Historical manuscripts and texts from this period often include references to individuals bearing the name, particularly scholars, merchants, and artisans who were integral to the cultural and scientific advancements of the time.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded instances of the surname Younis can be found in the archives of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and Syria, dating back to the 13th century. Notable among these records is a merchant named Ahmad Younis, who was known for his extensive trade networks stretching from North Africa to the Levant. His contributions to the economic development of the region during the late 1200s are still recognized by historians.\n\nIn the 16th century, during the Ottoman Empire's reign over much of the Middle East, the name Younis continued to be prominent. A well-documented figure from this period is Ali Younis, a scholar and poet born in 1553 who made significant contributions to Arabic literature. His works reflect the rich cultural fabric of the Ottoman period and remain studied in literary circles today.\n\nThe name Younis also appears in historical records of the Abbasid Caliphate, particularly in the field of science. In the 9th century, a mathematician named Khalid Younis was known for his contributions to the development of algebra. His works were instrumental in the spread of mathematical knowledge throughout the Islamic world and later into Europe.\n\nDuring the 20th century, individuals with the surname Younis made significant contributions to various fields, reflecting the widespread diaspora of Arabic-speaking peoples. One notable figure is Dr. Mona Younis, a pioneering medical researcher born in 1918 who made groundbreaking strides in epidemiology and public health. Her research has had a lasting impact on global health policies.\n\nFinally, historical records from the British colonial period in Palestine document the name Younis in various public and civic roles. For example, Muhammad Younis, born in 1895, served as a prominent community leader and advocate for Palestinian rights during the tumultuous mid-20th century, particularly during the years leading up to and following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.\n\nThrough these historical glimpses, the surname Younis reveals a rich tapestry of contributions across diverse fields and geographies, reflecting the enduring legacy of this storied name.\n\nRace and ethnic origin of people with the last name Younis\n\nWe also have some data on the ancestry of people with the surname Younis.\n\nThe below race categories are the modified race categories used in the Census Bureau's population estimates program.
