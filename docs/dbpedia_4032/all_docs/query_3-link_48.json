        "text": "Many entrepreneurs have chosen to accumulate wealth in the private sector and become philanthropists later in life. Now, however, a growing number of entrepreneurs are working to solve social issues using their businesses.\n\nGlobally, a new business model has emerged that meshes businesses with government and social organizations. Nonprofits and for-profit businesses can team up to form a hybrid business model, led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs. These leaders successfully tackle social issues while generating profit for shareholders.\n\nWidespread use of ethical practices such as impact investing, conscious consumerism, and corporate social responsibility programs facilitated the success of the following 10 social entrepreneurs.\n\n1. Bill Drayton\n\nBill Drayton is recognized as one of the pioneering social entrepreneurs of our time.\n\nDrayton founded Ashoka in 1980. The company \"envisions a world in which everyone is a changemaker.\" It takes a multifaceted approach to finding and supporting social entrepreneurs globally. Its three priorities are:\n\nSocial entrepreneurship: Selecting promising \"Ashoka Fellows\" around the world and providing them with the knowledge, finances, and logistical means to effect change.\n\nEmpathy and young changemaking: Helping and inspiring the young along their journey to become changemakers.\n\nOrganizing for changemaking: Partnering with businesses, schools, and business advisors to recast the standard business model so that it better engages people, nurtures potential, and creates opportunities to tackle problems.\n\nDrayton also serves as chair of the board for Get America Working!, Youth Venture, and Community Greens.\n\n2. Rachel Brathen\n\n\"Yoga Girl\" is the name of Rachel Brathen’s New York Times best-selling book and her handle on social media, where she has over two million followers.\n\nIn addition to introducing viewers to life-changing practices for personal growth and community connections, Rachel hopes to connect teachers with people in the online community who need healing. She seeks to improve the lives of many by helping her followers find beauty in their own.\n\n“What if social media could become a social mission?” asks Brathen. She runs two non-profits, Sgt. Pepper’s Friends, which is an animal rescue organization in Aruba, and Yoga Girl® Foundation, which provides for women and children in need.\n\nHer online channel oneoeight.tv, which offered health, yoga, and meditation services, was transformed into her website and the company of which she is CEO. From there, she inspires yoga practitioners and many others across the globe to find balance, promote their inner healing, live life mindfully, and give back to their communities.\n\n3. Shiza Shahid\n\nAs co-founder and global ambassador of the Malala Fund, Shiza Shahid manages business operations for Malala Yousafzai, the teenager who became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.\n\nLike Malala, Shahid was born in Pakistan. She initially reached out to Malala in 2009 and worked to organize a camp for her and other Pakistani girls. In 2012, Shiza flew to Malala's bedside after she was targeted and shot by the Taliban for promoting education for girls.\n\nInspired by Malala's desire to continue campaigning for gender equality and education, Shahid decided to help Malala strategize her campaign. Shahid created the Malala Fund, which helps empower women and girls by advocating and spreading access to education.\n\n4. Blake Mycoskie\n\nAfter a trip to Argentina in 2006, Blake Mycoskie became the founder and chief shoe giver of TOMS Shoes, using some of his own money to launch the company.\n\nOriginally, TOMS pledged to donate one pair of shoes for every pair sold. It expanded this One-For-One campaign to support water, sight, birth, and anti-bullying initiatives. Using the TOMS brand, Mycoskie has raised awareness about issues such as global poverty and health.\n\nThe company donated $10,000 to each of 10 nonprofit organizations in 10 different countries. The money was used to provide mental health services to those in need. And as of 2020, TOMS had given away 100 million pairs of shoes.\n\nToday, TOMS' expanded \"Impact Model\" calls for it to give away a third of the company's profits for \"grassroots good.\" That means its money goes to cash grants and partnerships with nonprofits \"working to create impact in three areas: mental health, access to opportunity and ending gun violence.\"\n\nIn 2023, TOMS funded 39 organizations in 17 communities located in 11 countries around the world.\n\n5. Scott Harrison\n\nScott Harrison left a life of luxury in New York City and headed for the shores of West Africa to volunteer with a hospital ship charity named Mercy Ships.\n\nThe trip was a watershed moment, and in 2006 Harrison founded charity: water, a nonprofit with the goal of providing clean water to every human being on the planet who needed it.\n\nAs of 2022, it had provided safe and potable drinking water in 29 countries around the world. It had raised more than $750 million and fulfilled 152,000 water projects.\n\n6. Muhammad Yunus\n\nProfessor Muhammad Yunus is renowned for the popularization of microfinance and microcredit, which serve as the cornerstones of the Grameen Bank, founded in 1983.\n\nIn 2006, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Prize for creating the Grameen Bank, which is based on the principles of trust and solidarity to empower villagers with the funding to pull themselves out of poverty.\n\nAccording to the Grameen Bank, as of May 2022, 90% of its about nine million borrowers are women, who pay their loans back at a rate of 97%—a recovery rate higher than any traditional banking system.\n\nThis renowned professor has received international awards such as the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010, and the Olympic Laurel in 2021.\n\n7. Jeffrey Hollender\n\nJeffrey Hollender is well known as the former chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of Seventh Generation, a popular business offering natural products.\n\nHe is now a leading consultant, speaker, and activist for corporate social responsibility. He has written seven books including “How to Make the World a Better Place.”\n\nHollender is also co-founder and CEO of Hollender Sustainable Brands, which sells sustainable products for sexual and personal health, such as condoms, tampons, lubricants, and pads, among other things.\n\nHollender is an adjunct professor at New York University and co-founder and board chair of the American Sustainable Business Council. He is a board member of various other organizations, including Greenpeace USA, Health Care Without Harm, and workers' rights organization Verité.\n\n8. Xavier Helgesen, Christopher \"Kreece\" Fuchs, and Jeff Kurtzman\n\nThese three co-founders of Better World Books—a B-Corp online bookstore that funds global literacy—all deserve recognition as successful social entrepreneurs. The founders met at Notre Dame University, where they tutored the football team and started collecting unwanted books to sell on the internet.\n\nHelgesen is the co-founder of Off Grid Electric, which provides renewable energy to homes in the off-grid world.\n\nFuchs went on to become the Chief Operating Officer at Trek10, a company that helps clients use Amazon Web Services.\n\nKurtzman previously held the CEO position at Aid Through Trade, a company that distributes handmade accessories from Nepal to the U.S. He was responsible for a 125% growth in sales. He also co-founded the nonprofit Operation Incubation, which delivers low-cost, low-maintenance incubators to the developing world.\n\n9. Marc Koska\n\nMarc Koska re-designed medical tools and introduced a non-reusable, inexpensive syringe that can be used in underfunded clinics. This innovation safeguards against the transmission of blood-borne diseases.\n\nKoska founded the SafePoint Trust in 2006, which delivered four billion safe injections in 40 countries via his auto-disable syringes.\n\nThe Schwab Foundation Social Entrepreneurs of the Year in 2015 cited Koska for his pioneering solution to a world health issue. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global policy on safe injections in February 2015.\n\n10. Sanjit \"Bunker\" Roy\n\nSanjit “Bunker” Roy had a privileged upbringing in India. When Roy visited some of his country's rural villages, he had a life-altering experience and decided to find a way to improve the socioeconomic inequities in his country.\n\nHe founded Barefoot College in 1972, a grassroots-organized, solar-powered college for the poor with the mission of helping rural communities obtain basic services and solutions and become self-sufficient and sustainable. Roy describes Barefoot College as “the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher.\"\n\nIn 2017, Princeton University awarded Roy with a doctor of law degree, citing his activism and ingenuity as the force for so many vital benefits to India’s poorest communities. These included innovation, prosperity, security, empowerment, self-sufficiency and hope.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
