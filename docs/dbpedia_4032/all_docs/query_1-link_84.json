        "text": "Whole Foods CEO finds a higher calling on the Appalachian Trailand predicts that travel will be transformed\n\nLast Business Trip: An animal-welfare conference in Turin, followed by a tour of stores in London, New York, Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and northern California.\n\nLast Personal Trip:_ Hiking the Appalachian Trail using the nickname Strider, from Lord of the Rings. You see life differently when you're out in the wild._\n\nFavorite Trip:_ Scuba diving off Bali and the other islands of Indonesia. There's incredible cultural diversity and some of the most unusual marine life I've seen anywhere._\n\nDream Trip:_ Africa, from safaris in the south to the Muslim communities in the north. Why? Because I've never been._\n\n**You've been hiking the Appalachian Trail again. What calls you back? **\n\nI slow down when hiking. The rhythm of nature is more leisurely. The sun comes up, it moves across the sky, and you begin to synchronize to that rhythm. In general, when you travel, you get into a different reality and are able to more accurately reflect on your ordinary life. Hiking does that for me.\n\n**Do you find inspiration on the trail? You're a proponent of what you call conscious capitalism, which sounds almost spiritual. . . . **\n\nOf course I get inspiration while hiking, but that's not why I do it. Conscious capitalism is founded on the principle that business should have a deeper purposeand making money is not it. You need to produce red blood cells to live, but the purpose of your life isn't to produce red blood cells.\n\n**So conscious businesses should worry about more than just investor value? **\n\nThey have a variety of stakeholdersinvestors, customers, team members, suppliers, the community, and the environment. A conscious business has to provide value to all of those stakeholders.\n\n**Do travel companies have those same stakeholders? **\n\nYes, and the travel industry can embrace this model easily because it is in the service sector. Some of the greatest businesses operating from a deeper purpose have a real commitment to servicelike Four Seasons, Joie de Vivre hotels, Southwest Airlines, and JetBlue.\n\n**Are we reaching a tipping point where travelers base decisions on whether travel companies are following conscious capitalism? **\n\nWe are already seeing it happen. Baby boomers moving past middle age are starting to cry out for deeper levels of fulfillment. I think travel will be transformed in the next 25 years. Companies are going to appeal to people's deeper needs. There will be more special-theme travel, like golf tours and cooking schools. There's been lots of interest in our Whole Planet programI could see people developing tours around that.\n\n**The Whole Planet Foundation works with Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, to give loans to the poor in communities that supply your stores. What would travelers see if they visited those projects? **\n\nTouring our microcredit programs in Guatemala really broadened my perspective. What struck me was the women's pride in their growing businesses. They all want to improve their lives. Every one of them wanted to talk about what they plan to do with their next loan. The program aligns with my belief in giving a helping hand up rather than a handout. The funniest thing was when somebody asked the women how the husbands feel about their wives' businesses. \"We are training our husbands,\" one said, and they all started laughing.\n\n**You also promote Fair Trade certification. Why? **\n\nAs we outsource industries to the developing world, there are fewer regulations to protect workers, consumers, and animals from the dark side of industrialization. Systems like Fair Trade are not a complete answer, but they ensure that products from the developing world are more sustainable and are not based on exploitation.\n\n**As you travel, how do you see food culture changing? **\n\nWe're in a fusion era. Latin America meets Thailand, throw in some Italian pastathere are amazing things you can do mixing cuisines. The world is getting more connected through technology and travel. Cuisines are evolving. Some people are scared of globalization, but I think people will always take pride in cultural heritage. It's a bold new world of integration, not homogenization.\n\n**Did becoming a vegan change the way you travel? **\n\nMost of the great cuisines on this planet are primarily plant based, so it's really not an issue. In London, for example, you can easily find vegan restaurants. I love a place called Simply Authentic Food.\n\n**What's the next thing in food? **\n\nWe've had a nice long foodie run for at least a decade. Now we will be launching healthy-eating initiativesfood as health, food as vitality. The economy is in recession, people are becoming more frugal. Indulgence is becoming less popular."
