        "text": "Intriguing Small-Scale Devices and Phenomena Based on Nonlinear DynamicsView Abstract Keynote Lectures 2024/07/25 09:30:00 UTC - 2024/07/25 10:30:00 UTC\n\nExploring the dynamics of microstructures is an evolving field, which has inspired substantial research in the past couple of decades. This is due to the richness, multi-physics nature, and complexity of micromachined systems, which have revealed intriguing phenomena of practical and fundamental importance. Micro and nano scale devices are considered ideal platforms to probe fundamental phenomena in well-controlled environments, which have helped shedding the light on several key dynamical concepts observed in other systems at the large scale. Also, miniature structures and devices have captured the attention of the scientific community for several decades for their unprecedented attractive features. Today, several micro-electro-mechanical systems MEMS devices are being used in our everyday life, ranging from accelerometers and pressure sensors in automobiles, radio-frequency (RF) switches and microphones in cell phones, and inertia sensors in video games. Due to the quest to boost sensitivity, reduce power consumption, and increase integration density, the past two decades have witnessed the emergence of Nano-electro-mechanical systems NEMS. With the increasing demand to embed more intelligence into various applications, MEMS and NEMS continue to play key role on advancing innovation. In this talk, we demonstrate that by developing a proper understanding and deep insight into the dynamics and nonlinear mechanics phenomena at the micro and nano scale, new technological solutions and innovative ideas can be realized leading to new generations of superior devices."
