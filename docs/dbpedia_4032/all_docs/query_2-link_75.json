At the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 Professor Yunus was conferred with the Olympic Laurel award for his extensive work in sports for development, bringing the concept of social business to the sports world.\n\nIn 2006, Professor Yunus and Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nProfessor Muhammad Yunus holds a Ph.D in Economics from Vanderbilt University (U.S) and is the recipient of 63 honorary degrees from universities across 26 countries.
