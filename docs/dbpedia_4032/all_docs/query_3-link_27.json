        "text": "Oliver held its position as the most popular boys' name since 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nA number of readers asked whether adding together all of the different spellings of Muhammad would mean more babies were given that name than Oliver.\n\nMuhammad, the most common spelling given to babies born in 2017, was the 10th most popular name for boys overall.\n\nOliver topped the 2017 list with 6,259 babies while Muhammad was registered 3,691 times - not including hyphenated names, such as Muhammad-Ali.\n\nIf we combine 14 different spellings included in the data we get 7,307 boys, which is more than 1,000 ahead of Oliver.\n\nVariations included Muhammad, Mohammed, Mohammad, Muhammed, Mohamed, Mohamad, Muhamad, Muhamed, Mohamud, Mohummad, Mohummed, Mouhamed, Mohammod and Mouhamad.\n\nHowever the ONS treats each spelling of a name separately and ranks them according to the number of times that individual spelling appears on birth certificates.\n\n\"Combining spellings of one particular name distorts the list - for example combining Sophie, Sophia and Sofia on the 2015 girls list would knock Amelia off the top spot,\" the ONS said in 2016., external\n\nStatisticians say combining names which have a similar spelling would require individuals to make a \"subjective decision\" about whether certain names are distinctive or not.\n\nFor example, they would have to decide whether or not to treat Sara and Sarah as variations of the same name, even though many people would pronounce them differently.\n\nDoris was one of the top 10 most popular names between 1904 and 1944. The name came in at number three in 1904 and 1914, and dropped to seventh most popular in 1924 and 33rd in 1934.\n\nFrom there it plummeted to the 99th most popular name, before dropping out of the top 100 entirely.\n\nThere were just 10 baby girls called Doris in 2017, ranking the name 2,502 out of 7,508 names for girls in 2017."
