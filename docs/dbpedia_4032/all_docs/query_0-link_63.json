The two assailants had been hiding in a nearby field when they opened fire on Younis and subsequently fled the scene.Jhang District Police ordered an immediate investigation into the incident and are still looking for the attackers.\n\nIn a separate incident, Rawalpindi police registered a case against journalist Waqar Satti for falsely attributing “disrespectful” quotes about Islam to former Prime Minister Imran Khan in a Twitter post on August 24.The case was registered after a complaint by Chaudhry Nasir Qayyum, a cable operator, who alleged the journalist’s online comments would incite religious hatred. Police are investigating whether the comments made by Satti and if they violate Pakistan’s Penal Code.\n\nAccording to the IFJ’s South Asia Press Freedom Report 2021-2022, journalists and media workers in Pakistan have faced numerous threats to their safety and security, including physical attacks, arrests, abductions and several instances of coordinated or violent online harassment and intimidation.\n\nIn recent weeks, a spate of media rights violations has swept Pakistan, with the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) banning live speeches from former Prime Minister Imran Khan on August 21, and blocking the transmission of pro-Khan news organisations including ARY News and BOL News. Pakistani state authorities also detained journalists Ilyas Samoo and Jameel Farooqui, who were allegedly targeted for critical reportage of the ruling government."
