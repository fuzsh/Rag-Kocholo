        "text": "Muhammad Younis Khan is working as Assistant Professor in Applied Geophysics at Assistant Professor at the National Centre of Excellence in Geology, University of Peshawar, Pakistan.\n\nHe was awarded a PhD in Geophysics at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. His research focuses on the application of geophysical methods for the characterization of geotechnical, environmental, hydro- and geological processes. Dr. Khan's uses several geophysical methods (e.g. borehole data, TEM, ERT, and GPR) in his work to study mineral resources, groundwater, and geohazards (landslides and liquefaction-induced deformation). He is the author of a book chapter, several professional field reports and more than 30 research papers in peer-reviewed journals including Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics, Geophysics, Applied Geophysics and Pure and Applied Geophysics."
