        "text": "Microfinance began as a radical experiment, the brainchild of Bangladeshi economist Mohammed Yunus. In 1976, while teaching at Chittagong University, he surveyed the nearby slum community of Jobra for opportunities to help the disadvantaged. Over the course of his trips, Yunus drew unexpected insights that would compel him to open up Grameen Bank, the first microfinance institution (MFI).\n\nBefore the Grameen Bank came into existence, low-income villagers in Jobra had no opportunity to obtain credit. First of all, they had no means of physically reaching a conventional bank. Even if they did have affordable transportation, banks would never make loans to people without assets or a credit history. The only alternative available to the Jobra villagers was to use local moneylenders, who would charge exorbitant interest rates.\n\nYunus was driven by the conviction that the poor were not fundamentally unworthy of credit. The people he knew in Jobra managed their households responsibly. Yunus reasoned that the poor were lacking in resources but not in trustworthiness or financial sensibility. He believed they would be able and inclined to honor loans, if only given a reasonable interest rate. This belief lay at the heart of the Grameen Bank’s business model.\n\nAn important part of the Grameen Bank’s revolutionary model has become known as “solidarity group lending.” Yunus pioneered this innovative concept. He recognized that dividing a loan among several recipients could reduce transaction costs. Additionally, collective lending served as a near guarantee that loans would be repaid on time. Not only were group members enabled to cover, if need be, for each other’s installments, they would all be penalized if any one of them defaulted. The resulting social pressures acted as a check against free-riding and delinquency.\n\nThis joint distribution method was essentially limited to women, a stipulation created by Yunus. He felt that women were more reliable, typically, at fulfilling their payment obligations and cooperating with their peers. Besides sensing that women would overwhelmingly invest in their families’ wellbeing, Yunus recognized that they faced greater obstacles to improving their financial circumstances. He envisioned microfinance as a vehicle for female empowerment, as well as material gains.\n\nGrameen Bank has continued to help marginalized women as it expands throughout Bangladesh and around the world. In 2006, Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work in microfinance. Yunus has inspired legions of other MFIs with the fundamental idea that self-ownership can be a route out of poverty. The lesson of Grameen is that given the right tools, the poor have the capacity to help themselves."
