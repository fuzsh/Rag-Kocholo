        "text": "Maybe you’ve had this happen to you. You’re walking down the street, and all of a sudden, someone stops you to ask for money. They might say something like:\n\nCan you spare some change? I’m hungry and I need food —anything you have will help.\n\nMaybe you answer right away with, “No, sorry,” and keep walking.\n\nOr maybe you pause for a second to consider giving them something. In the split second you have to decide, you might mentally pull up articles you’ve read on how helping can hurt, or you may question if they’re actually going to spend the money on food. Since you’re pretty sure giving them a temporary handout won’t help, and you’ll never know how they really spent the money, maybe you hesitantly say, “No, I’m so sorry,” and keep walking.\n\nOr perhaps, after thinking about all that, you say, “Yeah, sure,” and give them money anyway.\n\nWhat is the right response?\n\nI wrestle with this question every day — I live in a big city where homelessness is high, so I have these interactions regularly. I hate how often I respond the first way. My heart feels broken for each person that stops me, but most of the time, I still brush them off because I don’t know the right way to help.\n\nIf all three of these options are wrong, could there be a fourth option that’s right? Muhammad Yunus, Nobel Peace Prize Winner and pioneer in the Social Enterprise space, would say yes — there is a better response to poverty, and it’s called Social Business.\n\nA Bank for the Poor\n\nI first learned about Muhammed Yunus in a Social Entrepreneurship class in University. I’d never heard of social enterprise before, so I was excited to discover this global movement of using business for social good. We watched a video of Yunus during one of the first classes, and learned about his bank for the poor, Grameen Bank.\n\nHe originally founded this bank in Bangladesh out of desperation — poor women in his village were being taken advantage of by loan sharks who were lending out money, charging extremely high interest rates, and then blackmailing them to elicit payments.\n\nAt the time, Yunus was a University professor, and after learning about the crimes in his community, decided to give out microloans to these women himself. His loans were interest free, could be paid back at any time, and allowed women to start businesses so they could become self-sufficient.\n\n“Every time I look at a problem, I try to find a solution. So for every problem, I create a business to solve it. There are so many problems, so I have so many businesses. Now we have more than 60 companies, some nation wide and some international. This is what we call Social Business.”\n\n— Muhammad Yunus\n\nI had the honour of hearing Muhammad Yunus speak last week at the Centre for Social Innovation (CSI) in downtown Toronto. Since I had followed his work for years, I was excited to hear him share his thoughts on how to help the poor. It was an engaging, intimate, and inspiring conversation between Muhammad Yunus, and Tonya Surman, the co-founder and leader of the Centre for Social Innovation. I wish I could transcribe and shared their entire conversation with you — this is a superpower I’d love to have FYI — but since that’s not possible, I’ll focus on a few of the highlights.\n\nProfit versus Charity\n\nYunus started by explaining that there are two ways of viewing business: for profit, or for charity. These two models have historically been binary — either you cared about making profit, or you cared about helping people. Yunus explained that this was an issue because when you solve a problem with charity, money goes out, but it never comes back.\n\nThis is where social business comes in.\n\nYunus decided to try doing business differently so that money would go out, solve a problem, but then come back. For example, his microloans allowed women to start businesses and make money, but instead of taking a percentage of their profit, all he asked was that they pay back his initial investment. Since they always paid him back in full, this created a cycle of reusing money to give out more microloans.\n\nThe Grameen Bank is a sustainable, scalable, business model that, according to Yunus, could actually eliminate poverty.\n\nHe shared this on how his banking model is different:\n\n“E verything conventional banks do, we do the opposite. They go to the rich, we go to the poor. They go to the city, we go to the rural village. The richer you are, the happier they are. The poorer you are, the more excited we are!”\n\nThis opposite view of banking is a great example of the way social business is disrupting the conventional views of business around the world. There is still a place for profit and charity in today's society, but if the hybrid of the two — social business — continues to transform communities into sustainable entities, the idea of eliminating poverty might not be that crazy.\n\nUsing Social Business as a Catalyst for Change\n\nYunus shared a story about another problem he identified in rural communities after starting Grameen Bank. As he was traveling to grow the business, he learned that many children in villages could see during the day, but when it got dark, they were all blind. They were suffering from an eye condition called night blindness caused by a Vitamin A deficiency. After doing some research, Yunus learned that this problem could easily be fixed through eating vegetables.\n\nHe decided to solve this problem by starting another social business. Along with offering microloans to women in the villages, he also began selling one penny packages of seeds so that they could grow their own vegetables and feed their children. After selling these seed packages throughout the country, he was able to successfully eliminate night blindness.\n\nHe did something similar with sanitation issues that communities were facing. In order to help reduce open defecation, he said that if a community wanted to have a Grameen Bank, they also needed to have a toilet. He helped them get toilets by starting another social business, and through that initiative, has been able to almost completely eradicate open defecation in Bangladesh!\n\nAre you inspired yet?\n\nAll these problems were solved through putting people and the planet at the centre of the economic system. This socially driven approach is commonly referred to as the triple bottom line: people, profit, and planet. Social business is able to address all three of these areas in a sustainable and replicable way.\n\nGrameen “Women’s” Bank\n\nAfter the main discussion, the audience had the chance to ask a few questions, and it’s the final question from the Q&A that I want to highlight.\n\nA man in the front row raised his hand, and innocently asked why Grameen Bank works with so many women. Yunus had explained that Grameen Bank started out working exclusively with women, and he shared that only 10 years ago, the bank was still made up of 63% women. But after this question was asked, Yunus started to laugh.\n\nAnd then he laughed a little more.\n\nEventually, he explained that in all his years of work, this was THE MOST popular question he’s ever asked. This was his response:\n\n“I’ll reverse it and ask, “have you ever, at any time in your life, asked, “why so many men?” We [Grameen Bank] try to undo that mentality.”\n\nHe also told a story of a man who once approached him after an event to suggest he change the name of his bank to “Grameen Women’s Bank”, seeing as they work with so many women. Yunus responded by saying:\n\n“I would love to do that, good idea. But before I do, you have to tell me the percentage of men in your bank… Maybe 90%? Maybe 99? So before I change the name of my bank [to a women’s bank], you have to change the name of your bank to a men’s bank.”\n\nWhat a fantastic response. As someone who is passionate about women’s rights and gender equality, I had to hold myself back from jumping on my chair and fist pumping, breakfast club style, during the applause.\n\nThe Right Way to Help\n\nAt the start of this article, I asked about the right way to help people.\n\nAfter reflecting on Muhammed Yunus, his life’s work, and the stories he shared during his talk, here’s what I’ve got.\n\nHelping people looks like viewing the world as a series of problems and solutions. Yunus made his mission simple: see a problem and find a way to solve it. For him, that meant creating social businesses. For you and me, that might look different.\n\nDon’t overcomplicate it. Try taking a look around next time you’re walking down the street. Be intentional and see if you can identify any problems. Challenge yourself to think about how you could find a solution. Maybe it could look like starting your own social business, or maybe it means supporting an existing social business or charity that you’re passionate about.\n\nThe main lesson I learned from Muhammad Yunus’s talk was to keep it simple. Start in your own community and go from there. That’s exactly how he started— he was a regular man, living his life, until one day, he noticed a problem that he couldn’t ignore.\n\nWhat is that problem for you?\n\nIs there a social issue you think about every day? Does your heart hurt for a people group or environmental problem? Do you brush it off because you’re not sure how to solve it?\n\nI know I do.\n\nBut let’s stop brushing it off, and instead, dream about how we could start finding solutions. If you feel inspired by Muhammad Yunus and the work he’s accomplished, use that motivation to propel you into action. Be audacious in the problems you want to solve, because maybe one day, you’ll be in a position to say something like “this is how to end poverty” too."
