        "text": "Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that the war “is coming home” after Ukrainian troops reportedly seized around 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory and captured hundreds of enemy soldiers. Russian authorities evacuated some 180,000 people from Kursk, the border region targeted by Ukraine’s army, and Belgorod, an adjoining region. Mr Zelensky suggested that the offensive sought to draw Russian soldiers away from other positions in northern and eastern Ukraine, calling it “purely a security issue for Ukraine”.\n\nStarbucks, an American coffee chain, said that its boss, Laxman Narasimhan, would step down immediately. Brian Niccol, who is currently in charge of the fast-food retailer Chipotle, will take over in September. Mr Narasimhan has been under pressure from activist investors who have bought up a big stake in Starbucks and pushed for Mr Narasimhan to reverse a slowdown in sales."
