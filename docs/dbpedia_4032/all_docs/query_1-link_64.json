        "text": "Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh Everything has a beginning and an end. And today will be our last episode, where we are now living in the 20th century, we are going to be sharing with you the life of a woman by the name of our Isha Mohammed bin to Abdur Rahman. She was born in a small city on the Mediterranean in Egypt called the Myat 1912 finished her primary school at home.\n\nAnd then she didn't continue her education to little bit later, there was a gap where she finished high school and finished university, many of us yet didn't know her because she is not known by the name of Irish having to have drama. She's actually known by our is had been to sharpen the daughter, I share the daughter of the shore, because she was born in the city on the Mediterranean. This is very common in that time, where women don't put their names public. Rather they use the nickname. She was very keen on learning, continued to study Arabic language, till she got her PhD in Arabic language, she continued and chose to do academic career ended up being a professor at ancient\n\nUniversity in Cairo, but also professor of Tafseer of the Quran or commentary on the Quran. In the Quran, Queen University in Fez, which we covered the founder in the last episode, this woman who was married\n\nto a man who was actually not only her husband, but was her teacher, I mean, a holy\n\nwho, what you wrote about her.\n\nevery woman, every married woman, would love to see her husband describe her as this, she is the disciple of the literally school, who he belongs to. And the lady of the house that he reside in, she dedicated all her writings to him, whether they are books, which she published many, or they were research papers, it all has a dedication to him. She was so much in debt to what he did to her to help her to achieve what she achieved. She was professor for more than 50 years, she has so many students in all over the world, especially the Arab world, Lebanon, Sudan, Egypt, North Africa, one of the unique things she wrote was actually the commentary of Cyril Bayani for the last 14 solos of\n\nthe Quran was written by a woman It took her eight years to write that book uniqueness in Ayesha winter sharp is not only that, she became so educated in a time where education for a woman was in some places nonexisting but she was also left a so much impact on many people around her and her special uniqueness if you want to use the word that she always combined. Some studies in Arabic studies she always used Arabic language, but basically referring to the Quran or using Quranic language. When she was teaching Arabic language. She was a woman of power. She loved to empower a woman. She believed strongly in empowering woman, but within the stomach boundaries. She was an\n\npracticing Muslim educated woman who believed in empowering woman, but at the same time following the rules and the orders of Allah subhanahu ATOD. She left behind her more than 40 books in Islamic science, dozens of books in Arabic literature, novels, hundreds of research papers, and innumerable articles in daily and weekly newspapers. That many amount of publication, which was written over about 60 years this fan made her deserve to be described as the most accomplished female scholar in the 20th century. After her death actually, she was recognized by the Egyptian government by having a stamp specially for her with a picture of the like of her we don't have her real picture. May\n\nAllah bless her soul she died in her 80s May Allah bless her soul. May Allah subhanho wa Taala accept all what you did for us as woman and for all\n\nof Muslims. May Allah make us follow her footsteps and make us be as influential and as powerful as she was."
