Mohammad Younis played a leading role in defending exploited workers in Ireland after years of abuse at work. For 7 years, he worked as a chef, 11 hours a day, 7 days a week for €40. Despite winning his case and being awarded €91,000 in backpay, his employer wriggled out of paying, leaving Mohammad with nothing.

Now Mohammad is reaching the end of his working life, his health is failing, and he needs our help to return to his family in Pakistan.

Can you chip in a few Euro to help make sure he can afford to return and spend the next part of his life with the people he loves?

Mohammad was extremely brave in coming forward. It takes huge courage to break free and bring a case against an employer who has been exploiting you for years. But because his employer declared bankruptcy and avoided paying a penny, Mohammad has nothing to show for his courage in speaking out.

The money from this fundraiser will go straight to Mohammad. Can you contribute what you can, to make sure he can get back to Pakistan to spend the next part of his life with the people he loves?
