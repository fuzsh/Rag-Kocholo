Topics include the following: Maxwell’s equations for time varying fields, time harmonic EM fields, wave equation, uniform plane waves, polarization, Poynting theorem and power, reflection and transmission in multiple dielectrics at normal incidence and at oblique incidence, TEM wave in transmission lines, transients on transmission lines, pulse and step excitations, resistive, reactive and complex loads, sinusoidal steady state solutions, standing waves, input impedance, the Smith Chart, power and power division and impedance matching techniques, TE and TM waves in rectangular waveguides, experiments using state-of-art RF equipment illustrating fundamental wave propagation and reflection concepts, design projects with state-of-art EM modeling tools.\n\nEEEE-499\n\nCo-op\n\n0 Credits\n\nOne semester of paid work experience in electrical engineering.\n\nEEEE-517\n\nMicrowave Circuit Design\n\n3 Credits\n\nThe primary objective is to study the fundamentals of microwave engineering with emphasis on microwave network analysis and circuit design. Topics include microwave transmission lines such as wave-guides, coax, microstrip and stripline, microwave circuit theory such as S- matrix, ABCD matrices, and even odd mode analysis, analysis and design of passive circuits and components, matching networks, microwave resonators and filters. Microwave circuit design will be performed using ANSYS Designer software.\n\nEEEE-529\n\nAntenna Theory\n\n3 Credits\n\nThe primary objective is to study the fundamental principles of antenna theory applied to the analysis and design of antenna elements and arrays including synthesis techniques and matching techniques. Topics include antenna parameters, linear antennas, array theory, wire antennas, microstrip antennas, antenna synthesis, aperture antennas and reflector antennas. The course involves design projects using some commercial EM software such as ANSYS HFSS. Measurement techniques for antenna input and radiation characteristics will be discussed and illustrated with the use of network analyzers, and spectrum analyzers in an anechoic chamber.\n\nEEEE-617\n\nMicrowave Circuit Design\n\n3 Credits\n\nThe primary objective is to study the fundamentals of microwave engineering with emphasis on microwave network analysis and circuit design. Topics include microwave transmission lines such as wave-guides, coax, microstrip and stripline, microwave circuit theory such as S- matrix, ABCD matrices, and even odd mode analysis, analysis and design of passive circuits and components, matching networks, microwave resonators and filters.

A formal written thesis and an oral defense are required. The student must obtain the approval of an appropriate faculty member to guide the thesis before registering for the thesis. A thesis may be used to earn a maximum of 6 credits.\n\nEEEE-792\n\nGraduate Paper\n\n3 Credits\n\nThis course is used to fulfill the graduate paper requirement under the non-thesis option for the MS degree in electrical engineering. The student must obtain the approval of an appropriate faculty member to supervise the paper before registering for this course.\n\nEEEE-795\n\nGraduate Seminar\n\n0 Credits\n\nThe objective of this course is to introduce full time Electrical Engineering BS/MS and incoming graduate students to the graduate programs, campus resources to support research. Presentations from faculty, upper division MS/PhD students, staff, and off campus speakers will expose students to current research being pursued in different areas of electrical engineering and will provide a basis for student selection of research topics. All first year graduate students enrolled full time and BS/MS students starting the MS program are required to successfully complete one semester of this seminar.\n\nIn the News"
