        "meta_description": "There has been a growing interest in the U.S. to study local and regional food systems with respect to\neconomic, social, and enterprise development. This paper discusses a series of on-going projects funded\nby the USDA focusing on two aspects of the relationships between social network and food choices â€“\nproducers, and interactions between producers and consumers (buyers). Preliminary results showed\ndistribution and opportunities for agricultural producers to exploit and implement new strategies that\nwould enhance marketing and management by taking advantage of the capacity of social/economic\nnetworks in/around communities. Long-term goal on completion these studies will compare and\ncontrast local, regional, and national approaches to design and implement effective marketing and\nmanagement strategies that aim to promote local/regional food networks from social, economic, and\necological perspectives.\nLiang, Chyi-Lyi (Kathleen); Pescatore, Matthew",
