More information about the traveling to the center (Google Map) can be found on the Applied Physics Laboratory webpage.\n\nVirtual Connections\n\nWATCH LIVE ON\n\nor watch on\n\nOverview\n\n5G is not just the next evolution of 4G technology; it's a paradigm shift. It is expected to enable fundamentally new applications — with much more stringent requirements in latency and bandwidth — and provide resiliency and flexibility to the underlying network. Several standards organizations and forums, namely IEEE, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, and the International Telecommunication Union are working on defining the architecture and standardizing aspects of 5G technologies. However, few organizations are focusing on how such technologies can be useful to tactical and first responder networks.\n\nIEEE is hosting the sixth workshop in this series on 13 December 2023 at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, MD, USA. In 2022-2021, it was the result of partnership and collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T), the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL), and the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) - 5G. This workshop will explore the applicability of 5G technologies for tactical and first responder networks, offer solutions, share use cases, and investigate research opportunities and challenges. The event will also provide an opportunity for 5G experts from industry and academia, and the standards, regulatory, homeland security, public safety, and defense communities to collaborate.\n\nFor any questions, please contact:\n\nAshutosh Dutta\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
