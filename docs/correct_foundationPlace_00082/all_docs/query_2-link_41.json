        "text": "UW Announces Appointment of Entrepreneurial Faculty Fellows\n\nUniversity of Washington President Michael Young has recognized eleven professors for their innovative spirit, appointing them to the Presidential Entrepreneurial Faculty Fellows (EFFs) program. The program was begun in 2011.\n\n“I believe we’re at the early stages of a new wave of entrepreneurial innovation at the university, led by our faculty leaders who are models of energy and imagination,” Young remarked. “These eleven professors are remarkable examples of that innovative spirit, and their contributions to our university and the state are extraordinary.”\n\nVice Provost and Executive Director of the Center for Commercialization Linden Rhoads said that, “The Entrepreneurial Fellows Program conveys the University’s top leaders’ commitment to increasing commercialization activity and embracing entrepreneurial efforts by our faculty. The program is one element of our campaign to foster an entrepreneurial culture across the University.” Vice Provost Rhoads is also a WCTA Board member.\n\nIn two-year terms, Fellows may serve as mentors to other University of Washington faculty, researchers, and staff with entrepreneurial aspirations and share their experiences with student and faculty groups at entrepreneurial events organized on campus. Fellows also advise the University of Washington Center for Commercialization.\n\nThe 2012 University of Washington Presidential Entrepreneurial Faculty Fellows are:\n\nDavid Baker is a professor of biochemistry and an adjunct professor of genome sciences, bioengineering, computer science, chemical engineering, and physics.
