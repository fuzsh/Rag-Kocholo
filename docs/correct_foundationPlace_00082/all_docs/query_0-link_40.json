A.; Mahmud, S. N. S.; Zamani, A. H.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDevelopment of low losses, small size and broad bandwidth microwave bandpass filter operating at higher frequencies is an active area of research. This paper presents a new route used to design and simulate microwave bandpass filter using finite element modelling and realized broad bandwidth, low losses, small dimension microwave bandpass filter operating at 10 GHz frequency using return loss method. The filter circuit has been carried out using Computer Aid Design (CAD), Ansoft HFSS software and designed with four parallel couple line model and small dimension (10 Ã 10 mm2) using LaAlO3 substrate. The response of the microwave filter circuit showed high return loss -50 dB at operating frequency at 10.4 GHz and broad bandwidth of 2.5 GHz from 9.5 to 12 GHz. The results indicate the filter design and simulation using HFSS is reliable and have the opportunity to transfer from lab potential experiments to the industry.\n\nProceedings of the 2009 Antenna Applications Symposium held in Monticello, Illinois on 22-24 September 2009.

Therefore there is a significant difference between mist and smoke when detected by electromagnetic wave. This paper puts forward a kind of feasible solution based on Ansoft HFSS software about how to determine the forest fire by distinguishing mist and smoke above the forest. The experiments simulate the difference between mist and smoke model when detected by electromagnetic wave in different wavelengths. We find the mist and smoke model cannot absorb or reflect electromagnetic wave efficiently in Megahertz band. While in Gigahertz band mist model began to absorb and reflect electromagnetic wave above 650 Gigahertz band, but no change in smoke model. And the biggest difference appears in Terahertz band.\n\nMultilayered tissues model for wave propagation loss assessment in cochlear implants\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaun, Maria-Alexandra; Dehollain, Catherine\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIn this paper, a study of the power loss attenuation of the plane wave travelling through the tissue layers, from the outside to the inside of the skull within a cochlear implant, is performed. Different implantation depths of the internal antenna from 10 to 30 mm are considered. To this purpose, the gain and attenuation in dB are studied. A multilayer tissue model is developed, consisting of mainly skin, mastoid bone and brain. An s-parameter analysis is also carried out, using loop antennas and simulated head tissue. Ansoft AnsysÂ® HFSS software is used for electro-magnetic simulations of the antennas, placed in different types of human tissues. Smith charts for antenna placed in both skin and multi-tissue model are included.\n\nModeling and characteristic of the SMT Board Plug connector in high speed optical communication system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, Haoran; Dong, Zhenzhen; Wang, Tanglin; Zhao, Heng; Feng, Junbo; Cui, Naidi; Teng, Jie; Guo, Jin\n\n2015-04-01\n\nModeling and characteristic of the SMT Board Plug connector, which is used to connect micro optical transceiver to the main board, are proposed and analyzed in this paper. When the high speed signal transfers from the PCB of transceiver to main board through SMT Board Plug connector, the structure and material discontinuity of the connector causes insertion losses and impedance mismatches. This makes the performance of high speed digital system exacerbated. So it is essential to analyze the signal transfer characteristics of the connector and find out what factors affected the signal quality at the design stage of the digital system. To solve this problem, Ansoft's High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS), based on the finite element method, was employed to build accurate 3D models, analyze the effects of various structure parameters, and obtain the full-wave characteristics of the SMT Board Plug connectors in this paper. Then an equivalent circuit model was developed. The circuit parameters were extracted precisely in the frequency range of interests by using the curve fitting method in ADS software, and the result was in good agreement with HFSS simulations up to 8GHz with different structure parameters. At last, the measurement results of S-parameter and eye diagram were given and the S-parameters showed good coincidence between the measurement and HFSS simulation up to 4GHz.\n\nRisk stratification in middle-aged patients with congestive heart failure: prospective comparison of the Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) and a simplified two-variable model.\n\nPubMed\n\nZugck, C; KrÃ¼ger, C; Kell, R; KÃ¶rber, S; Schellberg, D; KÃ¼bler, W; Haass, M\n\n2001-10-01\n\nThe performance of a US-American scoring system (Heart Failure Survival Score, HFSS) was prospectively evaluated in a sample of ambulatory patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Additionally, it was investigated whether the HFSS might be simplified by assessment of the distance ambulated during a 6-min walk test (6'WT) instead of determination of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)). In 208 middle-aged CHF patients (age 54+/-10 years, 82% male, NYHA class 2.3+/-0.7; follow-up 28+/-14 months) the seven variables of the HFSS: CHF aetiology; heart rate; mean arterial pressure; serum sodium concentration; intraventricular conduction time; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); and peak VO(2), were determined. Additionally, a 6'WT was performed. The HFSS allowed discrimination between patients at low, medium and high risk, with mortality rates of 16, 39 and 50%, respectively. However, the prognostic power of the HFSS was not superior to a two-variable model consisting only of LVEF and peak VO(2). The areas under the receiver operating curves (AUC) for prediction of 1-year survival were even higher for the two-variable model (0.84 vs. 0.74, P<0.05). Replacing peak VO(2) with 6'WT resulted in a similar AUC (0.83). The HFSS continued to predict survival when applied to this patient sample. However, the HFSS was inferior to a two-variable model containing only LVEF and either peak VO(2) or 6'WT. As the 6'WT requires no sophisticated equipment, a simplified two-variable model containing only LVEF and 6'WT may be more widely applicable, and is therefore recommended.\n\nHigh Current Density Scandate Cathodes for Future Vacuum Electronics Applications\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-05-30\n\nof Technology HFSS Ansoft Corporation’s High Frequency Structure Simulator TWT Traveling Wave Tube - device for generating high levels of RF power ...cathodes are practical for high power RF sources.

The sine wave of the metal grating is replaced by a flat-roofed sine wave around the electron beam tunnel. The slow-wave characteristics including the dispersion properties and interaction impedance have been investigated by using the eigenmode solver in the 3-D electromagnetic simulation software Ansoft HFSS. Through calculations, the FRSWG SWS possesses the larger average interaction impedance than the conventional sine waveguide (SWG) SWS in the frequency range of 86-110 GHz. The beam-wave interaction was studied and particle-in-cell simulation results show that the SEB TWT can produce output power over 120 W within the bandwidth ranging from 90 to 100 GHz, and the maximum output power is 226 W at typical frequency 94 GHz, corresponding electron efficiency of 5.89%.\n\nAbsorption and emission properties of photonic crystals and metamaterials\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPeng, Lili\n\nWe study the emission and absorption properties of photonic crystals and metamaterials using Comsol Multiphysics and Ansoft HFSS as simulation tools. We calculate the emission properties of metallic designs using drude model and the results illustrate that an appropriate termination of the surface of the metallic structure can significantly increase the absorption and therefore the thermal emissivity. We investigate the spontaneous emission rate modifications that occur for emitters inside two-dimensional photonic crystals and find the isotropic and directional emissions with respect to different frequencies as we have expected.\n\nA comparative study between different approaches to improve the RCS of a compact double-layer absorber\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl-Hakim, H. A.; Mahmoud, K. R.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nIn this paper, straightforward and efficient techniques have been addressed into double-layer structure to enlarge the operating bandwidth to include the X, Ku and K bands, in addition to increase the electromagnetic wave absorption for wide varieties of incident angles and both polarization types. To increase the band-stop resonating frequency up to 26 GHz, an additional layer of meta-surface, circuit analog radar absorber material (CAR), or a thin radar absorber material (RAM) layer is engineered. The synthesized layers are designed based on optimization process with genetic algorithm (GA) through numerical technique (Ansoft design software HFSS) for both transmission line (T.L) and the free space method to get optimal material properties suitable for the design. For different approaches, the designed structures achieved a reflectivity value less than -16 dB on average in the desired bandwidth from 8 to 26 GHz for TE/TM modes with incidence angle up to 50o.\n\nDesign and Fabrication of Graphene Reinforced Polymer Conductive Patch-Based Inset Fed Microstrip Antenna\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeepak, A.; Kannan, P. Muthu; Shankar, P.\n\nThis work explores the design and fabrication of graphene reinforced polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) patch-based microstrip antenna. Primarily, antenna was designed at 6GHz frequency and simulation results were obtained using Ansoft HFSS tool. Later fabrication of antenna was carried out with graphene-PVDF films as conducting patch deposited on bakelite substrate and copper as ground plane. Graphene-PVDF films were prepared using solvent casting process. The radiation efficiency of fabricated microstrip patch antenna was 48% entailing it to be adapted as a practically functional antenna. Both simulated and the practical results were compared and analyzed.\n\nAn improved ultra-wideband bandpass filter design using split ring resonator with coupled microstrip line\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUmeshkumar, Dubey Suhmita; Kumar, Manish\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis paper incorporates an improved design of Ultra Wideband Bandpass filter by using split ring resonators (SRR) along with the coupled microstrip lines. The use of split ring resonators and shunt step impedance open circuit stub enhances the stability due to transmission zeroes at the ends. The designing of filter and simulation of parameters is carried out using Ansoft's HFSS 13.0 software on RT/Duroid 6002 as a substrate with dielectric constant of 2.94. The design utilizes a frequency band from 22GHz to 29GHz. This band is reserved for Automotive Radar system and sensors as per FCC specifications. The proposed design demonstrates insertion loss less than 0.6dB and return loss better than 12dB at mid frequency i.e. 24.4GHz. The reflection coefficient shows high stability of about 12.47dB at mid frequency. The fractional bandwidth of the proposed filter is about 28.7% and size of filter design is small due to thickness of 0.127mm.\n\nComputed a multiple band metamaterial absorber and its application based on the figure of merit value\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Chao; Sheng, Yuping; Jun, Wang\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA high performed multiple band metamaterial absorber is designed and computed through the software Ansofts HFSS 10.0, which is constituted with two kinds of separated metal particles sub-structures. The multiple band absorption property of the metamaterial absorber is based on the resonance of localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes excited near edges of metal particles. The damping constant of gold layer is optimized to obtain a near-perfect absorption rate. Four kinds of dielectric layers is computed to achieve the perfect absorption perform. The perfect absorption perform of the metamaterial absorber is enhanced through optimizing the structural parameters (R = 75 nm, w = 80 nm). Moreover, a perfect absorption band is achieved because of the plasmonic hybridization phenomenon between LSP modes. The designed metamaterial absorber shows high sensitive in the changed of the refractive index of the liquid. A liquid refractive index sensor strategy is proposed based on the computed figure of merit (FOM) value of the metamaterial absorber. High FOM values (116, 111, and 108) are achieved with three liquid (Methanol, Carbon tetrachloride, and Carbon disulfide).\n\nNew VHP-Female v. 2.0 full-body computational phantom and its performance metrics using FEM simulator ANSYS HFSS.\n\nPubMed\n\nYanamadala, Janakinadh; Noetscher, Gregory M; Rathi, Vishal K; Maliye, Saili; Win, Htay A; Tran, Anh L; Jackson, Xavier J; Htet, Aung T; Kozlov, Mikhail; Nazarian, Ara; Louie, Sara; Makarov, Sergey N\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSimulation of the electromagnetic response of the human body relies heavily upon efficient computational models or phantoms. The first objective of this paper is to present a new platform-independent full-body electromagnetic computational model (computational phantom), the Visible Human Project(Â®) (VHP)-Female v. 2.0 and to describe its distinct features. The second objective is to report phantom simulation performance metrics using the commercial FEM electromagnetic solver ANSYS HFSS.\n\nLarge/Complex Antenna Performance Validation for Spaceborne Radar/Radiometeric Instruments\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFocardi, Paolo; Harrell, Jefferson; Vacchione, Joseph\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOver the past decade, Earth observing missions which employ spaceborne combined radar & radiometric instruments have been developed and implemented. These instruments include the use of large and complex deployable antennas whose radiation characteristics need to be accurately determined over 4 pisteradians. Given the size and complexity of these antennas, the performance of the flight units cannot be readily measured. In addition, the radiation performance is impacted by the presence of the instrument's service platform which cannot easily be included in any measurement campaign. In order to meet the system performance knowledge requirements, a two pronged approach has been employed. The first is to use modeling tools to characterize the system and the second is to build a scale model of the system and use RF measurements to validate the results of the modeling tools. This paper demonstrates the resulting level of agreement between scale model and numerical modeling for two recent missions: (1) the earlier Aquarius instrument currently in Earth orbit and (2) the upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The results from two modeling approaches, Ansoft's High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) and TICRA's General RF Applications Software Package (GRASP), were compared with measurements of approximately 1/10th scale models of the Aquarius and SMAP systems. Generally good agreement was found between the three methods but each approach had its shortcomings as will be detailed in this paper.\n\nDesign Investigation of a Laminated Waveguide Fed Multi-Band DRA for Military Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumar, Pramod; Dwari, Santanu; Singh, Shailendra; Agrawal, N. K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this paper a laminated waveguide fed DR Antenna is investigated. It can use for moderate power military applications. Cylindrical DRA is excited by two closely spaced asymmetric longitudinal slots on the broad wall of the laminated cavity are responsible for producing three different frequency bands. Parametric study of slots has been done with the help of commercial software ANSOFT HFSS. All the bands have sharp rejection. The final model of the antenna is simulated, fabricated and experimentally measured. Measured results are in quite accordant with design results. SIW feeding structures have small losses, moderate power handling capacity, low costs, compact sizes and can be seamlessly integrated with planar circuits. At all the bands 9.76 GHz, 10.53 GHz and 11.8 GHz resonant frequency, the antenna shows 56 MHz, 160 MHz, and 250 MHz impedance bandwidth (for VSWR<2) with 6 dB,6.2 dB and 6.8 dB gain respectively. Simulated and measured results reveal outstanding performance with a cross-polar level of 29 dB lower than that of the co-polar level at 9.76 GHz, the cross-polar level of 32 dB lower than that of the co-polar level at 10.53, GHz, and similarly cross-polar level of 30 dB lower than that of the co-polar level at 11.8 GHz.\n\nAn efficient hexagonal switched beam antenna structure based on Fabry-Perot cavity leaky-wave antenna\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAymen El Cafsi, Mohamed; Nedil, Mourad; Osman, Lotfi; Gharsallah, Ali\n\n2015-11-01\n\nA novel design of switched beam antenna (SBA) system based on Fabry-Perot cavity leaky-wave antenna (FPC LWA) is designed and fabricated for base station operating in the unlicensed ISM central frequency band at 5.8 GHz of the wireless local area network (WLAN) standard. The proposed SBA is designed with hexagonal shape of FPC LWA Arrays in order to get 360Â° of coverage. The single element of FPC LWA array is composed of a patch antenna and covered by a Partially Reflective Surface (PRS), which is composed of a Metal Strip Grating and printed on a high permittivity Superstrate. First, the Transmission Line Model of FPC LWA is introduced to analyse and calculate the far-field components in E- and H planes by using the Transverse Equivalent Network. This approach is then compared with other full wave's commercial software such as Ansoft HFSS and CST Microwave Studio. Second, a parametric study is performed to evaluate the effect of the angle formed by the two successive FPC LWA on the radiation efficiency of the activate sector. To examine the performance of the proposed SBA, experimental prototype was fabricated and measured. As a result, multiple orthogonal beams (six beams) of 10 dBi of gain with low Side Lobes Level and 360Â° of coverage are produced. This SBA structure is suitable for WLAN communication systems.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGÃ¼ndoÄan, M.

This type of antenna was chosen for its compact structure, flexible application and wide heating area. The temperature field generated by the use of this Two-armed Spiral Antenna in a muscle-equivalent phantom was simulated and subsequently validated by experimentation. First, the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the field was calculated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) by Ansoft's High Frequency Structure Simulation (HFSS). Then, the temperature elevation in the phantom was simulated by an explicit finite difference approximation of the bioheat equation (BHE). The temperature distribution was then validated by a phantom heating experiment. The results showed that this antenna had a good heating ability and a wide heating area. A comparison between the calculation and the measurement showed a fair agreement in the temperature elevation. The validated model could be applied for the analysis of electromagnetic-temperature distribution in phantoms during the process of antenna design or thermotherapy experimentation.\n\nSimulation analysis on miniature wireless power transfer system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Tao; Wei, Zhiqiang; Yin, Bo; Chi, Haokun; Du, Panpan\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn recent years, the research on implantable medical devices has become a hot scientific topic, and the power supply of these devices are especially concerned. Generally, these devices are usually powered by disposable batteries. However, for some of the long-term human implant devices, such as pacemakers, once the battery has been exhausted after several years, the patient has to replace the battery by surgery, which increases the patientâs economic burden and pain. Wireless power transfer technology, using non-contact way for power transfer, can be a good solution to this problem. In this paper, a micro induction coil was designed, and the transfer efficiency in the air and human tissue model of two-layers were simulated by Ansoft HFSS. The results showed that the system could achieve the energy transfer in both cases, meanwhile, it indicated that the transfer efficiency was lower in a relative larger permittivity of transmission medium.\n\nMultipurpose EPR loop-gap resonator and cylindrical TE011 cavity for aqueous samples at 94 GHz.\n\nPubMed\n\nSidabras, Jason W; Mett, Richard R; Froncisz, Wojciech; Camenisch, Theodore G; Anderson, James R; Hyde, James S\n\n2007-03-01\n\nA loop-gap resonator (LGR) and a cylindrical TE(011) cavity resonator for use at W band, 94 GHz, have been designed and characterized using the Ansoft (Pittsburgh, PA) high frequency structure simulator (HFSS; Version 10.0). Field modulation penetration was analyzed using Ansoft MAXWELL 3D (Version 11.0). Optimizing both resonators to the same sample sizes shows that EPR signal intensities of the LGR and TE(011) are similar. The 3 dB bandwidth of the LGR, on the order of 1 GHz, is a new advantage for high frequency experiments. Ultraprecision electric discharge machining (EDM) was used to fabricate the resonators from silver. The TE(011) cavity has slots that are cut into the body to allow penetration of 100 kHz field modulation. The resonator body is embedded in graphite, also cut by EDM techniques, for a combination of reasons that include (i) reduced microwave leakage and improved TE(011) mode purity, (ii) field modulation penetration, (iii) structural support for the cavity body, and (iv) machinability by EDM. Both resonators use a slotted iris. Variable coupling is provided by a three-stub tuning element. A collet system designed to hold sample tubes has been implemented, increasing repeatability of sample placement and reducing sample vibration noise. Initial results include multiquantum experiments up to 9Q using the LGR to examine 1 mM 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in aqueous solution at room temperature and field modulation experiments using the TE(011) cavity to obtain an EPR spectrum of 1 microM TEMPO.\n\nSpectral definition of the ArTeMiS instrument\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaynes, Vic; Maffei, Bruno; Pisano, Giampaolo; Dubreuil, Didier; Delisle, Cyrille; Le Pennec, Jean; Hurtado, Norma\n\n2014-07-01\n\nArTeMiS is a sub-millimetre camera to be operated, on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment Telescope (APEX). The ultimate goal is to observe simultaneously in three atmospheric spectral windows in the region of 200, 350 and 450 microns. We present the filtering scheme, which includes the cryostat window, thermal rejection elements, band separation and spectral isolation, which has been adopted for this instrument. This was achieved using a combination of scattering, Yoshinaga filters, organic dyes and Ulrich type embedded metallic mesh devices. Design of the quasi-optical mesh components has been developed by modelling with an in-house developed code. For the band separating dichroics, which are used with an incidence angle of 35 deg, further modelling has been performed with HFSS (Ansoft). Spectral characterization of the components for the 350 and 450 bands have been performed with a Martin-Puplett Polarizing Fourier Transform Spectrometer. While for the first commissioning and observation campaign, one spectral band only was operational (350 microns), we report on the design of the 200, 350 and 450 micron bands.\n\nDesign and Experimental Verification of Deployable/Inflatable Ultra-Lightweight Structures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPai, P. Frank\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBecause launch cost of a space structural system is often proportional to the launch volume and mass and there is no significant gravity in space, NASA's space exploration programs and various science missions have stimulated extensive use of ultra-lightweight deployable/inflatable structures. These structures are named here as Highly Flexible Structures (HFSs) because they are designed to undergo large displacements, rotations, and/or buckling without plastic deformation under normal operation conditions. Except recent applications to space structural systems, HFSs have been used in many mechanical systems, civil structures, aerospace vehicles, home appliances, and medical devices to satisfy space limitations, provide special mechanisms, and/or reduce structural weight. The extensive use of HFSs in today's structural engineering reveals the need of a design and analysis software and a database system with design guidelines for practicing engineers to perform computer-aided design and rapid prototyping of HFSs. Also to prepare engineering students for future structural engineering requires a new and easy-to- understand method of presenting the complex mathematics of the modeling and analysis of HFSs. However, because of the high flexibility of HFSs, many unique challenging problems in the modeling, design and analysis of HFSs need to be studied. The current state of research on HFSs needs advances in the following areas: (1) modeling of large rotations using appropriate strain measures, (2) modeling of cross-section warpings of structures, (3) how to account for both large rotations and cross- section warpings in 2D (two-dimensional) and 1D structural theories, (4) modeling of thickness thinning of membranes due to inflation pressure, pretension, and temperature change, (5) prediction of inflated shapes and wrinkles of inflatable structures, (6) development of efficient numerical methods for nonlinear static and dynamic analyses, and (7) filling the gap between\n\nA novel electromagnetic design and a new manufacturing process for the cavity BPM (Beam Position Monitor)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDal Forno, Massimo; Craievich, Paolo; Baruzzo, Roberto; De Monte, Raffaele; Ferianis, Mario; Lamanna, Giuseppe; Vescovo, Roberto\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Cavity Beam Position Monitor (BPM) is a beam diagnostic instrument which, in a seeded Free Electron Laser (FEL), allows the measurement of the electron beam position in a non-destructive way and with sub-micron resolution. It is composed by two resonant cavities called reference and position cavity, respectively. The measurement exploits the dipole mode that arises when the electron bunch passes off axis. In this paper we describe the Cavity BPM that has been designed and realized in the context of the FERMI@Elettra project [1]. New strategies have been adopted for the microwave design, for both the reference and the position cavities. Both cavities have been simulated by means of Ansoft HFSS [2] and CST Particle Studio [3], and have been realized using high precision lathe and wire-EDM (Electro-Discharge) machine, with a new technique that avoids the use of the sinker-EDM machine. Tuners have been used to accurately adjust the working frequencies for both cavities. The RF parameters have been estimated, and the modifications of the resonant frequencies produced by brazing and tuning have been evaluated. Finally, the Cavity BPM has been installed and tested in the presence of the electron beam.\n\nFinite element analysis and performance study of switched reluctance generator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Qianhan; Guo, Yingjun; Xu, Qi; Yu, Xiaoying; Guo, Yajie\n\n2017-03-01\n\nAnalyses a three-phase 12/8 switched reluctance generator (SRG) which is based on its structure and performance principle. The initial size data were calculated by MathCAD, and the simulation model was set up in the ANSOFT software environment with the maximum efficiency and the maximum output power as the main reference parameters. The outer diameter of the stator and the inner diameter of the rotor were parameterized. The static magnetic field distribution, magnetic flux, magnetic energy, torque, inductance characteristics, back electromotive force and phase current waveform of SRG is obtained by analyzing the static magnetic field and the steady state motion of two-dimensional transient magnetic field in ANSOFT environment. Finally, the experimental data of the prototype are compared with the simulation results, which provide a reliable basis for the design and research of SRG wind turbine system.\n\nA Study of Direct Digital Manufactured RF/Microwave Packaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStratton, John W. I.\n\nVarious facets of direct digital manufactured (DDM) microwave packages are studied. The rippled surface inherent in fused deposition modeling (FDM) fabricated geometries is modeled in Ansoft HFSS, and its effect on the performance of microstrip transmission lines is assessed via simulation and measurement. The thermal response of DDM microstrip transmission lines is analyzed over a range of RF input powers, and linearity is confirmed over that range. Two IC packages are embedded into DDM printed circuit boards, and their performance is analyzed. The first is a low power RF switch, and the second is an RF front end device that includes a low noise amplifier (LNA) and a power amplifier (PA). The RF switch is shown to perform well, as compared to a layout designed for a Rogers 4003C microwave laminate substrate. The LNA performs within datasheet specifications. The power amplifier generates substantial heat, so a thermal management attempt is described. Finally, a capacitively loaded 6dB Wilkinson power divider is designed and fabricated using DDM techniques and materials. Its performance is analyzed and compared to simulation. The device is shown to compare favorably to a similar device fabricated on a Rogers 4003C microwave laminate using traditional printed circuit board techniques.\n\nModelling, analysis and validation of microwave techniques for the characterisation of metallic nanoparticles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSulaimalebbe, Aslam\n\nHigh Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS), followed by the electrical characterisation of synthesised Pt NP films using the novel miniature fabricated OCP technique. The results obtained from this technique provided the inspiration to synthesise and evaluate the microwave properties of Au NPs. The findings from this technique provided the motivation to characterise both the Pt and Au NP films using the DR technique. Unlike the OCP technique, the DR method is highly sensitive but the achievable measurement accuracy is limited since this technique does not have broadband frequency capability like the OCP method. The results obtained from the DR technique show a good agreement with the theoretical prediction. In the last phase of this research, a further validation of the aperture admittance models on different types OCP (i.e. RG-405 and RG-402 cables and SMA connector) have been carried out on the developed 3D full wave models using HFSS software, followed by the development of universal models for the aforementioned OCPs based on the same 3D full wave models.\n\nFrequency swept microwaves for hyperfine decoupling and time domain dynamic nuclear polarization\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHoff, Daniel E.M.; Albert, Brice J.; Saliba, Edward P.; Scott, Faith J.; Choi, Eric J.; Mardini, Michael; Barnes, Alexander B.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHyperfine decoupling and pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) are promising techniques to improve high field DNP NMR.

A coaxial probe feed is used to excite the proposed composite t-CDRA at the center position. Multi-segmentation approach has been applied for further improvement in bandwidth of proposed t-CDRA. The proposed composite t-CDRA has been designed using HFSS simulation software and analyzed using theoretical analysis. The prototype of t-CDRA, three elements t-CDRA and three elements dual segment t-CDRA has been fabricated for measurement. The input characteristics, near field, far field distribution of the proposed t-CDRAs have been studied through HFSS simulation software and their results are compared with corresponding experimental results. Proposed segmented t-CDRA has wide impedance bandwidth (|S11|â¤-10 dB) of 85 % with monopole-like radiation pattern. The peak gain of segmented t-CDRA has 5.1 dBi with 98.5 % radiation efficiency. The proposed segmented t-CDRA may find suitable applications in 5.0 GHz WLAN and WiMAX band.\n\nEffect of restrictions on television food advertising to children on exposure to advertisements for 'less healthy' foods: repeat cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdams, Jean; Tyrrell, Rachel; Adamson, Ashley J; White, Martin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn 2007, new scheduling restrictions on television food advertising to children in the UK were announced. The aim of the restrictions was to \"reduce significantly the exposure of children under 16 to high fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) advertising\". We explored the impact of the restrictions on relative exposure to HFSS food advertising among all viewers and among child television viewers, as well as adherence to the restrictions. We conducted two cross-sectional studies of all advertisements broadcast in one region of the UK over one week periods--the first (week 1) six months before the restrictions were introduced, and the second (week 2) six months after. Data on what products were advertised were linked to data on how many people watched each advertisement. Nutritional content of foods advertised was added to the dataset and used to calculate HFSS status. Relative exposure was calculated as the proportion of all advertising person-minute-views (PMVs) that were for HFSS foods. 1,672,417 advertising PMV were included. 14.6% of advertising PMV were for food and 51.1% of these were for HFSS food. Relative exposure of all viewers to HFSS food advertising increased between study weeks 1 and 2 (odds ratio (99% confidence intervals)â=â1Â·54 (1Â·51 to 1Â·57)). Exposure of children to HFSS food advertising did not change between study weeks 1 and 2 (odds ratio (99% confidence intervals)â=â1Â·05 (0Â·99 to 1Â·12)). There was almost universal adherence to the restrictions. Despite good adherence to the restrictions, they did not change relative exposure of children to HFSS advertising and were associated with an increase in relative exposure of all viewers to HFSS advertising. Stronger restrictions targeting a wider range of advertisements are necessary to reduce exposure of children to marketing of less healthful foods.\n\nDesign of a dual linear polarization antenna using split ring resonators at X-band\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAhmed, Sadiq; Chandra, Madhukar\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDual linear polarization microstrip antenna configurations are very suitable for high-performance satellites, wireless communication and radar applications. This paper presents a new method to improve the co-cross polarization discrimination (XPD) for dual linear polarized microstrip antennas at 10 GHz. For this, three various configurations of a dual linear polarization antenna utilizing metamaterial unit cells are shown. In the first layout, the microstrip patch antenna is loaded with two pairs of spiral ring resonators, in the second model, a split ring resonator is placed between two microstrip feed lines, and in the third design, a complementary split ring resonators are etched in the ground plane. This work has two primary goals: the first is related to the addition of metamaterial unit cells to the antenna structure which permits compensation for an asymmetric current distribution flow on the microstrip antenna and thus yields a symmetrical current distribution on it. This compensation leads to an important enhancement in the XPD in comparison to a conventional dual linear polarized microstrip patch antenna. The simulation reveals an improvement of 7.9, 8.8, and 4 dB in the E and H planes for the three designs, respectively, in the XPD as compared to the conventional dual linear polarized patch antenna. The second objective of this paper is to present the characteristics and performances of the designs of the spiral ring resonator (S-RR), split ring resonator (SRR), and complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) metamaterial unit cells. The simulations are evaluated using the commercial full-wave simulator, Ansoft High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS).\n\nEffect of Restrictions on Television Food Advertising to Children on Exposure to Advertisements for âLess Healthyâ Foods: Repeat Cross-Sectional Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAdams, Jean; Tyrrell, Rachel; Adamson, Ashley J.; White, Martin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground In 2007, new scheduling restrictions on television food advertising to children in the UK were announced.

They have several disadvantages---large silicon area consumption, high DC resistance and high cost. An attractive approach to address these issues is directly integrating inductors into package substrates, which provide plenty of usage area, low resistance and low cost. The goals of this dissertation are designing and fabricating magnetic and air-core inductors with characteristic low resistance and high quality factor on package substrates. The research work includes three parts which are summarized below. First, the CoFeHfO nanogranular magnetic material developed on Si wafers and package substrates by pulsed DC reactive sputtering were investigated. On Si wafers, the optimized CoFeHfO film has soft magnetic properties. On printed circuit board (PCB) substrates, these magnetic properties degrade due to the rough surface. Surface planarization such as chemical-mechanical polishing can be applied on PCB substrates to reduce the surface roughness and hence improve these properties. Second, on-package inductors with small resistances and high quality factors were designed, fabricated, measured and analyzed. Air-core and magnetic inductors (20 design variations) were built on 8-inch PCB substrates. The DC resistances of these inductors are less than 12 mO, one of the lowest values ever reported. The maximum quality factors can be as large as Ë80 at around 1 GHz for the air-core inductors and Ë25 at 200 MHz for the magnetic inductors. Third, inductor simulation was carried out to study the effects of magnetic materials on the properties of inductors using the Ansoft HFSS software package. The measurement data for the permeability spectra of the CoFeHfO film and the tensor nature of the permeability were taken into account in the simulation. The simulation results matched the experimental data for the inductances, resistances and quality factors.

Compared with the Huygens-Fresnel principle in three-dimensional (3D) space, the proposed model provides an approximate analytical expression to calculate the diffraction field in 2D space. The diffraction filed is regarded as the superposition integral in 2D space. The calculated results obtained from the proposed diffraction model agree well with the ones by software HFSS based on the element method (FEM). Based on the proposed 2D diffraction model, two parallel-plate waveguide power splitters are presented. The splitters consist of a transmitting horn antenna, reflectors, and a receiving antenna array. The reflector is cylindrical parabolic with superimposed surface relief to efficiently couple the transmitted wave into the receiving antenna array. The reflector is applied as computer-generated holograms to match the transformed field to the receiving antenna aperture field. The power splitters were optimized by a modified real-coded genetic algorithm. The computed results of the splitters agreed well with the ones obtained by software HFSS verify the novel design method for power splitter, which shows good applied prospects of the proposed 2D diffraction model.

C.; Duan, L. J.; Liu, W. C.\n\n2018-04-01\n\n3.0T superconducting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system has become the mainstream of modern clinical MRI system because of its high field intensity and high degree of uniformity and stability.

We also perform the magnetic field simulation and shimming analysis of the first 3.0T/850 superconducting MRI system in the world using the Ansoft Maxwell simulation software. We guide the production and optimization of the prototype based on the results of simulation analysis. Thus the magnetic field strength, magnetic field uniformity and magnetic field stability of the prototype is guided to achieve the expected target.\n\nA miniaturized micro strip antenna based on sinusoidal patch geometry for implantable biomedical applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbrahim, Omar A.; Elwi, Taha A.; Islam, Naz E.\n\n2012-11-01\n\nA miniaturized microstrip antenna is analyzed for implantable biomedical applications.

First, this document defines the core products and activities required of NASA software projects. It defines life-cycle models and activity-related methods but acknowledges that no single life-cycle model is appropriate for all NASA software projects. It also acknowledges that the appropriate method for accomplishing a required activity depends on characteristics of the software project. Second, this guidebook provides specific guidance to software project managers and team leaders in selecting appropriate life cycles and methods to develop a tailored plan for a software engineering project.\n\nSoftware analysis handbook: Software complexity analysis and software reliability estimation and prediction\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, Alice T.; Gunn, Todd; Pham, Tuan; Ricaldi, Ron\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis handbook documents the three software analysis processes the Space Station Software Analysis team uses to assess space station software, including their backgrounds, theories, tools, and analysis procedures. Potential applications of these analysis results are also presented. The first section describes how software complexity analysis provides quantitative information on code, such as code structure and risk areas, throughout the software life cycle. Software complexity analysis allows an analyst to understand the software structure, identify critical software components, assess risk areas within a software system, identify testing deficiencies, and recommend program improvements. Performing this type of analysis during the early design phases of software development can positively affect the process, and may prevent later, much larger, difficulties. The second section describes how software reliability estimation and prediction analysis, or software reliability, provides a quantitative means to measure the probability of failure-free operation of a computer program, and describes the two tools used by JSC to determine failure rates and design tradeoffs between reliability, costs, performance, and schedule.\n\nSocio-economic differences in exposure to television food advertisements in the UK: a cross-sectional study of advertisements broadcast in one television region.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdams, Jean; Tyrrell, Rachel; Adamson, Ashley J; White, Martin\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTo document socio-economic differences in exposure to food advertising, including advertisements for foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) as defined by the UK Food Standards Agency's Nutrient Profiling Model. A cross-sectional survey. Information (including product advertised and viewing figures) on all advertisements broadcast in one UK region over one week (6-12 July 2009) was obtained. Food advertisements were identified and linked to nutritional information on the content of advertised foods. UK Tyne-Tees television region. Data were sourced from a UK-wide television viewing panel. Eleven per cent of advertising seen was for food and 63 % of food advertising seen was for HFSS foods. The proportion of all advertising seen that was for food was smaller among viewers in the least v. most affluent social grade (OR = 0Â·98, 99 % CI 0Â·95, 1Â·00). There was no difference in the proportion of food advertising seen that was for HFSS food between viewers in the most and least affluent social grades. Total exposure to both all food advertising and HFSS food advertising was 2Â·1 times greater among the least v. the most affluent viewers. While the least affluent viewers saw relatively fewer food advertisements, their absolute exposure to all food and HFSS food advertisements was higher than that of the most affluent viewers. Current UK restrictions prohibit advertisements for HFSS foods during programmes with a high proportion of child viewers. Extending these to all programming may reduce socio-economic inequalities in exposure to these advertisements and in diet and obesity.\n\nStudy on magnetic force of electromagnetic levitation circular knitting machine\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, X.

Why is such a process needed? Currently, software is tested until deemed bug-free rather than proving that certain software properties exist. This approach has worked well in most cases, but unfortunately, deaths still occur due to software failure. Using formal methods (techniques from logic and discrete mathematics like set theory, automata theory and formal logic as opposed to continuous mathematics like calculus) and software synthesis, it is possible to reduce this risk by proving certain software properties. Additionally, software synthesis makes it possible to automate some phases of the traditional software development life cycle resulting in a more streamlined and accurate development process.\n\nOptimization of the High-speed On-off Valve of an Automatic Transmission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi-mei, ZHAO; Huai-chao, WU; Lei, ZHAO; Yun-xiang, LONG; Guo-qiao, LI; Shi-hao, TANG\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe response time of the high-speed on-off solenoid valve has a great influence on the performance of the automatic transmission. In order to reduce the response time of the high-speed on-off valve, the simulation model of the valve was built by use of AMESim and Ansoft Maxwell softwares. To reduce the response time, an objective function based on ITAE criterion was built and the Genetic Algorithms was used to optimize five parameters including circle number, working air gap, et al. The comparison between experiment and simulation shows that the model is verified. After optimization, the response time of the valve is reduced by 38.16%, the valve can meet the demands of the automatic transmission well. The results can provide theoretical reference for the improvement of automatic transmission performance.\n\nSoftware Defined Radio with Parallelized Software Architecture\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHeckler, Greg\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis software implements software-defined radio procession over multicore, multi-CPU systems in a way that maximizes the use of CPU resources in the system. The software treats each processing step in either a communications or navigation modulator or demodulator system as an independent, threaded block. Each threaded block is defined with a programmable number of input or output buffers; these buffers are implemented using POSIX pipes. In addition, each threaded block is assigned a unique thread upon block installation. A modulator or demodulator system is built by assembly of the threaded blocks into a flow graph, which assembles the processing blocks to accomplish the desired signal processing.

Four weeks of weekday television from 15.30 hours to 18.30 hours was videotaped from a state-owned (free-to-air) television channel popular with children. Food advertisements were identified and their nutritional information collected in accordance with the requirements of the NP model. Nutrient information was obtained from a variety of sources including food labels, company websites and a national nutritional database. From the 60 h sample of weekday afternoon television, there were 1893 advertisements, of which 483 were for food products or retailers. After applying the NP model, 66 % of these were classified as advertising high-fat, high-salt and high-sugar (HFSS) foods; 28 % were classified as advertising non-HFSS foods; and the remaining 2 % were unclassifiable. More than half (53 %) of the HFSS food advertisements were for 'mixed meal' items promoted by major fast-food franchises. The advertising of non-HFSS food was sparse, covering a narrow range of food groups, with no advertisements for fresh fruit or vegetables. Despite the NP model having some design limitations in classifying real-world televised food advertisements, it was easily applied to this sample and could clearly identify HFSS products. Policy makers who do not wish to completely restrict food advertising to children outright should consider using this NP model for regulating food advertising.\n\nEvaluation of tinnitus patients by audiometric configuration.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Su Il; Kim, Myung Gu; Kim, Sung Su; Byun, Jae Yong; Park, Moon Suh; Yeo, Seung Geun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlthough tinnitus patients have different audiometric configuration, we evaluated them using the same approach. Thus we analyzed the clinical features of patients with subjective tinnitus classified according to audiometric configuration. The study cohort consisted of 123 patients with subjective tinnitus who visited the tinnitus clinic from April 2013 to April 2014. Patients with a previous history of otologic disease or migrainous vertigo were excluded. Factors evaluated included pure tone audiometry, tinnitogram, auditory brainstem response (ABR), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). Tinnitus patients could be divided into three groups: Flat, high frequency gently sloping (HFGS) and high frequency steeply sloping (HFSS). HFGS showed female predominance and HFSS male predominance (p<0.05 each). THI score was higher in the HFGS than in the other groups (p<0.05). Tinnitus pitch and occupations varied, but showed specific tendencies in each group. On ABR, the HFSS group showed significant prolongation of wave I, III, and V latencies (p<0.05 each). On DPOAEs, the HFSS group showed significantly lower response rates at 3, 4, and 6 kHz (p<0.05 each). TEOAE normal rates were significantly higher in the Flat than in the HFGS and HFSS groups (p<0.05). Average pure tone thresholds were similar, but threshold values at high frequencies, ABR, DPOAEs, and TEOAEs differed among the groups. Therefore, different access to tinnitus patients could be required according to audiometric shape. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

There are impacts of writing such papers immediately (they can affect the design and structure of the software project itself), in the short term (they can promote adoption and legitimize the software), in the medium term (they can provide a platform for all the literature's mechanisms for citation, criticism, and reuse), and in the long term (they can preserve ideas that are embodied in the software, possibly on timescales much longer than the lifetime of any software context). I will argue that as important as pure software contributions are to astronomyâand I am both a preacher and a practitionerâsoftware contributions are even more valuable when they are associated with traditional scientific publications. There are exceptions and complexities of course, which I will discuss.\n\nSoftware Engineering Program: Software Process Improvement Guidebook\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide experience-based guidance in implementing a software process improvement program in any NASA software development or maintenance community. This guidebook details how to define, operate, and implement a working software process improvement program. It describes the concept of the software process improvement program and its basic organizational components. It then describes the structure, organization, and operation of the software process improvement program, illustrating all these concepts with specific NASA examples. The information presented in the document is derived from the experiences of several NASA software organizations, including the SEL, the SEAL, and the SORCE. Their experiences reflect many of the elements of software process improvement within NASA. This guidebook presents lessons learned in a form usable by anyone considering establishing a software process improvement program within his or her own environment. This guidebook attempts to balance general and detailed information. It provides material general enough to be usable by NASA organizations whose characteristics do not directly match those of the sources of the information and models presented herein. It also keeps the ideas sufficiently close to the sources of the practical experiences that have generated the models and information.\n\nWildlife software: procedures for publication of computer software\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSamuel, M.D.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nComputers and computer software have become an integral part of the practice of wildlife science. Computers now play an important role in teaching, research, and management applications. Because of the specialized nature of wildlife problems, specific computer software is usually required to address a given problem (e.g., home range analysis). This type of software is not usually available from commercial vendors and therefore must be developed by those wildlife professionals with particular skill in computer programming. Current journal publication practices generally prevent a detailed description of computer software associated with new techniques. In addition, peer review of journal articles does not usually include a review of associated computer software. Thus, many wildlife professionals are usually unaware of computer software that would meet their needs or of major improvements in software they commonly use. Indeed most users of wildlife software learn of new programs or important changes only by word of mouth.\n\nSpace Flight Software Development Software for Intelligent System Health Management\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTrevino, Luis C.; Crumbley, Tim\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe slide presentation examines the Marshall Space Flight Center Flight Software Branch, including software development projects, mission critical space flight software development, software technical insight, advanced software development technologies, and continuous improvement in the software development processes and methods.\n\nSoftware attribute visualization for high integrity software\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPollock, G.M.\n\n1998-03-01\n\nThis report documents a prototype tool developed to investigate the use of visualization and virtual reality technologies for improving software surety confidence. The tool is utilized within the execution phase of the software life cycle. It provides a capability to monitor an executing program against prespecified requirements constraints provided in a program written in the requirements specification language SAGE. The resulting Software Attribute Visual Analysis Tool (SAVAnT) also provides a technique to assess the completeness of a software specification.\n\nA compact microwave patch applicator for hyperthermia treatment of cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nChakaravarthi, Geetha; Arunachalam, Kavitha\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDesign and development of a compact microstrip C-type patch applicator for hyperthermia treatment of cancer is presented. The patch antenna is optimized for resonance at 434 MHz, return loss (S11) better than -15dB and co-polarized electric field in tissue. Effect of water bolus thickness on power delivery is studied for improved power coupling. Numerical simulations for antenna design optimization carried out using EM simulation software, Ansys HFSS(Â®), USA were experimentally verified. The effective field coverage for the optimized patch antenna and experimental results indicate that the compact antenna resonates at ISM frequency 434 MHz with better than -15 dB power coupling.\n\nSoftware cost/resource modeling: Software quality tradeoff measurement\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLawler, R. W.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA conceptual framework for treating software quality from a total system perspective is developed. Examples are given to show how system quality objectives may be allocated to hardware and software; to illustrate trades among quality factors, both hardware and software, to achieve system performance objectives; and to illustrate the impact of certain design choices on software functionality.\n\nSoftware system safety\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nUber, James G.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nSoftware itself is not hazardous, but since software and hardware share common interfaces there is an opportunity for software to create hazards. Further, these software systems are complex, and proven methods for the design, analysis, and measurement of software safety are not yet available. Some past software failures, future NASA software trends, software engineering methods, and tools and techniques for various software safety analyses are reviewed. Recommendations to NASA are made based on this review.\n\nAvoidable Software Procurements\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-09-01\n\nsoftware license, software usage, ELA, Software as a Service , SaaS , Software Asset...PaaS Platform as a Service SaaS Software as a Service SAM Software Asset Management SMS System Management Server SEWP Solutions for Enterprise Wide...delivery of full Cloud Services , we will see the transition of the Cloud Computing service model from Iaas to SaaS , or Software as a Service .

It has become as one of the determinant factors for producing high quality software. Even though its importance has been revealed, its current practice in the software industry is still scarce, particularly in Malaysia. Thus, an exploratory study is conducted among software practitioners in Malaysia to study their experiences and practices in the real-world projects. This paper discusses the findings from the study, which involved 93 software practitioners. Structured questionnaire is utilized for data collection purpose whilst statistical methods such as frequency, mean, and cross tabulation are used for data analysis. Outcomes from this study reveal that software practitioners are becoming increasingly aware on the importance of secure software practices, however, they lack of appropriate implementation, which could affect the quality of produced software.\n\nSoftware For Computing Reliability Of Other Software\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNikora, Allen; Antczak, Thomas M.; Lyu, Michael\n\n1995-01-01\n\nComputer Aided Software Reliability Estimation (CASRE) computer program developed for use in measuring reliability of other software. Easier for non-specialists in reliability to use than many other currently available programs developed for same purpose. CASRE incorporates mathematical modeling capabilities of public-domain Statistical Modeling and Estimation of Reliability Functions for Software (SMERFS) computer program and runs in Windows software environment. Provides menu-driven command interface; enabling and disabling of menu options guides user through (1) selection of set of failure data, (2) execution of mathematical model, and (3) analysis of results from model.

Part 1; Software Benefits and Limitations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLalli, Vincent R.; Packard, Michael H.; Ziemianski, Tom\n\n1997-01-01\n\nComputer hardware and associated software have been used for many years to process accounting information, to analyze test data and to perform engineering analysis. Now computers and software also control everything from automobiles to washing machines and the number and type of applications are growing at an exponential rate. The size of individual program has shown similar growth. Furthermore, software and hardware are used to monitor and/or control potentially dangerous products and safety-critical systems. These uses include everything from airplanes and braking systems to medical devices and nuclear plants. The question is: how can this hardware and software be made more reliable? Also, how can software quality be improved? What methodology needs to be provided on large and small software products to improve the design and how can software be verified?\n\nImpact of Agile Software Development Model on Software Maintainability\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGawali, Ajay R.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSoftware maintenance and support costs account for up to 60% of the overall software life cycle cost and often burdens tightly budgeted information technology (IT) organizations. Agile software development approach delivers business value early, but implications on software maintainability are still unknown.

S.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA formal approach to security in the software life cycle is essential to protect corporate resources. However, little thought has been given to this aspect of software development. Due to its criticality, security should be integrated as a formal approach in the software life cycle.\n\nSoftware Epistemology\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-03-01\n\nin-vitro decision to incubate a startup, Lexumo [7], which is developing a commercial Software as a Service ( SaaS ) vulnerability assessment...LTS Label Transition System MUSE Mining and Understanding Software Enclaves RTEMS Real-Time Executive for Multi-processor Systems SaaS Software ...as a Service SSA Static Single Assignment SWE Software Epistemology UD/DU Def-Use/Use-Def Chains (Dataflow Graph)\n\nUsefulness of peak exercise oxygen consumption and the heart failure survival score to predict survival in patients >65 years of age with heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nParikh, Mona N; Lund, Lars H; Goda, Ayumi; Mancini, Donna\n\n2009-04-01\n\nPeak exercise oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) and the Heart Failure (HF) Survival Score (HFSS) were developed in middle-aged patient cohorts referred for heart transplantation with HF. The prognostic value of Vo(2) in patients >65 years has not been well studied. Accordingly, the prognostic value of peak Vo(2) was evaluated in these patients with HF. A retrospective analysis of 396 patients with HF >65 years with cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed. Peak Vo(2) and components of the HFSS (presence of coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, presence of intraventricular conduction defects, and serum sodium) were collected. Follow-up averaged 1,038 +/- 983 days. Outcome events were defined as death, implantation of a left ventricular assist device, or urgent transplantation. Patients were divided into risk strata for peak Vo(2) and HFSS based on previous cut-off points. Survival curves were derived using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank analysis. Survival differed markedly by Vo(2) stratum (p <0.0001), with significantly better survival rates for the low- (>14 ml/kg/min) versus medium- (10 to 14 ml/kg/min), low- versus high- (<10 ml/kg/min), and medium- versus high-risk strata (all p <0.05). Survival also differed markedly by HFSS stratum (p <0.0001), with significantly better survival rates for the low- (> or =8.10) versus medium- (7.20 to 8.09), low- versus high- (< or =7.19), and medium- versus high-risk strata (all p <0.0001). In conclusion, peak Vo(2) and the HFSS were both excellent parameters to predict survival in patients >65 years with HF.\n\nEffect of acute swim stress on plasma corticosterone and brain monoamine levels in bidirectionally selected DxH recombinant inbred mouse strains differing in fear recall and extinction.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrowne, Caroline A; Hanke, Joachim; Rose, Claudia; Walsh, Irene; Foley, Tara; Clarke, Gerard; Schwegler, Herbert; Cryan, John F; Yilmazer-Hanke, Deniz\n\n2014-12-01\n\nStress-induced changes in plasma corticosterone and central monoamine levels were examined in mouse strains that differ in fear-related behaviors. Two DxH recombinant inbred mouse strains with a DBA/2J background, which were originally bred for a high (H-FSS) and low fear-sensitized acoustic startle reflex (L-FSS), were used. Levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin and their metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenyacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were studied in the amygdala, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem. H-FSS mice exhibited increased fear levels and a deficit in fear extinction (within-session) in the auditory fear-conditioning test, and depressive-like behavior in the acute forced swim stress test. They had higher tissue noradrenaline and serotonin levels and lower dopamine and serotonin turnover under basal conditions, although they were largely insensitive to stress-induced changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. In contrast, acute swim stress increased monoamine levels but decreased turnover in the less fearful L-FSS mice. L-FSS mice also showed a trend toward higher basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels and an increase in noradrenaline and serotonin in the hypothalamus and brainstem 30âmin after stress compared to H-FSS mice. Moreover, the dopaminergic system was activated differentially in the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum of the two strains by acute stress. Thus, H-FSS mice showed increased basal noradrenaline tissue levels compatible with a fear phenotype or chronic stressed condition. Low corticosterone levels and the poor monoamine response to stress in H-FSS mice may point to mechanisms similar to those found in principal fear disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nEffect of Acute Swim Stress on Plasma Corticosterone and Brain Monoamine Levels in Bidirectionally Selected DxH Recombinant Inbred Mouse Strains Differing in Fear Recall and Extinction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrowne, Caroline A.; Hanke, Joachim; Rose, Claudia; Walsh, Irene; Foley, Tara; Clarke, Gerard; Schwegler, Herbert; Cryan, John F.; Yilmazer-Hanke, Deniz\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStress-induced changes in plasma corticosterone and central monoamine levels were examined in mouse strains that differ in fear-related behaviors.

The history of software and its development can be traced to the early nineteenth century. All computer systems are designed to utilize the \"stored program concept\" as first developed by Charles Babbage in the 1850s. The concept was lost until the mid-1940s, when modern computers made their appearance. Today, because of the complex and myriad tasks that a computer system can perform, there has been a differentiation of types of software. There is software designed to perform specific business applications. There is software that controls the overall operation of a computer system. And there is software that is designed to carry out specialized tasks. Regardless of types, software is the most critical component of any computer system. Without it, all one has is a collection of circuits, transistors, and silicone chips.\n\nSoftware engineering laboratory series: Annotated bibliography of software engineering laboratory literature\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMorusiewicz, Linda; Valett, Jon\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis document is an annotated bibliography of technical papers, documents, and memorandums produced by or related to the Software Engineering Laboratory. More than 100 publications are summarized. These publications cover many areas of software engineering and range from research reports to software documentation. This document has been updated and reorganized substantially since the original version (SEL-82-006, November 1982). All materials have been grouped into eight general subject areas for easy reference: (1) the Software Engineering Laboratory; (2) the Software Engineering Laboratory: Software Development Documents; (3) Software Tools; (4) Software Models; (5) Software Measurement; (6) Technology Evaluations; (7) Ada Technology; and (8) Data Collection. This document contains an index of these publications classified by individual author.\n\nSoftware Engineering Guidebook\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nConnell, John; Wenneson, Greg\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe Software Engineering Guidebook describes SEPG (Software Engineering Process Group) supported processes and techniques for engineering quality software in NASA environments. Three process models are supported: structured, object-oriented, and evolutionary rapid-prototyping. The guidebook covers software life-cycles, engineering, assurance, and configuration management. The guidebook is written for managers and engineers who manage, develop, enhance, and/or maintain software under the Computer Software Services Contract.\n\nThe Software Engineering Laboratory: An operational software experience factory\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBasili, Victor R.; Caldiera, Gianluigi; Mcgarry, Frank; Pajerski, Rose; Page, Gerald; Waligora, Sharon\n\n1992-01-01\n\nFor 15 years, the Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) has been carrying out studies and experiments for the purpose of understanding, assessing, and improving software and software processes within a production software development environment at NASA/GSFC. The SEL comprises three major organizations: (1) NASA/GSFC, Flight Dynamics Division; (2) University of Maryland, Department of Computer Science; and (3) Computer Sciences Corporation, Flight Dynamics Technology Group. These organizations have jointly carried out several hundred software studies, producing hundreds of reports, papers, and documents, all of which describe some aspect of the software engineering technology that was analyzed in the flight dynamics environment at NASA. The studies range from small, controlled experiments (such as analyzing the effectiveness of code reading versus that of functional testing) to large, multiple project studies (such as assessing the impacts of Ada on a production environment). The organization's driving goal is to improve the software process continually, so that sustained improvement may be observed in the resulting products. This paper discusses the SEL as a functioning example of an operational software experience factory and summarizes the characteristics of and major lessons learned from 15 years of SEL operations.\n\nComputer-Aided Software Engineering - An approach to real-time software development\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWalker, Carrie K.; Turkovich, John J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA new software engineering discipline is Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE), a technology aimed at automating the software development process. This paper explores the development of CASE technology, particularly in the area of real-time/scientific/engineering software, and a history of CASE is given. The proposed software development environment for the Advanced Launch System (ALS CASE) is described as an example of an advanced software development system for real-time/scientific/engineering (RT/SE) software. The Automated Programming Subsystem of ALS CASE automatically generates executable code and corresponding documentation from a suitably formatted specification of the software requirements. Software requirements are interactively specified in the form of engineering block diagrams. Several demonstrations of the Automated Programming Subsystem are discussed.\n\nAutonomous robot software development using simple software components\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurke, Thomas M.; Chung, Chan-Jin\n\n2004-10-01\n\nDeveloping software to control a sophisticated lane-following, obstacle-avoiding, autonomous robot can be demanding and beyond the capabilities of novice programmers - but it doesn\"t have to be. A creative software design utilizing only basic image processing and a little algebra, has been employed to control the LTU-AISSIG autonomous robot - a contestant in the 2004 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC). This paper presents a software design equivalent to that used during the IGVC, but with much of the complexity removed. The result is an autonomous robot software design, that is robust, reliable, and can be implemented by programmers with a limited understanding of image processing. This design provides a solid basis for further work in autonomous robot software, as well as an interesting and achievable robotics project for students.\n\nNASA software documentation standard software engineering program\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe NASA Software Documentation Standard (hereinafter referred to as Standard) can be applied to the documentation of all NASA software. This Standard is limited to documentation format and content requirements. It does not mandate specific management, engineering, or assurance standards or techniques. This Standard defines the format and content of documentation for software acquisition, development, and sustaining engineering. Format requirements address where information shall be recorded and content requirements address what information shall be recorded. This Standard provides a framework to allow consistency of documentation across NASA and visibility into the completeness of project documentation. This basic framework consists of four major sections (or volumes). The Management Plan contains all planning and business aspects of a software project, including engineering and assurance planning. The Product Specification contains all technical engineering information, including software requirements and design. The Assurance and Test Procedures contains all technical assurance information, including Test, Quality Assurance (QA), and Verification and Validation (V&V). The Management, Engineering, and Assurance Reports is the library and/or listing of all project reports.\n\n48 CFR 227.7202 - Commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-10-01\n\n... software and commercial computer software documentation. 227.7202 Section 227.7202 Federal Acquisition...

A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nEarth science attempts to understand how the earth works. This research often depends on software for modeling, processing, inverting or imaging. Freely sharing open-source software is essential to prevent reinventing the wheel and allows software to be improved and applied in ways the original author may never have envisioned. For young scientists, releasing software can increase their name ID when applying for jobs and funding, and create opportunities for collaborations when scientists who collect data want the software's creator to be involved in their project. However, we frequently hear scientists say software is a tool, it's not science. Creating software that implements a new or better way of earth modeling or geophysical processing, inverting or imaging should be viewed as earth science. Creating software for things like data visualization, format conversion, storage, or transmission, or programming to enhance computational performance, may be viewed as computer science. The former, ideally with an application to real data, can be published in earth science journals, the latter possibly in computer science journals. Citations in either case should accurately reflect the impact of the software on the community. Funding agencies need to support more software development and open-source releasing, and the community should give more high-profile awards for developing impactful open-source software. Funding support and community recognition for software development can have far reaching benefits when the software is used in foreseen and unforeseen ways, potentially for years after the original investment in the software development. For funding, an open-source release that is well documented should be required, with example input and output files. Appropriate funding will provide the incentive and time to release user-friendly software, and minimize the need for others to duplicate the effort. All funded software should be available through a single web site\n\nSoftware archeology: a case study in software quality assurance and design\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMacdonald, John M; Lloyd, Jane A; Turner, Cameron J\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIdeally, quality is designed into software, just as quality is designed into hardware.
