        "text": "Testing in space is expensive and time consuming. In cases where in-space testing is possible the data that can be collected is extremely limited. The combination of these issues poses a significant challenge to space programs and new technologies alike. In response to this, EMA is in the process of building its state of the art Space Environment and Radiation Effects (SERE) test facility. EMA’s goal is to make space evaluations possible for all companies through a complete test facility and modern simulation tools.\n\nEMA’s test chamber contains an array of energy sources from 5keV to >2MeV over a large working area. The combinations of these sources allows for EMA to produce realistic spectra (rather than monoenergetic beams) associated with various orbits. Additionally, EMA’s chamber is also equipped with dynamic shuttering and control capabilities allowing for complete customization of the environment inside the chamber during testing. This allows for complex orbit, eclipse conditions, accelerated lifecycles (etc.) to be evaluated in a single test. With video, spatial arc detection and a number of sensor modalities, EMA’s chamber will be capable of determining the effects of space radiation empirically with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nEMA also understands that testing is difficult and expensive. Some programs have high degrees of risk that need to be addressed in the design stage, or issues that need to be looked at that aren’t possible to test. As a result, simulation presents a capability necessary for space related engineers to have at their disposal. EMA is in the process of developing EMA3D Charge, a fully coupled surface and internal charging simulation environment. Building on the foundation of EMA’s existing space simulation tool, EMA3D-Internal ,EMA3D charge will combine CAD and workflow capabilities familiar to users with the capability to analyze almost any conceivable space radiation environment.\n\nWith its facility located in the Berkshire Innovation Center in Pittsfield, MA, the EMA SERE team comprises some of the world’s foremost experts in the space sector. The SERE team has a wealth of expertise in both simulation and testing and has played critical roles in many major space programs."
