        "text": "A 40% salary disparity between #Milan and #Paris ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· I got a friend who got offered 26k in Milan vs 43k in Paris for the same company and same position That's almost a 40% gap It's well known how Milan is as expensive as other European capitals, however the #salaries are lagging behind Is it the cost of workers for the companies too high? Are the workers in Italy less productive? How can the same company offer such a lower salary for the same candidate in two developed economies like France and Italy? The question remains open *** How can we #attract foreign talents? How can we convince Italians to stay or come back to work in Italy? With these conditions we probably can't\n\nThis is my first post of 2023 and I couldnâ€™t imagine few months ago to arrive at this stageâ€¦ you always hope that this things never happen to someone close to you, but unfortunately on October 1st 2022 the unthinkable happened. My nephew, Stefano, was diagnosed of a rare brain cancer and went on 8+ hours of main brain surgery. Despite the small chance of success a first miracle happened and he survived from the surgery. Now he has to go though a radio therapy to remove the tumorâ€™s residual and his full recovery will be a long and tough journey. Iâ€™ve started a fundraising campaign â€¦ https://gofund.me/4d241eb8 Please help Stefano and his parents to pass this terrible time. Please help me sharing this story and this post to as many people as possible. Thanks to everyone for your help and support #braincancer #help #fundraising\n\nNo mathematical equations have changed our lives as much as Maxwell's. âˆ¯ The stories of discoveries of fundamental theories are quite fascinating and instructive. //A bit of history Maxwell began to formulate the dynamic theory of electricity in 1860. His initial motivation was to develop the laws of electricity in a unified form using the new mathematics. When he began this work, the equations kept turning out to be incomplete. Only by 1864 did he dare to add one more term (displacement current), which was justified only by mathematical beauty. The consequence of Maxwell's equations was an electromagnetic wave. Although today we study this at school, scientists of that time have never seen anything like it. After publishing this article, Maxwell came under heavy fire from his peers. Fate was unfair to Maxwell. He passed away without knowing that he had described all the possible properties of electricity and had built a theory of light. These conclusions were made by Hertz a few years after Maxwell's death. His equations stood the test of time. //What's in it for us? All electronics and radio transmission are based on Maxwell's equations. Economists estimate the contribution of these equations as 40-50% of the entire world economy. A hunch on mathematical beauty is a foundation of a half of our economy! We are on the verge of multiple advancement in neuroscience, synthetic biology, materials and energy just to name few. Deep Tech VCs can help these advancements come to life. Let's make sure we invest in the best teams: those with both entrepreneurial and scientific competence. #science #history #physics #deeptech Tamaz Khunjua"
