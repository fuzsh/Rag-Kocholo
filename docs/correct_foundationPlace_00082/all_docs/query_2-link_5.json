        "text": "Waggoner was praised for his work in advancing the development of fluorescence technologies for biological research, biotechnology and medical diagnostics. He and his research team developed \"CyDyes,\" bright, stable and water-soluble cyanine dyes that are widely used in research, industry and diagnostics for labeling proteins, nucleic acids and other biomolecules.\n\nWaggoner won the 1999 Technical Achievement Award from the Society for Biological Screening for his work in developing fluorescent reagents used by the pharmaceutical industry for drug discovery.\n\n\"Alan is among an elite handful of scientists having the most dramatic impact on fluorescence and imaging in the world,\" said Victor Weedn, principal research scientist and director of Carnegie Mellon's biotechnology and health initiatives. \"His fluorescent dyes are currently the most commonly used in biomedical research.\n\n\"These dyes permit the detection of tens of thousands of molecules on a 'gene chip' that determine the inner workings of a single cell and also permit the interrogation of millions of cells by a flow cytometer.\"\n\nWaggoner is a lead researcher on a project to begin development of a biosensor tool kit that will enable scientists to more fully understand cellular activity as it occurs in living organisms.\n\nThe tools to be developed include an array of optical probes and sensing devices that can be used to detect the different states and functions of cells, tissues or fluids. The project is being funded by a $1 million grant form the W. M. Keck Foundation.\n\nWaggoner, who joined Carnegie Mellon's faculty in 1991, was instrumental in establishing the Center for Fluorescence Research, which later became the STC. In 1994, he joined Amersham as principal scientist and head of fluorescence to promote commercialization of the cyanine dyes he and his research team had developed.\n\nHe returned to Carnegie Mellon in 1999 as director of the STC. Today, the center is working with new optical imaging technologies, advanced fluorescent reagent development and microbiosensors for studying living cells within tissues."
