        "text": "Thanks Jonathan for helping\n\nFirst of all, do you succeed to connect your Matlab 64 bits with TWS ?\n\nIf yes, what is the version of Matlab that you are using ?\n\nOn my side I am only able to connect a 32 bit 2015a version with TWS using API 9 71 06\n\nSomebody in Mathworks tells me he succeeds to connect 64 bit 2019a with TWS using API 9 73, but I am currently checking that with him because he is not a user of TWS, he may believe it works whereas it doesn't. If this is true then the Mathworks developers fixed the issue recently, good !\n\nJonathan, I have tried too often to connect my 2015a 64 bits with TWS using different API and it did not work, so I am skeptical about your steekoo solution, furthermore as there are comments on steekoo itself saying it doesn't work with 64 bits.\n\nDiego,\n\nYou emailed me asking for assistance with this matter, and indicated that you have been blocked with this and need to get it working quickly. You might recall that my email answer was that I do not have the resources or experience for this. (If I already had a solution I would have posted it for you or for Simon.) If I had happened to have the resources then it is doubtful that I could have provided a quick solution.\n\nBut you know who has the resources and the experience and has already extensively tested and documented a solution for multiple platforms? Yair Altman. And he offers a free trial so you can determine for yourself whether his software will work for you.\n\nWhen someone approaches me for something that is going to take extensive effort, I almost always reply back that it is more effort than I am willing to put in as a volunteer. \"Good will\" and \"thanks\" do not pay the bills, and the time I spend volunteering is time I do not spend doing my cleaning, cooking, maintenance, and so on. Volunteering is for short efforts. Yair put much much more than a short effort into getting the broker interface going, and Yair asks to be paid something in return. I have absolutely no problem with that.\n\nIf you have looked at Yair's web site you will see that he has done rather a lot of investigation of obscure aspects of MATLAB and has made the great majority of the resulting information available for free.\n\nPerhaps you are one of the Free Software Foundation proponent who demands that \"Information must be free\", and that all software written must be made openly available, and that programmers should instead make their living by providing services, paid for their time, with the results always to be made public. Perhaps -- but I notice that you did not offer to pay for services in resolving this matter like a true FSF proponent would..."
