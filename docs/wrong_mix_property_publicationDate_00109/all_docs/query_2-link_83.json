        "text": "COMMENTARY zyxwvutsrq The Shorter Foundation of Science Fiction zyxwvutsrqponmlkji Paul Levinson Golden Age, Golden Memes Is there an ideal size for the meme of written science fiction? I have known the answer since I first began reading science fiction when I was twelve years of age. I have returned to that science fiction again and again. I have written essays about it (e.g., Levinson, 1979); it has animated, in spirit if not in content, much of my own fiction; it has been the topic of wonderful discussions with my twelve-year old son, just this summer, as he had the once-in-a-lifetime pleasure of feasting on this food for thought for the first time. The world of science fiction-readers, critics, other writers-has by and large long agreed with this appraisal. Indeed, they awarded this extraordinary work an extraordinary award. And yet the award was somewhat deceptive-not about the quality of the work, but about the form which received the award. Indeed, my first encounter with this work was similarly in a form that cloaked its true origins. The award was the “Hugo” for best all-time science fiction series. The series was of course the zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA Found&ion trilogy, Isaac Asimov’s greatest creation (though his robot stories are a close second). The piece of this I first encountered and devoured when I too was twelve years old was the Second Foundation (Asimov, 1953) novel. I had found it in the paperback section of the adult section of my local public library, having been forced to go there after my Junior High School librarian had told me I could no longer use the school library, if all I kept reading was their (young adult) science fiction. “Reading is like eating,” she had told me, “too much of one thing can make you sick.” I guess it was too late for me, for the oddity of mind that has made me love science fiction above all else in literature-a perspective by which any other kind of writing still pales in comparison, because none other deals with what it is that most makes us human, our capacity to improve the universe, including ourselves, via technology-has stayed with me ever since. So I consumed Second Foundation, and soon Foundation and Empire (Asimov, 1952), and Foundation (Asimov, 1951) before it. I have never read anything else like it-certainly not in fiction, maybe not in non-fiction either-in its philosophic depth and practical import. Years before I read philosophy and learned of LaPlace and de La Mettrie and their notions Paul Levinson.

I read that in the Foundation trilogy. And years before I read how LaPlace’s view was predicated on a closed, deterministic universe-one which I was never inclined to agree with in the first place, since I treasure my free will above just about all else, and hold it not to be an illusion-but years before I read the devas- tating refutations of determinism by philosophers like Karl Popper and W. W. Bartley, III (see, e.g., Bartley, 1978), I read how Hari Seldon’s plan, after succeeding astonishingly in a series of escalatingly dangerous situations, failed at last. Or: it succeeded, but only via the intervention of an insurance policy, an active agency, to intervene when events like muta- tions, inherently unpredictable, conspired to short-circuit the Seldon Plan-though this insurance policy was itself set up by the Plan. And as I came to think about political and economic theory as well as philosophy, I came to realize that, for reasons spelled out in the Foundation series, attempts to predict the future and base iron-clad policy on it, like the totalitarian Marxism of the Soviet Union, were bound to fail. As indeed they did. Just as Club-of-Rome graphs about population and depletion of resources would turn out to be as wrong as Malthus’s, as indeed they were. But there was a literary misunderstanding woven through all of this. Not in the content of the Foundation trilogy-but in the very form “trilogy”. For the Foundation trilogy was not a trilogy at all. It is rather a series of novelettes (usually defined as a story 7500 to 17,500 words in length) and novellas (17,500 to 40,000 words), written over a seven-year period, with the cream of the crop being four novellas or “short novels” that comprise the last two books. Thus, the true hero of science fiction, at least in my book, was never the trilogy nor the full-length novel-it was rather the novella, four of them, published in Astounding (the pre- decessor of Analog) in the 1940s. We turn now to look at how this form came to convey so much. zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaZYX The Parts Greater than the Whole-Because They Are Parts In his In Memory Yet Green (1979a, pp. 311 ff.), Asimov tells us how on the propitious day of August 1, 1941 he took the subway to John Campbell’s office in New York City to discuss an idea Asimov had for a story that would turn out to be the launch of the Foundation series. Campbell was the editor of Astounding Science Fiction, and among the many significant fac- ets of that reported conversation, what stands out the most is that Campbell tells an amazed, flattered, and now worried Asimov that the idea is too big for just a short story (i.e., a story under 7500 words). Asimov asks: A novelette? Campbell replies: “Short stories, novelettes, serials.” I note here-parenthetically, because it’s on the periphery of pertinence to the main agenda of this essay-that Campbell sends Asimov home to do an outline of the series. Asi- mov tries, gets stuck, and writes a novelette instead-the first of the Foundation stories. Asimov observes that he couldn’t work from an outline-not then, or ever. I was delighted to read this, because I feel the same way. I detest outlines-for me the joy, whether in non-fic- tion or fiction, is to keep the narrative alive and fluid in my head, until I actually write it. I only do outlines when absolutely required to sell a book."
