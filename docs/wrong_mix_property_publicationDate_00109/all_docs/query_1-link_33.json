        "text": "This page is both a selected bibliography and a set of links to my posts about ‘classic’ SF (science fiction) books on this blog, focusing on the “classic” authors of the 1950s, gradually extending into later authors I am or plan to revisit.\n\nTitles are novels unless otherwise indicated (cln=collection of stories; nf=nonfiction; omb=omnibus). I’ve read almost all the books on this page, though some not for decades. I plan to work through them again, and post about them.\n\nBy ‘classic’ SF I mean, for now, everything published up to about the mid-1960s, before the ‘New Wave’ of the late ’60s, the commercialization and popularization (think Star Wars) of the 1970s, and the proliferation into subgenres (think cyberpunk) of the 1980s). Collections published later than the mid-’60s are included if they primarily contain earlier material. Eventually there will be other pages for those later eras.\n\nAldiss, Brian\n\n1957.
