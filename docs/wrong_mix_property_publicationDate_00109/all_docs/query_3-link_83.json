        "text": "How Like a God By Brenda W. Clough\n\nn his later years, Isaac Asimov wrote a series of novels tying together the themes that had made his reputation as a fiction writer. The result was one of science fiction's most impressive monuments -- a history of the future spanning more than 20 milleniums, set in a universe that was retroactively revealed as the backdrop for a saga encompassing his Robot, Galactic Empire and Foundation stories.\n\nSo grand was Asimov's vision that although he completed close to 500 books of fiction and nonfiction before his death in 1992, he barely scratched the surface of the universe he had created. Now, three science fiction writers whose own works have been celebrated as Asimovean in scale have undertaken to add three new novels to the saga -- somewhat in the manner of later Roman writers delving into aspects of Olympian myths that their Greek forebears had left unexplored.\n\nThe first book in this new trilogy is FOUNDATION'S FEAR (Harper Prism, $23), by Gregory Benford. (Still to come are volumes by Greg Bear and David Brin.) Mr. Benford, a physicist by trade, takes us back to the early years of psychohistory, the mathematical science of human behavior invented by one of Asimov's most enigmatic characters, Hari Seldon. Forewarned by his equations that the Galactic Empire is about to collapse, Seldon hopes to shorten the inevitable interregnum from a predicted 30,000 years of bloody anarchy to a mere thousand.\n\nMr. Benford picks up the story as Seldon is about to become First Minister to Emperor Cleon I, who rules the 25 million inhabited planets of the galaxy from the imperial capital of Trantor. I have no idea whether anyone unfamiliar with the original Foundation series -- which spells out what happened to Seldon and his predictions -- will be able to make sense of ''Foundation's Fear.'' But for the legions of readers who have long been tantalized by Asimov's cryptic references to psychohistory, Mr. Benford provides some fascinating insights into its development.\n\nThe book's most effective moments come during an excursion to Panucopia, a planet inhabited by creatures that resemble humanity's long-vanished primate relatives. Through technological wizardry, Seldon, the quintessential academic, is able to experience the emotionally intense life of one of these ''pans'' from the inside; he emerges with a new understanding of the preverbal passions that figure so prominently in the human equation.\n\nYou might think that Mr. Benford's scientific training would give him even more insight into the workings of computers. Yet his lengthy forays into cyberspace -- featuring computer simulations of Voltaire and Joan of Arc -- produce largely impenetrable sentences like these: ''The present was a computational slide orchestrated by hundreds of separate processors. Rather than living in the present,'' Voltaire and Joan ''persisted more accurately in the post-past of the calculated step forward.''\n\nSarah Zettel's last book, ''Reclamation,'' established her as an exciting new talent able to work on the largest scale without losing her bearings. Her FOOL'S WAR (Warner Aspect, paper, $5.99) is even more successful.\n\nThe fool of the title is Evelyn Dobbs of the Fool's Guild, a somewhat shadowy organization that provides highly trained ''entertainers, confidants, clowns'' to relieve the morale-threatening boredom of long space flights in cramped quarters. Never has a ship needed a fool's services more than the Pasadena, whose financially strapped owner has put together a crew of brilliant misfits, some of whom are just one step ahead of the law.\n\nProceeding by crafty misdirection, the plot eventually opens up to reveal a mortal challenge to the human-inhabited portion of the galaxy known as Settled Space. Since this challenge involves the unpredictable behavior of sentient computers (artificial intelligences or A.I.'s), the resolution of the problem takes place within the faster-than-light information network that unites Settled Space.\n\nMs. Zettel understands that the essence of cyberspace is metaphor. In the quicksilver consciousness of a human operator who has melded with an electronic network, nothing is tangible. So the language describing this interaction must be as concrete as possible. Here is Evelyn Dobbs trying to establish contact with a rogue A.I.: ''Part of her screamed in horror, but she touched the Live One's outermost skin. It rippled and spiked painfully. She reached deeper. It was like plunging her body's arms into boiling water.''\n\nJack Williamson was 20 years old when he sold his first story to the magazine Amazing Stories in 1928. His latest book, THE BLACK SUN (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), offers the kind of fresh take on standard science fiction themes that one expects to find in the best young adult novels.\n\nThe last shipload of idealistic colonists launched by the bankrupt Mission StarSeed is stranded on a frozen planet circling a ''black dwarf'' sun. The colonists' efforts to survive are complicated by the discovery that Mission StarSeed was actually a front for a massive financial scam, in which their drunken captain and his villainous deputy were major players.\n\nInstead of succumbing to disillusion, a handful of colonists set out to explore their new world in the hope of finding the source of a mysterious flash of light that greeted their arrival. In Mr. Williamson's always lively prose, the working out of this mystery comes to symbolize the triumph of human decency and ingenuity over the forces of human depravity.\n\nHOW LIKE A GOD, by Brenda W. Clough (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95), begins like a hip young adult novel. Rob and his wife Julianne are stressed-out suburban parents of 18-month-old twins. When Rob, a computer programmer, first notices that he can read and control other people's minds, he immediately compares himself to his favorite comic-book hero, the Amazing Spider-Man. When the downside of his new-found mental muscle becomes more apparent -- in his presence the twins start turning unnaturally bright -- he begins talking about ''the weirdness.''\n\nForced to abandon wife and children to save them from himself, he eventually meets an open-minded scientist who helps him discover the surprising source of his ever-growing power. At this point the story takes a turn that it would be unfair to reveal. Suffice it to say that Rob and Ed make an unusual pair of adventurers, and that despite a tendency to bite off more than she can chew, Ms. Clough has an appealingly cheeky imagination."
