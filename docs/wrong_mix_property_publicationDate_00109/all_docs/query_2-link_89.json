        "text": "Dan Abnett, FORGOTTEN\n\nAs they travel between warzones, veterans of the Tanith First and Only gather to tell tales and remember victories past. When it comes to Scout Sergeant Mkoll, his story, reluctantly told, is of a mist-shrouded battlefield in the night and a dangerous presence that lurked in the darkness, preying on the soldiers of the regiment. But just what horror could haunt the Ghosts?\n\nA marvellous return for Gaunt’s Ghosts. Abnett’s (sub-)genre redefining series remains one of my favourites: he managed to update and improve on the established WH40k canon expertly. This short tale reunites us with a handful of fans’ favourite Ghosts, and simultaneously reminds us of how badass Mkoll really is. Forgotten is a perfect example of Abnett’s skill. I can’t wait to read Warmaster, the next novel in the series. It feels like so very long since last we spent any time with Ibram Gaunt and his regiment — Forgotten has completely reignited my interest in and anticipation for the series.\n\n*\n\nMike Lee, NONE MORE LOYAL\n\nCrimson Fists Sergeant Galleas and his squad are assigned to aid an inquisitor who hunts a notorious renegade Space Marine. Setting out to entrap the traitor, the Crimson Fists soon find themselves surrounded and in danger – and their enemy may know them as well as they know themselves, as an ancient and deadly secret is revealed.\n\nThis was a pretty good short story. The plot is balanced quite well, between action and… not-action (I wouldn’t go so far as to say “peace”). It’s an interesting premise, with a couple of twists that I didn’t see coming (although, looking back on it, one thing is a bit telegraphed — unless it’s just something I missed, being less familiar now with WH40k than I am with the Horus Heresy series). The ending wasn’t bad, but it could have been better, I think. There were a few moments when the pace and momentum dipped precipitously, which ended up robbing the story of some of its impact, so I think this could have been tighter. Nevertheless, a decent read with plenty of the elements that go into a very good WH40k story (or military sci-fi story in general).\n\n*\n\nGav Thorpe, THE VALUE OF FEAR\n\nThe Raven Guard under Corax continue to gather all leaderless loyalists to their banner, determined to take the fight to Horus and his heretics. In the industrial nightmare of the underhive, the XIXth Legion receive a lesson in terror tactics from the most unlikely of allies – the Night Lords…\n\nThis was a very cool short story — uncluttered, focused, and original. I enjoyed the different approach to the story, the mix of Legions involved, not to mention the duelling approaches to war that appear diametrically opposed but could work in concert rather well. Very cool indeed, I wish there was more readily-available Heresy fiction from Thorpe (he’s written a couple of the limited edition novellas, which have yet to make the transition to eBook). Definitely recommended. I’m just sad it was not longer.\n\n*\n\nChris Wraight, BROTHERHOOD OF THE MOON\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion within his Legion, Jaghatai Khan ordered the trials of his wayward sons to determine whether or not they would atone. The proud Terran legionary Torghun Khan now stands before his accusers, and must account for the events that could have led him into outright heresy…\n\nPicking up the story begun in Wraight’s Scars and Brotherhood of the Storm…, this is a pretty good extension. It doesn’t offer a huge amount of extra detail, nor greater understanding (it’s a little too vague and teaser-esque, really), but it is well-written and engaging throughout. If you’ve read and enjoyed Wraight’s aforementioned Horus Heresy stories, then I think you’ll enjoy this, too.\n\n*\n\nThese short stories are currently available only through Black Library’s website: Forgotten, None More Loyal, The Value of Fear, Brotherhood of the Moon,\n\nToday, we have an excerpt from Alan Finn‘s Things Half in Shadow, a historical and supernatural thriller. Published by Gallery Books in the US today, here is the synopsis:\n\nPostbellum America makes for a haunting backdrop in this historical and supernatural tale of moonlit cemeteries, masked balls, cunning mediums, and terrifying secrets waiting to be unearthed by an intrepid crime reporter.\n\nThe year is 1869, and the Civil War haunts the city of Philadelphia like a stubborn ghost. Mothers in black continue to mourn their lost sons. Photographs of the dead adorn dim sitting rooms. Maimed and broken men roam the streets. One of those men is Edward Clark, who is still tormented by what he saw during the war. Also constantly in his thoughts is another, more distant tragedy — the murder of his mother at the hands of his father, the famed magician Magellan Holmes… a crime that Edward witnessed when he was only ten.\n\nNow a crime reporter for one of the city’s largest newspapers, Edward is asked to use his knowledge of illusions and visual trickery to expose the influx of mediums that descended on Philadelphia in the wake of the war. His first target is Mrs. Lucy Collins, a young widow who uses old-fashioned sleight of hand to prey on grieving families. Soon, Edward and Lucy become entwined in the murder of Lenora Grimes Pastor, the city’s most highly regarded — and by all accounts, legitimate — medium, who dies mid-séance. With their reputations and livelihoods at risk, Edward and Lucy set out to find the real killer, and in the process unearth a terrifying hive of secrets that reaches well beyond Mrs. Pastor.\n\nBlending historical detail with flights of fancy, Things Half in Shadow is a riveting thriller where Medium and The Sixth Sense meet The Alienist — and where nothing is quite as it seems…\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI rather enjoyed Evie Manieri‘s debut, Blood’s Pride (first in the Shattered Kingdoms series). Since then, I’ve been rather eagerly awaiting the sequel, Fortune’s Blight — whose publication, thankfully, is fast approaching. I just found the US cover, too (above left). The novel will be published in eBook on December 30th in the UK by Jo Fletcher Books, with the hardcover to follow on January 1st. The novel is due to be published in February 2015 in the US by Tor Books. (These are the publishers’ dates — I’ve seen slightly different release dates mentioned on retail sites.)\n\nHere’s the UK synopsis:\n\nVictory for the Shadari rebels has come at a terrible price. Hardship, superstition and a murderous cabal poison King Daryan’s young regime, but help is nowhere to be found: the mercenary who led their rebellion has vanished, their Nomas allies have troubles of their own, and the Norlanders who returned home to plead – or fight – for the Shadari’s independence have found themselves embroiled in the court politics of an empire about to implode.\n\nAs the foundations of the two far-flung countries begin to crack, an enigmatic figure watches from a tower room in Ravindal Castle. She is old, and a prisoner, but her reach is long, and her patience is about to be rewarded…\n\nAlso on CR: Interview with Evie Manieri; Guest Post (“Why I Write Fantasy”)\n\nThis is easily one of my most anticipated novels of 2015 — I am a big fan of Adrian Tchaikovsky‘s writing, despite being woefully behind on his truly epic Shadows of the Apt fantasy series. I mentioned this novel before on the blog, but Tor unveiled the final cover artwork, so I get to share it again. Guns of the Dawn is a stand-alone fantasy, and it sounds really interesting:\n\nDenland and Lascanne have been allies for generations, but now the Denlanders have assassinated their king, overthrown the monarchy and marched on their northern neighbour. At the border, the war rages; Lascanne’s brave redcoats against the revolutionaries of Denland.\n\nEmily Marshwic has watched the war take her brother-in-law and now her young brother. Then comes the call for more soldiers, to a land already drained of husbands, fathers and sons. Every household must give up one woman to the army and Emily has no choice but to join the ranks of young women marching to the front.\n\nIn the midst of warfare, with just enough training to hold a musket, Emily comes face to face with the reality: the senseless slaughter; the weary cynicism of the Survivor’s Club; the swamp’s own natives hiding from the conflict.\n\nAs the war worsens, and Emily begins to have doubts about the justice of Lascanne’s cause, she finds herself in a position where her choices will make or destroy both her own future and that of her nation.\n\nGuns of the Dawn is published in the UK by Tor Books, on February 12th, 2015. I can’t wait to get my mitts on it.\n\nIn the same post (linked above), Tor shared information about Adrian’s other two 2015 releases, Children of Time and The Tiger and the Wolf. Here’s what they had to say about the novels: Children of Time (publication date unconfirmed at the moment) is\n\n“Adrian’s first science fiction novel – and it’s epic. The last remnants of humanity left a dying earth behind, desperate to find a new home. Then when they finally find it, terror is waiting. Think Battlestar Galactica meets Alien – dramatic, stirring and a story with big themes. People seeking a sense of wonder will find everything they need here.”\n\nThe Tiger and the Wolf (due to be published November 19th, 2015) is the start of a new epic fantasy series:\n\n“[T]he story of a young girl who is able to shift into the two forms – that of a wolf of her own clan – but also that of their mortal enemies – the tiger. It’s a coming-of-age story about the choices she has to make to decide where she belongs set against a backdrop of warfare and politics. Fantastically-written and a rip roaring read.”\n\nSo yeah: 2015 could become the Year of Adrian Tchaikovsky…\n\nA little while back, Headline began publishing some of Octavia E. Butler‘s critically-acclaimed backlist in the UK. I haven’t read any of the novels, yet, but I fully intend to do so. In the US, Open Road Media started releasing some of the author’s earlier novels in eBook, and were kind enough to let me run this excerpt from Wild Seed, part of the Patternist Series — which also includes Mind of My Mind, Clay’s Ark and Patternmaster. Here’s the synopsis:\n\nWhen two immortals meet in the long-ago past, the destiny of mankind is changed forever\n\nFor a thousand years, Doro has cultivated a small African village, carefully breeding its people in search of seemingly unattainable perfection. He survives through the centuries by stealing the bodies of others, a technique he has so thoroughly mastered that nothing on Earth can kill him. But when a gang of New World slavers destroys his village, ruining his grand experiment, Doro is forced to go west and begin anew. He meets Anyanwu, a centuries-old woman whose means of immortality are as kind as his are cruel. She is a shapeshifter, capable of healing with a kiss, and she recognizes Doro as a tyrant. Though many humans have tried to kill them, these two demi-gods have never before met a rival. Now they begin a struggle that will last centuries and permanently alter the nature of humanity.\n\nContinue reading →"
