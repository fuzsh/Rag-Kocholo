        "text": "I’m getting really into reading second hand science fiction from the\n\n1950s onwards. I read a few (but nowhere near all) of the Foundation\n\nseries as a child, and I remember liking them a lot. Stolen from Wikipedia\n\nas well as other online sources, here is a list of the books in The\n\nFoundation series in Asimov’s suggested reading order:\n\nYear Title Notes 1950 I,\n\nRobot Robot\n\nshort stories. First collection,\n\nwhich were all included in The Complete Robot, though it also contains\n\nbinding text (Mind and Iron), no longer in The Complete Robot. 1964 The\n\nRest of the Robots Robot\n\nshort stories. This collection\n\nisn’t recommended, as the stories appear in The\n\nComplete Robot as well. 1982 The\n\nComplete Robot Robot\n\nshort stories. Collection of\n\nAsimov stories written between 1940 and 1976. 1986 Robot\n\nDreams Robot\n\nshort stories. Anthologized in a\n\nbook with the same title. 1990 Robot\n\nVisions Robot\n\nshort stories. Anthologized in a\n\nbook with the same title. This\n\ncollection contains Mirror Image, which is referenced in The Robots Of\n\nDawn and occurs after The Naked Sun. 1992 The Positronic Man Robot novel based on\n\nAsimov’s short story The Bicentennial Man, co-written by Robert\n\nSilverberg. 1954 The\n\nCaves of Steel Robot novel. 1957 The\n\nNaked Sun Robot novel. 1983 The\n\nRobots of Dawn Robot novel. 1985 Robots\n\nand Empire Robot novel. 1993 Isaac\n\nAsimov’s Caliban Caliban trilogy by Roger\n\nMacBride Allen. These three books were quite hard to get, as they’re no\n\nlonger for sale. 1994 Isaac\n\nAsimov’s Inferno Caliban trilogy by Roger\n\nMacBride Allen. These three books were quite hard to get, as they’re no\n\nlonger for sale. 1996 Isaac\n\nAsimov’s Utopia Caliban trilogy by Roger\n\nMacBride Allen. These three books were quite hard to get, as they’re no\n\nlonger for sale. 1951 The\n\nStars, Like Dust Galactic Empire series. 1952 The\n\nCurrents of Space Galactic Empire series. 1950 Pebble\n\nin the Sky Galactic Empire series. 1988 Prelude\n\nto Foundation Foundation novel. 1993 Forward\n\nthe Foundation Foundation novel.\n\nFinished by Asimov’s wife after his death from unfinished work.\n\nCombines a series of short stories: “Forward the Foundation”, became\n\nPart I, “Eto Demerzel”. “Cleon the Emperor” became Part II, “Cleon I”,\n\nand “The Consort” became Part III, “Dors Venabili”. Also includes\n\n“Wanda Seldon” and “Epilogue”. 1951 Foundation Foundation trilogy. 1952 Foundation\n\nand Empire Foundation trilogy. 1953 Second\n\nFoundation Foundation trilogy. 1997 Foundation’s\n\nFear Second Foundation\n\ntrilogy by Gregory Benford. The general concensus seems to be that this\n\nbook isn’t very good, but the other two are worth reading. Perhaps skip\n\nthis one (although the other two will make less sense unless you read a\n\nplot synopsis of this book). 1998 Foundation\n\nand Chaos Second Foundation\n\ntrilogy by Greg Bear. 1999 Foundation’s\n\nTriumph Second Foundation\n\ntrilogy by David Brin. 1982 Foundation’s\n\nEdge Final chronological\n\nFoundation books. 1986 Foundation\n\nand Earth Final chronological\n\nFoundation books.\n\nNext step, read them.\n\nUpdate:\n\nthis\n\namazon list is also useful as it\n\nhas a guide to the short story books and how they overlap, as well as a\n\nbunch more robot books written by other authors.\n\nUpdate:\n\nthis Foundation\n\nSeries timeline is useful too."
