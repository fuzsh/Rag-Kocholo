        "text": "II. Dual Use\n\nPast the toll plaza the bridge stretched into morning fog and low clouds that obscured bay and sky alike until the center span climbed out of this gray limbo into a brilliant haze through which sun smote the driver’s window and curdled the horizons to brown smutch, while a jet poised like a raptor overhead and thundered in falling glissandi as Highet pressed A/C MAX and turned up the radio to, –first day of spring in the Bay Area record highs expect, punching over to the orotund tones of, –Great American Broadcasting network, your host Tuck Eubanks ladies and gentlemen, the conservative voice of truth, prosperity, and fun, back in a moment, and hurtled down the span’s far side through Redwood City where the only trees to be seen were blue gum eucalyptus and sycamore, past Your Company Name Here 415-282-0110 and SINATRA 4th Show Added Mar 31, tapping the brake as taillights reddened in all lanes ahead, swerving from behind SQUANDR to thread between 386SX and FOOBAR, punching the radio to –clones lowest prices guaranteed at Computer Addict Sunnyvale, downshifting to third then second as Versant, Data General, Hexcel, Informix, and Failure Analysis Associates went by, cutting in front of ELUESIS to brake sharply under a small black billboard in white Futura italic SAVE US FROM WHAT WE WANT as the radio continued, –Caltrans hazmat team on the scene 101 southbound at Moffett three lanes closed, and stabbing the selector again, as if a more congenial reality awaited on another channel, –my friends, I am expounding and commenting on a cultural decay happening in this culture, his hand traveling on to pick up the cellular phone, –Dan Root , please, this is Leo Highet, as traffic locked to a dead stop.\n\n–Dan, it’s Leo. I’m stuck in traffic, 101’s a parking lot. I’ll meet you at the restaurant soon as I can, pulling as he hung up onto the shoulder, accelerating past the stopped cars, punching brakes and horn together and sliding his window down to shout –Asshole! at another driver also edging onto the shoulder, and to swerve up the offramp where again he jammed brakes to join two lanes merging under a stand of blooming acacias, as the radio warned, –Friends it’s alarming but people do judge you by the words you use. Semantech Dynamic Language Cassettes give you the essential power words you need to dominate any, itch rising in his gorge to trigger a violent sneeze contorting his face and leaving it a mask of suspicion until he spied the high cascades of yellow blooms tossed in the caress of a warm breeze, –ah shit! and jammed the window button to slide the glass unhurriedly shut, other hand reaching for the glove box, eyes streaming as he reached for his inhaler and again punched A/C MAX, removing sunglasses to dab at his tearing left eye, glimpsing in the mirror angry red skin under a pale brow as horns blared behind him and the radio asked, –Have you ever wondered if hair transplants are for you? and eased the clutch to inch forward from the offramp onto a six lane divided thoroughfare where he chose his opportunities to advance through gaps and openings among cars streaming in a semblance of purpose complex to the edge of chaos past two miles of low featureless office parks and condominiums shrouded by olive and eucalyptus until SOON YET loomed and, cutting across two lanes, he glimpsed his left eye swollen, his nose reddened and enlarged. –Great, just great.\n\nNear the restaurant door DISABLED PARKING ONLY. Highet parked, the car alarm yelping as he pressed keychain to arm it, and paused in the foyer to ask of an impassive Chinese, –Dan Root? and followed the pointing hand to a bellow of laughter rising over the clatter and din of plates flatware talk and the plume of smoke curled there above the massive figure in white Stetson and black shit with red and white embroidery across the yoke, and he edged down a narrow corridor past a potted ficus and a woman laughing into a pay phone and entered the men’s room where a mirror set upon mauve and avocado tile showed him a face divided, right half normal, left half angry with welts and distended into a despairing expression of forsakenness and misery, the eye a furtive and evil bead in swollen flesh, the lip lifted to expose teeth, as though presenting a threat while the rest of his face apologized for it. He cranked a chrome lever to reel yards of paper toweling into a basin under a faucet that every few seconds pinched off its flow like a prostatitic urethra until he banged the springloaded tap to restart it. The last of the toweling tailed into the sink and he lifted the soaked paper to his face and held it there covering the welts, regarding stolidly the unafflicted yet still unlovely right side until he recoiled –Damn! from moisture seeping at his shoulder, collar, and hair, and flung the toweling onto the floor, turning in vain for another towel dispenser, shaking his wet hands in the air in a desperate mudra of fury, running them through his thinning and awry black hair before reentering the dining room where the massive figure at table six craned his broad neck around and exhaled smoke in greeting.\n\n–Why, you look like sumpin the cat’s all done with.\n\n–And a good morning to you too, Dan. You’re in form.\n\n–Oh, I am. Dim sum, a double corona, and technology transfer. It’s all a man really needs to be happy. Leo, you know Orrin Gate. Orr’s chairman of Gate Cellular. He was out to the ranch after your last shot. I think you met there.\n\n–Yes, good to, pardon my, no towels in the men’s, cut off by an obstreperous fit of coughing at the table behind him, –enjoying the cell phone you sent, very clear signal, never a problem even in the car.\n\n–I’m glad. We are very good at what we do.\n\n–Pull up a pew, boy, here on my right, said Root, handing him as he sat a napkin to dry his face.\n\n–These allergies will kill me yet.\n\n–He’ll have two of these and two of those, Root said, taking from a passing cart four small plates.\n\n–What’s this?\n\n–Duck feet, and these are jellied.\n\n–Excuse me, came a sharp voice, as Highet turned his bad eye wincing into Root’s exhalation of cigar smoke, –This is the non-smoking section.\n\nRoot shifted his bulk and thrust his shoulders back in thunderstruck disbelief. –What did you say, sonny?\n\n–Your smoke is ruining other people’s enjoyment of their meals.\n\nRoot’s pale blue eyes narrowed in the fat ruddy face framed by lank gray hair and beard. The tooled ivory clasp on his red string tie rose gently and gently fell on the placket of his black shirt, and a slight smile widened his mouth.\n\n–I’m Dan Root. And you are? extending a hand which the other man took reflexively.\n\n–It doesn’t mat, annoyance turning to concern as he flinched in Root’s grip.\n\n–Ruin, is it. I guess you don’t know what ruination is.\n\nRoot touched the coal of his cigar against the base of the thumb gripped in his hand.\n\n–Jesus…! as for a fraction of a second the hand writhed in Root’s grip beneath the coal, then was snatched back and cradled like a wounded pet.\n\n–You best put some ice on that.\n\n–You’re crazy! The man backed to his table staring at Root, face lit as with the fire of revelation. Root turned back to the table and set the cigar in an ashtray.\n\n–I sheerly love to take the righteous down a peg. It’s almost worth a spoiled ash.\n\n–Someday one of your victims will call a cop, Highet said.\n\n–That man won’t call a cop. Why, until now, he thought he was Wyatt Earp.\n\nAt his table the man upended a water glass and wrapped ice in a napkin. His companions bent forward in earnest discussion while the man stubbornly shook his head.\n\n–Try the parchment wrapped chicken, Orr. No no, unwrap it first. Now, Leo, what’s all this crap I’m hearing about Superbright problems?\n\nHighet looked distastefully from Root to Gate and back. –Dan, I know what an omniscient view you have from your ranch in the mountains, but some of us down in the trenches\n\n–I just want to know if we get trouble.\n\n–This is a classified program, Dan, I’m not going to start talking technical details to the unsanctified.\n\n–Unsanctified? asked Gate.\n\n–Security, Orr, he’s worried about security.\n\n–That’s right, Dan. We’re not all freelancers like you.\n\n–Simmer down son.\n\nGate cleared his throat. –Perhaps I can start. I’ll express our interest in general terms, so that any inadvertent classifications breaches won’t jeopardize you gentlemen. As I understand it, the Superbright component of the Radiance project is not coming online as quickly as anticipated. Consequently, a secondline component of Radiance may be frontburnered. This second program has aspects of interest to us outside its purposive antimissile envelope. Fair enough?\n\n–Go on.\n\n–Gate Cellular is eager to enter the growing digital information market . To play in this market requires vast amounts of cable. That or satellites. The larger players have a formidable lead in the cable market, but there are parts of the globe where, for political or geographic reasons, cable can’t be laid. Some companies propose to serve these areas with a small number of geosynchronous satellites in high orbit. We think there’s a better way: a few hundred small, cheap, movable satellites in low orbit. Research and development costs are high, so we’re looking for strategic partners.\n\nRoot pulled from a shirt pocket some papers and unfolded them. –Long as we’re bein so circumspect… This is from Aviation Leak. “The Slingshot orbiting interceptors kill incoming enemy missiles by impact. Simple and small enough to be deployed by the thousands, they are little more than a camcorder, a guidance computer, and hydrazine thrusters.” Put a high speed switching network onboard, what’ve you got.\n\n–Slingshot? asked Gate.\n\n–That’s what we’re calling them now, said Highet. –A David and Goliath thing. Little pebble of a missile knocking out an ICBM by kinetic force.\n\n–Or any other target, said Root.\n\n–Dan…, Highet warned.\n\n–As I understand it, Doctor Highet, the Lab wishes to move into more commercial applications.\n\n–Wish has nothing to do with it, it’s a Department of Energy mandate.\n\n–In any case, they’re encouraging Cooperative Research And Development Agreements with industry, correct?\n\n–Yes, said Highet. –But Slingshot isn’t a candidate for a CRADA. It has classified components.\n\n–Orr’s application is outside the defense envelope, said Root, folding the papers. –I say it’s dual use.\n\n–Looked at the right way almost anything’s dual use. But DOE won’t open a CRADA on this, I guarantee you.\n\n–CRADA, who wants a CRADA, I’d sooner have cancer. You’re getting prissy in your old age, Leo. You didn’t talk this way back in the days of Transfinite Polygonics.\n\n–Didn’t have a senator on Appropriations out to hang me then.\n\n–Shit, Leo, you remember when you and Réti and me came up with these orbiters, called em Baldurs then.\n\n–Dan…\n\n–Remember? That weekend at the ranch? Hell, I got patents that overlap all this stuff. You saying I don’t have a right?\n\n–Look, last thing we need right now’s even the appearance of improp\n\n–What’s your damn trouble, Leo? Those Superbright tests?\n\n–Dan, will you shut up before you\n\n–Gentlemen, permit me. The press has suggested, with whatever truth, that delays with Superbright may jeopardize the entire Radiance project, including the Slingshot interceptors. Now it seems to me, if the defense value of Slingshot is seriously questioned, a parallel commercial mission could save it. It would seem wise to have that commercial mission in place before such questions arise.\n\n–Listen to Orr, Leo. He knows his stuff. Orr went to school with Undersecretary Rip Whipple .\n\nHighet dipped a corner of his napkin into his water glass and held it to his swollen face. –Can we get some more tea?\n\n–Doctor Highet, the men’s room is, where? Past that ficus? Thank you. Pardon me.\n\nRoot watched Gate’s departure, then turned on Highet. –What the hell’s wrong with you? Why the hissy fit?\n\n–Whipple’s about to resign, Dan.\n\n–What? How come?\n\n–His Radiance Liaison Office at the Pentagon handed out half a billion in contracts last year, all approved and overseen by the same four people. Turned out all four used to work for him.\n\n–Shitfire. What’s he gone do?\n\n–Back to private industry where he can make five times what he made at Defense.\n\n–And they wonder why they can’t keep good men. But so what, that’s not your problem. What is?\n\n–Got all those patents, Dan, you don’t need me.\n\n–We need Sand Hill Road, that’s Orr, and we need the Beltway, that’s you.\n\n–I’m not exactly Beltway Bob these days.\n\n–Did those test results get leaked? That shot with the sensor problems?\n\n–Jesus Dan let’s, a little louder, let’s call CNN why don’t we. You haven’t seen it in the papers, have you?\n\n–That’s it, isn’t it, that’s why you’re sweating.\n\n–Those results are classified.\n\n–Is there a trail back to Null? You have to tell me that.\n\n–There’s no trail. We’re writing a report to make our own trail.\n\n–Who’s doing the report?\n\n–Quine.\n\n–Who?\n\n–He wrote the x-ray focusing code. And he supervised the shot, along with Dietz. That kid we fired, Thorpe, the scapegoat, he was working under Quine.\n\n–What’s Quine like?\n\n–He’s a fuckup.\n\n–So why are you letting him write this report?\n\n–He and Dietz supervised the test. You know Dietz. So I tapped Quine. I bumped him up to deputy associate director.\n\n–You crazy? Deputy associate of what?\n\n–Of enough rope.\n\n–Slater’s old post.\n\n–I think people will get the message.\n\n–I don’t trust Szabo, he’d use this to get a leg up on me.\n\n–Thought you had that degree thing on him.\n\n–Why waste it? Anyway Quine pulled a fast one on that test, he set up that kid, Thorpe. Very down and dirty. I want to see how he writes it up. His head may yet end up on a stick.\n\n–Better his than mine or yours.\n\n–What do you want with Slingshot, Dan? You know how to do comm sats.\n\n–We want those thrusters of yours, boy. Mine couldn’t keep a bird in low orbit for a year . You’re claiming ten years? Is that for real? With those dinky little fuel tanks?\n\n–Classified.\n\n–Fuck you too. What’s our lead time?\n\n–First tests in August. Next round of CRADAs in November.\n\n–These birds really gonna work?\n\n–Jesus Chr, you sound like Senator Samuel Fitzfuck Chase, are they going to work, they’re tests, Dan, that’s why we do them, because we don’t fucking know. If we knew it’d save us all a lot of time wouldn’t it now.\n\n–Boy, you’re on edge. You need a vacation. Whyn’t you come up the ranch? Take us a couple horses up to Steelhead Lake, catch some trout. Not much snow this year, gonna be an early summer. What do you say?\n\n–Coming up Sunday for those Hertz recruits, aren’t I.\n\n–I mean a real vacation.\n\n–I’m fine.\n\n–Why’s Chase worryin you? Our bud Howie Bangerter chairs that committee.\n\n–Howie and his Mormon butt boys.\n\n–Don’t say that to Orr, he’s LDS.\n\n–You’re kidding.\n\n–I mean it. He’s a deacon or something.\n\nHighet turned to see the blacksuited figure returning past the ficus in the hall.\n\n–Gate know what he’s doing?\n\n–Five years from now he should own this market. We’re talkin billions, boy.\n\n–If the crick don’t rise.\n\n–There you go. That’s my Leo. Don’t you worry now.\n\n–Gentlemen.\n\n–You know, you’re not the only interested party, Dan. I heard from Stone last week…\n\n–Stone! You’re not serious. Any man who’ll play for nickels can’t be trusted.\n\n–Mister Gate, question for you, why do you want a low Earth orbit for comm sats?\n\n–Please, call me Orr. A big reason to go LEO is signal delay. Geo-synchronous sats have a perigree of twenty thousand miles. By the time you’ve bounced your signal off them there’s a perceptible delay. That’s not acceptable for time critical uses.\n\n–Isn’t Motorola on this turf?\n\n–Yes, they are. But they plan to orbit fewer satellites quite a bit higher.\n\n–This seems, I’m just freewheeling here, a system this size seems like a risky commitment for an unproved market and a small company.\n\n–That’s why we’re looking for allies. But the market’s there. If not for cellular, for something else. As I was saying to the vice president, and Root shot Highet a glance while Highet looked bored, –we think of the satellites as delivery systems. We’re still looking for content providers.\n\n–There’s a question in my mind what we get out of this.\n\n–We bring to the table high speed high capacity packet switching and routing technologies. Linking the Slingshots in a networked system could make them viable for a wide range of applications. Weather monitoring, pollution tracking, global positioning…\n\n–Okay, I think I can package that.\n\n–Now let me ask you this. I understand that a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement grants an exemption from the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n–Our working model gives a five year FOIA exemption.\n\n–Good.\n\n–But getting DOE to sign off won’t be easy. Slingshot is a defense program, they’re sticky about that.\n\n–Shit, Leo…\n\n–Surely, pardon me Dan, surely the Department of Energy can be made to see the benefit. Their CRADA program is, from what I hear, unsuccessful so far. This venture could be a showpiece for them, wouldn’t you say? And I understand that Slingshot itself has a shall we say clouded future.\n\n–Can’t speak for DOE, they have trouble seeing the sun on a clear day, but I’ll do what I can. We’ll draft a letter of agreement, see where we go from there.\n\n–Excellent. I’ll fax you our latest business plan.\n\nRoot raised his hand in a scribbling gesture and across the room the manager left the man clutching his wrapped hand and darted over to slide the check under Root’s hand freeing from a gold clip three hundred-dollar bills. Root winked at the manager. –Somethin for the help.\n\nThe three men rose and walked leisurely to the door. Gate said to Root, –I’m sorry Mister Kim couldn’t make it.\n\n–Mister Kim? said Highet.\n\n–Oh, another potential investor, said Root. –He’s kind of a recluse.\n\n–Mister Kim. That Sand Hill Road, Dan? Or Seoul?\n\n–Pyongyang. He he, see his face, Orr? See it. Had him going.\n\nIn the vestibule they threaded through a crowd coming and going, past the phone booth where a wrapped hand rose gesticulating above the partition and snatches of talk emerged from the background din like complexities at the surface of chaotic systems, –got to get back I’m about to slit a cat stem to sternum, and –soon’s I quit I get two offers not even looking, and –Christ it’s hot for March, and two small boys darting either side of them, one shouting, –I win! I’m king of the world! as the three men emerged into sunlight and Root pushed up the brim of his Stetson and dropped the stub of his cigar to the pavement where he ground it to smoldering pulp beneath his bootsole.\n\n–Got you a love note there, Leo.\n\nHighet followed Root’s deliberative gaze from the curve of a horsetail cloud slipping across sky’s pale dome between a stately pair of eucalyptus, leaves shimmering like unheeded semaphores, flanking a squat white savings and loan 11:30 82F 28C and finally down to SFORZA and the black vinyl bib stretched across the snout of the red hood into which was tucked a parking ticket.\n\n–Well gents, as the great Karl Friedrich Gauss said, Go you forward and faith will come to you.\n\n–Thank you for your time, Doctor Highet.\n\n–Mister Gate, we’ll be in touch. Dan, always a pleasure.\n\nThe car yelped as Highet disarmed it, Gate flinching from the sound as Root cast an arm around him, saying, –Leo’ll eat anything that don’t eat him.\n\nOn the bridge, hurtling down the far span, the ticket fluttered like a trapped bird till it tore free as the car boomed past a mobile home named for that tribe whose tale of Little Brother, so similar to that of Phaeton and Helios, did not punish but rewarded its hero with wisdom and respect for his snaring of the sun, and raced mere feet above the bay, accelerating past NO TOLL THIS DIRECTION and the leaching pools and the industrial parks, one hand scanning past –it’s your constitutional right! to an orotund voice that had –nothing to be ashamed for! as the freeway broadened to eight lanes sprawled like a flattened snake up green hillsides turning gold so early in the year after –seventh year of drought for Cali, while elsewhere, –flood waters so severe, seemed to demonstrate the chaotic extrema of a global climate under assault by the effluvia of –traffic and weather togeth, until, satisfied for the moment that no news, of himself at least, was good news, Highet silenced the radio and slipped a silver disk into the slot of the CD player to let the doomed guitar of Robert Johnson carry him back to Codornic s EXIT NLY and past the city’s central mall, cutting across a chorus of horns and around Estancia Estates, where CREDNE CONSTRUCTION earthmovers pushed back still further the chaparral behind the open frames of identical unfinished houses, and banners flapped in the hot wind STARTING AT $150,000.\n\nComing then to the main gate of the Lab, fortress city of ten thousand souls behind razorwire, slowing past the demonstrators in their motley, with their handmade signs FRAUD DECEPTION STOP NOW, the darkhaired woman absent today, the woman he’d first singled out for heckling because of her beauty, Highet swerved to flatten a rolling paper cup under his wheel, stopping at the kiosk to show ID, –Morning, Jake, and continuing through the doubly fenced desert of broken rock and motion sensors, into Building 101’s parking lot, RESERVED DIRECTOR, noting with distaste Philip Quine’s battered white Subaru parked at the far end near a yellow backhoe <<ULTRA-DIG>> beyond which rose the terraced adumbration of a building, its southern facade cloaked in mauve and avocado tile while the northern half, an unfinished cliff of raw concrete spattered with pale mud, fell away to a terrain of rutted earth and pools of bright green flux, all enclosed by chainlink and plywood sheets stenciled ADOBE LUMBER and CREDNE, the halfmade bulwark oddly deserted by its builders although the workday was at its height.\n\n–Morning, Dolores, as he entered the outer office, frowning at the radio declaiming in carefully modulated outrage, –typical liburrul modis operendy. He calls my logic cheap and my facts hazy and my reasoning fellatious, until Dolores reached the knob to silence it, and Highet plucked the Ohlone Valley Herald from a box of mail in which a smaller carton held two and a half doughnuts, –Think we can keep the jelly off the correspondence? rounding the desk to come –Ow! hard against heavy boxes sealed with a gray cover sheet Final Environmental Impact Statements and Report For Continued Operation of Laboratories.\n\n–Geez, you look just awful. Take a doughnut if you want.\n\n–Thanks so much Dolores. Might as well, there’s most of one on the newspaper already. What’s all this junk?\n\n–That’s the EIS back from the printers, you wanted three copies.\n\n–Three? Looks like a flat of phone books, prodding one box with a foot.\n\n–It’s seven volumes, six thousand pages. You have calls\n\n–How many of these things did we print?\n\n–Two thousand sets. You have\n\n–I love it, we’re clearcutting the Pacific Northwest to print environmental impact statements. Is Conor here?\n\n–He was. Your new computer arrived. You have\n\n–At least something went right while I was gone.\n\n–You have calls from EPA, DOE, DoD, the university regents’ office, Philip Quine, Bernd Dietz, Doctor Réti, Senator Chase, the vice president\n\n–Of what?\n\n–Of the United States.\n\n–God, I love to hear those words. You put all this on the mojo?\n\n–No the network is down, that’s why I’m telling you. Also William Venham, your sister Thea, and Cedars-Sin\n\n–Why’s the network down? Conor! Get him in here.\n\n–and you have a one o’clock\n\n–Don’t remind me, as he pushed open the inner office door and the voice rose up again behind him, –my friends, it’s demonstrative that, and the door swinging wide banged a tower of cartons, –Fuck! toppling them in a spill of bubblewrap, styrofoam, spiralbound manuals, warranty cards, and cables bagged in plastic across the floor to where a black box aXon with matching monitor, keyboard, and printer sat on his desk. Highet put down the newspaper and the doughnut and his blunt fingers touched its matte surface, which took briefly their sweaty imprint then swallowed it like mist , as Conor entered yawning, slim to frailty in a black t-shirt SEROTONIN C10H12N2O, fine black hair in a ponytail, trim mustache and beard, a reliably complaisant witness to Highet’s pleasure or displeasure.\n\n–Sorry about the mess, boss, I’ll clean it up. I didn’t know if you wanted to keep the boxes. What’s wrong with your face?\n\n–My face? Not a thing. Feel good about yourself, Conor, the world will love you. Is this thing sexy or what?\n\n–It rocks. Conor stooped to gather cables, deftly mating socket to plug, snugging keyboard and mouse. The machine gave out a suave chord and the screen lit with chiseled icons bright along its border.\n\n–The operating system was written for aXon by grad students at Cambridge. They got chump change, and the aXon execs are all driving Ferraris. What is it about you students, you’re supposed to be so smart.\n\n–We are Zen mind.\n\n–Is that why you took the network down so I have to collect my messages by sneakernet?\n\n–Mu, o master. We had a little incident. Somebody put some pornographic GIF files up on an open server. We had to take it offline. Unfortunately it was also a mail server.\n\nHighet grimaced. –Christ, don’t people have anything better to do with themselves? How long were the files there?\n\n–The creation dates vary. Days, months, don’t know.\n\n–This was on an open server? Save the files, I want to know what’s going on there. Now what about my mail?\n\n–Behold the little mailbox. Every time you boot, he knows to check for spooled mail on the server, and there, leaning in to smartly tap the black teardrop mouse, –you are.\n\n–Are those my messages from Dolores? Okay, you can keep your job. But get rid of these empty boxes.\n\n–Do you want to store them?\n\n–You kidding? Shitcan them.\n\n–And the manuals?\n\n–We don’t need no stinkin manuals, pivoting with one hand to type in his password - - - - - - and burst open the iconic mailbox as Conor hovered nosily.\n\n–Chaos on the edge of complexity?\n\n–Just the usual noise. Now clear out of here and let me start taking out the trash. Come by at four and we’ll talk about your Rayleigh-Taylor project.\n\n–Cool.\n\nAs the door closed Highet slumped back in his chair. His breath came harshly and with suspensions. In his bowels dim sum moved restlessly. Opening his eyes he stared blankly at a slick card aXon Warranty Tell Us About Yourself, picked it up, and flipped it spinning to ricochet from the lip of the trash can to the carpet.\n\nHe took the Ohlone Valley Herald and cellular phone into his private bathroom, resting the newspaper on the sinktop while he unfolded the phone, loosened his belt, lowered his pants, settled sighing onto the seat, and then punched SEND. –Dolores? Get me an hour in the gym at four. Yes I know, don’t remind me, punching END, raising the newspaper to Grand Jury Indicts 4 LA Cops, Estancia Expansion Given Green Light, turning to the editorial page where, –Son of a! welts on his face reddened as he took the phone, selected a number from its display, punched SEND and waited. –Doctor Réti please. It’s Leo Highet, and scanned the text, post-Cold War era, needless expense, environmental hazards, peace dividend. –Aron, have you seen today’s Herald? What? Oh, that went fine, I think Gate’s on board. But the Herald, listen to this, lead editorial, Stop Nuclear Testing Now. What is this crap? We employ ten thousand people, we made this fucking cow town, where does he get off? No, don’t placate me! I don’t care about the editorial, paper’s a joke and everybody but Greer knows it, I just want to know why he’s getting feisty. And it’s not just him, I’ve got calls in from Chase, DoD, DOE, the vice president I mean what’s going on? Who’s talking to who? Yes I’ll be here the rest of, wait, got a meeting at one but I’ll have Dolores put you through. Find out what you can, pressing END, and the phone instantly trilled in his hand and he shifted his nates, sighing. –Highet. What is it, Dolores. Tell her, no, never mind, I’ll take it. Hello Thea, how’s mother. Uh huh. Yes I did. Well, they’ve done what they can. If it’s chronic, there’s nothing… no, I, look, Thea, she’s seventy-eight years old, she’s had a full life. No. No I can’t poss. Well, you do what you like but I. Thea, are you listening? I just said I can’t. I run a billion dollar laboratory here, I can’t just take a week off and come to Lancaster, it’s out of the. Look, don’t start. Call Mark and hassle him why don’t you. Uh huh. Thea, lis, Thea, listen to me. I’m hanging up. I don’t have time for this. I’ll call you when you’ve got mother home. Goodbye, Thea, pressing END, –Jesus suffering Christ, and dialing again to wait through, –Thank you for calling the Ohlone Valley Herald, if you know the extension of, and punched 4 3 1, refolding the newspaper and spooling off a length of toilet paper while waiting through –J Frank Greer is not in his office right now. If you would like to leave a message, please wait for the tone.\n\n–J Frank, it’s Leo Highet. You know, out at the lab, where your son works, I’m in a small room with funny furniture. Your editorial is in front of me. Highet rustled toilet paper at the mouthpiece. –Now it’s behind me. He snapped shut the phone.\n\nHe rose then, wiped and flushed, gazing like a haruspex at the spiral arms of the swirl as the auguries were swept away. Red pepper, sausage, pasta. Fragments rose in the ebb unflushed and he flushed again. In the miasma was a faint scent of asparagus. he washed his hands. At the doorway, hitching his belt, he thumbed on a fan and shut the door behind him as both desk phone and cellular phone trilled together.\n\n–Already? Thank you Dolores. He glanced at his watch, and took a folder from the desk drawer, opening it to confirm its contents and stepped over the threshold where the toe of his loafer came down on aXon Warranty Tell Us skidding him past Dolores startled from YOUR IMAGE YOUR SUCCESS How To Polish Your Management Style to turn down –friends, I am the epitome of, as he caught his balance to stride out and down the hall, pausing outside the conference room just long enough to hear, –therfucker can’t imagine anyone doing anything for decent reasons, he thinks everybody has an agend, silenced by his entrance into air stifling as a bunker under high sealed windows like embrasures.\n\n–Morning Leo.\n\nDietz, Szabo, Karp, Quine, sitting there, sweltering, jackets over their chairs, shirts spotted with sweat. Looking at his swollen face. No one saying what they thought. Highet laid down his papers, put on halfglasses, and remained standing.\n\n–Like an inferno in here, what’s the problem?\n\n–I called physical plant. They say the air conditioner’s screwed up.\n\n–That’s really great, we need physical plant to tell us that?\n\n–They say they’re working on it.\n\n–What about the other conference room?\n\n–They’re painting it.\n\n–I thought we painted it last year. Oh, I remember, one of those idiotic use it or lose it budget items. Speaking of which, where’s Kihara? I asked him to be here.\n\n–He, ah, said he had a brush fire to put out.\n\n–He say what it was?\n\n–Something about an EIS.\n\n–Frank, did you take that meeting with Jeremy Rector this morning?\n\n–Yes, sir. Him and two other federal-looking gentlemen from the General Accounting Office.\n\n–And?\n\n–They’ll be back.\n\n–Okay, let’s start without Kihara. Yes, what is it, Bernd?\n\nDietz rose and held out a white envelope, its end trembling. –I must tell you. I cannot continue here. For a long time I have known this. I hear rumblings, it is like a great building with a bad foundation, a few cracks appear, the collapse begins, no, I cannot stay on, this is my resignation.\n\n–Bernd, sit down…\n\n–Last night someone from CNN calls my home, to ask about charges of fraud.\n\n–Did this someone identify himself?\n\n–Armand Steradian.\n\n–Wasn’t he that PBS guy used to hang around here, Leo?\n\n–Ex-PBS. After that backstabbing special of his I made some calls. He’ll never work for them again. What did you tell him, Bernd?\n\n–Nothing! But I can read the writing.\n\n–Bernd, you’re overreacting. This is nothing more than our friend Chase leaking rumors. If he had anything real, he wouldn’t be phoning in anonymous tips to Chicken Noodle News. Show some nerve. He’s just waiting for someone to bolt.\n\n–But I tell you I cannot\n\n–Bernd. Do me a favor. Put that envelope back in your pocket. Keep it there over the weekend. If you still feel this way on Monday, we’ll talk.\n\nHighet looked around at the rest of them. Not saying what they thought. Sweat ran down his ribs.\n\n–I’m glad Bernd brought this up. It’s stressful but it’s nothing new. The Radiance program has some unresolved issues, we know this. We also know that we can resolve them. But in the meantime our critics are getting vocal. Is there anyone here who can’t take the heat?\n\nDietz glanced at Quine. The others held their poker faces.\n\n–Okay. Let’s move on to business. You all know how DOE is talking up dual use technologies. We hear this so often, the old plowshare polka.\n\n–Dual use technologies, said Szabo. –I’ve got one of those in my pants.\n\n–Thanks Frank, I’m sure we all\n\n–Looked so nice out this morning I’d thought I’d\n\n–appreciate your wit. Here’s my point. This is an opportunity. We can start moving Radiance technologies under the dual use envelope.\n\n–What about the GAO investigation? asked Karp.\n\n–I’m not worried. The report isn’t due for a few months. You’ve all given your interviews, right?\n\nQuine was readying to speak. That habitual wounded look. Always about to flinch. As Quine’s mouth opened, Highet spoke.\n\n–Philip, you were reviewing the recent Superbright tests. Where are you on that?\n\n–I’m finished, pulling several spiralbound xeroxes from a black nylon carryall.\n\nHighet stared in disbelief. –I thought your timeframe was longer.\n\n–I’m done.\n\n–Well, hold those. It’s not appropriate to discuss them now. Not till we’ve all seen them.\n\nThe wounded reproach in Quine’s eyes did not flinch but hardened. –I thought I’d distribute them now.\n\n–I said hold them.\n\nSomething like rage there now. But no followup. Highet held his gaze for a second longer as Quine fingered the bindings.\n\n–So, future directions. We’ve got CRADAs in x-ray lithography. Fusion research can cover a lot of programs. Frank, talk with P Section and see what all we can get under their umbrella. We’re looking at reduced underground testing, very possibly a full ban. Bitter as that is, it’s an opportunity for computer science, simulation codes, and for hydrodynamic and hydronuclear testing. What else, people? What else can we package?\n\n–There’s the toolmaking code we gave GM a few years back.\n\n–A lot of astronomy stuff could fall out of our adaptive optics work.\n\n–Astrophysics is always good cover.\n\n–We have fabrication techniques that could prove adaptable to commercial manufacturing.\n\n–Very good, thank you, Bernd.\n\n–All this is more like a garage sale than technology transfer, said Szabo. –What about the Slingshot orbiters? Plenty of potential there.\n\nHighet looked thoughtful as sweat slicked his inner thighs. –Really. What kind of potential?\n\n–Well, lots of things. They’re just orbital platforms. Off the top of my head, astronomy, weather monitoring, comm sats…\n\n–What about the classified elements?\n\n–Most of the Slingshot tech is off-the-shelf. It’s a matter of what you put on them. Different hardware, different software, that’s all.\n\n–Can you write a white paper on this, Frank? Identifying areas outside the security envelope?\n\n–Kind of busy right now. But yeah, I could.\n\n–Do it. The rest of you, I want something in writing about programs in your areas.\n\n–Ah, before we, can I just bridge in here? What’s our advantage going after this stuff? Karp leaned crossly forward, bare forearms resting on the conference table’s oak veneer.\n\n–Why, Henry, said Highet, –we get the satisfaction of enhancing America’s global competitiveness.\n\n–So we go from national security to appliances? I’m not very excited about that. I remember the last time we did this crap, designing wind turbines in the seventies. About as sexy as bell bottoms.\n\n–I was there, Henry. Labels change, the work goes on. You all know I’ve got the entire Lab to consider, but you also know this is where my heart and history is. Nuclear design, directed energy weapons, missile defense, this is our work, the work of the age. I won’t let anyone cut the heart out of our mission.\n\n–I hate this shuffle, complained Karp. –We’ll have crackpot realists coming down off the woodwork to get on the gravy train.\n\n–If we don’t get it the pickpockets will.\n\n–That’s right, Frank, said Highet. –I know it’s a pain in the neck. It’s meaningless and it distracts. But rise to the challenge, people. Think of it as diversifying our portfolio. Anything else? Then let’s get out of this fucking sauna. Philip, in my office.\n\nAnd like Virgil quitting the underworld, damp thighs chafing, he led Quine to his office pausing to hold the inner door for the younger man to pass in first, then following him in with a slam. Quine flinched.\n\n–Don’t you ever try that again. Make an end run around me.\n\n–End run? You assigned me this report, you\n\n–Don’t tell me what I did!\n\nQuine dropped the bound xeroxes on Highet’s desk, An Analysis of False Brightness Readings in “Taliesin” Test of Radiance “Superbright” X-Ray Laser Component.\n\n–This is my draft report, submitted for comments exactly according to protocol, exac\n\n–Protocol! Don’t give me protoc, breaking off to grab from the desk an inhaler, glaring over its barrel as he pumped it, then, after inhaling noisily, –Where, just where do you get off, returning this favor I did you, the great favor of letting you head this group, of promoting you to director level, you repay me with this bullshit? I’m speechless. It is understood that you run this kind of report by me privately, first as a courtesy and just incidentally so you don’t make an ass of yourself.\n\n–I’ll risk that.\n\n–No you won’t, you’ll sit down this minute and we’ll go over it line by line. Dolores will clear your afternoon, reaching for the phone which trilled stopping his hand momentarily before he lifted it. –Highet. Yes, Aron, what have you got? EIS? What’s that got to do with. No, it’s just back from the printers I haven’t even opened, it’s six enormous vol. Oh Christ, not those jerks again. All right, don’t worry, I’ll. Yes I’ll deal with them. Don’t excite yourself. Never mind the EIS, I need, never mind it, I need to know about the Taliesin test. The last Superbright shot. Whether those results were leaked. You haven’t said anything to anyone? Okay, I think someone here is selling us out, glaring at Quine. –No one’s called you? Okay. Well, you say no comment, of course. Call me if you hear anything at all.\n\n–I’m not going to do this, said Quine.\n\n–Excuse me?\n\n–I’m not going over this document with you. I’ll put it through channels.\n\n–What do you think you’re playing at, Philip?\n\n–You, you think this is some kind of game, winners and losers, the screwers and the screwed, think you can change reality by, by wishing, by lying by\n\n–People like you, Philip, you suffer reality. I make it happen. That’s not game. It’s serious because you win or you lose. It’s you fucking amateurs who screw things up.\n\nThe phone trilled again. –Dolores, hold my calls. What? Tell him, no, send him in.\n\nDennis Kihara entered bearing six hefty gray volumes cradled in his arms then skidded –Look out! across the carpet, stumbling to a stop at Highet’s desk where he deposited his burden and bent to pick up, –What’s this, Tell Us About Yourself, looks like a warranty c\n\n–I’ll take it, what’s your problem Dennis?\n\n–The EIS, have you seen? well of course you have, here, page IV-C-238 let me, oh sorr\n\n–Dennis, just\n\n–because we wait, let me, Map of Planned Construction, see, right next to Building 101\n\n–Yes, that’s us right where we’ve always been.\n\n–Well it’s, gosh, I reviewed this map myself, and I don’t know how it happened but we have to issue an erraticum.\n\n–What’s the problem?\n\n–Well look!\n\n–It’s a map, it\n\n–No, there, out the window! following the point of Kihara’s trembling finger past the slatted blinds to a bleached sky half obscured by a mauve and avocado facade.\n\n–Don’t like that tile, looks like a men’s room, but what are you\n\n–It’s not there!\n\n–Dennis what are you\n\n–The building, the new building’s not on the map!\n\n–That’s ridic, scanning the foldout graphic and the text across from it dotted with gray overprinting designating changes from the Draft document, –well that’s unfortunate but hardly a major, we’ll just issue an erratic, I mean an erratum.\n\n–We need to send it asap, I have a list, I tried to e-mail you but the network is down.\n\n–List of what.\n\n–Of people and places I contacted.\n\n–You what?\n\n–I just, I, I called some places to advise them that there were problems with the EIS, didn’t go into detai\n\n–Called what places.\n\n–Well I started with our FedEx list. Congressional offices and citizens’ groups mostly.\n\n–Really. Ink’s not dry and you’re on the horn telling CalPIRG CANT Greenpeace and Senator Chase that we have some reality problems, that’s just great, just incredibly efficient Dennis.\n\n–Well thanks I just, you know, it’s my job\n\n–Take the rest of the day off, let me handle this.\n\n–Oh no, I couldn’t, it’s my mistake.\n\n–Yes it is, but you’ve done so much already.\n\nKihara glanced from Highet to Quine uneasily. –Well, I\n\n–I’ll come back later, said Quine.\n\n–No you won’t. You stay right there, transfixing Quine with all the fury he kept from Kihara. –Dennis, what I need from you right now is a list of everyone you called, pushing a blank sheet of paper across the desk.\n\n–Okay, I can email you\n\n–I said now.\n\n–Well, I think I can remember most of… Fumbling, he unclipped from his shirt pocket a blackbarreled pen, nesting barrel in cap as Highet calmly waited and watched Quine.\n\n–You know, Dennis, nobody notices an oversight like this in a document this size unless you point it out to them. What you do is you wait a few months, and then you file an appendix buried in a bunch of other documents. Like a cat you hide your shit in the sand, you follow me?\n\n–Um, yes, okay, I’ll, yes I think so. The pen hesitated and continued.\n\n–But you don’t ever, ever tell the people who want to shut us down that we fucked up. These people are the enemy.\n\n–Sorry, I, here… pushing the sheet to Highet with one hand as the other returned pen to pocket, clipping it in place.\n\n–Don’t apologize, it makes you look weak. Just never do it again. If there’s ever a question in your mind, ask me. You’re sure that’s everyone?\n\n–I, yes I think\n\n–What about CalPIRG?\n\n–Oh yes that’s right\n\n–Never mind, I’ll add it. You get any callbacks?\n\n–Yes, Lynn Hamlin, and Highet saw Quine tense, so he did know her, –from Citizens Against Nuclear Technology, she wants me to speak at a meeting tonight.\n\n–No chance. Forget it. What time is this meeting?\n\n–Six p m at the, ah, First Unitarian Church of Kentwood, open forum on, let me see, the role of the Lab in a post Cold War\n\n–Yes, well, they can open it without you.\n\n–They’ve invited a speaker, Tony Luz.\n\n–Luz? That prick. We went to Caltech together. Makes him think he knows science.\n\n–Well, he’s fairly well known, I thought another point of view\n\n–Adman turned enviro. Don’t loan him credibility. Got a little problem there, Dennis.\n\nA round black stain had spread across Kihara’s shirt pocket where the pen was clipped.\n\n–I, what?\n\n–Your pen is leaking.\n\n–Oh? looking down in confusion to pluck it out with a snap, staring in chagrin at the silver clip on the cap topping the black barrel narrowing to an exposed gold point. He dropped it –Damn! on the desk, touching the stain futilely with fingertips that came away darkened, as Highet pulled two tissues from a box. –Damn, damn… holding the tissues as he gathered the volumes to his chest. Highet followed to push the door shut almost on his heels.\n\nHighet capped the pen and clipped it in his own pocket. He looked at Quine in silence for a moment. –I’m too good natured. I like to give people a chance. Guide them along. Like you, Philip. I promoted you, I gave you this opportunity, handpicked you to manage this report, told everyone to cooperate with you. You let months go by, you don’t talk to me, and now you drop this, this sack of shit on me.\n\n–The, the whole point of an independent\n\n–Independent? The hell you think you’re doing! You want to go it alone? Like Slater? You want to see firsthand what happened to him?\n\n–Slater, yes, and Dietz\n\n–Dietz, defecting in the middle of the fucking meeting, did you put him up to that?\n\n–He’s been trying to see you all week, you don’t even answer his e-mail, and, and Slater, they knew, didn’t they, that the computer model was rigged from the start, all the way back to Null.\n\n–Now it’s Null’s fault? Thought you were blaming young Thorpe. Keep your scapegoats straight. The fact is it’s your model, Philip, your computer code, and if anyone goes down for this\n\n–but you put me on it, didn’t you, gave me Null’s code and the bad data from earlier tests, let me waste over a year on something you knew couldn’t work until Thorpe tweaked it to give those bogus results\n\n–behind Thorpe’s back, that stunt you pulled with the backup reflectors, I should never have let you\n\n–because otherwise no one would have known, that was the heart of it, wasn’t it, those beryllium reflectors, they glowed exactly as the model predicted, but they weren’t measuring anything but their own radiance, the backup reflectors showed just a spike in the background noi\n\n–Listen to yourself, you’re saying that even your backups showed brightness\n\n–six orders of magnitude below what you claimed, six orders! a million times less! and twelve orders from what you promised, you overstated the power by a billion times! and you knew it all along, how did you think you could get away with, fake something like that at the heart of this program?\n\n–Watch what you say about what I did and didn’t know, and be very careful about using that f-word, because it’s your problem, you’re the one who couldn’t do your job! So don’t tell me what I know, I know it can be made to work, but you couldn’t do it!\n\n–You think you can do science by PR, by\n\n–Do you think this, pacing to the wall and tapping the framed facsimile of an ancient letter in a small precise hand, –wasn’t PR? “Item, I have a model of very strong but light bridges, Item, I also have models of mortars, Item, in case of need I will make large bombards, mortars, and firethrowing engines of beautiful and practical design, in short, whatever the situation, I can invent an infinite variety of machines for both attack and defense”, sure, think this wasn’t blowing smoke, think Leonardo had ever built any of these, think he had off the shelf hardware ready to go, no, but he got the job and he did it all, gave [Ludovico] Il Moro satisfaction for nineteen years didn’t he\n\n–bring up Leonardo you might talk about the string of projects he left unfinished\n\n–and Slater, don’t give me Slater, a fuckup and a substance abuser, little lesson for you there\n\n–and just who is this Devon Null? Nobody in J Section has ever seen him, one day I’m sharing his office space, the next all his books papers folders xeroxes are gone, cleared out, personnel won’t even give me his employee records\n\n–Ask your girlfriend. I mean the one in personnel, not the one in the antinuke group. Although with the information sieve around here the other one might have them too.\n\n–What business of yours\n\n–My business is to keep this place going, you want to walk around here on Valium making wild accusations remember that.\n\n–Now wait just a\n\n–You consider this report finished, is that right?\n\n–Yes.\n\n–Fine. I’m accepting it. You’re done. Your group’s dissolved. You’re on leave. Now get out.\n\n–Now wait a\n\n–Did you hear me? Out, now!\n\nFor a moment Quine stood, then zipped shut his empty carryall and went out past a slender young man carrying a calfskin case who looked up from Dolores and in at Highet.\n\n–Oh, Doctor Highet, I just dropped by to set up a meeting.\n\n–Why don’t you come in for a minute, Jeremy, holding the door as his eyes followed Quine into the corridor.\n\n–I don’t want to barge in…\n\n–No, I’m glad to see you. Just one minute, as he went around the desk to lift the phone with one hand and with the other casually pulled open a drawer and swept An Analysis of False Brightness into it. –Dolores? I want drug tests immediately for all employees in J Section. Yes, I mean this afternoon.\n\n–I’m glad that’s not my investigation, the young man said, smiling.\n\n–So, Jeremy. How was the meeting this morning? I’m sorry I missed it, you know how it is, complexity on the edge of chaos. Frank Szabo take care of you?\n\n–It went well. There are one or two points I think we’ll take up in a future meeting.\n\n–What points?\n\n–Written statements from Doctor Réti to the president and the secretary of defense. They seem to overstate the Superbright’s power by a substantial amount.\n\n–Doctor Réti is emeritus here. He’s not involved in daily operations, so he may not be completely up to speed on Superbright details. But he can still express his opinions as a private citizen.\n\n–Well, yes, but on Lab letterhead?\n\n–He keeps an office here, it’s natural he’d use the stationery. I wouldn’t make too much of it.\n\n–Don’t you, ah, review his official letters?\n\n–No. Why should I?\n\n–Well, you are the director.\n\n–Jeremy, put yourself in my place. Réti’s the founder. He’s a living legend. I can’t vet his correspondence.\n\n–Yes, but, even compared to your own test results, his estimates of the beam’s power are high by a factor of um, a billion? He says that the last test, Taliesin was it called? indicates a major breakthrough?\n\n–We saw substantially increased brightness. A billion times? No reason the beam couldn’t be made that bright.\n\n–Doctor Réti used the words “engineering phase”.\n\n–Our bottleneck isn’t the science, it’s the funding.\n\n–Well, concerns have been raised, you don’t mean the GAO’s investigation hinges on a couple of letters, do you?\n\n–Well, but even your own numbers from previous tests have been questioned by some of your own people\n\n–Not Slater again, is it, totally unreliable\n\n–Szabo said this last test, Taliesin, is under internal review by uh, who is it, Philip Quine?\n\n–That’s purely a technical review. We tried out a new detector arrangement. But the old detectors worked fine, they gave us all the data we needed. Actually, Quine’s been dragging his feet on that report. I’ll have him finish it and get a copy to you, but frankly any problems there are technical and not substantive.\n\n–One last thing. What do you know about uh, Transfinite Polygonics?\n\n–That some kind of non-Euclidean geometry? Nuclear chemistry’s my field.\n\n–It’s a holding company, or possibly a consulting firm. Doctor Réti seems to own quite a lot of their stock.\n\n–And?\n\n–Certain technologies licensed through Transfinite originated in the Lab. There might be a conflict of interest.\n\n–We often waive commercial rights.\n\n–Well, if he’s advising the government on matters in which he has a financial stake\n\n–Oh look, Réti’s no sharpshooter. Some of our people go into private industry, it was probably some former student he wanted to help out, I’ll bet he’s forgotten all about this stock. Is there anything else?\n\n–No, that covers it. But the issue of the tests and the alleged overselling. I wouldn’t take those too lightly.\n\n–Thanks for coming by, Jeremy.\n\nHighet flipped open his phone, arrowed down until its display showed ROOT DAN, and pressed SEND to hear, –The Gate Cellular customer you have called is unavailable or has traveled outside the coverage area. Please try your call again later.\n\nThe gray face of his watch blinked 3:55. From under the desk he took a black gym bag blazoned aXon , unzipping it for the hand that opened the drawer to transfer An Analysis of False Brightness, as the desk phone trilled and, –Highet. Yes, Bernd. No, that’s all right… fingers drumming, he checked his watch for 3:56, and tapped the phone’s cradle, –Hold on, Bernd, that’s my other line, at once hanging up and passing into the outer office –I’m gone, Dolores, waving off her –But the Vice Pres, as rounding a corner behind him a black t-shirt SEROTONIN stopped to watch his back vanish into the warmth of the afternoon sun and pass briskly into the shadow of the unfinished facade, still oddly deserted, past plywood and chainlink where yellow CAUTION CUIDADO tape now stretched taut between stakes around a terrain of ruts and pools of bright green flux.\n\nOn a machine of matte black steel and padded vinyl, Highet pumped and pedaled, pale pudgy thighs kissing and releasing the damp seat, and inhaled the stink of his wet clinging shirt. All around him, the creak, clank, huff of exertion, the small of work, the tithe that flesh exacts from mind. Three times a week, since a spell of tachycardia had scared him to an emergency room, he forced himself through this hour of pain, seething at every pump of calk, every stab of outraged quad. At thirty minutes he quit and went through the lock room, pausing at a fountain to gulp from the weak quavering arc of water brought forth by his thumb on its chrome button, then peeled off sodden t-shirt and shorts for swim briefs, and headed past PLEASE SHOWER BEFORE ENTERING POOL into air cool on his moist flesh and sunlight glinting on black cottonwoods burnishing a golden haunch clad in bright spandex, tingling with russet black hair that vanished into a white cap. He freed from his gym bag dropped on a redwood bench a pair of smoked plastic goggles, and sat at pooledge, legs immersed, and rinsed spit from the goggles before fixing them in his orbits, waiting for the white cap to flipturn at the wall by his feet before plunging to breaststroke a few lengths behind the scissor of golden legs, the wink of bright spandex.\n\nAfter ten laps he pushed up out of the water, toweled, brushed fallen cottonwood catkins from the bench, and sat. Nearby a pair of gardeners glanced at him then returned their attention to the trees. –¿Porqué los álamos no sueltan semillas? –Hace dos años rebajamos las hembras. El jefe tiene las alégias. –¡Ay! Entonces los hombres álamos ya no difrutan mas . He opened An Analysis Of to beryllium excited by the trigger glowed at precisely the wavelength of the predicted laser light, blinking away from the bright page for his sunglasses, seeing across the pool a thin pale man in blue trunks, suede hat, and hiking boots watch a trim woman passing, his eyes sliding in a lean humorless face. The woman entered the pool and a moment later the thin man removed his boots and hat and lowered into the same lane to swim breaststroke a few lengths behind the woman. Highet called to the lifeguard.\n\n–Why don’t you tell him to move to a slower lane?\n\n–Who?\n\n–The blue suit. He’s in the way.\n\n–Looks fine to me.\n\n–Don’t tell me! I’ve been sitting here watching him for ten minutes, you haven’t even been looking.\n\nAfter a hesitation the guard went to pooledge and thrust a blue kickboard in front of the man as he came to his turn. Highet flipped pages to defective reflectors duplicated and therefore confirmed the brightness predicted by the computer model. Like a child probing a scab he skimmed to throwing all previous test results into question, whispering –Fucker, and plunging a hand into the gym bag feeling for the spiral edges, did I get all his copies? Of course not, he’ll have a backup, glancing up to see Quine’s girl, the one in personnel, talking warmly with a wiry man darkly tanned. What was her name, he’d looked it up just last week. Should have seen this a few hours ago, before dealing with Quine. Drive the knife deeper. A white cap appeared at pooledge and golden arms straightened and a golden leg came up to vault glistening spandex from the lane and russet hair tumbled free from the white cap, cool blue eyes meeting Highet’s shielded gaze as he shook free of revery, zipped his gym bag and strode back into the dimness of the locker room, sunglasses fogging as he passed the steaming showers, detouring to a row of urinals where he dropped the bag and spraddled tugging aside the crotch of his briefs, staring ahead at tile, as on his cooling back dampness dried and his stream rang in the bowl, misting faintly the hand holding his stub of flesh. On the porcelain shelf was a small uncapped vial. While right thumb and index shook and tucked his flesh into his briefs, he turned the empty vial between index and left thumb, –Son of a, to display URINE LUCK - Tersolene - Directions: Add contents of the vial to eight ounces (8 oz.) of urine. Mix slightly.\n\nNear chainlink now wrapped with CAUTION CUIDADO, in the shadow of the facade, Bran Nolan, saturnine and gaunt, stood wearing the look of his namesake, son of Febal, upon his return from the magic year of sojourn that spanned mundane centuries, to learn that the shore of home had become fatal to him.\n\n–Evening, Bran.\n\n–I hear Kihara screwed up the EIS.\n\n–That’s the truth.\n\n–Do you know what’s going on here? Nobody’s working.\n\n–It’s five-thirty, Bran.\n\n–Nobody’s been here all afternoon. The caution tape, who put that up?\n\n–I don’t know. Bran, have a minute? Step inside, would you?\n\nHighet led inside and down the hall, through the empty outer office, kicking aside in passing aXon Tell Us About, gesturing Nolan to a chair near the black matte computer.\n\n–You put your guests in the death seat, I see.\n\n–What?\n\n–The back end of your monitor’s pointed at me. That’s where the ELF emissions are highest.\n\n–ELF, elf is right, that crap’s about as real as leprechauns. While you’re here, your draft response to this GAO thing, I have a language question, skimming through pages to where a yellow highlight stopped him.\n\n–Which GAO thing? We’ve got five pending.\n\n–The property management one. You say here, “signals an accounting discrepancy”. Isn’t that a bit strong?\n\nNolan put on glasses and studied the page, lips pursed. –Our December statement said, “excellent security management of sensitive materials.” The same month an internal audit reported ten kilograms of plutonium missing. That signals, you might even say highlights, a discrepancy.\n\n–Suggests.\n\n–What?\n\n–Suggests a discrepancy.\n\n–Oh no, not at all. An off-record comment in the cafeteria suggests. A heavily edited and reviewed document signals. Or denotes. Or even highlights.\n\n–Something softer.\n\n–This is soft.\n\n–Softer.\n\nNolan crooked a finger. –Indicates. It indicates a discrepancy.\n\n–That’s acceptable. Highet moved a pencil across the page. –Thank you. What’s the story on the building.\n\n–I heard that Kihara tripped some alarms. I thought I’d see if they unearthed any bodies out there.\n\n–I don’t know if you remember, but in the planning stage we had two consulting firms prepare environmental reports on that site for us. Chivian-Harris found soil toxicity well above EPA action level\n\n–I remember.\n\n–which they blamed on leaky retention tanks and a faulty sewage system. So we call in a second firm, Boole & Clay\n\n–Eric’s company\n\n–correct, who suggested cleanup procedures and gave us a more forgiving report on the tanks. So we cited Boole in the EIS. Their findings suggested that the soil could be treated as low-level waste. Then the soil engineer reported.\n\n–Soil engineer?\n\n–Before the contractor can pour concrete the engineer has to certify that the soil is dense enough to hold a foundation. They use a nuclear density testing machine, it’s a small radioactive source and a counter, like a smoke detector. The design originated here in the Lab. You put soil in the tester and it blocks radiation from the source, and from the absorption you can infer the soil density. Well, the tester went off the scale. Credne, the contractor, came down on the engineer, said his machine was out of alignment, they got him to give a visual approval. Then Credne trucked the soil away, and Chivian tested again and this time we came up clean. So we cited the clean report in the EIS.\n\n–So what’s the problem?\n\n–Why do you think the tester went off the scale? The soil wasn’t absorbing, it was emitting radiation.\n\n–How hot was it?\n\n–Not low level.\n\n–Where did that soil go?\n\n–We don’t know.\n\n–We don’t know?\n\n–Probably to another Credne site. They have some complicated leaseback scheme with a trucking subsidiary. Their records aren’t so good.\n\n–That’s Credne’s responsibility, isn’t it?\n\n–I’m not a lawyer, I can’t answer that. Point is, both Boole and Chivian are cited in the EIS. The two reports are on file, anyone can look them up, and if they do, they’ll see the soil engineer’s readings.\n\n–How likely is that?\n\n–Some group like CANT might wonder why Kihara’s so frantic about his mistake with the map. They might get curious about the paperwork.\n\n–What’s the worst case scenario?\n\n–Well, this isn’t Site Alpha. We can’t just fence it off and call it a toxics mitigation program. It’s in the middle of our plant. Oh, and about Site Alpha. The winemaker’s been talking to CANT. He’s suing.\n\n–Christ, we bought his land, what more does he want?\n\n–Damages. Loss of livelihood.\n\n–Shit, thought that was all wrapped up.\n\n–Funny thing about PR, it bumps into reality once in a while.\n\n–Keep telling you, reality’s what you can get away with. Write him a check, see how fast his reality changes.\n\n–Where does the money come from?\n\n–We have a special access fund, use it.\n\n–You know… the plume keeps spreading.\n\n–What does that mean?\n\n–The toxic plume. Under Site Alpha. It’s not contained. We can’t keep buying up land around it.\n\nFor a moment the plume was apparent to Highet, clear as a computer simulation, a subterranean cloud of false colors, arms extended, breaching the boundaries of the Lab, which expanded to follow and enclose it.\n\n–You say CANT is behind this suit?\n\n–That’s what I hear.\n\n–I never cease to be amazed, Bran, at how much you hear.\n\n–It’s my job.\n\n–You go above and beyond it sometimes. You know, Bran, I tried to get the search committee to promote you instead of that young idiot Kihara.\n\n–Thanks for looking out for me. But I’m sure you’re better served by Kihara. Journalists can’t be trusted, everyone knows that.\n\nHighet looked at him. –You’re a real hard case, Bran. You won’t give me an inch.\n\n–Is there anything else?\n\n–Take down that caution tape out there.\n\nOutside as the light slanted toward dusk he slowed near the handful of demonstrators just beyond the gate, alert to a camera crew interviewing a woman, her full face radiant in sun, intense black eyes beneath black hair tinged with russet, her beauty a thorn in his heart, lifting his sunglasses as he passed to blink twice at her dazzling flesh, as if to capture not an image but an essence through which desire might be gratified, intimacy possessed, and redemption grasped. As her eyes tracked his passage the head of the reporter turned, and Highet accelerated away onto the main road seeing in the hollow afterimage of his blink not an essence but its negative. Traffic thickened into town, and under a white on green sign Mariposa he turned too sharply into the wake of a bus pulling away from the curb to trap him behind its tailpipe and rear placard admonishing Police Recommended Don’t Park Your Car Without as the traffic above him changed and oncoming vehicles edged honking around his rear until he gunned around the bus before cutting back in and slamming brakes shorts of a truck backing slowly into his path, beeping in disconcerted hocket with Highet’s horn as he jammed the gearshift to R only to see the bus’s headlight fill his rearview mirror as the truck’s step How Am I Driving? 1-800-328-7448 scraped loudly across the red hood.\n\n–Stop! You son of a bitch stop! It lurched a yard short of his windshield as a head leaned down from the driver’s cab.\n\n–Where’d you come from?\n\n–Just, just, move it, you imbecile! Pull it forward!\n\nIn a blast of smoke it pulled away, as he reversed the car, arrested by a blare of bus horn where its glassy eye loomed in his rear window. Shifting to 1, Highet went in a squeal of tires around the truck, left arm held high out the window in profane salute, wind booming through the open window street after street until at last he slowed at First Unitarian Church of Kentwood turning into a parking lot half full, noting with less surprise than disdain the battered white Subaru with Lab sticker on its rear bumper.\n\nPaper signs taped to walls CANT MEETING → led to a side room FELLOWSHIP HALL depressing as all childhood memories of church, where the after-service klatches in the basement, folding tables laden with cakes and pastries too cloying, smell of burned coffee in chrome urns, fading sun aslant through blinkered windows to fall in exhausted lines on a scuffed linoleum floor, the empty chatter, the waste of time, had never failed to fill him with a metaphysical nausea. Fifty or more people sat now in folding chairs, listening to –the easy availability of dual-use technologies makes it almost impossible to constrain nuclear programs in other countries and raises serious questions, as just inside the door, Quine started back from Highet’s, –You. What are you doing here?\n\n–I have a right\n\n–If I find out you’ve been dealing with these people\n\n–What will you do, put me on leave?\n\nHighet stared at him for a moment, then went on around the edge of the room, where, near the platform, a russet tone in nightblack hair snared his eye and sped his heart. The serpent of invention entered him and he stepped up next to her, as if better to hear the speaker, –Next question, yes, and turned to gaze at her strong profile, seeing her awareness of his gaze in the faint throb in her neck. He murmured , –Are you afraid of me? Is it fear makes your heart beat? Or excitement? while beyond her stony profile Quine glared with concern or was it panic as Highet went on in a mild undertone, –Are you afraid of getting what you want? I’ve seen you out by the gate, hating us. Her eyes narrowed but remained locked ahead while Luz said, –other countries with or near nuclear capabilities look skeptically at our own commitment to nonproliferation, and across the room Quine paced and glared, his distress a goad to Highet’s invention. He leaned still closer to her, saying, –It’s not fear you feel. It’s wildness. The wildness of wanting. What is it you want? When you know, taking it is easy.\n\n–Is it, she said, fierce black eyes locking on him.\n\n–Yes. Yes it is.\n\n–I want to talk to you sometime.\n\nNow his heart was wild. –Name the time.\n\n–Now? Arms folded under her breasts.\n\n–Right now?\n\n–If you’re serious. There’s a café in the central mall, Café Desaparecidos. I can meet you there when I’m done here. Seven-thirty?\n\n–That’s a deal.\n\nScattered applause died and people milled around. Tony Luz came forward. –Well, the Prince of Darkness himself. Last place I expected to see you, Leo. What’s wrong with your face?\n\n–Nice line of talk, Tony. Won any Clios lately?\n\n–Same old Leo. Smiling, Luz raised a fist and lightly pressed it to Highet’s shoulder. –People, this is Leo Highet, director of the Lab. I feel like I owe him equal time. How about a little informal Q and A, Leo?\n\n–Matter of fact I’ve got a plane to catch.\n\n–Five minutes. Five minutes, Leo? You don’t want to run from us, do you?\n\n–Yeah, I do. Most pointless thing in world, arguing with you guys.\n\n–Five minutes.\n\nHer hard black eyes studied him. He raised his wristwatch and touched buttons. –Five minutes.\n\n–Why do you classify hazardous waste by the building it’s stored in? Why not by the program that generates it?\n\nSlogan t-shirt buzzcut three day beard. Cheap shill pumped full of citizengroup coredump data. Answer in kind. –Accounting for materials and wastes is done by building to provide information for emergency response services and to assure that the buildings meet safety requirements.\n\n–Doesn’t that just make it easier to hide the fact that the weapons programs generate most of the hazardous waste?\n\nCocky amateur. Give him what he thinks he wants. –Good point. Maybe we should track that information, but we can’t. Our procedures are dictated by federal regulations. Talk to the feds about it.\n\nHe stopped paying attention, these were just the old neverland arguments he could handle on autopilot, the uninhabitable utopias of good will to brought about by some wishful convergence of niceness, the very word nice, ne scient, not knowing, ignorant, he stressed it like a secret insult. –Yes, I agree, it would be nice, very nice, if the world could be saved by recycling, and so on, she was at the door now, talking to Quine while Luz asked another question, and Highet parried it with his own, –Tony, why are you so down on dual use? Isn’t that what you want, get us out of weapons?\n\nLuz shifted his weight slightly back, disengaging, as Highet watched Quine and Lynn go out the door together. –Don’t see that happening, Leo. Dual use policies have weakened export controls on rocket technology, we’re selling missiles overseas, last year the US accounted for fifty-seven percent of world weapon sales. Some of these systems are being turned back on us.\n\n–Good thing we know their vulnerabilities.\n\n–Leo, as long as we keep designing and selling these weapons\n\n–You’ve got that lunatic in Baghdad, you’ve got twenty thousand warheads floating loose in the so-called republics, you think how’s the time to cut antimissile programs?\n\n–It’s welfare for the defense industry.\n\n–free market, what have you got against capitalism, Tony, capitalism’s been good to you. Drumming the fingers of one hand against the back of the other, trapped by his ego, center of the situation while she moved off without him. He tapped a button on his watch. The watch beeped and he held it high for all to see, touching it to silence, –That’s five minutes. Now I have a question for you. Anyone here read H G Wells? The Time Machine? No? You’re Eloi . Look it up.\n\nIn the lot, Quine’s white Subaru was gone. he passed SFIST as acceleration spilled warn evening air through the car, cutting back across two lanes to Codornic s EXIT NLY, turning smoothly without slowing past STOP onto a commercial strip that looped behind the central mall, where stains of rain and rust on a colonnaded and pedimented facade stood stark as melanomas under sodium light. He parked under the red and white glare of SMART & FINAL, and his car alarm yelped as he strode under a portico through smoked glass doors into the oasis of an atrium ringed with Target Clothestime Kinko’s Tower, fixing on Café, where, visible through the broad entrance, black hair with russet tones was bent forward over some papers, the skin of her neck taut against vertebrae, and pale where it touched the fringe of her hair.\n\nHighet sat down, saying, –Thought you might have stood me up, leaving that way. With him.\n\n–He offered me a ride. She swept up the papers and tucked them away.\n\n–What does that mean, indicating the sign, –desaparecidos? The café of desperation? Abandon all hope?\n\n–The disappeared. Those taken by death squads.\n\n–Oh, of course. In El Salvador. Or is it Guatemala? Part of the profits from every latté. Have you eaten? Thai place around the corner makes great mee krob.\n\n–I ate before the meeting.\n\n–I haven’t eaten since this morning, I’m starved.\n\n–She’s waiting.\n\n–What? Oh, give me a mint tea. And a, what have you got, a blueberry muffin?\n\n–Quisiera un espresso por favor.\n\n–Saw a woman outside the gate this evening, looked like you, talking to CNN.\n\n–That was me. I saw you drive by.\n\nHe played to her amused tone, examined her critically. –That was you? Did you cut your hair? How’d you beat me to the church?\n\n–I got a ride. I saw you turn right at Mariposa. That’s the long way around. You’ve been watching me?\n\n–Know your enemies. Legal observer at CANT demonstrations, Stanford grad, good grades, nice family. You want to close down my Lab. That’s what I know about you. What do you know about me?\n\n–I know that you sold the president an unworkable and ruinously expensive antimissile program.\n\n–But, he raised, ruinously expensive for whom?\n\n–Do you know that the Cold War has cost five trillion dol\n\n–You know what? The Russians wish they had our deficit. They wish they could run up a debt. You follow me?\n\n–Is that what you’re, gracias, what you’re telling the GAO?\n\n–The GAO, right? Talk about your waste of money, as he leaned forward to bite into the muffin.\n\n–But, is that really your line? That you knew all along it wouldn’t work, but you made the Soviets think it would?\n\n–That would be a policy decision. DOE sets policy. I’m a simple scientist. Not even that, really. I administrate. The science is done by people like your friend Philip. Where do you meet him?\n\n–He gave me a ride once.\n\n–You don’t own a car. For ecological reasons.\n\n–The more you drive the less intelligent you are.\n\n–Repo Man . I love that movie.\n\n–I wouldn’t call Philip a friend.\n\n–You like him.\n\n–I don’t dislike him.\n\n–He tell you he’s a bomb geek?\n\n–A what?\n\n–That’s what they call us, the, how should I say, pure scientists who work at the Lab and take our money but want to show that they, you know, disapprove of bombs. They call us bomb geeks. Did Quine tell you he’s one or did he pretend to be pure?\n\n–He told me that he works on weapons. He’s torn about it.\n\n–Torn. That’s good. It’s good to have scruples. Without them we’re no better than the beasts.\n\n–His work is all he has, and he said to me, you don’t know what’s happening there, what I’m up against right now…\n\n–Did he. That’s very interesting. He go into details? Sitting back and smiling, eyes on hers, Highet unzipped his case to take from an upper pocket a sheaf of pages, slyly tipping the pages toward her to reveal in unadorned Courier font “TALIESIN” RESULTS PRELIMINARY SECRET. –Give you this, maybe? Or this? and like a conjuror fanned to An Analysis of False Brightness, as her full cheeks reddened and a pulse twitched where vein crossed collarbone under downcast eyes, thick lashes, and the fine black hair of her brows.\n\n–No.\n\n–No. But you have seen them before, he said in a tone almost caressing.\n\n–What if I have? Dark eyes locked on his.\n\n–Oh, well, breaking the gaze, sitting back, still smiling, replacing the sheaf in his case. –It’s nothing to me. Old news. Your people talk to Senator Chase’s office.\n\n–Of course we do.\n\n–Ever convey documents?\n\n–What does that mean?\n\n–You know Bran Nolan. One of our press officers. He’s dealt with your group before.\n\n–I know the name.\n\n–He passed these to you. No? Then who? Philip himself?\n\n–You’ve got some imagination. Dry voice, but a tremor in it.\n\nLeaning forward, hands clasped around his teacup, sincere gaze. –All I want to know is, how long you’ve had it. And if Chase has it too.\n\n–I don’t know anything about that.\n\nHardness biting through her tremor. Standing up to him. His heart sped. –You know, it’s not as though your side doesn’t have enough arguments without resorting to this. It doesn’t serve your purpose. You shouldn’t antagonize us, because no wait, now listen to me, because we’re on the same side, yes we are, and I’ll tell you why. You want the bomb work to stop, and I don’t agree, but you know what? I can live with that, really I can, so long as we stay cutting edge on other fronts.\n\n–It’s weapons work that gives you your lock on federal money.\n\n–That’s changing. We’re moving away from that.\n\n–Oh, that’s right. Dual use will change everything.\n\n–Isn’t that what you want?\n\n–You’re good at this, I’m almost believing you.\n\n–Have some muffin.\n\n–No thanks.\n\n–I can be persuasive. If you let me. Why don’t you come around? Let me give you a tour.\n\nShe lowered her eyes to sip her espresso. –Where do you know Tony from?\n\n–Luz? We were classmates at Caltech.\n\n–I didn’t know he went to Caltech.\n\n–Lousy scientist, but he always could work a crowd. You know he was in advertising?\n\n–You’re still friends?\n\n–Sure, why not. We’re useful to each other.\n\n–But, is that what you call friendship? Use?\n\n–Friendship. Is that when we all sit around, like, holding hands? I’d rather have allies. Friends, you know, sympathasize with you. Allies help you get things done. I’d like to be your ally.\n\n–That sounds too lonely for me.\n\n–Oh, I could be friendlier. But let me ask. Quine, your Philip, you think he hasn’t used you? To get things done? Think he hasn’t maneuvered as much as anyone? I could tell you about that shifty little shit. Luz and I, you may wonder at that, but we know what the other is. Quine, though, you never know what he’s doing.\n\nShe studied him for a moment. –In some ways you’re very like him.\n\n–Like who?\n\n–Philip.\n\nWhich warmed him until he saw the pointed coldness of her eyes. He laughed. –I don’t think so.\n\nIn the atrium, a metal gate thundered down beneath Clothestime. Highet regarded her. –You’d be quite attractive if you’d use a little makeup, fix your hair, shave your legs.\n\nShe looked away, across the café, smiling and shaking her head. –What you’re doing now, it’s so…\n\n–I know, he said, getting to his feet. –You’ve got me all figured out and it doesn’t help a bit.\n\nShe rose, face darkening. –I do day care. I see this in children, they want to own every situation. I don’t need this in my adult life.\n\nHis heart seethed. –Adult life? You’re so young. Those kids at your protests, that rebellion doesn’t age well. You’ll see.\n\n–Some of those protesters are your age. Or older. There’s a seventy year old Episcopalian bishop. There’s a single mother with three children who works forty hours a week then another twenty doing this. They’re the finest people I know. She opened her purse.\n\nHe dropped a bill on the table. –This is my treat. I insist. Call me if you want that tour.\n\nAnd went with ballooning heart into the lot, free as the paper bag KFC skipping across asphalt in the warm night wind flattened by his front wheel as the vacant moonless sky trembled unseen past the glare of light poles, a glare that brightened and dimmed, dimmed and brightened as he drove, arousing a frustration that would not be calmed, an urge that could not be channeled, a lust to abase himself before her and thus abase her, until, cued by the car’s approach, lights snapped on over the garage and the door rolled open. He stilled, shut, and locked the car, red light blinking on the dash under teal 8:45, garage door rumbling shut as he entered through the kitchen silencing the alarm’s squeal with 3 1 4 1 6 as the light went from red ARMED to green SAFE, passing and ignoring the blinking MESSAGES on his answering machine, as kitchen lights came on for him to lean against the open refrigerator door, drumming fingers, stooping to come up with a greasy box PapaGeno Pizza, punching the microwave START and plucking from between Fines Herbes and Italian Seasoning a small bottle LactAid, shaking out two pills and swallowing them with Peach Iced Tea from a cold and glistening can while thumbing the small television where CNN drew a baleful glare for –ongoing probe of Radiance missile defense program, and the oven chimed and the phone trilled. He turned off the phone and zeroed the answering machine’s volume, touching the CD player for –got a kindhearted woman do anything in the world for me , and crossed back for his pizza, steaming and succulent, pausing to jab his thumb against ant after ant streaming across the counter in braided lines, then carried plate to table and as he ate skimmed the newspaper, Exxon To Pay Fine, US Steps Up Iraq Air Patrols, State Budget Shortfall, Why Gate Cellular Is Forging Alliances, A’s Shine In Training, the edges of the newsprint soaking up a smear of grease from his fingers as the pizza diminished, his eyes at last drifting to 24 HRS OUTCALL above a sullen pout and forehead circleted with dark hair wild as if fresh risen from the sea, and he unfolded the phone, clearing his throat, for –Lombard Escorts, while Robert Johnson sang on forlorn in the empty living room against the rush of a shower, interrupted by the chime and the quick stride of muscled calves beneath a belted robe opening to, –Hi, I’m Dawna, running a hand through hair not dark or wild but bright as a carrot under the porch light, beyond which a sky as empty of stars as of folly, error, sin, and avarice turned through empty hours carrying a sliver of waning moon, thin as a nail paring, in pursuit of Venus through a brightening sky in flight from the sun rising to flood the bedroom deck with morning light on slim white legs stretched from red satin briefs barely covered by the fall of a translucent shift.\n\n–Do you mind? Highet called out. –I have neighbors.\n\n–Don’t we all, honey, as she came in sliding the door shut behind her, taking from between his outstretched fingers three tightly folded bills. She sat on the bed and pulled on hose. He stepped into the bathroom to dress. When he emerged she was picking hairs from her brush and dropping them into a waste can. The brush went into her bag with a snap and she smiled brightly at Highet as she turned and went out.\n\nAs he shut the front door behind her, he saw the light on the answering machine. He pressed PLAY for, –Leo, it’s Dan, some son of a bitch hacked my cell phone, and walked to the sink where he jammed the lever to blast hot water across a tide of ants twined from the pizza crust lodged in the sink drain across counter and linoleum to a garbage pail, returning to, –ran up eight thou in calls to Bogotá, new number’s 326-7668, give me a, pausing the machine to punch the seven digits.\n\n–Dan, it’s me. Yeah, doesn’t say much for Gate’s security, does it. What? Chase? That son of a bitch, what’s he trying to. My performance review committee? as steam billowed from the sink. –Okay, give me the rundown. Dullard Quack and Logjam, they’re on our side… what? Well that’s Quick’s own fault, if he hadn’t been a year late and ten million over with the last mainframe we ordered he’d still have the contract, now what’s Logue’s problem? Well again, that’s his, if he hadn’t talked to the press, I told him you cannot win playing with the press, you’re always going to lose. Okay. Okay, Dan, cut to the, what do you mean probably? You mean Dillard’s our only sure vote? How can that be? What, tomorrow? They’re meeting on a Sunday? Christ, as if I didn’t have enough… Why. Why should I. No I don’t see what being there in the flesh does for me. It’s only a recommendation, what do the regents care, the university gets their money no matter who’s director. What do you mean cuts both, of course it does, but we have enough friends on the regents to override, don’t we? A new regent, what do you mean, who? A noname, oh that’s great, little bit of Monte Carlo in the mix. What else, Dan? shutting off the hot water and walking to the window.\n\n–Christ Dan that was years ago, I was still out in the trailers. And if you want to know whose bright idea it was to rig a homing beacon on the missile’s target, ask Warren Slater, that prick. Anyway, you know what? The only test of four that worked was the one they didn’t rig.\n\nOutside a city truck moved slowly past as two men in its bed deposited TOW-AWAY NO PARKING placards at the curb.\n\n–What else. Who… oh come on, Steradian couldn’t find his dick if you held it for him. Yes he called me, he called Dietz too, forget it, he’s fishing.\n\nHe flipped yellow pages for Exterminators stopping at a display ad, Nekrotek 24 Hour Pest Control.\n\n–Dan, Bill Venham is a troglodyte. Yes I know, rich and powerful, so’s the vice president, I don’t return his calls either. What? Oh he calls because his son went into some telecom venture after that savings and loan thing, maybe he’s trying to weasel in on our Gate deal. But Venham, there’s no way I’m going to his fucking fundraiser. I know Réti’s going, ask me it’s pathetic how he hangs around these rightwing creeps. Oh yeah, you know how long I’ve been just showing up at these things. Uh huh. Uh huh. All right, Dan. I said all right, I’ll do it! That, and the review committee on Sunday, quite the itinerary you’ve got lined up for me. What about the Hertz kids, does that have to be Sunday night? Oh, the shot, of course, I forgot. Yes I’ll make it. One of the few things I still enjoy. I’ll be exhausted but I’ll be there.\n\nReading and punching digits for, –Nekrotek, he gave his name and address, jabbing his thumb against ant after ant braiding onward across the counter, –Ants, yes. Well look, I’m leaving town can you fax me the paperwork? I’ll sign it and leave it with a key in the mailbox, okay? Yes you’ll take a credit card…? and hung up, turning to the answering machine MESSAGES and touching >> for a beep and –tor Highet, this is Armand Steradian of CNN. I’d like to talk to you as soon as possible. I’m finishing a story on allegations of rigged tests in the Radiance program, my number is –Fuck you, and touching >> for the beep and –Frank Greer returning your, –can’t believe this twerp calls me at home, and touching >> for the beep and –York Times, if you’d care to comment, then leaning in to read the display, –fifteen messages! punching >> for –alleged violations, and >>, –questions about your environmental impact statem, and >> –call at your earliest, and finally STOP for a peremptory knock at the door sounding with the chime. For a moment he stood frozen, then walked lightly to the bedroom. From its window he saw in the street a van bearing a dish antenna. The bell and knock sounded again. After a third try, two men, one shouldering a video camera, returned to the van.\n\nFrom the closet he took a garment bag and checked its contents: his impression-management suit, a tie, two clean shirts, socks, a pair of Rockports, a personal kit. Again he lifted the phone. His left eyelid began to twitch. Phon in hand he pressed a finger against it. With the other hand he punched 276-7384. Behind him his fax machine purred.\n\n–Aron, it’s Leo. I need your help. Please call me. It’s urgent. I hope to see you tonight in Burbank at the Venham dinner. I’ll be on the road till then, you can reach me by cell phone at 544-4438.\n\nOutside, the van had gone. Pages had fallen on the floor behind him. He picked them up and scribbled his signature. He zipped his laptop computer into its nylon carry. From the dresser he took a spare house key and five hundred dollar bills. At the front door he checked the fisheye lens for an empty street before swinging it wide and dropping the spare key and the faxes into the mailbox. On the way back through the kitchen to the garage he unplugged the answering machine and again picked up the phone.\n\n–Thea, it’s me, looks like I can shake some time loose after all. When is mother getting home? Uh huh. No, if I leave right away I can be there in. No, not a problem. I can take care of some other business at the same. I’ll be glad to see her too. Okay, look, don’t go to any trouble. See you about three.\n\nThe garment bag fell on the passenger seat as the garage door rumbled open, and he was on his way.\n\nThe dead seabed, the broad valley, sundered the state top to bottom. Speed Enforced By Aircraft. Power lines fell and rose in catenaries to cross the road’s dead places as a crescendo buzz rose to bury –wouldn’t stand a prayer, and fell away behind, –here we are in the quick of it, as the radio scanned to –another anointed message from the Reveal Christ To The World Ministries , to –with significant tax deferral benefits, to –this, also from the Washington Times, to –Inland Empire checks in accident free, to –Jesus was never impressed with size, the size of your organ, as the sun reached zenith and declined glinting on the lake at Elev 4819 where he turned off the freeway to descend into tender green hills and an orange dust of poppies blooming, and silver violet sage trembling palely in the relentless wind, leading the eye out over an immensity to distant mountains naked and wrinkled as ancient skin. From above fell a hollow roar. Two blunt black triangles banked against blue emptiness.\n\nTumbling from the edge of his vision something dim and gray crossed the road and splintering tinder sheared from the windshield as the tail of the car shimmied and stabilized with one branch of the tumbleweed lodged in the hood trembling in the slipstream. His heart slowed and his attention came back to the road where the works of man now came more thickly, Joshua Estates blazoned over a brick drive flanked by banners snapping and New Townhouses From $59,999 We’re Leasing Come See Why, Spacious Skies Senior Living Small Pets OK, then City Limit Elev 2376 and a grid of vacant dirt roads, W 280 ave W 270 Ave W 260 Ave, then mini malls and LANCASTER FACTORY STORES, identical red tile roofs and beige walls and empty parking lots reproving the immensity in which they lay.\n\nThe house, once at desert’s edge, was now deep in a tract of others like it. Locust trees shaded the street, their roots heaving the sidewalk. Forty years ago the saplings were slender and staked, no taller than himself. His eyes and mind, inapt tenants of time, still expected to find them thus, continued to seek in a place, a face, what first they had found there.\n\nSun glared on the concrete walk. He was sweating before he reached the house. No answer to the bell. Neighborhood Watch Armed Response. Key under the rock as it had been for years. The unlocked door stuck until he thrust his weight against it.\n\nStale air of home. Anxiety of passing time. This place he had always wanted to escape. On the bare dining room table lay a note. He read it, then lifted the phone and dialed. Through the handset came unanswered chirrs. As he counted them, Thea’s car pulled into the driveway. Her key turned in the lock. The door stuck, then flew wide.\n\n–Oh, you’re here.\n\nIn one hand Highet held out the chirring handset, in the other her note. –Your answering machine’s turned off. I don’t believe this Thea, you couldn’t have called me? When did you find out?\n\n–They want to do just one more series of tests before they release her.\n\n–Great. Just great. I’m going home.\n\n–Oh, Leo… that’s absurd.\n\n–I’m not waiting around in this house.\n\n–Why don’t you go into town for a while? You know, your high school reunion’s tonight.\n\n–My what? Is this one of your airball agendas, Thea? If I need that level of excitement I’ll sit in a Motel Six and watch the Weather Channel.\n\n–Fine, do what you want, you always do.\n\n–You’ve got that right.\n\n–I have to be sure everything’s ready. I still need an IV stand, to hang a drip from. I’m sure we can rig something up, it just has to be tall.\n\n–Rig something. Sure, I know, let’s use the coat rack. Dress it up with some Christmas lights, a little tinsel, there you are.\n\n–Leo, don’t be sarcastic.\n\n–I’ll buy the damn thing, okay? Where’s the store, give me something to do.\n\n–The hospital gave me some addresses. There’s one in Pasadena.\n\n–Perfect, I’ll stop in at Caltech on my way to the high school, make a clean sweep.\n\n–Oh, is there a Caltech reunion?\n\n–Joking, Thea, just a little joke, checking his watch, –How late is this place open?\n\n–Leo, it’s all the way in Pasadena!\n\n–I’ll leave now. Make sure the hospital gets their kickback from the referral. Got to go down that way anyway for\n\n–You’ve just driven seven hours. You\n\n–Five hours.\n\n–must be exhausted, Mark and I will stop on the way back from the hospital with Mother.\n\n–Stop on the, yeah good, let Mother sit in the back seat staring at the crutches and bedpans in the window while you shop around. Come on Thea, there’s got to be someplace nearby, where’s the phone book.\n\n–Leo, will you just, just stop it!\n\n–Thea, you’re the one wants everything ready, only you want to do it on the cheap at the last minute, like always, you’ve had, what, six weeks to get this stuff, you knew you’d need it\n\n–Do you think you can come down here for a few days while I’ve been dealing with this for months, and you think\n\n–Who said anything about a few days.\n\n–What?\n\n–I never said a few days.\n\n–How long are you going to stay?\n\n–Told you, expected Mother to be here already, thought I’d stay overnight, hit the road in the morning.\n\n–Oh, I see. I get it. You want to buy your way out of spending any time with her.\n\n–Buy my way, Jesus, Thea, who’s paying the hospital bills? –Mother’s Medica\n\n–I mean the rest of it, after the deductibles and everything Doctor Said won’t accept assignment for, you know how much that comes to? Buy my way, Christ that’s good, not with a lousy IV stand, if she had to rely on you for money, she’d be dead already.\n\n–Oh that’s rotten Leo, I don’t care about the money, she needs to see you, did you think of her feelings, it may be the last time, did you think of that!\n\n–Well you’re the expert on feelings, I can’t compete there.\n\nShe looked at him dully, then rummaged in a gray woven carryall blazoned with a cross-stitched mandala. –I don’t know why I thought this time would be any different.\n\nHe looked away, around the room. –How’s business? Sell any houses recently?\n\nShe stared into space for some seconds before reaching, as it seemed, less an acceptance of his question than a resignation to it. –The market’s flat. I got into it at the wrong time, at the end of the last boomlet.\n\n–Upholding the Highet real estate tradition. Ever sell that land of Dad’s?\n\n–No.\n\n–What’s the house worth now?\n\nShe looked around, appraising it. –I could ask one fifty, I might get one thirty.\n\n–You going to sell?\n\n–You mean after Mother? I suppose so. I haven’t really thought about it. Oh, I wanted to ask you. The market’s better in your area. How would you feel about me moving up there?\n\n–Up to you. Where are you looking?\n\n–Ohlone Valley. There’s a development called Estancia Estates, units starting at one fifty…\n\n–Estancia…? I wouldn’t live there.\n\n–Why not?\n\n–You can do better.\n\n–For two hundred I could, but I don’t have it.\n\n–Any time you want a loan, Thea.\n\n–It would be a business move for me. I have no reason to stay here once Mother’s gone. Without Bob. Mark has his family, I don’t see much of him. Leo, whatever happened to that girl you were seeing last year, Jan? I liked her, I thought she was good for you.\n\n–That’s over.\n\n–Are you seeing anyone now?\n\n–Yes, as a matter of fact.\n\n–Well, what’s her name?\n\n–Dawn. Her name’s Dawn.\n\nShe looked at him skeptically. –Are you thinking of settling down?\n\n–Married to my job, you know that. How’s Mark?\n\n–You’ll see him tonight. I thought we’d all have dinner at my place.\n\n–Little problem there, I’ve got something this evening.\n\nShe stopped in her rummaging, looked at him bitterly. –Can’t you, can’t you ever\n\n–Look, I’d rather not go to this thing, it’s\n\n–ever just\n\n–one of those things\n\n–do anything for someone else\n\n–It’s to honor Réti, told you I’m obligated\n\n–Leo, this is your mother!\n\n–I’m here, all right? When I said I’d be! Don’t lay this on me Thea, it’s not my fault you got your signals crossed.\n\nAbruptly she rose. –All right. I don’t want to discuss it. Here’s the key.\n\n–When are you leaving for the hospital?\n\n–Now. We should be back by eight.\n\n–Christ, how did she end up at a hospital two hours down below?\n\n–Leo, you know how she trusts Doctor Said. He recommended a man at Cedars.\n\n–Don’t want to be, you know, unfeeling here, but it’s terminal isn’t it, how good does he have to be.\n\n–Leo, I’m going. There are towels in the guest room.\n\n–I’ll be back tonight. Will Mother be here?\n\n–I expect so. I’ll see you in the morning.\n\nThe front door shut, grunting. He flipped through the phone book. Antelope Valley Medical Supply. Medi-Mart. Mid-Valley Surgical. Free delivery. Typical Thea, didn’t even look. He picked one, wandering into the kitchen as he talked, –Expires six ninety three. Can you hold delivery till nine p m?\n\nThe clock on the stove was broken, hands frozen at 2:10, though a stub of a second hand ground and scraped on. Outside the kitchen window the old fig tree nodded in the wind. On the table was a newspaper. He unfolded it to AF Base Has Clouds With Its Silver Lining and its sidebar Cold War Relics, then put it aside. From the living room he carried garment bag and laptop to the guest room, past the sampler hanging in the hall, Bless This House O Lord We Pray, pulling back the drapes to see the long view of his childhood, the distant ancient mountains, now enchased by hedges, fences, light poles, power lines, returning to the living room where he snapped on the television in passing to his mother’s room. A new chrome walker stood by the bed. Back in the living room he punched channels to –Headline News, and stood watching, the fingers of one hand drumming against a thigh, one foot tapping. After several minutes he switched it off.\n\nAt the end of the hall he went down six steps to the basement study, where a dispiriting smell of mildew hung. He sat at the small desk with its brass lamp and blotter, the framed photos of his mother and father, Thea, Mark, himself, Dad in uniform, Dad between two high school players in his sweatshirt LANCASTER COACH BOMBERS. Shelves of teak veneer sagging on metal wall brackets held what passed for a library with ten years’ worth of National Geographic propped against Patent It Yourself, Encyclopedia of Estate Planning, The Book of Business Knowledge, Secrets of Super Selling, Everyday Health Tips Practical Tips, and How To Avoid Probate! abutting the fifteen brown volumes of Compton’s Pictured Encyclopedia, their gilt bands touching The Merck Manual and Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations and The World Set Free slanted against The Martian Chronicles and the sober dun bookcloth of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and Lancaster High School 1961 1962, the sequence ending as abruptly as Gerald Hunter Highet’s career there. He took down 1962, blowing soot from its top edge. A strip of paper marked a page. On the trip, his mother’s looping hand: sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely night.\n\nTenor voice on the phonograph. Mom and Dad dancing. Leo darling, your father and I have been married ten years. Dad smiling. Not a smiling man, but a collector of jokes. Son, you know what a ball bearing mousetrap is? Leo tried to picture the mechanism. It’s a cat, son. The lined face, graying crewcut, bleak eyes, tight mouth, jowls under the square jaw. Jerry to some friends, Hunt to others, Captain (ret.) to the rest, depending on how they’d met. Petty hustlers, most of them, from his Army days, his years at Lockheed, his bootless dabbling in real estate. Then the high school for three years, chemistry and coaching. Until the scandal. Nothing proved. What do you think I am? I never touched a one of them. It’s political, the superintendent has it in for me. Left under a shadow, as they said. Then failure after failure. The real estate. The orchards. The telemarketing. His run for selectman drew a visit from the local Republican officials: best for all concerned that you withdraw. But you wouldn’t. Leo had been proud then of his father’s stubbornness. Later he saw it was desperation. A debacle: thirty votes out of three thousand cast. Then the cancer.\n\nFrom the marked page Leo’s photo at age sixteen looked warily out over Math Club, Science Club, Chess Club, Honor Society. Young gawky prig thinks he’s on his way to a Nobel Prize.\n\nOn the opposite page was Chazz Hollis, his best friend. Curly blond hair, open smile. Orchestra, Band, Swim Team, Track, Language Club, Key Club. Summer days in Chazz’s cool basement. Leo used his father’s keys to swipe chemicals from the high school lab. Potassium nitrate, aluminum, sulfur. Outside the sun bleached, the hot wind scoured the world. They bicycled to the edge of town to set off bombs, out where tank tracks remained from Patton’s army training to fight Rommel. Or they drove out to Edwards to watch pilots rack up flight time with touch-and-go "
