        "text": "Jack Kuney, who produced and directed some of early television’s most widely praised shows, and who also produced a rarely seen, made-for-television farce by Woody Allen that lampooned the Nixon administration, died on Nov. 7 in Bradenton, Fla. He was 88 and had lived in Bradenton in recent years.\n\nThe cause was heart failure, his daughter, Jo Ellen Kuney, said.\n\nMr. Kuney (pronounced KYOO-nee) was known in particular as a producer of “The Play of the Week,” a drama anthology broadcast in the late 1950s and early ’60s by WNTA-TV, Channel 13. (A New York-area television station, WNTA was a forerunner of WNET.)\n\nAmong the plays Mr. Kuney produced for the program were Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” starring Burgess Meredith and Zero Mostel; Ben Jonson’s “Volpone,” starring Alfred Drake and Jo Van Fleet; and “archy and mehitabel,” a musical by George Kleinsinger, Joe Darion and Mel Brooks. Based on the World War I-era newspaper column by Don Marquis about a poetic cockroach and his feline muse, the production had appeared briefly on Broadway in 1957 as “Shinbone Alley.” The television version starred Eddie Bracken and Tammy Grimes.\n\nFor CBS, Mr. Kuney was an early producer of “Look Up and Live,” the long-running Sunday-morning anthology program, begun in the 1950s, that explored religious subjects through song, drama and dance. For NBC, he produced the children’s program “1, 2, 3 — Go,” first broadcast in 1961 and starring a 10-year-old Richard Thomas.\n\nJulius Harry Kuney, known as Jack, was born in Chicago on July 24, 1919. He received a bachelor’s degree in communications from the University of Illinois, and in World War II served with the Navy in the Pacific.\n\nMr. Kuney, who won several New York Emmys, held positions with the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, CBS, NBC and public television and as an independent producer. In the 1980s, he directed the master of fine arts program in television production at Brooklyn College.\n\nMr. Kuney’s first wife, the former Francine Apfelbaum, a dancer known professionally as Francine Ames, died in 1997. Besides his daughter, of Gaithersburg, Md., he is survived by his second wife, Margaret Ferren Kuney; a son, Scott, of West Nyack, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.\n\nAt WNET, Mr. Kuney produced Mr. Allen’s 25-minute film “Men of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story.” A mock documentary intercut with real historical footage, the film starred Mr. Allen as Harvey Wallinger, a thinly veiled Henry A. Kissinger, then the national security adviser. Louche, lecherous and intellectually pretentious (he earned a Ph.D. from Harvard in needlepoint), Harvey is shown conniving his way to the top as an aide to President Richard M. Nixon.\n\nMr. Allen made “Men of Crisis,” which also starred Louise Lasser and Diane Keaton, as a lark in late 1971. It was placed on WNET’s schedule for February 1972. But nervous PBS managers pulled the film before broadcast. Few people have seen it.\n\nThough “Men of Crisis” is considered a charming historical curiosity today, the suppression of Mr. Allen’s film, Mr. Kuney suggested, may not have been a catastrophic loss to American aesthetics.\n\n“He wrote it in 10 days,” Mr. Kuney told The New York Times in 1997. He added: “It really wasn’t a very good movie. He didn’t have time to work on it.”"
