        "text": "1971 American film\n\nMen of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger StoryDirected byWoody AllenWritten byWoody AllenProduced byJack KuneyStarringWoody Allen\n\nDiane Keaton\n\nJean De BaerNarrated byReed HadleyEdited byEric Albertson\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n25 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglish\n\nMen of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story is a short film directed by Woody Allen in 1971. It is a satirization of the Richard Nixon administration[1] made in mockumentary style.[2][3]\n\nAllen plays Harvey Wallinger, a thinly disguised version of Henry Kissinger.[3] The short was produced as a television special for PBS and was scheduled to air in February 1972, but it was pulled from the schedule shortly before its airdate, as PBS officials reportedly feared it would affect their government funding support.[1][2] Allen, who had previously sworn off television work, cited it as an example of why he should \"stick to movies\".[2] The special never aired, but it can now be viewed in The Paley Center for Media,[4] and is often found on YouTube.\n\nTwo of Allen's regular leading ladies, Louise Lasser and Diane Keaton, make appearances, as does Richard Nixon-lookalike Richard M. Dixon. Actor Reed Hadley narrates.[5] The fictional characters are interspersed with newsreel footage of Hubert Humphrey, Spiro Agnew and Nixon in embarrassing public moments. Allen later explored this style in his 1983 film Zelig.[1][3]"
