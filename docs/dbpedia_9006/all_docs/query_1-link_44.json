        "text": "For a couple of decades now, there have been intermittent rumors about it, and sometimes a mention in a book or magazine. Fifteen years ago, one quarterly devoted several pages to it, but around the New York PBS station WNET, where the 25-minute film was produced on the cheap in 1971, there had not been a sighting for ages.\n\nThe film may be the least publicly viewed work by Woody Allen, a raucous sendup of the Nixon administration, replete with slapstick that recalls Bananas, juxtapositions of fictional characters and historical clips reminiscent of Zelig, and chatter about sexual foibles in line with the dialogue in just about every one of Allen's movies.\n\nThe film, Men of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story, was completed just in time to be shown as Richard Nixon, then hugely popular, was about to kick off his triumphant re-election campaign.\n\nPerhaps for this reason, it never was broadcast.\n\nWNET president William Baker said he had been hearing about the film since he took his job 10 years ago. Tantalized, he asked about it around the office from time to time.\n\nA few weeks ago, he found a cassette of the movie on his desk, courtesy of Mary Ann Donahue, a station executive who had worked on the film. Now he would like to broadcast it, he said, although securing approval from Allen and others involved in the project would be necessary.\n\nAllen, who undertook the film without a commission from WNET and offered it to the station without charge, declined to be interviewed about Wallinger, but his longtime producer, Charles Joffe, said he doubted Allen would give his approval.\n\nStill, Baker said he was fascinated by the movie. \"I love it, and I'm going to find a way to show it,\" he said, adding that he hoped to find a way to work with Allen.\n\nIn the film, Allen plays Nixon's top aide, the scrawny, lascivious Dr. Harvey Wallinger, who got his Ph.D. in needlepoint at Harvard and set a record by graduating 96th in a class of 95.\n\n\"Nothing gets done at the White House without Harvey Wallinger,\" the narrator intones portentously, newsreel style.\n\nLouise Lasser and Diane Keaton make appearances, as does the Nixon look-alike Richard M. Dixon. Their scenes are interspersed with news clips of politicians bumbling: Sen. Hubert Humphrey in academic robes stumbling on a college stage, Vice President Spiro Agnew swatting his doubles partner with a serve during a tennis game and Nixon delivering some of his less effective public statements.\n\nThe movie was made when Allen had a few weeks of free time after making Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask). \"He had a hiatus,\" said Jack Kuney, the producer of Wallinger. \"He wrote it in 10 days.\" WNET had put the film on its schedule for February 1972.\n\nThe film was made at Columbia University, Kuney said. \"It really wasn't a very good movie. He didn't have time to work on it.\"\n\nDonahue, the director of programing at WNET, who was an assistant producer on the film, said, \"We knew the networks wouldn't come near us.\" She added, \"We just assumed the only place you could do that was on public TV.\"\n\nBut even for public television, a lot of the film was too risque, and apparently too politically risky. Officials at the station and at PBS particularly objected to one gibe at Nixon's wife, Pat, said James Day, a Brooklyn College professor who was president of WNET at the time. In the film, Wallinger, looking directly at the camera, says: \"Pat Nixon occasionally calls me, you know, and says, you know: \"Dick's not home. Come on over. He's on a European trip or something.' But I try to discourage that kind of thing, because I just don't think it's right.\"\n\nEric Lax, a biographer of Allen, said the filmmaker thought Wallinger innocuous and funny in parts and not over the line for public television.\n\nBut the managers at PBS disagreed. They sent messages to their member stations saying that although PBS would not distribute the film, the stations were free to broadcast it. But they were warned that legal issues involved could jeopardize the stations' licenses. These issues included equal-time regulations for other presidential candidates, as well as for people who, like Mrs. Nixon, were portrayed critically in the film.\n\nOthers, however, looked at this reasoning as a smoke screen.\n\n\"They were afraid to kill it because they'd look chicken,\" Day said. \"But they didn't want to upset the politicians and get their money cut.\" At the time, public television was especially nervous about losing its government support, which Nixon had vowed to cut.\n\nA satire called Come to Florida Before It's Gone, starring the comic Stanley Myron Handelman, ran instead of Wallinger. And Allen moved on from Wallinger without looking back, Lax said. \"That's Woody's genius,\" he said. \"He always has more ideas.\"\n\nStill, said Donahue: \"It's definitely classic Woody Allen. And it's definitely time-capsule stuff.\""
