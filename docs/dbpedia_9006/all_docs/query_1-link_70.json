        "text": "Woody Allen is a director, actor, screenwriter, comedian, playwright, musician, story writer, essayist, and patron saint of Your Mileage May Vary.\n\nHis real name is Allen Stewart Konigsberg. He is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent -- which is obvious from Konigsberg, but less so from his official stage name.\n\nHe was born in 1935 in New York City, where most of his movies are set. He even named one of his great films Manhattan.\n\nHis childhood wasn't particularly happy, and so he began writing dark-tinged humor -- and was already selling the occasional joke by his mid-teens.\n\nAt seventeen, he entered NYU and the City College, but was quickly expelled. He started to write scripts to shows like The Tonight Show, appeared in Candid Camera segments like when he had temp secretaries dictating a love letter, and doing Stand Up Comedy exaggerating his own traits. He's never stopped, though the medium, and eventually the Author Avatar, has varied. Among other traits, his character is nearly always a Sickly Neurotic Geek, and full of Jewish Complaining.\n\nHe started directing movies in 1965. Since then, he has directed 41 movies that range from Screwball Comedy to Drama. He was nominated for an Academy Award twenty-one times, including a record fourteen nominations for Best Screenplay. He has won four Academy Awards -- three for Best Screenplay (Annie Hall; Hannah and Her Sisters and Midnight in Paris) and one for Best Director (Annie Hall). His Annie Hall famously beat Star Wars for the Best Picture Oscar. Allen himself is not really interested in awards; he showed up at the Oscars ceremony only once in 2002, when he encouraged producers to continue filming their movies in New York after 9/11.\n\nMost of his comedies have a certain amount of drama, varying with his mood over time. Most of his dramas have a certain amount of comedy, but the comedy is more diluted in them.\n\nThe soundtracks of his movies tend to be jazz music and old (as in 1920s-1930s) standards, no matter when or where the film is set. He did write a musical once, Everyone Says I Love You, but the songs are all lifted directly from that era.\n\nHe's undergone psychoanalysis for 30 years. Exactly what good it's doing, no one knows, but his experience with psychiatrists has made its way into numerous works.\n\nHe's also notorious for being a heavy womanizer. He has been involved with Diane Keaton, Louise Lasser, Harlene Rosen, Stacey Nelka, Mia Farrow -- and Soon-Yi Previn, Mia's adopted daughter (and thus Woody's former quasi-step daughter). Naturally, almost every single plotline of his scripts is about sex, adultery and relationships, among other interesting things.\n\nHe also plays the clarinet and has written humorous essays and short stories. (There's one about Count Dracula who finds what looks like a perfect lunch -- only to find out he woke up during a solar eclipse. And the apartment is Danish modern with no shades.)\n\nWhile his work in the 70s and 80s are all almost universally loved by fans his films of the 90s and (especially) the 00s are divisive amongst critics and audiences with Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and (most recently) Midnight in Paris receiving high praise while other pictures- namely The Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Ending- being not well thought of by most. It should be noted, however, that even the most critically derided films of his filmography still tend to have a few fans here and there.\n\nA somewhat abridged list of movies is presented here:\n\nWhat's New Pussycat? (1965) - Woody Allen's first movie (although it was directed by Clive Donner). Peter O'Toole tries to be faithful to his fiancee, but he's a Chick Magnet. Peter Sellers is his psychoanalyst, who is stalking one of his patient's stalkers in a motel in France. Allen plays O'Toole's friend who has a crush on the fiancee. The film originally going to star Warren Beatty, but when Woody was hired to rewrite it, he kept building up a bit part for himself and shrinking Beatty's role so blatantly that the star quit.\n\nWhat's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966) - A secret agent is sent to Sim Sim Salabim to find a lost egg salad recipe. Gag Dubbed from a Japanese movie.\n\nCasino Royale 1967 - Not written or directed by Woody Allen, but he plays Jimmy Bond, James Bond's \"disappointing\" nephew, who is the head of SMERSH and plans to kill all men over 4' 6\" tall, so that he gets all the girls.\n\nTake the Money and Run (1969) - A Mockumentary focusing on an incompetent, petty thief. Co-written by Woody Allen. His debut as a full-fledged director.\n\nMen of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story (1971) - A short Mockumentary satirizing Richard Nixon's politics. Made for PBS, but they were afraid of losing their government support, so it was never aired.\n\nBananas (1971) - To impress a girl, Woody Allen learns to be a revolutionary in a Banana Republic. Hilarity Ensues.\n\nPlay It Again Sam (1972) - A neurotic Woody Allen tries to date other women following the advice of Humphrey Bogart's ghost.\n\nEverything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) (1972) - A series of sketches providing parodic answers to such questions as \"What are sex perverts?\" and \"What is sodomy?\"\n\nSleeper (1973) - A health-food store owner is cryonically frozen (without his consent) for 200 years only to find that the 22nd century America is a police state ruled by a nose. Yes, a nose.\n\nLove and Death (1975) - An Affectionate Parody of Dostoyevsky's and Tolstoy's romances. Also the start of Allen's Tom Hanks Syndrome.\n\nThe Front (1976) - This Martin Ritt-directed comedy-drama stars Allen as a bookie who lends his name to television screenplays written by his blacklisted friend during the anti-Communist Witch Hunt of the '50s.\n\nAnnie Hall (1977) - Woody Allen's most famous movie -- and, perhaps, along with Manhattan, his best (though Allen himself doesn't think much of either of them). It focuses on the difficult relationship between a comedian and the ditzy Annie Hall. In the end, they split up. Winner of four Academy Awards: Best Picture (for which it beat Star Wars), Best Director (Allen), and Best Screenplay (Allen), Best Actress (Diane Keaton). (Allen was also nominated for Best Actor.)\n\nInteriors (1978) - Three sisters find their lives spinning out of control after their parents' divorce. Woody Allen's first Tear Jerker.\n\nManhattan (1979) - Woody Allen in an intricate Love Dodecahedron with a seventeen-year-old girl, Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. Probably his second most beloved movie, after Annie Hall. Allen considered the film such an abject disaster that he told the studio he'd make another for free if they didn't release it.\n\nStardust Memories (1980) - While attending a retrospect of his work, a filmmaker (guess who) recalls his life and his loves: the inspirations for his films. Also the one that gave critics and fans the phrases \"the early, funny ones\" and \"the later, serious ones\".\n\nA Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982) - At the dawn of the 20th century, a philosopher, a womanizing doctor and their fiancées spend a weekend in the house of a Mad Scientist and his wife. Everyone ends up sneaking off behind everyone else's backs.\n\nZelig (1983) - A Mockumentary: In The Great Depression, a man named Leonard Zelig involuntarily assumes the traits of the people surrounding him. He uses this ability to blend in with famous historical people and events and bed women.\n\nBroadway Danny Rose (1984) - A talent agent attempts to reconcile a lounge singer with his mistress, Tina Vitale.

Between two Thanksgivings, a Love Dodecahedron makes three sisters switch their husbands. Oscar winners: Dianne Weist, Michael Caine\n\nRadio Days (1987) - A Narrator tells the story of his youth and the influence of radio in it.\n\nSeptember (1987) - Yet another Love Dodecahedron, and a tragic story relating mother-daughter relationship, influenced by Ingmar Bergman. Inspired by stage play TV broadcasts. Allen filmed the whole movie, then threw out the whole cast, and started again with a new cast.\n\nAnother Woman (1988) - A philosophy teacher observes the everyday of another woman and decides to change everything bad in her own life.\n\nOedipus Wrecks (1989) - A short film (part of New York Stories) about a lawyer who makes his Large Ham Jewish Mother disappear in an illusionist act.

She visits an herbalist that gives her three kinds of herbs which provide her with super-powers so she can straighten up her life.\n\nShadows And Fog (1991) - An homeage to German Expressionism, a vigilante mob tries to catch a Serial Killer in the midst of a circus.\n\nHusbands and Wives (1992) - When their best friends announce that they're separating, a professor and his wife discover the faults in their marriage.\n\nManhattan Murder Mystery (1993) - A nosy housewife drags her reluctant husband into an amateur investigation of their neighbour's death.\n\nBullets Over Broadway (1994) - A Wide-Eyed Idealist playwright has to cast a talentless woman into the leading role of his Broadway play, because she's the girlfriend of a violent mobster.\n\nDon't Drink the Water (1994) - An American family is trapped in a US embassy behind the Iron Curtain while the ambassador's incompetent son is in charge. Based on his 1966 play, this TV adaptation was directed by Allen, who was dissatisfied with the earlier 1969 film adaptation.\n\nMighty Aphrodite (1995) - An Affectionate Parody of Greek tragedies set in New York. Hilarity Ensues. Oscar winner: Mira Sorvino\n\nEveryone Says I Love You (1996) - A Musical about a New York girl who manipulates the relationships of everyone around her.\n\nDeconstructing Harry (1997) - The Deconstructive Parody of a Deconstruction.\n\nCelebrity (1998) - After his divorce, a man blows every chance he has to be famous, while his ex-wife reaches stardom without doing much. Stars Kenneth Branagh doing a Woody Allen impression.\n\nAntz (1998) - An ant saves his colony from drowning at the hands of his General. A Shout-Out to Metropolis. (As with The Front, Allen didn't write it or direct it, but he starred in it, and his character seems to have been tailored specifically for him.)\n\nSweet And Lowdown (1999) - A Mockumentary about a fictional Jerkass jazz guitarist.\n\nSmall Time Crooks (2000) - A man tries to rob a bank by digging a tunnel from an old restaurant he bought. His wife covers up the scheme by selling cookies from the restaurant.

Notable in that it can easily be seen as a remake of Annie Hall.\n\nMelinda And Melinda (2004) - A group of screenwriters write two stories with the same premise to discover if life is tragic or comic.\n\nMatch Point (2005) - A former professional tennis player is torn between his rich, high society wife and his lower class, sexually adventurous mistress.

Oscar winner: Penélope Cruz.\n\nWhatever Works (2009) - Woody Allen returns to New York. Larry David becomes a Lemony Narrator (Breaking the Fourth Wall several times) of his own life.
