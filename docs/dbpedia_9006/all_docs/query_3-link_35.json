        "text": "In his new Amazon comedy series “Crisis in Six Scenes,” 80-year-old Woody Allen plays Sidney, an ad writer-turned book-writer and aspiring TV-comedy writer, who’s been long married to Kay, a marriage counselor (played by 84-year-old Elaine May, Allen’s longtime pal). Their life gets upended by a feisty young house guest (Miley Cyrus). But as far as we can tell, there’s no romance between that character and Allen’s.\n\nAnd that’s precisely why we’ve seen Allen acting less and less in his own projects in recent years, according to an explanation the Oscar-winning writer-director gave reporters at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n“For years, I played the romantic lead, and then I couldn't play it any longer, because I got too old to play it, and it's no fun just not playing the guy who gets the girl,” he said.\n\nWhile Allen arguably never really qualified as the leading-man type, in his own films, he certainly did cast himself in that role many times.\n\nRelated: Woody Allen, cast talk about Amazon TV series launching Sept. 30\n\nAllen’s imdb resume includes 76 credits as a writer, 53 as a director and 49 as an actor.\n\nHere are 10 of his most memorable films — all of which he wrote or co-wrote and all but one of which he directed — in which Allen usually, improbably got the girl, if only temporarily sometimes.\n\n“Take the Money and Run” (1969): Allen’s inept bank robber character Virgil Starkwell had some wonderful moments in this mockumentary, which uses voiceover narration and interviews with his friends and family (including highly critical parents, wearing nose glasses) to tell the story of Virgil’s early years and failures. The beautiful Janet Margolin played his wide-eyed wife Louise.\n\n“Bananas” (1971): Allen, as New York consumer products tester Fielding Mellish, got dumped by his activist girlfriend, whose rejection prompted him to travel to a tiny Latin American nation and lead its latest rebellion. The girlfriend was played by Allen’s second wife, Louise Lasser. The two divorced in 1970.\n\n“Play It Again, Sam” (1972): In this film, directed by Herbert Ross, Allen played Allan, a neurotic film critic who’s obsessed with the 1942 movie “Casablanca.” He attempts to get back into the dating world after a marital breakup — with the help of a married couple, Dick and Linda (Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton, Allen’s romantic partner in the early 1970s) and his screen idol, Humphrey Bogart (Jerry Lacy). Allan eventually gets involved with Linda.\n\n“Sleeper” (1973): He was Miles Monroe, a nerdy musician and health-food store owner who, in the 20th Century, goes in for routine surgery, but, after a mishap and cryogenic preservation, wakes up to find himself 200 years in the future — and a brave new world where there are Orgasmatron booths, confessional robots and anti-government radicals want him to help them overthrow the oppressive government. (Keaton played a socialite turned rebel - and love interest.)\n\n“Annie Hall” (1977): His Alvy Singer is a twice divorced, neurotic, 40-year-old New York Jewish stand-up comic, reflecting on the demise of his latest relationship, to the beautiful, flighty, insecure, charming, WASPy Midwestern night club singer Annie Hall (Keaton).\n\n“Manhattan” (1979): Allen’s Isaac Davis, 42, has just quit his job as a writer for a television comedy and is paying two alimonies (his second ex-wife, played by Meryl Streep, is penning a nasty tell-all book about their split). In a plot line that creepily foreshadowed real-life developments, Allen’s character is dating Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), a 17-year-old high-school student. Then, he meets a journalist named Mary (Keaton again).\n\n“Zelig” (1983): Allen was the title character in this faux documentary — Leonard Zelig, a man who could look and act like whoever he’s around and turns up in various historical events. One of his co-stars was Mia Farrow, Allen’s partner from 1980 to 1992, who starred in 10 of his films.\n\n“Broadway Danny Rose” (1984): In his most endearing turn, Allen played the title character, a hapless talent agent with a stable of eccentric talents, whose attempts to hold onto his one promising client — married lounge singer Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte) — leads him to play “beard” to the guy’s tough-talking mistress, Tina Vitale (a brilliant Farrow). In the process, Danny runs afoul of the mob.\n\n“Hannah and Her Sisters” (1986): He played the hypochondriacal ex-husband of Hannah (Farrow), who gets into a relationship with her sister Holly (Dianne Wiest), while Hannah’s current husband (Michael Caine) falls for another of Hannah’s sisters (Barbara Hershey). Farrow and Allen broke up six years later, when she discovered Allen was having an affair with her then 21-year-old adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, who moved in with Allen. They’ve been married since 1997 and have two adopted daughters."
