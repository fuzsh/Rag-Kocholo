        "text": "Art plays a key role in the lives of Woody Allen's film characters. Many of them are writers, filmmakers or musicians; others, although not artists themselves, display a keen sensibility to appreciate art. The purpose of this article is to explore how this characterization trait significantly determines the nature of the characters, the ways in which they interact with each other, and even the fate they deserve within the plot. Art, in its many different manifestations, helps these characters infuse their lives with a boundless vitality, at the same time that it becomes a source of beauty and refuge. Furthermore, art plays a vital role in shaping romantic relationships as well as in enabling characters to achieve self-knowledge, both of which come close to the idea of happiness in Woody Allen's poetic universe. At the same time, together with this recognition of the redeeming potential of art, a poetic punishment is inflicted frequently in Allen's films on the characters that approach art with spurious intentions, as well as a stern warning of the vital unhappiness to which its enshrinement leads.\n\n“The reality I speak of here is the same one Hobbes described, but a little smaller” , writes Woody Allen between parentheses in “My Philosophy”, a text first published in The New Yorker, in the early years of his collaboration with the magazine. This sentence, through its insertion in a mock-philosophical essay presenting itself as a writer’s manifesto and through its explanatory potential marked by the brackets, invites an extrapolative reading that can encompass Woody Allen’s entire prose work. Therefore, the case can be made that the reality of Allen’s short fiction presents the world as bodies in motion governed by the fear-desire principle, the soul as mortal, the individual caught in theological conundrums and struggling in a life that is “solitary, poor, nasty, and short” – of course, on a smaller scale, ironically deflated by self-mockery and metafictional gestures. This view of the world becomes the working principle of Woody Allen’s world construction strategies and constitutes the ethos underlying his entire fiction. But that’s not all there is to it. If we keep with the extrapolating exercise initiated above, this sentence also reflects the cultural forces that have influenced Allen’s writing since the beginning of his career: The New Yorker school of fiction, postmodernism, and Jewish culture. It presupposes a certain degree of erudition from the reader, as much of the fiction published in The New Yorker does; it gestures playfully and self-reflexively towards the very act of writing, a technique typical of postmodernist writing; and it reflects the self-belittling tendencies characteristic of the tradition of Jewish humor. It also legitimizes an extensive exploration of all of the above, which is precisely what this work intends to do.\n\nEver the one to serve up old whines in new battles, Woody Allen replays familiar themes and strategies in his three new one-act plays. Indeed, the familiarity of his material by now approximates to ritual. But a close examination finds fresh nuance and development. Moreover, as their coincidental language and themes make the plays a triptych, even a familiar element gains new meaning from the enlarged context. Like most of his films since Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979), the trilogy deals with amoral rationalization, betrayal, and infidelity among the urbane intelligentsia. As he anatomizes his neighborhood’s Civilization and Its Discontents, each title cites a location that connotes class, affluence, and sophistication— “Riverside Drive,” “Old Saybrook,” “Central Park West”—yet the relationships prove savage. The first and third refer to Allen’s own Upper West Side. The first play’s hero, Jim Swain, lives at Central Park West and 78th. The middle setting offers escape, to th...\n\nAlthough normally utilizing parody and humor when dealing with film noir, Woody Allen has made two films that deal more directly with the style and themes of classical noir cinema: Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) and Match Point (2005). Both films differ from classical film noir, however, in the protagonist’s ability to enter into the criminal underworld and return unscathed by the experience. Whereas classical noir protagonists are isolated and unable to enter (or re-enter) everyday society, the protagonists in Allen’s films are able to do so, moving the focus of these films from an existentialist “fate” of the classical noir to an individualized morality based on choice and reason. This essay examines the noir elements of both Crimes and Misdemeanors and Match Point in an effort to expand current academic understanding of Woody Allen’s film oeuvre.
