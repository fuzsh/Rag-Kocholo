        "text": "78 years old and still going strong, Woody Allen continues the prolific streak that he’s maintained for decades. While he’s got \"Magic In The Moonlight\" hitting theaters this month, he’s already filming his next movie, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone, and moreover, financiers are so confident in his work ethic, the director told The New York Times he’s got financing secured for his next four movies. And for most of his career, this has been the case, with Allen’s films usually turning a profit, costing little and getting wide distribution. But there is one that you likely haven’t seen.\n\nBack in early ’70s, between \"Take The Money And Run\" and \"Bananas,\" Allen headed to PBS where he dropped the half-hour mockumentary, \"Men Of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story.\" The brief movie is skewing of Nixon administration, with Allen playing the Henry Kissinger-esque titular character. But he wasn’t a fan of the finished result and PBS balked at airing it anyway, fearing Nixon would cut funding to the network. But it is very much worth a watch, as it features future Allen regular Diane Keaton and Louise Lasser. Check it out below. [via We Got This Covered]"
