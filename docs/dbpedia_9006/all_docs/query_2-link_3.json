        "text": "Annie Hall\n\nIn today’s climate, it may no longer be in vogue to offer a laudatory assessment of Woody Allen’s 1977 Oscar-winner, Annie Hall but, dammit, this is a really good movie and doesn’t deserve the opprobrium it sometimes receives because of ...\n\nBlue Jasmine\n\nIt's all about Cate. Blue Jasmine, Woody Allen's latest, is a loose reworking of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. It's narratively uneven but the occasional lapses of focus are rescued by Cate Blanchett's riveting lead performance. Th...\n\nBullets over Broadway\n\nSure as the turning of the leaves, this time of the year, fresh with the scent of Oscars to come, brings the release of a new Woody Allen motion picture.

The poor performance of the Disney-ba...\n\nMagic in the Moonlight\n\nWorking at his current pace, Woody Allen delivers one film per year. Unfortunately, it has been decades since Allen's endeavors have been consistently good. In fact, even as far back as the 1990s, quality movies have been more the exception than th...\n\nManhattan\n\nThere are three kinds of Woody Allen movies: the comedies, the dramas, and the hybrids.
