        "text": "From \"The Godfather\" trilogy to \"Annie Hall\" to \"The First Wives Club,\" Oscar winner Diane Keaton has starred in many of the iconic films of the last 30 years.\n\nHer latest project, \"Something's Gotta Give,\" has Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves romantically pursuing her character.\n\nFull of laughter and flirtation, Keaton tells co-anchor Harry Smith that working with Nicholson and Reeves was a lot of fun.\n\n\"It was the most wonderful experience professionally I've had in so long. I mean, imagine. Imagine having the opportunity to fall in love and have men really love you back. It's all in the writing. And it's not real life, so sweet.\"\n\nAnd she notes, \"Nancy Meyers ('Father of the Bride,''The Parent Trap,''I Love Trouble,' 'Private Benjamin'), the director, is a great comic writer.\"\n\nWhat is interesting is that Keaton decides to bare it all in this film, having been the one to keep her clothes on decades ago when she did the ground-breaking \"Hair.\"\n\nSo why now?\n\nKeaton says, \"I thought it was in the service of a fantastic joke, number one. And then, number two: I thought that it made the movie more authentic. Because intimacy is so delicate and I also think, hey, you know, I'm 57. I have a body, what's the problem? It still works.\"\n\nKeaton's character advises her daughter, played by Amanda Pete, to let go and let herself love people. Asked if she believes in that, Keaton says, \"Totally completely. And I don't think it's over. I think for women who are in their 30s, I think they should know the future is ripe.\"\n\nSome Facts About Diane Keaton\n\nDiane Hall was born in Los Angeles, Calif., on Jan. 5, 1946.\n\nIn 1968, Keaton made her Broadway debut in \"Hair,\" becoming known as the girl who would not remove her clothes in the Act 1 finale.\n\nIn 1969, Keaton acted opposite Woody Allen in the Broadway production of Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" and received a Tony nomination as featured actress in a play.\n\nIn 1970, the actress made her film acting debut in \"Lovers and Other Strangers.\"\n\nIn 1971, Keaton starred opposite Allen in the writer-director's \"lost\" 25-minute short \"Men of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story.\" The film was shelved by PBS in 1972 due to its subject matter (film purported Wallinger was the man behind Richard Nixon); the short movie was discovered in 1997 at WNET in New York City.\n\nIn 1972, Keaton had her first feature opposite Allen, reprising her stage role in \"Play It Again, Sam.\" Also that year, the actress played the wife of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather.\"\n\nIn 1973, Keaton co-starred opposite Woody Allen (who also wrote and directed the film) in the futuristic comedy \"Sleeper.\"\n\nIn 1974, Keaton reprised role of Kay Corleone in \"The Godfather, Part II.\"\n\nIn 1975, the actress reunited with Allen for \"Love and Death,\" a spoof of Russian literature that owed more than a passing debt to \"War and Peace.\"\n\nIn 1977, Keaton earned a Best Actress Oscar as \"Annie Hall.\"\n\nIn 1978, Keaton starred in Allen's \"Interiors,\" the writer-director's first screen drama.\n\nIn 1979, the actress starred in \"Manhattan.\"\n\nIn 1981, Keaton portrayed Louise Bryant to Warren Beatty's John Reed in Beatty's epic \"Reds\" and garnered a Best Actress Oscar nomination.\n\nIn 1982, Keaton acted opposite Albert Finney in Alan Parker's \"Shoot the Moon,\" portraying a wife in a collapsing marriage.
