        "meta_description": "2024/06/30 - Diane Keaton as Renata Wallinger.\n\nPLOT:  A mockumentary that follows the fictional career of Harvey Wallinger, ostensible chief aide and lifelong adviser to Richard Nixon.  Wallinger gives Nixon advice over the course of his career and, in numerous interviews, catalogs the attitudes, skills, and insight that made Nixon as great as Nixon thought he was.\n\nWritten/directed/starring Woody Allen.  Keaton plays his long suffering wife.\n\nThis 30 minute short film was scheduled to run on PBS but thanks to pressure from the actual Nixon White House, it was pulled from the schedule.  It was the last television project Allen would work on for over three decades.  Seek it out on YouTube for a good half hour laugh.",
