        "text": "A total of thirty films by Woody Allen will be screened, supplemented by films by others in which he acts, documentaries about his work and classics that inspired him. Most of the films come from Eye's collection and are screened on celluloid, as Allen prefers to see it.\n\nWhat makes Woody Allen one of the most brilliant comedians of the past hundred years? In The Comedies of Woody Allen, Eye highlights his extensive oeuvre, from the rarely seen 'early, funny ones' of the early 1970s to his latest film Irrational Man.\n\nWoody Allen (1935) made his debut as a stand-up comedian in 1961, after which he wrote a number of successful plays for Broadway and took his first steps in film as an actor (including What's New Pussycat, Casino Royale), until it became clear to him that he wanted to make films. Since his debut film Whatâ€™s Up, Tiger Lily (1966), Allen has directed 46 films, a significant number of which have been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nAt the same time, his work reflects film history, from Bergman and Fellini's art cinema to the comedies of Chaplin and The Marx Brothers. Allen's uniqueness is that he manages to bring together (and deride) high European culture and American popular culture in films that deal almost exclusively with relationships and are ultimately nothing more or less than moral narratives about our time."
