        "text": "an the arts be satisfied with a role as a supplier of consumer goods on the cultural industry market? Or is it time to focus more on the political implications of art in order to deal more proactively with contemporary social issues?\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, when the industrial revolution had unhinged the old world, the response of modern art was a socio-politically understood programme for the reconciliation of science, technology and society through art.\n\nSince the 1970s, this programme has been considered a failure. The unleashed economy of the post-industrial age and globalization have brought the earth to the brink of ecological collapse and exacerbated social injustice. At the same time, the late effects of colonization and the digital revolution have posed new cultural and political challenges. More profound changes are ahead than those of the industrial revolution.\n\nThinkingJewellery XII gathers - with jewellery in mind - exemplary analyses and discusses perspectives for action under the aspect of political premises.\n\nProgram:\n\n\"Nur sauber gekämmt sind wir wirklich frei\" - Politische Aspekte in Schmuckobjekten von B.S. im Kontext ihrer Zeit.\n\nBERNHARD SCHOBINGER\n\n(NOTE: Lecture of approx. 2,5 hrs in German/\n\nHINWEIS: Vortrag von ca. 2,5 Stunden in deutscher Sprache)\n\n“See through your life, your life is a scheme\n\nPressed by TV and these magazines\n\nI look at you and you look at me\n\nWhat are you trying to be?\n\nDein Sacko sitzt so sackgerecht\n\nDein Herz passt auf den rechten Fleck\n\nYes, we are made in Germany\n\nNur sauber gekämmt sind wir wirklich frei\n\nNur sauber gekämmt sind wir wirklich frei\n\nNur sauber gekämmt sind wir\n\nWirklich frei“\n\nAusschnitt Songtext «Man of Stone», Hans-A-Plast, 1979\n\nSchmuck als Manifest einer Haltung ist allein im Kontext seiner Zeit zu verstehen.\n\nIn Zentren urbaner Subkulturen des Westens zeichnete sich seit den späten 1970er Jahren ein grundlegender Paradigmenwechsel ab, der sich einer völlig neuen Ästhetik als Ausdrucksmittel bediente.

Wütend und lustvoll, sarkastisch und zynisch erscheint sie in Bildender Kunst, Musik, Tanz, Mode und Lebensstil: Eine Revolte gegen Rassismus, Faschismus, Imperialismus und Krieg, antiautoritär, feministisch, anarchisch.\n\nBernhard Schobinger\n\ngeboren 1946 in Zürich, Schweiz,\n\n1962 Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich,\n\n1963 Goldschmiedelehre,\n\n1968 eigene Goldschmiedewerkstatt in Richterswil,\n\nzahlreiche Ausstellungen, Preise, Vorträge und Workshops weltweit.\n\nwww.schobinger.ch/about/bernhard-schobinger\n\nJewellery - resources and material in the context of politics and power\"\n\nDR. CLAUDIA BANZ\n\nMaterial structures society and nature in relation to one another. It is both a driver of innovation and a driver of destruction. The extraction of raw materials transforms nature into a commodity and forces the exploitation of natural resources as well as people. In parallel, the appropriation of material generates cultural phenomena such as money, tools, weapons, jewellery and objects; economic processes such as trade and commodities. Meanwhile, the exploitation of materials for mass consumption has led to the great ecological crisis. Precious and rare materials have been used to create decorative objects of all kinds that incorporate and represent social and political hierarchies such as control and domination. In the lecture, various jewelley objects from the collections of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Berlin, ranging from the Wunderkammer to the present, will be examined for the first time for their narratives in the context of the \"Matrix material-power\".\n\nClaudia Banz\n\nborn 1966, is an art historian, exhibition curator and author and currently curator of design at the Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin Preussischer Kulturbesitz. Previously, she was head of the Department of Art and Design at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg. With exhibitions like Fast Fashion. The Dark Side of Fashion, Food Revolution 5.0. Design for Tomorrow's Society or Connecting Afro Futures. Fashion x Hair x Design she focuses on sustainability, resources, responsibility, consumption and decolonial design. Her new series \"Design Lab\" at the Kunstgewerbemuseum presents current positions in the global design discourse. Banz also researches and publishes on/at the interfaces of design, craftsmanship, fashion, art and decolonial collections.\n\n\"Jewellery and Politics - Notes on the History of Jewellery in Germany\" WILHELM LINDEMANN\n\nJewellery is usually associated with a beauty that self-referentially serves only itself. In reality, the stark opposite is the case: it is not only an index of social status that reveals a lot about its wearers. From antiquity to the present, it has been a sign of power and wealth, and precious metals and gemstones are still the preferred materials of jewellery. On the one hand, the lecture refers to the political aspects of German jewellery history in the 20th century, especially before and during the period of National Socialism; on the other hand, it reaches beyond this epoch and refers to current as well as general ethical and also ecological issues.\n\nWilhelm Lindemann\n\nBorn in 1949, after studying philosophy, literature and social work, he worked in cultural management for many years. Producer of plays, festival director and project developer of the Bengel industrial monument, Idar-Oberstein. Long-time lecturer at the Department of Gemstones and Jewellery, Idar-Oberstein, curator of SchmuckDenken and exhibitions, author and publisher of non-fiction books on jewellery and gemstones.\n\n\"pecunia expergisci debet\"\n\nPIETER LEMMENS\n\nFrom a strong social and societal engagement, Pieter Lemmens plays with the relations between art and power in his work and expresses relevant themes of the time. As a witness to his own time, he feels drawn to comment on it in a creative, playful and ironic, but also serious way. Within his umbrella theme, his imaginary company Q P & S, Lemmens creates his views on what is happening in the (art) world when it comes to the dynamics and organisation within the various networks of production, participation, reception and distribution. To this end he pulls out all the stops and, although the aesthetic results of each work are surprisingly different, his own handwriting remains visible, both literally and figuratively. (P. Snoeks)\n\nPieter Lemmens\n\n(*1965) artist, autodidact.\n\nwww.pieterlemmens.nl\n\n\"When Art wants - a personal view on political art\"\n\nPROF. EVA-MARIA KOLLISCHAN\n\nBeing an artist means being a political person, no matter what the artistic work is about. Visual art has a special relationship with our society and history. Art is at the same time a part of society and takes a look at it from the outside. A work of art is something different from a protest or a political action. What can art do, what does it want? What if art wants nothing? This lecture takes a look back at some historical positions in political art and gives a reflection on being an artist in a time like ours, with circumstances that more and more require us to take a clear position and get involved.\n\nEva-Maria Kollischan\n\nis visual artist, born in Nuremberg, based in Cologne and Idar-Oberstein. She studied fine arts at Kunstakademie Münster. Within site specific installation, drawing, painting and photography she is exploring the limits and properties of our perception and spatial imagination. She has been teaching art basics and drawing at Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main, Hochschule der Künste Bremen and others. Since 2014 she is teaching art basics at TUAS, Department for Gemstones and Jewellery.\n\n\"Prints and Politics\"\n\nDR. DORIT SCHÄFER\n\nPrints, because of their reproducibility, play a prominent role in the theme of art and politics. Since the emergence of printmaking in the 15th century, it has been used by artists and rulers to make political statements - as commissioned art by those in power to secure their positions or as resistance by the governed to oppression and injustice. Unlike any other medium, thousands of prints of an artistically worked woodblock, copper plate or litho stone on light, mobile and inexpensive paper allowed the dissemination of theses and motifs that were politically highly explosive. In addition, printmaking offered artists a creative freedom in a wide variety of techniques that inspired them to innovative, sometimes decidedly provocative formulations. Through selected examples from six centuries, the lecture will discuss the history and significance of a medium in which free art and political motivation enter into extraordinary dialogues.\n\nDr. Dorit Schäfer\n\nstudied art history, classical archaeology and French literature in Heidelberg and London. Doctorate in 1998: The Ortenberg Altar - Studies of Middle Rhine Art and Painting Technique around 1400. 1998 - present at the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, where she became head of the Kupferstichkabinett in 2003. Main focus of work in French art of the 18th-20th century and in contemporary drawing and prints. Among the exhibitions at the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, which she curated or in which she collaborated, are worthy of special mention: Jean Siméon Chardin 1699-1779. Werk – Herkunft – Wirkung (1999); J.J. Grandville. Karikatur und Zeichnung (2000); Eugène Delacroix (2003); Stefano delle Bella.

Von Rembrandt zum Selfie (2015); SEHEN DENKEN TRÄUMEN. Französische Zeichnungen aus der Staatlichen Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (2018/19); Alles ist Ausschnitt! Matthias Mansen: Potsdamer Straße (2019); Marcel van Eeden - The Karlsruhe Sketchbook (2019)\n\n\"Identity Markers\"\n\nDAVID BIELANDER\n\nSwiss born, Munich based artist David Bielander takes the familiarity of everyday objects and combines them with a witty abstraction to create truly uncanny artworks. His realm of inquiry encompasses the play of identity, belonging, dissonance, external perceptions and the opinions they create. More than ever actually, he is specifically preoccupied, aware and excited about the potential of these humble objects in connection with us.\n\nBielander doesn’t work in themes or phases. All his works are one oeuvre, one continuously growing single body of work, intertwined, connected and slowly shifting. So previously created works make astounding evolutions. What does it now mean to mimic an animal or a flower in this dystopian reality? Who are we sticking our tongue out at with the iconic rubber lip from 1999? And how does it interact with the 2019 pinocchio nose, carved from the wood of a confessional?\n\nDavid Bielander\n\nBorn in 1968 in Basel. After a four-year apprenticeship as a goldsmith with Kurt Degen, and working as a goldsmith with Georg Spreng in Schwäbisch Gmünd, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1995 to 2001 with Prof. Otto Künzli, where he graduated as a „meister\" student in 2002. From 2006 to 2010 David Bielander was an artistic assistant to Prof. Daniel Kruger at Burg Giebichenstein, University of Art and Design, Halle/Saale, and from 2011 to 2013 an external tutor in the jewellery department, Gerrit Rietveld Academie Amsterdam (NL). Since 2002 he runs a studio in Munich together with the artist Helen Britton, Australia, and Yutaka Minegishi from Tokyo. His work is represented by the galleries S O in Solothurn and London, Ornamentum Gallery in Hudson, NY, Rob Koudijs in Amsterdam, Galerie Funaki in Melbourne, Antonella Villanova in Florence, ATTA gallery Bangkok and Galerie Wittenbrink in Munich.\n\n\"painting space\"\n\nTAMINA AMADYAR\n\nAmadyar's colour is there in extreme clarity, simple, immediate. It stands openly on the bare canvas. Radiantly light, almost floating, the colours transcend their material bondage. They glisten into each other, lift, fade through or arch over each other. Between intimacy and intensity, colour alone carries the pictorial fields in settlement and opposition, turmoil and balance, depicting memories of a youth in Afghanistan.\n\nColour and light unfold a sensuality that points perceptibly beyond the pictures. Only what does Tamina Amadyar bring into the presence? She paints from memory. And in her pictures - hidden in the colour and at the same time revealed by it - places, inconspicuous everyday situations or entire landscapes actually appear as colourful moods, sensations and hunches. A horizon of experience that makes Tamina Amadyar's painting an enormous resonance space.\n\nTamina Amadyar\n\nborn 1989 in Kabul, studied painting at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. Group exhibitions at KIT - Kunst im Tunnel (2011), Contemporary Fine Arts (2015), Eduardo Secci Contemporary (2016), solo exhibitions at Guido W. Baudach (2015), Farbvision (2016). In 2016 she was elected to the Forbes \"30 under 30\" list.\n\nImagination and virtual worlds\n\nBeyond its value of utility , noble material - gold, silver, noble stones - has a lasting existence above all because of its symbolic power. In the field of jewellery, the classic range of materials has been expanded to include many natural materials and plastics that can be recharged. In jewellery, too, art, the old master of fiction, utopian design and thus virtuality, outlasts time: Ars longa - vita brevis.\n\nMeanwhile, it is not only physics that has long since abandoned the traditional notions of \"solid\" matter in dynamic cosmological models. The digital age is revolutionizing people's living conditions and, in particular, their social relations - probably to a greater extent than the invention of book printing at the beginning of the modern era.\n\nVirtuality does not require proof of authenticity, nor real correspondence between material, form and colour. In view of these scenarios, which are also omnipresent, a longing for the authenticity of analog life, for a permanence and value grows, which materializes in the material and thus sensual presence of high-quality, identity-creating goods or in art.\n\nProgram:\n\nSearching for unity – modern physics and its explanation of the cosmos\n\nDr. Sibylle Anderl, astronomer and philosopher, Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble, FR\n\nEdelstein.

Paulus Rainer, Deputy Director of the art chamber and treasury of the KHM - Museum of Art History, Vienna, AT\n\nREACT REACT REACT\n\nSilvia Weidenbach, Jewellery artist, UK\n\nThe process of globalisation in all areas of life, accompanied by the escalation of economic and ecological crises, technological innovations taking place in ever faster succession, a hardly manageable supply of information and communication have led to a growing need for leisure and contemplation on the part of many people - in addition to a feeling of being overtaxed. They are regarded by many people as a source of a regained art of living. The contemplative life design opens the senses for aesthetic experience and creativity. For some it has become the gateway to a new spirituality.\n\nThinkingJewellery X puts the contemplative concept of life to the test. Does it lead to a retreat into the private sphere and a rejection of social responsibility - or can it become a source of strength for creativity and worldliness in the sense of an argument for a peaceful policy based on mindfulness and sustainability?\n\nProgramm:\n\nAesthetic experience and the good life\n\nProf. Dr. Ursula Brandstätter, Musicologist, rector of the Anton Bruckner Private University Linz, AT\n\nPhilosophy – Art – Life\n\nProf. Dr. Julian Nida Rümelin, Professor of Philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, DE, former Minister of Culture\n\nThe metaphorical ornament: philosophy and way of working\n\nProf. Dr. David Huycke, Jewellery artist, professor of Jewellery Design at the MAD-faculty of the University of Hasselt, BE\n\nA vision of homo economicus to homo aestheticus\n\nProf. Dr. Gisela Dischner, German Studies and author, emeritus professor of Modern Literature at the University of Hannover, DE\n\nThe truth of the moment – on the relationship between attention and art\n\nProf. Dr. Yuka Nakamura, Psychologist, lecturer in Development and Health Psychology in the Vice President's education and research dept. of the Zurich University of Teacher Education\n\nBridging the divide: an exploration of collaboration through making\n\nSarah Rhodes, PhD researcher at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London, UK\n\nAesthetic economy – theory and applications\n\nProf. Gernot Böhme, Emeritus professor of Philosophy at the Technical University of Darmstadt, director of the Institute for the Practice of Philosophy (IPPh)\n\nWorthwile\n\nProf. Ute Eitzenhöfer, Jewellery artist, professor of Gemstone Design, Trier University of Applied Sciences, Campus Idar-Oberstein\n\n‘Schmuck-Denken 2009’ places the focus on jewellery as an object. Jewellery can be many things: It definitely comes under the category of loved objects (Habermas), with which their owner develops a very personal relationship. As a personal object which is a part of the character of its wearer, it supports him or her in their self-development and the profiling of their personality, both internally and externally. Sometimes jewellery becomes a fetish, thereby even acquiring its own power to act. At all events, jewellery can be described as an attribute. Jewellery in the sense of an attribute raises the question of identification. Marjan Unger reflects the theories of Allison Lurie when she writes: ‘I don’t wish to place too much emphasis on the point that ‘jewellery’ behaves like ‘language’, but rather that it contains a language. The vocabulary would be the types of jewellery, supplemented by the symbolism of the forms, colours, motifs and any other references. The grammar would be how and when jewellery is worn and also who owns what pieces and who does not. In short: how people interact with jewellery.’\n\nProgramme:\n\nPrologue\n\nWilhelm Lindemann, Chairman, Idar-Oberstein, DE\n\nOn the product-aesthetic education of human beings\n\nProf. Dr. Wolfgang Ullrich, professor of art history and media theory at the University of Arts and Design, Karlsruhe, DE\n\nWest African fetish cult and European fetishism’)\n\nProf. Dr. Karl-Heinz Kohl, professor at the Institute for Historical Ethnology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, DE\n\nAssignments – post from heaven\n\nTruike Verdegaal, Jewellery Artist, Amsterdam, NL\n\nDiamonds are a girl's best friend – on the psychology of jewellery\n\nProf. Dr. Tilmann Habermas, professor at the Institute for Psychology, area of study psychoanalysis, at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, DE\n\nThe magic object in modernity.
