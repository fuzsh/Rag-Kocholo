        "text": "The end of September is one of those perfect times in the year; the honey-coloured light, the tension between perfection and decay, new clothes and sharpened pencils, and suddenly, Gallery Weekend!\n\nEverything feels tentative after this long period of fear, isolation and lockdown. I enter cautiously: masked, distanced, with proof of a second dose ready on my phone.\n\nWill this city ever feel carefree again?\n\nMaybe next year.\n\nBill Burns at MKG127\n\nAt MKG127 Bill Burns is into the third year of his slow performance, described below:\n\nBill began his slow performance called variously The Great Trade or The Great Donkey Walk in Amden Switzerland in 2018. With the help of two Donkeys, Bill carried salt from the local salt mine up some gentle slopes in the Swiss Alps and so this project began. Goat milking, donkey walking, sheep shearing, honey rendering, cheese making and occasionally country singing are Bill’s modes. This exhibition includes several dozen drawings that Bill refers to as “pre-documents”, pictures that depict events that have yet to occur, as well as “documents”, pictures of events that have already occurred.\n\nMKG127 handout\n\nThe numerous drawings — which are small, pale, delicate watercolours, featuring text, which is sometimes descriptive and sometimes not — were apparently ripped from Bill Burns’ notebooks and then meticulously framed and hung in tight grids.\n\nIt’s such a liberating concept of what art could be: slow, thoughtful, lots of unexpected twists, delightful objects that spin off the activities and make sense in terms of the internal logic of the piece, big questions to mull over.\n\nI have yet to witness a Bill Burns performance but I am excited to report that I will attend one October 8th, at the Oculus on the Humber River Trail.\n\nIn the meantime, I appreciate the meandering, round about, surprising way this artwork touches on so many aspects of our present day world: Where does all the stuff that we have come from? How do things get done, made, traded, shipped, bought and sold? What is our connection to farms, to animals? What kind of hierarchies govern our lives? Our we wasting our time rushing around, getting, and spending? What does time even mean now?\n\nI really like the way Bill Burns uniquely speculates, slows down and simplifies contemporary life, teases it apart and offers it to us — with a light and playful touch — for consideration.\n\nAnd what about Donkeys? They are so appealing. I learned the following on The Donkey Sanctuary of Canada website:\n\nDonkeys have been a cornerstone in human existence and they still prop up entire communities today, ferrying water, food and crops.\n\n*****\n\nMarcel Van Eeden at Clint Roenisch\n\nMarcel Van Eeden is a major Dutch artist. I learned this from the many publications available at the Client Roenisch gallery, on the occasion of this exhibition, titled “Stolen Pictures.”\n\nAccording to Client Roenisch, there is a key to this artist’s obsessive rendering of imagery which existed prior to his own birth. Marcel Van Eeden came into this world on November 22, 1963. Yes, that was the day JFK was murdered in Dallas! Even as a child Marcel Van Eeden saw the coincidence of the assassination of JFK and the beginning of his own life as an almost mystical nexus.\n\nMarcel Van Eeden’s creative production has been to draw everything – “the light, the architecture, the travel, the people, the cities, the familiar, the foreign, the intrigue, the art, the violence, literally everything” — from the period including the start of photography and concluding at the moment of his own birth.\n\nThe drawings in the main gallery at Clint Roenisch — which all reference a distant art theft, including text and locale — are huge, powerful, intensely black (rendered in charcoal), and extremely elegant. They have a certain reckless vitality that also manages to be very precise.\n\nThere are also some small paintings, some in colour, also referencing the past, which is moving further and further away from Marcel Van Eeden.\n\nI found this video on You Tube. It goes deep into the practice of this fascinating artist, his relentless drawing and his obsessions. There is very little talking in the video, although at one point the artist does explain his underlying motivations and what he’s getting at and why and just what its all about and so on… but then, of course, I don’t speak Dutch.\n\n*****\n\nRae Johnson at Christopher Cutts Gallery\n\nAt the Christopher Cutts Gallery Rae Johnson’s paintings are on display. Sweeping vistas and low horizons, serene and majestic, filled with awe and reverence, these paintings express a deep and joyful love of nature and an acknowledge of the stark indifference we are all faced with — in our brief, frantic lives — as we look out, in a moment of calm, on this astonishing world.\n\nThe show is called “Of Light and Dark” Water, Land and Sky Paintings: 1989-2009.\n\nIn many of her paintings, not shown here, Rae Johnson has depicted archetypes of depravity and redemption, populated by lonely, dreamlike sylphs in dimly lit nighttime haunts, or caught in painful scenes under a harsh fluorescent glare. This exhibition is another side of Rae Johnson’s work. Here, she is enthralled by the elements: air, light and colour\n\nI wanted to bring the sublime into people’s existence.\n\nRae Johnson\n\nIt’s so uplifting to wander around the Chris Cutts Gallery, look at Rae’s paintings and realize that yes, she definitely succeeded in her goal.\n\n*****\n\nMarch marches on: cold, windy, glare, barren.\n\nClint Roenisch Gallery – Eli Langer and Jennifer Murphy\n\nCaravansary Of Joy is the title of a joint exhibition by Eli Langer and Jennifer Murphy at the capacious Clint Roenisch Gallery on St. Helen’s Avenue. The two artists are a couple. Other than that fact, the exhibition is composed of two separate and distinct shows.\n\nThe paintings by Eli Langer, occupying the front of the gallery, are a pleasure to look at mainly because they are so uncomplicated. This artist is pushing paint around in a serious way but anything external to that activity is irrelevant. There is no agenda, narrative, political pitch, intellectual or iconoclastic posture. I like this feeling of having nothing between the paintings and me; nothing I have to sort out or disagree or agree with. Its relaxing and calming to look at these paintings and there is a crystalline lightness to them that makes it hard to look away.\n\nWinter Flowers by Eli Langer\n\nThe Three Sisters by Eli Langer\n\nEli Langer did provide a sheet of notes available for viewers of the paintings. They reinforce the calm, open, meditative qualities the art works possess. A few lines from the notes are excerpted below:\n\nPainting is experimental. I want to get lost. Turn off the logocentric mind. Trip up purposeful reflex that seeks familiarity in recognizances.\n\nI work without plans. I want the painting to surprise me with its directness.\n\nPainting is truly free of its history in 2015.\n\nHer Cabinet by Eli Langer\n\nEli Langer is talking about getting into the zone where creativity is effortless and assured. It’s exciting and mysterious to see how that Zen-like stillness comes through in the work. Also in the notes Eli Langer writes about the idyllic, creative period he recently experienced, in a supportive relationship with his partner, Jennifer Murphy.\n\nJennifer Murphy’s work occupies the back of the gallery space.\n\nInstallation of art work by Jennifer Murphy\n\nA polished granite platform holds sculptural works in the center of the room and around the walls the artist’s collage pieces are pinned, at varying heights.\n\nWho among us has not, at one time or another, cut pictures out of a magazine and glued them down to make something new? Jennifer Murphy has the uncanny ability to create art works using this technique. Suspended on long pins, like insect specimens, a parade of beast portraits, interspersed with somewhat more conventional portraits of women, are displayed.\n\nArt works by Jennifer Murphy\n\nAs varied as the animal kingdom itself the pieces share a fragile spindly-ness and jewel-like allure. I recall certain aunts of mine wearing brooches like this: a leopard with an “emerald” eye for instance. The frankencat, shown below, has such a coquettish pose, but maybe that’s just something about cats.\n\nArt work by Jennifer Murphy\n\nThe sculptural pieces in the exhibition have the look of a surrealist’s garden: weird, ungainly, texturally patchworked and punctuated with fizzing colour.\n\nSculpture by Jennifer Murphy\n\nOne of the tiniest pieces has a wonderful “Twilight Zone” sensibility. It’s as if the doe-eyed ingenue is trapped in another dimension.\n\nDetail of sculpture by Jennifer Murphy\n\nDetails of sculpture by Jennifer Murphy\n\nIn fact all the objects by Jennifer Murphy – composed of humble materials, found objects, scraps of fabric and various castoff print media – evoke an alternate universe. It’s similar to this universe, but adjusted a bit, for private aesthetic purposes.\n\nDaniel Faria Gallery – Valerie Blass\n\nJust next door, at the Daniel Faria Gallery: A glittering arm holds aloft a crack pipe, miniature figures melt together in lurid sexual embrace, whacked together scrap wood has an anthropomorphic expressiveness, a life-size sculpture of cliched female desirability studies “herself” in a distorting mirror. These are some of the pieces constituting an exhibition by Valerie Blass. Exploring notions of identity, objectification and self-delusion, Valerie Blass adds an ambiguous overlay of autobiography by titling the exhibition My Life.\n\nArt work by Valerie Blass\n\nArt work by Valerie Blass\n\nDetail of Sois gentille by Valerie Blass\n\nThe technical virtuosity and versatility of the artist is impressive. She boldly takes on all media to trawl the psycho sexual depths.\n\nDr. Marbuse Psychoanalyst by Valerie Blass\n\nDr. Marbuse was a fictional hypnotist and criminal who featured in Fritz Lang movies. Is the artist suggesting that hypnotic self absorption is implicated in the fracturing of identify?\n\nDetails of Dr. Marbuse Psychoanalyst by Valerie Blass\n\nA grinning homunculus, looking like something out of a medieval relief, inhabits the “face” of the mirror gazer above.\n\nArtwork by Valerie Blass\n\nIn another piece, the same curtain of silky blond hair is present. This time the hair is out of context, set in a provocative display with a hand, a foot and pale pink panties. Parts only, no woman required. It’s the definition of fetish.\n\nSomething about the piece made me think of Andrea Dworkin and the feminist sexual wars of the eighties. At that time feminists defined themselves as either sex-positive or sex-negative. This was mainly because of the theories of Andrea Dworkin which condemned all objectification of women and all pornographic imagery. She was truly a crusader and was famous for saying things like “Intercourse remains a means or the means of physiologically making a woman inferior [and is] the pure, sterile, formal expression of men’s contempt for women.” That kind of talk turned a lot of her feminist, lefty allies against her. Today, pornography has won. It’s everywhere. Andrea Dworkin was the hardest of the hard-line feminists and the strange upshot of her ideas is that the Christian Right championed then and they still do today.\n\nIn a modest residential neighbourhood, only a few steps from the Bloor Value Village, lie more western outposts of sophisticated art. Clint Roenisch Gallery and Daniel Faria Gallery both have spacious storefronts on Saint Helens Avenue. Client Roenisch arrived in July and Daniel Faria has been there for three years. Tucked around the corner in an alley off Dublin Street, is the mysterious Scrap Metal Gallery, unfortunately closed on the day I visited.\n\nIt was grey and cold and sleet was present.\n\nHarold Klunder at Clint Roenisch Gallery\n\nIn the foyer of the RBC Center on Simcoe and Wellington, near the Starbucks, is a large Harold Klunder, which I passed daily, for about three years, on my way to the elevator banks. The artwork has an eighties neo-expressionist or so-called “bad painting” look. As I recall, the paint is thick, chunky impasto of yellow, orange, browns and blacks with a certain gnarled chockablock geometry that I identify with the artist. I had assumed I would see variations of this work at the new gallery on Saint Helens Avenue.\n\nIn this show, however, titled Live by the Sun, Love by the Moon, Harold Klunder’s work has moved away from the static heaviness of the RBC painting into a realm of light, air and expansiveness that was very exciting to see.\n\nGreen Abstraction\n\nThere is some explanatory text on the gallery wall which mentions Harold Klunder’s Dutch heritage and his connection to the Dutch artists of the past. I liked looking for these links. The bewitching light of Vermeer is successfully evident, particularly in a painting called Airmail Blue #1. (As someone with a European parent this painting had an emotional component too, recalling childhood in which the exquisitely thin blue airmails from abroad connoted a distant and romantic world.)\n\nAirmail Blue #1\n\nThere is a massive triptych on display titled Flemish Proverb which made me think of Dutch tapestries (such as the Hunt of the Unicorn which hangs in the New York Cloisters) because of the scale, complexity, and ambition of the work and the way it reads as an illustration of some arcane narrative. Each panel is painted with a unique palette and iconography yet they are unified by a sense of cascading from light to dark vertically, as horizontally a tale unfolds.\n\nFlemish Proverb and detail of the same painting\n\nA large painting called This Length of Muddy Road seems to shift its identity from map to narrative to landscape and it somehow manages to be filled with light and air despite the grey background.\n\nThis Length of Muddy Road\n\nIn some of the paintings the use of color is truly startling. I was fortunate to attend the Willem De Kooning retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art a few years ago and I can see why the exhibition notes cite that artist as one of Harold Klunder’s (Dutch) influences, particularly because of his use of color.\n\nMilk of the Sun\n\nThe show is put together in an interesting and unusual way in that a selection of the artist’s source material is exhibited with the paintings.\n\nThe collage of paint dabbed news clippings and magazine scraps is really fun to look at. A grouping of vivid water colors hint at the artist’s process regarding color.\n\nAlso included in the exhibition is a welded metal sculpture (borrowed from the collection of Harold Klunder) created by a now deceased French-Canadian nun called Soeur Marie-Anastasie.\n\nAt first I thought it was influenced by Picasso.\n\nBut no…it looks more like a Harold Klunder.\n\nDaniel Faria Gallery – Kristine Moran, Wayne Ngan\n\nAt first sight Kristine Moran’s paintings made me think of Melanie Authier’s work (written about on this blog in the October 12 post) because of the way a mass of abstract iconography is piled up in the middle of the canvas while the corners remain relatively empty, and because of a similar palette both women use.\n\nBut soon the distinctive and exuberant aesthetic of Kristine Moran, who has shown her work with Daniel Faria for six years, comes into focus. Whereas she too explores the manufacture of deep space on canvas her gestural marks are raw and gritty and sometimes combine with explosive force in this show, called Affairs and Ceremonies.\n\nFuneral Procession\n\nFormerly a figurative painter Kristine Moran has developed a personal language of various mysterious forms which appear repeatedly as she creates an expressive whole from layers of jumbled narrative.\n\nShe can’t quite leave figurative painting behind however: vestiges of arms and legs, martini glasses, armour or shields, odd items like tank tops, candles, flowers, open books; all find their way into her paintings.\n\nFlashe\n\nSeance\n\nI liked the fact that Kristine Moran is not afraid to attach Cosmo type titles to her paintings (Gossip or Affair for instance) and for some reason I thought of lingerie colours – pink, black and champagne – when trying to get a read on her paintings. Is this a woman who is using the trappings of the female life as she seeks to understand and evolve through art?\n\nOn the afternoon I dropped into the gallery there was an opening party scheduled for later that same day.\n\nThe spectacle of all that beer in such close proximity to a collection of new works by Wayne Gnan gave me an uneasy feeling. I sincerely hoped there would be no regrettable incidences as the opening played out.\n\nThese beautiful objects are arrayed precisely on a tabletop and lit with drama.\n\nThe installation works as a whole. The strong, weighty forms, soft, natural colors and perfectly subtle sheen are entirely harmonious. It is also rewarding to spend time looking at the inventive sculptural integrity of each individual piece."
