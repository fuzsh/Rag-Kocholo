It presents us with hopes and dreams, fears and nightmares. In other words: Art ecchoes society. My interest in art is powered by an insatiable curiosity and a constant need to ask questions. Questions about the world; me, us and them. Working as a curator, I always try to ask new questions. Aiming to create – not reproduce – knowledge. And always keeping in mind that art is a playground. Dead serious and extremely important, but still a playground.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI graduated from University of Copenhagen in 2008 with a BA in Art History and a MA in Visual Culture. While still a student, I opened the gallery Beaver Projects. In 2012 I ventured into the museum world. 2012-2014 I worked as head of events, curatorial assistant and educator at Nikolaj Kunsthal (Copenhagen).

Jungerman uses collages, sculptures and installations to show cultural critique(s) of the local and the global, the internal and the external. He places traditional materials and objects in different contexts that challenge the established notions of their representation within Western society. Jungerman derives his inspiration from Afro-religious elements of the heritage of Maroon culture in Suriname and the global black diaspora. At the same time he is also inspired by Western traditions and trends in the arts. Jungerman uses color and pattern references that both nod to the twentieth-century Dutch De Stijl movement and a manifestation of black diaspora traditions.\n\nXander Karskens (NL)\n\nArtistic director Cobra Museum, Amstelveen\n\nXander Karskens (1973) is artistic director at the Cobra Museum of Modern Art in Amstelveen since 2016.
