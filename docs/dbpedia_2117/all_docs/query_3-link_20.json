This marked the first time that non-Western contemporary artists were given a solo exhibition at the Stedelijk. The Djaya brothers’ work was fueled by their involvement in the Indonesian struggle for independence after the proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia in 1945. The Stedelijk Museum’s research over the past year into the presence of the two brothers in the Netherlands sheds new light on their accomplishments. These new insights will be featured this summer at the Stedelijk in a thought-provoking exhibition spanning two rooms, a symposium, and other activities.\n\nNew research by independent curator and researcher Kerstin Winking into the work of the Djaya brothers in the Stedelijk’s collection reveals that there is a wealth of information about the brothers in Dutch archives. Agus and Otto Djaya were in Europe from 1947-1950, mostly in the Netherlands, where they secretly worked to promote Indonesian independence. The Stedelijk will showcase a selection of paintings from this period. In addition to works from the collections of the Stedelijk, the National Museum of World Cultures, and Leiden University Library, the exhibition will include revealing archival material demonstrating the entanglement of art and politics, as well as the brothers’ surveillance by the Dutch secret service and support from Dutch intellectuals for their efforts in the struggle for independence.\n\nwww.ftn-books.com has now the Willem Sandberg designed catalog from 1947 available.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nAnselm Kiefer at Museum Voorlinden\n\nIs Kiefer one of the great artists of our time…..certainly YES!\n\nIs the Kiefer exhibition at Museum Voorlinden worth visiting? My personal answer is no. Far too crowded,. too many objects in one and the same room and expensive at euro 22 ,00 per person. Because of the many people present you can not take a distance from the large objects, showcases and paintings. It felt so crowded that it was unpleasant and after half an hour we decided to leave the museum. One of my personal observations was the analogy i felt with the 90’s and 00’s paintaings by Frank van Hemert.\n\nLeft and right are van Hemert paintings from the late 90’s and 00’s in the middle there is a work by Kiefer ca. 1996/97\n\nI really love these sunflower paintings . whoever the artist, both convince me being great art. The large Kiefer paintings are very worth visiting at Voorlinden however , the bicycle objects and large showcases can not convince me and because they are over half the exhibition i thought it a disappointing visit.\n\nAll paintings , objects and cases deserve space and because this is limited at Voorlinden and the spaces were shared with far too many people the overall experience was disappointing.\n\nThe exhibition can be visited until the 25th of February and for those seeking catalogs on this artist please visit www.ftn-books.com\n\nHere are some photographs i took at the exhibition:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nMartin Rous (1939)\n\nAnother decade or so…..and i predict that Martin Rous Jr. will be one of the most wanted artists in the Netherlands. Rous has stayed true to his abstract devisions of space and surface. Using canvas , paper and prints to make his message clear to the viewer. In the beginning i did not like the works by Martin Rous, but over time i learned to look at these fascinating works and objects. Learning to see the subtile differences in using lines and dividing space and now i am actively searching to buy some of his works. Wether it is a drawing or a large painting….. It does not matter whatever comes first has my interest. A good thing to know is that i already have a small library with his books and the duplicate copies are available at http://www.ftn-books.com.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nMirjam Hagoort (1961)\n\nI have in my FTN-books collection an CBK Rotterdam catalogue on Mirjam Hagoort, published in the early Nineties it shows the works by Hagoort as a young artist . Big almost geometrical paintings with words and sayings, a bit like Ed Ruscha, but while preparing this blog on Hagoort i noticed a change in her work. Nowadays her drawings are much like Marcel van Eeden his daily drawings. They have the same look and feel.\n\nThe paintings however are different. Here she shines with a kind of abstraction that make her early paintings from the Nineties such appealing works of art. With the recent paintings she combines abstraction and architecture into great works of art.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nJiří Georg Dokoupil (1954)…continued\n\nThe follow up of a blog which i published on the 18th of December 2018 is a short blog on my recent additions of 4 Doukoupil publications that i recently found and bought on my local bookmarket. The ArT RANDOM is not the rarest o them, but still a nice one to collect, since it contains the THE MADRID PAINTINGS. Blurred images that are certainly recognizable in black and white, making these extra powerful paintings. The other publiucations are my personal favorites . 3 volumes of the Dokoupil drawings series. The volumes I, II and III are now combined for sale at www.ftn-books.com\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson…his drawings\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson, known for his photographs and member of the Magnum agency will always be remembered for his fantastic photographs he has made during his life,\n\nbut what i did not know and discovered recently is that he also was a very talented artist. Last week i purchased a book on his drawings. An artistic quality of this artist i was not aware of, but leafing through the book i found that his drawings have an almost impressionist quality.\n\nThese drawings were made in the last 3 decades of his life but show that he has the same approach to a drawing as with his photographs. Perhaps his photographs were the origin of the drawing….i do not know, but abstraction and mouvement within the same drawing show that his mind worked the same with making a drawing and taking a photograph. The book; Henri Cartier-Bresson / Zeichnungen is now available at www.ftn-books.com\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson (French: [kaʁtje bʁɛsɔ̃]; August 22, 1908 – August 3, 2004) was a French humanist photographer considered a master of candid photography, and an early user of 35 mm film. He pioneered the genre of street photography, and viewed photography as capturing a decisive moment. His work has influenced many photographers.\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson was born in Chanteloup-en-Brie, Seine-et-Marne, France, the oldest of five children. His father was a wealthy textile manufacturer, whose Cartier-Bresson thread was a staple of French sewing kits. His mother’s family were cotton merchants and landowners from Normandy, where Henri spent part of his childhood. The Cartier-Bresson family lived in a bourgeois neighborhood in Paris, Rue de Lisbonne, near Place de l’Europe and Parc Monceau. His parents supported him financially so Henri could pursue photography more freely than his contemporaries. Henri also sketched.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nPiet Dirkx weekly\n\nAnother beautiful Christmas/New Years card for 2008.

It is a pleasure to know and announce that once again there is a large exhibition being held at a major dutch museum. This time the Kunstmuseum Den Haag ( Gemeentemuseum Den Haag ) has an exhibition which opens on the 29th of February and will close on the 13th of April.\n\n( the invitation depicts ” fetish + tabou” from 2000 )\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nSiegfried Anzinger (1953)\n\nAt the time Anzinger had an exhibition at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag ( curated by Franz Kaiser i was not very interested in this kind of art, but sone 25 year ahead in time thingds change and now i find his work at least….INTERESTING and INTRIGUING.\n\nPerhaps that is because i have learned to appreciate this kind of art. His paintings remind me of some of the ones Bacon has made and in the Netherlands John van ‘t Slot approached his subjects in the way Anzinger does. (Van ‘t Slot and Anzinger are from the same generation) and still they are rooted in the Austrian way of painting.\n\nIf you try to find some information on Anzinger you will have a hard time finding it. There is some put on line by his gallery MAX WEBER, but even this information is not very elaborate. An interesting artist, but hard to keep track of his works, because outside Germany and Austria his work is rarely seen.\n\nhttp://www.ftn-books has one important publication on Anzinger available\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted on by ftnbooks\n\nRobine Clignett (1947)\n\nIt was by chance that i stumbled upon the works by Robine Clignett. Instantly recognizable art….. a combination of constructivist art which is further abstracted and put in a lansdscape which is abstracted also….i instantly liked it very much and it was added to my collection because i bought some graphic works by dutch artist from a small collection and the drawing that is below was within that collection.\n\nI had to save it by carefully removing it from its backing board and what was left was an excellent Drwaing/watercolor by Robine Clignett. I contacted her that i had by chance bought this handcolored drawing and she was delighted to know where it now was. She excplained the difference in dating and confirmed the authenticity of the work. And now…. it is for sale, not because it is not appreciated but the colors do not match with anything in our interior. I hung it for several month upstairs but even there it does not match and shows its true qualities. So the drawing/ watercolor is now looking for a new home and is available at http://www.ftn-blog.com/ the FTN ART SECTION\n\nThe drawing is depicted on the Robine Clignett site. Robine Clignett has regular exhibitions at Maurits van der Laar gallery\n\nWithout title\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
