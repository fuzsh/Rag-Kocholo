        "text": "Artists\n\nMarcel van Eeden\n\nMarcel van Eeden’s drawings and paintings traverse imagery from before 1965, the year he was born, as a methodology to discuss the infiniteness of existence and his personal insignificance in the stream of time. Vintage photographs, illustrations, newspaper clippings, and advertising posters as appropriated as source material for his works on handmade paper, drawn in charcoal and coloured pencil or painted in gouache and watercolour. Revealing a dark film-noir sensibility steeped in nostalgia for the past, light and shadow are emphasised through high contrast reminiscent of black-and-white photography or film stills. Cityscapes, interiors, and mashups with flgures, logos and objects appear alongside fragments of fictional text written by Eeden, as narrative dramas for characters based on real individuals in history, much like a series of storyboard templates.\n\nArtist bio\n\nDutch artist Marcel van Eeden (1965, The Hague ) lives and works in Zurich, Karlsruhe, and The Hague. He graduated from Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten, The Hague (1993). He is Professor at Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe (2014–present). His work is in collections including Berlinische Galerie Museum of Modern Art, Berlin; Centraal Museum Utrecht, Utrecht; Centre Pompidou, Musée National d’Art Moderne, Paris; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk; Magasin III – Museum for Contemporary Art, Stockholm; Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Amsterdam; among others."
