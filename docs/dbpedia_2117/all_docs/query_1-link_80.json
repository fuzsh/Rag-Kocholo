        "text": "until 09.01. | #3125ARTatBerlin | Haus am Waldsee presents from 17th September 2021 the multi-disciplinary exhibition “Drawing as Continuum” by the artist Tony Cragg, curated by himself and Katja Blomberg. The show focuses on works since the 1970s. Eleven series in eleven rooms will be on display, with early photographs, hand drawings and watercolours as well as lithographs that allow a deeper insight into Tony Cragg’s artistic and scientific thinking. The increased turn to drawing on paper took place in the 1990s. Now Cragg uses the drawing pencil both for technical communication as a sketch or as a way of contemplating the form and content of complex artistic questions, most of which are motivated by the natural sciences. In the 2000s, he also created autonomous drawings, as well as coloured watercolours and lithographs. Tony Cragg, Untitled, 2014, Bleistift auf Papier, 56 x 43,7 cm, Courtesy der Künstler, Foto: Michael Richter, © VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2021 In his drawings, too, Cragg dives deep into the fields that emerge from the examination of material and form, micro- and macrostructures. He often works through themes on paper in series, as if they were series of experiments in the laboratory. In the 1990s, for […]\n\nuntil 08.06. | #3011ARTatBerlin | Haus am Waldsee shows from 7th April 2021 a digital solo exhibition by the artist duo Fischer & el Sani. In continuation of our successful Lockdown video art programme in cooperation with Videoart at Midnight from the beginning of February to the end of March 2021, we are pleased to announce Haus am Waldsee’s first online digital solo exhibition for April to June 2021.

Three sculptors reflect the interfaces between art and science over a century and from Berlin. Following the exhibition “Lynn Chadwick, Hans Uhlmann, Katja Strunz”, which explored the subject of “Fold” at Haus am Waldsee in 2019, Björn Dahlem (*1974), Berta Fischer (*1973) and Naum Gabo (1890-1977) are now taking up an artistic conversation about space and time between 1920 and 2020 with installations and sculptures. For Naum Gabo, art in the 1920s meant a means of gaining knowledge about the physics of our planet. The Jewish-Russian artist, who had emigrated to Berlin and who, together with his brother Antoine Pevsner, had shortly before written the “Realistic Manifesto”, which was groundbreaking for sculpture, was constantly searching for new materials and means of expression, “not for the sake of the new, but to find expression for the new view of the world around me and for new insights into the forces of life […]\n\nuntil 04.10. | #2782ARTatBerlin | Haus am Waldsee shows from 18th July 2020 the exhibition Revolutions of Choice of the architect duo Frank Barkow and Regine Leibinger. In a loose sequence, the Haus am Waldsee as a place of contemporary visual art also presents international architects who maintain their offices in Berlin. With GRAFT (2012), Haus-Rucker-Co (2015) and J.MAYER.H (2016), leading architectural artists were presented who also have their roots in the USA through study and teaching. In the summer of 2020, Haus am Waldsee will be dedicated to the American-German architect duo Frank Barkow (*1957) and Regine Leibinger (*1963), whose work has been able to develop globally from Berlin since the 1990s. After studying at Harvard University, Barkow Leibinger founded an office in Berlin in 1993. Frank Barkow has taught as a visiting professor at leading American universities as well as in London and Lausanne. Regine Leibinger also taught internationally, in addition to her joint construction activities, and held a professorship at the Technical University of Berlin from 2006 to 2018. Today both partners share a professorship at Princeton University. Barkow Leibinger is one of the pioneers of a generation of architects who are constantly trying to expand the […]\n\nuntil 23.02. | #2633ARTatBerlin | Haus am Waldsee presents from 29th November 2019 the exhibition The Truth Resides In The Folds (> In den Falten das Eigentliche) by the artist Johanna Diehl. „The one who has once begun to unfold the fan of memory will continue to find new links […] no image will suffice for he can see that it can be unfolded, and only in the folds does the truth reside […].“ (from: Walter Benjamin, Das Passagen-Werk, transl.) In the winter of 2019/20, Haus am Waldsee is showing its first institutional solo exhibition by internationally acclaimed photo artist Johanna Diehl (*1977) in Berlin. Freely inspired by Walter Benjamin, she develops her work out of the idea that the essence of history lies in the folds of memory. Diehl traces the hidden and oftentimes also forgotten in Europe‘s recent memory and finds images which state something, rather than simply enlighten or impress. In her recent series, Diehl refers to private biographies of the West German postwar period. The grandniece of documenta founder Arnold Bode has evaluated slide magazines, diaries and archives of her grandparent’s generation for this purpose. Among these were well-known publishers and architects from Kassel. The artist precisely […]\n\nuntil 05.05. | #2400ARTatBerlin | Haus am Waldsee shows since 9th March 2019 the exhibition ONE TO FREE by the artist Ammar Al-Beik. Born in Damascus in 1972, Ammar al-Beik, filmmaker and photographer who has received many awards, stands like hardly any other Syrian artist of his generation for the experimental film of his country. Since the early 2000s his works have been shown at international film festivals in Venice and Berlin, among others, but they have also been shown in museums in New York, Paris, Seoul and Tokyo. Al-Beik came to Berlin in 2014 via Beirut and Dubai, where he now lives and works. ONE TO FREE provides a first overview of his work in a German art institution. In terms of content, the works on display range from the search for a new Syrian identity, to the uprisings of the opposition in Damascus, to the immediate present in which the filmmaker reflects on his life in exile in Berlin. Ammar al-Beik portrays his surroundings poetically and highly politically, personally and with a wide awake gaze.

Today, reality and artificiality are becoming more and more indistinguishable. Sven Drühl’s artistic strategy resembles that of a visual DJ: he reinterprets, mixes, de-emotionalises, controls and works with contemporary materials like car finish and silicon. The painter, mathematician, art historian and dancer Sven Drühl (b. 1967) appropriates images from the collective cultural memory and transfers them into the digital age. With unconventional means, he is able to show how profoundly “information technologies permeate phenomena in the physical world.” (Villem Flusser) Supported by the Berlin borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, the Governing Mayor of Berlin – Senatorial Office – Cultural Affairs, and the Association of Friends and Supporters of Haus am Waldsee Program during the exhibition Vernissage for children: Su. 11.09.2016, 11-­13 Uhr Guided tour in dialogue: We 14.09.2016, 18.30 Uhr with Yella Hoepfner Artist talk: We. 21.09.2016, 19.30 Uhr with Sven Drühl Family Saturday: Sa. 01.10.2016, 14-­17 Uhr with Emanuel Valariano Artist Dinner: We. 05.10.2016, 19.30 Uhr with Sven Drühl, Catering Michael Hoffmann, talking part costs 65 €, please make an appointment until 03.10. to m.roloff@hausamwaldsee.de Familiy Saturday […]\n\nuntil 28.08. | #0608ARTatBerlin | Haus am Waldsee shows from 8th of July 2016 the exhibition CHINESE WHISPERS by the photo artist Ingo Mittelstaedt with the collection Peter Raue. The Berlin photo artist Ingo Mittelstaedt (b. 1978) works with the extensive collection of the Berlin lawyer and art expert Peter Raue which will be shown to the public for the first time at Haus am Waldsee. Starting with David Hockney’s series ‘Blue Guitar’ (1975) Mittelstaedt addresses the topics of seeing, collecting and reutilising or recycling objects and ideas. In doing so Mittelstaedt treats the collection of artworks as his raw material which he correlates with a selection of his own works from 2007 to 2016. Like in the children’s game ‘Chinese whispers’ topics and themes are reinterpreted and handed down from one generation to the next and from one artist to another. Mittelstaedt visualizes this network of references with his own works and, among others, with works by Marcel Broodthaers, Hanne Darboven, David Hockney, Rebecca Horn, Eva Kot’átková and Robert Longo.
