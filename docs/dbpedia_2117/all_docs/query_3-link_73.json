        "text": "First Impressions\n\nWeston Gallery\n\n8 June – 12 August 2018\n\nDiscover the fascinating story of printing in St Albans in this flagship opening exhibition.\n\nTaking pride of place within the newly-created Weston Gallery, this exhibition will explore the rich history of a vital industry, charting the development of printing techniques, technologies, and typographic design through the centuries.\n\nThis free exhibition will reveal the local, national, and sometimes international, impact of the City’s 500-year-old printmaking heritage.\n\nVisit to learn how St Albans became home to the third printing press in the country in 1479, aiding the spread of enlightenment and knowledge by supplying the University of Cambridge with its texts. Witness the birth of an industry and see up close one of the first texts to have been printed in colour.\n\nFrom printing now-iconic London Transport posters to producing fake Daily Telegraph newspapers as part of the war effort, the printing history of St Albans is rich and surprising at every turn.\n\nMasquerade by Susie MacMurray\n\nAssembly Room, Old Waiting Room\n\n8 June - 5 August 2018\n\nIn the dramatic splendour of the Assembly Room, internationally renowned artist, Susie MacMurray, showcases a range of her artworks as well as a specially-commissioned site-specific installation.\n\nWith a reputation for poetic interventions in historic spaces, MacMurray’s large scale piece, Masquerade, takes inspiration from the history of St Albans' Georgian Town Hall and raises questions about the relationship between place and people.\n\nOriginally used for balls, galas and concerts, the Assembly Room has been fully restored to its former glory, meaning visitors can now admire the stunning Georgian architecture, ornate chandeliers and lustrous gold leaf.\n\nWith its double height ceiling and large windows which flood the space with light, this breath-taking room is perfect for hosting immersive, large-scale artworks such as MacMurray's.\n\nIn partnership with UH Arts, the University of Hertfordshire’s arts and cultural programme.\n\nAccumulate (Artists in Residence)\n\nKeeper’s Galleries\n\n8 June – 8 July 2018\n\nResponding to the intriguing history and collections of the museum, Lyndall Phelps, Abi Spendlove and Katie Gillam-Hull present Accumulate, an exhibition of artworks and interventions created over three years that shine a light on the hidden elements of the museum collection.\n\nKaty Gillam-Hull: Katy’s delicate objects reference the remarkable Salaman tool collection. Exploring the aesthetic and functional qualities of the tools, she creates small-scale copper and wire pieces that invite us to reconsider these artefacts.\n\nLyndall Phelps: Lyndall invites conversations between selected collection objects and her own exquisite handmade artworks. She examines St Albans’ industrial past, from Ballito’s ladies’ stockings, Ryder & Sons packet seeds to H. Rose & Sons’ handmade brushes. Research led her to consider the origins of the museums’ collections; the first collectors, acquisitions and absent objects.\n\nAbi Spendlove: Abi has been inspired by fragments of stained glass found in the museums’ collections and has created a range of reflective, highly-coloured pieces. She re-sizes selected shards to large proportions, using scale and transparent materials to celebrate their historic significance, detail and craftsmanship.\n\nThis exhibition is the final celebration of their work bringing together art and history. In partnership with UH Arts, the University of Hertfordshire’s arts and cultural programme.\n\nFlutter (Artist in Residence)\n\nAcross the building\n\n8 June - 5th August 2018\n\nA flutter of butterflies has settled inside St Albans Museum + Gallery, gently landing on unexpected surfaces across the building’s three floors.\n\nInspired by the Alexander Hopkins British Butterfly collection which were once part of St Albans Museums’ collection, artist Lyndall Phelps presents a playful artistic intervention which reintroduces the butterflies back into their previous habitat.\n\nRe-imagined in decorative and reflective kaleidoscopic form, visitors are invited to find Purple Emperor, Swallow Tail and Clouded Yellow butterflies which are scattered across the building.\n\nIn partnership with UH Arts, the University of Hertfordshire’s arts and cultural programme.\n\nSquatlife\n\nKeeper’s Galleries\n\n14 July – 26 August 2018\n\nInspired originally by Dave Kotula’s photographs of squatted premises in St Albans in the 1980’s, Squatlife highlights historical and contemporary responses to homelessness, giving insight into this previously under-researched aspect of local history.\n\nIn conjunction with this exhibition, Cardboard Citizens will work with homeless or recently homeless residents from the district to create a piece to be performed at the Abbey Theatre, whilst a professional photographer will work with attenders of Herts Young Homeless to capture snapshots of their lives.\n\nAnd So She Did – artist residencies\n\nAssembly Room\n\n21 August - 23 August and 28 August - 30 August 2018\n\nJoin paper engineer, John O’Leary, in the magnificent Assembly Room and help create a large-scale collaborative artwork inspired by the pioneering women of St Albans.\n\nDuring the first week of our 'And So She Did' season, explore the fascinating lives of three local women through the ages: from the fierce and revolutionary queen Boudicca, to noblewoman and shrewd business woman, Sarah Churchill, and local Suffragette, Constance Lytton.\n\nFold, construct and use paper engineering techniques to render these incredible women's lives into a collaborative art piece. Artworks created by the community will be displayed in the space, celebrating the feminist heritage of the region.\n\nJoin local textile artist, Flea Cooke, in the magnificent Assembly Room and help create a large scale collaborative artwork inspired by the stories of the pioneering women of St Albans.\n\nDuring the second week of our 'And So She Did' season, explore the fascinating lives of three local women through the ages: from the trail-blazing Margaret Wix, to community activist and campaigner Syeda Momotaz Rahim, and local philanthropist Muriel Green.\n\nHand Drawn Action Packed\n\nWeston Gallery\n\n2 September – 11 November 2018\n\nHand Drawn Action Packed is a new major exhibition curated by Hayward Gallery Touring, showcasing the works of ten artists whose practice springs from drawing, and reveals the medium’s infinite possibilities.\n\nThe artists come from around the world (Belgium, Canada, China, India, Nigeria, the Netherlands, South Africa, Turkey and the USA), but their works all deploy narrative forms for fantasy, social critique, political allegory and autobiography to engage the viewer and hold their attention.\n\nThis never-before-seen exhibition opens at St Albans Museum + Gallery before touring the UK and features artwork from: Marcel Dzama, Marcel van Eeden, Inci Eviner, Yun-Fei Ji, William Kentridge, Nalini Malani, Otobong Nkanga, Raymond Pettibon, Amy Sillman and Rinus Van de Velde.\n\nLasting Peace?\n\nEast Keeper's Gallery + film showing in the Guard Room in the cells\n\n8 September - 18 November 2018\n\nEven before Armistice Day in 1918 St Albans had started creating monuments to the soldiers who wouldn’t come back.\n\nThis exhibition explores how the way we remember the First World War has changed from those early memorials to our centenary commemorations today.\n\nAs part of the St Albans Remembers season.\n\nSt Albans Legacy\n\nAssembly Room\n\n27 October - 15 November 2018\n\nSt Albans Legacy is the culmination of a multimedia art competition showcasing the artworks and creative responses of local pupils to the First World War.\n\nThe display gathers creations which explore what the Armistice means to a new generation and sheds light on the experiences of those 100 years ago.\n\nAccompanying the artwork will also be a world map recording where the ancestors of St Albans' residents were living 100 years ago.\n\nAs part of the St Albans Remembers season.\n\nImprinted - works by Jane Glynn and Suman Gujral\n\nKeeper's Galleries\n\n24 November 2018 – 3rd February 2019\n\nWorking from studios in Hertfordshire, artists Jane Glynn and Suman Gujral present solo exhibitions in neighbouring galleries.\n\nEach with a particular style exploring the experience of time and memory, this exhibition shares personal autobiographical subjects through sensitive paintings, prints and associated ephemera.\n\nJane Glynn's practice explores her personal experience of time and memory through a diverse range of materials such as oil painting, drawing, bookmaking, sculpture, animation and graphic memoirs.\n\nFor this exhibition, Glynn will be presenting twelve oil paintings of garden flowers, with twelve silk pockets of dried flowers and vases, all originating from her family home which she collected and painted over the course of a year. These temporal artefacts map the passage of time just like personal diaries, calendars or memoirs.\n\nSuman Gujral’s use of etching and monoprinting echos how life experiences and family histories leave their trace; the acid of the etching process leaves both intentional and accidental marks on the plates. Her own personal experience of cancer and her mother’s experience of 1947 Partition in India are both examples of significant life events, which have left an enduring trace upon her.\n\nMuseums in Motion - installation\n\nOld Waiting Room\n\n23 October 2018 – November 2018\n\nMuseums in Motion is a heritage, dance and film project that asks:\n\n‘What is inside your mobile phone?’\n\nEach Museums in Motion installation unpacks mobile technology to explore what objects and technology previously fulfilled the job of apps and functions of a mobile today and how that impacts the way people live, behave and move. Remembering life before music and film streaming, blogs, on-line gaming, search engines, email, instant messaging and on-line photo sharing.\n\nThe film installation has been produced in collaboration with The Links Academy whose students have been the dancers, directors, film-makers and creators for the installation that will be in the museum for 6 weeks following the launch.\n\nMuseums in Motion projects are taking place throughout 2018/19 at: British Schools Museum, St Albans Museum + Gallery, North Hertfordshire Museum, Royston Museum, Stevenage Museum and Watford Museum.\n\nMuseums in Motion is run in partnership with six Hertfordshire museums, managed by BEEE Creative CIC, with artistic direction from makeAMPLIFY, with funding raised by The National Lottery and awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.\n\nGame Plan: Board Games Rediscovered\n\nWeston Gallery\n\n1 December 2018 – 3 March 2019\n\nOriginally displayed at the V&A’s Museum of Childhood, this exhibition celebrates the joy, excitement and occasional frustration of playing board games.\n\nCome and see some of the most iconic, enthralling and visually striking games from the V&A’s outstanding national collection of board games.

Following a decade of preoccupation with landscape, Hepworth moved naturally between abstraction and the figure in the years 1948 to 1953, capturing the human form across drawing and sculpture. Finding inspiration in the movements of people in Venice’s St Mark’s Square to dancers into her Trewyn Studio and medical teams performing operations, this poignant exhibition introduces sculptures, drawings and archival material, reuniting works that have not been seen together since they were first created.\n\nBrought to St Albans Museum + Gallery in partnership with UHArts.\n\nToy Story: The Us in Museum (UH Creative Design)\n\nOld Waiting Room Gallery\n\n5 April – 9 May 2019\n\nThere are many different ways to look at a museum object and this exhibition will explore the design ideas and heritage context behind some of the toys and games in St Albans Museums’ collection.

Bacon sets out his method in his book Novum Organum which laid the foundations of what was to become the experimental, or scientific method. Working from Bacon’s new method the exhibition will explore the discoveries of other scientists using this method from the longest running agricultural experiment in the world at Rothamsted to Stephen Hawking’s work on Black Holes. Other local scientists include the entomologist Eleanor Ormerod, Thomas Spencer Wells, surgeon to Queen Victoria who was one of the earliest surgeons to use anaesthetics, and Anna Thynne who created the first successful marine aquarium."
