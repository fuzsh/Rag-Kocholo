        "text": "Born in the northern Nigerian town of Kano and currently based in Antwerp, Otobong Nkanga's drawings, installations, photographs and sculptures variously examine ideas around land and the value connected to natural resources\n\nIn the work of Nigerian artist Otobong Nkanga, activities and performance permeate all kinds of media and motivate photography, drawing, painting, sculpture, installation and video, though all the different works are thematically connected through architecture and landscape. As a human trace that testifies of ways of living and environmental issues, architecture and landscape act as a sounding board for narration and the performative. According to the artist herself, she uses her body and voice in live performances or in videos to become the protagonist in her work. However, her presence serves mostly as a self-effacing catalyst, an invisible hand that sets the artistic process in motion.\n\nIn this sense, the artist's presence is reminiscent of the self-portraits that Velazquez or Goya included in their bigger history paintings, which exposed the making of the artwork and created an image within an image.\n\nBorn in Nigeria and living in Antwerp, Belgium, Nkanga negotiates the completion of the cycle of art between the aesthetic realm of display and a strategy of desublimation that repeatedly pushes the status of the artwork into contingency. In his text about African conceptualism, Okwui Enwezor connected the latter strategy to African traditions.[1] Within a fluid system of exchanges and relationships between object, artist and au- dience, the object is important. When it comes to intention and meaning, however, the object paradoxically functions as an anti-perceptual entity, valuing or mobilising speech and oral communication.\n\nAn important project in relation to Nkangas ongoing examination of landscape and the value connected to natural resources beyond their marketability and immediate use was her \"re-invention\"[2] of \"Baggage\" (2007-08), a 1972 happening originated by the Ameri- can artist Allan Kaprow. In 1972, Kaprow, along with 20 students from Rice University in Houston, transported bags of sand from a campus construction site to a beach in Galveston, where they evacuated the bags contents and returned with sea sand. The action took place without an audience and the presentation of documentation was the only way in which the happening was translated to an art public. \"Baggage\" was one of many happenings conducted by Kaprow dealing with the displacement of goods from one place to another. In some of these happenings Kaprow paid attention to the differences in earth colour across America, and the strong contrast he observed when they met.\n\nWhen Nkanga restaged \"Baggage\" (2007-08), the (art-historical) notion of \"landscape\" would take on an importance only vaguely understood in Kaprow's original version. packaged sand from the Netherlands was sent to Lagos and in return sand from Nigeria's Delta region was sent back to the Netherlands. By taking Dutch sand to the dramatically changing landscape of Nigeria, a country rich in oil, Nkanga strongly emphasises the notion of displacement between both continents. In the process, the artist re-politicised Kaprow's original happening. Although it is self- evident that the context of air travel, for both people and goods, has changed dramatically since 1972, the artist did not want to delve directly or too explicitly into the obvious political issues that are connected to the displacement of commodities today. She rather wanted to render a changing landscape hardly visible in a world today where products are transported from one continent to another and where the origins of products (raw materials) have gone through different transformations. As the artist explained in a conversation in August 2008, this work could be a metaphor of a situation where we see \"displacement\" in a broader context, as not only to the movement of goods, but also human displacement.\n\nIn many of her works Nkanga reflects metonymically on the use and cultural value connected to natural resources. Featured on the Studio museum's 2008 exhibition \"Flow\", her photographic diptych \"Alterscapes\" (2006) shows the artist as a demiurge, spilling an undefined blue liquid on a landscape. \"Contained measures of Tangible memories\" (2009), a more recent installation, features two duplicate mobile plinths on top of which the artist has placed five bowls containing mica, black soap, cassia fistula, indigo dye and alum, natural materials that are available in both morocco and Nigeria, but used in completely different ways. The work, shown on the 2009 Arts in marrakech biennial, explores how meaning and function are relative within cultures, and reveals different roles and histories for the same products, particularly within the context of the artist's autobiography and memories. Connected to the domain of art, perversity lingers in the idea that exploitation is fundamental to culture when culture is defined as the adaptation of natural resources towards human ends. Nkanga refrains from entering the realm of the perverse by only creating a vehicle for showing and transporting the resources, she does not make a new product out of them. (She repeated this strategy in her work \"Contained measures of Fragments pointe Noire\" (2009), which focuses on the specific colours of earth found in pointe Noire, Congo; bags of sand were pierced during the opening of the exhibi- tion and slowly spilled out to shape a new landscape within the installation.)"
