        "text": "An integral part of the artistic scene since 2006, every year the Daniel and Florence Guerlain Foundation’s Contemporary Drawing Prize honours a laureate from among the three artists selected by a committee of seven experts.\n\nThe Prize concerns artists for whom drawing on paper or cardboard is a significant part of their work. The nominated artists can be of French or foreign nationality on condition that they reside in France or have a privileged cultural link through institutional exhibitions. All graphic mediums are accepted except for computer or mechanical processes.\n\nThe laureate is chosen by a jury of collectors which is renewed each year.\n\nThe Prize’s endowment: 25 000 euros, including 15 000 euros for the laureate and 5 000 euros for each of the two other artists.\n\nA work by the laureate is offered to a French institution by the Foundation.\n\nPromote and highlight the place of contemporary drawing in art\n\nContemporary art collectors for more than 30 years, Daniel and Florence Guerlain rapidly developed a passion for drawing and have put together a collection of works from more than two hundred and forty artists of forty or so nationalities. The quality and wealth of this collection were revealed by their donation of 1200 drawings to the Centre Pompidou and dedicated exhibitions in Paris (470 works at the Centre Pompidou, 2013), in Libourne (100 drawings at the Musée des beaux-arts, Chapelle du Carmel, 2014), in Sweden (250 drawings at the Nordiska Akvarellmuseet, 2015-2016) and in Aalborg, Denmark (250 drawings at the Kunsten Museum, 2016).\n\nBut Daniel and Florence Guerlain have not contented themselves with putting together the most important private collection of contemporary drawings in France. As early as 2006, they created the Contemporary Drawing Prizewhich rapidly became a benchmark on the art scene. Why a prize dedicated to drawing? Quite simply because this couple of collectors wished to promote and highlight a medium embodying both great classical tradition and bold modernity. For a long time used as an instrument of apprenticeship or a means of study, little by little drawing acquired its own full-fledged status nowadays acknowledged by everyone. Considered to be the finest means of capturing fleeting intuition and the closest medium to thought, drawing allows for a freedom of expression that always goes straight to the essential. Then again, the diversity of the graphic means - pencil, charcoal, ink, wash tint, gouache, watercolour, pastel, felt tip or sanguine – is such that works on paper or cardboard, collages and wall drawings offer a limitless field of exploration for connoisseurs, ever more passionate and growing in number, of contemporary drawing.\n\nThe exceptional dedicated exhibition by the Centre Pompidou in 2017 of the 30 artists distinguished by the Prize illustrates the recognition of the quality and importance of the work accomplished by these great French art patrons. The first exhibition of the Drawing Prize abroad was presented in Germany at the Wilhelm-Hack-Museum, Ludwigshafen until the 24th of February 2019.\n\nLamia Joreige, through various mediums such as drawing, photography, video, object, and installation, explores our relationship with history and its influence on us. She poses the central question of how to create forms and narratives from real and historical facts. This artistic approach is the result of extensive research and reading, mainly focused on Lebanon and its region.\n\nIn recent years, Lamia Joreige has been particularly interested in the formation of Lebanon during World War I. The troubles in Syria, which could affect the entire neighboring regions, have revived her memory of this historical period when nations were redrawn and fragmented. She delves into the archives of King Faisal, who could have led the first independent Arab monarchy, a project that ultimately failed. She also explores the consequences of the massive famine of 1915, caused by a locust invasion, as well as various speculations and maritime blockades. Her goal is to understand the impact of these upheavals on the mental and physical levels of the affected populations.\n\nAmir Nave, in an exploration of the infinite temporality of the human being, develops an obsessive, spiritual, and almost mystical approach. His artistic work focuses on the incessant question of our identity and our ultimate destination.\n\nBy following the movements of the figures, or \"creatures\" conceived by Amir Nave, the viewer is immersed in a panorama of human passions. Although some of his works may seem inspired by classics in art history and mythology, Amir Nave rejects the idea of simply representing everyday reality in order to better understand ourselves. In his early days, he focused on landscapes and insects, seeking parallels between our species and others. Later, his artistic forms evolved into \"creatures,\" entities that evoke both our deepest past and possible futures. Whether drawn by a body, a head, or an entity, these characters live and act. \"The human being is unfathomable, and within each of us resides this question of eternity. In my work, I strive to capture the actions of these characters and their direction,\" he says.\n\nChristos Venetis, through the use of torn book covers, presents a vision of the world that combines poetic projection, reflection on the role of the image, and the collection of the countless images to which the internet exposes us.\n\nIn a sort of artistic protocol, Christos Venetis mainly creates his graphite pencil drawings on these ghost book covers. A striking contrast emerges between these small formats, characterized by their delicacy, precision, and meticulousness, and the battered bindings of the books, whose titles remain unknown. Although these supports may evoke dark hours of history, particularly the book burnings of the Second World War, the global question of image representation and narration becomes central. The artist expresses his desire to work with a form of absence of choice, seeking to restore \"materiality to the image\".\n\nHis sources range from the Thousand and One Nights to intellectual figures such as the literary historian Sven Spieker or the art critic Benjamin Buchloh, who have analyzed the notion of archives. He explains his approach in these terms: \"I choose my subjects online, initially focusing on the black and white palette. If the sources are in color, I convert and crop them. I also sometimes blur certain elements or zoom in on specific details. In this way, I work precisely on the loss or impossibility of narration, in the manner of Walter Benjamin.\"\n\nThe Drawing Prize in figures\n\n17 editions since its launch\n\nThe Contemporary Drawing Prize was launched in 2006. It became annual as from 2009.\n\n3 artists nominated for each edition\n\n6 experts for the selection committee\n\n9 collectors in the jury\n\nThe winner is chosen by a jury comprising nine members, including the two founders and seven private collectors, either French or foreign.\n\nThe jury is renewed for each prize. (Vote by secret ballot).\n\n1 laureate\n\nThe Drawing Prize is awarded to an artistic work. The laureate receives an endowment of 15.000 euros and the two other selected artists receive an endowment of 5.000 euros each. A work by the laureate is offered to a French institution by the Foundation.\n\nThe Drawing Prize’s Sponsors\n\nThe Cercle des Amis of the Daniel & Florence Guerlain Contemporary Art Foundation\n\nThe Foundation’s support group, the ‘Cercle’ is strongly committed to the prize that it assists at every stage.\n\nLa Maison Guerlain, www.guerlain.fr\n\nNeuflize OBC, www.neuflizeobc.fr\n\nArtcurial, www.artcurial.com\n\nArtprice by ArtMarket.com\n\nVoisin Consulting Life Sciences, www.voisinconsulting.com\n\nGroupe Élysées Monceau, www.elysees-monceau.fr\n\nGroupe Pasteur Mutualité, www.gpm.fr\n\nPatrimOne assurances\n\nArte Generali\n\nPartners\n\nLe Salon du Dessin - La Maison Ruinart"
