        "text": "From June 8, 2024, Museum de Fundatie presents the exhibition Northern light: nature photography. This exhibition focuses on the photographic view of nature and the relationship of humans to nature. Northern light: nature photography highlights topics such as the cycles in nature, human interventions in nature, including disturbing the ecological balance, and how the human condition is reflected in relation to nature. Over 100 artworks are on display, including around 50 works by Finnish photographers from the collection of collectors Pieter and Marieke Sanders, which Marieke Sanders donated to Museum de Fundatie.\n\nThe exhibition is complemented by another 40 works from Pieter and Marieke Sanders' collection and several paintings and photographic works from the museum's own collection. In addition, four artists were asked to create their own presentations: Marijke van Warmerdam, Koos Breukel, Awoiska van der Molen and Miklos Gaàl. Guest curator of Northern light: nature photography is Maarten Bertheux.\n\nThe contemporary art collection of Pieter and Marieke Sanders, 14 November 2020 - 7 March 2021\n\nWith the participation of Kunstmuseum Den Haag, the Rijksmuseum, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and Teylers Museum, an exhibition of 70 contemporary art pieces from the Pieter and Marieke Sanders collection will open at Centraal Museum on 14 November. These works are part of a gift and conveyance of no less than 250 works to the Dutch State. To celebrate this conveyance, these five museums are presenting the collection as a whole for the last time, in the exhibition titled Collector’s Item. Each museum will be assigned a gallery in which to mount its own part of the exhibition. Visitors can count on encountering contemporary artists such as Marlene Dumas, Jan Hoek, Klaas Kloosterboer, Folkert de Jong and Gluklya. About the Sanders collection\n\nPieter and Marieke Sanders began to collect contemporary art by both young and upcoming and more established artists, both domestically and internationally, in the early 1970s. Their collection therefore forms a splendid reflection of the art made during the past few decades, as curated by Dutch museum-level galleries. Their collection comprises paintings, drawings, sculptures, small objects, installations, video work and artist’s books.The collection mainly consists of early work by artists such as Marlene Dumas, Babs Haenen, Hans Wilschut, Navid Nuur, Monali Meher, Driessens & Verstappen, Otobong Nkanga, Hannah van Bart, Katja Mater and many more.\n\nHaarlemse Lente (Haarlem Spring) is a contemporary art festival taking place throughout the city of Haarlem each year in spring. This year, with more than 12 participating institutions and artist collaboratives, we are celebrating our 5th anniversary. Over the course of a long weekend from March 18-20, the city will be filled with openings, exhibitions and additional activities, celebrating the flourishing art scene of Haarlem. The theme of this year's edition is 'the line'. In their exhibition space Pakhuisje Hal 88 Pieter and Marieke Sanders present two installations by the artists Germaine Kruip and Gluklya, and works on paper by artists from their collection. For the program see www.haarlemselente.nl\n\nThe 25th annual ARTnews Top 200 Collectors list is out, and it is full of new and familiar names alike. The list is based on confidential interviews with art professionals from around the world and on research by experienced ARTnews correspondents. See who's on this year's list on the website of ARTnews\n\nFun fact about the collection of Pieter and Marieke Sanders: 'At the Sanders residence, their art is part of the family. They share every meal, for example, with a large sculpture made of wood, iron, and steel named “Schlemiel”—a figure seated on old barrels by Uwe Henneken—which is installed in their dining room.'\n\n13–15 March, 2015 Haarlemse Lente (Haarlem Spring) is a contemporary art festival taking place throughout the city of Haarlem each year in spring. During this weekend, the city will be filled with openings, exhibitions and additional activities, celebrating the flourishing art scene of Haarlem. This year's edition of the festival marks the start of the Netherlands-Flanders Year. Therefore the participating institutions stress their special relationships and collaborations with Flemish institutions. On this occasion Pieter and Marieke Sanders show works by young Dutch and Flemish artists from their collection in the exhibition space Pakhuisje Hal 88.\n\nTo celebrate the reopening of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and to commemorate the tenure of director Ann Goldstein, Pieter and Marieke Sanders are making a major donation to the museum of 120 works by 92 artists, among others, Marijke van Warmerdam, Ryan Gander, Navid Nuur, Ger van Elk and Yael Bartana. In agreement with the collectors, the curators of the Stedelijk made a selection of works from the collection. The donated works contribute significantly to the Stedelijk’s holdings, both building upon the representation of the work of artists already present in the museum’s collection, and in many cases, also adding the first work by an artist. The gift includes photography, paintings, sculpture, video art and works on paper.\n\nRead the press release on the museum's website.\n\nJanuary 19–May 20, 2012 To celebrate the long friendship between the Teylers Museum and Marieke and Pieter Sanders the Museum's gallery of prints presented a selection of drawings from the Sanderses private collection in dialog with works on paper from the museum's collection. In bringing together these two very different collections new connections were made between older and newer works. Works by current artists, such as Marc Mulders, Jonathan Callan and Marcel van Eeden were shown alongside works by Rembrandt van Rijn and eighteenth-century Dutch artists Wybrand Hendriks and Dirk Langendijk.\n\nIn 2009 Pieter and Marieke Sanders gifted 94 works of art to The Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN). This institute, currently known as The Netherlands Cultural Heritage Agency (RCE), manages the State art collection. In agreement with the collectors, the ICN made a selection of works from the collection. The paintings and objects signify an important contribution to the modern and contemporary art collection of the ICN. The gift includes works from artists such as Rudi van de Wint, Emo Verkerk, Piet Tuijtel, Arie Berkulin, Fons Brasser, Carel Visser, Auke de Vries and many others.\n\nYou can access all the gifted artworks on the website Collectie Nederland."
