All English translations are from this publication. Van Gogh painted two groups of olive tree paintings in the summer and fall of 1889 while recuperating at the mental health facility of St.-Paul-de-Mausole near Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, in southern France. There, in the last year of his life, he painted almost 150 works, at least fifteen of which form part of the Olive Tree series.2Eleven of these are on size 30 canvases, including the Nelson-Atkins painting. The summer pictures, to which the Nelson-Atkins canvas traditionally belongs, include a closely related canvas in Otterlo (Fig. 1). Their overall shared palette of blues, greens, and yellows in loose gestural brushwork reflects the spontaneity of painting directly from nature, as well as the warmth and onset of summer. In November, Van Gogh started a second group of olive tree paintings, including canvases that are now in New York (Fig. 2) and Amsterdam (Fig. 3). Uniting these compositions are their autumnal palette, stippled brushwork, and stylized passages of broken color.3Van Gogh read about the âton rompuâ (broken tone), the âton vifâ (strong tone) and âles tons voisinsâ (neighboring tones) in Charles Blancâs essay on Delacroix: Charles Blanc, Les artistes de mon temps (Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1876), 65, 69â71, as cited in Van Goghâs letter to his brother Theo from mid-June 1884. See Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let450. Like many other Post-Impressionist painters, Van Gogh built up layers of different colors side by side and on top of one another, allowing two distinct yet closely related colors to mix in the viewerâs eye rather than on the canvas. Other than the shared subject matter, the summer and November/December paintings are completely different in their palette and approach. What happened between these periods, and in the course of age-related changes to the Nelson-Atkins painting, has significant bearing on the dating and understanding of its composition.4The initial inquiries into this question began with NAMA former associate curator of European painting Nicole R. Myers, paintings conservator Mary Schafer, and Mellon science advisor John Twilley.\n\nVan Gogh had painted variants of the same subject before, as he did with the blooming trees and wheat fields in Arles prior to his move to Saint-RÃ©my in May of 1889. He experimented with style, technique, and color in an attempt to capture the essential features of these subjects, just as he later did with the olive trees. He saw olive trees as emblematic of Provence, but they also held spiritual significance for him.5In a letter to Theo in April 1889, Van Gogh remarked âOh my dear Theo, if you saw the olive trees at this time. . . . It is something completely different from oneâs idea of it in the North—itâs a thing of such delicacy—so refined. It is like the looped willows of our Dutch meadows . . . , that is to say, the rustle of an olive grove has something very intimate, something tremendously old about it.â Vincent van Gogh, Arles, to Theo van Gogh, April 28, 1889, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let763. In the expressive power of their ancient and twisted forms, Van Gogh found a manifestation of the divine force he believed resided in all of nature. The previous summer of 1888, while in Arles with his friend Paul Gauguin (1848â1903), Van Gogh had attempted to depict this force literally by painting two canvases featuring Christ with an angel in the Garden of Gethsemane, at the foot of the Mount of Olives. Both times, he scraped them off.6Vincent van Gogh, Arles, to Theo van Gogh, September 21, 1888, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let685. Van Gogh believed that âthinking and not dreaming was [his] duty,â and he ultimately found a way to depict these trees that carried religious associations without painting something he did not see.7Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, September 21, 1888, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let685. See also Samantha Friedman, Van Gogh, DalÃ­, and Beyond: The World Reimagined, exh. cat. (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 2013), 15â17. It could be said that he looked to nature directly and found his salvation there.\n\nWhile at Saint-RÃ©my, Van Gogh was under the care of Dr. ThÃ©ophile Peyron, a former naval doctor. For the first month of the artistâs stay, Peyron insisted he remain inside to rest, so Van Gogh looked out his window to the garden and painted the irises, butterflies, and poppies he saw there.8See Vincent van Gogh, Irises, 1889, oil on canvas, 29 1/4 x 37 1/8 in. (74.3 x 94.3 cm), J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; and Vincent van Gogh, Butterflies and Poppies, MayâJune 1889, oil on canvas, 13 3/4 x 10 in. (35 cm x 25.5 cm), Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam. For him, budding flowers symbolized the cycle of life; he saw trees, the landscape, caterpillars, and the emergent cicadas as representative of transformation, something he hoped would happen to him while recuperating.9One year before checking himself in at Saint-RÃ©my, Van Gogh referenced Ãmile Zolaâs La Faute de lâAbbÃ© Mouret, an 1875 novel about a monk who finds solace in an overgrown garden where a young woman nurses him back to health. This sheds light onto his interest in gardens and his belief in their restorative effect. Jennifer Helvey, Irises: Vincent van Gogh in the Garden (Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Publications, 2009), 96. Van Gogh longed to paint outside, beyond the confines of the facilityâs enclosed courtyard. By the first week of June, Peyron lifted the restrictions, and Van Gogh got his wish.\n\nWith a fresh supply of materials from his brother, Theo, Van Gogh started at least five paintings featuring olive trees in or around June 1889, including the Nelson-Atkins picture, which he painted on a commercially pre-primed, standard size 30 canvas.10See the accompanying technical entry by Schafer and Twilley. Verdant olive trees and a meandering path rendered in long, curving brushstrokes of gray-green and yellow are bordered by a brilliant row of red poppies. These elements invite viewers into the composition. The vertical wet-into-wet brushstrokes of the path are met by horizontal brushstrokes that articulate the ruggedness of the terrain beneath the trees (Fig. 11 in Conservation Technical Entry). In other areas of the composition, in particular at the far right in the trees (Fig. 17 in Conservation Technical Entry), Van Gogh applied short dabs of fresh yellow paint over longer strokes which had already dried. This is one indication that he painted the composition in two distinct sessions.11For further information on this aspect of Van Goghâs painting, see the accompanying technical entry by Schafer and Twilley. Dappled spots of sunlight shine between the olive trees, making the heat of southern France feel almost palpable. Without painting the sun, Van Gogh transmitted its energy to his canvas.\n\nThe relationships between colors, and how they interact to intensify tones and create harmony, mood, and emotion, were essential to Van Gogh; he was particularly interested in the juxtaposition of complementary colors (red/green, blue/orange, violet/yellow). He learned about these pairings by looking at the work of EugÃ¨ne Delacroix (1798â1863) and reading Charles Blancâs Grammaire des arts du dessin (1867).12The first color of each pair is a primary: red, yellow, and blue. Mixing them produces a secondary color: for example, red and blue make purple. That secondary color is complementary to the primary color that was not used in the mixture. Those primary and secondary colors, such as red and green, reinforce each other when juxtaposed. This phenomenon, known as the law of âsimultaneous contrast,â was first described by the physicist Michel EugÃ¨ne Chevreul in 1839 and practiced by the artist EugÃ¨ne Delacroix. It had a tremendous impact on Van Goghâs palette. See Charles Blanc, The Grammar of Painting and Engraving, trans. Kate Newell Doggett, 3rd ed. (1867; repr., New York, Hurd and Houghton, 1879). See also Michel EugÃ¨ne Chevreul, The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colours and their Applications to the Arts, trans. Charles Martel (1839; repr., London: Bell, 1916). Van Gogh cites Delacroix numerous times throughout his letters, referencing his interest in Delacroixâs use of color. Van Gogh wrote to Theo on April 18, 1885 (Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let494) and copied a passage out of Charles Blanc on Delacroix that ties these interests together. The passage Van Gogh copied comes from Blanc, Les artistes de mon temps, 64-66, 69, as cited in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let494, n10. Some of these color relationships appear in the Nelson-Atkins canvas: red poppies are set against or in close proximity to green foliage, and brilliant strokes of yellow/orange run alongside blue outlines of select trees.13Information on the specific pigments was obtained from Schafer and Twilley. See their accompanying technical entry for palette analysis. Seemingly missing in this group of complementary pairings, however, is violet and yellow.\n\nMapping Van Goghâs palette in the Kansas City picture—tracking the locations where he used specific pigments—is essential for understanding the artistâs original intent. One of many findings through recent X-ray fluorescence spectrometry elemental mapping (MA-XRF), conducted by Mellon science advisor John Twilley and Nelson-Atkins paintings conservator Mary Schafer, revealed that the artist used a mixture of âgeranium lakeâ and zinc white with cobalt and ultramarine blues in the shadows at the base of the olive trees. Because Van Gogh knew that geranium lake had a propensity to fade, he compensated by applying it in greater concentration.14Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Arles, on or about Wednesday, April 11, 1888, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let595: âAll the colors that Impressionism has made fashionable are unstable, all the more reason boldly to use them too raw, time will only soften them too much.â Original emphasis. This strategy, however, was not sufficient over the long term.15Geranium lake fades more completely when mixed with zinc white, as Van Gogh did at the base of the trees. See the accompanying technical entry by Schafer and Twilley. Only the blue and zinc white components remain visible, thus yielding blue shadows beneath the trees, where violet was intended to serve as a complement to the nearby yellowish orange strokes in the tree trunks.16The more extreme effect of fading occurs in the now mostly white mixtures of the foreground. These and other newly revealed complementary pairings, based on technical analyses of the painting, can be found in the accompanying technical entry by Schafer and Twilley. The discovery of the once-violet shadows connects the painting more firmly to a letter the artist wrote to his sister on June 16, 1889, about a landscape of an olive grove he had âjust finishedâ with gray leaves, âtheir cast shadows violet on the sun-drenched sand.â17Ronald Pickvance was the first scholar to associate this letter with the Nelson-Atkins painting. See Ronald Pickvance, Van Gogh in Saint-RÃ©my and Auvers (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, and New York: Abrams, 1986), 293. See also the accompanying technical entry by Schafer and Twilley. Previously, many scholars believed the letter related to an olive tree study the artist painted in June of 1889 (National Gallery of Scotland) that the artist sent to his brother on consignment a month later.\n\nThe phrase âjust finishedâ proves troubling.18Van Gogh felt the canvas was finished on June 16. He set it aside, having either rolled it or stacked it with other unstretched work while still somewhat wet, as evidenced by the presence of canvas weave impressions in the impasto. See accompanying technical entry. We know that Van Gogh was only allowed to paint outdoors in the first week of June, and this does not seem to allow enough time for him to have realized two successive campaigns of painting, with the earlier layers of paint left undisturbed and no evidence of intermixing of colors. In other words, evidence of wet-over-dry brushwork indicates that Van Gogh applied paint to the canvas again after it was dry (Fig. 14 in Conservation Technical Entry). While it is impossible to determine precisely how much time would be needed for the paint to dry between the artistâs initial campaign, begun no earlier than the first week of June, and a second campaign, it is highly unlikely this could have occurred by June 16, when he wrote the letter to his sister that he had âjust finishedâ the picture. Determining when Van Gogh may have painted the second campaign of the Nelson-Atkins painting is critical to understanding how the picture fits within the Olive Tree series.\n\nMany scholars argue that Van Goghâs more stylized approach to the Olive Tree series, associated with the work he undertook in the fall of 1889, was in reaction to a group of imaginative religious paintings recently shared with him by Gauguin and Bernard.19In a letter sent to Ãmile Bernard on or about November 26, Van Gogh chastises him for his imaginative approach to his subject matter and advises him to start with nature. This is based on a number of religious compositions Bernard had recently shared with Van Gogh. In their respective object labels online, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Van Gogh Museum suggest that their fall Olive Tree paintings, with their stylized brushwork, are in response to Gauguinâs and Bernardâs recent compositions; however, these artists did not send their works to Van Gogh until well after he retouched the Nelson-Atkins composition with short, stippled brushwork. See https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437998 (accessed August 24, 2020) and https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0045V1962 (accessed August 24, 2020). Vincent van Gogh to Ãmile Bernard, on or about November 26, 1889, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let822. It is this authorâs contention, however, that Van Goghâs shift in thinking about approach started earlier. Van Gogh suffered a mental relapse between the first (summer) and second (fall) group of Olive Tree pictures. From July 16 until August 22, he could neither write nor paint. By September 5â6, he still had not set foot outside, but he was back at his easel âretouching some studies from this summer . . . with renewed clarity,â as he wrote to Theo.20Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, Thursday, September 5, to Friday, September 6, 1889, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let800. This timing could work for a second campaign of paint on the Nelson-Atkins composition, allowing enough drying time for him to include it in the third group of paintings he sent to Theo (his art dealer as well as his brother) on September 28.21Van Gogh sent seven consignments to Theo during his time at Saint-RÃ©my. The first, on July 15, did not include the Kansas City painting. Scholars including Jansen, Luijten, and Bakker contend that while Van Gogh mentions sending an olive tree composition in this first batch of paintings, it was not a size 30 canvas and therefore could not have been the Nelson-Atkins composition. See Vincent van Gogh, Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, to Theo van Gogh, Sunday, July 14, or Monday, July 15, 1889, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let789. Van Gogh sent the next two batches to Theo in short succession on September 19 and September 28. While it is possible he included the Kansas City painting in the consignment on September 19, this would have only given the canvas a little less than two weeks of drying time, making it more plausible that he included it in the September 28 shipment. See the accompanying technical entry by Schafer and Twilley. Van Goghâs period of reinvigoration came at the same moment he received an invitation to exhibit with Bernard and Les XX, a group of twenty avant-garde artists founded by attorney Octave Maus, in their next exhibition in Brussels.22He mentions this invitation in the same September 5â6 letter in which he talks about having renewed clarity (Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, September 5â6, 1889, in Jansen et., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let800). The exhibitions of Les XX also included a number of symbolist and Neo-Impressionist painters such as Theo van Rysselberghe (Belgian, 1862â1926), Maximilien Luce (1858â1941), Henri-Edmond Cross (1856â1910), and Georges Seurat (1859â1891), all of whom exhibited in the 1889 exhibition and many of whom painted in a pointillist style, with tiny dabs of pure color.23Theo van Rysselberghe met with Theo van Gogh in Paris in 1889, and Theo showed Van Rysselberghe many of Vincentâs paintings. This may have precipitated the invitation for Vincent to exhibit with Les XX the following year. See letter from Theo van Gogh to Vincent van Gogh, Paris, Tuesday, October 22, 1889, in which he mentions this meeting, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let813. In that same letter of September 5â6, Van Gogh continued, âI would really like to exhibit there, while feeling my inferiority alongside so many Belgians who have an enormous amount of talent.â24Van Gogh singles out Belgian Symbolist painter Xavier Mellery (1845â1921), who he felt had an enormous amount of talent. Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, September 5â6, 1889, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let800. A few days later, on September 10, he revealed to Theo how his newfound clarity affected his approach to painting, his brushwork in particular:\n\nWhat a funny thing theÂ touchÂ is, the brushstroke. Out of doors, exposed to the wind, the sun, peopleâs curiosity, one works as one can, one fills oneâs canvas regardless. Yet then one catches the true and the essential—thatâs the most difficult thing. But when one returns to this study again after a time, and orders oneâs brushstrokes in the direction of the objects—certainly itâs more harmonious and agreeable to see, and one adds to it whatever one has of serenity and smiles.25Vincent van Gogh, Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, to Theo van Gogh, Tuesday, September 10, 1889, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let801.\n\nAll of these ideas, along with the invitation in September to exhibit with Les XX (and his ensuing trepidation about it), were with him at the precise moment he returned to retouch the Nelson-Atkins picture, which includes many passages of short, stippled brushwork. Ordering his brushstrokes âin the direction of the objects,â while a continuation of his earlier approach that summer, became more definitive in the fall Olive Tree paintings. The final state of the Nelson-Atkins composition reflects the artistâs effort to work through these ideas well after initiating the project in early June. This positions the Kansas City picture as a transitional painting within the Olive Tree series, belonging more to the paintings he completed in the fall rather than the summer pictures.\n\nRegardless of his approach in the Olive Trees series, Van Gogh found something eternal in the continuous rhythm of their twisted forms. His undulating brushstrokes of color make the soil come alive with the same energy that animates the branches rustling in the wind. The brushwork in the Nelson-Atkins painting, and in the Olive Tree series in general, communicates in a physical way the living force that Van Gogh found within the trees themselves.26For more on the dynamic force and spiritual essence that Van Gogh saw in trees, see Ralph Skea, Vincentâs Trees: Paintings and Drawings by Van Gogh (London: Thames and Hudson, 2013), 15; and Vincent van Gogh, Auvers-sur-Oise, to Joseph IsaÃ¤cson, May 25, 1890, in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/RM21/letter.html.\n\nThe painting remained with Theo van Goghâs widow after his death in 1891 until at least 1905, at which point it went to Berlin and then Vienna by way of two commercial dealers, Paul Cassirer and Carl Moll. By 1910, it was acquired by Hungarian collector Baron Adolf Kohner (1865/6â1937), who hung it over the piano in the yellow-wallpapered music room of his Budapest home, alongside works by Alfred Sisley, Gauguin, Claude Monet, and EugÃ¨ne Boudin (Fig. 4). When the Nelson-Atkins Museum acquired Van Goghâs Olive Trees in 1932 from the dealers Paul Rosenberg and Durand-Ruel, it was only the second public art institution in the United States to obtain a work by the master.27The honor of the first goes to the Detroit Institute of Arts, with their 1922 acquisition of Van Goghâs Self-Portrait in a Straw Hat (1887).

The passage Van Gogh copied comes from Blanc, Les artistes de mon temps, 64-66, 69, as cited in Jansen et al., Letters, http://vangoghletters.org/en/let494, n10.\n\nInformation on the specific pigments was obtained from Schafer and Twilley.

Previously, many scholars believed the letter related to an olive tree study the artist painted in June of 1889 (National Gallery of Scotland) that the artist sent to his brother on consignment a month later.\n\nVan Gogh felt the canvas was finished on June 16. He set it aside, having either rolled it or stacked it with other unstretched work while still somewhat wet, as evidenced by the presence of canvas weave impressions in the impasto. See accompanying technical entry.\n\nIn a letter sent to Ãmile Bernard on or about November 26, Van Gogh chastises him for his imaginative approach to his subject matter and advises him to start with nature. This is based on a number of religious compositions Bernard had recently shared with Van Gogh. In their respective object labels online, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Van Gogh Museum suggest that their fall Olive Tree paintings, with their stylized brushwork, are in response to Gauguinâs and Bernardâs recent compositions; however, these artists did not send their works to Van Gogh until well after he retouched the Nelson-Atkins composition with short, stippled brushwork.

The first, on July 15, did not include the Kansas City painting. Scholars including Jansen, Luijten, and Bakker contend that while Van Gogh mentions sending an olive tree composition in this first batch of paintings, it was not a size 30 canvas and therefore could not have been the Nelson-Atkins composition.

Mellon Foundation for conservation science at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.\n\nAbove the ground, Van Goghâs first paint applications included an initial lay-in of color to the foreground and painted lines that position several compositional elements.3No underdrawing was detected using magnified inspection or infrared imaging conducted in the infrared spectrum between wavelengths of 700 â 2200 nanometers. Using thin, pale green paint and loose brushwork, Van Gogh roughly blocked in the lower half of the painting without a reservereserve: An area of the composition left unpainted with the intention of inserting a feature at a later stage in the painting process. for the path, left foliage grouping, or the base of the central trees (Fig. 5). The ground layer remains exposed in the foreground, confirming that this pale green, which varies slightly in color, was not applied as a continuous layer. A number of guiding strokes of fluid, blue paint were used to loosely outline the upper trees. Many of these blue strokes lie on top of light blue sky, indicating that passages of sky were also established in this early stage of painting (Fig. 6). Evidence from XRF elemental mappingX-ray fluorescence spectrometry elemental mapping (MA-XRF) or XRF elemental mapping: A non-destructive technique that entails collecting thousands of X-ray fluorescence spectra at regular intervals across a painting to build an alternate set of images depicting the locations and amounts of different elements. Although the information is fundamentally the same as measurements gathered from a single-point XRF, the graphical nature of the result is often a more powerful technique for understanding trends in an artistâs use of materials. The high number of spectra allows statistical manipulations of the elemental information to locate correlations between different pigments that would not be possible from a small number of tests. For example, the consistent occurrence of mercury along with chromium, and iron along with copper, could show that vermilion was used to mute the chrome green and red ocher was similarly employed in a mixture that includes emerald green. The resulting correlation maps then serve to show where the two cases occur in the composition. MA-XRF can also reveal preliminary paint applications that became covered as the composition was completed, thereby disclosing aspects of the painterâs method. suggests that additional components of the composition, now covered by subsequent paint, were similarly outlined.4X-ray fluorescence spectrometry elemental mapping was undertaken as part of a collaboration with the Laboratory of Molecular and Structural Archaeology, directed by Philippe Walter (CNRS/Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris) by which their instrument design and operational software was provided to the authors. The centermost trunk of the central olive tree, for instance, was initially painted with two linear strokes of cobalt blue, before Van Gogh transformed the trunk into a more angular, twisting form, with final outlines in Prussian blue (Fig. 7). XRF mapping also confirms that a painted line of cobalt blue marked the sweeping, outer edge of the path at the lower left (Fig. 8). Although the upper half of Olive Trees is more densely covered by overlapping strokes, there are occasional glimpses of underlying paint that range in color from pinkish-gray to brighter red. These paint strokes may relate to early positioning of the upper trees and the base of the central tree (Fig. 9). For example, a forked shape beneath the paint of the distant trees may correspond to a tree trunk that was never fully realized.\n\nUsing loose, painterly brushwork and thick, viscous paint, Van Gogh produced a lively, tactile surface in his representation of the olive grove (Fig. 10). Wet-over-wetwet-over-wet: An oil painting technique which involves drawing a stroke of one color across the wet paint of another color. paint applications are evident throughout the landscape (Fig. 11). While there is intermingling of colors that occurred during their separate applications to the canvas, there are also paint mixtures that were incompletely blended on the palette prior to being applied on the canvas together. The foreground was constructed using somewhat linear, directional strokes whose angles create movement and depict an undulating terrain. The winding path at lower left is indicated similarly. The viewerâs eye is drawn forward along the path and deeper into the trees by their trajectories, creating a sense of perspective in the absence of straight lines or planes. Short, horizontal strokes in the middle distance produce the alternating patches of sunlight and shadow that lie across the ground. The upper trees consist of long, curving strokes, often applied in groupings of a single color (Fig. 10). Dark blue painted outlines, a mixture of ultramarine and Prussian blue, appear to have been added to reinstate definition that had become less distinct over the course of painting (Fig. 6). Collectively, the extensive wet-over-wet brushwork and the presence of debris lodged in the paint indicate that Olive Trees was, at least initially, painted en plein airen plein air (adjective: plein-air): French for âoutdoors.â The term is used to describe the act of painting quickly outside rather than in a studio.. Plant material encased in paint is evident in several locations (Fig. 12), and a tiny grasshopper is visible on the lower foreground with the aid of magnification (Fig. 13).5The authors are grateful to paleo-entomologist, Dr. Michael S. Engel, senior curator and university distinguished professor, University of Kansas, and associate, American Museum of Natural History, NY. Dr. Engel determined that the disarticulated body fragments (head and hind leg) lodged in the wet paint of Olive Trees point to an already dead nymph or a shed exuvium. This fact prohibited the use of the annual seasonal cycle of grasshoppers in the region during 1889 to gain more specificity as to the months in which Van Gogh completed the landscape.\n\nOver the course of painting, Van Gogh made several modifications to the composition. He applied light blue paint on top of existing trees to add or expand areas of the sky, and the width of the lower right tree was cropped on its left side. Distant trees, located near the left horizon line and continuing toward the central trees, were reinforced and adjusted with gray-blue outlines, applied wet-over-drywet-over-dry: An oil painting technique that involves layering paint over an already dried layer, resulting in no intermixing of paint or disruption to the lower paint strokes. (Fig. 9).\n\nOther significant artist changes occurred during a later stage of painting. Although Van Gogh began this landscape in June of 1889,6See the accompanying catalogue essay by Aimee Marcereau DeGalan. the presence of numerous wet-over-dry additions, paint losses, and a stylistic shift in Van Goghâs brushwork suggest that Olive Trees was painted in two distinct sessions and completed in the fall.7The findings presented include those from an earlier 2012 study with curatorial contributions by Nicole R. Myers, former associate curator, European paintings and sculpture, The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. These later additions had no effect on the impastoimpasto: A thick application of paint, often creating texture such as peaks and ridges. of the earlier paint strokes, indicating that the paint surface was solidly dry by the time Van Gogh returned to the canvas (Fig. 14). Poor adhesion between the first and second phase paint is also prevalent (Fig. 15), resulting in losses which expose underlying paint colors. Light-colored mixtures associated with the second phase paint are also characterized by a gritty texture (Fig. 16).8The underlying cause of this granular appearance has not been definitively identified. This distinctive texture is most prevalent among the lighter paint mixtures, and although zinc-fatty acid soap formations are widespread within the paints of both phases, the formations do not protrude through or disrupt the paint surface in those locations where they have been found inside samples. Zinc-fatty acid soaps, formed by reactions between zinc white and free fatty acids present in the oil paint, have been widely cited as a cause of adhesion loss between successive applications of oil paints based on zinc white, as in the case of Olive Trees. Crystalline zinc soaps have been found at the interface between the delaminating paint layers in various paintings based on zinc white. See for example L. Raven, M. Bisschoff, M. Leeuwestein, M. Geldof, J.J. Hermans, M. Stols-Witlox, and K. Keune, âDelamination Due to Zinc Soap Formation in an Oil Painting by Piet Mondrian (1872â1944): Conservation Issues and Possible Implications for Treatment,â in Metal Soaps in Art: Conservation and Research, ed. F. Casadio, K. Keune, P. Noble, A. Van Loon, E. Hendriks, S.A. Centeno, and G. Osmond (Springer Cultural Heritage Science Series, 2019), 343â58. While second phase painting in the foreground introduced additions of white, pale blue, yellow, and dark teal, there is no noticeable shift in brushwork from one phase to the next. In the trees, however, Van Gogh disrupted the long curving strokes with later dabs or dashes of paint, a manner of painting that resembles the tighter brushwork and smaller dabs of paint found among his later olive tree paintings produced in the fall of 1889 (Fig. 17).\n\nSeveral canvas weave impressions in the impasto indicate that the painting was rolled or stacked with other works before its surface was fully dry (Fig. 18). These impressions seem to occur exclusively in the first phase paint, reinforcing the observation that Van Gogh set Olive Trees aside and resumed painting at a later date. The evidence of two painting phases strengthens the possibility that the Nelson-Atkins painting was shipped with a later consignment of canvases sent to Theo van Gogh in September of 1889.9Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, September 28, 1889, in Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, no. b656 V/1962; published in Leo Jansen, Hans Luijten, and Nienke Bakker, eds., Vincent van Gogh: The Letters (Amsterdam and The Hague: Van Gogh Museum and Huygens, 2009), no. 806, http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let806/letter.html. All English translations are from this publication. In footnote 8, the Nelson-Atkins painting is suggested to be the olive grove described in relation to this shipment.,10A collaborative research project, led by the Dallas Art Museum and Van Gogh Museum, to study all fifteen paintings that comprise the olive tree series is underway and may clarify the chronology and shipment dates of the entire series. Nienke Bakker and Nicole R. Myers, eds., Van Gogh and the Olive Groves (Dallas: Dallas Museum of Art; Amsterdam: Van Gogh Museum, forthcoming).\n\nVan Goghâs palette for Olive Trees included geranium lake,11âLakeâ pigment is produced by the combination of a soluble dye color with a soluble, usually colorless inorganic compound to produce a colored precipitate that can be handled like a dry pigment and thereafter combined with oil. In some cases, the precipitation was carried out in the presence of a colored carrier so that the dye precipitate coats a particle of another pigment. In 1889 eosin lakes of several varieties were available, including some that were precipitated on red lead for their combined color. However, Van Gogh employed the âgeraniumâ lake whose color was solely that of its eosin content. Eosin was synthesized in 1871. See M.J. Depierre, âNote on the Application of Eosin,â American Chemist 6â7 (New York: C.F. & W. H. Chandler, 1875), 217. red lead oxide, vermilion, chrome yellow and chrome orange, viridian (hydrated chrome oxide), emerald green (copper acetoarsenite), synthetic ultramarine, cobalt blue, Prussian blue, and zinc white (see Table 1). Although his paint mixtures for works in the olive trees series incorporated both zinc white and lead white,12Kathryn A. Dooley, Annalisa Chieli, Aldo Romani, Stijn Legrand, Costanza Miliani, Koen Janssens, and John K. Delaney, âMolecular Fluorescence Imaging Spectroscopy for Mapping Low Concentrations of Red Lake Pigments: Vanâ Goghâs Painting The Olive Orchard,â Angewandte Chemie 59, no. 15 (April 6, 2020): 6046â53. he used zinc white almost exclusively in this case. Lead white occurrences are so finely dispersed as to suggest that it was a manufacturerâs additive in some of the tube colors, probably to enhance the drying of the oils with slow drying pigments, such as ultramarine. Calcite, gypsum, and white clay also occur as additives rather than primary white pigments. Charcoal is used very sparingly in drab greens. Several other pigments are notable for their absence. For example, cadmium yellow was not used, and yellow ocher is encountered only in very dilute yellow mixtures. Red lakes involving alizarin or carmine that he used in other works of the period were omitted.13Dooley et al., âMolecular Fluorescence Imaging Spectroscopy,â 6050. Tin and calcium associated with these lakes were not associated with the red lake in the Nelson-Atkins Olive Trees.\n\nIn addition to producing violet colors, geranium lake was added to blue-green mixtures to render them nearly black. However, it was not the sole means of producing violet shades in a painting that employed no violet pigments. Red lead, used sparingly in the painting, was mixed to produce dull violet and gray-violet shades that have not faded like those formulated with geranium lake. Often the red lead occurs in the tree trunks in combination with Prussian blue, a mixture that appears flatter, and more opaque, than the mixtures incorporating geranium lake with ultramarine or cobalt blue.\n\nXRF mapping of individual elements offers insights into Van Goghâs use of mixtures but often must be supplemented by other techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM)scanning electron microscopy (SEM): Performed on a microsample of paint, the SEM provides a means of studying particle shapes beyond the magnification limits of the light microscope. This becomes increasingly important with the painting materials introduced in the early modern era, which are finer and more diverse than traditional artistsâ materials. The SEM is routinely used in conjunction with an X-ray spectrometer, so that elemental identifications can be made selectively on the same minute scale as the electron beam producing the images. SEM methods are particularly valuable in studying unstable pigments, adverse interactions between incompatible pigments, and interactions between pigments and surrounding paint medium, all of which can have profound effects on the appearance of a painting., Raman spectroscopyRaman spectroscopy: A microanalytical technique applicable primarily to pigments and minerals, differentiating them based on both chemical bonding and crystal structure, often with extremely high sensitivity for individual particles. For example, traditional indigo and synthetic phthalocyanine blue are both carbon compounds not well differentiated by other methods utilized here, especially when used dilutely. However, they give unique Raman spectra. Calcium carbonates derived from chalk or pulverized oyster shell of identical chemical compositions can be differentiated based on their crystal structures (calcite and aragonite, respectively)., Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR): A broadly applicable microanalysis method for the identification of paint media classes such as oils, polysaccharides (gum arabic, etc.), proteins (glue and casein tempera), waxes (medium additions and restoration treatments), resins (varnish components), and synthetic media (restoration acrylics). FTIR is also very important for identifying pigments and fillers, and for differentiating closely-related compounds (e.g. neutral and basic lead carbonates, both of which may be found in lead white)., and polarized light microscopy (PLM)polarized light microscopy (PLM): A method used for the study and differentiation of pigments based on the optical properties of individual particles, including color, refractive index, birefringence, etc. PLM is particularly useful in identifying the presence of organic pigments such as indigo and Prussian blue, which often cannot be differentiated from paint medium in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM); differentiating synthetic pigments from their natural analogs by particle shape or the presence of extraneous mineral matter; and disclosing the presence of pigments with similar composition but differing color, such as red and yellow iron oxides. to differentiate pigments that either share the same elements or are not detectable by XRF mapping (see Table 1). Chromium is present in both chrome yellow and viridian, for example, and a lead response can originate from red lead, lead white, or chrome yellow. Ultramarine, a very important blue within the landscape, has no heavy elements and cannot be mapped under these conditions. PLM was particularly important in locating unfaded remnants of geranium lake.\n\nXRF mapping demonstrates that viridian and emerald green were seldom combined in the strongest greens, with most foliage being depicted by clusters of strokes based upon either one or the other (Fig. 19). Another important finding is that greens in Olive Trees were seldom formulated from yellow-blue mixtures. Only drab olive greens were based upon mixtures of chrome yellow and ultramarine (with charcoal and red lead). Because zinc white was used for the principal white pigment rather than lead white, the distribution of lead in the paint correlates most often to chrome yellow. The lead map, therefore, helps to differentiate those greens that were modified by blending chrome yellow with viridian from those in which the chromium was introduced solely with viridian.\n\nGeranium lake became a component of Van Goghâs palette following his arrival in Arles in 1888, and the importance of this brilliant red cannot be overstated.14Muriel Geldof, Matthijs de Keijzer, Maarten van Bommel, Kathrin Pilz, Johanna Salvant, Henk van Keulen, and Luc Megens, âVan Goghâs Geranium Lake,â in Van Goghâs Studio Practice, ed. Marije Vellekoop, Muriel Geldof, Ella Hendriks, Leo Jansen, and Alberto de Tagle (Brussels: Mercatorfonds, 2013), 285â86. On the Nelson-Atkins painting, geranium lake, formulated with alum, was used in its pure form to depict a few flowers, vertical shoots (Figs. 20 and 21), and accents on the trunks of the central tree. The red lake is also visible where it was incompletely mixed with other colors, such as the medium blue paint in the shadows below the central tree (Fig. 22). Pigment microscopy, however, has shown that where Van Gogh used geranium lake in mixtures, it has faded nearly completely due to light exposure, resulting in present-day colors that differ substantially from the artistâs intentions (Figs. 23-25).15All references to specific pigments are based on identification from samples that were examined in the scanning electron microscope, supported with elemental analysis by X-ray spectrometry. Polarized light microscopy was used to screen for compounds not responsive to other tests and to correlate colors to the proportions of mixtures. Confirmatory pigment identifications were carried out with Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. They are now dominated by the more stable pigments in the mixture whose colors the geranium lake once modified.\n\nUnlike some published examples of Van Goghâs work in which geranium lake remains protected under the frame edge, from which its color could be virtually extrapolated to other parts of the painting, Olive Trees has no surviving lake mixtures to provide these visual cues. To evaluate the impact of the fading on the color relationships of Olive Trees, XRF elemental mapping was conducted to determine the distribution of bromine across the painting. Bromine, prevalent in the eosin dye16Eosin is a water-soluble, synthetic dye invented in 1871 and soon after adapted to painting use in the form of a âlakeâ pigment of which there were several varieties. The variety found in Olive Trees contains eosin bound to aluminum ions derived from an alum solution. See A. Baeyer, âUeber eine neue Klasse von Farbstoffen,â Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 4, no. 2 (1871): 555â58; M. J. Depierre,âNote on the Application of Eosin,â 217; A. H. Allen, Commercial Organic Analysis, 2nd ed., vol. 3, part 1 (Philadelphia: P. Blakiston, Son, 1889), 167â73. This âgeraniumâ lake can be markedly faded by light exposure, a detrimental trait already known when employed by Van Gogh. By 1900 its short-lived commercial success was already being referred to in the past tense. See F. H. Jennison, The Manufacture of Lake Pigments from Artificial Colours (London: Scott, Greenwood & Son; New York: Van Nostrand, 1900). molecule that is responsible for the color of geranium lake, remains in place in proportion to its amount in the paint mixture even as the color fades (Fig. 26). Pale blue paint strokes throughout the foreground contain this fugitive red lake, and Figure 27 reveals the preserved pink color beneath the paint surface, beyond the reach of light. The juxtaposition of this now-faded pink among the various green brushstrokes of the foreground would have produced a striking interplay of complementary colors and broken tones.17See the accompanying catalogue essay by Aimee Marcereau DeGalan. For an overview of Van Goghâs experimentation with color, see Maite van Dijk, âVan Gogh and the Laws of Colour: An Introduction,â in Van Goghâs Studio Practice, 216â25.\n\nSimilarly, the blue shadows at the base of the olive trees were once violet in color, a detail that closely connects the Nelson-Atkins painting to a description in Van Goghâs June 1889 letter: âIâve just finished a landscape of an olive grove with gray foliage more or less like that of the willows, their cast shadows violet on the sun-drenched sand.â18Vincent van Gogh to Willemien van Gogh, June 16, 1889 in Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, no. b.712 V/1962; as cited in Jansen et al., Letters, http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let780/letter.html. These violet shadows would have heightened the yellow tonalities on the adjacent sun-splashed ground.\n\nThe fading of the red lake from the paint surface also affects the dark blue paint strokes of the central trees at the top edge, which contain mixtures of ultramarine and geranium lake in nearly equal proportions. This blue color was once dark violet (Fig. 28). The use of complementary colors to achieve a sense of vibrancy is evident in the tree trunks where pure chrome yellow was placed beside a violet mixture of ultramarine and geranium lake with a small amount of viridian (Fig. 29). Fading of the lake has diminished the optical effect, as ultramarine blue is the dominate color today. A microsample of the violet paint, sheltered from fading by the overlying chrome yellow, reveals its original color (Fig. 30).\n\nNumerous paint losses, the majority of which are part of the second phase of painting, are evident across the landscape, concentrated in the lower foreground and upper and right trees. In some cases, the detachment of the paint caused the loss of multiple strokes applied during the second phase (Fig. 15). The highly textured surface of Olive Trees effectively distracts from these paint losses, but like the faded geranium lake, their loss impacts the appearance of the landscape. The losses expose underlying paint colors that were not meant to be visible. For example, paint loss in a large section of expanded blue sky on the upper left has exposed the underlying green paint of the trees, effectively undoing this modification by the artist (Fig. 31).\n\nDespite the important instances of paint loss and color fading, the painting is in stable condition today.

When the painting was last treated in 2005, a low concentration of Regalrez varnish was brush-applied to the paint surface, followed by removal of much of the varnish with a dry brush, in an effort to reach an appropriate saturation level while maintaining an unvarnished appearance.19Scott Heffley, December 8, 2005, treatment report, Nelson-Atkins conservation file, no. 32-2.\n\nMary Schafer and John Twilley\n\nMarch 2020\n\nNotes\n\nAnthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (London: Yale University Press, 2000), 15.\n\nThe scientific study of Olive Trees was supported by an endowment from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for conservation science at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.\n\nNo underdrawing was detected using magnified inspection or infrared imaging conducted in the infrared spectrum between wavelengths of 700 â 2200 nanometers.\n\nX-ray fluorescence spectrometry elemental mapping was undertaken as part of a collaboration with the Laboratory of Molecular and Structural Archaeology, directed by Philippe Walter (CNRS/Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris) by which their instrument design and operational software was provided to the authors.\n\nThe authors are grateful to paleo-entomologist, Dr. Michael S. Engel, senior curator and university distinguished professor, University of Kansas, and associate, American Museum of Natural History, NY. Dr. Engel determined that the disarticulated body fragments (head and hind leg) lodged in the wet paint of Olive Trees point to an already dead nymph or a shed exuvium. This fact prohibited the use of the annual seasonal cycle of grasshoppers in the region during 1889 to gain more specificity as to the months in which Van Gogh completed the landscape.\n\nSee the accompanying catalogue essay by Aimee Marcereau DeGalan.\n\nThe findings presented include those from an earlier 2012 study with curatorial contributions by Nicole R. Myers, former associate curator, European paintings and sculpture, The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.\n\nThe underlying cause of this granular appearance has not been definitively identified. This distinctive texture is most prevalent among the lighter paint mixtures, and although zinc-fatty acid soap formations are widespread within the paints of both phases, the formations do not protrude through or disrupt the paint surface in those locations where they have been found inside samples. Zinc-fatty acid soaps, formed by reactions between zinc white and free fatty acids present in the oil paint, have been widely cited as a cause of adhesion loss between successive applications of oil paints based on zinc white, as in the case of Olive Trees. Crystalline zinc soaps have been found at the interface between the delaminating paint layers in various paintings based on zinc white. See for example L. Raven, M. Bisschoff, M. Leeuwestein, M. Geldof, J.J. Hermans, M. Stols-Witlox, and K. Keune, âDelamination Due to Zinc Soap Formation in an Oil Painting by Piet Mondrian (1872â1944): Conservation Issues and Possible Implications for Treatment,â in Metal Soaps in Art: Conservation and Research, ed.

In footnote 8, the Nelson-Atkins painting is suggested to be the olive grove described in relation to this shipment.\n\nA collaborative research project, led by the Dallas Art Museum and Van Gogh Museum, to study all fifteen paintings that comprise the olive tree series is underway and may clarify the chronology and shipment dates of the entire series.

In some cases, the precipitation was carried out in the presence of a colored carrier so that the dye precipitate coats a particle of another pigment. In 1889 eosin lakes of several varieties were available, including some that were precipitated on red lead for their combined color. However, Van Gogh employed the âgeraniumâ lake whose color was solely that of its eosin content. Eosin was synthesized in 1871. See M.J. Depierre, âNote on the Application of Eosin,â American Chemist 6â7 (New York: C.F. & W. H. Chandler, 1875), 217.\n\nKathryn A.

Polarized light microscopy was used to screen for compounds not responsive to other tests and to correlate colors to the proportions of mixtures. Confirmatory pigment identifications were carried out with Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.\n\nEosin is a water-soluble, synthetic dye invented in 1871 and soon after adapted to painting use in the form of a âlakeâ pigment of which there were several varieties. The variety found in Olive Trees contains eosin bound to aluminum ions derived from an alum solution. See A. Baeyer, âUeber eine neue Klasse von Farbstoffen,â Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 4, no. 2 (1871): 555â58; M. J. Depierre,âNote on the Application of Eosin,â 217; A. H. Allen, Commercial Organic Analysis, 2nd ed., vol. 3, part 1 (Philadelphia: P. Blakiston, Son, 1889), 167â73. This âgeraniumâ lake can be markedly faded by light exposure, a detrimental trait already known when employed by Van Gogh. By 1900 its short-lived commercial success was already being referred to in the past tense. See F. H. Jennison, The Manufacture of Lake Pigments from Artificial Colours (London: Scott, Greenwood & Son; New York: Van Nostrand, 1900).\n\nSee the accompanying catalogue essay by Aimee Marcereau DeGalan.

The Galerie operated from ca. 1910/1911 until ca. 1929, during the time that Adolf Kohner is documented to have owned the painting.\n\n[7] According to PÃ©ter Molnos, the painting was exported from Budapest on October 8, 1930, and was likely sent to Paul Rosenberg in Paris.

According to Ilda FranÃ§ois, secretary to Elaine Rosenberg, Paul Rosenberg must have purchased the painting between June 1929 and November 1930; the exact purchase date is unknown. See also email from Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel et Cie., Paris, to Nicole Myers, NAMA, January 11, 2016, NAMA curatorial file. Durand-Ruel says that Rosenberg purchased the painting for 104,000 Pengos, which was the official Hungarian currency; therefore it is possible that Rosenberg purchased the painting directly from Kohner.\n\n[8] See email from Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel et Cie., Paris, to Nicole Myers, NAMA, January 11, 2016, NAMA curatorial file. Durand-Ruel erroneously records the purchase of the painting by the Kansas City Art Institute. Actually, the painting was sent on approval to NAMA from March 18, 1931 until its purchase in January 1932, where it was placed on view at the Kansas City Art Institute since the museum was not yet built. At this time, a petition spearheaded by local dealer Effie Seachrest (1869â1952) was signed by about 135 people encouraging the museum to purchase the work.
