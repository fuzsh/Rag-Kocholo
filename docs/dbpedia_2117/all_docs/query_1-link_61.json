        "text": "MARKUS SCHINWALD\n\nFebruary 14 – June 7 & September 11 – December 13, 2015\n\nCurator: Tessa Praun\n\nIn 2015, Magasin III has the pleasure of presenting the first major solo exhibition of the Austrian artist Markus Schinwald in Sweden. Through a wide range of interests that includes psychology, literature, dance and the history of fashion, he explores the idea of the human body as a cultural construct.\n\nIn the exhibition visitors encounter sculptures of curved table legs, distorted 19th century portraits, mannequins, and site-specific installations containing films without beginning or end.\n\nBy making small shifts in the familiar, Markus Schinwald has a unique ability to pinpoint certain aspects of our inner lives—desires, motivations, fears and inhibitions. For me, his art is a place where bodily memories are triggered, and where even the unpleasant or absurd can seduce and entertain. In our fast-paced world, where tensions only seem to mount, this exhibition provides an opportunity to reflect and to look at ourselves and others with greater openness and humility.\n\n– Tessa Praun, exhibition curator\n\nNew Productions\n\nIn particular focus are the major new productions Stage Complex (2015), created especially for the exhibition at Magasin III, and Actuator 1–6 (2015), a series of niches in which sculptures and turning gears create an idiosyncratic dance. Installed across from the red theater drapes of Curtain (2006), Actuator 1–6 acts as a lifesize cabinet of curiosities.\n\nStage Complex, which fills the entire lower floor of Magasin III, consists of six new films recorded in the artist’s studio in Vienna in January 2015. In the installation, the films are projected on custom-built walls that reconstruct certain details from the films. Solitary characters perform a series of movements: they climb, hide and open and close doors, cabinets, and drawers. These actions evolve into a kind of choreography that explores the possibilities and limitations of the human body. The installation also functions as a framework to display a selection of other individual works by the artist. In May, Stage Complex will expand with the help of a group of dancers from the Royal Swedish Ballet.\n\nSchinwald’s Gesamtkunstwerk treads a fine line between dysfunction and elegance, the terrifying and the seductive, where it is often unclear whether actions are driven by play or manipulation. The artist describes his work as a sort of introspective experience that tries to give form to our complex relationship with ourselves.\n\nA Unique Collaboration with the Royal Swedish Ballet\n\nIn May 2015, a unique collaboration between Magasin III and the Royal Swedish Ballet will be presented. The work Stage Complex (2015) will be activated by a choreography related to the installation’s physical possibilities. The choreography will be created by Markus Schinwald for and with modern dancers from the Royal Swedish Ballet. Schinwald’s practice includes a strong interest in dance and in the physical exploration of our constructed environment, and this has provided a key access point for this collaboration. Here, two art forms step outside of their familiar bounds and meet in a new context based on unique premises.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Ballet was established in 1773 and is one of the world’s oldest dance companies. Under the leadership of ballet director Johannes Öhman, the company has expanded to include some of the foremost modern dancers of today.\n\nMore information about this collaboration will be provided in a later press release.\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nMarkus Schinwald was born in 1973 in Salzburg, Austria, and lives and works in Vienna and New York. Schinwald represented Austria in the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011. Recent major solo exhibitions include the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts in San Francisco, jointly organized with SFMOMA; the M – Museum Leuven in Belgium (2014); CAPC musée d’art contemporain de Bordeaux (2013); Lentos Museum, Linz (2011); Kunsthaus Bregenz (2009); and Migros Museum, Zürich (2008). The exhibition is the artist’s first large-scale solo presentation in Sweden.\n\nExhibition Catalogue\n\nRead the exhibition catalogue here.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nJennifer Lindblad, Communications Manager\n\nlindblad@magasin3.com, +46 8 545 680 58\n\nwizz eyelashes\n\nKatharina Grosse, Sol LeWitt and Walter de Maria\n\nSeptember 19 – December 14, 2014\n\n& February 14 – June 7, 2015\n\nCurators: Richard Julin och Tessa Praun\n\nOur fall season opens at Nybroplan in central Stockholm with a new, monumental outdoor installation by Katharina Grosse. The work will be shown at Nybroplan September 18–21, and later moved to Frihamnen (the Free Port), where the Magasin III fall exhibition brings together works by Katharina Grosse, Sol LeWitt and Walter De Maria. All three artists have had major exhibitions at the museum since its beginning in 1987.\n\nThe exhibition wizz eyelashes is a play on both the history of art and Magasin III’s own exhibition history. Works by the conceptual minimalists Sol LeWitt and Walter De Maria have been installed alongside with Katharina Grosse’s expressive and abstract painting. All three artists have previously had solo exhibitions at Magasin III, where their work is now being brought together for the first time.\n\nSol LeWitt exhibited his first wall drawing in 1968, introducing an approach that would change the way we understand art today. At Magasin III in 2009 seven of his wall drawings were installed in the same room in which wizz eyelashes appears today. For the first time we are showing a wall drawing by LeWitt from our collection — a work drawn by five people full-time over a five week period this summer. The exhibition also includes two sculptures by LeWitt from the Magasin III collection.\n\nIn 1988 Walter De Maria was the first artist ever to be featured in a solo exhibition at Magasin III. Now, twenty-six years later, we are once again showing Large Rod Series: Circle/Rectangle 13 in the same place in the same room as it first appeared in 1988.\n\nTen years ago Katharina Grosse painted directly onto the walls, ceilings and floors of Magasin III, transforming the exhibition space into a painting that visitors could enter and within which they could move. In wizz eyelashes we are showing two of the paintings on canvas that were part of Grosse’s 2004 exhibition. Based on images of part of the large site-specific painting created directly on our walls and floor, she has created a completely new installation of printed fabric that hangs where the original used to be, now hidden under many years of layers of wall paint. In collaboration with Grosse we have chosen to let her new work act like a kind of backdrop for De Maria’s work.\n\nKatharina Grosse –\n\nin Nybroplan and Magasin 6\n\nKatharina Grosse has created a new and monumental installation for Magasin III – an expressive and abstract painting in the form of six enormous spheres. The installation is first on view at Nybroplan (Sept 18–21, 2014) and then in Magasin 6 (Sept 25-Dec 14, 2014), an industrial storage space in the Free Port (Frihamnen), a 7 minute walk from the museum.\n\nNew name and website\n\nWe are now Magasin III Museum & Foundation for Contemporary Art. The time has come for our name to better reflect what we do. As the collection has continued to grow in scope and significance, it has become clear that a key part of our focus should be creating exhibitions that allow us to look back over our history and use it as a reference point for understanding where the visual arts are today. Nothing better illustrates this than our fall exhibition ’wizz eyelashes’, that presents artists that have fascinated our institution since the beginning.\n\n– David Neuman, Museum Director\n\nFor press inquiries please contact:\n\nLisa Boström, Communications Manager\n\nbostrom@magasin3.com, + 46 8 545 680 58\n\nThis fall, we are changing our visual identity and our name to Magasin III Museum & Foundation for Contemporary Art. The ‘3’ becomes ‘III’ in a typeface with a venerable lineage but designed today. It is a tribute to the original signage on the former warehouse we have called home since opening in 1987.\n\nWe have kept our name, but amended it to better describe what we do. Our core mission and role remain the same; it is the content that constantly changes. We were founded to fill a gap. The public gained an exciting, private art platform that has offered Stockholm the very best of contemporary art.\n\nWe believe in art’s ability to challenge and inspire people and society. That is why we have supported the arts since our inception, providing exhibiting artists with the opportunity to produce new, unique works. Then, as now, we invite you to experience the commitment, ambition and creativity of internationally established artists from around the world.\n\nToday, Magasin III is one of Europe’s leading institutions for contemporary art and our exhibitions are at the core of our ever-growing collection—artwork that we have been loaning to museums around the world for more than 20 years. Our new look better fits who we are — our role and our commitment.\n\n– David Neuman, Museum Director\n\nThe new graphic identity is a collaboration with Acne Advertising.\n\nI’M STILL HERE\n\nFebruary 15 – June 8, 2014\n\nCurators: Richard Julin and Tessa Praun\n\nErik Aalto, John Bock, Christian Boltanski, Tom Friedman, Oscar Guermouche, David Hammons, Sofia Hultén, Aernout Mik, MoonspoonSaloon, Lars Nilsson, Pipilotti Rist, Lara Schnitger, Santiago Sierra, Laurie Simmons & Allan McCollum, Geraldine Swayne, Sam Taylor-Johnson, Andrea Zittel\n\nThe spring’s main exhibition, I’m Still Here, features artworks that draw out different aspects of what it means to be human. Mirroring the complexity of the human experience, the exhibition is a fragmentary compilation of character traits, behavioral patterns and impulses.\n\n“The title of the exhibition is like a poetic depiction of the human state. It marks a pause in the constant search for identity, and acts as a reassuring confirmation of one’s own existence.”\n\n–Richard Julin and Tessa Praun\n\nI’m Still Here presents sculpture, painting, photography, installations and film works by twenty Swedish and international artists from the Magasin 3 collection. Some of the works are being shown at Magasin 3 for the first time. The exhibition also sees the return of a number of artworks produced specifically for us, such as Pipilotti Rist’s monumental Tyngdkraft, var min vän, (Gravity, Be My Friend), and major works by Christian Boltanski, John Bock, Sofia Hultén and Lars Nilsson.\n\nTHE DRAWING ROOM\n\nFebruary 15 – June 8, 2014\n\nCurator: David Neuman\n\nMaya Attoun, Ann Böttcher, Mark Dion, Marcel van Eeden, Carl August Ehrensvärd, Kendell Geers, Jan Groth, Robert Guillot, Carl Hammoud, Carl Fredrik Hill, Bror Hjorth, Ernst Josephson, R.B. Kitaj, Alfred Leslie, Elias Martin, Bjarne Melgaard, Jockum Nordström, Tal R, Julie Roberts, Gil Shani, Johan Tobias Sergel, Amy Simon, Olle Skagerfors, Jacob Stangerup, Fredrik Söderberg, Keith Tyson, Alexandra Zuckerman, Christine Ödlund\n\nMagasin 3 presents some seventy drawings from its unique collection. Works on paper are often uncensored and seldom reworked—capturing the spontaneous and direct expression of the artist. The exhibition features a wide range of work dating from the mid-1800s to drawings completed just a few weeks ago. Visitors will have the opportunity to sit down in the exhibition space and contemplate the visual reality, just like in old-fashioned “drawing rooms.”\n\nFor more than twenty-five years, Magasin 3 has created exhibitions that present large-scale work by international artists for the first time. One could even venture to say that it has become something of our hallmark. The collection includes hundreds of works by some of the most interesting artists of our time. Parallel to the acquisition of large-scale works for which we are best known, the museum director David Neuman has also pursued a long-standing interest by systematically collecting works on paper.\n\n“The drawings collection at Magasin 3 has considerable breadth, not only because it spans almost 300 years, but also because it shows creation at its best. In my experience, the creative act exists beyond time and space. The questions, the observations, and the intensity of these works show with brutal clarity how mankind has forever been occupied with similar issues, which I find so liberating.”\n\n–David Neuman\n\nON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE\n\nJuly 1, Aug 8, Sep 13 – Dec 8, 2013\n\nPierre Bismuth, Tamara Henderson, Miranda July, Stina Nordenstam, Tino Sehgal, Dahn Vo\n\nCurators: Richard Julin and Tessa Praun\n\nOn the Tip of My Tongue is a series of events and unique projects as well as an exhibition in the traditional sense. It includes artworks that point away from the site of the exhibition itself, towards other virtual or parallel existences and experiences.\n\n”With this project we aim to trigger situations and experiences that linger as if “just out of reach,” to generate encounters that keep growing – in thought and through conversation – long after each initial encounter.”\n\n– Richard Julin and Tessa Praun, curators of the exhibition.\n\nOn the Tip of My Tongue occurs gradually with three opening dates. Through its own unique choreography, the exhibition extends temporally with events taking place in different locations, both virtually and sonically, indoors and outdoors.\n\nJuly 1st Miranda July’s project We Think Alone began. The project consists of emails that are sent out every Monday through the 11th of November. More than 95 000 people have signed up to the project so far.

None of these emails were originally intended to be read by me (much less you.) …Privacy, the art of it, is evolving.” (For full quote http://wethinkalone.com/about/\n\n– Miranda July\n\nMiranda July (USA) is a filmmaker, artist, and writer.

It includes artworks that point away from the site of the exhibition itself, towards other virtual or parallel existences and experiences. Its intention is to actively expand the structures that surround the usual exhibition situation, and deliberately work with the artworks included, so as to unfix or destabilize the categories of time and space. It aims to trigger situations and experiences that linger as if “just outside of reach”, to generate encounters that keeps growing – in thought and through conversation – long after each actual event has ended.\n\nCollaborators in We Think Alone:\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar is an American writer, filmmaker, and the NBA’s all-time leading scorer.\n\nLena Dunham is an American filmmaker, writer and actress.
