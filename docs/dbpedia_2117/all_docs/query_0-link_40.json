        "text": "Golden Boy Gustav Klimt. Inspired by Van Gogh, Rodin, Matisse…\n\nOn display from 7 October 2022 to 8 January 2023\n\nGustav Klimt is renowned throughout the world for his paintings that include gold and decorative ornaments, his universal symbolism and his pictures of strong women. But where did he seek inspiration?\n\nThe exhibition Golden Boy Gustav Klimt. Inspired by Van Gogh, Rodin, Matisse… offers visitors a remarkable opportunity to view Klimt’s art alongside work by the many artists who inspired him. The Van Gogh Museum is the first Dutch museum to organize such an extensive retrospective of Klimt’s work.\n\nThe exhibition features iconic masterpieces from all around the world, including Judith (1901), Emilie Flöge (1902) and Water Serpents II (1904). Golden Boy Gustav Klimt is a collaboration with the Belvedere in Vienna.\n\nThe Gasworks: Van Eeden & Van Gogh\n\nOn display from 16 September to 11 December 2022\n\nThe places where Vincent van Gogh lived and worked still inspire many artists. Marcel van Eeden (The Hague, 1965) is a good example. Van Gogh’s drawing Gasworks, made in The Hague in March 1882, inspired Van Eeden to create a new series of works, featuring striking charcoal drawings on canvas and a series of photographs.\n\nThrough his drawings, Van Eeden always reconstructs places and events from the time before he was born. The artist aims to communicate a certain moment in history. In this case, the day early in spring on which Van Gogh painted the gasworks on the outskirts of The Hague.\n\nVan Eeden feels strongly connected with the location: he was born in The Hague, and his apartment is around the corner from where the gasworks once stood.\n\nVan Gogh celebrates\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum turns 50 years old in 2023! On 2 June 1973, the museum first opened its doors on the Paulus Potterstraat in Amsterdam. The Van Gogh Museum has been inspiring countless devotees with the life and work of Vincent van Gogh and his contemporaries for 50 years and counting. There will be an anniversary celebration on 2 June 2023, with an unforgettable birthday party on Museumplein for visitors, friends and fans throughout the Netherlands.\n\nThe museum will also be travelling throughout the country together with the VriendenLoterij in search of the most inspiring person at a club, association, charity and/or in a group of friends. 50 winners and their organisations will be rewarded with a celebratory, inspirational Van Gogh experience on location. Everyone in the Netherlands can nominate someone at their club, community centre, society or nursing home. The three major exhibitions in 2023 will all be linked to the anniversary year.\n\nChoosing Vincent: From Family Inheritance to World-Famous Collection (working title)\n\nOn display from 10 February to 9 April 2023\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum marks its 50th jubilee in 2023, and kicks off this celebratory year with a tribute to the Van Gogh family. The museum simply would not have existed without the unconditional support that they offered Vincent.\n\nChoosing Vincent focuses on the personal story of doubt, setbacks, pride and triumph. A story punctuated with dilemmas, seen through the eyes of Vincent, Theo, Jo and Vincent Willem (‘The Engineer’). The many masterpieces and lesser-known gems in the exhibition reveal how what started as a family inheritance grew to become a world-famous collection.\n\nVan Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise. His Final Months (working title)\n\nOn display from 12 May to 3 September 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Van Gogh Museum and Musée d’Orsay in Paris are organising an exhibition about the period that Vincent van Gogh spent in the French village of Auvers-sur-Oise (20 May to 29 July 1890).\n\nVan Gogh was tremendously productive during this period and made several of his most renowned masterpieces then, including Wheatfield with Crows (1890). Featuring numerous loans from museums and private collections, this exhibition offers the first extensive overview of Van Gogh’s oeuvre from the final two months of his life.\n\nIt follows the artist from his arrival in Auvers, where he optimistically set to work in new surroundings and with fresh ambitions, to his last works, in which feelings of failure, loneliness and melancholy gained the upper hand. Despite these feelings, he continued to make enormously powerful works.\n\nVan Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise is a singular opportunity to see more than 50 paintings and 20 paintings and sketches by Vincent van Gogh that have never before been exhibited together.\n\nVan Gogh along the Seine (working title)\n\nOn display from 13 October 2023 to 14 January 2024\n\nVan Gogh along the Seine reveals how, the area close to the River Seine near Asnières was an important hub of artistic expression for artists working there between 1882 and 1890. Vincent van Gogh often painted in and around the village, as did his contemporaries Paul Signac, Georges Seurat, Emile Bernard and Charles Angrand.\n\nThe picturesque village to the north-west of Paris was popular amongst day trippers from the capital, who headed there to escape the heat and intensity of the city. Alongside the rural idyll, these avant-garde artists were also drawn to aspects of modern life such as train stations, bridges and factories that could also be found near Asnières – in an area that stretched from Pont de Neuilly to l’Île de la Grande Jatte and the Pont de Clichy.\n\nVan Gogh along the Seine is the first exhibition to focus on Asnières as a destination for painters, and explores why this location inspired Van Gogh and other artists in their search for a new, modern painting style. The exhibition is a collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago."
