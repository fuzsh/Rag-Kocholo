At the young age of 14 he started to work at the Royal Saxon Porcelain Manufactory in Meissen just outside of Dresden. In 1890, at only 16, he was admitted, as one of the youngest students ever, to the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden. Richard Müller was a shooting star of his time. He received numerous prices including a gold medal at the Paris Exposition and was appointed to a professorship at the Dresden Academy. There he was helping to establish the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement and was the teacher of Otto Dix and Georg Grosz. Müller's work has been largely forgotten, until relatively recently, because of his ambiguous role during the Nazi era. In 1933 he became a member of the Nazi party and president of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In the same year he supported Otto Dix's dismissal from the Academy. But only two years later Müller was excluded from the Nazi party and expelled from the Academy himself because of \"subversive tendencies\" in his art . After the war Müller remained in Dresden during the years of Communist rule and suffered for his supposed complicity with the Nazis. He was not allowed to exhibit his work and lived as an artistic and social outcast.\n\nThis fascinating portrait of a Dalmatian unites a masterly painting technique that approaches photo-realism with a deep psychological understanding that vibrantly brings to live the represented creature.\n\nThe Descent from the Cross by Torchlight\n\nEtching and drypoint\n\n1654\n\nPlate: 21 x 16,3 cm; Sheet: 21,9 x 17 cm\n\nThe New Hollstein (Hinterding/Rutgers) 286/I (of IV)\n\nWhite/Boon 83\n\nPrice: Please contact me\n\nPROVENANCE\n\nWilhelm Eduard Drugulin (1825 – Leipzig – 1879), Lugt 2612\n\nSotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, London, 11 June 1866, lot 1360\n\nDr. August Sträter (1810 – Aix-la-Chapelle – 1897), Lugt 787\n\nH.G.

The condition is impeccable.\n\nThe Descent from the Cross by Torchlight is one of Rembrandt's most dramatic prints. The\n\ncomposition is ingenious. The focus of attention is led not to the centre but to the upper left. The\n\nwhole movement of the scene starts there with the grisly detail of the nail through Christ's right\n\nfoot. A man is hammering it out of the foot to finally detach Christ from the cross. Next to him\n\nstands a man who holds the torch, the only source of light. Typically for Rembrandt he thought\n\nthrough in detail how the removal from the cross would work. Two men on a ladder are carefully\n\nlowering the large cloth in which Christ is wrapped. The man seen from behind is holding the\n\ncorpse and one can feel the full weight of the body he is bearing. An almost magically illuminated\n\nhand comes out of the gloom to the right, as another man comes to his assistance. The foreground is\n\ndominated by the bier, which is the destination for Christ's body and where the movement through\n\nthe composition initiated at the upper left will come to an end. One of the main characters, Joseph\n\nof Arimathea, who is draping the sheet, is in the shadow and can be seen only upon closer\n\nexamination.

He also built an extraordinary art collection of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objective) paintings.\n\nRichard Seewald, draughtsman, painter and illustrator, was born in Arnswalde on 4 May 1889. In 1909 Seewald began to study architecture at Munich Polytechnic (now Technical University) but soon turned to painting, in which he was self-taught. In 1911 he had his first exhibition at the Galerie Thannhauser in Munich. Seewald was a member of The \"New Secession\", which was founded in Munich in December that same year, and soon also joined the \"Deutscher Künstlerbund\". Seewald began to illustrate books such as \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"Penthesilea\" and his own first book, \"Tiere und Landschaften\". At the age of only thirty-five, Seewald was appointed to a teaching position at the Werkschule in Cologne in 1924.\n\nThe cultural and political changes that were taking place in Germany made Richard Seewald decide in 1931 to settle at Ronco sopra Ascona in Switzerland, where he joined the artist's group \"Der Große Bär\" and became a honorary citizen in 1939. A convert to Catholicism by that time, Richard Seewald received commissions for frescoes in churches and other ecclesiastical buildings. Seewald did not return to Germany until 1948 and was not reintegrated in the cultural life of his native country until 1954.\n\nAppointed professor at the Munich Fine Art Academy, Richard Seewald left four years later after differences of opinion with the board of governors. On his wife's death, Richard Seewald burnt about one hundred and fifty of his pictures as well as hundreds of sketches, designs and letters. In the late 1960s Seewald frescoed the arcades of the Munich Hofgarten and designed windows for the Herz-Jesu-Kirche [Church of the Sacred Heart] in Munich-Neuhausen among others. Richard Seewald died in Munich on 29 October 1976.\n\nThis is an exemplary work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement, which was a reaction against Expressionism. Our still-life is carefully composed and balanced in beautiful order. The everyday objects are depicted with calm precision. This is characteristic for the painters of the New Objectivity who intended to make visible the magic of the normal world as it presents itself to us when we really look at it. An edition of Dante's divine commedy which is prominently placed on the chair points to a meaning beyond the beautifully arranged objects in the present to a fantastic vision of the after-life.\n\nMassacre of the Innocents, after Peter Paul Rubens\n\nwith pencil inscription ‘eugène delacroix’ and ink number ‘503’ (verso)\n\ngraphite, point of the brush and brown ink, watermark figure on a globe with letters VDL, 23.2 x 32.2 cm\n\nPROVENANCE\n\nThe artist’s studio estate (L. 838a).\n\nUnidentified collector’s mark ‘C.R.’ (L. 630, twice).\n\nPrice: Please contact me\n\nThe present drawing, executed in Delacroix’s characteristic style and technique, was\n\ndrawn after an engraving by Paulus Pontius (1603-1658) which in turn depicts Rubens’\n\ncelebrated and monumental picture in the Alte Pinakothek Munich in reverse.\n\nThe painting shows the gruesome execution of all male infants in Bethlehem on King Herod’s\n\ncommend. Delacroix chose to zoom in on a group of women protecting their children,\n\nfocusing the viewer’s attention to the personal drama of these mothers. With controlled\n\nbrushwork and carefully applied pools of wash, Delacroix brings this exceptionally\n\nemotionally charged moment to life. He paid particular attention to the mother at top left,\n\nwho is worked up with carefully applied graphite. The infants shown at right furthermore\n\ndisplay Delacroix’s great skill with the brush; the particularly lose brushwork gives them an\n\nalmost calligraphic quality which brings the work of traditional Chinese art to mind. As is the\n\ncase with many other drawings by the artist after Rubens, Delacroix treated the original\n\ncomposition with some liberty; the infant at lower right, for example, appears at left of the\n\nmother holding an infant in the print by Pontius.\n\nTwo embracing putti\n\nOil on paper, 23,5 x 25,2 cm\n\nPrice: Please contact me\n\nPROVENANCE\n\nPrivate Collection, Paris\n\nI am grateful to Prof. Daniele Benati for confirming the attribution to Lorenzo Pasinelli based on high resolution images.\n\nLorenzo Pasinelli was a native of Bologna. There he studied under Simone Cantarini, one of Guido Reni’s most talented pupils and our family's name-giving ancestor. Cantarini had developed a more fluid, free manner in his later career, and his light brushwork would influence Pasinelli’s own expressive style. After Cantarini died in 1648, Pasinelli worked three years under Flaminio Torri before setting out alone, establishing his own successful workshop as one of Bologna’s leading masters. He subsequently worked in Mantua and Rome, and received prestigious international commissions from Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor (1640-1705) and Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein (1662-1712) among others.Pasinelli painted this refined and characteristic composition of two putti in monochrome oil. This technique played an important role in the artist's creative process and working methods. His monochromes were initially conceived as an intermediary stage in the creation of finished paintings. But as collectors and patrons were very interested in these studies, Pasinelli recognized their great commercial potential. So it is very well possible that our sheet was not intended as a preparatory sketch but as a highly attractive work for collectors.\n\nFruit still life with a basket on a silver plate with pears, peaches, grapes, chestnuts and a kendi\n\nOil on panel, 73 x 105 cm.\n\nSigned lower right: B van der Ast\n\nThis is a masterpiece by Balthasar van der Ast, one of the pioneers of the still life genre in the Netherlands. The signed fruit still life with quinces, grapes, medlars and walnuts is magnificently composed, masterfully painted and exceptionally well preserved. It is a real feast for the eyes. The prominently placed wicker basket is overflowing with an abundance of fruit, almost toppling over. The painting also conceals a secret. In the right-hand background is a mysterious, dark vessel. After a thorough research, it was finally possible to find out what it was: It is a kendi from Java, a traditional drinking vessel. Since ancient times, it has played an important role in the rituals of daily life in Indonesia. Its uses ranged from serving water or wine, to administering medicine to bedridden sick people, to being placed on altars at religious ceremonies to purify libations or to offer water as a symbol of purity. The kendi on the still life is evidence of the close trade relations with Southeast Asia in the 17th century, to which the Netherlands owed its immense wealth at that time. Only a few years before Balthasar van der Ast painted his still life with kendi in Delft, the Dutch had conquered Jakarta and soon all of Java. The artist was obviously fascinated by the exotic object and probably as unaware of its great importance within Indonesian culture as the traders of the Dutch East India Company, who had it shipped halfway around the world to sell it on at a great profit.\n\nPROVENANCE\n\nSale J.

His father, Hans, was a widower and when he died in 1609, Balthasar moved in with his older sister Maria, and his brother-in-law, the prominent Dutch painter Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder. He was trained by Bosschaert as a still life painter. In turn, the three sons of Ambrosius Bosschaert, Ambrosius the Younger, Johannes and Abraham were trained by van der Ast upon the death of their father. Together the group of painters is sometimes referred to as the Bosschaert dynasty.\n\nVan der Ast accompanied the Bosschaert family in their move in 1615 to Bergen op Zoom and in 1619 to Utrecht, where van der Ast entered the Utrecht Guild of St.Luke. Besides the Bosschaerts, his pupils were Anthony Claesz and Johannes Baers. It’s also likely that Jan Davidsz. de Heem was van der Ast’s pupil in Utrecht.\n\nVan der Ast remained in Utrecht until 1632, when he moved to Delft. In 1633 he married Margrieta Jans van Buijeren. They lived in a House at the `Oude Delft until his death in 1657, when he was buried in the famous Oude Kerk.\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER 1471 Nürnberg 1528\n\n“The Second Knot”.

Michel\n\nPrivate Collection, Germany\n\nThe second knot is from a series of prints known as The Six Knots. Albrecht Dürer created this series after a set of engravings which he assumed were by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). It was the only time that Dürer exactly copied a work by an other artist. He very probably saw it as a contest between the two geniuses south and north of the Alps. Of course Dürer wanted to surpass Leonardo and translated the delicate and complex composition into the much more difficult and coarse technique of the woodcut.\n\nThe present knot is an artistic tour de force and a celebration of the pure line. The interlaced lines create a self-contained system of perfect symmetry. For Dürer and other Renaissance artists the drawn line was a symbol for creativity and almost divine artistic virtuosity: „Nulla dies sine linea\" (Pliny the Elder).\n\nDürer's knots probably refer to Pliny's story of the contest between Apelles and Protogenes, the two legendary painters of the Greek antiquity: Once, Apelles visited Protogenes, who was not at home. Apelles painted a single fine line on a panel in his competitor's studio. When Protogenes returned and saw this line, he knew that Apelles visited him. He then drew an even finer line over the first one. When Apelles came again, he drew a third line, this time so exquisitely fine that no other could be drawn. Conceding defeat, Protogenes determined that the panel should remain as it was, to be admired for its artistic virtuosity.\n\nDürer did not include his monogram in the print, because he did not want to claim ownership of Leonardo's design. After Dürer's death the subsequent owner of the woodblock added the initials, which were likely printed from a separate small block.\n\nPRICE\n\nPlease contact me\n\nPrague School, circa 1600\n\nA satirical allegory on Emperor Rudolf II\n\nPen and ink, watercolour and gouache on paper with a watermark (eagle in a circle), 27 x 41 cm\n\nInscribed on the letter attached to the lance: Wir Rudolf (…)/zu allen zeiten (…)\n\nand on the letter held by the figure in the left: Moderare/Cunctis/in rebus\n\nPROVENANCE\n\nPrivate collection, Germany\n\nRepresented is a tournament of two bizarre combatants, cheered on by equally bizarre supporters. The weird knight on the left has a letter attached to his lance which is written by Emperor Rudolf II. He seems to be riding on an object resembling a treasure chest, out of which emerge arms and legs of a man. He has rammed his lance into his opponent. The latter fights back with a huge sword and rides on an empty barrel with a barking dog. From his torso emerge symbols of vice: snakes, bats, a witch and a dragon, dice and playing cards. The knight with the sword is also attacked by storks, a jay and a magpie originating from the imperial fighter. The foreground is crowded with fantastic creatures that seem inspired by Hieronymus Bosch. On the left a human-like figure with butterfly wings holds a sheet of paper with the motto Moderare/Cunctis/in rebus (moderate in all matters). The meaning of this large, allegorical drawing still remains to be deciphered.\n\nPRICE\n\nSold"
