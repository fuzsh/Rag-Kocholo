        "text": "According to the newest trend of natural history\n\n2020 | Various media. Performance / Video © Alex Thelen\n\nThe performance works like a kind of zoo visit. The visitors have free entry and can move freely and look at the figures acting here. There are three different categories of characters to be seen. The distinction may not be all that important. Their actions are sometimes deliberate, sometimes unintentional, but all end up being a work of art. They do their jobs here quietly and faithfully.\n\nThe three figures are:\n\nMonkeys:\n\nThe monkeys try to change the content and skin of the fruit. What they’re doing (whom we’d like to classify into our categories of social roles) is likely biotechnological research. But their actions are too simple, primitive and ritualistic for us to perceive them as research. You are interested in the surface and content of the fruit. The results of their work are rationally useless. We cannot eat or use the result of the work done. How can one interpret the result and the process of this work? If you try to classify this form of work, you may come to a comparison with artistic activity. Is this activity something very specific or something ambiguous? If unscientific and economically obviously inefficient and useless, this action could possibly be pure art? It is up to us to find an interpretation for this.\n\nThose with the identity of an artist:\n\nThey are neither animals nor humans, and their biological affiliation is unknown. We call them contemporary artists because they identify themselves as artists. Traditionally, civilized human society (not just because of the current corona crisis) has always been a difficult and dangerous environment for these pure self-appointed artists. The risk of catching a new type of virus and thus losing the basis of their existence has always been greater for artists than for others. That’s why today they decided to stay in protective clothing and masks. They habitually prefer to be alone in their personal space but still desperately want attention, and at best they want to extend their own existence through their work beyond their lifetime. Your work and communication style inevitably leads to physical distancing from others. They have always had their own artistic distance rules. I don’t think her life will be particularly different now. They would like to continue exploring and preserving the purity of art. They observe themselves and others with artistic curiosity and want to represent and communicate the world in their own way. Not digital.\n\nHuman nude model:\n\nThis person is essentially nothing, but as long as he exists in this world he cannot be nothing, so his existence is already contradicting itself. He doesn’t remember the consciousness when he started this life. He couldn’t even choose his gender, environment, or social status. So he is easily lost in helplessness. He decided to stay naked today because he came with a naked body when he was born in this world. So he tries to emerge here only as the idea of ​​nudity, as an act, as nothing else. But that inevitably creates feelings of pride, shame, pleasure and discomfort. the psyche and the physical body force him to move constantly. But he tries to embody an idea and a still image.\n\nCharacter introduction\n\nMonkey(Bio):He’s a special monkey. He is an environmentalist and a vegetarian. Loves plants and is lazy. His laziness is not a negative act. He is vigilant about this age of overconsumption. Therefore he practices doing nothing and not owning. Its active habitat is infinitely free, but it often spreads out and lies down and stays still. Its main activities are loungers, plant care and environmentally friendly interior decoration. Sometimes he helps mom and dad peel the fruit and change the contents.\n\nMonkey Couple (mom) and (dad): You are the mother and father of the monkeys. Their main activity is the rituals of fruit research. You cannot understand other beings who are not actively involved in this fruit study. Therefore, they force everyone to peel and change the contents of this fruit.\n\nWhen organic is somewhere, mom and dad go there and put the finished fruit on his body. (The body of Bio is used as a display table.) Bio lies for you for a while. Then at some point he gets up, shakes the finished fruits off his body and goes to his main tasks, plant management and the environmentally friendly interior.\n\nAlien: An alien being. It can be anything. When it first appeared, it was just a strange alien. It is interested in all the other characters. It is curious about the monkeys and mimics their actions. Mum and Dad give the alien a monkey mask and show him how to exchange fruit peels. Now and then it wanders around freely, tries to remove the “human face mask” from a human nude model, and also imitates humans. It goes to places where artists draw, picks up a picture and examines it closely. It even tries to get on the podium that artists are standing on. It can also go outside and to the audience. Its main role is to observe, imitate and walk around."
