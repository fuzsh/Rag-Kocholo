        "text": "Join us in congratulating Bobbi Essers on being honoured with the Royal Award for Dutch Modern Painting 2023 from HRH King Willem-Alexander.\n\nThe Royal Award for Modern Painting is the oldest art award in the Netherlands and, together with the Prix de Rome, the most important. The prize was established in 1871 as the Subsidy for Free Painting by King William III. The prize is awarded annually to three artists up to the age of 35. Bobbi is the youngest of the three artists to receive the prestigious accolade.\n\nBobbi’s work was recently presented via Voices for the artist’s online presentation, Rumour Has It.\n\nBobbi Essers (b.2000) was born in Enschede, Netherlands and currently lives and works in Groningen, Netherlands. After graduating in 2022 with a Fine Art degree from the HKU in Utrecht, she won the Buning Brongers Prize for Painting (Amsterdam) that same year. Inspired by youth and queer culture, where long nights are a must and sleeping is insignificant, Essers immortalises her cherished friendships in large-scale paintings. Challenging the perception of gender roles, Essers’ work demonstrates that gender and sexuality have no specific appearance."
