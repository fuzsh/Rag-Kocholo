There, she encountered simulations of the cosmos and demonstrations of interplanetary travel—thus igniting a passion for attempting to understand the vastness of the universe.\n\nDrawing upon Eastern European masters of landscape, she takes those techniques into interstellar landscapes—often imagining and inventing new environments.\n\n“As my viewers position themselves amongst the stars on these new planets, they reconcile the daunting and often hostile universe with their own human nature,” said Wölk.\n\nWölk’s multidisciplinary paintings—both rooted in romanticism and photorealism—take you on a journey to fictional planets full of interstellar dust, starscapes, flowing color, and light. Familiar images of popular images of space are subverted with gradients, digital alterations, and information gaps—creating an entirely new landscape of her own; it is a landscape that Wölk describes as a speculative future.\n\nSee more of Anne Wölk’s work on Discovery and read more about her paintings that challenge us to consider the world and universe that we collectively inhabit.\n\nAnne Wölk in her studio. Photo courtesy of Anne Wölk.\n\nHas your work changed over time—do you find yourself understanding your art career through different periods of expression?\n\nOf course, I have experienced many changes during my artistic journey.\n\nI have always loved Eastern European masters of landscape painting, next to subject matters that belong to the science-fiction genre. Over the years, I have incorporated my passion for traditional influences with my love for futuristic images during an evolving process. Maybe for that reason, I have worked on different series of paintings for many years, and there are always breaks and exciting connections.\n\nOne of the most compelling bodies of work was my Starscapes series, which comprises night landscapes with fascinating and mysterious light atmospheres. From time to time, I also regularly look at my older artworks and try to incorporate some successful concepts and implementations into my current practice.\n\nSpaceport Station by Anne Wölk\n\nDo you have a favorite or most satisfying part of your process?\n\nJoy is the focus of everything I do.\n\nFor that reason, I would answer spontaneously that I love the painting process.\n\nI like to immerse myself in the painterly execution of details in my landscape paintings. The depiction of light and stars’ colors in the cosmos excites me the most. It informs us about properties such as size, age, and distance. Next to it, I like color experiments when sprayed color surfaces, running traces of paint, and photorealistic elements stand next to and charge each other.\n\nEagle nebula (🦅 Adler Nebel) by Anne Wölk. Oil on Canvas, 31.5 x 31.5 in.\n\nWhat has your artistic education consisted of (formal or not)? If you did receive a formal education like an MFA, did you find it necessary for your artistic growth, or did you find that elsewhere?\n\nMy artistic training began quite early. I started studying at the Art Academy at Burg Giebichensteinwhen I was 17 in Ute Pleuger‘s class. There, I gained extensive knowledge of painting techniques, especially in the study of nature, design and composition theory, and color theory. In Pleuger’s painting class, contemporary conceptual abstract painting was taught. For this reason, I changed art schools to continue my studies in Berlin at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißensee, hoping to get some support in pursuing representational painting. I have also completed an exchange program at Chelsea College of Art and Design in the sculpture department. Over time, I have received several degrees like a BFA and MFA.\n\nGoing to art school was part of my artistic journey, but I have not learned there to grow a viable, profitable business in the arts.\n\nFor that reason, I would not recommend attending an MFA program to everybody— it depends on the personality of each art student. Success depends not on your technical capabilities or where you got your degree. All that´s required is a willingness to take personal responsibility to show up regularly in your studio and start promoting your art. The most crucial factor for an artist is taking action and making order out of the daily chaos to make informed decisions.\n\nAnne Wölk in her studio. Photo courtesy of Anne Wölk.\n\nWhich routines—art-making and administrative—are essential to success in your art career?\n\nSince 2019, I have started a new routine to bring order to my artistic production and studio. In recent years, I have become very professional and started archiving all my work and strictly controlling my money flow and finances.\n\nSince then, I’ve made many better-informed decisions because I can better understand which investments were worthwhile and which weren’t. It is also much clearer to see which galleries earn me an income and which only incur transport costs for me.\n\nHill Sphere by Anne Wölk. Oil and Acrylic on canvas, 19.3 x 19.3 in.\n\nWhy did you decide to inventory and archive your artworks?\n\nThe main reason [I began inventorying my artwork] was that I wanted to get an overview of which collectors and organizations had acquired works from me to date. I also tried to collect the contact details and wanted to understand my cash flow better.\n\nWhat advice would you give an emerging artist during this time?\n\nYoung artists should document all contacts and sales right from the start. I wish I had insisted on galleries telling me who bought my artwork more often. I have trusted that galleries regularly remind my collectors of me and advertise me and my exhibitions for many years, which was a fatal misconception.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nCICA Art Now 2021\n\nNovember 2021 Produced by CICA Press, Gimpo, Korea\n\nCICA Press, an online and print media issued by CICA Museum, is media for art and culture from the perspective of young culture makers in spirit. CICA Press supports â€œyoungâ€ culture makers, who have passion, critical thought, and desire for creative and experimental expression, regardless of their age and background. We have believed that our inexhaustible passion for art and expression and a reckless rebelliousness can change the world.\n\nCICA Press deals with visual art and culture from perspectives of local artists. To overcome uniform dissemination of contemporary art from the â€œcenter of Art,â€ we aim to introduce local artists and cultures from different regions to global audiences and connect them with each other. CICA Press provides online and offline spaces to create a global network among local artists, designers, audiences, and communities so they can make, appreciate, and live in art in their regions and cultures.\n\nCICA Art Now 2021 features artists from the CICA Contemporary Art Solo Show Series and CICA Young Korean Artists.\n\nExhibition Review by Shannon Permenter for CICA Press “CICA Art Now 2021”\n\nThe review was first published at All Indie Magazine (April 18 2021)\n\nimage: Solo Show (April 2021) “Questions for Heaven” at CICA Museum South Korea\n\nReview of Solo Exhibition\n\nTitle: “Questions for Heaven” Interstellar Displacement and the Entrancing Work of Anne Wölk\n\nSubheading: Anne Wölk’s recent solo exhibition illuminates our earthly relationships through an exploration into the mysteries and speculative realities of the universe.\n\nEnveloped in the rich blues of the vast universe and the outstretched arms of the galaxies, Berlin based artist Anne Wölk transports us through the nebulae to introduce us to an extraordinary foreign world that is eerily similar to our own. Her recent solo exhibition “Questions for Heaven”, on view in April 2021 at the Czong Institute for Contemporary Art (CICA) in South Korea, subverts the assumed familiarity with the astronomical through striking fictional landscapes that challenge the relationships between human and nature.\n\nWhen viewing “Questions for Heaven” you suddenly find yourself lost traversing the cosmos; a cohesive journey created through the precision, skill, and passion Wölk infuses into each individual work through her months of dedication. The exhibition, which consists of oil and acrylic pieces from three of Wölk’s most prominent series, explores the universe from its seemingly microscopic details to the vast regions that are beyond our mental grasp.\n\nThe viewer begins outstretched to the furthest expanses of the heavens. Works from her Nebulae series create textured, ethereal depictions of the gaseous cloudscapes. Wölk investigates these epicenters of cosmic creation with a gestural nature that transforms these formidable swirling masses into delicate whisps illuminated by the galaxies they embody. The viewer then ventures deeper as they are met with pieces from her Planet Spheres series. These three-dimensional works use acrylic paint on styrofoam spheres producing the sensation that the viewer has encountered this unknown world on their travels through space. The viewer journeys closer to this unfamiliar planet where they view the natural landscape collide against the cosmos. Lastly, the viewer finds themselves grounded in this mysterious world. Quiet mountain landscapes under endless starry skies are met with peculiar scientific architecture. These pieces from the Starscape series show life from the ground on these new planets. As we stare out into the darkness, Earth itself has become a microscopic element lost in the cosmic void.\n\nWölk brings these intergalactic scenes to life in an interdisciplinary manner that provides familiarity to the viewer. While an inherent painterly romanticism looms over each work it becomes clear that Wölk draws from astronomical photography, such as from the Hubble telescope, and imagery from science fiction that are prevalent throughout modern culture. She builds upon these elements by creating scenes that blur the line between fiction and reality to question the relationship between man and nature. The fictional settings she presents depict neon and LED lights that seem to illuminate the planet’s surface, as a community of space travelers colonizes the land. While immersed in the distant worlds of outer space a digital glow still hovers over the planet’s landscape confronting the viewer with the human need to conquer, develop, and brutalize new environments for their own pursuits highlighting the vulnerability of our home planet. While the viewer of the exhibition has seemingly traveled from the universe’s furthest limits, they are forced to question the interactions held here on Earth.\n\nLabyrinthine networks of stars, effervescent bursts of light, and the otherworldly landscapes have viewers embark on an extraterrestrial journey. For those who visit Anne Wölk’s “Questions for Heaven”, the selection of her works transports us from the comfort of our home on Earth, through the cosmos, and touch down on planets unknown. Wölk’s ability to provide intricate detail in tandem with seemingly immersive fields of color consumes the viewer generating a revelatory experience about the way humans inhabit our world.\n\nimage: Solo Show (April 2021) “Questions for Heaven” at CICA Museum South Korea\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nInterview with artist\n\nAnne Wölk — Arts Illustrated\n\nInterview Questions written by Charles W. Andrews (The Garden Gallery)\n\nArts Illustrated, LLC\n\n10 N. Hanover Street\n\nCarlisle PA 17013-3013\n\n717-249-1721http://www.thegardengallery.com\n\nwww.artsillustrated.com\n\nPosted on December 20, 2021 // Filed Under: Art.\n\nInterview with artist Anne Wölk\n\n1. Who are you and what do you do?\n\nMy name is Anne Wölk. I was born in 1982 and raised in former East Germany, in a city named Jena. I create figurative and landscape paintings using traditional methods and scientific imagery to depict a surreal galactic space and sketch a futuristic vision. My work is inspired by Romanticism and Utopia and stands in the tradition of realistic contemporary artists Vija Celmins and Russel Crotty. By layering content from these diverse sources, I create a fantastical interpretation of nature. Working on a finely nuanced palette of blue shades enables me to translate glow and shine into a visual language.\n\nHorsehead Nebula\n\n2. Why art?\n\nArt carries this paradox that it can make you dream of the unreal as well as give you a clear vision of reality. The galaxies, skies or surreal worlds I depict are supposed to bring a dream while contemplating a detailed reality. The planetarium in my hometown of Jena was one of the rare places where dreaming about travelling was allowed. By attending countless simulations of stellar skies in the planetarium, a place conceived as a walk-in celestial globe, I experienced the highly enveloping experience of an artificial starry sky at an early age. Art can generate the same experience. My enthusiasm for astronomy and space travel awoke at this place and continues in my work today.\n\nStone for Eternity\n\n3. What is your earliest memory of wanting to be an artist?\n\nBeing an artist was valued in my family and this came naturally as I was growing up, so my earliest memory goes back to when I was just a little girl. I did colour pencil drawings with my grandfather, who was excellent at drawing men’s heads. He was very knowledgeable about the East’s landscapes, with its birch trees and the Baltic region’s coastal formations. While living in East Germany, I regularly studied artworks from Polish landscape painters. I still love the paintings Moose Fighting with Wolves by Julian Fałat (1853–1929), The Old Town Square in Warsaw at Night 1892 by Józef Pankiewicz (1866–1940), and Courtship by Wacław Szymanowski (1859–1930).\n\nMagic Lights\n\n4. What are your favorite subject(s) and media(s)?\n\nMy paintings predominantly show night sky sceneries with deep and open galaxies. By quoting space telescope images and digital photography resources, I test the margins between art and reality. My depictions attempt to close the photographic information gaps, like digital error glitches. Simultaneously, I sample landscape compositions in a collage technique to envision a possible future. The aim is to present discoveries that the audience might have missed. For instance, I replace the deep light of the old masters with screen colours from backlit screen surfaces and attempt to carry the classic themes of the landscapes into the present and future.\n\nSecond Earth\n\n5. How do you work and approach your subject?\n\nI approach painting in a constructive way that aims to create atmospheres and universes. By working with the method of collaging and sampling, a reinvent the scientific reality and establish a vision for the future. In my studio I work with one assistant who helps me to put into practice more extensive projects and track of each piece’s progress. For more exceptional projects, sometimes friends help me with technical advice.\n\nSpace Experiment\n\n6. What are your favorite art work(s), artist(s)?\n\nSome of my favorite artists are Vija Celmins, Russel Crotty, Angela Bulloch, who inspire my work on an important level. Celmins’s East-European roots and aesthetics resonate with me and my way of seeing and sensing art, especially when focusing on astronomy. Many international futuristic and utopian novels influence my painting motifs and artistic research, such as Return from the Stars by Stanisław Lem and Roadside Picnic by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The artists of today are also a great source of inspiration. I have two drawings by my Dutch colleague, Witte Wartena, and four paintings from my dear friend, Mitja Ficko, from Slovenia.\n\nTripple Nebula\n\n7. What are the best responses you have had to your work?\n\nI would say when viewers are taken away by contemplation and nearly lose track of time. The colour spectrum of the light in my paintings aim to astonish viewers and take them away to a world of romance and silence. Just like a visual time-travel into another spatial reality.\n\nLe Voyage dans la Lune\n\n8. What do you like about your work?\n\nThat I can bring a new way of dreaming to the world and that sometimes I feel like a scientist working to discover new planets and interstellar elements. In my most recent work, I was inspired by Nebulae, interstellar clouds formed of dust, hydrogen, and helium. The paintings exploring this particular cloud will be featured in my next solo exhibition entitled “Momentum in Space”, at the Pantocrator Gallery in Berlin.\n\nDeep Sky\n\n9. What advice would you give to other artists?\n\nMy best advice is to be perseverant, to invest time, money, and effort into your career. It is also essential to travel and educate yourself. Putting yourself into situations to go out of your comfort zone and expose yourself to different cultures helps to realise how diverse the world truly is. Finally, having a website and sharing your art in the right places with the public is what gives life to your creations.\n\n10. Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?\n\nMy vision is to keep creating vibrant artworks with astonishing visions to spark joy and lead people into a dreamy contemplation. As a creative person, full of energy and love, sharing my passion with others feeds my heart. In 2019, my two-year goal was to produce enough consistent work to fill a new solo exhibition. This is now the case with my upcoming presentation at the Pantocrator Gallery. In my envisioned future, I want to take part in museum-quality shows in international institutions. On a larger scale, I hope my art brings beauty to the world and shows how magnificent nature is.\n\nPalm Valley\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\n\nAnne Wölk (1982, Jena/Germany) was born and raised in former East Germany. She is a figurative painter whose artistic work stands in the tradition of realistic contemporary artists Vija Celmins and Russel Crotty. Committed to an attitude of reskilling, Wölk uses traditional methods and materials. Her paintings predominantly show us night sky scenes with deep and open galaxies. By quoting Spacetelescope images and digital photography resources, Anne Wölk tests the margins between art and reality. In 2006, the young artist entered the international art world at the Contemporary Istanbul Art Fair, when the collector Can Elgiz bought one of her large-scale paintings for the Elgiz Museum of Contemporary Art in Istanbul. Her painting Doggirl was shown in several thematic group exhibitions next to famous artists Cindy Sherman, Tracy Emin, and Sarah Morris. After graduating from art school in 2009, the painter became known for beautiful large-scale landscape paintings and was selected and shortlisted for several international competitions and scholarships. Wölk currently lives and works in Berlin.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nAnne Wölks work is featured at the art blog and printed version of Goddessarts Magazine. The blog serves to get to know artists better and to give an honest account of the art journey, setbacks, success and experiences.\n\nmore info:\n\nhttps://www.goddessartsmag.com/…/shining-alien-suns-the…\n\nShining alien suns – The visual effects of lighting and atmosphere in deep space\n\nMany of my paintings show star landscapes with deep and open galaxies. I find my motives in astrophotography magazines and work with film stills as quotes from sciencefiction movies. In addition, I use recordings from the Hubble Space Telescope as the starting material for my spherical image compositions. In this sense, I am fascinated by imagery documenting observations of the sky, and I love painting a wide variety of light phenomena. Light plays a fundamental role in our thinking in the form of metaphors and images. To translate terms such as glow, sparkle or shine into a visual language, I use an unusual and finely nuanced palette of blue shades. The current series on celestial globes and star nebulae examines the depth of light in deep space. The untouched nature in the vastness of space is, at the same time, unseen nature and opens up scope for interpretation.\n\nMy paintings show the glow of the stars in the nightly darkness as a moment of calm. The colour spectrum of the light is intended to astonish the viewer and take him away toa world of romance and silence.\n\nI do not want to thematise the forlornness of the human being in the great expanse but try to ground the viewer’s gaze in detail. I want to create a visual experience that touches through sensuality and strangeness by exaggerating the pictorial representation.\n\nBy working with the method of collaging and sampling, I test the boundaries between art and reality.\n\nAs a teenager, I read science fiction novels, such as Return from the Stars by Stanisław Lem and Roadside Picnic by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Since then, I have read tons of science fiction novels with entirely different cultural backgrounds. For that reason, I assembled a vast collection of books, which I have built upon the two first novels.\n\nMy artistic work stands in the tradition of American artists Vija Celmins and Russel Crotty. Celmins’s East-European roots and aesthetics resonate with me and my way of seeing and sensing art, especially when focusing on astronomy.\n\nI think my interest in the concepts of travel, including space travel, has something to do with the cultural divide that existed before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It fascinates me to read about past generations of painters, architects, and writers in the former zone of Soviet influence and their limitations concerning travel.\n\nThe planetarium in my hometown of Jena was one of the rare places where dreaming about travelling (to the stars) was allowed and not restricted. The town’s main attractions were the simulations of stellar skies and demonstrations of planetary runs at360-degree shows. I attended countless performances in the planetarium during my childhood, a place conceived as a walk-in celestial globe. I experienced the highly enveloping experience of an artificial starry sky at an early age.\n\nMy enthusiasm for astronomy and space travel awoke at this place and continues in my work today.\n\nThe most significant question over the last 15 years of my career remains the same: How do I make a respectable living in a creative career that does not compromise personal values?\n\nThere are different types of artists, and depending on, for instance, the medium used, there may be drastically different production workflows.\n\nMy painting process is prolonged because of the many details I try to depict in the vast space. Sometimes it seems that it takes thousands of hours in the year to make my art. It always comes the moment when I get itchy that I will never get my painting finished. Many artists like me work long hours, seven days a week, and hardly ever take holidays.\n\nThe main problem is that artists believe – and are often taught – that their primary function is self-expression.\n\nToday, I know that art is a visual language, and its purpose is communication. My challenge is how to meet my needs for self-expression while remaining in contact with my audience and art collectors.\n\nEvery day I keep learning about my craft and painting skills because the better I understand them, the less time and effort I will have to expend to finish my next painting for you.\n\nAnne Wölk\n\nhttps://annewoelk.com\n\ncontact@annewoelk.de\n\nVISIT MY SINGULART PAGE:\n\nhttps://www.singulart.com/de/künstler/anne-wölk-20745\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n5 Minuten mit Anne Wölk – Singulart Magazin\n\nInterview geführt von Annika Nein am 5.8.2021\n\nInterview vom 05.08.2021\n\nAnne Wölk ist eine preisgekrönte Malerin und Zeichnerin aus Deutschland, deren Werke auf nationaler Ebene sowie in der Türkei, Österreich, den USA, Dänemark, Großbritannien, Taiwan, Spanien, China und Südkorea ausgestellt wurden. Ihre Kunst zeigt Sternlandschaften, die die Erforschung des Weltraums und die Suche nach Leben auf anderen Planeten repräsentieren. Wölks Motive sind inspiriert von Beobachtungen des Hubble-Weltraumteleskops und veranschaulichen extraterritoriale Ansichten. SINGULART hat mit der Künstlerin über ihre kreativen Einflüsse und derzeitigen Projekte gesprochen.\n\nWann wussten Sie, dass Sie Künstlerin werden wollen?\n\nAls ich 13 Jahre alt war, habe ich mit meiner Familie die Sommerausstellung auf der Kunsthochschule Burg Giebichenstein in Halle besucht. Ich fand die alte Burgruine mit Ihrem Rosengarten und den darin befindlichen Skulpturen so romantisch und schön, dass ich mir nichts anderes mehr vorstellen wollte, als an diesem Ort zu lernen und zu studieren. Wie jeder Teenager wollte ich Teil von etwas sein, was die Grenzen des Alltäglichen überwindet und die große Freiheit des persönlichen Ausdrucks bietet. Kunst war von da an immer ein Zufluchtsort, der verheißungsvoll und aufregend war. Mit 16 Jahren habe ich mich dann das erste Mal bei der Aufnahmeprüfung beworben und bin sofort aufgenommen worden.\n\nWürden Sie uns von Ihren künstlerischen Einflüssen erzählen, welche Künstler haben Sie inspiriert?\n\nDa ich an zwei deutschen und einer englischen Kunsthochschule studiert habe, bin ich mit vielen sehr unterschiedlichen Positionen in Berührung gekommen. Seitdem hat sich mein Weg zur selbstständigen Künstlerin Stück für Stück entfaltet. Rückblickend würde ich sagen, dass ich mich mit ebenso vielen Zeitgenossen beschäftigt habe, wie mit Kunstwerken alter Meister. Im Augenblick interessiert mich die künstlerische Arbeits- und Ausdrucksweise der lettisch-amerikanischen Fotorealistin Vija Celmins. Dabei fasziniert mich besonders Ihre Auswahl an Bildausschnitten und ihre langsame und genaue Arbeitsweise. Auch ich fühle mich am produktivsten im Moment der Entschleunigung.\n\nMögen Sie es lieber alleine oder in einer Kollaboration zu arbeiten?\n\nSeit ungefähr einem Jahr habe ich eine Mitarbeiterin im Atelier. Das ist ein sehr schönes Arbeiten, da sie mir hilft auch komplexere Werke vorzubereiten. In dieser Hinsicht komme ich regelmäßig in die Situation gemeinsam Ideen und Gedanken zur Umsetzung von Kunstwerken auszutauschen. Da meine Assistentin nur einmal die Woche kommt, genieße ich gleichzeitig die Möglichkeit zurückgezogen und introspektiv in meinem Atelier zu malen. Der Beruf des Künstlers ist mit ständigem Termindruck verbunden. Deshalb ist der Malprozess an sich so wichtig, da ich dabei zu vollkommener innerer Ruhe gelange.\n\nWürden Sie uns über Ihr derzeitiges Projekt erzählen – woran arbeiten Sie?\n\nIch arbeite gerade an einer Einzelpräsentation für den Artwalk Berlin. Ich werde die Schaufenster des Verdis auf der Schönwasser Allee 142 bespielen. In Kürze stelle ich dort einige neue bemalte (Planeten)Kugeln aus. Ich bin sehr dankbar für diese Einladung, besonders in Anbetracht des anhaltenden Lockdowns in Berlin. Der Artwalk ist ein Programmteil des Berliner Festivals Artspring, bei dem Künstler ihre Ateliers für Kunstinteressierte öffnen.\n\nWas würden Sie Ihrer Meinung nach tun, wenn Sie nicht Künstlerin geworden wären?\n\nIch wäre Altertumsforscherin geworden. Besonders liebe ich die Kulturen Mesopotamiens. Damit denke ich an die Sumerer, Akkader und Babylonier mit Ihren Vermächtnissen in Keilschrift. Mein Lieblingsthema sind die hängenden Gärten von Babylon. Dazu ist ein sehr spannendes Buch von Stephanie Dalley im Jahr 2013 geschrieben wurden. Dieses Sachbuch konnte ich für Monate nicht aus der Hand legen, da ich es so spannend und inspirierend fand.\n\nHaben Sie auf Singulart andere Künstler entdeckt, deren Kunst Sie schätzen oder gar bewundern?\n\nIch habe viele Künstlerkollegen wieder getroffen, die ich bereits aus Berlin kenne. Zum Beispiel Beate Köhne und Veronika Ban. Aber ich habe auch viele neue spannende Positionen gesehen, wie die zum Beispiel von Casey McKee, dessen Werke gerade mit mir in der SINGULART Sammlung: „Eine außerirdische Kollektion“ zu finden sind.\n\nWelchen Rat würden Sie jungen Künstlern geben, die gerade anfangen und versuchen Fuß zu fassen?\n\nIch würde raten zu versuchen bei sich zu bleiben. Es ist wichtig, dass man die künstlerische Stimme, die man hat kultiviert und nicht die, die man gerne haben würde. Damit meine ich: Bleibt Euch selber treu und vertraut auf die Menschen, die Eure Kunst mögen und Euch den Rücken stärken!\n\nVielen Dank für das Interview Anne!

Committed to an attitude of reskilling, this landscape painter uses traditional methods and materials.\n\nI develop my compositions from a perspective of observations of the sky and paints a wide variety of light phenomena. My painting process is an artistic translation of terms such as glow and shine into a visual language. For that reason, I work on an unusual and finely nuanced palette of blue shades. The colour spectrum of the light in her paintings astonishes viewers and takes them away to a world of romance and silence.\n\nIn this context, my subject matter speaks of the imagery of futuristic science and astronomy, which we have only become familiar with from the advances of satellites, cameras, and computer-generated images. By layering content from these diverse sources, I create a fantastical interpretation of nature, in which the simultaneity of Romanticism and Utopia becomes perceptible.\n\nWhat is your background?\n\nBeing an artist always had great value in my family. Even as a little girl, I did colour pencil drawings with my grandfather. He was incredibly good at drawing men’s heads. His family came originally from East Prussian Königsberg, modern-day Kaliningrad. He knew a lot about the East’s landscapes, with its birch trees and the Baltic region’s coastal formations. While living in East Germany, I regularly studied artworks from Polish landscape painters. I still love the paintings Moose Fighting with Wolves by Julian Fałat (1853–1929), The Old Town Square in Warsaw at Night 1892 by Józef Pankiewicz (1866–1940), and Courtship by Wacław Szymanowski (1859–1930).\n\nAt the age of 13, I visited an open house exhibition at the Burg Giebichenstein Art Academy in Halle for the first time in my life. I immediately fell in love with the old castle ruins and the rose garden in the middle of the castle courtyard. It appeared to me like an ivory tower in a kind of nutshell compared to a grey and often hectic urban world.\n\nAt that time, I already decided to study art. The moment I turned 16 years old, I tried to apply to art school and was immediately accepted into the painting class of Ute Pleuger.\n\nAfter three years of studying in this sheltered environment, I felt the need to see a little more of the art world. I moved to the University of Fine Arts Berlin-Weissensee and the Chelsea College of Fine Art and Design, London.\n\nIn 2006, I found my first gallery representation in Berlin and exhibited at my first Art Fair called Contemporary Istanbul. On this occasion, Can Elgiz purchased one of my large-scale paintings into the Elgiz Museum collection.\n\nFrom this point on, I expanded my exhibition activity at an international level, with various group shows in the USA, Great Britain, Spain, Denmark, Slovenia, Turkey, and many other countries.\n\nWhat does art mean to you?\n\nMy paintings predominantly show night sky sceneries with deep and open galaxies. By quoting space telescope images and digital photography resources, I test the margins between art and reality.\n\nWith my motives, I try to close the photographic information gaps, like digital error glitches. Simultaneously, I sample landscape compositions in a collage technique to envision a future that’s not here yet.\n\nFor me, the process of painting is nothing destructive anymore. Instead, I experience myself as a creator of atmospheres and universes.\n\nI understand the profession of a visual artist as something which brings new thinking and generosity to the world. Therefore I try to be someone who does human work that changes another life for the better.\n\nThat includes becoming an innovator in my artistic field of landscape painting. I wish to present discoveries that the audience might have missed. For instance, I replace the deep light of the old masters with screen colours from backlit screen surfaces and attempt to carry the classic themes of the landscapes into the present and future.\n\nWhat do you think art means to people in general? What is the importance of art in the world?\n\nIn my opinion, my paintings have value and bring joy to others. At the same time, I am convinced that my landscape pieces are not for everybody. That means my futuristic mountain scenes are for people who experience themselves as visionaries and future enthusiasts.\n\nMy clients often build lifelong relationships with works of art. Some of my collectors told me that my paintings are growing with their lives. Nevertheless, deeper layers of understanding are necessary. Why does buying contemporary art, in general, bring pleasure to collectors? Often, producing art means producing luxury items. I have to admit that not everybody in the world can afford art or needs art to live a good and satisfying life. Visual art is essential for artists and their like-minded peers.\n\nThe painting process helps me to calm down. Over the years, I have learned how to relax from the stressful outside world during the creation process.\n\nHow do you work?\n\nI work with one assistant in my studio. She helps me to realise and put into practice more extensive projects. Currently, I am planning to create 10 to 15 works of art in the future. With her help, I can confidently fill larger exhibition spaces, and my assistant helps me keep track of each piece’s progress. For more extraordinary projects, sometimes friends help me with technical advice. Recently, I was given a motor with which one moves disco balls. Thanks to my friend’s dedication and inventiveness, I can now set my planetary spheres in rotation in the exhibition room.\n\nWhere do you get your inspiration from?\n\nMany of my works show the world at night. People have felt touched by the magic of the stars at all times and in all cultures. My landscape motives represent an attempt to translate the longing to travel to the stars into the painting’s specific language.\n\nI am fascinated by science fiction stories about space travel and cyberspace. Involved in the society of digital culture, I alter film stills and photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope and integrate them into my compositions and personal painting cosmos. During my childhood, I saw a seemingly infinite number of simulations of stellar skies and demonstrations of planetary runs at 360-degree shows at the planetarium in my hometown of Jena. Jena was the centre for laser and optics technology in the former GDR. This formative experience continually influenced my fascination with science fiction and space travel. Picturing the future can be absorbing. Since the start of the technological age, science fiction has acted as a reflection of the public’s hopes and anxieties about the future.\n\nMy main interest is space travel and in the search for life on other planets and moons outside our solar system. As a child, I found the astronomers’ results extremely unsatisfying concerning the search for potentially habitable worlds in our universe. That’s why I became interested in science fiction novels: I had a deep longing for more.\n\nDuring the 1980s, scientists could not prove the existence of planets in other star systems. The first exoplanets were discovered as early as the 1980s, but at that time, they were either classified as brown dwarfs (HD 114762 b) or temporarily discarded due to the still-inadequate measurement accuracy.\n\nIn 1992, three planets outside the solar system orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257 + 12 could be confirmed.\n\nWhich artist or artwork inspires you most? (what kind of art do you have at your own home?)\n\nI live with two drawings by my Dutch colleague, Witte Wartena, and four paintings from my dear friend, Mitja Ficko, from Slovenia.\n\nName 3 artists you would like to be compared to\n\nVija Celmins, Russel Crotty, Angela Bulloch\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve in your art career?\n\nI am building my art career with the vision of having a vibrant artwork production in my bright and beautiful artist studio. As a creative person, full of energy and love, I am sharing my passion with others to spark joy in their hearts. Using my art as a way of sharing values and beliefs with others feeds my heart. I aim to become a well-known professional artist and do the best work I can. In my envisioned future, I get regularly invited to take part in museum-quality shows in international institutions. Five international galleries represent my art and regularly sell my works at art fairs in Europe and the States.\n\nWhat do you like and dislike about the artworld?\n\nHumana Obscura\n\nYear 2021, Issue 2\n\nLit mag publishing art, poetry, and short prose with a\n\nnature/environment theme.\n\nEditor-in-Chief: Bri Bruce\n\nFeatured Visual Artists: Katie Ryan, Vian Borchert, Marina Savashynskaya Dunbar, Liliana Martinez Saucedo, Jenny Siegel, Andy Hann, Kristin Indorato, Amy Aiken, Jocelyn Ulevicus, Emily Gillcrist, Sol Anzorena, Alessandra Abbruzzese, Lucie Van Der Elst, Neil Berkowitz, Azlinda Kamarudzaman, Anashrita Henckel, Camilla Taylor, Suwichada Busamrong Press, Ami J.

Wölk currently lives and works in Berlin. She is a figurative painter whose artistic work stands in the tradition of realistic contemporary artists Vija Celmins and Russel Crotty.\n\nhttps://www.altiba9.com/artist-interviews/anne-woelk-figurative-fiction-painter\n\nCommitted to an attitude of reskilling, Wölk uses traditional methods and materials. Her paintings predominantly show us night sky scenes with deep and open galaxies. By quoting Spacetelescope images and digital photography resources, Anne Wölk tests the margins between art and reality.\n\nParts of Wölk’s family came originally from East Prussian Königsberg, modern-day Kaliningrad. Through their cultural roots and characteristics, the artist sees herself as a wanderer between different worlds of Eastern and Western culture. During her childhood, she often came into contact with paintings by Baltic and Russian landscape painters.\n\nWith her ongoing exhibition activity in the USA and her extensive exchange of ideas with American artists, Wölk’s fantastical landscapes are characterized by a multicultural character and show German, Baltic, Russian, and American elements.\n\nIn 2006, the young artist entered the international art world at the Contemporary Istanbul Art Fair. The collector Can Elgiz bought one of her large-scale paintings for the Elgiz Museum of Contemporary Art in Istanbul. Her painting Doggirl was shown in several thematic group exhibitions next to famous artists Cindy Sherman, Tracy Emin, and Sarah Morris.\n\nLater on, Anne Wölk received an MFA from the School of Art and Design Berlin and was a BFA student at the Chelsea College of Art and Design in London.\n\nAfter graduating from art school in 2009, the painter became known for beautiful large-scale landscape paintings and was selected and shortlisted for several international competitions and scholarships.\n\nHer awards include the national Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes scholarship; the Alpine Fellowship grant at Aldourie Castle, Scotland, UK; a residency at Bodensee Art Fund; and an artist-in-residence grant in Goriska Brda, Slovenia, awarded by the German Embassy, Ljubljana. She has exhibited at international institutions, including the Elgiz Museum of Contemporary Art, Istanbul, Turkey; the CICA Art Museum South Korea; the Zeiss-Planetarium Berlin, Germany; the Accra Goethe-Institut Ghana; and the Kyrgyz National Museum of Fine Arts, Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republik.\n\nWölk has exhibited her work alongside artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Johannes Wohnseifer, Azade Köker, and Stephan Balkenhol. In 2011, she was selected for the Edition S 36 of DSV Kunst Kontor, Stuttgart. The Edition S 36 was a compilation of contemporary artworks, including paintings of Jonathan Meese and Tim Eitel.\n\nShe has exhibited and sold on the international art market, including the Swab Art Fair Barcelona in Spain; Viennafair in Vienna, Austria; KIAF Seoul in South Korea; and Contemporary Istanbul in Turkey.\n\nWölk has since shown her work in private gallery shows, including Galería Luis Adelantado, Valencia, Spain; Arebyte Gallery, London, UK; Galerie Wolfsen, Aalborg, Denmark; Pantocrator Gallery, Shanghai, China; Alfa Gallery Miami, USA; and The Residence Gallery, London, UK.\n\nIn October 2013, Anne Wölk won the Category Award for the ArtPrize competition ‘Art Takes Paris’, judged by directors from The Andy Warhol Museum in New York, Lisson Gallery, and the Marianne Boesky Gallery. In 2017, Wölk was announced as the Showcase Juried Winner in the painting category of the 9th Artslant Prize. Her painting ‘Virtual light’ was selected by a jury consisting of Natalia Zuluaga (Artistic Director of ArtCenter/ South Florida), Nathaniel Hitchcock (co-organizer of the Bass Museum of Art) and Malose Malahela (co-founder of Keleketa! Library). Two years later, the painter participated in the finalists’ exhibition of the art competition Art Revolution in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nHow would you define yourself as an artist?\n\nI predominantly create fantastical landscape sceneries, and I see myself as an artist rooted in painting. The surfaces I work on are canvases and Styrofoam. My passion for space and its exploration developed at a young age. My dream of traveling to faraway planets was nurtured by reading science fiction books and seeing simulations of stellar skies at 360-degree shows at the planetarium in my hometown, Jena.\n\nNowadays, I can say that the consumption of utopian novels and movies has strongly influenced my painting motifs and has shaped me as an artist. My recent artworks show extraterrestrial worlds and reflect on ideas about space colonization and terraforming. As a visual storyteller, I am fascinated by the search for life on other planets, and I try to convey my imaginations into figurative art. Inside the cosmos of painting, it is very simple to let fantasies come true. By creating starscapes, I share my desire for the intangible beauty of the universe with my audience and leave it as a gift. Sometimes that means refining the elusive sparkle of stars or depicting their infinitely deep glow with my brush, could be understood as a very personal implementation of my early childhood dream of traveling into space.\n\nWhat kind of education or training helped you develop your skillset?\n\nI started my education in the class of Ute Pleuger, a German conceptual painter with a focus on architecture. ‘What you see is what you see’ was the first quote I heard at art school from my professor. The statement was borrowed from the internationally renowned painter Frank Stellar and meant to convince young art students like me to follow the path of formalism and conceptual art. At that time, figurative art was banned and only accepted in the form of life drawing in undergraduate classes to develop composition skills. In these intellectual surroundings, I have learned that if I want to be a success as an artist, I have to accept that art only speaks to its audience with a clear conceptual idea. Execution in terms of the right choice of material comes second, and artistic skills like painting craftsmanship could be meaningful in the sense of understanding color and paint as material properties.\n\nI passed the entrance exam in the painting department at the Art College Burg Giebichstein one and a half years before I made my A-level exam in high school. I think it was the result of an early career decision. At the age of 15, I already knew that I wanted nothing but to become a painter. In my freshman year, I was the youngest student, and I was always afraid of mindset manipulation and guru techniques from the dominant teacher. In my view, artists listen to the inner voice that drives them to create. My inner voice is very critical, which helps me with designing and executing new and better artworks.\n\nFrom the beginning, I have received some scholarships and small awards, like the scholarship of the national Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes. Winning a scholarship was a stepping stone into the indispensable support system for artists. The money allowed me to travel and educate myself. It forced me to go out of my comfort zone and exposed me to different cultures, which helped me realize how diverse our world truly is.\n\nThree years living in Halle was enough for me, and I continued my studies in Berlin. I completed my education at the Academy of Art and Design in Berlin in 2009.\n\nIn Berlin, as a student of Katharina Grosse, I have enjoyed the purest idea of the painting process – the synchronicity of acting and thinking. In her class, I naturally came into contact with the concept that a painting can land on any surface. An Exchange semester in a sculpture class at Chelsea College of Art and Design in London had a powerful influence on me and guided my work in entirely new directions. In London, I gained a better understanding of volume and negative space.\n\nToday, I have learned a lot from the monochromatic night sky drawings of the American artist Vija Celmins. I find her quiet and precise work to be incredibly inspiring, deep, and complex. By studying her work, I have realized that what we don’t understand forces us to take a closer look. Although I have studied with professors from the western hemisphere, I still feel attracted to reskilling, discipline, and craftmanship. I see these strongly reflected in Celmin’s artistic approach.\n\nWhat experience in your life would you say is reflected in your works of art?\n\nI was born in 1982 in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on the edge of the zone of Soviet influence. Living in the shadow of the wall left only a few memories. Still, until today, I find myself enveloped in a cloud of disturbing and dark stories. My parents and grandparents cannot get over their psychological wounds caused by having their freedom restricted and being prevented from realizing their dreams. Their memories are in great contradiction to the mainstream narrative of living in the former GDR, which influenced my worldview.\n\nI often think of my mother, who is full of anger to this day whenever she talks about her experience when visiting family members in West Germany. The government did not allow her to take me with her to make sure she had a reason to return to the GDR. Her own country treated her like a criminal and gave her a constant feeling of vulnerability. That is why my mother taught me early on what it means to be free to travel wherever you want and what opportunities this freedom opens up. She always supported my efforts to pursue an international career.\n\nThe people of my parents’ generation had artworks, books, theatres, and movies to go to places in their heads. The planetarium in my hometown of Jena was rare, too, where dreaming about traveling (to the stars) was allowed and not restricted. The simulations of stellar skies and demonstrations of planetary runs were the town’s main attractions and an integral part of kindergarten and school trips. During my childhood, I saw an infinite number of shows about the history of our solar system. Jena was the city where the planetarium was invented by the engineer Walther Bauersfeld by the order of Carl Zeiss. My hometown was the center for laser and optics technology in the former GDR. Until 1990, the presentations were under the control of Soviet influence and were sometimes used as a vehicle for heroic Russian space race propaganda. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the planetarium’s presentations integrated more and more images depicting the viewers’ emotional intelligence. They focused on the wonder of our visible and currently known universe in their science program for children and young adults.\n\nIn the present time, inspired by these early experiences, I find my motifs by using photographs of telescopes. More precisely, that means that I translate photographic material from the Hubble Space Telescope and Europe’s CHEOPS satellite into paintings. The enthusiasm with which people search for life in space stimulates my studio work and is part of the underlying mood in my visual worlds.\n\nNocturnal landscapes, nature, architecture, and especially LED-lights are found in most of your work. Could you tell us about the symbology behind your interpretation?\n\nArt, in its purest sense, is an attempt to construct a parallel world with different horizons of opportunity. The focus of my artistic research is the process of recreation of reality. My working method is characterized by the employment of collage techniques and the layering of landscapes with juxtaposed objects and playing with light. In this sense, I try to bring forward a fantastical interpretation of the current and future possibilities of civilized environments grounded in scientific discoveries.\n\nThe motifs are inspired by telescopic observations and illustrate a world of extraterritorial views. My nocturnal landscapes combine pop-sci-fi visual references, such as space stations or LED light beams. The use of light is meant to carry properties similar to street lights from digital advertising and the eerie reality of our worlds being monitored and guided by forces larger than us. My paintings bring forth recurring questions: What will our habitation look like on other planets? Will we continue to embrace our technological advances in space? Will our future be a utopia or dystopia?\n\nArchitectural elements are included in my compositions when dealing with the futuristic designs of the Bauhaus-related VKhUTEMAS movement. In general, I adore the union of the artistic and technical vision of the Russian Avant-Garde. In 2015, a comprehensive and extensive exhibition was held at the Martin Gropius Bau in Berlin. I saw many detailed architectural drawings of future city ideas and space colonies next to the historical background information of Russian Avant-Garde Futurism.\n\nWhere did you get your inspiration from? What sources did you use?\n\nNext to historical art influences, many international futuristic and utopian novels have strongly influenced my painting motifs and artistic research. As a teenager, I have read science fiction novels such as Return from the Stars by Stanisław Lem and Roadside Picnic by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Since then, I have read tons of science fiction novels with completely different cultural backgrounds. For that reason, I have a vast collection of books, which I have built upon the two first novels I have mentioned previously.\n\nOne of my favorite novels, which addresses the main points of my subject matter, is Neuromancer (1984) by William Gibson. Gibson predicted cyberspace, which is structured similarly to our Internet. But in contrast to today’s flat monitor experience, cyberspace can be accessed as a location. The idea of traveling to the stars via augmented reality is of great interest to me in the same way as a structured space composition in paintings. I am currently reading Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky. The novel addresses the big themes of space colonization, gods, messiahs, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe search for life in space was, for a long time, science fiction. But the fast evolution of computer and lens technologies have allowed this to become a reality. Astronomers have discovered more than 2,500 other stars with planets orbiting them in the Milky Way galaxy. Our solar system is just one specific planetary system consisting of a star with planets orbiting around it. On January 6, 2020, NASA reported TOI 700 d, the first Earth-sized exoplanet in the TESS’s habitable zone. The exoplanet orbits the star TOI 700, 100 light-years away in the Dorado constellation.\n\nYour work explores futuristic science and technology, which we have only become familiar with from the advances of satellites and cameras, and in cinematography and computer-generated images. How do you progress from sketching your ideas to presenting a final project? What gives your work such a unique expression?\n\nNebulae, which are formed from interstellar clouds of dust, hydrogen, and helium, are a great source of inspiration for me. They are symbols of aesthetic contemplation – of pure and true beauty in nature. By quoting details from photographs made by a machine, like the Hubble Telescope, I experience a constant need to close the technical gaps of information in the machine-made image with something real, like material paint. In this sense, I develop my craft by layering photo-realistic details on top of a loosely abstract layer of flowing color. My painting motives are in a constant shift between abstraction and realism. I develop my composition from drawings and a vast collection of astronomical photography and film stills from science-fiction movies.\n\nWhat do you see as the strengths of your pieces, visually or conceptually?\n\nConceptual thinking and a commitment to painting craftsmanship are the main strengths of my artistic approach.\n\nMy artworks should get stuck in the head. By that, I mean, a painting has to be more than “only” technically perfect. It should own something special like an independent sole, that is difficult to put into words, but that only turns art into “art.” My motives are magical and somehow crazy in their way, like the landscapes in dreams and opposing associate terms such as bright and quiet, attractive, and a little scary.\n\nThrough my cultural roots, I experience myself as a part of two different worlds, having both Eastern and Western cultural influences. My recent body of work is the culmination of a long year of search for my painting language. During my childhood, I often came into contact with paintings by East-European and Russian landscape painters. My grandfather was the first person to promote my interest in drawing. He taught me basic rules for studying nature and understanding proportions. He came from the East-Prussian Königsberg, modern-day Kaliningrad. After World War II, he was banned from his home city for his lifetime. He spoke Russian fluently and told endless stories about Kaliningrad and the great displacement. I remember him as an ambitious draftsman. During my early childhood, he influenced me with his drawings and portraits full of Baltic Romanticism and melancholy. His Refugee Traumata still influences the cosmos of my paintings. Although I belong to a different time and generation, the Baltic melancholy has inscribed itself into my artworks, like a different melody.\n\nIs there a piece you consider a ‘breakthrough’ in your work, in terms of approach or subject matter?\n\nMy painting Doggirl (2006) was the first artwork of mine that was purchased by a museum. At that time, it represented a kind of breakthrough for me. I took my first steps into the international art world. A Berlin-based gallery showed two of my artworks at the Contemporary Istanbul Art Fair. On this occasion, the collector Can Elgiz bought one of my large scale paintings for the Elgiz Museum of Contemporary Art in Istanbul. It was one of these rare lucky moments during an artist’s career. It happened when I was a completely unknown 24-year-old student from a little-recognized East German art college with no degree at the time. The purchased painting was shown in several thematic group exhibitions next to artwork by famous artists Cindy Sherman, Tracey Emin, and Sarah Morris. Later on, a museum assistant told me that the museum staff and curator simply liked the artwork’s figuration and paint handling. That was the main reason they had included it in various art shows.\n\nAnother important artwork for me was my first 3-dimensional painting on a styrofoam sphere in 2019. It is titled Second Earth and was first shown last year at my solo show Astral, at tête gallery space in Berlin. The work is a 40cm styrofoam sphere coated in a galaxy of acrylic paints. The cool blue palette presents a mountain-scape paired with a deep night sky above. Reminiscent of a snow globe, Second Earth offers an icy view of a melancholic landscape and refers to the theme’ life beyond earth,’ showing a territory many light-years away. It is conceptually inspired by scientific investigations of new colonies on life-friendly planets. It addresses the power structure of who will have access to a potential planet B. The sphere was just the beginning of a new artwork series consisting of seven spheres, referring to a planetary system.\n\nHow do you see the project evolving in the next five years? Are you excited or scared of the future?\n\nHonestly, right now, I am more scared than optimistic. In the mid-2020, the art community still finds itself in an exceptional and very unusual situation. I see and hear about the ongoing collapse of the gallery system and nonprofit institutions. Endless journalists, curators, and gallery owners play mandatory roles as the so-called support system of artists. I pray every day that as many people as possible survive this crisis.\n\nFor my future, I hope I can become even closer to my work. Fewer distractions by cultural events can probably lend to a more focused time in my studio. As we artists adjust to the new normal, we are all finding alternate ways to make the most of our time. Nevertheless, I prefer to work on concrete projects than focus on potential opportunities.\n\nI am very excited about my next project, which is the creation of a series of painted styrofoam spheres. The idea was born in 2019 with my artwork Second Earth. It started as an experiment and will expand into a site-specific installation consisting of seven pieces. The spheres should represent a planet system and bring forth a body of work that grew from exploring territories of potential utopia in outer space. The three-dimensional paintings refer to possibly habitable exoplanets in the red dwarf system of TRAPPIST-1. The star TRAPPIST–1 was first discovered in 1999 by astronomer John Gizis. Since then, astronomers found out that the system has seven planets. Three of these planets are in the theoretical ‘habitable zone,’ the area around a star where rocky planets are most likely to hold liquid water.\n\nOver the years, I have learned that time management and a long-term strategy is essential for a sustainable art career. When I step back and look at the bigger picture, I can tell you that I’m working on a 6-month, 2-year, and 5-year plan. My 6-month goal is to paint for my upcoming exhibition projects until the end of the year. That means that my two-year goal is to produce enough consistent work to fill a new solo exhibition. I am also planning the creation of a dome with canvas works included, but now, this seems to be more of a five-year project.\n\nAny shows, galleries, or publications where our readers can find your work?\n\nRaúl Alvaro from Pantocrator Gallery invited me to present some of my recent paintings at the Swab Art Fair 2020 in October. The Art Fair will be held online because of the coronavirus pandemic. The virtual tour will be online from 1 to October 15 on their homepage: https://swab.es\n\nOn November 13, my painting ‘Virtual Light‘ (2017) will be part of the Rotary Charity Auction in Munich. I am happy when the artwork finds its new home at an art collector’s house and, of course, when my art raises money to help other people.\n\nIn December, I am looking forward to my first solo exhibition at the Czong Institute for Contemporary Art (CICA Art Museum) in South Korea. The artworks of the show will be documented in the CICA Art Now 2020 publication, which will be released in January 2021.\n\nThere are many galleries and nonprofit art centers that try to help artists by organizing online events. I currently take part in several online exhibitions, such as Booth 07 at the Alfa Gallery (Miami, Florida, USA) and the Engravist Printmaking Bienal (Istanbul, Turkey). The ongoing support touches me for my galleries and the online engagement from my audience.\n\nYou can learn more about upcoming projects and new works on my Instagram and on my homepage.\n\nAnne, can I visit your studio?\n\nI would love for you to visit my studio. Feel free to drop me a line if you want to see new works, and I will show you my process in the workroom.\n\nAt the beginning of August, I will move into a bigger space in a different district in Berlin. It is located in a brand-new studio house for visual artists at Gehringstrasse 39 in Berlin Weissensee. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to paint in an affordable and substituted workspace. The studio belongs to The Studio Office of the Kulturwerk of the BBK. It allows me to develop my work further even in times of crisis as we are now experiencing the coronavirus pandemic. The Studio Office has made a long-term commitment to securing places for the artistic production of visual art in Berlin.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nby Michaela Richter,\n\n(Head of Communication and Public Program and\n\nCurator at Neuer Berliner Kunstverein – nbk)\n\nEnglish version:\n\nThe blue light that keeps us awake at night\n\nText by Michaela Richter, (Neuer Berliner Kunstverein) Head of Communication and Public Program, Curator\n\nIn 1336, the Italian poet and historian Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) wrote his letter, The Ascent of Mont Ventoux, and in doing so, for the first time, gave account of a mountain hike that was not a necessity but was based solely on the urge to “see this exceptionally high place.”1\n\nOn the threshold of modern times, Petrarch’s narrative documents a new kind of landscape experience, which is characterized by a sense of the world and attaches an integral value to the aesthetic of the natural—motifs that still involve a fascination with supposedly untouched regions of the world. Today, Petrarch, who is considered to be the founder of alpinism due to his undertaking, is succeeded by lines of mountain climbers on Mount Everest, a demonstration of sporting ambition, hunger for adventure or need for validity that borders on the absurd. At the same time, the images of the experience they are chasing have long since become ubiquitous; every PC has a range of pre-installed desktop backgrounds in which deserts, waterfalls and, last but not least, remote mountain regions shine in overwhelming splendour.\n\nAnne Wölk has taken on the special magic that emanates from this type of depiction and that especially has a “glow” emanating not only from the depiction’s impressiveness.\n\nRather, certain stylistic devices—efficacious colourfulness and lighting—are what give the feature an outstanding brilliance, making it appear even more desirable yet unreachable. In times of social media, such image manipulations are ubiquitous as filter functions, their existence is well known to contemporary viewers and their use is almost demanded—where photographs are less true than ever, they must at least be spectacular to survive in consumer society. Image competition in digital modernism is characterized by high-contrast staging sharpened in colour by the light of the screens, captivating us.\n\nIn the paintings of her body of work, Virtual Infinity (since 2017), Anne Wölk seizes the impetus of the virtual and uses specific painting techniques as well as narrative picture elements that create astonishment in the face of fantastic scenarios. The artist lets extremes meet: Impressively illuminated, attention-grabbing foregrounds—the jagged rocky landscapes of snow-capped mountain ranges, views of the earth’s surface—are presented simultaneously with the hypnotizing deep blue of space, where individual stars and entire nebulae sparkle.\n\nThe virtual infinity mentioned in the series’ title corresponds to the reality of the firmament—among other things, the artist uses images transmitted through the Hubble telescope for her pictures, which provide visually abstracted access to places that cannot be physically reached.\n\nWölk is not concerned with creating perfect illusionism, but rather with equipping her pictures with a certain atmosphere that responds to the radiance of digital realities. The artist is fascinated by science-fiction literature and its ability to have predicted our present in many aspects. In his pioneering neuromancer trilogy (1984–1988), William Gibson coined the term cyberspace, an immersive virtual parallel universe as it exists today in the form of the Internet. The idea came to him when he watched two children engrossed in a video game and got the impression that they not only wanted to control the game but wanted to be part of it. Against the background of the incipient ubiquity of personal computers, Gibson sensed that someday everyone would want to also live their lives in digital space: “Everyone is going to have one of these […] and everyone is going to want to live inside them.”2\n\nIn works such as Multiverse (2018) or Virtual Light (2017), Anne Wölk creates plateaus in light neon gradients that are reminiscent of computer game background images—visually appealing and yet vacuous, they invite you to dwell on the elements clearly arranged on top of them. In Wölk’s works, these in turn derive from an earthly and original living environment: Next to slender birch and pine trunks are simple shelters that look like remnants of a civilization that once aspired to the “cosmos”. While the mind first wanders into the distance based on an aesthetic inspired by game design—the pastel rainbow colour gradients, the promising starry sky in the background and the objects floating like dream symbols in the visual space—the emptiness and isolation that characterize the picture and its narrative content lend it a dystopian undertone.\n\nTime and again, Anne Wölk sets the majestic and contemplative character of her works alongside moments of irritation, thus referring the viewer to the longing for the beautiful appearance in and of itself. In the work Astral (2019), the mountain and natural landscape is intersected by a grid, as can be seen in virtual reality spaces when you reach the limits of digital simulation.\n\nThis is known, among other things, from the science-fiction series Star Trek, in which it adorns the “holodeck”, which can be used to enter any virtual world. Here, the ambivalence between the vastness of the universe and the limited access to it becomes clear in a special way—even on a spaceship like the USS Enterprise, which is supposed to explore unknown areas of space, some things can only be reached virtually.\n\nThe universes that Anne Wölk conjures up in her pictures are reminiscent of escapism, a thirst for discovery and dominance of technology—not just on an interstellar level. For example, in the impressive mountain landscapes in Milky Way (2018), Alpenglow I & II (2019), Scope and Vision (2019) or Day Break (2019), floodlights and coloured fluorescent tubes can be found, disturbing the idyll and at the same time artistically illuminating it. As foreign bodies, they refer to a reality in which everything has been conquered by humans and designed according to their taste—their beloved glow effect is carried everywhere. Above all, it serves to set an example, to mark meaningfulness and to call attention.\n\nAnne Wölk demonstrates in particular the attractiveness of coloured light, which makes the unique appear even more special—or that which has long been available or well-known but should still have a touch of uniqueness added. Last but not least, this effect is used by our virtual selves or avatars, those artificial personalities also described for the first time by science fiction, which represent a certain version of one’s self online. Among other things, they communicate what seems desirable to them and ensure the constant availability of captivating, well-staged images that leave their mark and remind us of the possibility of descending into other worlds. Wölk’s works allude to the need for authentic experiences that is kept alive here, as well as to the perpetuated desire to lose or distinguish oneself in the face of something bigger—be it on a mountain or on the Internet.\n\nDeutsche Fassung:\n\nDas blaue Licht, das uns nachts nicht schlafen lässt\n\n1336 verfasst der italienische Poet und Geschichtsschreiber\n\nFrancesco Petrarca seinen Brief Die Besteigung des Mont Ventoux\n\nund berichtet damit zum ersten Mal von einer Bergwanderung,\n\ndie nicht aus Notwendigkeit geschieht, sondern allein auf dem Drang\n\nbasiert, „diesen außergewöhnlich hohen Ort zu sehen.“1\n\nPetrarcas Erzählung dokumentiert an der Schwelle zur Neuzeit\n\neine neue Art der Landschaftserfahrung, die von Weltergriffenheit geprägt ist und der Ästhetik des Natürlichen einen eigenen Wert beimisst –\n\nMotive, die auch heute noch eine Faszination mit vermeintlich unberührten Weltgegenden nach sich ziehen. Auf Petrarca, der aufgrund seiner Unternehmung als Begründer des Alpinismus gilt, folgen heute Schlangen von Bergsteigerinnen auf dem Mount Everest, eine ans Absurde grenzende Demonstration von sportlichem Ehrgeiz, Erlebnishunger oder Geltungsbedürfnis. Zugleich sind die Bilder der Erfahrung, der sie hinterherjagen, längst allgegenwärtig geworden, auf jedem PC findet sich eine Palette vorinstallierter Desktophintergründe, in denen den Userinnen Wüsten, Wasserfälle und eben nicht zuletzt abgelegene Bergregionen in\n\nüberwältigender Pracht entgegenleuchten.\n\nAnne Wölk hat sich der speziellen Magie angenommen, die von\n\ndieser Art von Darstellungen ausgeht und die in besonderem Maße\n\nauf einem „Glow“ beruht, der nicht nur von der Eindrücklichkeit des Abgebildeten selbst ausgeht.\n\nVielmehr sind es bestimmte Stilmittel – eine wirkungsvolle Farbigkeit und Lichtsetzung – die dem Gezeigten einen herausragenden Glanz verleihen,\n\nes noch begehrlicher und zugleich unerreichbar erscheinen lassen. Als Filterfunktionen sind derartige Bildmanipulationen in Zeiten von Social Media allgegenwärtig, ihre Existenz ist heutigen Bildbetrachterinnen durchaus bewusst und ihr Einsatz wird nahezu eingefordert – wo Fotografien weniger als je zuvor wahrhaftig sind, haben sie wenigstens spektakulär zu sein, um in der Konsumgesellschaft zu bestehen. Die Bildkonkurrenz in der Digitalmoderne ist geprägt von kontrastreichen, durch das Licht der Screens in ihren Farben verschärften Inszenierungen, die uns in ihren Bann ziehen. In den Gemälden ihres Werkkomplexes Virtual Infinity (seit 2017) greift Anne Wölk den Impetus des Virtuellen auf und bedient sich dabei bestimmter malerischer Techniken sowie narrativer Bildelemente, die ein Staunen angesichts phantasmatischer Szenerien erzeugen. Die Künstlerin lässt Extreme aufeinandertreffen: Eindrucksvoll ausgeleuchtete, Aufmerksamkeit erregende Vordergründe – die schartigen Felslandschaften schneebedeckter Bergketten, Ansichten der Erdoberfläche – werden in Gleichzeitigkeit mit dem hypnotisierenden Tiefblau eines Alls präsentiert, aus dem einzelne Sterne ebenso wie ganze Weltraumnebel hervorfunkeln. Die im Titel der Serie benannte virtuelle Unendlichkeit findet ihre Entsprechung hier in der Wirklichkeit des Firmaments – die Künstlerin nutzt für ihre Bilder unter anderem durch das Hubble-Teleskop übermittelte Aufnahmen, die visuell abstrahiert Zugang zu Orten bieten, die körperlich nicht erreicht werden können. Es geht Wölk nicht darum, einen perfekten Illusionismus zu kreieren, sondern ihre Bilder mit einer bestimmten Atmosphäre auszustatten, die auf die Strahlkraft digitaler Realitäten rekurriert. Die Künstlerin ist fasziniert von Science-Fiction-Literatur und ihrer Fähigkeit, unsere Gegenwart in vielen ihrer Facetten vorausgesagt zu haben. In seiner wegweisenden Neuromancer-Trilogie (1984–1988) prägte William Gibson den Begriff des Cyberspace, eines immersiven virtuellen Paralleluniversums, wie es heute in Form des Internet existiert. Die Idee dazu kam ihm, als er zwei in einem Videospiel vertiefte Kinder beobachtete und den Eindruck gewann, dass diese das Spiel nicht nur steuern, sondern Teil von ihm werden wollten. Vor dem Hintergrund der beginnenden Allgegenwart von Personal Computern ahnte Gibson, dass alle irgendwann ihr Leben auch im digitalen Raum führen wollen würden: „Everyone is going to have one of these […] and everyone is going to want to live inside them.”2 In Arbeiten wie Multiverse (2018) oder Virtual Light (2017) kreiert Anne Wölk in lichten Neonfarbverläufen gehaltene Plateaus, die an die Bildhintergründe von Computerspielen erinnern – optisch ansprechend und zugleich Vakuum, laden sie dazu ein, sich den übersichtlich auf ihnen angeordneten Elementen zu widmen. Diese wiederum entstammen bei Wölk einer irdischen und ursprünglichen Lebenswelt: Neben schlanken Birken- und Kiefernstämmen finden sich einfache Unterstände, die wie Überbleibsel einer einst in den „Kosmos“ strebenden Zivilisation wirken. Während der Geist hier zunächst anhand einer vom Game-Design inspirierten Ästhetik – den pastelligen Regenbogenfarbverläufen, dem verheißungsvoll im Hintergrund leuchtenden Sternenhimmel und den wie Traumsymbolen im Bildraum schwebenden Objekten – in die Ferne schweift, verleihen die Leere und die Vereinzelung, die das Bild kennzeichnen, sowie sein erzählerischer Gehalt ihm schließlich einen dystopischen Unterton. Immer wieder stellt Anne Wölk dem majestätischen und kontemplativen Charakter ihrer Werke Irritationsmomente an die Seite und verweist die Betrachterinnen so auf die Sehnsucht nach dem schönen Schein selbst. Die Berg- und Naturlandschaft\n\nin der Arbeit Astral (2019) ist durchschnitten von einem Raster, wie es in Virtual-Reality-Räumen sichtbar wird, wenn man sich an die Grenzen der digitalen Simulation bewegt.\n\nBekannt ist es unter anderem aus der Science-Fiction-Serie Star Trek, in der es das „Holodeck“ ziert, mit dessen Hilfe beliebige virtuelle Welten betreten werden können. Hier wird auf besondere Art und Weise die Ambivalenz zwischen der Weite des Universums und der Begrenztheit des Zugriffes darauf deutlich – selbst auf einem Raumschiff wie der USS Enterprise,\n\ndas unbekannte Bereiche des Weltraums erkunden soll, bleibt manches nur virtuell erreichbar. Die Universen, die Anne Wölk in ihren Bildern beschwört, erinnern so gleichermaßen an Weltflucht, Entdeckerdrang und\n\nTechnikdominanz – nicht nur auf der Ebene des Interstellaren. So finden sich in den eindrucksvollen Gebirgslandschaften in Milky Way (2018), Alpenglow I & II (2019), Scope and Vision (2019) oder Day Break (2019)\n\nFlutlichter und farbige Leuchtstoffröhren, die die Idylle stören und zugleich kunstvoll illuminieren. Als Fremdkörper verweisen sie auf eine Realität, in der alles vom Menschen erobert ist und nach seinem Gusto gestaltet wird – der von ihm geliebte Glow-Effekt wird überall hingetragen. Er dient vor\n\nallem dazu, ein Zeichen zu setzen, Bedeutsamkeit zu markieren und Aufmerksamkeit zu beschwören.\n\nAnne Wölk demonstriert insbesondere die Attraktivität, die farbigem Licht zukommt und die das Einmalige noch besonderer erscheinen lässt – oder dem, was längst für viele verfügbar oder altbekannt ist, doch noch einen Hauch von Einzigartigkeit verleihen soll. Dieses Effekts bedienen sich nicht zuletzt unsere virtuellen Ichs oder Avatare, jene ebenfalls erstmals durch Science-Fiction beschriebenen künstlichen Persönlichkeiten, die online eine bestimmte Version eines Selbst repräsentieren. Sie teilen unter anderem mit, was ihnen erstrebenswert erscheint und sorgen für die ständige\n\nVerfügbarkeit fesselnder, bestens in Szene gesetzter Bilder, die ihre Spuren hinterlassen und an die Möglichkeit des eigenen Abtauchens in andere Welten erinnern. Wölks Werke spielen auf das hier wachgehaltene Bedürfnis nach authentischen Erfahrungen ebenso an wie auf das perpetuierte Verlangen, sich angesichts von etwas Größerem zu verlieren oder zu profilieren – egal ob auf dem Berg oder im Internet.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nArtqol, 30.08.2020\n\nAnne Wölk Explores Space Travel and Science Fiction\n\nLink to Article: https://www.artqol.com/post/anne-w%C3%B6lk-explores-space-travel-and-science-fiction\n\nAnne Wölk is fascinated by science fiction stories about space travel and cyberspace. Involved in the society of digital culture, the artist alters film stills, as well as photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope, and integrates them into her motifs and personal painting cosmos.\n\nIn 2004, Anne Wölk came to Berlin to study at the University of Fine Arts Berlin-Weissensee. As a student of Katharina Grosse, she enjoyed the purest idea of the painting process – the synchronicity of acting and thinking. Through her studies she naturally came into contact with multicultural artistic concepts.\n\nAfter graduating, Wölk decided to stay in Berlin to get involved in an international art community. “Early on, I felt drawn to the German capital for its reputation as a location for contemporary art, and I liked its gallery centers in Berlin-Mitte and Kreuzberg. Over the years, Berlin became more and more one of the world’s most sought-after art places. The cheap rents for flats and studios pushed the development of the city, as well. The thing I like most about Berlin is its unique Eastern European flair. The urban lifestyle has significantly influenced my artistic development and language.”\n\nSince living in Berlin-Mitte, Wölk attended an infinite number of exhibitions in private and public institutions, as well as in museums and art associations. The artworks she experienced there came from all over the world. “The opportunity to live in the center of the international art world has widened my horizon and influenced my way of thinking. Mainly, I love the diversity of the Berlin art scene, and I regularly do studio visits with friends, colleagues, and curators.”\n\nWölk’s work is influenced by German and Russia elements. “My Grandfather came from East Prussian Königsberg, modern-day Kaliningrad. After World War II, he was banned from his Home City for his entire lifetime. He spoke Russian fluently and told endless stories about Kaliningrad and the great displacement. I remember him as an ambitious draftsman. In early childhood, he affected me with his drawings and portraits, which were full of Baltic Romanticism and melancholy. During my childhood, I often came into contact with paintings by East European and Russian landscape painters. His Refugee Traumata still influences the cosmos of my paintings.\n\nAlthough I belong to a different time and generation, the Baltic melancholy has inscribed itself into my artworks, like a different melody.\n\nThrough my cultural roots, I experience myself as a part of two different worlds, having both Eastern and Western cultural influences.\n\nRussian elements and approaches were also included in my compositions when dealing with the futuristic designs of the Bauhaus-related VKhUTEMAS movement. In general, I adore the union of artistic and technical vision of the Russian Avant-Garde. In 2015, a comprehensive and extensive exhibition was held at the Martin Gropius Bau in Berlin. Next to the historical background information of Russian Avant-Garde Futurism, I saw many detailed architectural drawings of future city ideas and space colonies.\n\nNext to historical art influences, many international futuristic and utopian novels have strongly influenced my painting motifs and artistic research.\n\nAs a teenager, I have read science fiction novels, such as Return from the Stars by Stanisław Lem and Roadside Picnic by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky . Since then, I have read tons of science fiction novels with completely different cultural backgrounds. For that reason, I have a vast collection of books, which I have built upon the two first novels I have mentioned previously.”\n\n“It fascinates me to think about past generations of painters, architects, and writers in the former zone of Soviet influence and their limitations concerning traveling”\n\nWölk’s work is touching on the concepts of travel, including space travel, something that has deep roots in the cultural divide that existed before the fall of the Berlin wall.\n\n“It fascinates me to think about past generations of painters, architects, and writers in the former zone of Soviet influence and their limitations concerning traveling.\n\nThe planetarium in my hometown of Jena was one of the rare places where dreaming about traveling (to the stars) was allowed and not restricted. The simulations of stellar skies and demonstrations of planetary runs at 360-degree shows were the town’s main attractions and an integral part of kindergarten and school trips.\n\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall, there have been tons of novels, TV series, and movies that thematize the traumata, especially due to the travel restrictions, of the former GDR population. As products of pop culture, these themes are the substrate of different approaches and perceptions of the events.\n\nSome integrate pop comedy elements like the movie Goodbye, Lenin (2003) by Wolfgang Becker, or focus on aspects of collective traumata like the drama The Lives of Others (2006) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. It is a cultural substrate between Ostalgie and Stasi surveillance caused by GDR arbitrariness.\n\nI very often think of my mother, who is full of anger to this day when she talks about her experience visiting family members in West Germany. The government did not allow her to take me with her to make sure she had a reason to return to the GDR. Her own country treated her like a criminal and gave her a constant feeling of vulnerability. That is why my mother taught me early on what it means to be free to travel wherever you want and what opportunities this freedom opens up. She always supported my efforts to pursue an international career.\n\nIn addition, I would like to say that particularly Berlin has an immense history of painting, like Neue Sachlichkeit in early 1920. Nevertheless, modern-day influential contemporary art galleries and museum institutions show concept art and support sculptures and installations predominantly. I love figurative painting, and I never doubted its endless possibilities for future artist generations. Sometimes, it seems hard to find serious exhibition venues to show my work in Berlin. That is the main reason why I started to travel with my paintings to other countries and cultures to find like-minded artists and collectors for my narrative context.\n\nFor example, in the winter of 2006, I took my first steps in the art world when a Berlin-based gallery showed two of my artworks at the Contemporary Istanbul Art Fair. On this occasion, the collector Can Elgiz bought one of my large scale paintings for the Elgiz Museum of Contemporary Art in Istanbul. It was one of these rare lucky moments during an artist’s career. It happened when I was a completely unknown 24-year-old student from a little-recognized East German art college with no degree at the time. The purchased painting was shown in several thematic group exhibitions next to famous artists Cindy Sherman, Tracey Emin, and Sarah Morris. Later on, a museum assistant told me that the museum staff and curator simply liked the figuration and paint handling of the artwork. That was the main reason they had included it in various art shows.”\n\nThese days Wölk is busy preparing for her upcoming solo exhibition at the CICA Art Museum in South Korea which will open on December 2, 2020. Additionally, Pantocrator Gallery in Berlin, Germany, will present some of her recent paintings at Swab Art Fair in Barcelona, Spain, in early October 2020. She has ongoing projects including online exhibitions, such as the Engravist Printmaking Bienal in Istanbul, Turkey, and Booth 07, which is curated by Alfa Gallery in Miami, in Florida, US.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n@/neim/ Instagram\n\n/Anne Wölk/ August 11/ 2020\n\nAnne Wölk is a visual artist based in Berlin, who paint a fantastical interpretation of nature, where Romanticism and utopia are perceptible at the same time.\n\n“The trick is to become successful in doing what you love.“\n\n/neɪm/ :\n\nHello, Anne. Can you introduce yourself and what you do?\n\n/Anne/ :\n\nMy name is Anne Wölk, and I am a visual artist based in Berlin. I paint a fantastical interpretation of nature, in which Romanticism and utopia are perceptible at the same time. Most of my works refer to science fiction movies and novels.\n\nMy subject matter is driven by my fascination for outer space exploration and the search for life on other planets.\n\nNext to science fiction, I am also conceptually inspired by scientific investigations about new colonies on possible life-friendly planets. In this context, some of my works are intended to address the power structure of who will have access to a potential Planet B.\n\nThe utopia of the imagined alternative living ground brings up the question: What will our habitat look like on other planets?\n\nWhen you see my paintings for the first time in an exhibition, you can see that the motives are multilayered narrations that are comparable to cinematic sceneries. Involved in the society of digital culture, I am altering film stills and photographs of the Hubble Space Telescope into my motifs. Caused by its reference, my later artworks inevitably appear futuristic.\n\nIf you take a closer look at my paintings, you will discover detailed mountain landscapes with horizons of mesmerizing deep blue color, which might look like extraterrestrial terrain. Dreamlike artificial light floats in the picture space, leading into the emptiness of a virtual vacuum. It is an attempt to redefine the genre of landscape painting through the conceptional use of bright screen colors. During the painting process, I always try to reinvent myself as an artist and to break new ground.\n\nWe have read that you were affected by your grandfather’s drawings in early childhood, and you grew up obsessively drawing in little black books. Do you think that your creativity comes from your genes?\n\nThe origin and reason for becoming an artist represent, for me, an ongoing mysterious connection with the blurred past. Honestly, I think that creativity is more often stimulated by positive role models than determined solely by genes.\n\nMy grandfather came from Kaliningrad and could draw very well from his memory. After World War II, he was banned from his home city for the remainder of his life. As an ambitious draftsman, his portraits were full of baltic Romanticism and melancholy. He spoke with deep regret about the German guilt and the great displacement concerning Königsberg and its transformation into Kaliningrad.\n\nKönigsberg became a kind of a myth after 1945 and a so-called German Atlantis in the sense of a fabled, unreachable city. My grandfather’s life was, like the lives of most of his peers, characterised by violence. Born premature and out of wedlock, he was forced to fight his way up to survive. As a young adult, he became the welterweight champion of East Prussia and was later given the title of an army officer. He eventually ended up as a ‘responsible’ police officer in the GDR.\n\nI personally think that drawing was, for him, a type of therapy to calm down and to respond to his physical and psychological transitions caused by his traumas.\n\nWhen I visited him, we sketched and painted together in a room in his apartment. He looked at everything and commented critically; he occasionally corrected elements of my early humble attempts. He preferred to draw male heads, and I tried to imitate him. I can especially remember situations in which he found my way of drawing noses unacceptable and asked me to take a closer look.\n\nI think that looking at the details and at the underneath levels of things is an essential piece of advice for any artist. Until today, I keep a sketchbook with me, and I use it as a kind of diary and as an item to save and collect ideas for later paintings.\n\nSure, I believe everyone should follow what makes them happy. Did you always know what career you would like to have? How and when did you realize that you wanted nothing else but to become a painter & what was your creative path from the very beginning?\n\nAt the beginning of my development, I dealt a lot with Russian and Baltic landscape painting. I’ve always enjoyed drawing birch trees and have loved them for their cool and beautiful elegance. Next to that, I was eager to learn to do portraits, and I trained to draw as precisely as possible from memory. In terms of artistic background, I enjoyed drawing and painting since I was very young, and my family was supportive of my interest.\n\nAt the age of 14, I met my first real painter, who was a local artist with a degree from the Academy of Fine Arts Dresden. He was the founder of a small private art school, which was connected to a large work studio. It was not a classic school but rather a starting point for aspiring artist personalities. Very often, primitive feedback sessions developed into troubled talks about God in the world until late at night.\n\nDuring this time, I painted my first large scale artwork, which was later exhibited in a small gallery space at the ‘Haus of the Mauer’ in Jena.\n\nAfter a certain period, I had tons of drawings and paintings that included portraits of friends and family members, as well as forest landscapes.\n\nBy the way, at that time, I had already done some early starscapes, but I did not dare to put ‘space pictures’ in my portfolio.\n\nMy teacher always told me that the representation of saddles in the universe are tourist topics and are made by unemployed Russian propaganda painters.\n\nWith a ‘mindful’ selection of my early artworks, I passed the entrance exam in the painting department at the Art College Burg Giebichstein Halle one and a half years before I made my A-level exam in high school. I think it was the result of an early career decision.\n\nAt the age of 15, I already knew that I wanted nothing else but to become a painter, and I could not see any other future possibilities for me.\n\nDuring this time, I was also an active member of the Writers Corner of the Kassablanca Youth Club. We exchanged information about current trends in the German graffiti scene and spent a lot of time drawing styles and characters with Copic Markers inside our black books, another name for sketchbooks.\n\nHow the teenage girl from the countryside decided to choose education at the University of Fine Arts Berlin-Weissensee?\n\nWhen I applied to the University of Art and Design in Halle, I was particularly impressed by the romantic Ruine Castle on the main campus. I found the courtyard particularly beautiful, with its pavilion overgrown with roses. It was a shelter in the form of refuge for yearning souls that had little to do with the real world outside.\n\nYoung and naive, I had no idea what the Zeitgeist of Contemporary Art was and which teaching concept was actually happening in the painting class of the ‘castle.’\n\nI started my education in the class of Ute Pleuger, a Berlin-based conceptual painter with a focus on architecture. As a teacher, she embodied a cool, analytical, and intellectual mind. The German conceptual painter Beate Spalthoff was also teaching at that time in Halle, and she infected me with her enthusiasm for the painter Luc Tuymans. I studied his work for many years and wrote about one of his series in my written diploma thesis.\n\nEven today, I still enjoy looking at his paintings in exhibitions whenever I get the opportunity.\n\nHis unique approach of translating photography into a painted language fascinates me. Tuymans never paints on a picture for more than a day, and he puts all compositional elements in one layer of color, similar to the method of prima painting.\n\nUnlike him, I prefer a long process of adding thin color glazes layer by layer. It takes a long time and often lasts for several weeks or even months.\n\nThree years living in Halle and following the path of formalism and conceptual art were enough for me, and I decided to complete my education at the Academy of Art and Design in the capital of Germany. As a student of Katharina Grosse in Berlin, I have enjoyed being part of a group of international students from a variety of different artistic approaches and concepts. I have learned that color knows no boundaries and can connect different spaces inside and outside of exhibition space. I naturally encountered the concept that a painting can land on any two- or three-dimensional object.\n\nSuddenly, I was surrounded by international art deputies, and everything felt like the big wide world. During this time, we, as her students, took a two-week-long class trip with her to Japan and visited temples (like Ise Grand Shrine), museums, galleries, architects and artists, Kyoto, Tokyo, and the rural northern regions of Japan.\n\nThat sounds so inspiring! Am I right that you had the Erasmus exchange program at Chelsea College of Fine Art and Design (in London)? How would you compare these 2 experiences?\n\nThe Chelsea College of Art and Design was the partner school of the Kunsthochschule Berlin Weißensee, and I was able to do an exchange semester there without any problems. The art scene in London is much more international than in Germany, and the competition between graduates of the many art colleges is correspondingly tougher. Without a financial background, it is almost impossible to get a foothold in London.\n\nI studied at the sculptor class at Chelsea and met many international artists. Gerald Wilson invited me to study in his class; I learned many new aspects of negative forms and the impact of objects and their volume in space.\n\nAt that time, the British artist Rachel Whiteread had a comprehensive solo exhibition in London that we have visited with Gerald’s class. Whiteread’s installations deal with the investigation of cavities. For example, the artist reproduces the space under a table. In that way, Rachel Whiteread shows the displacement of the table legs in space as a negative footprint. Her sculptural work shows the difficulty that we have, when we think of space only as a thing, and not so much as airspace.\n\nI felt welcome everywhere in London and had several exhibitions there. As a student, I was enormously supported and brought together with professionals from the art world. I suspect it has to do with the fact that most international students at Chelsea College have to pay a lot of money to get their education. For the teaching artists, it feels natural to feel the obligation to connect the students with a high-quality and sensible network of galleries and museums.\n\nSpeaking of them, when did you have your very first exhibition?\n\nI had my first exhibition while studying painting at the Burg Giebichstein Halle. I won first place for painting at the 9th national state exhibition of Thuringia, Erfurt. The opening was the first month of my freshman year and was held at the University of Erfurt.\n\nAnd how old were you when your paintings were sold for the very first time? Did this sale boost your future career?\n\nA professor from the university in Erfu"
