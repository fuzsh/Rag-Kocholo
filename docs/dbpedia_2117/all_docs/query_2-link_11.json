        "text": "IN THE EVER-EXPANDING universe of art engaging technology, an encounter with light seems a no-brainer: an absolute in those histories that begin with Renaissance optics, reach a crescendo with the emergence of photography, and of late, dally with the light-emitting diode. The historical roll call of these developments—which typically includes Vermeer and Moholy-Nagy, Flavin, Turrell, and Holzer—stresses the role of light as a medium no less secure or self-evident than oil paint, clay, marble, or canvas. Less discussed, but no less important, is the oblique contribution light plays in the evaluation of works of art, a far more slippery proposition, it turns out, than treating light as a medium in and of itself.\n\nA diptych by Louise Lawler titled Equipment and Entrenchment, 1986, sets the stage for some thoughts to such ends. The left side of the piece—let’s call it the “Equipment” half of the equation—pictures a small stack of filing cabinets whose contents are announced by a slide carousel placed on top. On the right panel, workaday dual-projection screens stand at the ready in a classroom. Initially the diptych might seem a departure from Lawler’s usual photographic métier: Rather than picture works of art displayed like so many trophies in Park Avenue living rooms or crated up in storage gathering dust, here she has chosen to represent the equipment of representation itself—that is, the little-considered equipment of banal, photo-based technologies and their equally mundane archives. Equipment and Entrenchment, however, implicitly suggests that the collecting of art, its estimation and installation, is guided by its literal projection elsewhere; and that the move from projection to perception to valuation is a slippery slope. Setting the photographic panels side by side, Lawler mimes the structure of the dual slide projection, a pedagogical tool used by art historians to make claims for aesthetic judgment by means of comparison. It’s no accident that this teaching device finds its basis in the methodological underpinnings of art history and the totemic figure of Heinrich Wölfflin, who founded the comparative mode of analysis that rescued entire periods of art from aesthetic and historical obscurity.\n\nI was recently reminded of Lawler’s work, made nearly twenty years ago, because the medium it puts on display is about to go the way of the magic lantern. In September 2003, with little fanfare (or warning), the Eastman Kodak Company issued a press release that sent shudders through slide libraries, art-history lecture halls, and studio classes everywhere. The company announced its intent “to stop making and selling slide projectors” by June 2004. “In recent years, “ Kodak offered, “slide projectors have declined in usage, replaced by alternative projection technologies.” Even as the corporation ensured the continued production of a few select models and spoke to the projector’s “specialty applications in museums, planetariums, cinemas and educational institutions,” librarians and art historians were now forced to confront the inevitable: Even if many of them had already been gradually embracing the pixel, countless others now began scrambling to digitize their visual-resources collections.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the coming outmodedness of the slide carousel brings with it a host of logistical problems: How to convert the analog to binary code in short order? What do you do with all those slides? What kind of resolution is demanded of these images? Who owns the copyright to their use? How will libraries bankroll these changes, given the sorry economic state of both public and private universities? But the twilight of the slide projector also suggests larger questions about the workings of aesthetic perception relative to the currency and obsolescence of the technical media supporting it; and that issues concerning perception cannot transcend their sociotechnological contexts. Given its ubiquity in both studio and art-historical pedagogy, the modern slide projector, after all, has played more than a supporting role in the visual arts from its inception, however much its use has been obscured by the more spectacular machinations of the art world and its diverse institutions. Nevertheless, the passage of the slide projector into the annals of dead-media archaeology could not be more timely (or untimely, depending on one’s perspective on these matters) from the vantage point of contemporary art. Largely experienced through the mechanisms of the multichannel video installation, the projected image has been a staple in the gallery for more than a few seasons now; and its kinship with the lowly slide show has not gone unnoticed by artists, critics, and historians, who have of late invoked examples of “slide art” in proposing alternative media genealogies to the usual “official” narratives starting with Nam June Paik and his Sony Portapak. (The obvious art-historical antecedents to the current projection mania would be Dan Graham, Marcel Broodthaers, and Robert Smithson, all of whom, in their respective ways, took up the question of the archive in relation to media.) That this most rudimentary, if generally ignored, technology of projection is about to give up the ghost occasions some last words (if no homilies) at the moment of its expiration.\n\nEnter Jessica Bronson, a faculty member at CalArts in Valencia, best known for her video and moving-image installations. Bronson exhibits no fetish for slide projectors, but her recent work can tell us something about the off-stage role of light technologies in the apperception of the visual arts. In 2001, Bronson was one of six artists invited to participate in a program called Neuro, originating at the Center for Neuromorphic Systems Engineering (CNSE) at Caltech. The resulting work is called Perpetual Perceptual (about a rose), 2003, produced out of discussions with Caltech scientists Richard Anderson, Daniella Meeker, Shinsuke Shimojo, and Kelsie Weaver. Of course, collaborations between artists and scientists are nothing new; at least since Leonardo broke into the morgue, such partnerships have been legion (indeed, Bronson herself studied biochemistry as an undergraduate). Nonetheless, Bronson’s particular use of new light technology offers a sidelong perspective on media and perception within the larger field of art and technology. In fact, the logic of peripheral vision—and that which lies adjacent to what is directly illuminated—is central to both the concept and placement of the project.\n\nComposed of light sticks custom fabricated by Bill Bell and specially developed software, the series was first displayed in spring 2003 at the Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery on the campus of the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. As inert objects, mounted vertically in succession on a wall, the sticks are formally uninteresting, recalling the spare parts of some product from a Sharper Image catalogue. When switched on, however, they become something else entirely. Described in the publication for Neuro as “the result of programming a one-pixel-wide moving light sign with a series of words describing sensory responses to a rose,” Perpetual Perceptual (about a rose) “employs a phenomenon called retinal painting, whereby viewers are likely to see an image when they are not looking directly at its source.” The words and word fragments programmed into the work (“soft,” “sweet,” “velvety,” etc.) are intended to evoke the sensuous experience of perceiving a rose—or the concept of a rose—with each light stick appealing to one specific aspect of the sensorium (smell, touch, sight, taste).\n\nThe risks of producing a work on this theme are plenty. If Perpetual Perceptual (about a rose) projected such words unequivocally on a screen or wall—and with florid imagery no less—Bronson might well stand accused of sentimentality. But it is precisely because the rose is such an exhausted figure of romance that the artist is free to concentrate less on the flower than on the associative mechanisms around an encounter with it: Think of Gertrude Stein’s word play around the rose or Wittgenstein’s philosophical propositions on the flower as verbal models for Bronson’s visual investigations. Bronson likewise avoids clichés by virtue of her use of “retinal painting”: the sense that the words can only be read (that is, perceived) indirectly at best. Indeed, when the light sticks are turned on, they do not so much broadcast or transparently communicate a message as scatter or even vaporize words into thin air. The effect is not unlike seeing a blur out of the corner of one’s eye or catching a glimpse of something over one’s shoulder while moving through space. The words, in other words, register as more ambient than communicative, more transient than stable, evoking a swarm of associations rather than an unmediated response to a rose. The effect is reinscribed by the installation of the light sticks, which Bronson placed in a corridor peripheral to the main space of the gallery.\n\nIt’s in the sense that one can’t really look directly at each work—that one can’t read the words under the full spectrum of the light that produced these (literally) floating signifiers—that Bronson’s work inadvertently appeals to the same issues Equipment and Entrenchment raises, not to mention the implications stemming from the demise of the Kodak slide projector. One lesson drawn from all three examples is that raking light may prove more illuminating than the klieg-like glare of “light art”; that an indirect approach to the medium may reveal more about the perception of the visual arts than an unmediated, perhaps blinkered, confrontation with light itself. Perpetual Perceptual (about a rose), in short, asks us not only to look a little more closely. It asks us also to look a little more askance.\n\nPamela M.
