        "text": "Unveiling mankind’s psychological makeup lies at the heart of Kinsella’s practice. In his work, he breaks down the personality traits of his characters into distinct geometric units whose shape, colour and size define their individuality based on the Myers-Briggs personality test, anchoring his subjects in the essence of their psychological attributes. If the clean surface of his paintings may recall the Old Masters’ works, his aesthetic and methods are resolutely contemporary.\n\n“Kinsella identifies the influence of Lawren S. Harris, a leader in the formation of the Group of Seven and one of its best known artists who created a distinctive visual language inspired by the Canadian landscape. The influence of Harris’ stylized geometric approach to lakes, trees, skies and mountains, exploring the basic structures underlying the natural forms is truly evident in Kinsella’s artistic aesthetic, using colourful geometric forms to symbolize the archetypal elements of psychology and countenance. Kinsella’s visual language quotes the past within a contemporary practice demonstrating a depth and understanding of what has come before in order to question the world we live in today. Another influence from his past is the largest public collection of Henry Moore works… Much of the fascination with Moore stems from his abstracted forms encouraging ambiguities, multiple meanings and interpretations. We can’t help but see the impact of this immersion when looking at the organic, biomorphic forms found in Kinsella’s work. There is a similar ambiguity in the assemblages of forms in his portraits, allowing for interpretations that extend beyond the physical. An investigation of simplifying features into strange beautiful shapes, exploring the interiority and exteriority, are absolutely present.”\n\n– Melissa Smith, Curator, Art Gallery of Ontario\n\nJason Boyd Kinsella (b. 1969) is a Canadian artist currently based in Oslo, Norway, with a degree from Bishop’s University, Quebec, Canada (1993).\n\nAfter a 30 year hiatus, Kinsella began painting again in 2019 and since then his practice has evolved into a deep exploration of mankind’s psychological composition.\n\nHis recent solo exhibitions include Emotional Moonscapes, Perrotin, New York, USA (2024); Anatomy of the Radiant Mind, Unit, London, UK (2023) and The Impermanent State of Being, Perrotin, Paris (2022). Selected group exhibitions and international art fairs include Art Basel, Perrotin, Basel, Switzerland (2023); Art Tokyo, Unit, Tokyo, Japan (2023) and Playground of Geometry, Centre of International Contemporary Art Vancouver (CICA), Vancouver, Canada (2022).\n\nKinsella’s work is held in multiple prominent collections that include the Perez Art Museum, Miami, USA; Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, USA; Long Museum, Shanghai, China; Pizzuti Collection for the Colombus Museum, USA and Centre of International Contemporary Art Vancouver (CICA), Vancouver, Canada, among others."
