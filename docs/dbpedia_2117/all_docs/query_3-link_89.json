        "text": "As many of you know, my dear mom passed last year which was a crushing experience to say the least. And in December, I celebrated my 60th year around the sun. When I evaluate where I am and where I want to be, it is crystal clear that it is time for me to move back home to Seattle – to my roots, to my friends, and to my family.\n\nSo, after six and a half years, I have made the difficult choice to put Art Box on the market and make my transition north. This has not been an easy decision, but one that I know in my heart’s core that I need to make. I also like to look at it as an opportunity for someone or a group of someones to have a really cool and creative shop in magnificent O Town! I believe that Art Box has been and should continue to be a creative outlet in the Ogden community and beyond. I see it only growing stronger in the years to come.\n\nIf you or someone you know is interested in purchasing Art Box, please reach out to our broker Michael Hamilton at Murphy Business Sales (m.hamilton@murphybusiness.com) who can provide you with all the details.\n\nI will be forever grateful for this experience and to everyone who has ever stepped through our doors and touched our hearts. It has been a wild and wonderful ride! In the meantime, we are continuing business as usual and hope you can stop by soon.\n\nFebruary 1st & 15th | 7-9pm | $90\n\nWe are thrilled to be partnering with ceramicist Barb Crosbie of Make South Ogden for a fun two-part class!\n\nPart 1 - February 1st:\n\nIn this session, you will create your very own expressive god or goddess pot out of stoneware clay. Beginning from a form thrown by Barb, you will define the dimensions, features and mood of your pot! This class will take place at Make South Ogden, 5685 S 1475 E, Suite 1B, South Ogden, UT 84403 (801) 866-8279.\n\nPart 2 - February 15th:\n\nIn this session, you will create a captivating candle in your handmade pot. Select from themed t-lights, metal tokens and crystals to make a truly unique candle! This class will take place at Art Box Ogden, 455 25th Street, Ogden, UT 84401.\n\nCost is $90 per person and includes both workshops and all materials.\n\nFriday | November 3rd | 6-9pm\n\nWe are so happy to have the return of self-taught artist Laurie Harrower for First Friday Art Stroll and The Monarch's Open Studio Night.\n\nInspired by the textures, movement and color, Laurie just recently finished a series on the grasslands in and around Utah-a great love of hers. In this body of work, Laurie explores the dance between the abstracted idea, her intuition, and images she captures on her camera.\n\nLaurie will also be exhibiting some pure abstract pieces. She creates these with nature in mind and her intuitive feelings at the moment which brings her so much joy!\n\nPlease come meet Laurie and see her beautiful work!\n\nFriday | October 6th | 6-9pm\n\nArt Box is happy to feature Self-Mastery & Inner Child Expert, Divine Channel, and well-known writer and speaker Nikyla Maria for October's First Friday Art Stroll. Nikyla will be featuring her Inner Child Oracle Deck which, along with her classes and teachings, have been used all over the world.\n\nWith over 15 years experience in leadership, education and performance, Nikyla leads individuals into their next level using high-performance tools, master mindset strategies, and individualized mentorship. Nikyla is a mindset genius and has proven time and time again that her methods lead to increased productivity, expanded creativity, and a driven and disciplined mind.\n\nAside from her master’s degree in educational leadership, Nikyla is also a certified Master Healer, Trauma Trained IFS Expert, and Licensed Holistic Practitioner. She is a master of her craft and loves watching her clients and community open up to themselves and remember all that they are.\n\nFriday | May 5th | 6:00-9:00pm\n\nPatricia Smith is the owner of Hopever, a small business located in West Haven, Utah. Hopever is built on Patricia’s passion for details, nature and accomplishing dreams. Hopever is the union of Hope and Forever with the purpose of bringing joy to people through unique products. Hopever designs premium handmade products in Utah that are made in Peru. Each item is carefully designed with natural materials and ancestral and modern techniques, emphasizing vibrant colors resulting in positive emotions.\n\nHand-embroidery and weaving is an ancestral Peruvian art which dates to around 3,000 BC. Andean textiles combined with different native materials such as alpaca, sheep, mixed wool, and cotton were considered more valuable than gold and silver. The combination of handmade techniques, vibrant colors and natural materials was Patricia’s inspiration to start Hopever. She also wanted to become more self-reliant and plans to start a non-profit organization to help children obtain better opportunities in education.\n\nBorn and raised in Peru, Patricia moved to the United States in 2016. She earned a BA in International Business Administration in Peru and an MBA from the Peruvian University of Applied Sciences. In 2017, she studied at the ELC-BYU to enhance her English to gain more education and job opportunities. She is now an entrepreneur, a full-time mom, and a believer that dreams come true from continual efforts and perseverance. Her goal is to share hope, uniqueness and beauty with the world.\n\nFriday | March 3rd | 6:00-9:00pm\n\nArt Box is excited to be featuring the charming work of artist Tiffney Hassing for March's First Friday!\n\nTiffney has always enjoyed working with her hands. For many years, sewing was the means by which she expressed her creativity, selecting fabrics of many textures and pattern, then piecing them together into one coherent piece.\n\nShe then moved on to work with stained glass. With the many steps involved, Tiffney found this medium very challenging. In addition, there was the risk of cutting or burning herself!\n\nNow, Tiffney paints, and she loves it! With no sewing or soldering, she enjoys applying paint directly onto the intended surface and working with the paint until she gets it just right. Tiffney enjoys painting in a Folk Art style, with lots of dreamy colors, and interesting lines and shapes.\n\nWe hope you can join us to see Tiffney’s beautiful work in person!\n\nFriday | February 3rd | 6-9pm\n\nArt Box is happy to present self-taught artist Amy LeFevre for February’s First Friday Art Stroll. Amy is an Ogden native with a passion for the arts. After living in Fort Lauderdale for several years and working in the food and beverage industry, she found her way back to Ogden where she graduated from massage school and began working in the hotel industry in Park City.\n\nDuring the COVID shutdown in 2020, Amy was impassioned to pursue her dream of becoming a full-time artist and launched her website in October 2021. Since that time, she has built a presence in the Utah art community with her creative use of acrylic paints on a variety of materials, including canvas, paper and wood panels.\n\nAmy’s paintings are an expression of her emotions. Being creative helps her to find peace in the chaos, and makes her feel alive!\n\nFriday | November 4th | 6-9pm | Free\n\nJonny Tanner is an artist that focuses on color, intuition, and creating spiritual alignment through his work. Many call him the “Spirit Painter” after the process he has created, “Spirit Painting.” Jonny’s work centers on capturing the reality of the spiritual that surrounds us. Each stroke, with its color and shape, represents a different eternal message. His pieces are aimed towards bringing validation, clarity and enlightenment to anyone who takes the time to let the colors speak to their heart.\n\nJonny currently lives in Ogden with his wife, daughter, newborn son, and puppy. You will usually find Jonny at his in-home studio on the east bench, where he creates Spirit Paintings full time. Jonny, together with the help of his wife and business partner Lu, create retreats, events, and other experiences to further help others with their own spiritual alignment through color.\n\nCome meet Johnny and view his amazing colorful works in person!\n\nFriday | October 7th | 6-9pm | Free\n\nArt Box is so excited to have the return of self-taught artist Cathy Cartwright, but showcasing a new medium to Cathy – doll making. In her debut show entitled “The Sin Eater's Lament,” Cathy will be sharing the amazing and intricate work of her most-recent labor of love and understanding: Relics of Grief and Grace Dolls.\n\nFor the last 35 years, Cathy has experimented with glass, fiber and textiles. Each new exploration was a journey that brought her to places she didn't expect. Recently, as the pandemic raged on, Cathy knew that she needed to transform her personal loss, grief, longing, and fear – she could no longer sit with it, unattended and alone.\n\nOver the years, Cathy flirted with the idea of making dolls, but it was transient and brief. However this time, as she deepened her practice, she found doll making comforting: the repetition of sewing, felting and draping was meditative. The process was thought provoking where she encountered silence, the unknown, and memories. She began to see dolls as a bridge to understand the inexplicable; a way to honor traditions and to celebrate change. These dolls have helped her to walk with grief, and find solace along the way.\n\nEach doll that Cathy creates is needle felted on wire armature with hand-dyed and hand-sewn clothing. Then the dolls are finished with 3d printed skulls and taxidermy animal feet and tails.\n\nWe hope you can join us in person to see the entire collection of these captivating and fascinating works of art!\n\nFriday | September 23rd | 6-9pm\n\nPlease join us as we celebrate our five-year anniversary!

Corinne has always loved art in all of its forms. She has worked in interior and landscape design, so when she began painting two years ago, landscapes became a favorite subject of this new painter.\n\nCorinne works in acrylics and alcohol inks. Inspired by nature, color and serene settings, Corinne’s work is interesting and peaceful, conveying a theme of magical and mystical beauty.\n\nCorinne has been a friend of Art Box since our opening five years ago this month, and we are delighted to have her exhibition in our space for our five-year anniversary! We hope you can stop by, meet Corinne and learn more about her process.\n\nFriday | July 1st | 6-9pm | Free\n\nArt Box will be holding over the amazing life-sized portraiture work of Pamela Beach for July's First Friday! Pamela studied at BYU Provo where she graduated in 2001 with a BFA, with an emphasis in painting. While there, she spent two months in Europe with the Visual Arts Department, visiting major museums and painting in small towns along the way. She also studied in New York, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia.\n\nAfter graduation she had two solo shows in galleries in Salt Lake and Bountiful, and participated in a few group shows. She has taken a professional break for the past 14 years to focus on raising her six children, but never really let her artistic practice die.\n\nWith children a little older, Pamela is painting again, and finding her own narrative a necessary part in the artistic landscape of Utah.\n\nWith vivid colors and large formats, this is a body of work you really need to see and experience in person!\n\nFriday | May 6th | 6-9pm | Free\n\nWe are delighted to have the return of Sunnie Bybee for May’s First Friday Art Stroll and Open Studio Night at The Monarch! Sunnie studied fine art at Brigham Young University and earned her BFA in painting in 2003. After a few years of searching for a unique style, Sunnie discovered that she loves to illustrate and create works about people. Sometimes that presents itself in the form of a portrait, and at other times illustrations of well-known stories and tales.\n\nRecently, Sunnie has been working on “This Royal Endowment” - a body of work about the general idea of individual worth and how it has been measured throughout the civilized world. Each portrait is painted in a style that calls back to the opulence of the late medieval period and early European Renaissance. Symbols of royalty like the French fleur-de-lys and the golden crown are used to elevate the perceived worth of each subject.\n\nSunnie’s work is heavily influenced by the myths and stories from Europe, specifically fairy tales. Included in the subjects represented are animals that are more common in old myths and fairy tales. Many times these animal tropes were used to represent a human personality type or archetype.\n\nWe invite you to come learn more about Sunnie and view her incredible work!\n\nSaturday, April 30th | 2-4pm | Free\n\nAfter a traumatic birth and long, painful recovery, Kyriaki Birkeland started to notice that she wasn't the only one struggling with the emotional and physical transition into new motherhood. More and more she heard stories of moms who were suffering from either physical or emotional scars of motherhood, and often both. Wanting to find a way to love, encourage and support these busy and overwhelmed moms, Kyriaki started to write. Soon, \"Motherhood is Big Enough\" was born!\n\nThis high contrast board book offers mom a little bit of encouragement and self-care during baby care! Artfully crafted with the help of local Ogden mom & artist Jennilyn Keinsley, the pictures and phrases are simple and intentional, but the message is for those who may be struggling with the day-to-day load of motherhood. So while the pictures and words provide support for a baby's developing social, cognitive and language skills, the book's message is just for mom.\n\nCome meet Kyriaki and learn more about her own journey into motherhood and the resulting journey into helping other new moms.\n\nFriday, April 1st | 6-9pm | Free\n\nAn emerging artist and practicing witch, D Bowden explores the crossroads between creativity, imagination and spirituality in relationship to nature. They grew up in a very artistic family feeling early on that art would always be part of their life. However, it wasn’t until 2017 that they really began to take the artist’s journey. After years of teaching meditation, earth-based spirituality and animistic philosophy, D finally found what truly fuels their passions. After leaving their day job of 16 years with the federal government, D moved to Olympia, Washington where they started trying out different mediums. Eventually, D discovered that ink and watercolor hold the power of patience and precision, while acrylic and canvas detoxify the mind and feed the soul. Now D is back in Ogden and excited to share what is on the horizon. The future is so bright, they might have to wear shades.\n\nD likes to think of their work as a portal into another world. Not on some fantastical landscape only in the mind, but instead exposing the world hiding underneath the one we occupy on the daily. The animistic worldview is all about acknowledging the threads connecting everything in our world to the fabric of the underlying universe. A place where our spirit and bodies find their connective tissues. D embraces natural themes, holiday celebrations and human sensual experiences as the subjects they explore. Vacillating between watercolor and acrylic mediums, D hopes to create an experience that both delights the senses and invites inquiry and discussions, all while enchanting the viewer with that special magic of perception.\n\nMarch 4th | 6-9pm | Free\n\nBased out of Salt Lake City, Moni Ellee began her artistic work in 2009 fueled by her endless captivation of nature and art. Although her artistic endeavors began as a child, her passion for creating nature-inspired art in various materials has become her life's purpose. With each delicately traversed oil painting, Moni handcrafts windows into the vast and wildly vivid realm of the West, a spirit that has been forever infused in her heart. Her works are reminders to the untamed explorer beckoning them back to the natural world.\n\nMoni’s work consists of oil paintings on Gessobord in various sizes - from micro scale to 18” x 24” and larger. All of her original paintings are framed locally, unless they are a “Rock Easel” painting, which are unframed and tastefully mounted to a rock that has been handpicked by her.

She feels very fortunate to be doing what she loves and inspiring others in the process.\n\nAlthough Laurie works mainly in oil, she also loves to experiment and play with different mediums. She uses oil paints and cold wax for many of her abstracts which create great texture. She also tends to work wet into wet for subtle color and soft edges.

Goodson back at Art Box! Mark was our first featured artist and many of you will remember his amazing Converse sneakers piece that hung in our shop when we were down on lower 25th Street. Mark’s work covers a broad range of genre including portraiture, figurative, still life, and landscapes. Although Mark did not begin painting until age 47, he is an accomplished local, regional and internationally award winning artist.\n\nMark’s paintings have an innate feel of light, color, form and atmosphere. As a representational painter, Mark works in a naturalistic style, both realistic and painterly. Mark’s works read well up close and at a distance. They also exhibit a richness of color combined with the natural, yet lively, beauty of both light and shadow. Mark enjoys the buttery body of the paint on the palette and the brush, and its textures on the canvas. He likes the brush stroke to be visible-the hand of the artist evident.\n\nWe are honored to have Mark back with us and hope you can stop by to meet him and see his incredible work in person!\n\nFriday | September 3rd | 6-9pm\n\nArt Box is excited to feature another young creative entrepreneur!

Being passionate about art and music, Rachel loves Broadway musicals, Anime artwork, music of many genres, and theater, and has been in several musicals herself!\n\nCome meet Rachel and be inspired by her enchanted creations.\n\nAugust 6th | 6-9pm | Free\n\nGillian Chapman (aka “boujee hippie art”) is a local artist from Ogden studying Political Science at Weber State. This 22-year-old, who lives with bipolar I disorder, has been doing artwork since her childhood. Using art as an outlet, much of her work is done during or right after manic episodes which spark her creativity. Gillian gets inspiration from her dreams, and looks up to artists such as Van Gogh who also lived with bipolar disorder or manic depressive disorder. As such, you can see different moods throughout her work.\n\nWorking on canvas and wood, this exhibit consists mostly of landscapes and different places Gillian has been, including Colorado and the mountains of Utah. She is also exhibiting several abstract nude paintings. Most of this body of work was done in the last year during or after manic episodes.\n\nJuly 31st | 10am-1pm | $50\n\nWe are delighted to have the return of artist Nancy Andruk Olson to Art Box!

She studied with various professional artists at the Bridge and Hein Art Academies and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Utah. From figures to still life, landscapes to animals, Heather is interested in the human condition and emotional aspect of our existence, and portraying the soul of every living thing. As a lifelong animal lover, animals often appear in much of her work.\n\nHeather’s paintings are rooted in realism due to her classical training, but passionately creates her art with expressionistic brushstrokes and heavy application of paint. The use of vivid color and texture in each piece captures the emotional aspect of each subject.\n\nFor this exhibition, Heather will be featuring a collection of various animals that the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Northern Utah treats and saves, and will also be donating part of her proceeds from the sale of her work to this amazing cause.\n\nMay 7th | 6-9pm | Free\n\nPamela’s painting style is a form of portraiture that represents life experiences and emotions that are real, but not visible to the physical eye. What goes on in the heart and mind is where real transformations in life take place, and therein lies the place that Pamela strives to express through her paintings.\n\nWithin each piece, Pamela seeks representation of a realistic figure going through an abstract process. It is a process similar to living life itself. When we look at the whole of our lives, some parts make sense, and some don’t. Some are solid, and well defined, and some remain confusing and murky. Pamela’s work is imbued with a reverence for life, a reverence for difficulties, and a reverence for the beautiful process we all go through as human beings.\n\nPamela paints with oil on panel, as this surface and medium allow her to express the messages she wants her artwork to convey. Sometimes areas are sanded down or painted over. Sometimes collage elements or fabric are added. She always leave traces of the whole process in the finished work so the viewer can sort out how she arrived at the end.\n\nPamela studied at BYU Provo where she graduated in 2002 with a BFA, with an emphasis in painting. While there she spent two months in Europe with the Visual Arts Department, visiting major museums and painting in small towns along the way. She also studied with BYU professors in New York, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, visiting major museums and galleries.\n\nApril 2nd | 6-9pm\n\nAt Art Box we are happy to support young artists and entrepreneurs!

I did not think it would have gone this far. I am very proud of myself (so are my mom and dad!). When I am not making candles, I am always dancing. I started competition dance when I was three, and currently dance for Utah Dance Academy. It is safe to say that between dance and candlemaking, I am always pretty busy!\""
