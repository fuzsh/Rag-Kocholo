        "text": "Anne Imhof\n\nWish You Were Gay\n\nKunsthaus Bregenz\n\nThrough September 22, 2024\n\nAnne Imhof is one of the most important contemporary artists of our time. Her signature artistic expression is rooted in performance pieces, where casts of androgynous figures navigate the space with a captivating blend of impassive poise and elaborate choreography within an immersive audio-visual experience. This dynamic interplay, underscored by the inclusion of ubiquitous and iconic elements of fashion, photography, and an amalgamation of subculture and popular culture, creates an atmosphere reminiscent of post-apocalyptic isolation.\n\nWithin the austere confines of Kunsthaus Bregenz, Anne Imhof ushers in a compelling transformation. In this enigmatic creation, a paradox unfolds, taking the shape of both a barricade and a proscenium. For the KUB exhibition, Imhof will focus on painting and sculpture, which form the crux of her artistic practice, mirroring the fluid evolution of her performative works. The human figure now assumes an allegorical presence, offering a heightened sense of Imhof’s trademark exploration of the human condition.\n\nJenny Holzer\n\nLight Line\n\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation, New York\n\nThrough September 29, 2024\n\nThis exhibition will present a reimagination of Jenny Holzer’s landmark 1989 installation at the Guggenheim. Climbing all six ramps of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed rotunda to the building’s apex, the new manifestation of Holzer’s electronic sign extends and builds upon the artist’s vision from thirty-five years earlier. The site-specific work will transform the building with a display of scrolling texts from her earliest series of truisms and aphorisms to more recent experiments with language generated by artificial intelligence. Holzer’s iconic use of the written word throughout her career has long captivated audiences around the world and this solo exhibition will feature little known examples of Holzer’s work spanning her career from the 1980s through today.\n\nJohn Baldessari\n\nJohn Baldessari. The End of the Line\n\nCraig Robins Collection\n\nFundación Malba – Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires\n\nThrough November 18, 2024\n\nFirst South American survey devoted to John Baldessari, the great pioneer of conceptual art. The exhibition features a selection of 45 works, spanning paintings, photographs and installations drawn from the collection of Craig Robins – a friend, promoter, close interlocutor and one of the most important collectors of Baldessari’s work. John Baldessari: The End of the Line reviews 50 years of the artist’s work organized in four thematic groupings. The exhibition highlights Baldessari’s foundational works from the 1960s and 70s; the radical incineration of his own work; his serial approach to photography; and his ongoing exploration of the interplay between imagery and language, between the world of text and that of ideas.\n\nCao Fei\n\nMeta-Mentary\n\nStädtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Munich\n\nThrough September 8, 2024\n\nIn her films, photographs, and walk-in multimedia installations, Cao Fei addresses the economic and social changes of our time. Digitalization, globalization, the transformation of urban and suburban structures and thus our living spaces are at the heart of her art. Her questions focus on the way we humans live and react to the developments around us and adapt to them or actively incorporate them into our lives. For her works, Cao Fei herself sometimes spends time in the virtual community using her avatars China Tracy and Oz and documents her perception of digital realities in individual imagery and distinctive artistic spaces. Invention and reality, the fantastic and the documented, the digital and the human combine to create surreal, dystopian images and individual aesthetics that can be experienced by the public. Cao Fei’s exhibition at the Lenbachhaus will also focus on how rapid social change is being accelerated by digital technologies, affecting and changing human experience and the self-image of human existence at their core.\n\nCao Fei\n\nTidal Flux\n\nMuseum of Art Pudong, Shanghai\n\nThrough November 17, 2024\n\nMuseum of Art Pudong proudly announces its third major exhibition of the year, Cao Fei: Tidal Flux, opening to the public from June 22 to November 17, 2024. This exhibition marks MAP’s first solo show dedicated to a female artist and its first major exhibition of moving images and media art since the museum’s inception. For artist Cao Fei, this marks her inaugural large-scale mid-career retrospective in Shanghai, and one of her largest solo exhibitions ever staged globally. This exhibition provides a comprehensive overview of Cao Fei’s nearly 30-year artistic journey. The exhibition delves into themes of time, the body, and technology, encompassing several of Cao Fei’s significant long-term projects. Highlights include her early works during the “Pearl River Delta” period, the exploration of digital and virtual realms in the “metaverse” originating from the RMB City body of work, and her research project HX. Furthermore, the exhibition features seven pieces making their global debut, and thirteen works/series being shown in China for the first time.\n\nThomas Demand\n\nThe Stutter of History\n\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Houston\n\nThrough September 15, 2024\n\nAt first, the images Thomas Demand creates seem to depict the real world. A closer look, however, reveals that they are actually photographs of temporary sculptural re-creations. Demand often selects his source imagery from the news media, and he re-creates those images as life-size models using colored paper and cardboard. Then he photographs the images and prints them at a monumental scale. Afterward, Demand destroys his models, leaving behind only their ghostly photographic doubles. The “stutter of history” evoked by the exhibition’s title lies in that strange gap between the real world and the re-created world of paper and cardboard that the artist conjures in his studio.\n\nThe internationally touring exhibition Thomas Demand: The Stutter of History is a landmark retrospective of the artist’s work, and the MFAH is the only U.S. venue.\n\nSylvie Fleury\n\nYes to All\n\nKunsthal Rotterdam\n\nThrough September 8, 2024\n\nIn the spring of 2024, Kunsthal Rotterdam is presenting a large-scale exhibition of the work of the Swiss artist Sylvie Fleury. For the very first time her provocative installations, sculptures, ready-mades, and paintings will be shown in the Netherlands. In a playful way, Fleury challenges the cultural constructs of gender stereotypes. She uses modern advertising strategies such as attention-seeking slogans, brightly colored neon lights, and seductive presentations to explore the boundaries between contemporary art and consumerism. Incorporating elements from the worlds of fashion and film, pop culture, and art history, Fleury consistently succeeds in creating unexpected new stories, always infused with a generous dose of humor and individuality.\n\nGilbert & George\n\nLONDON PICTURES\n\nThe Gilbert & George Centre, London\n\nCelebrating a year since opening, Gilbert & George are thrilled to announce the second exhibition to take place at the Gilbert & George Centre – the ‘LONDON PICTURES’. The largest group of pictures created by Gilbert & George, they offer both a directory of urban human behaviour and a moral portrait of our times. Over a number of years, Gilbert & George stole newspaper posters found across London, filtering and sorting the stories they conveyed by subject matter. More than a decade since they were first unveiled on a global tour, the Centre will present 28 of the 292 pictures from the ‘LONDON PICTURES’ series, many of which have not been seen in the UK previously. Viewing these ‘LONDON PICTURES’ in 2024 will prompt viewers to consider how society has changed and what has remained central to our shared experience.\n\nJenny Holzer\n\nLiljevalchs Konsthall, Stockholm\n\nThrough August 31, 2024\n\nEach day from 11am–8pm\n\nSince the 1970s, Jenny Holzer has used language as her primary means of expression to explore new avenues for art in public space. In the past, the world has been able to experience her art through everything from large-scale installations, projections, signs, posters, stone benches and plaques to condom packaging. Text is always central, whether it's flickering from an electronic sign or engraved in granite. Now three of her iconic works, Truisms (1977–79), Survival (1983–85) and Arno (1996) are becoming part of the Stockholm cityscape on LED screens.\n\nThe activations are direct in their approach, yet often contradictory, challenging the viewer to take a stand on political as well as moral issues. Truisms is activated at Stureplan, Survival at Katarinahissen at Slussen and Arno at Hötorget, the intersection of Sveavägen/Kungsgatan.\n\nTake a Breath\n\nGroup Exhibition\n\nIMMA – Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin\n\nThrough March 17, 2025\n\nTake a Breath is a major new exhibition that provides an historical, social, political, and personal examination of breathing – why we breathe, how we breathe and what we breathe – exploring themes of decolonisation, environmental racism, indigenous language, the impact of war on the environment and breath as meditation.\n\nTaking as its starting point the nature of breath and its vital role in our very existence, the exhibition reflects on the social, political, environmental, and spiritual aspect of breathing, tracking this vital act from the impact of post-industrial air pollution to modern-day wars and the effect on environment, health and how we live; to the suppression of protests of voices from different communities, where breath is a symbol of community and resistance; and the use of breath as personal meditation.\n\nAnthony McCall\n\nSplit Second\n\nMuseo Guggenheim Bilbao\n\nThrough November 10, 2024\n\nCoinciding with the 10th anniversary of the Museum’s program devoted to artistic practices of the moving image, the Film & Video Gallery will host the radically abstract, film-based work of Anthony McCall. In clear dialogue with the works of Richard Serra and Lucio Fontana in the Museum Collection, this exhibition will feature the premiere of a single new work, Split Second (Mirror) IV (2024), alongside the historic projection piece Miniature in Black and White (1972) and a series of photographic prints.\n\nJon Rafman\n\nBreaking the Void\n\nTaipei Fine Arts Museum, Taipei\n\nThrough September 15, 2024\n\nBreaking the Void presents Jon Rafman’s video work Punctured Sky (2021), and S.S Lacuna: Prologue (2024), an interactive video commissioned by TFAM Net.Open. The two pieces raise questions and probes into the virtual and real dimensions of cyberspace. As the narrative exploration unfolds, the intangible web constructed by the internet gradually reveals fissures and holes piercing through the virtual towards reality. Yet, the world it leads to, is it indeed reality, or another boundless void?\n\nPamela Rosenkranz\n\nOld Tree\n\nHigh Line, New York\n\nThrough September 2024\n\nSprüth Magers congratulates Pamela Rosenkranz whose monumental sculpture Old Tree was selected for the third High Line Plinth commission in New York, to be unveiled in spring of 2023. The bright red and pink imaginary tree animates a myriad of historical archetypes wherein the tree of life connects heaven and earth while also closely resembling the complex networks of the human circulatory system. Located on the High Line—an urban park built on a relic of industry—and selected from among over 80 international proposals by artists from 40 countries, Old Tree raises questions about the real while simultaneously highlighting a breakdown of the boundary between nature and artifice.\n\nEd Ruscha\n\nED RUSCHA / NOW THEN\n\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art – LACMA\n\nThrough October 6, 2024\n\nEd Ruscha has consistently held up a mirror to American society by transforming some of its defining attributes – from consumer culture and popular entertainment to the ever-changing urban landscape – into the very subject of his art. In 1956, Ruscha left Oklahoma City to study commercial art in Los Angeles, where he drew inspiration from the city’s architectural landscape – parking lots, urban streets, and apartment buildings – and colloquial language.\n\nAs his first comprehensive, cross-media retrospective in over 20 years, ED RUSCHA / NOW THEN traces Ruscha’s methods and familiar subjects throughout his career and underscores the many remarkable contributions he has made well beyond the boundaries of the art world. The exhibition includes his early works produced while traveling through Europe, his installations – such as the Chocolate Room and the Course of Empire presented at the Venice Biennale in 1970 and 2005, respectively – and his ceaseless photographic documentation of the streets of Los Angeles beginning in 1965.\n\nEd Ruscha\n\nWorks on Paper\n\nHall Art Foundation, New York\n\nThrough December 1, 2024\n\nThe Hall Art Foundation is pleased to announce an exhibition by the internationally acclaimed American artist, Ed Ruscha to be held at its galleries in Reading, Vermont. The show begins with a group of Ruscha’s seminal black-and-white photographs from 1962 and presents over a dozen works on paper that span five decades of his career. Since the 1960s, Ruscha has explored the role of language in painting, drawing, photography, printmaking, and bookmaking by using the meaning and formal qualities of words as his principle subject matter.\n\nStephen Shore\n\nVehicular & Vernacular\n\nFondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, Paris\n\nThrough September 15, 2024\n\nWith over a hundred images shot between 1969 and 2021 across the United States, Vehicular & Vernacular is the first retrospective of Stephen Shore’s work in Paris in nineteen years. On view at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, the exhibition shows the photographer’s renowned series—Uncommon Places and American Surfaces—alongside lesser-known projects never shown in France. A fragment of the Signs of Life exhibition in which Shore participated in 1976 is exceptionally recreated for the occasion. Finally, the photographer’s most recent series, shot using drones, is exhibited for the first time in Europe.\n\nMarcel van Eeden\n\nArt Today – Drawings and Animations\n\nMuseum Morsbroich, Leverkusen\n\nThrough October 6, 2024\n\nLike hardly anyone else in contemporary art, Marcel van Eeden gives the medium of drawing cinematic qualities, opening a window into a very vividly portrayed past. Based on photographs from magazines, newspapers, books and catalogues, all printed before his birth in 1965, he explores a time that took place without him, but into which he puts himself and literally “draws”. In several groups of drawings, Marcel van Eeden takes us into the past of his adopted home of Zurich, which we explore as if on a city walk – from the modern Bellevue tram stop past the Polybähnli, across Lake Zurich to Picabia and Miró in the Kronenhalle. In the style of pulp fiction, he develops a highly exciting story about cultural loot and Eduard von der Heydt's world art collection, which was to form the basis of the Zurich Rietberg Museum.\n\nKara Walker\n\nFortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine)\n\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art – SFMoMA\n\nThrough May 2026\n\nFortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine)\n\nA Respite for the Weary Time-Traveler.\n\nFeaturing a Rite of Ancient Intelligence Carried out by The Gardeners\n\nToward the Continued Improvement of the Human Specious\n\nby\n\nKara E-Walker.\n\nKara Walker has long been recognized for her incisive examinations of the dynamics of power and the exploitation of race and sexuality. Her work leverages expressions of fantasy and humor to confront troubling histories and dominant narratives, repossessing control in the process. Inspired by a wide range of sources, from antique dolls to Octavia Butler’s novel Parable of the Sower, Walker’s new commission, Fortuna and the Immortality Garden (Machine), considers the memorialization of trauma, the objectives of technology, and the possibilities of transforming the negative energies that plague contemporary society. The presentation marks the first time that SFMOMA has commissioned an artist to create a site-specific installation for the Roberts Family Gallery.\n\nThea Djordjadze, Rosemarie Trockel\n\nlimitation of life\n\nStädtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Munich\n\nNovember 12, 2024–April 27, 2025\n\nThe Lenbachhaus will present a collaborative work by the artists Rosemarie Trockel and Thea Djordjadze. Djordjadze was Trockel’s student at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1998 to 2001 and the two have maintained a close artistic relationship ever since, realizing numerous joint projects and exhibitions. In their exhibition at Lenbachhaus, the artists want to delve into the conception of beauty and challenge established aesthetic conventions, taking inspiration from reflections by the poet Arthur Rimbaud. Rimbaud’s opening lines from “Une saison en enfer” (1873) provide a leitmotif for the artists’ approach: “One evening I sat Beauty on my knees. And I found her bitter and I reviled her.”\n\nNancy Holt\n\nPower Systems\n\nWexner Center for the Arts, The Ohio State University, Columbus\n\nAugust 16, 2024–July 27, 2025\n\nNancy Holt: Power Systems features the most extensive inquiry yet into Nancy Holt’s studies of systems. The exhibition launches in summer 2024 with a presentation of Pipeline, which calls attention to the physical and economic systems powering buildings and to the impact of fossil fuel extraction. Holt visited Alaska in March of 1986 at the invitation of the Visual Arts Center of Alaska, with the hope she might create a work of art in celebration of the region’s beauty. Holt was instead struck by the infiltration of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System through the landscape. In response she made Pipeline, a sculpture made of steel pipes that twist in and out of the gallery, winding down to the floor where one section of pipe leaks—an incessant drip of oil pooling thickly on a white base. Pipeline points to the unchecked audacity and devastating consequences of the energy industry.\n\nMire Lee\n\nHyundai Commission: Mire Lee\n\nTurbine Hall, Tate Modern, London\n\nOctober 8, 2024–March 16, 2025\n\nTate Modern and Hyundai Motor announce that Mire Lee will create the next annual Hyundai Commission. Mire Lee is known for her visceral sculptures which use kinetic, mechanised elements to invoke the tension between soft forms and rigid systems. Her new site-specific work for the Turbine Hall will be open to the public from 8 October 2024 to 16 March 2025. This will be the first major presentation of Lee’s work in the UK."
