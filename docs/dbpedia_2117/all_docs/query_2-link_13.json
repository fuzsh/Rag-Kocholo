        "text": "Elwes’s early experiences of painting contemporary artists’ studios in Paris led him to see the figure of the artist through his or her belongings, with their specific arrangements able to be understood as idiosyncratic clues towards their personalities, moods and practices. Elwes is meticulous in his research, and when the dawn of the internet provided open access to archival material he viewed this wealth of information as pieces to puzzle together in search of complete representations of each studio space, and therefore the artist.\n\nPersonal connections to Haring and Basquiat have led him to capture their studios several times, but other artists like Picasso and Matisse also offer Elwes many facets of their practice and personalities to explore through their multiple studio spaces. No matter the history, Elwes approaches his work intimately. By their very nature his paintings are embedded with a level of familiarity, taking on an anecdotal significance akin to memories being passed from friend to friend.\n\nThese paintings are often rendered through subtle stylistic nods to the aesthetic of the artist in question, imbuing the image of the studio with the energy of its absent inhabitant. The viewer therefore becomes part of a specific art historical moment, experiencing the stark minimalism of Georgia O’Keeffe’s uncluttered living room or feeling the sea breeze waft through the windows of Matisse’s Mediterranean coastal studio. Elwes punctuates his works with recreations of seminal artworks, lending his paintings a richly layered presence. Stylistic homages to a plethora of artistic greats seep into Elwes’ own work, yet he strikes a singular balance in learning from his aesthetic influences while simultaneously creating an independent and unique body of work."
