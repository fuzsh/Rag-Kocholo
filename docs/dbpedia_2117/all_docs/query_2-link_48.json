        "text": "There are a lot of reasons for collecting and living with art. Some seem to be reasonable, some are obviously irrational. And it can become quite difficult, not to get lost in this \"jungle of opportunities\". Christian Kaspar Schwarm – founder of INDEPENDENT COLLECTORS talks about his personal motives for having let contemporary art enter his life two decades ago.\n\nPRIVATE SESSION\n\nBy appointment Only\n\nBook here\n\nABOUT\n\nChristian Kaspar Schwarm (born 1972) is a dedicated collector and book lover who has turned his own Berlin office into a library. He works self-employed, as a strategy consultant and teaches on a regular basis at the Mannheim based \"Popakademie\", a state academy of popular music and culture. Christian describes his collection as a constant movement between two different poles: the dimension of \"conflict\" – most often in a political or societal meaning – is confronted with the contemporary interpretation of devotion and emotion. The latter seems to symbolize an almost spiritual chance of facing the obscure complexity of our world today. The artists in his collection are Fiona Banner, Beni Bischof, Nina Canell, Marcel van Eeden, Tom Ellis, Guan Xiao, Diango Hernández, David Horvitz, Raimer Jochims, Jonathan Monk, Mario Pfeifer, Peter Piller, Lin May Saeed, Karin Sander, Slavs and Tatars, Michael E. Smith, Simon Starling, Fiete Stolte, Lukas Stopczynski, Hague Yang.\n\nMax & Corina Krawinkel\n\nWhat might have initially begun as two collectors with two very different tastes has now resulted in one of Germany’s most important collections of contemporary art by West German artists.\n\nCologne\n\nGrässlin Collection\n\nProviding an overview of the history of Austrian, German and Swiss painting over the last thirty-five years, as well as the story of one of the most notable German private collections.\n\nSt. Georgen\n\nme Collectors Room – Private Exposure\n\nFor the fifth time, the Olbricht Foundation has invited London Metropolitan University students from the ‘Curating the Contemporary’ Master’s program in collaboration with the Whitechapel Gallery, to curate and develop an exhibition with works from the extensive art collection of Thomas Olbricht.\n\nBerlin\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\nOriginally founded in 2001 and opened up to the public five years later, the Gerisch Collection hosts an extensive collection in the surroundings of its very own sculpture park, where art can be found down winding paths, in hidden corners and on ponds among blossoming water lilies.\n\nNeumünster\n\nCindy Sherman – Works from the Olbricht Collection\n\nArguably one of the most important photographers of the late 20th Century, Cindy Sherman is not just a master of disguise but also a master at captivating her audiences.\n\nBerlin\n\nGute Kunst? Wollen!\n\nBorn into a family of textile merchants that spans over four generations and a long tradition of passionate art collecting Thomas Rusche’s passion for collecting art started early, with his first purchase at the age of 14. Over the years that followed, his passion for collecting has grown into a vast accumulation of 17th century Old Masters, contemporary painting, and sculptures.\n\nBerlin\n\nKarsten Schmitz\n\nArt collector, art philanthropist, social entrepreneur and the developer of one of Germany’s largest contemporary art spaces, the internationally renowned Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei, Karsten Schmitz shares his vision of how artistic, architectural, as well as the social metamorphosis of art spaces can transform the lives of artists, the public, even entire cities.\n\nLeipzig"
