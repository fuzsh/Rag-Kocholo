The artist book Marcel van Eeden 1898 is being published to coincide with the Hans Thoma Prize 2023. The prizewinner, Marcel van Eeden (b. 1965), explores Thoma’s little-known travels to the Netherlands in 1898. He reflects on Thoma’s analysis of Rembrandt van Rijn or Paulus Potter, under the problematic influence of the cultural theorist Julius Langbehn. Present-day gum bichromate images of the places Thoma visited alongside historical quotes by Thoma and Langbehn result in a multifaceted, critical consideration of nationalistic views on culture. Text in English and German. AUTHOR: Marcel van Eeden (born 22 November 1965, in The Hague, Netherlands) is a Dutch draftsman and painter.
