How What would you call the line located on a running track in an athletic stadium, where people, who do sport, run around?

As above, I've never heard anything but "starting line" in AE, but I notice that some countries, e.g. New Zealand and Australia, use "start line." Take your pick

Note that it's often not a single line, since some are staggered to make up for the longer route around the outer lanes of a track.

Why is it not either (start / finish line) or (starting / finishing line)?

There are many instances of apparently inconsistent usage in English.

The answer to "why?" is almost always "Because that's the way we say it."

Sorry.

That is, of course, the correct answer; there happens to be a logical answer as well—at least, this is the way I see it: At the starting line, you are starting. At the finish line, you aren’t finishing; you’ve finished—and it is the finish. Well, you could call the starting line the “start line” because you start there; that makes sense, too. But “finishing line” doesn’t make sense whichever way you look at it.

Welcome!

Others obviously look at it as:

It is the line you are crossing at the instant you are finishing the race.

At the instant you cross that line, you aren’t finishing; you have finished—or, you finish. You are finishing over a period—a tiny bit of time before you cross the line to a tiny bit of time after.

There's no requirement for English to be logical. In any case, there's the very simple grammatical point that "finishing" in "finishing line" is not the continuous form of the verb "finish"; it's the adjectival -ing form, so meaning "the line at which the race finishes".
