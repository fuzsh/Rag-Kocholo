        "text": "It’s no secret that Taylor Swift has always had an affinity for the scene. This has been evident through her captivating performance over a decade ago of “That’s What You Get” alongside Paramore, her collaboration “Two Is Better Than One” with Boys Like Girls, and her confession that Fall Out Boy’s Pete Wentz is one of her favorite lyricists. Taylor may be for the girly pops, but she’s never shied away from winking at elder emos.\n\nRead more: 9 Best Taylor Swift Covers From Alternative Stars\n\nNow, as Swifties worldwide are, no pun intended, swiftly dissecting every line of her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, they’ve caught onto another nod to the scene. In track 17, “The Black Dog,” which fans are speculating was written about her former situationship with The 1975’s frontman, Matty Healy, Swift subtly name-drops The Starting Line. The line, “In The Black Dog, when someone plays The Starting Line,” brings her right back into the fold of the scene. You can read the track’s full lyrics and listen to the song below.\n\n“The Black Dog” Lyrics:\n\nI am someone wh, until recent events\n\nYou shared your secrets with\n\nAnd your location, you forgot to turn it off\n\nAnd so I watch as you walk\n\nInto some bar called The Black Dog\n\nAnd pierce new holes in my heart\n\nYou forgot to turn it off\n\nAnd it hits me\n\nI just don’t understand how you don’t miss me\n\nIn The Black Dog, when someone plays “The Starting Line”\n\nAnd you jump up, but she’s too young to know this song\n\nThat was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming\n\nOld habits die screaming\n\nI move through the world with a heartbroken\n\nMy longing state unspoken\n\nAnd I may never open up the way I did for you\n\nAnd all of those best-laid plans\n\nYou said I needed a bravе man\n\nThen proceeded to play him\n\nUntil I believed it, too\n\nAnd it kills me\n\nI just don’t understand how you don’t miss me\n\nIn the shower and remember how my rain-soaked body\n\nWas shakin’, do you hate me?\n\nWas it hazing for a cruel fraternity?\n\nI pledged, and I still mean it\n\nOld habits die screaming\n\nSix weeks of breathing clean air\n\nI still miss the smoke\n\nWere you makin’ fun of me?\n\nWith some esoteric joke?\n\nNow I wanna sell my house\n\nAnd set fire to all my clothes\n\nAnd hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons\n\nEven if I die screaming\n\nAnd I hope you hear it\n\nAnd then I hope it’s shitty in The Black Dog\n\nWhen someone plays “The Starting Line”\n\nAnd you jump up, but she’s too young to know this song\n\nThat was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming\n\nWith tail between your legs, you’re leavin’"
