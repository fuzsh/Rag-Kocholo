        "text": "Starting Line Fitness was born when my wife asked me to write a workout program for her. I wrote the best program I could. I was damn proud of that program...it was awesome. She never did a single workout from it. You can read more about it here.\n\nLong story short, it became clear to me that there is a disconnect between fitness professionals and the very people we're supposed to be helping. Starting Line Fitness is me doing my part to close the gap. If you've never exercised before, then Starting Line Fitness is for you. If you haven't worked out in a long time, then Starting Line Fitness is for you. If physical activity isn't your favorite thing, then Starting Line Fitness is for you.\n\nStarting Line Fitness uses compassionate lifestyle and nutrition coaching in combination with the most up to date techniques in exercise & movement science to help you live the life you're meant to live. This is done using both traditional exercises and multi-planar movements (not a straight line or back and forth). The purpose of each session is to provide a first and foremost enjoyable experience exploring movement and getting stronger."
