        "text": "\"I hope this email finds you well\" is perhaps the most well-known email opening sentence sample.\n\nThese starting words have found their way to your inbox likely too many times. And you probably use some version of the sentence yourself almost automatically when writing emails yourself.\n\nThere's, however, more than meets the eye when it comes to email opening phrases. \"What opening line in an email means then?\" you might ask.\n\nThe opening line â Â also known as the opening phrase or opening sentence â is the beginning sentence of an email right after the greeting. This first line is essential for setting the tone of the email. It also helps you to catch your recipient's attention.\n\nWhen deciding on the opening, the most important thing is to consider who's the recipient, what kind of relationship you have with them, and what you want to achieve with your message. You should also know that the email opening and closing phrases come in pairs â in other words, you should match how you start and end the email.Â\n\nIt's good to have plenty of these phrases in your toolkit not to have to spend time thinking â or googling them â on the spot. That's why we have compiled a list of the 100 best email opening lines.\n\nThese examples span across different categories such as formal, polite, professional, business, friendly. We also cover common types of mails such as cold, sales, and follow-up emails. Lastly, we have to throw a couple of curveballs with examples of informal and funny email opening phrases.\n\nBy the time you've read through this blog post, you should have a good opening line for any email right at your fingertips. If it's not on this list, you don't need it. So, instead of continuing to obsess over how do you start an opening sentence in an email, enjoy these 100 samples and don't forget to try Flowrite:\n\nFormal email opening lines\n\nFormal emails are the ones you send to your professors, government officials, and at times to businesses. They are characterized by accurate grammar, punctuation, and spelling and adhere to email format and etiquette.\n\nMany of us don't need to send formal emails that often, but these are some of the most important occasions to get the formality for the opening sentence just right. Examples of these situations include when applying for a job or trying to conduct business or handle personal matters with officials and when trying to establish a connection with a company that you are not in business with yet.\n\nEspecially if the company is in an industry known to be formal and hierarchical. Below ee put together the best formal opening lines that will do the job in any such situation. So consider bookmarking this blog post for future reference.\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI hope your day so far has been pleasant.\n\nI hope you are having a wonderful day.\n\nYour prompt response is much appreciated.\n\nI am writing to you in relation to...\n\nThank you for contacting us at <company name>\n\nFurther to our earlier exchange...\n\nI am extending a hand for partnershipâ¦\n\nAllow me to introduce myself.\n\nIt is great to hear from you.\n\nPolite email openings\n\nThere are many shades of politeness, but when it comes to emails, you should try to come off as polite no matter what.\n\nThe best way to be safe than sorry is to try to put yourself in the recipient's shoes and try to think about how they perceive your message and its first phrase. Being respectful and considerate, however, doesn't have to mean being formal.\n\nIn fact, formalities can come off as stiff and make you seem uneasy to approach when not constituting an official or important occasion.\n\nOur advice is not to get hung up on finding a polite opening to your emails. Just follow good manners and write like you wish to be addressed if the situation were the other way around. The best email opening sentences for polite emails include the following examples.\n\nWhen in doubt, use one of these, and you can't go wrong.\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI hope your week has been great so far.\n\nGood morning/afternoon/evening.\n\nI hope your week started well.\n\nThank you for the timely response.\n\nThank you for getting in touch with...\n\nI'd be eager to get your advice on...\n\nI'm writing to...\n\nAllow me to introduce myself briefly.\n\nIt's great to hear from you.\n\nProfessional email openings\n\nOpening a professional email can be tricky. It's challenging to navigate various interpersonal relationships we all have at the office and with external stakeholders to land on the best way to open a professional email as the email's first sentence can be anything from formal to friendly.\n\nOne practical strategy is to use 'mirroring'. Â It refers to matching your opening line (as well as other conventions and the language) with whatever the recipient has used in their previous conversation with you.\n\nThis is not always possible, and the rule of thumb is to err on the more side of things to start the email and new relationship on the right foot. Once you get to know the person, it becomes easier to adjust the tone of your emails accordingly, including just the right first words.\n\nHere are some professional email opening sentence samples that will make the decision easier for you.\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI hope you are having a great week.\n\nI hope you are having a great day.\n\nThank you for reaching out to us.\n\nThank you for the prompt response.\n\nI could use your advice on...\n\nI'm contacting you aboutâ¦\n\nTo follow up on my previous email...\n\nAllow me to briefly introduce myself.\n\nIt's is good to hear from you.\n\nOpening sentences for business emails\n\nHow do I start a professional email for my business?\n\nWell, the starting words of a business email give an ever-important first impression. Similarly, they are crucial for keeping existing customers, partners and vendors engaged.\n\nYour approach to business email openings should follow the same rules and conventions as with other professional emails. However, business etiquette today is more liberal than it used to be.\n\nThis means you can take more liberties with the business email opening lines and phrases.\n\nThe expectation to this might be when you are in business with government or city officials. It's also good to note that business email etiquette differs from country to country.\n\nSo you should do your due diligence before embarking on a new business relationship with companies or people from different parts of the world.\n\nYou might be surprised by how formal some cultures are. As you'll soon notice, good business email opening lines are similar to what we covered in the last part.\n\nHowever, you should pay close attention: something as small as using contractions can make a difference (and sometimes you're sending emails to multiple people).\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI hope you are having a great week.\n\nI hope your day has been great.\n\nThank you for the quick response.\n\nThank you for getting in touch with...\n\nI'm writing to inquire about...\n\nI'm hoping to get your advice on...\n\nI'm following up on my previous email on...\n\nMy name isâ¦ and I work for...\n\nI'm glad to hear from you!\n\nFriendly email opening lines\n\nFor many of us, the daily emails are all at the friendly end of the spectrum. Perhaps it's internal mail to a colleague or back and forth with a long-term client.\n\nIn these situations, it's good to relax a little while keeping things competent. However, it can be a delicate balance sometimes â especially with the opening phrases. While many workplaces are more casual these days, you should still keep professionalism front and center.\n\nFriendly email opening lines move to a slightly more casual direction from the polite examples. These examples still pass the bar for any email correspondence with professional connections you have an existing relationship with.Â\n\nHow are you?\n\nThanks for your help with...\n\nI'm hoping to get your advice on...\n\nIt's great to hear from you!\n\nThis article/video made me think of you!\n\nThanks for reaching out.\n\nThanks for the quick response.\n\nI loved your recent <social media post/blog post>!\n\nIt was great to meet/talk to you!Â\n\nI hope you enjoyed your holiday/day off!\n\nSales email opening lines\n\nWe are sorry to let you down; there's no silver bullet when it comes to opening phrases for sales emails. This is because there are so many different products or services to sell and prospects to approach.\n\nBest sales email opening lines ââlead with value, earn credibility, and intrigue interest to make a great first impression. Busy professionals in decision-making positions receive tons of sales emails. So you should also demonstrate that you've made an effort to get to know their business and are not about to waste their time. Writing email openers is a craft that sales professionals hone throughout their careers.\n\nThe good news is that practice also makes perfect with this skill.
