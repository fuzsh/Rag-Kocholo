        "text": "More Taylor Swift\n\nPop-punk icons The Starting Line have thanked Taylor Swift in an Instagram post for name dropping them in her song The Black Dog on her new album, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nThe song, which dropped on April 19 as part of Swiftâs surprise double album, chronicles a time when Swiftâs ex forgot to turn off his location and went to a bar called âThe Black Dogâ.\n\nâI just don't understand / How you don't miss me / In The Black Dog, when someone plays The Starting Line / And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song / That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming.â\n\nThe Starting Line took to Instagram to thank Swift for the line, saying, âWe heard the song, thanks for name checking our band.â\n\nDon't miss a beat with our FREE daily newsletter\n\nReferencing the so-called âSwift Liftâ, where artists, places, etc. mentioned by Swift get a boost of popularity from her fans, they continued, âWe feel flattered and humbled by the reverberations of love that have come back to us as a result.â\n\nSince The Black Dog was released, The Starting Line have had a huge jump in Google searches, going from zero the day before to about 100 searches per hour once the song was out.\n\nThe band finished up, saying, âItâs an honor to have TSL memorialised on such a lovely song. You didnât have to do that, but you did, and we appreciate it wholeheartedly. Respect!â\n\nThough Swift doesnât mention which TSL song sheâs referencing, fans have speculated that sheâs talking about their 2002 hit The Best Of Me.\n\nAnd, while she doesnât say who the song is about, many believe itâs The 1975 frontman Matty Healy that Swift is singing about. Healy, who had a brief relationship with Swift in May 2023, covered The Best Of Me on his tour at the time, singing a snippet in New Zealand in late April, and again in the Philippines in early May.\n\nThe Starting Line added a sneaky P.S. on their post: â#4OTWâ. Does this mean weâre getting a new album from them soon? Guess weâll have to wait and see."
