        "text": "Sailing has always been seen as an elite sport, a sport for a few.\n\nWe aim to change that narrative. Beyond a physical activity, sailing teaches teamwork, leadership, accountability, respect for mother nature, and belief in oneself. These values can be applied to all aspects of life. The reality is, sailing is like very few sports â€” it can be done for life. From a young child to old age, sailing can be done by any and all. From physically able bodied to significantly disabled, everyone is equal on the water. There are no boundaries, except how far you dream of going.\n\nOur goal is to share that reality with more people. Our companies range from physical manufacturers of boats in the United States to retailers that offer products and services across the country."
