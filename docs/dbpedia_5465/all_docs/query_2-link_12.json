        "text": "Middle English sterten, \"leap, jump, cavort, caper,\" from Old English *steortian, *stiertan, Kentish variants of styrtan \"to leap up\" (but the Old English verb is attested only in Northumbrian past participle sturtende), from Proto-Germanic *stert- (source also of Old Frisian sterta, stirta \"to fall, tumble,\" Middle Dutch sterten, storten, Dutch storten \"to rush, fall,\" Old High German sturzen, German stürzen \"to hurl, throw, plunge\"). According to Watkins, the notion is \"move briskly, move swiftly,\" and the Proto-Germanic word is from PIE root *ster- (1) \"stiff.\"\n\nFrom \"move or spring suddenly,\" the sense extended by c. 1300 to include \"awaken suddenly or abruptly; flinch or recoil in alarm,\" and by 1660s to \"cause to begin acting or operating.\"\n\nThe meaning \"begin to move, leave, or depart; enter upon action\" (without implication of suddenness) is from 1821. The connection probably is from sporting senses (\"force an animal from its lair,\" late 14c.). The transitive sense of \"set in motion or action\" is from 1670s; specifically as \"set machinery in action\" by 1841.\n\nRelated: Started; starting. To start in \"begin\" in any sense, is by 1873, American English; to start something \"cause trouble\" is by 1915, American English colloquial. To start over \"begin again\" is from 1912. In running, starting-line is so called by 1855; starting-block by 1937.\n\nlate 14c., \"an involuntary movement of the body, a sudden jump,\" from start (v.). The meaning \"act of beginning to move or act, a setting out in some course or action\" is by 1560s; that of \"act of setting in motion, signal to begin\" is from c. 1600.\n\nMany senses are modern; in sports-writing it is synecdoche for \"a game\" (by 1944). The meaning \"act of beginning to build a house\" is from 1946, as in the statistical term housing starts. The meaning \"opportunity at the beginning of a career or course of action\" is from 1849, from the notion of a lead or advantage in setting out (in a race or contest). It has been paired regularly with finish (n.) from at least 1839."
