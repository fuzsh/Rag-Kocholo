        "text": "You will use a line chart when you want to emphasize changes in values for one variable (plotted on the vertical axis) for continuous values of a second variable (plotted on the horizontal). This emphasis on patterns of change is sold by line segments moving consistently from left to right and observing the slopes of the lines moving up or down.\n\nOn the horizontal axis, you need a variable that depicts continuous values that have a regular interval of measurement. Very commonly, this variable is a temporal one, generating an observation every minute, hour, day, week, or month. The choice of interval size, or bin, is a decision that the analyst will usually need to make for the data, rather than it being an inherent data characteristic.\n\nOn the vertical axis, you will report the value of a second numeric variable for points that fall in each of the intervals defined by the horizontal-axis variable. Often, this will be a statistical summary like a total or average value across events within each bin.\n\nMultiple lines can also be plotted in a single line chart to compare the trend between series. A common use case for this is to observe the breakdown of the data across different subgroups. The ability to plot multiple lines also provides the line chart a special use case where it might not usually be selected. Normally, we would use a histogram to depict the frequency distribution of a single numeric variable. However, since it’s tricky to plot two histograms on the same set of axes, the line chart serves as a good mode of comparison as a substitute. Line charts used to depict frequency distributions are often called frequency polygons.\n\nChoose an appropriate measurement interval\n\nAn important aspect of creating a line chart is selecting the right interval or bin size. For temporal data, a too-broad of a measurement interval may mean that it takes too long to see where the data trend is leading, hiding away the useful signal. On the flip side of the coin, a too-short a measurement interval may only reveal noise rather than signal.\n\nTesting out different intervals or relying on your domain knowledge about what data is being recorded can inform you of a good choice of bin size. It can also be possible to use multiple lines, with one line for a fine-grained interval, and then a second line for the overall trend, averaging over a rolling window.\n\nInterpolating a curve between points\n\nIn a standard line chart, each point is connected to the next with a straight line segment, from first to last. However, there may be the aesthetic temptation to try and link all of the points smoothly, fitting a curve that goes through all of the points at once. You should absolutely resist this temptation! As seen in the example below, attempting this kind of fitting will be assured of distorting perception of trends in the data. The direction and steepness of the line is supposed to be indicative of change in value, and so the curve may end up implying the presence of additional data points between the actual measurements that do not exist.\n\nUsing a misleading dual axis\n\nExamples of line charts with multiple lines have thus far had each line be part of the same domain, and thus plottable on the same axis. There’s nothing that limits each line to depict values on the same units, however. When a line plot includes two series, each depicting a summary of a different variable, then we end up with a dual axis plot.\n\nThe problem with a dual-axis plot is that it can easily be manipulated to be misleading. Depending on how each axis is scaled, the perceived relationship between the two lines can be changed. In the two plots below, the number of weekly trials and subscriptions are plotted in dual-axis plots. The data is exactly the same for each, but due to the choice of vertical scaling for each variable, the inferred relationship between the variables will change."
