        "text": "The Starting Line has added more dates to their upcoming, Say It Like You Mean It Tenth Anniversary Tour, in December 2012. The tour was selling out fast, but the band was gracious enough to add not only six more dates, but they are also offering pre-sale tickets.\n\nPre-sale tickets are available here, with all the pricing and package deal information. But hurry, tickets will go fast! Regular tickets will be available to the general public Sept. 7th and 8th.\n\nTake a look below for the added dates and head over to The Starting Line’s website for the original dates, as well.\n\nDec. 7 Detroit, MI\n\nDec. 10 Chicago, IL\n\nDec. 14 Pomona, CA\n\nDec. 21 Fort Lauderdale, FL\n\nDec. 22 Orlando, FL\n\nDec. 26 Philadelphia, PA\n\nAnyone excited to go??\n\nFor those inching for The Starting Line to play more shows, Kenny Vasoli (lead singer) will be playing a solo show along with Anthony Green, Vinnie Caruana, and I Am The Avalanche on November 19th in Brooklyn. But that’s not even the best part. Not only will you get a taste of what you’ve been missing, it’s a FREE show. So if you’re anywhere near Brooklyn, go to this show or I might be mad at you (not really but it’s FREE guys, seriously). All of the info can be found on The Starting Line’s Facebook page.\n\nAnd if you haven’t been keeping up with TSL since they announced their hiatus back in 2008, they’re back from their hiatus. Even though they were playing shows back in 2010, they didn’t make this announcement until May of this year at the Slam Dunk Records Leeds music festival. Vasoli said “People keep asking us when we’re getting back together, and the answer I have is yesterday. And what happens when bands get together? They write music. So, we have a new song for you.” And that new song is entitled ‘Luck’. Now they first performed ‘Luck’ live back in January, which I have for you!\n\nBut since I couldn’t find a version of ‘Luck’ from the festival in Leeds, here is ‘Best of Me’ which is one of my all-time favorites."
