        "text": "Figuring out where to line up on race day can be tricky. Itâ€™s helpful for everyone if runners self-seed, ie, place themselves according to how fast they expect to run with the fastest runners in the front, and the slowest towards the back. Many large races have signs to help runners group themselves correctly, or even corrals and different starting times for different pace groups to prevent over-crowding.\n\nI always find it tricky to self-seed correctly at the start line. Iâ€™ve self-seeded over-cautiously at most of my 5ks in the past year and a half, and itâ€™s frustrating to spend the first half mile zig-zagging around people and running on the sidewalk. Seed too far front, and lots of people have to get around you. Seed too far back, and youâ€™re trying not to run people over. Neither is good for you or the runners around you!\n\nIâ€™ve gotten better at figuring out where to start with some experience. Check out this photo Greg took right near the start line of the Needham New Yearâ€™s 5k. I used the bib numbers in the photo to find the finishing times of runners near me at the starting line, to see how well I self-seeded. 5 of the 7 example runners have finishing times starting with 26 or 27 minutes. That includes me, leading me to believe we were in a pretty good starting position and that the outliers, a 24 minute and 21 minute finisher, probably should have been further forward. Perhaps they lined up a little late or a little cautiously and could have been more towards the front. This isnâ€™t their fault, but deciding that I was closer to average than they were helps me decide whether I should have started further back. I think I was in about the right starting position, based on the number of runners I felt passed me vs. number I passed during the first half mile.\n\nGregâ€™s tip: My favorite strategy for choosing a place in the start line is one Greg shared with me. Look up last yearâ€™s results for the same race, and see what percentile youâ€™d be in for finishers if you run your goal pace. Try to have about the right number of people in front of you and behind you as you would if you finished at your goal pace with the previous yearâ€™s runners. This is a MUCH better strategy than trying to stand near people who look like they run a similar pace. You canâ€™t tell by looking at someone how long theyâ€™ve been running, how theyâ€™ve been training, how many waffles they ate for breakfastâ€¦ Itâ€™s much better to gauge what percentage of runners you should have in front of or behind you and just hope for the best.\n\nLooking up last yearâ€™s race results is useful because the size of the race, location, how friendly it is to beginners and walkers, etc., can make can make a huge difference in where you should start.\n\nExamples: If a 5k has a walking division with awards, all runners will start further forward percentage wise than they would otherwise. I start further towards the front in all womenâ€™s events than I do in co-ed events. I have a larger percentage of runners behind me in a 5k than I do in a half marathon. Half marathons later in the fall when weather can be an issue arenâ€™t as appealing for beginners, and I tend to have fewer people finish behind me.\n\nWhy choosing the right starting position is great: Except in the few races that donâ€™t have timing chips on the bibs (the occasional local 5k) you donâ€™t loose those extra seconds it takes you to get to the starting line once the clock starts. That means that starting further back doesnâ€™t matter, provided the people in front of you are actually running faster than you are so you wonâ€™t need to dodge around them.\n\nIt can be tempting to start ambitiously far forward so you have a clear path ahead of you, but itâ€™s demoralizing and potentially dangerous to have people flying by you on either side and possibly bumping into you. The closer you can get to starting near similarly paced runners, the better your racing experience will be. I find that Iâ€™m getting better and better at figuring out where to start, and it makes for much nicer running ðŸ™‚\n\nHappy racing!"
