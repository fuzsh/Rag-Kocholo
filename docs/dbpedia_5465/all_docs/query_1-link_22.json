        "text": "On Friday, April 19, Taylor Swift fans were treated to a surprise double album as the “Anti-Hero” singer released The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology. Across the 31 tracks, Swift name-drops many artists including Charlie Puth, Stevie Nicks, and even herself. Believed to be a song about her previous relationship with The 1975‘s Matty Healy, she also mentions pop-punk legends The Startling Line in her track, “The Black Dog.”\n\nIn a recent post, the band reacted to being named on the album. They said, “Dear Taylor, We heard the song, thank you for name checking our band. We feel flattered and humbled by the reverberations of love that have come back to us as a result.”\n\nThey continued, “It’s an honor to have TSL memorialized on such a lovely song. You didn’t have to do that, but you did, and we appreciate it wholeheartedly. Respect!”\n\nNow, of course, this comes as no surprise because Swift is definitely an elder emo. Just think of her performing “Two Is Better Than One” with Boys Like Girls and collaborating with Fall Out Boy for “Electric Touch.”\n\n“The Black Dog” Lyrics:\n\nI am someone who, until recent events\n\nYou shared your secrets with\n\nAnd your location, you forgot to turn it off\n\nAnd so I watch as you walk\n\nInto some bar called The Black Dog\n\nAnd pierce new holes in my heart\n\nYou forgot to turn it off\n\nAnd it hits me\n\nI just don’t understand how you don’t miss me\n\nIn The Black Dog, when someone plays “The Starting Line”\n\nAnd you jump up, but she’s too young to know this song\n\nThat was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming\n\nOld habits die screaming\n\nI move through the world with a heartbroken\n\nMy longing state unspoken\n\nAnd I may never open up the way I did for you\n\nAnd all of those best-laid plans\n\nYou said I needed a bravе man\n\nThen proceeded to play him\n\nUntil I believed it, too\n\nAnd it kills me\n\nI just don’t understand how you don’t miss me\n\nIn the shower and remember how my rain-soaked body\n\nWas shakin’, do you hate me?\n\nWas it hazing for a cruel fraternity?\n\nI pledged, and I still mean it\n\nOld habits die screaming\n\nSix weeks of breathing clean air\n\nI still miss the smoke\n\nWere you makin’ fun of me?\n\nWith some esoteric joke?\n\nNow I wanna sell my house\n\nAnd set fire to all my clothes\n\nAnd hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons\n\nEven if I die screaming\n\nAnd I hope you hear it\n\nAnd then I hope it’s shitty in The Black Dog\n\nWhen someone plays “The Starting Line”\n\nAnd you jump up, but she’s too young to know this song\n\nThat was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming\n\nWith tail between your legs, you’re leavin’"
