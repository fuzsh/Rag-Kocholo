        "text": "If you grew up in the ’90s, you may remember the Orange County pop-punk quartet Home Grown. Even though they haven’t played in almost two decades, the band is reuniting to play a show right in their home state. In a recent announcement, Home Grown shared that they will be joining The Starting Line for a show in the summer.\n\nTheir Instagram post captions reads: “WE’RE BACK! after 19 years of not playing, we have finally decided to reunite and regain the throne as the Kings of Pop. our first show will be with @thestartinglinerock at the Novo Theater on June 21st. thank you for all the years of support and more news to come!”\n\nSo, if you’re ready for a big dose of nostalgia, you may be able to see your faves play the likes of “You’re Not Alone,” “Kiss Me, Diss Me,” and more from 2002’s Kings Of Pop record, among other album offerings. Plus, this isn’t the only surprise Home Grown has in store, according to their caption.\n\nOf course, The Starting Line is excited to share the stage with Home Grown on June 21. In an Instagram post, the band shared, “THE STOKE just intensified! We are thrilled to announce the TRIUMPHANT RETURN of @homegrownkingsofpop!!
