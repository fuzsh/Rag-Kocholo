        "text": "In a recent interview, The Starting Line bassist/vocalist Kenny Vasoli stated that he expects the band to keep doing scattered dates or short runs each year for the foreseeable future, but will likely never tour again. The reason for that is because Vasoli’s voice has trouble handling the songs he wrote when he was 18 or younger at the age of 30. He also discussed the possibility of a new album, which will be their first since 2007’s Direction.\n\nYou can listen to the interview below."
