        "text": "If you are serious about wanting to run for your mental health, but you’ve fallen on hard times, need extra encouragement during this season of life, and/or can’t afford the necessary resources, then this scholarship is for you.\n\n​\n\nThe Starting Line Scholarship is designed to encourage and motivate anyone that wants to get in the regular habit of running as a form of therapy, exercise, and release.\n\nYou must have a valid mailing address in the United States of America. Children under 18 years of age can apply with the consent and accountability of a legal guardian to ensure the child's success.\n\n​\n\nA letter of recommendation from a family member, friend, colleague, therapist, or someone close to you is required for your application to be considered. The letter does not have to be long, however it must touch on why the Starting Line Scholarship would be important to you and why they believe your mental health would benefit from receiving the scholarship.\n\n​\n\nIf you have applied before and were not accepted, you may apply again. Previous recipients of the scholarship may not apply again and applications submitted will not be considered.\n\nThis program is 100% free. No cost to apply, no cost to participate. We never want money to be a barrier when it comes to running for mental health.\n\n​\n\nAs a reminder, Still I Run is a mental health advocacy group and the programs we offer, including the Starting Line Scholarship, should not be used in place of professional mental health help. The components of this scholarship are intended to assist in starting a person in starting their journey in running for mental health. If you feel you need professional mental health help, please see our Mental Health Resources page."
