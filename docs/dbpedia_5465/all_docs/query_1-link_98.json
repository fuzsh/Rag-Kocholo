        "meta_description": "Listen to The Starting Line with Rich Leigh on Spotify. Your starting line doesn't have to define you.My upbringing wasn't great.But I remember thinking - I have to, and I CAN - break the cycle. That single thought changed my life.At 17, I dropped out of school. At 18, I became a father for the first time, and left the violence and chaos of my family council house without a penny to my name, determined to rewrite my story.By 30, I was a successful PR agency owner with a #1 best-selling book. We were working with some of the UKâ€™s leading brands, entrepreneurs and celebrities.Using that influence, I helped to raise more than a million pounds for sick children.Hosted by me, Rich Leigh, The Starting Line Podcast is your weekly dose of inspiration, featuring powerful conversations with the world's most influential entrepreneurs, entertainers, athletes, philanthropists and thinkers.Subscribe now on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.Watch from series 2 on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@startinglineshowLearn more at startinglinepod.comEmail hello@startinglinepod.com - with guest suggestions, sponsorship requests or just to say hello.Follow on:Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/startinglineshowTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/startinglineshoTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@startinglineshowFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/startinglineshow Hosted on Acast.
