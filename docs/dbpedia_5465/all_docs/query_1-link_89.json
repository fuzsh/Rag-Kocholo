        "text": "The prime meridian is the line of 0Â° longitude, the starting point for measuring distance both east and west around Earth.\n\nThe prime meridian is arbitrary, meaning it could be chosen to be anywhere. Any line of longitude (a meridian) can serve as the 0Â° longitude line. However, there is an international agreement that the meridian that runs through Greenwich, England, is considered the official prime meridian.\n\nGovernments did not always agree that the Greenwich meridian was the prime meridian, making navigation over long distances very difficult. Different countries published maps and charts with longitude based on the meridian passing through their capital city. France published maps with 0Â° longitude running through Paris. Cartographers in China published maps with 0Â° longitude running through Beijing. Even different parts of the same country published materials based on local meridians.\n\nFinally, at an international convention called by U.S. President Chester Arthur in 1884, representatives from 25 countries agreed to pick a single, standard meridian. They chose the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. The Greenwich Meridian became the international standard for the prime meridian.\n\nUTC\n\nThe prime meridian also sets Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC never changes for daylight savings or anything else. Just as the prime meridian is the standard for longitude , UTC is the standard for time. All countries and regions measure their time zones according to UTC.\n\nThere are 24 time zones in the world. If an event happens at 11:00 a.m. in Houston, Texas, United States, it would be reported at 12 p.m. in Orlando, Florida, United States; 4:00 p.m. in Morocco; 9:00 p.m. in Kolkata, India; and 6:00 a.m. in Honolulu, Hawai'i, United States. The event happened at 4:00 p.m. UTC.\n\nThe prime meridian also helps establish the International Date Line. Earth's longitude measures 360Â°, so the halfway point from the prime meridian is the 180Â° longitude line. The meridian at 180Â° longitude is commonly known as the International Date Line. As you pass the International Date Line, you either add a day (going west) or subtract a day (going east.)\n\nHemispheres"
