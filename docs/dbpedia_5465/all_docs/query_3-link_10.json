        "text": "I am surprised that no one mentioned the obvious answer to this question: Entity Framework requires a context before enable-migrations will work. The error message the OP posted suggests that no context was found. Sure, it could be because the package manager console doesn't \"see\" the context--in which case the accepted answer is a possible solution (another solution is one I suggest, below). But a context must exist in the current project (assembly) before any other solutions will work.\n\nWhat does it mean to have a context? It means that there must exist a class in your project that inherits from DbContext (in System.Data.Entity). Here is an example:\n\npublic class MyDbContext : DbContext { public MyDbContext() { } }\n\nBe sure you use\n\nusing System.Data.Entity;\n\nbefore the code above has access to the DbContext class and that you have used NuGet to get Entity Framework 4.1 or later for the current project.\n\nIf all along you had a context but the Package Manager Console just doesn't \"see\" it: In Visual Studio 2013 you don't have to use the -ProjectName switch. Instead, go to the Package Manager Console (it's available in the View | Other Windows list), and look at the two dropdowns that appear at the top of the Package Manager Console dockable window. The first dropdown is for Package Source; the second is for Default Project. If you dropdown the Default Project and select a project in your solution then whatever commands you issue in the Package Manager console will be executed against the selected project.\n\nI created a Class in the Models directory called: myData with the following code:\n\nusing System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Data.Entity; namespace Vidly.Models { public class MyDbContext : DbContext { public MyDbContext() { } } }\n\nrebuilt the app with: control-shift-b\n\nthen ran the following in the nuGet Console:\n\nEnable-Migrations -StartUpProjectName Vidly -ContextTypeName Vidly.Models.MyDbContext -Verbose\n\nthe Console returned:\n\nUsing StartUp project 'Vidly'. Using NuGet project 'Vidly'. Checking if the context targets an existing database... Code First Migrations enabled for project Vidly. Enable-Migrations -StartUpProjectName Vidly -ContextTypeName Vidly.Models.myData -Verbose\n\nAnd the FrameWork created a Migrations directory and wrote a Configuration.cs template in there with the following code:\n\nnamespace Vidly.Migrations { using System; using System.Data.Entity; using System.Data.Entity.Migrations; using System.Linq; internal sealed class Configuration : DbMigrationsConfiguration<Vidly.Models.MyDbContext> { public Configuration() { AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = false; } protected override void Seed(Vidly.Models.MyDbContext context) { // This method will be called after migrating to the latest version. // You can use the DbSet<T>.AddOrUpdate() helper extension method // to avoid creating duplicate seed data. } } }\n\nFollow the below steps to resolve the issue\n\nInstall-Package EntityFramework-IncludePrerelease\n\nor Install entity framework from Nuget Package Manager\n\nRestart visual studio\n\nAfter that I was getting \"No context type was found in assembly\"\n\nTo resolve it - This \"No context\" that mean you need to create class in \"Model\" folder in your app with suffix like DbContext ... like this AppDbContext. There you need to include some library using System.Data.Entity;\n\nusing System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Web; using System.Data.Entity; namespace Oceans.Models { public class MyDbContext:DbContext { public MyDbContext() { } } }\n\nAfter that run the below command on Package Manager:\n\nEnable-Migrations -ProjectName <YourProjectName> -ContextTypeName <YourContextName>\n\nMy Project Name is - MyFirstApp and AppDbContext is inside the Model Folder so path is like\n\nEnable-Migrations -StartUpProjectName MyFirstApp -ContextTypeName MyFirstApp.Models.AppDbContext\n\nI got this problem first: PM> add-migration first\n\nNo migrations configuration type was found in the assembly 'MyProjectName'. (In Visual Studio you can use the Enable-Migrations command from Package Manager Console to add a migrations configuration).\n\nthen i tried this:\n\nPM> Enable-Migrations No context type was found in the assembly 'MyProjectName'.\n\nThen the right command for me :\n\nPM> Enable-Migrations -ProjectName MyProjectName -ContextTypeName MyProjectName.Data.Context\n\nAfter that i got this error message even though Context inherits from DbContext\n\nThe type 'Context' does not inherit from DbContext. The DbMigrationsConfiguration.ContextType property must be set to a type that inherits from DbContext.\n\nThen i Installed Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools\n\nITS OK NOW but the message is funny. i already tried add migrations at first :D\n\nBoth Entity Framework Core and Entity Framework 6 are installed. The Entity Framework Core tools are running. Use 'EntityFramework6\\Enable-Migrations' for Entity Framework 6. Enable-Migrations is obsolete. Use Add-Migration to start using Migrations.\n\nEnsure you are using the same version of Entity Framework across all projects using the NuGet Package Manager.\n\nRecent windows updates may have installed a newer version of Entity Framework into your active project.\n\nBackground: Around 16 Mar 2016, I started getting this error when trying to add migrations to a project where I had already enabled migrations and had successfully done migrations for.\n\nI noticed that around March 10, a new stable version of Entity Framework 6 had been released.\n\nIf I specified the -ContextTypeName parameter in the enable-migrations command, I got an error indicating the migrations were already enabled.\n\nResolution:\n\n1) Tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Manage Nuget Packages for Solution\n\n2) (Not sure if this step is necessary, but..) I updated my version of the Nuget Package Manager to the latest version. Also, after updating my version of Nuget Package Manager, I had to restart Visual Studio twice before the NuGet Command line would work properly.\n\n3) Tools -> Nuget package Manager -> Manage Nuget Packages for Solution -> Search Installed packages -> Type Entity Framework\n\na. You may see more than one version of Entity Framework there.\n\nb. Click Manage on each version of Entity Framework and ensure that your projects are using the SAME version of Entity Framework.\n\nUncheck the version of Entity Framework that you are not using and for the version of Entity Framework you ARE using make sure it is checked across your projects that need it.\n\nAgain, as noted in step 2, I had to restart visual studio twice to get the NuGet Package Manager Console to work properly after updating my version of the NuGet Package Manager. I got an error starting the console the first time, and \"exception calling createinstancefrom with 8 arguments could not load file or assembly EntityFramework\" when running the enable-migrations command the second time.\n\nRestarting visual studio seemed to resolve those issues, however.\n\nI have been getting this same problem. I have even tried above enable migrations even though I have already done. But it keeps giving same error. Then I had to use the force switch to get overcome this problem. I am sure this will help in someone else's case as well as its a possible work around.\n\nAfter enabling migration with force, you should update your database (Make sure default project is set correctly). Otherwise you will get another problem like explicit migrations are pending.\n\nThen just execute your add-migrations or any other commands, it should work.\n\nEnable-Migrations -ProjectName <PROJECT_NAME> -ContextTypeName <FULL_CONTEXT_NAMESPACE.YOUR_CONTEXT_NAME> -force\n\nOPs question was for EF5; I had the same problem with EF6, and my experience was quite similar. Multiple answers here reference EntityFrameworkCore, but using that was a huge misdirect for me.\n\nIt seems many things can cause the OPs error; I think both jazimov and Sadjad Khazaie presented good solutions that are useful for both EF and EFCore. However, when I had EFCore installed alongside EF6, that actually CAUSED this problem. It seems that my existing EF6 codebase was using EF6 migrations, and with EntityFrameworkCore packages installed, I got the No context type was found in the assembly error because the EFCore add-migration command was running.\n\nWhen I removed the EntityFrameworkCore packages, the problem went away.\n\nNote: sometimes I got a warning that both EntityFrameworkCore and EntityFramework were installed when I ran add-migration, but not always. One way to be sure: try enable-migrations, which is available with EntityFramework but is not available (or necessary) with EntityFrameworkCore."
