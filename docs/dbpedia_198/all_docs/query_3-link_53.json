        "text": "Adoption in other cultures and other times provides a background to understanding the operation of adoption in the Roman world. This book considers the relationship of adoption to kinship structures in the Greek and Roman world. It considers the procedures for adoption, followed by a separate analysis of testamentary cases, and the impact of adoption on nomenclature. The impact of adoption on inheritance arrangements is considered, including an account of how the families of freedmen were aﬀected. Its use as a mode of succession in Rome is detailed, and this helps us to understand the anxiety of childless Romans to procure a son through adoption, rather than simply to nominate heirs in their wills. The strategy also had political uses, and importantly it was employed to rearrange natural succession in the imperial family. The book concludes with political adoptions, looking at the detailed case studies of Clodius and Octavian. hu gh lind sa y is Senior Lecturer in Classics at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales.

It has a diﬀerent focus from the work of Olli Salomies (1992), which concerns itself with adoptive and polyonomous nomenclature, with a special focus on the Imperial period. It has some common ground with Jane Gardner’s works, especially Family and Familia in Roman Law and Life (1998), although it is on the whole less legal, and more concerned with the practical operation of adoption in diﬀerent situations. My concern has been with how Romans viewed adoption and what problems they believed it could be used to solve. Some of the same ground is covered by both Salomies and Gardner, but here more space is devoted to the functioning of adoptions in politics and everyday life, and trying to understand how adoption has been utilised in other places and times. Despite extensive use of legal sources to understand the theory behind Roman adoption, the cases discussed are mostly selected from literary sources, since it is here that the functioning of adoption in real situations can be assessed. The onomastic evidence is useful, and the main features of Roman nomenclature after adoption are explored, but by its very nature nomenclature can only provide answers to a restricted range of questions about the impact of adoption. Considerable attention is given to adoption as a mode of succession, utilising primarily legal and literary sources. This is most relevant to the elite and the imperial family, although the legal sources are not so conﬁned, and in both cases raises questions about whether adoptions are being used to serve political rather than familial ends. It is hoped that the material brought together here may be of interest to students of European social history in general as well as to those concentrating on Rome. After some introductory remarks about Roman family life and the extent to which adoption may have been used in the community, the ﬁrst three chapters consider adoption broadly as a strategy, and the use to which it can ix\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nbe put in diﬀerent social, cultural and temporal situations. This represents a revision and expansion of an essay which ﬁrst appeared in S. Dixon, ed., Childhood, Class and Kin in the Roman World (2001) under the title ‘Adoption and its Function in Cross-cultural Contexts’. The nature of Greek and Roman kinship structures is also reviewed, since discussions of the Classical world have been greatly inﬂuenced by now discredited approaches to the development of the family. In the case of Rome, the picture today is of the family still under the theoretical power of the paterfamilias, but the later Republican and early Imperial periods saw greater recognition of the female line and its capacity to continue family interests. Changes in the law of inheritance which take more account of cognate relationships are part of this trend in the period between the second century bc and the second century ad. Fashions in nomenclature also demonstrate these bilateral trends. The treatment of adoption in the Greek world is designed to provide some pertinent background for Roman adoptions, especially testamentary cases. By the mid second century bc the Greek world was under Roman rule, and some inﬂuence on Roman custom can be expected. An earlier version of this study appeared as ‘Adoption in Greek Law: Some Comparisons with the Roman World’ in Newcastle Law Review 3.2 (1999) 91–110. Chapters 4 to 6 discuss what is known of the origins of adoption at Rome and describe the procedures relating to adoption, focusing on the period from the second century bc to the second century ad. Chapter 4, on adoptio and adrogatio, covers the origin and functioning of these institutions at Rome. This includes treatment of age and capacity, aspects of the legal and sexual status of adopters, assimilation and participation of adoptees in the family, guardianship and the adoption of minors, and adoptions of and by women. The procedure for adoptio and adrogatio is described, including sections on the role of the comitia curiata and the investigation by the pontiﬀs. Chapter 5 is devoted to testamentary adoptions and their relationship to other testamentary arrangements. Chapter 6 reviews the eﬀect of these diﬀerent social transformations on individual nomenclature. This presents a review of Roman nomenclature after adoption, with a review of the main ﬁndings of Salomies in his 1992 work. It also treats his simpliﬁed conclusions published in M. Corbier, ed., Adoption et fosterage (1999). Chapters 7 and 8 treat adoption as a strategy for succession. The legal position of adoptees under the civil law and praetorian law is scrutinised and assessed. Both inheritance under a will and intestacy are considered as well as the circumstances under which adoptees could claim under a complaint of an undutiful will. This is a reworking of an essay which ﬁrst appeared as ‘Adoption\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nand Succession in Roman Law’ Newcastle Law Review 3.1 (1998) 57–81. Chapter 8 is devoted to manumission and succession in freedman families with special emphasis on the adrogation of freedmen. In these cases adoption seems to be employed by citizens in order to harness the wealth of freedmen. Chapters 9 to 12 review some of the best-known cases of adrogatio and adoptio amongst the elite where there is suﬃcient evidence to provide a commentary. Examples of testamentary adoptions are also treated, again selectively. Here examples are discussed which seem not to be motivated primarily by politics; the main aim is inheritance. In both groups attention is paid to the proximity between adopter and adoptee. A large number of the cases known involve close kin, often maternal kin. These are often identiﬁable because of transformations in nomenclature. In contrast, adoptions within the agnatic line are hard to track through nomenclature and may be underrepresented in the record. In other cases friends of the family are chosen: some of these may in fact be relatives, but the links are not evident on the basis of the available evidence. In chapters 13 to 16 signiﬁcant political adoptions are discussed. There are special studies of the adoption of Clodius, the adoption of Octavian, and after discussion of the motives behind elite adoption at Rome, Pompeii and Ostia, ﬁnally imperial adoptions. In the study of Clodius, adoption is seen as an institution which can serve a particular political end. Cicero’s analysis in De domo sua, where he outlines his objections to the adoption, is conditioned by his irritation at the advancement of Clodius. He presents an argument which is dependent on thinking about adoption in the domestic sense, but major political players at the time saw no problem in using it quite cynically to acquire the relevant plebeian status for a candidate whose interests they chose to promote. The domestic concerns were shoved aside and eﬀectively ended by the immediate emancipation of Clodius. The case of Octavian may have been inﬂuenced by this precedent. It also involves the use of adoption to secure political ends. Caesar’s murder in 44 bc revealed a will in which Octavian received a large part of Caesar’s estate, as well as his testamentary adoption. The testamentary adoption gave him only limited rights in relation to Caesar, but the adrogation which he orchestrated after entering on his extraordinary consulship on 19 August 43 bc legitimated his access to Caesar’s tribe and ﬁliation, and, just as importantly, presented the succession of Octavian to Caesar’s power as an act willed by the dictator. The parallel with Clodius is that politically interested parties once again supported what was clearly a sham. An adrogation could only take place when the two parties to the adoption were present. It was theoretically not possible for Caesar to adrogate\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nOctavian. Adoptions amongst the elite are often hard to classify, since motives may be partly political, partly merely for inheritance. Inscriptional evidence from Pompeii and Ostia suﬀers from similar problems. The early imperial adoptions are familial adoptions, but involve overtly political ends. Under the Julio-Claudians the façade of a domestic situation was maintained, but the public nature of these adoptions soon became apparent. Imperial adoption was gradually assimilated to designation as imperial successor. Nevertheless, the institution was a useful method of underlining family solidarity and dynastic continuity. The strands are brought together in a conclusion which emphasises both the common thread of ﬁctitious kinship running through the various uses made of adoption and the particular aims that each approach served. Adoption for a Roman, as Cicero emphasises in De domo sua, was about sacra, inheritance and continuation of a name (Cic. Dom. 13.35). As I have mentioned, this study includes developed versions of three papers already published, all signiﬁcantly revised. Two of the papers appeared in the Newcastle Law Review, and I am pleased now to be able to oﬀer them to a wider audience. At a late stage when the text was substantially complete I received a copy of Christiane Kunst’s book (2005). She covers many of the same areas and is interested in a number of the same issues. My material is arranged very diﬀerently from hers, and I have not dealt with the more speculative issue of intra-familial conﬂict treated in the latter part of that book, but I have taken account of her arguments where I could. I am pleased to acknowledge assistance I have had from many quarters in my pursuit of ancient adoption. Several years ago Mireille Corbier, on learning that I was working on adoption, very kindly supplied me with a copy of Adoption et fosterage (1999). Suzanne Dixon was very supportive and helped me to utilise comparative material. The chapter in Childhood, Class and Kin in the Roman World (2001), a volume in honour of Beryl Rawson, provided an opportunity to share some of my ﬁndings, and to contribute to a volume celebrating her contribution to the study of the Roman family. I have now greatly expanded its ambit, and I hope it helps to make sense of Roman adoptions. Thanks also to Tim Parkin and to my colleagues at Newcastle, especially Elizabeth Baynham, Jane Bellemore, Terry Ryan and Harold Tarrant. I would also like to thank Brian Bosworth for commenting on an early version of my chapter on Greek adoptions. The readers for Cambridge University Press provided useful criticism of a ﬁrst draft of the text and I hope that the revised version meets with their approval. Thanks also to my wife, Kate, and son, Leo, for their patience.\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAbbreviations of titles of ancient works correspond to those used in the Oxford Classical Dictionary, ed.

In general, the idea is that people with a strong commitment to raising children will be able to take over children whose situation is in some way substantially impaired. In the recent past, relatively large numbers of unwanted children became available in this way. An element that has changed is the attitude to sole parenting, and children resulting from unplanned pregnancies are more often retained than adopted out. Community attitudes have shifted considerably, and it is now seen as psychologically desirable for the child to be brought up in its birth family, if possible, rather than to be reassigned. The result is that adoptees have to be sought from further away, from parts of the world where it is economically impossible for the birth family to bring up the child, or where social conditions, including famine and war, have created large numbers of orphans. Children brought in under these conditions raise complex issues such as the paternalism of rich countries, which lead on to other controversies, for example the cultural displacement of the children. Rome from its inception was a diﬀerent type of community, and conditions of family life diﬀered substantially. The presence of slaves as well as an enormous gulf between rich and poor is only a beginning. This was a high-mortality regime, in which children would often lose one or both parents early, and likewise hazards of childhood diseases were a tough proposition. Agrippina the Elder provides us with a case where most of the facts about a large Roman family are known. Altogether Agrippina had nine children of whom six survived to adulthood. These were produced in a period of approximately thirteen years, between ad 5 and 18 (Lindsay [1995] 4–5), by a mother who was between about eighteen and thirty-one. In this case, a third of her family never reached maturity. She was typical of the aristocracy in making extensive use of wet nurses (Treggiari [1975b] 56; Bradley [1986] 1\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\n2\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\n210; 221; Lindsay [1995] 12–14). This underlines features of upbringing at Rome, which may often have led to parents being disconnected from the process, and in other cases early death of a partner must have been commonplace. Miscarriages and wives less fortunate with their health than Agrippina are on record. Quintilian’s young wife, dead at eighteen, after bearing two children, is an example (Quint. Inst. 6 pr. 4). Other features of the society are also distinctive. Both infanticide and abandonment of children show that not all children were reared or thought worth rearing (Boswell [1984]; B. Rawson [2003] 114–18). While some abandoned children will have been retrieved, reasons for abandonment might not be merely economic; the emperor Claudius exposed Claudia, the daughter of his wife, Urgulanilla, by the freedman Boter, in order to disavow paternity (Suet. Claud. 27). Not all children were equally valued. There has, however, been some toning down in recent years of ideas about the prevalence of infanticide (B. Rawson [2003] 115–17). Pliny is an example of a childless man who never managed to rectify his childless state despite three marriages. His attitudes to the advantages of having descendants, which concentrate on questions of continuity and prestige, appear in a letter to his wife’s grandfather Calpurnius Fabatus, after the loss of a child (Plin. Ep. 8.10). Although in this case he blames Calpurnia for lack of care during her pregnancy, fertility was something of a problem in the family. His uncle, the elder Pliny, was forced to resort to adoption, adopting Pliny himself. Several modern studies have concluded that the elite at Rome had serious problems with achieving continuity. Conditions of life in the Roman family gave the male partner extraordinary powers to determine the shape of his family, and there are few signs of couples working together to settle on suitable candidates for adoption. Altogether we have few female voices from the ancient world, and little chance of reconstructing female attitudes to family life. The extended absences of Roman males abroad may have created further problems and encouraged or reinforced the development of an ethos where little account was taken of the female viewpoint, and recourse to adoption at Rome may have been commonest in cases where a male has survived his partner or partners. how common was adoption at rome? Estimates of the number of adoptees at Rome are usually based on questions of nomenclature, but nomenclature is very ﬂuid, and nomenclature which appears to be adoptive can be explained in other ways (Chapter 6 below).\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nNevertheless some general guidelines may be helpful. Keith Hopkins, in reviewing consuls between 350 bc and ad 50, estimated that 4 per cent were adopted (Hopkins [1983] 49). Moreau reports that under 2 per cent of equestrians from the Julio-Claudian period were found to be adopted in a study by Ségolène Demougin, while the rather larger ﬁgure of 8–9 per cent of magistrates and decurions at Pompeii were identiﬁed as adoptees by Jean Andreau (Moreau [1992] 13). These ﬁgures are all drawn from elite groups where questions of inheritance and position were most important, and where the strongest results can be expected. This study aims to look at adoption synoptically, and to attempt to understand the motives of Roman adopters. Succession for the childless male seems to have been a common problem, but the institution had a much larger ambit, which included political and other social objectives.\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nchapter 1\n\nAdoption, kinship and the family: cross-cultural perspectives\n\nA broad survey of adoption across cultural boundaries will reveal how diﬀerent historical and contemporary communities have responded to the issue of introducing outsiders into their kinship network. This impressionistic account will attempt to comment on how issues of integration are handled in a wide range of contexts, under markedly diﬀerent arrangements regarding kinship. There is no attempt here to see kinship in evolutionary terms, or even to suggest direct comparability between the various communities surveyed. They have been chosen on the basis that they represent distinctive and potentially illuminating responses to particular kinship arrangements. It is hoped that this discussion will help an appreciation of how the Romans used the institution. Other agnatic systems may superﬁcially resemble the Roman one, at least in this strong emphasis on the perpetuation of the male line, but even communities with very strict customary procedures tend to ﬁnd that factors other than mere kinship are important in selecting adoptees when their own line is in jeopardy. Rome undoubtedly ﬁts this model. All adoptions create a ﬁctitious proximate relationship for the purpose of inheritance of wealth, position or both. The adopter will in turn expect reciprocal obligations of some sort. These range from taking on the mantle of heir to emotional and physical support. Diﬀerent communities with diﬀerent social and political systems handle the details in diﬀerent ways. Once a community allows that adoption is a feasible way of bestowing social personality on the next generation, purely familial ties are potentially under threat. An outsider may be the only possibility for adoption. Nevertheless in a majority of communities preference still lies with close kin. Traditional Chinese communities have the strictest regulations about adoption from amongst close agnates, but other communities also ﬁnd that this is the normal place to look for an heir. A conﬂicting pressure is totally to assimilate the adopted child into the adoptive family, and this tends to make 4\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n5\n\noutsiders seem attractive. Completely ﬁctitious arrangements, where the intention is simply to transfer property, and where the motives may be based far more on commercial objectives, are also found. Less emphasis on close kinship can be anticipated. Here the inalienability of certain types of property in Mesopotamia is a key example. Goody in his inﬂuential article ‘Adoption in Cross-cultural Perspective’ (1969, reprinted with some changes 1976) does not include this type of arrangement but does raise several deﬁnitive functions of adoption: 1. To provide homes for orphans, bastards, foundlings, and children of impaired families. 2. To provide childless couples with social progeny. 3. To provide an individual or couple with an heir to their property (Goody [1976] 68). His categories provide some guidelines for the scope of adoptive arrangements. The following outline illustrates some of the range of possibilities encompassed in varied cultural and temporal environments. mesopotamia The population mix in Mesopotamia at the beginning of the second millennium was Semitic and Sumerian. The earliest dynasty at Babylon was founded by Semites, but the people represented a blending of Semitic and Sumerian culture (Oates [1979] 19). Sophisticated arrangements for adoptions are already to be found in the Code of Hammurabi (1792–1750 bc), which provides material regulating entry to the family generically similar to some of the Roman legal material. The Code dates from late in his reign, apparently after the thirty-eighth year of the reign (van de Mieroop [2005] 100). The arrangements outlined show a close awareness of some of the hazards of the artiﬁcial creation of parental bonds. An adopted child could be treated diﬀerently from a natural child, or one party could prove ill suited to the other, and maternal deprivation was recognized as a danger. A child might persist in seeking out its natural father and mother, and consequently have to be returned to them. These provisions amount to an admission of the reality that child and adoptive family may not be mutually suited. Adoptees are envisaged as infants, and this marks out a major diﬀerence from the Roman norm. The adoption of children appears to be a rarity at Rome. The Code of Hammurabi also encompassed harsh and diﬀerent rules for those adopted by courtiers (Benet [1976] 23–5). Roman legal writers never mention the possibility of an adoption’s failing, nor anything comparable to the harsh regulation of some adoptees in Babylon.\n\n6\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nTo summarise, Babylonian adoption remained valid only if the adopter treated the child in every way as his own. If the child persisted in searching out its father and mother, it was returned to its natural parents. Thus the issue of maternal deprivation was acknowledged and dealt with. The only adoptive child who was punished for seeking out the natal family was one adopted by a courtier, since courtiers were prevented by law and sometimes by castration from begetting their own children. The adoption was seen as a signal honour, and since it represented a great leap in status for the child, it was not reversible: 187 The [adopted] son of a chamberlain or the [adopted] son of an epicene shall not be [re]claimed … If the [adopted] son of an epicene states to the father who has brought him up or the mother who has brought him up ‘Thou art not my father’ [or] ‘Thou art not my mother’, they shall cut out his tongue. (Driver and Miles [1955] 75–7)\n\nLower-status adoptions are also covered in the Code, and consequently there is a discussion of apprenticeship and wet-nursing. Boys were adopted by free craftsmen to learn and inherit their trade, but the adoption was invalid if the craftsman did not teach his craft. Because of the age of adoptees, any adopter was likely to need a wet nurse, who would be in charge of the child for two or three years. Her conduct was strictly monitored and she was subjected to ﬁerce penalties if the child died under her care (her breasts were to be cut oﬀ: Code 194). The use of adoption in Mesopotamia has been seen as evolving from an initial concern to perpetuate the family and its religious rites, to a later stage when secular reasons are clearly important. Whatever is thought of the evolutionary model, there is evidence for these secular concerns. Passing on a trade, continuation of business, or maintenance in old age can all be included under this category. Adoption was perhaps still possible for a man who already had a son. Elizabeth Stone adds ‘ﬁctive’ adoption to these more traditional types of adoption in Mesopotamian society (Stone and Owen [1991] 2–6). This was used as a method of property transfer in a situation where property was theoretically inalienable (Cassin [1938] 1–48). In these cases no parent–child relationship was implied between the two parties. The ﬁctive adoption texts from Nuzi (near Kirkuk) date from the mid second millennium bc (perhaps between 1475 and 1350 bc: Cassin [1938] 7). These serve to transfer real estate when ﬁelds and orchards could only be disposed of within a very narrow range of close kin. Some individuals were ‘adopted’ up to 120 times, which serves to demonstrate that these cannot be conventional adoptions (Cassin\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n7\n\n[1938] 16–17). Obligations to provide food and clothing to the adopter are recorded, but not the more intimate obligation to provide for the adopter’s funeral (Cassin [1938] 37). Again, at Rome precise obligations of adoptees in relation to support and maintenance are not enumerated in legal authorities, since much of this was regulated at a domestic level. Patria potestas ensured that the adopter was in a very strong position ﬁnancially. Stone points out that use of a ﬁctive relationship in this way is itself a sign of a system under siege, and it seems to represent an evolution in the employment of adoption, already at this early date. All adoptions create ﬁctive relationships, but here it appears that traditional practices were serving new functions and fulﬁlling new societal needs. The types of adoption described by Goody, which are designed to redress deﬁcits in family make-up, may be termed ‘familial’ adoptions, and, in contrast, those at Nuzi are primarily motivated by economic concerns. These are termed by Elizabeth Stone ‘economic’ adoptions. However, Goody’s categories have an economic dimension as well. The composition and economic circumstances of an individual family would have had some impact on the decision to alienate property through the dodge attested in the Nuzi texts. Fictitious adoptions are found in Rome under very diﬀerent conditions; the classic example is that of the Republican politician Clodius, who used adoption to change from patrician to plebeian status so that he was eligible for the tribunate (see Chapter 14 below). Both at Babylon and at Rome, in these cases adoption serves to give the adoptee the requisite status to achieve an identiﬁable social goal.\n\nTypes of adoption at Nippur The socioeconomic system at Nippur has to be grasped to understand the role of adoption in this society. As at Nuzi, there were restrictions on the alienation of real estate which applied especially to ﬁeld property, and thus ﬁelds and orchards could only be disposed of within a very narrow range of close kin. House purchases were not quite so constrained. Temple oﬃces were similarly heritable but not alienable before about 1800 bc. When they did become alienable few restrictions appear to have been applicable, but they could only be purchased by a person whose inheritance had already made him into a property owner. Nippur had a very important temple of Enlil, the principal deity of the Mesopotamian pantheon, which gave both the city and the temple particular status, no doubt important to the developments under consideration (Oates [1979] 27–8).\n\n8\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nThe restrictions on alienability themselves seem to stem from the idea of communal land ownership by kinship groups. Gradually and within the documented period this ideology had to coexist with a system of individual land registration. All adoptions have elements of both the social and economic attached to them, but at Nippur what is signiﬁcant is that the adoptions are known to us through contracts; in other words, they were only recorded as part of the process of protecting economic rights, and our knowledge thus reﬂects the peculiarities of record keeping at Nippur. The contracts from Nippur are not uniform but they are all witnessed, dated and sealed (dates between 1873 and 1721 bc: tabulated in Stone and Owen [1991] 4). The general format is a statement of adoption followed by a discussion of the settlements in cash or property through inheritance. The adopter may receive an adoption payment. This is often followed by a section in which the penalties for breaking the contract are spelled out. Finally, either before or after the oath, before or after the witness list, the text may describe the monthly and annual rations which are to be delivered by the adoptee to support his new father until his death. There are some twenty-ﬁve Old Babylonian Nippur adoption contracts, which are divided by Stone into four diﬀerent categories. In some instances the parties to the adoption can be given a wider context as a result of surviving documentation of further contractual activity: 1. A man alone adopts one or more sons. This is the most common and is found across the full range of the texts, which span two centuries. In all except two texts the adopted son(s) receives an inheritance in exchange for a contribution to the future support of the adoptive father. There appear to be no penalty clauses such as threat of slavery or disinheritance if he does not comply. This type is closest to the Roman norm. 2. A man and his wife adopt one or more sons. In this type the wife joins her husband as the adopter. In these instances there is never any clause in which the adopted son promises support to his adoptive parents in their old age, although property inheritance is always a feature of these adoptions. It is deduced that in these instances the parenting aspects of adoption are dominant, something never encountered in the surviving Roman evidence. 3. The sons from a previous marriage are adopted by the new spouse. These consist of adoptions which are associated with a second marriage. Marriage texts which do not treat adoptions are rare, and the record of the marriage appears to be made only because of the adoption. In an instance where the father is the surviving parent of the adoptive sons, they have to promise to contribute to the support of their stepmother in\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n9\n\nher old age. When it is the mother who contracts a second marriage, the treatment for her sons depends on her status. If she were to be sold into slavery in a case of divorce, then her sons would be in jeopardy of like treatment. The main aim behind these adoptions appears to have been to restructure the families in a manner consistent with the new marital arrangements. A high-proﬁle Roman example is the adoption of his stepson Tiberius by the emperor Augustus in ad 4. 4. A woman alone is the adopter (probable) or the adoptee. Adoptions involving women are very hard to appreciate. Badly damaged tablets make it hard to determine the identity of the adopter and adoptee. In most cases one of the participants was a naditu or unmarried votary; she could be expected to be the adopter on analogy with texts from Sippar (R. Harris [1975]; Stone [1982] 50–70). In these cases she would nominate a girl who could follow her calling and inherit her property. Unlike at Sippar, the other participants in the transactions are all either men or married women. None of these could have become a naditu. So adoption is used diﬀerently from at Sippar, but the fragmentary state of the record precludes exactitude. Of course this category is quite out of keeping with anything found at Rome, where adopters had to be males capable of exercising patria potestas. Types 1 and 2 reﬂect contrasting socioeconomic relations between the adopter and adoptee. Type 1 places emphasis on immediate economic gain for the adopter, while type 2 is centred more on the nurturing aspect of the parent–child relationship. In type 1 texts penalty clauses tend to be identical for both parties, or property is held hostage for support, or in one instance the adopter stands to lose more if he breaks the contract. In type 2 either the penalty clauses are equal or the adoptees are threatened with slavery if they break the contract. Thus the adopters appear to have the advantage – quite diﬀerent from type 1. Penalty clauses are clear indicators of diﬀerent relationships between adopter and adoptee; expected levels of support provide a barometer for these penalty clauses. In the Mesopotamian situation adoption could be manipulated to the point where economic motives became paramount. At its best it served to mediate between the social needs of some and the political and economic needs of others. If economic and political ambitions are once allowed into the adoption process, it is only a short step to make them the actual basis of the transaction. This is illustrated by the archive of Mannum-mesu-lissur, dating to about 1739 bc. This is a case of a wealthy individual lacking property. Apparently he used his family’s wealth as an opportunity for social mobility. He had no real estate but was able to purchase an adoption from a\n\n10\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nﬁnancially troubled but established family. The consequences for them were serious: the sons were demoted but expected to be eventual heirs to the adoptee – an expectation which was apparently never realized. Important details remain obscure (Stone and Owen [1991] 19–23). india Goody warns of the complexity of the Indian situation and the impact of nineteenth-century thinking on interpretation ([1976] 73). Ideas about Indo-European unity and the evolution of European culture were at that time inﬂuential, and similarities to the civilizations of Greece and Rome tended to be exaggerated. It is still an interesting case to review, but caution is in order. Certain general tendencies in India can be noted, although regional and religious diﬀerences must have led to many variations in practice. We might expect adoption to be more common in communities which frowned upon the remarriage of widows or in other ways curtailed alternative methods of securing succession. Hindu law shows that the chief aim of adoption was maintenance of the ancestral line (Mayne [1898] 123). An adopted boy should be the closest possible male relative: if feasible, a brother’s son. If no male was available, the next best solution was a son of a family following the same spiritual adviser as the adopting family. Here the spiritual connection took the place of the blood tie. Some idea of procedure can be gleaned from the dharmasûtra of Vasishtha (Bühler [1882] 75–6): xv.6 He who desires to adopt a son shall assemble his kinsmen, announce his intention to the king, make burnt oﬀerings in the middle of the house, reciting the Vyâhritis, and take (as a son) a not remote kinsman, just the nearest among his relatives.\n\nInterestingly, the adopted son was only partially protected from the birth of subsequent legitimate children, and the same text shows that in that event his share would be reduced to one-quarter (Bühler [1882] 76): xv.9 If after an adoption has been made, a legitimate son be born, (the adopted son) shall obtain a fourth part.\n\nThe reduction in the adoptee’s share can be compared with a like provision in the Gortyn Code. Under the Laws of Manu, twelve types of son were enumerated, and this reveals the emphasis on acquiring sons by whatever means possible. This did not mean that there was no pecking order – quite the reverse – primacy\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n11\n\nwent to the child born of two spouses of the same caste. An adoptee was also to be of the same caste as adopter and should bear a resemblance to or be a reﬂection of a natural son (Tambiah [1974] 81). It is also noteworthy that there is emphasis not merely on capacity to continue religious duties to the adopter after his decease, but also on identifying a worthy successor to the social personality of the adopter. Also of interest is the exclusion of the adopted son from inheritance in his natal family (the situation at Rome became increasingly complex as certain rights within the natal family were acknowledged under the inﬂuence of praetorian law: see Chapter 7). This is made quite explicit in the Laws of Manu (Bühler [1886] 355): ix.141 Of the man who has an adopted son possessing all good qualities that same son shall take the inheritance, though brought from another family. ix.142 An adopted son shall never take the family name and estate of his natural father.\n\nAll this shows the primacy of the family as corporate identity. An outstanding feature of this world is the lack of permeability in barriers between castes. Status is very carefully monitored within this system. At Rome too adoption was essentially between persons of similar caste. oceania In Oceania adoption is used far more casually than at Rome, and often the arrangement seems closer to fostering. Children were circulated as part of the process of building kinship ties. Preference here is for adopting the child of a relative or friend rather than a child of unknown parentage. Reasons include fear that a child of unknown parentage might have the character ﬂaws of its parents. Such a child was seen as an aﬀront to the kin group through their failure to ﬁnd their own solution to the child’s inadequacies. The adopter will usually be one of the natural parent’s siblings or parents. Oceanic adoption is not characterised by formal legal procedures. Normally it is an individual who adopts, rather than a couple. The adopter is normally married and will often have existing children. Adoption is frequent and adopters are less fussy about the physical attributes of the child. Sometimes a child is even adopted before it is born. Nevertheless, the social attributes of the child’s natural parents are of importance to Oceanic adopters. Adoption is not denied on economic grounds and the like; there is no kudos in adopting, no stigma in giving in adoption. Rather it is seen as an act of generosity. Most parents giving up children in adoption are ready, willing and able to keep their children (Carroll [1970] 3–20).\n\n12\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nThis type of close-kin arrangement is not replacement of one set of parents by another, but a new layer of kinship obligations, and the adoptions are reversible. A typical example can be found amongst the Kamano villagers of the Eastern Highlands of New Guinea. As elsewhere in Oceania, the commonest adoptions do not involve orphans or provision of children for the childless. The norm is for adults with children to adopt children who have parents. The adoptee ends up with two rightful homes throughout life, and there is no total severance of ties with the natal family, similar to the situation with the sons of Aemilius Paullus. This may be considered of interest for comparison with Rome, despite the profoundly diﬀerent social organisation; the intention of securing access to inheritance of wealth or position may have meant that it was common for an adult Roman, too, to enter an adoption while retaining links with the natal family. Amongst the Kamano, however, children are taken from the natural mother at the earliest possible moment, either immediately or as soon as the child may safely be weaned. The aim of this is to achieve loyalty and commitment to the adopting family. In Rome substantial ﬁnancial and/or political beneﬁts may have been thought to ensure commitment. In both societies it can be expected that tensions continued to exist between the competing interests of natal and adopting family. Kamano adoptions often involve a demonstration of aﬀection between friends and relatives. An unusual feature is the very private nature of the transactions, although the adoptee is informed of natal identity. The commonest adopters are matrilineal kin, and after adoption the incest taboo against relations with natal kin is operational. More precision on the reasons for the relatively free exchange of oﬀspring amongst the Kamano has proved elusive (Mandeville [1981] 229–44). On Kosrae Island many of the same features can be found, but there are some diﬀerences. After agreement between parents and the adopter, the adoptee will normally move to reside with the adopter. The expectation is that adoptees, who are usually infants, will in due course help, obey and care for the adopter, and in return will gain a share of the adopter’s land when it is divided. Natural parents seem to retain stronger control over their oﬀspring than amongst the Kamano. Thus mutual support continues to be expected, and adoptive children in return expect their natural parents to provide them with land, unless they have been thoroughly catered for by the adopting parent. The same taboo on incestuous relations with members of the natural family is maintained, and, although there is no absolute taboo on relations within the adopting family, such relationships are frowned on as contrary to the spirit of the adoptive relationship. As amongst the Kamano, there is no attempt to hide the genealogical identity of the adopted\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n13\n\nindividual, and this must remain an important consideration in order to avoid incest problems. Motives for asking for children can be diﬀerentiated from those of the Kamano, where adoption follows the more general Paciﬁc trend of providing a means of testing and asserting kinship ties. Here sterility is a factor, and it is statistically clear that most mature adults who do not have children do eventually adopt. Children are seen as a desirable commodity for labour, economic well-being and companionship. Despite this, the norm is not to choose a child who is already of an age to be of assistance. Subjects for adoption include illegitimates and children from parents who have closely spaced children or very large families. On Kosrae Island residence with the adopter is not always an essential component of these relationships. Here an elderly person may be incapable of caring for a small child. The idea behind adoption in these cases may be to gain eventual support in the event of sickness or a more general need for continued care (Ritter [1981] 45–61). On Kosrae many adoptees eventually return to live permanently with their natural parents, and the adoptive relationship is terminated. This may reﬂect the diﬃculties Kosraean adopters have in winning over adoptees on a permanent basis, and the pressures generated by the continuing relationship with the natal family. Sometimes this can be perceived as a problem even in instances where the best ﬁnancial interests of the adoptee would be served by staying with the adopter. In Oceania some of the relationships which have been analysed as adoptions may be better seen as mere fosterage. The distinctions are often ﬁne. There is no doubt that the functioning of Oceanic kin groups is very unusual and should be carefully diﬀerentiated from European societies. japan Japan and China are both of interest for comparison with Rome because of the strong interest in agnatic descent, although other features, especially political developments, proceeded along very diﬀerent lines. Family name and hierarchy are closely interconnected in Japan as well as in other oriental contexts. In China the surname was supposed to be immutable and hence there was close guarding of adoptive possibilities (Waltner [1990] 11). Adoption was not restricted in Japan to those of the same surname. In Japan promising young men were adopted by families with no sons or those whose sons possessed only minor talent (the Japanese household [the ie] was seen as a corporate unit rather than a blood one). Adoption by a prominent family was potentially a signiﬁcant way of bettering one’s status. The key\n\n14\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nseems to be the furthering of the interests of the adopting group – for kinship, friendship, spiritual aﬃnity or ability. With Japanese adoptions there was no restriction preventing an adopted child from himself engaging in adoption. In Tokugawa Japan (1600–1868) adoption was regarded as a method of encompassing social mobility in a society in which status was generally seen as hereditary (Moore [1970] 617). This was particularly the case with samurai families and has been linked explicitly with the need for fresh blood within the ruling class, in a system which generally frowned upon social mobility. Adoption in Japan allowed a measure of ﬂexibility in a system which might otherwise have become closed and decayed. The socioeconomic background of adopted sons in relation to the adopting families was crucial. Also signiﬁcant was the impact of adoption on the life and expectations of the adoptees. Firstly, it is clear that the norm was adoption from within the samurai class; there were sometimes diﬀerences of status within the class, but it seems to have been rare for adoptees to be taken in from signiﬁcantly lower status groups. The problem does not seem to have been low fertility throughout the whole samurai group; rather, that surplus sons from some samurai families were being redistributed through adoption. Nevertheless, biological continuity of samurai families has been considered only a part of the problem. The adopted son might achieve the status otherwise reserved for his elder brother, and thus become head of a samurai family. This behaviour may also help an understanding of adoption in the Roman elite, although extant examples often do not reveal much about the relative status of the parties: in elite families ﬁne distinctions regarding the family record in obtaining honores were important. In Japan the adoptee might also be from a family of lower social status than the adopter, a further aspect of his social elevation. Thus an artiﬁcial method of generating continuity within the family preserved the outward impression that the samurai class operated on an entrenched hereditary principle. An alternative avenue of advancement for younger sons helped to alleviate some of the internal pressures for change within the samurai system. Where an adoptee could not be found from the same stratum as the adopting family, there was a preference for higher-status candidates. Social mobility for an adopted son was, in this case, more likely to be to his disadvantage in social terms. In compensation he would in due course become head of his new family. However, it was normal to remain within the same stratum, and this was encouraged by laws requiring the adoption of agnates. Failing this, the next in line were more distant relatives of the same social standing. Other strategies might meet with disapproval.\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n15\n\nThe only real reason for going outside the family was the ill health or incompetence of available family representatives, and only after the possibility of adopting more distant kin had been thoroughly explored would the search extend beyond the lineage. It is interesting to note some changes brought about by the introduction of Confucian tradition into Tokugawa Japan. The main rival was Buddhism. I. J. McMullen has dealt with diﬀerences between contemporary Japanese practice and the Confucian norm, which included a prohibition on nonagnatic adoption. A primary diﬀerence between the societies was in the basic unit of Japanese society, the ie. Chinese Confucian kinship was based on the agnatic principle, and recognised patrilineal descent as the only legitimate means of perpetuating a family line. Therefore adoption of a non-agnatic heir was condemned as immoral. In the Japanese ie the agnatic principle was weaker, and the question of succession could be determined in a more ﬂexible manner. Nevertheless social mobility in Japan was curtailed by the rigid emphasis on hereditary occupation. The ie can be seen as a corporate rather than a kinship unit, where value was placed less on perpetuation of blood from father to son than on perpetuation of the family as a corporate group through its name and occupation. Thus in Japan it was at least possible to resort to adoption of a non-agnatic relative – or even a totally unrelated person. The Confucian prohibition would create extinctions of families, and in Samurai society this would result in conﬁscation of hereditary oﬃce and emoluments (McMullen [1975] 134–5). McMullen also notes that political structure was very important. Tokugawa Japan was still a feudal society at this stage, unlike China. The consequences of extinction of a feudal house were severe because the Samurai depended on reciprocal obligations to great feudal houses. If a house were to fail to produce an heir, the livelihood of its dependents would be thrown into jeopardy. Adoption could avert disaster. Conﬂict between the Confucian system and existing norms was inevitable. The threat was both to the ie and to the wider feudal society. Signiﬁcantly the Confucian prohibition on non-agnatic adoption took its origin in the ancient Chinese cult of ancestor worship. Where the great head of a clan had no natural heir to succeed to the ritual headship of the family and continue sacriﬁces to his parents after his own death, it was prescribed that a son from a cadet branch, provided he was not himself heir to the ritual headship of his own branch, could be adopted to succeed the great head. These adoptions were restricted to those descended through the male line from a common ancestor and sharing the same surname. Sacriﬁces oﬀered from any other person were thought of as a form of impiety.\n\n16\n\nAdoption in the Roman World china\n\nAdoption in China has been linked to the bias towards male heirs. Adopted sons have a favoured status comparable to that of a natural son, and this is closely linked to ancestor worship, which in this agnatic society is the responsibility of the male heir (Ahern [1973]). Careful distinctions were made in China between those children who were adopted from agnates as compared with those adopted from nonagnates. In some cases there was a prohibition on adopting a male child from a non-agnate. If no agnate could be found who was willing to surrender one of his sons, it might be permitted. A distinction was always made between boys adopted from within the lineage and those taken from outside (Wolf and Huang [1980] 108, discussing the period 1845–1945). There was some regional diﬀerence in the severity of the rules. It was not uncommon for people to prefer to adopt from outside the lineage, even though this met with some disapproval (the idea of adopting on grounds of virtue and sentiment was felt to be inferior) (Wolf and Huang [1980] 204). J. L. Watson in his discussion of adoption practices of the Man lineage in Hong Kong found that the Mans usually tried to adopt a son of a close agnate or, failing that, to buy a boy from a stranger ([1975] 293–306). That is, they avoided adopting boys from agnates who were not close relatives (Wolf and Huang [1980] 209). This is a little puzzling since, in order to have his son accepted as a member of the lineage, the man who adopted from outside had to give a banquet for all the lineage elders, at which the guests would do their best to insult the host on the subject of his inability to produce children, would berate him as they left for deﬁling the lineage and would complain about the miserable food. Watson claims that they endure this because of concern about the loyalty of the adopted son. Because brothers and ﬁrst cousins usually live together there is little danger of conﬂict over rights in an adopted son. Beyond this level there is always some danger that the natal family may try to reclaim the boy. The Man lineage members would try to get such a child from as far away as possible as protection against later claims. This kind of advantage was appreciated in Hai-shan, where a dealer as part of his sales pitch placed emphasis on the contention that when the child he had available grew up he would never ﬁnd his real parents, because they lived so far away. Another view opposed to that of Watson is that close agnates cannot be avoided under the lineage rules amongst the Mans. In Hai-shan it should be expected that most adopted children would come from outside the lineage (since there was no insistence here on taking close agnates). Buying from a\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n17\n\nstranger only had the disadvantage of the price paid in compensation (Wolf and Huang [1980] 210–11). Clearly Watson is right in thinking that a major goal is to cut oﬀ the boys from their natal family and to bind them to their foster family. This approach has some impact on the normal age for adoption, which is very young. Wolf and Huang identify several forms of adoption corresponding to these diﬀerences of status. The Royal Commission appointed to investigate the mui tsai problem in Hong Kong and Malaysia discussed the various statuses (mui tsai were a kind of marginal family member: young girls taken into families with a virtually servile status). The commission found that if a son adopted is an agnate, the transfer is called shing kai, or taking over the succession, or kwo tsz, or going over to be heir, or going over to the sacra. Contrast the adoption of cognates, kwai tsung, or returning to stock. The adopted son who is a stranger is known as yeung tsz, a sort of foster son (Wolf and Huang [1980] 108). Similar classiﬁcations can be found in Hai-shan. A male child adopted from an agnate was called ke-pang-kia, that is, a child passed from one branch of a descent group to another. The child had to have been adopted from a close agnate. A ke-pang-kia assumed all the rights and duties of a son with respect to his foster parents, including the right to inherit a share of their property and the duty to support them in their old age and worship their souls after death. But surprisingly the ke-pang-kia did not sever his relationship with his natural parents. This was not merely informal. He addressed them as father and mother, contributed to their support, mourned when they died, made oﬀerings to their souls and, in return, commonly inherited a share of their estate. They were said to ‘suck from two tits’, that is, they drew support from two lines of descent (Wolf and Huang [1980] 108–9). No such formal retention of links with the natal family can be found in the Roman context. In some instances in China payment was made for a boy adopted from an agnate although larger amounts were paid for children with a diﬀerent surname. But in Hai-shan it was not usual to ask for compensation for a child taken by a recognised agnate. Adoption would only be commercialised when the parties were strangers or distant relatives who no longer observed the formalities of kinship. Again the nature of the exchange in the Roman context is quite distinct. It seems most unlikely that this was ever seen as a commercial transaction as such; rather, the emphasis was on the exchange of social and political beneﬁts. In China this may also be seen as a reﬂection of the poor economic standing of the parties. In Hai-shan, unlike certain other Chinese communities, the pressure to adopt an agnate\n\n18\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nwas not there. It was one of the more liberal communities. People who wanted to adopt could take any child they could ﬁnd and those who wanted to sell one of their sons were free to seek the best price. This was the rule of the market place, not kinship ties. Adopted children were often bought from dealers who might have come from afar; this increased the price paid (because of the wider, non-localised market) but also meant that a child who was sold would raise a better price (Wolf and Huang [1980] 204). A purchased child was given the status of bieng-lieng-kia. In contrast with the ke-pang-kia, the bieng-lieng-kia broke all ties with his natal family and became the exclusive property of his foster family. There was total relinquishment of the former identity. The term bieng-lieng-kia itself had an interesting origin, as related by Lu Hsun in Ch‘un mo hsien-t’an (Idle Thoughts at the End of Spring) and passed on by Wolf and Huang ([1980] 110): The old folk informed me that the slender-waisted wasp was the sphex mentioned in the old classics, who, since all spheges are female, must adopt bollworms [bienglieng] to carry on her line. This wasp imprisons the green caterpillar in her nest, while she herself raps and taps outside day and night, praying: ‘Be like me! Be like me!’ Then after a certain number of days – I forget exactly how many, but probably seven times seven – the caterpillar turns into a slender-waisted wasp. That is why the Book of Songs says: ‘The bollworm’s young is carried oﬀ by the sphex.’ This bollworm is the green caterpillar found on mulberry trees.\n\nBoth classes of adoptee would wear mourning for their foster parents but ideally a bieng-lieng-kia did not even attend his natal parents’ funerals (Wolf and Huang [1980] 111). This was something the natal family could not expect once they had sold their son. The term which corresponds to kwai tsung in the mui tsai report is not immediately obvious and it has been doubted whether any distinction is made in Hai-shan between classes of non-agnate adoptee. All might have been included under the category bieng-lieng-kia. But it is suggested that this is not the right solution – a child adopted from an aﬃne is called ciengkia, a gift child (Wolf and Huang [1980] 109–12). Goody has argued for a narrow deﬁnition of adoption, which allows only those instances where the subject is ranked as the child of its adopters and ceases to be the child of its parents. This is restrictive for the Chinese situation, since it would not include ke-pang-kia. A case can be made for including instances in which rights over a child are divided between two parties (Wolf and Huang [1980] 113).\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n19\n\nAdopting women In China women are not valued in the same way as men as family members. When exposure of children was accepted practice, far more women than men were exposed. In late Imperial China, this is illustrated by the following extract from Adele Fielde’s observation of the situation in the 1870s, cited by Wolf and Huang ([1980] 230): The decision whether any more girls are wanted is usually made in the family before the child’s birth, and an undesired girl is stiﬂed by the mother, father, or grandmother, as soon as her sex is known. A neighbor of one of my Bible-women bore six daughters successively, and smothered ﬁve of them. When the sixth came, she said it was always the same girl coming back, and she could no longer endure her. She wanted boys, and would see whether that girl could be deterred from again presenting herself. She cut the child into minute particles, and scattered them over the rice-ﬁelds.\n\nIn modern times prediction of the sex of children has been possible and far more girls have been terminated than their male counterparts (North China) (Wolf and Huang [1980] 230). Moreover, since a woman in China is born to leave her natal lineage, this process is in some cases hastened, especially in families where economic factors are critical. The Chinese custom of daughter-in-law adoption exempliﬁes this process. A girl may become sim-pua or ‘little daughter in law’, with the intention that she should marry her foster brother or some male member of the lineage into which she has been adopted (Wolf and Huang [1980] 113–14). There is no sign in China that the impact of the agnatic nature of the society is to prevent the adoption of females. In contrast very little is heard of female adoptions at Rome. The practice of daughter-in-law adoption diminished the value placed on both natural daughters and adopted daughters. Daughters born into the family were devalued because girls ultimately became somebody else’s possession after the family of origin had borne the expense of rearing them. Thus girls commonly came to be removed for adoption even younger than males, and girls might thus be nursed by future mothers-in-law, who gave away their own daughters to make room for daughters-in-law. This did not, however, mean that an adopted daughter did better than a natural daughter – rather the reverse. They were not allowed to go to school for long, and were kept at home to do the housework. An apparent paradox was that despite the normality of mistreatment by their future mothers-in-law these adopted girls seem to have become deeply attached to their mothersin-law, and to have had poor relationships with their real mothers because\n\n20\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nthe natural mother had given them away. This tension probably goes a long way towards explaining the dynamics of the situation (Wolf and Huang [1980] 232–40). Two classes appear in household registers: sim-pua and iong-lu. The sim-pua form required that a family already have a son and declare their intent to marry him to their adopted daughter. Otherwise the girl had to be registered as iong-lu. This was regardless of whether or not the family hoped to marry her to a son if they produced one in time. In Hai-shan, with the exception of girls purchased as servant-slaves, all adopted daughters were called sim-pua (Wolf and Huang [1980] 114). Custom drew a distinction between u thau-tui and bou thau-tui, girls ‘with an opposite’ and girls ‘without an opposite’. This is only an indicator of the fact that they were or were not matched at the moment of adoption. In either case, circumstances could change (Wolf and Huang [1980] 115). Eﬀectively this institution was somewhat diﬀerent from adoption because these transactions were a ﬁrst step towards marriage and granted the girl status as a daughter-in-law. If candidates died before marriage, their tablets were installed on the altar as required for a daughter-in-law and not relegated to a back room, as was customary in the case of a daughter. Ca-bo-kan are the girls referred to as servant-slaves. Villagers would not usually purchase a girl to serve in their own home. They would rather adopt a sim-pua, on the grounds that a girl who could marry a son and bear children for the line was more use than one who was good for nothing but household chores. Ca-bo-kan was close to the mui tsai system in Hong Kong and Singapore. Although apparently a domestic servant with no wages and no personal freedom, the employer of a mui tsai regarded her as a family member and was obliged to provide her with board, lodging, clothing, medical attention, and, eventually when she reached marriageable age, she was to be married to a suitable husband. It has thus been seen as a form of female adoption (Wolf and Huang [1980] 117). There is, however, some question whether ca-bo-kan had an automatic right to marry – was this not rather seen as a generous concession on the part of the family which had purchased rights over the girl’s person? The Roman experience is quite diﬀerent from the sim-pua type of arrangement; women may be betrothed early but do not, at least in the high-status examples which are known to us, leave the natal home in advance of matrimony. Even then the development of marriage without manus shows that close links are retained with the family of origin. Marriage without manus is a late development, and motives for that development appear to relate to inheritance patterns. The retention of the female close to\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n21\n\nthe family at Rome is related to her capacity to take from her relatives, especially male relatives (Treggiari [1991a] 37–82; 379–83). In this comparison the sim-pua adoptee is drawn from a diﬀerent social milieu, the world of the marginal Chinese peasant. Nevertheless, the ﬁnancial considerations which keep a Roman girl who has been married without manus so closely linked to her natal family can be related to the fact that Romans males did not see their female relations as naturally extraneous, but rather as powerful adjuncts to political and social advancement. In contrast, the very rapid disposal of the female in China diminishes not just her cost but also the extent to which her natural origin is seen as signiﬁcant. Issues raised in a Chinese context by adoption Disputes in adoption cases centred on questions regarding ﬁlial piety to the natal father. In general, legally and ritually sanctioned adoptions of an heir were restricted to persons of the same kin group or same surname – others were legally prohibited – but adoption of persons of a diﬀerent surname seems to have been relatively common (sanctioned by custom). Adoption can be seen as mediating between the principle of heredity and the principle of merit. Waltner suggests that it is not surprising that this should take on importance when China was run by a civil service recruited through an examination system ([1990] 4). In nineteenth- and twentieth-century China adoption across surname lines was common; it seems that adoptive parents were not pressured to select a member of the surname group as heir, and it was thought that a child was more likely to opt out and return to the family of birth in the case of adoption of close relatives. It can be seen that these adoptions were centred on children rather than on the adults, as preferred in the Greek and Roman worlds. adoption – from rome to the modern situation in the western world Adoption in Rome took on special importance in relation to the perpetuation of the family sacra as well as providing an artiﬁcial continuity of line for purposes of inheritance of property. Concern for continuity of the sacra might have had links with a phase when ancestor worship was important at Rome, although this has been disputed. A Roman with no legitimate children would attempt to create an heir by other means, and might adopt a son still under paternal power (ﬁliusfamilias) from another family, or adrogate one who was legally independent (sui iuris). Whether religious\n\n22\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nor material considerations were originally behind Roman thinking cannot ﬁnally be settled, but it is clear that adoption was employed on a considerable scale, and the practice deserves careful investigation. In the late Republican and early Imperial examples where the evidence is fullest, the signs are that inheritance has become dominant, and this may also help to explain the growth of testamentary cases. In Classical times legitimation was virtually unknown. This is the process of acquiring patria potestas over natural children born outside marriage. These could not be adopted in the early Empire or before. A restricted exception allowed a man with no other children under his power to bring under his power by means of adrogatio one or more illegitimate children of free status – that is freeborn or freed. These might include children by a concubine (Gaius, Inst. 1.102; Dig. 1.7.15.2–3; Corbier [1991b] 64). The practice does not seem to have been widespread, and most leading citizens seem to have chosen to adopt from members of their own class. They still had to be Roman citizens at the time of adoption (Corbier [1999b] 1267). Concubinage and other features of Roman society in the late Republic and early Empire must have ensured that signiﬁcant numbers of potential heirs were prevented from ever legitimating their claim to membership of the father’s family. Certain groups in Roman society were prevented from contracting legitimate marriages. These included soldiers, who were prevented from marrying until the time of Septimius Severus (Campbell [1978] 153–66). In the Roman Empire Constantine introduced a form of legitimation per subsequens matrimonium. However, this was subject to certain restrictions. It applied only to existing cases of concubinage, and children would be legitimated and become citizens – if not already so – under the patria potestas of their father, when their father married his concubine. The woman had to be freeborn (ingenua), the man could not have an existing wife and legitimate children by her, and the oﬀspring in question had to assent to the process of legitimation. Hand in hand with this was an attempt to root out future instances of concubinage. A further measure under Anastasius shows that the measure was ineﬀective (J. A. C. Thomas [1976] 433–5). Under Justinian a more realistic version of the legislation was instituted. Even in cases where the father had existing legitimate children, marriage with a concubine would legitimate his oﬀspring provided that the woman was not a slave. She no longer had to be freeborn. Justinian also created or conﬁrmed another method of legitimation, per rescriptum principis (Just. Inst. 1.10.13). This was applicable to cases where the concubine was either\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n23\n\ndeceased or otherwise unﬁt to marry. Here the petition to the emperor might occur during the father’s lifetime or by petition in the father’s will. The third form of legitimation was per oblationem curiae. In the ﬁfth century it was validated under a constitution of Theodosius II and Valentinian III to help to ﬁnd candidates for the municipal oﬃce of decurio. A man with no legitimate issue could make his son by a concubine a decurio or marry his natural daughter to a decurio, and that child could then succeed to his estate on intestacy as though legitimate (J. A. C. Thomas [1976] 434). A child legitimated per oblationem curiae could only be legitimated if there had been no hindrance to marriage at the moment of conception. Children born of incest or adultery could not be legitimated in this way. In any case the resulting rights of the child were restricted to legitimation in the eyes of the family itself with no consequences for remoter relatives of the father. The Christian Church disapproved of attempts to move children between domestic groups through wet-nursing, fostering and adoption. The last of these was eﬀectively prevented for something like 1500 years. The other two continued unabated despite the Church’s condemnation of the practices (Corbier [1991a] 128). Adoption was essentially a legal act requiring formal enactment. Its dominant position in Roman law was soon to diminish in the postClassical period. The adoption of women (i.e. of those who were legally independent [sui iuris]) became possible, and after the time of Justinian it became possible for women to adopt, since adoptio no longer necessarily involved the creation of patria potestas. Nevertheless, the requirements of an age gap of eighteen years between adopter and adoptee, and a minimum age of sixty for the adopter, were retained (Goody [1983] 72). Goody notes the absence from Anglo-Saxon codes of anything resembling adoption, and it remained in abeyance in most Western nations until the latter part of the nineteenth century. In the United States it was introduced in Massachusetts in 1851 and later spread to other states (Goody [1983] 72–3). Goody argues that the Church of the Middle Ages would have opposed adoption since it has the eﬀect of creating ﬁctional heirs. In the event of a man’s dying without natural heirs, the Church would hope to be principal beneﬁciary. He draws the contrast with the Roman situation where Ulpian can say in about ad 200 ‘we are not permitted to appoint the gods as our heirs’ (Rules 32.6) (Goody [1983] 95–6). Goody also charts some important developments in the capacity of the Christian Church to become a beneﬁciary of private estates. Collegia had not been allowed to inherit unless especially privileged, and the\n\n24\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nChristian Church only began to receive special dispensation in the time of Constantine. The Edict of Milan (ad 313) formally recognised its power to own land, and in ad 321 that emperor enlarged the Church’s power to inherit. Within a short time restrictions began to be placed on the greed of the clergy, but it was no doubt this background which brought about the decline of adoption in the later Roman Empire (Goody [1983] 96). Goody accuses the Church of taking on a role comparable to that of those notorious inheritance sharks of the early Empire, the captatores; the classic example of a captator is Regulus, whose antics are detailed in a famous letter of the younger Pliny (Ep. 2.20). The Church itself was able to provide the continuities, which had previously been generated artiﬁcially through adoption. More recently Mireille Corbier has advised caution concerning the more extreme aspects of Goody’s argument about the inﬂuence of the Church and has modiﬁed details of interpretation (Corbier [1999a] 10–11). Adoption itself did not escape direct comment from Christian critics. The ﬁfth-century Christian writer Salvian, a priest of Marseilles, was a vocal critic of those who in a state of childlessness adopted children of others: In this way some very wretched and most unholy people, who are not bound by the bonds of children, nevertheless provide for themselves chains with which to bind the unfortunate necks of their own souls. When there is no crisis at all within the home, they summon one outside the home. Although the causes of danger are lacking, they rush headlong as if into voluntary death. (Cited by Goody [1983] 101)\n\nThe criticism is very clearly directed at the question of inheritance. Adoption was slow to recover from this lengthy period of neglect. When it did so, it was serving new social circumstances and was much more concerned with the interests of adoptees than the adopters. In England the common law recognised neither adoption nor legitimation until 1926. Informal adoption was in widespread use before that date. A person or married couple commonly put themselves into the role of parents to a child, but it was legally impossible for the natural parents to discharge their parental rights and liabilities through such a transfer. The need for the Adoption Act of 1926 had been generated as a result of the growth of adoption societies (such as the Waifs and Strays, later to become the Church of England Children’s Society). These had grown in size especially as a result of the circumstances of the 1914–18 war, and this led to political demands for the legal protection of children. In 1920 a committee was set\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n25\n\nup, chaired by Sir Alfred Hopkinson, and this in turn generated the Adoption of Children Act 1926 (Strachan [1992] 8–10). The Adoption Act of 1926 was experimental in scope and aimed to prevent the natural parents from subsequently reclaiming the child, and, further, to secure guardianship for the child within another family. As in the Roman situation, the approval of the state was required, and in both systems there was emphasis on preventing adoption in undesirable circumstances, allowing it only on the consent of the interested parties. Until 1958 the Act required a diﬀerence of age such that the adopter might have been the natural parent, another similarity to the Roman situation. Under the Act of 1926 a distinction was drawn between the natural and adopted child as far as rights over property and succession were concerned. Either parent can adopt, and either spouse can adopt separately. No married person and nobody over twenty-one can be adopted. This is an important distinction from the Roman situation in that it is essentially only the adoption of children. The bias in the Roman situation must have favoured the adoption of adults, since it was only through survival to adulthood that maintenance of the sacra could be assured. The rights transferred under the Act of 1926 were only those of future custody, maintenance and education. At the time of the Act the number of children available for adoption far exceeded the number wishing to adopt, but this trend has been reversed in more recent years. The Adoption of Children Act 1949 eﬀected important changes to the Act of 1926 and brought it much closer to the Roman practice. Until then an adopted child gained no right of succession in the new family on intestacy and retained rights within the old family. This is in direct opposition to the purpose of Roman adoption, which was directly related to questions of inheritance of rights and liabilities. Also no quasi-blood relationship was envisaged (again in contrast with the Roman situation), such as might prevent a marriage. This all changed in 1949. Adoption now brings the adopter and the adopted child for marriage purposes within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity, and moreover the prohibition survives any subsequent adoption of the adopted child by yet another person. Importantly the Act assimilated adopted children to natural children for the purposes of inheritance. Thus they now acquire rights of succession on intestacy and the term children in a will or any instrument inter vivos will be held to apply equally to adoptive and natural children. These modern developments have advanced adoption beyond the scope of the Act of 1926, at which time it was envisaged as little more than a special form of\n\n26\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nguardianship. It is now intended that the adoptive child should be assimilated to an actual child of the adopter. Legitimation in a modern context Legitimation was introduced into English law by the Legitimacy Act 1926, emended by the Legitimacy Act 1959. Unlike the Roman regulation, it does not extend to children of an adulterous union. Like the Roman rules of the period after Justinian, this act creates the same parental rights and duties as in the case of legitimate birth. Rights of succession in both directions are created, as are all rights accruing after the date of legitimation, with the exception of a dignity, title of honour, or any property going with it. A major diﬀerence from the Roman situation is that legitimation can only come about through the marriage of the parties. Marriage itself eﬀects the legitimation, and there is no question of consulting the interests of other parties such as children of an earlier marriage. a contemporary case Modern adoptions do not all conform to the general structure of English law as described, and variants are found in diﬀerent jurisdictions. Contemporary issues about property rights in same-sex relationships can be revealing. A case recently reported in the Sydney Morning Herald (20 March 2007, reported by Pam Belluck for the New York Times) uncovers some interesting features of adoption in the US state of Maine. It concerns descendants of the IBM founder Thomas Watson, in particular Olive Watson, ﬁfty-nine, granddaughter of the founder, and daughter of Thomas J. Watson Jnr, the company’s chief executive, and Patricia Ann Spado, now ﬁfty-nine, her former lesbian partner for fourteen years. A Maine law allows one adult to adopt another. In 1991 Olive Watson, then aged forty-three, adopted Spado, then forty-four, and thus marginally her senior. Spado in court documents claimed that this was done in order to allow her to qualify as an heir to Watson’s estate. Less than a year after the adoption the relationship broke up. In 2004 Olive Watson’s mother died leaving trusts to be divided amongst eighteen grandchildren. Spado put in a claim to a share as a nineteenth granddaughter. The Watson trust lawyers have been trying to annul the adoption on the grounds that the law was not intended for same-sex partners and that it was not applicable to the women who were only temporary residents in Maine. Spado’s lawyers have countered with the objection that the\n\nCross-cultural perspectives\n\n27\n\narrangement regarding the adoption is of long standing, was not fraudulent, and the basis of objection is ‘third-party aversions to personal lifestyles’. US experts say that adult adoption, which is allowed in many states, was intended to cover cases where a step-parent adopts a stepchild. This case highlights a feature of the times: in 1991 same-sex couples used adoption to secure the ﬁnancial position of partners in the absence of the possibility of same-sex marriage. After the couple separated Olive Watson paid Spado a $500,000 settlement, but its purpose is disputed and it is claimed by Spado to represent her interest in mutually owned property. Nevertheless there are complications for the Watson camp. Watson signed a letter conﬁrming ‘our agreement that I shall at no time initiate any action to revoke or annul my adoption of you’. Watson now lives in Miami with a new partner and two adopted boys, aged six and eight, included as heirs under the trust arrangements. A judge ruled against Spado in 2005, but matters are now under appeal. The case shows that where large estates are concerned, disputes over status are crucial to the outcome. Roman cases had some common ground, although an age diﬀerence replicating nature was expected between adopter and adoptee. conclusion In this review of the way in which adoption is used in diﬀerent timeframes and diﬀerent types of social organisation, the aim has been to look at the whole range of purposes for which strangers may be integrated into a family on what is intended to be a permanent basis. It is to be hoped that this review will help in not merely an understanding of the features which are present in Roman adoptions, but also a clearer appreciation of some of the possibilities which were deliberately excluded from its scope. Today the emphasis has swung away from the interests of couples who are trying to remedy family deﬁcits, and the main purpose of adoption is to secure the welfare of the child. Other recent developments show that modern adoptions are quite far removed from Roman ideals. While the idea of severing legal relations with biological parents is part of the Roman procedure, the severance of all other contact, which was the norm in modern cases of adoption until recently, seems unlikely to have been a normal consequence of Roman adoption. For some years now the right of the adoptee to information about identity has been acknowledged and this has gone far in lifting the veil of secrecy from adoption (Stonehouse [1992] 1–8). Some problems about the way adoptees are perceived are also\n\n28\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nbeginning to be confronted, and there is acknowledgement of the need for the biological connection with the birth mother which seems psychologically important to generational continuity (March [1995] 653–60). What cannot usually be encompassed in modern adoption is the adoption of older candidates. It is because nurture rather than inheritance is at the centre of most modern procedures that we cannot expect to understand Roman adoption simply by reviewing contemporary conditions.\n\nchapter 2\n\nKinship in Greece and Rome\n\nIn the nineteenth century, as the discipline of anthropology developed, kinship was seen as a key to understanding the working of social systems. Pioneers of that ﬁeld suggested that societies without highly evolved political and individual roles deﬁned their social relations with respect to kinship. Those involved were legally trained in the Classical tradition; they could see in Roman law attempts at deﬁning a wide range of familial relationships and obligations, and they saw Rome as an important evolutionary phase in a more sophisticated social setting, removed from the primitive. Even today kinship is seen as more important in simple societies, whereas complex societies have evolved away from it (Trautmann [1987] 180). The result has been that in modern studies of kinship there is still much recourse to terminology from Roman law, which had provided the seed bed for the analysis of family in terms of kin relationships. It also raises the question of whether kinship beyond the household did have a deep impact in the ancient world. Family relationships in both Greece and Rome have been subjected to considerable scrutiny over the past forty years; today after much detailed investigation of male and female power in both contexts it appears that the two cultures were less alike than was ﬁrst thought. Sarah Pomeroy, in her study of Families in Classical and Hellenistic Greece (1997), warns of the dangers of approaches which try to pin down a uniﬁed European identity and exaggerate similarities between communities which clearly developed separately and to some degree in isolation. Older approaches tried to force the evidence into a preconceived evolutionary mould. In the nineteenth century Greek society was ﬁtted into an evolutionary model in which its priority to Rome was assessed as implicated in its diﬀerent structure. Thus, according to Bachofen, Homeric society was seen as in transition towards a more evolved state (Patterson [1998] 11–12). In Homeric society there appeared to be a role for both patrilineal and matrilineal kin, while it was claimed that the evolution of the polis resulted in an exaggerated patriarchal society, where patriarchy not only enhanced 29\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\n30\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nmale participation in the public sphere but seriously damaged the role of women in the private sphere. Why evolution took that particular direction was seen as self evident and was never truly tested, a view which it has taken a long time to modify. The mechanics of the evolution into the world of Rome were also glazed over. Modern studies of the social system in the Greek world were initially extremely Athenocentric, as exempliﬁed by Lacey (1968), but some balance has been attempted by more recent work on Sparta, as well as in the overview by Pomeroy (1997) and a study of Greek households by Cox (1998). Parkin has emphasised that Lacey, rather than discussing theory, preferred to give a broad chronological survey of the Greek family based on literary texts (Parkin [1999]). As Saller points out in an important work, the study of Roman kinship is complicated by the central role it had in the development of the discipline of anthropology and the formulation of social theory (Saller [1997] 7). He follows the approach taken by Robin Fox (1967). Anthropology had its beginnings with lawyers who were trained in and highly inﬂuenced by Roman law, and they used that framework to generate much of their classiﬁcatory vocabulary. Saller believes that this legal slant has in fact been a major hindrance in comprehending the actual working of Roman kinship. A lot of interest has been generated in the world-view of the 1860s as manifested in the work of Lewis Morgan, Fustel de Coulanges and Henry Maine. Maine thought that kinship was deﬁned culturally through the law rather than biologically, and his approach involves the most extreme adherence to legal texts in his analysis of the nature of Roman kinship (Maine [1861] 93–141; 219–22; Shils [1991] 143–78). Consequently, to give an example, he saw the gens as a ﬁctitious creation and conﬁned to patricians (Smith [2006] 106). Fustel de Coulanges saw the ancient family as a religious rather than a natural association controlled by laws and a legal framework generated by the family before the growth in the power of the state ([1980] 104): What we have seen of the family – its domestic religion, the gods which it had created for itself, the laws that it had established, the right of primogeniture on which it had been founded, its unity, its development from age to age until the formation of the gens, its justice, its priesthood, its internal government – carries us forcibly in thought, towards a primitive epoch, when the family was independent of all superior power, and when the city did not yet exist.\n\nAs Smith has recently emphasised there are signs in Fustel de Coulanges of an evolutionary view of the world, and a very bleak view of decline at that (Smith [2006] 104).\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nKinship in Greece and Rome\n\n31\n\nLewis Morgan, an American lawyer with extensive knowledge of and acquaintance with the realities of Iroquois society, was still working with a Classical paradigm, although he set human development against a very long time line as a result of growth in geological knowledge – but still highly dependent on the evolutionary model (as emphasised by Trautmann [1987]). Stages in his scheme were savagery, barbarism and civilisation, while Greece and Rome were located as evolved barbarism, about to transmogrify into civilisation. Naturally this revisionism of Maine and Fustel de Coulanges, since it required moving the evolutionary categories (hitherto Greece and Rome had been seen as their starting point), should have been a warning about the inadequacy of the model. Morgan also had ideas about the nature of evolution of social organisation; these too were employing the world of Greece and Rome as a yardstick. A brief quotation is suﬃcient to illustrate: Commencing then, with the Australians and Polynesians, following with the American Indian tribes, and concluding with the Roman and Grecian, who aﬀord the highest exempliﬁcations respectively of the six great stages of human progress, the sum of their united experiences may be supposed fairly to represent that of the human family from the Middle Status of savagery to the end of ancient civilisation. Consequently, the Aryan nations will ﬁnd the type of the condition of their remote ancestors, when in savagery, in that of the Australians and Polynesians; when in the Lower Status of barbarism in that of the partially Village Indians of America; and when in the Middle Status in that of the Village Indians, with which their own experience in the Upper Status directly connects. So essentially identical are the arts, institutions and mode of life in the same status upon all the continents, that the archaic form of the principal institutions of the Greeks and Romans must even now be sought in the corresponding institutions of the American aborigines … (Morgan [1877] 17)\n\nIt can be seen that the nineteenth-century views were inﬂuenced by the belief that certain types of result could be obtained by comparing diﬀerent cultures. The belief in a universal paradigm that would emerge if certain cultural buttons were pushed is probably the most damaging and unhelpful part of this. It is not merely the idea that social institutions are subject to evolution, which is problematic, but also the inﬂexible search for deviation from certain norms, and the attempt to force them back into the evolutionary scheme. Although the Classical world was not always seen as the highest good – witness Morgan – the structure of politics and families in Greece and Rome provided a classiﬁcatory scheme of great importance, a framework drilled into educated contemporaries as a result of the Classical education. Morgan can be considered typical:\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\n32\n\nAdoption in the Roman World\n\nIt may be here premised that all forms of government are reducible to two general plans, using the word plan in its scientiﬁc sense. The ﬁrst, in order of time, is founded upon persons, and upon relations purely personal, and may be distinguished as a society (societas). The gens is the unit of organisation; giving as the successive stages of integration, in the archaic period, the gens, the phratry, the tribe, and the confederacy of tribe, which constituted a people or nation (populus). At a later period a coalescence of tribes in the same area into a nation took the place of a confederacy of tribes occupying independent areas. Such, through prolonged ages, after the gens appeared, was the substantially universal organisation of ancient society; and it remained among the Greeks and Romans after civilisation supervened. The second is founded upon territory and upon property, and may be distinguished as a state (civitas). The township or ward, circumscribed by metes and bounds, with the property it contains, is the basis or unit of the latter, and political society is the result. Political society is organised upon territorial areas, and deals with property as well as with persons through territorial relations. The successive stages of integration are the township or ward, which is the unit of organisation; the country or province, which is the aggregation of townships or wards; and the national domain or territory, which is an aggregation of counties or provinces; the people of each of which are organised into a body politic. It taxed the Greeks and Romans to the extent of their capacities, after they had gained civilisation, to invent the deme or township and the city ward; and thus inaugurate the second great plan of government, which remains among civilised nations to the present hour. In ancient society this territorial plan was unknown. When it came in it ﬁxed the boundary line between ancient and modern society … (Morgan [1877] 6–7)\n\nThis makes it very clear that Morgan framed his discussion of all other societies against the Classical world. Bettini sees, in the highly diﬀerentiated kinship terms known in Latin, evidence that the Romans had a highly diﬀerentiated series of roles for this battery of kin [(1991) 1]. Some confusion has crept into his discussion of Roman kinship as a result of the inclusion of kin to the sixth degree, some 448 types of kin, by the third-century ad jurist Paul (Dig. 38.10.10–18). He believed this speciﬁcity to show Roman concern with remote kin, but it appears only to be relevant to detailed legal analyses, in cases of inheritance and guardianship. Apart from the inadequacy of the evidence to prove his theory, Saller has pointed out that Bettini still employs the evolutionary model: Bettini invokes anthropology dependent on the nineteenth-century tradition to validate his argument whereas Saller underlines the scarcity of evidence to support the idea of a wide range of kin obligations (Saller [1997] 9–10). Patterson also underlines the pervasive inﬂuence of the nineteenthcentury; she treats Engels and notes the employment of the evolutionary paradigm in both Grote and Mahaﬀy, popular late nineteenth-century accounts of the Greek world (Patterson [1998] 23–4).\n\nCambridge Books Online © Cambridge University Press, 2010\n\nKinship in Greece and Rome\n\n33\n\nSaller, who demonstrates the culture-bound nature of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century approaches to Roman kinship, divides the problem of the relevance of kinship to an understanding of Roman society into three parts ([1997] 18). The ﬁrst problem was to establish the cultural paradigm for kinship inherent in Roman society – allowing of course for individual divergence from the norm. The second issue was one of social identity, or how the Romans construed their own place in the social hierarchy in relationship to kinship. And ﬁnally there was the behavioural question: did certain kinship roles prompt certain social responses? Corbier points out that the range of prohibitions connected with kinship in Rome was extremely limited, and access to marriage was not reserved to a limited number of siblings as in the later European family (Corbier [1991a] 128–42). Most Romans had a simple conception of family, friends and their place in their day-to-day lives. The correspondence of Cicero is quite revealing"
