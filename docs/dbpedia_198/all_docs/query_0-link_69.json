Printing and binding: CPI books GmbH, Leck www.degruyter.com\n\nPreface The present volume is a collection of 19 papers from prominent scholars around the world, invited by the editors to honour Vasileios Petrakos’ many and significant accomplishments regarding the study of the material world of ancient Greek culture, collectively termed “Greek antiquity”. The occasion was the celebration of the 60th anniversary since the honoree’s first visit to Rhamnous (north-east Attica) on the 10 December 1959, a visit which led to the initiation of Petrakos’ major field project, one that has transformed our picture of Attic demes and greatly increased our understanding of Attica, especially during the Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods. The papers are organised thematically, by the types of major scientific contributions Petrakos has made to the study of Greek antiquities: these are of three kinds. First, he revealed, published and interpreted hundreds of new inscriptions, especially from border sites on both sides of the south Euboean Gulf, such as Eretria, Oropos and Rhamnous. Second, he conducted fundamental archaeological field work on several regions of the Greek Mainland (Attica, Euboea and Phocis) and the Aegean islands (Lesbos), where he brought to light, published and discussed a huge number of non-inscribed monuments and objects. Third, and in addition to his fundamental epigraphical and non-epigraphical archaeological work, Petrakos also made important contributions to the historiography of Greek archaeology, where he established a new framework for the systematic study of the history of Greek archaeology. The book is, thus, structured in three parts: Epigraphy and Ancient History (part 1), Archaeology (part 2) and History of Greek Archaeology (part 3). Within each part the papers are arranged in chronological order. The contributions cover the honoree’s favoured topics and periods, both reflecting the breadth of Petrakos’ interests as well as his holistic methodological approach (a significant combination of text-oriented classical skills with the competencies of a field archaeologist, aimed at reconstructing ancient life in all its manifestations), and demonstrating the great influence he wielded in Greek Epigraphy, Ancient History, and Archaeology as well as in the Historiography of Greek Archaeology. First, though, Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos reflects on Petrakos’s career and provides a resume of the honoree’s significant contributions to Greek Archaeology. The nine “Epigraphy and Ancient History” papers (part 1) cover a wide range of issues and geographical areas, extending chronologically from 5th century BC to the Roman period and geographically from ancient Macedonia in the north to Argos to the south and from Molykreion in the west to Aphrodisias to the east. The article of Miltiades B. Hatzopoulos emphasizes the value of Historical Geography and Epigraphy in reconstructing the military events taking place in ancient Macedonia shortly before the beginning of the Peloponnesian war. Contrary to those focused exclusively https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110699326-202\n\nVI  Preface on texts (here the famous passage 1.57.3–1.63. from the first book of Thucydides), Hatzopoulos’ analysis introduces certain additions and revisions of the until-now proposed set of events related to the revolt of Poteidaia and to the first years of the reign of Perdikas II. Next, based on an analysis of ancient sources of the Classical period, on what is known about the structure of the Eleusinian ritual and on the results of the American excavations in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace, Kevin Clinton suggests that the Korybantic ritual might have played an important role in Samothrace’s mystery cult, most probably as a preliminary initiation of a purificatory character. In the third contribution Charalampos B. Kritzas, taking as a starting point the fact that the place name “Rhamnous”, to which the honoree dedicated a great part of his life, was named after the plant “rhamnos”, offers a dataset of twelve phytonymic place names from the territory of Argos dated to the 4th century BC, based on evidence from the ancient literature and on important new information revealed through the inscribed bronze tablets of the recently found early 4th century BC archive of the Sanctuary of Pallas Athena in the city of Argos. He discusses specific plant species common through the territory and on the possible location of these place names within the territory of Argos. Denis Knoepfler and Dominique Mulliez deal with epigraphical material from Eretria and Delphi respectively, both sites where Petrakos spent several years conducting research. Knoepfler emphasizes the historical aspect of a fascinating corpus of epitaphs for foreigners from the maritime city of Eretria (non-Eretrians), which first became known in 1968 and 1974 in two publications of the honoree. Among them are epitaphs preserving the names of cities now completely lost, such as Eudaristos in Paeonia. Mulliez draws our attention to the phenomenon of private arbitration as it is seen through the study of the Delphi inscriptions, including a corpus on private arbitration in ten Delphic manumissions to show that such occurred only within the framework of a paramone clause. Nikolaos Kaltsas reports on a new proxeny decree discovered in 2007 at the sanctuary at Elliniko near Velvina (Molykreion), dating possibly to the end of the 3rd century BC. This should be understood as a public expression of the political and diplomatic culture of the Aetolian League. Robert Parker and Michael J. Osborne return us to one of Petrakos’ main areas of research: the study of the institutions of the Athenian city state during the Hellenistic period. According to Parker the choice of the gender of a priest/priestess is not due to reasons of any political nature but depends on the character of the relevant religious site and should be rather traced far back in time, maybe even to the Mycenaean period. He distinguishes, therefore, between a “patriarchal worship”, in which the male head of the community performs rites to propitiate a god, like Nestor to Athena in the Odyssey (one could even ponder here about the rites conducted by the wanax within the Mycenaean throne room with the central hearth), and a “temple worship”, where an individual would have conducted religious rites. In this case a priestess would have been appropriate for performing rites involving women or a goddess. Michael J. Osborne focuses on the phenomenon of granting Athenian citizenship to a foreigner during the Late Hellenistic period, the time when Athens\n\nPreface  VII\n\nbecame more open in its attitude to foreign residents. He argues that a significant benefaction was no longer necessary for these new citizens, as in earlier times. For the sons of wealthy and cultured foreigners service on the ephebate may well have become an indirect pathway to citizenship. Finally, Angelos Chaniotis explores an honorific formula specific to the Roman elite of Aphrodisias, referring to their descent as “synktisantes” or “synektikotes” (those who jointly built the city). Combining the evidence of epigraphy and field archaeology, Chaniotis is able to show that the formula possibly refers to an epidosis, a promise by their families to contribute financially to the building projects of the city in the future. Part 2 (“Archaeology”) presents six papers, five of which refer to Petrakos’ principal region of archaeological investigation: Attica. The contributions range chronologically from the Chalcolithic to the Roman period. Prehistoric Attica is represented by Joseph Maran and Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos. Joseph Maran provides an impressive overview of the earliest appearance of silver objects in many regions, covering the whole geographical area between the Carpathian basin and the Balkans in the north-west and the Iranian highlands in the south-east. Hereby he succeeds in showing that the repeated claim by several scholars that silver was not produced and used in the Aegean before the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC is incorrect. As far as Attica is concerned the exploitation of the lead/silver ore deposits that dominated silver production in classical Greece seem to have played a special role already during the Chalcolithic period. Kalogeropoulos explores cultural variation and regional diversity in the archaeological record of Mycenaean Attica. In contrast to previous studies, the review of internal cultural expression (e.g. funerary and domestic architecture, settlement geography, pottery production etc.) and interrelationships within this region is here presented within a framework of controlled comparison. Twenty rational and practical geographical units are defined for this reason, termed ‘mesoregions’. This method allows him to offer a more accurate diachronic cultural development of Mycenaean Attica. The main aim of Emanuele Greco’s contribution, which comes next, is to ask whether the archaeological material of funerary character of the Archaic period found in the agoras of the Greek colonies justifies the modern perception, based largely on (later) literary sources, of being, as with Athens, places where the founder of each of these apoikiai received heroic honours. The article contains six representative case studies from Sicily (Gela, Megara Hyblaea, Selinunte), Magna Graecia (Poseidonia), Libya (Cyrene) and Caria (Iasos) which illustrate well the complex picture of the archaeological data, as well as the hypothetical character of such assumptions. The use of mythological material from literary sources for the identification of hero cults is at present possible only in two cases, namely in the worship of Theseus in Athens and also in the case of the grave of Battus I in Cyrene. Greco’s careful study demonstrates the need for a more rigorous methodological research. Manolis Korres presents an exhaustive analysis of a large-scale Ionic capital of Cycladic character with ascending\n\nVIII  Preface Aeolic volutes (Athens NM 4797) found 60 years ago by the honoree at Sykaminos (Oropos). His analysis helps in appreciating the type and design of this early capital (dated about 550–540 BC) which is generally considered as important for the understanding of the development of the Ionic order. Korres compares it with the Parian capital of the Museum of Paros (Paros Museum 775) and suggests that the capital had initially an ornamental function supporting a sphinx with her head turning to the capital’s front. Michalis Tiverios investigates the performance of Dionysiac cult in Rhamnous, Petrakos’ main research site, during the late Archaic and Classical period. Combining archaeological evidence brought to light by the honoree (e.g. evidence for theatrical performances, choregic dedications, the presence of an early classical clay mask and a stamnos), contemporary iconographical evidence (Lenaian vase-paintings), ancient sources and epigraphical finds, Tiverios argues for the existence of a specific religious ritual practice in Rhamnous, performed exclusively by female ritual participants for Dionysos Lenaios and makes the interesting point that this ritual could have involved the rite of the purification of must. Finally, Theodosia Stefanidou-Tiveriou’s article deals with a most interesting marble relief found relatively recently within a fountain in Merenta (ancient deme of Myrrhinous) near a sanctuary: it depicts the myth of Philoctetes together with Odysseus and Diomedes and dates to 140–160 AD. Her analysis shows that the theme of the relief follows a classicizing version of an older composition, while its water symbolism seems to have been deliberately chosen to suit the decoration of a semi-underground fountain in this deme. Part 3 (“The History of Greek Archaeology”) presents four papers related not only to different regions and periods but also to different legal, political, and ethical frameworks in which the protection, uncovering and publication of Greek Antiquities has taken place. The first two articles concern the early efforts of two European scholars of the first half of the 19th century to document Attic antiquities, while the other two highlight the significance of the collaboration between Greek and foreign archaeologists during the 1950s and 1960s for the benefit of Greek Archaeology in the specific cases of Pylos and Eretria. John McK. Camp II publishes and discusses seven drawings executed by the British scholar Edward Dodwell and the Italian artist Simone Pomardi, depicting monuments and their surrounding landscape in the Athenian port of Piraeus (Petrakos’ birthplace) when staying there in May 1805. Hereby, Camp demonstrates the importance of these drawings not only as a means of documenting and identifying well-known monuments such as the tomb of Themistocles and the Cononian fortification wall or the surprising desolation of Piraeus in 1805, but also as containing evidence for ancient remains no longer surviving, such as the ancient monuments near the harbour of Zea depicted in two of Pomardi’s illustrations or for the conducting of an, otherwise unknown, excavation of a cemetery of the classical period near the port of Zea. Klaus Fittschen as well presents hitherto unknown notes:\n\nPreface  IX\n\nin his case those of Karl Otfried Müller of Göttingen, one of the most important scholars of ancient Greece of his generation, compiled during Müller´s four day-stay in the area of Marathon, Rhamnous and Oropos (the main research area of Petrakos) in July 1840 on his way to Delphi. In this article, Fittschen includes also eleven drawings of ancient monuments and landscapes related to these three sites by Friedrich Neise, a young draughtsman, who accompanied Müller on his travels. Of particular interest for Fittschen is Müller’s observation of vehicle ruts between the castle of Rhamnous and the Nemesis sanctuary, where Petrakos has, interestingly, identified a 6 m-wide ancient road. Jack L. Davis uses unpublished archive material to explore the relationship between two important Aegean prehistorians, a Greek and an American, who influenced greatly Greek Archaeology for more than five decades: Spyridon Marinatos and Carl W. Blegen. Hereby he highlights the significance of a noble and harmonious collaboration between the two, especially during the 1950s and 1960s, the period when both cooperated in Messenia for the benefit of Messenian antiquities (e.g. for the protection of the Palace of Nestor). The final paper is by Pierre Ducrey and constitutes a fitting end to a Festschrift for Vasileios Petrakos. According to Ducrey the use of Petrakos’ archaeological paradigm of the early 1960s in Eretria proved to be very beneficial for the Greco-Swiss excavations at this coastal Euboean site, while his fundamental ideas on archaeological legislation, protection, restoration and publication of Greek antiquities played an important role in the development of the later scientific work of the Swiss Archaeological School in Athens. The editors extend their sincere thanks to all authors who have submitted their papers, without which of course the Festschrift could not have been compiled at all. The editors invited those international contributors who have either collaborated with the honoree in the past or whose work has had an impact in one of the three areas in which the honoree has focused his own research interests. Many thanks also go to all involved for their good work and exceptional patience in helping us with the proofreading of the English, German and French texts (Doniert Evely, Ulrike Schulz and Marina Toulgaridou respectively), with the House Style work (Annika Busching) and with the Indexes (Orestis Goulakos). Denis Knoepfler generously supported the publication financially. Our special thanks go to him. The editors are also grateful to Antonios Rengakos for having actively supported the idea of publishing the Festschrift in the Editing House of De Gruyter. But above all many thanks to Vasileios Petrakos for being for so many years such a constant support and inspiring mentor, friend and colleague.

What begun officially in that summer – in fact actually three years earlier in summer 1956 – now spans 64 years and one spectacular career. This brief essay cannot, of course, address all of Petrakos’ contributions to the field of Greek archaeology, but it tries to highlight some of his innumberable interests and talents, to put his work in the proper perspective.\n\nChildhood (1932–1950) Vasileios Petrakos was born on 7 October 1932 in the harbor town of Peiraieus as the third child in a family of four children (one older brother, one older sister, one younger sister). Both of his parents came to Peiraieus from different parts of Greece. His father, a tailor, who from 1912 to 1922 participated in three consecutive wars (Balkan Wars, World War I and Greco-Turkish War), moved there from Gytheion (Laconia), his mother came from Aidepsos (Euboea). Petrakos’ later childhood, that time which constructs someone’s individuality, coincided with the Nazi occupation of the Greek mainland (1941–1944). During this period Peiraieus, the town where he was born and grown up, was twice devastated by aerial bombing (1941 by the Germans and 1944 by the Allies). This was a time of fear, terror and confusion characterized by the destruction of homes, loss of beloved persons and separation of families. Petrakos himself was sent with the other children of his family from Peiraieus for safety to Aidepsos. His adolescence corresponded with the Greek Civil War (1946–1949). All these traumatic experiences generated life-long effects on him, as it is evidenced by personal statements, especially in his later work.1  Information cited in this article derives either from the honoree’s own published work or from personal conversations I had with him. I am grateful to co-editor Mrs. Dora Vassilikou for providing me with the photographs 1–3. Bold numbers in the footnotes refer to the publications of the honoree at the end of the article. Many thanks are also due to Don Evely for polishing my English.  1 Two examples concerning his visual memories from the Nazi occupation, one made in 2013 and one in 2017 may clarify this: “Ἔζησα τὴ Γερμανικὴ (κατοχὴ) καὶ ἔχω ζωηρὴ τὴν εἰκόνα της” (493, 724); “Ἔβλεπα τὰ πρωινὰ τοῦ ᾽44 τὰ βαμμένα μαῦρα φορτηγὰ τῶν σκουπιδιῶν μὲ τὴ σαμαρωτὴ στέγη ν᾽ ἀνηφορίζουν ἀγκομαχώντας τὴν ὁδὸ ’Ακαδημίας. Κανεὶς δὲν μιλοῦσε γιὰ τὸ τί ἔκρυβαν μέσα τους. Ὁ τρόμος σ᾽ ἔσφιγγε στὴν ὄψη τους καὶ μόνο.” (560, 225). https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110699326-206\n\nXXIV  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos\n\nUniversity (1951–1956) From 1951 to 1956, i.e. during the Post Civilian War / Early Cold War Era of Greece, Petrakos studied History and Archaeology at the University of Athens. He was educated in classical, prehistoric and byzantine Archaeology by significant scholars such as Anastasios Orlandos, Spyridon Marinatos, and Georgios Mylonas and in byzantine, post-byzantine History, and the History of modern Greece by leading Greek scholars such as Dionysios Zakythinos and Nikolaos Vlachos. After an intermezzo in 1955, when he did his military service in Kalamata, he received his diploma in early 1957.\n\nEarly Career (1956–1963) Petrakos’ introduction to the archaeological fieldwork of Attica came in the summer of 1956 when he joined the Agia Triada excavations in Peiraieus directed by Ioannis Papadimitriou,2 at that time Director of Antiquities of Attica. Papadimitriou, who would become an important mentor for Petrakos, was since at least 1951 internationally famous (primarily through his discovery of Grave Circle B in Mycenae), but in the period of Petrakos involvement in Attica (1956) he was at the beginning of administering his great project for the excavation of the Artemis sanctuary in Brauron (1955– 1963). During the subsequent period 1958–1963, in his leading position as Director of Antiquities and Restoration (1958–1963) Papadimitriou played a central role in the reorganization of the administration of the Greek Archaeological Service.3 From the beginning of 1957, Petrakos accompanied Papadimitriou every Saturday on his trips while getting acquainted with the problems of Attic topography. Between 1957 and 1959, Papadimitriou sent him to conduct works in the Amphiareion of Oropos on the occasion of the construction of an archaeological museum within the sanctuary.4 During these works Petrakos found in Skala Oropou, near the sea, pottery fragments of the Middle Helladic and the Early Mycenaean period, that offered for the first time archaeologically documented evidence for the existence of this formative period in the border area between Attica and Boeotia.5 Papadimitriou also assigned Petrakos with the task of preparing a catalogue of the inscriptions from Oropos stored in the Amphiareion, a work which he did in 1957 and which then formed the foundation for his PhD thesis completed eight years later in Lyon.6\n\n 2 193, 67. 3 233, 163. 4 76, 148. 5 34, 97. 6 Compare nos 9 and 252.\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XXV\n\nIn December 1957, Petrakos, together with Olga Alexandri, cleaned out and produced for the first time a drawing of the temple of Artemis Tauropolos in Loutsa (Halai Araphenides), which had been identified by Nikolaos Kyparissis in the 1920s and was re-discovered by Papadimitriou in 1956.7 In the next year (1958) Petrakos was employed by the Archaelogical Society at Athens together with Leandros Vranousis and Menelaos Tourtoglou to classify the archival material of the Society, a work completed under the supervision of Manousos Manousakas, a historian of medieval and early modern Greece. During this period, he read anything and everything related to the documentary holdings of the Archaeological Society’s Archive.8 This laid the foundations of much of his later research in the history of Greek Archaeology. The beginning of 1959 was for Petrakos an examination period, since he prepared himself for the employment exams for the ’Αρχαιολογικὴ Ὑπηρεσία (Greek Archaeological Service). In June 1959, he entered the Archaeological Service after passing the exams that had taken place in March 1959,9 for the first time since 1933.10 Five candidates were successful, which, in comparison to modern standards, is a very low number: Petrakos himself, Olga Alexandri, Manto Oikonomidou, Katerina Rhomiopoulou and Maria Karamanoli-Siganidou.11 Petrakos’ first task as an Epimeletes (Curator) was to organize in summer 1959 the Museum in Delphi. He continued in the autumn of the same year with similar duties in the museum of Sparta under the directorship of the then Ephor of Laconia, Chrysanthos Christou. In December 1959, he returned to Attica, where he begun his work in the ancient deme of Rhamnous. It was the 10th of December of 1959, when he visited the site for the first time as a young Epimeletes: that day proved to be a turning point not only in his life but also in the history of Greek archaeology. It was then that he began recording scattered and undocumented findings of previous archaeological investigations in the sanctuary of Nemesis under the supervision of Ioannis Kontis, by that time Ephoros of Antiquities in Attica,12 with the assistance of the sculptor Stelios Triantis. Retrospectively, the project “Rhamnous”, which started some 60 years ago and ended this year (2020) with his monumental multi-volumed final publication entitled “Ὁ δῆμος τοῦ Ραμνοῦντος”,13 can be considered to have contributed more to the understanding of an ancient deme’s life in Attica than any other undertaking in the 20th  7 255, 32f.; Papadimitriou 1957, 46 fig. 2.

His work fundamentally altered our picture of Attic demes and immeasurably increased our historical understanding, especially of Classical, Hellenistic and Roman Attica. Already in 1960, while clearing away the 1890–1892 debris of Valerios Stais’ excavations piled west and east of the Nemesis sanctuary, Petrakos was able to identify important, until then unnoticed, fragmented material such as column drums of the great temple, new relief fragments of the classical marble basis of the cult statue of Nemesis, as well as an important inscription connecting events of the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC), assigning them to specific buildings in Rhamnous.14 Until today (2020) and with the exception of a twelve-year period where he operated outside Attica (1963–1974), Petrakos devoted himself to the mission of exploring, preserving and publishing the monuments of Rhamnous and despite (or perhaps because of) his innumerous other interests and major publications related to many different aspects and topics of ancient Greek society, it is fair to say that he succeeded admirably. The years after 1960 saw the rapid growth in the standards of living and of building activities in Greece and especially in Attica and in the islands of the Saronic Gulf, which as a consequence has been threatening to destroy huge amounts of material, documents of prehistoric and ancient Greek culture. Petrakos’ salvage work in these areas during the period 1960–1963 was crucial. His rescue excavations recovered, documented and definitely protected large numbers of ancient monuments, that would otherwise have been lost due to building activities. Representative cases include the recovery of a portion of the Mycenaean chamber tomb cemetery at the hill of Kamini, which otherwise would have been destroyed by the extension of the SW suburb of Athens Varkiza,15 or the discovery in Kephissia of marble busts and body fragments belonging to Herodes Atticus and his pupils Polydeukion and Memnon,16 at a place where the Villa of Herodes must have been sited.17 Directly related to the scientific documentation and protection of the ancient monuments, but also to his (and later so characteristic of him) holistic approach to archaeology is the way he conducted restoration work during this period both in theory and in practice. Two cases may serve to exemplify this. First, there is his decision to write in November 1960 an architectural critique on the “barbaric” methods used by the architects of the Direction of Anastelosis (E. Stikas) to restore the Aphaia temple on Aegina, using extensively new materials. According to Petrakos the restoration “killed” the monument and it was certainly in contrast with what he has learned from Kontis about anastelosis-principles appropriate for temples.18 Although in his main point of criticism he\n\n 14 1, 37f. 15 1, 40; on this Mycenaean cemetery, see Polychronakou-Sgouritsa 1988. 16 3, 30; 52, fig. 131 (Herodes Atticus), 132 (Polydeukion). 17 52, 148. 18 233, 152–154 n. 218; 158f.\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XXVII\n\nwas certainly right, the fact that Petrakos was not an architect, i.e. not a “expert” in matters of anastelosis, in combination with the fact that in that period (November 1960) he was still very young, led to the result that his report failed to stimulate a scientific debate about the role of aesthetic matters in anastelosis. The second case was the difficult but scientifically successful stone by stone dismantling, transferring and re-erecting of one of the largest late classical funerary enclosures (periboloi) in Attica, that of Elliniko, near the Saronic Gulf, which would otherwise have been destroyed by the construction of the Runway of the Athens Airport (East).19 Petrakos’ third archaeological point of focus in the period 1960–1963 was Eretria. While commissioned with the task to organize the exhibition of the new Eretria museum (constructed in 1959), he was able between 1961 and 1963 not only to clear the visible ancient structures of the site but also to reveal important new monuments such as the tholos,20 fragments from the pediment of the archaic temple of Apollon Daphnephoros,21 and an Ionic capital of votive character,22 and also to identify others (e.g. the Thesmophorion),23 as well as to publish for the first time useful architectural plans, among them an up-to-date topographical outline of the walled town.24 Furthermore, in the gully to the west of the site, i.e. in the area of the archaeological museum, he discovered in 1963 a great number of funerary inscriptions, which he published in two sets,25 testifying to the presence of a cemetery at this area. In addition to his fundamental field research, which had a strong impact in the subsequent fieldwork conducted in Eretria the last 55 years by the Swiss School of Archaeology,26 Petrakos published in this period some of his first epigraphical studies. The first piece was an inscribed base found in Eretria in December 1961. It concerns a dedicatory inscription on an honorary statue made by sculptor Teisikrates in the first half of the 3rd century BC for one Aeschylus Antandrides from Eretria, Hieromnemon in Delphi, known from other inscriptions and the literary tradition.27 The second one was an inscription on a square base which commemorates the erection of a Herm by a group of people named ’Αειναῦται, apparently an Eretrian association of sailors, which were chronologically related to a board of three magistrates.28\n\n 19 3, 30–35. 20 4, 148–151 fig. 6–7. 21 4, 144f. 22 6, 127 fig. 7. 23 4, 145 fig. 2. 24 4, 153. 25 In 1968 (18), and in 1974 (34).

Holding a scholarship of the French Government, he studied there Greek Epigraphy with Jean Pouilloux, Georges Roux and Henri Metzger in Lyon and with Louis Robert in Paris (Collège de France).29 Based on these seminars and lessons and on the catalogue of inscriptions he had compiled in 1957 in the Amphiareion, he wrote in the first months of 1965 his doctoral dissertation with the title Les inscriptions d’Oropos under the supervision of Jean Pouilloux in Lyon (Institut d’épigraphie Grecque - Institut Fernand Courby).30 Petrakos’ dissertation contained partly the corpus of the inscription of Oropos but was partly also historical since it dealt with the history, the geography, the institutions and the prosopography of Oropos.31\n\nThe Years as the Head of the Ephorates at Mytilini (Lesbos), Delphi and Patras (1965–1974) Returning from France back to Greece, he was appointed by Kontis as the head of the Ephorate of Antiquities of the Aegean Islands, succeeding in this position Serapheim Charitonides. Based in Mytilene on Lesbos, he was responsible for the islands Lesbos, Chios and Lemnos. During his stay there (summer 1965 until spring 1969) he was very active not only in digging sites in advance of development and in restoring, conserving and protecting important monuments, but also in publishing his earlier and current archaeological research. The most important rescue and restorational work was done on Mytilene itself. First, he excavated the vaulted vomitoria and restored the famous Roman theatre of Mytilene. He offered the first accurate plan of the stage building and the orchestra of a monument, which according to Plutarch was to become the archetype of all Roman theatres, and provided drawings of the inscriptions and detailed descriptions of the older findings of Dimitrios Evangelides.32 Second, he conducted systematic restoration and conservation work in the Castle of Mytilene, which had been systematically looted during the crisis years of 1912 and 1922.33 Furthermore, he provided new and – in comparison with those of Robert Koldeway and W.R. Paton – more accurate draw-\n\n 29 233, 150. 30 9; 252, 13. 31 10, 45 n. 1. 32 14, 22, 24. 33 14, 460 pl. 337 γ; 38.\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XXIX\n\nings and plans of the main castle, the Middle, South and North Gates, the Great Enclosure, as well as plans and sections of the Gunpowder Magazine.34 Third, he recovered a large building with a high-quality mosaic floor, enclosing representations of winged Erotes, fauna and human portraits.35 The floor had been found in 1967 in the excavations during demolition of the old hospital in front of the church of Agios Therapon. In the modern deposits of this site he has also found a Roman inscription honouring Marcus Pompeius Theophanes described as εἰρονόμας.36 Finally, Petrakos provided for the first time convincing evidence for the existence of a Jewish community on Lesbos during the 16th century.37 In the area of the Post Trajan-Valaneion, he discovered and published a funerary inscription bearing the name of a certain Nadji Ispisansa di Alba, a Jewish rabbi or cantor, who seems to have reached Lesbos after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 15th or 16th centuries. In addition to his work on Mytilene, he cleared in three campaigns (1966–68) the remains of the pseudo-dipteral Ionic temple at Mesa, in the middle of the island, excavated in 1885–86 by Koldeway. Within the covering soil of the temple, he found a hoard of 48 gold ducats of Andrea Dandolo (1343–1354).38 South of the surviving foundations, he uncovered stylobate blocks, bases, drums and parts of the stone sima.39 During his stay on Mytilene he was also able to publish several important works, two of which became sources of particular scholarly interest. The first one was published in the ’Αρχαιολογικὸν Δελτίον of 1967 and concerned the already mentioned inscription found in Rhamnous in 1960, an important decree of the year 268/67 BC. The decree refers to activities of the Athenian general Epichares, who was elected “General in charge of the coastal region of Attica” (στρατηγὸς ἐπὶ τὴν παραλίαν), near the coast of Rhamnous. According to this document, Epichares protected crops, vineyards and slaves from the Macedonians, erected his headquarters (στρατήγιον) in the sanctuary of Nemesis (obviously to control among other places the whole plain of Limiko) and built shelters for the soldiers of the Ptolemaic general Patroklos, who was sent to help the Athenians against the Antigonids.40 Petrakos’ 1967–article broke new ground in that it testified, among other matters, that during the beginning of the Chremonidean War Rhamnous was under Athenian control.41\n\n 34 38, drawings 1–7. 35 24, 368–370 pl. 378–381 (mosaics). 36 24, 370 no 1 (inscription). 37 14, 449 pl. 333 α. 38 15, 98. 39 15, 100 pl. 80α (stylobate blocks), 80β (sima); 19, 84 pl. 63β (drums). 40 13; 281b, 6–9 no. 3. 41 On the impact of this publication on our understanding of the Chremonidean War, see Oetjen 2014, 12f. notes 18–22 (lit.).\n\nXXX  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos The second work was one of his most prominent studies – the well-known monograph about Oropos and the monuments of the oracular healing sanctuary of Amphiaraos, which was published in 1968.42 It contained the history of ancient Oropos and an analytical description of the Late Classical, Hellenistic and Roman monuments of the sanctuary of Amphiaraos, whose cult was introduced at this border site during the Peloponnesian War, apparently from a place called Knopia near Thebes, where it was originally established.43 Based (a) on the results of the largely unpublished excavations of the Archaeological Society in the Aphiareion conducted between 1884 and 1930 under the directorship of Spyridon Phintiklis and Vasileios Leonardos44 and with the collaboration of Wilhelm Dörpfeld45 in the first campaigns, (b) on new research which he conducted on the monuments (inscriptions included) and (c) on the study of the relevant literary tradition, Petrakos offered a systematic monograph which completely replaced Félix Dürrbach’s 1890 dissertation on the subject.46 In this monograph Petrakos demonstrated, with his characteristic clarity and precision not only his perception of the inscriptions as “monuments who carry inscriptions” (and not just as “inscriptional writings”),47 but also his particular ability to combine meaningfully the skills of an archaeologist with those of a philologist in elucidating the historical significance of the monuments under study. Besides archaeology, the service years on Lesbos were in general very exciting and productive ones for Petrakos. This is well documented in many articles of his later periods. Mytilene was at this time still one of the most active cultural and social centres in Greece. These were the years with the intense relationship with several writers and artists who influenced him such as Asimakis Panselinos, Stratis and Miltis Paraskevaidis and Takis Eleftheriadis.48 While serving on Lesbos, but also later in Delphi, he participated in the Local Commissions on Toponyms of the Greek Ministry of Interior. From his writings one appreciates that he was not always willing to accept the decision of the Commissions\n\n 42 16. Among the new material observed by him is also an important archaic votive capital found in Sykamino(s) ca 2km west of Oropos incorporated in the Agia Eleousa church (16, 16 n. 5). On this find, see now M. Korres in this volume. 43 16, 66f. 44 On V. Leonardos s. 573. 45 On W.

Due to his efforts the wider archaeological site of Delphi (including Desfina, Arachova and Itea to the south) was declared as a “protected area”.51 As a result of this declaration the abuse of the area by man was severely curtailed. He also conducted important excavations and cleanings, including those on the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Souvala/Polydroso (ancient Erochos) in northern Phocis (formerly excavated by Christos Karouzos), where he found a great amount of pottery and small finds (figurines) ranging from the Archaic to the Hellenistic periods,52 and also those in the coastal site of Kirrha, where he recovered Middle Helladic graves and part of a Late Mycenaean settlement.53 During his stay in Delphi he also published two monographs: the Delphi Guide for visitors (1971)54 and the Νεώτερες ἐπιγραφὲς τῆς Μυτιλήνης (Modern Inscriptions of Lesbos) (1972).55 In the second study, he published important inscriptions from Lesbos of the 18th and 19th centuries found on churches, bridges, fountains and houses. By doing so he included in the publication not only the text of the inscriptions but also drawings of the architectural monuments in which they were incorporated, as well its decoration. Between 1973 and 1974 he was based in Patras, where he operated as Ephor of Antiquities and simultaneously as Inspector of Culture and Science in the Peloponnese and Western Central Greece. During this time, he published important works such as his study on the Mycenaean Oropia56 and the first edition of his Guide on the Amphiareion of Oropos (1974).57\n\n 49 194, 72. 50 Such was, as Petrakos explains, the place name “Chriso” in Phokis (an altered form for ancient “Krisa”) which was falsely transformed with “y” as “Chryso”. Decades later, in 1993, another state Council on Toponyms was of the opinion, contrary to the historical truth, that the modern place name “Mesa” should be replaced as not signifying anything in particular, but Petrakos was able to demonstrate that it was a survival of the epigraphically-attested ancient place name “Messon”, on Lesbos, a temple site where he himself had excavated in 1967 (194, 72f.). 51 Iakovidis 2000, 557. 52 28. 53 31. 54 27. 55 29. 56 34. 57 36.\n\nXXXII  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos\n\nThe Years as Ephor of the Sculpture Collection in the National Archaeological Museum (1974–1976) and Ephor of Attica (1976–1994) In 1974, Petrakos returned to Attica, to take up the position of Ephor of the Sculpture Collection in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Two years later, in 1976, he became Ephor of Attica and held that post until 1994. During his Attica-Ephorate (1976–1994), besides supervising numerous “rescue” excavations he took concrete actions to preserve the heritage of Attica’s past as well as Attica’s natural and historical landscape and to protect both (monuments and surrounding area) from destruction. These efforts included fighting against illegal digging and exporting of antiquities, attempts to control international exhibitions, actions to ensure that large areas surrounding ancient relics had been designated as archaeological sites (e.g. the relevant designation of the entire valley of Limiko, to the south of Rhamnous in 1977) or legal initiatives that led to the stopping of the construction of mines promoted by governments (as for example in the case of the marble quarries of Rhamnous in the period 1993–1995).58 However, as in his early years of service in Attica (1957–1963) both with the case of the above mentioned non-scientific restoration of the Aphaia temple on Aegina and in that of the “barbaric” use of the ancient theatre of Piraeus by Dora Stratou,59 (in which disagreement, he was strongly reproached by his supervisor I. Papadimitriou),60 so too in his mature years: his opposition to actions, which he rightly considered harmful for the monuments, in many instances was unable to turn the opinion of the official state and most of his colleages in favour of the antiquities, as was the case with his attempts to cancel the construction of the new Aegina-Museum at the archaeological site of Kolonna in 197761 or to prevent the conversion of the island of Psyttaleia near Salamis into a reservoir of sewage for the Athens basin in 1985.62 His scientific interests retained a specific geographical focus: the region of northeast Attica and especially the sites of Oropos, Marathon and especially Rhamnous. As regards Oropos: first, based on fresh examinations of the Oropian stones, which he undertook after 1976, he proposed new readings, descriptions and interpretations of the inscriptions of this border city. As a result, he published in 1980 a valuable addendum to his 1968 monograph about Oropos entitled ’Επιγραφικὰ τοῦ\n\n 58 418, 154; 493, 581 n. 39. 59 271, 71. 60 239, 106. 61 92, 20. 62 369, 33.\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XXXIII\n\n’Ωρωποῦ.63 It contained chiefly inscriptions from the ancient site near the sea (modern Skala Oropou), related especially to the cult of Halia Nymphe, in honour of whom games were celebrated in the 3rd cent. B.C. Second, in 1997 he published in a monumental monograph the definite publication of “The Inscriptions of Oropos”,64 which contained some 770 epigraphical texts from the 4th century to the Roman imperial times, among them proxeny decrees, inscriptions concerning the sanctuaries and the city, as well as dedications. It constitutes the complete corpus of Oropos inscriptions, which reveals the political, religious and to a degree the daily life of a city located on the borders of Attica. In the words of Michael H. Jameson65 a “masterful publication”, with “excellent drawings” which made “it possible to understand the nature of each monument”, a publication which set new standards in the study and publication of Greek inscriptions.66 As far as Marathon is concerned, he published in 1995 a very useful Guide on the topography, mythology and the finds stored in the Archaeological Museum of Marathon from prehistoric to Roman times with a special emphasis on the contribution of all the above data to understanding aspects of the battle of Marathon.67\n\nExcavations and Studies in Rhamnous (1975–2001) His greatest contribution to the academic discipline came, however, in his work at Rhamnous. As already stated, Petrakos’ involvement in the exploration and study of Rhamnous began in December 1959, where under the supervision of Kontis he initiated long-term works in the sanctuary of Nemesis. In 1975, he was able to resume excavations in Rhamnous and to continue hereby the pioneering work of John Peter Gandy Deering (1813–1814), Dimitrios Philios (1880), Valerios Stais (1890–1892), Jean Pouilloux (1954) and Efthymios Mastrokostas (1958). For 27 consecutive years (from 1975 to 2001) he dedicated his life to excavating systematically this Attic deme on behalf of the Archaeological Society at Athens in the quest first to dispel the scientific confusions caused by the early excavators (especially those by Stais, which were due to the lack of systematic research methods and proper documentation of his findings)68 and second to reveal its many hidden\n\n 63 48. 64 252. 65 Jameson 1999, 323. 66 So Doukellis 1998. 67 230. 68 44, 1f.\n\nXXXIV  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos secrets in order to reconstruct the real picture of the ancient deme.69 During this period, he brought to light impressive evidence for monumental sacred, funerary and defensive architecture, hundreds of new inscriptions, marble sculpture and reliefs, coins, pottery, lamps, and several other finds from different materials far beyond anyone’s expectations, in the words of Christian Habicht, “…with such success that one could perhaps say that over the last 20 years no other place on Greece … has yielded as much as Rhamnous”. 70 The research design applied by Petrakos in Rhamnous was sound and exemplary. He not only was the first in Rhamnous to open broad-based excavation areas (horizontal stratigraphy) rather than to randomly dig holes to unearth spectacular sculptures or inscriptions as earlier excavators at the site have done, but he always began with the thankless task of re-excavating finds already revealed either by earlier excavators or by looters. Whenever possible, any previous excavation was also studied along with relevevant field note diaries (e.g. the relevant pages of the 1813–diary of J. P. Deering, now in the British Museum),71 maps, historical documents, drawings and photographs. His intention was always to clarify and whenever possible to solve old scientific problems before proceeding to the new ones. Directly related to the effectiveness and successful completion of his research planning was his talent to assign within his overall research plan the right person to the right position. As far as the archaeological fieldwork was concerned, he persisted for example in digging and working with a small but very competent and dedicated staff, including the archaeologist Eleni Theocharaki who oversaw the whole excavation project until her death in 1995, the very skillful Ioannis Karamitros,72 known from his work at Mycenae and Marathon, as excavation forman, the excellent Tenian marble worker Nikos Karamalis and his son Giorgos, both with a keen eye in every matter concerning the marble monuments. As far as the final stage of the excavation process is concerned, for the final publication he hired artists for the documentation of his finds, including the painter Kostas Iliakis for the drawings of the excavated monuments, the talented conservator and artist Tasoula Voutsina for preserving the excavated artifacts and the painter Manolia Skouloudi for the drawings of the objects.73 As a result he kept during all the 27 years of the excavation meticulous records of his excavations (plans, photographs and drawings of monuments and thousands of artifacts). In a later stage, he begun to bring also scientific experts to study the human\n\n 69 99, 10. 70 Habicht 1998, 388. 71 44, 46–55. 72 360. 73 44.\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XXXV\n\nskeletal remains found in the site,74 the pottery and the small finds from the Thesmophorion75 and to conduct geophysical surveys in order to define the form of the two harbours of Rhamnous.76 Some results of this research principle are mentioned below, selectively using cases relating to all three constitutional parts of the deme: the Nemesis-sanctuary, the funerary periboloi and the fort. The Nemesis Sanctuary: By clearing the debris of the old excavations of Stais in the sanctuary of Nemesis, Petrakos recovered hundreds of fragments of the base of the cult statue of Agoracritus’ Nemesis, to which other fragments already found by him in the National Archaeological Museum have been attached. This led to the restudy and reconstruction of the base, three faces of which carried relief sculptures known from Pausanias’ description (1.33.8) as showing the story of Helen brought by her mother Nemesis to be reared by Leda.77 Through Petrakos’ new reconstruction it became clear that Pausanias’ description of the base is inaccurate since it refered to fewer (12) human figures than actually existed (14 or 15 as well as two horses). He also showed that reconstructions previously proposed for the form of the base were also misleading, since the base was in reality constructed of two Pentelic marble blocks and the crowning element was of black Eleusinian marble. In the same debris, he recovered also a great number of architectural elements which have been identified as belonging to the classical Temple of Nemesis,78 the latest of a series of four temples which were erected in the sanctuary of the Goddess. These identifications enabled the restoration of the entablature of the classical temple,79 a process which began in August 1980 within a building constructed by him in 1979 for this very purpose. The building which also included under its roof the reconstructed base of the cult statue of Nemesis,80 has continued until our days to protect the monuments but at the same time it operates as a site-museum for study purposes. Furthermore, it was especially pleasant to him to confirm through these recoveries an earlier opinion expressed about a puzzled dedicatory epigram by Jean Pouilloux, his teacher in Lyon. It concerns the epigram IG II2 3105, which has been also known since Stais’ campaign of 1891. Through the addition of two new marble fragments Petrakos was able to certify that this epigram was in fact an Ephebic document dated to 332/1 BC, as Pouilloux had suggested years before.81  74 577c, 348 (investigation of grave 8 in the north-east cemetery conducted in 2000 by Anna Lagia). 75 Nawracala 2014. 76 577a, 328 (conducted between 2003 and 2011 by David Blackman and his team). 77 68; 281a, 251–266. 78 577b, 273–311. 79 118, fig. 20. 80 118, fig. 19. 81 44, 69: “Στὴν περίπτωση τούτη ἡ σωστὴ εἰκασία τοῦ δασκάλου μου Jean Pouilloux δικαιώθηκε πανηγυρικά, ἔστω καὶ μὲ καθυστέρηση 24 χρόνων”.\n\nXXXVI  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos Petrakos’ meticulous examination of the finds as well as his holistic approach to the publication of the results of the older and his own excavations in the Nemesis sanctuary stands as a model for a sanctuary excavation and publication. His final publication includes not only the reconstruction of the base of the Nemesis statue and catalogues accompanied with numerous photos and line drawings of the architectural fragments of the classical temple and its three predecessors, but also thorough catalogues of all the – mostly votive – objects found in the sanctuary terrace fill and in the fill within the ill-started shaft of the north spring-house. As a result, the “Nemesion” of Rhamnous82 can be regarded as one of the most throroughly investigated sanctuaries in Attica, especially for the period between the second quarter of the 6th until the mid 5th centuries BC. The Funerary Periboloi. On the sacred way to the south and north of the Nemesis sanctuary several funerary periboloi (family graves), excavated between 1890 and 1892 by Stais and which had been left scattered in the field, undocumented and unprotected, have been studied by Petrakos and some new restorations of their appearance have been proposed. These include the family graves and their associated grave stelae, grave reliefs and marble funeral vases (loutrophoroi, lekythoi) – originally displayed above the front wall of the periboloi for public viewing – of important Rhamnousians of the 4th century BC such as Menestides and Euphranor (whose inscription reveals that he was 105 at his death) to the south sacred way or Diogeiton, Phanokrates, Pytharchos to the northern and most importantly the remarkable funerary peribolos of the conspicuous family of Hierokles.83 The Fort. Already in 1977 but especially after the beginning of the 1990s Petrakos turned his attention to the coastal acropolis with the classical fort. Through his excavation method (clearing the full horizontal extent of the acropolis) he revealed great parts of the settlement within the fort basically in its latest phase, that is of the Roman period. But he also revealed older material dating back from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age, and especially from the Archaic and Classical through the Hellenistic periods. This older material came to light either after digging test pits, because of its secondary use (e.g. the re-use of the flat and durable inscriptions as building material in the houses) or as a result of secondary processes (redepositions, mixed strata). A characteristic example of the first case is a votive deposit especially of blackfigured kylikes, skyphoi and kraters dating from c. 565 to 475 BC which he found within the so called Gymnasion. These votive vases had been deposited there presumably after they had lost their primary function. The deposit, which has been con-\n\n 82 577b. 83 On the funerary peribolos of Hierokles s. 41, 49, 281a, 387–399.

By documenting always their physical support and find place, Petrakos was able to publish (or to republish with enhanced and expanded versions of old readings) a total of c. 980 inscriptions from the site which constitutes the greatest number of inscriptions among the Attic demes. These inscriptions were dated mainly to the Hellenistic period and include decrees mostly of the Athenian garrison stationed in Rhamnous (often together with the demotai of Rhamnous) honouring Generals by describing their duties,85 dedicatory86 and funerary87 inscriptions and graffiti88 and other written documents reflecting the daily life within and outside the fortress. His meticulous studies led also to corrections in the reference corpus of the Inscriptiones Graecae. As in the case of the marble fragments deriving from the fill of the Nemesis-sanctuary, where Petrakos revealed that several inscriptions which were until then published as being decrees of the demos of Sounion, e.g. the lease of land at Herme IG II2 2493 (339/8 BC)89 or the “deme decree” II2 1181 from Sounion90 were not from Sounion but in fact belonged to Rhamnous. It turned out that the confusion was due to the fact that in the turn of the 20th century, when Stais transported some inscriptions which he found in Rhamnous to the National Archaeological Museum along with inscriptions from Sounion. Many of these inscriptions are of great historical interest (for example the already mentioned decree honouring General Epichares for services during the Chremonidean War). Others are of special chronological value since they supplied important contributions to a better understanding of the Athenian calendar (e.g. the honorific decree for General Archandros, which helped to specify the chronology of the Diomedon’s archonship in the year 248/7 BC.91). Others, in turn, document important religious practices such as the decision of the demos of Rhamnous to make an annual sacrifice to king Antigonos Gonatas (form of deification)92 or the existence in Rhamnous of a specific group of youths, named “κρυπτοί”,93 which have been described as being different from the normal citizen\n\n 84 577a, 226–271 figs 94–125.

The word indicates a special relationship with the Spartan kryptoi, the age group which underwent the Greek rites of passage, where young people were subjected to trials before being incorporated in the community.94 Petrakos’ ability to appreciate quickly the significance of his findings, combined with the careful and swift documentation of his excavations resulted in regular, detailed and comprehensive preliminary reports published uninterruptedly for 27 years in the journal Πρακτικὰ τῆς ἐν ’Αθήναις ’Αρχαιολογικῆς Ἑταιρείας (ΠΑΕ),95 including also an important report of the campaign of 1978 with a summary of his first five years of research which appeared in the ’Αρχαιολογικὴ ’Εφημερίς (ΑΕ) of 1979, the latter an example of Petrakos’ method and erudition.96 The final results of these excavations have been presented in the Βιβλιοθήκη τῆς ἐν ’Αθήναις ’Αρχαιολογικῆς Ἑταιρείας (ΒΑΕ), the publications series of the Archaeological Society at Athens. There are six volumes in total (I-VI) published under the title Ὁ δῆμος τοῦ Ραμνοῦντος: one volume on topography (I), two on epigraphy, graffiti, weights and written evidence (I, VI), one on the fortress (III), one on the Nemeseion (IV) and one on coins, lamps and sculpture (V).97\n\nSecretary General of the Archaeological Society at Athens (1988–Present) While still serving as Ephor of Attica, in June 1988, at the age of 56, distinguished for his passionate determination in protecting and publishing Greek antiquities and for being one of the most brilliant and prolific members of the Archaeological Service in Greece (both as Epimeletes and as Ephor), Petrakos was elected as the 11th Secretary General of the Archaeological Society at Athens, replacing in this position the prominent Aegean archaeologist Georgios Mylonas. It was the first time that a state archaeologist – and not a university-based archaeologist, philologist or architect – was elected to this position. Founded in 1837 with the aim to support scientifically the young Greek Archaeological Service in its tasks of the protection, study and presentation of Greek antiquities, the Archaeological Society played – besides the splendid results of its field activities at important archaeological sites such as Akrotiri on Thera, Mycenae, Zakros, Vergina, Epidaurus, Messene, Dodona, Eleusis or Brauron, to name only some typical\n\n 94 Ma 2008, 194. 95 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 50, 53, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 71, 77, 87, 103, 117, 154, 181, 214, 229, 242, 251, 267, 280, 293, 304. 96 44. 97 281a–b; 577a–d.\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XXXIX\n\nexamples – a crucial role also in the construction of the identity and national unity of the modern Greek nation-state. Following Mylonas’ death in April 1988, however, the Society had fallen into a crisis – seemingly of financial, but in reality of a deep-rooted existential nature. For decades the institution had been slowly declining towards something akin to fossilization. Consequently, Petrakos was faced with a number of problems,98 caused not only by the mismanagement of grant funds, but also by the non-publication of the archaeological fieldwork sponsored by the Archaeological Society by those archaeologists responsible for it. As a solution he proposed a set of significant and innovative measures.99 In the next decades, Petrakos committed himself with all his energy, initiative as well as his organizational and administrative skills, to the materialization of these measures. These constituted a break with the past. In retrospect, it is fair to say that under his leadership the Society not only survived the critical years of 1987–1988, but actually entered into a period of rapid academic development and social responsibility. This finally led to the transformation of the Archaeological Society from a basically funding mechanism for archaeological excavations to a real research-oriented institution,100 generating also innovative ways to engage broader parts of the scientific community, especially younger people, in this research. The most important measures taken by Petrakos in order to master these problems can be summarized as follows: (a) Excavating less and instead investing in long-unpublished material brought to light by excavations sponsored by the Archaeological Society. In order to overcome the widespread failure to publish in a timely manner the enormous quantity of the material from excavations of the Society, material long residing in repositories and slowly being forgotten over the course of time, he decided first to limit the number of new excavations carried out by the Archaeological Society and second to initiate an editorial project aiming to increase final publications of excavations in which the Society was directly involved.101 At the same time he encouraged the study of material housed in museum-magazines and warehouses.102 This project eventually proved to be a pragmatic solution, since he managed to push up the number of publications in the series of the Archaeological Society (Βιβλιοθήκη τῆς ἐν ’Αθήναις ’Αρχαιολογικῆς Ἑταιρείας), which for the most part constitute detailed  98 493, 568. 99 127, 1f. 100 In a declaration of intent already published by Petrakos in 1987 in the Ideography of the Archaeological Society (72, 181) he speaks of “a scientific centre of Greek archaeology”. 101 72, 197: “Καιρὸς εἶναι νὰ πάψουν οἱ ἄσκοπες ἀνασκαφὲς καὶ νὰ καταπιαστοῦμε, ὅποιος ἔχει διάθεση καὶ ἐπιστημονικὴ δυνατότητα, μὲ τὴ μελέτη τῶν πραγματικὰ μεγάλων ἀνασκαφῶν τοῦ παρελθόντος. Αὺτὰ ποὺ κινδυνεύουν τὰ φροντίζει ἡ Ὑπηρεσία. Πρέπει νὰ σωθοῦν αὐτὰ ποὺ κινδυνεύουν νὰ λησμονηθοῦν”. 102 493, 565–569.\n\nXL  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos publications of the results of the Society’s excavations, to an unprecented record: he rapidly tripled the number of the volumes published in the first 150 years of the Society’s existence from 106 in 1988 to 327 in 2020. With this strategy of publishing the results of old excavations, he gave at the same time the opportunity to younger archaeologists (including the present writer) to analyze and to publish material from old excavations. (b) He developed an effective archival infrastructure and a proper archival policy in order to ensure the preservation and dissemination of the archives of the Archaeological Society for present and future generations of researchers. Until 1988, various categories of the valuable archive of the Archaeological Society at Athens (papers, photographs, drawings, diaries) were deposited in the basements of its main building, on Panepistimiou Str. 22, widly scattered, the majority of them unclassified and inactive. Based on personal knowledge he had gained from his involvement 30 years earlier (1958) in the organization of the archive of personal papers and manuscripts (copies of the Secretary’s letters, archives of several archaeologists, original correspondence, secreterail papers) and already fully aware firstly of the fact that the Archaeological Society had a considerable amount of archived material from the 19th and 20th centuries and secondly that such material comprised a valuable research resource for the study of Greek archaeology, he proceeded to a systematic classification and conservation of the entire collection of original information records concerning Greek antiquities in order to facilitate access and usage of the documents by a variety of researchers. This collection, which is a result of generations of archaeologists leaving personal and fieldwork-related material to the Archaeological Society because of its place at the foreground of archaeological research, comprised until 1988 three main categories: (1) personal archives of archaeologists (excavation diaries included), (2) photographic material and (3) drawings. (1) Examples of personal archives of archaeologists from 1837 onwards included (a) the important archive-diary of Panagiotis Efstratiadis, who acted as General Ephoros of Antiquities from 1863 to 1884; (b) papers and manuscripts related to Panagiotis Stamatakis and his work in Mycenae, especially letters of Stamatakis to the Archaeological Society containing reports of his activities with descriptions of the antiquities he found and the places he saw; (c) the extensive archives of earlier Secretary Generals of the Archaeological Society such as those of Stephanos Ath. Koumanoudis (Secretary General from 1859 to 1894) or Georgios Oikonomos (Secretary General from 1924 to 1951), to name but a few. Realizing that the Archaeological Society was well placed to develop historiographical research because of the depth and breadth of its archival holdings, Petrakos actively requested the deposit and donation of archival materials of members of the Archaeological Society and of other archaeologists of the Archaeological Service who posess archival material related to Greek archaeology. By incorporating after 1988 new and important archives of archaeologists into the Society’s archive collections\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XLI\n\nhe made the Archaeological Society an important central archival authority. Among these newly bequested archives, which were acquired solely due to his own actions, belong the valuable archive of drawings, scientific notes and photographs of the architect and architectural historian Ioannis Travlos, donated to the Society by its family in 1993,103 the archive of Ioannis Papadimitriou, donated by his son in 1994, a large part of the archive of Christos Karouzos,104 the archive of Dimitrios Pallas and a great part of the archival holdings of Apostolos Arvanitopoulos, including many diaries concerning the Society’s excavations in Thessaly, donated to the Society by the Second Ephoreia. (2) The second category of the collection comprises the photographic archive, which includes both negatives and positive images. The photographic archive, totally unknown before 1988, after the 1990s received constant requests to supply data related to the Greek monuments and the excavations of the Archaeological society. Tens of thousands of photos were for the first time available to researchers. (3) The same holds true for the drawings archive, which was also organized for the first time: thousands of original drawings (architectural plans, object drawings, maps) and artwork (paintings of Émile Gilliéron fils and Alekos Kontopoulos) have been conserved and made available to researchers. Furthermore, he increased public access to these archives. This has been achieved on the one hand through utilising modern technology (all the archival collections have been digitized and large portions of these became available via webbased links) and on the other through exhibitions performed within the central building of the Archaeological Society. Examples of the latter include the 1990 exhibition displaying photographs and drawings from the excavations of Wilhelm Dörpfeld105 and the 2005 exhibition entitled “Peloponnesos 1910, photographic documents” displaying photographs taken in 1910 by the Royal Prussian Photogrammetry Institution under the direction of the German architectural historian Theodor von Lüpke, which had been sent to the Archaeological Exhibition held in Rome in 1911.106 In the context of the dissemination of archaeological data in wider cicles it should also be noted that he provided users of the library of the Archaeological Society, one of the best archaeological libraries in Greece, with an on-line catalogue with advanced search options and enhanced content, such as summaries/abstracts and tables of contents in each item. (c) He initiated an entirely new research area: Research programs related to the ancient monuments and cults of Athens and Attica. Besides the many research pro-\n\n 103 183. 104 233, 185f. 105 112. 106 345.\n\nXLII  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos grams which he, as Secretary General, promoted, either sponsoring them, as the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (LGPN) project, or hosting them in the central building of the Society, such as the Greek department of Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (LIMC), he initiated and developed under his direction three research programs related to the study of ancient Athens and Attica. The first one, the Archive of the Monuments of Athens and Attica (ΑΡΜΑ), is a corpus of data comprising every possible source of information related to antiquities (e.g. from hard to find Greek journals of the 19th century such as Philistor, Athenaion, Ora, Ephemeris ton Philomathon) excavated or found in Athens and Attica in the last two centuries. The study is especially important for the 19th century, when regular publication of the excavations conducted in modern sense did not exist. The data were classified on the basis of topographic position and monument category, synthetically presented in order to gain a more complete picture of ancient Athens. In the second one, the Corpus of Attic Funerary Monuments (ΣΕΜΑ), he applied his solid method of examining not only the inscriptions as writings but also the archaeological aspect of the monuments, their physical support.107 The third project, which is still active, is a very useful collection of testimonia on the ancient cults of Athens and Attica. All of these projects have been conducted at the central building of the Archaeological Society by a team of experts in Greek epigraphy.108 (d) He initiated the School of Teaching the History of Art. In compliance with one of the initial aims of the Archaeological Society, he promoted the dissemination of knowledge in wider cicles of the Greek society regarding the history of ancient (Greek and Roman) and modern civilization (art and literature) by initiating the School of Teaching the History of Art.109 The latter owes much, especially after 2003, to the energy and organizing talent of his most trusted advisor and co-editor of this present volume, Dora Vassilikou. (e) With articles in journals, especially in the newly founded Mentor and with substantial and significant public speeches at the Archaeological Society at Athens (fig. 2), he attempted to create an interest in the fate of Greek antiquities – especially among the modern Greeks – and to persuade public opinion that a revision of current attitudes and policies towards antiquities was necessary to avoid further destruction.\n\n 107 184, 4. 108 The results of these research projects have been published by the epigraphists Georgios Papadopoulos, Voula Bardani and Georgia Malouchou and by the archaeologist Ourania Vizyinou as separate monographs in the publication series of the Archaeological Society (ΑΡΜΑ: BAE 127, 136, 177, 247, 265, 304; ΣΕΜΑ: BAE 241). 109 72, 181.\n\nVasileios Petrakos: A Life Dedicated to the Service of Greek Archaeology  XLIII\n\nFig. 2: Vasileios Petrakos, while lecturing in the Great Hall of the Archaeological Society at Athens.

Vassilikou.\n\nBesides becoming the general editor of the three already mentioned main periodicals of the Society, Praktika (ΠΑΕ), Archaeologike Ephemeris (ΑΕ) and Ergon (Ἔργον), in 1988 he launched a new one featuring contributions primarily about the history of Greek archaeology, to which he was the chief contributor: the ’Ενημερωτικὸ Δελτίο τῆς ἐν ’Αθήναις ’Αρχαιολογικῆς Ἑταιρείας (EΔAE), a Newsletter of the Archaeological Society, which after 1992 was called ὁ Μέντωρ (Mentor). In many of his Mentor articles and in the introductory speeches in the Ergon each May, Petrakos presented himself as an outspoken and often aggressive critic of acts, contemporary tendencies and attitudes he considered harmful for the Greek antiquities. These include not only acts with obvious irreversible harms such as looting, smuggling and desecrating antiquities but also others such as the opportunictic modern use of archaeological sites and ancient monuments (e.g. ancient theatres) for personal and commercial gain110 or the borrowing of antiquities for travelling exhibitions. The latter had been considered by him also as a harmful act since, ultimately, even a temporary display of an arti-\n\n 110 241, 126.\n\nXLIV  Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos fact can lead to the desire to acquire such a piece for a permanent collection, promoting in this way its cultural and economic value and, consequently, the illegal antiquities trade. As Secretary General of the Archaeological Society as well as a former Ephor of Attica, he succeeded in 2002 through his efforts in raising international awareness and in turning much of the scholarly opinion against building activities on the Marathon plain for the Olympics in 2004, the site being of great historical importance, since it was there that the Athenians and Plataeans defeated the Persians in 490 BC. But, as the construction of the Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre in Schinias finally showed, unfortunately, he had little success in changing the thinking of the official state and of most of his colleages.\n\nStudies in the History of Greek Archaeology Definition of Subject and Method In addition to his archaeological and epigraphical work Petrakos developed in the early 1980s a strong interest on the historiography and history of Greek archaeology, which has been intensified in the following decades. The term “History of Greek archaeology” is typically understood either as the history of the development of the Greek branch of classical archaeology as an academic discipline (Bronze Age archaeology usually included, at least in name) or more generally still as a history of the exploration of the Greek world, sometimes even as a pure narrative of spectacular finds which have been through the ages brought to light in Greece. Petrakos concentrates on features of different sort. “History of Greek Archaeology” is for him the history of protecting, uncovering and publishing Greek antiquities. To Petrakos historiography of Greek archaeology is basically a history of the institutionalized, professionalized or “scientific” Archaeology in Greece, which begins conventionally on 21 October 1829 with the foundation of the National Museum of Aegina by Ioannis Kapodistrias under the directorship of Andreas Moustoxydis111 and comprises roughly the past 200 years. Obviously, the best way to look at this issue is through surveying the development of the three main Greek institutions devoted to the above topic: The Archaeological Service (’Αρχαιολογικὴ Ὑπηρεσία), The Archaeological Society at Athens (Ἡ ἐν ’Αθήναις ’Αρχαιολογικὴ Ἑταιρεία) and the archaeological departments of the University.
