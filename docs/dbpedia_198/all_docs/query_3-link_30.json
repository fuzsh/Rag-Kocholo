        "text": "In this paper I intend to provide an analysis of Thucydides's account of war in the third section of his historical work (3.82-83). Despite some of his early commentators accused him of a certain obscurity, the notions of polemos and stasis he introduces in this text deserve to be discussed and can give a number of insights into the problem of civil war in Western history. My core argument is that there is a clear analogy between Thucydides's concept of stasis, from one hand, and Simone Weil's reflexions on totalitarianism and Klemperer's notebook on Nazi language, from the other hand. In this perspective, not only violence but also propaganda as a manipulation of language are important characteristics of stasis.\n\nThis paper will argue that a specific and coherent argument about power and empire can be drawn out of Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War. Through the use of dramatic juxtaposition in the narrative and through common themes in several speeches, the History illustrates that bearing and exercising power produces a kind of character and logic that limits itself. The character of the powerful will tend to limit itself by virtue of ignoring the existential insecurity caused by fortune in human affairs as well as the ‘reverse law of the stronger,’ meaning that imperial subjects will have a natural tendency to rebel against that imperial power. Methodological issues about whether coherent arguments can be drawn from the History and about the intentions of Thucydides himself in shaping his narrative will be discussed, as will several possible counter-arguments. These latter possible refutations include the issue of agency against the structuralist implications of this power thesis in Thucydides and the counter-case that Sparta provides - an empire that explicitly does not arrogantly ignore fortune and act aggressively as a result. The final implications are that, if a coherent thesis about power can be drawn out of the History, and regardless of the intentions of Thucydides in possibly placing that argument in his text, can a thesis about the constitutive and self-limiting effects of power be applied beyond the world of the Peloponnesian war and, if so, what does this mean for the powerful in the contemporary world?\n\nThroughout the Histories, Thucydides is sensitive to the significance of an individual’s perception of events to that individual’s actions. His regular use of verbs such as αἰσθάνομαι—Xenophon is the only extant writer to use it more frequently—and ὁράω is a testament to the important role that perception plays in the Histories (University of Chicago, Perseus Digital Library, s.v. “αἰσθάνομαι”, http://perseus.uchicago.edu). Thucydides consistently emphasizes that the “fog of war” and lack of perception often shape the course of events. In this paper, I will investigate Thucydides’ presentation of misperception in his narrative of events in north-western Greece and the Chalcidian Peninsula from 433 to 4321 and the significance of this for our understanding of warfare in the Histories.\n\nThis proposal intends to explore the issue of awareness of contemporary events, especially of internal conflicts (staseis), through Herodotus’ and Thucydides’ Histories. It has been rightly noticed that Thucydides shows great interest in Greek conflicts (Gehrke 1985). Thucydides’ narrative offers to the reader an extraordinary set of staseis and prodosiai, happening in concomitance with external attacks, in which local interests are closely interwoven with those of the two hegemonic powers, Athens and Sparta. But in very few cases Thucydides deals with social-economic grounds of local revolutions (Thuc. 8.21; 5.4.2-4; 4.84.1-2 and 88.1-2; cf. Fisher 2000), and staseis are mostly seen as moments of conflict between demos/plethos and dynatoi/oligoi, whose social contexts are generally omitted or treated in a simplified way. Scholars explained this as a result of Thucydides’ political ‘ideology’ that would lead him to represent internal conflicts as seditions caused and fomented by contrasts of ideological nature. In coherence with his historiographical project and dealing with the biggest conflict ever–the Peloponnesian war–Thucydides is mainly concerned with finding oscillations between Athens and Sparta among their allies, and with clarifying the allies’ aligning with the one side or the other (Moggi 1999). Conflicts in Herodotus are frequent, even though they are not portrayed in that crystallised form found in Thucydides, that is as conflicts between polloi and oligoi, the former being supporters of Athens and the latter of Sparta. This paper will discuss events which both Herodotus and Thucydides report, or passages which seem to contain allusions to a shared set of historical memories. Herodotus might be influenced by early happenings of the Peloponnesian war, and might know of the events that Thucydides went on to describe, seeing them in similar ways. Nevertheless, while speaking of stasis is he also thinking of the Thucydidean narrative as well? Does he know Thucydides’ own early versions, perhaps oral ones, of what would eventually become the Histories? (cf. Hornblower 2010)."
