HIGGINS This book is concerned with jewellery from classical lands from the Early Bronze Age (about 2500 bc) to the late Roman period (about ad 400). It thus covers some 3000 years of almost continuous development. A full account of the technical methods of making jewellery is followed by a description, period by period, of the jewellery itself. Some periods, such as the Etruscan, have already been studied, but others, such as the Minoan and Mycenaean, have been almost completely neglected by students of ancient jewellery. The author, who is an Assistant Keeper in the British Museum, is particularly fortunate in having at his disposal what is probably the finest general collection of ancient jewellery in the world. There are 68 pages of plates (four in colour), in most of which the objects are reproduced life-size, and a number of line-drawings to illustrate particular points. 70s UNIVERSITY PAPERBACKS UP2 Form and Meaning in Drama Grahame Clark 12^6 UPS Greek Political Theory Ernest Barker 12^6 UP9 Plato: The Han and his Work A.

SUPPLEMENTUM EPIGRAPHICUM GRAECUM S.E.G. is published regularly as a review of Greek Epigraphy. As far as possible, it gives references to work done during each year on or relating to Greek inscriptions, and reprints new or emended texts. This offers a service which, it is hoped, is of value not only to epigraphic speciahsts but also to classical scholars in general. To assist him in making the Supplementum as com- plete as possible, the editor would be grateful if scholars who publish studies on Greek Epigraphy, or substantially using epigraphic material, would send him a notice (or if possible a reprint) of their work. Their co-operation in this way would be greatly appreciated. All communications should be addressed to the Editor A. G. WOODHEAD, CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND 1 L CAMBRIDGE EPIGRAPHICAL COLLECTION The attention of members is drawn to the collection of squeezes of Greek inscriptions in the Museum of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge. This collection already contains about 2,5^00 squeezes. These are drawn mainly from Attica and Asia Minor ; but additions are constantly being made from all parts of the Greek world. Members of the Society who may wish to consult this collection are cordially invited to do so ; and in special cases arrangements can be made for sending out a small number of squeezes on loan by post. The Museum authorities would also receive most gratefully any squeezes in private possession which their owners might wish to make available for general use. Enquiries should be addressed to THE LIBRARIAN, MUSEUM OF CLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY LITTLE ST. MARY’S LANE, CAMBRIDGE A Companion to HOMER edited by ALAN J. B. WAGE and FRANK H. STUBBINGS A magnificent, superbly illustrated guide to the Epics. No other volume gives the student of Homer so much basic information. ‘A triumph of scholarly team-work . . . impressive . . . richly rewarding.’ The Times. 'The long awaited companion to Homeric studies has appeared at last. It certainly was well worth waiting for. Here in a handsomely produced and amply illustrated volume of over six hundred pages are twenty-three authoritative chapters on every important aspect of the Homeric poems — linguistic, literary, historical and archaeological^ — by a constellation of leading British and American scholars. The editors have succeeded admirably in their task of arranging the multifarious material. In all, this is probably the finest and fullest aid (and stimulus) to Homeric study that has ever appeared in print.’ Prof. W. B. Stanford {The Guardian) 40 plates and line-drawings. ^4 4s. od.

MACMILLAN & CO* LTD., St. Martin’s Street, London, W.C.2 The Local Scripts of Archaic Greece A Study of the origin of the Greek alphabet and its development from the eighth to the fifth centuries B.c. L. H, JEFFERY This work constructs, for Greek inscriptions, a chronological system (divided tentatively into 25-year periods) like those generally accepted for Greek sculpture and pottery. It surveys the origin and dissemination of the alphabet among the city states, the development and content of early inscriptions, the techniques of the craftsmen, and discusses the inscriptions of each state. Illustrated £7 75 net Oxford Alonographs on Classical Archaeology Greek Scenic Conventions in the 5th Century B.C. P. D. ARNOTT In this view of Greek play production it is argued that the fifth-century theatre did possess a raised stage; that scene-painting in the modem sense was unknown; and that convention was used more extensively than is even now realized. Euripides’ growing tendency towards greater stage illusion is examined, and many stage problems are investigated. 275 6d net Popular Ethics in Ancient Greece LIONEL PEARSON This study deals with the ethical thought of the common man in classical Greece, as distinguished from the more sophisticated ideas and systems of the Greek philosophers. 44s net Stanford University Press Early Christianity and Greek Paideia WERNER JAEGER In this presentation Professor Jaeger distils the essence of the massive historical analysis projected in the Preface to the last volumes of Paideia. This essence is the historical continuity and transformation of the tradition of Greek paideia in the Christian centuries of late antiquity. 21s net Harvard University Press Greek Scholars in Venice Studies in the Dissemination of Greek Learning from Byzantium to Western Europe DENO JOHN GEANAKOPLOS Mr Geanakoplos discusses five representative Greek emigrant scholars from Byzantium and Venetian-dominated Crete who were instrumental in promoting Hellenic studies in the West, particularly in Venice during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, when Venice became the chief centre of Greek studies in Europe. 605 net Harvard University Press OXFORD PAPERBACKS Aristotle Fundamentals of the History of his Development WERNER JAEGER Translated with the author* s corrections and additions hy RICHARD ROBINSON In this classic study, the late Professor Jaeger profoundly altered the general view of Aristotle among philosophers and classical scholars by showing that he was not uncompromisingly opposed to Plato but developed gradually, applying step by step his particular genius to the problems of his age. {Second edition) js 6d net Sophocles: Three Tragedies Antigone; Oedipus the King; Electra Translated into English verse by a. d. f. kitto These three new versions by Professor Kitto are faithful as translations and vigorous and straightforward both to read and to act. 6s net OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS A History of Greek Philosophy Volume One W. K. C. GUTHRIE Professor Guthrie is writing a comprehensive and readable history of Greek philosophy from its beginnings to the Hellenistic age. It will embody the achieve- ments of modem scholarship and is to be completed in five volumes. The first volume. The Earlier Presocratics and Pythagoreans^ covers in detail the period from the Milesian school to the Pythagoreans and HeracUtus. Volume /, 555. net The Songs of Homer G. S. KIRK A vivid and comprehensive account of the backgroimd and development of the Homeric poems and of their quality as literature. The epics are seen primarily as oral poetry, and from this view follows an illuminating discussion of the problems of authorship and transmission. Mr Kirk’s criticism is acute rather than devout and his book gives the classical scholar new insight into Homeric problems. 405. net The Cambridge Ancient History The first two volumes are being revised and they are being issued in paperbound fascicles to prevent delay in publication.

The political history of Miletos in the mid-fifth century has until recently been recon- structed from five pieces of most reliable evidence, four of them epigraphical, of which three are contemporary with the events concerned.^ I. The First Quota-List^ From this it appears that Aliletos failed to pay tribute to Athens in 454/3: instead (coL vi 19-22), three talents were found by MiX^otoi \\ Aepo and a further sum by \\Mi\\XeaLoi I [€Ac T]etxtoaae[?. There are no Alilesian entries for 453/2, and Aliletos herself only resumed payment in 452/1, as recorded in List III (col. ii 28). From this, and from comparison with the contemporary situation at Erythrai and with later events at Kolophon,^ it is inferred that Aliletos was in revolt in 454/3, the loyal, pro-Athenian, party having taken refuge in Leros and Teichioussa, and that the revolt had been put down in time for the collection of 452/1.^ II. Athenian Regulations for Miletos, 450/49^ This securely dated decree provides for the election of five Athenian magistrates to serve as advisers to the Aisymnetes and Prosetairoi of Aliletos (lines 4-7) : Athenian inter- ference in the internal government of allied states was the regular consequence of revolt. The apparent discrepancy between the date of this decree and that given by the quota-lists for the end of the revolt is readily explained. The decree does not give the text of the oath required from a rebellious ally after surrender. Therefore there was a previous decree containing the oath together with the first regulations, to which the surviving decree is supplementary.

Milesian Banishment Decree^ The surviving fragment of a local Milesian inscription, which from its letter-forms is thought to be not far from the middle of the fifth century, provides for the perpetual outlawry of the sons of Nympharetos, and of Alkimos ^ For statements of the earlier view, see A.

The inclusion of descendants yet unborn virtually proves that the offence thus punished was treason.\"^ V. Milesian Decree of 380/793.0.® The preamble shows that at that date Miletos had a constitution modelled on the Athenian, with Epistates and Prytaneis bearing Athenian tribe-names. We learn else- where that ostracism was practised in the city.^ Such a constitution must have been intro- duced before the end of Athenian supremacy in 412. And if it was retained after the end of this dominion, then it cannot have been a novelty in 412.^® The simple hypothesis which this evidence suggested was that the revolt of 454/3 was crushed by the Athenians in 452/ 1 ; that it was initiated by the ^eXTiaroi whom the Athenians had favoured, and ended in their banishment; and that two Athenian regulatory decrees established a new democratic political system. There is an insuperable objection to this hypothesis. The Athenian regulations of 450/49 make it clear that the sacred college of Aisymnetes and Prosetairoi still formed the government in that year; and that the constitu- tion was oligarchic, not democratic Hence it is hard to suppose that the revolt of 454 had itself been oligarchic ; though it remains formally possible that a close oligarchy had revolted, and had then been succeeded by one more broadly based. But the natural conclusion is that the revolt had been the work of a tyrant; that pseudo-Xenophon refers to the government in power in and after 450/49; and that his evidence proves that a fresh revolt took place after that date. A vague lower limit may be supplied from his phrase ivTos oXtyov xpovov. The new hypothesis was put forward by Meiggs, who suspected that the second revolt took place in 448/7, since Miletos seems not to have paid tribute in that year and to have made her payment late in the following year,^^ This argument was rejected by the authors of Athenian Tribute Lists, who consider that Miletos’ failure to pay in 448/7 reflects ‘part of the widespread indecision which resulted from the Peace of Kal- lias’.^® They believe that Miletos made two payments in 447/6, one for the current year and one in arrears — whereas tribute lost by revolt was not customarily exacted from the succeeding loyal government.^^ More recently, the question has been re-examined by Earp, who finds a better date for Meiggs’ second revolt.^^ Miletos paid in 447/6, and her tribute was halved to five talents from 443/2 onwards, while there is no evidence that she paid at all from 446/5 to 444/3. The suggestion is that she was in revolt during these years, and that the tribute was reduced to reward her recovery. Earp further suggests that the banishment decree was directed against the oligarchic leaders of this second revolt. A closer examination of the evidence confirms both parts of Earp’s hypothesis, and gives body to the bare bones of his outline, in particular explaining why the Athenians should have supported an oligarchic government after the first revolt. We have seen that the Milesian banishment decree, with its provision for the perpetual outlawry of whole families, must have been passed for the punishment of treason; and it is reasonable to assume that the treason was committed in one or other of the two revolts. But in which? That is, can those proscribed be the party defeated in 453/2, or must their ’ Cf. the Athenian decree against Arthmios of Zeleia, quoted by Dem., Phil, 42. avxov Kal yivo:;, ® Th.

Earp, ‘Athens and Miletus ca. 450 b . c .’, Phoenix viii (1954) 142-7, esp. 144^ MILESIAN POLITICS AND ATHENIAN PROPAGANDA 3 condemnation relate to another occasion? It has been commonly supposed that this inscription records a 'law against tyrants’, passed after the revolt of 454.^® Earp sensibly inquires why more than one family is included, though he recognises that a joint tyranny of two brothers is possible; 'While there are numerous instances of brothers sharing in a tyranny . . ., a joint tyranny by members of different families would be unique.’^^ The difficulty goes further than that. The surviving part of the inscription is carried on a marble base which once held a stele. The opening part of the decree was carved on the stele itself, and what we have is merely an overflow. The decree may therefore be pre- sumed to have been quite long, and in all probability embraced a much greater number of families than the two whose names open our fragment. The most illuminating study of this inscription was published by Glotz more than half a century ago. He argued that the purpose of the decree was to banish the Neileid clan, who claimed descent from Neileus, son of King Kodros of Athens (himself descended from Neleus of Pylos) and founder of Ionian Miletos (Hdt. ix 97; Paus. vii 2.1).^® This was suggested by two of the names preserved, those of Alkimos and Kresphontes the sons of Stratonax. Alkimos was a son of Pylian Neleus.^® The name of Kresphontes is Messenian : its legendary bearer was that land’s Herakleid conqueror, but he settled down amicably with the pre-Dorian population. The name is in fact wholly confined to Messenia, with the exception of this one occurrence at Miletos, and of one other on an epitaph at the Milesian colony of Pontic Apollonia.^® Furthermore, Messenian Kresphontes had a son Aipytos (Paus. iv 3.8), and this name was borne by the founder of Priene, son of Milesian Neileus (Strabo 633). Glotz further connected with the inscription two fragments of Nikolaos of Damaskos, FGrHist 90 F 52-3, which tell how the Neileid Amphitres made himself tyrant in place of the legitimate king Leodamas, and how later one Epimenes w'as made Aisymnetes with a mandate to kill the tyrant’s family. But of none of them was he able iyKparrjg yev^aOac ■ — for they had fled — so he confiscated their property and set a price on their heads, ol Se OL fi€v Srj NrjXe tSat Kar€Xvd7]aav cSSe. The general purport of this is strikingly similar to that of our inscription. The reward due to anyone who kills the outlaws is to be paid from the confiscated property of Nympharetos. And, in particular, the phrase lyKpar^s yeveoOai recalls 7]v Se rj 7roAt[s‘ €jyKpar[7])£ yevrirai (line 7). Nikolaos’ account may proceed from confusion and conflation of two events, an early Neileid tyranny at the end of the regal period followed by the family’s expulsion, and a more recent condemnation of the family after some treasonable activity in the middle of the fifth century. If it may be taken that our inscribed decree records the outlawry of the Neileids, then there can no longer be any real possibility that it w^as carried immediately after the failure of the 454 revolt. This emerges from a study of two further inscriptions. There survives a late Hellenistic copy of a set of ^lilesian sacred laws passed in the year 450/49, and giving the names of the current Aisymnetes and Prosetairoi, those in office at the time of the Athenian regulatory decree already mentioned. The dating of the sacred laws depends upon another local inscription, a Hellenistic list of Aisymnetai in annual succession since 525/4 B.c.^- The laws are dated in Philtes’ term as ^\\isymnetes. With him are listed the Prosetairoi, among them Kretheus son of Hermonax representing the tribe Boreis. But Tod, ad loc,\\ Meiggs, op, cit,, 26 f.; ATL iii Glotz further suggested that the upper part of the 256. stele contained an earlier (sixth-century) banishment Op.cit,, 146 — i.e. a joint t>Tanny of N>Tnphare- of the Neileids: but this must have been destroyed tos and Stratonax.

BARRON Pylian Neleus’ mother was the wife of Kretheus^^ — Neleus himself was the son of Poseidon — and any bearer of the name in Miletos must have been one of those who claimed Neileid descent*^*^ It follows that the Neileids had not already been banished in 450/49; that since the Athenians still allowed them to rule, they had opposed the revolt of 454.“^ Further, it is evident that the governing oligarchy of 450/49 was still in power in 445/4, since Thrason son of Antileon, Prosetairos in the former year, served as Aisymnetes in the latter.-^ But 445/4 is the second year of the period during which Miletos is not known to have paid tribute, 446/5 to 444/3, and so possibly the second year of a new revolt.^\" Alost significant is the probability that the Aisymnetes of the previous year, Peisistratos son of Agenor, was a Neileid: Nestor had a son named Peisistratos [Odyss, hi 36, etc.); Agenor was Homeric, but a Trojan [Iliad xi 60).“® There is, therefore, an excellent case for sup- posing that the oligarchic revolt mentioned by pseudo-Xenophon broke out in 446/5, and was the work of the wholly or partially Neileid oligarchy supported by Athens in 450/49. The decree of banishment will have been passed in 443, since jMiletos paid tribute once more in 443/2, by which date therefore the revolt had been put down. We may support our prosopographic conclusion by a constitutional argument. The Athenian regulations of 450/49, in which the Milesian government appears still to be oligarchic, mention also (hnes 67 ff.) hot Trpvraveg hoc MtA£cr|tov. Aristotle tells us that this ancient office was once made the foundation of a tvTanny in Miletos [PoL 1305a). Since an Athenian-style democracy had not yet been introduced, the officials are to be taken as ‘the long established board of Milesian magistrates rather than as the standing committee of a councif.-^ We have already argued that the constitution with Prytaneis bearing Athenian tribe-names, in operation in 380/79, must have been established well before 412 [supra, p. 2).

Neither the word nor any related form occurs anywhere in Greek at a date earlier than that of our inscription. Herodotos uses rd eVt/xo^vta of ‘monthly offerings’ in one chapter only (viii 41.2). Athenaios quotes 3. psephisma of Alkibiades containing the word, recorded on a stele in the Herakleion at Kynosargos (234e). Otherwise its occurrences Odyss. xi 237: the founder of Minyan lolkos, and father of Neleus’ brothers Aison, Pheres, and Amythaon. Kretheus’ tribe of the Boreis may have been especially Neileid: the name Boros is attached to only three legendarv\" figures, of whom one was a descendant of Pylian Neleus and ancestor of the Kodrid family (Hellan., FGrHist 4 F 125; (/. Paus. ii 18.8 — slightly discrepant; and, for a different view, M. B. Sakellariou, La Aligration Grecque en lonie (Athens, 1958) 256 ff., 73 ff.). Of the other Prose- tairoi, Agamedes and his father Aristokrates may have claimed Minyan descent, for the names are Orcho- menian; while Paus. iv 2.5 tells us of the tomb of the Messenian Lykos in Sikyonia (but all three names are common elsewhere). In connexion with the fact that the loyalists in 454 were resident at Teichioussa, it is interesting that an inscription relating to one Philodemos {SGDl 5501; cf, B, Haussoullier, Rev, de Phil, xxi (1897) 38, no. 7), Aisymnetes in 67 6 b.c., describes him as d)i/Lio[v] I Tiyieaaeojv rcarpia; | (fpyjXpa; Jle/.aycovidojv — ‘of the deme Teichioussa, the lineage of the Neileidai, the clan of the Pelagonidai’. (Pelagon was a Pylian leader mentioned in Iliad iv 295.) It seems likely that Teichioussa was the traditional seat of the Neileids, and in the fifth century perhaps still their actual home. 26 SIG^ 57-3~47 with Milet I. iii no. 122. Like Kretheus, he had represented the possibly Neileid tribe of Boreis. 2’ The dating of the revolt does not depend solely on an argument from silence. Miletos was attacked by Samian oligarchs in 441/0, and was surely then democratic. She paid tribute in 443^2 and 442/1. If her failure to pay in 448 7 is to be explained otherwise, as I believe {supra, p. 2 and n. 13), then there is no room for the oligarchic revolt and imposition of democracy except during the years 448 0 to 444 ' 3 * 26 But the Linear B tablets have shown that many names, Trojan in Homer, were in use in Mykenaian Pylos: cf, D. H. F. Gray, JHS Ixxviii (1958) 45 f- 29 Cf. Meiggs, op. cit., 27. 3 “ Respectively lines 5, ii, 10. of GHI i^ 35. For this office elsewhere, cf. Szanto, REs. v.‘ Epimenioi’. MILESIAN POLITICS AND ATHENIAN PROPAGANDA 5 are all later than the fifth century,^^ In the light of this evidence, it may be suggested that the institution of Epimenioi was later than 450/49, but earlier than the final form of the Athenian-style democracy; that a replica of the Athenian constitution was imposed follow- ing the downfall of the Neileids, but that the name of Prytaneis, still in use in 450/49, was too much associated with oligarchy and tyranny to be used, and was replaced by a modern word politically colourless; that finally, however, the old title was restored, either because passions had died down or because an oligarchic title carried a premium once more.^^ We are in a position to summarise the internal politics of Miletos in these years. I have spoken of ‘the revolt of 454’, meaning to imply nothing about the date of its actual beginning. It has been suggested that it in fact broke out six years previously, Miletos refusing to send a contingent for the Egyptian expedition then being mounted.^^ It must be emphasised that there is no positive evidence to prove that the revolt began earlier than the time of collection in the year of the first quota-list, early spring 453. On the other hand, the Aisymnetes of 457/6 was certainly a Neileid, Alkmeon son of Hipparchos.^^ This suggests that the revolt did not begin before 456. It may have begun in that year as a reaction to bad news from Egypt, or its outbreak may belong to one of the two following years. I would suggest that the urgency with which the Delian treasury was transferred to Athens in 454/3 becomes more intelligible if we may suppose that the revolts of Miletos, Erythrai, and perhaps other cities in Ionia, had already begun : the final disaster at Memphis in June 454^^ would not on its own make a Persian raid on Delos likely — particularly if fewer than ninety ships were lost^® — but with Ionian ports ready to receive the King’s fleet an entirely new and perilous situation arose. During the early fifties Miletos was governed by a pro-x\\thenian oligarchy in which the Neileids had some share. Between 456 and 454 the city seceded from the Confederacy, but was compelled to return and resume its tributary status in time for the collection of 452/1. Comparison with Erythrai, for whom regulations seem to have been issued in 453/2 but who paid no tribute in that year, suggests that an Athenian expedition to recover both cities was sent out in early spring 452.^^ At the time of the capitulation the Milesian government — presumably a medising tyrant or tyrants, as at Erythrai,^® for democrats would not have revolted — was replaced by an oligarchy basically composed of Neileids who had remained loyal at Leros and Teichioussa. Further adjustments were made by the regulations of 450/49, when the government was still Neileid, as is shown by the presence of Kretheus among the Prosetairoi. The government was supported by the presence of an Athenian garrison, installed either now or in 452 {ATL ii D ii, line 77). Tribute was paid as usual in spring 446; but during the year the Milesian rulers, headed by the Neileid Peisistratos, noticed that Athens was fully occupied by the trouble in Euboia and Megara, and by the Spartan invasion of Attika, and took the opportunity to massacre the democratic opposition and to secede once more. This revolt was crushed in time for tribute to be paid in spring 442, but as a conciliatory gesture the assessment was halved and henceforth remained at five talents. The Neileids were outlawed, and a new constitution drafted The treatise de Jsfatura Alulierum (the word occurs in sect. 13) is of course pseudo-Hippokrateian and late. Mr Meiggs suggests to me that the title may have been changed after the Samian Revolt, when Athens had completely secured Miletos. ATL iii 253. .Mkmeon was a Pylian Neileid, Paus. ii 18.8.

BARRON after that of Athens herself, save only that the Prytaneis were called Epimenioi to avoid the associations which the former title held for Milesians. The difficulty has always been to see why the Athenians supported an oligarchy at ^liletos in the first place. Pseudo-Xenophon gave us no clue. Now we see the reason. Athens had built her claim to be the leader and mistress of the Eastern Greeks upon the ancient tradition of the Ionian Migration^ of which the central feature was the colonisation of Miletos by Neiieus, son of King Kodros of Athens. The tradition is perhaps reflected by Solon, who calls Athens rrpeG^vrdTrjv . . . yatav 'laovias (Fr. 4.2). According to Hero- dotos (v 97.2)3 x\\ristagoras of Miletos pleaded it as a reason why Athens should send ships to help the Ionian Revolt in 499. This need not be an anachronism, for it was at about that date that Pherekydes wrote of the settlement of Ionia by Kodros’ sons.^^ When the lonians rejected Spartan leadership and urged the Athenians to found the Delian Con- federacy instead, they made their appeal Kara to ^vyyevls (Thuk. i 95.1). A cult of Neiieus was maintained at Athens.\"^ While the Confederacy was still growing under the appear- ance of individual autonomy, it would be politically impossible for the Athenians to dismiss the Milesian Neileids: the continuance of their rule would be a focal point of Athenian propaganda. But when the pretence was abandoned and empire openly avowed after the failure of the Panhellenic Congress called for 449, the Neileids became expendable. Realising this, in 446 they resolved to stake all on a desperate attempt at secession. Bedford College^ University of London, Hdt. ix 97, cf. i 146 f.; see Sakellariou, op. cit., passim. Cf. F.

Of other pre-Herodotean accounts, note that John P. Barron, Panyasis (Suidas, s.v.) wrote of Kodros, Neiieus, and the Ionian ^ligration.

APETH AND BIA IN EURIPIDES’ HERAKLES Despite the discussions of a hundred years, the unity of Euripides’ Herakles remains a problem. Most scholars have distinguished in the play three parts whose hmits are marked by the apparition of Lussa with Iris (814) and by Herakles’ recovery from madness (1088) : but over the relationship of these three parts to each other and to the whole there has been little agreement. It is this relationship which I propose to consider.^ The problem is baldly stated by Miiller^ who contented himself with complaining of the lack of unity involved in the ^combination in one piece of two actions so totally different as the deliverance of the children of Herakles from the persecutions of the blood-thirsty Lykos, and their murder by the hands of their frantic father’. Wilamowitz, followed with elaborations by Verrall, sought to diminish the shock by looking for some continuity between these two events and suggested that the madness developed naturally and gradually, and is already discernible in the earlier utterances and actions of Herakles.^ This view — Herakles the Megalomaniac — finds its way into Murray’s Oxford Text and is accepted apparently by Dodds and certainly by Grube.^ But this shock of inconsequence is essential to the drama, and later scholars — Parmentier, Kitto, Ehrenberg — have quite rightly repudiated the megalomania theory.^ Muller was wrong in the first place to consider the relationship of two parts of a drama without the third. This sort of procedure leads to conclusions like that of Murray who in his discussion begins with part iii, alludes briefly to part ii and not at all to part i: he pronounces the play ^broken-backed’.® Kitto on the other hand looks for ^one unifying idea’. But though he suggests one, he does not satisfactorily solve the difficulties he himself finds in part i (‘Dramatic feebleness like this . . . the scenes are flat . . . dramatising a negative’, etc., 240-2), and of Stasimon ii he concludes that it is ‘neither itself a unity nor has it any connexion with the action or the thought’ (265 cf. 244);^ and it is understandable that Norwood is unconvinced and reverts to the verdict of Murray. ^ The only unhesitating, and I think successful, champion of the play’s unity is J. T. Sheppard, in a paper which seems, strangely, to have been little noticed in subsequent discussions.® Accepting the division into ‘three episodes each excellent’ Sheppard shows ^ This article is developed from a paper read to the Edinburgh Classical Association in January 1959.

He is correct when he goes on to deplore attempts to ‘force unity of action on recalci- trant material’ since unity of action in his sense (unbroken sequence of cause and effect) is no more essential to dramatic unity than strict unity of time. But for that same reason ‘falls into halves’ and ‘ramshackle’ are misguided and misleading ex- pressions. ® J. T. Sheppard, The Formal Beauty of the Hercules Furens CQ_yi (1916) 72. 8 H. H. O.

This is a traditional Greek view and therefore easily discerned by the audience in its successive embodiments throughout the play — in the wealth of the conventional tyrant Lykos; in the friendship of Theseus ; both prepared for by the allusions of Amphitryon to friendship and to wealth by the royal but fallen Megara. The aged weakness of the Chorus is the antithesis of strength, and strength is embodied above all in Herakles for whom it becomes also ‘the source of his calamity’. The relevance of the choral odes is to be found in their handling of these themes, especially that of Herakles’ strength. This is a valuable thesis because it leads us to see that the recurrence of the themes implies in the action of the play a coherent abstract argument — What is the relative validity of human (/>iAta, strength and wealth? What is their relationship to the circumstances of human life — or, as the Greek stage put it, to the Olympian gods ? The existence of such an argument I would make my point of departure; but thereafter I would like to suggest some modifications. Aly bare summary^ does little justice, of course, to Sheppard’s subtlety, but still he is somewhat rigid in his allocation of themes to characters. The unity which he demonstrates is perhaps too mechanically formal. The organic structure of the plot will become more apparent if we consider the interrelationship of these themes as subordinates of a further general concept — aperi ^ : and particularly we must re-examine the relationship between Herakles’ strength and his dperij. In this way I hope to demon- strate more fully the unity inherent in the play’s three parts. It is the first part of the play which has been criticised most adversely. The charges are that it is melodramatic, and that it is flat and largely irrelevant.^® Euripides’ reason for writing this as melodrama I shall consider at the end of my paper. My concern now is with the charge of flatness and irrelevance: and here we need to justify only the first 500 lines, since the 200 lines of part i which follow the entry of Herakles may be melodramatic, but their brisk relevance cannot be doubted. As to the relevance of the opening scenes— and perhaps we should note that the details of their plot form Euripides’ largest single free invention in his handling of the traditional materiah^ so that it would be surprising if they w^ere not relevant — we may be helped by considering first the ode which occurs towards the end of part i — Stasimon ii (637-700) — in which Euripides has himself conveniently provided us with an even more complete distillation of the play’s argument than in the merely gnomic allusion to wealth, strength and friendship in the closing lines of the work.^^ Herakles has just completed his Labours, he has rescued his children and is on the point of killing Lykos. The ode that follows contains a central reflexion on dper?/. It looks back (680 ff.) to the dperr] of Herakles just displayed: it looks forward (655 ff., 669) to the brutal stupidity of the gods with which he is about to be rewarded. Only here in part i could both these reflexions occur. Earlier Herakles had been despaired of: after the death of Lykos the Chorus do not question — they extol the justice of the gods (738 ff.). Here only can they prompt the question which I take to be Euripides’ prime concern in the play as a whole — What is the place of human aperri in the universe ? If the gods approve it, why do they not give a (^avepov yapaKrrjp^ dperdg (659) ? ^Aperij is good and Youth is good — vcdras* (f>LXov atet (637) : both in their way the prime of life. These then should coincide in renewed youth, SlSvpov jjpav, a return from death (657, 661) for those who have dp€TT], So the passing of Time would be on the side of the just, instead of bringing the Xvypov <j> 6 vi 6 v T€ yrjpas (649) which so prominently throughout part i has prevented E.g.

Grube, 253 n. i, 82 ff. is an exception, but only notices the allusions to 11 Wilamowitz, 108-9. youth and age as appropriate to the characters. 12 It has been traditional to regard this ode as APETH AND BIA IN EURIPIDES’ HERAKLES 9 Amphitryon and the Chorus from realising their aperr] in opposition to the wickedness of Lykos. As it is, elXiaaopievos ns alojv ttXovtov /xoVov av^€i (671): Time is on the side of people hke Lykos, of the rvpawlhos oX^os rejected in orp. a (644). Yet just for this precise moment Herakles has returned, one good man back from Hades.^^ But only for this moment. In an instant the harmony will be shattered by Hera’s sending of Madness. We shall be left again to realise that the gods do not possess avvecjis Kal aot^la /car’ dvSpas (655)^^ and to ask the question of dvr. a — What is the place of human dperij in the universe? This question, with its concentration on dper-r] is, I would like to show, a more helpful formulation of the ‘abstract argument’ of the play than one which includes only (/>tAta, strength and wealth. These are indeed themes, but the dper^ question is more than a theme. It is the play: the inexplicable overthrow by Hera of the conventional dpenq of Herakles followed by his recovery of a further dper'^ prompt and (tragically) answer precisely this question. If dper^, then, is the hub of the wheel, and the subordinate topics of the ode — Youth, Age and the passage of Time, Tyranny and Wealth — are the conditions under which dperrj is realised, and at the same time the actual themes of the drama, the spokes which radiate from the hub to every part of the play, we must, in attempting to justify the opening scenes, keep in mind the relationship of these themes to the architectonic question ‘What is dpen^?' In part i dpenj is most obviously embodied in Herakles, as Amphitryon, Megara and the Chorus constantly remind us. His dperrjy pre-eminently displayed in the Labours — yevvaiojv dperaL ttovojv (357) — is the inspiration of their hope and in despair of their forti- tude {cf, 294 ).^^ When he does arrive he exercises dperrj as it was generally understood — rots (f)iXots T elvai <f)LXoVy rd r ixOpd pnaelv (585-6) — by saving his family and killing Lykos. This is generally admitted, but is not by itself enough to occupy 500 lines.^® What positive function of their own have the minor characters ? Part of the answer is Sheppard’s — they embody the themes, Amphitryon Lykos ttXovtos, Megara the instability of riches, the Chorus lack of odivos. To this w-e may add what we have learnt from Stasimon ii. They as well as Herakles embody dperrj: it is they who first present, in their reaction to the threat of death, the Chorus’s question at 655 ff. : what is dperrj ? This they do in a series of three ‘debates’ which the continually increasing threat of death saves from being merely theoretical: the Prologue provides a discussion between Megara and Amphitryon: Episode la (140-251) one between Amphitr>^on and Lykos; ib (278-347) one between Amphitryon and Megara whose conclusions are carried forward into Episode 2a (451- 513). The conditioning circumstances of the debate develop, but the topic is the same throughout. How^ are they to face death? What w^ould be the choice of the dvrjp dpLoros (105)? Amphitryon and Megara propose two very different answers to this question. The difference emerges in the Prologue and is completely developed by the end of Episode la. In Megara’s opinion their doom is inescapable, SoKelv Se rdSoKrjr ov xpv (92). One must, therefore, as she explains later (284-9, 294, 307-8), accept it as nobly as one can. But Amphitryon believes that one should never give up hope, never cease to look for the possibility of helping oneself. And this is said specifically to be virtuous action — ovros S’ dv^p dpiaros dons cAmcrt | rreTTOidev alel ' rd S’ diropelv dvSpds kokov (105-6). These two views of dperrj introduce the contrast that eventually relates the two main parts of the play as a whole, the contrast between the dperp of Herakles the Deliverer, which seeks to mould circum- Cf, also 297 Koi ri; davovrcjov ijXdev '\"Aldov 17-25, 152-61, 175-87, 219-26, 348-435 rroT£; and 735-6 jueyag 6 TtpoaO' dvaS ndhv vo:o(yxpe(fei (Stas, i), 575-82, 610-21, 700 refer to the Labours ^torov ”Aida. alone. 1^ I cannot agree with Wilamowitz’ translation. 1® The objection to Kitto’s explanation (238-44). ameaig Kal oo(pia go together, /car’ dvdpa; with both ‘If the gods had sense and wisdom as men’. 10 H. H. O. CHALK stances to man’s intentions, and the dper?) of the stricken Herakles, which endures whatever happens with acceptance. The debate between Amphitryon and Lykos in Episode \\a appears at first more theoretical than the first discussion. Lykos has arrived: Amphitryon’s ‘hope’ seems even less justifiable — riv aXKijv r elaopdre 0av€Lu‘, as Lykos asks on arrival (144); and he himself not so much concerned to dissuade Lykos from his purpose as to affirm angrily his own view of the nature of good action. For him this means, obviously, a defence of Herakles. In Lykos’ eyes Herakles is already dead in Hades: therefore no true son of Zeus: hence an impostor in his claims to evyevLa; a coward who fights merely with beasts (145-64). For Amphitryon he is the iadXo?, the dvrjp dpiuros (171-87), and he heightens his lustre by contrasting it with the heiXia of Lykos (210, 235) — his ao^ioX^ with the meanness of that ivXd^eia in whose name Lykos had justified child-murder (166); his exploits with Lykos’ nonentity (182-7); his high birth with the other’s upstart intrusion into Thebes (208-12).^® This flat contrast as such primarily serves Euripides’ melodrama, whose intention we are to discuss later. Here our business is with Amphitryon’s concern for the quality of Herakles and the Fatherhood of Zeus in themselves. These are less purely theoretical subjects than might appear, since they form the ground of Amphitryon’s original definition of dperri in terms of hope, \"EXttLs here means the return of Herakles (97) and this depends on his bravery and, more, on his descent from Zeus, which should ensure the god’s good-will. That, however, is Zeus’ affair not his, as Amphitryon begins by saying (170); but as far as lies within his power, if he could really persuade Lykos of Herakles’ worth, he might make Lykos desist from his violent intention. '\"EXttLs is still the basis of Amphitryon’s argument in that scene, but in the third debate, between Amphitryon and Megara (Episode ib, 278-347), the circumstances have changed. Lykos has refused to reasoffi^ and Megara’s noble despair now carries conviction. She specifically rejects Amphitryon’s theory — r^v arjv iXircSa (295) : she calls on his evyeveia (308) — ovK dveKTov SeiXias Oaveiv cr’ vtto (289) : she would not even wish to save her sons Sd^av KaKTjv AajSdvras' (291)- And now that the circumstances have changed Amphitryon (who is a evyevrjs) consents. We also note that, as the renunciation of his doctrine of hope logically demands, he disowns, not the Herakles whose return was the immediate ground for hope, but, significantly, Zeus, whose parentage should have been the guarantee of his return (339-47)* Here is the same disillusionment with the gods as we saw in the second verse of Stasimon ii, and which we are to meet again in part iii — dper^ ae vlko) dvriTos dJv (342) . . . dpadris Tis et 6eos rj St/cato? ovK epvg (347)- This conclusion forms the basis of Amphitryon’s and Megara’s resignation in what remains before the arrival of Herakles, the Funeral Procession (Episode 2a, 451— 514). The speech of Megara is designed simply to concentrate attention on the (silent) children; properly, since their fate at the hands of Lykos or of Herakles is the occasion of the tragedy.^^ But Amphitryon at the end of the scene reverts for the last time to the topic of the ‘debates’, his hope of Zeus’ help {cf. Megara’s appeal 490-5 and the answer 520-1) ; and for the last time, heightening the contrast with Herakles’ arrival, he renounces it — (Lg eAmSas* puh 6 ypovos OVK iTTLorarai | acpl^etv ( 5 ^b— 7 ?

But so, we must now add, does the Chorus, though more obliquely, by evincing a quality common also to Megara and Amphitryon — <f>i\\La. All alike, in contrast to Lykos and Herakles, are what Amphitryon calls aadevelg ^IXoi {cf. 228).^ And for the connexion of this with aperiq we need only refer again to Stasimon ii. There we saw that the Chorus lament not simply for their weakness in age, but that the passage of Time has no regard for the deserts of dperij. This is also the relevance to the main theme of their complaints of feebleness elsewhere: and Amphitryon is like them in this respect.^*^ They know what is right but are powerless. Time has made them sounds without substance (iii— 12, 229), dadevet^ Their ^lAta shorn of adevos is their dper ^ — or all that remains of it. For of all the themes — <f)iXlay wealth and tyranny, Time, strength and aged weakness — is the most intimately related to dperi]; a Greek commonplace expressed in Amphitryon’s rots* (fycXoig r’ elvai <f)iXov (585).^^ The other themes are conditions under which dperiq is realised: but <f)iXLa is more than a condition. The word is almost interchangeable with dperi^. In Stasimon ii, though expressed for Herakles, (fyiXla is not named; but is. And for the same reason in part iii ^tAot, ^tAta are named repeatedly , dperrj hardly at all. But this does not mean that dperrjj embodied in the suffering Herakles, is not the topic of part iii; only that <^tAta is the essential characteristic of this dpeTrj. This relationship of (fyiXla to dperiq which becomes finally explicit in Theseus and Herakles is already emergent, another positive contribution, in part i in the (fyiXla of Megara, Amphitry on and the Chorus, no less than in that of Herakles, which prompts him to exercise his dperrj on their behalf. Conversely it is the lack of (fyiXLa in Zeus which immediately leads Amphitryon to infer the absence of dperrj in the god — au 6’ dp’ 'qaaov ^ ^SoKetg elvai <f)LXos * dperfj oe vikco (341— 2, cf, 346—7). Lykos too lacks dperi^ because he lacks ^lAta: 1425-6 are incidentally a complete verdict on him as well. But this correlation of dperr^ and ^iXla obviously needs to be modified. Though often in practice interchangeable, they are not actually synonymous. For illustration we need look no further than Amphitryon’s statement of conventional Greek thought: rot? ^tAot? t’ eivai (j>LXov is complemented by rd r’ dxOpd fitaecv: and in precisely this conjunction is involved the dilemma on which the whole tragic content of the play depends. In an ideal world €v Spdv might have been the whole sum of dperi]: el Se deot? rjv avveaig /cat oo^La /car’ dvhpas ... no doubt it would. But the gods have ordained that dperiq should also involve /ca/cd>? hpdv. Hence this tragedy. This is to anticipate a point which must be fully examined when it becomes explicit in part iii: but we must anticipate since it is already foreshadowed in part i. At this stage the imperfections of the existing order are represented by the betrayal of Time, which not only fails to reward dperq but even incapacitates it by old age, and rewards evil.-^ Herakles Sheppard is wrong to allow no more to the Chorus than aged weakness (74); just as there is more in Amphitryon than (pula and in Megara than fallen greatness.

The unexpected last wovd—qu'/.wv — goes farther: the only proper cause for loathing is failure of (pdia, Cf the handling of Time and dperq in Stas. ii. This is emphasised ironically in the ‘Triumph Song’ (Stas, iii) where the Chorus suppose that ypovo; is on the side of justice (740, 777, 805), At 506-7 Amphitryon blames ypovo^ because he must re- nounce his ‘hope’ in the triumph of justice: contrast his faith in ypovo; at 87. 12 H. H. O. CHALK can admittedly practise his aperry. But on the other hand Lykos too can act, whereas Amphitryon and the Chorus are too old; the sons of Herakles are too young; Megara is not a man. Yet despite this nonsensical lack of rapport between man’s vision and the gods* dispensation, which the Chorus complains of in Stasimon ii, Megara, Amphitryon and the Chorus nevertheless clearly make the assumption that there is still some course of action open to the weak which, however ineffective, will constitute aper'q: IpioL re fiLpirifi dvSpos ovK aTTcoGreov says Megara (294), It is reminiscent of Aristotle’s statement that for man, woman and slave different criteria of dperi] apply.^® At the time and for those concerned they all display valid though different dperal: and this, again, anticipates part iii, where the dperi] of the stricken Herakles is one of acceptance, not of traditional Herculean achieve- ment, but is none the less valid. Enough has been said to justify part i^^’r se, and the increasing need to refer to part iii in explanation of it suggests that we should now consider the relationship of these two parts from the standpoint of the closing scenes. The subordinate characters of part i have put before us two basic kinds of dperaL — we might call them the dperr] of active achievement, and that of impotent endurance. The Herakles of part i embodies, as traditionally, the first kind: but in part iii his suffering leads him to display the second. In such a summary unity begins to appear. It will be revealed completely by a further question: What is the relationship between these two presentations of Herakles? What single judgment are we to pass on these two dperal relative to each other? On this question it will be convenient to start by considering the opinion of Wilamowitz, since it is in my view erroneous in a basic way not fully corrected in any subsequent dis- cussion. \\Vilamowitz (127-8) holds that the Herakles of part iii exhibits a higher dperi] which repudiates the dperr] of part i. The corollary is that the Herakles of part i was after all only a megalomaniac, and his quality not dperiq at all. As to the megalomania theory I need not repeat its refutation by Kitto (241-3).^® Parmentier (5) and Ehrenberg (159), too, hold that the greatness and goodness of Herakles is ‘the predominant impression we derive’. The onset of madness was, as our first impression suggests, sudden and unmotivated. We may add that it is possible to point to the precise line at which it begins — 867 — with a suddenness confirmed by the Messenger’s narrative at 928-33. But if Herakles was good and great throughout, if the dperr] of part i is truly dperi], in what sense can we speak of its rejection in part iii? Wilamowitz’ suggestion of megalomania saves him from this inconsistency: but it is illogical in Parmentier (8) to reject megalomania, yet follow Wilamowitz’ view that the active dperr] is repudiated by that of part iii. If, as I agree we must, we rehabilitate the Herakles of part i, we must reassess Wilamowitz’ judgment of the relationship intended by Euripides between the earlier and the later forms of dperr]. The view I wish to substitute is, briefly, that the dperi] of part iii certainly includes more than that of part i, but does not annul it. They differ because the circumstances which evoke them differ: but the ‘old’ is retained. And the necessity of retaining it arises from the tragic view of life expressed in the play. According to Wilamowitz the ‘new’ dperi] consists essentially in the renunciation of jSta. Bla is ‘hateful to god’^\" and Euripides is offering a reformed conception of dperr] intended to sweep away the traditional Epic ideal of Dorian manliness. The reformed Herakles of part iii having renounced ^la is inter- preted as wholly passive. To answer this it is necessary for us to deny (a) the passivity of the ‘new’ Herakles and {b) its alleged cause, the renunciation of jSta. 2^ Ar. Pol. i26oa2o; Po. 1454321.

But Theseus gently rallies him: to Theseus this is still mere unmanliness (1407, 1410, 1412). He does not fully understand the new dper'^ to which his arguments have helped his friend. Herakles who has experi- enced understands (1411): and to convince Theseus he has to contrast his own condition now with that of Theseus when he was in Hades — he still possesses Xrjpa despite his circum- stances ( 1 41 5-1 7). The passage serves also, of course, to underline finally for the audience what might be less familiar in the new conception of dperi ] : but in my present context the important point is that it is Herakles who underlines it for Theseus, not vice versa. A particular passage is adduced by Wilamowitz (109) in support of his view. At 1^86-8 Herakles requests Theseus’ help in taking Kerberos back to Argos. To Wilamowitz this is evidence that ‘Herakles feels no match for the vanquished Kerberos’ and ‘will under- take no more exploits’. This is more than the Greek says. Herakles asks Theseus to join him in the task {avyKape, GvyKardaTrjGov, not ‘do it without me’) because in his sorrow he cannot bear to be alone: this, that he requires friendship (perhaps — though this is not For their g)ikla see note 23. Amphitryon’s function in part iii is to support Theseus’ role by his paternal (pt?,ta (1111-13, 1206, 1220, 1409). Here he also implies a judgment on Zeus whose fatherhood Herakles accordingly rejects (1265). Note the contrast of Amphitryon’s feelings with Zeus’ implied in 1065-8 as against 1086-7. Amphitryon also introduces the idea of ptaapa by his fear not of death but that Herakles may kill his own father (1072-6, cf, 1056). 1294-8 describe nature’s rejection of the polluted killer (piaapa); 1281-90 its counterpart, SvoK^Eia, the social ostracism which followed from belief in piaapa.

Wilamowitz’ correction fiorov makes perfect sense: LP Odvarov makes none but is an understandable error if a scribe had not compre- hended the nature of Herakles’ resolve. 32 I interpret these difficult lines as follows: 1406-12 Herakles wishes to demonstrate his love to Amphitryon and his dead family. Theseus thinks this cowardice. Herakles (1411) shows it not to be. Theseus (1412) still misunderstands. 1413 (H.) Ts my living a low act? You didn’t think so just now.’ 1414 (Th.) ‘You are brought all too low’ (he thinks only of ra^reivo;: = elpt) ‘you are not that noble Herakles you were’ (Wilamowitz’ reading is better Greek, but MSS. would mean the same). 1415-17 (H.) ‘Yet I still do possess /S]pa (i.e. my misfortunes have not deprived me of dprT^).

(i) Another passage mentioned by Wilamowatz (129) brings us to our next problem, the alleged renunciation of pla. At 1235 he understands Herakles’ • eu Spdaas Se a’ ovK dvalvopai to mean that his rescue of Theseus from Hades is the only one of his former deeds which Herakles does not now disown as tainted with jSta. In some contexts it could have meant this: but it need not. In this context Euripides is concerned from (1214) Theseus’ first words to 1238 to build up the important theme of ^tAta. The intro- duction of so significant a new idea as AVilamowitz sees here would hardly have been slipped in en passant^ isolated from its context and stated only obliquely by implication. Euripides was a practical dramatist. The line simply means T agree: (whatever else I deny in your argument) we friends\\ But we can go beyond this negative argument to disprove the renunciation of ^ta, for Herakles immediately before the Kerberos passage expressly says that he does not renounce his former deeds. At 1377—85 he addresses the symbol of his dperr] (in this play as traditionally), his bow and arrows.^^ With them he killed his wife and children. Can he bear to carry them still? Yet with themrd /cdtAAtcrr’ efeVpa^’ eV ‘E/AAdSt, and with them he will defend himself in future against his enemies (1382-4). He resolves to keep them — but ddXLo)? (1385). This means that w^e must cease to speak of an ‘old’ dperiq and a ‘new’ dperr) as separate states. The ‘old’ dp^Trj is an ingredient of the ‘new’. But the ‘new’ also includes understanding, induced by suffering, of the hateful implications of action. Herakles’ decision here is crucial to the tragedy as such. The mere rejection of the admittedly distasteful implications of action may be pathetic in a broken man; or edifying; but it is not tragic. Nor would the practical possibility of such a rejection have been imaginable for a Greek — even Euripides.^® In taking back his bow Herakles recognises that not all circumstances^' are to be met by tears and acquiescence and this is tragic precisely because it does not mean that therefore jSta is not hateful. On the contrary, ^ta through him destroyed his wife and sons. Wilamowitz’ picret ydp c 5 Oeog rrjv ptav is from another play {HeL 903) .

This view of the relationship of the two dperat makes a unity of parts i and iii. We must now briefly discuss the relevance of part ii in its light. The intervention of Hera through Iris and Lussa actively demonstrates our last conclusion. Far from hating jSta, ia) The bow is used throughout the play with Reiske at 1279; cf. Xoiadiov at 23).

But it is continuous series 'ruv /.oioBiov novov . . . naif)oKrov)]aa;^ rejection of ftta only in these circumstances. APETH AND BIA IN EURIPIDES’ HERAKLES 15 the Olympians too belong to the same world as the violent Lykos. El Se deots rjv avpeais^ Kal ao<f>la Kar avhpas . . . vvv Se Hera is the murderess of Alegara and the children. She embodies ^la and when Herakles while hating her acknowledges her {\"'Hpa KpareX^^) he is acknowledging that /Sta is part of our divinely decreed state just as he was in taking back his bow. The shock of this revelation at part ii is heightened by the Chorus’s misguided celebration of Olympian Slkt] in the triumphant Stasimon iii immediately before it (734-814, note especially the juxtaposition of 814-15). But it is man only who envisages the higher ideal. This play offers no divine support for it.^^ It is a tragedy because while affirming the validity of man’s vision it insists that this is thwarted by divine decree. In view of other interpretations of part ii it is necessary to insist on two points in detail. First, the amorality of the gods must not be palliated. When we see Lykos struck down we may be tempted, like the Chorus, to suppose Oeol deol tcov dSiKOJv pbeXovat Kal tojv ogIojv iTTaleLv (772): but when they promptly strike down the best of men, fresh from this act of justice and in the moment of sacrificing to themselves, we see we were wrong. But we must not complain of the lack of motivation. That is Euripides’ point. The Olympians are without rational motives, completely unaware of the demands of human reason. Justice is a human vision. ^Aperf] ere vlkco dvriros dov deov /xeyav Amphitryon had rightly said of Zeus (342): dpiadris ns ec 0e6s rj SiKaios ovk €(f)vs (347)-^® Similarly only man displays AtKaia roijs reKovras (hcjyeXeiv reKva the Chorus tells Herakles (583). He tried to and so did Amphitr^^on (e.g. 317): Zeus did nothing, and Amphitryon is the father whom Herakles acknowledges (1265). Olympian gods lack all human qualities.^ Secondly, Herakles — who does possess human dperri, SiKaioavirq^ ^iXla — is wholly good throughout. If we look for dfiaprlai, signs of v^pis or megalomania, we shall dilute the responsibility of Hera and so blur the point of the play. The relevance of Hera’s inter- vention is that it is entirely hers and entirely inappropriate (831, 846). The greatness of Herakles provides the occasion of her attack; but it is not even the motive, far less the cause, and there is no v^pig. She, not it, is the sole ^source of his calami ty’.^^ Of course a play could have been written putting the view that ‘a man’s faults lie in himself’. But here Euripides’ aim was to externalise the / 3 ta in which Herakles was involved, and so draw the distinction between human values and their irrational circumstances; to say rather ‘there are irrational elements in life’. This is represented notably in his handling of the madness. This madness is not (as Wilamowitz and Verrall supposed) a personal failing, perceptibly developing. Lussa is the pawn of Hera completely; and though she must obey she is unwilling (858-61) thus completely dissociating herself from Herakles. It is repugnant 38 1253, Cf- 1303-7? 1311-12, 1393 ('vhere the ambiguity of \"'Hpa; recalls 20-1 eW \"Hpa^ ehe rov ypecov; cf, 1357 Tvyji dovAEvreov) , Tvyi] and ypicov also at 307-1 1, 509, 1314-15, 1396. 3 ® Herakles’ so-called Platonic speech (1341-6) is no exception. As Kitto shows (246) Herakles is subsequently ‘a very imperfect Platonist’. But even within the speech four of the six lines are only a statement of what we have already learnt, that gods are not human: if they have not human virtues nor have they human vices. The remaining couplet is not as \\^errall and Greenwood see it, the corner- stone of the play. It is merely an allusion to con- temporary speculation, insufficient to cancel opti- mistically the tragic resignation of the play as a whole. Cf. 212 el Zei)^ diKaia; elyev eiq (ppeva;. The same is implied in Stas, iii: the Chorus, mis- takenly attributing diKY} to Zeus, associates with it his Fatherhood (800-5). For the typically Euripi- dean dpadrjq, of Zeus, at 347, cf. Amphitryon’s ironical Beoq . . . ei pddoi (1115). At 172 Lykos is dpaOy)q. Alagn. Mor. 1208630 suggests itself — dronov el Tiq (fall] (pi/.eiv rov Aia. The position is nicely illustrated in a quotation kindly sent me by Professor Kitto: \"The sea does not assume its royal blue to please you. Its brute and dark desolation is not raised to overwhelm you; you disappear because you happen to be there.’ (H. M. Tomlinson, The Sea and the Jungle.) ^3 Megalomania has been discussed. ^Yppiq is misleadingly suggested in phrases like ‘sin of great- ness’ (Grube, 256) ; ‘More than Nature can long endure’ (Kitto, 247); even Ehrenberg’s (160) ‘No fault, no crime, his greatness alone is the reason for Hera’s emy and hatred’, suggests (pQovoq, discussed below. i6 H, H.

The ,8ca whose extreme form this madness represents is thus distinguished from the properly human as an external circumstance.^^ A v^pL 9 or at least a (f>d 6 vos interpretation of part ii might be suggested by Iris’ words at 841—2 — Herakles must suffer ^ Oeol pcev ov 6 ap.ov ra Ovrjra S’ earat peyaXa p.rj Sovro^ 8 tKr]i\\ But even ^ 66 vos, certainly ujSpt?, suppose a system where occurrences however unjust are predictable; whereas Euripides’ Olympians are completely chaotic; and the suggestion must be resisted. This is one of many paradoxes which arise as soon as gods are conceived in human form. Euripides was well aware of these and exploited them fully but the gods are really utterly irrational. If, however, we do give them human form, we can only express this irrationality by crediting them with motives so low as to be virtually sub- human. So here the repugnantly primitive (pdovog-sensG of the word Slkt], the most exalted Iris can attain to, contrasts with the lofty conception repeatedly voiced in the immediately preceding ode (737, 740-1, 755-6, 772-80, 813-14). The explanation is the same when Theseus at 1244 warns Herakles pbrj peya Xiycov Tradrjs, and the Other describes his persecution by Hera (1263 ff): both are assuming anthropomorphic gods and speak accordingly. But Stasimon ii, Herakles’ and Amphitryon’s rejections of Zeus, the ‘Platonic’ speech (see note 39), above all the manner of Hera’s intervention, make it plain that the Olympians really possess no human motives at all. They stand for a cosmic irrationality which recalcitrantly thwarts human aperi^ even at its Herculean best. But this insistence on the goodness of Herakles brings before us now one final problem. How in part i is it possible to represent this undiluted aperrj yet represent as well the ^la which we now see to be its inevitable concomitant in action? To represent the aperr] of a suffering Herakles after the disaster consistently with a hatred of j8ta was by comparison straightforward. But how to represent his heroic action as inevitably tainted by the imperfection of things, yet make clear that nevertheless the man is still apiarog ? Vice versa, how to show that kokcLs Spdv is indeed a part of aperT] yet is still kokov? For Euripides this was a practical stage problem, and his solution was to begin by establishing with unshakeable certainty that Herakles is all good, and only then to complicate the picture by showing how jSta nevertheless enters into good action.^^ That is, he began by writing a melodrama: so that our discussion here becomes the defence which I proposed to offer against the criticism that part i is melodramatic. Part i is black and white: jSta too is represented undiluted in Lykos, as aperyj in Herakles. But the details of the two characters are drawn with such close parallelism that in retrospect Herakles, though by now we know him to be good, is seen nevertheless to be affected by the very jSta which possessed Lykos. The point at which one is brought to see this is under the impact of the outrageous irruption of madness and the killing of the children. The essential difference between Lykos and Herakles — their motives for action — the killing of the children does not cancel; but it does reveal what actions good and bad alike have in common — ^violence. Throughout part i, therefore, Lykos and Herakles alone are capable of action, and their actions are point for point alike. Lykos ‘removed’ his political rival Kreon; Herakles ‘murdered’ Lykos. Lykos proposed to ‘take precautions’ (euAa^eta) against Kreon’s Grube (255-6) notes the externality of the madness, but combining it (surely illogically?) with a theory of v(^pi:: and megalomania turns it into a criticism of the man not of the gods. Euripides accepted the myth as a convenient vehicle. It is not his aim (as Wilamowitz argues, 134) to rationalise and reject it, making Herakles ‘bring his sins down on his own head’. His success in doing this enables him to repre- sent imeiKt)^ dvrjp perapaA/.ow svTvyla; ei:; dvarvyiav and yet evoke ‘pity and fear’ not ‘disgust’ (Ar. I452b35). Perhaps the allusions to the past violence of Amphitryon’s career (16, 60, 1077, 1258) support this theme. APETH AND BIA IN EURIPIDES’ HERAKLES 17 family, Herakles to ‘butcher’ Lykos’ partisans. We may interchange the verbs according to our sympathies but all are deeds of violence. Linguistically this is expressed by Lykos’ absurdly extravagant arrangements for disposing of his victims (240-51) and Herakles’ almost mock-heroic threats of vengeance on the traitors (565-73). Wilamowitz and \\errall were right in detecting a note of over-emphasis in Herakles’ speech too; only its purpose is not as they thought to show Herakles already half-mad in the ordinary sense, but to suggest by its similarity to Lykos’ bombast that violence forces its way into all action. Again, Lykos suffers, as Amphitryon warned him — pia Se Spaar^g pirjS^v 7) TT€larj plav (215)1 and so does Herakles suffer Hera’s — not mortally, though that too would have ensued if human friendship had not had the power in this one case to overcome pia. Both are human and suffer; and in the mood of compassion evoked by the disaster we may see that the killing even of a villain is pitiable : rd t pnaelv is no less terrible for being necessary. But above all Herakles achieves what Lykos would have liked to do: he kills Megara and the children. And more. Lykos at least never intended to shed blood at the altar (240, 319* contrast Herakles at 922, 995, 1145)- Of course Herakles was possessed by Hera. But now Euripides introduces a new disturbing element. Herakles thought they were Euiy^stheus’ children whom he was killing (970). Suppose they had been; and Herakles responsible for his actions? Certainly Amphitryon, though he protested against Lykos (206-7) appears to accept that child-killing is practical politics (39-40, 207-9) jnst as Lykos argued (165—9). ^Vith Herakles himself Euripides is careful not to compromise our impres- sion of his goodness by saying definitely that he would kill children when sane; but he hints through the minor characters and through the veil of madness disturbingly enough to evoke an aw^areness that all ^la partakes of the irrational element here embodied in the extreme form of madness. To this extent Amphitryon’s suggestion is right — ov tl ttov (jyovos <J ipdKX€vaev veKpwv \\ ov$ dprc /catVet?; (966—7).^® Wilamowitz’ picture (128) of a megalomaniac brutalised by bloodshed is a caricature: but though Herakles is noble, bloodshed is brutal, the consequence of Cosmic Madness. This is underlined by Euripides’ use of the theme of children’s innocence as the ideal type of human relationships. In their world wLat spoils the relationships of adult man and man has by rights no place: ov yap Sopos- ye 7ra tSe? laravraL neXas ( 1 1 76) . Themselves innocent, their proper due from adults is unqualified — ndv Se <I>iX6t€kvov yevos (636). This reflexion by Herakles, sig- nificantly his last words before the disaster, is unnecessarily drawn out unless it carries such an ulterior implication. Children evoke man’s properly human feelings regardless of wealth and ‘worldly’ distinctions (633-6). Here already is the opposition between human values and ypT^para, Youth and Time that immediately follows in Stasimon ii — d i/edras* piot (j>L"
