        "text": "Students of Greek warfare can scarcely avoid becoming saturated with the agonistic model of hoplite battle. In various manifestations it has dominated scholarship for over seventy years, and through all that time it has provoked very little criticism before some recent work of Peter Krentz, which has provided much of the groundwork for the present study. 2 Our purpose here will be to undertake a more thorough survey of the long history of scholarship on the matter; this should reveal some of the intellectual background from which the idea arose, as well as the ancient evidence which has most\n\nIt was Aristophanes who opened the debate on the reliability of Herodotos, with his spoof in Ach. 526–529 (so far as we can now know). Thucydides entered that arena apparently intending to transform, or possibly transcend, the debate, seeking to position his narrative as more trustworthy than the tales of his fabulous predecessor (1.22.4). Xenophon's sequel shows both how well and how little Thucydides succeeded: Thucydides' own text and subsequent historiography (down to our own era) reveal how neutrality, reliability, and rationality have become indeed the criteria, and the terms, of historiographical debate. I will attempt to open a new perspective by discussing passages involving speculations about the earth and sky, as well as accounts given in figures, though numerous other issues could be covered, and medicine in particular must be reserved for another time because of its great complexity and bulk. My argument is that although Thucydides employs a rhetoric of reliability, his treatment of numbers and phenomena can be shown to be often irrational. whereas Herodotos analyses his data and criticizes contemporary natural-philosophic debates. The contrast of their social origins, the one a general from a wealthy family of an ethnically-exclusivist town, the other a widely-traveled Odysseus from the polyglot city Halikarnassos and the Italian colony Thurii, may not be irrelevant.\n\nInfluential and widespread approaches to archaic and classical Greek warfare maintain that pitched battles were simple and straightforward clashes of heavy infantry, fought according to a set of highly ritualized protocols that ultimately entailed the rejection of any kind of tactical refinement. This denial of tactics is supposed to be the result of the agricultural and agonistic nature of Greek warfare. Literary evidence, however, shows that Greek commanders had a constant concern about tactical issues and multiple tactical choices at hand. What will be suggested here is a revision of the concept of ‘tactics’ applied to archaic and classical Greece. The idea of ‘cultural tactics’, the set of pragmatic decisions taken on the battlefield according to the ideological and cultural framework of the polis, will be put forward. This concept entails that all tactical decisions were guided by the cultural principle of favoring and protecting the citizen body."
