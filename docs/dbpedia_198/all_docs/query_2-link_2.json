They destroyed the crops outside and began negotiating with pro-Athenian factions in Chalcidice, but the anti-Athenian factions asked for help from Olynthus. An army from Chalcidice, Spartolos, and Olynthus met the Athenians in battle, but their hoplites were defeated and they retreated to Spartolus; their cavalry, however, was victorious against the Athenian troops. Reinforcements soon arrived from Olynthus, and they launched a second attack on the Athenians. The Athenians panicked and were routed, with all of their generals and 430 other men killed.\n\nIn the Athenian tribute list of 429/8 BC the only cities of Chalcidice are: Mende, Aphytis, Scione, Stageira and Acanthus (Athos).[1] Acanthus and Mende had not even joined the Chalkidian League.\n\nReferences[]"
