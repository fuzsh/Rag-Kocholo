BEBRERREBRE SE PREFACE The second and third volumes of The Athenian Tribute Lists were prepared concurrently during the year 1947-1948, when the authors were able to be together once again at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. The first two volumes are, it is obvious, directed primarily towards the specialist ; this third volume, we hope, will have a wider appeal. Our chief purpose has been to present a history of the Athenian Empire in narra- tive form, and to accomplish this we have deliberately divided the book into three parts. Thus we have endeavoured to remove, to an extent, the discussion of special and technical problems from the narrative section. In Part I we have placed the additional commentary on the tribute and assessment lists, and it is here, for the most part, that we explain the changes which we have made in the texts of Volume I and printed in Volume II. Part II embraces those problems which arise from evidence outside the tribute records, and which, it seemed, might interrupt the story in Part III. A strict division is of course impossible, and Part III will be found to contain its share of argument. In the composition of Part III we have tried to keep in mind the needs of readers who have little or no Greek; it is our hope that the book will not be restricted to classical scholars and students, but will prove informative to laymen as well. We have therefore, in Part III, resorted freely to translations and have relegated passages of Greek to parentheses and footnotes. Our guiding principle has been that a knowledge of Greek should not be a prerequisite for an intelligent reading of at least the first nine chapters of Part III. Although we cannot claim that the reading is always easy, we are confident that one who wishes to do so will have no real difficulty in under- standing what we have to say. The Athenian Empire has been a fertile field to historians and others, and the literary yield is indeed rich. In acknowledging our debts to our predecessors we have not attempted to be exhaustive; in general, we cite the latest and the fundamental discussions of a given problem. The more complete bibliography, however, is reserved for Volume IV, where it will accompany the detailed index to the first three volumes. This work is already in progress and its publication, we trust, will not be long delayed. Yet there is one book which merits particular mention here. A. W. Gomme’s Commentary on Thucydides, Volume I, has been before us continuously and we could scarcely acknowledge in footnotes the great contribution which it has made to the study of fifth-century history. Even when we disagree with his conclusions, Gomme L1s set out the evidence and stated the problem so clearly that our own path has been made relatively firm. 1x x PREFACE It is pleasant to have another opportunity of expressing our gratitude to those benefactors who, by material and intellectual aid, contributed to the writing of Volumes II and III. Meritt recalls his debt to the Master and Fellows of Balliol, to the Electors of the George Eastman Professorship, and to the President and Board of Directors of the Association of American Rhodes Scholars who administer the Eastman Fund. Wade-Gery extends his thanks to the Visitatorial Board of Oxford University, to the Warden and Fellows of New College, and to the Institute for Advanced Study. McGregor acknowledges his indebtedness to the University of Cincinnati, to the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, to Professor and Mrs. William T. Semple, to the Charles Phelps Taft Memorial Fund, and to Mrs. John L. Caskey and Cedric G. Boulter. That we have been able to complete the writing within a comparatively brief period of time is a tribute to the skill and loyalty of Mrs. Wesley Dauncey and Miss Virginia Spurrier, who prepared the difficult manuscript, Greek and English, for the printer. The J. H. Furst Company of Baltimore has again given its constantly expert attention to the presswork of the volume. As we said in the Preface of Volume II, it is always a privilege to submit a manuscript to them, and we are especially grateful to Mr. Fred Furst, their skilled compositor. In reading the proofs and verifying the references we have been greatly aided by Ruth Allen, of the University of Cincinnati, Donald W. Bradeen, of Washington and Jefferson College, and Daphne Hereward, of the Institute for Advanced Study. The publication has been sponsored by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and has been under the general supervision of Paul Clement, Managing Editor of its Publications. To him and to the School we remain under a deep sense of obligation. BENJAMIN D. MERITT H. T. Wape-GEry Matcotm F, McGrecor Institute for Advanced Study Princeton, New Jersey October 1, 1948 15. 16. ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA On I viii read F. N. Pryce instead of H. N. Pryce. On I xxxii read Ianell instead of Iannell as the editor of Vergil. On I 34 read Fig. 42 for the photograph of No. 64. On I 187 the reference to Cl. Phil. in the bibliography of List 20 should be XXI (1926). On I 483, Col. II, read @erradds instead of @érrados. On I 523, Col. I, s. v. Mupwator wapa Kivpnv read Smyrna instead of Sardis. On I 529, Col. II, s. v. OddvOor read \"Evernpis instead of ’Emrnpis. On I 548, Col. I, read Mytilene and Mytilenaean instead of Mitylene and Mitylenaean. On II 29 (25 III 64) read dad instead of azo. On II 40 (AQ, line 9) read és instead of és. . On II 42 (AQ II 115) read [’O]pam[éra:] and identify with the Ouranion in the Karic Chersonese; cf. II 87. On II 83, Col. Il, read Xe[ppoveotra:] instead of Xe[ppovnotrac]. . On II 8&6, s. v. Kododavor, add a reference to Leicester B. Holland, “ Colophon,” Hesperia, XIII (1944), pp. 91-171. . On II 87, Col. II, add the lemma Srvpis with a note that William Wallace has shown good reason not to emend the names Alyi\\ea of Herodotos, VI, 101, and Aiyhein of Herodotos, VI, 107. Cf. Hesperia, XVI (1947), pp. 130-133. On II 88 the second testimonium under Aischines should be T3 and the first line should read as follows: T3 (II, 175): mddw 8é eis médenov Sia Meyapéas meobévres KaTaoTHVal, Kai THY xopay TunORVaL, On II 103 add to T76 line 3 of J.G., I’, 97: [r]6v émmopév, and date the inscription in 430/29 or earlier. The text has nothing to do with Melos, but is concerned solely with Athenian tribute and with the organization of an expedition to make the collection of it effective. The selection of soldiers é« rév é\\exé6rov for this expedition recalls Aristotle, ’A@. Ilod., 24, 3: dddax Se vijes ai rods ddpous Gyovoa rovs did rod kudpov Surxidiovs dvSpas. It is tempting to associate these texts, if the reading ¢épovs in the papyrus can be retained. In that case we should include Aristotle, ’A@. IIoA., 24, 3, among our testimonia. xi xii 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA On I 549, s.v. SxaBdator, we equated tributary Skabla with the Skabala of Theopompos. In a dissertation entitled A History of Chalkis to 338 B.C., pre- sented to the faculty of the University of Cincinnati in 1947, D. W. Bradeen has argued that Skabla was a Chalkidian colony and that Skabala was an Eretrian dependency in Euboia, not to be identified with the tributary =xaBdatou. On II 56 (line 45) read [8€]xa instead of [8€]xa. On II 58 (lines 6-7) read [aiovpvére] instead of [aiovpvéror]. On II 60 (line 86) read émr[ed€]rar instead of émr[éde] rau. On II 65 (V, line 3) read [dvaypdavras] instead of [avaypawpavres]. Adolf Wilhelm has proposed different restorations in D2 and D19 in J.H.S., LXVIII (1948), pp. 124-129. On II 67 (D14, § 4) read dr[tias] instead of [dripias]. On I 580 and II 103 (T77) we now question whether lines 47-49 and 54-55 of I.G., 1°, 108 have anything to do with the awapyy from the tribute. This has been the traditional opinion (cf. also I 525-526), but the evidence must be discussed at length elsewhere. All the restorations in the latter part of this inscription have been made with too long a line. TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS This table is supplementary to the Table of Abbreviations printed in A. T.

L., II the texts of Lists 1-4 exhibit several minor changes from the form in which they appeared in A. T. L., I. The initial epsilon in 1, II, 8 cannot reasonably be taken as part of any name not already in List 1, and [@eppator] é[v Ixdpor: ] becomes, consequently, an almost certain candidate for the restoration of 1, II, 7-8. This reading has been added to the text. The quota of \"Apyidvux in 1, IV, 22 is transcribed as <H>P. This appears on the stone as XP\"; it is not a normal figure even when considered alone, nor does it fit well into the whole record of the tribute of Argilos. This city paid 1 talent a year, where the amount is preserved, beginning with List 9 in 446/5 and continuing down to the founding of Amphipolis in 437/6. After 437 the normal tribute was lowered to 1,000 drachmai a year, and the explanation for this reduction has been generally, and rightly, sought in the effect which the establishment of the new colony had upon the resources of its older neighbour. But there is no similar explanation at hand for the reduction from 10% talents to 1 talent of tribute between 454/3 and 446/5. Our own earlier suggestion (A. T. L., I, p. 453) that the figure XP should be rationalized to a normal X with an appended temporary increment of FP, perhaps representing a kind of émdopa, is inadequate. Even a tribute of 10 talents would be too high, especially in view of the provision of the Peace of Nikias (Thucydides, V, 18, 5 [T134] ) that Argilos should be autonomous, paying to Athens only rov ddpov rov én’ ’Apurreisov. Gomme apparently thought that the reading should be X<I*>;* but this leaves the Thucydidean text, and the great reduction between 454/3 and 446/5, even more difficult to explain. Perdrizet put forward the suggestion that the reading should be HF\"; he wished to change the first of the two figures rather than the second, and in so doing he obtained not only a normal figure, but one which allows an intelligible interpretation of Thucydides and an acceptable reduction in the amount of the tribute either in 450 or in 446. There are several examples of the same ratio in tribute-reduction in 450 and in 446, and in spite of the further great reduction after the founding of Amphipolis in 437 it is possible that adjustments of territory between Amphipolis and Argilos were contemplated in 421 which would have justified thereafter the payment of the original tribute of 1% talents a year. If the assessment of Argilos in 425 was very severe (it is not known * Commentary, I, p. 277 (unless his reference to the 15 talents is merely an error). 5 6 ATHENIAN TRIBUTE LISTS how high it was), the payment later of 1% talents may have been considered a fair return to a pre-war normal figure.” We believe that the figure XP is in error and that our text should read <H>P. The combined quota of Olynthos, Skabala, and Assera in 1, V, 8 is now restored as H[HPAP HII] rather than H{[HHAM]FHIIIl. When the first separate records appear, Olynthos has a quota of HH, Skabala of FP, and Assera of AAAA. The total of the three figures is less than the old restoration by 26%: drachmai and greater than the new by 23%. Admittedly there is not much to choose between them, but we believe that the less than full composite payment is slightly to be favoured. In 1, V, 16 the restoration is Iixpes Svav[yededs: F]. The tribute of Syangela was usually 1 talent when it included that of Amynanda (see the Register. s.v. XvayyeAjs), but the appearance of *Auvvavdé[s] in List 2 with its own separate quota shows that the two cities divided the payment between them in the first period. Hence the quota for Syangela in 1, V, 16 should be only half the later normal figure of H. The Postscript of List 1, which was cut on the right lateral face of the stone, gives the totals for the year in silver and in gold. The figure for the staters of Kyzikene gold was largely restored in 4.T.L., I (p. 129): [oraréples Ku[{ixevoi: hexoéxovr]a héx[s: héxras rérrapes]. But it might have been as little as 56 or as much as 96, and there is no assurance about the hektai. So we prefer to read the text of these lines as they now appear in A.7.L., II, simply as [oraréples Ku[{ixevoi: ....€xovrja héx[s ------ ]. The amount of silver was given as [F'X]XXHHHAA[....- yee ]. This calculation was based rather largely on an analogy with List 7,° but our study of the first assessment period, and of List 1 in particular,* has shown that this amount is too low. One higher restoration is possible for the quota of silver: [F\"'T]XXHHHAA|---—]. This represents a tribute of 383+ talents, which the increment of the gold (whatever the restoration) will raise to about 400 talents or more, and this higher figure must surely be restored in line 9 of the Postscript. Only one change has been made in List 2 from the text as printed in A. T. L., 1: the restoration ’A[puoBato:] replaces \"A[AwSés] in 2, IV, 15. Arisbe was very near Abydos and dropped out of the tribute lists in Periods V and VI when the tribute of Abydos was raised from 4 to 6 talents. We believe that it should be restored in List 2 when the tribute of Abydos was still probably assessed at 4 talents. The only recorded appearance of Alinda will now be that in 4, V, 21: HA ——’AA[wéés]. It appears there with other Karic names which probably paid only sporadically, or when coerced. If it appeared at all in List 2 it should be sought with its neighbouring Karic 2 Perdrizet wished not merely to emend the text, but to change the reading (B.C.

The reading of the text in 3, I, 30 has now been deciphered as [kat A]vxcor. This line implies, of course, a preceding name, for which the evidence of 9, III, 33-34 strongly suggests TeAeyvéoovnr. But this name can also be spelled TeApéoows and as such it falls admirably into the Karic-Lykian group at the end of List 4, where we now restore [TeApéo]ovor,* and where the concluding line of the list may be restored, on the analogy of List 3, as [kai Av«wo]. These two entries, in 3, I, 29-30 and in 4, V, 32-33, give mutual confirmation to the restorations proposed. The style of the lists suggests that the single quota should be spaced in bracket position before lines 29-30 in List 3 and entirely in line 32 of List 4. In these early lists of Period I the order in which the names appear on the stone reflects largely the time sequence in which the various amounts of tribute were received, and at the end of List 4 it is thus possible to date the payments to the latter part of the year 451/0 and to bring them into connection with Kimon’s campaign to Kypros in the summer of 450. His naval squadron collected tribute from remote or inland cities in Karia and Lykia, many of which do not normally appear in the quota lists.*° The only comparable group of unusual names is at the beginning of List 2,\" where the Karic entries again give evidence of the presence of an Athenian fleet engaged, though perhaps not primarily so engaged, in tribute collection. These names in the first column of List 2 all have odd amounts of quota before them. The figure AMFFI obviously represents an assessment of 1000 drachmai, for which the normal quota was AMPIIII. Similarly, the unusual figure of RAMEFEIIIII for \"Epwés probably repre- sents a normal RAMHIIII, the odd FIllll for ’Awvvavdé[s] a normal FP, and the odd HAFFFFIIII! for Waxrves “ISvp[eds] possibly a normal H. In every instance the fleet had collected a normal tribute plus an increment, the logical explanation being that the additional amount was a tax for late payment, or possibly a charge for the trouble of collection. But these Karic cities, being late in payment of their tribute and proba- bly visited by an Athenian squadron returning to Athens from the east toward the close of summer, could only have appeared in the first column of List 2 if in fact their payments had been due in List 1. We have, therefore, in column I of List 2 a kind of appendix to List 1. The names and the tribute both belong to 454/3, rather than to 453/2, and the record shows them in the latter year only because the hellenotamiai of 454/3 had closed their books before the payments reached Athens with the fleet. No name in column I of List 2 appears in List 1; on the contrary, the Lepsimanioi, * The reasons for abandoning an earlier restoration [IIreAe own are given in A. T. L., I, p. 174, note on 4, V, 32. ® See below, pp. 211-212. Cf. also Nesselhauf, Klio, Beiheft XXX, pp. 24-25; Meritt, D. A. T., p. 92 with note 59. ‘One city, Ouranion, does indeed appear in both groups, and helps to indicate their similar character. 8 ATHENIAN TRIBUTE LISTS whose late payment for 454/3 was booked in 2, I, 12, appear again in the same list (2, VIII, 13), making their payment for 453/2.° The nature of the fleet which was operating in Karic waters in 453 is not known. Meritt once proposed that it was the relief squadron returning from Egypt after the great disaster,’ but this was when the date of the disaster was assumed to be 453,” and the combination is no longer possible now that the traditional date 454 can be vindicated by the chronological study of the events of the Fifty Years.” The names at the bottom of column I in List 2 must be supplemented by restora- tions in the lost lines 2-10 in order to give the complete record of late payments which belonged properly in 454/3. The second column, perhaps, initiated in its own right the record of 453/2. There is no doubt about the first name in this column ([Ko]éazxés), but its precise geographical location is unknown (it is surely Karic) and we cannot be certain (without the quota) whether the payment belonged to 454/3 or 453/2. The columns in List 2, however, were unusually short, and perhaps the change from one year to the next was the occasion for this brevity, being punctuated by the end of column I and the commencement of column II. We have no evidence to decide the issue, and even if the payment of Kodamjs was normal and belonged to 453/2 it may still have been gathered in and brought back to Athens by the ships which brought back also the tribute of column I. The names which should be restored in column I are undoubtedly to be sought among the rare entries at the end of List 4. For purposes of illustration we suggest here a tentative restoration, which we believe to be generally correct, though we did not think it precise enough in detail to justify its inclusion in the text as published in: 47..T...L; EF: ean] [Sf ] [HRI] [’Aduwdés [AMF] [ .covpe ——] 5 [AAAFFEFII] [ Xadxeropés ] [OFF] [Kvdaés | [AMF] [hvBruwés ] [AMF] [KedAapés] [AMF] [@vsovos } 10 [AAMIHI] [Stror] 8 The record of Lepsimandos in the first period was irregular, and it is possible that the payment of 2, VIII, 13 was complementary to that of 2, I, 12 (cf. Meritt, D. A. T., p. 84, note 33), but this is not probable. It is also possible that some of the names represent double payments, covering both 454/3 and 453/2. Ouranion is a case in point. Its quota in List 4 is only PrrtlIl; the quota in List 2 is approximately double this. ° D. A. T., p. 92, note 59. 20 See Gomme, Commentary, I, note 2 on pp. 412-413. 11 See below, pp. 158-180.

The first assessment period (454/3-451/0) is represented also by Al (4. T. L., II, p. 40), the assessment decree of 454, which was copied by Krateros and quota- tions from which have been preserved by Stephanos of Byzantion. As a note on Adpos in his Ethnica Stephanos writes: éo7 xai Kapias Adpos mous, hv ovyKarahéye tais mwéheow trais Kapixais Kparepds év 7 epi Wndiopatwv tpirw “ Kapixds ddpos- Adpos, Paondira.” This comes at the end of a long account of the Phoinikian A@pos and Stephanos thus betrays his belief that there was in Karia a separate Adpos, named in one of the Athenian decrees about tribute. This separate attribution to Karia has been favoured also by some modern scholars, Meineke, for example, in his edition of Stephanos, even suggesting as possible that the quotation from Krateros should be printed with a lacuna after the word Adpos in order to make room for other truly Karic cities to be associated with it and for an additional heading Tlapdudtaxds ddpos to serve as a suitable introduction to Daondira.”” We now know, of course, that Phaselis, though situated geographically in Lykia,“ always appeared in the tribute lists under the heading Kapixds ddpos, or (when the Karic and Ionic panels were merged) under ‘Iwvxds dépos. Plainly Krateros and Stephanos were both correct, the one in his copy and the other in his quotation. Every city to the east of Karia in the tribute lists was Karian, whether it lay in Lykia, Pamphylia, Kilikia, or (for that matter) on the coast of Phoinike, and hence there is no more reason to deny the identity of Doros in Al with the well-known Phoinikian city than there is to deny the identity of Phaselis with the Phaselis of Lykia.** Koehler long ago arrived at the correct equation,” observing that the only evidence for Doros being Karian *2 August Meineke, Stephani Bysantii Ethnicorum quae supersunt, I (Berlin, 1849), p. 256: mirum vero Phaselin accenseri urbibus Caricis. itaque nescio an post Sépos Caricarum urbium nomina omissa sint, ante Daondira autem exciderit TappuAuaxds dopos. *8 Not in Pamphylia, as Suidas and Aristodemos have it; cf. Wade-Gery, Harv. Stud. Cl. Phil., Suppl. Vol. I (1940), p. 135. 4 Yet the tendency persists. Kahrstedt, Gétt. gel. Anz., 1939, p. 413, still seems to believe that Doros was in Karia. ** Urkunden und Untersuchungen, p. 121, note 3: “‘ Adpos war eine phonikische Stadt; dass 10 ATHENIAN TRIBUTE LISTS came from the heading of the Karic list of tribute which Krateros had before him, and suggesting that Athens temporarily had a foothold on the Palestinian coast below Mt. Carmel. These views have been set forth in A. T. L., I (p. 483), and some of the reasons have been given for attributing the assessment list in question to 454 (op. cit., pp. 203-204). The facts are that Krateros arranged his work in chronological order ; that citations from the records of assessment in book IX belong to 410/09; and that the quotations from book III belong earlier at least than 451, for parts of a decree mentioning vavrodixa: are cited in book IV and these quotations may with virtual certainty be attributed to Perikles’ law of citizenship, the date of which is known from Aristotle, ’A@. IIod., 26, 3: ——— émi ’Avriddrov (451/0) 81a 7d tAHO0s TGV wokitav Tlepixdéovs eirdvros €yvwcar, wn peréxery THs TOAEWS, Ss Gv pr e& dudoiy doroiv 7 yeyovds. KOorte * argues that the functions of the fevodixa: in the general scrutiny of 445/4 B. C. (Plutarch, Pericles, 37) must date the law to which Krateros refers at least later than 443/2, when €evodixar (not vavrodixac) were still handling cases of fevia,” and hence he does not believe that Krateros is quoting Perikles’ law. But, as Gomme justly observes,”® the £evodixar seem to have been created and to have functioned for a particular occasion ca. 445//4. Hence one may seek vavrodixa: before as well as after, and Krateros’ law may still be Perikles’ law. Nor is it a contrary argument that the one speaks of penalizing a son who has both parents aliens, implying that it was legitimate to enroll in a phratry if one parent was alien, while the other demands that both parents be citizens. Our quotation from the law in Krateros is fragmentary, and no such fine distinction can be inferred for the whole law from the little that has been preserved. What is certain is that both laws deal with citizenship; that the date 451 B.C. suits admirably the schedule of Krateros’ collection; and that the evidence of the fevodixa: is entirely concerned with a quite different occasion. But the telling argument for dating Krateros’ fragments from book III to 454/3 is his mention of Doros and Phaselis. He was quoting from an Athenian decree, and “although assessments were no doubt made before this date, it was not until 454/3 that they became decrees of the Athenian state.” * The assessment of Doros would have been inexplicable before the campaign to Egypt in 460. Yet for that campaign, eine gleichnamige in Karien existirt habe, ist aus der Schatzungsliste geschlossen, in der der Name unter dem karischen Tribut stand. Sollte nicht doch die phénikische Stadt gemeint sein und die Athener dort vortiibergehend festen Fuss gefasst haben?” 16 Fragment 4 (Krech), from Harpokration, s.v. vavro8ixa:e Avoias éy ra mpds \"AAiBuiddyy, ol yrjows 6 Adyos. apy tes tw *AOnvnow of vavrodixats Kparepos yoiv év ra 8’ trav Yydicudrwv dyoiv “ dav 8é ris €€ dudoiv E€vow yeyorass dparpity, Suixay eva ro Bovdoueyw \"AOnvaiwy, ols dixar cial, Aayydvew 8 rH tvy Kai vég mpos rods vavrodixas.”” Some further evidence about the nautodikai appears in new readings of I.

THE TEXTS OF THE FIRST ASSESSMENT PERIOD ll and thereafter until 454, the Athenians needed a way-station along the route by which they maintained communication with their forces of occupation, a route which led eastward by way of Phaselis, Aspendos, and Kelenderis (all doubtless assessed in 454), and then southward to Kypros, the main forward base, and on to Doros and the mouths of the Nile. One of the public funeral lists is mute epigraphic testimony to the fighting in Phoinike that attended the establishment of this base at Doros in 460.” Athens still remained mistress of the sea, even after the Egyptian disaster,” and no doubt held, or tried to hold, Doros. So it was assessed in 454, the one assessment par excellence in which its name should have appeared. By 450 Athens was fighting again in Kypros, regaining lost ground, and we do not know the fate of Doros or Athenian aspirations concerning it. It may at that time have been completely lost, and Athens definitely could have held no hope of recovering it after the ratification of the Peace of Kallias.* This fragment from Krateros serves therefore to define the extent of the Athenian Empire at the time of its greatest expansion. Incidentally it shows that in the assess- ment decree of 454 there was a geographical panel headed Kapixés ddpos. Presumably the other panels were also headed by their respective titles: “Iwvexds ddpos, “EAAno- mévrios bdpos, amd Opdxns dédpos, and Nnowrixds dépos. In this assessment the Karic and Ionic panels were not combined; when they were, the title \"Iwixds ddpos served as heading for the composite list.°* These geographical headings do not, of course, imply administrative districts ; nor do the geographical divisions in the later assessment decrees and quota lists imply administrative districts. There is no reason, in fact, 7. G., 1*, 929. For the date and interpretation see below, pp. 174-175. 2 See also below, pp. 262-264. 8 The years between 460 and 454 are the most appropriate for the reference which Lykourgos, xara Aewxparovs, 72 (T87), makes to Athenian prestige: Powixny 8 nat Kidtclav éropSyoay. **Gomme (Commentary, I, p. 371, note 2) thinks that the evidence from Krateros for a separate heading “ Kapixds ¢épos” in the assessment of 454 is “ remarkably thin.” But what else was Krateros copying? The presence of Doros eliminates the alternative that it was the assessment of 443 (cf. Meritt, A. J. A., XXIX [1925], p. 258). 28 Schaefer, Hermes, LXXIV (1939), pp. 243-264, makes this abundantly clear, even though his argument has many irrelevancies and misuses much of the evidence. He misses completely the significance of the Decree of Klearchos (D14), which he persists in dating ca. 414 B.C. (op. cit., p. 256), nor does he recognize the reflection of geographical divisions in the quota lists as early as 450/49. At about the same time Kahrstedt, in his review of A. T. L., I, writes (Gétt. gel. Ans., 1939, p. 412): “die Verfasser sind der Ansicht, dass er [Krateros] die Tribute der Veranlegung von 454 und der von 410 genannt hat, der ersten und der letzten nach der Verlegung der Verwaltung nach Athen. Sehr plausibel, wenn wir auch daraus, dass er schon zum Jahre 454 von Kapixds dopos usw. gesprochen zu haben scheint, nicht schliessen diirfen, dass diese Provinzeinteilung schon damals amtlich war.” Administrative classification is here confused with clerical (and practical) convenience. Nor do we understand the implication of “gesprochen zu haben scheint.” This is too vague. Krateros is giving a precise and direct quotation from the official record. 12 ATHENIAN TRIBUTE LISTS except that of orderly record and bookkeeping convenience, why the geographical districts should ever have appeared in the quota lists; in the assessment decrees they were probably useful primarily in defining the routes of the heralds who announced the assessments. The lists of the first four years show no order of names other than that of time of payment,” and such geographical grouping as there is probably means merely that envoys who were neighbours sometimes travelled together to Athens with their money. Beginning with the lists of the second period, one discerns the first fumbling efforts at systematization in the quota lists by an arrangement of names more or less by geographical panels.” Complete systematization was achieved later, but the convenient device of separating the Empire into geographical districts is now proved for the assessment decrees much earlier than it appears, even indirectly, in the quota lists. Nesselhauf recalls Kirchhoff’s thesis that the “ Bezirkeinteilung ”’ may be as early as the history of the Confederacy, and concludes that it may date back to a time between 477 and 448. Krateros proves that the date must be at least as early as 454, and we believe that some grouping into lists that did not overlap, and that yet included all the names, was essential as soon as there was a general alert or any occasion for the despatch of heralds.” We assume, therefore, that a valid copy of each current assessment was kept in Athens, and that after the treasury had been moved from Delos this copy was used as a control whenever the envoys of a tributary city brought in their payment of phoros. The formality of payment was not complete until the money had been delivered to the apodektai and to the hellenotamiai in the presence of the Council. In writing of the early days of the Confederacy Thucydides says that the hellenotamiai were the magistrates who received the money and that the treasury was Delos.” The apo- dektai and the Council, of course, could have had no part in the transaction there. Pollux, on the other hand, is authority for the réle played by the apodektai.” It was the opinion of Schwahn “ that the evidence of Pollux carries little weight and must *6 This observation is of long standing: Beloch, Rh.

Das gilt zwar zunachst fiir die delische Zeit; wenn aber spater darin eine Anderung eintrat, hatte es vermerkt werden miissen. Uberdies THE TEXTS OF THE FIRST ASSESSMENT PERIOD 13 yield to the superior authority of Thucydides, but we interpret his evidence as applica- ble to the years after 454, meaning that the apodektai as agents of the Council received the money which they then handed over to the hellenotamiai as its permanent stewards. The apodektai were not themselves a custodial board, and, though they received funds, they had to distribute them again to the responsible magistrates who enjoyed the duties of public stewardship. The Council is also said to have numbered among its obligations that of receiving the tribute from the allies.” This ultimate responsibility of the Council has been generally recognized,’ and is now assured by the discovery of the new fragments of D7 which describe the process of bringing in the tribute and of reading off the amount of each contribution before the Council. The procedure as outlined in D7 is evidently much more rigorous than it had been before the passage of this decree (448/7), for one of the purposes of the decree was to tighten the control of the Athenian Demos over the collection of money from the Empire. The institution of tokens (€¥pfoda) was probably new, for the decree expressly states that these tokens were to prevent any malpractice on the part of the couriers who brought the tribute to Athens. After 448/7, at least, the envoys from each city came bringing not only the tribute entrusted to them but also a tablet on which the amount of the tribute was written and which was sealed with the city’s own individual token. These tablets were produced on the floor of the Council chamber, and in the presence of the Council the token was matched by the half of it that was kept on file in Athens, the seal on the tablet was broken, and the amount of the tribute read out aloud. If the tribute actually produced did not tally with the amount thus read out the couriers were held to an accounting. This new evidence from D7 gives more detail than we have ever had about the actual booking of the money. There must have been an immediate record made, presumably upon a tablet of wax, with the name of the city and the amount of its payment duly entered. Presumably also this record was made with a reference of verification to the current assessment list in which the names of the cities were arranged in geographical panels. The keeping of this record, and of the money, as Swoboda rightly notes, was the primary business of the hellenotamiai.” In the years of the first assessment period they evidently made no attempt to perpetuate in their records of the tribute received the subdivision into geographical panels which hatten sonst die Hellenotamiai seit der Uberfiihrung der Reichskasse nach Athen gar keine eigene Tatigkeit mehr ausgeiibt, sondern nur eine Ubermittlerrolle gespielt.” *3 [Xenophon], ’A@.

Sie empfingen aber die Phoroi nicht mehr unmittelbar von den Abgesandten der Biindner, sondern durch Vermittelung der Apodektai. Die Hellenotamiai hatten jedoch iiber die Einzahlungen fortlaufend Buch zu fihren.” 14 ATHENIAN TRIBUTE LISTS existed in the assessment. They wrote down the names and the amounts of tribute in chronological order. When one wax tablet had been filled with names, they presumably went on to a second, and a third, and a fourth tablet until the record could be closed at the time of the Dionysiac festival.** If any payments came in after this date, they could still be added, but the record was finally closed at the end of the year when the quotas to the Goddess were reckoned, the entire record submitted to the logistai, and the so-called quota list inscribed on stone and set up on the Akropolis.” Meritt has already commented upon the reflection in these copied records of the spelling of the names from the assessment. There was an intermediary stage between this purely chronological method and the systematic grouping by geographical districts which was perfected in 443/2. The imperfect grouping of List 5 (450/49) suggests that there was an attempt to keep on one wax tablet the receipts from Ionia and Karia, on another the receipts from Thrace, and so on, but determination to hold the records separate was not thoroughgoing and one may suppose that the irregularities in the list show the intrusion of names from one panel into the tablet belonging to another panel. We can only surmise what the reasons may have been, but one simple explana- tion could be that when the scribe had filled one tablet with names he put down the next names in whatever space was available to him whether or not it happened to be in the tablet that belonged to the district pertinent to the name. There was greater systematization in 446, and, as we have noted, the clerical staff had developed its keeping of the books to such a degree of efficiency that one may well believe that in 443/2 the quota lists were a fair reflection even of the assessment list itself. The Dionysia have long been known as the date when the payments of tribute were due. To the literary evidence afforded by Aristophanes and Eupolis ** may now be added the epigraphical evidence of the rubric M[era Atvoviorwa] in 7, IV, 30(A.T.L., I, p. 453; cf. also Meritt and West, dA. J. A., XXXII [1928], p. 291), which names nine cities that paid later than the others and that were subsequently inscribed, and *° Except for late payments. *7 See Swoboda, op. cit., p. 1133.

THE TEXTS OF THE FIRST ASSESSMENT PERIOD 15 the evidence of D7 and D8. These two decrees, the one from 448/7 and the other from 426/5, must be studied together, for some of their provisions are remarkably alike. Both provide for calling a meeting of the ekklesia soon after the Dionysia; “ both provide for publishing the names of the cities which paid and of those which did not pay; and both authorize the despatch of collectors to exact the tribute still due. The wording differs, and D7 speaks of giving receipts to those which paid, of which D8 says nothing (448/7, perhaps, as against 426/5) ; but the important item of simi- larity is the publishing of the lists of cities that paid and of cities that were in default. The best preserved statement is in D7 (lines 20-22): [a]odetyoa: ’APevaiors rip moor Tas amoddcals Tou Popov é|vredé Kai Tas EAdudcras xopis, hidoas [av Ties dow]. Those which paid in full were contrasted with those which were either wholly or in part in arrears, and this meaning of éA\\uwdéoas reappears with the same force in D8 (lines 18-20) : dvay|[ paddvrov 8é ior EAA Jevora| jp] las és oavids ras [wddEs Tas EAduT ]OAsS 76 d6[p]o kai rév draydvr[ov ra dvéuara xa|i reHévar -—-. The similarity between the two decrees requires that rév azaydvr[ov ra dvéuara] must mean “ the names of those who paid in full.” ** The dmdyovres were the paying cities, as argued by Meritt in D. A. T. (p. 34),“ but the word so obviously also means couriers—especially in the early lines of D7—that it must be taken to be the cities as represented in their couriers. The personal consideration was clear, but when the names came to be written on the panel, they were corporate names like “Advraio, \"Edéoror, etc., rather than nomina and nomina patrum.” We do not know whether this formality of inscribing the names of payers and defaulters in each year after the Dionysia began earlier than D7. But at least from 448/7 there must have been a growing archive of these complete records of tribute collection. We have suggested in D8 (line 21, restored) that the tablets were set up in front of the speaker’s rostrum. They were more detailed than the quota lists, and they gave the amounts of tribute, not merely the dwapyai. If they began in 454/3 there must have been as many of them as there were of the quota lists. Yet of the quota lists, which were carved on stone, we have almost a continuous sequence; of these still more valuable records, which were on wood, no single trace has been pre- served. These are the records to which reference is made in D3 (lines 13-16): éay [xowdrv] doéhiopad ri rept rév dderheuadrov Tov év ré[ tor cavt|or ylyveras pedev mpoohenéro “° Schwahn’s attempt in P.

The earlier restoration here (cf. A. T. L., I, p. 162) has been év ré[ou oréde]ox, but this is made improbable not only by the fact that a orjAn implies marble, of which nothing has survived, but by the facts also that there must have been many of them, making the absence of survival still more remarkable, and that D7 and D8 call them oavides or mvdxia.“* We had assumed earlier that these tablets were to be set up in front of the Metro6n, and the text of D8 was so restored in A. T. L., I. Dow had already raised certain objections to this, on the ground, partly, that the space before the Metrodn was probably never used for general notices of such secular character, but he made no alternative suggestion.’ Our present restoration, which places the tablets in front of the bema of the council chamber, has been made largely because of our belief that “ whitened tablets” must have been posted indoors where they would have been at least protected from the weather. Obviously these records were meant to last for a number of years, and we hold that such protection would have been essential. More- over, even the assessments cut in stone were set up inside the Bouleuterion (AQ, lines 24-25). We do not know where, inside the chamber, they were, but a precise location for the oavides can be given by the restoration in D8 of zpdcGe[v 76 Béwaros]. We conceive that the tablets need not have been unduly high, but in the prominent position thus suggested they would have been a constant reminder to the Council of the source of Athenian wealth and of the obligations of the allies.“* Mention of the Dionysia in connection with tribute, though not with certainty to be referred to the payment of it, has been rescued from a passage in Isokrates by Norlin and explained at length by Raubitschek.” There was an Athenian decree which authorized the display, talent by talent, of the “ surplus of the funds derived from the tributes of the allies,” “* the money being brought by hirelings into the orchestra during the festival of Dionysos. The phrase 7d wepryvyvépevor éx rdv ddpwr apytpiov cannot mean the annual surplus from current tribute, for the decree belongs to the period “D7, lines 44-45: mwdxiov AcA[evxopévov]; D8, line 19: cavi&k. The reading 8p[aypéio]w in D4, lines 38-39, seems to us preferable to 8p[axyaic]w (so also Meisterhans, Grammatik*, p. 121, note 1105), and it makes easier the orthography assumed above in the reading é& ré[tor cavilor (D3, lines 14-15).

THE TEXTS OF THE FIRST ASSESSMENT PERIOD 17 of the early Archidamian War, and in the Archidamian War there was never an annual surplus.** Nor do we believe that the phrase can mean “ the annually incoming tribute money.” * The verb weprycyvopevov, being present in tense, refers to the ever changing amount of the total surplus. This was suitable for display, and it always included the untouchable reserve of 1000 talents, though in fact the free balance declined in amount regularly throughout the Archidamian War.” This accumulated reserve (Thucydides, II, 13, 3 [T117]) belonged to Athena and to the Other Gods, and drafts against it for the expenses of the war were charged as loans, on which the Athenian state paid interest.” But most of the money had in fact come from the ¢dpor, and there is no need to assume that Isokrates implies the existence of any different fund. There was none. Raubitschek uses an indication in the Knights of Aristophanes “ to suggest that Kleon was the author of the decree and that it was probably passed soon after the death of Perikles. One other detail of bookkeeping should here be mentioned. Schwahn has described how enormous would be the task of merely counting all the tribute if it were to come in on the festival day, and he concludes that it would in fact have been impossible even if the receiving officers and the Council had sat all day doing it, which in itself was hardly to be expected of them during the holiday season.“ One has no need to imagine so strenuous a scene. In the first place, the Dionysiac festival was a terminus post quem non. Any city could pay earlier, some at least undoubtedly did, and in later years we have the evidence of Thucydides that collections were made by Athenian ships during the year.” Even so, the allies were present in Athens in large numbers for the Dionysia and most of the tribute must have been, as a rule, collected at that time. But the collections could be made on working days before the festival, and we believe the process of collection to have been very easy: the appearance before the 4° See below, pp. 341-344. ° So Raubitschek. * See below, pp. 341-344. One may object that the exhibit of decreasing reserves could hardly have been good for morale; but the fund could still provide a pageant of over 2000 porters, each carrying a talent, in any year before 425 B.C. This spectacle could be counted upon to allay anxiety among the allies and stop any rumour that may have spread abroad that Athens was short of money. 527. G., I?, 324. Cf. Meritt, A. F.

The record was made, just as one makes a deposit in a bank today; small payments could be checked at once, and the verification of larger sums looked to later. We suggest this as one of the duties which occupied the hellenotamiai on days when there was no other pressing business. If the envoys who brought the money had departed, their proxenos could guarantee them against a miscount and otherwise represent their interests when the seals on the jars were broken. But there was evidently no long delay. The heralds who set forth to demand arrears also carried receipts for those who had paid. CHAPTER II THE ASSESSMENT OF 454/3 B.C. There is evidence enough from the original membership of the Delian Con- federacy* and from the tribute-quota lists to show what the nature of the first assessment (478/7) must have been. Prerequisite is a determination of the assessment list of 454 (A1); the evidence of the quota lists will therefore be set forth in detail in order that the general conclusions derived from them may be employed later in our study of the assessment of 478/7.” Gomme has proposed certain principles for the calculation of tribute assessed during the first six periods after the treasury of the Confederacy was moved from Delos to Athens. He makes two assumptions: * (1) that a city which is known to have paid at least once within an assessment period paid the same tribute in every year of that period, and (2) that a city which is known to have paid regularly in, say, four or even three of the first six periods -—— paid also in the other two or three periods, unless we have evidence to the contrary.” In general these principles are good, but in searching for the amount of the original tribute it is unnecessary to develop the calculation for each of the first six periods. The important period is the first, before Kimon’s last campaign. Our own opinion, as will appear, is that when the Confederacy first began to function the payments in cash (xpjara) were relatively few; so we favour, for the sake of the argument, including in the assessment of 454 not merely cities that have appeared three or four times in the first six periods, but cities that have appeared even once, unless (as Gomme observes) there is evidence to the contrary, or unless the cities under consideration obviously joined the Confederacy later than 454/3-451/0. Our resulting list will therefore represent a maximum. Every critical reader will wish to control the tabulation and to know more than the total for the period, which is of little use unless he knows how it was reached. Consequently, we put down the list of cities, name by name,‘ with a serial number and an amount of tribute attached to all whom we are prepared at this stage to include in the assessment of 454; if, in our opinion, a city was not assessed in Al, serial numbers and amounts will be withheld. Each city will bear a geographic label. When the evidence from the quotas gives odd (1. e., *See Chapter III of Part III below; for the individual districts see especially pp. 198-199 (Islands), 204 (Ionia), 206-207 (Hellespont), 213 (Karia), 223 (Thrace). ?

The reader will find notes where we feel enquiry is likely to arise, but certain categories of cities which we exclude from the assessment of 454 B. C. can be named more compendiously here: (1) Cities whose first appearances in the records, generally but not always in the special rubrics or in A9 and A10, are caused by apotaxis.* (2) Cities whose lateness in entering the records shows that they were not pre- viously members of the Confederacy; many of these were peripheral and are found in the special rubrics.* (3) Euxine cities (not assessed before 425/4) and Aktaian cities of the Lesbian peraia (not assessed separately before the reduction of Mytilene, 428/7).’ THE ASSESSMENT OF 454/3 1.) ih a DE 1. ‘AB8npirae (Th.) 15 — there is not space for the smaller quota 2.

Ityra lies beyond Phaselis, and so beyond the limits to which the Athenian Empire extended after the Peace of Kallias. Its inclusion in the assessment of 425 shows that it had been assessed earlier, when the coast east of Phaselis was in Athenian con- trol, possibly in 458, almost surely in 454, and possibly also in 450, though this is not equally sure. But so many names in older regions of the Empire were listed separately after the ex- tensive apotaxis of the late 'thirties and of the early years of the war (includ- ing the assessment of 425/4) that we believe the region beyond Phaselis to have been represented in 454 by As- pendos and Kelenderis, and the coast of Phoinike by Doros. These three names we place in the assessment of 454, but we reverse the principle of apotaxis and assume that places like \"Irvpa, Miva, Tépyn, and SiAAvov (there were undoubtedly others) did not in the early years appear separately from the larger cities. The assessment of 425/4 included not only all the larger cities from regions of the Empire which Athens no longer controlled ; it included all the names that could be derived by apotaxis. This is the most reasonable ex- planation also for many broken entries in the text of AQ that cannot be ex- panded to give the name of any known city, C0 Guy [. ]Aove[-—], [. ]pan(-—], [.]Sv8a[--], [.

A maximum of 208 names yields a maximum tribute of 498 talents, 1390 drachmai.* The figure is given in cash, without regard to whether some cities other than Lesbos, Chios, and Samos were still furnishing ships. These were the states, and this the value of the assessment, at the time when the Athenian Empire had its widest extent.’ * Amounts have not been included for four cities: Aspendos, Doros, Karene, and S/.---, which would probably raise this figure by a few talents, but we let the total stand because elsewhere maximum figures have been taken where there has been doubt. ® Diodoros, XI, 85, 2 (T55) ; see below, pp. 259-260. We do not believe that the actual assess- ment of 454/3, the document cut on stone and seen by Krateros (called by us Al), included the names of those cities which were to provide ships. In this respect our proposed assessment differs from A1; but we shall subtract these naval allies, and certain other cities, later (see below, Part III, Chapter VII, especially pp. 267-268). CHAPTER III THE TEXTS OF THE SECOND ASSESSMENT PERIOD (450/49-447 /6) 1. COMPLEMENTS AND ARREARS Period II, from the assessment of 450 to that of 446, saw the conclusion of peace with Persia, and the most conspicuous symptom of this is the absence of a quota list for 449/8.* The period naturally falls into the two parts, List 5 before the peace, and Lists 7 and 8 after the peace. We have found no cogent evidence of any completely fresh assessment between 5 and 7-8,’ and we believe the cities who paid tribute were of approximately the same number (just over 160) in all three years. But they were not the same cities: there are some dozen who pay in List 5 but not in 7 or 8, and about the same number who pay in 7 and 8 but not in 5. No new assessment was needed for the former names to drop out, but some revision of the assessment in 448 may account for the latter names coming in. The simpler explanation, that they were assessed in 450 but failed to pay immediately, is perhaps more likely, whether because they held that the prospect of peace released them from the obligation, or because those troubles in Thrace and the Hellespont which led ultimately to the operations based on Eion and Tenedos (8 I 105, II 108-109) were already pre- occupying them. The other conspicuous feature is the recording of complementary payments and of arrears. In the task of tracking these items, to avoid ambiguity, we keep as strictly as possible to the following nomenclature. The most comprehensive term is “ pay- ment ”’; a “ whole-payment ” is the payment in one sum of the whole tribute due. By “ partial payment ” we denote a city’s first payment for any given year if that payment is partial; the further payments, if made in the same year, we call “ complementary payments ” or “ complements.” But if the payment of the balance left by a “ partial payment ” is deferred (or its record is deferred) to the next year, we call that “arrears.” Either arrears or complement may be paid in more than one instalment. We reserve the term “ whole-arrears ” for cases in which the whole sum due is paid after the end of the year in which it was due. We note, at this stage, that the above distinctions refer (in strictness) to the 1 For this date for the missing list see below, pp. 278-281, 299. 2 That is to say, the figures, where comparable, seem to stay the same after the peace as they were before. The change of spelling from [T']puvxés in 5 IV 33 to Bo[v]vxaés in 7 IV 12 is remarka- ble; possibly we should write [B]puvxés in 5 IV 33. 29 30 ATHENIAN TRIBUTE LISTS record rather than to the actual payment. The payment which was first entered in the record was not necessarily the first payment made by the city; a payment whose record is deferred to the next year need not have been actually made so late as that. We believe that some at least of these apparent “ arrears” and “ complements ” are really moneys levied (e.g., on cities near the Hellespont) by a military commander, most probably before the balance was sent to Athens; they were entered late in the record because the record waited for the commander to come home and report the transaction. The evidence for this view is presented in the course of this chapter and we shall not anticipate it here; but we are concerned to make clear that we use the terms defined above (“ arrears,” “ complements,” etc.) without prejudice to the real nature of the payment, and solely on the prima facie evidence of the record. In citing the amounts of payments, we cite always the quota (not the tribute). Wherever feasible we use arabic numerals, giving no denomination; the denomination is to be understood always as drachmai. Obols are shown as fractions of a drachma. No city, until A9, pays a quota of as much as 1 talent. 2. List 5 As A WHOLE List 5 is the first in which we find the names grouped according to the tribute districts. In Period I, we have seen, the assessment was made by the five districts (Karic, Ionic, Thrakian, Hellespontine, Insular)* but the order of the names in the quota lists of Period I was probably the order of payments, and certainly was quite irrespective of the districts. It is not till Period IV that the tribute districts are set out, in the quota lists as they had always been in the assessments, into separate panels; but the quota lists of Periods II and III show perceptible traces of this grouping. This is probably to be explained by the fact that the tribute of each district was received at Athens, and booked, in its own special register ; * the quota lists from List 5 onwards are consolidated out of these separate district lists. No care was taken in this act of consolidation (until Period IV) to preserve the groups intact, but the effect is naturally not obliterated. We shall disentangle the groupings for List 5 only; in List 7 they are more confused, but the Ionic-Karic names are massed in columns I and II, Thrakian and Hellespontine come chiefly in III, and Insular in IV. List 8 (apart from its appendix) is copied from List 7. List 5 has five columns of names, the first four of 40 lines each (sc. lines 2-41), the fifth of 39 lines (sc. lines 2-40; line 41 was not inscribed). That makes 199 lines * We have no evidence for the order in which these five were put. For Period I see Chapter I above. * See above, pp. 13-14. §T 14-15, II 2-3, 11-12, 26-27, 36-37, III 10-11, 13-14, 19-20, 26-27, 28-29, IV 12-13. That is 11 cases, an average of about 1 in 10 lines of the extant parts of columns I-IV. In our computation THE TEXTS OF THE SECOND ASSESSMENT PERIOD 31 of names; but in columns I-IV two-line names are fairly frequent * and in column V there are several second entries. We may provisionally estimate the second entries in column V at 20 lines and the two-line names in the whole remainder at 16. This will leave (199-20-16 =) 163 names for the list. There appear to be four tribute districts: first the lonic-Karic in column"
