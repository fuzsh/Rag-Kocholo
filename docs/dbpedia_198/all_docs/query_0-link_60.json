He is the producer and host of The Mirror of Antiquity, a podcast featuring classical scholars discussing the intersections of their research, the contemporary world, and their own lives. More importantly to our discussion, He is also the director of Pharos: Doing Justice to the Classics, a website devoted to documenting and responding to appropriations of ancient Greece and Rome by hate groups online. We discuss some of the reasons how, as well as why, White Supremacists have taken to coopting Classical imagery to support their twisted world views.\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/10/special-guest-episode-on-classics-and.html\n\nIn today's special guest episode, I am joined by Dr Denise Eileen McCoskey, Professor of Classics and affiliate of Black World Studies at Miami (OH) University. She has written extensively on the politics of race and gender in antiquity and is currently at work on a project examining the role of eugenics in early twentieth-century classical scholarship. In 2012, she published her book Race: Antiquity & Its Legacy, which will be the topic of today?s conversation. It accounts for the various ways in which ancient cultures thought about race (including race as social practice and racial representations). We also dig into the \"Black Athena\" controversy a bit and why the field of Classics handled it so poorly.\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/09/special-guest-episode-on-race-antiquity.html\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the Second Greco-Punic War (410-406 BC), as hostilities in Sicily draw in Carthage and the Syracusan fleet away from the eastern Aegean and the Hellespont, including Hannibal Mago's first invasion of Sicily and the destruction of Selinus and Himera, the rebellion of Hermocrates, the rise of Dionysius as tyrant of Syracuse, Hannibal Mago's second invasion of Sicily and his destruction of Akragas, and the ceasefire which would see Carthage and Syracuse as the two strongest powers on Sicily\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/08/105-carthage-enters-war.html\n\nIntroduction by Alex Goodman of Antiquity in Question\n\nWebsite: https://anchor.fm/alexandergoodman\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AIQpodcast/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AIQpodcast\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the years 411-410 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the shifting of the naval war to the Hellespont, the vigor that the Athenian democracy showed in carrying on the war effort against Sparta and Pharnabazos with victories at Cynossema and Cyzicus, the re-establishment of the radical democracy at Athens, and the transition from the historical account of Thucydides into that of Xenophon's Hellenica.\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/08/104-athenian-empire-strikes-back.html\n\nIntro by Megan Lewis of Digital Hammurabi\n\nWebsite: https://www.digitalhammurabi.com\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBQo27DbqeB-xG17-kekrdQ\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/digitalhammurabi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/digi_hammurabi\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the years 411-410 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the third and final treaty between the Spartans and Tissaphernes; the comedic plays \"Lysistrata\" and \"Thesmophoriazusai\" by Aristophanes; how the Athenians succumbed to civil war for the first time in nearly a century and saw an overthrow of their democracy by what is known as the 400; the vicissitudes of this new oligarchic government; and how factionalism between extremists and moderates led to its downfall\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/06/103-oligarchic-coup.html\n\nIntro by Anya Leonard of Classical Wisdom Speaks\n\nWebsite: https://classicalwisdom.com/podcast-classical-wisdom-speaks/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ClassicalWisdom\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ClassicalWisdomWeekly/\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the years 413-412 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the Athenian response at home to the Sicilian Disaster, the Spartan and Theban devastation of Attic agriculture and commerce from Decelea, the dissolution of the \"friendship\" between Athens and Persia, the Spartans' building up of a navy and encouraging of revolts of Athenian subject-allies, the shifting of the war to the eastern Aegean, and a series of treaties are made between Sparta and the Persian satrap Tissaphernes\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/05/102-livin-on-persian-prayer.html\n\nIntro by Katie Nelson and Olivia Meikle of What's Her Name Podcast\n\nWebsite: https://www.whatshernamepodcast.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/whatshernamepodcast/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WhatsHerNamePC\n\nIn today's special guest episode, I am joined by director and screenwriter Esme von Hoffman (Festival of Cinema NYC 2019 Winner for Best Director) for her film, Ovid and the Art of Love.

There are also lots of digression on logistics, slaves, baggage trains, training, the Spartan mirage, the brutal experience of war, the fear that it instilled, the war dead, and the transition of soldiers from civilian life to the battlefield and back again, including all the psychological and sociological problems that arise from this.\n\nShow Notes:\n\nhttp://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/04/special-guest-episode-on-greek-land.html\n\nDr Owen Rees\n\nWebsite: http://owenrees.co.uk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/reeshistory\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the year 413 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the rise of Archelaus to the Macedonian throne, the Spartan establishment of Decelea, the defeats by the Athenian army and navy at Syracuse, and the retreat and ultimate surrender of the Athenians, which brought the Sicilian Expedition to an end\n\nShow Notes:\n\nhttp://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/03/101-disaster-in-sicily.html\n\nIntro by Seth Michels of the History Uncensored Podcast\n\nWebsite: http://historyuncensoredpod.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/historyuncensoredpod/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Seth4Nerds\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the years 417-415 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the ostracism of Hyperbolus, the rivalry of Nikias and Alcibiades, the siege of Melos, the lead up and first year of the Sicilian Expedition, and the prosecutions for the Hermai and Eleusinian Mysteries scandals\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2020/01/099-frustrations-and-poor-decisions.html\n\nIntro by Kate Armstrong of The Exploress Podcast\n\nWebsite: https://www.theexploresspodcast.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theexploresspodcast/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/theexploresspod\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the years 421-418 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the breakdowns of the Peace of Nikias; the rise of Alcibiades to prominence at Athens; the differences that arose between Sparta and some of their dissident allies; the diplomatic maneuverings that resulted in the quadruple alliance between Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and Elis; and the decisive Spartan victory at the Battle of Mantinea\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/12/098-peace-unravels.html\n\nIntro by Jacob Collier of The Podcast on Germany\n\nWebsite: https://www.podcastongermany.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PodcastonGermany/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/on_germany\n\nIn this special guest episode, Dr. Liz Gloyn and I discuss her forthcoming book, Tracking Classical Monsters in Popular Culture (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2019).\n\nThis work is the first in-depth study on classical reception and monsters in Anglo-American popular culture from the 1950s to the present day. Throughout the book, Dr. Gloyn reveals the trends behind how we have used the monsters, and develops a broad theory of the ancient monster and its life after antiquity, investigating its relation to gender, genre and space to explore what it is that keeps drawing us back to these mythical beasts and why they have remained such a powerful presence in our shared cultural imagination. Specifically, her book takes us through a comprehensive tour of monsters on film and television, from the much-loved creations of Ray Harryhausen in Clash of the Titans to the monster of the week in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, before examining in detail the post-classical afterlives of the two most popular monsters, the Medusa and the Minotaur.\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/10/special-guest-episode-on-classical.html\n\nDr Liz Gloyn\n\nSenior Lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nWebsite: https://lizgloyn.wordpress.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizgloyn\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the years 423-421 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the death of Artaxerxes and the succession struggle that ends with Darius II on the Persian throne; the continuation of Brasidas' Thracian and Macedonian campaign; the ?Wasps? and ?Peace? by Aristophanes; and the deaths of Brasidas and Kleon during the second battle of Amphipolis, culminating in the ?Peace of Nikias? and the end of the Archidamian War\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/09/097-road-to-peace.html\n\nIntro by Samuel Hume of Pax Brittanica\n\nWebsite: https://paxbritannica.info\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PodBritannica/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/samuelhume10 and https://twitter.com/BritannicaPax\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the years 426 and 425 BC of the Peloponnesian War, including the current nature of Athenian politics as dominated by Kleon the anti-aristocratic demagogue, his feud with Aristophanes as seen in the comedic plays \"The Acharnians\" and \"The Knights\", the Battles of Pylos and Sphacteria that turned the Greek world upside down, and the brutal conclusion to the Corcyraean civil war\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/08/095-greek-world-turned-upside-down.html\n\nIntro by David Cot of the History of Spain Podcast\n\nWebsite: https://thehistoryofspain.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thehistoryofspain/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/podcast_spain\n\nIn this special guest episode, I am joined by Joe Goodkin, a Chicago-based singer/songwriter, who tours the country performing his one-man folk-opera interpretation of Homer?s Odyssey. We discuss what it?s like to be a modern bard and how that has shaped his understanding of the Homeric poems and ancient audiences, as well as what it means to be ?non-traditional? classicists, and what we can do and have been able to do to promote Classics to a general audience and why that is important.\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/07/special-guest-episode-on-being-modern.html\n\nJoe Goodkin\n\nWebsites: http://www.joesodyssey.com and http://www.joegoodkin.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/joesodysseysong/ and https://www.facebook.com/joegoodkinmusic/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/joegoodkin\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the first year and a half of the war (431-430 BC), as both Sparta and Athens initiated their war strategies, including a Theban sneak attack on Plataea that began the war, Peloponnesian land raids on Attica, Athenian naval raids on the Peloponnese and northwestern Greece, Athenian alliances with Odrysian Thrace, a famous funeral oration by Pericles, and a deadly plague that devastated Athens\n\nShow Notes: http://www.thehistoryofancientgreece.com/2019/04/091-attrition-and-plague.html\n\nIntro by Jonathan Adly of the History of the Copts Podcast\n\nWebsite: https://hxofcoptspodcast.wordpress.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hxofcopts/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HxCopts\n\nIn this episode, we discuss the two events over 433/2 BC that led Pericles to claim that he could see war \"coming out of the Peloponnese?
