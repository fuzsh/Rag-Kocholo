        "text": "The Battle of Spartolos took place in 429 BC between Athens and the Chalcidian League and their allies, in the early part of the Peloponnesian War.\n\nThe fall of Potidaea had failed to stop rebellion against Athens in Chalcidice. In an effort to secure sources of imperial revenue and halt further local rebellions the Athenians sent Xenophon with 2,000 hoplites and 200 cavalry to attack Spartolos. They destroyed the crops outside the city and began negotiating with pro-Athenian factions in Chalcidice, but the anti-Athenian factions asked for help from Olynthus. An army from Chalcidice, Spartolos, and Olynthus met the Athenians in battle, but their hoplites were defeated and they retreated to Spartolos. Their cavalry and peltasts, however, gained the advantage over the Athenian troops. Reinforcements soon arrived from Olynthus, and they launched a second attack on the Athenians. The Athenian hoplites could not come to grips with the enemy light troops or horsemen. Eventually the Athenians panicked and were routed, with all of their generals and 430 other men killed.\n\nSource\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org\n\nCopyright: Creative Commons 3.0\n\nMore information\n\nStatistics"
