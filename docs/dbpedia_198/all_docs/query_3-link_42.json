Each volume focuses on a particular period or topic and offers a generous and judicious selection of primary texts in new translations. The texts selected include not only extracts from important literary sources but also numerous inscriptions, coin legends and extracts from legal and other texts, which are not otherwise easy for students to access. Many volumes include annotation as well as a glossary, maps and other relevant illustrations, and sometimes a short Introduction. The volumes are written and reviewed by experienced teachers of ancient history at both schools and universities. The series is now being published in print and digital form by Cambridge University Press, with plans for both new editions and completely new volumes.

This volume has long been promised, and does now finally appear in time for the latest change to UK A-levels. As an absolute neodamodes in studying Sparta I have been greatly dependent on the help offered to me by the two kings and some of the ephors of Spartan studies, (if they will excuse my referring to them in this way!). Professor Paul Cartledge saved me from a huge number of errors, small and great, by his careful reading of a draft, and his comments have greatly improved the text and notes at many points. Stephen Hodkinson’s advice was instrumental in forming the structure of the volume; he provided comments on several sections and wrote the introduction to Spartan Epigraphy; I have also reused, with his kind permission, some of the notes he has previously written for schoolteachers. Maria Pretzler will also recognize many of her notes written for JACT incorporated into this volume. Bill Cavanagh provided the notes on Spartan Archaeology (an area which goes way beyond my understanding) and two of the maps. Paul Christesen has generously shared some of his current research on Sparta, even to the point of allowing a new interpretation of an important text to appear here in advance of its full publication. Naturally, though, none of these experts are to be held in any way responsible for the errors and faults that remain. I am also very grateful to a number of people who have helped translate the texts included here. Brian Wilson translated all the main prose texts: Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon’s Constitution of the Lakedaimonians, and Plutarch’s Life of Lykourgos. It has been a great pleasure working with him on various LACTORs over the years. Ken Hughes translated Tyrtaios, Alkman and Aristophanes. Both these gentlemen will have wondered if their superb work would ever appear in print, and I thank them for their patience as well as their skill. Terence Edwards translated a good deal of Plutarch, not all of which appears here (some will be on the LACTOR website) and meticulously checked the text. Andrew Harker translated several passages of Xenophon. Other translations are mine. Most of the photos are from the wonderful British Museum non-commercial images service. I am grateful to Matthew Nicholson, Polly Low, and the Ashmolean Museum Cast Gallery for assistance with other photos. I dedicate this book to a great friend and former colleague, Jeremy Thomas. M.G.L. Cooley Head of Scholars, Warwick School\n\nTalbert’s ‘Penguin’ volume translates Plutarch’s most important works on Sparta, as well as Xenophon’s Constitution. Rhodes, Greek City States has an excellent section on Sparta. Cartledge, Sparta and Lakonia has a very useful appendix, giving all the texts relating to helots.\n\n1\n\n4 TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Preface 3 Table of Contents 4 List of Figures, Maps, Illustrations and Tables 7 Abbreviations 8 Glossary 9 Introduction to the literary sources 11 15 Introduction to the Epigraphy of Lakonia and Messenia (Stephen Hodkinson) Introduction to Lakonian Archaeology (William Cavanagh) 19 Map 1 Map 2 Map 3 Map 4 Map 5\n\nEastern Mediterranean Greece Lakonia Messenia Sparta\n\n24 25 26 27 27\n\nSection A Sparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry 29 Tyrtaios A1–A12 Alkman A13–A20 Simonides A21–A22 Section B Historical Inscriptions relating to Sparta 43 B1–B23 Chronological arrangement, c. 550 – c. 363 BC Statue of Winged Nike B14a–d Texts of treaties given by Thucydides B16–B22 Thank-offerings for Aigospotamoi B23a–j Spartan Epitaphs B34–B55 Section C Sparta in Religion and Religious Festivals 63 Religious Dedications Apollo C1–C5 Artemis C6–C9 Athena C10–C15 Hera C16–C17 Poseidon C18–C20 Zeus C21–C24 Other Gods C25–C28 Hero-Worship C29–C38 Games and Festivals Olympic Games C39–C60 Spartan Festivals C61–C94 Karneia C61–C68 Hyakinthia C69–C71 Gymnopaidiai C72–C77 C78–C83 Other Festivals Artemis Ortheia C84–C94\n\n5\n\nSection D Spartan Institutions in Theory 89 The Executive Kings D1–D11 The Gerousia D12–D15 The Ephorate D16–D21 The Assembly D23 Social Structure Spartiates D24–D29 Mothakes D30–D31 D32–D35 Helot ownership Helots and Messenians D36–D45 Institutions Laws and Responsibilities D46–D51 Wealth and Property D52–D59 Common meals (syssitia) D60–D63 Women D64–D72 Education D73–D81 The Army D82–D97 The Navarchy D98–D99 The Peloponnesian League D100–D102 Section E Spartan Institutions in Practice 146 The Executive in Action Spartan Royal Line E1–E4 Chilon E5–E7 King Kleomenes E8–E23 Various Spartan attempts to control Athens E10–E14 Spartan help requested for Ionian Revolt, 499 BC E15–E16 Argos E17–E19 Aegina E20–E21 Pausanias and Naval Hegemony E24–E28 Debate in Sparta on the Peloponnesian War E29–E31 Brasidas E33–E40 Kings and Ephors in the Dekeleian War E41–E44 Agesilaos E45– E50 Spartan Society in Practice Society E51–E54 Perioikoi E55–E59 Helots E60–E69 Earthquake and helot revolt E62–E67 Spartan Institutions in Practice E71–E76 Spartan property and wealth Spartan Women E78–E81 Education E82–E83 The Army E84–E115 Plataia, 479 BC E84–E86 Pylos and Sphakteria, 425 BC E87–E96\n\n6 Mantineia, 418 BC Leuktra, 371 BC The Navy Lysander and the Navarchy Four accounts of the Battle of Notion, 407 BC The Peloponnesian League The League and the Peloponnesian War Sparta and Persia\n\nE97–E104 E106–E112 E116–E136 E118–E136 E121–E124 E137–E145 E141–E144 E146–E156\n\nSection F The Spartan Mirage 226 Lykourgos F1–F7 Thermopylai F9–F29 Spartan Sayings F30–F37 Section G Contemporary Athenian views of Sparta 247 Section H An Historical Overview Eighth and seventh-century Sparta Sparta in the sixth century Sparta and the Persian Wars The ‘Pentekontaetia’ 480–431 BC The Peloponnesian War, 431–404 BC Sparta’s hegemony and decline, 404–362 BC Corinthian War and the King’s Peace, 395–387 BC Spartan Aggression Resistance to Spartan Aggression\n\nH2–H7 H8–H14 H15–H19 H20–H37 H37–H44 H45–H74 H48–H56 H57–H61 H62–H74\n\nSection K Sparta and Lakonia 282 The City of Sparta K1–K5 Bibliography 285 Concordance of Literary Passages 288 Concordance of Inscriptions 294 Index of People 296 Index of Places and Peoples 301 Index of Themes 305 Chronological Overview inside back cover\n\n7 LIST OF FIGURES, MAPS, ILLUSTRATIONS AND TABLES\n\nFigure 1 Figure 2\n\nIvory Lion (photo © The Trustees of the British Museum) Bronze Warrior Statuette\n\nFigure 3 Figure 4\n\nLakonian hydria (photo © The Trustees of the British Museum) ‘Rider Painter’ kylix (photo © The Trustees of the British Museum)\n\nMap 1 Map 2 Map 3 Map 4 Map 5 Map 6 Map 7\n\nCentral and Eastern Mediterranean 24 Southern Greece 25 Lakonia 26 Messenia 27 Town of Sparta 27 The Peloponnesian League, 431 BC 144 Pylos and Sphakteria 187\n\nIllustrations B5b B14b B14c B25a B36 C17 C19 C20 C27 C28 C36 D64 E71 E155b\n\nThe Serpent Column (photo Matthew Nicholls) Winged Nike by Paionios (photo A.E.

Square brackets enclose editorial material inserted into the texts. This includes chapter and section numbers, references to the texts, explanatory glosses, and supplements to fragmentary literary or epigraphic texts. In some cases I have used square brackets part of the way through a word or name to indicate roughly how much of the original Greek word survives. Like almost all modern editors I have been inconsistent in transliteration of names. In principle I have converted kappa to ‘k’ and chi to ‘ch’. But some names are so familiar in Latinised or Anglicised versions that a consistent rendering would be pedantic and confusing. So Thucydides and Sicily appear (not ‘Thoukudides’ and ‘Sikelia’). I have tried to be more consistent in translating to refer to the ‘Lakedaimonians’ as Greek authors always do. They are less consistent in referring to their town as ‘Sparta’ or ‘Lakedaimon’, but I have replicated whichever name they used. ‘Spartiate’ translates that particular term by which a Greek author designated a full citizen. I do of course use the term ‘Spartan’ in notes to refer to the people and their culture. BM BSA Cartledge, SL\n\nThe British Museum, London The British School at Athens P.

Many literary texts from the fifth century BC onwards reflect an idealisation and distortion of traditions about Spartan society, a concept now generally referred to as the Spartan ‘mirage’ (see introduction to Section F). It is important to understand that there is no ancient text that can serve as a ‘main source’, especially because the most extensive accounts, e.g. Plutarch’s works on Sparta, were written in the Roman period. Moreover, the information about Sparta’s history and culture which is recorded in the surviving literary sources was not recorded by Spartans. Apart from two poets of the seventh century BC, namely Tyrtaios and Alkman, we do not have any literary sources that originate from Sparta. In the classical period, Sparta was not easily accessible to strangers, and therefore many accounts of this period were probably written without personal knowledge of the place, and with little access to primary evidence. Xenophon is a noteworthy exception, but this does not mean that his account is without difficulties. Sparta changed considerably after Messenia was liberated (370/69 BC), and all ancient sources written after the mid-fourth century are either dealing with very different circumstances, or they were actually describing a historical situation which was no longer accurate. Many later sources probably represent a mixture of both failings, combined with Spartan stereotypes. Since Sparta played a central role in Greek history, especially in the Archaic and Classical periods, its foreign policy and military campaigns are prominent in the historical texts that provide the main narrative for these periods, especially Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon’s Hellenika. The goings-on behind the scenes are more difficult to reconstruct, usually by combining the few details about events in Sparta reported by outsiders with our general knowledge of the Spartan constitution and careful analysis of Sparta’s activities abroad. Alkman: poet of the late-seventh century, BC, probably Spartan. See intro to A13–A20. Aristophanes: Aristophanes’ comedies were written between 427 and 386 BC to entertain an Athenian audience at a particular religious festival. They are topical and engage with the political situation of the day, but, since playwrights were competing for the audience’s favour, they were probably careful not to present political opinions which would antagonise a large part of the audience. The Lysistrata (performed 411 BC) is among a number of Aristophanes’ comedies which advocate peace with Sparta, and although there are references to some points of contention in the conflict (chosen for double entendre as much as for topicality), the debate about war and peace is mostly conducted in very general (and of course comical) terms. Aristophanes offers us a number of comedy Spartans, both male and female; the Lysistrata is particularly useful as a guide to Athenian stereotypes of Sparta in this period. Aristotle: (384–322 BC) philosopher and polymath from Chalkidike, but based in Athens for much of his adult life. One of his many interests was in the different constitutions of Greek states. His students researched and described 158 constitutions, among them that of Sparta. This does not survive, but was used extensively by later authors, including Plutarch. Aristotle also used this research for his theoretical work in\n\n12 the Politics. He offers valuable criticism of the Spartan system, informed by Sparta’s decline in the fourth century. Athenaios: (flourished c. AD 200). From Naukratis in Egypt. His Deipnosophistai – ‘Scholars at Dinner’ presents, in 15 books, the lengthy discussion of a wide variety of subjects, citing some 1,250 authors and quoting over 10,000 lines of verse. Athenaios thus offers a treasure-trove of extracts from authors whose works do not survive, but he does not offer historical criticism himself. Diodoros: (active 60–36 BC). A native of Sicily, Diodoros wrote a Library of History in 40 books, attempting to set events in Greece alongside those in Rome. For much of his account of fifth-century Greece he seems to have followed Ephoros (see below), but his attempts to convert Ephoros’ topical treatment into the year-by-year accounts he wanted can result in mistakes in his apparently certain chronological framework (e.g. H64). At his best he conveys the virtues as well as the vices of his sources, at his worst he garbles even the accounts he has before him. Ephoros: (c. 405–330 BC), from Kyme (Greek city on the Aegean coast of modern Turkey). His large-scale History from early times to his own day was important in antiquity but now lost, except where quoted directly or used as a major source by other writers (e.g. Strabo, Plutarch and Diodoros). Thought to have been pro-Athenian and inaccurate in military descriptions. Herodotus: wrote c. 450s–420s BC. Herodotus was from Halikarnassos in Asia Minor, and is therefore one of the few Greek authors of the classical period who were not Athenian. He did, however, know Athens well and, some of his views are influenced by the growing conflict between Athens and Sparta in the mid-fifth century. Most of his work is based on original research and inquiries, and is therefore informed by the views of his own time. He often refers to (unnamed) informants, “the Spartans say”, “the Corinthians have a different version”, and it is a characteristic feature of his method that he presents different points of view on many issues. In some instances he also claims to have based his account on Spartan sources which clearly add a different point of view, although we have no way of telling how much of this information is indeed authentic. Herodotus generally admires Sparta’s laws and the virtue and courage they inspired in individual Spartans. His narrative of the Persian Wars, especially the account of the battle of Thermopylai (F9–F26), had a lasting influence on ancient as well as modern perceptions of Sparta. Herodotus does, however, also present a less admirable side of Sparta: her imperialist tendencies, for example the episode of early attempts to conquer Tegea (and all of Arkadia), and the activities of Kleomenes I. Kritias: (c. 460–403 BC). Most famous from Xenophon’s portrayal (Hell. 2.3–4) as the extremist leader among the Thirty Tyrants of Athens (404–3). He was also a wellknown cultural and intellectual figure (friend of Socrates, related to Plato) who wrote plays and works showing his admiration of contemporary Sparta, which survive in occasional quotations. He seems to have started the Spartan ‘mirage’ (see section F).\n\n13\n\nOxyrhynchos Historian: the name usually given to the Athenian author of a narrative history of Greece found in quite substantial papyrus fragments at Oxyrhynchos. He cannot be identified for certain, but appears to be reliable and a near-contemporary of the events he describes. It is clear that Ephoros and Diodoros followed his account rather than Xenophon’s. Pausanias: (2nd century AD, from Asia Minor) wrote a detailed Description of Greece, based on his own visits, and divided into 10 books, by regions. Pausanias was particularly interested in ancient monuments, cults and traditions, and offers many useful details on these, often confirmed by archaeology. Book III deals with Sparta and Lakonia, but little of the information provided can be firmly linked to the classical period, offering instead a detailed insight into perceptions of Sparta in the Roman period. Book IV, on Messenia, offers a lengthy history of the Messenian Wars now regarded as an invention of the fourth century BC. Plato: (c. 429–347 BC) the great Athenian philosopher. Grew up during the Peloponnesian War and with family members split pro- (e.g. Kritias) and anti-Sparta. Not surprisingly his philosophical dialogues sometimes refer to contemporary Sparta. Plutarch: (before AD 50– after AD 120, from Chaironeia in Boiotia), author of biographical and philosophical writings. Plutarch was a very prolific writer and diligent researcher: often preserving information that is otherwise lost. The Life of Lykourgos illustrates this very well: Plutarch cites dozens of earlier works, and assembles a narrative from divergent opinions. But much of his material also dates from after Sparta’s decline in the fourth century, and any information in his text that is not explicitly identified as taken from a genuinely archaic or classical source should be considered as secondary material. Moreover, while Plutarch was interested in historical detail, he insisted that his Parallel Lives of Greeks and Romans were not history – his main aim was to draw characters which could be instructive as moral examples (see Plutarch, Life of Alexander 1), not to provide historical analysis. This explains why for Plutarch the vague and contradictory traditions about a ‘historical’ Lykourgos were not an obstacle to writing his biography. Plutarch produced a number of works which deal with Sparta or individual Spartans: Lives of Lysander, Agesilaos, Agis and Cleomenes III; and in preparation for writing these he compiled Sayings of Spartans and Spartan Women and Lakedaimonian Institutions later included as part of his Moralia. Simonides: (poet from Keos, flourished around Persian Wars, see on A21 and F20). Strabo: (64 BC – after AD 21). Wrote a Geography in 17 books, a rich source of information about the whole of the Roman Empire, but only occasionally informative about classical Greece. Theopompos: historian from Chios, lived 378/7-c. 320. His summary of Herodotus and continuation of Thucydides survive only in later quotations. His erudition and strong invectives were famous in antiquity and he was known to have been critical of Athens.\n\n14 Thucydides: (c. 455–400 BC). ‘Thucydides the Athenian wrote the war of the Peloponnesians and the Athenians’ as he tells us in the first words of what we call the History of the Peloponnesian War. Later he explains something of his sources of information: “I lived through it all while being old enough to understand it, and applied my attention so as to understand it accurately. In addition it happened that I was exiled from my own country for twenty years after my command at Amphipolis (424 BC) and became familiar with affairs on both sides, especially the Peloponnesians’, because of my exile, and getting a better understanding of them through my leisure.” (5.26.5). The work does indeed seem to draw on information about the goings-on within the Peloponnesian League, although it is difficult to tell how much he really knew about exact details, for example speeches delivered at league assemblies (see Thuc. 1.22.1). Sparta herself remains a somewhat mysterious place (e.g. Thuc. 5.68.2; cf. 4.80.3). Thucydides does not present the Spartans in a deliberately negative light: both sides receive praise and blame for their actions. However, Thucydides’ general view of Sparta seems to be strongly influenced by an Athenian perspective, not so much as an enemy, but rather as a polar opposite, and some of Thucydides’ general statements about Sparta can be read as subtle comments on Athens (see 2.5). Tyrtaios: elegiac poet of mid-seventh century BC, probably Spartan. See intro to A1–A12. Xenophon: (c. 430-c. 350 BC) writer of various prose works. From a wealthy Athenian family, Xenophon fought in Asia Minor for Cyrus and then Agesilaos II, and again for him at the battle of Koroneia, resulting in his exile from Athens. The Spartans gave him an estate near Olympia, and he may have lived in Sparta and even had his sons participate in the Spartan education system (Plut. Mor. 212B). Certainly he had access to first hand information about Sparta and reason to be grateful to Agesilaos and Sparta. The Constituton of the Lakedaimonians (Lakedaimonion Politeia) was probably written in the late 390’s or 380’s BC (chapter 14 is generally considered later). The work offers us the only detailed and well informed information about Sparta before the changes that followed the defeat at Leuktra. Nevertheless, Xenophon’s description remains vague in many respects: it was not meant to be a detailed anthropological study, but rather a kind of political pamphlet, defending Sparta against its critics. The text probably depicts a somewhat idealised Sparta, and Xenophon’s view of Lykourgos represents an extreme position: he credits more aspects of Spartan society to the lawgiver than any other ancient source, and he expresses a particular admiration. It is impossible to determine how much of this reflects genuine Spartan views, but we can probably assume that this is the perspective of a well-informed sympathiser. Xenophon also used his knowledge about Sparta in his other works. The Hellenika (political history covering 411–362 BC) includes many details on Peloponnesian history. Xenophon’s biography of Agesilaos develops the image of the ideal, noble Spartan. Various comments on Sparta can also be found in Xenophon’s philosophical writings.\n\n15 INTRODUCTION TO THE EPIGRAPHY OF LAKONIA AND MESSENIA\n\nThe evidence of epigraphy has been a comparatively neglected aspect of Spartan studies: a neglect that this sourcebook aims to redress. The sources presented include a range of inscriptions displaying the thoughts and actions of a variety of individuals (mostly Spartiate men, but also a sprinkling of others) and collective groups (not just the Spartan polis, but also its enemies, including rebel Messenians). These inscriptions are far from complete or fully representative in their coverage. However, their evidence is more diverse and inclusive than the literary texts, providing contemporary ‘insider’ evidence unmediated by the lens of external or later literary commentators. The comparative neglect of inscriptions is partly due to the Spartiates’ undeserved reputation for illiteracy. Despite Plutarch’s claim that their ‘reading and writing lessons were restricted to the minimum necessary’ (D76), recent studies have shown that the Spartiates were far more literate than previously supposed and that the written word was central to the conduct of polis affairs. The ephors, whose remit included diplomatic negotiations (E43, E144), were elected from the whole citizen body and could include poor citizens (D18). Consequently, ‘the minimum necessary’ was that even ordinary Spartiates needed sufficient literacy to engage with written foreign policy texts, such as the treaties and interim negotiation documents recorded with precision by Thucydides (B16–22). These and other official documents, such as records of Delphic oracles and laws such as the ‘Great Rhetra’ (D8, D48), were probably stored in a rudimentary archival system spread across different locations, including the main sanctuaries and the houses of the kings and other citizens engaged in foreign affairs (E135). How many of these official documents were ‘monumentalised’ as public inscriptions is uncertain. Not secular laws, and probably not oracles either. However, we should not be misled by the small number of public inscriptions surviving today. After antiquity the deserted site of Sparta served as a quarry for lime burners. Also, because the local marble was hard to work, many inscriptions were probably written on bronze plaques, later melted down for their metal content. Diplomatic agreements were often publicly displayed at Sparta itself (B15, B17, B18), as were official lists of sporting victors (cf. C62). Probable lists of victors in contests at local festivals have been found at both Sparta and the perioikic polis of Geronthrai (LSAG 195, 201 nos. 44–47). Dedications celebrating military victories were also frequently inscribed at sanctuaries abroad. These epigraphic practices first become evident in the mid-sixth century, when an agreement with Tegea was displayed on a (now lost) stele set up on the banks of the River Alpheios (Aristotle, fr. 592). Around 500 BC the Spartiates dedicated an inscribed bronze cauldron at Olympia (B3). They also commemorated their exploits in the Persian Wars with monuments at Thermopylai and Delphi (B4–5), and also at home (F27). Similar inscribed dedications after military victories continued at Olympia (B8, 10a–b) and Delphi (B23) for the rest of the fifth century – a practice mirrored by several of Sparta’s enemies (B11, B29, B31–B33). Among enemy dedications, two examples are especially intriguing: first, the dedications of two spear-butts by the Messenian rebels of the 460s, one at Olympia, the other at the sanctuary of Apollo Korythos at Longa in Messenia itself (B9a–b); secondly, the\n\n16 joint dedication by the exiled Messenians and the Naupaktians of the famous winged Nike of Paionios at Olympia in c. 421 BC (B14). Around 470, Sparta set up public inscriptions at Sparta and Olympia listing the multiple athletic victories of one of their former Olympic victors (C45–C46). Public inscriptions at Sparta recording treaties, alliances and a unique war-fund donation list are not attested until the late fifth century (B12, B15, B17–B18), but we should not assume that it was a new practice. The late fifth century also sees the first direct epigraphic evidence for the burial abroad of fallen Lakedaimonian soldiers, the tomb of the war-dead from King Pausanias’ expedition to Athens in 403 (B25a–b); but we know from literary evidence that this practice went back to the sixth century (E11, H12). These public inscriptions are outnumbered by a much greater number of surviving private inscriptions. The vast majority are formal in character: the main categories being religious dedications – including sporting and military dedications – and epitaphs for the deceased. There are just a few examples of informal literacy, most notably at Amyklai: graffiti inscribed on certain terracotta plaques at the sanctuary of Agamemnon and Kassandra (G. Salapata, Heroic Offerings 55) and masons’ names scratched on architectural blocks from the late-sixth-century throne of Apollo (LSAG 200 no. 32). On sixth-century Lakonian black-figure pottery there are a few dipinti clarifying pictured scenes (LSAG 199 no. 8), but no potters’ or painters’ names; even the dipinti disappear from classical Lakonian red-figure pottery. There are no abecedaria and no informal boasts or obscenities. As indicated, the vast majority of private inscriptions are religious in character, expressing a dedication made to a god or hero, most commonly as a thank-offering (C1–C36). These dedications were made at diverse sanctuaries, mostly within Spartan territory, though a significant minority were made at foreign sanctuaries, especially at Olympia and Delphi but sometimes beyond mainland Greece (B7, C16). Some of the private foreign dedications overlap with official inscriptions: for example, the regent Pausanias’ personal inscription on the tripod and serpent column at Delphi celebrating his victory at Plataia, which was erased and replaced by an official Spartan inscription (B5–6); or the so-called Navarchs’ monument at Delphi, which celebrated the Lakedaimonians’ victory at Aigospotamoi, but also gave centre stage to the personal achievement of Lysander and his subordinate naval commanders (B23). Others intersect more indirectly with public foreign policy, such as the inscribed marble seats at Olympia of two Spartiates who acted as proxenoi for the polis of Elis (B1–2), or the memorial to the deceased King Agesipolis I set up by his father, the exiled former king Pausanias (B28). However, the largest category of private inscriptions at foreign sanctuaries is those accompanying the dedications of Olympic athletic and equestrian victors, attested sometimes through the survival of the original inscription (C49, C55, C59), but more frequently through the evidence of Pausanias’ Description of Greece, which describes the surviving monuments and inscriptions of Spartiate chariot-race victors in his account of the sanctuary of Olympia in the second century AD (C52). The private inscriptions within Spartan territory go back to the late seventh century BC (C6, C29) and continue throughout the period covered by this volume. The religious dedications are inscribed on various kinds of objects and materials. The most common is diverse types of bronze items, such as figurines and statuettes of humans, gods and\n\n17\n\nanimals (C3–C4, C17–C19, C27), mirrors (C2, C14), plates or vessels (C8, C29) and miniature bells (C15). There are a significant number of inscribed dedicatory marble or limestone stelai or plaques ((C7, C11–C12, C28, C31, C34, C36), including a notable series of hero-reliefs, as well as some dedications on ivory objects (C6), pottery (C21, C32) and terracotta plaques. Stone or marble stelai were also used by athletes listing multiple victories (C67, C79, C83), for epitaphs (B36–B55) and for a small group of manumission inscriptions (C20). The intrinsic value of the materials used and the production costs of the objects bearing the inscriptions, not to mention the costs of the inscriptions themselves, all suggest that the individuals who commissioned them were mostly well-off persons with a fair degree of disposable wealth. One striking (and perhaps connected) feature, in a society with a reputation for prioritising the collective over the individual, is that the private inscriptions within Spartan territory share the same intensely personal focus as the inscriptions abroad. Many of the dedicatory inscriptions advertise the dedicator’s name (C1, C4–C5, C7–C18, C25, C27–C29, C31). The athletes’ dedications celebrate their individual prowess by listing their victories (C67, C78, C79, C83, C86, C88, C89) or by inscribing the dedication on an object – typically a jumping weight or a discus (C80– C82) – that they used in the contest. Notably, these sporting dedications are far more numerous than the small number of inscribed dedications with military associations (C4, C10). In contrast, most of the inscribed epitaphs are explicit memorials for fallen soldiers (B36, B40–B43, B47, B49–B53) or for priests (B38, B44); but they too are mostly individual memorials, and the deceased’s athletic success is sometimes also mentioned as a supplementary mark of personal esteem (B53; cf. B25a & c). Another striking feature is that these various types of inscriptions come not just from Sparta and its environs, but also from elsewhere in Spartan territory, especially in Lakonia. For example, dedications to Artemis and Apollo occur not only at Spartiate sanctuaries like Artemis Orthia and Apollo at Amyklai, but also at sanctuaries in perioikic areas such as the sanctuaries of Artemis at Pleiai (C9), Apollo Hyperteleatas at Cotyrta (C2–C3), Apollo Maleatas at Prasiai (C4) and Apollo Pythaieus at Tyros (C5). Dedications by athletes at Amyklai and at Athena Chalkioikos on Sparta’s acropolis are matched at perioikic sanctuaries such as that of Apollo at Geronthrai (C79) and the hero Timagenes at Aigiai (C80). Epitaphs for deceased soldiers or priests are found both at Sparta and at perioikic poleis or other settlements such as Pellana (B49), Geronthrai (B43), Leuktra (B39), and Gerenia in Messenia (B44). This implies that free Lakedaimonians across Spartan territory shared common religious practices and epigraphic habits: a sign of the cultural homogeneity underpinning the mutual solidarity of Spartiates and perioikoi in both peace and war. A final notable aspect is a small number of dedicatory inscriptions commissioned by women: mostly by Spartiate women, but at least one inscribed mirror dedicated by a woman, a certain Alkido, is known from the perioikic sanctuary of Apollo Hyperteleatas (P.G. Kalligas, Lakonikai Spoudai 5, 1980, 21). Though few in number, these inscriptions frequently shed light on wider bodies of archaeological evidence. The bronze figure of Eleuthia (C27) – i.e. Eileithyia, goddess of childbirth – dedicated, probably in the fifth century, by a certain Aristomacha, is of unknown provenance; but it plausibly links with two earlier dedications, a bronze pin-head and\n\n18 die, to the same goddess, found at the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia (LSAG, rev. edn. 1989, 447 no. A). The die is dedicated jointly to Eleuthia and Orthia, which fits with Pausanias’ statement (Description of Greece 3.17.1) that Eileithyia’s shrine was ‘not far’ from Artemis Orthia, perhaps within the same temenos. Aristomacha’s dedication also confirms the presence of female dedicators at the sanctuary, already inferred from the large number of bronze jewellery votives and numerous lead figurines depicting model looms and female figures with elaborately patterned dresses. Equally significant is the prominence of female dedicators to Sparta’s patron goddess Athena on the Spartan acropolis. Of the four inscribed bronze offerings found on the acropolis that bear the dedicator’s name, three were dedicated by women: a mirror dedicated by a certain Euonyma (C14) and two bells dedicated, respectively, by Kalikratia and Eirana (for the first of these, C15). The bells, which date between c. 475 and the early fourth century, were not associated exclusively with women: the dedicator of a third inscribed bell was male. However, the fact that two of the three known dedicators of the bronze bells were women makes it probable that women also dedicated many of the surviving 34 bronze and 102 terracotta bells from the sanctuary that are uninscribed or whose inscription omits the dedicator’s name (cf. A. Villing, BSA 97, 2002, 223–295). Bells made in the same workshop also occur outside Sparta: at the Menelaion, at Aigiai in Lakonia and the sanctuary of Apollo Korythos at Longa in Messenia: further evidence, along with the inscribed mirrors, that Spartiate and perioikic women, like their menfolk, shared common religious practices. Of course, the most dramatic piece of female epigraphic evidence comes from outside Spartan territory: Kyniska’s epigram on her statue-base at Olympia, celebrating her four-horse chariot-race success in 396 or 392 (C55), which not only emulated but exceeded the inscriptions of male Spartiate chariot-racing victors by boasting about her royal breeding and her unique position as the only female victor at the Olympic games. Unlike her Spartiate male counterparts, Kyniska’s epigraphic victory celebrations continued inside Lakonikē, to judge from a small inscribed Doric capital and abacus that she dedicated to Helen at the sanctuary of the Menelaion (IG 5.1.235): a fitting dedication for someone whose hero-shrine (C56) was later placed close to the sanctuary of Helen, the role-model for all female Spartiates. Thus the epigraphic texts provide precious evidence for the voices of a few, largely wealthy, women speaking in their own words. Sadly, this inclusivity does not extend to the enslaved populations of Lakonikē, especially the helots, whose voices or condition are revealed only at the moment of their self-liberation (B9) or manumission (C20) from slavery. Stephen Hodkinson Nottingham University\n\n19 INTRODUCTION TO LAKONIAN ARCHAEOLOGY\n\nThe archaeological evidence for the Spartan state is, like the written evidence, fragmentary, biased and open to interpretation. Lakonia and Messenia, the regions dominated by Sparta in the Classical period, are among the better researched parts of Greece, but even so archaeological exploration has barely scratched the surface. Sparta’s sanctuaries, such as those of Apollo and Hyakinthos at Amyklai or of Orthia by the R. Eurotas, have been extensively explored, but much of the town is known only from scattered remains and excavations in advance of modern development; furthermore, the Archaic and Classical levels are often masked or destroyed by Roman building. With a few notable exceptions, such as Geronthrai and Messene, other towns are even less well-known. Happily, a long tradition of archaeological exploration recording the location and surface remains of ancient sites has mapped the main centres in Lakonia and Messenia, and intensive survey has, in recent years, revealed a pattern of small farmsteads and villages. Recording of ancient quarries and road systems adds to our understanding of ancient topography. All the same there are large gaps in our knowledge, and the database of archaeological information, in contrast with the historical sources, is constantly increasing. Careful study of pottery and other artefacts has improved the precision of archaeological chronology, but dates can seldom be refined even as closely as to a generation or two, so archaeological evidence can only rarely be tied in with historical events but serves better to distinguish broad trends in social and economic history. Archaeological Background to the Rise of the Spartan State The Late Bronze Age period (roughly 1700–1100 BC) saw the rise, dominance and fall of Mycenaean kingdoms. Each was ruled from a palace whose king (wanax) exercised military control over its territory, harnessed its economic resources, directed large numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, controlled officials in subsidiary towns, patronised local leaders, oversaw religious festivals, priests and priestesses. All these transactions are recorded on clay tablets (in the script known as Linear B). The palace in Messenia, the area later annexed by Sparta, was at Pylos. In Lakonia, Linear B tablets have recently been found and excavated in another imposing palace at Ayios Vasilios, 13 km south of Sparta. The palatial system declined and disappeared – the palace at Pylos was destroyed around 1200 BC, that at Ayios Vasilios perhaps 100 years earlier. The later centuries of the 2nd Millennium saw the fall of major powers over much of the east Mediterranean, as well as Greece. For the period 1100–800 BC archaeology indicates widespread and catastrophic depopulation, as severe in Lakonia and Messenia as anywhere. Around 900 BC graves around Sparta indicate an early sign of the scattered ‘villages’ from which the later city grew. Pottery of the same period has been found at sanctuaries which were to be the focus of Sparta’s calendar of festivals: of Apollo and Hyakinthos at Amyklai, of Athena on the acropolis, of Orthia by the R. Eurotas. Sparta is not alone: sites elsewhere produce similar pottery, some later to be perioikic towns. Over the next two centuries the offerings become richer, and site-numbers slowly increase. But still both Lakonia and Messenia were thinly populated, and archaeology alone, if we did not have the testimony of Tyrtaios, would not indicate that by then Sparta was well on the way to dominating Lakonia and Messenia. A few warrior graves in Sparta and Messenia are our only hint of unsettled times. Modern scholarship indicates a\n\n20 gulf between the Mycenaean kingdoms and the city states of historical times. The Greeks of the 8th and 7th centuries BC, if in very different terms, recognised that the age of heroes described in the epic tradition was remote from their own world; the Spartans bridged the gap by reference to myth, notably that the Spartan kings as the descendants of Herakles had a right to the land which they and their followers, after moving down from central Greece, had reconquered (A3). How much, if any, historical truth lay behind the myths we cannot say. Early Archaic (8th–7th centuries BC) The increasing prosperity of Sparta is witnessed mainly through finds from the sanctuaries: bronze tripods, elaborate pottery, iron weapons, jewellery, carved ivories. Figure 1. Ivory Lion of 7th century BC, from Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. The lion is 7.5 cm long. BM 1923,0212: photo © Trustees of the British Museum.\n\nSmall temples were built, such as the early one at Pellana (20 km north of Sparta); by the mid-7th century distinctive terracotta roof-decorations (disc akroteria [finials], antefixes, simas [gutters]) characterised Spartan temples. They are found not only at the major sanctuaries such as Orthia and Amyklai, but throughout Sparta and its environs (e.g. the sanctuaries of Zeus Messapeus, Athena Chalkioikos, Agamemnon and Alexandra, Helen and Menelaos) and elsewhere in Lakonia (at Aigai and Kastraki – 35–50 km south of Sparta); the style was imitated widely in the Peloponnese. Even for their time, these are modest buildings – the temple of Orthia measured about 16 x 7 m (roughly one eighth of the size of the peripteral temple of Hera at Olympia, with its great akroterion). Already the Spartans avoid excessive monumentality at home, but the skill and grace of these artefacts serve to undermine the notion of a grim austerity. Little lead figurines, humbler votives, celebrate the participants in festivals: hoplite warriors, female celebrants – perhaps members of choruses (A14) and processions, flute and lyre players, gods and goddesses and the animals sacred to them, token imitations of rich offerings, and the wreath-crowns worn at festivals. The earliest inscriptions found in Lakonia belong to the later 7th century (C6, C29), but the alphabet was first introduced to Greece over a century earlier and almost certainly to Lakonia too; writing will already have formed part of a Spartan’s education. Figure 2. 6th-century bronze statuette, 10 cm. tall of warrior, found at Sparta. BM 1929,1016.6: photo © Trustees of the British Museum.\n\n21\n\nLater Archaic (6th–early 5th centuries BC) The artistic trends observed in the preceding period continued with increasing sophistication. Lakonian pottery includes vessels for symposia, some painted with scenes of luxury, others with images of heroes, but also the unexpected, such as the cup with king Arkesilas of Kyrene in Libya weighing out silphium; great storage jars had elaborate scenes impressed from moulds. This period saw the stone hero reliefs, which have been found both in Sparta and in perioikic Lakonia; however, as in much of the Peloponnese (in contrast to Attica and other regions), free standing kouroi/ korai are not attested. Bronze working reached a high point with massive vessels intricately decorated like the famous Vix krater. The Spartans were au fait with the latest developments in architecture, as witnessed by a few Doric capitals (from near Sparta and from Geronthrai and Kalamai), a triglyph from the Menelaion, and the famous ‘Throne of Apollo’ at Amyklai; but evidence for large temples is hard to identify. The Spartans seem to have had a taste for unusual monuments, often finely worked in valuable materials, such as the ‘Bronze House’ of Athena Chalkioikos.\n\nLakonian pottery of the mid-sixth century BC. Figure 3 (left): Hydria, 39.37 cm tall, found at Vulci in Italy as prized grave-goods. BM 1849,0518.14. Figure 4 (above): Kylix by ‘the Rider Painter’, diameter 17.75 cm. BM 1842,0407.7 Photos © Trustees of the British Museum.\n\nFor the 6th and 5th centuries intensive archaeological survey has revealed a major change in rural settlement and the development of a dense network of small farmsteads and hamlets. A similar process has been recognised in other parts of Greece, though sometimes starting earlier than in Lakonia. Close to Sparta a mixture of sites ranging from the modest to larger and more prosperous ones has been distinguished; on Kythera sites in the interior were given over mainly to production, those on the coast were larger and more prosperous. A scatter of small sites has also been observed\n\n22 in southern Lakonia, for example around the town of Helos. Intensive survey in Messenia, however, has revealed a completely different configuration made up of larger village communities; these evidently housed the helots who worked the land for the Spartans. A large building excavated at Kopanaki in Messenia contained storage jars and loom weights and other finds indicating agricultural activity. These discoveries indicate changing responses to agricultural production; to a degree Sparta and Lakonia followed a trend recognisable elsewhere in the Peloponnese and central Greece, but at the same time its peculiar social and economic organisation influenced the patterns of rural exploitation. In Lakonia, as elsewhere in Greece, pairs of grooves spaced an axle width of 1.4 m apart have traced a network of roads; they were carved to prevent carts from slipping. Our best guess dates them, from the settlements they connected, to the 6th century and later. They are found widely, even high in the mountains, and served for both military traffic and the transport of heavy goods, crops and even people. Classical (5th–4th centuries BC) The picture of Sparta as no more than a collection of villages is an overstatement by Thucydides (H1); like many classical cities it had much open space given over not only to public buildings, but to squares, hippodromes and palaistrai. Unfortunately, archaeology has not provided clear evidence for much of its layout, and we are more reliant on written sources. The agora was a hub from which roads led out to the NE, to the Orthia sanctuary and to the main routes northwards, and the Aphetaïs was the processional road leading south to Amyklai; the agora’s exact location is disputed. Pausanias, writing in the 2nd century AD, lists shrines and temples dedicated to gods and heroes many of which must have gone back to Archaic and Classical times, and there were tombs within the city, some evidently the locus for cult. The royal cemeteries of Sparta’s kings have not, alas, yet been located; they were the most noteworthy but not the only examples of cult dedicated to contemporaries not just to heroes of the mythical past. Public buildings included the Skias, built to shelter the assembly, the Persian Stoa, promoting Sparta’s victory at Plataia, the Spartan messes, and the areas where, much to the shock of other Greeks, not only boys but also girls exercised. Public performances were grand occasions. There is mention of a ‘theatre’ as a site of religious ceremonial, and clay masks imitating original performance masks were dedicated at the sanctuary of Orthia by players of a series of stock characters. The religious processions also saw display in particular, special carriages (kannathra) were decorated with griffins and other beasts while the horses were richly caparisoned. All the same, monumentality was generally muted; though they were kept in repair and re-roofed every so often, evidence for large-scale stone reconstruction of temples is hard to identify. Some perioikic towns (maps 3–4), to judge from surface remains or the area enclosed by their fortifications, were relatively small, no more extensive than some of the Attic demes: Sellasia 3 ha, Epidauros Limera 4 ha, Zarax 3.7 ha, Geronthrai 3.8 ha, Akriai may have reached 7–8 ha. Others such as Gytheion and Boia, for which we do not have data, may well have been much larger. Some of the identifications on\n\n23\n\nmaps 3–4 are secure, but uncertainty surrounds both the location and the status of others, while some of the more obscure towns cannot be placed on the map even approximately. Fortifications, such as those of Epidauros Limera, are thought to belong to the classical period, but are not dated precisely. The Athenian attacks during the Peloponnesian War (and earlier, Thuc. 1.108) on towns near the coast no doubt led to the construction of some defences; we know that Gytheion was fortified at least by 370 BC and excavations at Geronthrai have revealed a late classical phase of construction. The town of Sparta remained open until the Hellenistic period. The port of Gytheion must have been important from early on and was the site of shipyards for the Spartan fleet. Boia also has a harbour and was important for its mineral resources: traces of iron workings are common there, and the more general area has deposits of lead and copper which may well have been tapped in antiquity. In addition to the agricultural commodities (corn, oil, wine), in particular of Messenia, timber may well have been another significant economic resource; the area around Kythera was famous for producing the prized purple dye. Evidence from intensive survey close to Sparta has been used to argue for a gradual transformation in rural settlement. The smaller, possibly more marginal, sites become fewer and their holdings perhaps were swallowed up by the larger, more dominant sites. The location of sites also hints at both more investment in farming and perhaps greater diversification in the exploitation of the landscape. Conclusion In this brief review some of the contributions to our understanding of early Sparta have been summarised. As in the interpretation of the written sources so in understanding archaeological material there is much that is controversial; for example, some argue that it is possible to recognise the onset of Spartan austerity through an apparent decline in artistic creativity in the later Archaic period, whilst others argue that in this respect the Spartans were no different from other contemporaries elsewhere in the Peloponnese and the decline in arts such as vase painting or the making of bronze vessels does not reflect a political or social reform. These and other debates continue. Furthermore, every year there are fresh archaeological discoveries and new evidence leads to new interpretations. Such uncertainties make the study of archaeology both frustrating and stimulating – this section, perhaps more than any other in this book, will certainly need to be rewritten in the future. W. G.

But both pose a variety of problems for the historians. Firstly, of course, they were writing poetry not history, whatever the original intentions or the purposes to which they were later put. Then of course ‘poetry is what gets lost in translation’: the translations here are presented in short lines and verses where appropriate, to remind the reader of the original form, but they are certainly not poetry in English, nor is there any attempt to represent the difference between Tyrtaios’ elegies written in traditional Ionic dialect (as used by Homer) and Alkman’s lyric poetry, written in Doric dialect. A further difficulty is the way in which the poems survive. They were considered classics in later Greek and even Roman times, and were copied by hand for private and public libraries, but do not survive in anything like book or codex form: instead Tyrtaios, Alkman and Simonides survive either on original papyrus copies preserved in inevitably fragmentary condition in the sands of Egypt, or by being selectively quoted by writers, sometimes as historical evidence, sometimes to illustrate a word or literary feature, or sometimes in anthology. Finally we have no direct evidence about the authors themselves: the anecdotes and even mini-biographies that survive are sometimes by authors writing a thousand years later. All ancient Lives of poets tend to treat anything in the poems as autobiographical, and in addition the non-contemporary authors have potentially fallen victim to the reputation of the Spartans; or the irony, surely too good to be true, of Sparta’s poet being a crippled Athenian schoolmaster. For more from these poets, see M. L. West, Greek Lyric Poetry (Oxford University Press, 1993). tyrtaios: A1–A12\n\nTyrtaios seems to have lived in the mid-seventh century BC, and had a lasting influence not only on later sources but also on Spartan culture. His poetry continued to be recited in public and private contexts in Sparta, and it illustrates some of the ideals for which the Spartans were so famous. Today Tyrtaios’ poetry is considered an invaluable primary source for early Sparta which gives us some insight into a time when momentous changes such as the earliest constitutional laws and the conquest of Messene were still a matter of living memory, and some aspects of Spartan life had not yet reached their ‘final’ form. Tyrtaios’ poems therefore allow us to question some later ideas about the development of Spartan society, especially the ‘Lykourgan reforms’. Later authors (e.g. Plutarch) also realised that Tyrtaios was a crucial authentic source for early Sparta, and therefore quoted passages to illustrate arguments about early Spartan history. Apart from a few lines of Tyrtaios that were discovered on papyrus, these quotations ensured the survival of the few poems which are known today. Plutarch, Lykourgos 6.5 (D48 and A4) offers an excellent example, which can be used to compare ancient authors’ use of earlier texts with modern approaches.\n\nA1 The Suda encyclopaedia on Tyrtaios Tyrtaios: son of Archembrotos, Lakonian or Milesian, elegiac poet and piper; it is said that by means of his lyric poetry he encouraged the Lakedaimonians when they were at war with the Messenians and thus gave them the upper hand. He is of very ancient date, contemporary with the so-called Seven Sages, or even older. At any rate, he flourished in the 35th Olympiad (640–637 BC). He wrote ‘Constitution’ for the Lakedaimonians, and ‘Advice’ in elegiac verse, and ‘Martial Songs’; five books. Tyrtaios: the Lakedaimonians vowed that they would either take Messene or die. When the god’s oracular response told them to get a general from the Athenians, they got the poet Tyrtaios, who was lame; he inspired them to courage and captured Messene in the twentieth year of the war. They razed it to the ground and drafted the prisoners into the helots. [Suda, Lexicon, “Tyrtaios”]\n\n30\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry\n\nThe Suda (meaning Fortress) is the name of a tenth-century AD lexicon or encyclopaedia compiled from earlier reference works. Pausanias (4.15.6) has the Athenians deliberately choosing someone likely to be a bad general for the Spartans.\n\nA2 Spartan use of Tyrtaiosʼ poetry (Of the Pyrrhic Dance) The martial character of the dance makes it clearly an invention of the Lakedaimonians. The Lakonians are warlike, and their sons actually learn by heart these marching songs, which are also called ‘Songs-in-Arms’. The Lakonians themselves, too, in their wars march rhythmically while reciting the poems of Tyrtaios from memory. Philochoros says that after the Lakedaimonians had defeated the Messenians through the generalship of Tyrtaios they established the custom on their campaigns that, when they had finished their dinner and sung the Song of Thanksgiving, one by one they should sing the songs of Tyrtaios; and the Commanding Officer should be the judge and give a prize of meat to the winner. [Athenaios, Scholars at Dinner 14.29 = Philochoros, FGrH 328 F216] A3\n\nTyrtaios 2: ʻEunomiaʼ (Rule of Law) [ ... ] let us obey [the kings who are] 10 Nearer to the race [of the gods?] For Zeus himself, the son of Kronos and husband of fair-crowned Hera, Has given this city to the sons of Herakles; Together with them we forsook windy Erineos And arrived in the wide island of Pelops. 15 [Tyrtaios 2, Rule of Law = Strabo, Geography 8.4.10]\n\nPart of a longer poem, found on Papyrus Oxyrhynchos 38.2824, with traces of several previous and one subsequent line visible. Lines 12–15, also fragmentary on the papyrus, are quoted by Strabo who wrote, ‘Tyrtaios indeed says he is from that place in the elegiac poem which is entitled ʻEunomiaʼ’.\n\nA4\n\nTyrtaios 4: Delphi’s advice on governing Sparta Having listened to Phoibos, they brought home from Delphi Godʼs oracles with their verses of certainty; The leaders in counsel are the kings, honoured of the gods, For they look after the lovely city of Sparta, Together with the eldest-born; and after them the men of the People, 5 Responding in their turn with straight ordinances Are to say the right things and do everything justly And not give the city any crooked counsel, And so victory and power go with the mass of the People. This was the revelation of Phoibos to the city on these matters. 10 [Tyrtaios 4 = Plutarch, Lykourgos 6 + Diodoros 7.12.5–6]\n\nThe text is a combination of passages from Plutarch and Diodoros, see D48 and F5.\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry31 A5\n\nTyrtaios 5: The capture of Messene [...] to our king, dear to the gods, Theopompos, Through whom we captured spacious Messene, Messene good to plough and good to plant. For it they fought ceaselessly for nineteen years With their spears, our fathersʼ fathers With ever long-suffering hearts; And in the twentieth they abandoned their rich tilled fields And fled the great ranges of Ithome.\n\n5\n\n[Tyrtaios 5] These verses on the conquest of Messenia are actually put together from three separate quotations of Tyrtaios in later authors: lines 1–2 are from Pausanias 4.6.5; lines 3–4 from an ancient commentator on Plato, Laws 629a; lines 5–8 from Strabo 6.3.3.\n\nA6\n\nTyrtaios 6&7: The fate of the captured Messenians Like asses distressed by great burdens, Bringing to their masters from grievous necessity Half of all the produce the ploughland bears. Lamenting for their masters, both they themselves and their wives, Whenever the baneful fate of death overtook one. [Tyrtaios 6&7 = Pausanias, Description of Greece 4.14.4–5]\n\nPausanias in his (largely invented) history of Messenia quotes Tyrtaios for how the captured Messenians were maltreated (lines 1–3) and that they were even forced to mourn their masters (4–5). Hdt. 6.58 (D10) notes the compulsion for some perioikoi to mourn a Spartan king.\n\nA7 Tyrtaios 10: ʻDulce et decorum est ...ʼ [106] For everyone in Greece knows that they got Tyrtaios from our city as the general with whom they overpowered their enemies and also set up the way they look after their young; thus they made fine decisions not only in face of the present danger but also for the whole of their future. For he composed elegiac poems which he bequeathed them, which they listen to and are taught to be courageous. [107] And though they have no regard for the other poets, they have valued this one so highly that they passed a law, that whenever they have taken the field under arms they summon everyone to the kingʼs tent to hear the poems of Tyrtaios, in the belief that this would make them especially willing to die for their country. It is useful actually to hear these elegiac poems, in order to understand what sort of deeds made men famous among them. For it is a noble thing for a good man to fall in the front line And die fighting for his country. But to abandon his city and its fertile fields And be a beggar is most wretched of all, Wandering about with his dear mother and aged father, Together with his little children and wedded wife, For he will be hated among all those whom he approaches For surrendering himself to need and hateful poverty. He shames his birth and belies his splendid appearance,\n\n5\n\n32\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry 10 And is dogged by all evil and dishonour. So since no one cares about a man who wanders like this, Or feels respect or pity and the gods do not favour him, Let us fight passionately for this land and die For our children, no longer sparing our lives. But come on, young men, stand firm beside each other and fight, 15 And do not start shameful flight or panic, But make the spirit in your hearts great and valiant, And when you fight against men, do not cling to life; Do not abandon and run away from your fallen Elders, who no longer have nimble knees, 20 For it is indeed disgraceful, when an older man fighting In the front line lies fallen in front of young men, And now with his white hair and grey beard He breathes out his stout heart in the dust, With private parts all bloody in his dear hands – 25 A sight for the eyes that brings shame and wrath – And his skin is laid bare; but for a young man everything is all right, As long as he keeps the glorious bloom of his lovely youth; Wonderful for men to behold and lovely to women, When he is alive, but also fine when fallen in the front line. 30 But let a man stand steadfast with both legs astride Set firm on the ground, biting his lips with his teeth. [Tyrtaios 10 = Lykourgos, Against Leokrates 106–7]\n\nLykourgos, c. 390 – c. 325 BC was an important Athenian statesman, one of whose speeches, against a political opponent, survives, and includes disproportionately long (but useful!) quotation of poets.\n\nA8\n\nTyrtaios 11: Fight bravely! But be confident, for you are descended from invincible Herakles; Zeus is not yet averting his head from you; And do not feel fear and terror at the host of men, But let a man hold his shield straight in the face of their front line, Thinking life hateful and the black fates of death Dear as the rays of the sun. For you know the destructive works of Ares who brings many tears, And you have learnt well the temper of grievous war, And often you have tasted both flight and pursuit, You young men, and have had more than your fill of both. For of those who are brave enough to stand beside each other And go and fight hand to hand in the front line, Fewer die, and they save the host behind them; But when men tremble their valour is completely lost; No one could ever finish recounting all The evils that befall a man if he is dishonoured. For in blazing war when a man runs away You seize the chance to stab him in the shoulder-blades, And it is a disgrace if a corpse is lying in the dust\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry33 20 Pierced behind by a spearpoint in the back. But let a man stand steadfast with both legs astride Set firm on the ground, biting his lips with his teeth, Covering his thighs and shins below and chest and shoulders With the belly of his broad shield; In his tight hand let him brandish his mighty spear, 25 And shake the fearsome crest above his head; By doing mighty deeds let him learn how to make war, And not stand with his shield beyond missile range. But let a man go near and wound his enemy with his long spear Or sword at close quarters and kill him; 30 Putting foot beside foot and pushing shield against shield, And even bringing crest to crest, helmet to helmet, Chest to chest let him fight with a man, Seizing the hilt of his sword or his long spear. And you lightly armed men, crouch behind shields in various places 35 And hurl your great stones, And fire your smooth javelins at them, Standing close by the men in full armour. [Tyrtaios 11 = Stobaeus, Anthology 4.9.16 (on war)] Stobaeus or John of Stobi put together, probably in the early fifth century writers arranged by topic to educate his son.\n\nA9\n\nAD,\n\nan anthology from earlier\n\nTyrtaios 12: Excellence in war I would neither mention nor have any regard for a man For his prowess in running or wrestling, Not even if he had the size and power of the Cyclopes, And defeated Thrace’s North Wind in running; Not if he were more handsome in stature than Tithonos, 5 And richer than Midas and Kinyras; Not even if he were more kingly than Pelops, son of Tantalos, And had the soft-tongued voice of Adrastos; Nor even if he was renowned for everything except impetuous courage; 10 For a man is not good in war, If he could not bear to see bloody slaughter And lunge at his enemies close at hand. This excellence, this prize is the best and finest In the world for a young man to win. This is a general benefaction for the city and all its people, 15 Whenever a man stands foursquare in the front line and abides Unceasingly, and completely forgets shameful flight, Steadfastly risking his life and spirit, And standing beside the next man gives verbal encouragement. This man is good in war. 20 All of a sudden he turns and routs the jagged ranks Of the enemy, and stems the tide of battle with his heroic effort; And moreover if he falls in the front line and loses his dear life\n\n34\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry Stabbed from in front many times through the chest, 25 Through bossed shield and breastplate, Bringing glory to his city and its people and his father, This man is bewailed by young and old alike, The whole city is distressed by a grievous sense of loss; His tomb and his children and their children, And all his line thereafter are renowned among men; 30 Never does his good fame perish nor his name, But though he is beneath the earth, he is immortal, Since raging Ares laid him low when he was standing firm, Excelling while fighting for his land and his children; And if he escapes the long fate of woeful death, 35 And his victory maintains the proud boast of his spear, Everyone honours him, young and old alike: He goes down to Hades only after many delights; As he grows old he is pre-eminent among his citizens, and no one Wants to cheat him of his respect or his rights, 40 But both the young and his peers and the elders, All alike give up their place for him on the benches. So now let every man aim to reach this peak Of excellence with all his heart, not coasting in the battle. [Tyrtaios 12 = Stobaeus, Anthology 4.10.1 and 6 (on war)]\n\nA10\n\nTyrtaios 19: In battle […] and [pouches?] of stones and […] Like hosts of [swarming flies?]. [Some were taken] by Ares, bane of mortal men, […] [In open battle?], while others [he hurled] over [crags]. 5 [So let us] like [locusts or cranes?] [Advance] behind the protective fence of our concave shields, Pamphyloi and Hylleis and [Dymanes] independently [Holding up] our ash spears in our hands. [In this way, entrusting] everything to the immortal gods 10 We shall give obedience to our [sacrosanct] leader. But in a trice, one and all [together], we shall be thrashing away, [Standing firm] at close quarters with spearmen; And awesome will be the clashing of both sides As rounded shields strike shields, 15 And terrifying will be their war-cries as they fall upon each other, [Impaling] men’s breasts on their [spear]; And they will give no ground though pounded [with missiles]; Battered with [great] slingstones [Helmets] will ring out with the clatter of war [unflinchingly]. 20 [Tyrtaios 19 = Berlin Papyrus 11675]\n\nPamphyloi, Hylleis and Dymanes were Dorian tribal names (see Hdt. 5.68 and cf. Plut. Lykourgos 6 = D48).\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry35 A11\n\nFighting the Argives [ … (9 lines unintelligible) … ] […] fierce missiles […] 10 The grey-eyed daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis.

Tyrtaios says in his poems that the initial annexation of the Messenians took place in the time of their fathers’ fathers; and the second, when they revolted after making alliance with Argives, [Arkadians] and Pisatans; the Arkadians provided King Aristokrates the son of Orchomenos as their general, and the Pisatans Pantaleon the son of Omphalion, and in this war he says that he himself was the Spartan general. [Tyrtaios 8 = Strabo, Geography 8.4.10] Fragments from a papyrus from Oxyrhynchos (A11) seem to mention Arkadians and Argives fighting against the Spartiates. This may be the poem Strabo refers to above. The text actually mentions Argives, Elians and Pisatans, but then an Arkadian general. As Pisa was a region of Elis and the terms tend to be used interchangeably to refer to the people living around Olympia, it is very likely that an explanation of one or the other term accidentally replaced the name ‘Arkadians’ in the process of copying the manuscripts. A lkman : A13–A20 Alkman lived perhaps one generation later than Tyrtaios, but wrote poetry different in all respects. It was lyric poetry, i.e. to be accompanied on the lyre; composed in a range of different metres; written in Doric (i.e. Spartan) dialect; most significantly, his subject-matter was startlingly different. The two longest fragments to survive of his poetry were written for girls’ choruses, and show ‘a pronounced homoerotic tenor’ (OCD3, under ‘Alkman’: the entry on Sappho – the Lesbian poetess – describes Alkman as an important and contemporary parallel for Sappho’s love poetry). Other fragments suggest a considerable range to his poetry.\n\nA13 An ancient potted biography of Alkman Alkman: a Lakonian from Messoa: pace Krates who mistakenly says he was a Lydian from Sardis. A lyric poet, son of Damas or Titaros. He lived at the time of the 27th Olympiad (672 BC) when Ardys, the father of Alyattes was King of Lydia. Being a great lover he was the founder of love-poetry. He was born of household slaves. He wrote six books of lyric poetry and the Diving Women. He first introduced poetry sung not in hexameter. He used the Dorian dialect as Lakedaimonians do. [Suda, Lexicon “Alkman”]\n\n36\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry\n\nFor Suda, see A1. Messoa was one of the villages that made up Sparta. Alkman’s birthplace was widely disputed, as shown by the alternative attributed here to Krates (second-century BC scholar): as a Hellenistic epigram on Alkman put it (Antipater of Thessalonica 12 (Gow-Page) = Palatine Anthology 7.18), he was fought over by two continents: ‘Poets have many mothers’. Ardys ruled Lydia c. 652–619 BC and was the grandfather of Alyattes. The dating to Ardys’ reign is probably about right. The statement that he was a great lover is typical of the tendency of ancient biographies to draw conclusions about poets from their subject matter.\n\nA14\n\nAlkman 1: ‘Maiden-song’ [ … ] Polydeukes; [ … ] I do not rate Lykaithos among the dead Nor Enarsphoros and fast-footed Sebros [ … ] and the violent [ … ] [ … ] and helmeted [ … ] [And Euteiches] and lord Areios [ … ] and [ … ] mightiest of demigods; And [ … ] great leader [Of the host] and Eurytos In the turmoil of [Ares’] misery, And [Alkon], mighty warriors, We shall [not?] pass them over: All of them [were overpowered] by Fate [And Device], most ancient powers, And their strength, being unshod, [was loosed].

The racehorse is 50 Venetian; but the mane Of my cousin Hagesichora has a bloom Like pure gold; And her silvery countenance – 55 But why am I telling you face to face? This is Hagesichora here; And the next in beauty after Agido Will be a Scythian horse up against an Ibenian; For as we bring our plough, 60 The Pleiades fight against us, Rising through ambrosial night, To dawn like the star Sirius. For an abundance of purple Is not enough to give any protection, Nor an intricate snake of solid gold, Nor yet a headband From Lydia, the glory Of dark-eyed girls, Nor the hair of Nanno, Nor again godlike Areta, Nor Thylakis and Kleeisisera; Nor if you go to Ainesimbrota’s and say: ‘If only Astaphis were with me And Philylla were to look towards me And Damareta and lovely Vianthemis’. But no, Hagesichora keeps her eye on me.\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n38\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry For is not Hagesichora With her pretty ankles present here, And does she not stay near Agido And praise our festival? But accept, you gods, their [Prayers]; for fulfilment and completion Belong to gods. Chorus leader, I would like to speak: as for myself, I’m just a girl, vainly screeching from a beam, An owl; but even so, most of all I long To please Aotis; for she it was Who cured our troubles; But thanks to Hagesichora, the girls Have trodden the path of lovely peace. For just like the trace-horse [ … (one line lost) … ] In a ship too you must Listen above all to the helmsman; And she is admittedly not More musical than the Sirens, For they are goddesses, but this ten of ours Sings as well as [eleven] girls; And gives voice like a swan on the streams Of Xanthos; and she with her lovely golden hair.\n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\n95\n\n100\n\n[ … (the last four lines of the poem are lost) … ] [Alkman, fragment 1 = Louvre Papyrus E3320] This poem was found on a first-century AD papyrus in Egypt in 1855 and known as the Louvre Papyrus from where it was taken to. The papyrus was clearly part of a scholarly edition of Alkman, since it also has editorial comments which sometimes elucidate the poem (though the commentary too is fragmentary and sometimes confuses the issue!). The text proclaims itself to have been sung by a chorus of ten girls (98–99: the use of first person singular forms, e.g. line 2, seems to be traditional). This fits the genre of partheniai (‘maiden-songs’) attributed to Alkman by several ancient writers on Alkman (Testimonia 8, 9, 15 in Campbell, Greek Lyric II). It is in Doric dialect. The first part of the poem as we have it relates to a Spartan myth, in which Hippocöon and his ten sons exiled his younger brother Tyndareos, but were punished by Herakles (see Paus. 3.15.3 on a statue of Herakles in Sparta, connected to this myth), helped by the sons of Tyndareos (Kastor and Polydeukes). The chorus draws appropriate moral lessons (lines 1–39), which are appropriate to the apparent context of a religious ceremony (81–84). The girls then turn to praise of their own chorus-leader, their clothes, and themselves, and with some suggestion of a (Lesbian) love element. Several elements (besides the gaps in the papyrus) remain obscure: it is not certain whether the chorus is part of a competition – it has been suggested that the reference to the Pleiades (61), normally the star-group, is actually to a rival choir; while the fragmentary commentary seems to suggest that the Pleiades represent Hagesichora (whose name means ‘Leader of the chorus’ and Agido). Ainesimbrota and Aotis are unknown, perhaps some purveyor of love-spells and a goddess, respectively.\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry39 A15\n\nAlkman 2: fragment on the Dioskouroi Most revered by all gods and men They dwell in a home built by the gods […] Kastor – skilled horsemen, tamers of Swift horses – and glorious Polydeukes. [Alkman, fragment 2 = P.Oxy.2389 with Herodian, Figures of Speech 61]\n\nThis fragment was found on a papyrus from Oxyrhynchos, and identified as being by Alkman by an ancient literary manual explaining as ‘Alkmanic’ the use of a plural phrase placed between the two singular names it describes – ‘as in the second ode: Kastor … glorious.’ Praise for the Dioskouroi would be a natural subject for a choir at a Spartan religious festival (compare Alkman 1.1 and note).\n\nA16\n\nAlkman 3: Maiden-song with verses on Astymeloisa [Muses] of Olympos, [fill] my spirits [with desire for new] songs: I [wish] to hear The […] voice of girls Singing a lovely song [to the heav]ens … (line lost) … It will scatter sweet [sleep] from my eyes, And lead me to go to the meeting-place, [Where] I shall rapidly loosen my yellow hair.\n\n5\n\n(Gap of 51 lines)\n\n[ ... ] with desire that makes limbs dissolve, 61 And she gazes more meltingly than sleep or death. And she is sweet quite deliberately. But Astymeloisa gives me no answer, But holding her garland, 65 Like a bright star Of the open heaven Or a golden shoot, or light eiderdown, … (line lost) … […] she moves away on her long legs. 70 Moist perfume, sitting on the maiden’s locks Graces her lovely hair. [Truly] Astymeloisa [goes] through the crowd As the delight of the people … (several lines very fragmentary)… […] I might see if somehow […] she might love me. She might come close and take my soft hand, 80 And I would immediately do whatever she wanted. [Alkman, fragment 3 = P. Oxy. 2387] Another fragment from a papyrus of Oxyrhynchos. The state of the papyrus suggests that each stanza was nine lines in length, and that about fifty lines are lost after the first stanza, and another 35 lines at the end,\n\n40\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry\n\nwhere the very starts of lines can be seen, thus making the poem 14 stanzas (or more). Here we have the first stanza, introducing the song: several opening invocations to the Muses from Alkman are quoted by later writers, e.g. fragments 8, 14, 27. By stanzas 7–9 (lines 64–81) we have moved to the theme of unrequited Lesbian love for Astymeloisa (meaning ‘cared-for by the city’ – line 74).\n\nA17\n\nAlkman 4A […] Poseidon […] I went up from Trygeai To the lovely precinct of the White Goddesses With two sweet pomegranates. The girls, when they had prayed To the fair-flowing river to ensure Lovely marriage, and to experience What is dearest to men and women, A lawful marriage-bed.

[Alkman, fragment 7 = Hephaistion, Handbook on Metres 7.4]\n\nA19\n\nAlkman 45 May our chorus please Zeus’ house and you too, Lord (Apollo). [Alkman, fragment 45 = Apollonios Dyskolos, Pronouns 105a]\n\nA20 Alkman 81 Alkman changed a line by bringing forward the maidens to say, “Father Zeus, if only that man were my husband.” [Alkman, fragment 81 = Scholiast on Homer’s Odyssey 6.244] The (unknown) ancient commentator here cites the views of Aristarchos, the most famous ancient literary critic. He clearly implies that the line he quotes was from a ‘maiden-song’. S imonides : A21–A22 Simonides is a less shadowy figure than Tyrtaios and Alkman. He was from Keos and throughout a long life (c. 556–466 BC) was greatly in a demand as a professional poet, working for a great variety of city-states, rulers and private individuals. He wrote a wide variety of poetry, but was most celebrated for his epigrams, though this resulted in many later epigrams being attributed to him. A substantial fragment of a poem was discovered on an Oxyrhynchos papyrus in 1992 (published in The New Simonides, edd. Boedeker and Sider, OUP 2001). The fragments are of a poem, in elegiac couplets, epic in language which introduces the deeds of the Greeks at Plataia (479 BC, see E84–E86) by comparison with the deeds of the Greek heroes at Troy as celebrated in Homer’s Iliad. The poem was presumably commissioned for public performance at a festival: Rutherford sets out some possibilities in The New Simonides (pages 38–41). Sparta (and Pausanias) seem more prominent than in Herodotus’ account, but we cannot be sure whether this reflects the acknowledged view of Greece at the time (much closer to the event than Herodotus) or a deliberate Spartan slant. Corinth gets a mention (line 35), as does Megara (founded by Nisos, line 37) while ?Pan]dion, in line 41, an Attic hero, suggests a reference to Athens.\n\nSparta from Contemporary Spartan Poetry41 A21\n\n‘The New Simonides’ – Epic style poem on Plataia [ ... ] a pine-tree in a glen [… which] [ ... ] woodcutters cut […] [ ... ] and much [ ... ] [ ... ] the massed ranks [ ... ] 5 [ ... ] Patr[oklos …] [ ... ] brought [you] down [ ... ] [ ... ] by the hand of [Apol]lo [ ... ] [ ... ] being [ ... ] [ ... ] by the sons of [Pr]iam, 10 [ ... ] of evil-min[de]d Paris [ ... ] [ ... ] the chariot of divine justice destroyed [ ... ] after sacking [it] they came to fabled [ ... ] the Greek war-leaders [ ... ] [On whom] immortal glory has been poured by the man 15 [Who] received divine […] from the dark-haired Muses [ ... ] and made famous for fu[ture gener]ations [ ... ] the names of the race of demigods [But] now rejoice, [son] of the glorious goddess, [Daughter] of Nereus of the sea.

[Simonides 9 (Page) = Palatine Anthology 7.251]\n\n‘There are separate tombs for the fallen Lakedaimonians and for the Athenians with epitaphs by Simonides inscribed on them.’ Paus. 9.2.4, describing Plataia. Two epigrams likely to be those mentioned by Pausanias are preserved in the Palatine Anthology of Greek epigrams (also 7.253 = Simonides 8 (Page)): ‘fine epigrams, worthy of a gifted poet on a great occasion’ (Page, FGE on ‘Simonides’ VIII and IX).\n\nsection b SPARTA FROM MAINLY SPARTAN SOURCES This section contains contemporary historical documents, mostly written or at least partly-commissioned by Spartans, and inscribed for public display. These either still survive, or were quoted by writers who saw them and whose readers could also have seen them. They are not, of course, simply neutral historical record – on the contrary, many were explicitly erected to boast of achievements – but as public documents, inscribed at considerable effort and expense, they were subject to contemporary public scrutiny. For an introduction to Spartan Epigraphy, see pages 15–18.\n\nB1 Marble seat at Olympia I, c. 550 BC Gorgos, proxenos of the Eleans [SEG 11.1180a] Marble seat installed in the stadium at Olympia, c. 550 BC. Inscription retrograde and in Lakonian lettering. A proxenos would represent the interests of another city-state in his own town: so Gorgos and Euwanios (B2) were Spartans who acted in the interests of Elis (which also controlled the Olympic festival). (See Hodkinson, PWCS 339–343 (with photo)).\n\nB2 Marble seat at Olympia II, c. 500 BC (The seat) of Euwanios, the Lakedaimonian proxenos. [SEG 26.476] B3 Dedication to Zeus at Olympia The Spartiates dedi[cated this to Oly]mpian [Zeus]. [IG 5.1.1563 = IvO 244] This inscription is on the rim of a lebes (large bronze vessel) and is thought to date to the late sixth or early fifth century BC. It is not known what prompted this dedication.\n\nB4\n\nEpitaph for the dead of Thermopylai, after 480 Tell the Lakedaimonians, passer-by, We followed orders, and here now we lie. [Herodotus, Histories 7.228.2]\n\nFor the context see F20 (Herodotus actually tells us that this inscription was set up by the Amphiktyons), and for another contemporary epigram, see A22.\n\nB5\n\nThe Serpent Column (Greek victory monument), after 479\n\nThe base remains at Delphi, but the column, formed of three intertwined serpents was moved to Constantinople by Constantine and still stands in the ancient hippodrome, though without the metal serpents’ heads (one preserved in Istanbul Museum). It lists 31 sets of citizens, from states which fought in the Second Persian War (480–479 BC), and was dedicated at Delphi, after the battle of Plataia, together with a golden tripod, later melted down (Hdt. 9.81 = E61 and Paus. 10.13–19).\n\nSparta from mainly Spartan sources\n\n44 B5a\n\nSerpent Column inscription\n\nB5b The Serpent Column\n\nThe following fought the war: Lakedaimonians Athenians Corinthians Tegeans Sikyonians Aiginetans [Another 25 names follow, mostly in groups of three]\n\n[ML 27] B6\n\nPausanias’ tripod inscription The Greek leader, when he destroyed the Persian army, Pausanias, dedicated this memorial to Phoibos. [Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 1.132 (see E26)]\n\nNo trace remains of this inscription which Thucydides says Pausanias had inscribed on the golden tripod set up at Delphi together with the Serpent Column (B5) but which was erased immediately: see ML 27 for doubts about where (or even whether) this inscription was written.\n\nB7\n\nPausanias’ Black Sea inscription A memorial of his virtue, dedicated to Lord Poseidon By Pausanias, ruler of spacious Greece, At the Black Sea: a Lakedaimonian by race, the son Of Kleombrotos, of the ancient family of Herakles. [Nymphis of Herakleia, FGrH 432 F 9 = Athenaios, Scholars at Dinner 12.50]\n\nHerodotus (4.81) mentions the dedication by Pausanias at the entrance to the Black Sea (i.e. Byzantium). Nymphis came from Herakleia in Byzantium and wrote A History of My Fatherland in the third century BC, quoting this poem as evidence of Pausanias’ luxury and arrongance and saying that he had the poem inscribed on an existing dedication.\n\nB8\n\nThank-offering to Zeus at Olympia Receive, o Lord Olympian Zeus, son of Kronos, this statue fine, With heart propitious to the Lakedaimonians. [ML 22 = IG 5.1.1562 = IvO 252]\n\nThe inscription still visible on a cylindrical base of stone from Olympia. It was also transcribed accurately with slightly ‘modernized’ spelling by Pausanias 5.24.3 who described the poem as being on ‘a Zeus, twelve feet high, to the right (east) of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, which they say is an offering of the Lakedaimonians, when they put down in war the second Messenian revolt.’ Assuming that Pausanias was right (there is nothing in the inscription itself to provide a certain context), this revolt may have been the famous Helot Revolt of 465 BC, or far less well-attested unrest in Messenia around 490 BC, if such a thing actually happened (see E60).\n\nSparta from mainly Spartan sources45 B9 a) b)\n\nMessenian dedications of bronze spear-butts from their revolt, c. 460 BC The Messenians (Methanians) from the Lakedaimonians The Messenians (Methanians) dedicated this from spoils from the Athenians [a) IvO 247; b) LSAG Messenia no.3]\n\nTwo bronze spear-butts, a) inscribed in a single line on one side, found at Olympia; b) on four sides, found at the sanctuary of Apollo Korythos at perioikic Longa in Messenia. They have only recently been identified as Messenian spoils of the basis of the Erxadieis treaty (B15) which shows that Lakonian dialect allowed theta to stand for double sigma in standard classical Greek, hence ‘Methanians’ = ‘Messenians’. The only, and entirely plausible occasion for such dedications was the Messenian revolt of 464 BC in which the Athenians initially helped the Spartans (see Thuc. 1–101–3 = E62). See Bauslaugh, R. A. (1990) “Messenian dialect and dedications of the ‘Methanioi,’” Hesperia 59: 661–8, with illustrations, including of the Erxadieis treaty.\n\nB10a\n\nThank-offering at Olympia for victory at Tanagra, 458/7 BC [The temple] has [a golden dish] from [Tanagra], [The Lakedaimonians and their] allies put [up the gift]. [One tenth from the Argives and the Ath]enians And [the Ionians] for [the victory] in the war. […] Cor[inthians …] [… (all but one letter lost)…] [ML 36 = OR 112]\n\nB10b Pausanias’ description (Pausanias is describing the Temple of Zeus at Olympia and a statue of Victory at the top of its eastern pediment …) Under the statue of Victory (Nike) a golden shield has been set up with the Gorgon Medusa engraved on it. The epigram on the shield shows who dedicated it and the reason they dedicated it: it reads as follows: The temple has a golden dish from Tanagra, The Lakedaimonians and their allies put up the gift. One tenth from the Argives and the Athenians And the Ionians for the victory in the war. [Pausanias, Description of Greece 5.10.4] Three marble fragments have been found at the site of the temple of an inscription which matches that quoted by Pausanias (with minor dialect differences, not represented here), but which originally contained a third couplet. Most probably the golden shield, described in the inscription as a dish (phiale) because of its shape, was the main dedication, but the Corinthians added a separate dedication. For the battle of Tanagra, see Thucydides 1.107.5 = H23, mentioning that the Athenians had Argive and other allies.\n\nB11 a) b)\n\nArgive spoils from Sparta The Argives dedicated this to Apollo. [The Argives to Apollo] a tenth (of the spoils) from Lakedaimon. [FD 3.1.90 and FD 3.1.573]\n\nThese inscriptions from Delphi, taken together, may represent what Pausanias described in H24b. For the historical puzzle of the Battle of Oinoe, see H24.\n\n46 B12\n\nSparta from mainly Spartan sources The Spartan War Fund, c. 427 BC or later?\n\nFront Side Given by the […], who are friends of the Lakedaimonians, for the war, four hundred darics [(a few words unintelligible)] Given by the Aiginetans to the Lakedaimonians for the war, fourteen mnas and [ten staters] 5 [Given by …]s to the Lakedaimonians [(number)] darics.
