After his graduation from Harvard in 1893 he studied at Munich, Berlin, and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and obtained the degree of. Ph.D. at Munich in 1896. In 1896-97 and again in 1897—98 he spent several months in Athens preparing for publication the great collection of vases from the Argive Heraeum, which he had helped to explore in 1894 and 1895. He returned to America in 1898 and, after a year as instructor in Greek Archaeology at Wellesley College, was called to Bryn Mawr as Associate in Greek Art and Archaeology. In 1901 he was appointed Associate Professor of Greek Art and Archaeology and held this posi- tion until 1904, when he resigned. After this he devoted himself for the most part to research and writing, although in 1904—05 he served as Professor of the Greek Language and Literature in the American School at Athens and later, during the Great War, again taught at Bryn Mawr as Professor of Classical Archaeology in 1917-19. In 1910 and 1911 he was a member of the expedition which, under the lead of his friend, Richard Norton, conducted excavations at Cyrene. ~ From the very beginning of his career, Hoppin was attracted to the Greek vases, and his published work was largely devoted to his chosen field. His doctor’s dissertation Euthymides was issued in 1896. In 1905 his chapter in the second volume of Waldstein’s Argive Heraewm showed at once his command of the whole field of Greek ceramics and his independence and originality in discussing the many unsolved problems of this fascinating branch of archaeology. His Euthymides and His Fellows, published in 1916, is a revised and enlarged edition of his doctor’s dissertation. In 1918 he brought out. A Handbook of Attic Red-Figured Vases in two volumes and followed this in 1924 by A Handbook of Greek Black-Figured Vases. Both of these books are of the utmost value to the specialist and represent a vast amount of research and careful sifting of evidence. His last work was the preparation for publication, in collaboration with Mr. Albert Gallatin, of the vases in his own collection and in that of Mr. Gallatin. Besides these larger works he contributed numerous arti- cles to Tue AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY and other peri- odicals. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of numerous archaeological societies. 1 2 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Such is the bare outline of a life of fruitful activity. It gives little idea of the many-sidedness of the man himself, of his manifold in- terests, his generosity and great capacity for friendship. He num- bered among his friends most of the classical archaeologists of his generation and many older and younger scholars as well. To all of these his death brings a sense of irreparable loss, and the courage and indomitable will with which he continued to work through years of painful illness will always be an inspiration. ae Gon; Archaeological Iustitute of America NOTES ON PAYMENTS MADE BY THE TREASURERS Beoren LANA IN.416-5 B.C. Puate [ Dourinc the spring of 415 Athens was eagerly preparing for the great Sicilian adventure. To make the fleet and its equipment as im- pressive and effective as possible, trierarchs vied with one another for the honor of having the most perfectly appointed trireme and the best trained crew, while the state, drawing liberally upon its treasures, provided the generals in command with every advantage that money could buy. Athens was proud of her strength, so visibly manifest in the glorious fleet soon to set sail for the conquest of Sicily.! We are fortunate in possessing a piece of Pentelic marble * bearing silent witness to the spirit of enthusiasm with which Athens was filled on the eve of the fleet’s departure. This piece of stone was once a part of the treasury accounts of the Goddess Athena, and on it were recorded the payments made by the Treasurers of the God- dess to Alcibiades and his colleagues just before they set sail. AJ- though the inscription is fragmentary and difficult to reconstruct, it is more than ordinarily interesting because of its connection with the very dramatic Sicilian episode in Athenian history. ‘ Chiefly on account of its connection with this episode, I thought it worth while, several years ago, to see whether the inscription could be restored, especially as previous editors, erring in their very sketchy tentative essays to fill in the gaps, had themselves left blanks that could be filled with comparative ease. When the first gaps were filled, the problem became much more difficult because of chronological uncertainties. After numerous efforts to reconcile the inscription with the generally accepted scheme of Greek chro- 1 Thuc., vi, 31. 2 Hicks and Hill, Greek Historical Inscriptions, No. 70; Dittenberger, Sylloge 3 94, lines 35-50; /.G. I, 180-183, frg. e. F'rg. c contains the end of the accounts of the previous year, 417-6, numbered 181 in /.G. I, together with parts of the three first lines of the accounts of 416-5, I.G. I, 182, On frg. e is found a part of the accounts of 415-4, J.G. I, 183. The inscription is written crocvxndév. In num- bering the lines I shall follow the last edition of Dittenberger. Since the restora- tions made in lines 35 and 36 by previous editors are almost certain, even though the name of the secretary is unknown, it is evident that there were either 84 or 85 letters in a line. If there were 84 letters in a line we must omit the h of hots in - line 36, as Dittenberger does, and then we must make a minor correction in Dit- tenberger’s division between lines 36 and 37. The nw of Baré#ev becomes the first letter of line 37. Although absolute certainty is impossible, the difficulty of finding satisfactory restorations for the rest of the inscription if its lines contained 85 letters has convinced me that 84 is the correct number. ‘It is more difficult to ascertain the margin of frg. e in no. 182, but I have concluded that the margin given by Dittenberger is correct. In passing, it should be noted that the bracket before the cota of Aexci9eos in line 36 of Dittenberger is a misprint. For a copy of the inscription, see plate opposite p. 15 infra. American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. X XIX (1925), No. 1. 3 4 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY nology found in the works of such men as Busolt, Meyer, and Dit- tenberger, I became sceptical of their precision. Further study justified my scepticism, and I shall show in this paper how very weak their position has been. As for the inscription itself, while absolute certainty is impossible, I think it extremely probable that it recorded four payments to the Sicilian generals made sometime between Thargelion 27 and Skiro- phorion 14, in the tenth prytany, beginning about two weeks after the mutilation of the Hermae. Furthermore, the Antimachus, whose name appears three times in the last few lines, was not a general but the assessor (rapedpos) of the expedition. Editors of this inscription have assumed that Antimachus was a general, a colleague of Alcibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus.! Beloch alone has recognized that neither the position of the name on the stone nor Thucydides’ detailed account of the events leading up to the expedition warrants such an assumption.? Beloch, however, does not venture to suggest any theory as to the nature of Anti- machus’ connection with the generals. In the treasury accounts of the Goddess there are frequent references to assessors (adpedpor).2 In most cases the radpedpor are clearly deputies or assistants of the Hellenotamiai, for they are named with the latter, sometimes as a board, sometimes as indi- viduals. At times there is no specific mention of assessors at all, although it is probable they are included in the expression ovvapyxovres.* When an individual Hellenotamias receipted for money to be trans- » ferred to generals away from Athens on some expedition, one asses- sor apparently shared responsibility with him.® Again, when money was paid to generals before their departure, on two occasions at least, a mapedpos joined with the generals in releasing the treasurers from all responsibility for such sums.® It may be that he accompanied the expedition as a representative of the Hellenotamiai, with the duties of treasurer or accountant, or perhaps his work was confined to accounting for money spent by the generals before the fleet sailed. It is possible too that his official position was wdpedpos of the strategic board, or even assistant to some individual general, as Dittenberger’s index suggests.? But as the strategic mdpedpos appears nowhere else in ancient records, while the assessors of the Hellenotamiai are well known from the treasury accounts of the Goddess, I am reluctant to make a distinc- 1 See Hill’s article in Pauly-Wissowa, suppl.

Still it must be admitted that the fragmentary nature of our records and the varying formulas? used from year to year make it impossible to be sure that the uncertainties and suspicions of the summer of 415 did not result in the creation of a new official, the strategic rdpedpos, whose duties were to check the full powers hastily granted to the generals before the mutilation of the Hermae and the accusations against Alcibiades, and to safeguard the public interests and the public funds. On the other hand, a responsible official connected with the Hellenotamiai would have provided an equally effective guaranty that the generals would use the funds at their disposal in a proper manner. Whatever the duties of the assessor may have been and to what- ever office he may have been attached, we know from line 40 of our inscription that one of them was associated with Nicias in the year 416-5. We also know that Antimachus was somehow connected with the Sicilian expedition, and putting the two together we may begin our task of reconstruction by tentatively filling in the end of line 40 and the beginning of line 41 as follows: rapédpor ’Avripaxor Hepyeior. Before ’Avtiwaxo. in lines 43, 45, and 47, we also supply the words taken from line 40, kai rapédpor. We must now attempt to fill the blank between the name of Lamachus in line 42% and the words supplied in line 48.’ Our first move is to take Nixiar Nixeparo Kvéavride. from line 40 where the words occur before kai rapédpo. and to place it in the same position in line 48. There is now a blank of ten letters, but in it we should expect to find either Lamachus’ demotic or the name of his father. As Xoevodavos exactly fills the gap, I think we need not hesitate to restore the end of lines 42, 44, and 46 and the beginning of lines 43, 45, and 47 as follows: Aauayor Xocevohavos Nixiac Nuxepato Kvdavrider kal mapédpor ’Avtiwaxor, even though the omission of the demotic is unusual when the father’s name is given.‘ 1Jt is true that other officials had assistants called rdpedpo, e.g., the archons, at least in the fourth century, and the ewthynoi even as early as the fifth. Gilbert, Constitutional Antiquities (London, 1895), pp. 225, 228. These assessors were the personal assistants of individual officials, each euthynos, for example, having two. But the assessors we are considering are apparently attached to the expedition as a whole, not to one of the generals. ‘To me this is a further indication that we are dealing not with personal assistants of the generals, but with an official connected with the Hellenotamiai, on detached service. 2 In the accounts of 417-6 there is apparently no reference to an assessor, an omission that cannot be accounted for entirely by the fragmentary nature of the records. _In the accounts of 410-09, there is only one direct mention of an asses- sor, although there are frequent indirect references, if we are right in thinking that the cvvépxovres included the assessors. 3 The name of Lamachus is in the same place in lines 42, 44, and 46. In lines 42 and 46 it lacks the final iota. Likewise ’Avriuaxor occurs in exactly the same position in lines 43, 45, and 47, so that a restoration that fits one place fits all. 4 But, as can be seen from our inscription, there was no general rule about names. The name of Alcibiades occurs three times without either demotic or father’s name, and Antimachus has only a demotic. It should be noted here that, if the 6 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Since the beginnings of lines 42, 44, and 46 must have contained the dates of payment, each one of them being different, it is a much more difficult matter to find satisfactory readings for this part of the lines. We do know that the number of letters to be supplied before otpateyots is 47 and that the last word ended in a, at least in line 46. Editors have assumed the a to be the final letters of heuépar, and that at first seemed probable,! but their other assumption that the lines began with the usual formula, éi rés Alyeléos rpores mputavevoces Tpire. Tes TpuTaveias, iS untenable, for in its shortest possible form, as above, the formula contains 51 letters without hewépa.2 Furthermore I know of no instance where heuépar comes after the phrase rés rpura- vetas in this or any other similar formula. We must therefore seek another formula that will fit our needs, for it seems clear from the three gaps of exactly the same length where the ordinary formula will not go that the shortened formula was not due to an accidental omission of a word. Assuming then that we are dealing with an intentional variation, not a stone-cutter’s mistake, we may well ask what was its purpose. One thinks first of the possibility that the inscription was too long for the stone, but a glance, however hasty, will show that there was enough of the stone left for the accounts of the following year.’ Since the stone itself offers no explanation, we must look for it else- where. The explanation I think is found in a similar and more drastic abbreviation in the accounts for the year 410-09. For all of the payments of a given prytany one heading suffices. This heading naturally precedes the record of the first payment of the prytany, and in it is given the name and number of the prytanizing tribe. For the other payments of the same prytany, it was enough to give the date of payment. We may then consider the possibility that the last four payments were made in one prytany and that the name and number of the prytany were probably given once for all in line 39. As we shall see later, this hypothesis makes possible a partial lines of the inscription contain 85, not 84, letters, the name Xcevodavos will be one letter too short to fill the gap. As I know of no way to fill the blank of 11 letters except by the demotic ’Emxedicio, | have concluded that the number 84 is correct. See also note 2, p. 3, supra. ’Emuxediows is the only demotic of the tribe Oeneis that gives us the right number of letters. But it is generally, thought that Lamachus belonged to the deme Oe, Wilamowitz, Arist. II, 171 ff.; Kirchner, Prosop. Att. 8981. 1 But in the end I was forced to reject even this assumption. See pp. 7 ff. infra. For another possibility, see p. 15. , 2 The stone shows no traces of lettering in the bie spaces of the preceding lines. That makes it impossible to begin the formula anywhere except at the beginning of a line. 3 We might shorten the formula in several ways, by omitting the words 7és aputavelas, tputavevoces, or the name of the prytanizing tribe, or even two or more of these together, but for none of these omissions have I found a satisfactory parallel. 4'There are also blank spaces at the end of lines 41, 48, and 45 long enough to have allowed the longer formula to be used. 5 Dittenberger, Syll.* 109, lines 14 ff. WEST: PAYMENTS MADE BY THE TREASURERS OF ATHENA 7% reconstruction of lines 39 and 40 and serves to explain why they are so different from those which we are discussing. | There is a further reason for thinking that all of these payments were made in one prytany. Usually money was given to the gen+ erals in charge of an expedition just before they were ready to depart. In case several payments were made for one expedition, they fell within a short space of time, as happened in 414 when funds and reinforcements were sent to aici The two payments made at eas time were seven days apart.! We must now try to fill in the blanks in lines 42, 44, and 46. It ig not sufficient to give merely the day of the prytany, for even in its longest possible form, devrépar kai tpraxooré: heuepar res mpuravelas, it is much too short.2 Furthermore, without doing violence to the formula as it is found, we cannot end the formula with a word whose final letters are a. The word heyepa never follows rés rpuravetas, nor would it be possible to end the formula with devrépar. Likewise the words rés mpuravetas were always a part of the formula, even though it involved a repetition of the phrase.2 Thus the abbre- viated formula, like the longer one, cannot end with a. It will be better to follow the example of the accounts for 410-9 and begin theline . . . re (hewépar) rés rpvraveias. That leaves between twelve and thirty spaces vacant to be filled in some way. Turn- ing now to the accounts of 407-6, also to J.G. I, 274, we find that a double system of dating was sometimes used, by day of prytany and day of month. ‘This is a particularly valuable discovery for us, since it enables us to find a formula ending in aw for line 46. There are four possibilities, devrépar, voumeviar, Suxoweviar, and heve Kal dots 1 Dittenberger, Syll. * 94, lines 63 ff. See also J. ce I, suppl. pp. 159 ff., no. 179 a, for another parallel. Cf. West, Class. Phil. x. p. 3 2 The formula might be revised to read émi rés ees mputavelas Sevrépar kal elxoores heuvépar. This would fill the gap exactly, and it could be used with a line of 85 letters if we vary the margin slightly and end lines 42, 44, and 46 with the first epsilon of ’ Emxeguoion. See note 4, p. 5, supra. It would also have a partial parallel in ré& aire heueépar of line 69 and Dittenberger, Syll3 109, line 23. Other days are possible besides the 22nd, viz., the 24th, 27th, 31st, 33rd, and 36th, so that the same formula by varying the days would serve for the gaps in three lines. We can even restore line 39 on this basis, éri rés HurmoBovrisdos evares mputavevooes mapéouev hevépar rerap|rele kal Sexare: Tés rpvtaveias. That would give us the pos- sibility of four payments during the ninth prytany between the 14th and 36th days, in Thargelion 415 just about the time of the mutilation of the Hermae, when the fleet was completing its preparations for departure. Or we can transfer the payments to the tenth prytany by substituting for évares and reraprec respec- tively dexares and wéumre. The last payment would then fall at the earliest on the 27th day of the prytany, about Skirophorion 20. This is probably too late, for it is likely that the fleet had left Athens a few days before. The dates for the ninth prytany are only a little better, for we should expect a final payment just before the fleet sailed in the first half of Skirophorion. The last possible date for a payment in the ninth prytany is Thargelion 24. Thus there would have been an interval of between two and three weeks between the last payment and the departure of the fleet. But the chief objection to a restoration on this basis is the lack of any exact parallel for the formula ézi rés airés rpvravetas and the omis- sion of rés mpuraveias after the number. 3 Dittenberger, Syll.? 94, lines 10 ff.; 109 b, lines 41 ff. 8 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Before going further with our restoration, we must turn our atten- tion to chronology. Attic chronology is extremely complicated because months and prytanies did not correspond, and it is at best difficult to determine the end of a calendar year. This much seems to be certain, that the fleet was almost ready to sail when the Hermae were mutilated, that it did sail anywhere from two to five weeks later, and that the mutilation of the Hermae occurred about the middle of the month Thargelion, or approximately forty-five days before the end of the calendar year.! If the year of the Boule corresponds with the calendar year, the mutilation came a week or ten days before the end of the ninth prytany. In that case the fleet sailed some time between the fifth -and the twenty-fifth of the tenth prytany and most, if not all, of the payments for the expedition would likewise fall within these limits. We must now try to determine the calendar date for the first day of the prytany or the prytany date for the first of Skirophorion, for, as we have seen, the four calendar dates that might end in ac come’ at the very end, the beginning, or the middle of a month, hae Kal veéa, voumeviar, devrepar, and drxouevia. As the year 416-5 was probably an ordinary year, we must assign Skirophorion 1 to the sixth or seventh day of the tenth prytany, depending upon whether the prytany contained thirty-five or thirty-six days.’ But Keil has expounded the ingenious theory that the Boule did not normally enter upon its duties with the archons and other offi- cials on Hekatombaion 1, the first day of the Athenian year. Ac- cording to the definitive form of this theory, accepted without ques- tion by many scholars,’ the Boule for the year 416-5 should have left office on Skirophorion 18; but as this date for the change of Boule does not agree with calculations made by Keil in working out his theory, he concluded that the mutilation of the Hermae so disturbed the normal procedure of the Athenian government that through a special arrangement the Boule of 415-4 entered office about the first of Skirophorion. Since Keil’s theories have met with very little criticism,’ they must be considered here. At first, I tried to restore the blanks in our in- scription on the supposition that Keil was right and that the tenth prytany of 416-5 began about Thargelion 13, or that the first pry- 1 Busolt, Gr.

Gesch2 II, 2, 230 ff., has not seen fit.to accept Keil’s conclusions. WEST: PAYMENTS MADE BY THE TREASURERS OF ATHENA 9 tany of the following year began about Skirophorion 1. Finding it impossible on the basis of Keil’s hypothesis to work out any restora- tions that would satisfy the rather exacting demands of our inscrip- tion, I was forced to the tentative conclusion that Keil was in error, especially as it is possible to find satisfactory restorations if we as- sume that the year of the Boule coincides with the calendar year. Keil’s premises, therefore, must be reéxamined to determine whether his errors are sufficient to invalidate his whole thesis or whether it will stand after alteration of certain minor details. While Keil’s conclusions are very far-reaching and defined with meticulous exactness, his arguments are highly conjectural and his data meagre. Furthermore, an analysis of the second of his two articles on the di- vergence between the year of the Boule and that of the ordinary cal- endar shows that it probably never occurred to the author to see whether the more or less approximate dates established, as he thought, by the first article would in every case fit into the definite and mathematically precise system that he finally evolved. For example, in the earlier paper Keil figured on the basis of a year of 354 (or 384) days and prytanies of 35 and 36 (or 38 and 39) days, depending upon whether an intercalary month was added to the cal- endar year. But in the end, he concluded that the year of the Boule consisted of exactly 360 or 390 days and the prytanies of 36 or 39 days. Consequently, Keil’s tentative dates for the beginning of “official”? years must be revised in the light of his matured hypoth- esis before they can be used to test that hypothesis. A study of Keil’s chronological table and of the corresponding parts of his argu- ment shows that Keil did not always make the necessary revisions. From his table we learn that the Boule of 414-3 entered office ante Skirophorion 13, a date that he considered established by J.G. I, 274, Suppl. p. 35 (Dittenberger, Syll.2 99), where the period from Gam- elion 7 to Gamelion 24 is placed within the seventh prytany.! But if Keil is right as to his theory that the prytanies of a leap year con- tained 39 days, Gamelion 7 would come during the sixth, not the seventh prytany, even if the year began as early as Skirophorion 10. In other words, Keil forgot to make the necessary revisions, a matter comparatively unimportant in this instance, because even the date adopted, Skirophorion 13, could not be made to fit into the com- pleted system. Keil contents himself with the explanation that 415- 4 and following years were anomalous because the mutilation of the Hermae had upset both the orderly processes of the Athenian gov- ernment and the calendar by which the year of the Boule. was regu- lated. Keil tries to prove that the Boule of 416-5 was dismissed about 18 days before its term had expired in order that the recently elected 1 Op. cit., pp. 45 ff. 10 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Boule might conduct the investigations made necessary by the mu- tilation of the Hermae. Since our literary sources are silent about this dismissal of the Boule from office, Keil uses them only to bolster up a theory first obtained from a study of J.G. I, 183, and then to ex- plain why the conclusions of the first article as to the beginning of the official year 415-4 do not coincide with the perfected theory and the general rule that he had discovered. In brief, Keil says that if the twentieth day of the second prytany, on which day a payment was made for the Panathenaic festival of 415, preceded the festival,—he tries to prove that it did,—then necessarily the first prytany of the year began at least 55 days before Hekatombaion 28, or not later than Skirophorion 3.!_ But to prove that the payment was made before the festival he cites the accounts of the Goddess for the year 410-09 as conclusive evidence that pay- ments were ordinarily made before, not after, the Panathenaic' cele- bration.2, Thus everything depends upon whether this last link in Keil’s long chain of reasoning will hold. But unfortunately, we can readily prove by means of an argument the validity of which Keil would be the first to admit, for he uses it effectively elsewhere in his article, that the payments for the Panathenaic festival did not pre- cede the celebration as Keil so confidently asserts. While I am un- able to prove conclusively that the first prytany of 410-09 began on Hekatombaion 1, I can show that the date given by Keil, one that he stars in his table as proved, is several days out of the way. - As this is one of the key-dates on which Keil’s reconstruction of the calendar after 422 depends, the corrections I shall make suffice to cast dis- credit upon the laboriously wrought structure of Keil’s argument. From Dittenberger, Syll.* 109, we learn that in 410-09 payments for the greater Panathenaic festival were made in the second pry- tany, although the day of payment is not given. Keil concluded from this, first, that the year of the Boule began before Hekatom- baion 1, and, secondly, that the payments for the festival preceded its celebration. While it is possible that the expenses were thus pro- vided for in advance, such a conclusion does not necessarily follow. But since other payments of diobelia made in the seventh and eighth prytanies can be made to coincide nearly with the Lenaea and the Greater Dionysia on the supposition that the year began in the mid- dle of Skirophorion, Keil thought that he had proved his point. In his second paper, he dated the first day of the Bouleutic year 410-9 with great precision on Skirophorion 19.3 If Skirophorion 19 was the first day of the first prytany, the last day was Hekatombaion 25. But the treasurers of 410-09 made cer- 1 Op. cit., pp. 50 ff., 351 ff. 2 Ibid., pp. 40 ff., 349 ff.; Dittenberger, Syll.? 109. 3 [bid., pp. 38 ff., 349 ff. WEST: PAYMENTS MADE BY THE TREASURERS OF ATHENA 11 tain payments for the provisions of the Knights in the first prytany, 2.e., on or before Hekatombaion 25, an obviously impossible thing for them to do according to Keil’s reconstruction of the calendar, since they held office from one Panathenaic festival to another and there- fore were not yet in office three days before Hekatombaion 28. Keil used this valid argument in another place to prove that if Prytany I, 1 fell on Hekatombaion 1, a payment on the 26th day of a prytany in the year 424-3 could not have been made in the first prytany, for, as Keil said, the Treasurers of Athena held office from Hekatombaion 28 to Hekatombaion 28.! Consequently, the earliest possible date for the first day of the second prytany in 410-09 is Hekatombaion 29. But although Hekatombaion 29 is chronologically possible, I con- sider it intrinsically improbable, for it is not at all likely that routine payments to the knights would have been made on Hekatombaion 28, the great day of the festival. Business of this sort would prob- ably be postponed until after the holidays. Furthermore, one may question whether the new treasurers were in charge of the monies of Athena until after the last rite of the celebration, and even then the first day or so would probably be spent in checking up the inventory . left by their predecessors. On the whole I should hardly expect a payment by the new treasurers before the first day of Metageitnion.? In that case, the payments of the second prytany for the Panathe- naic festival came not earlier than Metageitnion 2, and they lose automatically their anticipatory character on which Keil frequently insisted and on which he based much of his argument. | Since the payments do not precede the festival, it seems most rea- sonable to suppose that payment was deferred until the final bill was presented and the account audited. This would be a more satis- factory explanation of payments in the second prytany for Panathe- naic expenditures than Keil’s unnecessary assumption, based on a theory now disproved, that the year of the Boule began before Heka- tombaion 1° Keil further adduced as corroborative proof of his theory the pre- scripts of certain psephismata which are dated both by archon and secretary. The handful of examples cited by him come mostly, as he would have us believe, from years when according to his scheme the year of the Boule began on Hekatombaion 1. There are exceptions that he tried to explain, those from the year 421-0. But he neglected to call attention to the universal practice of dating the accounts of the Treasurers of Athena and other financial documents by archons, and moreover one of the inscriptions which he cited as of 428-7 is now known to date from the year 411-0. Thus there is no longer even a 1Op. cit., pp. 54 ff. 2 Keil’s discussion of the records of 424-3, op. cit., p. 59, parallels this argument. 3 Dittenberger, Syll. 104. 12 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY coincidence, for Keil’s rule works in only two out of the four years when decrees of the assembly were dated by archons.! Turning to the accounts of loans made by the Treasurers of Athena between 426 and 422,? we find them difficult to restore be- cause of mutilations. But Keil, by picking out isolated payments the records of which are incomplete, was able to show to his own satisfaction that the year of the Boule began during this period usu- ally after Hekatombaion 1. To do this he offered sample restora- tions; but it should be noted that in no case did he attempt to apply his theory to payments where the date, the amount, and the interest are known, nor did he verify his first conclusions in the light of his completed theory. Thus the correctness of Keil’s theory can be tested easily by any one really desirous of establishing its truth. One wonders why Keil did not see fit to do this for himself. I shall begin with the first pay- ment of the year 425-4, for the amount of the loan, the interest, and the day of payment are known. I shall use Keil’s methods to show that if his thesis were correct the year 425-4 must have begun about Hekatombaion 25, not Hekatombaion 19. Since Keil thought the interest should be reckoned up to Hekatombaion 27, we subtract 27 from 985, the number of days for which interest was reckoned, so as to ascertain the number of days (958) left in the quadrennium 426- 422. As the payment was made on the third day of the fourth pry- tany, in the second year of the quadrennium, we add to 958 the num- ber of days in the calendar year 426-5 (355) and the number of days in the Bouleutic year 425-4 on which no interest was paid (111)4 and compare the sum (1424) with the total number of days in the quad- rennium (1448). The difference (24) is the number of days of the calendar year 425-4 that had passed before the new Boule entered office. In other words the year of the Boule must have begun Heka- tombaion 25. Turning now to the fifth payment of the year 426-5, it can be shown in the same manner that Keil is in error six or eight days. Hither the first prytany began Hekatombaion 21, or the payment was made about the fourteenth day of the eighth prytany, a date impossible to restore. ‘To complete the test, turn to the loans made — by the Treasurers of the Other Gods in the tenth prytany of 423-2. Interest on a number of small payments was reckoned for 17 days.® Even if we assume that the payments were made on the last day of 1 Op. cit., pp. 67 ff., 334 ff. 272 @. 1,273. ° For Keil’s method of determining the date of Hekatombaion 1, see op. cit., pp. 62-64. For the dates of the year 425-4, see pp. 332 ff. for his discussion of the sixth oration of Antiphon, likewise his chronological table. 4 Keil’s theory requires us to figure 36 days to aprytany. Thus the third day of the fourth prytany would be the 111th of the year. 5 See Dittenberger, Syll.! 29, lines 75-86. WEST: PAYMENTS MADE BY THE TREASURERS OF ATHENA 13 the prytany, an assumption most favorable to Keil but epigraphi- cally impossible, Prytany I, 1, 422 did not begin until Hekatombaion 11, four days after the date given by Keil. Prytany I, 1, 423, there- fore, could not be assigned to Hekatombaion 1 as is required by Keil’s system. I think it is now clear that the epigraphical evidence on which Keil based his theoretical reconstruction of the calendar can be turned very effectively against him. Beloch has pointed out the weaknesses of some of Keil’s arguments, but in his criticism there is very little that can be considered absolute proof.!. Finality is now possible, for the very inscriptions on which Keil relied so firmly prove that Be- loch’s scepticism was in a large measure justified.? Returning now to the year 416-5, one question remains to be set- tled. Was the old Boule dismissed about a month early so that the incoming Boule might have full charge of the investigations? Since I have found no positive evidence to show that Keil is wrong about the early entry into office of the Boule of 415-4, I must content my- self with repeating that Keil has given no satisfactory proof for his contention and has cited no parallel for this extraordinary procedure. Furthermore, neither Keil’s methods nor his conception of the nature of evidence, as shown in the two articles we have been considering, are such as to inspire confidence in his conclusions. The problem - must be left sub judice until we see how the possible restorations of our inscription agree with Keil’s hypothesis. We must now try to reconstruct the inscription in such a way that four payments will fall in one prytany, the last probably about the time of the departure of the fleet in the middle of Skirophorion, dcxoueviar.® In this year, the day of the full moon, Skirophorion 14, fell on or near the twentieth day of the tenth prytany.* It will first be necessary to fill in the beginning of line 40 with the names of the generals as they appear in the other lines.

See Anz. Ak. Wien., 1922, nr. XV-XVII, pp. 43 ff. (S. H. G., 3 , 9). 3 It is possible, though not very probable, that the last payment was made about BrR weeks before, either at the end of Thargelion or at the beginning of Skiro- phorion. 4 If Unger’s precise system of chronology for the years from 423-2 to the end of the Peloponnesian War, loc. cit., note 2, page 8 swpra, should be at fault, we might consider 416-5 a leap year. Then the payments would have fallen probably be- tween Thargelion 26 and Skirophorion 2, or if we assume a line of 85 letters, be- tween Thargelion 25 and Skirophorion 1. 14 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY ing remains of line 39. We know the number of the prytany, but not the day, prytanizing tribe, or day of the month, and it would seem an almost impossible task to discover these facts. When one considers the number of tribes, the number of days in a prytany, and the number of days in a month, together with the number of ways in which the order of words can be varied, it would seem as though there were innumerable versions possible. But when one begins to study the problem, it is soon clear that the difficulty is not in the number of readings that will satisfy all the con- ditions but in finding any reading at all. The requirements are very exacting. For three lines of exactly the same number of letters we must find three feasible combinations of day of month and day of prytany, and for a fourth line another combination which will have a ve in the proper place and in which the day of prytany will come on the right day of the month as determined by the restoration of lines 42, 44, and 46, or vice versa. For a line of 84 letters I have found only one such combination at all satisfactory.1 Thus I would re- construct line 39 as follows: émi rés Hirmofovridos dexares rputavevoces Oapyedtovos Pbivovros|re[Tpadt, Tpirer Tes mpuTavelas. In the blank spaces of lines 42, 44, and 46 we must then insert the following dates: (42) TeTapTEL Tes TpuTaveias, Oapyedrovos Tpirer POivovros, (44) evarer Tés TpuTaveias, UKipopopiovos tpite. hiarapyévo, (46) eixooré: rés mpuraveias, Kal LKipodoprovos duxopevi|ar.2 This restoration is in full accord with the probable departure of the fleet about a month after the mutilation of the Hermae. Further- more payments made between Thargelion 27 and Skirophorion 14 would agree with the custom of making the payments almost imme- diately before the departure of an expedition and in close succession. But if these reconstructions are accepted, we must reject Keil’s hypothesis of a change of Boule about Skirophorion 1. To continue, in line 41 there is only an 7zota left. That is appar- ently the last figure of the sum of the first payment, the one we have just been discussing. As we have no idea just how much money the generals received at this time, we must leave blanks in this line. After Heppyeior, the demotic of Antimachus the assessor, we might put doehiaapévo TO déuo THY adecav, except that there is no place for this formula in the case of the other payments. ' The question now arises whether we were justified in excluding it from the restorations we 1 The only alternative I have discovered is not entirely satisfactory because it groups the payments within a period of five days between Thar. 28 and Skir. 2, probably a week or ten days before the fleet sailed. The alternative readings are as follows: (39) eri’ 7és A ee eee idos dexares Tpuravevooes Oapyedtovos PbivovTos Tpilrelc kal weumre res mpuravelas, (42) hexrer rés mpuravetas, Oapyed6vos devrépac pOivorros, (44) heBdouer rés mputaveias kal Oapyedovos héver kai véar, (46) heuéoar evarer Tés mputavelas, Dkipopoptdvos devréplac.

Possibly one blanket vote authorized all of the payments of the tenth prytany. It is possible too that a certain class of payments could be made without a specific vote of adeia, for in the accounts of the following year no record of this vote was placed on the stone in connection with the payments described as loans. The first payment of the year, not described as a loan, was authorized in the ordinary way.! Did the payments for the Sicilian expedition in the spring of 415 take the form of loans as did those of the following year? Were they on this account subject to a different procedure? Or were some of them loans and others ordinary payments? If that was the case, then some required the vote of adeia, while others did not. That would make it necessary for us to find a place for the word ééaveicauer in one or more of our readings. If we do that, we must give up try- ing to use the double date, for there is no room to add éSaveloaper in any of the readings we have adopted. Dating by months within a prytany was not unheard of.2 On the other hand, if some of the pay- ments were loans and others not, two payments, of different kinds, may have been made on one day. Then we should be able to restore the end of the blank in line 46 as follows: r& atré heuépa.2 The restoration opens the way to a range of possibilities for the other lines even more varied than those we have already considered. Pos- sibly the final solution of our problem is to be sought in this direction, but as yet I have found no combination of readings even as good as those proposed above. For the present, therefore, it will be more consistent to assume that the payment of line 41 was partly or entirely in Cyzicene elec- trum staters. The words xpucio Kufixevds crarépas will fill a part of the blanks, the rest we will leave untouched. Above the re of line 39 are traces of two letters, o., which belong to a previous payment and form the top line of fragment e. Above is fragment c, with an indeterminate interval between the two frag- ments. In line 37, the last of fragment c, is a nu and the tops of some letters which are not yet identified: *..FNT'. As the last pay- ment of the previous year went to the fleet at Melos through the Hellenotamiai, it seems probable that this payment, the first of our year, was destined for Melos too. The only satisfactory combina- tion of letters that I could find was A ..ENEI, which looks as though it might be a part of a demotic or a name in the dative. Line 37 could then be restored approximately as follows: v éypaupdreve mapédocav Heddevorapias . . . Taddevet(?). 1 I believe that all of the payments of 415-4, except the first, were loans, for this reason, that the first payment, made in the third prytany, was recorded out of its proper chronological sequence, that is, before a payment of the second prytany described as a loan. The word éaveicayev, therefore, introduces not merely the second payment of the year but all that follow as well. 2 See Dittenberger, Syll.3 99. 3’ For parallel see Dittenberger, Syll. 94, v. 69. 16 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY In conclusion, our inscription illustrates the intense activity with which Athens was filled during the early summer of 415. Finally it should be noted that neither of Keil’s hypotheses, one of which is demonstrably false, the other unproved, can be reconciled with the inscription as it has been tentatively restored. The inscription as restored is given on the accompanying plate. ALLEN B. Wzst WHEATON COLLEGE, Norton, Mass. 1T give here only what I consider proved. For the blanks I refer the reader to the discussion in the text where the difficulties and alternative readings are stated. When we can settle definitively one or more of the following questions, the number of letters in a line, the octaeteris that was then in use, and the character of the pay- ments, whether loans or not, greater certainty will be possible.

Archaeological Iustitute of America THE METOPES OF THE SICYONIAN TREASURY AT DELPHI Tue following brief observations on three metopes from the little Dorie building at Delphi traditionally known as the Sicyonian Treasury may be of interest to admirers of these gems of archaic Greek sculpture. PHRIXUS ON THE RAM Two varying descriptions of this fragment have been published by M. Homolle. In B.C.H. XX, 1896, p. 660, fig. 1, he wrote: ‘‘Sur le dos trace d’une figure drapée, qui y était autrefois assise dans la méme pose que la femme au taureau; reste d’étoffe du corsage; cassure d’un bras qui s’appuyait au dos de l’animal.”’ And on p. 666 he remarked that the remains of drapery belong to a woman’s garment, and that consequently the rider was Helle. In Fouilles de Delphes, IV, p. 26, fig. 14, he entitled the metope Hellé sur le bélier, but described the figure as follows: ‘‘Au dessus du bélier, bras g. d’une femme, dont le poignet seul reste intact avec un bracelet, unique indication certaine du membre conservé et du sexe de la personne représentée. Du bras jusqu’a l’épaule, simple silhouette; en avant un bout de l’étoffe du corsage; au dessous, plus rien ne subsiste. “Tl semble qu’on doive restituer une figure de femme debout- assise sur l’animal elle sortirait de la métope—et de face, qui a saisi le bélier par le cou et le flatte ou le pare. Le torse est trés incliné vers sa g., comme celui d’Europe, pour éviter que la téte ne déborde les limites du cadre, tout en laissant au bélier une taille trés forte et plus que naturelle.” An examination of the fragment in 1913 suggested still another interpretation, which, so far as I know, has never been advanced in print. The “bracelet” on the “wrist” of the figure is actually the hem at the end of a short sleeve. It is carved in relief encircling the upper arm and continuing up towards the shoulder. The sleeve of the better preserved horseman on the Argo metope is treated in exactly the same way. The “bout de l’étoffe du corsage” falling on the back of the ram is manifestly the end of a short tunic similar to that worn by the same horseman. Above it traces of the belt are plainly to be seen. The only reasonable restoration is that of a male figure, Phrixus, bestriding the ram and leaning farther forward than does Europa on the bull. Compare the accompanying photograph, which I owe to the kindness of Professor Clarence Kennedy. The American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. X XIX (1925), No. 1. LW 18 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY outline of the lower part of the rider’s back appears more clearly in the illustrations published by Homolle. His leg seems from the traces to have been bent sharply at the knee. The elaborate, schematic rendering of the magical fleece is also well shown in the photograph. Four rows of large tufts are pre- served. Each tuft has horizontal chamferings; and alternate tufts in each row show in addition vertical striations. As Homolle has noted in his earlier and more detailed description, traces of red paint appear only on the more elaborately carved tufts. The simpler tufts were undoubtedly painted a dark color, probably black. This alternation of colors, which is paralleled on other poros sculptures as Figure 1. PuHrIxus ON THE RAM well as on vase paintings, must have contributed greatly to the decorative effect of the metope. THe Sure ARGO Among the smaller fragments from the metopes is one showing a portion of the side of a ship identical in every respect with the repre- sentation of the Argo (Fouzlles, IV, p. 30, fig. 15a). Yet, as Homolle has observed, there is no space for it in that metope. He assumes that it belonged to a second slab depicting a different episode in the - myth of the Argonauts. But another explanation of the fragment seems preferable, It is that the Argo was represented only once on the Treasury, but that it occupied two adjoining metopes. Aside from the existence of the small fragment, the chief argument in favor of this hypothesis is that only four of the participants in the adven- ture are shown on the extant relief, and that the leader of the expedi- — CASKEY: METOPES OF SICYONIAN TREASURY AT DELPHI 19 tion is not among them. Jason and other members of his crew were probably figured on the second slab representing the stern of the vessel. THE CALYDONIAN BoaR In his recently published Delphische Studien, p. 47, Dr. Poulsen assigns the metopes of the Treasury to two different sculptors. He finds that Europa, the Ram, the Argo and the Cattle-Raid are by one hand, while the Boar is by an artist of inferior merit. To this second artist he assigns also the “fragmentary relief with a horse.” But the only fragment of a horse so far connected with the metopes is that described by Homolle, Fouilles, IV, p. 30, fig. 15d. And its assign- ment to the horseman at the right-hand end of the Argo metope seems certainly correct. An archaic relief with a horse’s head is, indeed, exhibited in the Museum at Delphi on the same pedestal as the Sicyonian metopes. But it has nothing to do with them. Not only does it differ in style and technique, but its material is marble. In the circumstances it would seem that we may still subscribe to M. Homolle’s more favorable estimate of the boar, and assign all the metopes to the hand of one and the same admirable artist. L. D, Caskry Museum or FINE ARTS Boston American School of Classical Studies at Athens THE COLOSSUS OF BARLETTA THE great bronze statue in Barletta! (Fig. 1) long well known, was in 1912-138 the subject of an exhaustive publication by Koch.? In his examination he found that the legs, the right arm including the elbow, and the left arm below the fold of the paludamentum which crosses it, were restorations. Subsequently the right leg was removed, and that side of the body is supported by masonry; at least it was in October, 1923. In regard to the identification of the figure, Koch’s conclusions may be summarized briefly. 1. The old tradition assigning to it the name Heraclius must be genuine; it is to be explained by the usurpation, on the part of that emperor, of a statue made centuries before.* 2. The statue is not earlier than 324, since diadems of the kind worn by it then first appear on official monuments; and “ T'racht und Stil”’ require a date before Justinian.4 3. The man is about fifty years old. Through this fact a number of emperors of the fourth and fifth centuries are excluded from consideration, since they died too young or ascended the throne too old. There remain Magnentius, Valentinian I, Valens, and the two Theodosii.® 4. A study of the coins of these five emperors permits the identification as Valentinian I.® The statue had previously been identified as Theodosius I and as Valens, but not so confidently nor after so thorough a study. Delbriick accepts Koch’s conclusion, which I suppose may be re- garded as holding the field at present. But an examination of the numismatic evidence, as presented for example in Koch’s figure 9, must leave a good deal of doubt. It is probably true that Val- entinian is a better possibility than any other of the five emperors named above; but the very individual profile of the statue, with the deep depression at the root of the nose, the high, short nose, the long upper lip and remarkably long chin, is certainly not reproduced in any striking fashion on the coins.’ It is in fact by a process of elimination that Valentinian is reached. There is one factor, noted but afterward altogether ignored by 1 Bernoulli, Rémische Ikonographie, II, 3, pp. 257-259, pl. LVI; Arndt-Bruck- mann, Griechische und Rémische Portrdts, 895-898; Delbriick, Bildnisse Rémischer Kaiser, XL-XLII; Wulff, Altchristliche und Byzantinische Kunst, pp. 158f., pl.

This is the beard. Bernoulli thought that there was no beard, but Koch “ a Antike Denkindler Ficure 1. Tue Couossus oF BARLETTA. describes it correctly.!. It is represented by a slightly raised and roughened surface, substantially as in Roman portraits of the middle of the third century. The beard is divided from the smooth part of the face by a perfectly sharp line, and does not cover the 1Pp, 23. 22 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY whole cheek; thus the mustache is left almost separate from the beard proper. According to Koch it can be seen that the mustache is long and drooping: “ein lang herabhdngender Tartarenschnurrbart.” The arrangement of the beard is precisely that which appears on coins of Diocletian. Between Constantine and Phocas, the following emperors are represented on the coins as bearded: Vetranion, Julian, Procopius, Gratian, Magnus Maximus (?),! Eugenius, Honorius, John, Maximus (409-411), and Leo I. Of these Julian, Gratian, and Honorius certainly died too young to be considered in connection with the statue at Barletta: as to the ages of the others I have seen no exact statement but Vetranion seems to have been quite old; historical circumstances would exclude him in any case, as well as Maximus (409-411). John, Magnus Maximus, Procopius, and Eugenius all had short and troubled periods of power, and it is highly improbable that any of them had leisure for the erection of great monuments; moreover they are all in their coin portraits distinctly unlike the colossus. It may be noted also that John, Magnus Maximus, and Eugenius ruled only in the West; whereas according to the early tradition the statue came from Constantinople, and it surely would never have survived in Italy. Infact Valentinian was also a western emperor but the objection is not so serious in his case since the eastern ruler, Valens, was notoriously subservient to his brother who was buried in Constantinople. This process of elimination leaves Leo I as the only possibility between Constantine and Phocas. Leo was an eastern emperor who enjoyed a prosperous and fairly long reign. Portrait statues were made in court circles at the time; we hear of one representing the emperor’s physician Jacob.2, The age at which Leo ascended the throne, fifty-seven, is not impossible for the colossus, though fifty would seem more likely. Only a small minority of the coins show Leo bearded; four of these are reproduced in Figure 2.2 The four coins, all struck at Thessalonica, represent four dies, though the differences are slight. ‘They show a face in which the nose is rather short in comparison with the chin, somewhat as in the colossus; but there is no depression at the root of the nose. The beard is short and is pretty clearly represented as curling naturally, not as closely clipped; this is in accordance with Cedrenus,‘ who says that Leo was Uroaravos tiv yevecada. The beard of the colossus appears rather 1Cf. Bernoulli, op. cit. I, 3, p. 260. 2 Unger, Quellen d. Byz.

JOHNSON: THE COLOSSUS OF BARLETTA 23 to be a heavy growth closely clipped, though the treatment is so conventional that one cannot be certain. The portrait of Leo as we see it on these four coins, of good work- manship and in fairly good agreement with one another, is probably dependable. The coins which show the emperor beardless! have a great variety of inconsistent profiles, of which none resembles the colossus as much as the four specimens here reproduced. In these the resemblance is not close; yet the coins would not render im- possible an identification as Leo. There are other considerations. Leo was a soldier before he be- came emperor, but an obscure soldier, and as emperor he did not take part in any campaign. Hence a colossal armored statue of him must have appeared somewhat absurd. The colossus is not an ordinary statue: at whatever period it was made, it would rank as a grandiose military monument, such as could be set up only by a C Figure 2. Corns or Leo I. great warrior or by a poseur. Leo was neither; all that we know of him indicates that he was an unusually sensible and unassuming man, who would be most unlikely to make himself out a military hero. Since he was placed on the throne as a creature of the great Patrician Aspar and only gradually established his independence, it is particularly improbable that such a statue should have been set up near the beginning of his reign; yet the colossus can hardly represent a man much older than fifty-seven. For these reasons an identification as Leo is improbable, though he is not so thoroughly disqualified as Valentinian and all the others earlier than Phocas. Phocas was the last emperor before Heraclius. On the coins he usually has a pointed beard. Otherwise he could hardly be dis- tinguished from Heraclius so far as the coins are concerned. But no one, probably, would wish to reject the tradition if the possibilities are reduced to these two. The field within Koch’s limits being exhausted, it is in order to’ inquire whether his limits are justified. It will not be questioned’ that the figure is later than Constantine; but do “ Tracht und Stil” really necessitate a time prior to Justinian, or to Heraclius? Pass- 1 Through the courtesy of Mr. Oikonomos, I was able to examine the coins of Leo, as well as of other emperors, in the Numismatic Museum at Athens. Draw- ings in Sabatier, Monnaies Byzantines, I, pls. VI-VII. ; 24 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY ing for the present the question of style, it is a fact that the armor worn by the colossus, especially the solid metal cuirass, was not worn at the time of Heraclius.!| But an emperor might nevertheless be represented wearing it; it was the old heroic style. The classical Roman practice of portraying emperors nude, in imitation of Greek sculptural types, is analogous. Byzantine dependence on earlier models was, of course, great at all times; and the respect of Byzantine artists for Roman usage in figure sculpture would be especially great, since in this field they could learn nothing from the orient. A figure wearing the solid metal cuirass is found among the frescoes in the Metropolis church at Kalabaka, which belongs to the four- teenth century. It is safe to say that this example is not unique in Byzantine art. . As for the diadem, it has the same form in the colossus, on the coins of Valentinian, on the coins of Heraclius, and on the coins of all the intervening emperors; it occurs also in the mosaic portrait of Justinian in 8. Vitale at Ravenna. On the coins of Valentinian this kind of diadem is not however the most common one—only one of the five coins in Koch’s figure 9 has it—while in the coinage of Heraclius it is the regular form. On the coins of Tiberius II and his successors, including Heraclius, there is usually a cross on the front of the diadem. The cross sometimes rests on a projecting piece such as is present on the front of the diadem worn by the statue: an examination might show that the cross was originally present and has been broken away. But the point is not important, since the cross is not always present on the coins. The mode of wearing the diadem may be observed. In the coins of Valentinian and most of the other early emperors the diadem fits behind the ears, which are visible; while on the colossus the thick hair covers the ears, and the diadem is higher on the head. ‘This appears to be the case on certain profile coins of Heraclius;? and the thick hair which appears at the sides of the face in coins showing the front view would indicate a similar mode. The numismatic evidence as to the features of Heraclius * is most unsatisfactory; the coin-engravers of the time were obviously not concerned with iconographic accuracy in their designs. But it is clear that he wore a closely clipped beard with a separate mustache. In the coins which show the profile view, and in those only, he is beardless; this has led some authorities to see in them portraits of the emperor’s son Heraclius Constantinus. He would doubtless resemble his father somewhat. In some of the profile views‘ the 1 Dalton, op. cit. p. 684. 2K. g. Wroth, Imp. Byz. Coins in the British Museum, pl.

JOHNSON: THE COLOSSUS OF BARLETTA 20 nose is very short in proportion to the lower part of the face and the profile suggests the colossus as much as does the portrait on any coin. On other coins of Heraclius, however, quite different profiles appear. It is impossible, then, to identify the colossus as Heraclius on numismatic evidence; but this evidence affords no objection to the identification. Of course the objection that has always prevented serious consideration of Heraclius was based on the good and comparatively classical style of the statue. It was considered out of the question that the ‘“‘mumienartig”’ art of the seventh century could produce such a work.! This assumption was perhaps rea- sonable; but Delbriick, by his irrefragable identification of an excellent portrait of Justinian II,? has shown the necessity for a complete revision of the usual ideas about Byzantine sculpture. Justinian IT lived at the beginning of the eighth century, a hundred years later than Heraclius. The course of history during this period makes it practically impossible that the level of artistic skill in the empire should have been rising. It is therefore not only possible but virtually certain that the head of the colossus was not beyond the power of sculptors contemporary with Heraclius. The armored body would present a task of much less difficulty; it would require only competent craftsmanship and the imitation of earlier statues. Since Justinian II was a descendant of Heraclius, points of re- semblance between Justinian and the colossus are worth noting. In fact they have in common two distinctive features: a very short nose and eyebrows that slope upward, for most of their length in almost straight lines, from the inner ends. Of course no close resemblance between Heraclius and Justinian would be expected. In summary: the old tradition identifies the statue as Heraclius; it cannot well be any earlier emperor except Phocas and possibly Leo I; since Delbriick’s discovery, there is no reason for disbelieving the tradition. The dated coins of Heraclius first show a long beard in 629-630.° Hence the statue, showing him with a short beard, should be earlier. Since Heraclius was born about 575 and was hardly younger than fifty when the statue was made, 625 may be regarded as a terminus post quem, approximately at least. As Heraclius was engaged in the Persian war from 622 to 628, with brief intermissions, one would conclude that the statue was made in 628-629, as a memorial of the glorious conclusion of that conflict. This of course is exactly the time given by the tradition as embodied in the epigram of Grimaldi.‘ F. P. JOHNSON UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA 1 Bernoulli, op. cit. II, 3 p. 258. 2 Rom. Mitt.

I, 87 27 Before it is possible to show the bearing of this restoration on our knowledge of Athenian history of the fifth century, it will be neces- sary to determine, as accurately as possible, the location of the five towns involved. Heracleion cannot be identified with certainty. Trailus is probably identical with Tragilus, a town known to have been situated near the site of the later Philippi. Bormiscus was on the Strymonic gulf at the point where Lake Bolbe empties into the sea.! Mecyberna was at the head of the Toronaic gulf, on the site of the modern Molyvopyrgus.? Singus was on the western coast of the Singitic gulf between Pilorus and Sarte.® Gale has usually been placed on the Thracian coast, or slightly inland, north of Samothrace.t The Danish archaeologist, Dr. Kinch, was the first to identify Gale with the Galepsus of Herodotus (VII, 122) on the peninsula of Sithonia north of Torone.® And his conjecture is now confirmed by J.G. I, Suppl., p. 140-1 and /.G. I, 37 frg. z, which imply at least a geographical proximity between the three cities Singus, Mecyberna, and Gale. There was a town Galep- sus, a Thasian colony, on the coast of Thrace east of the mouth of the Strymon,® and this is the only Galepsus known to Thucydides. Also, the existence of the second Galepsus rests on the evidence of Herodotus alone. With the evidence of the assessment lists now at hand, it seems safe to say that the Galepsus of Herodotus was the Gale of the tribute lists, and that the T'adny.o of the tribute lists represent the people from Galepsus beyond the Strymon.’ It is impossible at once to conclude from the appearance of these names in the assessment list of 425/4 that they were in Athenian hands when the assessment was drawn up, for it is known that names of cities which never at any time paid tribute to the Athenian em- pire were included in that list. Such cities were Melos and the towns of the Euxine Sea.? Perhaps, then, Trailus, in the rich Pangaean region, was included in the assessment rather in the hope that it would be brought into the empire than because it was already subservient to Athens. 2 'Thuc.

It is certain that the Athenians controlled most of the coast of the Strymonic gulf. Acanthus, Stageirus, and Argilus had not as yet revolted, and in fact did not revolt before the arrival of Brasidas. Even the fickle Perdiccas of Macedon, who might have prevented the submission of Bormiscus to Athens, was at peace with Athens at the time of the assessment of 425 /4. As for Singus, Mecyberna, and Gale, there is direct evidence in the inscriptions themselves that they were under Athenian control when the assessment was made. Only in this way can the remarkably low assessment of ten drachmae each be explained. At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, when Potidaea revolted from Athens, along with Bottice and Chalcidice, the Chalcidians had dismantled their coast towns and united in Olynthus to make it a single strongly fortified city.! The policy of the Chalcidians at once indicates that they had no intention of trying to defend their coast from the Athenian fleet. The few inhabitants of the coast towns, therefore, who refused to go to Olynthus (perhaps mostly Athenian sympathiz- ers) were the only ones left to pay tribute to Athens after the synoe- cism at Olynthus had been effected. Singus, Mecyberna, and Gale were coast towns of Chalcidice, and the remarkably low assessments of ten drachmae each indicate the extent to which the population had been drawn away from the shore. Furthermore, the three towns in question, situated as they were on either side of the Sithonian peninsula and on the northern shore of the Toronaic gulf, represent practically the entire coast of Chalcidice proper, which extended from Mecyberna on the west around to Assera on the northern shore of the Singitic gulf. And the appear- ance of these three towns in J.G. I, 37, frg. z proves that early in the war the entire coast of Chalcidice, along with its towns, or remains of towns, had been recovered by the Athenians from the revolting Chalcidians.

Archaeological Justitute of America PEACE BETWEEN ATHENS AND BOTTICE By a comparison of the terms of the preserved Peace of Nicias, as given in Thucydides V, 18-19, with two inscriptions in which the small Bottic towns of Tripoae and Camacae are mentioned it is pos- sible to throw some light on the relations between Athens and Bot- tice during the closing years of the so-called Archidamian war. In the text of Thucydides, Spartolus is the only Bottic city men- tioned as hostile to Athens. In J.G. I, 260, Tripoae and Camacae are recorded as having paid tithes of AFFFII and A, respectively, to Athena. The names Tripoae and Camacae occur also in J.G. I, Suppl., p. 142, n. 52, 53=Ditt. Syll.2 I, 89. The first inscription is from the archonship of Aristion (421/0), and was published in the spring of the year 420. The latter inscription (Ditt. Syll.2 I, 89) - records a treaty of alliance made between the Athenians and the Bottiaeans, but its exact date is a matter of dispute. In it the names Tripoae and Camacae are spelled Tprroljai] and [Klewaxai, but there is no doubt about the restoration and the identity of the towns. This inscription is also conclusive proof that Tripoae and Camacae were Bottic towns, for they are listed as two of the Bottle cities which ratified the alliance with Athens. Busolt (Griechische Geschichte, III, 2, p. 1171) places the Bottic alliance in the year 422, and looks upon it as the direct result of the alliance between Athens and Perdiccas. Meyer (Geschichte des Altertums, IV, pp. 494 ff.) for orthographical reasons thinks that the inscription belongs after the year 420, and places it in the year 417. In the last edition of Dittenberger’s Sylloge the inscription is dated approximately in the year 420. And Beloch has placed it in the year 418/7 (Griechische Geschichte, II?, 1, p. 352, note 5).! Now, from the text of the treaty itself two things are apparent: (1) that not all the Bottic cities participated in the alliance, and (2) that Spartolus, the chief city of Bottice, was one of these cities which did not take part. Evidence for the former assumption lies in the phraseology of the document. The Athenian oath reads: auuva rois Borrialows rots EvyTiMeuevors Tas Ouodoyias, and in lines 21—25 there is the provision: ras 6€ EvvOnKkas. Tas wepl Tav orova@y KaTabeivar ’APnvaious bev €4 mode avaypawavras éoTHnAn ALBivy Kal Ta OvOMaTA THY TOEWY éyypawavras trav fuvTiewevwv Thy gidiav Kal THY fSvypaxiav. Concern- ing the second point noted above it is clear from the stone as 1 Jt is not necessary to quote the date for the Bottic alliance as given by West, ‘The Chalcidic League,’ Bull. of the Univ. of Wis., History Series, 1912, published 1918, p. 84, note 5. Dr. West is now fully in accord with the conclusion reached in this paper, that the peace was ratified in 422. . American Journal of Archarology, Vol. X XIX (1925), No. 1. 29 30 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY preserved that Spartolus did not head the list of cities which ratified the treaty. And as chief city of Bottice it was entitled to first mention, had it been party to the alliance (cf. comment in Ditten- berger). Meyer has assumed that there was no mention of tribute in the treaty. He says (l.c.) ‘Hin Theil der Landorte der Bottiaeer, aber nicht Spartolus, trat zu Athen zuriick und verpflichtete sich, es im Kriege zu unterstiitzen; von Tribut war nicht mehr die Rede.” To say that there was no longer any question of tribute is somewhat misleading. In J.G. I, 260 there is sufficient proof that the question of tribute, so far as concerned Tripoae and Camacae, was not only brought up for discussion but definitely settled. What is true of Tripoae and Camacae must also have been true for the other cities of the Bottic alliance. Furthermore, the question of the tribute could not have been settled before the negotiations of the Bottic alliance. From the treaty as it is preserved it is clear that the alliance ends a period of hostility between the Athenians and the Bottiaeans. The Bot- tiaeans swore to have the same enemies and friends as the Athenians, and both parties swore: ov pvnokaxjnow Tav taporxouerwy evexa (cf. Busolt, l.c.). Such an oath is meaningless if we assume that reconcilia- tion had proceeded far enough beforehand to include the settlement of the tribute question. The inscription as preserved comprises only the conclusion of the alliance, and it is by no means certain that the question of tribute did not form a considerable part of the body of the treaty. In fact, the very first word of the inscription, although the stone is so fragmentary that a restoration is impossible, seems to be concerned with some arrangement for the levying of — tribute.! The Bottiaeans had been hostile to the Athenians ever since the revolt of 432, and this treaty must be considered as the first made after the conclusion of hostilities. The fact that Tripoae and Camacae were parties to the alliance and that both of these names occur in J.G. I, 260 as actually paying tribute to Athens proves that the treaty was made at least before the spring of the year 421/0. The theories of Meyer and Beloch are automatically invalidated. With the help of Thucydides it is possible also to show that the treaty with Bottice must be dated earlier than the Peace of Nicias, and consequently that the date as suggested in Dittenberger cannot stand. We have seen that Spartolus was not included in the list of cities party to the alliance, and we learn from Thucydides V, 18, 5 that it was still hostile to Athens at the time of the Peace of Nicias. Also, it is the only Bottic city named as hostile to Athens at that time. 1 The word is raé]xoes. MERITT: PEACE BETWEEN ATHENS AND BOTTICE ol Assuming, then, that the Bottic alliance was made after the Peace of Nicias, we must also assume that cities party to the alliance were hostile to Athens at the time the Peace of Nicias was ratified. And yet there is no mention of these cities in the document of peace (Thue. V, 18-19). There is left only one alternative, to agree with Busolt that the peace with Bottice was made in the year 422 soon after the alliance with Perdiccas, and the determination of this date explains both the absence of Spartolus from the Bottic alliance and the absence of the towns of the Bottic alliance from Thucydides V, 18, 5. BENJAMIN D. MERITT Brown UNIVERSITY Archaeological Hustitute of America ATREUS AND AGAMEMNON THE discoveries by Emil Forrer ! of references in the Hittite records at Boghaz-keui to Troy and to a great kingdom of Achaia and its rulers from 1350 B.c. to 1225 B.c. are of the utmost value and interest to all Homeric scholars, It appears that in the time of the Hittite king Morsilis, B.c. 1837-1312, an Achaian king, whose name is interpreted as Eteokles, held Pamphylia in fee from the Hittite empire. His father was Antaravas=Andreus. In 1225 a king of Achaia, whose name is Attarsijas, which is recognized by Forrer as Atreus, is active about the southwest coast of Asia Minor, expelsthe king of Caria and is soon after expelled in turn from that land. With another chief—the two are called kuirvanas=kotpavo.— Attarsijas laid waste Cyprus in 1225. I have taken the account given above from the Historische Zeit- schrift, 1924, p. 343. So far as I know, it has not been noted that in the eleventh book of the Iliad the son of Atreus, who devastated Cyprus in 1225 B.c., received from Cinyras, king of Cyprus, a token of friendship and _ alliance—£¢ewjwv—which was a _ breastplate of splendid metal work, described, in twenty lines of the poem, JI. 11, 24 ff. It is highly significant that the king of the rich and powerful island sends a piece of armour and not soldiers to the son of Attarsijas. The word £fevmov is also significant and may perhaps be contrasted with the word 6&pa, used in Iliad 23, 297 of a gift made by another prince who shirked service at Troy, but sent a present of propitiation. This was Echepolus of Sicyon, son of Anchises, who sent a mare as a gift to Agamemnon, in order that he might not have to follow him to windy Troy. , The Cinyradae were for many centuries priest-kings in Cyprus. They were dedicated to the service of Aphrodite and their wealth was a proverb among the Greeks. Pindar writes (Nem. 8, 161 ff.) of the prosperity which once in Cyprus-of-the-Sea loaded Cinyras with riches, and of the love of gold-haired Apollo for the priest Cinyras, beloved (xridov) of Aphrodite (Pyth. 2, 16 ff.). A fragment of Theopompus states that the Greeks with Agamem- non came to Cyprus, got possession of the island and drove out Cinyras. Although Agamemnon in the eleventh book of the Iliad put on the beautiful gift of the Cyprian king, applauded by two goddesses, it may be that he cherished resentment against Cinyras for not appearing in person to fight under the walls of Troy. And political friendships and enmities have always been shifting things. 1 “Vorhomerische Griechen in den Keilschriefttexten von Boghazk6i”, Mitt. Or. —Ges. Nr. 63, March 1924. American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. X XIX (1925), No. 1. 32 MACURDY: ATREUS AND AGAMEMNON 30 Since the father, or predecessor, of Cinyras was attacked by the father of Agamemnon, it is quite according to the nature of warrior kings that after a short respite of friendship or acquiescence, marked by the sending of Cyprian metal work to the Achaian king, who was besieging an old friend of the Cyprians, the conqueror should turn against the rich island, always a spoil of war.
