The questions I raise in this book therefore have a particular resonance now (for better or worse), as we give thought to the ways in which, in a modern democracy, we can reconcile our desire to preserve freedom of speech while also protecting the dignity of all members of our society. I have many people and institutions to thank for their support as I was writing this book. I am particularly grateful to the following individuals for reading and giving feedback on various chapters: Konstantinos Kapparis, Sarah Levin-Richardson, David Mirhady, Robert Parker, Lauri Reitzammer, Lene Rubinstein, Stephen Todd, and the anonymous reviewers of this manuscript. Conversations with Naomi Campa, Bruce Frier, Cynthia Patterson, Jean Roberts, and Kate Topper helped elucidate certain points I was trying to argue, as did discussions in my graduate seminars at the University of Washington on invective in Attic oratory (fall 2011) and insults in classical Athens (fall 2017). All mistakes, however, are entirely my own. I did research for this book not only at the University of Washington but also as a Visiting Scholar at the American Academy in Rome (2014–15), as Simon Visiting Professor at the University of Manchester (November 2014), and as a Visiting Senior Associate Member at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens ix\n\nx\n\nz\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n(June 2015), and I am grateful for the resources and staff at all these institutions. I especially thank Kimberly Bowes and Sebastian Hierl (and the other library staff at the Arthur and Janet C. Ross Library) at the AAR, as well as James C. Wright and the library staff at the Blegen Library at the ASCSA. I have presented material related to this book and received helpful feedback from audiences at the following venues: a panel on insult, satire, and invective at the Society for Classical Studies meeting in Toronto (chaired by Cathy Keane); the University of Colorado, Boulder; Yale University; and Oberlin College. I am grateful for the permission to reproduce, in chapter 3, parts of my 2009 Scripta Classica Israelica article, “Servile Invective in Classical Athens.” I also thank Amber Rose Cederström and the editorial staff at the University of Wisconsin Press, who were a genuine pleasure to work with. Finally, I am grateful for the intellectual and emotional support of my colleagues and friends, especially Edith Aldridge, Radika Bhaskar, Ruby Blondell, Tamara Chin, Stephanie Clare, Leslie Kurke, Peter Liddel, Laurie Marhoefer, Kate Topper, my beloved Lunch Circle (especially Curtis Dozier and Lauri Reitzammer), and my truly fantastic colleagues in the Classics Department at the University of Washington. I am, as always, incredibly lucky to have the loving support of my family, including my mother, Helene Kamen, and the entire Levin-Richardson-WeinfeldVasquez clan; I dedicate this book to my brother and father, both of whom I lost while writing it. And I could not have written this book without the love and encouragement of my partner, wife, and colleague, Sarah Levin-Richardson, who makes every part of my life a delight.\n\nConventions and Abbreviations\n\nI transliterate Greek words following the conventions of the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th ed., table 11.4 (2017), except when Latinized versions of names or places are more familiar.

Athenian Constitution\n\nInsults in Classical Athens\n\nIntroduction\n\n[The practice of] insult can be seen as at once “antisocial” and constitutive of social relations. That is, there is a “benign” side to insults as well as a “malign” side. Thomas Conley, Toward a Rhetoric of Insult\n\nI\n\nnsults may take the form of disrespectful words or actions, but they are not equally damaging to their targets, and sometimes they are not damaging at all. In fact, if we consider the diversity of things we consider “insults”— affectionate teasing, raised middle fingers, celebrity roasts, schoolyard bullying, even a president’s tweets—we quickly realize the variety of effects an insult can have. In ancient Greece, too, insults ranged from playful mockery to serious affronts, taking the form of obscene banter at festivals, satire on the comic stage, invective in the courtroom and the assembly, forbidden slanderous speech, and violent attacks on other people’s honor. 3\n\n4\n\nz\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn investigating the cultural practice of Greek insults, I focus in this book on classical Athens during the years 451/50–323 bce, the period and location from which we get the bulk of our evidence.1 But democratic Athens was also in many ways an unusual polis, one that prided itself on the (notional) equality of its citizens, who were believed to be autochthonous (i.e., “born from the soil” or indigenous) while also being home to a remarkably diverse noncitizen population that included many slaves and resident foreigners.2 This unique combination of factors appears to have led to a preoccupation with affirming and reaffirming Athenian civic ideology, in particular with defining who was and who was not truly a citizen.3 This was carried out through periodic crackdowns on the citizen rolls and lawsuits that prosecuted those suspected of being counterfeit citizens but also in less legalistic ways, such as by praising those who conformed to citizen ideals and insulting those who did not. Whereas some occasions and contexts called for praise (we might think, e.g., of funeral orations and honorary decrees), others called for its opposite (e.g., the comic stage), and still others a combination of the two (e.g., the courts).4 Insults in this way formed an important part of Athenian discourse about citizenship, with insults and praise representing the flip sides of an ideological coin.5 This book, designed as an introduction to Athenian insults, is original in two key respects: it pulls together work on insults in a variety of (often siloed) fields (e.g., Greek religion, comedy, law), and it maps out, for the very first time, the terrain of insults in Athens. In addition to providing a broad overview, this book makes three main contributions. First, I uncover some of the rules that governed Athenian insults, exploring the relationship between the contexts in which they were issued and their degree of (perceived) offensiveness.6 Second, I examine the content of these insults, thereby illuminating not only the traits and behaviors the Athenians considered fodder for denigration but also, by contrast, what they considered worthy of praise. And third, I show that insults served a number of functions and had a variety of consequences in Athenian society, from bonding together individuals and communities to deeply dividing individuals from one another and from the city as a whole.\n\nIntroduction\n\nz\n\n5\n\nApproaching Insults\n\nIt is important to contextualize this project within other scholarship on Greek insults and insults more broadly. For many years, sociologists, anthropologists, and linguists, among others, have explored various facets of insults. In addition to considering insults within particular communities or societies, scholarship has also looked at insults from a cross-cultural perspective. In fact, in the past decade or so, there has been a virtual flurry of books on the topic. Jerome Neu’s Sticks and Stones (2008) explores from a philosophical perspective the nature, purpose, and effects of insults; Thomas Conley’s Toward a Rhetoric of Insult (2010) seeks to understand which sorts of insults are universal and why; and William Irvine’s A Slap in the Face (2013) explores what makes insults hurt and suggests embracing Stoicism as a way of defending ourselves from their harm. In what follows, I survey some of the most important questions and topics that have been of interest to nonclassicists working on insults before turning to work specifically within the field of classics. “Benign Insults”\n\nOne such topic, alluded to already, is the degree to which insults can be more or less offensive, depending on their context, content, and other variables.7 That is, a scale of insults from benign to malign is present in most societies, including (I argue) classical Athens. Among the best-studied benign insults are so-called ritual insults. These insults, found in a number of societies, are bound by rules that make them acceptable within the context in which they are performed.8 Often they are poetic, though they do not have to be. A well-known poetic insult tradition (found, for example, in Old Norse literature) is “flyting,” a term that classical scholars have borrowed to describe the ritual exchange of insults in Homer.9 The exchange of poetic insults is still practiced today, from rap battles to Cretan mandinadhes, in which one person (usually a man) issues a rhyming or assonant couplet to an interlocutor who tries to one-up the insult with another couplet.10\n\n6\n\nz\n\nIntroduction\n\nProbably the most famous example of contemporary ritual insults is “the dozens,” also known as “sounding” or “signifying,” among other names.11 In this practice, African American boys (less often girls) bandy insults back and forth at each other. These insults are usually drawn from a repertoire of memorized, often but not always rhyming, lines, and typically they target the other boy’s mother (or sometimes grandmother). A boy “wins” by having the best repertoire of insults, that is, ones that garner the greatest admiration from the other boys. It is important to note that these insults generate joy and laughter among the boys and are not generally taken as offensive (though they do always have the potential to tip over into offensiveness).12 Thus, while superficially antagonistic, the dozens are in fact (generally) friendly, allowing for bonding within the group and providing the boys an extended rite of passage into manhood.13 A similar ritual can be found in the traditional dueling rhymes of Turkish boys. These insults most often center on the idea of one boy penetrating another, although, as in the dozens, sometimes the other boy’s mother (or sister) is also disparaged.14 Some ritual insults, in turn, focus on girls becoming women. For example, Zulu girls sing “puberty songs” on the days before two of the most important ceremonies of their young lives: the umhlonyane ceremony (which marks the first menstruation) and the umemulo (which marks their coming-of-age). These songs, full of scatological and ribald language and often attacking particular young men, teach girls about sex while also marking their rite of passage into womanhood.15 Related are ritual insults performed at weddings, which we find in various cultures.16 For example, xaxaar, abusive poetry sung by a designated speechmaker at weddings in a Wolof village in Senegal, insults the bride as well as other community members. It has been suggested that this ritual abuse not only integrates the bride into her new husband’s family but also provides the community a socially acceptable forum for gossip.17 As I show in this book, mockery in classical Athens, particularly mockery embedded in rituals, could likewise be beneficial both to individuals and to society at large.\n\nIntroduction\n\nz\n\n7\n\nRegulating Insults\n\nMost insults are not benign, and at the far end of the insult spectrum are insults deemed grave enough to fall under the jurisdiction of the law.18 For instance, if an insult is both false and intended to harm someone’s reputation, it is considered defamation. In most jurisdictions, defamation is called slander if it is orally delivered, libel if it is written.19 Today defamation is generally considered a civil offense, but in the past it could also be a criminal offense.20 A brief survey of defamation in a few societies can give us a glimpse into how different kinds of insults have historically been regulated. In early Icelandic law, níð (an insult imputing unmanliness) was generally punished with “lesser outlawry,” whereas níð using specific offensive words was punished with “full outlawry.”21 In early seventeenth-century France, where slander law was loosely based on Roman law, serious offenses like faux (false or calumnious accusations) and any defamation threatening the public order (e.g., defaming a sovereign or God) fell under the jurisdiction of the criminal courts, whereas less serious verbal abuse (called injure) was generally tried in civil courts, less frequently in the ecclesiastical courts.22 In the first half of the nineteenth century in England, too, different types of defamation were tried in different courts. Libel was generally prosecuted as a civil offense but could also be tried as a criminal offense. Slander was usually not actionable, but it could be tried as a civil offense if one could prove damages (that is, loss of money) or that the words used either imputed a serious crime, disparaged the plaintiff’s trade or profession, or attributed to him a “loathsome disease.”23 Cases pertaining specifically to sexual slander were mixed criminal/civil suits and were heard by ecclesiastical courts.24 In Athens, too, certain actionable insults—not necessarily false ones—were subject to private lawsuits (dikai ), whereas others were deemed sufficiently insulting, either to the individual or to the city, to warrant more serious public suits ( graphai ). Insults in the form of “fighting words” and “hate speech” are also regulated in some jurisdictions. In the United States, for\n\n8\n\nz\n\nIntroduction\n\nexample, fighting words, that is, words that incite violence, are considered an exception to citizens’ right of free speech and do not count as protected speech.25 Moreover, in many jurisdictions outside the US, hate speech—that is, attacks on a person or group on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on—can be prosecuted by law.26 A debate rages today about whether hate speech should in fact be legally regulated. Jeremy Waldron, for example, argues that it should be, since it undermines the public good of inclusiveness and assaults the dignity of vulnerable members of society.27 Others, like Judith Butler, assert that hate speech should not be regulated, in part because there is no way to predict the effect of a given hateful utterance, regardless of its speaker’s intent.28 Instead of regulation, Butler proposes that hate speech be transformed through reappropriation. David Archard also argues that insults (including hate speech)—even if they are morally reprehensible—should not be regulated, since (he says) they don’t necessarily cause offense and don’t actually subvert their victims’ equal status.29 Athenians would not have been unfamiliar with the issues underlying this debate. Although they did not have a concept of hate speech per se, they did restrict insults that put citizens’ legal standing or the polis as a whole at risk. That is, despite the importance of parrh¯esia (freedom of speech) in democratic Athens, certain insults were nonetheless banned in order to protect the fundamental dignity and rights of its citizens—not to mention the ideology of an egalitarian society. Content and Effects of Insults\n\nScholars have illuminated the many forms that insults can take, not only their mode or vehicle of delivery but also the range of content they express.30 Two points are particularly worthy of note here. For one, it has been amply shown that different cultures and insult traditions have different weapons in their arsenals, reflecting the ways in which insults can be culturally specific. At the same time, however, scholars have demonstrated that some insults are nearly universal.31 For example, we find in many cultures insults that compare people unfavorably to animals.32\n\nIntroduction\n\nz\n\n9\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, another popular topic of insults is sex, targeting (among other things) abnormal or dirty genitals, incest, illegitimacy, homosexuality, and adultery.33 Particular sexual insults, of course, can vary quite a bit from culture to culture, depending on their sexual and other norms.34 As with all insults, then, the insults discussed in this book—including gender and sexual deviance but also foreign/low status and cowardice— likewise reflect a combination of universal values and those specific to Athenian culture.35 Another fruitful topic explored by scholars outside of classics is the functions and effects of insults on both an individual and a community level. Although there are of course significant exceptions (e.g., benign insults), insults in general make people feel bad and, especially when delivered publicly, serve as an affront to their dignity.36 Insults also perform a variety of social and cultural functions for communities, many of which overlap. So, for instance, insults can police group boundaries by distinguishing insiders from outsiders and ensure conformity to (and thus naturalize) a group’s values and norms in addition to constructing and reinforcing hierarchies within a group.37 They can also serve as a safety valve, a way of releasing anxiety or warding off more serious aggression, although of course they can also do the opposite: namely, incite a conflict.38 Insults performed as part of a ritual or otherwise in the spirit of joking can do some of the same work as less benign insults, but they also have the potential to solidify bonds of affection within the group, to integrate someone new into a community (e.g., a bride into a new household), and to facilitate rites of passage (officially or unofficially), especially for adolescents.39 Insults in classical Athens had a similarly broad range of consequences. Insults in Ancient Greece\n\nWith this comparative material in mind, let us turn now to work that has been done on insults specifically in the ancient world. It should be pointed out from the outset that there is no one word for insults in Greek. Instead, what we find is a rich vocabulary of\n\n10\n\nz\n\nIntroduction\n\nterms that refer in various (and sometimes overlapping) ways to mockery, insults, and abuse. These include, among many others, sk¯ommata (“jests, jibes”), aischrologia (“shameful speech”), loidorein (“to denigrate”), blasph¯emein (“to defame”), k¯om¯oidein (“to satirize”), diabol¯e (“denigration, defamation”), kak¯egoria (“speaking ill”), and hubris (“deliberate affront to another’s honor”). While for the sake of convenience I render each of these Greek terms with one or two translations in English, these terms are difficult to pin down not only in English but even in Greek: their precise meanings are negotiable, depending on how a given Greek speaker or author chooses to use them. Moreover, while most of these words refer to verbal insults, insults were not necessarily verbal: a slap in the face is a classic example of a physical insult, and in Greece it was a particularly offensive one. The most comprehensive work on ancient insults is Severin Koster’s Die Invektive in der griechischen und römischen Literatur (1980). As the title of this book indicates, it focuses on Greek and Roman literary invective, which Koster defines as the public denigration of a known individual in light of contemporary norms and values.40 While the bulk of classical scholarship on invective since Koster has focused on the Roman side, some work within the past decade or so has explored facets of Greek insults and invective.41 For instance, in Making Mockery: The Poetics of Ancient Satire (2007), Ralph Rosen theorizes a poetics of Greek and Roman satire, which he shows applies to poets from Homer to Juvenal. Fundamental, he argues, is the fictional status of poetic mockery, which distinguishes it from real-life mockery and the (harmful) effects the latter can have. In Abusive Mouths in Classical Athens (2008), Nancy Worman investigates abusive language in Greek literature, particularly in classical Athens. Focusing on insults directed at the mouth and its associated activities (i.e., eating, drinking, sex, talking), she demonstrates that oral imagery and its appetitive connotations are central to Athenian invective. Andrea Rotstein’s The Idea of Iambos (2010), in turn, offers a thorough account of the difficult-to-categorize genre of iambos (iambic poetry), arguing (among other things) that invective and abuse play an increasingly important role in iambos over time. While all\n\nIntroduction\n\nz\n\n11\n\nof this work represents excellent scholarship, its emphasis is on invective as a literary genre or trope more so than on insults in daily life.42 It is the latter topic that I focus on in this book, though there are obviously overlaps between “literary” and “real-world” insults: we might think, for example, of insults in comedy and oratory. Other work in classics has touched more directly on some of the issues this book addresses, including, variously, the context, content, and effects of everyday insults. For instance, Monica Ressel and Jan Bremmer, in separate articles, both emphasize the importance of context—when and where an insult is delivered, by whom, and against whom—in determining the effects and degree of severity of Greek insults.43 Work has also been done on the content of these insults. Early on, Wilhelm Süss categorized the topoi of Greek insults, focusing on tropes he found in Attic oratory. His list included the following: (1) allegations that the father of one’s opponent or one’s opponent himself is (or was) a slave; (2) allegations that the opponent’s origins are non-Greek; (3) allegations that the opponent’s occupation is lowly (teaching, banking); (4) allegations that the opponent is a thief; (5) allegations that the opponent has engaged in sexual improprieties; (6) allegations that the opponent is a traitor to his friends (misophilos) and (relatedly) a traitor to his city (misopolis); (7) allegations that the opponent is sullen; (8) the calling of attention to the peculiarities of the opponent’s dress, demeanor, or appearance; (9) allegations that the opponent has thrown away his shield or otherwise displayed cowardice in battle; (10) allegations that the opponent has wasted his estate.44 Scholars have since adapted Süss’ list of tropes and applied it to a variety of authors and genres, and related work has cataloged and analyzed the specific “dirty words” (Schimpfwörter) used in Greek and Latin literature.45 In this book, I have chosen not to discuss all the tropes and insult words in classical Athens but instead to focus on those deployed most frequently. Other scholarship has explored some of the effects of Athenian insults. For example, Virginia Hunter, in her book Policing Athens (1994), has illuminated the role of gossip—and invective in the\n\n12\n\nz\n\nIntroduction\n\ncourtroom—as a mode of social control in Athens, a way of enforcing citizens’ adherence to society’s norms.46 Chris Carey, in turn, has explored in a couple of articles some of the functions and effects of insults delivered on the Greek comic stage and in the courts.47 Other works not explicitly dedicated to the topic of insults can nonetheless help shape our understanding of insults’ effects. For example, Stephen Halliwell’s monumental Greek Laughter: A Study of Cultural Psychology from Homer to Early Christianity (2008) explores, in a very broad-ranging survey, the causes and results of laughter among the Greeks. Among other things, Halliwell draws an important distinction between playful and consequential laughter, that is, laughter that is taken lightly as opposed to laughter that has serious ramifications for those involved.48 This essential contrast between types of laughter dovetails in various ways with the difference between benign versus malign insults in classical Athens. “Maudire et mal dire: paroles menaçantes en Grèce ancienne” (2014), a special issue of Cahiers “Mondes anciens” edited by Vincent Azoulay and Aurélie Damet, explores, in turn, the tension between the fundamental role of “threatening words” in the functioning of the Greek city and the potential for such words to lead to civil strife. I likewise argue that insults in classical Athens had the potential to be both playful and consequential, both constructive and destructive for the polis. Building on all these useful studies, then, I draw together in this book the strands of context, content, and effects in order to construct a fuller picture of how insults operated in Athenian daily life. Insults and Honor\n\nAlso pertinent to our discussion is the important role of honor (tim¯e ) and shame (aid¯os) in classical Athens.49 As Halliwell points out, “The laughter of denigration and scorn”—and of course denigration itself—“is a powerful means of conveying dishonour and of damaging the status inherent in reputation.”50 Work on the topic of honor in Athens was sparked, at least in part, by Jean Peristiany’s edited volume Honour and Shame: The Values of\n\nIntroduction\n\nz\n\n13\n\nMediterranean Society (1966), which argued that Mediterranean face-to-face societies (past and present) share a value system based on honor and shame. While some classicists have taken issue with this premise, it has nonetheless proved greatly influential, particularly on the work on David Cohen.51 According to Cohen, because honor was so important in classical Athens and was often gained at another’s expense, competition (especially among elites) was not only inevitable but often led to violence.52 Litigation, Cohen argues further, was an extension of this feuding over honor that took place outside the courts.53 A diametrically opposed perspective to Cohen’s is found in the work of Gabriel Herman. Pointing to the Athenian ideal of self-restraint in the face of conflicts (including affronts to one’s honor), Herman contends that Athens was not a violent or feuding society and, as a corollary, that the courts were not an agonistic venue for competition over honor.54 The idea of the Athenian courtroom as a site for contestation over honor (i.e., “the ag¯on model”) has also been called into question by those who point out that it fails to take into account the differences between public and private suits or the reality of team-based litigation, which necessarily complicate a picture of a zero-sum competition over honor between two individuals.55 Other scholars have staked out a middle ground between the views of Herman and Cohen. Finding Herman too optimistic about the peacefulness of the Athenians and Cohen too pessimistic about the potential for courts to curb feuding behavior, Matthew Christ argues that while Athenians did compete over honor, the courts could in turn foster cooperation and civility.56 Nick Fisher also thinks (like Cohen and Christ) that honor-driven violence played a role in Athenian society, but he argues that this violence was curtailed, at least somewhat, by Athenians’ desire to reconcile citizens’ honor with the ideals of self-restraint and conflict resolution.57 More recently, Andrew Alwine has argued that Athens was in fact an agonistic society (if not a feuding one), but one that was committed to curbing excessive enmity through legal means.58 By focusing specifically on the role that insults played in society, I confirm this “middle ground” picture of Athens. That is,\n\n14\n\nz\n\nIntroduction\n\nI take the position that Athenians frequently used insults (among other forms of violence) to negotiate status hierarchies and contests over honor but regulated any insults (both legally and extralegally) that were deemed overly damaging either to an individual’s honor or to his legal standing. I also complicate this picture by showing that although most insults did in fact have dishonor as their goal, this was not the case with all insults (we might think, most obviously, of benign insults), and not all insults were dishonoring to the same degree. The Shape of this Book\n\nThis book proceeds through five categories of insults, each representing in turn a type that was considered more offensive or otherwise damaging. Each chapter is titled with the most common word or words for that type of insult, but as might be expected, there is no perfect one-to-one correspondence between Greek vocabulary and each of the categories I lay out. In addition, some of these terms were used for rhetorical or satirical effect to refer to insults of other types or levels of offensiveness. (We might compare the following scenario: if someone utters a small falsehood about you, you might cry, “That’s slander!”—even if the legal bar for slander is far from being met.) Thus, although the reality is of course much messier than a neat schema can capture, I hope that my categorization of insults by type proves broadly useful. The first three chapters of this book discuss what we might call “socially acceptable insults,” insults that were permitted by both societal norms and the laws of the city. Some of these insults were more benign than others, with the less benign having potentially serious effects for their targets. I begin in chapter 1 with benign insults delivered as part of rituals (both religious and social). Mockery in these contexts, assuming it didn’t turn offensive, had almost entirely positive effects, serving to bond together either the entire polis (including men and women, old and young, and sometimes also foreigners and slaves) or subgroups within the polis (e.g., free women, elite men). Next, in chapter 2, I turn\n\nIntroduction\n\nz\n\n15\n\nto insults on the comic stage, which also united members of the polis, here in their capacity as viewing audience. Comic insults, however, were slightly more consequential than ritual ones, in that they had the power to figuratively “ostracize” individuals whose behaviors deviated from social or political norms. The third chapter looks at insults in Athenian oratory, where invective was employed by speakers in order to persuade jurors (or fellow assembly members) to vote a particular way. The shortterm goal of these insults was to secure the speaker’s desired outcome (e.g., conviction), but the effects could be longer lasting (and sometimes extremely negative) for the target. In the final two chapters, I turn to two types of “forbidden insults,” that is, insults that were condemned by society and actionable under the law. In chapter 4, I explore forbidden verbal insults—insults that were actionable based on either their content or their context— arguing that these insults were banned primarily because they unfairly threatened the standing of their victims. Finally, chapter 5 looks at hubris, the most offensive type of insult in classical Athens. Hubris was not only forbidden but prosecutable with a public lawsuit ( graph¯e), attesting to the degree to which it was considered a crime not only against the victim (and his honor) but against the polis as a whole.\n\nThis book is not meant to be a catalog of every type of insult that existed in classical Athens, or every context in which insults were leveled, or every effect insults might have had. However, even if this study is not comprehensive, it should nonetheless provide a valuable overview of the range of Athenian insults, including the reasons certain insults were considered more harmful than others, what the content of insults can tell us about Athenian civic values, and what effects insults had on individuals and society at large. Ultimately, it also demonstrates the key role played by insults and abuse in drawing lines between insiders and outsiders and shaping what it meant to be a citizen in democratic Athens.\n\n1 Skōmmata and Aischrologia Benign Insults\n\nN\n\not all expressions using insulting language or gestures are meant to be, or are taken as, truly insulting. That is, some insults, while they might appear antagonistic, are generally not taken seriously, in part because of the contexts in which they’re issued.1 This chapter explores such “noninsulting insults” in classical Athens, what we might also call “joking” or “benign” insults.2 These insults not only did not pose a threat to the honor or status of their target but in fact benefited interpersonal relationships and society more broadly. Possibly falling in this category are some of the insults bandied about on a daily basis in the Athenian agora.3 For instance, literature frequently alludes to insults leveled by marketplace vendors, especially female ones (e.g., Ar. Ran. 857–59).4 We also find evidence for mockery in the agora in the form of graffiti, a number of which are sexual in nature.5 What is difficult to ascertain, however, is how often these insults were in fact benign: after all, at least some of them were clearly intended to challenge\n\n16\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n17\n\nthe standing of others. We might think, for example, of Demos­ the­nes’ description of his opponent Aristogeiton “mak[ing] his way through the marketplace like a snake or a scorpion with sting erect, darting here and there, on the lookout for someone on whom he can call down disaster or irreverent speech [blas­ph¯e­ mian] or mischief of some sort” (25.52).6 Paul Millett has described the agora as a stage on which Athenians negotiated status differences, and I would imagine that insults at least sometimes played a role in this process—in which case they were very much not benign.7 Clearer evidence for benign insults comes from Athenian rituals and “ritual-like activities.”8 Such activities—from the festivals associated with Demeter and Dionysos to all-male drinking parties (symposia)—were considered “safe spaces” where the (controlled) airing of abusive language was not only permitted but actively encouraged, since it served in various ways to solidify bonds within a given community. The most basic word in Greek for such mockery is sk¯ommata (“jests, jibes”), related to the verb sk¯optein (“to mock”). These words do not only refer to insults embedded in various rituals, however, but have broader application; they are also used to describe mockery on the comic stage (see chapter 2). Insults that are part of festivals are generally referred to as aischrologia, a word that literally means “shameful speech,” the defining feature being obscenity rather than insult (although aischrologia is usually insulting as well).9 Other words used to designate ritual mockery but that also appear in other insult contexts include aporrh¯¯eta (“forbidden speech”), loidorein (“to denigrate”), blasph¯¯emein (“to defame” and sometimes “to blaspheme”), (the aforementioned) sk¯optein (“to mock”), and t¯othasmos (“teasing”).10 Unfortunately, we do not know much about the content of ritual obscenity, since none of it survives, but most scholars assume that it included coarse words related to sex or scatology.11 In what follows, I examine the nature and role of mockery in ritual and ritual-like practices and in Athenian society more broadly. By gathering together all the evidence, we can arrive at a better sense for at least one category of benign insults in classical Athens.\n\n18\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nMockery at Demeter Festivals Demeter and Iambe\n\nReferences to aischrologia in Demeter’s cult are scattered throughout ancient literature.12 The mythic prototype for this ritual abuse is the story of Iambe, who mocked Demeter to cheer her up after her daughter Persephone was abducted by Hades.13 The Homeric Hymn to Demeter tells us that Demeter was mourning until “Iambe, with jests [chleu¯eis], true-hearted, intervening with lots of mockery [parask¯optous’], moved the holy mistress to smile, laugh, and have a gracious heart” (203–5). Due to the elevated register of epic, the specific words used by Iambe are unfortunately not spelled out, but the terminology used (chleu¯eis, para­sk¯optous’) suggests that Iambe was playfully insulting Demeter.14 And given what we know about mockery in cult practice more generally, these insults were likely sexual in nature.15 The sexual nature of the insults is also suggested by alternate versions of the myth, which relate that Baubo (Iambe’s mythic double of sorts) cheered up Demeter by revealing her genitalia to the goddess.16 In fact, this is only one of many instances of ritual insult being paired with visual obscenities.17 Scholars disagree, however, about which ritual practice this story is an explanation myth (aition) for: that is, does it explain mockery at the Eleusinian Mysteries or at the Thesmophoria?18 Our ancient sources are unfortunately not of much help on this question, since they’re not only postclassical but appear to contradict one another. Thus, a scholiast on Aristophanes’ Wealth says that “the women of the Athenians, going to the Mysteries on wagons, denigrated [eloidorounto] each other, and these abuses [hubreis] were called out from the wagon. And they abused [hubri­ zon] each other because when Demeter came to Eleusis looking for Kore and coming very sadly, Iambe the servant of Keleos and Metaneira, hitting her with abuses [hubresi], made her smile and share in the nourishment, which was kuke¯on, or boiled watery and loose wheatmeal” (1013). According to this commentator, the story of Iambe provides an explanation for the phenomenon of women mocking each other at the Eleusinian Mysteries. Our\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n19\n\nonly other source on this question is Pseudo-Apollodoros’ Bibliotheca (of uncertain date, but likely first or second ce), which says: “Some women were in the house, and when they bade [Demeter] to sit beside them, a certain old crone, Iambe, mocking [sk¯opsasa] the goddess, made her smile. For this reason they say that the women mock [sk¯optein] at the Thesmophoria [en tois thesmopho­ ri­ois]” (1.5.1). This passage, then, clearly suggests that the Iambe story is an aition for the ritual abuse at the Thesmophoria.19 So, which is it? Kevin Clinton has argued that the story is in fact an aition for the Thesmophoria, drawing not only on the PseudoApollodoros passage but also on the fact that the Thesmophoria is an older and more widespread festival than the Eleusinian Mysteries and on the fact that whereas mocking represents only a small part of the Eleusinian Mysteries (namely, at the gephurismos), it constitutes a central part of the Thesmophoria.20 However, given how little definitive evidence we have (and how convincingly it has been read for one festival or another) and given that mockery seems to figure in a large number of Dem­ eter festivals (not just the Eleusinian Mysteries and the Thesmo­ pho­ria), it seems to me safest to assume that the Greeks considered the myth an aition for any and all mockery related to Demeter.21 With this hypothesis in mind, let us turn to our evidence for ritual insults performed in various Athenian festivals devoted to Demeter. In what follows I attempt to ascertain what these insults might have looked like and what functions they may have served. Eleusinian Mysteries\n\nOne of these rituals, of course, was the Eleusinian Mysteries, which was relatively unique in that it was open to everyone in Greece, including not only Athenian men and women but also visitors, resident foreigners (metics), and slaves, provided that they were interested in being initiated into the mysteries (which secured them the promise of a blessed afterlife). 22 The festival took place every year from the fifteenth to the twentieth of the month of Boedromion (September/October), culminating on the fifth day with a procession from Athens to Eleusis (about fourteen\n\n20\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nmiles west of Athens) and ultimately the revelation at Eleusis of secret hiera (sacred objects), which capped off the participants’ initiation into the mysteries. Most significantly for our purposes, part of the procession involved a ritual called the gephurismos, in which a figure (or figures), present on or near a bridge over the Kephisos River, leveled insults at those who crossed the river.23 The grammarian Hesychius (s.v. gephuris) asserts that this figure, called a gephuris, was a female prostitute ( porn¯e), but he also reports that others say that it was a man, not a woman, who sat on the bridge veiled and made mockery (sk¯ommata) of the prominent citizens (endoxous politas) who passed by.24 Jeffrey Rusten has suggested that the reason the Greeks employed a prostitute—or at least a person (whether male or female) playing a prostitute—was to guarantee “nudity or sexual humor of some sort.”25 In fact, Aristophanes might be alluding to this practice when, in his Wasps, he has the old man Philokleon say to a flute girl/prostitute: “As quickly as possible, stand holding these torches, so that I can tease [t¯othas¯o] [my son Bdelykleon] vigorously, in the way he did me before the mysteries” (1360–63). Although the flute girl does not speak (let alone issue insults!), some scholars have nonetheless taken this scene as an allusion to the gephurismos.26 We have no way of knowing whether father-son mockery like that between Phi­ lokleon and Bdelykleon was a conventional part of the Eleu­ sinian mysteries, but it is certainly possible.27 Women may also have insulted one another: even if we do not take seriously the scholiast on Aristophanes’ Wealth, it is plausible that a festival in honor of Demeter might have involved the exchange of mockery among women, given the strong connection between Iambe and Demeter. Sadly, we do not have any recorded insults from the Eleu­ sinian Mysteries, but we might be able to derive something of their substance from the parodos of Aristophanes’ Frogs (316–459). This is a literary representation, and a parodic one at that, so it’s clearly not meant to be identical to real jesting at the mysteries.28 Among other ways in which it clearly differs from reality, the individuals being mocked in this scene are not on stage, whereas\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n21\n\nthe ritual practice appears to target individuals who were present. Nonetheless, if we approach this scene with caution, I think it has potential to shed some light on the practice of gephurismos. In the parodos, we first get promises from the chorus of the jesting to come (episk¯opt¯on kai paiz¯on kai chleuaz¯on [374b–75]) and “playing and mocking” (paisanta kai sk¯opsanta) that is “worthy of Demeter’s festival” (393–94)—followed by the aischrologia itself. Would you like us then, all together, / to make fun of Arche­ demos? / At seven years old he still had no guild-teeth [phrast¯e­ res], / but now he’s a politician / up among the dead men, / and he’s number one for villainy in those parts. / And I hear that Kleis­thenes’ arsehole / was in the cemetery, / plucking and tearing at its cheeks; / and he was bending over and beating his head, / and weeping and howling / for Phukos of Dikeleia, whoever he actually is. / And they say, too, that Kallias, / the son of Hippopenis, / was banging beaver [literally, fighting a naval battle with cunt] dressed in a lion-skin. (416–30)29\n\nAs was likely the case in real Eleusinian Mysteries insults, the jesting here includes a number of different targets of mockery. Though the individuals named are for the most part prominent Athenians, there is no reason to think that the targets at the real gephurismos had to be especially prominent (despite what Hesych­ ius says).30 That is, the inclusion of famous targets here may simply be in keeping with Old Comedy’s tendency to mock those who were already in the spotlight (see further ch. 2). If, however, they were not especially well-known people, we have to imagine that the mockery was often based not on insider knowledge of their flaws but on easily identifiable features of the individuals walking by (“Shorty!” “Fatty!” “Baldy!”).31 Also worth noting are the types of insults we find in this passage. Behind the joke that Archedemos did not have his phrast¯e­ res (“teeth that tell one’s age,” with a pun on phrateres, “phratry [=clan] members”) by the age of seven is the insinuation that he was not of genuine citizen stock—or else he would have been introduced to his father’s phratry by this point—and therefore\n\n22\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nthat he must have attained citizenship by some illicit means.32 Kleisthenes, in turn, is said to grieve like a woman and also, in unmanly fashion, to depilate his buttocks.33 Stooped over (egkeku­ ph¯os), as if about to be penetrated, he grieves over a Sabinos of Anaphustios, translated by Alan Sommerstein as Phukos of Di­ keleia because of the bin- (“fuck”) root of Sabinos’ name and the suggestions of anaphlan (“to get an erection”) in his deme’s name.34 Kenneth Dover points out that it is doubly problematic that a grieving person would be thinking of sodomy at this time and that someone old enough to have hairy buttocks would still be penetrated.35 Finally, not only is Kallias’ father’s name sexualized (“Hip­popenis”), but he himself is portrayed as a degraded Herakles, whose victories are restricted to the realm of sex. 36 Whether the “naval battle” is a figurative one (a “battle of love”) or a literal one, Kallias is clearly being mocked for his excessive woman­izing (which in turns reflects a lack of self-control). All the insults, then, have to do either with foreign origins or sexual/ gender deviance, which are (unsurprisingly) conventional topics of mockery in Old Comedy (see ch. 2). However, it is certainly conceivable these same topics may have been fodder for ritual abuse as well. Sexual invective was particularly likely if the individual hurling insults was either a prostitute or someone posing as one. Having reviewed our evidence for ritual insults at the gephurismos, we can now ask what functions this mockery might have served.37 It has been suggested, for example, that the levity of the gephurismos provided a contrast to the hard road ahead, namely crossing a mountain to reach Eleusis.38 That is, the comic relief offered by the mocking would have bolstered the participants’ spirits, fortifying them before they had to continue their difficult trek. A complementary explanation is that these insults were (in a sense) a form of hazing, a way of welcoming the participants into a new state of being as initiates into the Eleusinian Mysteries.39 Either way, the insults were clearly designed to bond together the participants in this cult as they embarked on their initiation. In this context, their shared identity as initiates overrode (at least temporarily) any differences between them in status or gender.\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n23\n\nWomen’s Festivals of Demeter\n\nA number of other Demeter festivals were restricted to women only.40 One such festival was the Stenia, which in Athens fell on the ninth of Pyanepsion (October/November), a couple of days before the Thesmophoria. Most of what little we know about this festival comes (again) from late grammarians.41 Hesychius (s.v. Stenia) says that the women at the Stenia “mock [diask¯optousi] and denigrate [loidorousi]” and glosses st¯eni¯osai (“perform the Stenia”) with blasph¯em¯esai and loidor¯esai. Photius (s.v. Stenia) adds that the Stenia is “a festival at Athens, in which the ascent of Demeter seemed to happen. And the women mocked [eloido­ rounto] each other at it during the night, as [the Middle Comic poet] Euboulos says.” In this festival, then, ritual insults clearly took the form of women mocking other women; more than that we cannot say with confidence. We might speculate, however, that it bore some resemblance to the scene in the Ekklesiazousai where an old woman and a younger one each explains why it’s better to sleep with an old or young woman, respectively, and in the process repeatedly insults the other woman about her lack of sex appeal (893–923).42 Following shortly after the Stenia was the Thesmophoria, an agricultural festival probably open (in Athens at least) only to married citizen women.43 It was observed throughout Greece in the fall, and in Athens it fell on the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth of Pyanepsion.44 The first day was called the “road up” (anodos), the second the day of “fasting” (n¯esteia), and the third “fine birth” (kalligeneia). The Roman-era astronomer Cleomedes attests to aischrologia at this festival, comparing the philosopher Epicurus’ vulgar speech to (among other things) “the things said in brothels” and “the things said at the rites of Demeter by the women performing the Thesmophoria” (2.1.499–500).45 Obscenity apparently took many different forms at the Thesmophoria, one of which was mockery, as attested by Pseudo-Apollodoros.46 It is unclear which day or days of the festival were devoted to mockery: scholars have proposed both of the nonfasting days (since it would have been difficult to joke around while fasting) as well as the fasting day itself (as mockery could have served as\n\n24\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\na way of marking the end of the fast).47 Also unclear is who was being mocked. While neither Pseudo-Apollodoros nor any of our sources is explicit about the object of the women’s mockery, many scholars assume that they mocked the other women at the festival (thus forming a parallel to Iambe and Demeter).48 If so, this would of course have been light-hearted sk¯ommata rather than genuine abuse.49 Perhaps complementing their (mock) abuse of one another is the attested practice of women at the Thes­ mophoria playfully whipping each other with something called a morotton, a scourge made of bark (Hesych. s.v. morotton).50 It has also been suggested that women expressed hostility toward their (absent) husbands, perhaps even denigrating the sexual inadequacies of men in general.51 In any case, it should be noted that because the festival was likely celebrated at many locations throughout Attica, each ritual group would have consisted of women from a handful of neighboring demes, thus fostering a greater sense of intimacy than a larger-scale festival.52 Yet another women’s festival featuring mockery, this one in honor of both Demeter and Dionysos, was the Haloa, celebrated in Eleusis on the twenty-sixth of Poseideon (December/January).53 It was apparently open to all women, both citizen and noncitizen, since we hear of courtesans (hetairai) attending (e.g., [Dem.] 59.116). A scholiast on Lucian’s Dialogues of the Courtesans relates a lengthy description of this festival. On this [day], there is also a certain women’s ritual conducted at Eleusis and many playful [paidiai ] and mocking things [sk¯ommata] are uttered. And women, processing there alone, were able to say what they wished with license. And in fact they say the most shameful things [aischista] to each other, and the priestesses, being present secretly, plot with the women adulterous acts, [whispering] in their ears as if it were something unspeakable [aporrh¯eton]. And all the women call out to each other shameful [aischra] and undignified things, holding up unbecoming male and female shapes of the body. (280 Rabe)\n\nInsults, then, formed one part of a larger ritual of sexual obscenity, which included, among other things, images of genitalia\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n25\n\nfashioned out of dough. Sexual knowledge, including secrets about illicit sexual activity, was also thought to have been shared among the female participants. We get another glimpse of insults at the Haloa from Alci­ phron’s fictional letter between two courtesans, Thaïs and Thettale (4.6), that likely dates to the second century ce. Thaïs tells her friend that recently, during the all-night portion of the Haloa, another courtesan, Euxippe, was giggling and ridiculing (m¯ok¯omen¯e) her (4.6.3). Thaïs says that she didn’t mind the teasing until Eu­ xippe, “casting aside all shame,” mocked (esk¯opten) her about her appearance (4.6.4). Thaïs claims, however, that she is going to get even with her rivals not by mockery (sk¯ommasin) or insults (blas­ph¯emiais) but in a way that will hurt them the most (malista ania­sontai) (4.6.5). We have no way of knowing whether Euxippe’s insults—which are primarily about sexual attractiveness—were characteristic of the Haloa, but I would suggest that this particular exchange is likely more hostile than the (usually benign) mockery at rituals. Clearly Thaïs thinks Euxippe has gone too far.54 Ritual mockery, then, served a variety of purposes at the allfemale festivals of Demeter. A conventional interpretation of the aischrologia at these festivals—which includes but is not limited to mockery—is that it was thought to rouse the goddess to promote fertility, both agricultural and human; this is in keeping with a (functionalist) argument about the purpose of these festivals in general.55 By this interpretation, women, through their obscene and abusive language (alongside other rituals), ensured a productive harvest of crops and children on behalf of the city. However, even if this was the case, it does not mean that all the participants necessarily believed in the “magical” power of ritual mockery. They might have, of course, but they might also have considered the connection between aischrologia and fertility a symbolic one, seeing insults as a festive accompaniment to their celebration more than as an agent effecting real change.56 Ritual mockery (again, alongside other rituals) at these allfemale festivals was also an important form of community bonding, a way to build and strengthen bonds between the women of Athens. In some cases (e.g., the Thesmophoria), this might have\n\n26\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nentailed defining the community of female Athenian citizens; in others (e.g., the Haloa), it might have entailed leveling out differences between women of various social statuses and fostering a collective identity among them.57 A complementary function of aischrologia at these festivals may have been a sort of female empowerment.58 Through their (mostly sexual) banter, women could both celebrate their power as reproductive agents and share sexual knowledge with one another.59 Relatedly, these ritual insults might have been a way for women to resist (men’s) rules about how they should behave in public and perhaps also a means to work through their (otherwise mostly suppressed) hostility toward (or at least gripes about) the other sex.60 Mockery “from Wagons”\n\nRitual mockery also played a large role, albeit a slightly different one, in Dionysiac rituals. As with insults in Demeter rituals, much of what we know about ritual mockery involving Dionysos comes from (late) scholiasts and lexicographers, who use the verbs loidorein and sk¯optein to speak of jesting “from wagon(s)” (ex hamax¯es or hamax¯on) during a procession ( pompeia or pom­ peuein).61 Whether these insults were extemporaneous or not is unclear.62 By some accounts (e.g., schol. Dem. 18.40b, 19.479, 19.504a), the jesters wore masks ( pros¯opeia).63 Elsewhere (schol. Ar. Nub. 296) we are told that they smeared wine lees on their faces to conceal their identities. Given that the jester(s) at the gephurismos may also have been masked, it is possible that one purpose of these disguises—in addition to hiding the jester’s face—was to mark the mockery as obviously “festive” and therefore benign.64 It was, after all, meant to be inoffensive. Indeed, despite the fact that Plato is not generally keen on ritual mockery, he has his Athenian Stranger say that the ritual abuse at the Dionysia is to be approved when it is done with restraint (Leg. 637a–b). Truly insulting behavior was strictly forbidden: for example, when a man named Ktesikles struck one of his personal enemies with a whip during a Dionysiac procession, the jury\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n27\n\nconvicted him on a charge of hubris (i.e., a violent insult against another’s honor; see further ch. 5) (Dem. 21.180). It is difficult to determine whether there were any rules about who could (and could not) mock from the wagons and who could (and could not) be mocked. For example, did young men at Dionysiac festivals engage in the mockery of their elders, as they might have done before the Eleusinian Mysteries?65 We know that slaves took part in the Dionysiac festival called the Choes (at least at the level of household feasts), and metics may have participated in Dionysiac processions: is it possible that either of these groups engaged in the mockery portions of these rituals?66 We have no way of knowing for certain, but Dionysius of Halicarnassus compares Roman soldiers’ mockery of “the most distinguished men, including even the generals” in triumphs to the Athenian practice of mockery epi t¯on hamax¯on (Ant. Rom. 7.72.11). If Dionysius’ analogy is accurate, it might suggest that status reversal (at least of some sort) was an accepted, perhaps even expected, feature of Dionysiac mockery at Athens. There is also some debate about which festival or festivals of Dionysos featured this mockery from wagons. Most scholars follow the sources that assert that the ritual took place during the Choes, the second day of the Anthesteria, a festival marking the opening of vessels of the previous fall’s vintage and held on the eleventh to the thirteenth of Anthesterion (February/March).67 According to other scholiasts (and modern scholars who follow these scholiasts), this ritual abuse was instead practiced at the Lenaia, a dramatic festival like the City Dionysia (but much smaller), held on the twelfth of Gamelion (January/February).68 Still others maintain that it was practiced at both the Anthesteria and the Lenaia, with the ritual at the Lenaia arising later.69 A couple of sources even report, as we have seen, that the wagon ritual was performed by women on their way to the Eleusinian Mysteries, but this is probably due to confusion with the gephurismos.70 Further ancient sources report that mockery from wagons took place “at Dionusia,” a phrase that could refer either to the City Dionysia or to any Dionysiac festival.71 The City or Great Dionysia, celebrated the ninth to the thirteenth of Elaphebolion\n\n28\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\n(March/April), was a large urban festival during which dramatic and other contests were put on and where a procession is known to have taken place. Eric Csapo argues that the City Dionysia is the most likely venue for mockery from wagons. First, he notes that our earliest attestation of this practice, the passage from Plato’s Laws, refers “unambiguously” to the City Dionysia. Second, he contends that scholiasts’ attributions of the ritual to other festivals besides the City Dionysia (e.g., the Anthesteria and Lenaia) are based entirely on their (mis)readings of a couple of ancient commentators.72 Moreover, he asserts, we have very little evidence that either the Anthesteria or the Lenaia had a parade or wagons from which ritual abuse would have taken place, whereas we do have independent evidence for the use of wagons at the City Dionysia.73 However, given the ambiguity of our evidence, as well as the pervasiveness of mockery in many different Greek rituals, I think it is at least possible that mockery featured in various Dionysiac festivals, whether or not wagons were involved.74 In fact, the practice of insulting from wagons was sufficiently widespread for it to be used metaphorically of (nonritual) mockery. One of our best examples comes from Demosthenes’ speech On the Crown. Early on, Demosthenes says that if the jury so desires, he will respond to the pompeia of his opponent Aeschines (18.11). Later in the speech, he says to Aeschines: “And then you raise your voice, as if from a wagon [h¯osper ex hamax¯es], calling me sayable and unsayable names [rh¯eta kai arrh¯eta] suitable for you and your kindred, but not for me” (18.122). Then, after explaining the difference between loidoria (denigration) and kat¯e­goria (accusation), he says, “Aeschines has a keener taste for denigration [pompeuein] than for accusation [kat¯egorein]” (18.124). Scholiasts helpfully explain that pompeia and pompeuein in this context are to be taken as synonyms for “denigration” (loidoria and loidorein) and that the simile “h¯osper ex hamax¯es” derives from the ritual practice of Dionysiac jesting.75 Mockery from wagons in Dionysiac rituals likely served a number of social functions. Given that these insults, issued from on high, were relatively easy to hear, one might imagine that public shaming was part of their aim.76 In fact, we hear from\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n29\n\nthe Suda that one function of a (superficially) similar ritual in Alexandria—where the insults issued from wagons had to be true!—was to deter other people from behaving like the insults’ targets.77 In Athens, by contrast, I would imagine that the Dio­ nysiac context ensured that the insults delivered from wagons were more playful, perhaps because they were obviously untrue. However, even if individual targets were not truly humiliated (as they were in Alexandria), it is possible that regulation of social behavior was nonetheless one aim of this ritual. That is, by publicly calling out actions they considered worthy of mockery, Athenians implicitly discouraged the performance of such behavior. Other functions of mockery from the wagons may have had to do with ameliorating social tensions, both within the polis and within the household. If any status reversals between slave and master, young and old, poor and rich, and so forth happened— admittedly, a big if—they may have served a couple of different functions: on the one hand, they may have facilitated a leveling and unification of Athenian society, rendering all inhabitants of Attica temporarily equal; on the other, they may have offered an opportunity for lower-ranking members of society to insult their superiors, thus allowing them to experience a reversal of roles and to vent (in a socially sanctioned way) whatever anger they may have felt at their subordination. 78 While these aims may seem contradictory, they both would have had the effect of upending normal hierarchies in the service of something more equitable. Benign Insults at the Symposium\n\nClosely related to these cult practices are some of the insulting jokes delivered at symposia, drinking parties for (generally elite) citizen men—and their female entertainment (hetairai, flute girls, etc.)—under the supervision of Dionysos.79 We might even think of symposia as a private counterpart to public rituals. In fact, Ezio Pellizer describes the symposium as a microuniverse of city festivals: “As such, it establishes a series of ritual acts regulated by a very precise set of norms, which range from libation to\n\n30\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\npurification and to prayers directed to various specific deities, and from the consumption (regulated by appropriate restrictions) of wine and other foods to the performing of or the listening to songs or instrumental music, to watching dances and mimes, and finally to contests between the actual participants in the gathering, or at least some of them.”80 The symposium was also, in Jan Bremmer’s words, “the place par excellence for insulting.”81 A late fourth-century bce anonymous elegy gives a sense of its characteristic mockery. Hail, fellow drinkers, (age-mates?). Fine was my beginning and fine will be the end of my discourse. Whenever we friends gather for such an activity, we ought [chr¯e] to laugh [ gelan] and play around [paizein], behaving properly [chr¯esamenous aret¯ei], take pleasure in being together, make jokes [phluarein] against one another [es all¯elous], and utter mockery [sk¯optein] such as to arouse laughter [ gel¯ota]. (Eleg. Alex. Adesp. fr. 27W)\n\nWe see here a broad range of vocabulary used of humorous “playing around” ( gelan, paizein, phluarein, sk¯optein), indicating that these insults were clearly designed to provoke laughter and pleasure among the symposiasts. But it is also important to note that the mockery described in this poem is both explicitly authorized by (chr¯e) and constrained by (chr¯esamenous aret¯ei ) its context, and it is in this way that its benign qualities were fostered.82 Unlike at public festivals, however, where insults were a required part of the ritual, mockery at the symposium was never mandatory. Nonetheless, Marek W˛ecowski has argued that insults did play a central role and speaks of the symposiasts’ “ritualized acts of humiliation.”83 At least ideally, these insults were characterized by eutrapelia (“wittiness”), which Aristotle describes as “educated hubris” (Rh. 2.12.16, 1389b11–12): that is, mockery “cultivated” to give the impression of hubris, while in fact being inoffensive and even pleasurable to its listeners.84 This is not to say, however, that everyone enjoyed the mockery of their fellow symposiasts, nor that some insults didn’t devolve into true hubris, especially after a number of drinks had been consumed.85\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n31\n\nSympotic mockery could take various forms. Sometimes it was part of the competitive games played at the symposium, as attested in (admittedly exaggerated) examples from Old Comedy.86 A riddle, for example, could potentially have an insult as its answer.87 We also find mockery in the capping games played at symposium, where one player would try to one-up the previous player.88 Inherently competitive, capping is not necessarily a form of mockery, but it could be. Take, for instance, the skolion game, in which one player sang a line and the next player had to continue the song or reply to it in a clever way.89 In the Wasps, Bdelykleon teaches his father Philokleon how to engage in sympotic skolia, explicitly warning him not to let his rejoinders become too offensive (1222–49).90 By implication, we can gather that skolia in general might involve playful mockery between the two players, mockery that should ideally not tip over into genuine insults. The eikasmos game, where players tried to match each other’s comparisons, could also devolve into an insult battle. 91 So, for example, Philokleon, said by his slave Xanthias to be the “most abusive by far” (hubristotatos makr¯oi, 1303) of the guests at a symposium, engages in a game of eikasmos involving the trading of (relatively benign) insults.92 A man named Lysistratos compares (¯eikasen) Philokleon to a “nouveau riche teenager or an ass that’s slipped away to a bran pile” (1308–10), to which Philokleon responds by comparing (ant¯eikas’) Lysistratos to a locust that has lost the wings off its cloak or the tragedian Sthenelos shorn of stage props (1311–13). After one guest refuses to applaud at Phi­ lokleon’s comparison, Philokleon proceeds to abuse ( periubri­ zen) him and then the other guests, one after another, mocking (sk¯opt¯on) them “in a rustic way [agroik¯os]” (1319–20). Clearly, part of what makes this funny is that Philokleon lacks the sophistication to follow the rules of decorum required of the symposium. Even so, this passage reveals that a simple game of eikasmos could potentially turn nasty, as the words hubristotatos and periubrizein connote the serious insult of hubris. Symposiasts not only mocked each other in formal games of this sort but also during their regular conversation.93 So, for example, in Xenophon’s Symposium, the Syracusan, upset because\n\n32\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nthe symposiasts were enjoying each other’s company but ignoring him, spitefully ( phthon¯on) eggs on Socrates about his reputation (6.6). He does so in an ad hoc way, not as part of a game. Nonetheless, the other guests respond to the Syracusan by turning his behavior into the topic of an eikasmos game. A man named Antisthenes says to another guest: “You’re awfully good at making comparisons [eikaz¯on], Philippos; wouldn’t you say our friend here”—namely the Syracusan—“resembles someone bent on trading insults [loidoreisthai]?” (6.8). Other ad hoc or ad hominem insults can be found in Machon’s Chreiai, preserved in Athenaeus’ Deipnosophistai (second or third century ce). Although these are of course highly stylized, they nonetheless give us a glimpse into the kind of insults that might be found at a symposium, as well as one of their uses: namely, to defuse sexual tension. A motif we see a handful of times is a man issuing an insult at a courtesan, who replies by capping his insult with a witty rejoinder.94 Of course, we have no idea whether courtesans were involved in the mockery of real symposia, but if they were, their participation would have been in keeping with the involvement of prostitutes (or people posing as prostitutes) in public festivals. In one episode in Machon, a foreign military deserter visits Athens. Trying to impress the others at a symposium he is attending and wanting to strike at (epikrousai) the he­ taira Mania, he asks the men which wild animal runs fastest in the mountains. Mania wittily replies, “A deserter.” She then mocks (esk¯opte) him further and calls him a shield caster (ripsa­spin) (579b–c), a particularly harsh insult. In another instance, a playwright named Diphilos is drinking at the house of the courtesan Gnathaena. After he tries to insult her by saying that her “vessel” (aggeion) is “cold,” Gnathaena replies that it’s cold only because some of his plays had been put in it (579e).95 That is, she matches Diphilos’ word play, repurposing the word “cold”—used by him of her sexual frigidity—to refer insultingly to his tedious style.96 It should be noted that while most insults delivered at symposia were given and taken in good fun, there was always the potential for feelings to be hurt.97 Derek Collins, drawing on scholarship on the dozens, argues that sympotic mockery turned\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n33\n\noffensive either when the content was too close to the truth or when the victim chose to take the insult personally.98 Plutarch, in his Table Talk, details what determines the offensiveness of sympotic insults: in addition to truth value, other factors include the timing, the particular content of the insult, and the composition of the audience (Mor. 631c–34f). In any event, once egos were bruised, mockery could lead to harsher insults and even physical violence.99 We see this kind of progression, for example, in the Wasps, when Philokleon, upon feeling insulted, verbally abuses and begins hitting the other guests at the symposium (1322–23). Interestingly, while Athenians seem not to have had an official mechanism in place for preventing light-hearted mockery from turning abusive, Spartans apparently did. Plutarch tells us that in Sparta, boys at public mess halls (sussitia) “became accustomed to play around [paizein] and mock [sk¯optein] without scurrility [b¯omolochias], and to endure mockery [sk¯optoumenoi] without displeasure [duscherainein]. Indeed, it seems to have been especially characteristic of a Spartan to endure mockery [sk¯ommatos]; but if anyone could not bear up under it, he had only to ask it, and the mocker [sk¯opt¯on] ceased” (Lyc. 12.4). In these various ways, then, the Spartans proactively warded off the insulting force of mockery, whether it was at a banquet or elsewhere.100 Insults at symposia, like insults at festivals, served a number of social purposes. When conducted properly, sympotic mockery was extremely pleasurable, certainly for the other symposiasts but also sometimes for the person mocked.101 Because of the joy it brought, Monica Ressel argues convincingly that one function of sympotic mockery was relaxation: safely among their friends, elite Greek men—who in their normal lives faced intense competition in a number of venues—could in a sense recapture their youth, a time of their lives when insults were (at least notionally) playful.102 Mockery at symposia was also a way for individuals to vent their thoughts and feelings in a controlled, “unreal” setting comparable to a festival, without the high stakes and potentially damaging consequences of everyday life.103 For the sympotic group as a whole, mockery had a number of further benefits. Insults could aid in the cohesion of the group’s members through laughter (though of course insults could also have the\n\n34\n\nz\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nunintended effect of splintering the group), tying individual members to one another while also reaffirming (as did the symposium as a whole) the shared elite status of the group’s participants.104 Functions of Benign Insults\n\nNow that we’ve reviewed the evidence for different kinds of benign insults, we can better speculate about the various functions of this mockery in Athenian society. Mockery at festivals, for example, seems to have been performed at least in part to please the gods. That is, the insults of Demeter’s worshippers were meant to cheer her up, just as Iambe’s insults did. And just like Demeter, Dionysos too was believed to take pleasure in the mockery performed at his festivals (Luc. Pisc. 25; schol. Luc. Iupp. trag. 44b Rabe). Some scholars have argued that festival mockery was also apotropaic, warding off the evil eye, but this explanation has become less popular in recent years.105 Insults at festivals also had a number of social functions. By allowing for the airing of otherwise taboo (or at least socially inappropriate) language— and perhaps even, in some cases, permitting women to insult men, young people to insult old, and possibly metics to insult citizens and slaves to insult free people—mockery at festivals had the power to invert normal societal conventions and status hierarchies, particularly if prominent individuals were targeted. In this way, mockery at festivals clearly had a carnivalesque dimension, granting its users a temporary release from the constraints of daily life.106 At the same time, the benign insults leveled at both festivals and symposia provided a means of bonding between members of a given community, who, through their shared laughter (and sometimes reciprocal mockery), could implicitly or explicitly pit their common values against those of one of a number of “others.” This sort of community bonding could transpire either on the level of the entire polis or on the level of a subgroup of the polis (e.g., only women, only men, only citizens, only elites, only the initiates of a given cult). Finally, benign insults also served the purpose of lifting the spirits of, and empowering (in different ways), both men and women.\n\nSkōmmata and Aischrologia\n\nz\n\n35\n\nAll these functions were facilitated by the fact that mockery in these contexts was understood not to be offensive. There were a couple of reasons for this. In the case of festivals, especially Demeter festivals, the mockery was by its nature mimetic: all participants were aware that they were in a sense re-creating an original moment of mockery (e.g., Iambe mocking Demeter) and so were cognizant that any insults uttered during the ritual were not a part of the reality of the here and now.107 In both sympotic and festival contexts, mockery was further marked as inoffensive by the form it took. Although (as we’ve seen) we have little information about what specifically this mockery looked like, the few clues we have suggest that it was probably fairly stylized (rather than ad hoc taunts), and beyond that it was likely not excessively harsh (or, for that matter, true). Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, the fact that these insults were embedded in and constrained by the bounds of a ritual (or ritual-like) practice made clear to the participants how they were to be taken. 108 That is, anyone attending the Thesmophoria or the City Dionysia or even a symposium would have arrived with a certain set of conventions in mind and would thus have “read” any mockery he or she encountered accordingly and not taken offense. There would always have been people like Philokleon who broke the rules (intentionally or otherwise), issuing insults that crossed the line from benign to offensive, but transgressions like his only throw into relief how friendly, and how regulated, this mockery normally was.\n\n2 Kōmōidein and Skōptein Mockery in Old Comedy\n\nG\n\niven the role of insults in (at least some) Athenian rituals, it is perhaps easy to see why two Dionysiac festivals—the City Dionysia and the Lenaia—were the venues for the performance of Old Comedy. After all, Old Comedy was a genre characterized by insults, generally referred to in Greek with words related to k¯om¯oidein (“to satirize”) or sk¯optein (“to mock”), and sometimes loidorein (“to denigrate”).1 K¯om¯oidein is used primarily of satire on the comic stage, whereas sk¯optein, as we have seen, can also be used of ritual insults, its sense ranging from light-hearted joking to more serious derision.2 Loidorein, in turn, refers more specifically to public insults, including those on the comic stage, but most commonly it is used (pejoratively) of oratorical invective. The rules for comic mockery were slightly different from what we find in ritual practice and accordingly, its potential to offend was likewise different. In this chapter I explore who could be insulted in Old Comedy, the types of insults that were most commonly leveled, and the (occasionally negative) responses to 36\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nz\n\n37\n\nsuch insults. I end by briefly discussing the functions that comic insults may have served in Athenian society more broadly. Ultimately, I argue that insults on the comic stage, as in ritual practice, bonded together members of the polis, here in the form of a theatergoing audience representing the demos. Unlike ritual insults, however, comic mockery also aimed to call out prominent individuals whose behaviors deviated from social norms and potentially threatened civic order and possibly even to remove them from the city. Insults in Old Comedy vs. Ritual Insults\n\nThe similarities between ritual mockery and Old Comedy are robust, leading many scholars to argue that the latter may have derived from the former.3 Whether or not this suggestion is correct, the two genres are clearly interconnected. For example, as Stephen Halliwell points out, Old Comedy was performed during festivals that featured ritual mockery; at least some Greeks believed that Old Comedy derived from ritual practices featuring phalluses; Old Comedy, like ritual joking, contained aischrolo­ gia and personal mockery; and there are even echoes and adaptations of ritual elements in Old Comedy.4 Moreover, as Ralph Rosen notes, insults in ritual mockery and on the comic stage share the important trait of being mimetic performances, that is, representations of insults rather than real-life insults. Both, he says, are “symbolic enactments of, but qualitatively different from, a lived, social experience.”5 I agree and would argue that this is in part what leads to their relative harmlessness to their targets, at least in general. Ritual mockery and comic insults were also different in significant ways, however. In ritual, individuals insulted one another in a generally ad hoc way, whereas in comedy, characters issued scripted insults at other characters, at real-life figures, and (less often) at the audience itself. In addition, although both ritual and comic mockery are representational in nature, Rosen argues that the nature of the mimesis is very different in the two contexts: in ritual, the mockery is a mimesis of an imagined original\n\n38\n\nz\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nmoment of mockery (e.g., Iambe making Demeter laugh), unrelated to (and quite distant from) the temporal reality of ritual practice; in comedy, on the other hand, the mockery is a mimesis of hypothetical real-life mockery and therefore much closer to the here and now.6 What this meant was that, even though the audience members of Old Comedy generally took any and all insults in good fun, the uneasy proximity to reality could sometimes lead to more serious effects for the mockery’s targets. Limitations on the Use of Comic Mockery\n\nMoreover, unlike in ritual mockery, where all participants were apparently fair game for insults, there seems to have been an understanding that normal people who minded their own business would not be fodder for comic mockery. Instead, comic playwrights would target either prominent people or average folks who behaved in obviously inappropriate ways.7 As PseudoXenophon says, “if anyone [i.e., any comic playwright] wants to attack private persons, they bid him do so, knowing perfectly well that the person satirized in comedy [k¯om¯oidoumenos] does not, for the most part, come from the populace and mass of people but is a person of either wealth, high birth, or influence. Some few poor and plebeian types are indeed satirized in comedy [k¯o­ m¯oidountai] but only if they have been meddling in others’ affairs and trying to rise above their class, so that the people feel no vexation at seeing such persons satirized in comedy [k¯om¯oi­dou­me­ nous]” (Ath. Pol. 2.18). This philosophy of selecting targets meshes well with what Aristophanes has the chorus leader in the Wasps say about himself: “When [Aristophanes] first began to produce [the Knights], he says, he didn’t attack ordinary people, but in the very spirit of Herakles he came to grips [epicheirein] with the greatest ones” (1029–30)—that is, politicians like Kleon, whom he describes in detail as a terrifying monster (teras) (1031–37).8 Of the real-life figures targeted for insult in Old Comedy, particularly singled out are demagogues like Kleon, Kleonymos, and Hyperbolos.9 These men were all so-called new politicians, a class of political figures who arose in the fifth century and whose\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nz\n\n39\n\nwealth came not from farming (a noble occupation) but from industry.10 Aristophanes claimed to be the inventor of the “demagogue comedy” (see, e.g., Av. 546–50), in which the entire plot is devoted to a particular demagogue, but he seems to have written only one such play: namely, the Knights, produced in 424 bce, which targeted Kleon.11 Although a number of other comic playwrights followed suit, the comedian Plato is unique both for writing more than one demagogue comedy and for not disguising the names of his targets, authoring plays called Peisandros, Kleophon, and Hyperbolos, among others.12 Hyperbolos, who was ostracized in 415 bce, was a particularly frequent target of comedians’ mockery: Plutarch says that Hyperbolos “afforded all the comic poets, without any exception, constant material for jokes in their plays” (Alc. 13.3). Indeed, the chorus leader in the Clouds sings that “from the moment Hyperbolos lowered his guard, they have been stomping the wretch without letup, and his mother too.” First Eupolis in his play Marikas did and then Hermippos in Breadsellers, “and now all the others are launching into Hyperbolos” (Nub. 551–59). Despite the fact that free speech ( parrh¯esia) was, according to many scholars, generally the rule on the comic stage, there may have been periodic measures taken to restrict certain kinds of mockery.13 It should be noted, however, that all of our evidence for these measures is based on the speculations of later scholiasts and must therefore be approached with caution. Thus, a scholiast (on Ar. Ach. 67) reports that during the archonship of Euthymenes (437/36 bce), a decree m¯e k¯om¯oidein (“not to satirize”) was overturned that had been passed three years earlier—thus in 440/39, during the archonship of Morychides. Although we aren’t told exactly what this short-lived decree entailed, it is very unlikely that it would have banned k¯om¯oidein altogether.14 Looking at the historical context of this alleged decree may help us determine what its restrictions might have been. It would have been passed the year of the Samian War (440/39) between Athens and Samos, begun after Athens intervened in a dispute between Miletos and Samos. As has been suggested, such a decree might have been designed to reduce partisan tensions in the city by banning comedy that mentioned or took a stance on the war—for instance,\n\n40\n\nz\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nby insulting Perikles, who was a commander at the time.15 Since the war ended quickly, and the Athenians were victorious, it makes sense that the decree—if indeed it ever existed—would have been overturned in short order. We also hear of a number of separate measures taken to restrict k¯om¯oidein “by name” (ex onomatos or onomasti ), but we ought to take these reports too with a grain of salt. For instance, a scholiast (on Aristid. Or. 3.8) says that Kleon, after Aristophanes mocked him, made a law (nomon) banning the mockery of individuals by name (k¯om¯oidein onomasti ). There is also an (obviously false) report by a scholiast (on Ar. Vesp. 1291b) that Kleon passed a decree (eps¯ephisato) stating that it was illegal to put on comedies altogether (!) on the grounds that comedies mocked (esk¯opton) Athenian citizens while foreigners were present. According to other scholiasts, it was Alcibiades who banned mockery by name (ek¯om¯oidoun onomasti ) after he was mocked by the comic poet Eupolis (see schol. Aristid. Or. 3.8). Yet another scholiast (on Ar. Ach. 1150a) draws the same unlikely conclusion from a joke in the Acharnians (about a chor¯egos named Antimachos not giving his chorus members an expected meal): “It seems that Antimachos made a decree [ps¯ephisma] banning mockery by name [k¯o­ m¯oidein ex onomatos], and for this reason many of the comic poets didn’t receive choruses, and many of the chorus members went hungry.” Given that all these measures are unsupported by contemporaneous evidence and appear to be speculations by much later scholiasts, it is generally thought that none of these measures were in fact taken.16 Also somewhat improbable is the much-discussed “decree of Syrakosios” restricting mockery by name. Our main evidence for this (unlikely) measure comes from a scholiast on Aristophanes’ Birds line 1297, in which the nickname of a certain Syrakosios is said to be “Jay.” The scholiast explains that Syrakosios was a public speaker, whom Eupolis in his Cities ridiculed as being chatty. After quoting a few lines of Eupolis comparing Syrakosios going up to the speaker’s platform to a little dog running and yapping along a wall, the scholiast then comments: “It seems [dokei] that [Syrakosios] made a decree not to mock anyone by name [m¯e k¯om¯oidein onomasti], as Phrynichos says in his Hermit:\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nz\n\n41\n\n‘Itch, get Syrakosios. May he get a lot of it and very clearly. For he has taken away [the right] to mock whomever they [or I?] wish [hous epethumoun].’” One difficulty here, among others, is that it’s unclear where Phrynichos’ words end and the scholiast’s begin again. But if, for the sake of argument, we give some credence to the scholiast’s report, what might we glean about the purpose of Syra­ kosios’ decree, which (if it really existed) was unlikely to have banned all insults by name?17 Reviving a theory of Johann Droysen’s from 1835, Alan Sommerstein proposes that Syrakosios’ decree prohibited reference specifically to those involved in the sacrilegious events of 415/14 bce (the defamation of the mysteries and the mutilation of the herms); that is, it banned the comic poets from mocking certain people (rather than banning the mockery of any person by name), and indeed none of those condemned for sacrilege were in fact mentioned in comedies from 415/14 to 411/10.18 Most scholars have not found this argument credible, however, in part because it’s hard to understand why protection from mockery would have been accorded to the perpetrators of such grave offenses.19 This argument, combined with our scanty evidence for the decree, as well as the lack of any compelling motivations behind it, makes me doubt that Syra­kosios’ decree ever existed.20 In addition to the aforementioned alleged regulations against mocking individuals by name, there may also have been a separate restriction placed on insulting the people of Athens, on the grounds that doing so endangered the demos’ interests.21 PseudoXenophon, for example, says that Athenians “do not permit the demos to be satirized [k¯om¯oidein] or ill spoken of [kak¯os legein], so that they may not have a bad reputation [akou¯osin kak¯os]” (Ath. Pol. 2.18).22 While Pseudo-Xenophon (also known as the Old Oligarch for his antidemocratic views) is likely exaggerating the degree to which the demos was protected from abuse—after all, the people are criticized seemingly unproblematically in Aristoph­ anes’ Knights and elsewhere—his words may have some basis in truth.23 At any rate, it seems that a playwright could at least no­ tionally be prosecuted for mocking the demos, a point to which I will return.24\n\n42\n\nz\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nContent of Comic Insults\n\nFor now, let us examine the content of insults found on the comic stage. There are innumerable insults in Old Comedy, but I focus here on personal insults of the most universal sort, the kinds that could be applied to nearly anyone in the public eye. This means that I do not address the types of ad hominem insults leveled at, for example, Euripides or Aeschylus for the style of their poetry or at Socrates for his breed of philosophy. For heuristic reasons, I categorize insults by type, though in reality there are numerous overlaps between these types.25 Foreign Origins\n\nA very common insult in Old Comedy is that someone is either a foreigner or born to one or two foreign parents.26 This insult must be understood in light of Perikles’ citizenship law of 451/50 bce, which required citizens to be born from two citizen parents.27 From that point on, accusations or insinuations of foreignness became an easy way to question someone’s citizenship status. In the context of comedy, these insults were not (necessarily) meant to be taken literally, but they could nonetheless have the effect of casting doubt on an individual’s fitness for citizenship. A frequent target for this kind of abuse is the politician Kleophon.28 Within the space of a few short lines in Aristophanes’ Frogs, the chorus invokes Kleophon’s alleged foreignness three times, singing of his “bilingual lips” on which “some Thracian swallow roars terribly, perched on an alien [barbaron] petal” (678–81).29 Later in the play, the chorus issues another jab, saying that Kleophon and all others who want to fight should do so on their native soil (1533–34)—that is, somewhere that is not Athens. These insults are not limited to the plays of Aristophanes, however. In Plato’s Kleophon, the comic playwright apparently depicts Kleophon’s mother speaking to him in a foreign language, prompting a scholiast to comment that the mother was said to be Thracian (PCG vii fr. 61).30 But was any of this true? Given that Kleophon’s citizenship status was (to our knowledge) never challenged in real life, he was probably recognized as a genuine\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nz\n\n43\n\ncitizen. It is, however, possible that he had Thracian blood, since if he was born before 451/50, having a Thracian mother would not have precluded his receipt of citizenship.31 In any case, for these satirical insults to have been effective (and funny), they would likely need to have traded on—and reinforced—rumors about Kleophon’s perceived ancestry.32 The politician Hyperbolos was a target of similar insults. Different comic poets attributed different foreign origins to him, with one calling him a Phrygian, another a Lydian.33 Plato, in his eponymous comedy about Hyperbolos, pokes fun at his way of speaking, having a character say, “O dear Fates, the man [Hyperbolos] just couldn’t speak Attic Greek. But when he ought to be saying ‘I used to live,’ he would come out with ‘I use to live,’ and when he should be saying ‘just a bit,’ he would say ‘jus’ a bit’” (PCG vii fr. 183). Whether the joke is that Hyperbolos talks like a foreigner or simply a low-class city dweller, either way it points to his base (and therefore suspect) origins.34 Hyperbolos’ alleged foreignness is alluded to again in the same play when a slave tells his master that his master was chosen—as an alternate “to a nasty foreign person [pon¯er¯oi kai xen¯oi], not yet a free citizen [eleuther¯oi],” namely Hyperbolos—to serve on the council (PCG vii fr. 182). Since in reality Hyperbolos was of pure Athenian stock, these insults about his foreignness are not strictly speaking true. However, as John Davies suggests, they may be rooted in the fact that Hyperbolos grew up poor and entered politics only after making money through his lamp-making business.35 Indeed, poverty and lowly occupations were also grounds for calling into question someone’s citizenship credentials. Another individual whose origins are mocked is a man (otherwise unknown to us) named Exekestides. When in the Birds Peise­ tairos asks if Euelpides can find their native land (i.e., Athens) from where they are, Euelpides says, “God no, from here not even Exekestides could!” (11)—meaning that Exekestides is so good at finding a “native land” that he found one in Athens, which was not his true homeland. That Exekestides is being branded a foreigner is made explicit when, later in the play, the leader of the semi-chorus sings that anyone who wishes can live happily among the birds, including “a slave and a Carian like\n\n44\n\nz\n\nKōmōidein and Skōptein\n\nExekestides” (764), and near the end, when Prometheus says, “If there were no barbarian gods, where would Exekestides get his patron god from?” (1525–26). Again, it is unclear what Exekesti­ des’ actual status was, but apparently it was at least somewhat in doubt. Scholars have suggested that perhaps he was an Athenian who was raised abroad and therefore had trouble proving his citizenship or (more speculatively) that he was originally thought to be the illegitimate child of an Athenian mother and her Carian slave but then his citizen status was affirmed when the mother’s ex-husband acknowledged his paternity.36 Exekestides is not the only Athenian whose citizenship is cast into doubt in the Birds. Euelpides contrasts himself and Peisetairos to a certain Sakas, a noncitizen (ouk astos) trying to force his way into Athens, whereas they themselves are true citizens willingly leavi"
