News.\n\n'I've actually read the script now,' the actress told the outlet, 'and it's so good.'\n\nHenry Golding, Andrew Rannells, Bashir Salahuddin, Joshua Satine, Ian Ho and Kelly McCormack all reprising their roles from the first feature.\n\nAmazon MGM Studios announced last month that the sequel movie, which will be co-produced by Lions Gate is planning to begin shooting this spring and will stream on Prime Video.\n\nThe original film, A Simple Favor, was released in 2018 and was based on the Darcey Bell book of the same name.\n\nIt followed quirky single mom vlogger Stephanie, who is a bit lonely as she attempts to fit into her Connecticut community.\n\nShe has a sense something is missing in her life but then befriends another mother - Emily, a gorgeous woman who resides in a modern mansion, has an incredible job and amazing fashion sense.\n\nBut then Emily disappears and Stephanie starts looking into her past which is very suspicious.\n\nThe film made almost $100 million worldwide at the box office for Lionsgate and the reviews were for the most part positive.\n\nWhen announcing the sequel in 2022, Anna told Entertainment Weekly: 'I can’t wait to revisit the hilarious, deeply dark inner world of Stephanie Smothers, and reunite Stephanie and Emily under the watchful and stylish eye of the glorious Paul Feig.'\n\nDirector Feig also praised the original film as he teased what's to come in the sequel.\n\n'Simple Favor is one of my favorite films I’ve ever made and it’s all because of the amazing writing of Jessica Sharzer and our stunning, hilarious cast headed by my brilliant heroes Anna and Blake,' he told EW. 'Expect more stylish twists and turns than Ralph Lauren making pretzels while driving down Lombard Street'"
