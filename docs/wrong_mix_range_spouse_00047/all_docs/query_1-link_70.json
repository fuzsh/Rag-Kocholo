        "text": "Halle Berry’s beau is seemingly in hot water after the 54-year-old shared an X-rated snap of the actress to celebrate Mother’s Day.\n\nVan Hunt uploaded a picture on Instagram of the star from a salacious photoshoot last April as she stood on a sun-soaked balcony completely in the nude.\n\nThe X-Men star pressed her peachy rear into the intricate metal railing with her arm perfectly poised to block the camera’s view of her breasts.\n\nShe whipped her gorgeous wind-blown locks as she glimpsed back at the photographer with a startled look to complete the jaw-dropping image.\n\nVan Hunt claimed he had accidentally posed the snap writing: “Oh s--t, I wasn't s'posed to post that!”\n\nREAD MORE: Halle Berry told she had 'worst case of herpes ever' but doctors missed health issue\n\nREAD MORE: Halle Berry labels Drake 'not cool' for using photo of her 'without permission for single\n\nHe also cheekily joked: “Happy Mother's day from the bottom... of my heart.\n\n“You have to admit [that's] bada--... mutha right there!\"\n\nThe risque snap earned some divisive comments while the Hollywood star posed with her bare flesh against the wrought iron railings.\n\nSome claimed the post was “very tacky\" or that Van Hunt should “consider her children before posting” while others praised Halle’s irrefutable natural beauty and added: “Those who don't have the courage nor the glutes need to move along.”\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nThe Oscar winner stirred some more hubbub in her fanbase as she later took to Instagram wishing Van Hunt’s mother a Happy Mother’s Day.\n\nSharing some selfies and photos with Doris Edwards Drayton, celebrating her “beautiful mother-in-law DJ!”\n\nDoris responded in kind, calling Halle her “daughter” with Happy Mother’s Day wishes and signed off: “My son loves you and so do I.”\n\nTheir declarations whipped fans into a frenzy as they speculated if Halle and Van Hunt had secretly tied the knot away from their adoring public.\n\nThe movie star and the singer revealed their relationship in September 2020 and while they have three children between them, the pair are yet to welcome any together.\n\nHalle is mom to 16-year-old Nahla Ariela with her ex Gabriel Aubry and 10-year-old Maceo-Robert with her ex-husband Olivier Martinez, who she divorced in 2016.\n\nVan also has a teenage son, Drake, from a previous relationship."
