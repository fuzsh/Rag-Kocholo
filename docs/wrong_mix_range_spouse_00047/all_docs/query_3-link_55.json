        "text": "Every year, we excitedly wait for both the Met Gala’s theme announcement and the Met Gala red carpet itself. The Met Gala has always been marked on our calendars, as the day we set aside time to look at one of fashion’s biggest events. Without fail, fashion’s biggest night revives everyone’s love for grandiose looks. Years after the night, we still daydream about the grand gowns and costumes some of our favorite celebrities wore — many of which include the dresses Blake Lively has worn.\n\nEver since her first appearance at the Met Gala 16 years ago, Lively has wowed in daring, colorful gowns that perfectly symbolize each theme. In 2022, a year she co-chaired alongside Ryan Reynolds, Regina King and Lin-Manuel Miranda, Lively wore one of our favorite looks to date in a Versace dress inspired by the Statue of Liberty that transformed from copper to blue right in front of our eyes.\n\nLast year, however, fans were saddened to hear that Lively wouldn’t be going to the 2023 Gala. After all, we all know she would’ve rocked the “in honor of Karl” theme given her friendship with the late designer.\n\nSo, as we cross our fingers for her to attend this year’s big night, we’re looking back at all her Met Gala looks over the years. From her very first “Superhero” look in 2008 to the gown she calls “her favorite dress ever” in 2018, every look she wore was a winner."
