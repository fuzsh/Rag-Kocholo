        "text": "Met Gala 2022: Blake Lively poses with Ryan Reynolds\n\nBlake Lively, 35, and Ryan Reynolds, 46, share four children and a multi-million dollar net worth after a decade of marriage.\n\nThe A-list couple have made a multitude of ingenious business decisions, including launching their own business, brands and investments that, if they all pay off, could see them joining the ranks of Hollywood’s elusive billionaires.\n\nThe club includes world-renowned stars and household names like Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Rihanna.\n\nAs the saying goes, it takes money to make money, so what did the couple start with as they now stare down a potential ten-figure net worth?\n\nQuite simply the movie stars began with a similar-sized paycheque as their peers for their blockbuster hits.\n\nREAD MORE: Tony Blackburn cancels all work as illness turns out to be more serious than first thought\n\nUnarguably Ryan’s most well-known, and well-paid, role is the Marvel antihero Deadpool in the iconic 2016 film and the character’s following sequels and cameos.\n\nThe actor is believed to have earned $2million upfront for his role in the first film but negotiated a large share of backend points, which earned him over $22million through its unexpected popularity and his paycheques have only grown ever since.\n\nIn 2020, the actor more than proved his worth as a Hollywood star when Forbes listed him as the second highest-paid actor with a net worth of $106million.\n\nSimilarly, his wife Blake started her career at just 20 years old in what would become an iconic role in the Gossip Girl series, earning an estimated $60,000 per episode by the end of the show according to Cosmopolitan.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nSue Cleaver looks ‘20 years younger’ after weight loss transformation [PICTURES]\n\nLinda Lewis dies at age of 72 as family pay tribute [TRIBUTES]\n\nBobby Davro's fiancée Vicky Wright dies after cancer battle [LATEST]\n\nFollowing her lengthy stint on television the actress veered into films, although The Things reported her highest-earning film yet is the 2011 Box Office flop Green Lantern, where she met her husband.\n\nHowever, off-set the actress evidently has an acute mind for business, earning the role of ambassador for countless brands such as Gucci for which she was rumoured to get a $3.8milion salary.\n\nMuch like Ryan, the mother-of-four has embarked on multiple investment deals and launched her own range of drinks, Betty Buzz\n\nRyan’s most notorious business deal in 2020, buying over Wrexham FC for a cool $2.5million, drew some speculation as it was then a relatively unknown National League club but it has more than proven its worth since.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
