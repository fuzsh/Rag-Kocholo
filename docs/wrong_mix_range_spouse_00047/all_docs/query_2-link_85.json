        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker\n\nCan anyone keep up with the Kardashians anymore? Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker got hitched thrice. The first time was in Las Vegas and the second time in Santa Barbara. The third and final wedding ceremony (which everyone keeps talking about) unraveled in Portofino, Italy. Surrounded by close family and friends, the couple looked like a million dollars in this stunning 16th-century castle monument.\n\nIf you want to have your wedding in this 'objet d'art' of a venue, it'll only set you back by about $4600 if you book it over the European summer months. Unfortunately, this price tag doesn't include Dolce & Gabbana-designed wedding attire or the Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli that serenaded them into the night.\n\nCeline Jaitley and Peter Haag\n\nSome celebs prefer low-key wedding ceremonies, and that's certainly the case with this celebrity couple. It has been over ten years since the Bollywood actress Celine Jaitley married her long-time beau, hotelier Peter Haag. Their secret ceremony took place in a thousand-year-old monastery in Austria. The groom selected the venue as it is one of the oldest monasteries in the world (and to pay homage to his Austrian roots).\n\nThe ceremony was followed by an intimate champagne lunch with their closest loved ones. The couple kept the whole ceremony on the down low and only announced it on social media days after it took place. A secret ceremony is an excellent opportunity to keep things intimate and simple and incorporate personal touches.\n\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend\n\nEveryone adores Chrissy Teigen and John Legend for their growing family and candid social media posts, but we will never get over their 2013 Italian wedding. The duo exchanged \"I dos\" while looking at a gorgeous view of Lake Como, surrounded by lush florals.\n\nThe Villa Pizzo region is where the pair allegedly fell in love while on holiday. Hence, their chosen destination wedding was befitting, considering where their love story began. Of course, we're dealing with John Legend here; obviously, he serenaded his newly wedded wife with his biggest hit song, \"All of Me.\"\n\nVictoria and David Beckham\n\nYou can't deny one of the hottest celebrity couples of the '90s — Victoria and David Beckham. The pair got married back in 1999 at the 15th-century Luttrellstown Castle Resort estate in Dublin, Ireland. As mighty fans of Dublin, 'Posh and Becks' selected the grand Castle venue for their world-renowned wedding.\n\nThe same venue boasts hoasting Queen Victoria and other royal figures in 1844. In 2017, the couple admitted that they had secretly renewed their wedding vows. This time around, they did something quiet surrounded by six loved ones at their home. This secret ceremony was a far cry from the first lavish £750,000 wedding.\n\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner\n\nIn 2017, Joe Jonas proposed to Sophie Turner with a whopping $150,000 diamond ring; so it should go without saying, the rest was history! The pair exchanged vows in a little white chapel in a Las Vegas ceremony in 2019 and hosted a more traditional wedding bash in France a few months later.\n\nThe second extravaganza took place in the south of France, in a gorgeous 18th-century chateau. The scene was entirely done up in white flowers and glass candles flooding the aisles, quite the contrast of their campy Vegas union. The couple then proceeded to have not one but TWO honeymoons because after two weddings, one honeymoon simply isn't enough. Sadly, that wedded bliss only lasted until 2023, when the two filed for divorce.\n\nCindy Crawford and Rande Gerber\n\nCindy Crawford and Rande Gerber have been happily married for over 25 years now. Looking back on the 1998 wedding photos, it's clear that this could quite possibly be the wedding that launched beach weddings onto the bridal stage. The couple exchanged \"I do\" in the Bahamas on Paradise Island in a very down-to-earth fashion.\n\nPortrayed as the epitome of the lax beach wedding, the bare-footed bride walked down the aisle in a mini lace dress with a bouquet of white flowers. So simple, yet so effective. After the nuptials, the newly married couple exchanged their informal beach attire for bathing suits and went for a marital splash in the pool. Now that's what we call the ultimate beach wedding!\n\nSofia Richie and Elliot Grainge\n\nThe picture-perfect wedding of Sofia Richie and Elliot Grainge was set on the French Riviera in April 2023. This wedding most definitely pushed the envelope when it comes to celebrity destination weddings. The couple selected the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Rock in Antibes for their nuptials.\n\nThe beachfront sanctuary offers panoramic ocean views, overlooking the Mediterranean, and is arguably one of the most exclusive resorts in the French Riviera territory that has hosted a number of royals and politicians over its 150-plus-year history. The bride had three custom-made dresses from Chanel, one for each day of the wedding weekend events: the rehearsal dinner, the formal ceremony, and the after-party.\n\nHafþór Júlíus Björnsson and Kelsey Morgan Henson\n\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" star Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson married Kelsey Morgan Henson in the actor's homeland, Iceland. We have seldom seen a bigger height difference in couples (a 6 foot 9 groom and a 5 foot 2 bride), but hey, they do look pretty dang happy!\n\nThe pair tied the knot in a mountainside ceremony, at Hotel Ranga, a luxury resort in Southern Iceland, over the summer of 2020. The bride selected a short and sweet dress for the day, while the groom opted for a traditional B&W suit. The outfits can be seen on Instagram where Bjornson is holding his wife, overlooking the rugged Icelandic terrain.\n\nAdam Levine and Behati Prinsloo\n\nRocked romance! Frontman of Maroon 5, Adam Levine, and Victoria's Secret cutie Behati Prinsloo got hitched in 2014. In a secluded romantic ceremony in front of 300 guests, the couple exchanged vows at the flourishing Flora Farms in Los Cabos, Mexico.\n\nSerenely stowed away at the foothills of the Sierra de la Laguna Mountains, the 25-acre organic farm boasts an intimate farm experience. The beautiful bride wore a sleek, white, celebration-ready gown designed by Alexander Wang, revealing sheer panels on the torso and, down past both hips — an absolute masterpiece. The couple now shares two gorgeous girls, Dusty and Gio.\n\nJohnny Wright and Miriam Soils\n\nWho doesn't love a good old beach wedding? Music manager Johnny Wright got married in a 2020 ceremony that was warm, intimate, and heartfelt, according to some of the lucky attendees. The fortunate bride Miriam Soils, tied the knot with Johnny just inches away from the ocean at the Waldorf Astoria in Los Cabos, Mexico.\n\nThis cliff-side paradise estate is ideally located where the Pacific Ocean meets the Cortez Sea, on the southern tip of Mexico. The wedding weekend commenced with an all-white-themed party, where guests, composed of only close friends and family, stomped the night away on the beach.\n\nRoss Matthews and Wellington Garcia\n\nLong-time, beloved \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" judge Ross Mathews married Dominican Republic's Dr. Wellington Garcia in a private beach-side ceremony. The grooms invited 130 guests, thinking that not many would join, as it was a destination wedding, but they were beaming when 110 guests made it.\n\nThis destination held a special spot in the hearts of both grooms as it was allegedly where the pair first met in January 2020. After spending a few days with the guests at the lush Almar Resort in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, the couple moved on to their honeymoon at an even more secluded resort in the same little beach town.\n\nNicky Hilton and James Rothschild\n\nHotel Heiress Nicky Hilton and banking heir James Rothschild wedded at Kensington Palace (yes, you heard that correctly, and yes, the official residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, William, and Kate). The wedding was as enchanting as you would expect a wedding of two billionaires to be!\n\nThe blonde beauty wore a dramatic white Valentino haute couture wedding gown composed of three different shades of ivory and silver and abundantly adorned with crystals. The showy wedding was a three-day affair that included cocktails on the first day, a black-tie reception on the following day, and ended off with a lavish lunch on the final day.\n\nCiara and Russel Wilson\n\nR&B musician Ciara and quarterback Russel Wilson went wild on their fairytale wedding day in 2016. The destination wedding took place at the remarkable Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England. In a lot of ways, the couple had a fairytale romance from the get-go, so it was rather befitting that they exchanged \"I dos\" in an actual castle.\n\nThe stunning princess-like bride wore a Cavalli Couture custom-made white silk tulle, fully embroidered and covered with Chantilly lace. If you're a bride-to-be and you are on the lookout for that perfectly seamless dress, then why not get some inspo from Ciara's romantic look?\n\nCaroline Wozniacki and David Lee\n\nDanish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki and NBA's David Lee scored \"love all\" at their breathtaking Tuscan wedding in 2019. The flower-filled fete commenced at the castle ruins of Castiglion del Bosco. But first, the sporty couple wanted to be sure that everyone was well warmed up for the wedding weekend ahead.\n\nSo they invited all the guests to partake in a morning of challenges such as obstacle races, tug-of-war, relays, and the like. The day was then followed by the bride and groom exchanging rings in front of their 120 guests, naturally including several sports stars. Among the guest list were sporty stars such as Serena Williams and Paul Gasol.\n\nKate Upton and Justin Verlander\n\nAh, destination weddings in the Tuscan sun... Say no more! Model and actress Kate Upton and football player Justin Verlander married in November 2017 in a lavish Italian ceremony. The pair selected the destination as it was where one of their first romantic getaways transpired.\n\nThey fell in love with the Rosewood Castiglion Del Bosco resort due to its vast history and staggering scenery. The enticing 800-year-old Tuscan estate boasts over 4000 acres, a Brunello di Montalcino winery and so much more. The dreamy ceremony was flower-filled from top to bottom. How would you feel about a destination wedding at such a relic of a venue?\n\nNick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo\n\nLove was not blind in 2011 when hunky star Nick Lachey married his \"Love Is Blind\" co-host cutie, Vanessa Minnillo. The pair wanted to step out of the public eye on their special day, so they jetted off to Richard Bransom's private island: Necker Island, on the British Virgin Islands.\n\nThe ceremony was very personal and intimate, with only 35 of their closest friends and family. Necker Island is a hidden paradise surrounded by turquoise waters, bounded by white sand beaches and coral reefs. The pair wanted intimate solitude on their holy union of a day, and that was precisely what they got!\n\nKenya Moore and Marc Daly\n\n\"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" star Kenya Moore married her beau, businessman and restauranteur Marc Daly, in a gorgeous tropical affair in St Lucia, in 2017. The big day on the beach was exactly what Moore manifested. The two said \"I do\" in a beach ceremony at sundown, under a canopy of white roses, overlooking the panoramic pitons of the Caribbean island.\n\nAfter the ceremony, everyone hailed in the marriage with sundowner cocktails and canapes on the beachfront. The island life was so good that the couple sealed the marriage with a mini honeymoon at the same venue. Sweet island utopia!\n\nMatt Damon and Luciana Barroso\n\nIt's been a long time since 2005 when the actor Matt Damon married the then-bartender Luciana Barroso. Yes, it was many moons ago, but one can't help but reminisce about this special day. The nuptials took place in Sugar Beach resort on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.\n\nSurrounded by the serenity and beauty of nature, the island is bordered by rainforest and used to be the heart of an 18th-century sugar plantation. But alas, this did not come cheap, as it was reported that the actor splurged around $1 million to rent out the full resort for the weekend. This could also be your destination wedding if you have a million bucks to spare!\n\nGeorge Clooney and Amal Alamuddin\n\nAfter a long dry spell, the handsome actor George Clooney decided it was time to finally tie the knot with Amal Alamuddin (now Clooney). The pair exchanged rings in 2014 at the historic Palazzo Papadopoli, the Aman Canal Grande luxury resort in Venice, Italy. They wanted to have a wedding that roared romance and elegance, and that's exactly what they got.\n\nThe duo sailed into their venue in class aboard a taxi boat. Roses, lilies, and a seemingly endless supply of candelabras embellished the halls of the seven-star resort. Their ceremony was really more of a red carpet event, having been attended by dozens of celebrities.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio\n\nTurning the clock back, we're reflecting on the stunning San Fransisco City Hall wedding of blonde bombshell Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio. The lovebirds were wedded in a small secret ceremony inside Judge Charles S. Peery's City Hall chambers, away from the spotlight. At the time, the imminent nuptials were the topic of discussion pretty much everywhere in America.\n\nThis venue is a Beaux-Arts relic that embodies the American Renaissance of the 1880s. The Rotunda floor (where most weddings occur) features an intricate layout composed of Tennessee pink marble. Also, a popular venue for weddings is the captivating Grand Staircase, which is accentuated with gilded bronze railings, pillars, and arches. An absolute gem of a wedding venue!\n\nAnne Hathaway and Adam Shulman\n\nAmerican sweetheart Anne Hathaway married jewelry designer Adam Shulman in 2012 at a private estate on the rugged coastline just south of San Fransisco. A relatively small affair, with only about 100 guests, surrounded by wilderness in Big Sur, California (Fun fact: Natalie Portman also got married in the Big Sur region).\n\nRed carpet fans and movie lovers may have assumed that she would wear Prada, but in fact, it was a vintage-inspired Valentino gown, after all. The decor of the outdoor ceremony was inspired by nature and featured plenty of branches and outdoorsy ornaments. Not only is Big Sur revered for its captivating coastlines but also for its idyllic surrounding natural scenery.\n\nKate Bosworth and Michael Polish\n\nNeed some inspiration for a ranch wedding? Then let's refer you to Kate Bosworth and Michael Polish's 2013 ranch wedding in Montana. Their four-day fete transpired at the Rock Creek ranch, located in a vast private land that roars 'the great outdoors.'\n\nWith rolling hills, meadows, mountains, rivers, and wildflowers, of course, this venue pretty much ticks every box if you are seeking an outdoor betrothal. The only thing missing is cell phone reception, but we think this makes it even more ideal. Guests also got a chance to do horse riding, fishing, hiking, and take the bow and arrow for a spin with some archery. If that doesn't scream ranch, then we don't know what will!\n\nBecca Tobin and Zach Martin\n\nBecca Tobin from \"Glee\" married Zach Martin in a wild winter wonderland bash in Wyoming in 2016. Most weddings occur in the months of summer, but Becca and Zach were keen to embrace a snow-covered extravaganza. The modest ski town of Jackson Hole, which holds a luxury resort called Amangani, is where the magic happened.\n\nThe union was officiated by a good friend and confidante of Becca, Jane Lynch. Other \"Glee\" stars also attended the matrimony, but the guest list was limited to only 80 guests, so on the whole, a very cozy and snug ambiance was accomplished at this awe-inspiring winter wedding.\n\nAllison Williams and Ricky Van Veen\n\nGet your cowboy boots! We are going to the ranch! \"Girls\" star Allison Williams married the College Humour founder Ricky Van Veen in the summer of 2015. The matrimony was set at Bush Creek Ranch in Saratoga, Wyoming, featuring a small stream and spectacular views.\n\nThe ranch boasts endless activities, including horseback riding, mountain biking, fly fishing, paintball, zip line, rope courses, and so much more. An absolute star-studded affair, with a guest list bombarded with A-list celebs, including Tom Hanks as the officiator. The bride turned heads with her stunning handmade Oscar de la Renta gown. And the rest was history.\n\nMiles Teller and Keiliegh Sperry\n\nEver heard of a celebrity couple that got engaged in South Africa and threw a destination wedding in Maui? Well, now you have. Miles Teller and Keiliegh Sperry wrote a love story for the books, and their wedding day went along with this love tale. The couple selected a tropical location, but this was not a beach wedding.\n\nSet at the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua resort, the vows were exchanged in a Catholic church, followed by an outdoor reception. Lodged in one of Hawaii's most extensive natural preserves, one can only imagine the natural surroundings surging with trees, foliage, and lush views in every direction one looks — a destination wedding for those who enjoy islands, trees, and dense vegetation.\n\nSarah Hyland and Wells Adam\n\nLooking for a Californian wedding with European finesse? The \"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland tied the knot with Wells Adam in a stunning destination at Sunstone Winery in Santa Ynez, California. They had to change and postpone wedding plans several times due to the pandemic, but boy or boy, was it worth the wait!\n\nSurrounded by vineyards, the ceremony occurred outdoors in an actual sea of flowers and foliage. With vineyard views on display in every direction, it's easy to see why a winery wedding is a fine idea. In attendance were Hyland's former costars, including Jesse Tyler Ferguson (a.k.a Uncle Mitchell), who officiated the ceremony.\n\nChris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger\n\nComedic actor Chris Pratt wedded the author and daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Katherine Schwarzenegger, in a stunning Californian ceremony in the summer of 2019. The duo exchanged rings in an intimate ceremony at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito. This venue is tucked away in the lush highlands of Santa Barbara and encircled by gorgeous views of the Channel Islands and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt offers a grand array of scenic spots to hold a special ceremony. Must-see spectacles include the immaculate upper lawn, a pristine lower garden, a wine cellar, and various installations on the ranch. (Did you know? John F. Kennedy and Jaqueline Kennedy selected this spot for their honeymoon).\n\nMiguel Jontel Pimentel and Nazanin Mandi\n\nLong-time childhood sweethearts singer Miguel and model Nazanin Mandi married in 2018 after sharing over ten years together. The marriage was held at Hummingbird Nest Ranch in Simi Valley, Los Angeles. Lodged in the Santa Susana Mountains and only half an hour's drive from LA, this exceptional venue includes an enchanting main villa with splendid Spanish architecture and hosts a multitude of outdoor spaces.\n\nAdorably romantic accommodations, shady groves of olive trees, sparkling fountains, and breathtaking canyon views can be enjoyed here. The event was attended by 260 loved ones, who got treated to an In-N-Out burger truck, ensuring everyone finished the night with a bellyful.\n\nSteven Yeun and Joana Pak\n\nThe love story of actor Steven Yeun and professional photographer Joana Pak started back in 2009 in Chicago. The duo couldn't wait to tie the knot on a picturesque Los Angeles hilltop estate in 2016. They wanted it to be a party that would integrate elements of their shared Korean heritage, and that's exactly how things went!\n\nThe flower-filled affair kicked off at a stylish yet quirky Old Hollywood-style villa, the Paramour Estate. The two wore Korean-inspired attire and offered Korean-American fusion food, including a late-night snack of celebration noodles. This wedding made East and West fusion look like a piece of cake!\n\nIvy Getty and Tobias Engel\n\nThe heiress Ivy Getty, the great-granddaughter of billionaire oil magnate J. Paul Getty, wedded Tobias Engel, a photographer, in a perfect matrimony held in San Francisco's City Hall, in the fall of 2021. It is well known that the town hall in SF is an absolute treasure that celebrates and embodies the American golden age of the late 1800s.\n\nWith bronze-coated gates and staircases, it's tough to match the elegance of this venue. The bride's dress was an absolute jaw-dropper, which featured four coatings and actual fragments of a shattered mirror — a totally vintage masterpiece of a dress to match their 1960s wedding theme.\n\nLily Aldrige and Caleb Followill\n\nVictoria's Secret model Lily Aldrige's world got rocked when she married the Kings of Leon frontman Caleb Followill in the spring of 2011. The two exchanged rings at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California. The ranch's story starts in old California, where nostalgia, romance, and legend entangle.\n\nWith 550 acres and 16-plus miles of hiking tracks through jasmine, lavender, orange blossoms, and eucalyptus stowed between the cliffs and ocean, San Ysidro Ranch is an oasis of natural beauty, peace, and quiet. It's no wonder that historical figures such as Audrey Hepburn, Winston Churchill, and JFK plus Jackie spent some time here for either a wedding or a honeymoon back in their days.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin\n\nBefore GOOP was born, actress Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay's singer-songwriter Chris Martin pulled off a stunt that most A-list celebs can't handle: a truly private betrothal. The secret ceremony took place at the famous Santa Barbara courthouse in California back in 2003. The historic 1929 Spanish-inspired establishment is one of the most exquisite buildings in America.\n\nIt was rumored that no family members attended, not even the bride or groom's parents, so this was indeed a private affair. A marriage license can be obtained for a meager $100 here, so if you are on the lookout for a cheap, private courthouse wedding location, then this could be the perfect place for you!\n\nVivien Leigh and Laurence Oliver\n\nAfter stealing everyone's heart in the 1939 \"Gone With the Wind,\" Oscar-winning Vivien Leigh stole Laurence Oliver's heart when the two wedded in Notley Abbey, Buckinghamshire, in 1940. This historical Hollywood love story is remembered as one that was filled with passion, love, backstabbing, and heartbreak. Nonetheless, they enjoyed a gorgeous betrothal at this enchanting wedding venue.\n\nNestled on the county's border with Oxfordshire, it is genuinely admirable from the inside out. Couples marrying here have a choice regarding where they want to exchange vows. There is a Monks' Refectory dated to 1162, a utopian walled garden, and Abbot's Hall for a more intimate procession, as only 100 guests can be seated here. This Abbey could be your destination wedding venue if you have approximately $25,000 lying around.\n\nSimon Huck and Phil Riportella\n\nFor us normal folks, weddings are occasions for gathering our closest friends and family to celebrate love. But for celebrities, weddings are opportunities to flaunt their ludicrous amounts of cash and throw the biggest event of the season, and this is no different for Simon Huck and Phil Riportella.\n\nThe grooms got hitched in a two-night affair at the Los Angeles Hotel Bel-Air in November 2021. This little 12-acre paradise of elegant enchantment has been delivering luxury since 1946 and has been graced with guests, including Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, and the like, over its period of existence.\n\nChanel Iman and Sterling Shepard\n\nWhat happens when an NFL player marries a supermodel? The most fabulous wedding photos... ever? With just three months to plan, the couple Chanel Iman and Sterling Shepard managed to pull off a gorgeous, over-the-top Beverly Hills wedding in 2018.\n\nThe nuptials took place in a gorgeous garden ceremony, where everything, as in EVERYTHING, was draped in white. After that, the fete moved to the flower-filled ballroom. This Pink Palace has been so much more than just a home away from home or a wedding venue for the rich and famous. It has also been the movie set for many famous films, such as Beverly Hills Cop.\n\nKym Johnson and Robert Herjavec\n\nThe stars aligned when \"Dancing With the Stars\" partners Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec wedded in 2016. The wedding was held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles. This Beverly Hills Hotel offers a charming yet low-key urban sanctuary, making it a long-time favorite Hollywood wedding venue.\n\nThe bride lost her cool when the surprise guest singer Olivia Newton-John performed \"Let's Get Physical.\" The first dance as newlyweds was to \"At Last,\" a special tribute to their dancing roots. One of the many highlights of the evening was a coordinated dance with the bridal party to \"Bills\" by LunchMoney Lewis (reportedly the first song that the duo cha-chaed to on \"Dancing With the Stars.\") Dreams do come true!\n\nSarah Levy and Graham Outerbridge\n\nDo you remember Twyla from \"Schitt's Creek?\" That girl (Sarah Levy) got married to actor and producer Graham Outerbridge in a secret ceremony in the fall of 2021. The pair exchanged their I dos at the Terrace of Sunset Tower Hotel on the world-renowned Sunset Boulevard.\n\nThe iconic West Hollywood landmark offers an elegant yet seamless style with breathtaking views and is unofficially known as the epicenter of, you guessed it, Hollywood! Attended by only close friends and family (including the \"Schitt's Creek\" family squad), the couple wanted to have a low-key ceremony that celebrated their love in a cozy, intimate gathering.\n\nSamira Wiley and Lauren Morelli\n\nIt was love at first sight when Samira Wiley and Lauren Morelli first laid eyes on each other on the set of \"Orange Is the New Black.\" The kaleidoscopic wedding was held in a desert oasis in Palm Springs (the exact location where the two got engaged). The lush destination is huddled in the highlands of the Indian Canyons and the San Jacinto Mountains.\n\nThey chose the venue Colony 29, which offers a circular ceremony layout, unlike the standard layout. It is also praised for its vast gardens and expansive foothills. Confetti was flying everywhere with this funfetti-themed wedding. They even had a confetti cannon, which is precisely what it chimes out!\n\nChance the Rapper and Kirsten Corley\n\nChancelor Bennett, a.k.a. Chance the Rapper wedded his long-time lover Kirsten Corley in 2019 at the Pelican Hill Resort. This luxury resort is perched above the shoreline between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach in Southern Cali, featuring Italian architecture and unparalleled coastal views.\n\nThe decor was all white, with massive displays of white roses and a sea of white petals scattered along the aisle. The scene and the couple looked radiant as if they'd been delivered straight out of a fantasy. Chance donned an all-white tux and black bow tie. Meanwhile, Kirsten was the cherry on top with her strapless white gown. The epitome of a fairytale wedding!\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Lopez\n\nSo nice they did it twice! In the summer of 2022, Bennifer (Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez) got married two times. The first time was a private elopement in the \"little chapel\" of Las Vegas (classic). The second ceremony was an absolute showstopper extravaganza on Affleck's sprawling Georgia estate.\n\nThe estate has previously been described as: \"a remarkable re-creation of a Southern antebellum Greek Revival plantation home.\" Affleck bought the 87-acre hideaway in 2003 for a hefty $7.1 million. The wedding weekend commenced with a rehearsal dinner on Friday night, followed by the ceremony on Saturday, including only a few close-knit loved ones, and ended with a BBQ on Sunday.\n\nMichael Phelps and Nicole Johnson\n\nDespite winning America's hearts with his collection of gold medals, Olympian swimmer Michael Phelps did it all over again, with his 2016 wedding to former Miss California, Nicole Johnson (now Phelps). The pair doubled their love by having not one but two ceremonies. The first intimate ceremony was set in their backyard in Tempe, Arizona, and was only attended by five guests.\n\nThe second time around, the pair jetted off to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico to celebrate with a stunning garden ceremony, out-looking the beach. For the romantic seaside ceremony, the pair were accompanied by only 50 loved ones, including their son Boomer as the charming ring bearer.\n\nLily Collins and Charlie McDowell\n\nWe're sure everyone remembers \"Emily in Paris.\" Well, it's now Lily in Colorado! It was a quaint country affair when actress Lily Collins married director Charlie McDowell in the summer of 2021. Sure, the bride in her Ralph Lauren gown and her husband were the eye candy of the day, but nature was a close second!\n\nThe couple exchanged rings at the Dunton Hot Springs, perched in the San Juan alpine mountains. As the name indicates, there are five hot springs in the region's 1600-acre estate. This charming wooded hideaway has a capped guest list of 40 people, so one can only imagine the intimacy of this romantic, outdoorsy affair.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas\n\nWounding back the clock a bit, we're remembering the classic New York Plaza Hotel wedding of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas. The duo tied the knot in a splendid ceremony in the winter of 2000. Of course, with such an A-list couple, the wedding was attended by 250 guests, including celebs such as Whoopie Goldberg, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, and the like.\n\nIt was reported to have cost the couple over $2 million (much more money today). The two have been through thick and thin (including a brief split in 2013), but ultimately, they are still happy and together after more than two decades of wedlock.\n\nMarc Jacobs and Charly Defrancesco\n\nDesigner Marc Jacobs married his long-time boyfriend, the candle-maker Charly \"Char\" Defrancesco in an over-the-top NYC affair in 2022. Going all the way with the public celebration of love, Jacobs proposed to Char with the help of a flash mob. The marriage kicked off at The Grill in the Seagram Building.\n\nTheir special day was filled with decadence and glamor, with a party catering for over 700 guests. A group of dancers carried in their five-layer cake, which was taller than both of them. The lucky guests got to take home a parcel of vape pens and embroidered sweatshirts. It was really more of a Met Gala event than a wedding, by the sounds of it all.\n\nJim Parsons and Todd Spiewick\n\nAfter 15 years of dating, \"The Big Bang Theory's\" Jim Parsons finally tied the knot with his long-time love Todd Spiewick in 2017. The ceremony was held at the Rainbow Room, a New York landmark in the Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nDraped in shimmering crystals and polished with elegance, this venue sets the standard for an iconic \"I do\" moment. It'll be tough to find another spot with such sprawling views. Both grooms rocked out in matching black tuxes and spent a massive wad of their CBS money on floral arrangements. It was all very sleek and sacred. Consider your mood boards updated!\n\nKate Bock and Kevin Love\n\nIt was all glitz and glamor when the entrepreneur and model Kate Bock tied the knot to the NBA star Kevin Love in their Great Gatsby-themed love affair. The wedding was held at the old-school Astor Hall of the New York Public Library in the summer of 2022.\n\nThis flagship location has been known as one of the most idyllic spaces for couples to exchange rings and has hosted legendary films like \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" \"Spider-Man,\" and \"Ghostbusters.\" The venue's most notable feature is the Vermont marble veneer and the pink Tennessee marble library lions that fringe the main outer staircase.\n\nSophia Bush and Grant Hughes\n\nAfter a beautiful Lake Como boat engagement in Italy, Sophia Bush from \"One Tree Hill\" wedded the real estate investor Grant Hughes in the summer of 2022. The pair exchanged their I dos at the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThis venue is adored by the Tulsa community and outsiders for its unique ambiance that combines history, art, and a sprawling garden all in one place. The gardens are gorgeous, offering exquisite sculptures, fountains, and thriving plants and trees all year round. After the nuptials part of the day, the celebration moved to the Church Studio to continue the celebrations.\n\nSerena Williams and Alexis Ohanian\n\nIt was a fairytale affair when the tennis star Serena Williams wedded Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Serena didn't use Reddit, and Alexis wasn't really into tennis, but we think it's safe to say this is a star combo. The two met in Rome while lodging at the same hotel and got engaged a year later at that very hotel.\n\nA year after that, the two wed in New Orleans in 2017 at the Contemporary Art Centre. The wedding reception was more of a ball, in the Beauty and the Beast-themed hall. The space was bedecked with chandeliers, abundant flowers, long tables draped in lamé fabric, trophy-type place cards, and of course, royal throne-like seating for the newlywed couple.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Cumberland Island had a mysterious little secret. They hosted the highly classified wedding of John F Kennedy Jr. and his partner Carolyn Bessette in a private ceremony (of only 35 guests) in the First African Baptist Church.\n\nThe humble church must have stirred up a storm as it was built by slave labor in 1893. It contains only eight timber pews, and no aircon, which was all key to planning such an isolated and remote betrothal. They just wanted some privacy from the constant press that had been bombarding them from the time that they met in 1994 to the time that they both sadly passed away in a plane crash in 1999.\n\nJustin Bieber and Hailey Balwin\n\nThe world can't seem to get enough of a blockbuster wedding, can it? Nope! And it was no different when Justin Bieber and Hailey Balwin wedded in 2019. The two did an initial private ceremony in a courthouse in Manhattan the previous year, but it was the lavish Montage Palmetto Bluff hotel ceremony in South Carolina that had everyone talking for weeks!\n\nThe nuptials ensued in the Somerset Chapel, followed by the reception in the Wilson Ballroom. It was important for both lovers to get married in a religious church ceremony, as they are both Christians. The venue is centered on a nature preserve overlooking the May River — an astounding setting for any wedding!\n\nSofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello\n\nSofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello were in seventh heaven when they wedded in 2017. The exquisite day took place with 350 loved ones at the monumental Breakers Palm Beach resort in Florida. The altar was laced with luxurious strings of white flowers flowing down from the ceiling.\n\nThe reception was held at the resort's Venetian-style ballroom where luxury was spelled out with bombarding red floral arrangements and crystal chandeliers. The couple opened with a dance to Frank Sinatra's \"The Way You Look Tonight.\" With a price tag of over $3 million, it's no wonder this was such a lavish event. Sadly, though, it wasn't a forever match as the two announced separation in 2023.\n\nPriyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas\n\nIn the summer of 2018, the world was blessed with pics of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' multi-day wedding extravaganza that took place in New Delhi, India. Attended by more than 220 guests, the duo incorporated both a Western-style wedding ceremony and a customary Indian-style ceremony, in Jodhpur at the famed Umaid Bhawan Palace.\n\nThis venue is a magnificent exhibit of Rajasthan's heritage and was regarded as one of the most prominent royal quarters in the world when it opened in 1943. The wedding festivities kicked off with a Mehedi ceremony whereby intricate henna designs are applied to the couple's hands, followed by a giant party with dances and performances in honor of the couple.\n\nTom Cruise and Katy Holmes\n\nWay back in 2006, Tom Cruise and Katy Holmes became spouses in a Scientologist ceremony at the medieval Odescalchi Castle, in Italy. We now know how that marriage turned out, but back then it was the most talked-about event of the year. The 'Castello' is set in the lakeside town of Bracciano, just outside of Rome. The nuptials took place behind the barricades of the fortification, which is surrounded by a 33-foot wall.\n\nScientologist weddings are comparable to traditional weddings in that rings, music, and flowers all play a part in the ceremony. The wedding woke the sleepy town up and became a breeding ground for media action. TV satellite trucks, paparazzi, and even a helicopter TV crew fluttered overhead the castle for this event.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West\n\nIt's really just Kim Kardashian's world, and we're living in it. Kim and Kanye West got married in the spring of 2014 (and got divorced in 2022, but that's a different story) in a showstopper fairytale location in Italy. The main event of the year took place at the Forti De Belvedere. This monumental establishment was built in the 16th century to show off the prosperity and power of the Medici family at the time.\n\nThe pre-wedding was celebrated in France, where Lana Del Rey and Andrea Bocelli performed for everyone, at the Palace of Versailles! Yes, you did hear that correctly! Kimye then reportedly flew everyone over to Italy, (in a private jet, because first class is for normal people), and the next day the real party started in Tuscany.\n\nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel\n\nOf the plenty of celeb weddings that have ebbed and flowed, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel's wedding in 2012 is one that carries on catching the imagination of most. The two wedded in an intimate celebration in Puglia, Italy, at the Borgo Egnazia Resort. The five-star resort braced around 100 star-studded guests for their extravagant event.\n\nAs Biel strolled down the aisle, her ex-boyband hubby serenaded her with a piece he wrote specifically for the moment. Marking their 10th wedding anniversary, the couple jetted back to Italy in 2022 to renew their wedding vows. The pair have always seemed smitten over one another with posts like: \"I wanna thank my beautiful, loving, and incredibly-understanding-of-her-husband's-shortcomings wife, Jessica.\" Ah, too cute!\n\nCéline Dion and René Angelil\n\nThe illustrious couple Céline Dion and René Angelil were married in a glorious winter ceremony in 1994. Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal is where the nuptials took place. This emblematic venue is Montreal's mother church and was Canada's first-ever gothic-type church.\n\nThe historical, artistic, and religious significance is what makes it the sacred gem of Quebec's heritage and one of Montreal's most visited destinations. The nuptials were followed by a reception at the Westin Hotel Mont-Royal that was graced by the star couple and 500 guests. Sadly René passed away in 2015 from throat cancer, leaving behind his widow and their three children.\n\nPierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith\n\nIt was a Bond-worthy affair when Pierce Brosnan, the face of James Bond, married Keely Shaye Smith (now Brosnan). The pair married in 2001 at the 13th-century Ballintubber Abbey in Ireland, where the groom traces his roots. The special day was enveloped in secrecy and carried some features that would make his 007 character proud.\n\nThe two arrived in style with a 00MO7 plated car. The Abbey's windows were reportedly soundproofed for the occasion to keep things private and out of the media's ear. The Abbey's interior was bombarded with an endless supply of roses, lilies, lavender, and ivy. The fete also featured a fireworks exhibition, a seven-layer cake, and an intricate ice sculpture of Rodin's The Kiss.\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\n\nMany controversies and harsh criticism followed Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds when they married in Mount Pleasant, at Boone Hall Plantation, a site where scenes of \"The Notebook\" were filmed. The couple was accused of glorifying this South Carolina site where violence and discrimination once took place against slaves.\n\nThey have since expressed deep regret over their wedding destination of 2012: \"It's impossible to reconcile. What we saw at the time was a wedding venue on Pinterest. What we saw after was a place built upon devastating tragedy.\" In 2019, Pinterest blocked the venue from publishing any posts on its site. Maybe avoid this venue if you wanna keep up with the political correctness of modern times!\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Garner\n\nBefore the second round of Bennifer, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner wedded in the Turks and Caicos Islands at the luxurious Parrot Cay Resort. The award-winning private island resort is perched in the Caribbean sea and is a true romantic haven, with over 100 acres of untouched nature and white sand beaches.\n\nThe remote and intimate island wedding took place in the summer of 2005, with only five people present (including the bride and groom). The nuptials ensued on the beach, with Garner already three months pregnant with their first child, Violet Affleck. Sadly the marriage did not last as Ben Affleck is now back as being Bennifer with JLo.\n\nRussell Brand and Katy Perry\n\nIt was an 'East meets West' themed celebration when British comedian Russell Brand and US pop singer Katy Perry married in a private ceremony in India in 2010. The wedding was carried out at the Aman-e-Khas luxury resort. The resort is bordered by the Ranthambhore National Park and is regarded as one of India's largest sanctuaries.\n\nThe pair got engaged at the Taj Mahal just months before their special day was set to take place. Reportedly the wedding was carried out in a Hindu fashion and only attended by a select close-knit group of loved ones, as well as camels, elephants, and horses.\n\nHalle Berry and Olivier Martinez\n\nIt was a Hollywood fairytale match when the actress Halle Berry married the French actor Olivier Martinez in 2013. The pair wedded with a baby boy on the way, in the groom's native France, at Chateau des Conde Vallery. The 16th-century venue is nestled between Paris and Burgundy and is said to have been constructed by the same architect who worked on the famed Louvre museum.\n\nWith only around 60 attendees, the wedding was rather discreet and down-to-earth. A celebratory dinner followed the chapel ceremony in a pitched white marquee where fireworks and dancing rang in the newlywed couple. Sadly, the two didn't jive much longer after the wedding and split in 2015 following some family drama disputes.\n\nChad Kroeger and Avril Lavigne\n\nIt was all Rock 'n Romance when Nickelback's Chad Kroeger wedded Avril Lavigne in a gothic-style French ceremony in the summer of 2013. Sure, they broke things off two years later but that's not what we're here for. The wedding was set in the stunning seaside city of Cannes at the 14th-century Chateau de la Napoule.\n\nThe gorgeous gardens around the castle are listed by the French Ministry of Culture as notable. The two rockers were surrounded by only about 100 close friends and family in an intimate candlelit ceremony. Forget the traditional white wedding dress! Avril rocked an all-black wedding dress and a black mesh veil and carried a black bouquet of roses. Daring!\n\nMegan Fox and Brian Austin Green\n\nAfter a great deal of on-and-off vibes, Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green wedded in 2010 in a very intimate and secret sunset wedding ceremony with just six loved ones. Brian's son was the only wedding guest on duty (if you exclude the photographer and the officiator etc) and served as the ring bearer and best man.\n\nThe nuptials took place on the beach of the Four Seasons Hualalai on Hawaii's big island, which is a hotspot for celebs and normies alike. The resort is ideal for any sort of island activity seekers, such as snorkeling, hiking, boating, golf, and the like, and is enveloped by views of black lava terrains and white sandy beaches.\n\nMila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher\n\nAfter playing girlfriend and boyfriend on screen as Jackie and Kelso in the retro hit \"That 70's Show,\" the pair Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher rekindled their relationship years later. It took a whole ten years for the two to reconnect after the show had gone off of the air, but they ended up tying the knot in 2015 over the 4th of July weekend in California.\n\nThe ceremony took place at the Oak Glen ranch, tucked in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The five-acre establishment is perched in the ranch's apple orchards and boasts scenic views of sprawling crops, berry bushes, and ponds aplenty. The couple decided to forgo an over-the-top ceremony and had a low-key and intimate gathering.\n\nMatias Prats Jr. and Claudia Collado\n\nAs recently as June 2023, wedding bells went off in the Prats family when the two journalists Matias Prats Jr. and Claudia Collado wedded in Catalonia, Spain, which is where the bride traces her roots. The nuptials transpired in a religious fashion at the Church of Sant Marti d'Empuries.\n\nIt was constructed around the ruins of a medieval castle moat. The church is built in a Gothic style and exhibits a symmetrical facade. After the formalities, the ceremony moved to the Cortal Gran Masia, a site that started its history in 1365 as a fortress where the couple was celebrated further.\n\nTommy Lee and Heather Locklear\n\nA surprising wedding of the 80s was that of Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee and actress Heather Locklear. They seemed unsuitable at first, coming from different ends of the spectrum. Lee was in the peak of his heavy metal rock-and-roll phase, while Locklear was America's blonde beauty TV sweetheart.\n\nDespite their differences, the pair wedded in 1986 at the Marriott Santa Barbara Biltmore Hotel in California with about 500 guests. The resort is located between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez Mountains on Cali's central coast. The ceremony only lasted about 40 minutes, after which the two jetted off to the Cayman Islands to celebrate a three-week honeymoon. The unconventional partnership sadly fizzled out seven years later in divorce.\n\nAdam Sandler and Jackie Titone Sandler\n\nAdam Sandler and his wife, Jackie Titone Sandler, hit a marriage milestone: in June 2023, they marked their 20-year wedding anniversary. Looking back on their wedding of 2003, the two got hitched at Dick Clark's Malibu estate. The oceanfront retreat boasts 360-degree ocean views and sprawling gardens.\n\nThe outdoor Jewish wedding ceremony was quiet, intimate, and attended by fellow A-list stars such as Jennifer Aniston, Jack Nicholson, Sharon Osbourne, and the like. On their special day, Jackie gifted the groom a bulldog puppy called Matzoball. The pair now share two daughters together and a long-lasting marriage of over 20 years! Mazel Tov!\n\nRon Perlman and Allison Dunbar\n\nRon Perlman and Allison Dunbar, the \"Startup\" costars, tied the knot in Italy over the summer of 2022. It's not common to see a 23-year age difference in celeb couples, but these two seem to pull it off! The two seem smitten while dancing together in their wedding attire over an Insta post.\n\nThe wedding took place at the Palazzo Margherita in Basilicata. This hotel is situated in a hilltop town in Southern Italy, famed for its historic cave abodes, dramatic landscapes, and ancient houses. Its neighboring region Puglia has become trendy over the years, but the Basilicata region remains a hidden gem.\n\nSofia Coppola and Thomas Mars\n\nAmerican actress and filmmaker Sofia Coppola wedded her long-time rocker charm (Phoenix frontman) Thomas Mars in a small ceremony in Italy in 2020. The bride wanted to return to her roots for the nuptials, so they held their special day at her family's hideaway villa, the illustrious Palazzo Margherita.\n\nOnce a crumbling ruin, \"The Godfather\" director Francis Ford Coppola and the father of the bride committed to restoring the estate to its original form. The two were officiated by the town's mayor: Leonardo Chiruzzi. The 80 or so guests were treated to a regionally sourced feast of cheeses, salads, pasta, fish, pork, and, of course, wine from the Coppola family farm.\n\nSalma Hayek and François-Henri Pinault\n\nThe Mexican-born actress Salma Hayek and French businessman François-Henri Pinault got hitched on Valentine's Day in a French court in 2009. The pair later did an elaborate do at the oldest Opera House in Europe, Teatro La Fenice, situated in Venice, a city that is part of Italy's 118 little islands divided by canals.\n\nThe wedding gave fairytale vibes, with 150 A-list guests, including Bono, who serenaded the couple. The wedding weekend kicked off in Venetian fashion with a masquerade-themed ball dinner followed the next day by exchanging rings with 150 close friends. The post-wedding fete took place in the billionaire groom's stunning Venetian palace overlooking the Grand Canal. If that doesn't scream class, then what does?\n\nHannah Davis and Derek Jeter\n\nAfter three years together, the swimsuit model Hannah Davis and retired Yankees player Derek Jeter tied the knot in 2016. The two wedded in an intimate ceremony at the picturesque Meadowood Resort in Napa Valley, California, surrounded by 100 guests. The resort is a private and intimate club with over 250 acres of vineyards.\n\nIt offers a multitude of activities, including hiking, swimming, tennis, and wine tours. The bride wore a high-neck Vera Wang gown for the ceremony, which was enclosed in layers of tulle and Chantilly lace. The reception was held in an open greenhouse where everything was draped in white, from the entry hall to the tables.\n\nAdrienne Bailon and Israel Houghton\n\nIt was a picture-perfect chic affair when TV personality Adrienne Bailon and gospel singer Israel Houghton married in France in 2016. The nuptials took place at the 5-star luxury Hotel Plaza Athénéel, approximately a decade after the pair met at the very same location. C'est romantique, non? The ceremony was small and intimate, with only around 70 guests accompanying the love birds.\n\nThe bride specified that they wanted something intimate: \"I didn't want to invite people I felt I had to put on a performance for.\" The bride almost looked as sparkly as the Eiffel Tower in a mermaid-cut dress that was adorned with glitzy accessories. The wedding hall was ultra-lux, with massive chandeliers magnifying the scene. Tres Magnifique!\n\nJames Corden and Julia Carey\n\nJames Corden and Julia Carey spared no expense in their lavish 2012 wedding. The two exchanged their I dos at the Babington House in Somerset, England. Jimmy Carr, Natalie Imbruglia, and Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol, who serenaded the couple on their big day, were among the 200 guests attending the event.\n\nThe posh Babington House is a 32-bedroom structure. It was once state-owned but is now a hotel and private club for Soho House members, who pay over £1000 for an annual membership. In the core of Somerset and bordered by 18 acres of the English countryside, its construction started at the end of the 17th century.\n\nFrida Aasen and Tommy Chiabra\n\nFrida Aasen the Norwegian supermodel had the Italian wedding of her dreams in 2022. The groom, entrepreneur Tommy Chiabra, and the model got engaged on the Italian Riviera just months before, so it was an easy decision to return to have the wedding where it all started. The couple tied the knot in Portofino at La Cervara, a former 14th-century abbey with sprawling gardens and a backdrop of the Ligurian Sea.\n\nAttendees were lavished with options of Italian chow, including pizza, pasta, and locally sourced fish for mains and lemon vodka sorbet to digest. Fireworks adorned the couple for the cake-cutting part of the evening, and the party only stopped in the early hours of the morning.\n\nJohn Torode and Lisa Faulkner\n\n\"MasterChef\" host John Torode and \"Spooks\" actress Lisa Faulkner met on the set of the popular cooking contest.

The two married in a fall ceremony in 2019 at Aynhoe Park in Oxfordshire.\n\nThe 24-acre country estate is listed as a Grade-I country house and was first built in 1615, but has been remodeled and revamped several times since its inception. The wedding theme was animals, and the reception was graced with life-size giraffe statues and sweet zebra illustrations. Sounds fun!\n\nMadonna and Guy Ritchie\n\nIt was undoubtedly the superstar celebrity wedding of the year in 2000 when the iconic pop sensation Madonna married movie director Guy Ritchie. The nuptials took place at the humble Dornoch Cathedral of the Scottish Highlands. The star-studded event was incredibly private and out of the media's eye and included guests like Sting, Gwyneth Paltrow (serving as a bridesmaid), Donatella Versace, and the like.\n\nThe ceremony went down in a traditional Scottish fashion, a nod to Guy's heritage. At the reception, the national dish of Haggis was served with champagne, followed by a ceilidh, which is a customary bash with Scottish dancing, singing, and music. Sadly the union didn't last too long and ended in divorce in 2009.\n\nVikram Chatwal and Priya Sachdev\n\nIndian betrothals have forever been known for their grandeur and glory, and it was no different with the multi-million-dollar extravaganza when hotelier Vikram Chatwal and model and actress Priya Sachdev tied the knot in 2006. The wedding of 600 guests lasted ten days and sprawled across three different Indian cities.\n\nThe pre-wedding bash started with a classical Pakeezah White party in the panoramic lake city of Udaipur in Rajasthan at the Shiv Niwas Palace, and this was only the beginning! The palace is located on the waterfront of Pichola Lake and used to be the preceding Maharana (king) residence. A Fantasia Masquerade party with a colorful mask theme followed on Jagmandir Island, after which things ended at Chatwal's Farmhouse.\n\nElizabeth Hurley and Arun Nayar\n\nBritish actress Elizabeth Hurley married Arun Nayar, the Indian businessman, in 2007. The two had a classical Hindu ceremony in the state of Rajasthan. The nuptials took place in the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, where the groom trotted down the corridor on horseback, as seen by their 240 guests.\n\nThe palace was constructed between 1928 and 1943 and is a remarkable feat of Rajasthan's legacy. It is presently the sixth-largest private living quarters in the world. Nestled on top of Chittar Hill, the estate boasts gorgeous sceneries of the classical Blue City and vast desert dunes. Sadly, the gorgeous wedding is just a dwindling memory now, as the couple got divorced four years later.\n\nElton John and David Furnish\n\nThe day that Sir Elton John and David Furnish got hitched is one for the books! The two signed a civil partnership in 2005 and hosted a proper English wedding fete in 2014 at the Windsor Guildhall estate in Berkshire. This stunning estate is situated in the heart of the classical little town of Windsor.\n\nThe same venue is where the current king of England, King Charles, married Camilla in 2005. What was truly remarkable about their special day was that it marked the first day of authorizing same-sex marriages in the United Kingdom. Guests included the Beckhams, Sir Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, and the like.\n\nAngela Yeung and Huang Xiaoming\n\nAngela Yeung a.k.a Angelababy, wed actor Huang Xiaoming in possibly one of Asia's most lavish and expensive ceremonies in 2015. While the pair are rather unknown in the US, Angelababy is labeled the \"Kim Kardashian of China.\" That being said, this wedding cost more than three times as much as her American counterpart's $10 million wedding.\n\nThe Shanghai wedding hosted over 2000 guests and had a startling $31 million price tag. Full to the brim with roses, the Shanghai Exhibition Centre was adorned with screens that displayed pics of the couple on a pre-wedding shoot in Paris. The carousel-shaped cake allegedly took a month to make and was over 10 feet tall. What a big splurge!"
