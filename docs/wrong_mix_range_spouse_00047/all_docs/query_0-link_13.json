        "text": "It is always interesting to see who buddies up at a fashion show.\n\nAnd it was no different on Monday for the Michael Kors Collection Show for Spring/Summer 2024 during New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe arrivals started early with several A list names modeling the new designs on the sidewalk before they stepped into Domino Park in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nIn one corner was a very interesting lineup.\n\nIt saw John D. Idol the chairman and CEO of Capri Holdings (which owns Kors), Blake Lively, Van Hunt, Halle Berry, Nicole Ari Parker and Tiffany Haddish.\n\nIt is not known if they are pals in real life.\n\nGreen Lantern star Blake Lively lit up the morning in a sexy and plunging 1970s disco style jumpsuit that made the most of her post baby body.\n\nThe Hollywood siren recently welcomed her fourth child - name not yet revealed - with husband Ryan Reynolds of Deadpool fame.\n\nAlso at the show were Lisa Rinna, Vanessa Hudgens, Halle Berry, Olivia Wilde, Emily Ratajkowski, Ashley Graham, Nicky Hilton and Jenna Dewan, among other luminaries.\n\nLively of Gossip Girl fame added a long beige belt and gold earrings. Her shoes could not be seen as her bell bottoms of her jumpsuit were so long.\n\nAlso seen was Vanessa Hudgens in a very elegant caramel beige ensemble as her hair was pulled back.\n\nEmily Ratajkowski was seen in a black tank top that flashed her cleavage on her way in, then changed into a black minidress to walk the show.\n\nHalle Berry was a force of female power in a low cut black outfit with her hands on her hips.\n\nThe Catwoman star added a skirt with two slits up her legs, over the knee boots and silver cuff bracelets that made her resemble Wonder Woman.\n\nThis Oscar winner oozed self confidence as she showed off her fancy, shiny belt. She added a long silver ring on her left hand.\n\nJenna Dewan of Stepping Up fame had on a snakeskin print coat with matching mini skirt and purse; she added beige strappy heels and a black tank top.\n\nNicky Hilton went for an edgier look in a black top with long pirate sleeves, a snakeskin print mini skirt and to-the-knee pointy boots with oversized sunglasses on.\n\nOlivia Wilde of Don't Worry Darling fame seemed to have a blast at the event.\n\nThe blonde ex of Jason Sudeikis wore a chocolate brown top and matching short shorts under her brown tweed coat.\n\nThe Tron actress added gold earrings, brown to-the-knee boots and carried a brown fringed suede purse. Her honey blonde hair was down. She added her Ray-Ban sunglasses.\n\nThe looker was seen chatting up new pals Kaitlyn Dever and Molly Gordon while they all sat in the front row.\n\nBritish singer Rita Ora was a showstopper in an all black look.\n\nShe had on a tank top with fitted slacks that had bell bottoms as she added a long belt and held into a clutch purse. Her honey blonde hair was worn down.\n\nAlly McBeal star Jane Krakowski wore a leopard print look with a wide light gray belt and strappy heels as she held onto a clutch purse.\n\nAriana DeBose from West Side Story fame had on a fringed gray dress with snakeskin print to-the-knee round toe boots as she held into a matching purse with a silver chain strap.\n\nGrey's Anatomy actress Ellen Pompeo was with her husband Chris Ivery. She had on a pale gray blazer with fringed long skirt and matching gray pearl boots. The music producer wore a black suit with bright white sneakers.\n\nLisa Rinna of RHOBH fame wore a black and beige leopard print coat with brown ombre sunglasses as she held onto a leopard print purse. Her boots were a matching leopard print as well.\n\nThe wife of LA Law actor Harry Hamlin stood outside as she showed off her highlighted hair.\n\nMatthew McConaughey's wife Camila Alves had on gray and black leopard print with a black chunky heel.\n\nMichael David Kors, 62, is an American fashion designer.\n\nHe is the chief creative officer of his brand, Michael Kors, which sells men's and women's ready-to-wear, accessories, watches, jewelry, footwear, and fragrance.\n\nKors was the first women's ready-to-wear designer for the French house Celine, from 1997 to 2003.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, Michael Kors Holdings Limited officially changed its name to Capri Holdings Limited.\n\nKors started designing clothing when he was a young boy.\n\nHis mother was a fashion model who introduced him to high end designs.\n\nAs a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.\n\nKors then attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City but he dropped out early to work at a boutique. First he sold clothes then he became the 'visual display head' for the store.\n\nIn 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman.\n\nIn 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee.\n\nIn 1997 he launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women's ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.\n\nHe left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. He launched his menswear line in 2002.\n\nAmong the celebrities who have dressed in Kors' designs are Nicole Kidman, Tiffany Haddish, Reese Witherspoon, Lupita Nyong'o, Olivia Wilde, Blake Lively, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Kate Middleton, Hillary Clinton, Angelina Jolie.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Catherine Zeta-Jones also are a fan of his work.\n\nMichelle Obama wore a black sleeveless dress from the designer for her first term official portrait as First Lady and later sported Kors again at the 2015 State of the Union address."
