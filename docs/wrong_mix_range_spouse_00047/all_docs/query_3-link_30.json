        "text": "With successful on-screen careers, it might not seem like these A-Listers really need to add to their already sizeable bank balances.\n\nBut increasingly, Hollywood's brightest female stars are breaking into the world of business, with companies selling everything from sportswear and cosmetics to sunglasses and eco-friendly nappies.\n\nWhether it's Jessica Alba tearing up rich lists with her wildly successful Honest Company or Halle Berry importing French lingerie to Target stores, these women have seized the opportunity to make money off-screen.\n\nHere we take a look at seven of the brightest and most successful actresses-turned entrepreneurs, and the businesses that are helping them make their mark away from the Hollywood Hills.\n\n1. Jessica Alba – The Honest Company\n\nFollowing a glittering acting career with roles in blockbusters such as Fantastic Four and Little Fockers, mother-of-two Jessica Alba co-founded The Honest Company in 2012 'to help moms and to give all children a better, safer start'.\n\nIn its first year of selling safe and eco-friendly baby products the company, of which Alba holds a 15 to 20 per cent stake, reached $10million in revenue, Forbes reported.\n\nBy 2014, that figure had climbed to $150million and looks set to hit $250million in 2015.\n\nThe company is currently valued at a staggering $1billion and Forbes has named the actress America's richest self-made woman\n\nAlba, who was in Seoul, South Korea last week to mark her company's expansion of her products to the country, has been married to Internet entrepreneur Cash Warren since May 2008, and the couple have two daughters together, six-year-old Honor and Haven, three.\n\nIt was when she was pregnant with her first child and struggling to find affordable non-toxic products for babies that Alba came up with the premise for the Honest Company.\n\nThe California-born actress partnered with Christopher Gavigan, who for seven years had a non-profit called Healthy Child Healthy World, and they teamed up with Web entrepreneur Brian Lee and fourth co-founder Sean Kane to launch The Honest Company start-up with a seed of about $6million.\n\nNon-toxic and eco-friendly diapers gave The Honest Company its start and they continue to account for a large proportion of the sales.\n\nAbout 75 per cent of revenue comes from online commerce with the majority of that from the company's $79.95 monthly bundles of diapers and wipes.\n\nThe Honest Company also sells $170 vegan-leather diaper bags, $14 organic beeswax sunscreen and $13 non-toxic and hypoallergenic laundry detergent.\n\n2. Jessica Simpson – Jessica Simpson Collection\n\nActress, singer and reality star Jessica Simpson, 34, launched her namesake brand nearly a decade ago and has since built up a retail empire that pulled in $1billion in 2014.\n\nThe Dukes of Hazzard star worked alongside late shoe and accessories designer Vince Camuto, who mentored the actress as she built The Jessica Simpson Collection into a retail empire.\n\nIn April this year, Simpson sold a majority stake of the company to Sequential Brands, although it is thought that the actress plans to remain actively involved in the design process and still owns a significant stake in the company.\n\nThe brand, which is carried by Macy's, Nordstrom and Dillard's, features more than 30 product categories, including a shoe line, children's clothing, fragrances, sunglasses, homeware and jewelry.\n\nSequential Brands now plans to triple sales by expanding into international markets and developing an e-commerce platform.\n\nSimpson believes that her incredible success – her clothing manages to outsell runway designers several times over – comes from understanding what everyday women want from their products.\n\nWith her weight fluctuations widely reported in the press, the mother-of-two also believes women can relate to her as she knows what it's like to be bigger than a size zero.\n\n'I have been every size on the planet and I understand women,' she told the annual Forbes Power Women summit in May last year.\n\n'And I just know how to dress them. I know there's all different kinds. There's life in the whole world beyond LA and New York. I understand Middle America and their mindset.'\n\n3. Sofia Vergara – Latin World Entertainment\n\nColombian-born actress Sofia Vergara, 42, is not only the highest paid actress on television but she is also the co-founder of multi-million dollar Hispanic talent management and entertainment marketing firm Latin World Entertainment (Latin WE).\n\nThe company, which has offices in Beverly Hills and Miami, represents some of the biggest Latino stars as well as and producing content for both the general market and the Hispanic market in the United States.\n\nThe Modern Family star, who appears opposite Reese Witherspoon in spring release Hot Pursuit, set the company up with business partner Luis Balaguer in the 1990s, after struggling to find managers or to negotiate between Hispanic talent and managers.\n\n'We knew and understood the U.S. Hispanic market at that time,' Balaguer explained to Variety magazine. 'And that's what kept us going.\n\n'It's about fixing the industry and making the industry better,' he added. 'We showed them how big and rich and involved this market is.'\n\n4. Drew Barrymore – Flower Beauty\n\nHaving practically grown up on movie sets, Drew Barrymore branched out from acting into business with the launch of her Flower cosmetics and fragrances range sold at Wal-Mart in early 2013.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who has been in the make-up chair since she starred in E.T. aged six, spent five years as co-creative director as a Cover Girl for Proctor & Gamble, so she was in strong position to enter the cosmetics world.\n\nStar of Hollywood hits including 50 First Dates, The Wedding Singer and Charlie's Angels, Barrymore has been insistent that her products remain affordable.\n\nAt the time of the launch, the actress, who has two young daughters, Olive and Frankie, with husband Will Kopelman, said: 'I wanted a different business model, I want the money to go into the formula.\n\n'Women shouldn't have to pay a lot to look and feel their best.'\n\nFlower, which has recently added a sunglasses line, doesn't advertise but relies on word-of-mouth and social for promotion so it can focus all money on developing products and keeping prices down.\n\nMany of the budget-friendly beauty products, which include lip colors, eye shadows, foundations, nail polishes, mascaras and fragrances, cost less than $10, and Flower Eyewear sunglasses are sold for as little as $39.\n\n5. Reese Witherspoon - Pacific Standard\n\nOscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon launched her own production company in 2012 after becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of leading roles for women.\n\nThe mother-of-three teamed up with business partner Bruna Papandrea to form Pacific Standard, which quickly found success producing three films within just two years of launching.\n\nWitherspoon's first project was the widely acclaimed book adaptation of Gone Girl, released in 2014, followed by Wild and Don't Mess With Texas, both of which she also starred in.\n\nShe is now set to star alongside Nicole Kidman in one of Pacific Standard's next projects, a HBO series called Big Little Lies, which Witherspoon will also produce.\n\nThe Walk the Line actress has also branched out into retail, with the launch of her Southern Living website in May this year.\n\nDraper James sells products that reflect the Sweet Home Alabama star's southern upbringing in Nashville, Tennesse, including clothes, jewelry, purses, gifts and homeware.\n\nThe company is founded on the principles of grace and charm, with a name inspired by the actress' grandparents - Dorothea Draper and William James Witherspoon.\n\nAlthough it remains to be seen whether Witherspoon's company will have the same glittering success as some of her contemporaries, the future looks promising for the Legally Blond star.\n\nWithin hours of the site going live, several of the pieces sold out, including $125 tank tops and $325 purses.\n\n6. Gwyneth Paltrow – Goop\n\nOscar-winning actress and mother-of-two Gwyneth Paltrow has caused quite a stir with lifestyle website Goop since it was launched in 2008.\n\nThe Iron Man star set up the site to give subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, and then expanded to offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise.\n\nBut Paltrow has been criticized for being out-of-touch with her customers, due to her tendency to champion expensive products.\n\nShe also drew criticism from American cookery author Martha Stewart, 74, who in an interview with Net-a-Porter's magazine said Paltrow 'just needs to be quiet' about home economics, adding: 'If she were confident in her acting she wouldn't be trying to be Martha Stewart.'\n\nThen in April last year, Radar claimed that Goop has seen losses of up to $300,000 for the previous two years, and was $1.2million in debt.\n\nBut Paltrow has battled on with the business, and just this month announced that she is launching her first-ever skincare line, which will be available exclusively on the site in January of 2016.\n\n7. Halle Berry – Scandale Paris\n\nAnother newcomer to the world of celebrity businesses, Halle Berry began importing French lingerie Scandale to Target stores at the end of last year and has now curated a spring line.\n\nThe Oscar-winning discovered Scandale, founded by textiles designer Robert Perrier in 1932, while shopping in Paris with her husband Olivier Martinez, and researched its history before deciding to re-launch the label.\n\n'We've taken this brand and revamped it,' she told Associated Press. 'But we've kept all the qualities of the Parisian sort of style intact.'\n\nThe Monster's Ball star has been a Revlon brand ambassador since 1996, but said she wanted to have a greater role in leading a company.\n\n'I decided for my own evolution as a woman and an entrepreneur, it's time for me to step out and really be part owner of something that I believed in and not just lend my name to a brand,' she said.\n\nThe mother-of-two now owns 50 per cent of the brand, which is co-owned by her business partner Erik Ryd, founder of the intimates company Hop Lun.\n\nBerry's ten-piece line of $7 panties and $18 bras went on sale at Target stores in October 2014 and will be sold in more international stores later this year.\n\n8. Kate Hudson – Fabletics\n\nActress-turned- fitness entrepreneur Kate Hudson teamed up with online retailer JustFab in 2013 to found athletic line Fabletics, designed to provide high-quality, affordable and attractive sportswear for women.\n\nThe company, which has launched in the UK and Australia as well as the United States, features a range of colorful leggings, sports bras and other pieces of workout gear each costing less than $50.\n\nThe 36-year-old Almost Famous star said she launched Fabletics in order to 'reach a wider community of women [by creating] an affordable, high-quality, hip product'.\n\n'There's so many aspects as to what the business plan is and why we believe it's been successful,' Hudson said in an interview with Vogue last year.\n\n'There was a hole in the online athletic-wear community of affordable athletic wear that was hip and fashionable, and when I heard that I thought what an interesting thing - because that is where you reach women.\n\n'Why wouldn't you want to reach women on a wider scope to motivate them to become more active? To me that's what it's all about.'\n\nThe mother-of-two recently expanded the brand to include menswear, with her brother Oliver as the face of the new line.\n\n9. Blake Lively – Preserve\n\nOne of the more recent converts to the world of celeb-run businesses is Gossip Girl actress Blake Lively, who launched her website Preserve in July last year.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who has a baby daughter with husband Ryan Reynolds, described the site, which is a combination of blog and store, as the best of 'Main Street, USA'.\n\nThe site got off to a rocky start, with critics pouring scorn on some of her picks of artisan products and blogging style.\n\nBut Lively, who starred in the recently released The Age of Adaline, has refused to be put off and appears determined to make the site a success.\n\nIn an interview with TIME magazine this month, the actress insisted that the site was a work in progress and she believed that it had the potential to be a profitable business.\n\n'It's a proper company,' she said. 'We have a team of amazing people coming to work and bleeding, sweating and crying every day, and loving it.\n\n'You don't experience these newborn blues in order to have done it and let it fold and check it off your list. You believe it can be impactful and different than everything out there.'\n\nLast month, Lively added fashion designer to her list of roles, debuting two capsule collections on Preserve, which she collaborated on with eco-conscious Amour Vert and Sam & Lavi.\n\n10. Sarah Jessica Parker – SJP Collection\n\nHer Sex And The City character Carrie Bradshaw was known for her love of extravagant footwear, so it seems suitably fitting that Sarah Jessica Parker should have her own shoe collection.\n\nThe 50-year-old actress released her first footwear line in February 2014, designed with the help of Manolo Blahnik CEO George Malkemus, with prices ranging from around $200 to $500.\n\nParker, who has also starred in hits including Failure To Launch and The Family Stone, added a bridal line this year, with a number of styles joining the collection.\n\nIt was recently revealed that Bloomingdale's will be carrying lines from the the collection, with nine styles exclusive to the department store.\n\nThe actress, who has five-year-old twins Tabitha and Marion and a 12-year-old son James Wilkie with husband Matthew Broderick, says the collection has given her valuable business experience.\n\n'I've learned about when things are complicated in business, how best to get a yes,' she told Harper's Bazaar Arabia."
