        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nScript written by Q.V. Hough\n\nThese marriages were about fame and fortune, love and marriage. Join http://www.WatchMojo.com as we count down our picks for the Top 10 Celebrities Who Married Normal People. For this list, we're taking a look at well-known celebrities who married people that were generally unknown to the public.\n\nSpecial thanks to our user Felix_B for submitting the idea using our interactive suggestion tool at http://www.WatchMojo.comsuggest\n\nScript written by QV Hough\n\n#10: Nicolas Cage\n\nOne day you’re married to Elvis’ daughter, and the next, you’re married to Superman’s mama. Ok, so maybe Nicolas Cage didn’t re-marry immediately upon finalizing divorce his divorce to Lisa-Marie Presley – but he didn’t wait long. Cage met wife Alice Kim at an Korean nightclub in L.A..Ms. Kim likely didn’t know that meeting would result in her not only marrying one of the world’s most “unique” actors, but also forcing unreasonable expectations upon their mutual creation and son, Kal-El – you know, Superman? No pressure, kid.\n\n#9: Robert De Niro\n\nWhen an American icon comes walking your way, well, let’s just say most ladies don’t think, “Ah, screw that guy.” Especially when said guy is a Raging Bull by the name of Bobby De Niro. However, even movie legends aren’t immune to failed relationships, and when Robert hooked up with Grace Hightower in 1997, it was his second time in the ring. The couple actually split after a couple years of marriage, but perhaps all De Niro needed was a little personal time, because in 2004, Bob and Grace renewed their vows and continued on as husband and wife.\n\n#8: Drew Barrymore\n\nRemember when America’s sweetheart and Tom Green were a thing? Of course you do, he’s the guy who sang about his bum on the man... All joking outside, the “Freddy Got Fingered” star didn’t fit the bill for Drew Barrymore, or perhaps vice versa, and after a couple of high-profile romances with the drummer from The Strokes and fellow actor Justin Long, Drew found love with just your average art consultant, a man named Will Kopelman, and by average we mean the offspring of a former Chanel CEO. With that being said, money doesn’t always equal fame… however Barrymore’s husband now has both, along with a couple of kids.\n\n#7: Reese Witherspoon\n\nIt doesn’t seem right that Elle Woods would settle down with a nobody, so what the heck was going on when she married a talent agent named Jim Toth? Well, this may come as a surprise to some maniacal fans, but Elle Woods isn’t a real person. On the other hand, Reese Witherspoon lives and breathes just like all of us – and was once married to Ryan Phillipe. At the end of the day, she makes box office hits and goes to bed with her comparatively average mortal hubby, the aforementioned Toth, an agent with the Creative Artists Agency.\n\n#6: Christian Bale\n\nAmerican Psycho? No, actually, he’s a deeply dedicated Welsh actor with a need for love just like most people with a soul. In fact, back when Christian Bale was celebrating his iconic 2000 role of Patrick Bateman, it happened to be the same year he met his future wife “Sibi” Blazic, the personal assistant to the one and only Winona Ryder. They say you gotta know somebody big to hit the big time in Hollywood, and in this case, both Mr. Bale and Ms. Blazic certainly did.\n\n#5: Julia Roberts\n\nWe all questioned the choices of America’s sweetheart when she married country singer Lyle Lovett in 1993 - and let’s just say that Julia Roberts’ personal life wasn’t exactly on fleek upon meeting future husband Daniel Moder. First meeting on the set of 2000’s “The Mexican”, Roberts WAS well divorced by then… however she was dating Benjamin Bratt of “Miss Congeniality.” Nevertheless, it was a cameraman that captured Julia’s heart - a cameraman that was also still married - but everybody knows that you can’t hurry love, even if you do have to hurry to end an existing romance to start it.\n\n#4: Jeff Bridges\n\nIf you’re a die-hard Coen Brothers fan, well then you probably know that Bunny Lebowski was from the town right across the border from Fargo: Moorhead, Minnesota. What you may not realize is that Jeff Bridges wife, Susan Geston,also hails from Fargo-Moorhead and met her future husband on the set of “Rancho Deluxe” while she was working as a maid. So, does Jeff Bridges have an intimate connection with the actual city of Fargo? Ya, you betcha.\n\n#3: George Clooney\n\nIt might be a stretch to call Mrs. Clooney a “normal” person, but do you see her name all over movie posters? No, you just see her name in tabloids... Given that George Clooney only seems to become more charming with age, the world wasn’t quite ready for him to settle down when he married human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014. So that was when we all took a moment of silence to remember single George Clooney and his lasting legacy of smoking hot girlfriends. Now it’s just ol’ George and Amal up at their pad on an island in the River Thames, living a normal life of, we don’t know, TV dinners and backgammon?\n\n#2: Matt Damon\n\nBack in 2003, Matt Damon had already stepped into the shoes of Jason Bourne, but even so, he was still just your average, Harvard-educated A-lister. And when he began shooting “Stuck On You” and met then bartender Luciana Barroso, it’s not hard to imagine Damon’s inner dialogue, which probably sounded like “DAYUMMN!” You won, Matt Damon, you won big. But then, Luciana did all right too. Years later, these crazy kids are the personal directors of their own trilogy; a trilogy of offspring.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n- Meryl Streep\n\nMarried: Don Gummer\n\n- Elizabeth Banks\n\nMarried: Max Handelman\n\n- Aaron Paul\n\nMarried: Lauren Parsekian\n\n- Jerry Seinfeld\n\nMarried: Nina Danielle Sklar\n\n- Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nMarried: Tasha McCauley\n\n#1: Prince William\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard of Prince William? You know the Duke of Cambridge? Lady Di’s oldest boy? Yes, this man IS a real-life Prince, a prince that must’ve felt something deep once he set eyes on then-fellow university student Catherine Middleton in 2003. You don’t need to have the best game when you’re a Prince, but Kate obviously saw something beyond all the pomp and circumstance of his status as a royal figure and future King. Once just a pretty girl from Berkshire, Catherine Middleton is now Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and William is a fella with a permanent grin.\n\nDo you agree with our list?
