        "text": "American actress (born 1987)\n\nBlake Ellender Lively[a] (born August 25, 1987)[2] is an American actress. Born in Los Angeles, Lively is the daughter of actor Ernie Lively, and made her professional debut in his directorial project Sandman (1998). She had her breakthrough playing Bridget Vreeland in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) and its 2008 sequel, to commercial success. After starring in the comedy Accepted (2006), Lively achieved international recognition for her portrayal of Serena van der Woodsen in the CW teen drama television series Gossip Girl (2007–2012). During this period, she also starred in the romantic comedies New York, I Love You (2008) and The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009), the thrillers The Town (2010) and Savages (2012), and the superhero film Green Lantern (2011).\n\nLively garnered acclaim for portraying the title character in the romantic fantasy The Age of Adaline (2015), a Hollywood secretary in the romantic comedy-drama Café Society (2016), and the antagonist of the black comedy thriller A Simple Favor (2018). She also headlined the survival horror film The Shallows (2016), the psychological drama All I See Is You (2016) and the thriller The Rhythm Section (2020), and directed Taylor Swift's music video \"I Bet You Think About Me\" (2021).\n\nEarly life\n\nBlake Ellender Brown was born on August 25, 1987, in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.[3] Her mother, Elaine, worked as a talent scout, and her father, Ernie Lively, was an actor.[4] Lively was named after her grandmother's brother.[5][6] She has an older brother, Eric, and three half-siblings from her mother's previous marriage, Lori, Robyn, and Jason. Her parents and siblings have all worked in the entertainment industry.[7][8]\n\nDuring her childhood, Lively accompanied her parents to the acting classes they taught, as they did not want to leave her with a babysitter. She said that watching her parents teach helped her learn the \"drills\" and gain confidence as she got older and began working in the industry.[8][9] She made her professional debut at age 10, when she appeared in the 1998 film Sandman, directed by Lively's father. She describes her role as a \"bit part\".[10] She was initially not particularly interested in acting and wanted to attend Stanford University.[5]\n\nShe attended Burbank High School and graduated in 2005,[11] where she was a cheerleader, a member of the championship choir, and class president.[12] Her elder brother asked his talent agent to send her to several auditions in the summer months.[4] She was subsequently cast as Bridget in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) and filmed her scenes between her junior and senior years of high school.[13]\n\nCareer\n\n2005–2006: Career beginnings\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was released in 2005. Lively's performance earned her a nomination for a Teen Choice Award for \"Choice Movie Breakout – Female\".[14] In 2006, Lively co-starred with Justin Long in Accepted, and she had minor roles in the horror film, Simon Says. Accepted was not well received by critics, but Lively's performance was, earning her a 'Breakthrough Award' from Hollywood Life.[15] Lively starred in Elvis and Anabelle (2007) as Anabelle, a bulimic girl who hoped to win a beauty pageant. She said of getting into character for the role that she had \"shed serious weight\" for her height. She stated that that process was difficult for her because food is \"the No. 1 love of my life.\"[16] MovieLine.com praised her performance in the film and credited it as having been her \"breakthrough role\".[17]\n\n2007–2012: Gossip Girl\n\nLively was cast in The CW's series Gossip Girl, based on the novel series of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar, which premiered in September 2007. Already having deferred college for a year, Lively intended to turn the role down and become a student, but was told that she could attend college part-time while filming the show (she later said \"This is advice to anyone: when they say, 'We promise, but we can't put it in writing,' there's a reason they can't put it in writing\").[18] She played the role of Serena van der Woodsen in the teen drama until 2012 when the show ended.[19][20] Her first magazine cover was the November 2007 issue of CosmoGirl, where she discussed her time in high school and her career prior to Gossip Girl.[21]\n\nIn 2008, Lively reprised her role as Bridget in the sequel The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2. Similarly to the first film, Lively's performance was positively received by critics.[22] As of November 2008, the film had earned over $44 million at the box office.[23] In 2009, she appeared as Gabrielle DiMarco in the romantic comedy New York, I Love You, a sequel to the 2006 film Paris, je t'aime. Despite positive critical reception, the film failed at the box office.[24][25]\n\nLively portrayed the younger version of the titlular character in The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009) to critical acclaim.[26] Paul Byrnes, of the Brisbane Times, described her performance in the film as \"sensational\".[27] In October 2009, she began filming her scenes for her role as Kristina \"Kris\" Coughlin in the 2010 film The Town, based on Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves.[28] The film, which was directed by and starred Ben Affleck, was released in the United States on September 17, 2010. On her performance, Variety wrote that Lively was \"almost unrecognizable [and] has fierce, pained moments as the moll and single mother .. tossed aside.\"[29] In December of that year, she appeared in the music video for The Lonely Island's \"I Just Had Sex\" together with Jessica Alba.[30] Lively played Carol Ferris, the female lead and love interest of Hal Jordan in the superhero film Green Lantern, which was released in June 2011.[31] The film grossed a worldwide total of $219,851,172.[32] In 2011 she was featured in the annual Time magazine 100 influential people.[33] Additionally, AskMen.com named her the most desirable woman of 2011[34] and People magazine named her one of 2012's Most Beautiful at Every Age.[35]\n\nIn 2012, Lively starred in Oliver Stone's Savages alongside Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Johnson, Salma Hayek, and John Travolta. She replaced Jennifer Lawrence as Ophelia, after the latter dropped out to do The Hunger Games. HitFix film critic Drew McWeeny said Lively's performance was \"smart and sad precisely because she plays O as such a broken, needy little soul\".[36] Also that year, she was selected as the face of the new Gucci fragrance, Gucci Premiere. She appeared in a short film ad directed by Nicolas Winding Refn for the fragrance.[37]\n\n2013–present: Film career\n\nIn October 2013, Lively was named the new face of L'Oreal, marking her first major makeup campaign.[38] She starred in the film The Age of Adaline (2015), opposite Michiel Huisman and Harrison Ford, playing a woman who \"stops aging after recovering from a near-fatal accident.\"[39][40][41] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $65.7 million from a production budget of $25 million.[42] The Atlantic stated that she showed her \"potential as a leading lady\" primarily in the second half of the film, citing her \"clipped delivery and coy restraint\" as well as her \"capable perform[ance]\" within the emotional intensity of the film.[43] In 2016, Lively starred in the survival horror film The Shallows.[44] It received positive reviews and her performance was praised by critics. That year, she also starred in Woody Allen's romantic comedy film, Café Society which premiered at the 69th Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim. Lively enjoyed her experience working with Allen stating, \"It's really cool to work with a director who's done so much, because he knows exactly what he wants\", adding that he was \"very empowering\".[45]\n\nLively starred opposite Jason Clarke in psychological drama All I See Is You (2016), which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to mixed reviews.[46] In 2018, she starred in the mystery-thriller A Simple Favor, alongside Anna Kendrick and Henry Golding, and directed by Paul Feig.[47] The film was released on September 14 and Lively's performance was acclaimed.[48][49] Variety wrote that \"She has her moments .. many of them physical .. Lively's Emily is both repellent and irresistible.\"[50] Many critics believed Lively could achieve her first Academy Award nomination for the role, however a nomination never eventuated.[51]\n\nLively next played the lead, a drug-addicted prostitute turned assassin, in The Rhythm Section, the film adaptation of the Mark Burnell novel of the same name, produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, and directed by Reed Morano.[52] The film was released by Paramount Pictures on January 31, 2020.[53] Variety noted Lively's performance as \"display[ing] a realistic near-incompetence in the face of danger [that] makes her relatable in ways very few cinematic assassins have ever been.\"[54][55]\n\nIn May 2021, it was announced that Lively will star in Lady Killer as the lead character, Josie Schuller.[56] She made her directorial debut as the co-writer and director of the music video for Taylor Swift's song \"I Bet You Think About Me\" featuring American singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton, released on November 15, 2021, from Swift's re-recorded album Red (Taylor's Version) (2021).[57] In April 2022, it was announced Lively would make her feature directing debut with an adaptation of the graphic novel Seconds by Bryan Lee O'Malley, with Edgar Wright writing the screenplay and producing.[58] In January 2023, it was announced that she will star in the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's novel It Ends with Us as the lead character, Lily Bloom.[59]\n\nOther ventures\n\nLively describes herself as a \"foodie and cook\",[60] and has said Martha Stewart is her \"idol\". She is also a fan of Nigella Lawson's work.[61] In 2008, Lively baked a cake with Stewart during an episode of The Martha Stewart Show.[62] In 2009, Lively stated that she \"hoped one day to have an interior decorating company\", citing her love for antiques and fascination with \"colors and textures and layering things\".[9] In 2010, she attended a tailor-made workshop at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and has spoken of her desire to return to the culinary school for further instruction.[63]\n\nShe has remarked that, when travelling, she always takes cookery classes to immerse herself in the local culture.[64][65] In 2010 and again in 2011, Lively spoke publicly of her desire to become a restaurateur.[66][67] In 2011, she created a s'mores cupcake to be sold at Sprinkles bakeries.[68] In 2012, Lively's wedding reception was featured in Martha Stewart Weddings; food photography was the focal point of the picture spread. In 2013, she appeared in Elle Decor to recount her experiences designing a custom La Cornue oven for her newly purchased Bedford home.[69] In 2013, she filmed a cooking segment for Vogue's website, demonstrating how to make a brie pastry.[70] In 2014, she launched Preserve, a digital magazine and e-commerce website with hand-made one-of-a-kind items all selected by Lively;[71] on October 9, 2015, Lively closed the site, stating that it had been launched before it was ready, and that she plans to rebuild and relaunch it properly.[72]\n\nIn 2021, Lively launched Betty Buzz,[73] a line of non-alcoholic drink mixers. In 2023, Lively launched Betty Booze, a line of alcoholic canned cocktails.[74]\n\nPersonal life\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, Lively was in a relationship with her Gossip Girl co-star Penn Badgley.[75][76]\n\nLively first met Ryan Reynolds in early 2010 while filming Green Lantern, in which they co-starred.[77] They began dating in October 2011[78] and married on September 9, 2012, at Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.[79] They have four children: born December 2014, September 2016, October 2019, and February 2023.[80][81][82][83] The family resides in Pound Ridge, New York.[84] Lively and Reynolds are close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who named the characters in her song \"Betty\" after their daughters.[85][86]\n\nIn a 2012 conversation with Allure, Lively said that she does not drink and has never tried drugs.[87]\n\nAdvocacy\n\nDuring the 2008 United States presidential election, Lively expressed her support for Barack Obama.
