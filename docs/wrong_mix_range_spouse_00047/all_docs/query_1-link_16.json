        "text": "It's no secret that Halle Berry is one of Hollywood's most adored stars, not just by her cohort of loyal fans, but by her adoring boyfriend of over two years, Van Hunt.\n\nBefore falling for the record producer, the Bruised actress was previously married three times: to David Justice from 1993 to 1997, to Eric Benét from 2001 to 2005 and to Olivier Martinez from 2013 to 2016, but it's safe to say the star has never looked happier.\n\nKeep scrolling to find out more about Halle's new beau, Van Hunt...\n\nWho is Van Hunt?\n\nVan has carved out a successful career in the music industry. He is a talented musician and recording artist with five albums to his name. The Grammy award-winning star started playing drums at the age of seven and later learnt to play a plethora of musical instruments including the saxophone, the keyboard and the guitar.\n\nWhen did Halle and Van meet?\n\nWhilst neither Halle nor Van has revealed the exact moment they officially met, they have shared that their relationship sparked during the Covid-19 pandemic which saw them spend \"four months talking on the phone,\" according to a number of news outlets.\n\nHalle first teased her relationship with the musician in August 2020 when she posted a photo on Instagram of her feet intertwined with someone else's in bed. Captioning the post, she penned: \"Waking up Vegas! Thank you for all the beautiful birthday wishes from my friends and my very supportive and loyal fans. You ALL helped to make my birthday extra special.\"\n\nWhen did Halle and Van start dating?\n\nThe happy couple confirmed they were officially dating on 12 September 2020, just four weeks after Halle's cryptic update. The actress took to her Instagram again to confirm the news which saw her sporting a T-shirt with her beloved's name on. So sweet!\n\nShe penned: \"Now ya know,\" alongside a heart and foot emoji which could be referring back to her teasy birthday post just weeks before from Las Vegas.\n\nThe loved-up duo made their dazzling red carpet-debut at the Oscars on 25 April 2021. Halle and Van were every inch the smitten couple as they happily posed for a series of photos documenting the special occasion.\n\nHalle looked ultra glamorous in a flawless Dolce and Gabbana strapless gown which featured a plunging sweetheart neckline and a statement layer on the front.\n\nDo Halle and Van have children?\n\nThe pair are yet to welcome a little one of their own into the world however the A-lister is already a doting mother to two beautiful children; a son Maceo, nine, whom she shares with her ex-husband, Oliver Martinez, and a daughter Nahla, 15, whom Halle shares with ex Gabriel Aubry.\n\nVan has one son, Drake, from a previous relationship.\n\nTalking about life as a blended family Halle explained to ARRP Magazine: \"I have two children with two different fathers. Van has a son. As a mom living this modern, blended family, all I care about is that my kids are OK with the decisions I’m making.\"\n\nAre Halle and Van married?\n\nWhilst the loved-up couple is yet to tie the knot, Halle and Van sparked wedding rumours after they were captured kissing in a chapel against the most picture-perfect tropical backdrop in January 2022.\n\nClearing up their alleged union hours later, Halle penned: \"We were just having some New Year’s Day fun! People clearly don’t swipe as much as we thought they did. Thank you for the well wishes, tho', it really touched our hearts. Now it's OFFICIAL, the internet is no longer undefeated #nomoreswipes4me #Januaryfoolsday,\" alongside a selfie with her beau.\n\nHalle's son Maceo has definitely made it clear he would love the couple to walk down the aisle and gave them their very own \"commitment ceremony\" whilst in the car.\n\nTalking to AARP Magazine last January, Halle revealed: \"My son, Maceo, of his own volition, did this little commitment ceremony for us in the back seat of the car,\"\n\n\"I think he finally sees me happy, and it's infectious. It was his way of saying, 'This is good. I like this. This makes me happy.'\"\n\nShe added: \"It was a very real moment for all of us. I teared up, Van was fighting back tears. Even Maceo knew he’d said something poignant. It meant a lot to us."
