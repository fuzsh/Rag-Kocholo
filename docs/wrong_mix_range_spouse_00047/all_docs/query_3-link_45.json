        "text": "Halle Berry is sharing how an STI misdiagnosis led to her realization that she was in perimenopause.\n\nThe “John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum” actress shared her story during a conversation about women’s health with First Lady Jill Biden at the event A Day of Unreasonable Conversation on Monday, according to multiple outlets.\n\nWhile discussing the topic of perimenopause, Halle shared that she once believed she could bypass the stage.\n\n“My ego told me that I was gonna skip [menopause],” she said, per Yahoo Entertainment. “I’m in great shape. I’m healthy. … So that makes one think, Oh, I can handle menopause. I’m going to eat right, exercise, and I’m gonna skip that whole thing. You don’t skip it. But I was so [uneducated] at that time. I wish I knew then when I know now.”\n\nHalle then shared that when she was 54, she met “the man of [her] dreams,” boyfriend Van Hunt. While she said that everything was “great” with their sex life, she woke up one morning in a lot of pain.\n\n“I feel like I have razor blades in my vagina. I run to my gynecologist and I say, ‘Oh my God, what’s happening?’ It was terrible,” she recalled, per People.\n\nHalle said that when she went to see a doctor, he suggested her new relationship may had led to a herpes infection, telling her she had “the worst case of herpes [he’d] ever seen.”\n\nWhen Halle brought the information to Van, he was surprised, and they both went on to test negative for herpes, meaning her symptoms had a different cause.\n\n“I realize after the fact, that is a symptom of perimenopause … My doctor had no knowledge and didn’t prepare me,” she shared, according to People. “That’s when I knew, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to use my platform. I have to use all of who I am, and I have to start making a change and a difference for other women.”"
