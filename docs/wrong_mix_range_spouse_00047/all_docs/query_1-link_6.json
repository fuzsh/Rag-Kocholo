        "text": "Aoedele;9158511 [b said:\n\nETA[/b]--My question is, some of you are posting that its Blake's pr machine at work, how do you know this? I'm just curious, because it seems some of you are so sure of it, do you have inside info. or its just speculation?\n\nLook, this is just my two cents worth and I don't know about anyone else here, but talent management is my job. Personally, I know a PR job when I see it. I'm not denying that it's probable they're dating (I don't look after either of them so I can't say for sure) but as I said before, you can keep relationships quiet, you can stay under the radar, it is possible. I've seen it happen with much higher profile people than her. The likes of Keira Knightley can disappear for months without being seen. Porto Fino is hardly buzzing with paps and I'm fairly sure if they wanted to do it quietly they could have. Fact is she has a big superhero movie coming out that can't afford to perform badly after the success of Thor, they'll take interest where they can get it and if that means going prematurely public with Blake and Leo's relationship then so be it. I was in Cannes for most of the festival and at parties where they both were but separately, never saw them together.\n\nBecause PR is really the only possible explanation one can attribute to the incommensurate hype that surrounds her. How otherwise could she be considered in the same league as A list actresses, be named as one of the 100 most influential people on this planet and be in contention for the title of the most beautiful actress ever along with far more popular, successful, established and award winning actresses like Halle Berry and Nicole Kidman when her contemporaries like Leighton et al who haven't drastically underachieved in comparison to Blake receive not half the amount of attention or press?\n\nRachel Bilson can't be compared to Blake. I mean, was Rachel ever on the TIME 100 most influential list, or LA Times' most beautiful actress of all time list? What makes me deeply sceptical about Blake is that some sections of the media treats her as though she's already an established, successful actress, when in reality, she's more a TV star trying her hand at movies than a bonafide Hollywood A-lister.\n\nIt's not rocket science. Either Blake's got a stellar PR team, or she's screwing someone influential for her career to have got an unexpected fillip in the last 18 odd months.\n\nI 100% agree with you here! For me I really don't care who Leo dates I'm not a huge fan or anything ( I think he is a decent actor) but I find it so annoying and machiavellian at how certain people are trying to make Blake happen and are making her out to be this fantastic actress and style icon. It's just a joke, its insulting to us as a public, that they think we will believe this bulls$%^$. Just my two cents.\n\nI was by no means bashing anyone, I am just curious when people post things if they know for a fact or just speculating.\n\nETA--littlepaperstars--I see your point on good pr, but I also think at times the media has an independent hand on creating these \"stars.\" Case in point, I don't see what's so interesting/fascinating regarding Kate Middleton, besides being married to a future king, and her sister. Imo, they are both plain Janes that are thin with no interesting style of fashion. But the media is suddenly obsessed with both, specially the younger sister. I'm reading how hot with a big booty this girl is, and I'm like seriously? I guess if people write about it often enough, it becomes fact?!\n\nThe thing is, Blake and her PR team will milk anything and everything for a bit of publicity. She's truly leaving no stone unturned in her quest for stardom - and I for one dn't think she'll have any qualms whatsoever shagging an A-lister, especially when said A-lister is single, young (sort of) and attractive.\n\nI don't think they are dating, and I don't believe this will prove to be long-term or even anything meaningful (though I could be proved wrong). Won't I be forgiven for adduming that she's shagging those who weild influence, when a nonentity such as herself whose only claim to fame is a questionable TV show which enjoys a relatively small viewership and who has not achieved even what less hyped girls like Zoe Saldana and Megan Fox and Kristen Stewart and Amanda Seyfried have can make it to the TIME magazine's list of 100 most influential people in the world and LA Times' poll of the Most Beautiful Actress of All Time (she's in the running along with the like of Jolie and Monroe) and so forth.\n\nI find it all amusing how people are overreacting to this relationship... and that it must be her PR people...\n\nHowever, when you put it these terms, I can see the point. She hasn't even headline a movie by herself which Amanda S, Megan, Kirsten have... Zoe will soon. It does seem a bit much...\n\nHowever, it looks like she managed to have caught Leo's attention... which is like striking gold for her people... look what he did for Bar (who isn't even a great model)....\n\nIf she's in it for that reason, so is he. I'm sure he's savvy enough after his years in the business to be able to control the people he's around and know what they're about. I mean there's been rumours for years that his past gfs have been beards and also rumours that he and Haas are a couple/have been a couple so stories linking him to attractive, famous women (with an agenda of their own who agree to the farce of a relationship/association) would be to his benefit\n\nWhy can't he just be in it for the sex? If it's just a beard he needed, he could just continue with Bar too. It's not like she has risen to Gisele levels, so she still benefits from their relationship. Not saying he's 100% not gay, just that there could be other very obvious reasons too.\n\n1 of the 100 most influencial ppl in the world? And 1 of the most beautiful actresses of all time? Wow! These list are becoming a joke! When u put blake lively in the same list with stunners and successful actresses like Halle berry and nicole kidman and marilyn monre in the same list, that's how u should know u shouldn't pay attention to these list, they are a farce. If she's in THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ACTRESSES OF ALL TIME, then megan fox should be at the top of that list. I mean come on, when have we started talking about blake? What has she accomplished as an actress? And i think she's trying to expand her career dating such a perv like leo. Why can't he date women who are like 30? Or at least if he's gonna date 24 year olds, he should settle down with 1. I hate guys that refuse to grow up. Doesn't he feel ashamed when he sees all his age mates settling down? Damn! Even though we don't know them personally, i just don't think they are compatible.\n\nPosted via Mobile Device\n\nWhy can't he just be in it for the sex? If it's just a beard he needed, he could just continue with Bar too. It's not like she has risen to Gisele levels, so she still benefits from their relationship. Not saying he's 100% not gay, just that there could be other very obvious reasons too.\n\nThey could totally be sleeping together, they could not be...like I said, it's speculation based on rumours. Also, I don't think Bar will ever rise to the level Gisele is at (or much higher than she is now) as they represent total opposites of the modeling word imo (Bar is typically swimwear/lingere Gisele can do it all/has done it all). Also, if we're going along those lines, so called beard relationships aren't forever if famous so-called closeted actors and their wives, ex wives and gfs are to be believed. For all we know, they could be soul mates and end up being married for life with a dozen or so kids...who knows!\n\n^ She hasn't done anything of substance to warrant her rewards so far. What she has is the kind of exposure/advantages seasoned actors or people who have recieved prasie in their field should be getting. One has to wonder, if somone like Blake Lively is getting this press and kinds of campaigns and magazine covers now, what is there to reach for as an actress? You get those kinds of deals when you've proven yourself. Shouldn't you want longevity as an actress as opposed to large scale exposure for having done very little?\n\nAnd did Blake really headline Gossip Girl...is that true or a subjective opinion? (genuinely interested). Also wasn't it Blair's character's fashion/style that had the most appeal? The headbands and the preppy outfits is all I remember from when I watched the first season in terms of fashion appeal to the public (i.e. in magazines etc). I don't see what cultural impact Gossip Girl had/has. It's a bad show with bad fashion imo and hopefully the current actors can put it behind them and get success when it ends without being constantly associated with it\n\nReading through all of this I want to say a few things:\n\n1. It's not fair to call Leo a perv if he's even dating her. Yes 13 years is a significant age difference but it Hollywood it's nothing to write home about. Brad Pitt is like 12 years older than Angelina Jolie- does anyone call him a perv? Jay Z is about that muck older than Beyonce as well. No one talks about that either. Leo is 36. People are talking about him like he's 60.\n\n2. I wouldn't call Blake a manipulator or a schemer only interested in fame. I'd call her a young actress whose PR people are promoting her so much they're actually doing her a disservice. I know very little about her: I don't watch Gossip Girl so I really know her from a few film roles in The Sisterhood of The Travelling Pants, The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, and The Town. From those films I'd say she's not a bad actress. She's not great but there's some potential. But I've seen her name thrown in with legit A listers, and covering magazine like Vogue, hawking Chanel etc as if she were a lot more accomplished than she actually is. It make her look like she's eager for fame and attention (which may or may not be true) and is kind of a turn off."
