        "text": "Halle Berry has reportedly exited Kim Kardashian's new legal drama series.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress, 57, was initially set to star in All's Fair, a show created by American Horror Story mastermind Ryan Murphy, alongside Glenn Close and the reality TV icon turned actress, Kim. However, according to Variety, Berry has had to step down from the project due to a scheduling conflict.\n\nNot only was she slated to act in the series, but Berry was also on board as an executive producer. She will now no longer be involved with the series in any capacity. Details about the character Halle was supposed to play remain under wraps, but the show itself is centred around a female-led law firm in LA.\n\nRyan Murphy is set to wear multiple hats for All's Fair, taking on writing, directing, and executive producing duties. This marks his first series announcement following his move to Disney after concluding his deal with Netflix. Kim, who made her acting debut in American Horror Story: Delicate, and Glenn Close are both attached as executive producers, alongside Kris Jenner, Alexis Martin Woodall, Scott Robertson, and Eric Kovtun.\n\nKim received accolades for her performance in the horror anthology, leading to Ryan being approached with suggestions for her to have her own show. During an episode of The Kardashians, Ryan praised Kim's acting chops, saying: \"You were really, really good to the point where they called me and were like, 'Do you think Kim would want to do her own show?'\"\n\nReflecting on this in a confessional, Kim humorously expressed her doubts, quipping that she wasn't sure what she \"got herself into\" and pondered whether she could \"really pull this off\". Ryan, the creative genius behind hit shows like Glee, Nip/Tuck, and Ratched, shared his vision for Kim's potential series.\n\nHe proposed: \"Kim is the world's best, most expensive divorce lawyer, and she has her own firm, and the thing about her firm is it's an all-female firm.\" Kim, who parted ways with ex-husband Kanye West in 2021 before finalising their divorce the following year, quipped that she \"has some experience\" in the field.\n\nRyan went on to say: \"Kim is the world's best, most expensive divorce lawyer, and she has her own firm, and the thing about her firm is it's an all-female firm.\" Ryan humorously suggested they might need to \"build a sound stage outside\" Kim's home, given that the mother-of-four - who shares children North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm with Kanye - is also juggling law school, her reality show and various businesses.\n\nHowever, she hinted she'll have more time after taking the bar exam in 2025.Thinking of a tagline for the show, Ryan joked: \"'Not only am I a lawyer, but I play one on TV.\"\n\nMirror Online has reached out to Kim and Halle's reps for comment."
