Though the film failed to garner critical acclaim, the one success story that came from the project was the costars' relationship.\n\n“It was funny because for about a year after Green Lantern had come and gone, all that stuff, we were both single,” Reynolds said on Entertainment Weekly’s “The Jess Cagle Interview” in 2016. “We went on a double date. She was on a date with another guy and I was on a date with another girl. That was the most awkward date for that respective party because we were just like fireworks.”\n\nLively and Reynolds tied the knot in 2012. They are the parents of daughters James, Inez and Betty. Their fourth child was born in early 2023.\n\nScroll down to see how some of the greatest Hollywood love stories blossomed after meeting on set:\n\nCredit: Hatnim Lee/Getty Images\n\nLindsey Mendez and J. Alex Brinson\n\nWhile Mendez and Brinson don’t play love interests on OWN’s All Rise, they sparked a real-life romance in the summer of 2022.\n\n“Get yourself a partner in this life that loves and celebrates you. This man has been my rock and my champion through this entire Merrily [We Roll Along] experience,” Mendez, who shares a daughter with a past partner, wrote via Instagram in October 2023. “I don’t think I could play Mary Flynn and feel all of that pain without having the love of this sweet man to come home to each night. @jalexbrinson. Thank you is not good enough. You’re the absolute greatest. Worth the wait. Meant to be. My hero.”\n\nCredit: Jordan Strauss/AP/Shutterstock\n\nPeyton List and Jacob Bertrand\n\nAfter months of speculation, Bertrand confirmed that he and List have been in a relationship \"for a while” after connecting on the set of Cobra Kai. \"We had fun on set and then hung out off set,\" he told TMZ in March 2022, adding that he's known List since they were teens. In fact, he's friends with her brother, Spencer List, which made things a little complicated.\n\n\"That was kind of awkward having to be like, 'Hey man, I like your sister,'\" the actor recalled. As for the fact that the two work together, Bertrand explained that \"it's kind of like trial by fire almost,\" while Peyton quipped, \"I'm like, think about the consequences later.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Rachel Zegler/Instagram\n\nRachel Zegler and Josh Andres Rivera\n\nThe West Side Story star shared that she fell in love on set when she accepted the Best Actress award from the National Board of Review. Zegler was not able to accept the accolade in person, so she shared her speech via Twitter in March 2022.\n\n“I wish to extend my thanks to the love of my life, who I was blessed enough to meet on the set of this film many moons ago,\" Zegler wrote. \"Thank you for holding my hand in my dreams and in my reality. I love doing life with you. Thanks for making me laugh.\"\n\nThough the actress didn't name Rivera, who played Chino in the Steven Spielberg-directed remake, she previously confirmed they were dating when they went Instagram official on Valentine's Day.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Netflix\n\nChase Stokes and Madelyn Cline\n\nThe Outer Banks costars sparked dating rumors in April 2020, the same month that the teen drama premiered on Netflix. They quarantined together amid the coronavirus pandemic, but did not confirm their romance until that June. “Cats outta the bag,” Stokes wrote via Instagram alongside photos from a beach date with Cline.\n\nUs confirmed that the two had split in November 2021. “They’ve been trying to work it out for quite some time but decided going their separate ways was best,” an insider told Us at the time.\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nBrian Austin Green and Megan Fox\n\nGreen and Fox met when the BH90210 alum guest starred on an episode of her sitcom, Hope & Faith. They began dating on and off from 2004 until they wed in 2010.\n\nUs broke the news in 2015 that Fox filed for divorce after five years of marriage, but she confirmed that they were back together in June 2016. Though their divorce case was officially dismissed in August 2019, Green announced in May 2020 that the duo called off their 10-year marriage for good in late 2019.\n\nThey share sons Noah, Bodhi and Journey.\n\nCredit:\n\nMegan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly\n\nBefore news of her split from Green surfaced, Fox grew close to the rapper on the set of Midnight in the Switchgrass in March 2020. After production was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic, the costars were spotted hanging out together in May 2020.\n\nAfter Green announced his separation from Fox that same month, the New Girl alum went on to star alongside Kelly in his “Bloody Valentine” music video. Us confirmed in June 2020 that they were dating, and the pair went on to exhibit plenty of iconic PDA moments as their relationship progressed.\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nBen Affleck and Ana de Armas\n\nAffleck and de Armas met while working on the set of the thriller Deep Water in late 2019. Cut to March 2020, the costars were then spotted vacationing together in Cuba and “making out” at a Costa Rican airport. That same month, Us broke the news that the duo were “happy together and officially dating.”\n\nThe pair split in January 2021. “The breakup was amicable, [but] she was the one who called things off,” a source told Us at the time. “Ben and Ana were moving in different directions in their lives and stopped seeing eye to eye. The two couldn’t work through their differences and have decided to end their relationship.”\n\nCredit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nKeri Russell and Matthew Rhys\n\nRussell and Rhys confirmed in 2014 that they were dating. The duo then welcomed their son Sam together — Russell’s third child after son River and daughter Willa — two years later. Though the pair’s love blossomed on the set of The Americans, Rhys admitted that they actually crossed paths years before starring on the FX series. “I very drunkenly asked her for her number when she was a young, single, slip of a thing,” he explained on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in 2017. “So I sort of knew then, when I was 26.”\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAriana Grande and Pete Davidson\n\nThe now-exes first met in March 2016 when Grande appeared on Davidson’s show, Saturday Night Live. Us Weekly confirmed that the twosome were dating two years later, shortly after Grande’s split from late rapper Mac Miller and Davidson’s split from ex Cazzie David. Within weeks, the comedian had proposed to the “Breathin” singer, but they never made it down the aisle; The grammy nominee called things off four months later. She tried to visit the Going Places star at the SNL studios after he posted a disturbing message about not wanting “to be on this earth” in December 2018, but he refused to see her.\n\nCredit: Julian Parker/UK Press via Getty Images\n\nAnna Faris and Chris Pratt\n\nThe former couple met on the set of their 2011 film Take Me Home Tonight, though Faris was married to Ben Indra at the time. Faris got divorced in 2008, and the What's Your Number? costars got engaged that same year. They wed in July 2009 and had a son, Jack, in 2012, but their marriage was plagued with allegations of cheating. They announced that they were legally separating in August 2017 with a statement on Instagram. “We tried really hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed,\" they said at the time. \"Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep the situation as private as possible moving forward. We still love each other and will always cherish our time together.”\n\nCredit: Matt Winkelmeyer/MG18/Getty Images\n\nCole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart\n\nSprouse and Reinhart — who play onscreen star-crossed lovers Jughead Jones and Betty Cooper on the CW show Riverdale — began dating in July 2017 and made their red carpet debut at the 2018 Met Gala. The pair are known to gush over each other via social media: Reinhart praised her boyfriend while commenting on a NSFW meme in December 2018, saying that she’d found a man with “good d–k game, empathy, a height above 5’9, no hoes and common sense.”\n\nUs broke the news in July 2019 that Sprouse and Reinhart had split, but they reconciled shortly after. The duo broke up for the second time in May 2020.\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\nCamila Mendes and Charles Melton\n\nAnother match made on the Riverdale set! The costars first sparked dating speculation in the summer of 2018 after being spotted out multiple times together. Mendes confirmed their relationship in an Instagram post that October. “Mine,” she wrote alongside a pic of Melton kissing her on the cheek, while she hugs him tightly around the waist. The actor posted his own photo of the couple a week later. One month later, the actress told fans she was happier than she’d “ever been” in her life while clapping back at trolls of their relationship in November.\n\nBy December 2019, the duo had called it quits.\n\nCredit: IPA/MEGA TheMegaAgency.com\n\nDiane Kruger and Norman Reedus\n\nThe couple first met while filming 2015’s Sky, but wouldn't get together until years later. (She and Joshua Jackson split in 2016 after a decade together.) They were first spotted kissing at the U.S. Open in Queens in September 2017 and made their red carpet debut at the Golden Globes a year later. Us exclusively revealed that Kruger was pregnant and expecting their first child in May 2018. They welcomed their daughter six months later in November. (Reedus is also a dad of son Mingus with model Helena Christensen.)\n\nCredit: Anthony Harvey/Getty Images\n\nKit Harington and Rose Leslie\n\nThe Game of Thrones castmates met in July 2011 while filming the second season of the hit HBO show. Although their characters had a steamy love scene in season 3, Harington claimed they were just friends in March 2013. By April 2016, they were embracing their relationship, walking their first carpet together. In a May 2016 interview with Vogue Italia, Harington admitted he \"fell in love\" with Leslie while filming in Iceland. The duo tied the knot in Scotland in June 2018 and welcomed their first child, a baby boy, in February 2021.\n\nCredit: Dara Kushner/INFphoto.com\n\nEva Mendes and Ryan Gosling\n\nGosling has made several connections with his film's leading ladies. He first romanced Sandra Bullock after filming Murder by Numbers in 2002. Three years later, he began dating his Notebook costar Rachel McAdams in 2004, but called it quits four years later. In September 2011, it was revealed that the heartthrob moved on with his Place Beyond the Pines costar Mendes when they were photographed having a PDA-filled adventure at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Gosling and Mendes have two daughters together, Esmeralda and Amada. “I’m a lucky man,” the actor gushed to Us of Mendes and their daughters at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2016. “We couldn’t be happier. They are so sweet.” A source told Us in November 2018 that the First Man star is still head over heels for his spouse. “Ryan is completely infatuated with Eva. His main goal is to make her happy.”\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\n\nThough he was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time, Pitt couldn't take his eyes off of Jolie on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2004. \"I think we were the last two people who were looking for a relationship,\" Jolie later told Vogue in 2006. It wasn't until shooting nearly ended that Pitt and Jolie realized \"it might mean something more than we'd earlier allowed ourselves to believe.\" The pair were together for 10 years before marrying in August 2014. The Oscar-winning actress filed for divorce from the World War Z star in September 2016, with whom she shares kids Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox.\n\nCredit: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nLiam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus\n\nThe stars met on the set of 2010's The Last Song and nearly 10 years later, they wed in a secret ceremony in Nashville in December 2018. The couple did overcome a rough patch, however: They ended their engagement in September 2013 only to rekindle their romance three years later.\n\nThe pair announced their separation in August 2019 after nearly eight months of marriage. “Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time,” a rep for Cyrus said in a statement to Us. “Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what’s best while they both focus on themselves and careers. They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy.”\n\nCredit: David Livingston/Getty Images\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett\n\nThough she didn't land the part of Smith's girlfriend on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1995, Pinkett Smith married the series' star two years later. In 2012, Pinkett Smith squashed divorce rumors, telling Gala: \"Every year, one celebrity couple is under the microscope. This year, unluckily, it's us!\" Smith did the same in May 2018 with his song “To the Clique,” which features the lyrics, “Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business.” He gushed about their 20-year marriage on Instagram in August 2018, writing, ““I just realized… This year we’ve been together more than HALF OUR LIVES!”\n\nThe couple share son Jaden and daughter Willow. Will also shares son Trey with ex-wife Sheree Zampino.\n\nCredit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\n\nThough they were both with other people while shooting Green Lantern in 2010, things turned romantic the following year. By April 2012, Reynolds had \"practically\" moved in with Lively, a source said. \"When he's at her apartment, it feels like home.\" In a big surprise, the couple went on to tie the knot in September 2012 at Boone Hill Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, where The Notebook was filmed. They share daughters James and Inez in addition to a third girl they welcomed in October 2019. They share daughters James, Inez and Betty, and welcomed baby No. 4 in February 2023.\n\nCredit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nRobert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart\n\nFor years, the Twilight stars refused to acknowledge their real-life romance, but Stewart finally confirmed their relationship to British GQ in 2011. \"So much of my life is so easily Googled,” she said at the time. “I mean, it's like, 'Come on guys, it's so obvious!'\" In July 2012, Us exclusively broke news that Stewart cheated on Pattinson with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders, who was married to Vogue model Liberty Ross at the time. The costars officially split in May 2013.\n\nCredit: Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty Images\n\nGinnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas\n\nThe Once Upon a Time actors took their onscreen romance off camera in the fall of 2011. \"There's such genuine affection, which you can see on screen,\" ABC costar Raphael Sbarge told Us. \"You can see how they just interact with each other. It's genuine.\" The two got engaged in October 2013 and married in April 2014. They welcomed their first son, Oliver, in May 2014, and their second, Hugo, in June 2016. Goodwin told Us in December 2018 that they keep their romance alive through sweet little gestures: “He sends a lot of flowers, or jam because I like jam,” she said of Dallas. “We FaceTime, like, 14 times a day.\"\n\nCredit: Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images\n\nEddie Cibrian and LeAnn Rimes\n\nThough they were both married at the time, Cibrian and Rimes began an affair on the set of Lifetime's Northern Lights in 2009. Once their divorces were finalized, the two married in April 2011. \"I understand why people are disappointed in me,\" Rimes once told Shape. \"I think any relationship is hard to get out of, and I don't think the way I did it was right.\" The “Blue” singer penned a sweet note to the actor for their sixth anniversary in April 2017. “Every year, I’m even more at a loss for words to describe my Love for you three magnificent souls. The deeper my Love, the more speechless.” (Rimes is stepmother to Cibrian's sons, Mason and Jake.)\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nJulia Roberts and Danny Moder\n\nThe couple met on the set of The Mexican in 2001 when Moder was on hand as a camera assistant. The pair tied the knot in July 2002 and welcomed twins, son Phinnaeus and daughter Hazel, in November 2004. In June 2007, Roberts gave birth to their third child, son Henry. A source told Us in May 2018 that they have a “really solid, loving marriage ... When you see them together, there is no doubt about it. They still have crazy passion and love for each other.”\n\nCredit: Steve Granitz/WireImage.com\n\nRobin Wright and Ben Foster\n\nWright got another shot at love when she met Foster on the set of Rampart in 2011. After two years of dating, it was confirmed in January 2014 that the two were engaged after the House of Cards actress stepped out wearing an engagement ring. They called off their pending nuptials in November 2014, and Foster went on to marry Laura Prepon in June 2018. (The couple welcomed a daughter in August 2017.) Two months later, Wright married Clement Giraudet. Wright shares daughter Dylan and son Hopper with ex-husband Sean Penn.

They welcomed daughter Coco in 2004, but in May 2013, the couple decided to officially divorce after a long separation.

Though their marriage lasted for nine years, the pair announced that they were going their separate ways in April 2018. The Resident star opened up about the breakup to Cosmopolitan in December 2018. “People are like, ‘How do you get through this?’ I didn’t run away from my feelings. I let myself cry. I let myself grieve,” she said. “This is one of those situations where I will see the light. The dawn is coming.”\n\nCredit: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nNatalie Portman and Benjamin Millepied\n\nPortman fell in love with the French-born ballet star on the 2010 set of Black Swan. Their whirlwind romance continued into awards season, where Portman snagged Best Actress for her work at the Academy Awards (and also showed off a major baby bump). The pair welcomed son Aleph in June 2011. \"It was seductive to watch them,\" a set eyewitness told Us. \"There was no way the attraction could be missed. I don't think he could help himself — she's dazzling!\" The Annihilation star, who gave birth to their second child in March 2017, daughter Amalia, gushed about their meet-cute at Vulture Festival in November 2017. “It was really special and making it was really wonderful and so fun,” she said at the time. “It was really incredible.”\n\nCredit: Carlos Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nEmma Stone and Andrew Garfield\n\nFor Garfield, sparks were immediate with Stone during an audition for 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man. \"We got on really well as people, in between [takes],\" he told MTV News in June 2012. \"That was the fun stuff: In between, we'd just mess around and I felt, 'Ah, this is different.' I wasn't really aware of what was happening in the screen test. She keeps you on your toes and that wakes you up. That was the beginning.\" Four years later, they announced their split in October 2015. “They still have a lot of love for one another and they are on good terms with each another and remain close,” a source told Us at the time. “It just wasn't working.\" Garfield and Stone remain friendly, however, with the actor gushing over his ex after her December 2017 Oscar win for La La Land. “It’s beautiful to see someone you love being acknowledged like that,” he told Evening Standard magazine. “I was so pleased for her.”\n\nCredit: Alberto E.

Nevertheless, the singer and the Love, Simon actor remain amicable. “The good thing is we don’t lose each other as parents,” Fergie said during an appearance on The Talk in October 2017. “All of our cousins are still cousins.

Krause and Graham first met on the TV series Parenthood in 2010. The very private couple have rarely opened up about the relationship, but the Gilmore Girls alum later admitted they first bonded over board games. \"One of the things that's been so fun is that it's so easy,\" she said of the relationship in Redbook's October 2010 issue. \"It's a lot, to work with somebody and spend time with them, too.\" She continued: \"He's obviously a very confident, appealing guy, but he's shy, and so am I.\" Graham admitted to Ellen DeGeneres on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in March 2014 that she was unsure if the two would ever wed. \"I don't know. We are very happy as we are and I never have a good question for this answer.”\n\nUs confirmed in June 2022 that the two had quietly split the year prior after more than 10 years together\n\nCredit: Amanda Edwards/WireImage.com\n\nBlake Jenner and Melissa Benoist\n\nBallad duets and flashy musical numbers must have done the trick! Us exclusively revealed in July 2013 that the Glee costars quietly got engaged. It was first revealed the couple were an item when Jenner confirmed he was dating the beauty with a \"yup\" during an ET Canada interview. They wed in July 2015, but only made it four years before getting divorced. Jenner reflected on their failed relationship in June 2018. “I think there’s something beautiful about being able to look back on any sequence of events that you’ve been through and come out grateful for it,” he told Us. “I feel like it’s a yearbook of experience, as is this movie for me ... So, I’m nothing but happy.”\n\nCredit: Jeff Vespa/Getty Images\n\nBradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana\n\nCooper and Saldana were first spotted kissing at a New Year's bash after costarring in 2012's The Words. Their brief romance quickly fizzled, however, and they called it quits just three months later in March. \"She and Bradley weren't super serious at all,\" a pal of both actors told Us.

Hall and Jennifer Carpenter\n\nHall and Carpenter played adopted brother and sister on Showtime's Dexter. After meeting in 2006 and tying the knot in December 2008, the costars finalized their divorce in 2011. During a PaleyFest Dexter Fall Farewell event in September 2013, Carpenter got emotional when speaking of the split. \"Our marriage didn't look like anyone else's, and our divorce didn't either, so... I said it before, just because the marriage ended doesn't mean the love did,\" she told the audience. \"I'm crying. It's an awkward thing to talk about your personal life in front of a bunch of strangers, but there's nothing but love and respect [between us]. Nothing.\"\n\nCredit: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nSophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray\n\nBush and Murray met when they played high school students on the teen drama One Tree Hill in 2003. But after tying the knot in April 2005, the pair separated and filed for an nnulment five months later after rumors surfaced that Murray allegedly cheated on the actress with Paris Hilton. Bush made headlines in June 2018 when she insinuated that she didn’t want to marry her ex to Andy Cohen during an appearance on his radio show, Radio Andy. “It was not a thing I actually really wanted to do, but you know, it’s cool,” the Chicago P.D. alum explained. “Ladies have to learn how to take up space in the way that men are taught they are entitled to … How do you let everybody down, and how do you — what’s the fight? And when you have bosses telling you that you’re the only person who gets a person to work on time, and 200 people either get to see their kids at night or they don’t because our days start on time.” Murray, who has since married Sarah Roemer, clapped back at the claims in a statement to Us. “This story is ludicrous. Chad conducts himself in a completely professional manner and would never marry for any reason but love,” the actor’s rep said. “13 years since his divorce from Sophia, he has a very happy family life with his wife and children. He has completely moved on and doesn’t feel the need to engage in this type of behavior.”\n\nCredit: Gregg DeGuire/WireImage.com\n\nLea Michele and Cory Monteith\n\nMichele and Monteith began dating in early 2012 after meeting on the FOX comedy Glee.

Three years later, however, the Dark Knight actor tragically died at the age of 28 of an accidental overdose in NYC in January 2008. \"I experienced a lot of loss after his death,\" the Dawson's Creek alum told The Daily Beast in January 2011. \"I lost my city because of all the paparazzi descending upon us.\" She continued: \"It felt as if things were literally slipping through my fingers. Things were just streaming away from me. I lost my sense of humor.” Williams went on to marry singer-songwriter Phil Elverum in a secret ceremony in July 2018. Ledger’s dad, Kim Ledger, told The Goss at the time that he and his wife were “terribly happy” for the actress, adding, “It is great.”\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/WireImage.com\n\nJude Law and Sienna Miller\n\nLaw and Miller first met on the set of Alfie in 2004.

I burnt a lot of bridges,\" she said in Esquire U.K.'s March 2014 issue. Miller, who welcomed daughter Marlowe in July 2012 with ex-fiancé Tom Sturridge, told Porter magazine in May 2016 that, while she doesn’t see Law often, “I care about him enormously.”\n\nCredit: Ron Galella/WireImage.com\n\nNicole Kidman and Tom Cruise\n\nKidman and Cruise first met on the set of Days of Thunder in 1990, and later split in 2001 after 11 years of marriage, during which time they adopted daughter Bella and son Connor. The Aussie actress opened up about their time together in a rare piece penned for New York magazine. “I got married very young, but it definitely wasn’t power for me — it was protection,” she wrote in October 2018. \"I married for love, but being married to an extremely powerful man kept me from being sexually harassed. I would work, but I was still very much cocooned. So when I came out of [the marriage] at 32, 33, it’s almost like I had to grow up.”\n\nCruise went on to marry Katie Holmes in November 2006, seven months after their daughter, Suri, was born, but divorced in 2012. Meanwhile, Kidman married musician Keith Urban in June 2006 and the couple are parents of daughters Sunday and Faith.\n\nCredit: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nTori Spelling and Dean McDermott\n\nSpelling and McDermott had eyes for only each other while filming the TV movie Mind Over Murder in 2005, though they were both married to different people at the time. After the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum and the Chopped Canada star divorced their respective partners, Charlie Shanian and Mary Jo Eustace, they married each other in May 2006. They have five children together: Liam, Stella, Hattie, Finn and Beau. (McDermott also shares son Jack with Eustace.)

They managed to put it behind them, however, with Spelling telling Us in May 2018, “My husband and I … really balance each other … We’re kind of that rock for each other.”"
