        "text": "The trailer for It Ends With Us, based on the novel by Colleen Hoover, premiered this morning. Right after Sony released it, I had to run to the dentist, where — ironically — my dentist asked me if I’d read It Ends With Us. I have not I told her, but I had watched the trailer before I’d left. She told me that she was not a fan of either the book or the sequel, It Starts with Us, but really liked Verity. I told her the movie stars Blake Lively, and she said that, though she didn’t love the book, she will definitely watch the movie because she loves Blake Lively, who she really liked in Age of Adaline, a movie I have almost no recollection of. She also said she loves A Dog’s Purpose, which is when I fully realized that our movie interests probably do not align. She’s an excellent dentist.\n\nAnd that’s my It Ends with Us story, which admittedly is not very good. The movie itself concerns a woman, played by Blake Lively, whose parents were abusive. She later gets involved in an abusive relationship with a neurosurgeon, played by Justin Baldoni, while the object of a childhood romance (played by Brandon Sklenar) is still in her life. The title — it ends with us — refers to the woman’s determination to end the cycle of abuse. It sounds like a Lifetime movie, but the book was hugely popular so I expect the movie will play well, too.\n\nJustin Baldoni, who plays the handsome but abusive neurosurgeon, is also the director. He may also be recognizable to many from his role on Jane the Virgin. In case you don’t recognize him out of context, the other guy — Brandon Sklenar — is from 1923, where he is very handsome. Jenny Slate is also in this, and so is Hasan Minhaj, for some reason.\n\nHere’s the trailer."
