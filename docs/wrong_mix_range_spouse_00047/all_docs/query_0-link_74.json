Her parents and siblings have all worked in the entertainment industry.[8][9]\n\nDuring her childhood, Lively accompanied her parents to the acting classes they taught, as they did not want to leave her with a babysitter. She said that watching her parents teach helped her learn the \"drills\" and gain confidence as she got older and began working in the industry.[9][10] She made her professional debut at age 10, when she appeared in the 1998 film Sandman, directed by Lively's father. She describes her role as a \"bit part\".[11] She was initially not particularly interested in acting and wanted to attend Stanford University.[6]\n\nShe attended Burbank High School, where she was a cheerleader, a member of the championship choir, and class president,.[12] Her elder brother asked his talent agent to send her on a few auditions during the summer months.[5] She was subsequently cast as Bridget in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) and filmed her scenes in between her junior and senior years of high school.[13]\n\nCareer[]\n\n2005–2006: Career beginnings[]\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was released in 2005. Lively's performance earned her a nomination for a Teen Choice Award for \"Choice Movie Breakout – Female.[14] In 2006, Lively co-starred with Justin Long in Accepted, and Lively had minor roles in the horror film, Simon Says. Accepted was not well received by critics, but Lively's performance was, earning her a 'Breakthrough Award' from Hollywood Life.[15] Lively starred in Elvis and Anabelle (2007) as Anabelle, a bulimic girl who hoped to win a beauty pageant. Lively said of getting into character for the role that she had \"shed serious weight\" for her height. She stated that that process was difficult for her because food is \"the No. 1 love of my life.\"[16] MovieLine.com praised her performance in the film and credited it as having been her \"breakthrough role\".[17]\n\n2007–2012: Gossip Girl[]\n\nLively was cast in The CW's series Gossip Girl, based on the novel series of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar, which premiered in September 2007. Already having deferred college for a year, Lively intended to turn the role down and become a student, but was told that she could attend college part-time while filming the show (she later said \"This is advice to anyone: when they say, 'We promise, but we can't put it in writing,' there's a reason they can't put it in writing\").[18] She played the role of Serena van der Woodsen in the teen drama until 2012 when the show ended.[19][20] Her first magazine cover was the November 2007 issue of CosmoGirl, where she discussed her time in high school and her career prior to Gossip Girl.[21]\n\nIn 2008, Lively reprised her role as Bridget in the sequel The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2. Similarly to the first film, Lively's performance was positively received by critics.[22][23] As of November 2008, the film had earned over $44 million at the box office.[24] In 2009, she appeared as Gabrielle DiMarco in the romantic comedy New York, I Love You, a sequel to the 2006 film Paris, je t'aime.

She appeared in a short film ad directed by Nicolas Winding Refn for the fragrance.[38]\n\n2013–present: Film career[]\n\nIn October 2013, Lively was named the new face of L'Oreal, marking her first major makeup campaign.[39] Lively starred in the film The Age of Adaline (2015), opposite Michiel Huisman and Harrison Ford, playing a woman who \"stops aging after recovering from a near-fatal accident.\"[40] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $65.7 million from a production budget of $25 million.[41] The Atlantic stated that Lively showed her \"potential as a leading lady\" primarily in the second half of the film, citing her \"clipped delivery and coy restraint\" as well as her \"capable perform[ance]\" within the emotional intensity of the film.[42] In 2016, Lively starred in the survival horror film The Shallows.[43] It received positive reviews and Lively's performance was praised by critics. That year, Lively also starred in Woody Allen's romantic comedy film, Café Society which premiered at the 69th Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim. Lively enjoyed her experience working with Allen stating, \"It's really cool to work with a director who's done so much, because he knows exactly what he wants\", adding that he was \"very empowering\".[44]\n\nLively starred opposite Jason Clarke in psychological drama All I See Is You (2016), which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to mixed reviews.[45] In 2018, Lively starred in the mystery-thriller A Simple Favor, alongside Anna Kendrick and Henry Golding, and directed by Paul Feig.[46] The film was released on September 14 and Lively's performance was acclaimed.[47] Variety wrote that \"She has her moments .. many of them physical ..

Wilson, and directed by Reed Morano.[49] The film was released by Paramount Pictures on January 31, 2020.[50] Variety noted Lively's performance as \"display[ing] a realistic near-incompetence in the face of danger [that] makes her relatable in ways very few cinematic assassins have ever been.\"[51]\n\nIn May 2021, it was announced that Lively will star in Lady Killer as the lead character, Josie Schuller.[52]\n\nOther ventures[]\n\nCelebrity homemaker[]\n\nLively describes herself as a \"foodie and cook\",[53] and has said Martha Stewart is her \"idol\".
