        "text": "Ryan Reynolds has always been vocal about his love for his wife, Blake Lively , and their three daughters. The Deadpool actor is the real super dad as she shows off his lovely family from time to time with nothing but sweet things to say about them. He once again repeats the same feat at the People’s Choice Awards in the most heartfelt speech we’ve ever heard, and we’re filled with admiration for Reynolds.\n\nKeep on reading for the details.\n\nReceiving The Icon Award\n\nThe Free Guy actor received the Icon Award at the 2022 People’s Choice Awards on Tuesday night and gave a special shout-out to Lively and their three daughters, including the fourth baby, who is on the way.\n\nHe referenced the upcoming birth of his fourth child and joked that if he missed the delivery (should it happen that night) he’d consider sleeping on Shania Twain’s amazing couch as the crowd laughed in unison.\n\nShining The Light On His Family\n\nThe actor joked about accepting the awards, compared it to feeling like he was at a funeral, and expressed his joy in receiving the Icon award.\n\nHe continued the speech by thanking his mom, three brothers, and his father who died a few years telling the crowd that he would have loved his grandchildren.\n\nCelebrating Reynolds’ Career\n\nThe star was announced as the award recipient back in November for his impressive contribution to the entertainment industry. He’s joining past award winners, including Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lopez, Halle Berry, and Melissa McCarthy.\n\nReynolds revealed to E! News that he felt “old” after hearing the news of his awards after a 30-year-long career. The 46-year-old actor said\n\nBlake And Ryan\n\nReynolds and Lively tied the knot in 2012 and welcomed three daughters, James,8, Inez,6, and Betty, 3. In September, the couple revealed they were expecting a fourth child and are excited about the arrival of their little one."
