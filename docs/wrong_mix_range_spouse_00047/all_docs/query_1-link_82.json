And while they remain protective of images of them on their most heartfelt occasion, they graciously let us share pictures of the elements we created together.\n\nThe Gown\n\nBlake’s cloudlike silk tulle gown featured a fitted bodice, illusion crystal beading on the shoulders, and rose-gold embroidery. Jeweler Lorraine Schwartz forged Ryan and Blake’s wedding bands.\n\nThe Bouquet\n\nWeddings‘ style director Kate Berry created Blake Lively’s lush bouquet of pink jasmine, andromeda, dusty miller, and blushing bride hydrangea. She dipped select petals in subtle rose-gold glitter to play up the embroidery of the same color on the bride’s couture ballgown by Marchesa.\n\nThe Dessert Table\n\nAn avid cook, crafter, and baker, Blake envisioned an abundant dessert table overflowing with their favorite treats. The focal point was their vanilla-and-sour-cream wedding cake with peach-apricot preserves and Earl Grey-milk chocolate buttercream made by Maggie Austin Cake in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nTheir Wedding Cake\n\nSweet Tooth\n\nThe lavish dessert table featured:\n\nS’mores Bars by Bakehouse Charleston\n\nEspresso Beans from Nuts.com.\n\nMini Blueberry Cheesecake Tartlets by Caviar & Bananas in Charleston\n\nTiny Lemon Tartlets with meringue toppings by Caviar & Bananas in Charleston\n\nFruit Jellies Various “Pates de Fruits” fromLa Maison du Chocolat\n\nLittle Cakes mini strawberry shortcakes by Caviar & Bananas in Charleston\n\n-Source: Martha Stewart Weddings\n\nCongratulations Blake & Ryan\n\nBREATHTAKING\n\nLove this picture\n\nSomeday…I’ll Get My Own Happy Ending\n\nAnd He Will Say…\n\n“I Belong With You,\n\nYou Belong With Me,\n\nYou’re My Sweetheart.”\n\n-The Lumineers\n\nBUT Until Then I’ll Live Vicariously Through Blake & Ryan\n\nXOXO"
