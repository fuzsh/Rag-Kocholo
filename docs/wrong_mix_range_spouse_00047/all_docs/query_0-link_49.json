        "text": "Actress Halle Bailey and YouTube star and musician Darryl Dwayne “DDG” Grandberry Jr. have been together for about a year and a half. But they have been aware of one another for much longer as two young people who came up in the entertainment business.\n\nThe pair were first romantically linked in January 2022, after they were seen together at Usher’s residency in Las Vegas. Things became official a few months later on Instagram, when DDG wished Bailey a happy birthday in a now-deleted video. He wrote at the time, “Happy Birthday to the beautifulest, the flyest, the sweetest ❤️ love you forever 🥺💎.”\n\nHere’s the complete timeline of their relationship so far.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nThe couple meet up in Las Vegas to see an Usher concert and footage taken of them by other concertgoers started circulating online. The event was so popular that the word “Usher” began trending on Twitter. The video shows DDG drinking a beverage as Bailey talked to him excitedly, seeming to exclaim, “Oh my god!” over what was taking place onstage.\n\nLater, the musician shared photos with the new couple on his Instagram Story, in which DDG has his arm around Bailey’s shoulders.\n\nJune 2022\n\nFor their red carpet debut, the couple attended the BET Awards together.\n\n“I have my boo with me today,” Bailey told Extra correspondent Rachel Lindsay at the event. “We’re so excited. We’re gonna have so much fun just supporting Chloe [for her solo performance]. It’ll be great!”\n\nShe added: “I was so nervous, like, we’re trying to figure out what to wear [and] all this stuff.”\n\nDDG made an appearance in a video with Bailey that month as well, in which they look very intimate and are doing some vocal warm-ups together.\n\n“Singing lessons with @DDG,”she wrote in the caption.\n\nAugust 2022\n\nThe couple attended Variety’s Power of Young Hollywood Event in L.A.\n\nOctober 2022\n\nThey attended the the 5th annual Wearable Art Gala.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nIn an interview with Essence, Bailey discussed how she has been a fan of DDG’s for a long time.\n\n“I’ve been a fan of his for years,” she said. “I grew up being on YouTube and would always see the young Black creators and was constantly inspired by them. He was one of them.”\n\nBailey had seen his videos in 2015, but explained she “forgot about him” for a while.\n\nShe added: “But then I saw that he was dropping music, and I really gravitated toward this one song. Coincidentally he messaged me—and the rest is history.”\n\nDecember 2022\n\nDDG accompanied Bailey to the premiere of Avatar 2: The Way of Water.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nIn February 2023, fans started speculating about their relationship after DDG’s ex-girlfriend Rubi Rose tweeted about seeing her ex’s new girlfriend wear her old clothes in a tweet. She didn’t mention either DDG or Bailey by name, but it was quickly noted that Bailey was wearing a black and white T-shirt in an Instagram post that Rose had been seen in back in 2020.\n\nDDG added fuel to the fire when he unfollowed Bailey and tweeted, “All these girls the same, ain’t no way.”\n\nHe later clarified that no cheating had gone down.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, Bailey also addressed the rumors, writing, “The devil is working lol Please don’t feel into the lies, especially from a third party.

I like the suspense, the not knowing what’s going to happen, and I feel like that’s what I’m supposed to be going through in womanhood.”\n\nBut it hasn’t been easy to manage her private life while her star was rising, particularly with the focus she received during press for Disney's live action remake of The Little Mermaid.\n\n“There’s a lot of eyes on me now, especially with what’s to come,” she said. “And sometimes I wish I didn’t have so many eyes on me, especially experiencing something like this for the first time.”\n\nMay 2023\n\nIn May, as the work of promoting her Disney film wound down, Bailey shared a TikTok of herself kissing her boyfriend, writing in the caption, “On my last day of press like…”\n\nJuly 2023\n\nOn July 14, DDG faced considerable backlash after the release of his new song “Famous,” which seem to take aim at Bailey’s press tour for her role as Ariel in The Little Mermaid.\n\n“Filmin’ a movie now you kissing dudes / You know I love you a lot / I don’t give a f--k if that s--t for promo / I don’t wanna see this s--t no more,” the lyrics go. “Why is y’all holdin’ hands in the photo? / You know I’m insecure, that’s a no-no.”\n\nShe held hands with co-star Jonah Hauer-King in May, the Prince Eric to her mermaid at the London premiere of their movie. DDG went on in his song to say:\n\n“Fall in love, I hate that s--t / Knockin’ me off my grind, I can’t f--k with relationships/ I ain’t even got enough time in a day for me to chase a bitch / I don’t even ask for much, I ask you to do the basic s--t / Hardest thing I did was fall in love with a famous b-tch.”\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nEarly in September, Bailey and DDG attended the The Love Album listening party in New York City together.\n\nThey also made appearances at several fashion shows during Milan Fashion Week, first at Dolce & Gabbana for the brand’s spring/summer 2024 collection.\n\nThey were also seen at the Gucci Ancora show on September 22 seated next to Hanni from NewJeans.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nBailey and DDG attended the Glamour Women of The Year Awards in London together, where The Little Mermaid star was being honored.
