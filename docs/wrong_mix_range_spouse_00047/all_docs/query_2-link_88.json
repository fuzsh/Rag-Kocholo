Wonderfulllll,” DuVernay commented.\n\n“Congrats you two!!! Beautiful!!” The Rock wrote, adding a few clapping hand emojis.\n\nNaomi Campbell, Taraji P. Henson and Questlove all fell for the prank as well, chiming in with well wishes for the couple.\n\nBerry had fun responding to a few comments on the post, especially from confused fans. “It’s official.. it’s 2022. Isn’t that what this post is saying?” one follower asked, to which Berry replied, “Yeeesssss!!”\n\nThe actress also pinned a comment from filmmaker Oge Egbuonu that read, “I’m [gonna] need some of y’all to scroll to the left,” to help the confused viewers figure it out.\n\nOn Sunday, Berry set the record straight in a new post shared to Instagram.\n\n“We were just having some New Year’s Day fun! People clearly don’t swipe as much as we thought they did ??” she explained in her caption. “Thank you for the well wishes, tho’, it really touched our hearts!”\n\nShe added, “Now it’s OFFICIAL, the internet is no longer undefeated. #nomoreswipes4me #Januaryfoolsday.”\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress and Hunt have been dating since 2020.\n\nShe made the relationship Instagram-official in September of that year by posting a pic of herself wearing one of his T-shirts.\n\nWhile Berry and Hunt haven’t actually tied the knot, the actress has walked down the aisle three times before meeting the singer.\n\nShe was previously married to baseball player David Justice from 1993 to 1997, singer Eric Benét from 2001 to 2005, and actor Olivier Martinez from 2013 to 2016.\n\nBerry and Martinez share an 8-year-old son, Maceo. She also has a daughter, 13-year-old Nahla, from a long-term relationship with model Gabriel Aubry.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunt has an 18-year-old son from a previous relationship. He has never been married."
