        "text": "Blake Lively and her baby bump hit the red carpet\n\nWestchester resident Blake Lively was pregnant at glowing at the God's Love We Deliver, Golden Heart Awards in Manhattan on Thursday.\n\nIt was the first red carpet appearance for the actress and entrepreneur since she announced that she is expecting her first child with her movie star husband Ryan Reynolds.\n\nLively dressed her baby bump in a glittering champagne gown. Reynolds was not in a attendance, but designer Michael Kors, who designed her dazzling dress, filled in to walk the mother-to-be down the red carpet.\n\nLively sat next to Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who received an award for outstanding community service. The former 'Gossip Girl' star spent the rest of the night mingling with fellow celebs including Halle Berry and Jamie King.\n\nWhat do you think of the Bedford beauty's maternity fashion? Tell us in the comments.\n\nAlso see: Oh, baby! How the internet reacted to Blake Livelyâ€™s pregnancy\n\nPhoto: Getty"
