        "text": "Marc Forster has made a $200 million James Bond movie (Quantum of Solace), an apocalyptic blockbuster starring Brad Pitt (World War Z), and a fantasy film about a guy whose disembodied voice narrates his own life (Stranger than Fiction). But several years back, the filmmaker decided he wanted to do “something daring.” So he made a small, stirring thriller-drama starring Blake Lively as a blind woman.\n\n“I was reading similar scripts over and over, and I was thinking to myself that everyone is kind of making these big franchise movies or these stories that kind of repeat themselves,” Forster explained in an interview on Monday at the Toronto International Film Festival. “I felt like screaming as a filmmaker. I wanted to do something daring where there was the possibility that I might fail but at least it was on something that’s original and different.”\n\nHe also knew that he wanted to tell a story from a woman’s perspective.\n\n“I love strong female characters,” Forster said. “Women are much stronger than men. There are very few great female roles in Hollywood and I’m a big advocate for creating strong women on-screen,” Forster said, noting that he has another female-centric script he’s considering making next. “I think women are much more complex than men. They have many more shades and more depth.”\n\nWith those parameters in mind, Forster waited for inspiration—and it eventually came to him in the shower.\n\n“I had all of this soap in my eyes, and opened them up, and I started thinking to myself, what happens if someone who is able to see loses their sight?” Forster said. “I started researching that and became obsessed. I talked to people who had their sight and lost their sight, and I thought about what that do to a relationship.”\n\nAll I See Is You, which Forster wrote with Sean Conway, is a fascinating relationship study that marks Lively’s latest step toward movie stardom. Lively stars as Gina, a blind woman living with her husband (Jason Clarke) in Bangkok. (Forster found financing in Asia, which worked because he had always envisioned the couple as expats—adding to Gina’s isolation.) Gina regains partial sight after a miracle surgery, and the film examines how she and her marriage evolve once she literally gains this new perspective.\n\nAfter Lively read and liked the script, the actress invited Forster to the home she shares with her husband, Ryan Reynolds, in Connecticut. Forster said he did not end up casting her based on any of her previous performances as much as he did on instinct.\n\n“When I met her it was in the barn—she has a barn that is turned into a guest house, and it has these cool paintings and old leather sofas,” Forster said. “We mainly talked about character, and she was just incredibly passionate. We just met and connected immediately. What I love about Blake is how she is just growing and growing as an actress. There is something so smart and mature about her. She reminds me of these really beautiful, classy movie stars from the 70s like Julie Christie and Faye Dunaway.”\n\n“We both really understood, I have a partner who I can go on an artistic journey with,” Forster explained. “We kind of made each other better than we would have been if we were alone. It was very daring for her in the case of there being nudity and rawness, so there were many things for her to deal with.”\n\nForster encouraged Lively to contribute her own ideas to the film, which artfully gives audiences a view through Gina’s eyes, courtesy of cinematographer Matthias Koenigswieser’s gauzy, distorted shots. When Lively suggested that a song her character sings in the film be incorporated into more of the story, which Forster does beautifully in the film’s final moments, the director commissioned a friend to write lyrics that applied to the character’s marriage. Forster had no idea whether Lively could sing when he cast her and figured, worst case scenario, he could always dub someone else’s voice for the song. That ended up not being necessary.\n\n“Suddenly we were in a studio in L.A.,” Forster said of the recording session, “and she is in front of a mic and she starts singing. The studio was Babyface’s, and he came in and was suddenly standing there saying, ‘She’s great! She needs no help.’”\n\nOnce filming wrapped, Lively showed Forster that she is more than an accomplished actress and surprisingly talented singer—she’s also an incredible gift giver.\n\n“She gave me a wristband from a jeweler she knew, made of little stones and one of the stones is her blue eye. She had her iris photographed, and they [imprinted] it into this bracelet. Isn’t that the best gift ever? I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’” Forster said, revealing that he had commissioned a painting for her that ended up paling in comparison to her gift. “I was embarrassed.’”\n\nAll I Can See Is You does not yet have a distributor or release date—and, in spite of positive reviews out of TIFF, Forster is realistic about the market for a small, thoughtful movie like his in Hollywood’s current franchise-focused climate.\n\n“With a movie like this, you creatively do something daring, something interesting, and it’s artistically incredibly fulfilling, but you need to still sell the movie and get it out there,” Forster explained. “It’s a risky endeavor. That’s what pushes the medium forward, and I think it’s important for me to switch it up. No matter whether the film is successful or fails, it makes me grow as a filmmaker.”\n\nPortraits from the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival\n\n1 / 51"
