        "text": "Halle Berry has been on a high following the release of her boyfriend Van Hunt's new single, Our Love Lingers, and she's been paying several tributes to him on social media ever since.\n\nThe Hollywood star took to Instagram over the weekend to post a picture of Van looking happy and relaxed while lounging on an armchair at their beach home, with a beautiful view of the ocean in the background.\n\nAlso in the background was a very lifelike mannequin standing tall and poised while staring out of the window, and at first glance, many followers mistook it for Halle herself!\n\n\"I thought that was Halle in the background. Had to Zoom in cuz Halle wasn’t looking right,\" one wrote, while another commented: \"I need glasses, I was wondering how Halle could be standing so still in the background.\" A third added: \"Zoomed in on the statue. Had to make sure that wasn't Halle.\"\n\nVan's recent music success has been cheered on by Halle in a number of ways, and the doting girlfriend paid a sweet tribute to him on Friday after the news was out that he had been given his own label.\n\nShe wrote: \"About damn time, @vanhunt! You’re so deserving of your OWN LABEL and I’m so proud of your music and your journey. You continue to do it your way and sometimes that can be a lonely road. Help me celebrate my man today y’all, cuz our love is going to linger forever!\"\n\nHalle and Van have been dating since 2020, and sparked marriage rumors in January 2022 after sharing a photo of themselves kissing in a chapel.\n\nClearing up their alleged union hours later, Halle penned: \"We were just having some New Year’s Day fun! People clearly don’t swipe as much as we thought they did. Thank you for the well wishes, tho', it really touched our hearts. Now it's OFFICIAL, the internet is no longer undefeated #nomoreswipes4me #Januaryfoolsday,\" alongside a selfie with Van.\n\nHalle's son Maceo has definitely made it clear he would love the couple to walk down the aisle and gave them their very own \"commitment ceremony\" whilst in the car.\n\nTalking to AARP Magazine, Halle revealed: \"My son, Maceo, of his own volition, did this little commitment ceremony for us in the back seat of the car,\" \"I think he finally sees me happy, and it's infectious. It was his way of saying, 'This is good. I like this. This makes me happy.'\"\n\nShe added: \"It was a very real moment for all of us. I teared up, Van was fighting back tears. Even Maceo knew he’d said something poignant. It meant a lot to us.\n\nRead more HELLO! US stories here"
