They had a new Dell Sonicwall put into place in their main office about 2 weeks ago and since then printing has stopped working. I cannot ping the printer from the server getting “Request timed out” message. Checked printer on local site is on and can print to it from a PC on the same site as the printer.\n\nDo i need to setup rule on the firewall to allow printing to that printer and if so how can i do this?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nYes they are in two different location. They had a Zyxell in place which failed since then a Sonicwall was put in place and printing has stopped working, printing was working before which leads me think its a setting somewhere on the new firewall.\n\nNo VPN in place.\n\nIs there anyone who knows how this was set up?\n\nIf not we need to know the following:\n\nAre you 100% sure there was no vpn before? what’s the firewall on the other side? can you access old Zyxel?\n\nYou will need to have access to firewalls at both locations to set up site to site vpn. You will also need external ips (I assume they are static) and local network ranges on both sides.\n\nhttps://support.software.dell.com/kb/sw5857\n\nNot sure who set it up it was before we took over the contract.\n\nJust emailing a user on site main office has Sonicwall, office with printer has a Zyxell firewall also has 2 PC’s connected one for remote access to head office and one for internet access.\n\nCan i setup a site to site VPN between the Sonicwall and Zyxell?\n\nI think you should update, this title or open another thread. You need more than how to open a port on the Sonicwall.\n\nYour original post stated \" They had a new Dell Sonicwall put into place in their main office about 2 weeks ago \".\n\nThis leads me to believe you don’t have access, or there are IT people that installed the Sonicwall without your input.\n\nAnyway you you can setup a site to site VPN. It’s likely going to be an ipsec VPN between devices, but you will likely need to know a bit more about the Sonicwall, or get the IT people who installed it to assist.\n\nhttp://www.zyxeltech.de/snotezw5_362/app/zw_sw.htm"
