        "text": "Dell SonicWALL SonicOS 6.2.6\n\nWith the announcement of the general availability of SonicOS 6.2.6 firmware, SonicWALL Capture is the industry’s first multi-engine sandbox that enables customers to block suspicious files until a verdict is reached. Additionally, SonicOS 6.2.6 features an enhanced Content Filtering Service that gives organisations the power to easily enforce protection and productivity policies to control access to inappropriate or unproductive web content. Available for use with SonicWALL TZ, NSA and SuperMassive 9000 series firewalls, SonicOS 6.2.6 with SonicWALL Capture protects customers from today’s most advanced threats, including zero-day attacks. Malicious code authors have developed techniques allowing malware to detect the presence of existing sandboxes and use this information to evade detection. To combat these techniques, SonicWALL Capture utilises three technically different cloud-based threat analysis sandboxing engines, making evasion almost impossible. Capture also has the ability to accept the broadest range of file sizes and types and can be configured to block suspicious files from entering the system until a verdict is reached. Angel Torres, CIO of Credit Services, Inc. reports, “The new SonicWALL Capture service is another key addition to the suite of security tools that help us battle the new challenges that we face on a daily basis. By providing this new service, it feels like we have a partner working with us in the fight to keep our system secured. By preventing malicious files from entering our system, it helps keep our clients and our company more secure from new threats as they emerge.” “We did some evaluations of other sandbox solutions, but SonicWALL Capture was the easiest to implement and most cost-effective to license and manage. Because it’s offered as an upgrade to our firewall and only requires a firmware update, testing and eventual deployment into a production environment was really easy. We are looking at utilising this at our other sites as we focus on multiple, layered approaches to security,” stated Zachary A. Radke of Santa Fe Senior Living.\n\nSonicWALL Content Filtering Service 4.0\n\nThe new SonicWALL Content Filtering Service 4.0 available in SonicOS 6.2.6 enables IT to enforce protection and productivity policies and block inappropriate, unproductive and illegal web content from the network. Key new features in this version include: Block-page override, Bandwidth Management and Confirm actions ‒ In addition to the current allow and block methods, CFS 4.0 also offers block-page override (passphrase), bandwidth management, and confirm actions, giving administrators additional controls to individual domain categories. These five methods are configurable at the policy level (versus a global setting). This can enable educational institutions, for example, to personalise the teaching experience for specific schools, classrooms or groups of users behind a firewall, empowering teachers and IT administrators to facilitate a better and more productive learning experience. YouTube Restricted mode ‒ Similar to parental controls, YouTubeRestricted mode helps inhibit the search for, or access to, inappropriate videos based on YouTube’s proprietary technology. “The SonicWALL CFS version 4.0 has given us more power over the filtering system by allowing us to control the priority of the policies,” said George Morris, IT Administrator at Peru Community Schools. “This lets us set multiple allow or deny rules and have users with multiple policies, and still maintain complete accuracy of the outcome. We view these enhancements as proof that the best just got even better.”\n\nSonicOS 6.2.6 Availability\n\nSonicWALL SonicOS 6.2.6 will be generally available August 1. SonicWALL Capture ATP Service will be available for SonicWALL SuperMassive 9000 series, NSA firewalls and select TZ firewall models August 1. Current customers should contact their account representatives."
