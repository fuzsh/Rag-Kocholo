        "text": "Under private equity ownership, SonicWall has rapidly accelerated its R&D and built SMB partner program momentum over the last 18 months or so. Now, the security company is accelerating its push far beyond firewalls while also introducing a midmarket sales strategy that include direct-touch engagements.\n\nIt's important to note that \"direct touch\" is not to be confused with an aggressive direct sales model. Rather, it means a SonicWall direct sales team will assist partners with midmarket engagements -- supporting customers that want to hear directly from the security company's R&D team and more, CEO Bill Conner tells MSSP Alert. Moreover, the pure SMB channel sales model remains in place, he notes.\n\nConner and two if his key lieutenants -- VP of Product Management Lawrence Pingree and Senior VP, COO Atul Dhablania -- described those moves and more during an MSSP Alert briefing call yesterday.\n\nSonicWall: Growing Cybersecurity Product Portfolio\n\nAs part of overall SMB and midmarket push, SonicWall also has integrated 12 new products and solutions into its Capture Cloud Platform. MSSPs essentially gain a single pane of glass to mange SonicWall-related products and services.\n\nNotable Capture Cloud upgrades include:\n\nCapture Cloud is a cloud-based platform that integrates next-generation endpoint, firewall and cloud application security with management, reporting, analytics and cyber threat visibility, SonicWall stated. It delivers cloud-scale management and end-to-end security, the company said, and enables organizations to protect their networks, email, endpoints and mobile and remote users against cyberattacks.\n\nSonicWall Revamps Its Go-to-Market Strategy\n\nIn addition to releasing new enterprise-focused solutions, SonicWall plans to update the following product lines and services:\n\nSonicWall will engage with organizations in retail, higher education, state, local and federal government and other key verticals, the company indicated. The company also will continue to focus on its partnership with Dell while building and expanding its relationships with MSSPs.\n\nSonicWall Midmarket Position\n\nBest known in the SMB sector, SonicWall also has a solid midmarket presence. The company has roughly 300 customers in the midmarket sector -- and each of those customers has roughly 2,500 or more employees, Conner notes.\n\nHe estimates that four SonicWall rivals have a larger midmarket presence, but believes the company can take market share thanks to its strong R&D momentum and commitment to carrier-class services for MSSPs. As two proof points, he mentions that the R&D team has delivered more than 160 million lines of quality code in less than two years, and the company security operating system truly is a single code base that spans all SonicWall solutions.\n\nMoreover, the MSSP dashboard is multi-tenant for service providers and their underlying customers, Dhablania notes. It sounds somewhat akin to the Sophos MSP Connect program, which also provides a multi-tenant approach for partners.\n\nWhat Is SonicWall?\n\nSonicWall was a Dell subsidiary that was sold to private equity firms Francisco Partners and Elliott Management in November 2016. Since that time, SonicWall has exceeded its financial objectives for six consecutive quarters and recorded a 90-plus percent customer renewal rate in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nFurthermore, SonicWall recapitalized its security business last month and now operates as a standalone business. SonicWall completed its recap with oversubscribed investor interest.\n\nSonicWall offers advanced threat protection, firewall and other security products to more than 500,000 organizations worldwide. The company also works with more 26,000 channel partners worldwide.\n\nAdditional insights from Joe Panettieri."
