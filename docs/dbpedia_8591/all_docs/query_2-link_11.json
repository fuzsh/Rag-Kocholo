I have 2 users using the GroupVPN to work from home using the Sonicwall VPN client. This is working fine and they can get to the resources they need in their primary office. Below is the breakdown:\n\nAll Firewalls are connected with site to site VPNs\n\nUser A belongs to site #4\n\nCorporate Office is site #1\n\nRDS server resides in site #1\n\nUser A connects to VPN with client and can access all of site #4 resources and programs\n\nUser A puts in web address of RDS server to run an app from site #1 and gets a “this page cannot be displayed” error.\n\nHere is the issue User A cannot connect to the RD Web server in Site #1 when connected to VPN to site #4. If User A disconnects from VPN to site #4 then they can connect to RD Web server from site #1. When User A is actually onsite at site #4, they can connect to RD Web server from site #1.\n\nUser A user account on the sonicwall is set for VPN access to LAN Subnets. I am thinking this may be the issue, but I am not sure exactly how to reconfigure the user account to have access to site #1 resources without exposing too many security issues. Thoughts?\n\nI’ll add that SonicWall support has been very good at sorting out issues for me in the past. If you contact them, they might sort this out in 15 minutes.\n\nWith site to site VPN connections being used for global VPN users, you’ll want to not only have each site able to communicate with the others (as licensing allows - if not, you’re going to have a more elaborate setup), but also ensure that the IP addresses being assigned to remote VPN users are allowed to leave the network they connect to and be received by the network you want them to find. This means configuring each side of the connection to accept and allow that communication. It makes sense if you think about it, but at first glance you’d think “Hey, they’re being let into the network, they should be all set”\n\nErik,\n\nYou might be on to something. So would that be a LAN → LAN rule that I would need to setup, or a VPN → LAN rule on the destination firewall? What are you thoughts? I thought it would work the way I have it since site #4 traffic can get to Site #1, however when using a VPN remotely the firewall must not be able to route the traffic between the 2 VPNs. I might have to contact Sonicwall on this, I just figured someone here may have already dealt with something similiar.\n\nThanks"
