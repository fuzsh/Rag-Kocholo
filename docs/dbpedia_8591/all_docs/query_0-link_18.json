        "text": "Dell, Inc. is juggling so many cybersecurity brands itâ€™s hard to keep track. If it gets too confusing, then CIOs, CISOs (chief information security officers) and IT security buyers may back off the Dell cyber products and services until they hear a cohesive message from the tech giant.\n\nNTT Data Deal\n\nNTT Data said yesterday it has agreed to buy Dell Inc.'s information technology services division for more than $3 billion. That division includes Dell's Information Security Services which provides risk assessment and management, compliance, and other cybersecurity services. It's hard to tell exactly which of these services may be a part of Dell's SecureWorks (see below). What stays with Dell and what goes to NTT as it relates to cybersecurity products, services, and people? Dell formed the IT services division when it acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 billion in 2009.\n\nSecureWorks\n\nDell's SecureWorks provides managed security services and operates as a separate business. Last year Dell filed confidentially for an IPO of SecureWorks. In December they filed a registration statement for the proposed IPO. There hasn't been much news about the IPO since then. The company intends to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol SCWX. Dell acquired SecureWorks in 2011 for roughly $600 million.\n\nRSA\n\nThen there's Dell's pending $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp., which brings with it the RSA brand -- a market leading and well respected multi-hundred-million-dollar cybersecurity product vendor and service provider. When the EMC deal closes, where will RSA go? Some of RSA's solutions overlap with Dell's Information Security Services, but that group is going to NTT. Other solutions overlap with SecureWorks. RSA is arguably more valuable than SecureWorks. Will Dell file for another IPO with RSA as its own business? Or will RSA fold into SecureWorks at some point down the line?\n\nSonicWALL\n\nSonicWALL is Dell's network security business -- providing firewall, intrusion detection, mobile security, and email security products and services. Dell acquired SonicWALL in 2012 in a deal that was reported to be worth roughly $1.2 billion - twice what they paid for SecureWorks a year earlier. The same questions about RSA apply to SonicWALL.\n\nDell needs to help the market understand how all of its cyber pieces fit together -- Dell corporate, EMC, RSA, SecureWorks, and SonicWALL. If not, then Dell's cybersecurity brands may be at risk of losing value due to market confusion.\n\nVisit SteveOnCyber.com to read all of my blogs and articles covering cybersecurity."
