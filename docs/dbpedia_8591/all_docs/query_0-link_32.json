        "text": "Our team has successfully implemented Dellâ¢ SonicWALLâ¢ Next-Generation Firewalls for more than 100 clients in Qatar.\n\nDellâ¢ SonicWALLâ¢ Next-Generation Firewalls, deliver superior intrusion prevention, malware protection, application intelligence and control, real-time traffic visualization and inspection for SSL encrypted sessions at the gateway by tightly integrating a patented Reassembly-Free Deep Packet InspectionÂ®1 engine with multi-core hardware. Essential to an intelligent and highly adaptive security system, Dell SonicWALL Next-Generation Firewalls scan every byte of every packet for the deepest level of network protection and, unlike competitive offerings, massively scale to extend state-of-the-art security to growing and distributed enterprise networks. Dell SonicWALL firewalls provide a comprehensive layer of defense by combining gateway content filtering, anti-spam, anti-virus, anti-spyware, intrusion prevention, and regain visibility into the network through application intelligence and visualization.\n\nVirtual Private Networking (VPN) technology by Dellâ¢ SonicWALLâ¢ makes it easy for administrators to establish a secure and extensive VPN that is easy to manage and administer. For secure site-to-site communication, Dell SonicWALL firewalls include integrated IPSec VPN, and for remote client-to-host secure access, Dell SonicWALL offers both SSL VPN and IPSec VPN connectivity options. Dell SonicWALL also makes a complete line of Secure Remote Access/SSL VPN appliances, which offer remote access and management capabilities to organizations of all sizes with varying network complexities and security requirements.\n\nAs an add-on service for Dell SonicWALL firewalls, CASS (Comprehensive Anti-Spam Service) eliminates inbound junk email at the gateway, before it enters the network. CASS is ideal for smaller organizations and distributed enterprises of up to 250 users that receive email at multiple locations and need gateway-based inbound email protection to reduce network traffic.\n\nDell SonicWaLL Firewall is now the most preferred UTM in the local market and you can always get the best deployment of this product from our Team."
