        "text": "MECHANICSBURG, Pa., July 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Dell SonicWALL -- a leader in advanced network security, secure remote access, email security, backup and recovery, and management and reporting -- has completed ICSA Labs' next-generation firewall evaluation. After thorough testing, ICSA Labs reports that the capabilities evaluated for the Dell SonicWALL E-Class Network Security Appliance Series function securely, with a high percentage of coverage.\n\nNext-generation firewalls provide an extended level of access control by monitoring network communications at the application layer. This includes granular application identification and control, user-based authentication and identification, and protection from botnets and sophisticated malware.\n\n\"For evaluating and reporting the integrity of our next-generation firewall products, we chose ICSA Labs because of its excellent reputation, expertise and comprehensive understanding of the technology,\" said Matthew Dieckman, product line manager at Dell SonicWALL. \"ICSA Labs' thorough testing and profound reporting provide our customers the credible and respected third-party validation they require and deserve.\"\n\nThe E-Class NSA Series is already certified under ICSA Labs' Network Firewall –Enterprise testing program. This certification verifies the products' fundamental network firewall functionality. The additional completed next-generation firewall evaluation by ICSA Labs takes the existing certification to an advanced level of technology verification in the market.\n\nICSA Labs evaluated these essential features and reported the following results:\n\nApplication Identification and Control – 100 percent coverage achieved.\n\nUser-based Authentication – 100 percent of requirements met.\n\nMalware Protection – 100 percent coverage achieved.\n\nUser-Side Protection – 98.3 percent coverage achieved.\n\nServer-Side Protection – 94.6 percent coverage achieved.\n\nNo False Positives.\n\n\"Dell SonicWALL was first to attain ICSA Labs' Network Firewall – Enterprise certification. It is no surprise that the company is also the first to pursue this important next-generation firewall evaluation,\" said Brian Monkman, ICSA Labs' Perimeter Security Programs manager. \"For more than a decade, Dell SonicWALL has been committed to product testing with ICSA Labs, to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of its solutions through a widely acknowledged third-party evaluation.\"\n\nAlex Dubrovsky, director of software engineering and threat research, Dell SonicWALL, said: \"During the course of my career, I have worked with a number of testing labs. The rigorous and demanding testing of our products by ICSA Labs goes well beyond anything we have experienced with other labs. Where others might be afraid to see their products fail, we actually encourage this thorough testing because it confirms to our customers that our products are in fact the best and most reliable next-generation firewalls money can buy.\"\n\nThe detailed evaluation report can be found on the ICSA Labs website at https://www.icsalabs.com/swl-ngfw.\n\nAbout ICSA Labs\n\nICSA Labs, an independent division of Verizon, offers third-party testing and certification of security and health IT products, as well as network-connected devices, to measure product compliance, reliability and performance for many of the world's top security vendors.
