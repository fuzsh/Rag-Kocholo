Today, SonicWall announced four new firewalls, the NSa (note that the ‘a’ is not capitalized) 2700, the TZ270, TZ370, and TZ470. The new firewalls are in addition to the two other x70 firewalls, the TZ570 and the TZ670, they announced earlier this year. SonicWall was founded in 1991. SonicWall was a Dell subsidiary from 2012 to 2016 and currently focuses on network security.

The SonicWall NSa 2700 will be the first mid-level appliance SonicWall has released since the company released SonicOs 7.0 earlier this year. That means it will also be the first SonicWall mid-level appliance to ship with SonicOS 7.0 already installed. SonicWall currently has eight other firewalls, shown above, in their mid-range product line. The closest point of comparison is probably the SonicWall NSa 2650, which has a 1.3 Gbps or better throughput and can support up to 48 access points.

The other three firewalls SonicWall announced today are all in their entry-level, TZ, line. The TZ270, TZ370, and TZ470 are all targeted at small or medium businesses (SMBs). The company is billing all three as 5G and LTE ready. The company usually uses the first digit in their TZ family models to indicate the number of access points each appliance can support. If that pattern holds true for the new models, the TZ270 will support four access points, the TZ370 will support eight access points, and the TZ470 will support sixteen access points. The previous TZ2xx and TZ3xx have all had 5x1GbE, 1 USB, and 1 Console interface, so I would be surprised if these new models are any different. If that pattern holds true for the new TZ470 as well, it will have 7x1GbE, 1 USB, and 1 Console interface like the TZ400.
