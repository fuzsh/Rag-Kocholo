        "text": "‘Anything Else‘ is the 33rd film written and directed by Woody Allen.\n\nWoody Allen stars as David Dobel, a mentor to the true star, Jason Biggs who plays Jerry Falk, a young writer. His life is a bunch of Allen film tropes – in love with a difficult woman, he’s in analysis, he struggles with his creativity and the basic day to day of getting through modern life. That woman in his life is Amanda Chase, brought to startling life by Christina Ricci.\n\n‘Anything Else’ News Stories (show all)\n\nFilming Locations for EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU - New York, Paris, Venice\n\nCOUP DE CHANCE Sets Venice Film Festival premiere on 2 September\n\nWoody Allen’s 90s and 00s Films Arrive On Blu-Ray In New Box Set\n\nThe Woody Allen Film Guide eBooks are Free For Limited Time Tomorrow\n\nThe Woody Allen Film Guide Volume 3: 2003-2019 Is Out, Free On Kindle\n\nGet The Woody Allen Film Guide Volume One For Free\n\nScreenshots\n\nPublicity Images\n\nCast & Crew\n\nAllen originally thought Jason Biggs was Jewish (he’s Catholic). Biggs was actually starring in a stage revival of ‘The Graduate‘ at night, and filming during the day.\n\nErica Leerhsen‘s second Allen film in a row. She would appear in one more – Magic In the Moonlight.\n\nCarlo Di Palma came out of retirement to be cinematographer for this film, but he was unable to pass the insurance test. Darius Khondji was hired instead, a fruitful collaboration that would lead to another five films together.\n\nDiana Krall makes a cameo as herself. In 2015, she revealed she forgotten what the name of this film.\n\nTrivia\n\nThis is loosely based on Woody Allen’s experiences of being a young comedy writer, he married young, and met an older man who taught him a lot about life, comedy, philosophy, and was institutionalised.\n\nOnly the second Woody Allen film to be shot in anamorphic widescreen (the first being Manhattan). Which is a shame because this film looks gorgeous.\n\nLocations (show map)\n\nShot in Manhattan, New York.\n\nTrailer\n\nGallery\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
