        "text": "“Manhattan,” Woody Allen’s cinematic love letter to his hometown, was released in 1979 and nominated for two Academy Awards the following year. But you would think it belonged to the 2018 awards season, given how much it is being quoted and discussed these days.\n\nThere was Seth Meyers, who hosted the Golden Globes in January, inserting a “Manhattan” joke into his opening monologue.\n\nLast November, the writer Claire Dederer published a 5,000-word, much-talked-about essay in The Paris Review in which she re-examined “Manhattan,” a movie she had been “unable to watch” for years.\n\nTalking about the year in film, meanwhile, Greta Gerwig, who is nominated for two Oscars at the Academy Awards ceremony this Sunday as the writer and director of “Lady Bird,” noted the way Mr. Allen’s movies, “Manhattan” among them, “have informed me as an artist.”\n\nWhy is a 39-year-old movie that isn’t available to stream on Netflix such a hot topic? The answer has everything to do with what else Ms. Gerwig said in an online interview conducted earlier this year by The Times. While she grew up on Mr. Allen’s movies, and acted in his 2012 film, “To Rome With Love,” in light of continued allegations of sexual abuse against the director, she said, “I will not work for him again.”\n\nNor will she bump into Mr. Allen at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, where this year’s Oscars will be held. For decades, he famously declined invitations to the event; he attended exactly once, the year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But even if Mr. Allen wants to go this year, he would hardly be welcome.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
