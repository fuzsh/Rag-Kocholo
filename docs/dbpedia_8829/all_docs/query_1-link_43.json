        "text": "He abandoned his studies of communication and film at the New Yorku University and started to write sketches and jokes for a living. He earned his first money for jokes at the age of fifteen and from mid 1950’s wrote them for many TV shows. During the 1960’s, as a standup comedian he developed his stage character of a neurotic intellectual whom he later used and portrayed by himself in different variations in his many films. He also wrote his first theatre plays, which he continued to do later as well. His first acting role was in the comedy for which he also wrote the What's New Pussycat (1965) directed by Clive Donner. Afterwards he bought the rights to the Japanese film by the director Senkichi Taniguchi wrote new dialogues, redubbed it, changed the story and published it under the title What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966). He made his real directing debut with the crime comedy Take the Money and Run (1969), for which he also wrote the screenplay and acted in the main role. After two successful comedies, Bananas (1971) and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask (1972), he directed the film Sleeper (1973), one of his many collaborations with the actress Diane Keaton. Others include Love and Death (1975), Annie Hall (1977), which was a great commercial success as well as received great critical acclaim, dramas Interiors (1978), Manhattan (1979) and Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993). Romantic comedy Annie Hall was his most successful film from the 1970’s (he won an Oscar for best film and screenplay, while Keaton was awarded an Oscar for best leading actress), while the drama Interiors marks his transit from his recognizable light comedies to more serious films in the 1980’s that he made under the influence of European directors whom he admired, such Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. The 1980’s were marked by his collaboration with actress Mia Farrow, also his partner in real life. He directed teen films with her: A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982), Zelig (1983), Broadway Danny Rose (1984), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), September (1987), Radio Days (1987), Another Woman (1988), New York Stories (1989), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), Alice (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991) and Husbands and Wives (1992). Some of his greatest films is Bullets Over Broadway (1994) starring Dianne Wiest who won an Oscar for best supporting role and Mighty Aphrodite (1995) starring Mira Sorvino, who won the same award. Afterwards he directed the romantic musical Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and the dark satire Deconstructing Harry (1997). He made a short return to his previously popular comedies with Small Time Crooks (2000). Afterwards he directed several commercially less successful and critically less acclaimed films, but soon achieved great success with the love drama Match Point (2005) that he considers one of his best films. He made is next two films, Scoop (2006) and Cassandra's Dream (2007) in London, but with less success. In Spain he directed the successful romantic drama Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), which won the Golden Globe as best film in category Musical or Comedy, and actress Penélope Cruz won an Oscar for her supporting role in it. Together with the writer and comedian Larry David in the main role, he directed the film Whatever Works (2009). He continued to collaborate with European producers who offer him the desired freedom, and directed Midnight in Paris (2011) that won the audience and critics’ sympathy alike. His next film, To Rome with Love (2012), was made in Italy and was less successful. He returned to the US to direct Blue Jasmine (2013) starring Cate Blanchett who won an Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA’s award. At the French Riviera he filmed Magic in the Moonlight (2014), and back in the US the humorous drama Irrational Man (2015) and his currently last film Café Society (2016). For Amazon Studios he directed and wrote the series in six episodes Crisis in Six Scenes (2016). Besides being an extremely productive filmmaker he writes plays for theatre, and is a great fan of jazz music. He has been playing the clarinet from an early age and occasionally performs with his jazz band."
