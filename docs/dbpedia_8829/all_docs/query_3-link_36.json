        "text": "Woody Allen doesn’t take one. But Quentin Tarantino? Always. And two of this year’s five best-director Oscar nominees have made it a habit as well. We’re talking about what Hollywood calls a possessory credit—“A film by,” or some variation thereof, rather than only the more prosaic “Directed by.” The battle over whether directors should use the possessory—better known in showbiz as the “vanity” credit—is an ongoing fount of backlot drama between directors and, well, most everyone else whose name scrolls by in a movie’s title sequence. When a director brands a film as his or hers, the argument goes, he or she diminishes the efforts of the some 500 cast and crewmembers’ creative contributions to an average studio picture while self-elevating their own status. The Directors Guild of America firmly supports its members—many of whom can indeed claim the mantle of auteur—dubbing the credit “recognition of the director’s primary role” in films. The vanity credit turned 100 this year, and the Academy Awards are just the beginning of the evidence that it’s alive and well.\n\nThis past Oscar season, the top two best-director contenders were on opposite sides of the credit as it appeared in the movie—“An Alejandro G. Iñárritu film” (Birdman) vs. “Written and directed by Richard Linklater” (Boyhood). We all know Iñárritu took home the statuette at February’s Oscars. And with 11 out of the last 15 best-director winners rocking the possessory credit, past races predict vanity will continue to win over humility.\n\nThe 2014 best-director nominees and their film credits:\n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) - An Alejandro G. Iñárritu film\n\nBoyhood – Written and directed by Richard Linklater\n\nFoxcatcher - A film by Bennett Miller\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel – Directed by Wes Anderson\n\nThe Imitation Game - Directed by Morten Tyldum\n\nPast best-director winners and their film credits:2000 Traffic - Directed by Steven Soderbergh\n\n2001 A Beautiful Mind - A Ron Howard film\n\n2002 The Pianist - A Roman Polanski film\n\n2003 The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King - Directed by Peter Jackson\n\n2004 Million Dollar Baby - Directed and produced by Clint Eastwood\n\n2005 Brokeback Mountain - An Ang Lee film\n\n2006 The Departed - A Martin Scorsese picture\n\n2007 No Country for Old Men - Written for the screen and directed by Joel Coen & Ethan Coen\n\n2008 Slumdog Millionaire - A Danny Boyle film\n\n2009 The Hurt Locker - A Kathryn Bigelow film\n\n2010 The King’s Speech - A film by Tom Hooper\n\n2011 The Artist - A film by Michel Hazanavicius\n\n2012 Life of Pi - An Ang Lee film\n\n2013 Gravity - An Alfonso Cuarón film\n\nA Brief History of the Vanity Credit\n\nThe “A film by” credit emerged back when directors favored jodhpurs and bullhorns. First seen on March 3, 1915, in The Birth of a Nation by D.W. Griffith, the possessory credit has since become a century-long tug-of-war in ego-driven Hollywood. Up until around 1913, most directors—like actors—were uncredited in films, a common practice producers employed to squelch raises. Then Griffith produced, co-wrote, directed, and edited what is widely seen as a landmark film—for both its racism and cinematic storytelling. Perhaps the director invented the vanity credit to make up for years of lost recognition, though Griffith did acknowledge his collaborators. Nation’s one-sheet advertised the film as “D.W. Griffith’s stupendous motion picture production of Thomas Dixon’s famous story,” and that the film employed “the services of 18,000 people.”\n\nThe credit then lay largely dormant for years. Films were usually possessed by the studio that payrolled for them—Paramount’s Double Indemnity or Singin’ in the Rain, MGM’s Technicolor musical treasure. And every so often a producer would pop up to claim credit (Samuel Goldwyn’s The Best Years of Our Lives). But the vanity credit didn’t truly take root until the rise of the auteur theory in the late 1950s. The not-quite-so-humble brag became almost de rigueur in the 1960s and 70s, when it’s widely agreed that visionary directors saved a Hollywood in post-studio system free fall with an artistic resurgence. Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) became Stanley Kubrick’s 2001:A Space Odyssey (1968).\n\nFilmmaker Steven Soderbergh rejects the label auteur, the French term that cinephiles appropriated to signify a director who has a distinct, recognizable style and is therefore the primary author of a film. Soderbergh also refuses to take top billing. Though he directs, shoots, and edits his movies, the anti-auteur uses fictitious names for the latter credits (like Mary Ann Bernard, a tribute to his mother). “I’ve never had a desire to be out in front of anything,” the director told SuicideGirls, “which is why I don’t take a possessory credit.”\n\nOn the other end of the director spectrum, Lee Daniels positions his name before a film’s title, forever branding it as his vision with a simple apostrophe. His punctuation mark has illustrious company. Before Lee Daniels’ The Butler, there were posters for Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho and Fellini’s Casanova. Other name directors forgo the possessive in favor of a declarative, if incomplete, sentence: A Frank Capra production. A Martin Scorsese picture. A Spike Lee joint. And if you’re a certain lantern-jawed helmer interested in keeping the public well apprised of your track record: The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino (as seen on the Kill Bill: Volume 1 trailer).\n\nAnd then there is “An Alejandro G. Iñárritu film.” Iñárritu, the recent best-director Oscar winner, publicly battled with his former co-writer over use of the credit. Guillermo Arriaga, the screenwriter who collaborated with Iñárritu on Amores Perros, 21 Grams, and Babel, told The New York Times , “I have always been against the ‘film by’ credit on a movie. It’s a collaborative process.” But Iñárritu claimed it was Arriaga who was chasing the sole limelight for Babel, and, outraged, the director reportedly barred his writing partner from Babel’s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. Spoiler alert: It seems the two haven’t worked together since.\n\nNo one ever said Hollywood didn’t love drama.\n\nFor detractors, a director stamping their creative DNA on everything from a movie’s costumes to cinematography diminishes the inherently synergistic medium of filmmaking represented by the industry’s some 13 other unions and guilds.\n\nIn 1966, the Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) went to the mattresses with the Directors Guild (D.G.A.) over the issue. Secret meetings between the W.G.A. and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers yielded a hard-won agreement—a director could not take possessory credit unless he or she also wrote the script. When word reached directors that their grandiose credits would no longer be projected on movie screens, they bombarded studios with angry telegrams (David Lean cabled of his contributions to Dr. Zhivago versus the writer’s: “It was my film of his script, which I shot when he was not there”) and threatened to strike. The directors crushed the W.G.A. then, as well as when the same divisive scab was picked at in 1981, 1994, and 2000. John Carpenter likened the last flare-up to “a jihad.” Though he favors the apostrophe, as in John Carpenter’s Halloween, the director told A.V. Club that he thought “A film by” credits are “pretentious” saying, “[Film] is a collaborative effort. All I can take credit for is the directing.”\n\nMeanwhile John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate), who used the possessory on some 30 movies, threatened to stop making pictures altogether if the credit was ever abolished. In 2004, the D.G.A. finally issued guidelines for the credit, yet left a gaping loophole by making them “non-binding.” Are directors glory hogs, true auteurs, or pawns for studio marketing departments looking to cash in on a brand name?\n\nWhatever the case, prestigious directors from Steven Spielberg to Christopher Nolan continued to use a possessory credit to varying success—the W.G.A. insisted “A Christopher Nolan film” be blacked out on The Dark Knight screeners. Other directors use the possessory even on their feature-film debut (see the one-sheet declaring Road Trip to be “A Todd Phillips film”). Joining Woody Allen in the somewhat lonely “Directed by” camp, Sidney Lumet (Dog Day Afternoon, Network) not only refused to use the credit; his contracts prohibited a studio from using the possessory when advertising his films. The four-time best-director Oscar nominee never won in the category but did accept a Lifetime Achievement Oscar at the 2005 Academy Awards. In his speech, Lumet thanked directors who inspired him, writers he “stole from,” and finally, simply, “the movies.” In Lumet’s case at least, humility served him just as well as vanity in the end.\n\nCorrection: This article has been edited to clarify that the W.G.A. did not meet with the D.G.A. before the 1966 agreement."
