        "text": "Woody Allen is one of the most prolific and polarizing of film directors, with the mention of his name evoking the strongest of opinions.\n\n\"Perfect,\" said Carol Johnson, Executive Director of the Amherst Cinema. \"From his absurdist comedy to his existential drama to his nostalgic fantasy, our audiences will enjoy a summer series that throws perspective and illumination on a storied career.\"\n\nThe Woody Allen Summer Series begins with a retrospective of ten films that demonstrate Allen's range as an auteur and ends with two films that, while not directed by Allen, feature his uncanny ability as an actor to imbue comedy with somber philosophic undertones.\n\nEach of the films featured in the series enjoys two screenings, a Sunday matinee at 2 p.m. and a Wednesday encore at 7:30 p.m. \"Sleeper,\" which launches the series, plays Sunday July 1 at 2 p.m. and Thursday July 5 at 7:30 p.m.. No show July 4.\n\nTickets are regular admission and are available at the Amherst Cinema box office or online at www.amherstcinema.org\n\n\"Sleeper\" (1973, PG) Sunday July 1 at 2 p.m. and Thursday July 5 at 7:30 p.m. – Ostensibly a spoof on B-movie science fiction, this is really an homage to screwball comedies of the silent era, with Allen waking up in a futuristic society that counts Diane Keaton amongst its denizens.\n\n\"Love and Death\" (1975, PG) Sunday July 8 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday July 11 at 7:30 p.m. – A satire of all things Russian, from the weighted novels of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, to the fraught montage of Eisenstein films, this oft-overlooked gem features some of Allen's best one-liners.\n\n\"Annie Hall\" (1977, PG) Sunday July 15 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday July 18 at 7:30 p.m. – Allen's most decorated film (four Oscars, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress, Diane Keaton)—a unique take on a world taking full advantage of the sexual revolution—is nearly experimental in its assemblage of stream-of-consciousness anecdotes that follow the memories and associations of well-drawn characters rather than a conventional narrative.\n\n\"Manhattan\" (1979, R) Sunday July 22 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday July 25 at 7:30 p.m. – The image of Allen and Diane Keaton looking at the 59th Street Bridge is iconic, but every frame shot by frequent collaborator Gordon Willis contributes to a work of aesthetic ambition that Allen has yet to match. \"Zelig\" (1983, PG) Sunday July 29 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday Aug. 1 at 7:30 p.m. A faux-documentary about a guy with a serious chameleon complex, Allen used state-of-the-art technology to insert himself into newsreel footage from the '20s and '30s for a film as impressive as it is funny.\n\n\"Purple Rose of Cairo\" (1985, PG) Sunday Aug. 5 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday Aug. 8 at 7:30 p.m. – Mia Farrow plays a Depression-era woman whose movie-star crush (Jeff Daniels) literally walks off the silver screen and into her life in this personal favorite of the director.\n\n\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986, PG-13) Sunday Aug. 12 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday Aug. 15 at 7:30 p.m. – Allen follows the lives, loves and infidelities of a tightly knit artistic clan (Mia Farrow, Diane Weist and Barbara Hershey), creating both a perfect mosaic of Manhattan living and a stupendous opportunity for ensemble casting, with Michael Caine, Max von Sydow, Carrie Fisher, John Turturro and the maestro himself.\n\n\"Crimes and Misdemeanors' (1989, PG-13) Sunday Aug. 19 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday Aug. 22 at 7:30 p.m. – In a delicate balancing act, Allen weaves the tragic story of an ophthalmologist who has his mistress murdered with the comedic tale of a documentary filmmaker's battle of wits with his brother-in-law.\n\n\"Husbands And Wives\" (1992, R) Sunday Aug. 26 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday Aug. 29 at 7:30 p.m. – When their best friends announce their divorce, a professor and his wife discover the faults in their marriage. A painfully intimate look at the dissolution of two marriages, widely considered the last of Allen's \"golden era\" of films that began with ANNIE HALL.\n\n\"Vicki Cristina Barcelona\" (2008, PG-13) Sunday 9/2 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday 9/5 at 7:30 p.m. – Emblematic of the European sojourn Woody Allen is currently enjoying, this ironic romantic comedy is light on the one-liners and heavy on the theatrics, which proves a winning combination thanks to strong performances from Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Rebecca Hall.\n\n\"Play It Again Sam\" (1972, PG) Sunday Sept. 9 at 2 p.m. and Wednesday Sept. 12 at 7:30 p.m. – Herbert Ross directs this adaptation of Allen's Broadway play about a Bogart-obsessed nebbish, marking the first of eight collaborations with actress Diane Keaton in a film that features one of Woody's most appealing incarnations."
