        "text": "Woody Allen’s Manhattan is a stunningly shot ode to New York City, and is one of the greatest films in his oeuvre. It explores modern love with its subtle but poignant dialogue, and puts Allen’s craftsmanship on full display.\n\nThematically, Allen sticks with his trademarks, but aesthetically, it is a deviation for him. For example, he chooses to completely forgo his standard opening titles (always in the Windsor font) that he has used in nearly all the films in his filmography. Shown below is an example from New York Stories (1989).\n\nManhattan is one of his rare uses of black-and-white, and one of his even rarer uses of 2:35:1 widescreen. It is a completely necessary deviation, however, when one considers that the idea for the film was inspired by the music of George Gershwin: it is entirely the film’s distinct aesthetic elements that allow New York City to transcend its role as a backdrop, and become, in itself, one of the characters of the film. The black-and-white accentuates the timelessness and charm of the city, and the CinemaScope widescreen allows for grand, panoramic views. This sequence serves to capture New York City fully, in all of its glamor, and in all of its mundane realism.\n\nThe first shot is of a skyline:\n\nFor the next four minutes, beautifully composed shots from around New York are shown, accompanied by Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, as Allen’s character, in voice-over, narrates his writing process of the introduction to a book about a character who loves the city. In this narration, Allen manages to sum up the aesthetic of the film: “He adored New York City…he romanticized it all out of proportion. To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white, and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin.” Allen’s narration also serves to give insight into his character: he is neurotic, indecisive and passionate.\n\nCinematographer Gordon Willis makes great use of low-angle shots,\n\nas well as of deep focus:\n\nThe above shot is one of many examples of tight, densely packed shots that capture the vivacity and business of the city, and the hectic fervor of its people. In contrast, there are other shots that are wide, but contain no people, to capture the architecture of the city, independent of its population; Broadway, skyscrapers, signs, marquees, restaurants etc.\n\nAs the music comes to a grand climax, and Allen’s character settles on his ideas (“New York was his town, and it always would be”), a series of various skyline shots from around New York are shown:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe montage then continues, but with night-time shots:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThere is also a beautiful aerial shot of a stadium featured:\n\nFinally, there is another skyline shot, with fireworks:\n\nThe film then cuts to Elaine’s, a bar and restaurant, where we see another densely packed, tight shot,\n\nwhere Isaac (Allen), Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), Yale (Michael Murphy), and Emily (Anne Byrne) sit at a table, in conversation. There is no establishing shot; instead, their conversation is first shown on-screen with a close-up of Murphy:\n\nThere are then multiple close-ups:\n\nThere are also, eventually, a few establishing shots:\n\nThe scene starts with tight close-ups of each character, intercut, and there are later a few two-shots. Eventually, well into the scene, Allen chooses to cut to the master shot. This decision makes the introduction more intimate and less jarring than it would have been to reveal four of the film’s principal cast in a single shot. In the long conversation featured in the scene, nothing is revealed that is vital to the film’s narrative, other than the relationship between Isaac and Tracy, and that Tracy is seventeen. It can be safely said that this conversation also primarily serves an aesthetic purpose, because the people of New York, and their culture, is just as much a characteristic of the city as the skyscrapers and the chaotic avenues. It serves to complete the portrait of New York that this opening, and this entire film, attempt to paint."
