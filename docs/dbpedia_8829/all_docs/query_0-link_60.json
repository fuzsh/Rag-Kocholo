        "text": "Gordon Willis’ cinematography in Woody Allen’s ‘Manhattan’ is a masterful showcase of visual storytelling that contributes significantly to the film’s lasting popularity and critical acclaim. The film’s black and white cinematography is a standout feature, acting as a “pitch-perfect valentine to the Big Apple,” creating a timeless and evocative portrait of the city​1​. Willis’ approach to cinematography in ‘Manhattan’ and his other works was fundamentally about simplicity and sophistication. He focused on the essential elements of photography — light and shadow — eschewing fancy effects for a more grounded and yet magical visual experience. Willis’ lighting is described as “edgy and succinct,” highlighting only what is necessary and often using minimal lighting to enhance key details, creating an efficient and powerful cinematic language that doesn’t overwhelm but instead feels real and unforgettable​2​.\n\nDelving into the technical aspects, Willis shot most of the movie with a 100mm anamorphic lens, which offered a limited aperture but was sufficient to capture the nuanced lighting of the film’s many exterior shots, even those using only ambient light. This technical choice contributed to the film’s distinctive visual style, which paired beautifully with the film’s chosen black and white format to create its iconic aesthetic​3​.\n\nIn his broader work, Willis, known as “The Prince of Darkness,” had a signature use of contrast and shadows to amplify the narrative and the emotional undercurrents of the scenes. This technique is evident in his work in ‘The Godfather’ and ‘All the President’s Men,’ where the manipulation of light and darkness was actively used to reflect the themes of mystery and paranoia. Willis’s cinematography was not passive; it actively contributed to the storytelling by allowing light to move, highlighting or obscuring characters’ faces to emphasise their emotional state or the implications of the narrative at that moment​2​."
