He has since developed into a renowned script writer, actor and film director, first for his slapstick comedies, but later for more serious comedies and some dramatic features. He is heavily influenced by comedians such as Bob Hope and the Marx Brothers, and European directors including Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman. Most of his films are situated in New York, while in recent years he started to make movies in major European cities such as London, Paris, Rome and Barcelona.
