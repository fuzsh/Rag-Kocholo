        "text": "Woody Allen is one of film's best-known figures. Writing and directing a movie almost every year since 1965, his collection ranges from comedy to the dramatic. Allen retains significant creative control over his projects, eliciting envy from almost any other film producer in Hollywood. Despite small production budgets, he also commands the ability to attract top-name talent to his films.\n\nWoody Allen was born Allan Koningsberg on December 1, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York. As a child, he was introverted, hated school and spent most of his free time alone in his room practicing magic tricks or his clarinet. As a teen, he began his career by reading his own one-line jokes to New York columnists Walter Winchell and Earl Wilson. In 1952 he changed his name to Woody Allen.\n\nSince that time, Allen has written over sixty movie scripts and directed over fourty films, and this does not include any of his books, plays and comedy work.\n\nAllen continues to produce a new film a year, recently filming his latest set of films in Europe to much critical acclaim, such as 2005's Match Point with Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nMany fans would consider his most popular films to be Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Radio Days. Allen, however, has many more films to his credit. It is not generally known that he also has made several purely dramatic films, the quality of which is considered, in some cases, to be uneven and debatable.\n\nThe Woody Allen Film Guide is a compendium of information on Woody Allen's movies. Other areas of this website contain biographical books, famous quotes, collectible movie posters and trivia.
