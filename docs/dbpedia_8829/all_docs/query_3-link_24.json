        "text": "In 2012, Woody Allen invited audiences on a journey through the Eternal City with his film “To Rome With Love.” This ensemble comedy, interwoven with the director’s signature wit and a signature range of eclectic characters, is a charming love letter to Rome, brimming with fascinating details and cinematic anecdotes.\n\nThe film’s title itself underwent an odyssey before its final iteration. Originally christened “The Bop Decameron,” it was then changed to “Nero Fiddled” before Allen settled on “To Rome With Love.” The initial title’s allusion to the medieval collection of novellas, “The Decameron,” proved too obscure, prompting the change to something more accessible.\n\nOne of the film’s many quirks is the phrase ‘Ozymandias Melancholia,’ which makes its way into the dialogue three times. This term was coined by Allen decades earlier for his 1980 film “Stardust Memories,” adding a layer of nostalgic intertextuality (otherwise known as an ‘Easter Egg’!) for his long-time fans.\n\n“To Rome With Love” also marks significant milestones for its cast. Roberto Benigni, the Italian maestro of comedy, made his first wide American release appearance since his role in “Pinocchio” (2002) and his first in an American-directed film since “Son of the Pink Panther” (1993). The film also heralded Woody Allen’s return to acting after a six-year hiatus, his last role being in “Scoop” (2006).\n\nThe ensemble cast is a treasure trove of talent, featuring three Oscar winners — Woody Allen, Roberto Benigni, and Penélope Cruz — and five nominees: Alec Baldwin, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, and Elliot Page. Each actor brings a unique flair to the film’s varying narratives, from romantic escapades to comically absurd adventures.\n\nThroughout the film, Allen infuses Roman history and culture into the storyline. A small yet significant detail includes a square manhole inscribed with SPQR, an ancient symbol that stands for ‘Senatus Populusque Romanus,’ meaning ‘Senate and People of Rome.’ This homage to Rome’s ancient past is a testament to Allen’s meticulous attention to detail.\n\nDespite the film’s setting in Rome, one notable scene featuring the 100 Fountains of Villa d’Este was actually shot in Tivoli, a quaint town 34 kilometres from the capital. This location, originally Emperor Hadrian’s retreat, serves as a picturesque backdrop, further enriching the film’s visual splendour.\n\nGreta Gerwig’s dedication to her role is evident as she learned to speak Italian for the film, and Noomi Rapace was initially considered for the role that eventually went to Penélope Cruz. Additionally, Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s audition for a role and the cameo appearance of designers Dolce & Gabbana in the “Pagliaccio” scene add fascinating layers to the film’s creation story.\n\nA particularly meta moment in the film occurs when Jack, an architecture student, asks Monica about her interest in architecture, to which she replies, “some.” This subtle nod to Elliot Page’s role as the chief architect in “Inception” (2010) is another Easter egg for cinephiles.\n\n“To Rome With Love” is also notable for being one of Woody Allen’s longer films, clocking in at 112 minutes. As of May 2018, it stands as his last live-action appearance in a movie he directed, with “Café Society” (2016) featuring him only as a narrator.\n\nUltimately, “To Rome With Love” is a n energising, multifaceted ode to one of the world’s most enchanting cities, offering a cinematic experience that is as rich as Rome itself. Through its blend of comedy, romance, and a dash of surrealism, Woody Allen once again demonstrates his deft touch in capturing the essence of a place and the idiosyncrasies of its people."
