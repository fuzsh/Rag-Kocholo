        "text": "Between the years 1979, when it opened in theaters, and 1984, I saw “Manhattan” 11 times, after which I stopped keeping count. The early 1980s marked both the period of my adolescent hunger for an urbane, grown-up life in New York and the dawn of VHS, enabling the obsessive consumption of movies, which in my case meant the obsessive consumption of movies by Woody Allen.\n\nIn them, I found a vision of the future I wanted, a series of aspirations — to have opinions, to write, to go to book parties but also to make fun of people who approached those things too seriously. The hope was to inhabit the world the way Woody Allen did, as both conspirator and judge.\n\nHow much of this I expressed to the adults in my life, I can hardly remember. The 20th century had begun as the “century of the child” with a new emphasis on attentive care and optimal well-being. By the 1970s, that energy had long since faded. There were different allegiances now — to movements and causes, to sex and sedition.\n\nThe ’70s saw an inversion of the Victorian maxim: it was mothers and fathers who were heard but not seen. You sensed that they were around somewhere — from the sound of ice clinking in glasses, from their self-help chants and bitter arguments. But they were rarely where they needed to be — standing right alongside you, with the weight of emotional presence, explaining, for example, that a comedy about a 42-year-old man sleeping with a 17-year-old girl is not a love story.\n\nOver the past 30 years, “Manhattan,” in which Mr. Allen cast himself as Isaac Davis, a middle-aged writer dating a high-school student, has repeatedly come up for moral evaluation. We are back there again, on the occasion of a new four-part HBO documentary, “Allen v. Farrow.”\n\nIn the early 1990s the director famously left his longtime girlfriend and collaborator, Mia Farrow, for her college-age daughter, a scandal immediately followed by Ms. Farrow’s accusation that Mr. Allen had sexually molested their adopted 7-year-old girl, Dylan. Mr. Allen has always denied the charge. The film invites us to revisit the claims and counterclaims — the history, the art, the legal proceedings and ugliness, leaning on “Manhattan” as evidence that the director had long groomed his audience to gloss over predation and call it romance.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
