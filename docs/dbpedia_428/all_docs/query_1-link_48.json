        "text": "The most decorated veteran of WWII—and in American history—is Audie Murphy. His incredible heroism was chronicled in the movie, To Hell and Back, in which he played the starring role. In this riveting Civil War movie, adapted from Stephen Crane’s great American novel, Murphy plays a less-than- courageous soldier who faces hard truths about war, loyalty, bravery, and himself.\n\nIn 1862, a starry-eyed teenager named Henry Fleming enlists in the Union army. He’s a romantic young man with dreams of being a hero, having adventures, and beating the enemy with ease.\n\nWhen Henry is about to take part in his first battle, he tells his fellow soldiers that he isn’t afraid. While on patrol, he exchanges words with a Confederate soldier stationed across the river who tells Henry to be careful of getting “the red badge,” which is another way of saying getting wounded in battle.\n\nWhen the fight begins, Henry starts to panic. Cold hard fear wells up within him, and he realizes that maybe being a hero isn’t for him after all. Overwhelmed and terrified by the devastation and confusion raging around him, Henry deserts his unit.\n\nAs he flees, he is knocked unconscious. Once Henry awakens, he learns that the Union won the battle. He falls in line with his unit and tells them that he was hurt during the fighting.\n\nHenry watches the other soldiers coming back with their “red badges,” and he feels terrible about his cowardice. How could he abandon his regiment when they needed him? And if he ran away once—will he run away again when the next battle rages?\n\nThis once dreamy and romantic young boy still has a lot to learn about what it means to be a soldier and a man. But he’ll have to dig deep to overcome his own regrets and fears.\n\nDoes Henry Fleming have what it takes to stay true to his convictions, act courageously…and be a hero after all?"
