        "text": "Tubercular Stephen Crane died in 1900, falling short of his twenty-ninth birthday. Although it isn’t quite in the league of masterpieces by Herman Melville (Moby-Dick, The Confidence Man, Pierre) and Mark Twain (The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Pudd’nhead Wilson), his Red Badge of Courage is a great American novel, easily the finest ever written about the American Civil War. Blending naturalism and impressionism, objective realism and psychological realism, it owes something to the fiction of Edgar Allan Poe. Yet it is also startlingly original. British author H. G. Wells called Crane “the first expression of the opening mind of a new period.”\n\nThe son of a Methodist minister, Crane could not maintain religious faith in the face of the poverty that he witnessed—see his first novel, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, written in his teens—and (at the time of Red Badge) the horrors of war that he imagined. (Later, as a war correspondent, he covered the Spanish-American and Greco-Turkish Wars.) He took reality on the chin. He “was almost illusionless,” according to biographer and poet John Berryman.\n\nAmerican filmmaker John Huston wasn’t one to harbor illusions either. The Red Badge of Courage, which he hoped would be his masterpiece, concluded a two-picture deal with M-G-M, which had blithely butchered Erich von Stroheim’s Greed (1924) from 9½ to 2¼ hours in order to satisfy the studio’s own greed and its antagonism to art as distinct from commercial entertainment. Studio head Louis B. Mayer had been skeptical about Huston’s project from the get-go but acquiesced to the go-ahead given by Dore Schary, the new vice president in charge of production. Nevertheless, the project saw a succession of budget cuts, and when a preview audience populated by adolescents—a group for whom the film was never intended—derided the result, the studio slashed the film by thirty minutes, all but deleting a major character (the Tattered Soldier) and conflating two separate battles into a single, confusing event. However, M-G-M’s worst “improvement” came in a different form, and more than the other changes this one got to the heart of the studio’s disapproval of the project. A voiceover narration—to his eternal disgrace, spoken by James Whitmore—was added.* Its opening commentary stakes out what it wants audiences to embrace as the movie’s unifying theme: the passage of Henry Fielding, a Union recruit, from boyhood to manhood as he is tested by the experience of war.\n\nIndeed, this is how the novel is commonly taught in American high schools in an effort to make it “relevant” in particular to adolescent boys. In truth, those teaching English at this level, trained in education rather than (to any degree of rigor) literature, probably think this is what the novel is about. Only, it isn’t. War doesn’t “make a man” of Henry, although he himself may think it does. War isn’t background in Crane’s book for a coming-of-age story; nor is the novel in any way endorsing war as a means for boys to feel their oats and get on to the meat of manhood. The Red Badge of Courage is a stinging indictment of war, which it sees as a false god that is, in fact, the other face of the Christian god to whom soldiers pray to steel themselves for killing and being killed. It is an exquisite and withering piece of irony, and Huston, who documented combat during the Second World War, wanted his film to match the author’s intentions. It is his allegiance to those intentions that had made him want to make the film in the first place. This made M-G-M very nervous. At the time, the United States itself was at war, in Korea, and at home a reactionary atmosphere had set in—McCarthyism—that equated the expression of certain sentiments, especially in Hollywood (because of its cultural influence) and government, with dangerous disloyalty. There might be grim repercussions for a studio that made an antiwar film at a time of war; it could be seen as giving aid and comfort to the Communist enemy and as undermining support for American combat troops. Charles Chaplin’s intended antiwar satire Shoulder Arms (1918) had also been unmercifully altered upon the U.S.’s belated engagement in the First World War.\n\nM-G-M, then, was afraid of losing more than its shirt.\n\nBut why then is Huston’s film as good as it is?\n\nFollowing the ridiculous opening comment, the narration draws verbatim from the book. While this practice may reduce somewhat the resonance of some of the film’s imagery, it corroborates Huston’s point of view. Without realizing it, probably because they misgauged Crane’s intent, the studio has assembled a film that is largely true to this intent! (“Scars faded like flowers,” at the last Whitmore reads from the book, missing the irony but in no way obstructing our more intelligent ability to restore it.) Meanwhile, Huston was off in Africa shooting The African Queen (1951) with Bogey and Kate.\n\nThe “plot” of the film adheres to the coming-of-age story that American schoolteachers routinely mistake the novel to be. Henry is fearful that he will prove a sissy in combat and even bolts at the first sign of battle; but shame emboldens his behavior once he has returned to his unit. The narrative counts for little, though. It is the way in which a story is told that is decisive to its meaning, for ten persons might tell the same story, more or less following the same or similar details of plot, and come up with ten different meanings—in effect, ten different stories. Crane’s treatment of Conklin’s—the Tall Soldier’s—sudden death from a battle wound is ripe with the pointed irony young Crane could beautifully muster. Jim Conklin’s death—note his initials—is a parody of the crucified Jesus. You need to listen closely as well as read closely; with literature, speedreading doesn’t work:\n\nSuddenly, his form stiffened and straightened. Then it was shaken by a prolonged ague. He stared into\n\nspace. . . .\n\nHe was invaded by a creeping strangeness that slowly enveloped him. For a moment the tremor of his legs caused him to dance a hideous hornpipe. . . .\n\nHis tall figure stretched itself to its full height. There was a slight rending sound. Then it began to swing forward, slow and straight, in the manner of a falling tree. A swift muscular contortion made the left shoulder strike the ground first.\n\nThe body seemed to bounce a little way from the earth. “God!” said the tattered soldier.\n\nThe youth [Henry] had watched, spellbound, this ceremony at the place of meeting. His face had been twisted into an expression of every agony he had imagined for his friend.\n\nHe now sprang to his feet and, going closer, gazed upon the pastelike face. The mouth was opened and the teeth showed in a laugh.\n\n. . . he could see that that the [corpse’s] side looked as if it had been chewed by wolves.\n\nThe youth turned, with sudden, livid rage, toward the battle-field. He shook his fist. . . .\n\n“Hell—”\n\nThe red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer.\n\nCrane’s presentation of Conklin, to whom Henry looks up, as a mock-Christ figure is typical of his ironical strategies in the book. The accumulation of these composes a portrait of war, however sincerely fought, as a pseudo-religious event. To be blunt, Crane’s description of Conklin’s death is at once horrifying and hilarious, the latter principally due to the Christian symbolism that Crane turns on its ear. Ear is right. The attentive reader hears the explosion of wit in the final line of Chapter IX, “The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer,” wherein “pasted” picks up on Conklin’s death mask, his “pastelike face,” and the parody of his heavenward spiritual ascension, as the last image takes us to the sky, enjoins and pointedly confuses the blood-red god of Christian sacrifice and the blood-red god of war, the sun’s pastiness and wafer-likeness exposing the falseness of both in their mockery of sacrament.\n\nHuston’s own atheism imparts to the corresponding scene in the film something of the same incongruous spirit. (This atheism of his also helped him make the most perceptive film ever about the role of religion in the American cultural landscape, Wise Blood, 1979, from Flannery O’Connor.) However, we are talking Hollywood here, and the boldest limit of sacrilege that Crane impishly pursued is pretty much off-limits to Huston and everyone else in Tinseltown. Huston’s Red Badge is a considerable achievement, but it falls considerably short of Crane’s. Still, Huston, assisted by black-and-white cinematographer Harold Rosson, devises a pair of shots that elsewhere intimates Crane’s courage. The first time that Henry feels he has proven himself in war, he looks up to see radiant sunlight from the sky showering down on him through branches and leaves of a tree. It is a beauteous spectacle—but one the dappled character of which suggests Henry’s religious misinterpretation of a purely natural phenomenon. Later, when he feels reconfirmed in this self-confidence, he looks up again, and sunlight and tree again provide the same visual effect, only this time less gorgeously, more mutedly. The second instance, then, ironically undercuts the first; but even on its own, the film’s first breathtakingly tranquil instance of the effect brilliantly mocks the whole idea that success in combat wins God’s approbation. To Huston, as with Crane, such an idea is egotistical and perhaps even solipsistic—rather than a spiritual revelation, an exposure of the human need to justify participation in killing people.\n\nCommentators routinely note that Huston based the visual style of his film on Matthew Brady’s Civil War photographs. But it is what he does with this objective, realistic style that one needs to consider to grasp better Huston’s artistic intent. Huston has punctuated his film with closeups, especially of Fielding, that undercut the film’s pseudo-photographic realism, shifting its tenor to a largely subjective domain. Point-of-view shots, like the ones described in the previous paragraph, assist in this procedure. Finally, an hallucinatory quality to much of the film, in its portrayal of the impact of war on the war’s participants, completes the task of undercutting. Huston counters objectivity, then, with subjectivity, thus implying that warriors will make of their warfare what they will, assigning whatever meanings to it they must in order to stabilize themselves and redeem themselves from whatever shame or guilt might proceed from participation in murder.\n\nHuston assembled a great cast. The most highly decorated soldier of World War II, diminutive, obstreperous Audie Murphy beautifully plays Henry Fielding, giving so transparent a rendering of the youth’s volatile and conflicted emotions as to render much of the voiceover narration unnecessary and all the more intrusive. (After first meeting Murphy, who had killed nearly 250 Germans during the war, Huston described him as a born killer!) Bill Mauldin, World War II’s American cartoon laureate, is vivid as Tom Wilson, the Loud Soldier, who hides fear of combat behind bravado but, after tasting combat, relaxes into honest, open reflection. Arthur Hunnicutt is a hoot as Bill Porter, another of the soldiers. And so on.\n\nWhat with the studio’s meddling, the film did not turn out as Huston had hoped. It isn’t among his greatest works,** although the first movement—the entire film is now 69 minutes long—is amazing, and the summary shot of Fielding confusedly carrying two flags, his Union Jack and the flag of a fallen Confederate soldier, is exceptionally powerful.\n\n* Lillian Ross’s book Picture (1952) famously chronicles the film’s troubled history.\n\n** While it amazes me how much better Key Largo (1948) and The Misfits (1961) have become with the passage of time, here are my ten favorite Huston films in order of preference:\n\n1. San Pietro (1945)\n\n2. The Dead (1987)\n\n3. The Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\n4. Wise Blood (1979)\n\n5. Fat City (1972)\n\n6. Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\n7. The Red Badge of Courage (1951)\n\n8. Let There Be Light (1946)\n\n9. The Asphalt Jungle (1950)\n\n10. Beat the Devil (1953)\n\nB(U)Y THE BOOK\n\nMY BOOK, A Short Chronology of World Cinema, IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FROM THE SANDS FILMS CINEMA CLUB IN LONDON.
