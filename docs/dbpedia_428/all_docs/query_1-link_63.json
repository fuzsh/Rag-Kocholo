        "text": "On a humid August morning, 20,000 British regulars and Hessian mercenaries are bearing down upon George Washington's recently formed American army of 12,000 men. The Revolution could be snuffed out before it has a chance to begin. The actions of one man, General William Alexander, leading a group of four hundred Maryland soldiers, prevented a decisive British victory that day. The Brave Man tells his story, which is also the story of the Battle of Brooklyn, the first, largest, and bloodiest, but perhaps least-known conflict of the War for Independence.\n\nShot with a caught-on-the-run style, The Brave Man employs maps, a fleet of red cars, a historic stone house, clever transitions between past and present, and a powerful, disbelief-suspending soundtrack. More than simply reenacting history, rather it evokes it, asking the audience to imagine the fear, the confusion, and the courage of the men who fought and died. As the battle develops, the motives of William Alexander also emerge. A pretender to a Scottish earldom, he has very personal and not-so-noble reasons for facing down the British.\n\nJuxtapositions like these -- the personal vendetta with a national cause, a contemporary street corner with a colonial cannon -- make The Brave Man an unprecedented motion picture experience."
