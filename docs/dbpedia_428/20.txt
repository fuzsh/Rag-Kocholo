Audie Murphy stars in John Huston’s war drama, based on Stephen Crane’s novel about a young soldier during the Civil War who has to confront his cowardice.

Huston shoots the film in a really distinctive way, using extreme close-ups and strange angles to bring us into the mindset of the soldier, and the techniques are striking even today. The battle sequences, especially towards the end, are superbly done, creating a more immersive experience than was usual at the time, and long before Dunkirk or 1917. I found the last sequence moving, with lots of striking imagery and a sensitive, measured performance from real life war hero Murphy.

However, due to a major edit by the studio, 50 minutes were left…

Stephen Crane’s The Red Badge of Courage is a novel of contradictions. Its protagonist, Union soldier Henry Fleming, runs away from one battlefield in fright only to lead the charge forward on another just hours later. The novel itself is routinely regarded as the greatest of all fictional accounts of the U.S. Civil War and one of the best depictions of battle ever written, yet its author was born six years after the war ended and had not seen conflict firsthand up to that point. (One of the reasons I love literary realism so much is that it puts paid to the cliched advice to “write what you know.” Crane and other realists demonstrated that one can write about whatever is…

Stephen Crane’s The Red Badge of Courage is the great American war novel, and a precursor of modernism in his inventive use of narrative tools to convey subjectivity and the thin membrane separating cowardice from courage.

John Huston intended to use cinematic tools, Matthew Brady’s camera and film noir camera moves, to convey subjectivity as Crane had, to show what it felt like to be on that battlefield, fighting fear and blinded by cannon smoke. He didn’t want to portraying a battle of North vs South, but of one soldier fighting with himself. Huston hoped to convey psychological action matching the armed conflict, and to build on the poignant irony of awarding Audie Murphy, the most decorated soldier of WWII,…

Adapted from the famous Civil War novel by Stephen Crane, John Huston's film was radically cut by a third (!) by MGM after bad previews which infuriated Huston who'd considered it his best work. There are still some very impressive parts and he coaxed excellent performances on untested actors. I kept trying to figure out whether it's an anti-war or pro-war film (it has features of both). But its strength lies is in its portrayal of the psychological conflicts that confront soldiers facing violence and life/death struggles.

The two young leads (WWII war hero Audie Murphy and WWII newspaper cartoonist Bill Maudlin) portray young men barely out of boyhood who are both overly excited and deathly afraid of combat. Their…

Stephen Crane's 1894 novella about the Civil War is a classic in American literature, and John Huston's adaptation (albeit severely edited by the studio) is absolutely faithful to the book. What's more, the lead role is played by Audie Murphy, the most decorated U.S. war hero of World War II, and he gives a totally convincing performance as new recruit Henry "The Boy" Fleming, who learns to overcome his deepest fears and discover bravery in the face of possible death.

I was especially impressed by the casting. Murphy is…

It wasn't the first time, nor the last time, that a studio virtually ruined a movie by sticking its nose where it didn't belong. The only version of this Civil War tale, based on the book by Stephen Crane, is a little over an hour long, despite the fact that director John Huston delivered a two-hour-long motion picture.

It's told and shot in a "you are there" style, as we tightly follow the experiences of one soldier, played by highly decorated WWII veteran Audie Murphy, before, during and after a battle that appears to be Chancellorsville. And it's all quite compelling in a life-and-death fashion, as far as that goes. This is how the best war movies have always been…

Excellent examination of men under the stresses of combat, a subject matter tailor-made for John Huston. His camerawork here is fluid and eloquent, the framing of his subjects in the tight Academy ratio adroit. He is helped immeasurably by the beautiful black and white photography of Harold Rossen, whose battlefield scenes are distinguished by figures emerging from or being consumed by swirling smoke.

Huston sensibly casts his picture with 'everyman' actors and no stars, although Audie Murphy, concentrated and credible, was fast becoming one. All of his actors exude a sense of authenticity as they face fear and mostly overcome it, and the director himself pops up in an uncredited irascible cameo. The film doesn't hammer home an anti-war message…
