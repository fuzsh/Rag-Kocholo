Early Origins of the Toth family

The surname Toth was first found in Germany, where the name Toth came from humble beginnings but gained a significant reputation for its contribution to the emerging mediaeval society. It later became more prominent as numerous branches of the same house acquired distant estates, some of which were located in other countries, most notably in Sweden.
