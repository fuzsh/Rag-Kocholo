She was a pupil of Elie Spivak at the Royal Conservatory of Music, played at 14 in the Promenade Symphony Concerts orchestra, and toured Ontario. She played 1952-3 and 1956-8 in the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (at first under her maiden name and later under the surname Toth) and later played in ballet, opera, and studio orchestras in Toronto. She was married to the arranger, pianist and conductor Rudy Toth and collaborated as a lyricist on several of his projects, eg, the LP Canada: A Young People's Musical Tour of Canada's Provinces and Territories (1977; Secote 477-8201)."
