The Cuban, Spanish and Ja¬ maican projects are in the survey stage, with NBC out in the field in those situations, but in England, NBC and its affiliated RCA, Great Britain Ltd. have acquired 20% of a company competing for the commercial • outlet in Cardiff, Wales. An NBC spokesman has admitted that the Cuba-Spain-Ja¬ maica investigations- might only “be the beginning” in the net¬ work’s global aspirations.

Live talent, in some situations having “worked them¬ selves out of places to work in” be¬ cause of the economic structure in many communities, is now in the position of being subsidized by lo¬ cal merchants. Aside from the fact that top Hol¬ lywood, tele and cafe names are frequently recruited to lend gla¬ mor to openings of various types of stores, the bigscale-only variety shows are now being .brought to many towns as a substitute for free trading stamps or merchandise premiums. Supermarket Show of Shows, recently formed by a grocery outfit to stimulate sales In subscribing stores, is getting to be one of the major purveyors of live talent in many cities. Outfit has currently mapped out two shows and another is being hatched. First unit will be headed by Mickey Rooney and Gloria DeHaven in the southwest area, starting .Nov. 17 and winding up Dec. 1.

Loew 0 has tendered his resignation as president of Loew’s Inc. and instructed the corporation’s board to find a suc¬ cessor. He-intends to stay on in the job until the replacement is decided upon, but wants to wrap up his year-old assignment as chief exec by the end of this year. Efforts to reach Loew for com¬ ment were unsuccessful but other highly-placed sources say he’s had in mind to bow out for some time and- has now simply made it offi¬ cial via direct notification to the board. Loew, son of Marcus Loew, founder of the outfit that for years was considered the bellwether of the picture industry, has been re¬ garded as the. “reluctant presi¬ dent” from the start. He took over the post vacated by Nicholas M.. Schenck, who moved up to board chairman, in the interest of intra¬ mural harmony. Loew had been head of the international division, to which post he intends to return. Company confronted elements of uncertainty in its operation a couple of years ago and Loew was called upon to map a new modus operand!.

Columbia Rec¬ ords, which has been pacing the original cast set field for the past two seasons, is jacking up the price -oCThe package from $4.98 to $5.98. Label, currently riding with the bestseller “My Fair Lady,” already has two upcoming legitusiers under wraps, \"Li’l Abner” and “Bells Are Ringing.” The new price schedule went into effect Monday (1) and* covers all the original cast sets in Col's catalog. The multi-pocketed pack¬ ages will be upped accordingly. The new price range will also be carried over to the Columbia disk club. The new Col pricing gives the retailers and distributors an extra coin bonus on the sets in stock. However, some confusion is ex¬ pected from the disk club member¬ ship. since club circulars with the old $4.98 tab are still out. A spokesman for RCA Victor, which has only the upcoming Ethel Merman starrer, \"Happy Hunting,” on its schedule so far this season, said that Victor will definitely hold the $4.98 line on its original cast sets. None of the other companies has new tuners in the offing and no action has been taken on following the Columbia price line.

Even the sedate Tiihes, which chose to Ignore the hoopla sur¬ rounding Marilyn Monroe’s arrival a couple of months earlier, devoted substantially more than half-a-col- ymn to reporting the Liberace im¬ pact. The Daily Telegraph, in ad¬ dition to its straight news story, also ran an editorial headed “tal- ent and emotion,” which was pegged to the “drug” influence of television.

No Zionist, Kaye Is Still Banned By Jordan Censor Danny Kaye, in Chicago, ex¬ pressed himself that he “couldn’t care less” - although adding “it so happens I am not a Ziohist” when told that Jordan’s film censor an-* nounced all films, wherein Kaye had a role had been barred ( for that reason. Saad Jummah, In- ' terior Under-Secretry, has de- ! dared that the reason was that ; Kaye “was an enthusiastic Zionist * propagandist.” . ' In light of Kaye’s recent vivid ! work in behalf of UNICEF (the : .UN Children’s Rehabilitation | Fund) the amusement industry at large, however, takes a very dim- . view of this curious Jordanian J edict.

Action, charging breach of the Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis contract, originally filed Aug. 14, has been boosted by $3,000,000.

Engineers, tech, nicians and stagehands are still running around in circles trying to restore their aqualibrium after go. ing through one of the most hectic experiences jn tv annals—an ex- perience which, it’s estimated, cost NBC and the RCA-Oldsmobile sponsors about $35,000 over the spec’s budget (with network and clients sharing in the added rap) and enabling some of the stage- hands-technicians to take home \"up to $500 in overtime pay. The show finally got on the air (and it was a major consolation to all concerned that it wrapped up the healthiest Trendex of the weekend),^but even moments be. fore show time things looked bleak; ^Rating was 26.8.) With only about four inches to spare wall-to-wall in installing the swim tank at the Brooklyn tint stu- dios, it sprung a vital leak the day before the show, and even through the performance it was necessary to keep a pump in operation. En- , gineers worked through the night trying to'right things and in the middle of their labors the motor that' -navigated the revolving aqua¬ plane went bad.

DeMille would like to see his “Ten Commandments” play the Iron Curtain countries but wants assurances that the produc¬ tion will not be cut. He indicated this in New York this week in re¬ calling his tripjn Russia in 1931 wheYe he was regarded as a “hero.\" DeMille related that he was puz¬ zled how. to exlain this until dis¬ covering one of his early-day pic¬ tures, “Godless Girl,” was playing the Kremlin circuit but not as he had intended it. Film concerned school students who had taken to atheism until the last , reel, when they re-entered the spiritual fold. The Russians deleted that final reel. “Commandments” was brought in at a negative cost of $13,500,000, according to the producer. He said he’ll draw none of the profits, all monies which normally would ac¬ crue to him under his participation deal with Paramount being ear¬ marked for the DeMille Trust. This is a charitable outfit, of which De¬ Mille is not a director, set up to contribute to charitable, education¬ al and church interests. “Commandments” was shown to the press in theatres in several cities yesterday (Tues.) and Mon¬ day in advance of its invitational premiere at the Criterion, N.

Schreiber, Forecaster of Star Trends, Sees Clustering of Fresh Names Altering Studios Subservience By ABEL GREEN 4 En route to Europe on a busi¬ ness-vacation trip of three-four weeks, Lew'Schreiber, vet 20th- Fox studio executive, whose prime concern is with contract negotia¬ tions for talent and properties, had some more views on the horizons of the picture business. In a simi¬ lar situation, about five years ago, he discussed with Variety the like¬ lihood of more and more inde¬ pendent deals, talent participa¬ tions, and “a limitless ceiling ’which will make most studios sub¬ servient to the star.\" But this time he envisions a reversal of that trend. It may take a similar period to unearth a flock of new talent but he thinks that the new marquee values, which are being constantly created, and will more so with the advancing years, will revitalize Hollywood. If only because so many unknowns, but loaded with talent, are being spotted in “par¬ ticipation\" pictures, Schreiber feels, they must redound to the general welfare of the industry. Where a top star, director or writer-d^ector has his own indie setup they seek to insure their in¬ vestment with new faces but on short budgets because the. stars et al are the ones getting the cream deals.. As these new faces, coupled with a potent personality, get prop¬ er exposure they too will gain in stature. A case in point is Don Murray’s click opposite Marilyn Monroe in “Bus Stop.\" There are countless such instances says Schreiber. Admittedly these new personali¬ ties may, in time, seek and com¬ mand fancier fees but meantime (Continued on page 22) Film Men Found Short of Interest In Shortage The Saga of Robert J.

Stars (and Fees) Delay Features At Columbia The economy that has been de¬ veloping in the picture business over the past several years has now reached the point where im¬ portant production is being de¬ layed. This is the economy that pertains to stars. Columbia to cite one, has only three “A” pictures turned out by the studio on its release schedule for the balance of this year. These are “Solid Gold Cadillac\" and “In a Family Way,” both starring Judy Holliday, and “You Can’t Run Away With It,” with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon. According to exec sources, Col bas been ready to go with a dozen important projects for some time— ready except for casting. Stars are either unavailable or the asking price is too steep for the company. The top-name players, hand in hand with their agents, want to mike perhaps only one film a year and for this they want a percent¬ age deal. Col as a result has been putting off the actual camera work. Coincidental with this, Col’s In¬ dependent and foreign film sources have reached a new high level. This means no cut-down on the program of releases. But it clearly does have the effect of reducing studio activity. Taking a broader view of this new economy, it’s no secret that all companies have had difficulties from time to time in nabbing the “right” players for certain pictures. This leads to the question of how Stanley-Warner and American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres can expect to come up with pic¬ tures of boxoffice weight when-it'* no cinch for the experienced stu¬ dios. FILM INDUSTRY FAILS TO SPONSOR OSCAR Hollywood, Oct. 2. Oldsmobile will pick up the bills for the fourth consecutive year on the annual NBC-TV telecasts of the Motion Picture Academy nomina¬ tions and awards. Oldsmobile spon¬ sorship followed an abortive at¬ tempt by the Assn, of Motion Pic¬ ture Producers to reach an indus¬ try-wide formula to assume the sponsorship of the Oscar festivities itself. Last week, after a series of meetings, film men notified NBC western division v.p. John K. West that no agreement had been reached among the producers, and that the Assn, was therefore waiv¬ ing first refusal on the Oscar events. West said both awards and nom¬ inations telecasts would be offered to Oldsmobile. No dates have been set for the two events, normally held in the early part of the year. Y. Frank Freeman, AMPP board chairman, said hi3 org would con¬ tinue to explore plans for future underwriting of the Oscar shows, with NBC pledged to again offer them to the Assn, before negotiat¬ ing for commercial sponsorship. MPAA Board MuDs $5,000,000 Fix Contest to Up Attendance; WiU Exhibs Toss In $2,097,000? -f WALL ST. THINKS IT MAKES SENSE By GENE ARNEEL Mergers of studio facilities have become one of the top subjects of talks among film Industry brass. Whether it’s to be 20th-Fox shar¬ ing the same lot with Warners, or RKO and some other outfit, it's seen in certain trade circles that amalgamations of some sort are in definite prospect. Sharing of studio between 20th- Fox and Warners is considerably more than a conversational item. Wall Street believes that a blue¬ print already has been drawn, this calling for a sale of the 20th lot, including all oil rights, Jfor $25,- 000,000. Company would then move in on WB with the two shar¬ ing all film-making facilities. This would represent the most drastic move in recent years in the interest of economy. The prob¬ lems inherent in such a shift are tremendous but the savings that would accrue to both companies obviously would make it worth¬ while, according to the Wall Streeters. Regardless of whether this ever materializes, many in the trade acknowledge that the new trends in picture-making make such a merger economically desirable. Sound stages are being used less and less as independent produc¬ ers align with the majors.

This is one of various ideas worked out be the MPAA’s ad-pub commit¬ tee at the behest of the board. Contest Idea particularly Is re¬ garded as a puzzler in concept for it involves a contribution of $2,- 097,000 by exhibitors. They’re also asked to promote local-area prizes and give away year-long passes. On the other hand, the producer dis¬ tributors would share the making of 12 one-minute reelers for use in the contest at a cost tof $60,000 plus other expenses covering prints and distribution. As the plan is mapped, each film clip would present a couple of stars engaging in a charade, tho answer of which is the title of a picture. Theatre customer is en¬ titled to participate in one guess¬ ing game per/ admission. Other proposals being presented to the board include: a market an¬ alysis to determine who attends film theatres, or doesn’t, why and why not; a press junket to Holly¬ wood, with 300 newspapermen in¬ vited to spend a week at the film capital, with exhibs to pay trans¬ portation expenses and the produ- cer-distribs all other items, and field trips by Johnston and a few studio execs to meet with editors and publishers for an “honest ex¬ change of information.” Actually, the $2,097,000 which the exhibs would be asked to ante up is no staggering sum if all theatres were to participate and pay on a per-seat basis. But this would demand an unprecedented unity of minds in an. Industry where disunity in varying degrees has prevailed over the years. Nassers Arabian Nights Dreams Cues Film Echo By ELVIRA T. MARQUIS Cairo, Oct. 2. American film men quoted at the recent Venice Film Festival as say¬ ing that smaller nations like Spain, Greece and Denmark should be watched as a source for fresh- slanted feature film might well add Egypt to their eye-peeled list. For the Egyptian film industry seems definitely coming alive. Politics play a part in the change. With .the present ambi¬ tions of the Nasser regime to as¬ sume the leadership of the Islamic nations, Egyptian films'are now more natively Egyptian and this has infused a uniqueness previous¬ ly lacking when Cairo’s studios turned out mediocre imitations of American and British product. Related to the upgrading of Egyptian product are the numbers of natives who were sent to Holly¬ wood to perfect their motion pic¬ ture techniques. Production man¬ agers, camera directors, set design¬ ers reflect the benefits of such education. While Egyptian product is little known to American audiences it has been Increasingly accepted and praised in Europe, the Middle East (especially) and Asia. Good re¬ sponse was obtained by “I Sold My Youth,” “The Monster” and “Raya and Sekina.” If the economic squeeze on Egypt does not become too rough,, all eight film studios in Cairo (one sound stage each) expect to con¬ tinue their ambitious production schedule for the 1956-1957 season.

Demand has been contested by Kaufman who claims he isn't an agent, for the Yugoslav industry whose output he only partially represents. Furthermore; he says, the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 includes specific ex¬ emptions, including one for “Any. person, engaging or agreeing to engage only in private, nonpoliti- cal, financial, mercantile, or other activities in furtherance, of the bona fide trade or commerce of auch foreign principal.” Justice Dept.'s Foreign Agents Registration Section has informed Kaufman it doesn’t consider him eligible for this exemption, par-: ticularly since Yugoslavia is a Communist state. Specifically, the Department makes reference to the possible ? olitlcal and propaganda content of ugo pix, which rob Kaufman of his exemption rights. Kaufman said last week in N.Y. that, if the Department persisted, he had already told the Yugoslavs he’d rather drop their representa¬ tion thari incur the ‘^foreign agent” tag. Kaufman at the same time maintained that the Justice Dept, attitude foreshadowed a serious situation for all importers, particu¬ larly those that may deal with Iron Curtain countries. Kaufman stressed that his rep¬ resentation of Yugoslavia Film in the U.S. in. no Way implied any activity other than distribution of pictures; nor did .it have any bear¬ ing on his own political views. He said that not all of the Yugoslavia pix were available to him since ond-of the local companies had re¬ fused to go along with the arrange¬ ment.

Excepting Fridays and Saturdays, which will continue on a grind basis, Par is now recom¬ mending that the picture be sched¬ uled so that there will be only one full evening performance. Par’s thought is that in past the four-a-day meant- two perform¬ ances In thd latter part of the day with neither one agreeably .timed for the public; Idea now is to sked the one night showing, at around eight o’clock, so the audience will have the opportunity to catch it and still return home at a reason¬ able time. In line with the Par recommen¬ dation, the Hollywood Paramount Theatre already has switched to three-a-day after the original con¬ tinuous-run policy. It's presumed that most new bookings will be on the same basis. Business improved at the Coast house following the switch. Remaining unchanged is the four-a-day at the Capitol, New York, this on the theory that the metropolitan potential audience is sufficiently large to tap for the heavier schedule and the getaway following the last unreeling is not too late for many Gothamites.

Sadistic Scenes Still Upsetting Europe—Spires Biggest Continental censor beef is still violence in American pic¬ tures, say s Johh Spires, Universal’s Continental supervisor. In New York this week from his Paris headquarters. Spires noted that the European public didn’t seje eye-to-eye with the censors. He cited the case of “To Hell and Back,” a war picture, which is one of U’s biggest grossers in Ger¬ many. “The European censors .allow some incredible sex scenes to pass, but they’re tough N when it comes to brutality and violence,” he re¬ ported. Spires added that the Hollywood films’ restraint re the presentation of sex was both a handicap and a blessing. “A Euro¬ pean mother is just as happy as her American counterpart to know that shq can let her youngster see a film without having to worry about its contents,” chimed in Ben Cohn, assistant to U’s foreign gen¬ eral manager, AmeVico Aboaf.

In N.Y. recently for the Theatre Owners of . America convention, Morris said he had instituted a “see it from the beginning” policy at his Pike Theatre,, and that the system had paid off, at least at that specialized house. “It’s more important than ever today that people* get to see' pictures in the proper atmosphere,” he held. “A film has to be seen in proper con¬ tinuity to be enjoyed. 1 ’ / . Morris said. it was his impression that exhibition was “overseated” particularly in the drive-in field. Part'-of the blame he assigned to the equipment companies which were eager to sell their products. Ozoners are reaching the point where they are seriously thinning out on£ another’s business, he held. Operational costs are up, Morris said. In building, his houses, he was more concerned with stressing functional aspects rather than or- natenesp. “These are utility thea¬ tres and that keeps our overhead down,” he observed. Morris oper¬ ates, besides the Pike, also the Lee' and the Tower. Lee, in the mill district, is due to shutter soon.

What was needed was a “progres¬ sive, imaginative mental attitude.” Waste must end. Better use of available manpower was essential.

The writer has specific reference, he paid, to “Harry Cohn, Louis B. Mayer, Goldwyn and Zanuck in their hey¬ day.” Hecht' reasons it this way: “These men didn’t talk, they yell¬ ed, they didn’t think, but they could feel; and they were shrewd showmen.” The old-line kingpins knew what •the public Wanted .and gave it to them, stated Hecht. “It was the writer’s job only to get to first base and then have the.boss take over. The boss knew which way a ; script should be turned. He knew what 30,000,000 people wanted to see.” Hecht, in New York during the past week, admitted he rebelled against the “boss rule” for years but now acknowledges “that the boss was right.” Hecht conceded that this kind of thinking was contrary to any ideas about freedom for writers. “But Hollywood writers are mere¬ ly stowaways,” he insists. “They collect four times the'amount of money they're worth. Sure, I col¬ lected it, too, because I was in¬ spired by poverty.” Ever the controversial figure, Hecht claimed he withdrew his name from \"Iron Petticoat,” Bob Hope-Katharine Hepburn comedy made in England, because he felt that too much of his script was de¬ leted. (It’s also reported that Miss Hepburn is doing a burn because some of here scenes - were cut.) Hechtnpays-.hh'-owus'Of the “Petticoat” profits, but nonetheless he’s still raising*» fuss about how it was lensed. On the overall, he’s antagonistic of the financiers who, he states, do all the - cutting of pictures. The author offered\" another ob¬ servation, namely, “Mary Pick- ford is still queen of the movies. Hollywood is still doing ‘Alice in Wonderland’ just as It did when Miss Pickford first started. With the exception pf a ’Marty,’ which comes along once in every five years, Hollywood still refuses to recognize life. “It’s still the same story of hero conquering the villain and anyone who does wrong must be punished at the end. Perhaps‘this is they way it should be. Hollywood con¬ ditioned the public tp accept this and while the public may not like it, somehow they protest when they don’t get it. “Television, where Everybody is under 19, is different. They do ‘life’ stories.” Hecht recently completed a new screenplay of Ernest Hemingway’s “A Farewell to Arms” for produc¬ er David O. Selznick.

[JUBILATION IN INDUSTRY] Washington,. Oct. 2. The Loan Policy Board of the Federal Small Business Adminis¬ tration has authorized hard-top theatres as businesses to which loans may be made. This is in line with recent recommendation of the Senate Small Business Sub-Committee on Motion Picture Trade Practices, In a statement the Board declared: —^Recognizing that four-wall theatres, in addition to providing entertainment, frequently make substantial contribution to the maintenance or advancement of the economy of their communities, the Board was of the. opinion that the extension of financial as¬ sistance to small busihess concerns for the modernization, equip¬ ment, repair or operation of four-wall theatres making such con¬ tribution would be in the public interest.” Happy Ane They Action making small theatres eligible for Government-sponsored loans was hailed with jubilation in industry circles.' The tight money market has been most severe on theatreowners. In addi¬ tion to the Federal Reserve Board’s crack-down on loans of all kinds, Ideal banks were. additionally reluctant to grant loans to theatres for improvements, installing new equipment, and re¬ financing mortgages because of thfc risks entailed in theatre opera¬ tion today. The lack of working capital among exhibitors and the reluctance of commercial banks to grant them loans was sharply pointed up by Harry Brandt during his testimony before the Senate Small Business Subcommittee. . 1 . .I ' \" \" * \" \" Rotten Manners and Not Patriotic That’s DafFs.

(Daff refused to identify the ex- hib rep or''reps, but other,indus- tryites have placed the finger of Herman M. Levy, Theatre Owners of America general, counsel. Levy Is reported to have told European theatremen to look to the Conti¬ nental market for additional prod¬ uct since the U. S. filmmakers ap¬ peared more interested in tele¬ vision than in the theatres.) Statements derogatory to Anaer- Ican producers, Daff remarked, can be extremely harmful in that they have the effect of misleading gov¬ ernment officials abroad. Accord¬ ing to the U official, foreign the¬ atremen tended to laugh off the remarks since they are well aware of the fact that American films represent their most potent b.o. potential. “Otherwise,” Daff stat¬ ed, “American films would not oc¬ cupy 65% of the playing time of the world screens.” He pointed out, too, that U. S. films are doing a great job for the free world in that they do not indulge in propa¬ ganda. “I’ve been told,” Daff said, “that the American cowboy with his horse has. created a greater impact with the ordinary people than anything, else.”, Hecht Says His Script Uses Hemingway Book, Not Just Sex Angles Ernest Hemingway’s “A Fare¬ well to Arms” will be brought to the screen “in full” via David O. Selznick remake of the 1932 Para¬ mount production, according to Ben Hecht, who scripted the latter-day version. Hecht claims the original, Which had a screenplay by Benja¬ min Glazer and Oliver H. P. Gar- oiv£' \" was 20 % the book with «0% concerned with the sex an¬ gles.” Original had Helen Hayes, Gary Cooper and Adolphe Menjou in the leads. Further, according to Hecht, re¬ search conducted under Selznick's direction disclosed a historical Phase of World War I which here¬ tofore had been obscured. This concerns a regiment of Italian cavalryrnejti heroically holding off the German army for four ’dayis. Jury’* Film Outing Boston, Oct. 2. Arnold Van Leer, Para¬ mount N.

Brink’s jury accepted the in- • -vite and showed up with a deputy sheriff and seven court officers. “ . Brit. Set Barter Deal With Italy London, Oct. 2. A barter deal to enable British pix to escape the., new Italian com¬ pulsory deposit of 5,500,000 lire (about $8',870) per film has been negotiated in Rome . between the British Film Producers Assn., and the Associazione Nationale Indus¬ trie Cinematografiche Ed Affini. It will be retroactive to Sept. 1 provided it is ratified by Oct. 15. Under the deal five grounds are established to justify exemption from the compulsory deposit. The agreement, however, does not ex¬ tend to companies which are either a subsidiary of or controlled by U.S. outfits, as a separate ar¬ rangement has been made between American and Italian interests. Total exemption will be accord¬ ed to two British films for every Italian pic given a major circuit deal in Britain; to one British pic¬ ture for every Italian film given a minimum guarantee by a British company of not less than $28,000; the exemptions will be doubled when the minimum guarantee equals $70,000. Exemptions will also be allowed on a one-for-one basis in return for every Italian pre given worldwide distribution by a British outfit with an ade¬ quate minimum guarantee.

The tightening of the money supply and the advance in interest rates has no direct relationship to the “troubles” in the motion picture in¬ dustry,' but is. based' on a national economic policy affecting all busi¬ ness and industry in the United States. The clamp-down on loans' by commercial banks is an outgrowth of Government efforts to ^control the inflationary trend in thfA. coun¬ try. According to the Federal Re¬ serve Board, the slow-up in the rate of savings that normally fill the demands for credit has been a big factor in the tight money sit¬ uation and the advance of interest rates. Hardest hit by the lid on loans are independent producers who de¬ pend primarily on the commercial banks for the financing of .. their projects. The indies in recent years, and particularly those re¬ leasing through United Artists, have contributed a substantial and integral portion of the film sup¬ ply. If these suppliers are dried up through the lack of financing, a substantial decrease in number of pictures produced annually is an¬ ticipated. ’58 Seen Critical . Since bank loans have already been committed for mosf of the 1957 feature projects, the effect will not be felt until late in 1957 and will become most serious in 1958. Fortunately for United Artists, which arranges the loans for its independent producers, it has lined up the.bank coin neces¬ sary to complete the pictures re¬ quired for its entire 1957 program. Unless there is a loosening of the credit controls, UA may well have to develop new sources of financ¬ ing for producers who come to the company with package deals. The distribution company’s top¬ pers, aware of the situation, are making a careful study of the money market. There have been numerous reports, that UA is con¬ templating. a public stock issue, (Continued on page 22) ^ ACTT Asks BOT To Change Quota London, Sept. 25 On the eve of the opening of the Washington negotiations for the re¬ newal of the Anglo-American film agreement (Quota Act), the Assn, of Cinematograph and Television Technicians : inade a direct appeal to the Board' of’'Tirade ’preicy, Peter Thorneycroft,’to introduce radical changes which would limit con¬ vertibility to the amount British producers take out of America. In its letter to Thorneycroft, follow¬ ing an executive session last week, the union refers to press reports that the present pact is to be ex¬ tended in unamended form. It hopes they are inaccurate. The union’s appeal harks back to the agreed document sent in the name of all the industry labor groups to the National Film Fi¬ nance Corp. and the Board of Trade, in which it proposed revi¬ sion of the agreement “in keeping . with other plans for the well being of the industry.” It also advocates that the union's restrictions on con¬ vertibility should be extended to benefit British pix in Common¬ wealth and Colonial territories where “American domination re¬ stricts their exhibition.” The union further proposes that advantage should be taken of the occasion of the talks to advance^ the idea of a British Film Centre in the U.S. and for setting up an Anglo-American 1 Films Council. > U’s $1,50$>,0G® Loan Washington, Oct. 2. Universal borrowed $1,500,- 000 from the First National Bank of Boston and the Guar¬ anty. Trust under a 1955 credit agreement, the film company revealed today (Tues.) in a re¬ port filed with the Securities & Exchange. U disclosed that $1,200,000 was used to liquidate a short¬ term loan, $200,000 for an in¬ stallment payment on a loan with First National, and $100,- 000 was added to the working capital The report also indicates that the company. reduced its authorized cumulative pre¬ ferred stock by 1,4,00 shares, leaving a total of 83,400 shares. MalesBuyMost Film Tickets Males continue to outnumber fe¬ males among the ticket-buyers at theatres, according to Sindlinger & Co., market investigators. The week of Sept. 1 brought a total of 67,245,00.0 and of these 34,250,700 were males, 30,478,100 were femmes and 2,516,200 were children under 12 years old. Whereas in' past it was always the women who gave pictures the heav¬ ier play, it’s been, noted by Sind¬ linger and execs in the tirade that a growing number of films have particular appeal to the males. Further, the so-called ^soap-opera product that was. prominent on re¬ lease schedules in past, and obvi¬ ously lured the femmes, has been sharply cut down. .Sindlinger, in his analysis, lists 20 productions as being those “most talked about” by the public during the Sept. 1 week. According to sta¬ tisticians in the picture business, at least five of these have marked ap¬ peal for men, thus can rely less on the femme shoppers for gross rev¬ enue. Five comprise “Moby Dick,” “Somebody Up There Likes Me,” “Away All Boats,” “Johnny Con¬ cho” and “Fastest Gun Alive.” It’s to be noted further that hone of the 20 listed by Sindlinger would seem to have more appeal for wom¬ en than men. Check of the releasing skeds from the various companies reveals that a growing number of proper¬ ties are of the western and rugged western action classification. Co¬ lumbia’s “Harder. They Fall,” anent the rackets in the prizefight game, might be considered an example. If there’s to be much more of this it will be like kissing a growing percentage of the femme audience goodbye. ALLIED ARTISTS ADDS 4 BROMBERG EXCHANGES Los Angeles, Oct. 2. Allied * Artists acquired four Southern exchanges formerly owned and operated by the - late Arthur Bromberg, as of Sept. 30. Exchanges include Atlanta, Mem¬ phis, New Orleans and Charlotte. No change in personnel will bp made at any of these branches, ac¬ cording to prexy Steve Broidy, who reported that based on per¬ formance to date this year the four exchanges rep 16.58% of company’s domestic gross. AA also is considering the ad¬ visability of opening an exchange in Jacksonville, Fla., to further in¬ crease distribution efficiency, in the Bouth,* Broidy states. ’ Distribs in New York hear 4 that the J. Arthur Rank Organization’s John Davis is now definitely launched on the idea of setting up a Rank distribution outfit here in the Slates. Dav's is due to arrive here Oct. 15 with a view to pur¬ suing the project and laying the necessary groundwork for it. Giving further credence to the reports is the fact that, with on* or two exceptions, none of the im¬ portant Rank films of recent months has been sold to U. S. dis¬ tribs. It’s assumed that, if Rank ini¬ tiates his own office, he’ll also ac¬ quire a couple of theatres. That would be in line with prior pro¬ nouncements by Davis, who for years has castigated U. S. exhibs for “refusing” to play his product. He even went to the length of pointing this out in a fullpago N. Y. Times ad last year. Rank films in the past have been offered in two “spli's” to Universal and United Artists. U has practi¬ cally ceased to take them and so has UA whose board chairman, Robert'Benjamin, also happens to be the head of the American Rank organization. A package of Bank pix, anchored around “Doctor at Sea,” was sold to Republ : c, ■ . Indies like Walter Reade’s .Con¬ tinental Distributing have been try¬ ing to license a block of Rank pix on the theory that continuity of supply would be a help in mer¬ chandising the films. So far, Da¬ vis hasn’t gone for such a deal, and here—again—the possibility, looms that he’s conserving his product for his own projected outfit. Rank once before leased houses in N. Y. Ho had both the Park Ave¬ nue Theatre and the! Winter Gar¬ den, but failed tq^make a go of either. It’s pointed out .that, in reoent years, the acceptance of im¬ ports, particularly British, has grown in the U. S. and that Davis, like his contemporaries in Europe, must be impressed by the Ameri¬ can exhibitors’ argument that they are short on product. American distribution execs take the position that a Rank entry into the market would be welcome all around in that it would serve as a firsthand reminder to Davis of the difficulties that are encountered in the selling of imported films, even at a time when the Hollywood sup¬ ply is said to be “short.”. Carthay Circle Primpng For Todd-AO But Also Foresees Cinemiracle Los Angeles, Oct. 2. A remodeling project costing $130,000 got underway at the Carthay Circle Theatre yesterday (Mon.) as Fox-West Coast began preparing the house for occupancy by Mike Todd's “Around the World in 80 Days.” For the last 17 months, the Wilshire area deluxer has functioned as a legit house. Longrange view of circuit is to make Hie house the locale for new Cinemiracle process, National Theatres' bigsereen system. In view of this, a part of the balcony will be cut away, losing about 200 seats, to provide a straight projec¬ tion throw, either for Todd-AO or such three strip processes as Cinerama or Cinemiracle. The “80 Days” deal calls for a minimum of six months arid can¬ not be extended beyond a year without *F-WC's consent. At any time after the six months period, Todd can cancel on a four-week notice Lease starts around Christ¬ mas and provides for a flat Weekly rental under which FWC will staff and manage with the lessee bearing the costs.

The Mountain (V’VISION—COLOR) Mostly ineffective entertain¬ ment but with terrificly excit¬ ing mountain - climbing se¬ quences and names of Spencer Tracy; Robert Wagner to help. After more than 20 years “It Happened One Night” is back, but newly titled and in the modem dress of Cinemascope and Techni¬ color and with some musicalization added. As when Clark Gable and Claudette. Colbert performed it under director Frank Capra, it’s still the tale of the rich and head¬ strong young miss who, in seeking to be with her fortune-hunting husband against - her father’s wishes, meets, loves and wiys newspaperman. ^June Allyson is the girl. Jack Lemmon the reporter and “You Can’t Run Away From It” makes for some good fun some of the time. The plot is not much on its .own; comic incidents‘and humor- * ous characterizations must be re¬ lied upon. This is the approach to the, laughs, this development of story asides that score well enough to carry the . load. At. least, well enough to make on the overall an all right, not ^outstanding, diver¬ sion. ... With Dick Powell calling the turns as both producer and di¬ rector, the entry hits some delight¬ ful highpoints of jocularity but there also are some slow spots. It’s the unevenness of pace that keeps the comedy from top-rung. Foundation is laid as Miss Ally- son .skips Pappy’s yacht, boards a Greyhound incognito and heads for the husband she had been forced to leave immediately, after the nuptials. Picture takes a sprightly turn as Stubby Kaye, fat and jolly sailor boy on the bus, engages fellow pas¬ sengers in a spirited amusingly- worded “Howdy, Howdy, Howdy Friends and Neighbors.” This is one of the colorful musical items that dot the comedy, the color de¬ rived from Johnny Mercer’s lyrics. On the other hand, the tune of the title has a fetching quality, as penned by Gene de Paul, but it’s done in the background and Mer¬ cer’s lyrics are indistinguishable. Miss Allyson and Lemmon, who’s riding the same vehicle, are an affable combo in the leads, she looking chic and playing it straight as the rich chick'and he handling comic bits of business with provo¬ cative brazeness. Other “incidental” people in the scripe such as Kaye, who contrib¬ ute sparkle along the route, in¬ clude Paul Gilbert, as a fast jive- talking “buswolf”; Jim Backus, as the jalopy owner who tries to swipe Lemnion’s suitcase; Henny Youngman, in for a bit as a bus driver, and Walter Baldwin and Howard McNear as motel oper¬ ators. Charles Bickword measures up as Miss Allyson’s gruff millionaire father, as do Allyn Joslyn, editor driven to near distraction by Lem¬ mon’s promises of a “big story,” i.e., anent the location of the missing heiress,' and Jacques Scott as Miss Allyson’s short-lived hus¬ band. The hitch-hiking sequence from the original is reprised here, set to a ditty, as are the scenes of the two principals * sharing the same cabin with a blanket, hilled the Wall of Jericho, suspended be¬ tween their beds in the interest of propriety.

Other famil¬ iar. names to help include Claire Trevor, William Demarest and Richard Arl'en. Ranald MacDougall’s screen¬ play from the Henri Troyat novel centers virtually all action on Tracy and Wagner, leaving the other cast, members with what amounts to no more than walkons. Story development and the charac¬ ter establishment is not too good; nor is the dialog. The Tracy-Wag- ner characters of brothers of wide¬ ly different ages never exert a strong audience pull, so interest is inclined to wander often except when the terrifying mountain climb is on the screen. Except for his big finale scene, iri which he abortively tries, to lie the dead brother into heroic stat¬ ure, Tracy’s performance is no more than adequate. Wagner is hardly that in his portrayal of the spoiled kid brother, but Draytryk’s direction, uneven throughout, must share some of the blame. The other players are competent in the little they have to do, with Barbara Darrow and Anna Kashfi spotting brief bits of femme interest in minor spots. Plot peg that brings on that har¬ rowing trip up the mountain, al¬ most realistic enough to cause acrophobia, is built around Wag¬ ner’s urge the mountain valley and his too-kindly, simple-minded eld¬ er brother. He tricks his brother into guiding him to an Alpine peak on which a Caleutta-to-Paris plane has crashed so he can rob the dead, They find Miss Kashfi, Hindu girl, the only survivor and Tracy brings her down against the violent oppo¬ sition of Wagner, now mad with lust for the money and jewels he has found on the dead. During the descent, Wagper falls to his death and Tracy tries to tell the villagers the robbery plot was his and the rescue idea that of his brother. Story ends as they express quiet disbelief. On-location scenes in the Alps have been beautiful lensed in VistaVision and Technicolor by Franz F. Planer. The special pho¬ tographic effects by John P. Ful¬ ton and the process photography by Farciot Edouart are both good and bad. Some studio-staged scenes in the mountain-climbing are too obviously faked, while others have, a frightening reality. Editing is not smooth, maybe ac¬ counting for some of the pic’s un¬ evenness. Daniele Amfitheatrof’s score is effective. He also did the title tune with Mack David, o. : i vJBfrotf. An Indian problem , of adjusting himself to the white man’s preju¬ dices in Oklahoma a couple of gen¬ erations ago gets the “adult theme’’ treatment in “Reprisal.” There’s suspense and action iri this Colum¬ bia release but lack of names may restrict its grossing potential. Title’s brevity could also he handicap. For while the tag will obviously fit nicely on a marquee, at the same time it conveys little to prospective patrons as to the nature of the story. Trio of script- ers, David P. Harmon, Raphael Hayes and David Dortort, fashioned the screenplay from Harmon’s story based on a novel by Arthur Gordon. They avoid the cliches of. the . average western In tracing the troubles of partTndian Guy Madi¬ son who poses as a white man: Madison, a quiet type who keeps, to himself, buys a tract of range land to raise prime beef. But bordering on the property is the ranch of three brothers—Michael Pate, Edward Platt and Wayne Mal¬ lory..-Freshly acquitted of lynch¬ ing two Indians for trespassing, they look upon Madison as an in¬ truder. Feud arises between the factions and is resolved only when Madison wipes out the remaining brothers after one was slain ear¬ lier by a vengeful Indian. Strong romantic interest in the footage has Felicia Farr, daughter of land agent Robert Burton; tak¬ ing a fancy to Madison. She’s jeal¬ ous of Kathryn Grant, an Indian gal who falsely swears Madison ’’spent the night with me” to save him from lynching. Windup finds the part-Indlan, disillusioned with the white man’s customs, returning to the fold along with Miss Farr who’s cast her lot with him. Madison does well as the strong silent type, professing to be indif¬ ferent to the white man’s slurs on his race. Miss Farr likewise is im¬ pressive as a courageous frontier femme who knows the Indians are victims of injustice. Miss Grapi is amply sultry and sexy as an Injun maiden with no lack pf suitors. Pate, Platt and Mallory, as the three feudin' brothers, are okay as the menaces. Good support is pro¬ vided by Burton and Otto Hulett, as a sheriff, among others. George Sherman’s direction paces the plot nicely in the Lewis J. Rachmil production. Both the sweeping outdoor vistas and in¬ teriors are ably captured by the Technicolor camera of Henry Freu- lich. Jerome Thoms edited to a tight 74 minutes and the Mischa Bakaleinikoff score adequately hack the films overall mood. Gilb. will have the impact of some of its I historical predecessors. Superbly, If sometimes unevenly, photoed by top lenser Gabriel Fig- eroa, the pictorial values of the wild and turbulent 1900’s are faith¬ fully and Imaginatively captured in Eastmancolor. Major failing is the evident maturity of the two stars, whose faces, and sometimes figures, are unsuited storywise to the hon¬ est hot eye of Figeroa’s color lens. Nevertheless, local audiences seem to accept th{s sort of thing and go for Maria Felix and Pedro Arman¬ dariz. Going back to the period when gangs- of poverty stricken peons worked, in slavery, on the rich haciendas of Mexico, film unfolds tale of love and revolution against background of cactus fields, im¬ mense panoramas and alternating peasant and plush interiors. Basic¬ ally, it is the story 'of a peasant leader’s fight for his principles and his eventual return to his people. Interwoven with this theme is his love for a poor girl; who has be¬ come a demi-mondaine,' and who later joins him and the revolution, only to die unwittingly at his hands. Armandariz performs with his usual force and conviction but Miss Felix walks through her role, holding back fairly well on the theatrics. Others in the cast carry their S es and epaulets in a realistic >p, with the Soler brothers^ Andres and Domingo, outstanding. 1 Latter playing Armandariz’ father, gives a top performance as a griz¬ zled peasant fighter. The former comes across well in the role of a tough regular Army officer. Director Roberto Gavelflon, wfyo also gets partial scripting credit, has played the obvious propaganda for air its worth, grouping and mov¬ ing his characters, at times, some¬ what stiffly. Battles between the peons and regulars arc well staged, particularly the night scenes. A major, assist is given by Raul Lavisr ta’s musical score, which punches hard alongside the dramatic sweep of the photography. Pete.

Appearance of William Bishop, young cattleman'driving a herd of cattle the Indians try to buy, adds further to Brian’s fury \\yhen Bishop tries to help half¬ white gal, and windup shows Brian burning to death in a teepee he has set on fire. Miss Wynn is a pretty breed and Bishop a noble young man, Brian the heavy with a Swedish accent. Characters under Ray Nazarro’s direction are stereotyped. Techni¬ cal credits are stock in the Wallace MacDonald production. Whit. Suspense Ingredients are piled up well enough but “Julie” goes overboard both on plot and length. Story of an attractive young lady, Doris Day. who discovers her sec¬ ond husband. Louis Jourdan, is a murderer and aims to kill her, is paced at a good clio under An¬ drew L. Stone’s ' direction. But too much story Is crowded in; plausibility runs thin and some portions of the audience might grow weary. Stone’s story is of the old school—the chase, with heavy melodramatic punctuation marks. It has Miss Day coming upon the realization that Jourdan had killed her first mate and Is insane with I jealously so much so that he’d murder her rather than lose her. I She takes off under the protection of a country club associate, Barry Sullivans, and Jourdan undertakes to track them down. Neither the writing nor the di¬ recting is particularly imaginative, both departments falling back noon standardization. As the San Francisco police, headed by Frank Lovejnv, become convinced that. Miss Day is In danger, as she had Insisted, they move in to guard her but she unintentionally eludes them. She takes the elevator down from the apartment just as thev. take the stairs ud, etc. The climax. rather anti¬ climax. has Miss Day in her for¬ mer job afr'flh-Hnes hostess, with Jourdan bo^dln** the plane un¬ detected.

Paul Brinegar “Flight to Hong Kong” is given a lift by backdropping its unfold- ment against actual locations in China and other foreign parts, but episodic treatment of a routine story necessarily slows film’s pace. Characters are colorful, however, and with the name of Rory Cal¬ houn to spark its chances feature should stack up okay for the ac¬ tion trade, _ The Joseph M. Newman-Vic Or- satti production twirls around an international crime syndicate, which lends justification Sor the constant hoppiftg about the globe.

Del Guidice was responsible for a series of successful pix under the Two -Ci'ies Films banner in Brit¬ ain. He left there in 1949 and re¬ tired to Milan. Kaufman is head of Grand Prize Films in N. Y. Back last week from a lengthy European trip, Kaufman said Del Guidice had been able to secure unique financial backing for “An¬ thony and Cleopatra” plus some other films. Under the arrange¬ ment, Kaufman will seek an Amer¬ ican distributor to handle “An¬ thony” in the world market, ex¬ cluding the country where the film is to be made. However, the U. S. outfit’s commitment doesn’t begin untiL the picture is completed, so that it’s not asked to share in any of the usual production risks. It’s the distribution commitment that will secure the nepessary financ¬ ing. Kaufman said Del Guidice’s only condition is that he and Kaufman be permitted to handle the initial runs of “Anthony,” turning the film over for general release later on. This is in line with Del Guidice’s long-held belief that imports and Unusual pix require ‘that special kind of buildup before they can be committed to a distributor for gen¬ eral distribution. Other pix planned by' the Del Guidice-Kaufman combo are “Be¬ tween Heart & Heaven,” based on a world War II incident. Terence *°ung may direct, with Alec Guin¬ ness, Peter Ustinov and Gregory **eck named as possibilities for ihe Jarring role. Casting will de¬ pend on the type of release the fil m gets. Also on the sked is Verdi’s “La ^f a y i ota,” which is planned for next May, after Milan's La Scala oioses. Maria Callas is being sought for the lead. It’ll be. the .fuH-length pic to be shot by m m the La Scala. , Kaufman reported he had ob¬ tained the original negative to the German VMuenchhaus.en” picture from the International. Film Union at the principality of Lichtenstein and that, the picture was being currently dubbed at Remagen, Ger¬ many. Kaufman has the U. S. rights and the rights to most of the English speaking world to the pic, which was the Nazis’ epic to end all epics. “Muenchhausen,”’ whose Ownership in the U. S. was dis¬ puted in the courts, has had at least one commercial date in the original German version in this country. VOLUME VS. COSTS ENDING REPUBLIC’S FOREIGN OFFICES 20TH TAKES OVER?) TODD CALLS GUILD MISLED ON ‘CREDITS’ Hollywood, Oct. 2. . Writers Guild of America West based its arbitration decision on screenplay credits for “Around the World in 80 Days” on “er¬ roneous” information, Mike Todd declared in notifying the Guild that he would not attend a sched¬ uled Oct. & meeting to discuss the situation. Todd reminded Guild officials that he is not a signatory to the basic agreement covering writers and is not, therefore, bound by its decisions. Guild ordered Todd to give credit to James Foe, John Farrow and S. J. Perelman. Todd de¬ clared the picture would carry a solo credit for Perelman as the author Of the “majority” of the work. : - . In a lengthy telegram to the Guild, Todd declared that his con¬ stant attention to the details of the production “from its inception to its completion” made him fully cognizant of the contributions of all concerned. “I know,” he added, “of my own Ijiersohal knowledge, that Poe made no contribution to the pro¬ duction that would entitle him to any credit.” Producer noted that he ‘’had. been informed the arbitration de¬ cision was based on scripts sub¬ mitted by his office, since Poe had offered no evidence and said that if the arbitrati"
