Auer Laszlo & Monika Apathy III\n\n[inactive] Sopron (Ãdenburg), Hungary Eva Horvath b. 7 May 1922, Sopron, d. 30 Dec 1967. Auer Al Musser Markt Allhau (AlhÃ³) Settled in Alberta, Canada, 1925. Auer Peter Herhacker Buchschachen (OribÃ¼kkÃ¶sd) The Urbarium of 1767 counts 67 farmers and 17 SÃ¶llner. One of the mentioned farmer names was \"AUER\". Now, when I did some years ago some research about the Auer-family in Pressburg/ Pocsony / Bratislava, in the year 1740 there was a remark to find about Georg Auer living Buchschachen, son of Johann Andreas Auer, evang. confession. Georg AUER then was at least about 20 years old, probably born before 1720. He, his father or grandfather is probably the common ancestor of all the AUERS who emigrated to Hungary or the US. Someone told me the right / parish / Matrikel would be Kitzladen to search about that? How to find out which other families are affiliated with (Georg) AUER through marriage? How to find out more about the family history before and after 16xx - 17xx?
