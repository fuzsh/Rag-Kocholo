        "text": "You find yourself doing a lot of things over the holidays and break—if you are lucky enough to have a holiday break—that you might otherwise not.\n\nOne example is socially drinking for thirty consecutive days. Another is idle listmaking; I got to exchanging “If You Haven’t Seen It, It’s New To You!™” top-old-films-for-the-year lists with a couple of friends, and I thought my results might just as well be shared:\n\nBell, Book and Candle (1958, Richard Quine)\n\nThe Big Trail (1930, Raoul Walsh)\n\nThe Cavern (1964, Edgar Ulmer)\n\nThe Funhouse (1981, Tobe Hooper)\n\nThe Italian Connection (1972, Fernando di Leo)\n\nMake Way for Tomorrow (1937, Leo McCarey)\n\nDes Morts (1979, Jean-Pol Ferbus, Dominique Garny, Thierry Zeno)\n\nThe Other (1972, Robert Mulligan)\n\nNothing But a Man (1964, Michael Roemer)\n\nRemorques (1941, Jean Gremillon)\n\nThey Made Me a Fugitive (1947, Alberto Cavalcanti)\n\nThe Tiger of Eschnapur (1959, Fritz Lang)\n\nTwilight’s Last Gleaming/ Ulzana’s Raid (1977/ 1972, Robert Aldrich) (Talking of aging Burt Lancaster, I also liked Visconti’s Conversation Piece of 1974 a helluva a lot.)\n\nWake in Fright (1971, Ted Kotcheff)\n\nThe Window (1949, Ted Tetzlaff)\n\nOne can do a good deal of reading up on the burning issues of the day, as well. Over the preceding weeks, many a pundit and most everyone in my social networking groupthink feed made indignant hay from NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre’s comments about the shootings in Newtown, CT—and, yes, Right On. I am, however, always a little suspicious of any approach to a social problem that seeks to shunt full burden for responsibility onto the Other’s rights and pleasures (i.e. Automatic weapons), without any attendant examination of one’s own cherished rights and pleasures—or those one defends from the bugbear of censorship. (i.e. Splatterhouse for TurboGrafx-16, Natural Born Killers, and whatever other weirdly Clinton-era pop ephemera LaPierre excavated.) I have, therefore, been mulling over a number of articles with titles like “How to Change Pop Culture’s Reliance on Violence,” without landing upon any workable solution—save perhaps my own.\n\nIn Anthony Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange, and Stanley Kubrick’s film of the same title, a process called The Ludovico Technique, entailing of an overdose of ultraviolent and pornographic imagery, is applied to sociopathic teenager Alex in order to make the chastened subject ill at the very thought of transgression. I suspect that there is a fallacy in this conceit; that rather than making the subject nauseous at the sight of the red, red kroovy, the actual application of the Ludovico Technique would result instead in making them terribly bored with it. I believe this to be so because, in my largely unsupervised youth, I submitted myself to a form of the Ludovico Technique. As a tender stripling of ten I had watched not only Clockwork Orange, but “Eightball” being blasted to pieces in slow-motion by sniper fire in Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket. As an adolescent I was listening to NWA’s “Just Don’t Bite It” and leafing through unbelievably seedy three-pack porno slicks (Genesis, anyone?) at John Shimkoviak’s house. As a teenager I was ingesting every Shockumentary on the market, including the no-redeeming-social-or-artistic-value Traces of Death series, emceed by a sardonic narrator called Brain Damage who contributed witless commentary to documentary images of human beings being rudely butted off of this mortal coil. (i.e. “Looks like he caught the Express!” as a father of four is pasted by an Amtrak.)\n\nThe end result? When watching dull, thrill-kill, for-its-own-sake violence today, the desire for a nap immediately settles over this subject. The moment that James Brolin clipped off a thug’s hand through an elevator gate in Gangster Squad, which I recently took in at a press screening, my unaddressed mind felt free to drift into the cosmos. A modest proposal, then, based on this admittedly limited control group: Officially devote a period of the school day—I am thinking English, which today mostly has the effect of putting off anyone who has an aptitude for it—to Ludovico Technique! Just you watch those teenaged boys swarm to their Renoir retros and classical music youth associations!\n\nTalking of violent pastimes: With idle holiday days on hand, one turns to entertainments that one might not otherwise be drawn to. I paid good money to enter Paul Brown Stadium for a game in which a (partially backup) Cincinnati Bengals team best a (mostly backup) Baltimore Ravens team, 23-17, a match with almost no playoff consequences whatsoever. This enabled me to view what was likely the last and nearly the first impressive play of Bruce Gradkowski’s NFL career, a 44-yarder to Brandon Tate, as well as to marvel at the PBS PA announcer’s almost pathological obsession with the phrase “stacked up,” and to note with sadness that the LED screen pregame-hype video that had been in place since 2000 has been updated with a new, marginally less chintzy version. It is fascinating, in strolling around PBS, to note the many little signs of Bengals owner Mike Brown’s legendary stinginess—in contrast, say, to the famous largesse of Jerry Jones’ stately pleasure dome in Arlington. So that one won’t miss a moment of on-field action, the PBS concession areas are equipped with TVs, as is standard—but they’re tube televisions, about 32”s. In fact, I think they may be the same model that my local sports bar—the one with imitation wood paneling and $6.00 buckets-of-Bud and a troglodytic woman with a squint installed at the end of the bar—threw out three seasons ago.\n\nI also saw some movies that I might not, in the ordinary run of things, have seen. I saw Jack Reacher—that rare film whose title no amount of tampering could make sound any more like gay porn—at the AMC Newport on the Levee 20 in Northern Kentucky, where the “MacGuffin’s” pub in the lobby is slated to open next week. I have hardly found a word that I disagree with in any of the savage write-ups of Jack Reacher that I have encountered, and yet I think very little that I saw in 2012 will stay with me like the lone scene shared by Tom Cruise and screen nemesis Werner Herzog, two extraordinarily tenacious careerists from very different sectors of the film world. It should also be noted that Reacher contains the year’s second-best establishing shot of a fiftysomething male star waking up in a room next to a young woman’s stunning be-thonged ass, the best of course being Denzel’s in Flight. I almost hope this shot keeps recurring until it becomes a Hollywood inside joke, like the Wilhelm scream, or… well, like Hollywood itself!\n\nI did see a foreign film as well—or the nearest variant that plays the Midwest, New Zealand’s The Hobbit. Although I’d variously enjoyed each installment of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, I supposed I had had enough. I expressly did not intend to see The Hobbit. I think it was something about the swaggering laziness of the trading cards subway adverts, consisting of nothing but pictures of the dwarvish dramatis personae, as if to say: “We don’t even need to try. You know you’re going to see it.”\n\nThey were right, goddamn it, and I’ve no regrets. I was suitably gobsmacked by those ethereal Edward Burne-Jones elves upon returning to Rivendell. I was moved by the covetous pathos of Gollum, Andy Serkis’s finest performance since Planet of the Apes. (“Is he just really good at crouching?” a friend asked me as we were discussing Serkis’s cornering the market on CG performance.) I found, in The Hobbit, a quest film that bore its comparable runtime considerably better than Django Unchained and, in Tolkien’s Middle Earth, a considerably more seductive—and certainly better-researched—immersive environment than Tarantino’s Deep South. Both Tolkien and Tarantino, as I’m sure has been pointed out already, draw from the mythological wellspring of the German Nibelungenlied, although Tolkien’s 1938 response to a German publisher, which made the rounds yesterday on the anniversary of the author’s birth, would alone be enough to mark him a more courageous figure than the mood-faced peddler of provocation—if indeed it was posted.\n\nWatching The Hobbit, I thought back to 2001 when Fellowship of the Ring, the first of Jackson’s Ring films, came out, and to the professor of the medieval literature class that I was then taking, Dr. Thomas Limouze, who would recite Piers Plowman and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight to us in Old English. He complained that Fellowship had stripped Tolkien’s story of its restive, its pastoral, and its idyllic moments, leaving only the hard spine of action. I wondered if the niggling, minutiae-obsessed The Hobbit was the sort of Tolkien movie that Dr. Limouze, a medievalist like Tolkien, had hoped for; certainly it doesn’t seem to be the sort of movie that many a film critic wanted, even as its trotted-out technology has promoted much conversation. In the NY Review of Books, for example, J. Hoberman found himself “wondering what percentage of CGI is necessary for a movie to be considered graphic rather than photographic,” while referencing Ralph Bakshi’s rotoscoped Lord of the Rings of 1978, a film that was so dear to me as a young man, reading Dragonlance paperbacks faster than Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman could write them. In fact, to this day I cannot watch the following—shades of that Full Metal Jacket sniper scene—without a terrific shudder of emotion:\n\nFor a goodly portion of The Hobbit’s runtime, it all came back in an atavistic geyser—the boyish Anglophilia and the obsession with ancient martial tradition and Sir Thomas Mallory and all manner of smiting and cleaving in twain. Not an argument for great art, perhaps, but one for mighty entertainment. And it is nice to know that the economy of New Zealand is secure for another year. Which brings us, I believe, to our first outro jam of 2013…\n\nEvery month or so for the past year and some change, Cristina Cacioppo, programmer at 92YTribeca has been good enough to locate and screen a 35mm film print of a title determined by myself and my fellow guest programmer, Film Comment’s Nic Rapold, for a little shindig that goes by the name ‘Overdue.’\n\nDuring our tenure as guest programmers, the successes—a sold-out black-clad crowd for The Cure in Orange, a double-bill of director Larry Yust’s features that seemed to truly wow all present—have just about equaled the disappointments—the print of Andre de Toth’s Play Dirty that had mellowed to the color of Pepto Bismol, the Joe Don Baker mini-retro that New York City was apparently not crying out for, the screening of James Gunn’s Squirm attended by exactly no-one, including the hosts. For whatever reason, Cristina has kept inviting us back—this despite her having recently called me “unsavory” while in her cups at a holiday party.\n\nI am not sure what she meant by this, though I think it was meant affectionately. Possibly it has something to do with my having the fashion sense of a giallo strangler, or my having been fascinated at an impressionable age by John Larroquette’s Dan Fielding on Night Court, or my championing of movies like the highly unsavory James Woods vehicle Cop (1988), which we screened last night to a scanty but responsive audience.\n\nCop’s writer-director, James B. Harris, extracted the film’s story from the larger framework of James B. Ellroy’s 1984 novel “Blood on the Moon.” Altogether there have been a dozen Ellroy adaptations, most notably Curtis Hanson’s L.A. Confidential and Brian De Palma’s Black Dahlia, but Cop was the first.\n\nI’d first heard of Cop from a friend in France. Bertrand Tavernier and Pierre Rissient hold the film in high regard, and for all I know it may be universally acknowledged as a masterpiece over there. (In Emmanuel Bordieu’s 2006 Les amitiés maléfiques, it’s a fun detail that Thibault Vinçon’s know-it-all intellectual bully is an Ellroy expert.) In fact, if I’d had my druthers, yesterday’s screening would’ve been a double-bill with Maurice Pialat’s Police (1985), another essential ‘80s cop pic which had audiences gasping when a street hood spat square in the face of Sophie Marceau, La Boum’s teen queen—imagine a similar desecration of Molly Ringwald! (Or find yourself a copy of Godard’s King Lear, also recently at 92YTribeca.)\n\nI was further intrigued on the subject of Harris by fellow SundanceNOW columnist Michael Atkinson’s definitive essay on his sporadic-but-pungent career, “Genuine B Noir: James B. Harris,” in which he called Cop the director’s “best and nastiest.” The piece is included Mr. Atkinson’s book Ghosts in the Machine: Speculating on the Dark Heart of Pulp Cinema, which you really should own if you do not already.\n\nThe films that he directed aside, Harris’s place in film history is secure thanks to an early association with another auteur. Fresh out of the Army, Harris was in the business of licensing films to TV broadcasters, in which capacity he was approached by an acquaintance, Stanley Kubrick, then attempting to get a few bucks for his Fear & Desire (which was recently released on Blu-ray by Kino International). This led to a professional producer-director partnership, Harris-Kubrick, with Harris going on to produce The Killing (whose source novel, Lionel White’s Clean Break, he had picked out and acquired the rights to), Paths of Glory, and Lolita, before embarking on a filmmaking career of his own beginning with the 1965 nuclear submarine picture The Bedford Incident. From the get-go, there was a queer dialogue between Harris’s films and Kubrick’s; as Atkinson notes, Harris’s debut “showed the strain of having to stand shivering in the shadow cast by Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove.” The influence, however, was not one-sided: you could make quite the double-feature of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut and Harris’s second film, 1973’s Some Call it Loving (also variously titled Sleeping Beauty and The Castle), which those of you in New York may see as part of BAM’s Richard Pryor retrospective on February 13th.\n\nAs for the rest of Harris’s career as writer-director, the Jim Thompson-penned The Killing, and mid-century noir in general, are pertinent points of reference. With 1982’s Fast-Walking, starring Woods as prison guard “Fast-Walking” Miniver, Harris entered the nearest thing to a period of steady work in his directing career, though he’s yet to helm a single, solitary hit. Fast-Walking was followed by Cop and, in 1993, Boiling Point, with Dennis Hopper and Wesley Snipes, who, as I never tire of reminding anyone who will listen, was once a very exciting leading man. Although he had an executive producer credit on Black Dahlia, Boiling Point was Harris’s last film as a director. He will be 85 years old this year, and is quite sharp in a seemingly-new interview recorded for Criterion’s 2011 DVD release of The Killing. James B. Harris Productions still keeps an office in Beverly Hills, and they will return your phone calls.\n\nBack to Cop: Woods, also one of the films’s producers, stars as Sgt. Lloyd Hopkins, a LAPD homicide detective who, investigating the brutal murder of a woman, begins to suspect that it’s the work of a serial killer who’s been plying his trade for the last fifteen years or so. Ellroy made a trilogy of books with the Hopkins character, and there is some scuttlebutt that Harris and Woods intended to make further Hopkins films, though Cop’s “disappointing” box-office put an end to any such notion.\n\nThe slim box-office was almost certainly attributable to the outright curled-lip nastiness, the unmitigated horndog skeeviness, with which Woods plays the lead. A lot of people don’t care for Woods the man, for he is a mouthy right-winger in an industry that leans left, but as an actor this seeming indifference to being liked, this reluctance to pump the audience for sympathy, is a rare gift. Even more rare is finding a director, like Harris, willing to take full advantage of it. It was reconfirmed for me just how rare this is only this week: In anticipation of the upcoming Jason Statham Parker film, I re-viewed previous movies adapted from Donald Westlake/Richard Stark’s novels about his Parker character, written as a pitiless man-machine, seeing in the process how so many interpretations (Jim Brown, Mel Gibson, Peter Coyote) insisted on garlanding Parker with little sprigs of humanity.\n\nThe sole humanizing agent in Hopkins’s life is his little daughter, with whom Woods appears in exactly one scene, telling her “bedtime stories” ripped from his case histories. When Hopkins’s wife upbraids him, he rebuts that he’s only preparing the girl for the world, that by protecting her from fairy tales he is protecting her from:\n\n“Expectations, the greatest woman killer of all-time, a terminal disease that starts way back when they’re all just little girls, when they’re being fed all the bullshit about being entitled to happiness like it’s a birthright. That’s what you don’t understand—when to stop perpetrating the myths that ruin their lives. Innocence kills, Jen. Believe me, it kills. I see it every fucking day of my life.”\n\nI suspect I may have smirked a little the first time I watched this domestic squabble, for the overheated exchange is rather close to the cop-opera parody of Chris Elliott’s chef d’oeuvre, Action Family. What has struck me in subsequent viewings, however, is the very real nervous energy that Woods trembles with, the eagerness with which he pounces for the phone as soon as his wife storms out of the bedroom, jumping at any opportunity for some action, any excuse to get out of the house. (On the line is the late Charles Durning, very good as Hopkins’ sometimes-partner Dutch.)\n\nThere is a “Dear John” waiting for Lloyd when he gets back to the office—exit wife and daughter—which frees him up to pursue his woman-killer, as well as to sport-fuck women tangentially involved in his police work. “Everyone knows you have a wild hair up your ass about murdered women” says Hopkins’s Born Again Captain—Raymond J. Barry in a self-contained twist on the hothead cliche—and though this is evidently true, for Hopkins does have a vigilantly protective attitude towards women, it is not at all clear that he likes them very much. It’s as though they’re forever letting him down with their penchant for getting butchered. (Those who know anything of Ellroy’s personal history know that Hopkins’s complex is also the author’s, referent to the central formative event of his life, his mother’s unsolved murder in 1958.)\n\nA crime-scene clue—a misplaced book of feminist poetry called, I believe, The Angry Womb, whose authoress has the “Har har” surname Van Dyke—leads Hopkins to canvassing feminist bookstores for leads. Hopkins is met—better to say intercepted—at the door of one such store called Feminist Bibliophile by the proprietress, Kathleen McCarthy, played by Lesley Ann Warren, smoking seriously and standoffish in black.\n\nThe centerpiece of the movie, in terms of performance and densely layered characterization, begins right here. When Ms. McCarthy demurs and allows Sgt. Hopkins to come in, the man who was introduced negotiating the precinct floor like he could do it with his eyes closed, who has a practiced old-hand patter with escorts, is for the first time thrown off-balance, shy and awkward in this strange environment surrounded by what might as well be foreign-language literature. (A detail one only catches in 35mm—a copy of Liv Ullmann’s Changing on display in the background.) He is also clearly impressed by the forbidding front that McCarthy puts up—she’s the one woman strong and disillusioned enough to meet his standard. (“Why can’t they fucking fly like us?” Hopkins bemoans of the weaker sex earlier, a line that is exceedingly enjoyable to quote.)\n\nHopkins, then, seems genuinely surprised when McCarthy accepts his meek invitation for a cup of coffee. When he brings her to a department party as his date, he is gallant and courteous and eager to please. As their evening together carries on into dinner, and as Ms. McCarthy gives way to Kathleen, she relaxes enough to begin emotionally denuding herself, telling Hopkins the story of her life, including a traumatic incident in high school where she was raped by two boys in the bathroom and subsequently abandoned by her clique of would-be poetesses. Kathleen then gives way to the Kathy of those days, and as she exposes her hidden vulnerability, the no-longer-cowed Hopkins steeples his fingers, attempting to muster appropriately sympathetic reactions, to keep up his flagging interest by treating the date like a soft interrogation. Back at the Feminist Bibliophile, Kathleen mentions a secret admirer who has been sending her doggerel poetry and dried flowers for a decade or more, and a supercilious smirk sneaks into Hopkins’s expression. He grows bored and restless, picking lint from the sofa, only snapping back to attention when Kathleen’s eyes land on him, finally perking up again when it seems like he’s actually going to get laid. And when Kathleen excuses herself to take a pre-coital shower, he exhales a long pent-up, eye-rolling, beleaguered “Jeeeeeee-sus Christ!” Every beat, every reaction shot, every brazenly off-putting actorly decision here is worked through to a level one rarely encounters in the best screen drama, not to speak of genre movies.\n\n“Is this a feminist movie?” a friend asked as I was chumming the waters of social media in hopes of getting asses in the seats for Cop. The short answer is “Errrm… ,” but I embellished this, stating that it was “better to say it takes place in the zone where hardline feminism and frothing misogyny overlap, like Fascism and Communism in the Schlesinger-Poole model.” Strange bedfellows—or perhaps not. The name of Warren’s character, Kathleen McCarthy, is, I believe, a nod to Catherine MacKinnon, the prosecutorial arm of militant feminist Andrea Dworkin’s anti-pornography crusade in the 1980’s, which linked arms with religious conservatives and Ronald Reagan’s Meese Commission. Thrillers, particularly those of Brian de Palma, were also popular targets, which is somewhat ironic, as these were the only mainstream movies actually willing to engage with the rhetoric of Take Back the Night—see for example Clint Eastwood’s Sudden Impact and Tightrope.\n\nAt the heart of Cop is a strange triangle indeed—between Sgt. Hopkins, Ms. McCarthy, and her fawning secret admirer, the poetaster who has been sending her flowers, not coincidentally, for just as long as Hopkins’ serial killer has been at work. In a neat piece of moral confusion, the villain of the piece is revealed as this sweet wallflower who, while carrying a torch for “Kathy” since high school, has been venting his repressed sexual aggression on other women. This leaves the gross and loutish Hopkins, who is at least honest about his venal appetites, to play the unlikely role of the white knight—chalk one up for the unsavory guys! (It’s also a time-tested piece of rhetorical self-justification by Ellroy, insisting that anyone who doesn’t wear their sleaziness on their sleeve must necessarily be a hypocrite.)\n\nTalking of which, among this week’s essential reading is Tom McCormack’s dissection of the thinly-veiled nastiness of the “Nice Guys of OKCupid,” which concludes with a text, “Pop-Punk Pick-Up Line,” which was previously unknown to me:\n\nThis certainly works for the progenitors of the genre, The Descendants, who expressed precisely this sentiment in songs like “Hope,” while, in “Marriage,” frontman Milo Aukerman sang the words every woman longs to hear: “I don’t want to have sex with you/ I want to be your friend.” But I have loved pop-punk for my entire post-adolescent life, and if there is any single credo that I live by, it is never to revise any aesthetic opinions determined at the wise age of 15, so I will counterpoint the “Pick-Up Line” with J. Church, expressing a sentiment appropriate to the deeply cynical Cop: “You should’ve known that a sensitive guy lives a lie, you can’t look him in the eye.”\n\n(R.I.P.

Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\nEvery so often I will run into an old acquaintance, or get a random text message, and have to field the question “Are you still in New York?” There is often a hint of incredulity to this, while that “still” suggests that the situation is something necessarily finite, something no sane person would keep up indefinitely.\n\nYes, in fact, I am still in New York City. As of February of 2013, I will have still been in New York for ten years.\n\nIt is—has anyone noticed this before?—a tough town, particularly in wintertime. I recall someone saying that everyone should live in New York, but not so long that they go hard, and everyone should live in California, but not so long that they go soft. (The latter point is supported by this much-circulated video for Los Angeles-based Wilderness Collective).\n\nWhen I was a kid, we’d play a game in which we’d get the playground carousel up to rotating at top speed, then hang off the edges of it, holding on for dear life. While a couple kids off to the side kept the carousel rotating apace, the riders would one by one lose their grip or go nauseous and tumble off into the rubber mulch. Whoever was left would have “won.” I have taken to relating this to New York City, which has shed so many of the people I’ve met herein who now ask me “Are you still in New York?”\n\nMy laughably few skills are monetizable in New York, if barely so, so here is where I still live. I spend a great deal of time these days in the apartment in North Brooklyn that I moved into six years ago, which I can neither afford nor afford to get rid of, and go into Manhattan only as often as business or, increasingly rarely, pleasure demands it.\n\nOver the last weekend, I was tempted in. A friend who was in Central Park sent me pictures he’d taken of the Park under a light snowfall, including the gingerbread loggia of the Dairy, along with the comment “Getting real Portrait of Jennie up in here.” The reference is to the David O. Selznick-produced William Dieterle film of 1948, based on a 1940 novel by Robert Natham, starring Selznick’s wife-to-be, Jennifer Jones, and Joseph Cotten. Cotten plays a painter named Eben Adams, who is one of many on the skids in New York City, 1934. Broke and hungry, wandering a winter-kissed Central Park, Adams meets a young girl named Jennie Appleton, played by Jones. At first Adams takes it as an imaginative child’s fancy when she tells him that she is visiting while her acrobat parents do an aerialist act at Hammerstein’s Hippodrome, for he knows the Hippodrome was torn down years ago. The next time they meet, however, the girl has almost overnight become a young woman, and Adams comes to understand that Jennie, who becomes his muse and his model and his love, is a figure somehow unstuck from time.\n\nPortrait of Jennie is generally remembered as one of the most lush and romantic films about New York City ever made, and not without reason. Putting its prestige-picture foot forward, it begins with epigrams from Keats and Euripedes, Debussy’s La Mer (conducted by Dimitri Tiompkin), and a ravishing God’s eye view of Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge, with rays of heavenly benediction shining down upon them. One moment in the film that has always particularly stuck with me, however, belongs to a homely subplot quite far away from such supernal splendors, a subplot that even the film’s greatest enthusiasts tend to get impatient with. Adams, in exchange for free corned beef-and-cabbage, takes a commission to paint a mural of Irish independence leader Mick Collins over the bar at a local pub, Moore’s Alhambra. During the mural’s big unveiling celebration, however, Adams doesn’t even take a cursory glance back at his handiwork. Cotton, a closely guarded actor, overplays nothing, but one can clearly discern in his tightened expression the self-disgust of a man who knows he’s doing work well below his talents just to survive. This also happens to be the look that Cotten wore through most of the latter part of his career—see for reference Sergio Corbucci’s 1966 Spaghetti Western The Hellbenders.\n\nThe film ends with another unveiling, a Technicolor blast in a mostly black-and-white, sometimes-tinted film, the fruits of Eben Adams’ labor, the offspring of his doomed out-of-time affair, the painting The Portrait of Jennie. It hangs in the Met where it is seen being admired by a group of schoolgirls, including an uncredited future-First Lady Nancy Davis, who make inane comments about it. There it will hang forever, a monument to love, as one supposes Selznick imagined The Portrait of Jennie—with accompanying (unused) title song by Nat King Cole—would remain a monument to his love for the film’s starlet. The actor Robert Walker, best remembered as Bruno from Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train and Jones’ first husband, undoubtedly watched the whole thing in the grips of ulcerous rage. He and his then-wife had left New York City together for Hollywood, where he was contracted to MGM and she to Selznick, who was already fitting Walker with the horns of a cuckold. Walker never thereafter recovered his mental equilibrium, and died in 1951, when the intravenous administration of a sedative clashed with his typically astronomical blood-alcohol level. He was 32, and probably regretted ever leaving New York and the cozy Long Island home he’d once shared with the girl then-named Phyllis Walker and their two sons.\n\nThe Portrait of Jennie canvas, which would hang in the Selznick-Jones estate after their marriage, was painted by Robert Brackman, a teacher at the Art Student’s League and, in the words of some who would know better than I, “a master of 20th century American Realism.” Be that as it may, The Portrait of Jennie is not his best work. In fact, paintings made expressly to appear in Hollywood movies are almost always lousy*—I adore An American in Paris as much as anyone but, judging from the canvases he’s hawking, Gene Kelly’s starving artist Jerry Mulligan deserves to starve.\n\nThe great exceptions to this above rule are the stark, haunted pieces of outsider art turned out by Edward G. Robinson’s henpecked Sunday painter Christopher Cross in the bathroom of his Greenwich Village walkup in Fritz Lang’s 1945 Scarlet Street. These paintings, about a dozen of which appear in the movie, were the work of John Decker, son of a Prussian Guards colonel who abandoned his child in London, where the orphaned Decker took up stage scenery, and studied painting under Walter Sickert. Decker could work fluently in a number of idioms, and was allegedly a successful forger of Old Masters—there has been some scuttlebutt as to if the Rembrandt “Head of Christ” at Harvard’s Fogg Gallery was the same that Gene Fowler, in his autobiography, recalled Decker pawning off on the character actor Thomas Mitchell. Decker was the subject of a biography by Stephen Jordan, Bohemian Rogue, which I have not read, and figures centrally in Gregory William Mank, Charles Heard, and Bill Nelson’s Hollywood’s Hellfire Club, which I have, and highly recommend for its depiction of the mutually-assured self-destruction by the group of carousing nihilists who met at Decker’s tudor lodge in Brentwood. Their number included Fowler, W.C. Fields, John Barrymore, Errol Flynn, and Sadakichi Hartmann, a German-Japanese aesthete who had known Walt Whitman in Camden. Loafing and inviting their souls in bibulous debauches, this group was collectively christened The Bundy Drive Boys, and almost all of them were dead of drink well ahead of Walker.\n\nTo return to Scarlet Street: The canvas that particularly sticks with me depicts a street scene over which the metal gridwork of an elevated train line—presumably the Sixth Avenue el—creates a proscenium stage. The el’s two pair of stanchions are matched to two drooping streetlamps that cast triangular pools of light. One shines on a lone female figure, waiting on the cobblestone street without apparent purpose—possibly a streetwalker, like Joan Bennett’s alluring and terrible Kitty in the film. The other highlights a section of an enormous snake’s body, which is wound through the el’s track trellis and around the stanchion. Cross, by way of Decker, seems to be thinking of Eve and the Serpent; whatever the case, here is an image that comes far closer to the spirit of urban desolation than Brackman’s portrait does to romantic transport. I wonder where these Scarlet Street pictures are today? Robinson, the first to buy from Frida Kahlo, was a keen art collector…\n\nThe Portrait of Jennie never actually hung in the Met, though—who knows?—a Quatrrocento by John Decker just might. I followed my friend’s cue and went to Central Park the next day, after the picturesque snow had mostly melted away, then headed to the Met to see the George Bellows show. I’d previously seen it at the National Gallery in Washington D.C., though I had been discovering George Bellows in one place or another over much of the previous year: His A Stag at Sharkey’s at the Cleveland Art Museum, lithograph drawings of Billy Sunday at the Boston Public Library, the mizzling Rain on the River at the RISD Museum of Art, Two Women in the Brooklyn Museum’s traveling “Youth and Beauty: Art of the American Twenties” show, Blue Snow, The Battery and Snow Dumpers at the mostly-woeful Columbus Museum of Art, whose greatest virtue is its Bellows collection.\n\nGeorge Wesley Bellows was, like myself, an Ohio man. Born 1882, he came from a small town forty miles west of Columbus called Mechanicsburg, which I drove through once as it lay under a virgin snow of the sort that Bellows so liked to paint. Attending The Ohio State University, Bellows was a formidable athlete as well as artist. He even had an offer from the Cincinnati Reds to play shortstop, and I have amused myself by imagining that, under different circumstances, he might have played on the same team as Freaks director Tod Browning, who came from Louisville and was a lifelong Reds fan, and whose deaf-mute uncle, Pete Browning, was one of the most feared sluggers of his era.\n\nInstead of gobbling up grounders off the bat of Tyrus Raymond Cobb, Bellows moved to New York City, where he studied at the New York School of Art under Robert Henri, and where he found his great subjects, like the tin can fight at the top of this page which comes very close to a scene from Stephen Crane’s Maggie. Opening a lukewarm review of the Met’s Bellows show in The Times, Roberta Smith leads with Sherwood Anderson’s eulogy for the artist: “Anderson wrote that Bellows’s last paintings ‘keep telling you things. They are telling you that Mr. George Bellows died too young. They are telling you that he was after something, that he was always after it.’”\n\nSmith’s assessment that the chronologically-arranged show has a soft middle is not incorrect. It’s certainly frontloaded, for the first rooms contain Bellows’ sporting subjects like Stag, where a well-placed counterpunch makes Francis Bacon of an opponent’s head, bedraggled landscapes of the Pennsylvania Station excavation pit and Riverside Park and the Cloisters (where Jennie Appleton went to convent school!), and portraits displaying a bravura loose brushwork every bit the equal of Sargent’s—though depicting the Other Half mired in New York City rather than the cosmopolitan elite.\n\nThe hazard of success then beset Bellows, who acquired a summer home in Woodstock and took to painting polo matches and tennis games and Cape Cod coasts. In short, he went soft—as many of us habitual New Yorkers fear may happen to us if we break ourselves of the habit. I will admit that the gorehound in me enjoyed Bellow’s propagandistic World War I-era works, particularly an enormous canvas called The Germans Arrive in which the Kaiser’s troops are depicted in the moment of having lopped the hands from a shirtless Belgian villager who’s gone white as a Gainsborough while his wrists produce great gouts of blood, and as you look at the one hand lying on the ground all you can think is where is the other hand?\n\nBut something ineffable begins to enter Bellows’ style in beguiling late works like 1922’s The White Horse and 1924’s The Picnic, as though Bellows has begun to see things behind things, and this the “something” to which I believe Sherwood Anderson refers. Removed from the urban din of his early works, an almost visionary hyper lucidity settles into Bellows’ art. And then… this monument of vitality died of a ruptured appendix in 1925, at age 42. He is buried in Brooklyn, as I dearly hope not to be. The show is up until February 18th, and I recommend you wait until the most horrible sludgy day in winter to see it, preferably with damp socks.\n\n*Since posting, reader and nonpareil critic Melissa E. Anderson has cited the exception of the Ivan Albright Portrait of Dorian Gray from the 1945 Albert Lewin film of the same title, to which I can only respond: Well played.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications.

Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\n“Twitter, blogs, enriched media… They’re all fads.”\n\nBoris McGiver as Tom Hammerschmidt, editor-in-chief of the Washington Herald, House of Cards\n\nSome time ago I wrote in this column that “’What happens next?’ is the lowest form of artistic engagement,” and that, furthermore, “talk all you want about the spectacular architecture of the ever-broadening story arc, in my eyes you HBO/AMC/Showtime junkies are all just overgrown kids waiting for the next Rocketeer serial… And that’s what I’ll continue to think until I actually know any better.”\n\nI have since slightly revised my opinion—of serials, that is. The Saturday before last, I attended a few hours of Light Industry’s ‘The American Serial 1914-1944’ program at their Greenpoint space, catching the last quarter of a 12-hour run. The best of what I saw was Republic’s Daredevils of the Red Circle of 1939, rollicking knockabout stuff co-directed by John English and William Witney, concerning three circus performers running down the arch-criminal who made them a trio rather than quartet. The estimable R. Emmet Sweeney, one of few film critics man enough to convincingly wear a beard and, as a Buffalonian, of far heartier stock than I, evidently went the distance, and lived to tell about it.\n\nLight Industry’s Ed Halter was riding the projector the entire time that I was present, jumping from serial to serial every twenty minutes, only allowing cliffhangers to resolve if the episode they’d got their hands on happened to be the last. For one example, we never discovered how and if Reed Hadley’s Zorro got out of that room with the walls closing in, and it really looked bad. With serial segments detached from their narrative framework, one was able to appreciate them as incident-packed entertainment objects unto themselves. And this helped, for though I am a child of television—the natural inheritor of the serial’s tune-in-next-week hook—I prefer good old standalone films.\n\nOf course, it has never been so simple—in classical star careers, which were really acts of sustained character development, audiences experienced each new film by Chaplin or Bogart as a sort-of sequel to that which came before it. Still, there is something about the stated finality of The End which, to my thinking, lends a work a sealed-shut, self-sustaining integrity—like that of politician who doesn’t have to worry about running for re-election. In a much-circulated Vulture interview, Steven Soderbergh, who is running the closing credits on his filmmaking career, appears to agree with this point as regards politics, endorsing “the minority opinion that presidents should be given more power for less time.” But Soderbergh also enthuses over small-screen works like Breaking Bad, Girls, and House of Cards—works that, like any ongoing TV narrative, are continually petitioning their viewership for one more season, if not four more years. (Maybe the better metaphor is pharmaceutical addictions, something Mr. Soderbergh’s Side Effects addresses.)\n\nAn unapologetic enthusiast of Beltway intrigue, scheming women in body-con dresses, and Kevin Spacey’s tart line-readings, leaping eyebrows, and fey, hambone shtick, I have, like Soderbergh, crumbled to House of Cards, which is ever-so-quotable (“We’ll cleave you from the herd, and watch you die in the wilderness”). In the first episode, producer-director David Fincher—seeming to court the Otto Preminger comparisons with this, his very own Advise & Consent—establishes the show’s elegant display-case visual scheme, a template that not even the hysteria-prone Joel Schumacher, handling later episodes, is given license to break out of. Working against this neutral background, a blandly astringent Spacey again proves he is perhaps America’s best bad actor, turning to address the camera, Parker Lewis Can’t Lose-style, as a supermodel might flip her hair, limply parping a hand sanitizer dispenser in the congressional cafeteria, and sarcastic slow-clapping, as with clammy otter paws.\n\nI have not read any reviews of House of Cards, though I have, during the week in which I’ve been glutting myself on the show’s 13-episode run, read a number of pieces on the market-testing, algorithmic method whereby House of Cards was conceived and greenlit by Netflix. The first was by Andrew Leonard in Salon.com, dated February 1st; the second, posted two days later, was by Scott Macauley in Filmmaker magazine; the third, from the day after that, was by Matt Singer at Indiewire. Both of the latter show good form in citing the precedent of Leonard’s piece, then proceed to reiterate Leonard’s definition of a Netflix “event,” with an anecdotal note about compromises to their marathon viewing. Leonard took a break from watching because he “was checking on [his] sick son, home from school with the flu”; Macauley because he had to sleep; while Singer “paused midway through episode 3 to walk [his] dog.”\n\nIn discussing the way our culture is being ever-more-precisely engineered for us by technology, Mssrs. Leonard, Macauley, and Singer, while all doing fine work, have effectively illustrated another contemporary phenomenon, the way in which the discussion of of-the-moment topics tends to become codified while being passed from one site to the next, usually without any appreciable addition of content—roughly the phenomenon Brian Morrissey discusses in a piece for Digiday called “The Media Aggregation Economy.”\n\nI was born the year that Apple, Inc. went public, but I am in many respects a pathetically retrograde figure, with a telling fondness for the title of an early Evelyn Waugh story: “Antony, Who Sought Things That Were Lost.” Towards that end, I spent some hours this week in the Cooper Square archives of The Village Voice, ensconced in research, digging through the years 1975 and 1979. Prior to arriving at The Voice’s offices, I flirted with self-parody by treating myself to a liverwurst-and-onion sandwich at the 150-year-old McSorley’s Old Ale House, while reading a book called Victorian America which, I swear to God, was purchased at the gift shop of the Woodrow Wilson home in Staunton, Virginia. It is safe to say that no, I do not live entirely in the present.\n\nDuring my association with The Voice, I have visited the archives sporadically, and one of the great ancillary pleasures of doing so is being able to breathe the air of a since-departed New York moviegoing culture. For the words of Sarris and Haskell and Tom Allen and J. Hoberman share pages with ads for smut like Much To [sic] Much To Handle “starring Johnny Keyes of Green Door fame” at the 43rd St. Avon Hudson or the bill-of-fare at the Ramrod “Male Theater”; a double-feature of Rollerball and Slither at St. Mark’s Cinema or fanfare for Mitchum’s Farewell My Lovely opening in a dozen Brooklyn theaters.\n\nPerhaps even more alien from a contemporary perspective, the films that are advertised one week will frequently not be written up until the week following, at the critic’s discretion; and once officially reviewed, a film stays reviewed. The review is a standalone, not a foundation on which to build in a Comments section, the critic’s blog, or a Twitter feed.\n\n“Is that a workable model in the internet age?” Kate Mara’s young Washington Herald reporter is asked in House of Cards, during a media appearance. A fine question. After I’d done my photocopying, I tossed off a baker’s dozen drinks with film critic, rock guy, and all-around coherent thinker Bruce Bennett—who happens to share a name with the actor who plays the strongman in Daredevils of the Red Circle. Bruce thinks most of the smart screenwriting today has migrated to TV, and that Nick Ray’s magnificent Hot Blood is a bad mid-60s Elvis movie, but in almost every other respect, nary a cloud has passed between us in matters of taste. In a conversation that covered such pressing topics as Benedict Bogeaus and the contemptuous soloing of Robert Quine, not to speak of routine professional bitchery, I outlined a pet theory that I’d been drafting and re-drafting throughout the week—that film journalism is today in a place analogous to that which music journalism was in 2004 or 2005, when the influence of Pitchforkmedia.com crested.\n\nAbove and beyond any band that they broke (The Wrens?), Pitchfork’s lasting tastemaking legacy will be their vital role in legitimizing a 24-hours music news cycle—much as one can see everywhere evidence of a 24-hour film news cycle emerging. There have always, of course, been industry dailies, but the ruminative, belle-lettrist process of criticism traditionally held itself aloof from the news-generating-and-disseminating process, which in effect was and is an arm of marketing and promotion. This constantly-updating model is, however, enormously appealing to advertisers, as it assures a readership that will return daily to keep up with the ongoing march of ever-refreshing content. While entertainment coverage has long existed even within the bastions of serious criticism—there was an element of it in Arthur Bell’s dishy “Bell Tells” column in The Voice—I suspect the shots will increasingly be called, and the checks will increasingly be cut, according to the needs of our artificially-accelerated news cycle. Once the organs have been put in place to provide ever-renewable content, all that remains is to produce a continual flow of news which there now exists a framework to publish, regardless of if there is any news fit to print—or, rather, post. Things must forever be happening, new talent must forever be “emerging,” and publications with significant web presence must, at festivals, indulge in the equivalent of the Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889, staking claim to the most promising properties first, exhibiting their power through playing kingmaker. All of this goes on quite indifferent to the simple fact that, on any given day, a great film is usually not being made, a great album is usually not being released, and nothing much is happening.\n\nOften, I recall what the mighty J. Hoberman told me about writing for The Voice: “I know what it is to be capable and beautiful and ambitious.” Pardon me, I believe that is House of Cards again; what Jim actually said is that “the tradition, going back to Jonas Mekas, is that the critic sets the agenda.” I leave it to a neutral party to say if this tradition remains at that publication or, indeed, anywhere. As Mr. Morrissey notes, “the pageview-driven digital ad system has taken publishers hostage.” The tyranny of the Facebook ‘Like’ and Pinging will only increase as publishers let their editorial decisionmaking be guided by these necessarily inaccurate recommending tools. Though taken as visible evidence of any given piece’s impact, these tools in fact can only chart the response of a certain (yes, much-desired) demographic given to documenting its approval or disapproval of any and every stimuli it experiences.\n\nHere, for example, is a piece at Huffington Post, about a dog with a humanoid face that is going up for adoption, the accompanying text of which begins “It’s just one of those things that are like, ‘Whoa, dude.’”* At the time of this writing (5:54 PM EST, 2/7/13), it has garnered 17,039 Facebook Likes, 6,246 Shares, 491 Tweets, 111 Google + mentions, has been forwarded in 1,833 e-mails, and attracted 976 Comments. This means that, quantifiably, it is more successful, and therefore better, than anything that I have ever written, or am likely to write, so long as my idea of what’s newsworthy remains Benedict Bogeaus Productions and “the balding guy in the Voidoids” and Emile Meyer (4 Likes, 3 Comments, one my own). And so, like the rest of the depressed, self-medicated, and impoverished American polis, I leave you so I may numb my frustration with House of Cards, with its fantasies of realpolitik potency, poshy intrigues, and handsomely-lit decanters.\n\n*- At some point, the common and very sensible advice of writing in a “voice” that resembles your own conversational tone began to be widely taken to mean that you should stud your sentences with interstitial “likes,” so as to give the reader a mental picture of the author as a laid-back, with-it, shooting-from-the-hip, business-casual dude or dame, one who’s possibly writing while sitting in a chair backwards, A.C. Slater-style. I recommend the old practice of running byline photos be resumed, so that readers can plainly see the mealy-mouthed nerds responsible for generating the content before them, who will then be forced to stop with Fonzie acts that they would not possibly be able to pull off in real life.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, NY. Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\nJoseph Aloysius Dwan was born in Toronto in 1885, when the future megalopolis’s population was only around 100,000. He died in December of 1981, aged 96, in California. In between, Dwan had taken up moviemaking, and weathered through the various convulsions of the industry from its inception onward: D.W. Griffith’s narrative innovations, the coming of sound, the challenge of television, the response of Widescreen and Technicolor. He’d also changed his name to “Allan.”\n\nNow, “Allan Dwan” is a funny name. This is probably why I frequently use it as a punchline when talking about the personal fallout of a perverse, highly-impractical addiction to old movies. As in: “Well, I have $16 in my checking account, but I have seen every extant Allan Dwan movie, so…”\n\nComing before a movie, the name “Allan Dwan” under the director’s credit connotes a no-frills simplicity—his nickname was “Practicality Dwan”—a simplicity touching on purity. Dwan learned his craft by studying (and frequently knocking off) Griffith, then proceeded to shoot with the director’s clean, elementary screen grammar for three decades longer than Griffith himself managed to. (Dwan finished his career in 1961.) When I am exhausted with movies, movies, ever more movies, all clangorously insisting on making their impression felt, I need only return to the healing springs of Allan Dwan, and a measure of innocence is regained.\n\nThere are reasons for these associations which are external to Dwan’s style. I moved to New York City in February of 2003, in the middle of a 20-film Dwan retrospective at Lincoln Center, to which I travelled every day upon rising from the friend’s floor in Bay Ridge where I was sleeping. Despite my penury and lack of gainful employment, I have very fond memories of this wide-eyed period. I think it must have been around the same time that I picked up the first issue of a ‘zine called Reverse Shot—tactile photocopied and stapled paper, children!—a pile of which was sitting on a windowsill in the lobby, free for the taking. And, as I was just that unemployed and at loose ends, I contacted its editors, and started writing what I believed at the time to be film criticism, a vice in which I have persisted. Allan fucking Dwan!\n\nI loved Dwan’s silent Westerns, his unprecedentedly ambitious adventure epics with Douglas Fairbanks, his madcap comedies of the ‘40s, and particularly his 1927 slum drama East Side, West Side with George O’Brien, even though its Walter Reade presentation was marred by the horribly pretentious accompaniment of an experimental French six-piece. But what really penetrated me then, and has every time I’ve been able to see them since, were the films that Dwan made in the 1950s with independent producer Benedict Bogeaus. I’d seen the tracking shot from 1954’s Silver Lode in Martin Scorsese’s Personal Journey, but nothing had prepared me for Passion, for Cattle Queen of Montana, Tennessee’s Partner, Slightly Scarlet, and especially for The River’s Edge.\n\nDwan’s The River’s Edge plays Anthology Film Archives next Saturday, February 23rd at 5:00. (You should just be able to see it and get across town for a screening of The Night of the Following Day at 92YTribeca, which I co-programmed with my fellow Reverse Shot alumnus Nic Rapold.) Not to be confused with the movie where Crispin Glover says “You’d think I’d at least merit a sixer” or the one where Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly kidnap a whitewater rafting Meryl Streep, Dwan’s The River’s Edge stars Anthony Quinn, Ray Milland, and Debra Paget. It was Dwan’s eighth of ten collaborations with Bogeaus, ending with 1961’s The Most Dangerous Man Alive, both men’s final movie.\n\nBenedict Earl Bogeaus was a Chicago native of French-Russian extraction, born 1904. He’d made his pile in real estate, as well as manufacturing radios and zippers, and made a good marriage in 1939 to Mimi Forsythe, a 17-year-old industrial heiress-and-aspirant actress. Those aspirations may have had something to do with the Bogeaus’ relocation to California, and subsequent entrée into the movie biz. (Forsythe had a bit part in Bogeaus’ first credited producing venture, 1944’s The Bridge of San Luis Rey. They divorced not long afterwards, and she died in 1952.)\n\nAfter initially leasing space on Hollywood’s General Service Studio lot, Bogeaus successfully bid for Studio ownership in 1942, beating out independent Edward Small, then in the middle of a long and fruitful association with none other than Allan Dwan. (Their films together include Up in Mabel’s Room, Getting Gertie’s Garter, and Brewster’s Millions.) After this, Bogeaus began making films in earnest, gaining a reputation for catching aging A-list talent just at the beginning of their downhill roll. Before initiating his streak of films with Dwan with Silver Lode, Bogeaus’ track record as a producer included André de Toth’s 1944 Dark Waters (playing on February 22nd as part of the same series at Anthology, “Andrew Sarris: Expressive Esoterica” ) and Renoir’s 1946 Diary of a Chambermaid.\n\n“There is something refreshingly frank in Dwan’s treatment of this material,” Sarris wrote in the New York Film Bulletin of May 15, 1962, “I can’t decide whether it’s a question of vitality or vulgarity, but either way, this is not the kind of lazy or jaded film-making one usually expects in the lower depths. The trouble is it’s hard to find anyone comparable to Dwan working on the naïve pulp level, and so I have to reserve judgment… To fully appreciate Dwan here, one must be able to perceive what a hundred other directors on Poverty Row would have done with this silly material.”\n\nSarris was writing about Dwan’s Woman They Almost Lynched, made in 1953, just before his teaming up with Bogeaus—a union which, it is generally agreed, gave Dwan’s work a fresh infusion of life. Another Dwan booster around the time of Sarris’s writing was Peter Bogdanovich, who recorded a series of interviews with the retired director in Van Nuys, California, in 1968 and ’69. Dwan’s stories of outlaw filmmaking in the medium’s frontier days would become the raw material of Bogdanovich’s 1971 book Allan Dwan: The Last Pioneer, as well as his 1976 film Nickelodeon.\n\nToday, the Dwan interviews are most readily available in Bogdanovich’s collection Who the Devil Made It?, highly recommended reading for its insight into the director’s personal history and working methods, which informed each other. In addition to dabbling in theater and writing stories for the newspaper at alma mater Notre Dame, Dwan played center on the football team, and noted that a director’s “job is to keep everything going together, sort of as a coach does with a lot of fine athletes.” He also studied engineering, and a nuts-and-bolts approach is discernible in his comments about camera composition: “For me, it’s mathematics. There is nothing more beautiful than mathematical perfection—as in architecture. And you have to look at something and know where you ought to see it from.”\n\n“Practicality Dwan,” credited with inventing the crane shot for Griffith on the set of Intolerance in 1916, would have been seventy-one when he started work on 1957’s The River’s Edge. The film is based on a story called “The Highest Mountain” by Harold Jacob Smith, who co-wrote The Defiant Ones the following year. The opening title appears emblazoned over a foreshadowing image of loose bills floating down a mountain stream, while the title track is warbled by one Bob Winn, who seems to have recorded a couple of 45s for Imperial Records of Hollywood that have not appreciated greatly in value on the collector’s market. One of the few other available clues to Winn’s existence is a February 2nd, 1957 Billboard review of his single “Don’t Let Me Down” (“A rather pale waxing of neo-rhythm and blues material… Not much here”).\n\nThe movie starts, as so many great movies of the period do, with a gigantic car. The car is a pale pink Ford Thunderbird, and the driver is Ray Milland, then well into middle-age. He is carrying the unfortunate character name “Nardo” and, we’ll discover, a briefcase containing a million in hundred dollar bills. Nardo pulls up to a gas station manned by Harry Carey, Jr., late as of last December, and asks directions to the ranch of Ben Cameron, on the pretense of commissioning Cameron as a hunting guide. We arrive at the ranch ahead of Nardo, and find it a run-down kind of place. Cameron (Anthony Quinn), a rough cowpuncher, goes with it; not so his wife, Margaret (Debra Paget), introduced wearing short-shorts, marabou heel slippers the color of Milland’s Thunderbird, and vividly red salon coiffure, recalling that of Arlene Dahl’s femme fatale in Dwan’s 1956 Slightly Scarlet. Shot by the immortal John Alton, Slightly Scarlet is the rare CinemaScope, three-strip Technicolor noir—and The River’s Edge has a noir heart as well, for all its outdoor-adventure elements and DeLuxe Color vistas. (Though Dwan, who had experimented with shooting in color as early as 1925’s Stage Struck, always claimed to prefer black-and-white, he made do with the hand he was dealt, as ever.)\n\nBen and Meg look like an odd couple, and with good reason; during a spat, it comes out that they were only married on the pretext of his getting her out of a scrape with the law, after she’d been abandoned by her lover and partner in a Bunco con. And who should that ex-partner be but Nardo, who drops in on Meg just as she and Ben are finishing their bust-up, and winds up taking her into town in his Thunderbird. Nardo and Meg reignite their old affair to the strains of “You’ll Never Know” on the jukebox in the bar of a southwestern-style lodge—the set is by Van Nest Polglase, art director on Citizen Kane, who worked on all of the Bogeaus-Dwan films, apparently affordable on a Bogeaus budget because of his alcoholism.\n\nBragging of the big score he’s carrying in his trunk and the easy street ahead, Nardo’s on the brink of lighting out for the border with luxury-starved Meg when they’re stopped by a highway patrolman, who Nardo promptly backs the car over. Exigency forcing his hand, Nardo then has to convince the cuckolded Ben to take him and now-accessory-to-the-crime Meg over the border and into Mexico, counting on the fact that the poor sap still loves her—a fact that the plot’s rather hard-to-swallow stalemate, in which both men squander ample opportunities to off one another, also counts on.\n\nFrom here we follow Ben, Meg, and Nardo through treacherous, rocky up-and-down country, toward the border. The location shooting was done in Amecacameca and Itzaccihuati, Mexico, but more than scenery, Dwan is attentive to expressively composing these three figures in relationship to one another, shifting compositions that illustrate Meg’s loyalty drifting towards Ben, as the true natures of both men are revealed in the crucible of adversity. Was it David Thomson who called seeing someone changing her mind the ultimate cinematic effect?\n\nMeg has a decisive, identifiable moment of conversion. When the Camerons are first introduced, Ben is in the process of branding a calf, and she squeamishly asks him “Isn’t there some other way you can do that without burning them?” Ben’s connection to the land makes him vulgar in her eyes, everything the urbane Nardo isn’t—just as Meg’s citified pretensions make her ridiculous to brusque, unromatic Ben. But Meg awakens to Nardo’s total lack of conscience eventually and, attempting to escape him, tears her arm on some barbed wire. As the trio hole up in a cave during a downpour, Ben discovers that wound has turned gangrenous, and has to hack the putrefied flesh away. After a quick genuflection, Ben gets to work with his knife, heated in the fire to cauterize the wound; the operation is performed just out-of-frame, the flesh sizzling off-screen recalling the burning brand on the calf’s flank. The strange consummation of this “branding” has the effect of a renewal of vows between the Camerons—and from here on, Quinn, so often the obstreperous he-man, shows himself exceedingly attentive, affectionate and doting, smothering Paget with reassuring kisses. And while I don’t want to claim The River’s Edge, which takes its share of narrative liberties, is exactly on a par with Rossellini’s Journey to Italy as a story of awakening to a taken-for-granted love, it’s tremendously moving all the same.\n\nSpeaking to Bogdanovich, Dwan, ever the engineer, explained the math—specifically, the geometry—that went into plotting his early silents, and his comments might be applied to late works like Slightly Scarlet and The River’s Edge: “Everything I did was triangles with me. If I constructed a story and had four characters in it, I’d put them down as dots and if they didn’t hook up into triangles, if any of them were left dangling out there without a sufficient relationship to any of the rest, I knew I’d have to discard them because they’d be a distraction. And you’re only related to people through triangles or lines.”\n\nMore to the point, Dwan told Bogdanovich that, “Economy of line is the essence of art. Extreme simplicity.” And it is for economy of line that I return to the cleansing waters of The River’s Edge, and allow myself to be burnt with the brand of Allan Dwan, time and time again.\n\nAnd now, on a wholly unrelated note, a fond farewell to Tim Dog, gallant defender of the Eastern seaboard’s honor, whose video for “Fuck Compton” is one of the greatest entries in the “guys-in-hoodies-hanging-out-around-a-flaming-barrel” school.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications.

A middling second-string critic parted ways in a snit with The Village Voice, which really hasn’t been readable since Mailer left, prompting a languorous yawn of indifference. And of course this Sunday is, in a mystifying turn of phrase, “Oscar’s biggest night!” I discussed this atrocity exhibition in a column exactly one year ago, and my feelings on the subject have not altered a jot or a tittle since. Oh, and probably the most significant piece of journalism of our time appeared in New York Magazine, where someone called Katie Van Syckle wrote of her doomed love affair with Beasts of the Southern Wild producer Dan Janvey, a work full of Poignant Writing like, “And suddenly, the gaping hole in the drywall felt like a long time ago,” which begs to be read aloud with friends in sighing, wistful tones, interrupted by periodic fits of gasping hysteria.\n\nAs I mentioned last week, this Saturday is occasion for one of my critically-acclaimed, sparsely-attended ventures into programming with still-official film critic Nic Rapold. The place is 92YTribeca, near the gaping maw of the Holland Tunnel, possibly the least-alluring piece of turf in Manhattan. (Even that strip of Broadway above Madison Square Park is breaking out with boutique hotels.) The film is The Night of the Following Day; the director, continuing the funny-names theme (“Allan Dwan”) of last week, is Hubert Cornfield.\n\n“Who is Hubert Cornfield?” asked an article in the November, 1960 issue of Positif, credited to P-L Thirard and none other than Bertrand Tavernier. This marked Cornfield as a dark horse coming on strong—in the 1962 Pantheon of Movie magazine he was filed under “Competent or Ambitious.” Today, however, probably less people can answer the question “Who is Hubert Cornfield?” than could then.\n\nWhere to begin? Leon Cornfeld, Hubert’s grandfather, was a Romanian-born actor, film producer, and impresario, who kept offices in Vienna and Istanbul—which is where Hubert was born in 1929, to Leon’s son, Albert. I can’t say when the Cornfelds became Cornfields, but it’s known that Albert moved the family between the US and France, where he eventually served as vice-president of 20th Century Fox in Europe. Albert Cornfield can be found in the Deseret News of December 30, 1955 “angrily [denying] French accusations that his firm was involved in a propaganda plot to blacken France’s name in North Africa by ‘staging’ the shooting of an Algerian rebel” for Fox-MovieTone news.\n\nMost of the biographical information on Hubert Cornfield that follows comes from his own testimony in the Spring 1962 Film Quarterly, its “Special Issue on Hollywood.” Cornfield came to New York after spending much of his boyhood in France, and he attended the University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia School of Art. A stint in the art department of the European offices of Fox followed, where the poster for All About Eve was among his credits. “I guess in technique, I followed Paul Rand, Saul Bass,” he said of this period, “and in the Paris office I knew Chabrol and Godard.”\n\nCornfield returned to New York, where he shot a (presumably abstract) “film on the color ‘red’” around Greenwich Village with a secondhand Bell & Howell and hung around the Actor’s Studio as a “director-observer,” before heading west to work as a reader for Allied Artists. In 1955, at age twenty-six, just missing the mark established by his wunderkind idol Orson Welles, Hubert had finished his directorial debut, Sudden Danger, first in a four-film series for Allied starring former cowboy star “Wild” Bill Elliott as Lt. Andy Doyle. In terms of historical interest, this falls somewhat short of the debut that Cornfield had apparently been planning for himself: J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye. (Salinger’s polite-but-firm note refusing sale of the book to Cornfield was auctioned by University Archives in 2010 for $22,500.)\n\nFrom here, Cornfield’s filmmaking career begins in earnest. 1957’s Lure of the Swamp has allured a few cinephiles, but the earliest of Cornfield’s films that I have seen is Plunder Road, from the same year and also for Regal Films. It’s a pip of a “B” which begins with a quintet of criminals (including Gene Raymond, Elisha Cook, Jr., Raymond Morris, and Steven Ritch, who co-wrote the screenplay) pulling off an insanely baroque robbery of a diesel train, a caper which involves a cherry picker, stunt jumping, nitro glycerin, and knockout gas—all in driving rain no less. (Cornfield called Jean-Pierre Melville a friend, and it’s hard to believe Melville didn’t think of this sequence when planning 1972’s Un flic.) This was followed by The 3rd Voice, a 1960 CinemaScope production with Laraine Day masterminding a murder plot where cohort Edmund O’Brien learns to mimic and replace the husband who jilted her, and 1962’s Pressure Point, which has an unusually wry and subtle Sidney Poitier as a prison psychiatrist assigned to a seditious homegrown fascist, a German-American Bund member circa 1942, superbly played by Bobby Darin. A Stanley Kramer production, Pressure Point’s reputation has probably suffered from the diminishing of Kramer’s stock, but there is nothing facile in its depiction of the pathology of hate and, dramatizing the case history of Darin’s character, Cornfield devises a number of ingenious effects which overlap past and present, the psychiatrist’s office with the scenes of trauma, aided by cinematographer Ernest Haller, also Cornfield’s DP on Plunder Road and The 3rd Voice.\n\nTogether Cornfield and Haller give these films’ black-and-white photography a bold, chalkboard feeling. The director’s background as a graphic artist is evident in his dynamic and impactful visual sense, established in invariably striking title sequences which show the admitted influence of Bass. Cornfield also evinces a keen interest in tricksy psychological thrillers after the model of Welles, and both of these signature elements are at work in his next film, The Night of the Following Day.\n\nAfter building some career momentum, Cornfield didn’t work in the six years after Pressure Point—in The American Cinema, which skeptically relegates the director to Miscellany, Andrew Sarris suggests that Cornfield’s “career seems to have been blighted after a disagreement with producer Stanley Kramer over Pressure Point.” (Much the same happened to John Cassavetes after Too Late Blues; apparently the liberal lion of Hollywood operated the blacklist of the Kennedy era.) That makes The Night of the Following Day Cornfield’s ’68 Comeback Special, succinctly described in an Amazon.com Editor’s Review as “A vile tale of a young girl’s kidnapping by a brutal gang of ruthless opportunists, whose bickering and betrayal threaten everyone’s lives before the heist is even over.”\n\nLike James B. Harris’ 1987 Cop, which we screened at 92Y a couple of months ago and which I wrote about here, Night is a movie that’s slightly unstuck from time. Both Harris and Cornfield’s sensibilities were formed during the Indian Summer of noir, in which both men were active—Cornfield as a director, Harris as Stanley Kubrick’s producer on 1956’s The Killing. As Joe Dante alludes to in the video above, before settling on Lionel White’s Clean Break, which was the basis of The Killing, Kubrick and Harris had first been interested in an unpublished 1955 novel by White called The Snatchers, rejected by the Production Code Administration under their “kidnapping clause,” only to be snatched up by Cornfield, still looking for his first picture after being rejected by Salinger.\n\nThe Snatchers was finally adapted as The Night of the Following Day, a film which, like Plunder Road—or, for that matter, The Killing—is about a minutely-planned heist ultimately undone by human negligence, weakness, and error. Pamela Franklin stars as the girl in Night, a heiress picked up by a phony chauffeur from Orly Airport, then held for ransom in a cold, sparsely-furnished seaside house. Her kidnappers are Richard Boone, Jess Hahn, Rita Moreno and, in the lead, Moreno’s former lover, Marlon Brando, who wears the chauffeur’s uniform and bottle-blonde coiffure. Another parallel between Harris-Kubrick and Cornfield arises here, for both clashed mightily with Brando. Kubrick was weeks from shooting a Paramount Western for the star, which had in one of its many permutations been called The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones , when he was disinvited from the production in November, 1958. The film was finally released in 1961, with an immensely ballooned budget, as One Eyed Jacks, Brando’s sole directorial credit.\n\nDespite Brando’s best efforts, The Night of the Following Day is a Hubert Cornfield film. Cornfield died in 2006 shortly after having suffered a diabetic seizure, and was in obvious ill-health as he recorded the gurgling, sporadic commentary track for the 2004 Universal DVD release of Night (this lovely L.A. Weekly obituary by F.X. Feeney notes that Cornfield had lost his voice box to cancer in the ‘70s), which is largely given over to his recounting Brando’s on-set insubordination, attempts to “embarrass” and “belittle” him as director. “He tried to seduce my wife,” Cornfield says, “and the next day he came and told me that he tried to seduce my wife, but he didn’t succeed. So I told him, ‘Well, Marlon, I’m so flattered, I will never forget that honor.’ Anyway, later in the film, I started getting a little fed up.” Cornfield also recounts Brando’s insistence on having Richard Boone direct a key scene—Brando and Jess Hahn’s kitchen confrontation, the tone of which is notably disjointed from the rest of the picture—and Brando’s performing dead drunk in a scene where he walks in on Moreno’s nodding junkie sleeping in the tub. (Cornfield has nothing but praise for the work of the West Side Story actress, who “could cry on a dime”—and who, incidentally, will have a memoir out in two weeks.)\n\nThis may all be taken with a grain of salt. Feeney makes a note of Cornfield’s own quarrelsome personality, as well as his “Casanova recklessness when it came to sleeping with the wives and mistresses of backers and allies.” (In fact, anyone who knew Cornfield personally seems to feel obliged to mention his satyr-like horniness.) In his 2008 Brando biography Somebody, Stefan Kanfer discursively states that Night was made only so Brando could “discharge his final obligation to Universal” and that, according to the star, Cornfield’s dream logic-driven script made “as much sense as a rat fucking a grapefruit.” Kanfer’s effort to cast Brando’s on-set behavior in the best possible light becomes rather suspect, however, when he states that Cornfield was “too inexperienced to assert any meaningful authority” on-set, a description which hardly corresponds to the personality which emerges in the Film Quarterly profile. In that same profile, however, Cornfield discusses being dismissed while on-location in Florida after six days of shooting 1961’s Angel Baby, to be replaced by Paul Wendkos. In fact, Cornfield scarcely ever seems to have completed a film without interference: Pressure Point’s wretched bookending scenes with Peter Falk were added by Kramer after Cornfield’s departure, with Darin’s connivance. A great admirer of Welles, Cornfield seems to have cultivated some of his idol’s combative, maverick demeanor, bringing to mind something Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. said: “I would suffer like Van Gogh, to paint like Van Gogh. I would not suffer like Van Gogh however, to paint like Gaugin.”\n\nReturning to The Night of the Following Day, there is more than a little irony in the relationship between what happened on location with and what happens in the movie. The caper film, concerned as it is with group psychology, high-pressure problem-solving, and rallying for one big production number, is a close relation of the “Let’s put on a show” backstage drama, and so a ready metaphor for the filmmaking process. In Night, Brando—whose character bears his childhood nickname “Bud”—is in effect playing the exasperated impresario or director of a kidnapping “production” who is beset on all sides by his collaborators’ incompetence, personality dysfunctions, and general lack of focus on the job at hand.\n\nAnother irony: Folly though it may be, One Eyed Jacks is a pretty extraordinary movie, as is The Night of the Following Day. Is this despite or because of Brando’s interference? Did Brando know what he was doing, acting as a destabilizing force on the set? Was he like Mark E. Smith playing prankster bandleader, wandering on the stage, maliciously monkeying with his disposable bandmates’ equipment, so to create a sharpening tension? Was there method (or Method) to this madness?\n\nI am inclined to think not. In his commentary, Cornfield reports that Brando refused to play a love scene with Franklin, which would’ve morally compromised Bud along with the rest of the crew; instead, per Cornfield, “He becomes the knight in shining armor, destroying the whole point of the picture.” This matches up quite well with the testimony of Sam Peckinpah, who’d written one of the many drafts of One Eyed Jacks: “Marlon screwed it up. He’s a hell of an actor, but in those days he had to end up as a hero, and that’s not the point of the story.” An indolent, disobedient genius, Brando had the luxury of being able to make things impossible and, with the right collaborators, still get away with it. (I thought of Brando immediately when Richard Brody posted a statement from Gerard Depardieu’s daughter, from an article in Le Monde, on Twitter: “Basically, he’s disappointed in today’s world and is trying to make it amusing.”)\n\nBrando has the right collaborators in Night. As the untrustworthy sadist who comes on with a calm, persuasive pitch, Moore makes a great heavy, towering over Franklin, while boasting a complexion like the surface of a hostile, barren planetoid. Cornfield and DP Willi Kurant sustain the film’s sodden, inclement atmosphere, all wet sand and lowering skies over an off-season seaside town, while the shots taken on the rain-slick French highway, after Brando has absconded with Franklin, might be out of Duras’ Le camion.\n\nCornfield suggests still another point of reference, appropriate to the film’s soft-edged air of unreality, which is justified by a twist ending cribbed from Dead of Night. “This picture is really a homage to the painter Magritte who came from that region on the channel in Belgium,” Cornfield says on the DVD commentary over the final shot, “The umbrella, the bowler hat, right out of a Magritte painting.”\n\nIt is worth noting that at the same time that Hubert was cinematographically invoking Magritte in the north of France, his uncle, Bernard, was in the midst of becoming “the most talked about financier in Europe since the Great Depression,” owning “more chateaux, town houses, villas, and apartments in the world’s capitals than any Rothschild or Esterhazy in their high times.” This is according to Do You Sincerely Want to Be Rich?: The Full Story of Bernard Cornfeld and IOS by Charles Raw, Bruce Page, and Godfrey Iodgson, which recounts how Bernard pulled off one of the greatest confidence scams of all time. A child of Leon Cornfeld’s second marriage, and actually two years his nephew’s junior, Bernard, prophet of “people’s capitalism,” created and managed the gargantuan Inverstors Overseas Services mutual fund, which employed an army of salesmen to go door-to-door encouraging middle-class families to invest in offshore funds, funds which then acted as a personal piggy bank for Bernard and the IOS bigs.\n\nThis would normally be a good spot to draw a facile syllogism between the criminal behavior being depicted by the nephew and that being performed by the uncle. Fortunately I have just been reading the excellent new book Abraham Polonsky: Interviews, part of University Press of Mississippi’s ongoing Conversations with Filmmakers series, in which the blacklist survivor comments on adapting Ira Wolfert’s novel Tucker’s People into the singular noir Force of Evil:\n\n“The book had a clear parallel to Fascism. I mean, that’s an ordinary metaphor you find in all economic writing and in poetry of left-wing journalism: gangsterism is like capitalism, or the other way round. I don’t know if that’s true, but anyhow it’s a metaphor when you’re desperate.”\n\nIt will have to remain a mystery how Polonsky, who died in 1999, was able to see an advanced screening of 2012’s Killing Them Softly.*\n\nWell, I’ve got to get back to my day job. Until next week, I can be found standing on Cooper Square with a boom box over my head, bumping this… (“Rejection is one thing, but rejection from a fool is cruel…”)\n\n*Force of Evil has much more in common with another George V. Higgins adaptation, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, which, along with Phil Karlson’s The Brothers Rico, forms a holy trinity of talking-for-your-life noirs.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to Sight & Sound magazine and sundry other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, NY. Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\nFor obvious reasons, Garrison Keillor has always irked me—the “Stupid TV! Be more funny!” gag on The Simpsons covers it—but never more than when he sweepingly opines on the nature of being Midwestern. I recall an interview that Keillor gave around the time that Robert Altman’s disarmingly fine Prairie Home Companion film came out, in which Keillor suggested that he and Altman were a natural team, both being Midwesterners. But Keillor’s Twin Cities and Altman’s Kansas City are some 450 miles apart, while the distance between the men’s temperaments and artistic personae is immeasurable—a tension to which the film probably owes much of its success. When the Midwest can produce both a floppy, folksy doof like Keillor and a Scotch-pickled satirist like Altman—or both a James Whitcomb Riley and a Theodore Dreiser—how can any attempt to generalize about the Midwestern character, of the sort that Keillor specializes in, take in all of the complex and contradictory types to be found between North Dakota and the Ozarks?\n\nI have been thinking a lot about the Midwest this week, because I have been looking at it through a windshield. I am from the Midwest in a liminal sort of way—you can walk across the Purple People Bridge from my hometown, Cincinnati, Ohio, and be in Kentucky and Dixieland. I have lived the last decade in New York City, where I have always felt a bit like a transplanted baboon heart, for it at least feels as if the city has constantly striven to reject me, never more so than recently, as the cost of living rises in inverse proportion to the degree to which my Very Particular Set of Skills are monetizable, and my career arc increasingly resembles that of Hurstwood’s in Sister Carrie.\n\nLast week, my final piece for Voice Media Group, on the subject of Andrew Sarris and an ongoing Anthology Film Archives retrospective based on the “Expressive Esoterica” chapter of his The American Cinema, ran. My first VMG review, on Heddy Honigmann’s Forever, went to print on September 4, 2007. All told, this amounts to a little under five-and-a-half years of regular contribution, during which time—even given the fact that I rarely set foot in the offices—it’s to be expected that I would’ve gained a fair amount of insight into goings-on at Cooper Square, and their relationship to the evil overlords in Phoenix. Some people have expressed disappointment that I didn’t dish more upon cutting ties with VMG, to which I can only say that this is out of respect for the few well-meaning people who are still there—if not for the fresh-off-the-U-haul army of 22-year-olds who are, as I write, being sent forth to “find out what’s happening in Bushwick.”\n\nI suppose Mr. Keillor might see my discretion as a form of Midwestern courtesy. More than that, it’s poor form to take credit for a decision that has largely been made for you; if the situation had not become insuperable, I’m sure I’d still be latched to the VMG teat. For all my air of high dudgeon, I don’t have the moral high ground. If you’ve already agreed to suck the devil’s cock, you don’t get to react with too much righteous indignation when he cums in your eye.* (This is an old Midwestern proverb.)\n\nI will not, unprovoked, lay a glove on the film section, though I will note this utterly toxic item attached to the music section of the VMG combine, dated February 15, by some boorish nothing of a listicle printing press called Luke O’Neil titled Advice For Aspiring Music Writers: Quit Now, which is indicative of the book’s general basement-ward plummeting of standards, and includes the author’s absolute fallacious claim that “I’d have quit the whole charade myself a long time ago, but I’m literally unqualified for any other job in the world…”\n\nIf a 30ish white guy without kids, which O’Neil seems to be, and which I am, ever makes the claim that they’re forced into a career because they don’t have any other options, please douse them in the nearest available bucket of battery acid. I do this for love; there’s certainly no money in it, and practicing film criticism is something that you get laid in spite of. And so, on parting company with VMG, I’m now doing something I’ve scarcely ever done before: Traveling the festival circuit, in my sporty, flirty 2003 Ford ZX2, in the inconspicuous Dark Shadow Gray color which is preferred by 4 out of 5 Midwesterners. (One of the more overkill lines I can remember writing for VMG, kicking off a review of a three-day mumblecordian wonder called Caitlin Plays Herself: “Joe Swanberg’s films combine a Midwestern male’s fear of anything exceptional with pasty exhibitionism.”)\n\nThe True/False festival in Columbia, Missouri, is my first stop, followed by South by Southwest, popularly abbreviated to “SXSW,” which I understand the cool kids are now calling “South by,” and which I will simply refer to forthwith as “S.” En route, I have seen the Midwest. I have gobbled hash at Bunny’s Hasty Tasty Pancake House in East Dayton where, somewhat inexplicably, the folksy décor includes a lobby card for Andre de Toth and Kirk Douglas’s The Indian Fighter. I have heard astral guitar shredding in my mind’s ear while looking upon John Martin’s Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion at the St. Louis Art Museum. I have watched the truly terrible premiere of Syfy’s “Robot Combat League” in J & A’s Bar & Grill in that same city, and the next day looked over Forest Park and the onetime fairgrounds of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the endpoint for perhaps the greatest manifestation of the Midwest in the popular imagination, Vincente Minnelli’s Meet Me in St. Louis.\n\nMinnelli knew the Midwest. As a boy, he’d traveled the vaudeville circuit out of Chicago, through the East North Central states, with the Minnelli Brothers’ Tent Theatre, the musical troupe his father conducted. It is entirely possible that, in Minnelli’s boyhood, his father might’ve have shared a stage with my own great-great-grandparents, Goldie and Carlos Inskeep, then traveling the same circuit and performing Carlos’ oeuvre, including such perennials as “The Girl and the Tramp,” “In the Sacristy,” and “When a Woman Wills.”\n\nCarlos Inskeep is a figure who haunts the marginalia of many a prewar Variety, and is also found accused of making “improper proposals” to a sixteen year-old in a 1903 Weekly News-Review of Crawfordsville, Indiana. Deep Googling informs me that his oeuvre is preserved in a number of libraries and institutions; the first person to get me some scanned PDFs will receive a Blu-ray of their choosing. But for now let us stick with the known quality of Minnelli, whose two greatest films happen to have Midwestern settings. The first is 1958’s Some Came Running, a Frank Sinatra vehicle based on a novel by James Jones, in which Jones’ fictional Parkman, Indiana is played by the actual Madison, Indiana, a town a few miles downriver from Cincinnati on the Ohio. Some Came Running is the quintessential portrait of small town cant and duplicity: As the Sinatra character’s older brother, Arthur Kennedy plays a pristine pillar of the community who’s made of whitewashed rotten wood, while Dean Martin gives perhaps his best performance as Bama, a free-and-easy loafer who runs a back room poker game—very much the sort of man Martin might have come to be had he stayed in his own Ohio River town, Steubenville.\n\nSteubenville, most recently newsworthy for covering up an alleged rape by members of their high school football team, was once the across-the-river “sin city” where Pittsburghers went to slake their thirst for vice, when Martin was just a little boy named Dino Crocetti. In this, the relationship between Pittsburgh and Steubenville may be said to resemble the relationship of Newport, Kentucky to Cincinnati, or Phenix City, Alabama to Atlanta and Birmingham. (If you have not seen Phil Karlson’s 1955 The Phenix City Story, please stop reading now and correct this.) And Some Came Running addresses precisely the sort of all-American hypocrisy that necessitates Jekyll and Hyde “sin cities”—or communitywide collusion in a rape.\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis, however, believes wholeheartedly in the upstanding front of the Midwestern middle-class. It is based on a series of stories Sally Benson wrote for The New Yorker about the St. Louis of her girlhood. This is roughly the same turn-of-the-last century period of Midwestern affluence depicted in, say, Douglas Sirk’s All I Desire or W.C. Fields’ The Old Fashioned Way, the latter which takes place on the seediest level of the Minnellis and Inskeeps’ itinerant theatrical milieu. Those two films emphasize the repressiveness of the era’s genteel respectability, still lingering from the Mauve Decade, but Meet Me in St. Louis is a paean to that lost world. Shortly after Alonzo, the patriarch of the Smith family played by Leon Ames, has suggested uprooting his family from St. Louis to New York to pursue a career opportunity, the women of the family stage a revolt. “Rich people have houses,” says his wife of the big city, “People like us live in flats, hundreds of flats in one building.” “You can’t do anything there like you do in St. Louis,” youngest sister Tootie later concludes, after slaughtering her own family of snowmen in the yard rather than leave them behind. (Alonzo caves to the Smith women in the movie, though it seems Benson’s family actually came to New York.)\n\nYou cannot begrudge the Smiths clinging to the bosom of their hearth and home, for, without soft-pedaling the fears and sorrows of childhood, Meet Me in St. Louis altogether makes one believe that middle-class life really was once so generous and gentle and gracious and good. (It was released in November of 1944, in time to act as counterprogramming to the news from the Battle of the Bulge.) Incidentally, when I return to Cincinnati from my New York flat, I stay in my step-mother’s century house, whose floorplan is laid out exactly like that of the Smith family’s in Meet Me in St. Louis—and I think of Judy Garland’s Esther and John Truitt turning out the gaslights together every time I ascend the main stairwell.\n\nThis brings me to another movie which abounds in great stairwell scenes, the only movie that vies with Meet Me in St. Louis as the great Midwestern movie. I am referring to The Magnificent Ambersons, adapted from the novel by the Hoosier Booth Tarkington, and directed by the pride of Kenosha, Wisconsin, Orson Welles. One night, stopping over while moving west towards Missouri, I headed into a bar in which someone turned on Touch of Evil on the TV, and let it play out, without volume. As Touch of Evil proceeded, the thinning patronage latched onto it like it was a double-overtime Final Four game, and I caught at least one “What is this?” request which warranted clicking on the cable guide. I think it’s safe to say that the ability of Mr. Welles’ work to magnetize a crowd’s attention has traveled the decades untrammeled. I first saw and adored Touch of Evil in its 1998 theatrical re-release, when I would have been seventeen and entirely Midwestern. The combination of the film’s images, which are tattooed onto my memory, and the Stiff Little Fingers on the jukebox (another teenaged enthusiasm) was, to use one of my favorite Kael expressions “voluptuously masochistic.” And, as ever, when watching Marlene Dietrich silently mouth the film’s last line, I wondered what La Kael could have been thinking when she wrote “That may be one of the worst lines ever written or a parody of bad writing.” (Was THAT a parody of bad criticism?)\n\nI have gotten away from The Magnificent Ambersons, which owes its magnificence, its preeminence as the Midwestern masterpiece, to its ability to encompass both the nostalgia of Meet Me in St. Louis (the sighing “they had time for everything in those days” of the opening) and a full knowledge of the repressive respectability that appears in a Some Came Running or All I Desire (“Poor old Aunt Fanny…”) If I may be permitted to unleash my personal Garrison Keillor, it seems that nostalgia, an ever-present awareness of a vanished greatness, is somehow key to the Midwestern character. Certainly one of the great Midwestern movie moments comes in Alexander Payne’s About Schmidt, when Jack Nicolson’s Schmidt visits a pioneer museum, where he stands in awe of the resolve of his forebears, those hearty Willa Cather Midwesterners. The museum is the Great Platte River Road Archway Monument in Kearney, Nebraska, which I thought of immediately when looking in on the Museum of Western Expansion in the visitor’s center of the St. Louis arch, before ascending to take in what could scarcely be called a view on such a snowblind day.\n\nIncidentally, both Meet Me in St. Louis and Ambersons appear in 1992’s The Long Day Closes, playing Liverpool movie houses of the mid-‘50s where they are great favorites of Bud, the alter-ego of Terence Davies, an artist who understands as well as anyone the simultaneous attraction and revulsion of nostalgia, the process through which the child’s longing to get out becomes the adult’s longing to get back. I am sure Welles was overjoyed to part with the country that he would revisit in Ambersons; I remember reading a reader’s letter to Time magazine after a cover story in the mid-90s on medicating children, in which the writer recalled a sullen, disliked, possibly ADD classmate, before ending with the kicker “That boy’s name was Orson Welles.” The comic novelist Dawn Powell, an almost exact contemporary of Sally Benson’s, was raised in central Ohio in the days when the state was a prosperous factory for presidents. She decamped to Greenwich Village in her twenties, as soon as she was able, and then, when she was in her mid-forties, wrote a thinly-veiled memoir called My Home is Far Away. That title is never far from my mind, for I do not suppose that I will resolve the push-pull of longing and loathing that my far away home inspires until I am safely potted in the family plot in Darlington, Indiana.\n\n*- I should qualify that I am not suggesting that if you fellate someone, they are thereby justified in ejaculating in your eye without permission. This is the devil, though; you should’ve known better.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to Sight & Sound magazine and sundry other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, NY. Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\n“Yesterday, that might have meant something… Now it means nothing, nothing at all.”\n\nThat’s Gloria Grahame at the end of 1950’s In a Lonely Place. Grahame plays a young woman named Laurel Gray, who fell in love with an alcoholic screenwriter named Dixon “Dix” Steele (Humphrey Bogart) when they were both swept up into the investigation of a coat check girl’s murder. As the police land on Dix as the prime suspect in the case, however, his relationship with Laurel is put under tremendous strain—for Dix is a verifiably suspicious character, with a hair-trigger temper and a rap sheet full of assaults. When Laurel speaks the above lines, the police have just phoned to exonerate Dix, but he’s not around to take the call. In one of his periodic violent trances, rankled by Laurel’s suspicion, he’d just attempted to strangle her, only to get hold of himself at the last moment and pull back, retreating from her bedroom and, as the film closes, shuffling disconsolately across the courtyard of their apartment complex, never to return to her arms.\n\n“Ah, how too, too true,” I thought, with the perfect wisdom that is the gift of all twenty-year-olds, when I encountered that “…Now it means nothing” in a college class on Nicholas Ray. My CD collection at the time betrayed a penchant for what I once heard pejoratively called “sad white boy music,” and if I knew anything about love, it’s that it was by definition fleeting and tragic, fated to die. My professor’s preferred reading, however, was that Dix and Laurel were both closeted homosexuals. His explanation had something to do with Dix’s hobby of punching out pretty young men because he couldn’t bring himself to kiss them, and particularly with the scene where a bulky lady masseuse kneads away at Laurel. Certainly Raymond Nicholas Kienzle’s filmography is rife with moments of confusion about sex and sexual identity, like James Dean almost ducking into the Girls’ room on his first day at a new school in Rebel Without a Cause, or James Mason rolling over to offer up his ass when the doctor demands to give him a shot in the “sternum” in Bigger than Life (“Sorry,” he says by way of explanation, “I spent four years in the Navy.”) This is to say nothing of the fact that Ray was by most accounts an up-for-anything polymorphous pervert, who found his wife at the time of the In a Lonely Place shoot—none other than Ms. Grahame—in bed with his 13-year-old son from a prior marriage. But I could not surrender a movie that I felt so deeply to a reading I did not, and instead thought In a Lonely Place indicative of the universal human condition: Things fall apart! Love withers! Entropy reigns!\n\nAs far back as I can remember, I have been drawn toward movies that flatter and reconfirm an ingrained bias in favor of romantic failure, rather than Happily Ever After. Affecting romantic fatalism is, of course, a neat escape-hatch excuse for fecklessness, as many a lad learns in his oat-sewing days. Or is the appeal something deeper, something to do with being a child of divorce? A psychiatrist would have a field day—is there any other profession in which proverbial “field days” are so common? Frederic March certainly has one in the double-role of Rouben Mamoulian’s 1931 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and every time I view it afresh, I’m leveled at the scene of March at his most wrenching, begging his fiancée, played by Rose Hobart, to forget him. (There are, of course, innumerable readings of Robert Lewis Stevenson’s story as a metaphor for the double-life of the Victorian homosexual.

Pialat always sticks his endings—see Loulou’s penultimate scene with Nelly, sitting alone in her thoughts and pregnant with Loulou’s child at the rude dinner table of his vulgar family, just before making the decision to abort;"
