        "text": "Calvary Episcopal Churchyard Cemetery, Tamaqua (No Longer Exists)\n\n300 West Broad Street\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nLike most early churches, the Episcopal church in Tamaqua used the yard to the rear of the church structure as their cemetery. The ground in question is now a private residence, but the burials that were made there can be found in the microfilmed church records held by the Mormons. Refer to FHL US Film #1671278, Items 5-6 which are available through any Family History Center (www.familysearch.org). As noted below under “Odd Fellows Cemetery”, many of the burials made in the Episcopal Churchyard Cemetery were re-interred in Odd Fellows Cemetery.\n\nAmerican Primitive Methodist Cemetery (No Longer Exists)\n\n57 Hunter Street\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThe American Primitive Methodist Church of Tamaqua is the older existing church of that denomination in America (the title of the oldest goes to the PM church that formerly existed in the Seek section of Coaldale). During the 19th century, the church yard was a cemetery that ceased to exist sometime in the 1870’s. The church apparently has no record of the burials that were made there, but the remains were collectively re-interred in the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Tamaqua in a lot that the church owned. The largest headstone in the PM Cemetery was selected to stand for all those interred at the mass grave in Odd Fellows, but the individuals whose names were known with certainty were inscribed on the base of the stone once it was erected.\n\nMethodist Episcopal Cemetery (No Longer Exists)\n\nMahanoy Street and Bowe Street\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThis cemetery was high on the hill behind the existing First United Methodist Church on West Broad Street. It is identified on the 1875 Atlas of Schuylkill County but is long since gone, and the entire block that the cemetery once occupied is now private homes. The cemetery was bound by Mahanoy, Bowe, High, and Van Gelder Streets.\n\nThere are no known records of the burials that took place there, but most of the burials were likely re-interred at Odd Fellows, Tamaqua.\n\nOdd Fellows Cemetery, Tamaqua\n\n503 West Broad Street\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThe Odd Fellows Cemetery is one of the two largest cemeteries in the Tamaqua area as well as one of the oldest. It serves to provide for one of the tenants of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge, “…to bury the dead.” As the symbol for Odd Fellowship is three conjoined links of a chain, the layout of the older section of the cemetery vaguely resembles three intersecting circles.\n\nThe cemetery opened on January 4, 1864 and has grown since to thirty two acres.\n\nThe Odd Fellows are a protestant organization, so most of the historical burials in the cemetery are protestant in faith (although that tends to be less true with recent burials). Soldiers from every American conflict are buried here along with several area historical figures as mentioned below. As other cemeteries in the Tamaqua area closed, the Odd Fellows was more often than not the location for the re-interment of the remains from the closed cemeteries.\n\nAn index for the cemetery exists. It was completed by Charles Bailey in 1998 and donated to several repositories including the Tamaqua Public Library and the Pottsville Public Library.\n\nMaps exist for both the old and new sections of the cemetery and they are in the care of the cemetery caretaker.\n\nThere is no known website for the cemetery.\n\nNoteworthy Burials:\n\nChristian Becker. Also known as Christ Becker, he was born in Germany, April 7, 1851 and was a member of Pennsylvania state house of representatives, 1913-16. He died in 1917.\n\n• William Heath. Heath has received nationwide attention recently as being the sole, or at least one of the few, survivors of the Battle of Little Bighorn (Vincent J. Genovese. Billy Heath: The Man Who Survived Custer’s Last Stand. Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2003)\n\n• Benjamin Yost. Yost was a Tamaqua policeman who was allegedly assassinated in Tamaqua by members of the Molly Maguires.\n\nInformation Last Updated: February 24, 2009\n\nSt. Jerome’s Catholic Cemetery (new), Tamaqua\n\nCatawissa and Jerome Streets\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nSt. Jerome’s is the third oldest church in Tamaqua (founded in 1833) but remains a vibrant organization to this day. Their new cemetery looks to have been in use by 1900 and is quite large. Maps showing lot owners exist and are in the care of the church. There is no known index. Historically, the church had and Irish affiliation and hence the cemetery was known to have burials from other area Irish churches, namely St. Mary’s of Coaldale and St. Ann’s of Lansford.\n\nSt. Jerome’s Catholic Cemetery (old), Tamaqua\n\nHigh and Nescopec Streets\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nSt. Jerome’s old cemetery is located a few blocks high on the hill behind the church building on West Broad Street. Most of the headstones are still legible, but no index exists. One noteworthy resident of the cemetery is the alleged ring-master of the Molly Maguires, Black Jack Kehoe. Historically, the church and hence cemetery had an Irish affiliation and also served other area Irish Catholic churches that have no cemetery, namely St. Mary’s of Coaldale and St. Ann’s of Lansford.\n\nWelsh Church Cemetery (No Longer Exists)\n\nLatitude: 40°47’54.00″ N\n\nLongitude: 75°58’25.00″ W\n\nLafayette Street and North Nescopec Street\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThe Welsh Cemetery was evidently in the churchyard, but the church ceased to exist sometime in the 1880’s. The lot is still vacant with no indications where the cemetery was exactly located, although some of the older residents of town insist that headstones still remain beneath the soil.\n\nZion Lutheran Cemetery, Tamaqua\n\nNorth Columbia and Church Streets\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nOffice: Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church\n\n109 North Greenwood Street\n\nTamaqua, Pennsylvania 18252\n\nZion Lutheran Church broke from St. John’s Lutheran Church in 1864 over an argument about which language the service should be in: English or German. Since then, Zion’s has sometimes been referred to as the English Lutheran Church or even just the English Church (although it is not to be confused with the Calvary Episcopal Church, also of Tamaqua). The cemetery is likewise sometimes referred to as the English Cemetery but, years ago, was primarily known as Greenwood Cemetery.\n\nA map does exist and is in the care of the church.\n\nNo known index of the cemetery exists.\n\nInformation Last Updated: February 24, 2009\n\nSt. John’s Lutheran Cemetery, Tamaqua\n\n215 Patterson Streets\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nOffice: St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church\n\nPine and East Mauch Chunk Streets\n\nTamaqua, Pennsylvania 18252\n\nThis cemetery exists in what was the church yard of the first church in Tamaqua, St. John’s Lutheran and Reformed Church. It is now in the Dutch Hill section of Tamaqua, but the church and cemetery originally existed in what was Rahn Township and was not part of Tamaqua until the township became part of the borough in 1971. The church was known as St. John’s by 1820 and has since become the patriarch of many of Tamaqua current churches, including Trinity UCC, St. John’s UCC, Zion Evangelical Lutheran, and, of course, St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church. The cemetery is just as old as the church. Most of the original tombstones in the older section are in German and are either impossible to read or no longer existent. The newer section of the cemetery is still being used and is in good care. The entire cemetery is maintained by St. John’s Lutheran Church of Tamaqua.\n\nMany years ago (at an unknown date), a transcription was made of all the tombstones in the cemetery. The records were rearranged, retyped, and indexed in 1973. They are arranged by row in the cemetery (not alphabetically) and are in German. The Tamaqua Public Library holds a copy of the transcription.\n\nQuite separately, a transcription of two pastor’s burial records exists, although it is not clear if the records are burials in just the parish cemetery or just include burials the pastors presided over in other cemeteries as well.\n\nA map exists of all but the first three sections of the cemetery and is in possession of the church. The first three sections are the old sections and, if necessary, I imagine a grave location can approximately be found by walking the cemetery by row with the 1973 transcription in hand (most of the tombstones are weathered beyond legibility).\n\nThere is no known on-line information.\n\nThe various transcriptions of the original records can be found at the State Library in Harrisburg, the Schuylkill County Historical Society, the Tamaqua Area Public Library, and the Pottsville Free Public Library. The records in their original form, or what remains of the early records, are held by the church.\n\nInformation Last Updated: February 24, 2009\n\nSs. Peter and Pauls’ Cemetery (Lithuanian Cemetery), Owl Creek\n\n220 Owl Creek Road\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nOffice: Ss. Peter and Paul Catholic Church\n\n307 Pine Street\n\nTamaqua, Pennsylvania 18252\n\n(570) 668-1150\n\nThis cemetery, variously called Ss. Peter and Paul’s Cemetery, Owl Creek Cemetery, and the Lithuanian Cemetery is typically used by Ss. Peter and Pauls’ Catholic Church in Tamaqua (founded 1911) and St. John the Baptist Catholic Church of Coaldale (founded 1914 and closed in 2008). Both churches have a Lithuanian affiliation, but care for the cemetery rests with the Tamaqua church. The cemetery is easy to pass without knowing it if you are driving east from Route 309 on Owl Creek Road. It rests high on the hill to the right perhaps a mile after turning off Route 309 onto Owl Creek Road.\n\nOn-line indexes exists at www.lithuaniangenealogy.org/databases/pa/sspeter-paul.html\n\nA map exists. It is in the possession of the cemetery caretaker.\n\nInformation Last Updated: February 24, 2009\n\nPotter’s Field\n\nUnknown Location in Tamaqua, PA\n\n“Iron Steps”, a book about the history of Tamaqua written by Donald R. Serfass in 1995, mentions a plot land dedicated in 1850 to the burial of indigent persons. The location of the cemetery is stated to have been somewhere in the middle ward of town (between Washington and Lincoln Streets) and contains at least two residents, although their names and dates of death are unknown. All that is known is that the fatalities occurred during the smallpox epidemic of the 1850’s.\n\nBethany Methodist Cemetery, Barnesville\n\n20 Holly Road\n\nBarnesville, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThis cemetery is located to the rear of the church by the same name. Burials seem to have taken place here as early as the 1850’s. An online index of graves exists at http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/schuylkill/cemeteries/Bethany.txt\n\nBrouse/Hauch Family Cemetery, Barnesville\n\nLatitude: 40°50’12.50″ N\n\nLongitude: 76°02’03.00″ W\n\nProducts Road near Marian Avenue\n\nBarnesville, PA\n\nThe cemetery is very small (perhaps 20 burials) and is along an un-paved road that is lined by the fence of Air Products Industrial Park. According to “Schuylkill County Archives, Volume II” by Rice and Dellock, the cemetery’s proper name is not known but contains relatively many Brouses and Haucks.\n\nThe book is held by the Tamaqua Public Library.\n\nWhite Church Cemetery, Barnesville\n\nField and Church Roads\n\nBarnesville, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThe “White Church” (as it is called by locals) has a history of three other names: Christ Evangelical Lutheran and Reformed Church, Christ Evangelical Union Church, and United Church of Christ. The cemetery is a large one with burials from the 1860’s. The headstone transcription is part of Schuylkill County Archives Volume II and is held by the Tamaqua Public Library. Another transcription exists at http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/schuylkill/cemeteries/christch.txt\n\nSky View Memorial Park, Hometown\n\n108 Lafayette Avenue\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThe cemetery was established in 1947 with approximately 9,500 burials having been conducted since, making it one of the two largest cemeteries in the Tamaqua area.\n\nThe cemetery has no religious or cultural affiliation.\n\nAn index exists for the cemetery; it was completed several years ago when volunteers transcribed all of the headstones in the cemetery. The index can be viewed by surname at http://www.usgwarchives.net/pa/schuylkill/pdf/skyview.pdf or by section at http://usgwarchives.net/pa/schuylkill/cemet.htm\n\nGrave-numbered maps are in the possession of the office at Sky View.\n\nInformation Last Updated: September 7, 2009\n\nSons of Jacob Jewish Cemetery, Hometown\n\nLincoln Drive and Joyce Street\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThis cemetery stems from a synagogue by the same name that formerly existed on Schuylkill Avenue in Tamaqua. The synagogue was formed in 1913 and closed sometime in the late 1950’s or early 1960’s.\n\nThe cemetery is known to have also served the Jewish populations of several other coal region towns including Mahanoy City and Shenandoah. One stone, in fact, reads: “Here are buried the old prayer books of the Beth Israel Congregation, Mahanoy City, PA, July 11, 1937.”\n\nMost headstones include Hebrew script which is not reproduced in this index, completed March 20, 2010 by Eric Zizelmann:\n\nAlbert, Shirley L., 1903, 1991,\n\nAugust, Emanuel F., Aug 11, 1914, July 20, 2001,\n\nAugust, Nona R., Feb 15, 1918, —,\n\nBlum, Nathan, 1899, 1987,\n\nBohard, Betty S., 1896, 1990, Mother\n\nBohard, Levi, 1889, 1948, Father\n\nBohorad, Anna, —, Aug 1973, Beloved Wife\n\nBohorad, Bessie, 1878, 1959, Mother\n\nBohorad, Goldye R., 1911, 1993, Mother\n\nBohorad, Harry, —, May 1973, Beloved Husband\n\nBohorad, Herman, 1910, 1956,\n\nBohorad, Jacob, 1925, 1989, Beloved Son and Brother\n\nBohorad, James P., 1905, 1964, Father\n\nBohorad, Morris, 1881, 1947, Father\n\nBohorad, Nathan, 1870, 1938, Father\n\nBohorad, Tillie, 1890, 1956, Mother\n\nBoyewsky, Benjamin, 1915, 1975, Brother\n\nBoyewsky, Celia Benn, 1910, 1985, Mother and Sister\n\nBoyewsky, Katie, 1885, 1968, Mother\n\nBoyewsky, Sam, 1883, 1956, Father\n\nBrown, Bernice Kaplan, Dec 31, 1931, March 26, 1990,\n\nCohen, Hanna, —, Sept 22, 1944, Mother\n\nCohen, Myer, —, Aug 5, 1939, Father\n\nCohen, Samuel, —, July 11, 1957, Father, WWI\n\nCole, Samuel G., 1895, 1944, Sgt.

The two are the only cemeteries in Ryan Township. Headstones from both cemeteries are transcribed in “Schuylkill County Archives” by Rice and Dellock. The book is held by the Tamaqua Public Library. An online index also exists at http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/schuylkill/cemeteries/stpeteryan.txt\n\nThe earliest burials in St. Peter’s Cemetery are from the 1850’s, while the earliest in the Hersker Cemetery seem to be from the 1920’s.\n\nSt. Bartholomew’s Catholic Cemetery, Brockton\n\nCemetery Road and Union Street\n\nBrockton, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nSt. Bartholomew’s Church was established in 1846. It is one of only two churches in Brockton (the other being St. Mary’s Byzantine Church) and historically had a Lithuanian affiliation. The church was permanently closed in 2008 as part of the restructuring of the Diocese of Allentown, but the cemetery is still in use.\n\nLike most area churches, the parish did not track individual burials in the cemetery but did keep records of the lot owners as lots were sold. In 2005, a map was created based on this data, but the map only reflects surnames of lot owners and, in some cases, surnames on the headstone when they differ from the owner on record (refer to the key on the map for an explanation).\n\nThe church did not have records of burials or lots in Section A, the oldest section of the cemetery. Indeed, the headstones in this section seem to be randomly placed.\n\nClick here to open the map in a new window. You will need to use the Zoom feature in Internet Explorer to magnify the map in order to read the surnames — it is recommended that your magnify to 400%.\n\nThe surnames of lot owners and headstones have been indexed as follows:\n\nSurname, Section, Lot No.\n\nAdamo, B, 41\n\nAgosti, B, 66\n\nAgosti, B, 93\n\nAlonge, B, 58\n\nAmes, E, 69\n\nAndregiz, A, Below lot 12\n\nArmbruster, B,

In the atlas (Click here to open the map in a new window ), the northern end of the street empties into a park and a cemetery. Who was buried in the cemetery and what happened to those buried there is unknown as the land is now a private residence. Presumably the cemetery belonged to whichever church “Church Street” was named after.\n\nZion UCC Cemetery (abandoned), Tuscarora\n\nStrawberry Street and Church Street\n\nTuscarora, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThe church register for this church was discovered in 2009 and includes a history of the congregation. The history states that the building was erected in 1847 by an Episcopalian congregation, was abandoned, and finally was possessed by a Reformed congregation circa 1893 (we were surprised too). The church became a United Church of Christ congregation in 1957.\n\nThe cemetery is in exceedingly poor condition with many sunken graves that have no marker. Many of the tombstones are unreadable.

The index is by surname, then by first name with a page and entry number given referencing the 1941 survey. The Tamaqua Public Library holds a copy of the index by Zehner.\n\nThe cemetery tombstones were, in fact, enumerated again in 1964 by Raymond Hollenbach (FHL US/Can Film 1305846, Item 7). The introduction to Zehner’s index notes that the Hollenbach survery, while containing an index, also “…contains a disturbing variety of errors…”. He recommends using the Hollenbach work to find tombstones erected between 1941 and 1964 and the Unger work for everything else.\n\nSt. Peter’s Union Cemetery, West Penn\n\n184 St. Peters Road\n\nTamaqua, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nSt. Peter’s headstones were indexed in 1964 (along with Zion’s Union Cemetery and Emmanuel United Methodist Cemetery, both in West Penn) by Raymond Hollenbach.

The cemetery is still in use.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, the cemetery was surveyed and mapped using CIMS software. Using CIMS, Joe Nihen of Lansford made the extensive effort to record every burial and photograph every headstone in the cemetery. The map is in the care of St. Katharine Drexel’s. Joe and Father Medve of St. Katharine Drexel agreed to donate a copy of the index of burials to the Tamaqua Public Library in 2011. Thanks for all of your efforts, Joe!\n\n[What looks to be one cemetery on the far East side of Summit Hill is actually nine seperate cemeteries. Street addresses do not seem to apply to these locations, so it is recommended that latitude and longitude coordinates be used to distinguish the cemeteries from one another.]\n\nGrand Army Cemetery, Summit Hill\n\nLatitude: 40°49’41.54″ N\n\nLongitude: 75°51’41.15″ W\n\n364 East White Street\n\nSummit Hill, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThis is one of the few Protestant cemeteries in the Summit Hill area and by far the largest. Records of burials do exist on index cards that have recently come to the care of the Summit Hill Historical Society. As of 2010, the news was that the Historical Society was engaged in the process of indexing the records. There is a map to the cemetery that shows lot and section numbers, but not surnames. Hence, only a deed in conjunction with the map will result in a grave being found unless the cemetery is walked.\n\nSacred Heart Polish National Church Cemetery, Summit Hill\n\nLatitude: 40°49’35.37″ N\n\nLongitude: 75°51’37.34″ W\n\n458 East Ludlow Street\n\nSummit Hill, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThis cemetery is small as compared to the others in Summit Hill – a grave would only take a few minutes to find.

It was also known to serve the former Polish congregation of Summit Hill, St. Stanislaus. Ss. Peter and Paul’s congregation is now part of St. Katharine Drexel of Lansford, while St. Stanislaus was incorporated into St. Joseph’s of Summit Hill.

In 2008, the former St. Stanislaus Polish Catholic Church was incorporated into St. Joseph’s. Both of the church’s cemeteries (old and new) are in good care, although the majority of recent burials occur at the White Bear location. The cemetery has also served in part the Irish congregations of the former St. Ann’s of Lansford and the former St. Mary’s of Coaldale. There are no known maps or indexes of burials.\n\nA partial list of burials in the old cemetery (i.e. not the newer cemetery in White Bear) exists at: http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gsr&GScid=2251006\n\nSt. Joseph’s Catholic Cemetery (new), White Bear\n\nLatitude: 40°49’52.06″ N\n\nLongitude: 75°50’22.11″ W\n\n250 East White Bear Drive\n\nSummit Hill, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\n(See a description under St. Joseph’s Catholic Cemetery (old), Summit Hill).\n\nSt. Joseph’s Catholic Churchyard Cemetery, Summit Hill\n\n462 West Ludlow Street\n\nSummit Hill, PA\n\nClick here for a map of this location\n\nThis cemetery was declared abandoned in 1959 (source www.findagrave.com) although one headstone remains.

To a lesser degree, this cemetery also had been known to be used by the Slovak Ss. Cyril and Methodius Church in Coaldale (although that parish had their own cemetery in Nesquehoing).\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, an effort to organize these cemeteries was initiated. Using CIMS software, the cemetery was surveyed and mapped. The map is in the care of the church. Through the efforts of Joe Nihen of Lansford, each headstone was photographed and recorded.
