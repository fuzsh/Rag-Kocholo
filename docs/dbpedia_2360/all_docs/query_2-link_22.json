        "text": "A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the peculiar phenomenon of growing up parodic—that is, of having experienced the world, almost from the cradle, through the distorted lens of farce. And, lo and behold, the Comments section dogpile of the week can be found atop a New York Times “Opinionator” piece by Christy Wampole, an assistant professor of French at Princeton University who proffers much-needed instruction on “How to Live Without Irony.”\n\nEvery few years, it seems, irony goes on trial in America. Does anyone remember Jedediah Purdy, the wunderkind whose 1999 book, For Common Things: Irony, Trust, and Commitment in America Today, was released when its author was a stripling Yale Law student of 24? This was not long before the twin towers crumbled and Time and Graydon Carter announced the death of irony, which stayed on the slab for all of 48 hours. (That particular moratorium was defied in Salon.com in a piece just good enough to link.) The inquisition continues, despite the fact that we as a people seem to have a tenuous grip on what, in actual fact, irony is.\n\nA good deal of fun was had some years back with Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic,” with its citing of things “ironic” that were, in fact, nothing of the sort. Such fudging was fairly forgivable from a 21-year-old Canadian singer-songwriter, particularly since her album was baldly awful on so many other levels that her misappropriation of a high school literary term seemed like small beer. It is somewhat more disconcerting to encounter a thirtysomething academic with tenure track in sight who has not yet learned to discriminate between irony (a word which occurs 16 times in the body of her piece), which she claims to be addressing/ redressing, and cynicism (occurring once), which she actually is. The title—“How to Live Without Irony”—tells you just about everything you need to know about the condescending tone of Miss Wampole’s screed, which begins with a patently false premise, “If irony is the ethos of our age—and it is…”, and proceeds to pile one assumption atop another. (As one who very recently watched the Thanksgiving Day parade broadcast on ABC-TV, I can assure you that irony is not the ethos of this or any age.) I was particularly taken with Miss Wampole’s entirely unnecessary bit of casual name-dropping: “My friend Robert Pogue Harrison…” In the same spirit, I will mention that my friend Justin Stewart and I have a running joke that plays on the rampant misuse of “ironically” which consists of compulsively inappropriate prefixing statements with the word, as in “Ironically, I already had lunch,” or “Ironically, that article was a piece of shit.”\n\nIronically, irony’s cache wasn’t always so low. The focus of Miss Wampole’s research is given as “20th- and 21st-century French and Italian literature and thought.” And while I am certain that Miss Wampole could conjugate rings around me, it’s hard to believe, given her area of expertise, that she is unfamiliar with the phrase “irony and pity,” coined (or at least popularized) by the French novelist and all-around man of letters, Anatole France: “L’Ironie et la Pitié sont deux bonnes conseillères: l’une, en souriant, nous rend la vie aimable; l’autre, qui pleure, nous la rend sacrée.” (“Irony and pity are excellent counselors. With a smile, the former makes life pleasant; the latter, with its tears, makes it sacred.”)\n\nThe phrase became something of a yardstick for measuring artistic accomplishment for proceeding generations—and, in fact, it still holds up rather well in that capacity. In his appreciation of George Herriman’s Krazy Kat comics, the American cultural critic Gilbert Seldes wrote, “It is this touch of irony and pity which transforms all of Herriman’s work, which relates it, for all that the material is preposterous, to something profoundly true and moving.” This passage appears in Seldes’ 1924 “The Seven Lively Arts,” a benchmark study of America’s burgeoning “low,” popular arts, including comic strips, jazz, vaudeville, and slapstick silents. So fond was Seldes of the phrase that he used it repeatedly: “Fitzgerald racing over the country, jotting down whatever was current in college circles, is not nearly as significant as Fitzgerald regarding a tiny section of life and reporting it with irony and pity and a consuming passion.” A New York Times reviewer (Seldes again?) liked the sound of it so much that he cadged it for a March 7,1926 review of Fitzgerald’s “All the Sad Young Men”: “Thus it is that Mr. Fitzgerald has come to irony and pity, and the peace and wisdom that is inherent in partial success, as well as the disillusionment of dream.” In time, “irony and pity” had become so commonplace that Hemingway had a bit of fun with it in The Sun Also Rises.\n\nFor Miss Wampole, however, irony is far from a virtue—in fact, it’s pitiful. Her straw man target is the irony-addicted hipster who “haunts every city street and university town.” This hipster remains a somewhat hazy and etiolated figure; we do learn that he or she “studies relentlessly, foraging for what has yet to be found by the mainstream”—one would think a fairly earnest endeavor—although this is belied by the illustration accompanying her article, by one Mr. Leif Parsons, which shows a young man and woman wearing Justin Bieber tee-shirts. The overall bent of Miss Wampole’s argument rallies against such “ironic” appropriation of mainstream culture—which presumably acts as a distraction from the lofty and the beautiful, i.e. “20th- and 21st-century French and Italian literature and thought.” All of this is predicated on Miss Wampole’s disbelief that others could find sincere pleasure in things she despises, to paraphrase The Louvin Brothers’ “The Christian Life” (Covered by The Byrds with, it must be said, a degree of galling irony.) We are fortunate that this pecksniffishness has not always been the rule in American intellectual life—far from Axel’s Castle or the ivory tower, Seldes, happily doing the breast-stroke through the mainstream, seriously engaged with everything low and lively in America, and enriched our understanding of ourselves immeasurably.\n\nThere is maybe a paragraph’s worth of legitimate argument that could be extracted from Miss Wampole’s jeremiad—nothing, however, that wasn’t covered in this Onion article of 2000. Certainly, if one allows one’s self to engage with the world of pop, one must accept certain of its premises in doing so, and there is always the risk of becoming accustomed to a diet of dross to the exclusion of much else, of watching a hundred hours of Storage Wars while “Ulysses” gathers dust, unread on the shelf (Or flushing your journalistic integrity down the toilet to be flown around the world by Rihanna.) I am not ready yet to proclaim, however, that “I have seen the best minds of my generation writing snarky Vulture recaps of reality shows.”\n\nRick Alverson’s The Comedy, which has meanwhile finished a run at BAMcinematek, might be a nightmare visualization of the “cultural numbness, resignation and defeat” that Miss Wampole diagnoses as endemic. As a “statement” about our culture or Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where it’s set—and it gives little enough indication of desiring to be a statement—Alverson’s movie isn’t worth a tinkerer’s damn. It’s fairly fascinating, however, as a character study and autocritique of the negating comic personae of its performers—Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (of Tim and Eric, Awesome Show, Great Job!) and Gregg Turkington (a/k/a Neil Hamburger)—taken here to a logical (dead-) endpoint. I particularly enjoyed the depiction of the mutually-reinforcing group dynamics, here a closed circle whose interplay had developed into something like a deadpan staring contest, with each daring someone else to crack a sincere smile. Self-destructive though it may be, Tim and Eric’s punitive comedy is necessary ipecac for a culture which, despite what you may have heard, is fairly glutted on earnestness.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nLast week, in my musings about the thin line between engaging with and becoming caught up in the self-perpetuating, self-justifying hamster wheel of pop culture, I mentioned Rihanna’s gimmick 777 Tour, and the bought-and-paid-for journos who’d participated in it (and bit the hand that passed them their meal vouchers). This week Rihanna will have to serve as my springing off point.\n\nThis may occasion some awkwardness, as I know as little about Rihanna is as possible for one who spends eighteen hours a day on-line. (And who went to high school with her sometime touring guitarist!) I know of her tormented creative and personal relationship to Chris Brown, whose ebulliently stupid anthem “Yeah X3” I wholly confess preferring to any of the monotone, lusterless grinders that have rolled off the Rihanna assembly line. I have, in one context or another, heard all of her singles. “We Found Love,” with its refrain “We found love in a hopeless place,” I will forever associate with a parking lot in downtown Hartford, Connecticut, where I heard it piping from the attendant’s booth—a pretty hopeless place, indeed. And at some point during the last year, in an ongoing dreary attempt to keep abreast of “What the kids are listening to,” I watched the music video for her “You Da One,” also off 2011’s Talk That Talk, my dewlapped, laptop-illuminated face frozen in rapt attention for Ri-Ri’s three-and-a-half minute Little Egypt act.\n\nA few words about music videos. One still encounters “MTV-style editing” used as a vague pejorative in some circles, but today the music video has inevitably been accepted as a species of art, as with all things once low, tawdry, and despised—I am writing shortly after “The Art of Video Games” ends its run at the Smithsonian. In its nascent days, the music video was treated with particular contempt by the cognoscenti. One of the salient accusations held that first generation video directors were rifling through the entire back-catalog of experimental and avant-garde cinema, magpies plucking out techniques and images that had been arrived at through long, interiorized processes of artistic crystallization. Wrenched free from their original context, which had been integral to their meaning, these techniques and images were basely used to hawk records—stealing from Maya Deren, say, to give to Madonna.\n\nThis accusation was, of course, fundamentally true. One of the more baffling programming endeavors currently underway in New York City is an attempt, at 92 Y Tribeca, to legitimize adman-turned-filmmaker Tony Scott’s garbage movies by pairing films from his gobbledygook oeuvre with avant-garde shorts. I am sure the comparison will prove enlightening, one way or another.\n\nBe that as it may: The video for “You da One” was directed by 31-year-old Melina Matsoukas, an apparently much in-demand director and my near exact contemporary who wrote her graduate thesis at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts on music videos. So, some thirty-two years after the first MTV broadcast (Chronicled in a new oral history that I will almost certainly read in spite of myself) and some fifty after the arrival of the Scopitone, we have moved from pilfering the avant-garde—themselves cultural scavengers, as in Jack Smith’s repurposing of Maria Montez—to expertly pilfering the past pilferers.\n\n“You da One” is a “sexy” video. I am employing scare quotes, because I have roughly as much erotic response to Rihanna as I do to, say, a Styrofoam cup or a slab of Formica. Rihanna’s private dancer show in “You da One,” however, got me to thinking of a video that had a pretty seismic effect on my young libido, released as it was when I was thirteen years old: The Breeders’ “Divine Hammer”:\n\nThe video is credited to Kim Gordon, that hip Zelig Spike Jonze, and Richard Kern—and I am willing to bet that the black-and-white segments in which Kim Deal is bending and stretching on a palette for the delectation of a camera perched overhead are the work of Kern. (There is another version of the video, hosted on YouTube by Breeders’ label 4AD, which replaces these segments with interpolations of the band playing. Needless to say, it is not nearly so interesting.)\n\nKern was one of those down-and-out Manhattan decadents who, along with Lydia Lunch and Nick Zedd, banded together under the rubric of “Cinema of Transgression” in the early ‘80s, all interested in exploring the outer limits of deviant sexuality. Watching Kern and Zedd’s Thrust in Me, in which Zedd throat-fucks his own cross-dressed doppelganger, was certainly a revelation of sorts to my adolescent self when it was rented from Alexandria, Virginia’s late, lamented Video Vault.\n\nWhat was so enrapturing about the “Divine Hammer” video? What made it hot in a way that, say, MTV’s “The Grind” most assuredly was not? I would venture to guess that it was something to do with a bracing “realness.” Kim Deal looked like a girl you would see around—in fact, she’s from outside Dayton, Ohio, 40 miles as the crow flies from where I grew up—and there is something incredibly intimate and playful in her limbering up, as though she’s getting ready to take somebody—Please, please me!—to the mat.\n\nThe simulation of privileged intimacy in Kern’s bedroom shoots, a world away from music-video choreography and studio gloss, would in time combine with the aesthetic of porno from the shot-on-the-fly 8mm smoker era. The result was a popularized, deliberately-awkward amateur-smut aesthetic whose development can be traced through Mark Romanek’s 1997 video for Fiona Apple’s “Criminal,” Vincent Gallo’s 1997 Buffalo ’66 (and the pederastic, paneled ’70s rec-room ads by Gallo’s sometime-employer, Calvin Klein), right up through to the adverts by American Apparel that grace the back cover of Vice Magazine, in which Kern’s pictures regularly appear today, supplemented by affiliated online television network VBS.tv’s “Shot By Kern” featurettes. The past decade has seen a concurrent boom in demographic-targeting alt-porn; while grand-dad was content to glance over his centerfold’s Turn-Offs, the contemporary hip consumer wants to know that the young lady whom he or she is about to watch have anal sex is a fan of Alkaline Trio, or, in the case of Sasha Grey—photographed by Kern!—is a card-carrying Existentialist. This is something like the erotic equivalent of conscientious farm-to-table dining, and may even constitute an ethical advancement of some sort. I have no idea.\n\nIt was, incidentally, at Vice’s music site Noisey that I found a response to Christy Wampole’s NY Times Opinionator piece on irony (discussed in this space last week), which drew certain conclusions that almost made me want to scuttle to Miss Wampole’s defense: “…often, popular things are popular because they’re really good, or at least aggressively interesting. This is pretty much the entire principle behind capitalism.” A Montreal-to-New York City transplant, Vice has always had a libertarian editorial bent; I suspect certain Canadians (e.g. Neal Peart) are sometimes susceptible to reactionary overpraise of the free market because Canadian content quotas have driven them half-mad with Barenaked Ladies.\n\nThe term “popular” is a rather tricky one. Implicit in it is the assumption that the cultural landscape is a level playing field, and that a pronounced majority of consumers have, with all options spread before them, collectively opted to promote certain artists or texts with their monetary “vote.” While this is theoretically true in the everything-available-all-the-time era of the Internet, it is also true that popularity can still be fairly effectively coerced in a number of ways—in the free market United States as in Communist Canada. Certain properties—Rihanna, Gerard Butler, Catherine Heigl—are popular not because they have an intrinsic quality that exercises a magnetic, “aggressively interesting” draw on a significant portion of the consumer population, but because unimaginable amounts of money have been pumped into making them so. The textbook example of manufactured popularity is the ‘80s “phenomenon” of hair metal, essentially a record company conspiracy that entailed shipping vast quantities of units in order to record an inflated Billboard position in the first week on the charts—equivalent to the all-important Opening Weekend grosses. It was a mirage that blew away the moment something, anything else made itself available in rock. (The recent tanked attempt to cash in on hair metal nostalgia by Rock of Ages only proved the nonexistence of the phenomena to begin with.)\n\nTo return to “Divine Hammer”: Was Kern and Deal’s flashpoint of “realness” nothing more than another marketable aesthetic that, in its proper turn in the changing of fashions, could vie with airbrushed artifice? Is Sex Sells always just Sex Sells, whether the du jour product is Kim Deal or Rihanna? Is anyone a sell-out anymore, or is worship of the bitch-goddess Success the only abiding standard? Is there still such a thing as “co-opting” by the “mainstream”? Was there ever? Does the avant-garde exist in essence only as a test lab used to gestate ideas and images that can then be disseminated to the wider public, as suggested in The Rebel Sell by Joseph Heath & Andrew Potter? (Canadians, of course!) Why would I, at any given moment, infinitely prefer to re-watch Herschel Gordon Lewis’s Blood Feast, made with the crassest possible motives of profit from human degradation, than watch Herbert Biberman’s Salt of the Earth, made with the noblest possible motives of increasing human dignity? Stay tuned for these and other adventures in cultural consumerism on the next Bombast; in the meantime, here’s Juliana Hatfield in her underwear:\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nYou could do worse for career advice than consulting Wizard, though Peter Boyle’s monologue does leave a few dangling questions.\n\nSome time ago I saw a documentary called Je t’aime… moi non plus: Artistes et critiques, which was comprised of footage shot at the Cannes Film Festival by the actress Maria de Medeiros, Bruce Willis’ whinging girlfriend from Pulp Fiction, and a vision in the great João César Monteiro’s 1982 Silvestre.\n\nThe subject is the testy relationship between, yes, critics and artists—namely, filmmakers. De Medeiros takes her title from a Serge Gainsbourg song—it translates, basically, as “I love you… me neither”—famously recorded with Jane Birkin, whose enraptured and breathy delivery gave rise to rumors that she was, in fact, getting fucked in the recording booth by Gainsbourg. Given that neither directors nor critics are, for the most part, eye-candy, I am not certain why de Medeiros saw fit to plant this particular image in her viewers’ heads.\n\nI don’t remember much from de Medeiros’ not-terribly-professional film, except for a pretty good crack by Pedro Almodóvar, which went something like: “No child ever says ‘I want to be a film critic when I grow up.’” The idea is that criticism is a sour grapes career taken up only by those who can’t hack it as directors—a pretty reductive way to regard not only critics but, implicitly, the panoply of types who participate in the various strata of the filmmaking process, a process of which criticism is, yes, an indivisible part.\n\nWhile most children who aspire to a career in movies will naturally latch onto the most glamorous or visible roles initially—stars and starlets, the name above the title—time and experience teaches that one’s particular gifts or proclivities might mark one for another line of work. If you have spent any time in film school you know that there are certain people who are just natural-born grips: They have simian climbing capabilities; they feel duvetyne and spring clamps on a deep, spiritual level; they keep their souls in their work gloves. And while it is absurd to say that any grip will ever be able to exercise an authorial influence on a picture equal to what a director can, it is just as absurd to suggest that, in having found their proper place in the on-set ecosystem, they have somehow failed to live up to their destiny as directors.\n\nAs for being on-set, my own professional—that is, non-student—career began and ended with three days in Cleveland attached in some subservient, unpaid capacity to the Art Department of the American Splendor film. During this time I got to re-paint the trim in an East Side diner and listen to the New York-based personnel make fun of working-class Northern Ohio accents while they were drawing pay for working on a film about a man whose life work was a paean to working-class Northern Ohio. Which is, of course, no fault of the film itself—which also stunk, but that’s beside the point—but did establish my total incapacity to function in an environment I didn’t have a modicum of control over, i.e. in an environment that wasn’t my living room. (By the way, has everyone seen the bizarre Harvey Pekar statue recently unveiled in Cleveland Heights-University Heights Public Library?)\n\nI was about to say that American Splendor was also the last unpaid work that I’d ever done, but that discounts the first few years of movie chat that I wrote for public perusal—which, strange as it seems today, didn’t really seem like work at the time. I think I eventually squeaked in under the deadline dictated by Mark Twain: “Write without pay until somebody offers pay. If nobody offers within three years, the candidate may look upon this circumstance with the most implicit confidence as the sign that sawing wood is what he was intended for.”\n\nThis sage advice, which has stood the test of generations, may finally be showing its whiskers. As established by a much-discussed tumblr account that has recently cropped up, no-body is actually going to offer to pay you a subsistence wage for journalism, ever. Jane Birkin, it seems, isn’t the only one getting fucked on the job! The plight of film journos in particular was brought up in a recent interview with Elvis Mitchell, formerly of the NY Times: “The workload for a film critic today is just so Herculean. They’re writing reviews, they’re blogging and they’re doing extra things for the Web. And, with movies that are based on books, you want to at least give the book a thumb-through and prepare. Add in film festivals and I’m not sure how people in the profession can keep up with it today. It’s just shattering now, the workload.”\n\nThe workload is such, of course, because each of the abovementioned activities pays fry-cook wages. (Meanwhile, here in NYC, even the fry-cooks are trying to unionize…) All of which is probably more unfair to those being written about than to those that are writing. I think frequently to something I dredged up in the process of putting together an article on writer/ director Bill Gunn—his 1973 letter to the NY Times: “One white critic left my film Ganja & Hess after 20 minutes and reviewed the entire film. Another was to see three films in one day and review them all. This is a crime. Three years in three different people’s lives graded in one afternoon by a complete stranger to the artist and to the culture.”\n\nThe situation today is, then, pretty grim. Was the situation ever much better? I am dubious. Of his move from The Chicago Reader to the The Chicago Tribune, Dave Kehr told an interviewer in 2001: “The Reader was a great place, but I couldn’t afford to work there when I was 35 years old. It was definitely time to move on to a more grown-up job, one where I could make enough money to live without a roommate and with more comfort. That’s pretty much impossible at alternative newspapers.” And that doesn’t just go for alternative newspapers—one of the few revelations of interest in Brian Kellow’s recent Pauline Kael biography was the fact that, even when arguably the most famous movie writer in America, Kael was barely making a living.\n\nTo embark on a career in arts journalism is, then, and perhaps always has been, to predestine one’s self for failure in any terms recognized by society as a whole. The problem is that to write with any degree of effectiveness requires not only sustenance and a room of one’s own, but a certain amount of self-esteem—and where is one to find self-esteem without the visible trappings of success?\n\nThe life of Harvey Pekar, who wrote his comics (and journalism besides) while steadily employed as a file clerk at a Cleveland VA Hospital, suggests one solution: Get a regular gig, then do what you want on the side. (Though who past a certain age wants to write about Rise of the Guardians out of pure love of wordcraft?) Otherwise, I recommend the unearned assumption of spiritual aristocracy. Reading the great American literary critic Van Wyck Brooks’ chronicle New England: Indian Summer, I ran across the following description of the poet Edwin Arlington Robinson at the end of the 19th century, which suggests the proper intellectual alchemy for transforming life’s lead into gold:\n\n“In a day when success was the only visible goddess, a poet could only point out that it signified failure; and Robinson’s successful men were Feathertops in every case, whited sepulchers full of dead men’s bones. This, and its natural corollary, was the whole of his teaching. In all his long psychological poems, he stripped the emperors of their clothes—what was false within always betrayed them; while he turned the tables on conventional opinion by showing goodness and genius walking in tatters. It was the Fernando Nashes and the Captain Craigs, the castaways who ‘went begging’ that really ‘went giving;’ and this, the oldest of morals for poets, had never ceased to be new.”\n\nSo I say to you, striving young journos, in lieu of any material reward, remember that your penury is proof of moral superiority, and that the home-owners at your forthcoming high school reunion are so many whited sepulchers! Like Arrested Development’s “Mr. Wendell,” you have a freedom that the 9 to 5ers think is dumb! Easier for a camel to pass through a needle’s eye and all of that! And if you try to take any freelance work off of me, so help me God I’ll mash you into the muck and mire like one of those rebels at the beginning of Lincoln.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications.

Even though the beast never stood up on its hind paws, one got the feeling after a while that it was really a man. And it was!\n\nAmong all the agonies invented by these virtuosos of torture, this appears to me their masterpiece—one which degrades man in his dignity as a creature, in his resemblance to God. But the strangest thing about all this is that the man-dog was not a Frenchman, nor a Jew; he was a German, the former anti-Nazi mayor of Weimar. Since 1933 these hangmen had reduced him to the condition of a brute by means of a patient, insatiable cruelty. Nightmare magicians, they had taken the time to perfect their sorcery. What successful malefice! The mayor of Weimar, literally, had become a dog!\n\nThe preceding is from the writings of the great Catholic writer François Mauriac. It popped into my head while watching Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty, during a scene set in a Saudi Arabia “black site,” where the CIA operative played by Jason Clarke yanks the prisoner that he is interrogating around on a leash. The jailer’s reduction of man to dog, specifically in the Nazi death camps, was treated explicitly in Paul Schrader’s 2008 movie Adam Resurrected, which I am sometimes convinced that I am the only living person to have seen. With Bigelow’s film, however, I seem not to be the lone person who has had a visceral response to its images of torture—this time as being perpetrated by Americans—or to the very idea of them.\n\nAs my friend and concise thinker Adam Nayman pointed out, the torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty take up not more than ten minutes of two-and-a-half-hours—or, as it’s known today, standard running time. These ten minutes, however, are already 2012’s most hotly-debated reel of film, even by those who haven’t seen them—to wit, Glenn Greenwald’s shit-stirring piece in The Guardian, a publication popular with self-satisfied upper middle-class Islingtonians, whose headline refers to Bigelow’s film as “torture-glorifying.”\n\nNew York Magazine’s David Edelstein, singled out in Greenwald’s piece, put in a “vigorously wishy-washy” appearance on Hardball to further explain himself. Critics, in numbers described by Greenwald as “a small flotilla” in one of his postscripts, descended upon pundit Greenwald’s opportunistic breach of their territory, seeing one of their own under attack by a writer who had, after all, violated a fairly fundamental rule of the critical profession by making claims about a movie without having seen the movie in question.\n\nAll of Greenwald’s defensive hemming and hawing aside, “glorifying” is a loaded term, and one that I cannot believe that anyone who’d witnessed the solemn, melancholy, strictly-business acts of strategic degradation in Bigelow’s film would be tempted to use. In Greenwald’s own paper, Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal almost immediately appeared to defend their decision to make “extreme interrogation” a part of their narrative. Elsewhere, in The American Prospect, Tom Carson likened the preemptive condemnation of ZD30 to the activity of “Bill Donohue and the Catholic League.”\n\nIncidentally, as of yesterday, MoMA began a retrospective of the films of the Italian director, poet, and leftist public intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini, which includes his 1975 Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Pasolini’s film is set in an isolated villa in the fascist Republic of Salò, c. 1944, where some fascists have holed-up with a passel of kidnapped young men and women, whom they subject to all manner of systematic debasement, which includes leashing humans like hounds, as well as a heaping helping of coprophagia. If it doesn’t “glorify” torture, Salò focuses on it to the exclusion of most everything else, and it is difficult to imagine it having been made if Pasolini was not on some level—libidinal, intellectual, or a combination of the two—transfixed by torture as sexual parable. But, as with any work of art that deserves the name, the amount of amputation required to squeeze Salò—or ZD30—into readily-identifiable pro- or anti- positions amounts to a fatal vivisection. (Along with the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, Salò was one of the artworks whose prosecution was used to publicly castigate and humiliate the gay community in my hometown of Cincinnati in the mid-1990s, when the Pink Pyramid bookstore was charged with “pandering obscenity” for offering it for rental. I suspect that, while moving ahead with his case, Hamilton County Prosecutor Simon Leis at no point actually sat down in front of Pasolini’s movie with a pan of Jiffy Pop.)\n\nTo return to ZD30: I have written before about my susceptibility to the basic premise behind Bigelow and Boal’s narrative: “The reaction of an organization under attack, moving from disorganization to synchronization.” The two examples that I provided in that column, John Ford’s They Were Expendable (1945) and Otto Preminger’s In Harm’s Way (1965)—both concerned with the immediate aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor—are actually helpful points of reference in looking at ZD30, which begins with an audio-collage of 9/11 911 calls from the burning twin towers. (Another writhing can of worms waiting to be cracked open, that…)\n\nCertainly the co-opting of these doomed voices prepares one for something other than an only-a-movie “thrill ride”—and today’s Washington Post carries a story on “the new reality of reported filmmaking,” centered on ZD30. The comparison to Preminger comes in Bigelow and Boal’s scrupulous maintenance of the appearance of just-the-facts neutrality, in the director’s much-cited statement that “What we were attempting is almost a journalistic approach to film.” While Preminger achieved this through a studied distance—his medium-long, balanced proscenium compositions—Bigelow prefers to maintain the appearance of haphazardness, a flurried, speed-of-life accumulation of information that the viewer is made responsible for filtering and sorting through.\n\nAs for Ford, here is Tom Carson again, writing for GQ, identifying in ZD30’s revenge-lust and concluding note of Pyrrhic victory something of “21st century John Ford: The Searchers gone international.” There is likewise something of Ford in the way that ZD30, in its breadth, finds room for all of the sacrifices and contradictions inherent in sustaining the martial tradition. I am thinking not only of They Were Expendable, but of the end of Fort Apache (1948), which has John Wayne swallowing his distaste for his deceased superior, played by Henry Fonda—a stubbornly-prideful martinet who leads his men into disaster by prioritizing his need to assert his place in the chain-of-command over deference to those with longer experience of his post—so to reinforce the myth of a dead hero that is perhaps necessary to morale, and so not to besmirch the regiment’s good name.\n\nAre such sacrifices worthwhile? Carson’s identification of ZD30’s torture scenes as “tarnishing” is key. There are no inconsequential acts of violence in Bigelow’s film, making it rather like the answer to a recent opinion piece I wrote about the inability of contemporary action movies to restore a sense of moral force, for good or ill, to their action. To return to Mauriac’s description of the former mayor of Weimar leashed outside of Buechenwald—who would deny that there is something beyond the pale in reducing another human to this level, regardless of what they may have done, aided, or abetted? And how many of these same people would argue that the earth isn’t a somewhat better place because Osama bin Laden no longer walks on it? Can either be cleanly separated from the other? There is no easy way to reconcile these ideas, and in its formulation of this tangled, perhaps insoluble moral dilemma, ZD30 does what screen drama should do, demands that we take it out of the theater and into our homes.\n\nOr perhaps not: Only a couple of hours ago, Greenwald, he of the clammy-looking byline headshot, emerged after having finally seen his bête noire, which is tidily filed away under “CIA hagiography, pernicious propaganda.” I scrolled through Greenwald’s blowhard piece until encountering the phrase, “The brave crusaders slay the Evil Villains, and everyone cheers” under the subhed “The ‘art’ excuse,” which doesn’t quite synch with my memory of the film’s final shot; and was further bemused to find the author’s claim in the Comments section that “If it hadn’t been for me rebutting the falsehoods and propaganda of Zero Dark Thirty, nobody would have seen it or talked about it.” I am then forced to report, without having exactly read it, that Greenwald’s latest expulsion of hot air is a long wet fart of fatuously indignant, dunderheaded liberalism from a vamping egomaniac. And, because one bad GG deserves a good one (and speaking of coprophagia!):\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, NY. Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\nTom Hooper does just about everything that a director can do to render his screen adaptation of Les Misérables unwatchable—which is only to be expected.\n\nI had known that there was something very wrong with Hooper’s idea of mise-en-scene ever since watching his HBO miniseries John Adams, in which the cinematographer just kept doing the strangest things—peeking through the slats of a fence in surreptitious handheld mode in one scene, impersonating Dutch Golden Age painting in another—for no discernible reason. It must be admitted that Hooper’s John Adams does contain the best staging of the Second Continental Congress that has ever been set to film, although that’s largely because, due to our national cinema’s inexplicable aversion to dramatizing any but a few patches of our own history, the nearest competition is Peter H. Hunt’s 1776, the rare movie that, when the teacher popped it in the VCR in junior high history class, made you actually pray for lessons to resume. Of Hopper’s The King’s Speech, all that can be said is that it is the most deliberately hideous-looking film since I Am Sam, the sort of thing that you flip on and immediately think, “Oh, it can’t possibly all look like that.”\n\nAll of Hooper’s Les Mis looks like that—smeared in a cloacal sludge, that is. Beyond requiring his performers to look like they’ve rolled around in an unmucked horse stall between takes, Hooper’s big inspiration is to affix a hovering handheld camera to them during the musical numbers, which were sung and recorded live, in tune to orchestrations piped in through hidden earpieces. The final result is meant to reach us, the viewers, with a bare minimum of interference from the editing and recording booth, and hopefully maximizing intimacy and in-the-moment, raw emotion. All of this is in keeping with the equation of inarticulate-yet-obtrusive camerawork with “realism,” which has steadily taken hold of movies since—I don’t know, Woody Allen’s Husbands and Wives? The Blair Witch Project?\n\nThe latter is actually a good point of reference for Hooper’s Les Mis. In the one scene where Hooper’s valuation of immediacy above all else actually pays off, when Anne Hathaway’s destitute, broken Fantine belts “I Dreamed a Dream” into the camera (which at several points she seems about to swallow), doesn’t her snot-slicked, hunted face remind you a bit of the hyperventilating Heather Donahue in Blair Witch?\n\nI should add that I loved Hathaway’s “I Dreamed a Dream,” almost as much as I disliked the other two-and-a-half-hours of Hooper’s Les Mis, which even manages to fizzle out its tried-and-true torch song, Éponine’s “On My Own.” And talking of torch songs, if you have ever wondered who the progenitor of the genre is, I am very happy to tell you: Here is Helen Morgan, singing “Bill,” in James Whale’s 1936 film of Show Boat, one of the greatest triumphs of Carl Laemmle, Jr.’s stint as head of production at Universal Studios.\n\nWhale’s film is as often remembered for its other great number, Paul Robeson’s capacious and profound rendition of “Ol’ Man River,” which is indeed extraordinary. But while many performers have made “Ol’ Man River” their own—I am fond of this tweaked Judy Garland rendition, as well as of Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’ apoplectic take—I can’t imagine anyone else putting as definitive a stamp onto “Bill” as Helen Morgan did. It reduces me to a quivering puddle every single time that I watch it, and I watch it often.\n\nA little bit of history is in order. Whale’s film is the second adaptation of the watershed 1927 stage production, with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics and book by Oscar Hammerstein II. Kern and Hammerstein’s “Show Boat” was adapted from a novel by Edna Ferber, which recounted a half century of life on a Mississippi river show boat. “Bill,” however, was a cutting-room floor leftover from 1917’s “Oh, Lady! Lady!!”—written by Kern and P.G. Wodehouse—trotted out again only when Kern believed he’d found the right singer for it. Which would turn out to be Ms. Morgan, who originated the part of “Show Boat”’s Julie La Verne, the Cotton Blossom headliner who is exiled to land when her mixed-race origins are discovered.\n\nHelen Morgan was born Helen Riggins in 1900, a farmer’s daughter in Danville, Illinois. After her father’s death, Morgan had a hardscrabble upbringing divided between Danville and Toronto. She quit school in 8th grade and went to work early, popping up behind the counter at the Marshall Field’s Loop Store in Chicago before heading on to Montreal to work as a model, where she was crowned Miss Mount Royal. So far, so Dreiser-esque! That Morgan was once a formidable beauty is not always evident from her screen appearances, for she had a ruinous drinking problem. It has been said that her signature singing pose—draped across the top of a piano a la Michelle Pfeiffer in The Fabulous Baker Boys—was adopted as a precaution against the spins.\n\nMoving on to New York, Morgan made the chorus of Flo Ziegfeld’s “Sally” in 1923, appeared in “George White’s Scandals of 1926,” and finally made her impression felt in a 1926 production of “Americana” singing a song called, I swear to God, “Nobody Wants Me.” She was cast in the Broadway production of “Show Boat” after Kern scouted her out, and her tremulous, tear-suffused soprano delivery quickly made her a star, along with another quality singled out by Claudia Cassidy: “She had in her voice the note of heartbreak—authentic heartbreak, worth its weight in theater gold.” In the Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, Morgan’s masochistic persona is identified as that of “a romantic underdog, a woman slavishly devoted to her man, no matter how he mistreats her.”\n\nIn the days when Texas Guinan was the queen of New York City nightlife, Morgan lent her imprimatur to several NYC nightclubs, variously named Chez Helen Morgan, Helen Morgan’s 54th Street Club, House of Morgan, and Helen M’s Summer Home. (One, located on 134 W 52nd, was closed by Prohibition agents.) This line gave her ample opportunity to mix with underworld types, and consequently to seek out fresh opportunities for emotional abuse. Yet playing the loyal, kicked puppy was not Morgan’s sole hobby. She was also an avid collector of first editions and tropical fish—a recognized ichthyologist, in fact. In a Pittsburgh Press item dated March 17, 1933, Ms. Morgan is quoted as saying “About the only things worth getting excited about are children playing in the sun and a bottle with three stars on the label and the fish in the sea.” The article goes on to describe the 22 tanks in the fish room at the Central Park apartment of “the lady of the drowsy eyes and the startled hair.” The Schenectedy Gazette of August 14, 1934 adds to our knowledge the fact that “Her favorite pets are ‘Peter’ and ‘Emmie’, a pair of South American mouth-breathing fish.”\n\nBut enough of Morgan’s life; let us hear some more of the art…\n\nMorgan’s collaboration with Kern and Hammerstein continued on stage with 1929’s Gay ‘90s-set “Sweet Adeline,” whose plot was partially inspired by tales of Morgan’s experiences as a singing waitress in a beer garden. Morgan created the title role, and introduced the wrenching “Why Was I Born?” that included lachrymose lyrics such as: “Why do I try/ To draw you near me?/ Why do I cry?/ You never hear me.” Also in “Sweet Adeline,” Morgan’s piteous plaint clings at your heels while you try to make it to the door in “Don’t Ever Leave Me.”\n\nThe movies came calling soon after Broadway success, and Morgan’s second significant film role—after the half-talkie Show Boat of 1929—was her best, starring as burlesque star Kitty Darling in Rouben Mamoulian’s Applause (1929). To the film’s plot, which has Kitty sending her daughter away to a convent school, an extra layer of pathos is added with knowledge that Morgan had herself given a daughter up for adoption in 1926. Morgan again sounds the note of doormat self-sacrifice with “What Wouldn’t I Do For That Man?”—original to Applause, but taken here from 1930’s Glorifying the American Girl (ha ha). Next was Helen getting all barrelhouse to sing “It Can’t Go On Like This” in Paramount’s Roadhouse Nights (1930), with ample cutaways to a hamming Jimmy “Schnozzola” Durante, in his film debut.\n\nMorgan performs “Give Me a Heart to Sing To” in a 1934 Republic Production of Frankie and Johnny, in which she played the part of Frankie, a rare “romantic” lead. I am utilizing scare quotes because the film’s source is the American songbook standard that deals in two-timing and homicide. Harkening back to Morgan’s signature role, the setting is a St. Louis river boat.\n\nOn to Paramount’s You Belong to Me (1934) and “When He Comes Home to Me”—a number that, with lyrics like “Maybe he’s not the most marvelous man/ But I know he’s doing the best that he can,” obviously owes just about everything to “Bill.” Little David Holt, in the audience, announces “Look at the way she uses her hands!” and he’s right: Morgan often looks like she’s mangling some invisible object, or perhaps playing “He loves me, he loves me not” with an imaginary daisy.\n\nHelen veered into south-of-the-border intrigue with “Song of a Dreamer,” from Fox’s Marie Galant (1934). “Serves Me Right For Treating You Wrong,” from the same film, is notable as a rare example of Morgan singing from the perspective of the one who’s done the screwing, not the one who’s been screwed over.\n\nIn this anguished performance of “The Little Things You Used to Do,” from Warners’ Go Into Your Dance (1935), Morgan pines for the return of the gormless slob she adores, and all the multifold delights that he brought with him: “Those ashes on the floor/ The way you used to slam the door” etc.\n\nJulie La Verne had made Morgan a star, but by the time Universal was preparing a new Show Boat in ’36, her growing reputation as a dipso had made her practically unemployable. Whale went to bat for Morgan, and she got the part, though only after signing what Whale biographer James Curtis calls a “humiliating arrangement”: “It not only called for her to forfeit the part of Julie should she prove unreliable, but also required her to stand the cost of whomever was hired to replace her in the show.” Reports of Morgan’s on-set drinking range from “constant” to “sporadic,” but whatever the case, she got off her “Bill,” and posterity is thankful. Whale’s Show Boat was her last film.\n\nScarcely seven years after exhaling brandy-scented breath onto reporters while discussing her favorite fish, five after Show Boat, Helen Morgan was in Chicago preparing to perform in “George White’s Scandals of 1942″ when she was hospitalized and died of cirrhosis of the liver, aged 41, her insides eaten out by a decade of God-only-knows-what sort of paint-peeling bathtub gin. (Scott Fitzgerald, another quintessential Jazz Age character from out of the lonesome Midwest, had gone less than a year prior.) Today Helen Morgan rests in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cook County, Illinois, and would almost certainly appreciate a visit.\n\nMorgan’s irresistibly pathetic biography was exhumed for a 1957 production of CBS’ Playhouse 90, The Helen Morgan Story, directed by George Roy Hill and starring Polly Bergen in the title role (Some of the broadcast is visible here, while a platter of Ms. Bergen’s interpretations from the Morgan songbook can be listened to here). This was adapted into a Michael Curtiz-directed feature film of the same year, in which singer Ann Blyth starred as Morgan, inexplicably dubbed by Gogi Grant. (Warners had wanted A Star is Born star Judy Garland to return—file this under Missed Opportunities.)\n\nAll of this is, however, only trivia. If you want the real Helen Morgan Story, you only need to re-watch “Bill.”\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications. He lives in Brooklyn, NY. Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\nYou find yourself doing a lot of things over the holidays and break—if you are lucky enough to have a holiday break—that you might otherwise not.\n\nOne example is socially drinking for thirty consecutive days. Another is idle listmaking; I got to exchanging “If You Haven’t Seen It, It’s New To You!™” top-old-films-for-the-year lists with a couple of friends, and I thought my results might just as well be shared:\n\nBell, Book and Candle (1958, Richard Quine)\n\nThe Big Trail (1930, Raoul Walsh)\n\nThe Cavern (1964, Edgar Ulmer)\n\nThe Funhouse (1981, Tobe Hooper)\n\nThe Italian Connection (1972, Fernando di Leo)\n\nMake Way for Tomorrow (1937, Leo McCarey)\n\nDes Morts (1979, Jean-Pol Ferbus, Dominique Garny, Thierry Zeno)\n\nThe Other (1972, Robert Mulligan)\n\nNothing But a Man (1964, Michael Roemer)\n\nRemorques (1941, Jean Gremillon)\n\nThey Made Me a Fugitive (1947, Alberto Cavalcanti)\n\nThe Tiger of Eschnapur (1959, Fritz Lang)\n\nTwilight’s Last Gleaming/ Ulzana’s Raid (1977/ 1972, Robert Aldrich) (Talking of aging Burt Lancaster, I also liked Visconti’s Conversation Piece of 1974 a helluva a lot.)\n\nWake in Fright (1971, Ted Kotcheff)\n\nThe Window (1949, Ted Tetzlaff)\n\nOne can do a good deal of reading up on the burning issues of the day, as well. Over the preceding weeks, many a pundit and most everyone in my social networking groupthink feed made indignant hay from NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre’s comments about the shootings in Newtown, CT—and, yes, Right On. I am, however, always a little suspicious of any approach to a social problem that seeks to shunt full burden for responsibility onto the Other’s rights and pleasures (i.e. Automatic weapons), without any attendant examination of one’s own cherished rights and pleasures—or those one defends from the bugbear of censorship. (i.e. Splatterhouse for TurboGrafx-16, Natural Born Killers, and whatever other weirdly Clinton-era pop ephemera LaPierre excavated.) I have, therefore, been mulling over a number of articles with titles like “How to Change Pop Culture’s Reliance on Violence,” without landing upon any workable solution—save perhaps my own.\n\nIn Anthony Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange, and Stanley Kubrick’s film of the same title, a process called The Ludovico Technique, entailing of an overdose of ultraviolent and pornographic imagery, is applied to sociopathic teenager Alex in order to make the chastened subject ill at the very thought of transgression. I suspect that there is a fallacy in this conceit; that rather than making the subject nauseous at the sight of the red, red kroovy, the actual application of the Ludovico Technique would result instead in making them terribly bored with it. I believe this to be so because, in my largely unsupervised youth, I submitted myself to a form of the Ludovico Technique. As a tender stripling of ten I had watched not only Clockwork Orange, but “Eightball” being blasted to pieces in slow-motion by sniper fire in Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket. As an adolescent I was listening to NWA’s “Just Don’t Bite It” and leafing through unbelievably seedy three-pack porno slicks (Genesis, anyone?) at John Shimkoviak’s house. As a teenager I was ingesting every Shockumentary on the market, including the no-redeeming-social-or-artistic-value Traces of Death series, emceed by a sardonic narrator called Brain Damage who contributed witless commentary to documentary images of human beings being rudely butted off of this mortal coil. (i.e. “Looks like he caught the Express!” as a father of four is pasted by an Amtrak.)\n\nThe end result? When watching dull, thrill-kill, for-its-own-sake violence today, the desire for a nap immediately settles over this subject. The moment that James Brolin clipped off a thug’s hand through an elevator gate in Gangster Squad, which I recently took in at a press screening, my unaddressed mind felt free to drift into the cosmos. A modest proposal, then, based on this admittedly limited control group: Officially devote a period of the school day—I am thinking English, which today mostly has the effect of putting off anyone who has an aptitude for it—to Ludovico Technique! Just you watch those teenaged boys swarm to their Renoir retros and classical music youth associations!\n\nTalking of violent pastimes: With idle holiday days on hand, one turns to entertainments that one might not otherwise be drawn to. I paid good money to enter Paul Brown Stadium for a game in which a (partially backup) Cincinnati Bengals team best a (mostly backup) Baltimore Ravens team, 23-17, a match with almost no playoff consequences whatsoever. This enabled me to view what was likely the last and nearly the first impressive play of Bruce Gradkowski’s NFL career, a 44-yarder to Brandon Tate, as well as to marvel at the PBS PA announcer’s almost pathological obsession with the phrase “stacked up,” and to note with sadness that the LED screen pregame-hype video that had been in place since 2000 has been updated with a new, marginally less chintzy version. It is fascinating, in strolling around PBS, to note the many little signs of Bengals owner Mike Brown’s legendary stinginess—in contrast, say, to the famous largesse of Jerry Jones’ stately pleasure dome in Arlington. So that one won’t miss a moment of on-field action, the PBS concession areas are equipped with TVs, as is standard—but they’re tube televisions, about 32”s. In fact, I think they may be the same model that my local sports bar—the one with imitation wood paneling and $6.00 buckets-of-Bud and a troglodytic woman with a squint installed at the end of the bar—threw out three seasons ago.\n\nI also saw some movies that I might not, in the ordinary run of things, have seen. I saw Jack Reacher—that rare film whose title no amount of tampering could make sound any more like gay porn—at the AMC Newport on the Levee 20 in Northern Kentucky, where the “MacGuffin’s” pub in the lobby is slated to open next week. I have hardly found a word that I disagree with in any of the savage write-ups of Jack Reacher that I have encountered, and yet I think very little that I saw in 2012 will stay with me like the lone scene shared by Tom Cruise and screen nemesis Werner Herzog, two extraordinarily tenacious careerists from very different sectors of the film world. It should also be noted that Reacher contains the year’s second-best establishing shot of a fiftysomething male star waking up in a room next to a young woman’s stunning be-thonged ass, the best of course being Denzel’s in Flight. I almost hope this shot keeps recurring until it becomes a Hollywood inside joke, like the Wilhelm scream, or… well, like Hollywood itself!\n\nI did see a foreign film as well—or the nearest variant that plays the Midwest, New Zealand’s The Hobbit. Although I’d variously enjoyed each installment of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, I supposed I had had enough. I expressly did not intend to see The Hobbit. I think it was something about the swaggering laziness of the trading cards subway adverts, consisting of nothing but pictures of the dwarvish dramatis personae, as if to say: “We don’t even need to try. You know you’re going to see it.”\n\nThey were right, goddamn it, and I’ve no regrets. I was suitably gobsmacked by those ethereal Edward Burne-Jones elves upon returning to Rivendell. I was moved by the covetous pathos of Gollum, Andy Serkis’s finest performance since Planet of the Apes. (“Is he just really good at crouching?” a friend asked me as we were discussing Serkis’s cornering the market on CG performance.) I found, in The Hobbit, a quest film that bore its comparable runtime considerably better than Django Unchained and, in Tolkien’s Middle Earth, a considerably more seductive—and certainly better-researched—immersive environment than Tarantino’s Deep South. Both Tolkien and Tarantino, as I’m sure has been pointed out already, draw from the mythological wellspring of the German Nibelungenlied, although Tolkien’s 1938 response to a German publisher, which made the rounds yesterday on the anniversary of the author’s birth, would alone be enough to mark him a more courageous figure than the mood-faced peddler of provocation—if indeed it was posted.\n\nWatching The Hobbit, I thought back to 2001 when Fellowship of the Ring, the first of Jackson’s Ring films, came out, and to the professor of the medieval literature class that I was then taking, Dr. Thomas Limouze, who would recite Piers Plowman and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight to us in Old English. He complained that Fellowship had stripped Tolkien’s story of its restive, its pastoral, and its idyllic moments, leaving only the hard spine of action. I wondered if the niggling, minutiae-obsessed The Hobbit was the sort of Tolkien movie that Dr. Limouze, a medievalist like Tolkien, had hoped for; certainly it doesn’t seem to be the sort of movie that many a film critic wanted, even as its trotted-out technology has promoted much conversation. In the NY Review of Books, for example, J. Hoberman found himself “wondering what percentage of CGI is necessary for a movie to be considered graphic rather than photographic,” while referencing Ralph Bakshi’s rotoscoped Lord of the Rings of 1978, a film that was so dear to me as a young man, reading Dragonlance paperbacks faster than Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman could write them. In fact, to this day I cannot watch the following—shades of that Full Metal Jacket sniper scene—without a terrific shudder of emotion:\n\nFor a goodly portion of The Hobbit’s runtime, it all came back in an atavistic geyser—the boyish Anglophilia and the obsession with ancient martial tradition and Sir Thomas Mallory and all manner of smiting and cleaving in twain. Not an argument for great art, perhaps, but one for mighty entertainment. And it is nice to know that the economy of New Zealand is secure for another year. Which brings us, I believe, to our first outro jam of 2013…\n\nEvery month or so for the past year and some change, Cristina Cacioppo, programmer at 92YTribeca has been good enough to locate and screen a 35mm film print of a title determined by myself and my fellow guest programmer, Film Comment’s Nic Rapold, for a little shindig that goes by the name ‘Overdue.’\n\nDuring our tenure as guest programmers, the successes—a sold-out black-clad crowd for The Cure in Orange, a double-bill of director Larry Yust’s features that seemed to truly wow all present—have just about equaled the disappointments—the print of Andre de Toth’s Play Dirty that had mellowed to the color of Pepto Bismol, the Joe Don Baker mini-retro that New York City was apparently not crying out for, the screening of James Gunn’s Squirm attended by exactly no-one, including the hosts. For whatever reason, Cristina has kept inviting us back—this despite her having recently called me “unsavory” while in her cups at a holiday party.\n\nI am not sure what she meant by this, though I think it was meant affectionately. Possibly it has something to do with my having the fashion sense of a giallo strangler, or my having been fascinated at an impressionable age by John Larroquette’s Dan Fielding on Night Court, or my championing of movies like the highly unsavory James Woods vehicle Cop (1988), which we screened last night to a scanty but responsive audience.\n\nCop’s writer-director, James B. Harris, extracted the film’s story from the larger framework of James B. Ellroy’s 1984 novel “Blood on the Moon.” Altogether there have been a dozen Ellroy adaptations, most notably Curtis Hanson’s L.A. Confidential and Brian De Palma’s Black Dahlia, but Cop was the first.\n\nI’d first heard of Cop from a friend in France. Bertrand Tavernier and Pierre Rissient hold the film in high regard, and for all I know it may be universally acknowledged as a masterpiece over there. (In Emmanuel Bordieu’s 2006 Les amitiés maléfiques, it’s a fun detail that Thibault Vinçon’s know-it-all intellectual bully is an Ellroy expert.) In fact, if I’d had my druthers, yesterday’s screening would’ve been a double-bill with Maurice Pialat’s Police (1985), another essential ‘80s cop pic which had audiences gasping when a street hood spat square in the face of Sophie Marceau, La Boum’s teen queen—imagine a similar desecration of Molly Ringwald! (Or find yourself a copy of Godard’s King Lear, also recently at 92YTribeca.)\n\nI was further intrigued on the subject of Harris by fellow SundanceNOW columnist Michael Atkinson’s definitive essay on his sporadic-but-pungent career, “Genuine B Noir: James B. Harris,” in which he called Cop the director’s “best and nastiest.” The piece is included Mr. Atkinson’s book Ghosts in the Machine: Speculating on the Dark Heart of Pulp Cinema, which you really should own if you do not already.\n\nThe films that he directed aside, Harris’s place in film history is secure thanks to an early association with another auteur. Fresh out of the Army, Harris was in the business of licensing films to TV broadcasters, in which capacity he was approached by an acquaintance, Stanley Kubrick, then attempting to get a few bucks for his Fear & Desire (which was recently released on Blu-ray by Kino International). This led to a professional producer-director partnership, Harris-Kubrick, with Harris going on to produce The Killing (whose source novel, Lionel White’s Clean Break, he had picked out and acquired the rights to), Paths of Glory, and Lolita, before embarking on a filmmaking career of his own beginning with the 1965 nuclear submarine picture The Bedford Incident. From the get-go, there was a queer dialogue between Harris’s films and Kubrick’s; as Atkinson notes, Harris’s debut “showed the strain of having to stand shivering in the shadow cast by Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove.” The influence, however, was not one-sided: you could make quite the double-feature of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut and Harris’s second film, 1973’s Some Call it Loving (also variously titled Sleeping Beauty and The Castle), which those of you in New York may see as part of BAM’s Richard Pryor retrospective on February 13th.\n\nAs for the rest of Harris’s career as writer-director, the Jim Thompson-penned The Killing, and mid-century noir in general, are pertinent points of reference. With 1982’s Fast-Walking, starring Woods as prison guard “Fast-Walking” Miniver, Harris entered the nearest thing to a period of steady work in his directing career, though he’s yet to helm a single, solitary hit. Fast-Walking was followed by Cop and, in 1993, Boiling Point, with Dennis Hopper and Wesley Snipes, who, as I never tire of reminding anyone who will listen, was once a very exciting leading man. Although he had an executive producer credit on Black Dahlia, Boiling Point was Harris’s last film as a director. He will be 85 years old this year, and is quite sharp in a seemingly-new interview recorded for Criterion’s 2011 DVD release of The Killing. James B. Harris Productions still keeps an office in Beverly Hills, and they will return your phone calls.\n\nBack to Cop: Woods, also one of the films’s producers, stars as Sgt. Lloyd Hopkins, a LAPD homicide detective who, investigating the brutal murder of a woman, begins to suspect that it’s the work of a serial killer who’s been plying his trade for the last fifteen years or so. Ellroy made a trilogy of books with the Hopkins character, and there is some scuttlebutt that Harris and Woods intended to make further Hopkins films, though Cop’s “disappointing” box-office put an end to any such notion.\n\nThe slim box-office was almost certainly attributable to the outright curled-lip nastiness, the unmitigated horndog skeeviness, with which Woods plays the lead. A lot of people don’t care for Woods the man, for he is a mouthy right-winger in an industry that leans left, but as an actor this seeming indifference to being liked, this reluctance to pump the audience for sympathy, is a rare gift. Even more rare is finding a director, like Harris, willing to take full advantage of it. It was reconfirmed for me just how rare this is only this week: In anticipation of the upcoming Jason Statham Parker film, I re-viewed previous movies adapted from Donald Westlake/Richard Stark’s novels about his Parker character, written as a pitiless man-machine, seeing in the process how so many interpretations (Jim Brown, Mel Gibson, Peter Coyote) insisted on garlanding Parker with little sprigs of humanity.\n\nThe sole humanizing agent in Hopkins’s life is his little daughter, with whom Woods appears in exactly one scene, telling her “bedtime stories” ripped from his case histories. When Hopkins’s wife upbraids him, he rebuts that he’s only preparing the girl for the world, that by protecting her from fairy tales he is protecting her from:\n\n“Expectations, the greatest woman killer of all-time, a terminal disease that starts way back when they’re all just little girls, when they’re being fed all the bullshit about being entitled to happiness like it’s a birthright. That’s what you don’t understand—when to stop perpetrating the myths that ruin their lives. Innocence kills, Jen. Believe me, it kills. I see it every fucking day of my life.”\n\nI suspect I may have smirked a little the first time I watched this domestic squabble, for the overheated exchange is rather close to the cop-opera parody of Chris Elliott’s chef d’oeuvre, Action Family. What has struck me in subsequent viewings, however, is the very real nervous energy that Woods trembles with, the eagerness with which he pounces for the phone as soon as his wife storms out of the bedroom, jumping at any opportunity for some action, any excuse to get out of the house. (On the line is the late Charles Durning, very good as Hopkins’ sometimes-partner Dutch.)\n\nThere is a “Dear John” waiting for Lloyd when he gets back to the office—exit wife and daughter—which frees him up to pursue his woman-killer, as well as to sport-fuck women tangentially involved in his police work. “Everyone knows you have a wild hair up your ass about murdered women” says Hopkins’s Born Again Captain—Raymond J. Barry in a self-contained twist on the hothead cliche—and though this is evidently true, for Hopkins does have a vigilantly protective attitude towards women, it is not at all clear that he likes them very much. It’s as though they’re forever letting him down with their penchant for getting butchered. (Those who know anything of Ellroy’s personal history know that Hopkins’s complex is also the author’s, referent to the central formative event of his life, his mother’s unsolved murder in 1958.)\n\nA crime-scene clue—a misplaced book of feminist poetry called, I believe, The Angry Womb, whose authoress has the “Har har” surname Van Dyke—leads Hopkins to canvassing feminist bookstores for leads. Hopkins is met—better to say intercepted—at the door of one such store called Feminist Bibliophile by the proprietress, Kathleen McCarthy, played by Lesley Ann Warren, smoking seriously and standoffish in black.\n\nThe centerpiece of the movie, in terms of performance and densely layered characterization, begins right here. When Ms. McCarthy demurs and allows Sgt. Hopkins to come in, the man who was introduced negotiating the precinct floor like he could do it with his eyes closed, who has a practiced old-hand patter with escorts, is for the first time thrown off-balance, shy and awkward in this strange environment surrounded by what might as well be foreign-language literature. (A detail one only catches in 35mm—a copy of Liv Ullmann’s Changing on display in the background.) He is also clearly impressed by the forbidding front that McCarthy puts up—she’s the one woman strong and disillusioned enough to meet his standard. (“Why can’t they fucking fly like us?” Hopkins bemoans of the weaker sex earlier, a line that is exceedingly enjoyable to quote.)\n\nHopkins, then, seems genuinely surprised when McCarthy accepts his meek invitation for a cup of coffee. When he brings her to a department party as his date, he is gallant and courteous and eager to please. As their evening together carries on into dinner, and as Ms. McCarthy gives way to Kathleen, she relaxes enough to begin emotionally denuding herself, telling Hopkins the story of her life, including a traumatic incident in high school where she was raped by two boys in the bathroom and subsequently abandoned by her clique of would-be poetesses. Kathleen then gives way to the Kathy of those days, and as she exposes her hidden vulnerability, the no-longer-cowed Hopkins steeples his fingers, attempting to muster appropriately sympathetic reactions, to keep up his flagging interest by treating the date like a soft interrogation. Back at the Feminist Bibliophile, Kathleen mentions a secret admirer who has been sending her doggerel poetry and dried flowers for a decade or more, and a supercilious smirk sneaks into Hopkins’s expression. He grows bored and restless, picking lint from the sofa, only snapping back to attention when Kathleen’s eyes land on him, finally perking up again when it seems like he’s actually going to get laid. And when Kathleen excuses herself to take a pre-coital shower, he exhales a long pent-up, eye-rolling, beleaguered “Jeeeeeee-sus Christ!” Every beat, every reaction shot, every brazenly off-putting actorly decision here is worked through to a level one rarely encounters in the best screen drama, not to speak of genre movies.\n\n“Is this a feminist movie?” a friend asked as I was chumming the waters of social media in hopes of getting asses in the seats for Cop. The short answer is “Errrm… ,” but I embellished this, stating that it was “better to say it takes place in the zone where hardline feminism and frothing misogyny overlap, like Fascism and Communism in the Schlesinger-Poole model.” Strange bedfellows—or perhaps not. The name of Warren’s character, Kathleen McCarthy, is, I believe, a nod to Catherine MacKinnon, the prosecutorial arm of militant feminist Andrea Dworkin’s anti-pornography crusade in the 1980’s, which linked arms with religious conservatives and Ronald Reagan’s Meese Commission. Thrillers, particularly those of Brian de Palma, were also popular targets, which is somewhat ironic, as these were the only mainstream movies actually willing to engage with the rhetoric of Take Back the Night—see for example Clint Eastwood’s Sudden Impact and Tightrope.\n\nAt the heart of Cop is a strange triangle indeed—between Sgt. Hopkins, Ms. McCarthy, and her fawning secret admirer, the poetaster who has been sending her flowers, not coincidentally, for just as long as Hopkins’ serial killer has been at work. In a neat piece of moral confusion, the villain of the piece is revealed as this sweet wallflower who, while carrying a torch for “Kathy” since high school, has been venting his repressed sexual aggression on other women. This leaves the gross and loutish Hopkins, who is at least honest about his venal appetites, to play the unlikely role of the white knight—chalk one up for the unsavory guys! (It’s also a time-tested piece of rhetorical self-justification by Ellroy, insisting that anyone who doesn’t wear their sleaziness on their sleeve must necessarily be a hypocrite.)\n\nTalking of which, among this week’s essential reading is Tom McCormack’s dissection of the thinly-veiled nastiness of the “Nice Guys of OKCupid,” which concludes with a text, “Pop-Punk Pick-Up Line,” which was previously unknown to me:\n\nThis certainly works for the progenitors of the genre, The Descendants, who expressed precisely this sentiment in songs like “Hope,” while, in “Marriage,” frontman Milo Aukerman sang the words every woman longs to hear: “I don’t want to have sex with you/ I want to be your friend.” But I have loved pop-punk for my entire post-adolescent life, and if there is any single credo that I live by, it is never to revise any aesthetic opinions determined at the wise age of 15, so I will counterpoint the “Pick-Up Line” with J. Church, expressing a sentiment appropriate to the deeply cynical Cop: “You should’ve known that a sensitive guy lives a lie, you can’t look him in the eye.”\n\n(R.I.P.

Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\nEvery so often I will run into an old acquaintance, or get a random text message, and have to field the question “Are you still in New York?” There is often a hint of incredulity to this, while that “still” suggests that the situation is something necessarily finite, something no sane person would keep up indefinitely.\n\nYes, in fact, I am still in New York City. As of February of 2013, I will have still been in New York for ten years.\n\nIt is—has anyone noticed this before?—a tough town, particularly in wintertime. I recall someone saying that everyone should live in New York, but not so long that they go hard, and everyone should live in California, but not so long that they go soft. (The latter point is supported by this much-circulated video for Los Angeles-based Wilderness Collective).\n\nWhen I was a kid, we’d play a game in which we’d get the playground carousel up to rotating at top speed, then hang off the edges of it, holding on for dear life. While a couple kids off to the side kept the carousel rotating apace, the riders would one by one lose their grip or go nauseous and tumble off into the rubber mulch. Whoever was left would have “won.” I have taken to relating this to New York City, which has shed so many of the people I’ve met herein who now ask me “Are you still in New York?”\n\nMy laughably few skills are monetizable in New York, if barely so, so here is where I still live. I spend a great deal of time these days in the apartment in North Brooklyn that I moved into six years ago, which I can neither afford nor afford to get rid of, and go into Manhattan only as often as business or, increasingly rarely, pleasure demands it.\n\nOver the last weekend, I was tempted in. A friend who was in Central Park sent me pictures he’d taken of the Park under a light snowfall, including the gingerbread loggia of the Dairy, along with the comment “Getting real Portrait of Jennie up in here.” The reference is to the David O. Selznick-produced William Dieterle film of 1948, based on a 1940 novel by Robert Natham, starring Selznick’s wife-to-be, Jennifer Jones, and Joseph Cotten. Cotten plays a painter named Eben Adams, who is one of many on the skids in New York City, 1934. Broke and hungry, wandering a winter-kissed Central Park, Adams meets a young girl named Jennie Appleton, played by Jones. At first Adams takes it as an imaginative child’s fancy when she tells him that she is visiting while her acrobat parents do an aerialist act at Hammerstein’s Hippodrome, for he knows the Hippodrome was torn down years ago. The next time they meet, however, the girl has almost overnight become a young woman, and Adams comes to understand that Jennie, who becomes his muse and his model and his love, is a figure somehow unstuck from time.\n\nPortrait of Jennie is generally remembered as one of the most lush and romantic films about New York City ever made, and not without reason. Putting its prestige-picture foot forward, it begins with epigrams from Keats and Euripedes, Debussy’s La Mer (conducted by Dimitri Tiompkin), and a ravishing God’s eye view of Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge, with rays of heavenly benediction shining down upon them. One moment in the film that has always particularly stuck with me, however, belongs to a homely subplot quite far away from such supernal splendors, a subplot that even the film’s greatest enthusiasts tend to get impatient with. Adams, in exchange for free corned beef-and-cabbage, takes a commission to paint a mural of Irish independence leader Mick Collins over the bar at a local pub, Moore’s Alhambra. During the mural’s big unveiling celebration, however, Adams doesn’t even take a cursory glance back at his handiwork. Cotton, a closely guarded actor, overplays nothing, but one can clearly discern in his tightened expression the self-disgust of a man who knows he’s doing work well below his talents just to survive. This also happens to be the look that Cotten wore through most of the latter part of his career—see for reference Sergio Corbucci’s 1966 Spaghetti Western The Hellbenders.\n\nThe film ends with another unveiling, a Technicolor blast in a mostly black-and-white, sometimes-tinted film, the fruits of Eben Adams’ labor, the offspring of his doomed out-of-time affair, the painting The Portrait of Jennie. It hangs in the Met where it is seen being admired by a group of schoolgirls, including an uncredited future-First Lady Nancy Davis, who make inane comments about it. There it will hang forever, a monument to love, as one supposes Selznick imagined The Portrait of Jennie—with accompanying (unused) title song by Nat King Cole—would remain a monument to his love for the film’s starlet. The actor Robert Walker, best remembered as Bruno from Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train and Jones’ first husband, undoubtedly watched the whole thing in the grips of ulcerous rage. He and his then-wife had left New York City together for Hollywood, where he was contracted to MGM and she to Selznick, who was already fitting Walker with the horns of a cuckold. Walker never thereafter recovered his mental equilibrium, and died in 1951, when the intravenous administration of a sedative clashed with his typically astronomical blood-alcohol level. He was 32, and probably regretted ever leaving New York and the cozy Long Island home he’d once shared with the girl then-named Phyllis Walker and their two sons.\n\nThe Portrait of Jennie canvas, which would hang in the Selznick-Jones estate after their marriage, was painted by Robert Brackman, a teacher at the Art Student’s League and, in the words of some who would know better than I, “a master of 20th century American Realism.” Be that as it may, The Portrait of Jennie is not his best work. In fact, paintings made expressly to appear in Hollywood movies are almost always lousy*—I adore An American in Paris as much as anyone but, judging from the canvases he’s hawking, Gene Kelly’s starving artist Jerry Mulligan deserves to starve.\n\nThe great exceptions to this above rule are the stark, haunted pieces of outsider art turned out by Edward G. Robinson’s henpecked Sunday painter Christopher Cross in the bathroom of his Greenwich Village walkup in Fritz Lang’s 1945 Scarlet Street. These paintings, about a dozen of which appear in the movie, were the work of John Decker, son of a Prussian Guards colonel who abandoned his child in London, where the orphaned Decker took up stage scenery, and studied painting under Walter Sickert. Decker could work fluently in a number of idioms, and was allegedly a successful forger of Old Masters—there has been some scuttlebutt as to if the Rembrandt “Head of Christ” at Harvard’s Fogg Gallery was the same that Gene Fowler, in his autobiography, recalled Decker pawning off on the character actor Thomas Mitchell. Decker was the subject of a biography by Stephen Jordan, Bohemian Rogue, which I have not read, and figures centrally in Gregory William Mank, Charles Heard, and Bill Nelson’s Hollywood’s Hellfire Club, which I have, and highly recommend for its depiction of the mutually-assured self-destruction by the group of carousing nihilists who met at Decker’s tudor lodge in Brentwood. Their number included Fowler, W.C. Fields, John Barrymore, Errol Flynn, and Sadakichi Hartmann, a German-Japanese aesthete who had known Walt Whitman in Camden. Loafing and inviting their souls in bibulous debauches, this group was collectively christened The Bundy Drive Boys, and almost all of them were dead of drink well ahead of Walker.\n\nTo return to Scarlet Street: The canvas that particularly sticks with me depicts a street scene over which the metal gridwork of an elevated train line—presumably the Sixth Avenue el—creates a proscenium stage. The el’s two pair of stanchions are matched to two drooping streetlamps that cast triangular pools of light. One shines on a lone female figure, waiting on the cobblestone street without apparent purpose—possibly a streetwalker, like Joan Bennett’s alluring and terrible Kitty in the film. The other highlights a section of an enormous snake’s body, which is wound through the el’s track trellis and around the stanchion. Cross, by way of Decker, seems to be thinking of Eve and the Serpent; whatever the case, here is an image that comes far closer to the spirit of urban desolation than Brackman’s portrait does to romantic transport. I wonder where these Scarlet Street pictures are today? Robinson, the first to buy from Frida Kahlo, was a keen art collector…\n\nThe Portrait of Jennie never actually hung in the Met, though—who knows?—a Quatrrocento by John Decker just might. I followed my friend’s cue and went to Central Park the next day, after the picturesque snow had mostly melted away, then headed to the Met to see the George Bellows show. I’d previously seen it at the National Gallery in Washington D.C., though I had been discovering George Bellows in one place or another over much of the previous year: His A Stag at Sharkey’s at the Cleveland Art Museum, lithograph drawings of Billy Sunday at the Boston Public Library, the mizzling Rain on the River at the RISD Museum of Art, Two Women in the Brooklyn Museum’s traveling “Youth and Beauty: Art of the American Twenties” show, Blue Snow, The Battery and Snow Dumpers at the mostly-woeful Columbus Museum of Art, whose greatest virtue is its Bellows collection.\n\nGeorge Wesley Bellows was, like myself, an Ohio man. Born 1882, he came from a small town forty miles west of Columbus called Mechanicsburg, which I drove through once as it lay under a virgin snow of the sort that Bellows so liked to paint. Attending The Ohio State University, Bellows was a formidable athlete as well as artist. He even had an offer from the Cincinnati Reds to play shortstop, and I have amused myself by imagining that, under different circumstances, he might have played on the same team as Freaks director Tod Browning, who came from Louisville and was a lifelong Reds fan, and whose deaf-mute uncle, Pete Browning, was one of the most feared sluggers of his era.\n\nInstead of gobbling up grounders off the bat of Tyrus Raymond Cobb, Bellows moved to New York City, where he studied at the New York School of Art under Robert Henri, and where he found his great subjects, like the tin can fight at the top of this page which comes very close to a scene from Stephen Crane’s Maggie. Opening a lukewarm review of the Met’s Bellows show in The Times, Roberta Smith leads with Sherwood Anderson’s eulogy for the artist: “Anderson wrote that Bellows’s last paintings ‘keep telling you things. They are telling you that Mr. George Bellows died too young. They are telling you that he was after something, that he was always after it.’”\n\nSmith’s assessment that the chronologically-arranged show has a soft middle is not incorrect. It’s certainly frontloaded, for the first rooms contain Bellows’ sporting subjects like Stag, where a well-placed counterpunch makes Francis Bacon of an opponent’s head, bedraggled landscapes of the Pennsylvania Station excavation pit and Riverside Park and the Cloisters (where Jennie Appleton went to convent school!), and portraits displaying a bravura loose brushwork every bit the equal of Sargent’s—though depicting the Other Half mired in New York City rather than the cosmopolitan elite.\n\nThe hazard of success then beset Bellows, who acquired a summer home in Woodstock and took to painting polo matches and tennis games and Cape Cod coasts. In short, he went soft—as many of us habitual New Yorkers fear may happen to us if we break ourselves of the habit. I will admit that the gorehound in me enjoyed Bellow’s propagandistic World War I-era works, particularly an enormous canvas called The Germans Arrive in which the Kaiser’s troops are depicted in the moment of having lopped the hands from a shirtless Belgian villager who’s gone white as a Gainsborough while his wrists produce great gouts of blood, and as you look at the one hand lying on the ground all you can think is where is the other hand?\n\nBut something ineffable begins to enter Bellows’ style in beguiling late works like 1922’s The White Horse and 1924’s The Picnic, as though Bellows has begun to see things behind things, and this the “something” to which I believe Sherwood Anderson refers. Removed from the urban din of his early works, an almost visionary hyper lucidity settles into Bellows’ art. And then… this monument of vitality died of a ruptured appendix in 1925, at age 42. He is buried in Brooklyn, as I dearly hope not to be. The show is up until February 18th, and I recommend you wait until the most horrible sludgy day in winter to see it, preferably with damp socks.\n\n*Since posting, reader and nonpareil critic Melissa E. Anderson has cited the exception of the Ivan Albright Portrait of Dorian Gray from the 1945 Albert Lewin film of the same title, to which I can only respond: Well played.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications.

Follow Nick on Twitter @NickPinkerton.\n\n“Twitter, blogs, enriched media… They’re all fads.”\n\nBoris McGiver as Tom Hammerschmidt, editor-in-chief of the Washington Herald, House of Cards\n\nSome time ago I wrote in this column that “’What happens next?’ is the lowest form of artistic engagement,” and that, furthermore, “talk all you want about the spectacular architecture of the ever-broadening story arc, in my eyes you HBO/AMC/Showtime junkies are all just overgrown kids waiting for the next Rocketeer serial… And that’s what I’ll continue to think until I actually know any better.”\n\nI have since slightly revised my opinion—of serials, that is. The Saturday before last, I attended a few hours of Light Industry’s ‘The American Serial 1914-1944’ program at their Greenpoint space, catching the last quarter of a 12-hour run. The best of what I saw was Republic’s Daredevils of the Red Circle of 1939, rollicking knockabout stuff co-directed by John English and William Witney, concerning three circus performers running down the arch-criminal who made them a trio rather than quartet. The estimable R. Emmet Sweeney, one of few film critics man enough to convincingly wear a beard and, as a Buffalonian, of far heartier stock than I, evidently went the distance, and lived to tell about it.\n\nLight Industry’s Ed Halter was riding the projector the entire time that I was present, jumping from serial to serial every twenty minutes, only allowing cliffhangers to resolve if the episode they’d got their hands on happened to be the last. For one example, we never discovered how and if Reed Hadley’s Zorro got out of that room with the walls closing in, and it really looked bad. With serial segments detached from their narrative framework, one was able to appreciate them as incident-packed entertainment objects unto themselves. And this helped, for though I am a child of television—the natural inheritor of the serial’s tune-in-next-week hook—I prefer good old standalone films.\n\nOf course, it has never been so simple—in classical star careers, which were really acts of sustained character development, audiences experienced each new film by Chaplin or Bogart as a sort-of sequel to that which came before it. Still, there is something about the stated finality of The End which, to my thinking, lends a work a sealed-shut, self-sustaining integrity—like that of politician who doesn’t have to worry about running for re-election. In a much-circulated Vulture interview, Steven Soderbergh, who is running the closing credits on his filmmaking career, appears to agree with this point as regards politics, endorsing “the minority opinion that presidents should be given more power for less time.” But Soderbergh also enthuses over small-screen works like Breaking Bad, Girls, and House of Cards—works that, like any ongoing TV narrative, are continually petitioning their viewership for one more season, if not four more years. (Maybe the better metaphor is pharmaceutical addictions, something Mr. Soderbergh’s Side Effects addresses.)\n\nAn unapologetic enthusiast of Beltway intrigue, scheming women in body-con dresses, and Kevin Spacey’s tart line-readings, leaping eyebrows, and fey, hambone shtick, I have, like Soderbergh, crumbled to House of Cards, which is ever-so-quotable (“We’ll cleave you from the herd, and watch you die in the wilderness”). In the first episode, producer-director David Fincher—seeming to court the Otto Preminger comparisons with this, his very own Advise & Consent—establishes the show’s elegant display-case visual scheme, a template that not even the hysteria-prone Joel Schumacher, handling later episodes, is given license to break out of. Working against this neutral background, a blandly astringent Spacey again proves he is perhaps America’s best bad actor, turning to address the camera, Parker Lewis Can’t Lose-style, as a supermodel might flip her hair, limply parping a hand sanitizer dispenser in the congressional cafeteria, and sarcastic slow-clapping, as with clammy otter paws.\n\nI have not read any reviews of House of Cards, though I have, during the week in which I’ve been glutting myself on the show’s 13-episode run, read a number of pieces on the market-testing, algorithmic method whereby House of Cards was conceived and greenlit by Netflix. The first was by Andrew Leonard in Salon.com, dated February 1st; the second, posted two days later, was by Scott Macauley in Filmmaker magazine; the third, from the day after that, was by Matt Singer at Indiewire. Both of the latter show good form in citing the precedent of Leonard’s piece, then proceed to reiterate Leonard’s definition of a Netflix “event,” with an anecdotal note about compromises to their marathon viewing. Leonard took a break from watching because he “was checking on [his] sick son, home from school with the flu”; Macauley because he had to sleep; while Singer “paused midway through episode 3 to walk [his] dog.”\n\nIn discussing the way our culture is being ever-more-precisely engineered for us by technology, Mssrs. Leonard, Macauley, and Singer, while all doing fine work, have effectively illustrated another contemporary phenomenon, the way in which the discussion of of-the-moment topics tends to become codified while being passed from one site to the next, usually without any appreciable addition of content—roughly the phenomenon Brian Morrissey discusses in a piece for Digiday called “The Media Aggregation Economy.”\n\nI was born the year that Apple, Inc. went public, but I am in many respects a pathetically retrograde figure, with a telling fondness for the title of an early Evelyn Waugh story: “Antony, Who Sought Things That Were Lost.” Towards that end, I spent some hours this week in the Cooper Square archives of The Village Voice, ensconced in research, digging through the years 1975 and 1979. Prior to arriving at The Voice’s offices, I flirted with self-parody by treating myself to a liverwurst-and-onion sandwich at the 150-year-old McSorley’s Old Ale House, while reading a book called Victorian America which, I swear to God, was purchased at the gift shop of the Woodrow Wilson home in Staunton, Virginia. It is safe to say that no, I do not live entirely in the present.\n\nDuring my association with The Voice, I have visited the archives sporadically, and one of the great ancillary pleasures of doing so is being able to breathe the air of a since-departed New York moviegoing culture. For the words of Sarris and Haskell and Tom Allen and J. Hoberman share pages with ads for smut like Much To [sic] Much To Handle “starring Johnny Keyes of Green Door fame” at the 43rd St. Avon Hudson or the bill-of-fare at the Ramrod “Male Theater”; a double-feature of Rollerball and Slither at St. Mark’s Cinema or fanfare for Mitchum’s Farewell My Lovely opening in a dozen Brooklyn theaters.\n\nPerhaps even more alien from a contemporary perspective, the films that are advertised one week will frequently not be written up until the week following, at the critic’s discretion; and once officially reviewed, a film stays reviewed. The review is a standalone, not a foundation on which to build in a Comments section, the critic’s blog, or a Twitter feed.\n\n“Is that a workable model in the internet age?” Kate Mara’s young Washington Herald reporter is asked in House of Cards, during a media appearance. A fine question. After I’d done my photocopying, I tossed off a baker’s dozen drinks with film critic, rock guy, and all-around coherent thinker Bruce Bennett—who happens to share a name with the actor who plays the strongman in Daredevils of the Red Circle. Bruce thinks most of the smart screenwriting today has migrated to TV, and that Nick Ray’s magnificent Hot Blood is a bad mid-60s Elvis movie, but in almost every other respect, nary a cloud has passed between us in matters of taste. In a conversation that covered such pressing topics as Benedict Bogeaus and the contemptuous soloing of Robert Quine, not to speak of routine professional bitchery, I outlined a pet theory that I’d been drafting and re-drafting throughout the week—that film journalism is today in a place analogous to that which music journalism was in 2004 or 2005, when the influence of Pitchforkmedia.com crested.\n\nAbove and beyond any band that they broke (The Wrens?), Pitchfork’s lasting tastemaking legacy will be their vital role in legitimizing a 24-hours music news cycle—much as one can see everywhere evidence of a 24-hour film news cycle emerging. There have always, of course, been industry dailies, but the ruminative, belle-lettrist process of criticism traditionally held itself aloof from the news-generating-and-disseminating process, which in effect was and is an arm of marketing and promotion. This constantly-updating model is, however, enormously appealing to advertisers, as it assures a readership that will return daily to keep up with the ongoing march of ever-refreshing content. While entertainment coverage has long existed even within the bastions of serious criticism—there was an element of it in Arthur Bell’s dishy “Bell Tells” column in The Voice—I suspect the shots will increasingly be called, and the checks will increasingly be cut, according to the needs of our artificially-accelerated news cycle. Once the organs have been put in place to provide ever-renewable content, all that remains is to produce a continual flow of news which there now exists a framework to publish, regardless of if there is any news fit to print—or, rather, post. Things must forever be happening, new talent must forever be “emerging,” and publications with significant web presence must, at festivals, indulge in the equivalent of the Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889, staking claim to the most promising properties first, exhibiting their power through playing kingmaker. All of this goes on quite indifferent to the simple fact that, on any given day, a great film is usually not being made, a great album is usually not being released, and nothing much is happening.\n\nOften, I recall what the mighty J. Hoberman told me about writing for The Voice: “I know what it is to be capable and beautiful and ambitious.” Pardon me, I believe that is House of Cards again; what Jim actually said is that “the tradition, going back to Jonas Mekas, is that the critic sets the agenda.” I leave it to a neutral party to say if this tradition remains at that publication or, indeed, anywhere. As Mr. Morrissey notes, “the pageview-driven digital ad system has taken publishers hostage.” The tyranny of the Facebook ‘Like’ and Pinging will only increase as publishers let their editorial decisionmaking be guided by these necessarily inaccurate recommending tools. Though taken as visible evidence of any given piece’s impact, these tools in fact can only chart the response of a certain (yes, much-desired) demographic given to documenting its approval or disapproval of any and every stimuli it experiences.\n\nHere, for example, is a piece at Huffington Post, about a dog with a humanoid face that is going up for adoption, the accompanying text of which begins “It’s just one of those things that are like, ‘Whoa, dude.’”* At the time of this writing (5:54 PM EST, 2/7/13), it has garnered 17,039 Facebook Likes, 6,246 Shares, 491 Tweets, 111 Google + mentions, has been forwarded in 1,833 e-mails, and attracted 976 Comments. This means that, quantifiably, it is more successful, and therefore better, than anything that I have ever written, or am likely to write, so long as my idea of what’s newsworthy remains Benedict Bogeaus Productions and “the balding guy in the Voidoids” and Emile Meyer (4 Likes, 3 Comments, one my own). And so, like the rest of the depressed, self-medicated, and impoverished American polis, I leave you so I may numb my frustration with House of Cards, with its fantasies of realpolitik potency, poshy intrigues, and handsomely-lit decanters.\n\n*- At some point, the common and very sensible advice of writing in a “voice” that resembles your own conversational tone began to be widely taken to mean that you should stud your sentences with interstitial “likes,” so as to give the reader a mental picture of the author as a laid-back, with-it, shooting-from-the-hip, business-casual dude or dame, one who’s possibly writing while sitting in a chair backwards, A.C. Slater-style. I recommend the old practice of running byline photos be resumed, so that readers can plainly see the mealy-mouthed nerds responsible for generating the content before them, who will then be forced to stop with Fonzie acts that they would not possibly be able to pull off in real life.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a regular contributor to The Village Voice film section, Sight & Sound magazine, and sundry other publications.

He died in December of 1981, aged 96, in California. In between, Dwan had taken up moviemaking, and weathered through the various convulsions of the industry from its inception onward: D.W. Griffith’s narrative innovations, the coming of sound, the challenge of television, the response of Widescreen and Technicolor. He’d also changed his name to “Allan.”\n\nNow, “Allan Dwan” is a funny name. This is probably why I frequently use it as a punchline when talking about the personal fallout of a perverse, highly-impractical addiction to old movies. As in: “Well, I have $16 in my checking account, but I have seen every extant Allan Dwan movie, so…”\n\nComing before a movie, the name “Allan Dwan” under the director’s credit connotes a no-frills simplicity—his nickname was “Practicality Dwan”—a simplicity touching on purity. Dwan learned his craft by studying (and frequently knocking off) Griffith, then proceeded to shoot with the director’s clean, elementary screen grammar for three decades longer than Griffith himself managed to. (Dwan finished his career in 1961.) When I am exhausted with movies, movies, ever more movies, all clangorously insisting on making their impression felt, I need only return to the healing springs of Allan Dwan, and a measure of innocence is regained.\n\nThere are reasons for these associations which are external to Dwan’s style. I moved to New York City in February of 2003, in the middle of a 20-film Dwan retrospective at Lincoln Center, to which I travelled every day upon rising from the friend’s floor in Bay Ridge where I was sleeping. Despite my penury and lack of gainful employment, I have very fond memories of this wide-eyed period. I think it must have been around the same time that I picked up the first issue of a ‘zine called Reverse Shot—tactile photocopied and stapled paper, children!—a pile of which was sitting on a windowsill in the lobby, free for th"
