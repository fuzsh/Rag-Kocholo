Reithofer Frank Billowitz Gerersdorf (NÃ©met-Szent-GrÃ³t) Reitter Mary Kay Felton Harka (Harkau), Hungary My family left Harka Hungary twice.

Samuel, his brother Albert, and their parents came to the United States in the early 1900s. Sam and Alberts younger brother Tobias Payer, Jr. (Toby) and younger sister, Marie, were born in the US.

The second time my grandfather left Harkau was with the evacuation in 1945, when the Russians took over the village. They evacuated to Austria and later emigrated to the US to join the family they already had living there. When they left Hungary for the final time (in 1945), Sam was married to Anna Maria (Marie) Klein. The couple left Hungary with their four children, Frida, Ernst, Emma (my mother) and Fritz Payer. Their names were still on the Protestant Church wall when I visited in 2006.

Payer, Klein, Reitter, Wilfing, Eckel, Buchhaas, and Payerl are among those, but I have few specific details.

Rosenitsch Steven Rosenitsch Neutal (Nyujtal) Johannes Rosenitsch and Anna Dominkovits settled in Toronto in 1928-9. Rosenitsch Kaitlyn Schmit Neutal (Nyujtal) My great-grandfather Michael Cseri (1895-1942) was born in Punitz, house #37. He immigrated to New York City through Baltimore in Nov. 1912. Three of his siblings also immigrated to NYC: Steven Cseri, Anna Hoffman nee Cseri, Hedwig/Hattie List nee Cseri. His siblings Herman, Andreas, Franz, and Joseph remained in Austria. Michael's parents were named Joseph Cseri (1865 - 1925) and Theresia Horvath (1867 - 1918). Marriage record lists them as living at #37 and #53. Joseph's parents were Michael Cseri (1826 - 1866) and Apollonia Holczer (1838 - ?) and his grandparents were possibly Gyorgy Cseri (1792 - 1856) and Anna Hoffman (1805 - >). There were two Theresia Horvaths in Punitz of around the same age. One lived in #53 and the other in #20. Austrian family has handwritten records saying that Theresia Horvath's parents are Joseph Horvath and Teresia Bernarditz, #20, but the marriage record says that our Theresia lived at #53, which means her mom would be Anna Brenner. I'm not sure. Maybe the family record is an incorrect assumption. My great-grandmother Maria Rosenitsch (1906 - 1995) was born in Neutal. She immigrated to NYC through Elis Island in 1922 and married Michael Cherry in NYC around 1928. Her younger two brothers, Johann and Stephan, immigrated to Canada. Maria's parents were Johann Rosenitsch and Theresia Dominkovitz. Possible grandparents were: Stefan Rosenitz + Anna Osterits, and Joseph Dominovitz + Elisabetta Rathmanner. Someone in the Burganland Bunch helped an adopted 3rd cousin build this tree, but I have not verified the names further-up nor have I been able to find records in Neutal.

Roth Elizabeth Hubner Deutsch Tschantschendorf (NÃ©met-Csencs) Roth Joan Cook Tobaj (Tobaj) My grandfather John Leitgeb arrived in NY on the Hansa from Hamburg on February 13, 1923. His mother was Maria Leitgeb (possibly Maria (Mary) Leitgeb 11/9/1884-8/5/1942?) and his stepfather was Ignatz Kroboth (11/11/1871-11/11/1946 - Tobay 95?). John Leitgeb settled in Yorkville, NY and later moved out to Medford, Long Island, NY. His stepsiblings were Theresa Kroboth Roth (9/14/1906-9/29/1991), Ignatz Kroboth (2/??/1908-2/26/1973), Maria (Mary) Kroboth Hoffman (3/29/1909-12/17/1983) and Johanna Kroboth (9/29/1912-2/23/2003). My grandmother was Maria (Mary) Leitgeb (11/4/1899-10/25/1986). Maria Leitgeb's parents were Theresia Schweitzer (no dates) and Josephus Leitgeb (no dates) - 88 Tobaj?. Maria arrived in NY on November 4, 1922 on the SS Ryndam. She traveled using her sister Hermina's passport (we don't know why). Her siblings include Rosa Leitgeb Altmann (3/26/1884-11/22/1954), Josef Leitgeb (11/5/1895(1893)-9/17/1910), Theresia Leitgeb Schneider (9/23/1897-8/27/1976) and Hermina Leitgeb Stimpfl (1/10/1906-1/23/1985). The families all lived together in NYC and Yorkville and later moved out to Medford, LI, NY. The mystery I am trying to solve: I was told my grandfather's biological father was John Schweitzer (2/4/1882 - 6/15/1930 - also from Tobaj) who lived in Northhampton, PA with his wife Rose Wiener Schweitzer (1883-1/18/1971). I was told that my grandmother's mother (Theresia Schweitzer) was a cousin to my grandfather's biological father (John Schweitzer). Family names are: Leitgeb, Kroboth, Schweitzer, Stimpfl, Unger, Astel (Gussing nr. 90) , Jost, Wurm, Nikitscher.

Rozenich Linda Pipher Kleinwarasdorf (Borisfalva) Rozner Stella Laponuke Walbert Strem (StrÃ©m) I am able via Ancestry .com to trace my maternal great-grandmother Maria Mirakovits (Mirakovics) to her ancestors Georgius ( Gyorgy ) Szayer 1811-30 Apr1861 who was married to Josefa Tukovits 1813-27May 1845 and my maternal great- grandfather Mikaly Marth 3Apr1856 to his parents Josef Marth and Terezia Rozner , they were from Strem , Gussing. My grandmother Katarina Matys ( Mattis) was born 1Nov1887 in Pinka Keresz Hungary later Eisenberg an der Pinka Austria. Her parents where Karl Matys and Maria Matys. Katarina was orphaned and married at age 14, she married Mikaly Marth. They had a infant girl Stella who died at age 2 in Austria of diptheria, daughter Rosa was born in Austria in 1908 and immigrated in 1914.
