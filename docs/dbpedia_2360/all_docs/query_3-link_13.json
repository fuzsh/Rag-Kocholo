It translates to \"Slovak\" in English, deriving from the old Hungarian word \"Tót,\" which referred to someone from Slovakia or a person of Slovakian descent. Thus, it is an ethnic surname representing the historical relationship and geographical proximity between Hungary and Slovakia. It is important to note that it is one of the most common last names in Hungary. It shows how surnames can quite often represent ethnic or regional identities or be indicative of ancestry, migration, and population movement.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nToth: Where does the name Toth come from?\n\nToth is a surname of European origin, primarily found in Hungary and Slovakia today. It is most common in the central and eastern regions of Hungary and the southern region of Slovakia. In these countries, Toth is one of the top 100 most common surnames.\n\nToth is derived from the given name Toth, which itself is derived from the Proto-Slavic root “tъtъ”, meaning “brave”. It was a popular given name in the Slavic world and this eventually led to the surname. It is possible that the progression from given name to surname began sometime in the 11th or 12th century.\n\nThe Toth surname is also found in small numbers in other countries around Europe, such as Romania and Croatia, as well as the United States. It is likely that these names represent descendants of original Toth families who emigrated from Hungary and Slovakia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nToday, the Toth surname is found in significant numbers in Hungary and Slovakia. Its origin in the Middle Ages is still remembered in both countries and it is considered by many to be a proud symbol of national identity.\n\nVariations of the surname Toth\n\nThe surname Toth is thought to have originated in Hungary with the Magyar tribes and has many variants and spellings.
