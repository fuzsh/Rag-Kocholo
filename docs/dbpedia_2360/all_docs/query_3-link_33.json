        "text": "Generally, in Eastern European records, \"alias\" in records simply means that the said person is \"also known as\" by another name in their village. I have a few where a family surname is very common in a village, like the Hungarian surname \"Nagy\". At a certain time period in this village, some of these Nagy family members where given an added surname, such as in my case, \"Molnar-Nagy\" to distinguish them from other \"Nagys\" who were not related in that particular village. Therefore, an extra \"surname\" is an identity label added to their known surname to separate them distinctively, e.g. a \"Janos Cseh Toth\" is not the same person as a \"Janos Toth\" in the very same village in same time period ; they are completely different men who live in the same block, farm or even in the same house.\n\nI do have an actual proven instance in records of an ancestral Nagy home where a \"Nagy\" woman from same family home married a \"Kovacs\" and they were the last family in the old Nagy house. All the children were given the \"Nagy Kovacs\" surname. Sometimes written abbreviated as \"N. Kovacs\" or \"Nagy K.\" in the records!\n\nAnother situation I have seen is when an alias is used for a person who may have had lost his parents young and they were raised by another unrelated family so this person in that village is known by both surnames. However, this is not common and records of deaths for all persons surrounding that person with the \"alias\" needs to be pursued for that angle.\n\nI don't see aliases attached to women surnames as much which alway mades me wonder about the \"farm names\" theory in Hungarian records which is prevalent in German or Scandinavian naming customs."
