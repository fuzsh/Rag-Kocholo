        "text": "Surnames originating from ethnonyms form a characteristic part of the Hungarian surname stock, in comparison to other European nations. They make up at most 0.5% of the surname stock, yet their proportion is 7-8%. Among the 10 most frequent surnames, 3 are of this type: Tóth (= Slav, Slovak), Horvát (= Croat), Német (= German). In this paper an analysis is presented of this surname category: the background and motivations for their creation, their history, and the characteristics of their geographical distribution.\n\nThe paper aims to provide a comprehensive typology of surname changes, analysed in the case of the Hungarian surname system. The typology presented here is partly language specific and characterises the given historic, social and cultural circumstances, but partly conveys more general lessons to be learned about the nature of surname change. The paper also identifies the most typical tendencies in the diachrony of the Hungarian surname stock. Some characteristics (e.g. archaic orthography, dialectal variation, morphological markedness) are treated here, affected by various linguistic and extralinguistic factors.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to continue the research on the structure of the Hungarian surname stock today, focusing on its etymological, typological and geographical distribution. The analysis is based on the one hundred most frequent surnames regionally in Hungary (in the 19 counties and in the capital, Budapest), and, additionally, in the Hungarian surname stock in Romania. Within its own limits, it provides an appropriate onomastic methodology, and a representative picture for the given surname stock, to be interpreted also in the broader context of European surname studies today.\n\nThis paper is a study of the use and the value of foreign surnames of minorities in a dominant linguistic and cultural context, as well as the process of the assimilation of these names and their bearers. It analyzes the different reasons and the ways of spontaneous and conscious name changes, giving a special attention to the question of how the linguistic characteristics of original foreign surnames and the existing Hungarian surname stock could influence the new surnames coined by these changes in Hungarian history.\n\nThe topic this paper has set out to explore wished to yield some insights into one chapter of the Romanian-Hungarian historic, linguistic and onomastic contacts from the point of view of current Hungarian research. Its topic is based on the representative historic and current onomastic sources: the presence, the history and the distribution of surnames of Romanian linguistic origin in the Hungarian surname stock. The main focus are three specific surnames (Árgyelán, Marosán, Moldován), discussing the presence, changes, distribution and variants of these names in present-day Hungary and the territory of the historic Hungarian Kingdom and Transylvania.\n\nThe paper carries out a typological-statistical analysis concentrating on the 100 most common surnames in Hungary, focusing on certain methodological aspects, which have received less than due attention in earlier studies. The research also aims to point out some characteristics of the surname stock in question in comparison with other European surname systems. The majority of European countries significant efforts have been, or are being made to describe the structure, composition and geographical distribution of their surname stock. The findings, unsurprisingly, show noteworthy differences, which are often linked to national borders and the historic-geographic presence of a language and its speaking community. Similar studies have to be carried out in several countries, based on the most representative name corpuses and using a similar methodology - presupposes large-scale international cooperation and coordination efforts.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the different branches of the historical studies can be used in the research of historical family names. One of the most important but strongly disputed questions of Hungarian historical personal name studies is from which century we can talk about family names in Hungary. This uncertainty has various reasons; for instance, it is very difficult to prove that it was hereditary (which is one of the basic criteria for naming an element a family name). In carrying out this work, genealogy and the history of estates can be helpful. The paper presents the three types of distinguishing elements which are regarded as the origin from which family names had developed (patr onym, placename and byname) with so me examples from 14th-century documents. I also intend to demonstrate how we can certify their hereditary char acter with the means of historical researches. Furthermore, I am to present some cases wher e a special Hungarian di stinguishing element de genere [‘from the kindred of’] appears in the name structure. Finally, my paper touches upon the question how one can explain with the help of historical research of the Hu ngarian society in the Angevi n Age that this element did not have a role in the development of family names.\n\nMany names were changed spontaneously in language contact situations according to the name stock of the dominant community in Hungary in the old centuries. In the 19th century, nationalism gave rise to a new linguistic ideology aiming at uniting the 'nation'. Surnames became also ethnic symbols, thus the concepts of the assimilation of linguistic/ ethnic minorities and the changing of surnames of foreign origin joined together. The paper gives an account of the linguistic and onomastic factors of this phenomenon, and the historical, social, ideological background of the process. It focuses on the assimilation of minorities and its consequences concerning their personal names in Hungary, a lot in common with similar processes of other countries, in the 19 th and 20 th century. A nevek megváltoztatása mint a különbségek eltörlése: A személynév mint etnikai szimbólum, a családnév-változtatások jellemzői és a családnevek magyarosítása Magyarországon. Promena imena kao brisanje različitosti: Rođeno ime kao etnički simbol, karakteristike promena porodičnih imena i mađarenje porodičnih imena u Mađarskoj.\n\nIn the age of romanticism and nationalism, personal names played a special, symbolic role. This paper presents how the new, national given names could be created, expanding the traditional given-name stock of ecclesiastic origin. The historical and onomastic background, the various sources and methods, and the consequences of this process are presented, in the case of the Hungarian given-name stock of the 18th–19th centuries, which had much in common with other nations and languages as well.\n\nIn the multilingual Carpathian Basin the language systems influence name-giving, resulting in the emergence of interferential properties in name usage. These characteristics are found where languages come into contact, such as on language borders. The main aim of this paper is to provide an examination of name contact phenomena emerging from Hungarian and Romanian connections. My source is the Atlas of Historical Surnames of Hungary (AHSH 1715 and 1720). One of the great advantages of this reference book is that the organic “unity” of personal names in the Carpathian Basin can be represented on maps in relation to how name systems of different languages affected each other. This study discusses how an important source of data—the earliest tax censuses—can be used to trace certain phenomena that arose due to how names were recorded."
