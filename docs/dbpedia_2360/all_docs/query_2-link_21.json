        "text": "NIGHT LIBRARIAN FCBD 2024 – untitled, [W/A] Christopher Lincoln. A preview of an upcoming graphic novel. The excerpt provided is chapter four, so the reader has to infer what’s happened in the earlier chapters. I like the idea of a story about magical libraries, but this comic doesn’t do anything new or original with that idea, and I don’t plan to read the full version of the graphic novel.\n\nBEAR PIRATE VIKING QUEEN #1 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Sean Lewis, [A] Jonathan Marks Barravecchia. I bought this just because of the title. This comic definitely has bears, pirates and Vikings in it, but I’m not sure how they’re all connected, as the comic’s plot is rather incomprehensible. Marks Barravecchia’s painted art is intriguing, reminding me of Sienkiewicz. I liked this comic enough that I’ll finish reading this miniseries.\n\nSPECTREGRAPH #1 (DSTLRY, 2024) – untitled, [W] James Tynion IV, [A] Christian Ward. Janie, a real estate agent and single mother, abandons her infant child at home to attend a house showing. The house turns out to be some kind of eldrich monstrosity, and Janie gets trapped in there. A possible flaw with this comic is that at the very beginning of the story, Janie forfeits the reader’s sympathy by abandoning her child. It’s clear that she had to choose between her baby and her job, but it’s equally clear that she made the wrong choice. The horror premise is interesting, and it feels like a logical development from the architectural themes of Nice House on the Lake. Christian Ward’s artwork is spectacular, especially at the larger page size. I did not get issue 2, but I will see if Heroes can order it.\n\nBATMAN: THE DARK AGE #2 (DC, 2024) – untitled, [W] Mark Russell, [A] Mike Allred. Bruce has his prison sentence commuted in exchange for serving in Vietnam, where he’s trained by Ra’s al Ghul. Bruce returns to Gotham, which has become even more of a shithole than usual, and begins his career as Batman. This issue is entertaining, and feels historically accurate, though its depiction of the law is another matter. On that point see my review of #3 below.\n\nTEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES #150 (IDW, 2024) – untitled, [W] Sophie Campbell, [A] Vincenzo Federici & Fero Pe. Sophie Campbell’s TMNT run ends not with a bang but a whimper. There’s a cute moment at the end where Donatello is reunited with the now-demutated Lita, but otherwise this issue, like the entire Armaggon storyline, is confusing and impenetrable. 50 issues is an extremely long run these days, and Sophie Campbell succeeded in making me care about this franchise for the first time since the ‘90s. But I think it’s time for her to step aside, and I’m looking forward to the upcoming Jason Aaron run. It’s too bad that Sophie didn’t draw any of this issue.\n\nSCARLET WITCH AND QUICKSILVER #3 (Marvel, 2024) – untitled, [W] Steve Orlando, [A] Lorenzo Tammetta. Wanda and Vizh fight the Wizard’s troops, and Speed also appears. This comic isn’t amazing, but it’s an entertaining and quick read with nice art, and I’m a big fan of Wanda. The Wizard’s characterization in this series is completely wrong; he’s supposed to be a cynical profiteer, not a passionate zealot, and he’s not supposed to meddle with supernatural forces.\n\nUNIVERSAL MONSTERS: CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON LIVES! #1 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Dan Watters & Ram V, [A] Matthew Roberts. Kate, an American journalist, was nearly murdered by a serial killer she was investigating. Now she follows his trail to the Brazilian Amazon, where she’s saved from drowning by a swamp monster. Unlike the previous Universal Monsters miniseries, this series is not an adaptation but an original story, and it’s an intriguing one. I talked to Matthew Roberts at Heroes Con. Until then, I didn’t quite realize that this Universal Monsters series was drawn by the same artist as Manifest Destiny.\n\nLESTER OF THE LESSER GODS #1 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Eric Powell & Lucky Yates, [A] Gideon Kendall. This miniseries is a follow-up to a one-shot that was published by the now-defunct Albatross. Lester of the Lesser Gods is a very silly parody of the sword-and-sorcery genre, with a fat hero who wears only a helmet, boots and a thong. The joke is that, much like The Goon, Lester of the Lesser Gods is narrated in an entirely deadpan style. It doesn’t try to be too funny, and that makes it all the funnier. Gideon Kendall was at Heroes Con, but I didn’t speak to him.\n\nSUPERMAN: HOUSE OF BRAINIAC SPECIAL #1 (DC, 2024) – “House of Brainiac 2.5, Chapter One: Secrets of Czarnia,” [W] Joshua Williamson, [A] Edwin Galmon, etc. The first and third chapters of this one-shot are about the Coluans’ dealings with the Czarnians and Amanda Waller. The central chapter, which is much better, is about Bibbo’s debate with xenophobic mayoral candidate Garon Blake. This story is written by Mark Russell, and it shows his usual sensitive understanding of politics. Like much of his work, it’s very cynical but ends with a touch of hope.\n\nKILL YOUR DARLINGS #6 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Ethan S. Parker & Griffin Sheridan, [A] Bob Quinn. I thought I had dropped this series from my pull list, but this issue was in my file anyway. Kill Your Darlings is just a generic horror comic with nothing particularly new or original about it. If there’s a second story arc, I won’t be buying it.\n\nG.O.D.S. #7 (Marvel, 2024) – “Signal to Noise,” [W] Jonathan Hickman, [A] Valerio Schiti. I have no idea what happened in this issue. From a promising start, G.O.D.S. has become a confusing, pointless mess. Mia, the only interesting character in the series, has been totally forgotten. Whatever Hickman planned to achieve in this series, he seems to have given up on it. I’m glad this is the second-to-last issue.\n\nBLOW AWAY #1 (Boom!, 2024) – untitled, [W] Zac Thompson, [A] Nicola Izzo. I’m not sure why I ordered this series, because I haven’t been enjoying Zac Thompson’s work very much. His comics are heavily reliant on a type of body horror that doesn’t appeal to me. The only one of his series that I really liked was No One’s Rose. However, Blow Away does have an interesting premise. Brynne Brautigan, a wildlife photographer, travels to Baffin Island in the Arctic to try to document an endangered species. While there, she witnesses one mountain climber murdering another. Blow Away’s plot resembles that of Rear Window, while its setting is similar to that of Rucka and Leiber’s Whiteout, and that’s a promising combination.\n\nEDGE OF SPIDER-VERSE #3 (Marvel, 2024) – “A Star (Spider) is Born,” [W] Justina Ireland, [A] Pete Woods. I enjoyed Justina Ireland’s young adult novel Dread Nation, but her Star-Spider story in Edge of Spider-Verse #3 is unimpressive. It’s just a generic superhero story with a science-fictional setting that plays no major role in the plot. Also, I was distracted by trying to translate the alien text. I did enjoy Pete Woods’s art. The backup story, written by Steve Foxe, is actually slightly more interesting, since it depicts a world where Harry Osborn is Spider-Man and Peter Parker is his assistant.\n\nTHE SCALE TRADE #1 (Magma, 2024) – untitled, [W] Steve Orlando, [A] Megan Huang. In a world that’s like our own, except with dragons, the Dragon Conservation Agency is dedicated to stopping the illegal trade in dragon body parts. When writing this review I had to skim this comic to remind myself what it was about. Megan Huang has established a unique niche for herself as an artist of cute kaiju stories, and The Scale Trade is an intriguing blend of the kaiju and police procedural genres. This series is reminiscent of James Patrick’s Kaiju Score.\n\nORCS! THE GIFT #3 (Boom!, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Christine Larsen. I don’t think I ever received issue 2. This issue is devoted to setting up the big confrontation between the various tribes and the evil curse or whatever it is. There’s one subplot where the evil wizard’s ghost is trying to affect the material world, and another major theme is Pez and Utzu’s rivalry. I always enjoy Orcs, but this issue has so many different plots going on that it lacks a central theme or point.\n\nMAD MAGAZINE SPECIAL EDITION 2024 (DC, 2024) – [W/A] various. This FCBD strip is a collection of reprinted Mad Magazine strips about DC superheroes. There are some classic strips by artists like Sergio Aragonés and Don Martin, and some newer material by Kerry Callen. Most of the Callen strips were familiar to me since I’ve already seen them on Facebook. It’s been a long time since I’ve read Mad, but I’ve acquired almost all of DC’s magazine-format reprints of the original Mad comic books, and I need to read them soon. I feel like my ignorance of the classic Mad comic books is a big gap in my comics knowledge.\n\nTHE BLOODY DOZEN #5 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Charles Soule, [A] Alberto Jimenez Alburquerque. The issue starts with a flashback sequence, and then in the present day, the granddaughter gets turned into a vampire. She kills the mother, but the grandfather activates the ship’s self-destruct protocol. I spoke to Charles Soule at Heroes Con and told him how much I enjoyed Eight Billion Genies. I didn’t tell him that I haven’t been enjoying The Shrouded College quite as much.\n\nDAWNRUNNER #2 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Ram V, [A] Evan Cagle. Anita is benched after her mecha shuts down in the middle of a fight with a kaiju. She disobeys orders and activates her mecha again, and is projected back into the memories of Ichiro Takeda, whose brain was used to produce the mecha. Evan Cagle’s draftsmanship in this series is brilliant, but his fight scenes are difficult to parse. In particular, it’s hard to tell where the Dawnrunner’s arms and legs are.\n\nGANNIBAL FCBD (Ablaze, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Masaaki Ninomiya. A cop takes a new job at a remote Japanese village. To his horror, he quickly realizes that everyone in the village is part of some kind of murder conspiracy, and if he does anything about it, he’ll be killed. This seems like a promising horror comic, and Ninomiya’s artwork is much more detailed and expressonistic than is typical for manga. However, it’s unlikely that I’ll read any more of Gannibal, just because there are so many other manga that interest me more.\n\nGODZILLA: WAR FOR HUMANITY #5 (IDW, 2024) – untitled, [W] Andrew MacLean, [A] Jake Smith. The heroine finally defeats Zoospora by destroying it at its source, and she’s reunited with her daughter. This was a fun series with cute artwork. I talked with Andrew MacLean at Heroes Con.\n\nFCBD 2024: ALL AGES (Dark Horse, 2024) – Star Wars Young Jedi Adventures: “Sky Parade Rescue,” [W] Daniel José Older, [A] Andy Duggan. A silly story about young Jedi cadets. There’s also a Plants vs. Zombies backup story, which is a waste of writer Paul Tobin’s talents. Plants vs. Zombies (like Angry Birds) is not suitable for adaptation into comics because it lacks a plot.\n\nPROJECT: CRYPTID #8 (Ahoy, 2024) – “Devil’s Advocate,” [W] Deron Bennett, [A] Steve Ellis. The Jersey Devil files a lawsuit to make the New Jersey Devils change its name. This is kind of a funny idea, although the late Batton Lash could have done a better story with this premise. In the backup story, the Skunk Ape becomes a candidate for governor of Florida. He would certainly be better than the current governor.\n\nRISE OF THE POWERS OF X #4 (Marvel, 2024) – “Sentinel X,” [W] Kieron Gillen, [A] R.B. Silva. In this issue there’s some kind of an epic struggle between Enigma and the Phoenix. I’ve gotten thoroughly sick of this series since it began, and I’m only reading it out of a misplaced sense of loyalty to Gillen.\n\nX-MEN FOREVER #2 (Marvel, 2024) – “Quiet Council,” [W] Kieron Gillen, [A] Luca Maresca. This issue isn’t much better than Rise of the Powers of X #4. If I understood correctly, the main plot development in this issue is that the non-combat mutants get to stay in an extradimensional version of Krakoa, so Krakoa still exists, but without any of the characters we care about.\n\nOPERATION SUNSHINE: ALREADY DEAD #1 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Henry Zebrowski & Marcus Parks, [A] David Rubín. A confusing, uninteresting, and poorly explained story about vampires. This issue is numbered 1, but it makes no sense to a reader who hasn’t read the previous Operation Sunshine miniseries. And even if I had read them, I don’t think I would have liked this comic much. It seems rather similar to American Vampire and Redneck, neither of which was a favorite of mine. I was buying this comic exclusively because of David Rubín’s art, and his art is good, but it’s not good enough to justify the price of the comic. I won’t be getting issue 2.\n\nDAREDEVIL #8 (Marvel, 2024) – “Introductory Rites,” [W] Saladin Ahmed, [A] Aaron Kuder. In this issue’s main story, Matt and Elektra defeat Bullseye, but then he’s set free by corrupt cops, and the Kingpin reasserts his control over Hell’s Kitchen. This issue also includes four backup stories, two of which are by previous Daredevil writers. None of these four stories are much good, and I’m not fond of either D.G. Chichester or Ann Nocenti’s Daredevil to begin with. The initial edition of this issue had a printing error in which 16 pages were left out. The omitted material included the last three pages of the cover gallery; the entire Elsa Sjunneson story; and the first page of the Ann Nocenti story. I received the incorrect version of the issue, but I later also received a corrected version for free. The story that was left out of the first printing is probably the best of the four.\n\nCEMETERY KIDS DON’T DIE #3 (Oni, 2024) – untitled, [W] Zac Thompson, [A] Daniel Irizarri. Just more of the same plots as last issue, with no new or surprising developments. I said in an above review that Zac Thompson’s work is reliant on a type of body horror that I don’t enjoy, and Cemetery Kids Don’t Die is an example of that. It’s at least his second series where the plot relies on a piece of Cronenbergian flesh technology.\n\nSHOWCASE #22 (DC, 1959/2004) – “SOS Green Lantern,” [W] John Broome, [A] Gil Kane. I already had the Silver Age Classics reprint of this issue, but the facsimile edition also includes the original ads, making it a strict upgrade to the Silver Age Classics edition. Showcase #22 introduces the Silver Age Green Lantern, and it’s also the beginning of Hal’s creepy, stalker-ish romance with Carol Ferris. A plot hole in this issue – the fact that Abin Sur used a spaceship when he shouldn’t have needed it – was the inspiration for many years of retcons.\n\nMYTHOLOGIES & APOCRYPHA #1 (Fantagraphics, 2024) – “McQueen & Sinatra in America Part One,” [W/A] Tim Lane. This new series is a follow-up to Lane’s previous solo title, Happy Hour in America, and it continues that series’s obsessive focus on Steve McQueen. In Mythologies and Apocrypha #1, Lane is concerned in particular with McQueen’s relationship with Frank Sinatra. The history recounted in this issue is intriguing, but what’s really stunning about this comic is Lane’s artwork. His rendering of light-dark contrasts is similar to that of Charles Burns, particularly in the night scenes, which have a very stark effect. But Lane’s draftsmanship is even more hyperdetailed than Burns’s. The Junkman story at the end of the issue reminds me of Wally Wood, though I’m not sure just why. This is incredible artwork, though it’s also very labor-intensive.\n\nHARLEY QUINN ANNUAL 2024 (DC, 2024) – “Now You Sea Me… Now You Die!”, [W/A] Erica Henderson. Having stolen a lot of money, Harley decides to go on a cruise. Zatanna happens to be on the same cruise ship, and the two of them have a ridiculous adventure. This issue has very cute art and a hilarious story. I’m not sure if I’ve read anything else that Erica Henderson wrote herself, but she’s a talented writer as well as a superstar artist.\n\nCOUMA ACÒ (L’Association, 1991/2005) – [W/A] Edmond Baudoin. This book was first published in 1991, and won the Angoulême award for best album the following year. It can be considered a graphic memoir, but it’s really more of a biography of the author’s grandfather, John Carney. John, an English-born foundling who grew up in the South of France, is a bizarre man, an itinerant drunk who bathes once a year and wanders around the village singing songs from World War I. But the author depicts him with affection, showing how he represents a sort of provincial French rural life that’s been destroyed by modernity. The title Couma Acò is the equivalent of “comme ci” (“like that”) in Occitan, a language which is rapidly being replaced by standard French. In general this book is a vivid and unflinching but tender portrayal of a very strange old man. The book is illustrated in a black line which is so heavy and messy that it borders on abstraction, but as with Alex Toth, Baudoin’s messy draftsmanship conceals his mastery of composition and anatomy. At times the texture of the original drawing paper is visible through Baudoin’s layers of black ink. Baudoin’s only book translated into English is another autobiographical work, Piero. Baudoin is a major talent and a significant influence on younger French “alternative” cartoonists, and it’s a pity that Anglophone readers don’t have access to more of his work.\n\nMINOR THREATS: THE FASTEST WAY DOWN #2 (Dark Horse, 2024) – “The Haunted and the Lonely,” [W] Patton Oswalt & Jordan Blum, [A] Scott Hepburn. Playtime fends off some more threats to her rule of the city, but her enemies try to kidnap her daughter and her elderly mother. This issue is not bad, but I think The Alternates was better than either of the main Minor Threats miniseries.\n\nEVERYTHING SUCKS: NOAH’S MILLIONS #1 (Silver Sprocket, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Michael Sweater. I think I’ve seen this series at Heroes before, but I didn’t buy it because it was too expensive. In this issue, two anthropomorphic slackers discover a bag full of mob money, then they decide it’s too much trouble, and they throw it away in the river. Then they regret their decision and try to reclaim the money, but it’s too late. This comic sort of reminds me of Caroline Cash’s PeePee PooPoo, in that first, it’s about characters in their late teens and early twenties, and second, it attempts to revive the moribund format of the alternative comic book. Like PeePee PooPoo, Everything Sucks has excellent production values, even including a foil cover. Sweater’s artwork, in the Adventure Time style, is detailed and expressive, and his coloring is extremely vivid. And his coloring is funny. I bought an earlier issue of Everything Sucks at Heroes Con, and I’m going to read it soon. (Addendum: I have read it now; see below.)\n\nGEIGER #1 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Geoff Johns, [A] Gary Frank. After saving a child from a kidnapper, Geiger sits down to read Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian. But the rest of the issue is more like Don Quixote, as Geiger is approached by a crazy old man wearing a suit of armor, who wants to join Geiger on a quest. This issue includes several touching scenes that reference Geiger’s trauma over the loss of his own children.\n\nTHE FORGED #7 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Greg Rucka, [A] Mike Henderson. The protagonists have to collaborate with some other Forged teams to to investigate the alien threat in the Skull Nebula. The most memorable part of this issue is the bickering between Victory and the other Forged captains. I bought issue 8 of this series a while ago, but I haven’t read it yet. My principal problem with this series is the massive amount of uninteresting text at the end of each issue. Also, like Lazarus, The Forged takes place in a world that’s so bleak and dystopian as to be uninteresting to read about. Mike Henderson was at Heroes Con, but I didn’t speak to him. Greg Rucka was supposed to be at Heroes Con too, but I don’t recall seeing him. I’d have liked to ask him if there’ll ever be another issue of Black Magick.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS, I’M ALREADY DEAD #3 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Matt Kindt, [A] Dan McDaid. The other human survivor is revealed to be the villain of the story, and Robin has to take control of a giant alien god in order to defeat him. This issue is rather Kirbyesque, and the alien gods are clearly reminiscent of the Celestials. Dan McDaid’s artwork here is quite good. I talked to Matt Kindt briefly at Heroes Con. I told him that I think Subgenre is the key to all of his work, but that I’m not sure just how.\n\nSTORIES FROM THE ATLAS COMICS LIBRARY: FCBD 2024 #1 (Fantagraphics, 2024) – “The Raving Maniac,” [W] Stan Lee, [A] Joe Maneely, etc. A collection of pre-Code Atlas stories spanning various genres, with art by Colan, Maneely, Everett and Wolverton. All these stories are fascinating and beautifully drawn, and together they make the case that Atlas was comparable in quality to EC. The highlight of the issue is Lee and Maneely’s “The Raving Maniac,” a direct response to Wertham and other comics censors. It’s nice to have a chance to read these old Atlas comics, since the original issues are beyond my price range. I talked with Don Rosa at Heroes Con about his collection, and I think he mentioned that Atlas war comics are quite difficult to find.\n\nTHE BRAVE AND THE BOLD #54 (DC, 1964/2024) – “The Thousand-and-One Dooms of Mr. Twister,” [W] Bob Haney, [A] Bruno Premiani. I already read this story in The Greatest Team-Up Stories Ever Told. It’s one of the worst stories in that book, though it’s historically important as the first appearance of the Teen Titans. Mr. Twister is a laughable villain, yet the story depicts him as a serious threat. There’s a cringeworthy moment where the missing teenagers leave a note saying “All us cats decided to skip, until adults to the music get hip,” and Robin realizes it’s a fake because it says “music” instead of “jive.” Bob Haney was only about 38 when he wrote this story, yet it still reads like an old man’s depiction of teenagers. Finally, the three heroes – Kid Flash, Robin and Aqualad – all have the same personality. This last problem was addressed in the second Teen Titans appearance in BOTB #60, where Wonder Girl was added to the team.\n\nOlder comics:\n\nTHE WALKING DEAD #136 (Image, 2015) – “Found,” [W] Robert Kirkman, [A] Charlie Adlard. This issue continues to deal with the aftermath of issue 134, where Carl beat up the bullies who attacked Sophia (not Lydia, as I mistakenly wrote in my review of that issue). In this issue, Carl talks with Lydia in her cell, and meanwhile, Gregory floats the idea of assassinating Maggie, but no one else supports him in this. A problem with The Walking Dead is that most issues are collections of independent scenes, with no central theme.\n\nINCREDIBLE HULK #225 (Marvel, 1978) – “Is There Hulk After Death?”, [W] Roger Stern, [A] Sal Buscema. Bruce falls into a coma, and in order to both save him and defeat the Leader’s plot, Doc Samson has to turn Bruce back into the Hulk. There’s also a brief subplot about Jim Wilson and his traveling companion Kropotkin the Great. This is an entertaining issue, but it feels like a rehash of older Hulk stories.\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO #3 (Charlton, 1968) – “The Sound of Noise (A Musical Tragedy)”, [W] Steve Skeates, [A] Henry Scarpelli. An adaptation of Hanna-Barbera’s Abbott and Costello cartoons, which were produced long after the breakup of the Abbott-Costello team and the death of Lou Costello. Some of the stories in this issue are interesting because of their metatextual nature. In particular, “Captain Costello” is a parody of contemporary superhero comics. Steve Skeates’s greatest work for Charlton was his metatextual story “The Best of All Possible Worlds,” in The Many Ghosts of Dr. Graves #5, and some of his Abbott and Costello stories are in the same vein as that story. I’d especially like to get Abbott and Costello #16, which includes a story set at a comic convention.\n\nTINTIN VOL. 12 (Egmont, 1943/1959) – “Red Rackham’s Treasure,” [W/A] Hergé. In a direct sequel to “The Secret of the Unicorn,” Tintin and Haddock go to sea to search for Red Rackham’s buried treasure. Professor Calculus, a new character, stows away on their ship with his experimental submarine. Thanks to the submarine, Tintin finds the wreck of the Unicorn, but the treasure is not there. However, Tintin does find proof that Haddock is the rightful owner of Marlinspike, and after Haddock buys the house with Calculus’s money, Tintin discovers Red Rackham’s treasure in the basement. This album is another demonstration of Hergé’s absolute mastery. It’s full of clever plot twists and funny gags, and the underwater sequences are exciting, especially the scene where Tintin fights a shark. Unlike in Red Rackham’s Treasure, there’s no antagonist (except Calculus briefly), but the plot is thrilling anyway.\n\nSTALKER #3 (DC, 1975) – “The Freezing Flames of the Burning Isle,” [W] Paul Levitz, [A] Steve Ditko w/ Wally Wood. Stalker visits an island ruled by a sorceress who is later revealed to be a harpy. This series was a huge disappointment considering the talent involved. It wasn’t even as good as DC’s other barbarian comics like Beowulf or Claw the Unconquered.\n\nPLANETARY #14 (Wildstorm, 2001) – “Zeropoint,” [W] Warren Ellis, [A] John Cassaday. Elijah discovers Thor’s hammer, which is just one of a number of superhero weapons that the Four have captured from their original owners. This scene is an echo of Miracleman: the Four have an entire pocket dimension full of weapons stretching out indefinitely, just like the Qys have an Underspace full of bodies. Afterward, Planetary battles the Four again, and the Four capture Elijah and subject him to a memory wipe. I assume that Elijah’s last speech – “Don’t you dare come looking for me” and so on – is part of some sort of backup plan, but I’m not sure what that plan is.\n\nHARD TIME #11 (DC, 2005) – “Cruxes,” [W] Steve Gerber, [A] Brian Hurtt. This was Gerber’s last major work, but it wasn’t one of his best. IIRC, I bought the first couple issues when they came out, but I gave up on the series after that. Hard Time is a fantasy or horror story set in a prison, but beyond that, I’m not sure what precisely it’s about, and this issue didn’t make any real impression on me. It did remind me of Foolkiller (see below) because of the prison setting.\n\nMAJOR BUMMER #13 (DC, 1998) – “Been There, Done That,” [W] John Arcudi, [A] Doug Mahnke. Lou’s elderly friend Lauren develops the ability to see into the past, and as a result, the protagonists are caught up in a time travel plot. This series is not a favorite of mine, but it’s funny and well-drawn, and it’s better than other DC comics with a similar style of humor, by which I mostly mean Hitman.\n\nJADEMAN OPENS THE GATES OF THE NIGHT #1 (Jademan, 1990) – “Spirit of the Fire,” [W/A] uncredited. A collection of horror stories set in Hong Kong. I read this because I was curious to see a Chinese take on the horror genre, but this comic is a huge disappointment. First, the translation is so bad that the stories are nearly unreadable. Some of Jademan’s other comics were translated by Mike Baron, so the translations were at least written in idiomatic English, though they weren’t accurate. But in Gates of the Night the translation is both unidiomatic and inaccurate. Second, the stories in this issue are just based on stock Western horror themes, and there’s little influence from traditional Chinese ghost or vampire stories. The most interesting of the stories is the one that’s about an actual statue.\n\nMARVEL MONSTERS: WHERE MONSTERS DWELL #1 (Marvel, 2005) – “Bring On the Bombu!”, [W/A] Keith Giffen, etc. A collection of parodistic stories written in the style of Marvel’s classic monster comics. The other two stories, besides the one by Giffen, are written by Peter David and Jeff Parker, but none of the three stories is particularly interesting. The Jeff Parker story suffers from being too similar to a real Marvel monster story.\n\nINCREDIBLE HULK #323 (Marvel, 1986) – “Certain Intangibles,” [W/A] Al Milgrom. Just a few issues after Bruce and the Hulk were physically separated, the Vision has to use his phasing powers to reunite them again. This issue is actually more of a Vision story than a Hulk story. The key conflict is that to save the Hulk, Vizh has to leave Wanda, who’s about to give birth. This issue is one of the few times that Wanda’s pregnancy was referenced outside her own series.\n\nINVINCIBLE IRON MAN #523 (Marvel, 2012) – “Swarm,” [W] Matt Fraction, [A] Salvador Larroca. Tony is forced to collaborate with the Mandarin and Ezekiel Stane in producing “Titanomechs.” Matt Fraction was probably the best Iron Man writer since David Michelinie, yet his Iron Man stories don’t excite me very much, perhaps because his version of Tony is unsympathetic. This story arc was one of the last major Mandarin stories. In more recent years, Marvel has used Zheng Zu as a replacement for both the Mandarin and Fu Manchu, since both characters are examples of the same Yellow Peril stereotype.\n\nDESOLATION JONES #4 (Wildstorm, 2006) – “Made in England Part 4,” [W] Warren Ellis, [A] J.H. Williams III. This series was JHW3’s follow-up to Promethea, but it wasn’t nearly as good as Promethea. JHW3’s art in “Made in England” is spectacular, but Ellis’s story is full of unnecessary violence and machismo, and lacks an interesting premise. After Williams left with issue 6, Desolation Jones only lasted two more issues.\n\nFOOLKILLER #5 (Marvel, 1991) – “Body Count,” [W] Steve Gerber, [A] J.J. Birch. I collected this entire series while I was still in grad school, and I had ambitious plans of reading the whole thing at one sitting. But I only got as far as issue four, and the remaining six issues have been gathering dust in my boxes of unread comics for over a decade. I finally decided to read them. There were three versions of the Foolkiller, all created by Gerber. All of them had the gimmick of killing people they considered fools. The first Foolkiller was introduced in Man-Thing #3 and was killed in the next issue. The second one appeared in Omega the Unknown #8-9. He reappears in the Foolkiller miniseries, where, from prison, he influences a third man to take up the identity. In Foolkiller #5, the third Foolkiller, Kurt Gerhardt, invades a crack house and murders a bunch of people. A serious problem with this series is its racism. All the black and brown people in the series are drug dealers or sex workers, and in this issue it’s even implied that some of the Foolkiller’s targets/victims are illiterate. We will see some additional problems as the series goes on.\n\nFOOLKILLER #6 (Marvel, 1991) – “Fool’s Paradise,” as above. In Kurt’s civilian life, his coworker at his fast food job becomes a potential love interest, and he takes a new job running credit reports. A recurring theme in this series, as in much of Gerber’s earlier works, is the soul-crushing nature of the Reagan-Bush economy. In his vigilante identity, Kurt kills some more drug dealers, including a woman with a newborn baby. His excuse for killing her is “I want to incinerate the kind of mother who would subject it [the baby] to this life.” This is an example of the limitations of Kurt’s mentality: he fails to consider the kind of social conditions that have forced her to have this baby and raise it in a crack house. And now that the baby is orphaned, it may grow up in an even worse situation. Kurt’s strategy of murdering fools does nothing to solve the bigger problems that produce fools. What happens next is even worse, as Kurt murders a child. This is an inexcusable act, even though the child threw a knife at Kurt first. At this point I not only lost all sympathy for Kurt, I actively wanted him to die.\n\nFOOLKILLER #7 (Marvel, 1991) – “Who the Fools Are,” as above. After last issue, Kurt contemplates suicide, but regrettably decides against it. Instead he goes to a bar, and on the way back, he encounters a pimp beating a sex worker. Kurt beats up the pimp, but the sex worker defends him by hitting Kurt from behind, and Kurt kills them both. Here again we see that Kurt is just a horrible villain, even more so than the Punisher. It’s very common for abused women to defend their abusers, because one of the effects of abuse is that it causes the victim to feel an undeserved loyalty to the abuser. To punish an abused woman for defending her abuser is to blame the victim.\n\nUNCANNY X-MEN #400 (Marvel, 2001) – “Supreme Confessions,” [W] Joe Casey, [A] Ashley Wood. This issue is a single long story which is illustrated by six different artists, in widely clashing styles. Some of the artists use a standard Marvel house style, while Ashley Wood’s pages are painted in a sepia-toned, expressionistic style. One of the six artists is Eddie Campbell, but I had difficulty even figuring out which pages he did, because Marvel’s computer coloring sucks all the life out of his art. As for what this comic is about, I really don’t know. I can’t stand Joe Casey’s writing. I wish I could read Dynamite’s upcoming Jonny Quest series, but I can’t, since Casey is writing it.\n\nSUPERMAN #305 (DC, 1976) – “The Man Who Toyed with Death,” [W] Martin Pasko, [A] Curt Swan. In an earlier story, the Toyman’s identity was usurped by a man named Jack Nimball (I assume his middle initial was B). This issue, the original Toyman, Winslow Schott, murders Nimball and then builds a giant robot to battle Superman. At the end of the issue Bizarro intervenes in Superman and Schott’s fight. This issue was just average.\n\nANNIHILATOR #6 (Legendary, 2015) – untitled, [W] Grant Morrison, [A] Frazer Irving. This comic makes no sense at all. It’s even more confusing than other Grant Morrison comics. It seems to be some kind of a metatextual story about screenwriting, which would make it reminiscent of Animal Man #26, but that story was much clearer and more understandable. Frazer Irving’s art, as always, is beautiful, but it’s wasted on Morrison’s non-story.\n\nBATMAN ’66 #25 (DC, 2015) – “Night of the Harlequin,” [W] Jeff Parker, [A] Lukas Ketner. Batman and Robin fight the Batman ’66 version of Harley Quinn. This story is funny, but there’s nothing to distinguish it from any other issue of Batman ’66. The backup story is at least partially intended as a parody of Mad Men. All the major villains decide to team up and take over an ad agency, so as to improve their public image, but their plot fails because they can’t agree on which of them should be in charge.\n\nSECRET SIX #4 (DC, 2015) – “Friends in Low Places,” [W] Gail Simone, [A] Ken Lashley & Tom Derenick. The protagonists travel to the suburban town where the next few issues are set. On arriving, they’re attacked by three people in masks. The three reveal themselves as Scandal Savage, Jeanette, and Ragdoll, the remnants of the pre-New 52 version of the Secret Six. I’ve always had mixed feelings about Gail’s work, but I look forward to her upcoming X-Men series.\n\nKAIJUMAX #4 (Oni, 2015) – “Mutated Out,” [W/A] Zander Cannon. I can’t remember anything that happened in this particular issue, and I dislike this series in general. Kaijumax’s premise– a prison drama about monsters – is the sort of thing that’s only funny the first time, and Zander Cannon’s cartoonish style is inappropriate for depicting monsters. Zander Cannon was at Heroes Con, but I didn’t talk to him.\n\nTHE HUMANS #6 (Image, 2015) – untitled, [W] Keenan Marshall Keller, [A] Tom Neely. This is a typical issue of The Humans, except that it includes a scene where one of the bikers hallucinates that he’s back in Vietnam. The Humans is a very effective tribute to ‘70s underground comics, especially the work of Spain. However, its characters are all very similar, and none of them are sympathetic. Keller and Neely were both at Heroes Con, but I think I only spoke to Keller. I told him that I was enjoying Vengeance is for the Living, and that it reminded me of Carol Clover’s Men, Women and Chainsaws, which I had just read. I believe he recognized what I was referring to.\n\nFOOLKILLER #8 (Marvel, 1991) – “42 Days,” as above. While the first Gulf War is going on, the Foolkiller continues his crusade and murders some more people who don’t deserve to die. There’s also a subplot about a real estate developer named Darren Waite. This character is based on Donald Trump, who I really don’t want to think about right now, since I’m writing this two days after the first presidential debate. This issue also includes a gratuitous guest appearance by Spider-Man, who is featured on the cover but plays no essential role in the plot.\n\nFOOLKILLER #9 (Marvel, 1991) – “Feast of Fools,” as above. The Foolkiller tries to kill a drug dealer named Backhand, but fails. He does succeed in killing Darren Waite, which almost makes up for all the awful things he’s done. This issue also includes a talk show host named Runyan Moody who’s a parody of either Morton Downey Jr or G. Gordon Liddy.\n\nFOOLKILLER #10 (Marvel, 1991) – “Fools Rush In,” as above. Kurt kills Runyan Moody, and then he murders a college dean who has just expelled a student for a “politically incorrect” joke. This scene is another low point in the series. We are never told just why the student was expelled, although it’s hinted that the student may have called someone an anti-LGBTQ slur. Therefore, we can’t determine whether the dean’s decision was right or wrong, and even if he was wrong, he didn’t deserve to be killed. This scene just feels like a knee-jerk reaction to “political correctness,” which, then as now, just meant treating people decently. After that, Kurt goes on a suicide mission against Mendoza, the drug lord who’s supplying Backhand. To my great disappointment, Kurt kills Mendoza and survives. He gets a new fake ID which depicts him as resembling Richard Rory, although I didn’t get this reference until I saw someone else mention it. In the 2016 Foolkiller miniseries, published after Gerber’s death, Kurt was killed by his predecessor Greg Salinger. Overall, Foolkiller was one of Gerber’s less impressive works. Its “hero” is a loathsome villain, and its politics are reactionary and vague. The main problem is that Kurt has no clear definition of who counts as a fool, and so he feels justified in killing anybody he doesn’t like. He’s not a vigilante, he’s a serial killer.\n\nJONAH HEX #59 (DC, 2010) – “Riders on the Storm,” [W] Justin Gray & Jimmy Palmiotti, [A] Jordi Bernet. While trying to collect a bounty, Jonah discovers that his target is in a standoff with his own brother, stemming from the brother’s forbidden romance with a Comanche woman. The situation gets even more volatile due to the arrival of the Gray Ghost, a vigilante who hunts people he sees as traitors to the Confederacy – including Jonah himself. In the ensuing gunfight, the Comanche woman gets fridged. Bernet is a world-class artist, but his style does not mesh well with computer coloring.\n\nTHOR #285 (Marvel, 1979) – “Deviants and Doormen!”, [W] Roy Thomas, [A] John Buscema. This is more of an Eternals story than a Thor story. While searching for Sersi, Thor gets in an unnecessary fight with the Deviant Karkas, and then there’s a long flashback about Karkas’s encounter with Ikaris and Thena. Karkas and his partner Rejekt have had some very funny scenes in Rainbow Rowell’s She-Hulk.\n\nINCREDIBLE HULK #227 (Marvel, 1978) – “The Monster’s Analyst,” [W] Roger Stern w/ Peter B. Gillis, [A] Sal Buscema. Doc Samson sedates the Hulk and uses a machine to view the Hulk’s dreams. Inside the Hulk’s mind, Samson witnesses the Hulk’s childhood and early career. This issue is sort of a prototype for two very important later stories – Hulk #312 and #377 – though it doesn’t go nearly as deep into the Hulk’s psychology as those stories do. I was very sorry to hear that Peter Gillis passed away. I never met him in person, but I was in contact with him on Facebook, and he seemed like a very intelligent and thoughtful man. Strikeforce: Morituri was an early favorite of mine, and he wrote some of the best What If?s ever.\n\nNAMESAKE #3 (Boom!, 2017) – untitled, [W] Steve Orlando, [A] Jakub Rebelka. I couldn’t entirely follow this comic’s plot, but it seems to be a gay-themed urban fantasy about a protagonist who’s trying to rediscover his past. This comic’s premise is interesting, and Jakub Rebelka’s artwork is very vivid. His art is similar to Michael Dialynas’s, especially in terms of the color palette. I also bought the trade paperback of this series, though maybe that was a mistake, since I prefer to collect comic books in single-issue form.\n\nTHUNDERBOLTS #26 (Marvel, 1999) – “Lockdown,” [W] Joe Casey, [A] Leonardo Manco. Abner Jenkins is involved in an unsuccessful prison break. This appears to be an inventory story, since only the framing sequence is by the usual team of Busiek and Bagley. Casey’s story is of no interest. Leonardo Manco’s art is detailed and moody, but he seems to be more interested in drawing pretty pictures rather than telling a story. On his fourth page and again on his final page, there are very detailed drawings of characters who are irrelevant to the plot. Also, he makes the Rhino look way too thin.\n\nSUPERGIRL #9 (DC, 1997) – “Tempus Fugit,” [W] Peter David, [A] Gary Frank. Supergirl fights a devil who wields two sickles. I’ve never really liked this series, and I think the reason is that it’s not a Supergirl comic at all, except in name. It’s more similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than to any other Supergirl comic before or since. The proof of this is that PAD later continued his Supergirl run as a creator-owned series, Fallen Angel, which had no connection to the Superman mythos.\n\nDC COMICS BOMBSHELLS #20 (DC, 2017) – “Men Who Would Be Kings,” [W] Marguerite Bennett, [A] Marguerite Sauvage, Mirka Andolfo & Laura Braga. The opening sequence in this issue stars Vixen and is inspired by Jesse Owens’s performance at the 1936 Olympics. Other than that, this is just a typical issue of DC Comics Bombshells. I dislike this series because first, Marguerite Bennett’s writing style is annoying, and second, the plot never seems to make any progress; the war never gets any closer to its conclusion.\n\nUNCANNY VALLEY #2 (Boom!, 2024) – untitled, [W] Tony Fleecs, [A] Dave Wachter. While driving through the desert, Oliver and his grandfather encounter “Dingo” (Wile E. Coyote), who knocks them off of a cliff. They survive by taking advantage of the canyon fall gag, then they escape the coyote thanks to the painted tunnel gag. This is another hilarious issue of what is probably my favorite new comic of the year. Again, the jokes are made possible thanks to Dave Wachter’s ability to draw in both realistic and cartoon styles within the same panel, and to distinguish the two styles from each other. Wachter was supposed to be at Heroes Con, but he cancelled.\n\nTRANSFORMERS #8 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Daniel Warren Johnson, [A] Jorge Corona. This issue is less intense than earlier ones, consisting largely of dialogue scenes, though there is a shocking moment where Soundwave murders some shipwrecked people. There’s also a subplot taking place on Cybertron, whose significance is not clear until next issue. Throughout this series we’ve been seeing that the Decepticons, besides Starscream, are not just evil for evil’s sake; they do have actual goals, though they achieve those goals by evil means. I met Daniel Warren Johnson briefly at Heroes Con, while waiting for my pro badge. I thanked him for saving the comics industry, at least temporarily. He’s been to Heroes Con before, but I didn’t meet him because his line was always too long.\n\nUSAGI YOJIMBO: THE CROW #2 (Dark Horse, 2024) – “The Crow Part 2,” [W/A] Stan Sakai. Yukichi is kidnapped by some bounty hunters who mistakenly think he’s a rival for Jimmu’s bounty. Yukichi argues with the lead bounty hunter, and the bounty hunter breaks Yukichi’s sword and delivers it to Usagi. As revealed in the next issue, this bounty hunter is Inuyoshi from issue 127 of the previous Dark Horse series. I had forgotten all about that story, but a rereading of it makes it clear why Inuyoshi is so cynical about samurai honor.\n\nDARK RIDE #12 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Joshua Williamson, [A] Andrei Bressan. Halloween fulfills her family’s pact with the devil by murdering her own father. Arthur’s late wife rises from the dead and drags Arthur down to hell. Halloween inherits Arthur’s ownership of Devil Land, as well as his curse. Things end happily for the other characters. This series was much shorter than its creators’ previous collaboration, Birthright, but it was equally entertaining.\n\nAIN’T NO GRAVE #1 (Image, 2024) – “Denial,” [W] Skottie Young, [A] Jorge Corona. In an Old West world, the legendary outlaw Ryder has retired from her life of crime to become a mother, but now she’s terminally ill. Refusing to accept her fate, she instead travels to the underworld to kill Death. This looks like it will be just as good as these creators’ previous collaborations, Middlewest and The Me You Love in the Dark. As a Western comic about the incarnation of Death, Ain’t No Grave reminds me of Pretty Deadly, except that I hated Pretty Deadly, and I like Ain’t No Grave much better. Skottie was at Heroes Con, but he was constantly mobbed, and I didn’t get a chance to talk to him.\n\nLOVE & ROCKETS #15 (Fantagraphics, 2024) – [W/A] Gilbert Hernandez and Jaime Hernandez. The best story in this issue is Jaime’s “Latter Daze,” in which Maggie has to conquer her fear of the ocean because she thinks Tonta is drowning. The other Jaime stories are set in his science fiction milieu. One of the Gilbert stories is set in Palomar and includes appearances by Chelo and Diana Villaseñor.\n\nTHE DEVIANT #5 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] James Tynion IV, [A] Joshua Hixson. In a flashback scene set in 1999, Michael and a friend sneak into the original serial killer’s house. There’s only one brief scene set in the present day, and it doesn’t advance the plot. This kind of feels like a waste of an issue. #6, to be reviewed below, was much more interesting.\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR #20 (Marvel, 2024) – “To Work Wonders,” [W] Ryan North, [A] Carlos Gomez. Ben and Johnny both get jobs at the same grocery store, and they compete with each other to be named Cashier of the Month. But when a tabloid reporter visits the store looking for dirt on Johnny, Ben gives a speech in which he praises Johnny as “one ‘a the best men I know.” This issue is funny, and Ben’s climactic speech is a touching moment. This issue reminds me of Fantastic Four #61 from Mark Waid’s run, but it kind of goes in the opposite direction, examining Ben and Johnny’s mutual respect instead of their rivalry.\n\nBIRDS OF PREY #9 (DC, 2024) – “Worlds Without End Part 1,” [W] Kelly Thompson, [A] Jonathan Case & Gavin Guidry. After passing through the portal at the end of last issue, the BoP are trapped in a black-and-white horror dimension, while back on earth, Meridian and Zealot try to find their teammates. I’ve more or less forgotten this issue’s story already, but Jordie Bellaire’s coloring is very striking. I like the contrasting color schemes between the scenes in the real world and the scenes in the alternate dimension.\n\nTHE BOY WONDER #1 (DC, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Juni Ba. Robin (but it’s not clear which Robin) has been captured by an unidentified criminal. To pass the time, Robin tells the kidnapper a story in which Damian teams up with Nightwing and Batgirl to fight Clayface. This is a typical Robin story, but it’s narrated as if it were a fairy tale, and it’s drawn in the same style as Monkey Meat and Djeliya. The Boy Wonder is another fascinating work from a very talented and original artist. It doesn’t include any explicit African references that I noticed, but it might still be considered an Africanfuturist work because of its resemblance to Juni Ba’s earlier work.\n\nSPACE GHOST #1 (Dynamite, 2024) – untitled, [W] David Pepose, [A] Jonathan Lau. I bought this because I like Space Ghost as a character, though there are very few good comics about him – there’s the 1987 Comico special, Future Quest, and nothing else. This first issue is narrated from the perspective of Space Ghost’s sidekicks Jan and Jace, who are on the run from villains trying to steal their murdered father’s research. This comic has a somewhat grim tone, though it’s not inappropriate for children. I enjoyed this issue enough that I bought the next one, but I had a more negative reaction to issue two, and I’m not sure if I want to continue with this series or not. See below.\n\nBENEATH THE TREES WHERE NOBODY SEES #6 (IDW, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Patrick Horvath. Samantha returns to town, murders Nigel and his mother, and frames Nigel for both his own murders and the ones Samantha herself committed. This is a satisfying resolution, though I feel weird saying that, since Samantha herself is just as awful as Nigel. I suppose the whole point of this comic is that it forces us to feel sympathy for a loathsome murderer. Beneath the Trees… was one of the best miniseries of the past year, though I didn’t vote it for it in the Eisners.\n\nMS. MARVEL: MUTANT MENACE #3 (Marvel, 2024) – “Reunions,” [W] Iman Vellani & Sabir Pirzada, [A] Scott Godlewski. Kamala and Red Dagger fight some zombie clones of the X-Men, while trying to keep their own hormones under control. This issue was too much like every other story with Red Dagger, and so far this miniseries has been less enjoyable than the previous one. The Inhumans appear at the end of the issue.\n\nI HATE FAIRYLAND #14 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Skottie Young, [A] Brett Bean. Gert and her two companions encounter a horde of Gertlins, who previously appeared in issue 3 of this series. At this point I Hate Fairyland volume 2 is just rehashing the formula from volume 1, but it’s a successful formula. And Skottie is challenging himself enough, with series like Ain’t No Grave, that he can be forgiven for not trying something more original with I Hate Fairyland.\n\nNEXUS: THE NEWSPAPER STRIPS VOL. 2: BATTLE FOR THUNEWORLD #1 (Rude Dude, 2024) – [W/A] Steve Rude. Nexus used to be one of my favorite comics, but its co-creator, Mike Baron, has become a loathsome, reactionary bigot. The only reason I can read this new Nexus comic is that Baron isn’t involved with it (he’s doing his own independent version of Nexus). The trouble is that Steve Rude is not nearly as talented a writer as Baron. His artwork in these strips is gorgeous, though it’s reproduced too small to see the fine details. But Rude’s plots are aimless and rambling, and he lacks Baron’s clever and distinctive prose style. This comic is still worth reading, but the truly great Nexus stories are in the past, as is Baron’s credibility.\n\nSHAZAM! #11 (DC, 2024) – “Moving Day Part 2,” [W] Josie Campbell, [A] Emanuela Lupacchino. A CPS worker visits the Batson house, and the Marvels have to fight off an invasion by anthropomorphic bats, while preventing the CPS worker from noticing anything unusual. Although they succeed at these tasks, the CPS worker refuses to approve Billy and his siblings’ adoption, because Billy’s biological mother wants him back. And she appears in person on the last page. This issue begins with a flashback where Billy’s biological mother abandons him at school, and then when she finally picks him up, she scolds Billy for telling a teacher that he was abandoned. Her rant makes it clear that she fears her abusive boyfriend more than she cares about her son. Just like last issue, this issue feels like a very realistic account of life as a foster child. To my surprise, this series is just as good now as when Mark Waid was writing it.\n\nPOISON IVY #22 (DC, 2024) – “Chapter 22,” [W] G. Willow Wilson, [A] Haining. Now that the three-issue flashback is over, we’re back to the present. Ivy fights Woodrue in the swamp, while Croc tries to protect Janet-from-HR from zombies. This issue has some striking and detailed artwork, but the Janet scenes are more interesting than the Ivy scenes.\n\n<!– wp:paragraph\n\nNIGHT LIBRARIAN FCBD 2024 – untitled, [W/A] Christopher Lincoln. A preview of an upcoming graphic novel. The excerpt provided is chapter four, so the reader has to infer what’s happened in the earlier chapters. I like the idea of a story about magical libraries, but this comic doesn’t do anything new or original with that idea, and I don’t plan to read the full version of the graphic novel.\n\nBEAR PIRATE VIKING QUEEN #1 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Sean Lewis, [A] Jonathan Marks Barravecchia. I bought this just because of the title. This comic definitely has bears, pirates and Vikings in it, but I’m not sure how they’re all connected, as the comic’s plot is rather incomprehensible. Marks Barravecchia’s painted art is intriguing, reminding me of Sienkiewicz. I liked this comic enough that I’ll finish reading this miniseries.\n\nSPECTREGRAPH #1 (DSTLRY, 2024) – untitled, [W] James Tynion IV, [A] Christian Ward. Janie, a real estate agent and single mother, abandons her infant child at home to attend a house showing. The house turns out to be some kind of eldrich monstrosity, and Janie gets trapped in there. A possible flaw with this comic is that at the very beginning of the story, Janie forfeits the reader’s sympathy by abandoning her child. It’s clear that she had to choose between her baby and her job, but it’s equally clear that she made the wrong choice. The horror premise is interesting, and it feels like a logical development from the architectural themes of Nice House on the Lake. Christian Ward’s artwork is spectacular, especially at the larger page size. I did not get issue 2, but I will see if Heroes can order it.\n\nBATMAN: THE DARK AGE #2 (DC, 2024) – untitled, [W] Mark Russell, [A] Mike Allred. Bruce has his prison sentence commuted in exchange for serving in Vietnam, where he’s trained by Ra’s al Ghul. Bruce returns to Gotham, which has become even more of a shithole than usual, and begins his career as Batman. This issue is entertaining, and feels historically accurate, though its depiction of the law is another matter. On that point see my review of #3 below.\n\nTEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES #150 (IDW, 2024) – untitled, [W] Sophie Campbell, [A] Vincenzo Federici & Fero Pe. Sophie Campbell’s TMNT run ends not with a bang but a whimper. There’s a cute moment at the end where Donatello is reunited with the now-demutated Lita, but otherwise this issue, like the entire Armaggon storyline, is confusing and impenetrable. 50 issues is an extremely long run these days, and Sophie Campbell succeeded in making me care about this franchise for the first time since the ‘90s. But I think it’s time for her to step aside, and I’m looking forward to the upcoming Jason Aaron run. It’s too bad that Sophie didn’t draw any of this issue.\n\nSCARLET WITCH AND QUICKSILVER #3 (Marvel, 2024) – untitled, [W] Steve Orlando, [A] Lorenzo Tammetta. Wanda and Vizh fight the Wizard’s troops, and Speed also appears. This comic isn’t amazing, but it’s an entertaining and quick read with nice art, and I’m a big fan of Wanda. The Wizard’s characterization in this series is completely wrong; he’s supposed to be a cynical profiteer, not a passionate zealot, and he’s not supposed to meddle with supernatural forces.\n\nUNIVERSAL MONSTERS: CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON LIVES! #1 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Dan Watters & Ram V, [A] Matthew Roberts. Kate, an American journalist, was nearly murdered by a serial killer she was investigating. Now she follows his trail to the Brazilian Amazon, where she’s saved from drowning by a swamp monster. Unlike the previous Universal Monsters miniseries, this series is not an adaptation but an original story, and it’s an intriguing one. I talked to Matthew Roberts at Heroes Con. Until then, I didn’t quite realize that this Universal Monsters series was drawn by the same artist as Manifest Destiny.\n\nLESTER OF THE LESSER GODS #1 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Eric Powell & Lucky Yates, [A] Gideon Kendall. This miniseries is a follow-up to a one-shot that was published by the now-defunct Albatross. Lester of the Lesser Gods is a very silly parody of the sword-and-sorcery genre, with a fat hero who wears only a helmet, boots and a thong. The joke is that, much like The Goon, Lester of the Lesser Gods is narrated in an entirely deadpan style. It doesn’t try to be too funny, and that makes it all the funnier. Gideon Kendall was at Heroes Con, but I didn’t speak to him.\n\nSUPERMAN: HOUSE OF BRAINIAC SPECIAL #1 (DC, 2024) – “House of Brainiac 2.5, Chapter One: Secrets of Czarnia,” [W] Joshua Williamson, [A] Edwin Galmon, etc. The first and third chapters of this one-shot are about the Coluans’ dealings with the Czarnians and Amanda Waller. The central chapter, which is much better, is about Bibbo’s debate with xenophobic mayoral candidate Garon Blake. This story is written by Mark Russell, and it shows his usual sensitive understanding of politics. Like much of his work, it’s very cynical but ends with a touch of hope.\n\nKILL YOUR DARLINGS #6 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Ethan S. Parker & Griffin Sheridan, [A] Bob Quinn. I thought I had dropped this series from my pull list, but this issue was in my file anyway. Kill Your Darlings is just a generic horror comic with nothing particularly new or original about it. If there’s a second story arc, I won’t be buying it.\n\nG.O.D.S. #7 (Marvel, 2024) – “Signal to Noise,” [W] Jonathan Hickman, [A] Valerio Schiti. I have no idea what happened in this issue. From a promising start, G.O.D.S. has become a confusing, pointless mess. Mia, the only interesting character in the series, has been totally forgotten. Whatever Hickman planned to achieve in this series, he seems to have given up on it. I’m glad this is the second-to-last issue.\n\nBLOW AWAY #1 (Boom!, 2024) – untitled, [W] Zac Thompson, [A] Nicola Izzo. I’m not sure why I ordered this series, because I haven’t been enjoying Zac Thompson’s work very much. His comics are heavily reliant on a type of body horror that doesn’t appeal to me. The only one of his series that I really liked was No One’s Rose. However, Blow Away does have an interesting premise. Brynne Brautigan, a wildlife photographer, travels to Baffin Island in the Arctic to try to document an endangered species. While there, she witnesses one mountain climber murdering another. Blow Away’s plot resembles that of Rear Window, while its setting is similar to that of Rucka and Leiber’s Whiteout, and that’s a promising combination.\n\nEDGE OF SPIDER-VERSE #3 (Marvel, 2024) – “A Star (Spider) is Born,” [W] Justina Ireland, [A] Pete Woods. I enjoyed Justina Ireland’s young adult novel Dread Nation, but her Star-Spider story in Edge of Spider-Verse #3 is unimpressive. It’s just a generic superhero story with a science-fictional setting that plays no major role in the plot. Also, I was distracted by trying to translate the alien text. I did enjoy Pete Woods’s art. The backup story, written by Steve Foxe, is actually slightly more interesting, since it depicts a world where Harry Osborn is Spider-Man and Peter Parker is his assistant.\n\nTHE SCALE TRADE #1 (Magma, 2024) – untitled, [W] Steve Orlando, [A] Megan Huang. In a world that’s like our own, except with dragons, the Dragon Conservation Agency is dedicated to stopping the illegal trade in dragon body parts. When writing this review I had to skim this comic to remind myself what it was about. Megan Huang has established a unique niche for herself as an artist of cute kaiju stories, and The Scale Trade is an intriguing blend of the kaiju and police procedural genres. This series is reminiscent of James Patrick’s Kaiju Score.\n\nORCS! THE GIFT #3 (Boom!, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Christine Larsen. I don’t think I ever received issue 2. This issue is devoted to setting up the big confrontation between the various tribes and the evil curse or whatever it is. There’s one subplot where the evil wizard’s ghost is trying to affect the material world, and another major theme is Pez and Utzu’s rivalry. I always enjoy Orcs, but this issue has so many different plots going on that it lacks a central theme or point.\n\nMAD MAGAZINE SPECIAL EDITION 2024 (DC, 2024) – [W/A] various. This FCBD strip is a collection of reprinted Mad Magazine strips about DC superheroes. There are some classic strips by artists like Sergio Aragonés and Don Martin, and some newer material by Kerry Callen. Most of the Callen strips were familiar to me since I’ve already seen them on Facebook. It’s been a long time since I’ve read Mad, but I’ve acquired almost all of DC’s magazine-format reprints of the original Mad comic books, and I need to read them soon. I feel like my ignorance of the classic Mad comic books is a big gap in my comics knowledge.\n\nTHE BLOODY DOZEN #5 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Charles Soule, [A] Alberto Jimenez Alburquerque. The issue starts with a flashback sequence, and then in the present day, the granddaughter gets turned into a vampire. She kills the mother, but the grandfather activates the ship’s self-destruct protocol. I spoke to Charles Soule at Heroes Con and told him how much I enjoyed Eight Billion Genies. I didn’t tell him that I haven’t been enjoying The Shrouded College quite as much.\n\nDAWNRUNNER #2 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Ram V, [A] Evan Cagle. Anita is benched after her mecha shuts down in the middle of a fight with a kaiju. She disobeys orders and activates her mecha again, and is projected back into the memories of Ichiro Takeda, whose brain was used to produce the mecha. Evan Cagle’s draftsmanship in this series is brilliant, but his fight scenes are difficult to parse. In particular, it’s hard to tell where the Dawnrunner’s arms and legs are.\n\nGANNIBAL FCBD (Ablaze, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Masaaki Ninomiya. A cop takes a new job at a remote Japanese village. To his horror, he quickly realizes that everyone in the village is part of some kind of murder conspiracy, and if he does anything about it, he’ll be killed. This seems like a promising horror comic, and Ninomiya’s artwork is much more detailed and expressonistic than is typical for manga. However, it’s unlikely that I’ll read any more of Gannibal, just because there are so many other manga that interest me more.\n\nGODZILLA: WAR FOR HUMANITY #5 (IDW, 2024) – untitled, [W] Andrew MacLean, [A] Jake Smith. The heroine finally defeats Zoospora by destroying it at its source, and she’s reunited with her daughter. This was a fun series with cute artwork. I talked with Andrew MacLean at Heroes Con.\n\nFCBD 2024: ALL AGES (Dark Horse, 2024) – Star Wars Young Jedi Adventures: “Sky Parade Rescue,” [W] Daniel José Older, [A] Andy Duggan. A silly story about young Jedi cadets. There’s also a Plants vs. Zombies backup story, which is a waste of writer Paul Tobin’s talents. Plants vs. Zombies (like Angry Birds) is not suitable for adaptation into comics because it lacks a plot.\n\nPROJECT: CRYPTID #8 (Ahoy, 2024) – “Devil’s Advocate,” [W] Deron Bennett, [A] Steve Ellis. The Jersey Devil files a lawsuit to make the New Jersey Devils change its name. This is kind of a funny idea, although the late Batton Lash could have done a better story with this premise. In the backup story, the Skunk Ape becomes a candidate for governor of Florida. He would certainly be better than the current governor.\n\nRISE OF THE POWERS OF X #4 (Marvel, 2024) – “Sentinel X,” [W] Kieron Gillen, [A] R.B. Silva. In this issue there’s some kind of an epic struggle between Enigma and the Phoenix. I’ve gotten thoroughly sick of this series since it began, and I’m only reading it out of a misplaced sense of loyalty to Gillen.\n\nX-MEN FOREVER #2 (Marvel, 2024) – “Quiet Council,” [W] Kieron Gillen, [A] Luca Maresca. This issue isn’t much better than Rise of the Powers of X #4. If I understood correctly, the main plot development in this issue is that the non-combat mutants get to stay in an extradimensional version of Krakoa, so Krakoa still exists, but without any of the characters we care about.\n\nOPERATION SUNSHINE: ALREADY DEAD #1 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Henry Zebrowski & Marcus Parks, [A] David Rubín. A confusing, uninteresting, and poorly explained story about vampires. This issue is numbered 1, but it makes no sense to a reader who hasn’t read the previous Operation Sunshine miniseries. And even if I had read them, I don’t think I would have liked this comic much. It seems rather similar to American Vampire and Redneck, neither of which was a favorite of mine. I was buying this comic exclusively because of David Rubín’s art, and his art is good, but it’s not good enough to justify the price of the comic. I won’t be getting issue 2.\n\nDAREDEVIL #8 (Marvel, 2024) – “Introductory Rites,” [W] Saladin Ahmed, [A] Aaron Kuder. In this issue’s main story, Matt and Elektra defeat Bullseye, but then he’s set free by corrupt cops, and the Kingpin reasserts his control over Hell’s Kitchen. This issue also includes four backup stories, two of which are by previous Daredevil writers. None of these four stories are much good, and I’m not fond of either D.G. Chichester or Ann Nocenti’s Daredevil to begin with. The initial edition of this issue had a printing error in which 16 pages were left out. The omitted material included the last three pages of the cover gallery; the entire Elsa Sjunneson story; and the first page of the Ann Nocenti story. I received the incorrect version of the issue, but I later also received a corrected version for free. The story that was left out of the first printing is probably the best of the four.\n\nCEMETERY KIDS DON’T DIE #3 (Oni, 2024) – untitled, [W] Zac Thompson, [A] Daniel Irizarri. Just more of the same plots as last issue, with no new or surprising developments. I said in an above review that Zac Thompson’s work is reliant on a type of body horror that I don’t enjoy, and Cemetery Kids Don’t Die is an example of that. It’s at least his second series where the plot relies on a piece of Cronenbergian flesh technology.\n\nSHOWCASE #22 (DC, 1959/2004) – “SOS Green Lantern,” [W] John Broome, [A] Gil Kane. I already had the Silver Age Classics reprint of this issue, but the facsimile edition also includes the original ads, making it a strict upgrade to the Silver Age Classics edition. Showcase #22 introduces the Silver Age Green Lantern, and it’s also the beginning of Hal’s creepy, stalker-ish romance with Carol Ferris. A plot hole in this issue – the fact that Abin Sur used a spaceship when he shouldn’t have needed it – was the inspiration for many years of retcons.\n\nMYTHOLOGIES & APOCRYPHA #1 (Fantagraphics, 2024) – “McQueen & Sinatra in America Part One,” [W/A] Tim Lane. This new series is a follow-up to Lane’s previous solo title, Happy Hour in America, and it continues that series’s obsessive focus on Steve McQueen. In Mythologies and Apocrypha #1, Lane is concerned in particular with McQueen’s relationship with Frank Sinatra. The history recounted in this issue is intriguing, but what’s really stunning about this comic is Lane’s artwork. His rendering of light-dark contrasts is similar to that of Charles Burns, particularly in the night scenes, which have a very stark effect. But Lane’s draftsmanship is even more hyperdetailed than Burns’s. The Junkman story at the end of the issue reminds me of Wally Wood, though I’m not sure just why. This is incredible artwork, though it’s also very labor-intensive.\n\nHARLEY QUINN ANNUAL 2024 (DC, 2024) – “Now You Sea Me… Now You Die!”, [W/A] Erica Henderson. Having stolen a lot of money, Harley decides to go on a cruise. Zatanna happens to be on the same cruise ship, and the two of them have a ridiculous adventure. This issue has very cute art and a hilarious story. I’m not sure if I’ve read anything else that Erica Henderson wrote herself, but she’s a talented writer as well as a superstar artist.\n\nCOUMA ACÒ (L’Association, 1991/2005) – [W/A] Edmond Baudoin. This book was first published in 1991, and won the Angoulême award for best album the following year. It can be considered a graphic memoir, but it’s really more of a biography of the author’s grandfather, John Carney. John, an English-born foundling who grew up in the South of France, is a bizarre man, an itinerant drunk who bathes once a year and wanders around the village singing songs from World War I. But the author depicts him with affection, showing how he represents a sort of provincial French rural life that’s been destroyed by modernity. The title Couma Acò is the equivalent of “comme ci” (“like that”) in Occitan, a language which is rapidly being replaced by standard French. In general this book is a vivid and unflinching but tender portrayal of a very strange old man. The book is illustrated in a black line which is so heavy and messy that it borders on abstraction, but as with Alex Toth, Baudoin’s messy draftsmanship conceals his mastery of composition and anatomy. At times the texture of the original drawing paper is visible through Baudoin’s layers of black ink. Baudoin’s only book translated into English is another autobiographical work, Piero. Baudoin is a major talent and a significant influence on younger French “alternative” cartoonists, and it’s a pity that Anglophone readers don’t have access to more of his work.\n\nMINOR THREATS: THE FASTEST WAY DOWN #2 (Dark Horse, 2024) – “The Haunted and the Lonely,” [W] Patton Oswalt & Jordan Blum, [A] Scott Hepburn. Playtime fends off some more threats to her rule of the city, but her enemies try to kidnap her daughter and her elderly mother. This issue is not bad, but I think The Alternates was better than either of the main Minor Threats miniseries.\n\nEVERYTHING SUCKS: NOAH’S MILLIONS #1 (Silver Sprocket, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Michael Sweater. I think I’ve seen this series at Heroes before, but I didn’t buy it because it was too expensive. In this issue, two anthropomorphic slackers discover a bag full of mob money, then they decide it’s too much trouble, and they throw it away in the river. Then they regret their decision and try to reclaim the money, but it’s too late. This comic sort of reminds me of Caroline Cash’s PeePee PooPoo, in that first, it’s about characters in their late teens and early twenties, and second, it attempts to revive the moribund format of the alternative comic book. Like PeePee PooPoo, Everything Sucks has excellent production values, even including a foil cover. Sweater’s artwork, in the Adventure Time style, is detailed and expressive, and his coloring is extremely vivid. And his coloring is funny. I bought an earlier issue of Everything Sucks at Heroes Con, and I’m going to read it soon. (Addendum: I have read it now; see below.)\n\nGEIGER #1 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Geoff Johns, [A] Gary Frank. After saving a child from a kidnapper, Geiger sits down to read Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian. But the rest of the issue is more like Don Quixote, as Geiger is approached by a crazy old man wearing a suit of armor, who wants to join Geiger on a quest. This issue includes several touching scenes that reference Geiger’s trauma over the loss of his own children.\n\nTHE FORGED #7 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Greg Rucka, [A] Mike Henderson. The protagonists have to collaborate with some other Forged teams to to investigate the alien threat in the Skull Nebula. The most memorable part of this issue is the bickering between Victory and the other Forged captains. I bought issue 8 of this series a while ago, but I haven’t read it yet. My principal problem with this series is the massive amount of uninteresting text at the end of each issue. Also, like Lazarus, The Forged takes place in a world that’s so bleak and dystopian as to be uninteresting to read about. Mike Henderson was at Heroes Con, but I didn’t speak to him. Greg Rucka was supposed to be at Heroes Con too, but I don’t recall seeing him. I’d have liked to ask him if there’ll ever be another issue of Black Magick.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS, I’M ALREADY DEAD #3 (Dark Horse, 2024) – untitled, [W] Matt Kindt, [A] Dan McDaid. The other human survivor is revealed to be the villain of the story, and Robin has to take control of a giant alien god in order to defeat him. This issue is rather Kirbyesque, and the alien gods are clearly reminiscent of the Celestials. Dan McDaid’s artwork here is quite good. I talked to Matt Kindt briefly at Heroes Con. I told him that I think Subgenre is the key to all of his work, but that I’m not sure just how.\n\nSTORIES FROM THE ATLAS COMICS LIBRARY: FCBD 2024 #1 (Fantagraphics, 2024) – “The Raving Maniac,” [W] Stan Lee, [A] Joe Maneely, etc. A collection of pre-Code Atlas stories spanning various genres, with art by Colan, Maneely, Everett and Wolverton. All these stories are fascinating and beautifully drawn, and together they make the case that Atlas was comparable in quality to EC. The highlight of the issue is Lee and Maneely’s “The Raving Maniac,” a direct response to Wertham and other comics censors. It’s nice to have a chance to read these old Atlas comics, since the original issues are beyond my price range. I talked with Don Rosa at Heroes Con about his collection, and I think he mentioned that Atlas war comics are quite difficult to find.\n\nTHE BRAVE AND THE BOLD #54 (DC, 1964/2024) – “The Thousand-and-One Dooms of Mr. Twister,” [W] Bob Haney, [A] Bruno Premiani. I already read this story in The Greatest Team-Up Stories Ever Told. It’s one of the worst stories in that book, though it’s historically important as the first appearance of the Teen Titans. Mr. Twister is a laughable villain, yet the story depicts him as a serious threat. There’s a cringeworthy moment where the missing teenagers leave a note saying “All us cats decided to skip, until adults to the music get hip,” and Robin realizes it’s a fake because it says “music” instead of “jive.” Bob Haney was only about 38 when he wrote this story, yet it still reads like an old man’s depiction of teenagers. Finally, the three heroes – Kid Flash, Robin and Aqualad – all have the same personality. This last problem was addressed in the second Teen Titans appearance in BOTB #60, where Wonder Girl was added to the team.\n\nOlder comics:\n\nTHE WALKING DEAD #136 (Image, 2015) – “Found,” [W] Robert Kirkman, [A] Charlie Adlard. This issue continues to deal with the aftermath of issue 134, where Carl beat up the bullies who attacked Sophia (not Lydia, as I mistakenly wrote in my review of that issue). In this issue, Carl talks with Lydia in her cell, and meanwhile, Gregory floats the idea of assassinating Maggie, but no one else supports him in this. A problem with The Walking Dead is that most issues are collections of independent scenes, with no central theme.\n\nINCREDIBLE HULK #225 (Marvel, 1978) – “Is There Hulk After Death?”, [W] Roger Stern, [A] Sal Buscema. Bruce falls into a coma, and in order to both save him and defeat the Leader’s plot, Doc Samson has to turn Bruce back into the Hulk. There’s also a brief subplot about Jim Wilson and his traveling companion Kropotkin the Great. This is an entertaining issue, but it feels like a rehash of older Hulk stories.\n\nABBOTT AND COSTELLO #3 (Charlton, 1968) – “The Sound of Noise (A Musical Tragedy)”, [W] Steve Skeates, [A] Henry Scarpelli. An adaptation of Hanna-Barbera’s Abbott and Costello cartoons, which were produced long after the breakup of the Abbott-Costello team and the death of Lou Costello. Some of the stories in this issue are interesting because of their metatextual nature. In particular, “Captain Costello” is a parody of contemporary superhero comics. Steve Skeates’s greatest work for Charlton was his metatextual story “The Best of All Possible Worlds,” in The Many Ghosts of Dr. Graves #5, and some of his Abbott and Costello stories are in the same vein as that story. I’d especially like to get Abbott and Costello #16, which includes a story set at a comic convention.\n\nTINTIN VOL. 12 (Egmont, 1943/1959) – “Red Rackham’s Treasure,” [W/A] Hergé. In a direct sequel to “The Secret of the Unicorn,” Tintin and Haddock go to sea to search for Red Rackham’s buried treasure. Professor Calculus, a new character, stows away on their ship with his experimental submarine. Thanks to the submarine, Tintin finds the wreck of the Unicorn, but the treasure is not there. However, Tintin does find proof that Haddock is the rightful owner of Marlinspike, and after Haddock buys the house with Calculus’s money, Tintin discovers Red Rackham’s treasure in the basement. This album is another demonstration of Hergé’s absolute mastery. It’s full of clever plot twists and funny gags, and the underwater sequences are exciting, especially the scene where Tintin fights a shark. Unlike in Red Rackham’s Treasure, there’s no antagonist (except Calculus briefly), but the plot is thrilling anyway.\n\nSTALKER #3 (DC, 1975) – “The Freezing Flames of the Burning Isle,” [W] Paul Levitz, [A] Steve Ditko w/ Wally Wood. Stalker visits an island ruled by a sorceress who is later revealed to be a harpy. This series was a huge disappointment considering the talent involved. It wasn’t even as good as DC’s other barbarian comics like Beowulf or Claw the Unconquered.\n\nPLANETARY #14 (Wildstorm, 2001) – “Zeropoint,” [W] Warren Ellis, [A] John Cassaday. Elijah discovers Thor’s hammer, which is just one of a number of superhero weapons that the Four have captured from their original owners. This scene is an echo of Miracleman: the Four have an entire pocket dimension full of weapons stretching out indefinitely, just like the Qys have an Underspace full of bodies. Afterward, Planetary battles the Four again, and the Four capture Elijah and subject him to a memory wipe. I assume that Elijah’s last speech – “Don’t you dare come looking for me” and so on – is part of some sort of backup plan, but I’m not sure what that plan is.\n\nHARD TIME #11 (DC, 2005) – “Cruxes,” [W] Steve Gerber, [A] Brian Hurtt. This was Gerber’s last major work, but it wasn’t one of his best. IIRC, I bought the first couple issues when they came out, but I gave up on the series after that. Hard Time is a fantasy or horror story set in a prison, but beyond that, I’m not sure what precisely it’s about, and this issue didn’t make any real impression on me. It did remind me of Foolkiller (see below) because of the prison setting.\n\nMAJOR BUMMER #13 (DC, 1998) – “Been There, Done That,” [W] John Arcudi, [A] Doug Mahnke. Lou’s elderly friend Lauren develops the ability to see into the past, and as a result, the protagonists are caught up in a time travel plot. This series is not a favorite of mine, but it’s funny and well-drawn, and it’s better than other DC comics with a similar style of humor, by which I mostly mean Hitman.\n\nJADEMAN OPENS THE GATES OF THE NIGHT #1 (Jademan, 1990) – “Spirit of the Fire,” [W/A] uncredited. A collection of horror stories set in Hong Kong. I read this because I was curious to see a Chinese take on the horror genre, but this comic is a huge disappointment. First, the translation is so bad that the stories are nearly unreadable. Some of Jademan’s other comics were translated by Mike Baron, so the translations were at least written in idiomatic English, though they weren’t accurate. But in Gates of the Night the translation is both unidiomatic and inaccurate. Second, the stories in this issue are just based on stock Western horror themes, and there’s little influence from traditional Chinese ghost or vampire stories. The most interesting of the stories is the one that’s about an actual statue.\n\nMARVEL MONSTERS: WHERE MONSTERS DWELL #1 (Marvel, 2005) – “Bring On the Bombu!”, [W/A] Keith Giffen, etc. A collection of parodistic stories written in the style of Marvel’s classic monster comics. The other two stories, besides the one by Giffen, are written by Peter David and Jeff Parker, but none of the three stories is particularly interesting. The Jeff Parker story suffers from being too similar to a real Marvel monster story.\n\nINCREDIBLE HULK #323 (Marvel, 1986) – “Certain Intangibles,” [W/A] Al Milgrom. Just a few issues after Bruce and the Hulk were physically separated, the Vision has to use his phasing powers to reunite them again. This issue is actually more of a Vision story than a Hulk story. The key conflict is that to save the Hulk, Vizh has to leave Wanda, who’s about to give birth. This issue is one of the few times that Wanda’s pregnancy was referenced outside her own series.\n\nINVINCIBLE IRON MAN #523 (Marvel, 2012) – “Swarm,” [W] Matt Fraction, [A] Salvador Larroca. Tony is forced to collaborate with the Mandarin and Ezekiel Stane in producing “Titanomechs.” Matt Fraction was probably the best Iron Man writer since David Michelinie, yet his Iron Man stories don’t excite me very much, perhaps because his version of Tony is unsympathetic. This story arc was one of the last major Mandarin stories. In more recent years, Marvel has used Zheng Zu as a replacement for both the Mandarin and Fu Manchu, since both characters are examples of the same Yellow Peril stereotype.\n\nDESOLATION JONES #4 (Wildstorm, 2006) – “Made in England Part 4,” [W] Warren Ellis, [A] J.H. Williams III. This series was JHW3’s follow-up to Promethea, but it wasn’t nearly as good as Promethea. JHW3’s art in “Made in England” is spectacular, but Ellis’s story is full of unnecessary violence and machismo, and lacks an interesting premise. After Williams left with issue 6, Desolation Jones only lasted two more issues.\n\nFOOLKILLER #5 (Marvel, 1991) – “Body Count,” [W] Steve Gerber, [A] J.J. Birch. I collected this entire series while I was still in grad school, and I had ambitious plans of reading the whole thing at one sitting. But I only got as far as issue four, and the remaining six issues have been gathering dust in my boxes of unread comics for over a decade. I finally decided to read them. There were three versions of the Foolkiller, all created by Gerber. All of them had the gimmick of killing people they considered fools. The first Foolkiller was introduced in Man-Thing #3 and was killed in the next issue. The second one appeared in Omega the Unknown #8-9. He reappears in the Foolkiller miniseries, where, from prison, he influences a third man to take up the identity. In Foolkiller #5, the third Foolkiller, Kurt Gerhardt, invades a crack house and murders a bunch of people. A serious problem with this series is its racism. All the black and brown people in the series are drug dealers or sex workers, and in this issue it’s even implied that some of the Foolkiller’s targets/victims are illiterate. We will see some additional problems as the series goes on.\n\nFOOLKILLER #6 (Marvel, 1991) – “Fool’s Paradise,” as above. In Kurt’s civilian life, his coworker at his fast food job becomes a potential love interest, and he takes a new job running credit reports. A recurring theme in this series, as in much of Gerber’s earlier works, is the soul-crushing nature of the Reagan-Bush economy. In his vigilante identity, Kurt kills some more drug dealers, including a woman with a newborn baby. His excuse for killing her is “I want to incinerate the kind of mother who would subject it [the baby] to this life.” This is an example of the limitations of Kurt’s mentality: he fails to consider the kind of social conditions that have forced her to have this baby and raise it in a crack house. And now that the baby is orphaned, it may grow up in an even worse situation. Kurt’s strategy of murdering fools does nothing to solve the bigger problems that produce fools. What happens next is even worse, as Kurt murders a child. This is an inexcusable act, even though the child threw a knife at Kurt first. At this point I not only lost all sympathy for Kurt, I actively wanted him to die.\n\nFOOLKILLER #7 (Marvel, 1991) – “Who the Fools Are,” as above. After last issue, Kurt contemplates suicide, but regrettably decides against it. Instead he goes to a bar, and on the way back, he encounters a pimp beating a sex worker. Kurt beats up the pimp, but the sex worker defends him by hitting Kurt from behind, and Kurt kills them both. Here again we see that Kurt is just a horrible villain, even more so than the Punisher. It’s very common for abused women to defend their abusers, because one of the effects of abuse is that it causes the victim to feel an undeserved loyalty to the abuser. To punish an abused woman for defending her abuser is to blame the victim.\n\nUNCANNY X-MEN #400 (Marvel, 2001) – “Supreme Confessions,” [W] Joe Casey, [A] Ashley Wood. This issue is a single long story which is illustrated by six different artists, in widely clashing styles. Some of the artists use a standard Marvel house style, while Ashley Wood’s pages are painted in a sepia-toned, expressionistic style. One of the six artists is Eddie Campbell, but I had difficulty even figuring out which pages he did, because Marvel’s computer coloring sucks all the life out of his art. As for what this comic is about, I really don’t know. I can’t stand Joe Casey’s writing. I wish I could read Dynamite’s upcoming Jonny Quest series, but I can’t, since Casey is writing it.\n\nSUPERMAN #305 (DC, 1976) – “The Man Who Toyed with Death,” [W] Martin Pasko, [A] Curt Swan. In an earlier story, the Toyman’s identity was usurped by a man named Jack Nimball (I assume his middle initial was B). This issue, the original Toyman, Winslow Schott, murders Nimball and then builds a giant robot to battle Superman. At the end of the issue Bizarro intervenes in Superman and Schott’s fight. This issue was just average.\n\nANNIHILATOR #6 (Legendary, 2015) – untitled, [W] Grant Morrison, [A] Frazer Irving. This comic makes no sense at all. It’s even more confusing than other Grant Morrison comics. It seems to be some kind of a metatextual story about screenwriting, which would make it reminiscent of Animal Man #26, but that story was much clearer and more understandable. Frazer Irving’s art, as always, is beautiful, but it’s wasted on Morrison’s non-story.\n\nBATMAN ’66 #25 (DC, 2015) – “Night of the Harlequin,” [W] Jeff Parker, [A] Lukas Ketner. Batman and Robin fight the Batman ’66 version of Harley Quinn. This story is funny, but there’s nothing to distinguish it from any other issue of Batman ’66. The backup story is at least partially intended as a parody of Mad Men. All the major villains decide to team up and take over an ad agency, so as to improve their public image, but their plot fails because they can’t agree on which of them should be in charge.\n\nSECRET SIX #4 (DC, 2015) – “Friends in Low Places,” [W] Gail Simone, [A] Ken Lashley & Tom Derenick. The protagonists travel to the suburban town where the next few issues are set. On arriving, they’re attacked by three people in masks. The three reveal themselves as Scandal Savage, Jeanette, and Ragdoll, the remnants of the pre-New 52 version of the Secret Six. I’ve always had mixed feelings about Gail’s work, but I look forward to her upcoming X-Men series.\n\nKAIJUMAX #4 (Oni, 2015) – “Mutated Out,” [W/A] Zander Cannon. I can’t remember anything that happened in this particular issue, and I dislike this series in general. Kaijumax’s premise– a prison drama about monsters – is the sort of thing that’s only funny the first time, and Zander Cannon’s cartoonish style is inappropriate for depicting monsters. Zander Cannon was at Heroes Con, but I didn’t talk to him.\n\nTHE HUMANS #6 (Image, 2015) – untitled, [W] Keenan Marshall Keller, [A] Tom Neely. This is a typical issue of The Humans, except that it includes a scene where one of the bikers hallucinates that he’s back in Vietnam. The Humans is a very effective tribute to ‘70s underground comics, especially the work of Spain. However, its characters are all very similar, and none of them are sympathetic. Keller and Neely were both at Heroes Con, but I think I only spoke to Keller. I told him that I was enjoying Vengeance is for the Living, and that it reminded me of Carol Clover’s Men, Women and Chainsaws, which I had just read. I believe he recognized what I was referring to.\n\nFOOLKILLER #8 (Marvel, 1991) – “42 Days,” as above. While the first Gulf War is going on, the Foolkiller continues his crusade and murders some more people who don’t deserve to die. There’s also a subplot about a real estate developer named Darren Waite. This character is based on Donald Trump, who I really don’t want to think about right now, since I’m writing this two days after the first presidential debate. This issue also includes a gratuitous guest appearance by Spider-Man, who is featured on the cover but plays no essential role in the plot.\n\nFOOLKILLER #9 (Marvel, 1991) – “Feast of Fools,” as above. The Foolkiller tries to kill a drug dealer named Backhand, but fails. He does succeed in killing Darren Waite, which almost makes up for all the awful things he’s done. This issue also includes a talk show host named Runyan Moody who’s a parody of either Morton Downey Jr or G. Gordon Liddy.\n\nFOOLKILLER #10 (Marvel, 1991) – “Fools Rush In,” as above. Kurt kills Runyan Moody, and then he murders a college dean who has just expelled a student for a “politically incorrect” joke. This scene is another low point in the series. We are never told just why the student was expelled, although it’s hinted that the student may have called someone an anti-LGBTQ slur. Therefore, we can’t determine whether the dean’s decision was right or wrong, and even if he was wrong, he didn’t deserve to be killed. This scene just feels like a knee-jerk reaction to “political correctness,” which, then as now, just meant treating people decently. After that, Kurt goes on a suicide mission against Mendoza, the drug lord who’s supplying Backhand. To my great disappointment, Kurt kills Mendoza and survives. He gets a new fake ID which depicts him as resembling Richard Rory, although I didn’t get this reference until I saw someone else mention it. In the 2016 Foolkiller miniseries, published after Gerber’s death, Kurt was killed by his predecessor Greg Salinger. Overall, Foolkiller was one of Gerber’s less impressive works. Its “hero” is a loathsome villain, and its politics are reactionary and vague. The main problem is that Kurt has no clear definition of who counts as a fool, and so he feels justified in killing anybody he doesn’t like. He’s not a vigilante, he’s a serial killer.\n\nJONAH HEX #59 (DC, 2010) – “Riders on the Storm,” [W] Justin Gray & Jimmy Palmiotti, [A] Jordi Bernet. While trying to collect a bounty, Jonah discovers that his target is in a standoff with his own brother, stemming from the brother’s forbidden romance with a Comanche woman. The situation gets even more volatile due to the arrival of the Gray Ghost, a vigilante who hunts people he sees as traitors to the Confederacy – including Jonah himself. In the ensuing gunfight, the Comanche woman gets fridged. Bernet is a world-class artist, but his style does not mesh well with computer coloring.\n\nTHOR #285 (Marvel, 1979) – “Deviants and Doormen!”, [W] Roy Thomas, [A] John Buscema. This is more of an Eternals story than a Thor story. While searching for Sersi, Thor gets in an unnecessary fight with the Deviant Karkas, and then there’s a long flashback about Karkas’s encounter with Ikaris and Thena. Karkas and his partner Rejekt have had some very funny scenes in Rainbow Rowell’s She-Hulk.\n\nINCREDIBLE HULK #227 (Marvel, 1978) – “The Monster’s Analyst,” [W] Roger Stern w/ Peter B. Gillis, [A] Sal Buscema. Doc Samson sedates the Hulk and uses a machine to view the Hulk’s dreams. Inside the Hulk’s mind, Samson witnesses the Hulk’s childhood and early career. This issue is sort of a prototype for two very important later stories – Hulk #312 and #377 – though it doesn’t go nearly as deep into the Hulk’s psychology as those stories do. I was very sorry to hear that Peter Gillis passed away. I never met him in person, but I was in contact with him on Facebook, and he seemed like a very intelligent and thoughtful man. Strikeforce: Morituri was an early favorite of mine, and he wrote some of the best What If?s ever.\n\nNAMESAKE #3 (Boom!, 2017) – untitled, [W] Steve Orlando, [A] Jakub Rebelka. I couldn’t entirely follow this comic’s plot, but it seems to be a gay-themed urban fantasy about a protagonist who’s trying to rediscover his past. This comic’s premise is interesting, and Jakub Rebelka’s artwork is very vivid. His art is similar to Michael Dialynas’s, especially in terms of the color palette. I also bought the trade paperback of this series, though maybe that was a mistake, since I prefer to collect comic books in single-issue form.\n\nTHUNDERBOLTS #26 (Marvel, 1999) – “Lockdown,” [W] Joe Casey, [A] Leonardo Manco. Abner Jenkins is involved in an unsuccessful prison break. This appears to be an inventory story, since only the framing sequence is by the usual team of Busiek and Bagley. Casey’s story is of no interest. Leonardo Manco’s art is detailed and moody, but he seems to be more interested in drawing pretty pictures rather than telling a story. On his fourth page and again on his final page, there are very detailed drawings of characters who are irrelevant to the plot. Also, he makes the Rhino look way too thin.\n\nSUPERGIRL #9 (DC, 1997) – “Tempus Fugit,” [W] Peter David, [A] Gary Frank. Supergirl fights a devil who wields two sickles. I’ve never really liked this series, and I think the reason is that it’s not a Supergirl comic at all, except in name. It’s more similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than to any other Supergirl comic before or since. The proof of this is that PAD later continued his Supergirl run as a creator-owned series, Fallen Angel, which had no connection to the Superman mythos.\n\nDC COMICS BOMBSHELLS #20 (DC, 2017) – “Men Who Would Be Kings,” [W] Marguerite Bennett, [A] Marguerite Sauvage, Mirka Andolfo & Laura Braga. The opening sequence in this issue stars Vixen and is inspired by Jesse Owens’s performance at the 1936 Olympics. Other than that, this is just a typical issue of DC Comics Bombshells. I dislike this series because first, Marguerite Bennett’s writing style is annoying, and second, the plot never seems to make any progress; the war never gets any closer to its conclusion.\n\nUNCANNY VALLEY #2 (Boom!, 2024) – untitled, [W] Tony Fleecs, [A] Dave Wachter. While driving through the desert, Oliver and his grandfather encounter “Dingo” (Wile E. Coyote), who knocks them off of a cliff. They survive by taking advantage of the canyon fall gag, then they escape the coyote thanks to the painted tunnel gag. This is another hilarious issue of what is probably my favorite new comic of the year. Again, the jokes are made possible thanks to Dave Wachter’s ability to draw in both realistic and cartoon styles within the same panel, and to distinguish the two styles from each other. Wachter was supposed to be at Heroes Con, but he cancelled.\n\nTRANSFORMERS #8 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Daniel Warren Johnson, [A] Jorge Corona. This issue is less intense than earlier ones, consisting largely of dialogue scenes, though there is a shocking moment where Soundwave murders some shipwrecked people. There’s also a subplot taking place on Cybertron, whose significance is not clear until next issue. Throughout this series we’ve been seeing that the Decepticons, besides Starscream, are not just evil for evil’s sake; they do have actual goals, though they achieve those goals by evil means. I met Daniel Warren Johnson briefly at Heroes Con, while waiting for my pro badge. I thanked him for saving the comics industry, at least temporarily. He’s been to Heroes Con before, but I didn’t meet him because his line was always too long.\n\nUSAGI YOJIMBO: THE CROW #2 (Dark Horse, 2024) – “The Crow Part 2,” [W/A] Stan Sakai. Yukichi is kidnapped by some bounty hunters who mistakenly think he’s a rival for Jimmu’s bounty. Yukichi argues with the lead bounty hunter, and the bounty hunter breaks Yukichi’s sword and delivers it to Usagi. As revealed in the next issue, this bounty hunter is Inuyoshi from issue 127 of the previous Dark Horse series. I had forgotten all about that story, but a rereading of it makes it clear why Inuyoshi is so cynical about samurai honor.\n\nDARK RIDE #12 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] Joshua Williamson, [A] Andrei Bressan. Halloween fulfills her family’s pact with the devil by murdering her own father. Arthur’s late wife rises from the dead and drags Arthur down to hell. Halloween inherits Arthur’s ownership of Devil Land, as well as his curse. Things end happily for the other characters. This series was much shorter than its creators’ previous collaboration, Birthright, but it was equally entertaining.\n\nAIN’T NO GRAVE #1 (Image, 2024) – “Denial,” [W] Skottie Young, [A] Jorge Corona. In an Old West world, the legendary outlaw Ryder has retired from her life of crime to become a mother, but now she’s terminally ill. Refusing to accept her fate, she instead travels to the underworld to kill Death. This looks like it will be just as good as these creators’ previous collaborations, Middlewest and The Me You Love in the Dark. As a Western comic about the incarnation of Death, Ain’t No Grave reminds me of Pretty Deadly, except that I hated Pretty Deadly, and I like Ain’t No Grave much better. Skottie was at Heroes Con, but he was constantly mobbed, and I didn’t get a chance to talk to him.\n\nLOVE & ROCKETS #15 (Fantagraphics, 2024) – [W/A] Gilbert Hernandez and Jaime Hernandez. The best story in this issue is Jaime’s “Latter Daze,” in which Maggie has to conquer her fear of the ocean because she thinks Tonta is drowning. The other Jaime stories are set in his science fiction milieu. One of the Gilbert stories is set in Palomar and includes appearances by Chelo and Diana Villaseñor.\n\nTHE DEVIANT #5 (Image, 2024) – untitled, [W] James Tynion IV, [A] Joshua Hixson. In a flashback scene set in 1999, Michael and a friend sneak into the original serial killer’s house. There’s only one brief scene set in the present day, and it doesn’t advance the plot. This kind of feels like a waste of an issue. #6, to be reviewed below, was much more interesting.\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR #20 (Marvel, 2024) – “To Work Wonders,” [W] Ryan North, [A] Carlos Gomez. Ben and Johnny both get jobs at the same grocery store, and they compete with each other to be named Cashier of the Month. But when a tabloid reporter visits the store looking for dirt on Johnny, Ben gives a speech in which he praises Johnny as “one ‘a the best men I know.” This issue is funny, and Ben’s climactic speech is a touching moment. This issue reminds me of Fantastic Four #61 from Mark Waid’s run, but it kind of goes in the opposite direction, examining Ben and Johnny’s mutual respect instead of their rivalry.\n\nBIRDS OF PREY #9 (DC, 2024) – “Worlds Without End Part 1,” [W] Kelly Thompson, [A] Jonathan Case & Gavin Guidry. After passing through the portal at the end of last issue, the BoP are trapped in a black-and-white horror dimension, while back on earth, Meridian and Zealot try to find their teammates. I’ve more or less forgotten this issue’s story already, but Jordie Bellaire’s coloring is very striking. I like the contrasting color schemes between the scenes in the real world and the scenes in the alternate dimension.\n\nTHE BOY WONDER #1 (DC, 2024) – untitled, [W/A] Juni Ba. Robin (but it’s not clear which Robin) has been captured by an unidentified criminal. To pass the time, Robin tells the kidnapper a story in which Damian teams up with Nightwing and Batgirl to fight Clayface. This is a typical Robin story, but it’s narrated as if it were a fairy tale, and it’s drawn in the same style as Monkey Meat and Djeliya. The Boy Wonder is another fascinating work from a very talented and original artist. It doesn’t include any explicit African references that I n"
