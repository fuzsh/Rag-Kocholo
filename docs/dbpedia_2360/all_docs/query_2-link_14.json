I’ve got a list I could read to you, but I’ve got to be someplace by 5 p.m. next Friday. —­Bert Sugar, boxing historian\n\nAs one of popu­lar culture’s most popu­lar arenas, sports are often the subject of cinematic storytelling—­from Hollywood blockbusters to in­de­pen­dent documentaries. ­People like sports. P ­ eople like movies. ­People ­will pay to watch movies about sports—­Pride of the Yankees (Sam Wood, 1942), Hoosiers (David Anspaugh, 1986), Any Given Sunday (Oliver Stone, 1999), Bend It Like Beckham (Gurinder Chadha, 2002), and so on. But boxing films are special. ­There are more movies about boxing, by a healthy margin, than about any other sport, and boxing accompanied and aided the medium’s late nineteenth-­century emergence as a popu­lar mass entertainment. Many of cinema’s most celebrated directors—­a group that includes Busby Berkeley, Tod Browning, Michael Curtiz, Alfred Hitchcock, John Huston, Stanley Kubrick, Oscar Micheaux, Martin Scorsese, and King Vidor—­have made boxing films. And while the production of other types of sports movies generally corresponds with the current popularity of their subject, boxing films continue to be made regularly even ­after the sport has wilted from its once prominent position in the sports hierarchy of the United States. This book explores why boxing has so consistently 1\n\n2 • The Boxing Film\n\nfascinated cinema, and popu­lar media culture more generally, by tracing how boxing movies inform the sport’s meanings and uses from the late nineteenth ­century to the early twenty-­first ­century. Boxing uniquely lends itself to enduring myths about identity, achievement, and vio­lence. “What could be more basic than making a living by hitting another person on the head ­until one of you falls or stops?” asks Raging Bull (1980) director Martin Scorsese. “I’ve always had a feeling for boxing,” echoes Rocky (1976) creator and star Sylvester Stallone. “It’s barbaric but it’s basic, it’s pure, it’s the natu­ral man and it lends itself to film.”1 Boxing is certainly basic—­ far more so than increasingly technologized team sports like football and baseball—­but it is not natu­ral. Prizefighting is carefully staged to maximize the drama and gore that w ­ ill drive fans to see live competitions as well as the stories Scorsese and Stallone use the sport to create. While repre­sen­ta­tions of boxing span media, film scholar Leger Grindon maintains that “no art has ­shaped our perception of the boxer as motion pictures.”2 Th ­ ese films do not simply depict boxing, of course, but also manufacture versions of it that color how the sport is understood. Rocky protagonist Rocky Balboa is as well known as any a­ ctual prizefighter and is deployed just as often to make sense of the sport and t­ hose who practice it. Stallone and his character are even in the International Boxing Hall of Fame alongside Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, and Muhammad Ali.3 Boxing is commonly depicted as an activity that allows the disadvantaged, even when faced with unfair and corrupt circumstances, to improve their social station. If fighters are on the wrong end of the crooked fight game—­a scenario that occurs more often than not in boxing films—­they can prove their moral and physical mettle in the singularly meritocratic space the boxing ring provides. This physical and spiritual valor—or body and soul, to use boxing film argot—is deeply gendered. The boxing movie had thrived for over a ­century before Karyn Kusama’s Girlfight (2000) offered the first serious production about ­women in the sport. “Boxing is for men, and is about men, and is men,” writes cultural critic and novelist Joyce Carol Oates, “a cele­bration of the lost religion of masculinity all the more trenchant for being lost.”4 This nostalgic, and decidedly toxic, masculinity is baked into professional prizefighting—­the brand of boxing most films depict. Pro fighters, for instance, compete without shirts or headgear. Boxers, however, do not sweat any more than basketball or soccer players, who wear shirts despite the pools of perspiration their sports generate. And headgear protects against cuts, not knockouts or even concussions. ­These conventions are in place, then, to emphasize boxing’s gladiatorial and sexualized hypermasculinity by transforming fights into seminude and bloody spectacles. Extending boxing’s ste­reo­t ypical machismo, the writer Norman Mailer likened the heavyweight champion—­traditionally the sport’s most vis­i­ble ­figure—to “the big toe of God. You have nothing to mea­sure yourself by.”5 Mailer was referring h ­ ere to Muhammad Ali, the out­spoken Black Muslim\n\nIntroduction • 3\n\nchampion whose achievement toppled a host of ideologies regarding which types of bodies o­ ught to be able to serve as emblems of masculinity’s peak. Given the heavyweight champion’s symbolic import, vari­ous efforts—­some more deliberate and pernicious than ­others—­have been levied to make it more difficult for non-Whites to occupy this vaunted role. Th ­ ese gender and racial politics bleed into the sport’s less prominent corners and weight classes. Boxing films, through both their repre­sen­ta­tions and how they circulate, participate in creating the sport as a site of cultural production. When Jack Johnson became the first Black heavyweight champion in 1908—­after years of being denied a title opportunity ­because of his race—­efforts to subdue the recalcitrant fighter centered on controlling the distribution of films that showed him easily thumping White challengers. In 1912 the U.S. Congress passed legislation directed explic­itly at Johnson that barred the interstate transportation of all fight films—an overtly bigoted law that was in place for twenty-­eight years. The Hollywood boxing films that emerged shortly ­after Johnson lost the title in 1915 seldom depicted non-White protagonists regardless of boxing’s racial composition—­a tradition that has continued ever since and that inaccurately imagines the sport as one that White American fighters dominate. But boxing films also offer occasional challenges to the status quo. ­These alternatives, however, typically come in the form of less vis­i­ble in­de­pen­dent productions and documentaries. Adding to its cultural import, boxing sits at the foundation of not only cinema but also radio, network and cable tele­vi­sion, and, more recently, live digital streaming. Boxing films helped to establish and maintain the sport’s status as a commercial attraction that budding media platforms could reliably employ to gather an audience. The Radio Corporation of Amer­i­ca (RCA) used Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier’s 1921 heavyweight championship bout to debut the first commercial radio broadcast. Five years ­later, RCA employed Dempsey’s match against Gene Tunney to launch its National Broadcasting Com­pany (NBC), the first U.S. radio network. NBC built an audience with Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, a series of prime-­time sports radio programming focused on boxing, and the network used t­ hese fight broadcasts to broker its expansion into tele­vi­sion. When NBC canceled Gillette Cavalcade in 1959, the sponsor gave the American Broadcasting Com­pany (ABC) its sports advertising bud­get on the condition that it continue producing a regular prime-­time boxing show. The Gillette investment composed the seed money upon which ABC built ABC Sports, the network division that codified modern sports tele­ vi­sion’s main formal practices. When cable TV outlets like HBO and ESPN launched in the 1970s, they looked to boxing to forge market share—­a strategy that live sports streaming companies have a­ dopted more recently. Th ­ ese varied media sell the sport by building on the narratives boxing movies craft and, in d­ oing so, share in creating its meanings and uses.\n\n4 • The Boxing Film\n\nScholars including Grindon, Aaron Baker, Seán Crosson, Lester D. Friedman, and Tony Williams have expertly identified and critiqued the boxing film’s generic properties. In par­tic­u­lar, Grindon’s Knockout: The Boxer and Boxing in American Cinema (2011) offers meticulous textual analyses of how the genre engages topics that include race, class, gender, assimilation, and vio­lence. Adopting a dif­fer­ent approach, Dan Streible’s Fight Pictures: A History of Boxing and Early Cinema (2008) focuses on the boxing film’s place in cinema culture as the medium took root in fin de siècle Amer­i­ca. Streible is less interested in the boxing film’s formal dynamics—­which ­were decidedly stripped-­down in the pre-­Hollywood context on which he focuses—­than in how it helps to explain early cinema’s development, practices, and politics.6 This book, subtitled A Cultural and Transmedia History, combines ­these critical and historical approaches to explore how, over time and across media, boxing films shape and confront the sport they take as their topic. To piece together this history it is necessary to consider many films. For the sake of manageability, I limit this book almost entirely to movies made in the United States that focus on the sport in Amer­i­ca, although dozens of international productions merit scholarly consideration. I liberally define the boxing movie as any production in which the sport of boxing—­whether officially sanctioned or not—­plays a significant role. As a result, both Champion (Mark Robson, 1949), which is squarely about professional boxing, and Hard Times (Walter Hill, 1975), which focuses on illicit bareknuckle fights, are boxing films as far as I’m concerned. I also consider films that stretch beyond mainstream cinema, such as indie productions, documentaries, made-­for-­T V movies, teleplays, and even one-­off experiments like Woroner Productions’ 1970 Super Fight film that pitted a suspended Muhammad Ali against a retired Rocky Marciano and was exhibited in the style of a closed-­circuit TV broadcast. ­These eclectic films all participate in composing boxing’s presence on screen and, as such, build the sport’s cultural significance. But they do so in tellingly dif­fer­ent ways depending on their production, distribution, and consumption. Charting this long history and the broad collection of films that make it up—­rather than focusing on a handful of “greatest hits”—­reveals some instructive patterns that illuminate boxing, film, and their intersections. In par­tic­u­lar, it shows how the racial controversies surrounding films of Jack Johnson lingered and evolved to inform productions made during the ascendance of Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and Floyd Mayweather. This historical and transmedia approach also makes clear the varied roles boxing has consistently played across media over time—­and how the politics of boxing films shape mediations of the sport that might other­wise seem to be motivated by purely economic or technological ends. The first chapter outlines boxing’s impor­tant roles in early cinema’s aesthetic techniques, industrial norms, and politics leading to the emergence of the\n\nIntroduction • 5\n\nClassical Hollywood studio era. It explains how the racism surrounding Jack Johnson provoked the federal restriction of fight films and how, by stark contrast, the White heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey triggered an explosion of commercial sports media a­ fter he won the title in 1919. While films of a­ ctual fights remained banned through Dempsey’s professional c­ areer, fictional films, print journalism, and radio broadcasts voraciously capitalized on his image through the 1920s. Beyond exploiting Dempsey’s celebrity, boxing movies stressed the increasingly spectacular status the sport achieved during this time by dramatizing prizefighting’s relationship to the media it attracted and supported. Th ­ ese films also perpetuated efforts to remove Johnson from public view by building worlds that excluded Black fighters. Chapter 1 shows how early boxing movies, through both their repre­sen­ta­tions and their regulation, turned Johnson into an outcast and made Dempsey the wealthiest and one of the most famous athletes of his era. Boxing briefly lulled a­ fter Dempsey’s 1927 retirement. Joe Louis rejuvenated the sport when he became the first Black champion since Johnson in 1937—­albeit a very dif­fer­ent kind of African American celebrity whose success depended on his willingness to eschew Johnson’s defiance. Louis’s impact extended into boxing movies, which similarly sagged a­ fter Dempsey’s c­ areer ended. The champ acted in and inspired vari­ous Black-­cast and in­de­pen­dently produced “race” films targeted to African American moviegoers. Beyond ­these niche productions, Louis catalyzed Hollywood’s most vigorous era of boxing films. ­These studio movies benefitted from the Black champion’s renown but did not feature a Black protagonist u­ ntil The Joe Louis Story in 1953—­a work that was released a­ fter Louis retired and the White fighter Rocky Marciano had secured the heavyweight title. As Streible claims, “The role that films played in [Louis’s] ­career merits further study.”7 Chapter 2 takes up this call by discussing how the mainstream boxing films made during Louis’s c­ areer exploited the interest in prizefighting that the Black champion generated while imagining a sport that omitted the racial difference he embodied. Louis’s popu­lar matches aided tele­vi­sion’s rise—­through both closed-­circuit public exhibitions and domestic broadcasts. But much like Dempsey prompted a surge in sports media during the 1920s, Marciano amplified interest in the new medium when he became champ. Tele­vi­sion boosted Marciano’s stardom and reinforced the racial politics that constituted it. The medium, for instance, offered disproportionate opportunities to White fighters who would more effectively draw viewers and sell advertisements. TV also ushered potentially corrupting shifts in the sport. Chapter 3 considers how boxing films of the 1950s confronted tele­vi­sion’s impact on the culture and business of prizefighting. Echoing the circumstances surrounding Jack Dempsey’s retirement, Holly­ wood boxing films receded ­a fter the im­mensely popu­lar Marciano left the sport in 1956. Prizefighting, however, remained a fixture of theatrical spaces and\n\n6 • The Boxing Film\n\nexhibition. In par­tic­u­lar, live closed-­circuit TV broadcasts ­were the sport’s biggest revenue source and the main way marquee fights ­were consumed through the ­middle 1970s. Muhammad Ali fueled closed-­circuit’s rise. But Ali’s controversial image turned closed-­circuit exhibitions of his matches into public spaces where debates about the divisive champ occurred prior to and amid his 1967 suspension from professional boxing for refusing military induction. Ali’s expulsion inspired efforts to cash in on the banished fighter—­many of which took the form of documentaries and fictional films that appeared in the theatrical spaces from which his lucrative fights had abruptly vanished. Chapter 4 focuses on Woroner Productions’ 1970 Super Fight, a film exhibited in the style of a live closed-­circuit broadcast that was based on a computer-­simulated match between Ali and Marciano. It explains how the Super Fight worked around Ali’s suspension and controversies surrounding closed-­circuit broadcasts of his bouts while reasserting the racial norms the suspended prizefighter upset and easing his reinstatement into pro boxing. The momentarily hibernating Hollywood boxing film resurged with Rocky, which took inspiration from both the Super Fight and closed-­circuit exhibitions to tell the story of a White long shot modeled partly on Marciano who challenges a flamboyant Black champion based on Ali. Rocky became the most popu­lar boxing film ever and spawned a decades-­long franchise. The film’s reactionary racial politics complemented conservative responses to Ali and celebrated a return to traditional social mores through Balboa’s success. The surprise hit propelled a wave of boxing movies that engaged Ali and the customs he disrupted. While Hollywood productions tended to reinforce Rocky with tales of White achievement, a collection of blaxploitation and in­de­pen­dent films countered the critically acclaimed blockbuster with stories of Black triumph that took Ali as their muse and even subject. Chapter 5 examines how the 1970s revival of boxing films that Rocky stimulated was driven by efforts to capitalize on Ali’s polarizing image and negotiate the cultural hierarchies he dismantled. As with radio and network tele­vi­sion, cable TV used boxing to establish itself during the 1970s. In par­tic­u­lar, HBO—­the focal point of chapter 6—­relied on boxing to build its subscribership by carry­ing matches on its main channel and distributing them via pay-­per-­view feeds, which steadily overtook closed-­ circuit as the main way big fights w ­ ere consumed. HBO, through the subsidiary HBO Sports, accompanied its boxing coverage with documentaries that promoted the fights it carried and stressed the media outlet’s importance to the sport. Beyond t­ hese documentaries, HBO participated in a range of practices that similarly mediate boxing’s real­ity and emphasize the premium cable outlet’s centrality to prizefighting. ­ These docu-­ branding activities—­ which include original docudramas, brand placements in films and video games, and real­ity TV programs—­craft versions of boxing’s past and pre­sent that reinforce HBO’s status as home to the sport’s most significant events.\n\nIntroduction • 7\n\nProphesies of boxing’s demise followed prizefighting throughout its history, with reasons that included its notorious corruption, the debilitating injuries prizefighters suffer, and the introduction of new media technologies. Th ­ ese grim projections gained extraordinary momentum in the 1990s and 2000s. Boxing had few major stars, and mixed martial arts (MMA) emerged with an exciting and cannily marketed sport that siphoned prizefighting’s already shrinking fan base. As a result, some filmmakers began using MMA as the backdrop for the types of tales boxing films traditionally offered. Amid this crisis, boxing films argued for the struggling sport’s continued relevance and worked to delegitimize MMA. Many of t­ hese productions made the case for boxing’s sustained cultural import by appealing not simply to the sport but to the heritage that boxing films created for it. Chapter 7 explores ­these filmic efforts to protect boxing. The book concludes by explaining how the boxing film has at once shifted and maintained consistency in the twenty-­first c­ entury with productions like Antoine Fuqua’s Southpaw (2015) and the Rocky reboots Creed (Ryan Coogler, 2015) and Creed 2 (Steven Caple Jr., 2018). Th ­ ese films all feature Black directors—­a rarity in the Hollywood boxing film—­and the Creed films have a Black protagonist. As such, they mark an impor­tant transition in the historically White-­dominated genre. However, they also continue to buttress the boxing movie’s traditional conventions with varying degrees of subtlety. The conclusion probes ­these recent boxing films’ ambivalent cultural politics and outlines how the long-­standing genre continues to resonate in sport and media culture over a c­ entury ­after it began appearing on screen. Sports sit at the center of popu­lar media culture, but they occupy the margins of media scholarship. Boxing helps to explain the many roles sports play in shaping media’s cultural, po­liti­cal, and industrial contours since the late nineteenth ­century. Boxing films play an outsize role in building the meanings that have driven boxing’s consistent presence in popu­lar culture over time and across media—­even a­ fter the sport has dwindled in popularity. As such, their long history adds to the still nascent discussion about sport and media’s interdependence and the thorny politics that mark this commercialized symbiosis.\n\n1\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age of Sports Media Although illegal in most states as the twentieth c­ entury dawned, prizefighting composed an alluring and provocative spectacle that gathered a nationwide audience through coverage in publications like the National Police Gazette, Spirit of the Times, and New York Clipper. The sport also con­ve­niently suited nascent cinema technologies. Early cameras, as film historian Terry Ramsaye comments, “had about the same pictorial availability as a knothole in a ballfield fence.” Luckily, ­little more was needed to capture boxing matches. “The ropes of the prize fight film automatically ­limited the radius of action,” Ramsaye writes. “It was ­simple to set the ponderous camera to cover the ring. The cameraman could then grind away, secure in the certainty that the picture was not getting away from him, ­unless indeed the combatants jumped the ropes and ran away.”1 The boxing film established itself as cinema’s first and most popu­ lar genre, with more than two hundred fight films made by 1915. “It was boxing,” glibly asserts film historian Luke McKernan, “that created cinema.”2 Boxing films offered early glimpses of the stylistic, economic, and cultural practices that came to characterize the Classical Hollywood studio era. They also hastened boxing’s growth into a national spectacle. But boxing and cinema’s u­ nion was not simply borne out of technological con­ve­nience. The sport and medium occupied a common “sporting and theatrical community” that served overlapping—­and mostly male—­consumers.3\n\n9\n\n10 • The Boxing Film\n\nTheir symbiosis also ­shaped sport and media’s mutual development. The popu­ lar boxing film was at the center of debates regarding which types of activities and ­people should be celebrated, marginalized, and even suppressed. ­These attitudes carried over into the explosion of commercial mass media that undergirded the so-­called Golden Age of Sports during the 1920s. The boxing film propelled this convergent sports media environment and the attendant assumptions about which sorts of bodies w ­ ere best fit for public exhibition.\n\nEarly Fight Films In an 1891 interview with the New York Sun, Thomas Edison predicted that prizefights would compose an ideal complement to the kinetoscope moving picture machine that he was fine-­tuning.4 Three years l­ ater, the Edison Studio’s first major film proj­ect showcased a fight between journeyman lightweights Mike Leonard and Jack Cushing at Edison’s Black Maria production fa­cil­i­ty in West Orange, New Jersey. The match was staged to complement Edison’s myriad technological limitations, which required natu­ral light and necessitated a smaller ring than was standard for competitions at the time. Leonard and Cushing sparred for ten single-­minute rounds in front of extras posing as trainers and fans cheering from ringside. The fighters rested for seven minutes instead of the typical one minute between the truncated rounds so that technicians could reload and adjust the cameras.5 While only six of the ten rounds turned out, Edison’s Leonard-­Cushing Fight composed the longest motion picture created to date. It was distributed by the Kinetoscope Exhibition Com­ pany in August 1894 as six separate minute-­long films—­one for each round. The sixth film con­ve­niently finished with Leonard knocking Cushing to the ground. Edison, in an effort to maximize patronage, did not announce the fight’s result. But many customers simply skipped to the final film to see the match’s outcome. Leonard claimed he could have felled Cushing far ­earlier but was protecting Edison’s financial interests. “Mr. Edison treated me right,” Cushing said, “and I ­didn’t want to be too quick for his machine.” The carefully orchestrated competition offers an early illustration of how media’s intersecting technological horizons and commercial imperatives shape sporting contests. It also composed one of the medium’s first hits that “drew almost riotous crowds for many days on end” to kinetoscope parlors and established the fight film’s viability. It remained in the Edison Com­pany’s film cata­logue well into the twentieth ­century.6 Edison’s Corbett and Courtney Before a Kinetograph (1894) a­ dopted the same six-­round format as Leonard-­Cushing but with higher profile participants and more deliberate orchestration. “Gentleman” Jim Corbett was heavyweight champion at the time and Peter Courtney was a top contender. The film’s title suggests the display of a boxing match on film was as in­ter­est­ing as the match\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 11\n\nitself—­a reflection of the technological novelty that film scholar Tom Gunning identifies as characteristic of early cinematic attractions before narrative story­ telling became the norm.7 The producers de­cided that “the fight should be precisely six rounds of one-­minute each and that the sixth should be concluded by a handsome knockout delivered by the star, James Corbett,” who was instructed to turn his face ­toward the camera during the filming so that audiences could get a better look at the handsome fighter as he doled out punishment. Ramsaye locates Corbett and Courtney as “the ancestor of dramatic construction for the motion picture. H ­ ere was the first glimmering of creative motion picture effort, the first step t­ oward having ­things happen for the camera rather than merely photographing events ordained by other forces.”8 Adding to its aesthetic significance, the film occasioned the industry’s first “star” contract when Corbett agreed to perform exclusively for the Kinetoscope Exhibition Com­pany. Corbett became so identified with the com­pany that it eventually pasted his coiffed profile on its official letterhead.9 Leonard-­Cushing and Corbett and Courtney established boxing as early cinema’s most popu­lar subject. The sport became a backdrop for productions that spanned beyond fights, such as Edison’s The Boxing Cats (1894)—­the ancestor of the ubiquitous modern-­day cat video—­and The Gordon ­Sisters Boxing (1901). ­Whether representing legitimate bouts or feline gags, the boxing film was as invested in staging entertaining spectacles as it was in documenting events. Filmed reproductions of fights—­such as re-­creations based on newspaper reports and illicit adaptations of extant films—­were commonplace. Streible explains that fake fight films actually outnumbered ­those shot at the ringside of sanctioned bouts ­until 1910. ­These fake films, as historian Charles Musser adds, came in handy and ­were gratefully accepted by audiences when no documentation of the ­actual bout was available.10 Early fight films, then, are as indebted to fiction as to fact—­a fluidity that illustrates boxing and theater’s entanglement. Fighters ­were athletes as well as actors, and t­ hese complementary roles intersected. Most popu­lar boxers appeared on the vaudev­ille cir­cuit and made more money on stage than in the ring. Corbett, for instance, starred in plays that included A Naval Cadet in 1896 and 1906’s Cashel Byron’s Profession, an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s novel of the same title. Many boxers, then, transitioned with relative ease into film roles once narrative cinema took hold and began casting fighters to add star power and realism. The transition from single-­use kinetoscopes to public exhibitions that more closely approximated the communal experience of attending a fight amplified the boxing film’s popularity. The Veriscope Com­pany’s production of Corbett’s 1897 match against Bob Fitzsimmons in Carson City, Nevada, composed what Streible identifies as the “most impor­tant product of the early marriage of film and fights” and was cinema’s most lucrative ever property—­within or beyond boxing. Moreover, Corbett-­Fitzsimmons Fight changed the economy of sports\n\n12 • The Boxing Film\n\nby making films more profitable than ticket sales to bouts.11 Aggressive promotional efforts accompanied this business to ensure nationwide audiences would be aware of the fight that would eventually appear on film in theaters. The marketing blitz made Corbett-­Fitzsimmons such a spectacle that ­people gathered at public places throughout the country to hear announcements of telegraphed round-­by-­round updates from Carson City. Veriscope’s Enoch Rector used three cameras to document the match and protected the property against copies by painting a trademark on ringside—­“Copyright The Veriscope Com­pany”—to designate his film as the genuine article.12 Although fakes routinely circulated, fight films of unstaged bouts like Corbett-­Fitzsimmons helped to inaugurate cinema’s capacity to offer reliable documentary evidence. While Fitzsimmons won the fight and the heavyweight title that came along with it, reports indicated that he may have committed a disqualifying foul ­toward the end of the match. Anticipating current replay technologies, the films furnished a way to investigate this alleged offense. The New York World reported that Corbett-­Fitzsimmons “marked a triumph of science over the poor imperfect instrument, the ­human eye, and proves that the veriscope camera is far superior.”13 The film offered evidence of intricacies beyond even the referee’s reach. Musser cites Corbett-­Fitzsimmons as propelling documentary cinema’s function as an arbiter of truth about the world it indexes. “Promoters and spectators recognized the possibility of and the demand for, what is now called ‘observational cinema.’ The filmmaker’s role was to rec­ord an event and then re-­present it with as l­ ittle intervention as pos­si­ble, so that the audience was in the position to judge the outcome for themselves.”14 The boxing film thus stood at the root of both narrative and documentary cinema. Although popu­lar, profitable, and instructive, fight films traded in controversial subject ­matter. New York State did not legalize prizefighting ­until 1920. And the New York Times lamented Corbett-­Fitzsimmons’ popularity. “It is not very creditable to our civilization,” the paper remarked, “that an achievement of what is now called the veriscope that has attracted and ­will attract the widest attention should be the repre­sen­ta­tion of a prizefight.”15 Alabama congressperson William F. Aldrick submitted an unsuccessful bill that proposed “no pictures or description of any prize fight or encounter of pugilists or any proposal or rec­ord of betting on the same s­ hall be transmitted by the mails of the United States or by inter-­state commerce, ­whether in a newspaper or tele­ gram.” But Musser points out that Corbett-­Fitzsimmons’ status as “an ‘illustration’ of a fight rather than a fight itself made the attraction not only legally but socially acceptable viewing material.” Prizefighting films broadened boxing’s audience beyond the comparatively few who could witness matches in person. They also helped to legitimize the consumption of boxing by allowing spectators, especially ­women, to view matches without entering the vice-­laden settings\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 13\n\nwhere bouts took place.16 Some exhibitors actively marketed fight films ­toward ­women to broaden their audience and give their screenings a sense of respectability that would insulate their establishments from critics like Aldrick. Th ­ ese gendered efforts to legitimize fight films also, and unintentionally, offered ­women patrons rare and even transgressive glimpses of seminude male bodies that constitute early reversals of cinema’s endemic and objectifying “male gaze.” Corbett seemed to realize and take advantage of this by wearing shorts that rode halfway up his buttocks. While fight films offered some permissible titillation, ­these sexualized spectacles sparked increased outrage when they featured Black men, particularly Black men who beat White opponents. “Mixed-­race fight pictures ­were deemed among the lowest grades of screen entertainment,” Streible explains.17 The heavyweight Jack Johnson brought ­these attitudes into focus. Beyond his skill in the ring, Johnson was dissident and out­spoken. “Jack Johnson was his own man when it was not eco­nom­ically or physically advisable for blacks to be ‘men,’ ” explains biographer Al-­Tony Gilmore. “He refused to let anyone—­white or black—or any laws or customs— to dictate his place in society or the manner in which he should live.”18 Johnson flaunted his wealth, married White w ­ omen, and, building on Corbett, paraded his sexuality by packing his shorts with gauze to make his penis look larger while competing. Most impor­tant, he dominated the White heavyweights he encountered in the ring. More than other weight classes, the heavyweight champion—­Norman Mailer’s big toe of God—­symbolized manhood’s summit. To preserve this myth, White heavyweight champions instituted de facto color lines restricting Black competitors from even having the chance to compete for the title. Johnson repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to convince champion Jim Jeffries to grant him a title shot. “Jack Johnson is a fair fighter,” Jeffries said in 1904, “but he is black, and for that reason I w ­ ill never fight him. If I w ­ ere not champion I would as soon meet a negro as any other man, but the title w ­ ill never go to a negro if\n\nFIG. 1 Jack Johnson and\n\nTommy Burns fight for the heavyweight title on December 26, 1908. Johnson’s victory made him the first Black heavyweight champion. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\n14 • The Boxing Film\n\nI can help it.”19 Jeffries retired as champ in 1905 and handed the title over to the relatively undistinguished Marvin Hart, who was deposed by the Canadian Tommy Burns seven months l­ ater. ­A fter over two years of Johnson’s goading and an offer that escalated to thirty thousand dollars, Burns fi­nally granted the Black challenger a title match in Sydney, Australia, on December 26, 1908. Promoter Hugh D. “Huge Deal” McIntosh marketed the fight and its films through emphasizing the racial tensions they would put on display. One advertisement for the films promised that “the Champion Representatives of White and Black races” would meet “for Racial and Individual Supremacy” in the biggest fight “since Cinematographic pictures have become a fine art.”20 Johnson easily controlled the match and even jeered Burns throughout it ­until police s­topped the competition in the ­fourteenth round. Some reports indicated that authorities cut out the cameras prior to ending the match. ­Others said the films ­were ­later edited to excise Burns’s humiliating final moments.21 E ­ ither way, the fight was terminated before cameras could document Johnson overcoming the White champion. Johnson was well aware of the cameras’ placement and, reflecting the stage directions Edison gave to Corbett a de­cade ­earlier, he made sure they would clearly showcase the ease with which he dispatched Burns—­and the g­ reat plea­ sure he took in d­ oing so. According to ringside reporter Jack London, Johnson “cuffed and smiled, and in the clinches whirled his opponent around so as to be able to assume beatific and angelic facial expressions for the cinematograph machines.”22 McIntosh, who refereed the fight, said the films “did not half tell how badly [Burns] was punished.” Johnson’s “best punches,” McIntosh claimed, ­were delivered while Burns had his back to the cameras and the challenger was posing for them.23 The films, however, w ­ ere persuasive enough to convince the New York Times that the best man prevailed. “To ­those who saw the pictures t­ here is no mystery why Johnson won,” the newspaper reported. “­There was not a single minute from the tap of the first gong to the time when the Police Inspector s­ topped the contest in the f­ ourteenth round that Johnson was not clearly the master of Burns.”24 The films proved that Johnson did not simply win the match but was Burns’s “master”—­a loaded term to apply to a Black man beating a White champion that was certainly not lost on the publication’s editors. Johnson’s victory, exhibited repeatedly on film around the world, made him the first ever Black heavyweight champ and fractured the white supremacist ideology that previous champions safeguarded by ducking Black opponents. Films of Johnson’s October 1909 title defense against Stanley Ketchel even more convincingly verified the new champion’s prowess. Rumors swirled that Johnson agreed to carry Ketchel long enough to ensure film profits. Unlike the Burns fight, authorities did not stop the Ketchel match and the cameras captured Johnson knocking out his White opponent in the twelfth round. Streible\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 15\n\nclaims the films established Johnson as the first Black movie star and constitute the earliest instances of African American cinema given their im­mense popularity at Black theaters.25 The productions also elicited ravenous calls for Johnson to be ousted by a White contender—­a White Hope—­who would restore the racial order he so brazenly shattered. Embittered critics charged that Johnson’s championship was illegitimate since Burns never beat Jim Jeffries—­ claims that cascaded into an effort to coax Jeffries out of retirement. Even though he had not competed or trained in five years, Jeffries agreed to fight Johnson in San Francisco on July 4, 1910. He claimed to be motivated principally by “that portion of the white race that has been looking to me to defend its athletic superiority” and said he was fighting “for the sole purpose of proving that a white man is better than a negro.”26 Media coverage similarly framed the fight as a proving ground for racial superiority—an effective strategy for selling papers to a readership that stretched beyond the typical sports fan. But Jeffries was at least as driven by the unpre­ce­dented financial rewards the “Fight of the ­Century” promised. Most of this money would come from Vitagraph’s film proceeds, two thirds of which he and Johnson agreed to split. The Johnson-­Jeffries fight relocated to Reno ­after San Francisco mayor P. H. McCarthy withdrew his city from hosting the controversial match. The Nevada city became the “center of the universe” leading up to the bout, which drew six hundred reporters from around the globe. “It is no exaggeration,” reported the trade publication Moving Picture World, “to say that the entire world w ­ ill await pictorial repre­sen­ta­tion of the fight.” Vitagraph’s Johnson-­Jeffries Fight “became more widely discussed than any motion picture of its era.” The production com­ pany used nine cameras in relays of three to ensure nothing was missed and to cover enough a­ ngles so that editors could patch together a dramatic final product.27 Johnson-­Jeffries also included introductory material of the fighters readying for the event and unsurprisingly presented Jeffries as the more sympathetic protagonist. Despite the film’s stylistic innovations, Moving Picture World speculated that Vitagraph’s production would underperform financially ­unless Jeffries won. The observation elicited speculation that Johnson—­who was always more of an opportunist than an activist—­might throw the fight to cash in on his share of the film proceeds.28 But Johnson cruised to a fifteenth-­round technical knockout, taunting Jeffries and his corner (which included Jim Corbett) as he punished the out-­of-­ shape former champ. Gilmore says the victory “had the effect of a second emancipation” for African Americans. “Never before had they witnessed at once such collective celebrating and race pride manifested t­ oward a single event.” The fight’s result provoked widespread hate crimes that included the murder of eigh­teen African American men. One Black man in New Orleans was reportedly shot for entering a local diner and gleefully crowing, “Gimme eggs, beat and scrambled, like Jim Jeffries.” The fight films—as testaments to\n\n16 • The Boxing Film\n\nJohnson’s inciting achievement—­were immediately identified as dangerous items that necessitated containment. One postfight report indicated that spectators during the Reno match entreated cameramen to “cut out the pictures” as it became evident that Johnson would win—­requests that suggest film rec­ ords of the defeat ­were as threatening as the event itself.29 As the San Francisco Examiner reported, “within twenty-­four hours” of Johnson’s victory demands to suppress the films “assumed the proportions of a national crusade.” The Society for Christian Endeavor “telegraphed ­every governor and big city mayor in the country advocating for the film’s prohibition,” and former president Theodore Roo­se­velt published a denunciation of fight films in Outlook magazine.30 The Johnson-­Jeffries film was banned throughout the southern United States, and the mayors of Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Cincinnati, and Toledo issued executive ­orders barring screenings in their cities. ­England and South Africa followed suit. “­There was never a time when the general interests of the moving picture business ­were more at stake than during the period immediately following the Johnson-­Jeffries fight,” Moving Picture World commented. “For years and years fights have been reproduced in moving pictures, and it was not ­until the Reno fight that the guardians of public morals discovered that such pictures ­were beyond the pale of public policy.” Vitagraph’s film of a Black champion reducing a symbol of White virility to a bruised and pitiful lump sent the entire film industry into crisis. Creative entrepreneurs devised a collection of efforts to get around bans of the Johnson-­Jeffries Fight that included lantern slide exhibitions, parodies, and re-­creations featuring actors as the fighters. The American Cinephone Com­pany’s Jack Johnson’s Own Story of the Big Fight filmed Johnson narrating his experience in the fight while wearing a tuxedo. Exhibitors would play the audio and film components in tandem. An advertisement for the production in Moving Picture World stressed that “­these pictures can be shown anywhere” and that they offered a substitute for ­those locations where films of the fight w ­ ere banned.31 While Johnson-­Jeffries was widely prohibited, fight films continued to circulate legally u­ ntil Congress passed the 1912 Sims Act immediately ­a fter Johnson’s July 4, 1912, title defense against “Fireman” Jim Flynn, another undistinguished White Hope he defeated without much trou­ble. The ban, led by Tennessee’s Thetus Sims and Georgia’s Seaborn A. Roddenbery, was modeled ­after restrictions on obscene publications. The congressmen originally wanted the prohibition to encompass “any rec­ord or account of betting” on prizefights, but it was amended to targeting only films. The Sims Act restricted the interstate transportation of all fight films, but it was designed to stop depictions of Johnson, whose Blackness ensured the overtly racist legislation’s successful passage. Roddenbery called Johnson’s victory over Flynn “the grossest instance of base fraud and bogus effort at a fair fight between a\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 17\n\nCaucasian brute and an African biped beast that has ever taken place. It was repulsive. This bill is designed to prevent the display to morbid-­minded adults and susceptible youth all over the country of repre­sen­ta­tion of such a disgusting spectacle.” Roddenbery made even more explicit the racism driving the legislation by claiming that “no man descended from the Old Saxon race can look upon that kind of contest without abhorrence and disgust.”32 The Sims Act sequestered l­egal fight films to the state where their featured match took place and, as a result, rendered the thriving genre unprofitable. It also quarantined Johnson’s image and ­limited his ability to earn. Shortly ­after the legislation passed, Johnson was charged ­under the Mann Act for taking his White girlfriend Lucille Cameron (whom he eventually married) across state lines for what prosecutors deemed “immoral purposes.” He was convicted on the trumped-up charges the following year but fled to Eu­rope before entering prison. Although Johnson took his title with him across the Atlantic, t­ hese racist l­egal conspiracies largely removed the boxer and his publicly projected image from American life. Johnson returned to North Amer­i­ca in April 1915 to defend his title against Jess Willard in Havana. The enormous White Kansan, known as the Pottawatomie ­Giant, knocked Johnson out in the twenty-­sixth round. Films of the match ­were produced despite the ban, with speculators assuming the prohibition would not be enforced since the White fighter triumphed. But the ban was upheld despite ravenous demand for films of Johnson’s long-­awaited defeat. The restrictions prompted one entrepreneur to proj­ect the film across the Canadian border and rerecord it in New York State to claim it was technically produced in that location—an inventive gambit that was nevertheless quashed.33 Jess Willard rarely defended his title. He preferred to capitalize on his exalted status by appearing on the vaudev­ille stage, and even in a circus act briefly.34 To be sure, many would rather have an idle White champ than an active Johnson, and Willard reinstituted the color line. Black contenders w ­ ere again unofficially barred from opportunities to compete for the title, and t­ hose films of Johnson that circulated did so only illegally. But boxing expanded and gained legitimacy amid Willard’s mostly inactive reign. While films of a­ ctual prizefights w ­ ere forced under­g round, the budding Hollywood industry routinely used the sport as the backdrop for fictional productions that spanned genres. Boxing offered a stage for the physical action and humor commonplace in ­silent cinema and proved able to lure both men and ­women to the theater by combining sports and drama. Keystone Studios’ The Knockout (1914) starred Fatty Arbuckle as the down-­and-­out drifter Pug and included Charlie Chaplin in a supporting role as a bumbling referee. Pug changes his destitute fortune by posing as the boxing champion Cyclone Flynn. His ruse works ­until the real Cyclone (Edgar Kennedy) appears and challenges him to a fight, which Pug has no chance of winning. Their match quickly\n\n18 • The Boxing Film\n\ndevolves into a series of pratfalls highlighted by Chaplin bouncing around the ring while unsuccessfully attempting to officiate the chaotic contest. Other boxing films built on the sport’s association with gambling and vice. Chaplin’s The Champion (1915), Jerome Storm’s The Egg Crate Wallop (1919), and Bray Productions’ Krazy Kat cartoon The Best Mouse Loses (1920) all center on fighters tempted to throw bouts—­a theme that became a staple of the genre. Despite their prohibition, fight films resurfaced as illicit po­liti­cal weapons used to combat a spread of racist productions that ­were emboldened by the Sims Act, most infamously D. W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation (1915). Cultural critic Gerald Early speculates that Griffith had Johnson in mind when he made his film, which offers a retelling of the Civil War that depicts Black men as savages, condemns miscegenation, and glorifies the Ku Klux Klan. Griffith’s film, in fact, was the first motion picture screened in the White House and gathered rave reviews from President Woodrow Wilson, who enthusiastically likened it to “writing history with lightning.” Black newspaper editors, however, pointed out the hy­poc­risy that allowed Birth of a Nation to circulate freely—­even in the White House—­while films of Johnson’s conquests w ­ ere suppressed. Some Black theaters staged defiant screenings of Johnson-­Jeffries Fight to protest Birth of a Nation.35\n\nThe Golden Age of Sports Media The military began teaching soldiers to box during World War I, and ­these GIs returned home with an interest in the sport that a growing mass media industry identified and served. Guided by man­ag­er Jack “Doc” Kearns and promoter Tex Rickard, Jack Dempsey emerged out of Manassa, Colorado, to give this swelling sports media market one of the biggest stars of the 1920s. Kearns viewed sports as another facet of entertainment that merited the same type of ballyhoo that moves Hollywood properties. “Like a strip tease, I always figured you c­ ouldn’t get anywhere without exposure,” he explained.36 While Dempsey’s ring rec­ord did not obviously warrant a title shot, Kearns transformed him into a self-­made Western tough guy and stoked a rivalry with Willard by harnessing a happily obliging press. Kearns delivered newspaper clippings on Dempsey to sportswriters, whose coverage created enough buzz for Rickard to book a title match on July 4, 1919, in Toledo. Kearns billed the smaller challenger as Jack the G ­ iant Killer, who would endeavor to slay the lumbering and comparatively uncharismatic Willard. He also created the Jack Dempsey Revue vaudev­ille show to generate interest prior to the match.37 Willard capitalized on the fight buildup by starring in the feature melodrama The Challenge of Chance (1919). He played a virtuous ranch foreman who buys ­horses for a crooked El Paso trader (Harry von Meter). But once he learns of his boss’s plans to rob an innocent maiden\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 19\n\n(Fay Calvert), he elects to protect the young w ­ oman through a series of gallant acts that make frequent use of his famed punching ability. Billboard remarked on The Challenge of Chance’s potential to attract w ­ omen through its romantic themes and speculated that the film would perform particularly well if Willard remained champion.38 But Dempsey knocked Willard out in the third round to fulfill the heroic image Kearns manufactured and to establish himself as the Manassa Mauler. Though films of the fight ­were prohibited, newspapers more than compensated and made Dempsey “the greatest boon to circulation in twenty years.” The new champ’s ascendance coincided with sports media’s proliferation across print, film, and radio. This expanding media infrastructure, much like the emergent Hollywood studio system, needed stars around whom to focus its efforts. Kearns and Dempsey collaborated with media prac­ti­tion­ers to give, in media historian Bruce J. Evensen’s words, “the public the Dempsey it wanted.”39 Sport historian Benjamin G. Rader suggests Dempsey embodied commercial entertainment’s role as a salve for the alienation that accompanied modernity: “As the society became more complicated and systematized and as success had to be won increasingly in bureaucracies, the need for heroes who leaped to fame and fortune outside the rules of the system needed to grow. No longer ­were the heroes the lone business tycoon or the statesmen, but the ‘stars’—­from movies and sports.”40 Dempsey fused ­these two va­ri­e­ties of idols to establish a new brand of hypermediated sports celebrity. Five boxing matches gathered million-­dollar gates during the 1920s. Dempsey was the featured attraction in all of them. Kearns reminded Dempsey that his livelihood depended on the media coverage he attracted. “It’s impor­tant, Champ,” the man­ag­er told Dempsey, “to keep the sportswriters on your side.”41 The boxing magazine Ring launched in 1920, and newspaper sports sections became commonplace by the ­middle of the de­cade, with nationally syndicated scribes like Grantland Rice, Damon Runyon, Paul Gallico, Ring Lardner, and W. O. McGeehan serving as Dempsey’s key chroniclers. ­These writers built and sustained their readerships by prioritizing vivid yarn spinning over neutral, fact-­based reportage. As Grantland Rice—­the most famous of the bunch—­asserted with characteristic grandness, “When a sportswriter stops making heroes out of athletes, it’s time to get out of the business.”42 Though Rice took Dempsey to task for never serving in World War I, a critique that dogged the boxer throughout his ­career, he also routinely deified the Manassa Mauler. ­A fter Dempsey beat Willard, Rice described the new champion as “the greatest fighting tornado, in a boxing way, the game has ever known” who “must be able to hit harder than any man that ever lived.” Matching his colleague’s flowery prose, Runyon likened Dempsey to a “young mountain lion in ­human form, from the Sangre de Christo Hills of Colorado.”43\n\n20 • The Boxing Film\n\nBy the mid-1920s, one in e­ very four readers purchased newspapers for the sports pages that featured such overblown writing. Publications allowed their profitable sports divisions greater editorial leeway than other pages, an affordance that precipitated sports reporting’s marginalized reputation as journalism’s frivolous “toy department.”44 Rickard admitted that paying sportswriters became “a routine business expense” well worth the investment ­because of the exposure it yielded. ­These journalists ­were hired expressly to imbue their sporting subjects with drama and romance that resonated with the Hollywood tales that had also begun to sell so well. The sportswriter Robert Lipsyte suggests the 1920s Golden Age of Sports would be better described as the Golden Age of Sports Writing given the influence ­these journalists had on public understandings of figures like Dempsey.45 While centrally impor­tant, sportswriters ­were joined by Hollywood films, newsreels, radio, and the intersections across ­these media. The 1920s Golden Age of Sports Writing, then, may be even more accurately labeled the Golden Age of Sports Media. Shortly ­a fter winning the championship, Dempsey appeared in a comic newsreel with Chaplin and the actor Douglas Fairbanks. The newsreel exhibited sport and Hollywood’s increased intermingling along with Dempsey’s ascension. Unable to make significant money off films of his matches, Dempsey began appearing in scripted dramas. The champion, in fact, worked far more in film than in boxing through the 1920s. With a face caked in stage makeup to soften his harsh mug, Dempsey first played Jack Derry in Pathé’s 1920 serial Daredevil Jack. The serial begins with Jack’s ­family being swindled out of their Nevada gold mine. Derry perseveres amid the adversity. He enrolls in college, becomes a star football player, and falls in love with a popu­lar coed (Josie Sedgwick). But Derry quickly discovers that his beloved’s f­ ather (Herschel Mayall) is the very crook who cheated his ­family out of their mine. He eventually wins her love as well as her ­father’s begrudging re­spect by beating up a gang of thugs and earning enough money to go into business for himself. Daredevil Jack’s plot is borderline nonsensical; but the film was l­ ittle more than an excuse to “show Jess Willard’s conqueror to the film fans.” A Pathé advertisement plugged the production by stressing Dempsey’s status as “the best known man in the world” and reassuring exhibitors that Daredevil Jack was “not a prize-­fight serial” that would be hindered by the film ban.46 Jack Johnson returned to the United States in 1920 and was incarcerated in the Leavenworth Penitentiary ­until July 1921 for his Mann Act conviction. But the former champion still inspired vari­ous race films during the early 1920s. Oscar Micheaux’s The Brute (1920), for instance, evokes the Johnson mystique and features the Black fighter Sam Langford. Other race films cast the divisive former champion ­a fter his release from Leavenworth. As the World Rolls In (1921) stars Johnson as a trainer who helps a young man (Reed Thomas) learn\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 21\n\nhow to protect himself and win a girl’s (Blanche Thompson) heart; the fantastical melodrama Black Thunderbolt (1921) features Johnson as a gallant strongman; and Johnson plays a fighter who flees to Mexico ­after taking the blame for a crime his ­brother (Andrian Joyce) committed in For His ­Mother’s Sake (1922). The films ­were carefully marketed as noncontroversial. A trade publication report on Black Thunderbolt assured exhibitors that the production “is said to contain nothing that would be offensive to any.” But the Ohio State Bureau of Motion Pictures banned For His M ­ other’s Sake from exhibition in the state b­ ecause of Johnson’s criminal past.47 Johnson’s image remained polarizing—­even when he played fictional and seemingly sympathetic roles. Meanwhile, violent productions like The Challenge of Chance and Daredevil Jack circulated without incident. Already a star in print and on film, Dempsey’s media-­driven image helped to stimulate commercial radio’s emergence with his July 1921 title defense against Georges Carpentier in Jersey City. Rickard promoted the fight by billing Carpentier as a war hero and emphasizing Dempsey’s reputation as a slacker. Upon the urging of Madison Square Garden promoter Julius Hopp, media executive David Sarnoff de­cided that broadcasting Dempsey-­Carpentier via wireless radio would publicize his fledgling RCA and help it to compete with Westing­house for market share of the new medium. Sarnoff secured Rickard’s permission and arranged to relay the match from ringside via a direct wire to a transmitter two miles away in Hoboken, which broadcast the signal, according to Wireless Age, “more than 125,000 square miles.”48 Sarnoff established goodwill for RCA’s experiment by attaching it to war relief charities. He collaborated with philanthropist Anne Morgan (the d­ aughter of J. P. Morgan) and assistant secretary of the Navy, and eventual president, Franklin Delano Roo­se­velt to donate portions of the broadcast’s proceeds to the Committee for Devastated France and the Navy Club. Sarnoff conscripted RCA employee J. Andrew White, a well-­known figure in radio who served as the acting president of the National Amateur Wireless Association and editor of Wireless Age, to h ­ andle the ringside fight call. White’s blow-­by-­blow, however, went only as far as the Hoboken transmitter, where RCA technician J. O. Smith relayed White’s account for the thousands listening to the wireless broadcast. Rickard worked with Sarnoff to equip auditoriums, town halls, movie theaters, Elks clubs, and other communal spaces throughout the East Coast with the receivers and amplifiers necessary to exhibit the match. Wireless Age estimated that about three hundred thousand heard the fight—­the largest radio audience ever to that point.49 While Dempsey knocked out Carpentier in the third round, the quick fight turned out to be a blessing for RCA, whose transmitter likely would have melted down had the bout lasted much longer. Aided by the radio exposure, Dempsey-­Carpentier\n\n22 • The Boxing Film\n\ngenerated boxing’s first million-­dollar gate. R ­ euters dubbed RCA’s transmission “the world’s first real broadcast,” and Wireless Age praised it as “the ushering in of a new era” of commercial radio.50 Rickard sold Fred Quimby the rights to film Dempsey-­Carpentier on the condition that the filmmaker emphasize the fight’s status as a legitimate undertaking. Accordingly, Quimby’s production opens with shots of Rickard joining New Jersey’s governor for an inspection of the Jersey City arena prior to the match. Although still officially banned, the Dempsey-­Carpentier films managed to circulate widely and turn a profit.51 But the fight established radio broadcasts—­many of which ­were consumed in the same theatrical spaces that exhibited fight films—as the preferred way to experience big matches for t­ hose who could not attend them in person. Evensen describes the flood of media coverage surrounding Jack Dempsey as “Dempseymania”—an obsession with the celebrity that helped him to earn more money than any athlete of the 1920s, a de­cade that included the likes of Babe Ruth and Bobby Jones. “We are all part of the Dempsey cult,” admitted Paul Gallico, “and we ­were blinded by our own ballyhoo.” Dempseymania maintained its economic value in part by reinforcing the white supremacist attitudes Johnson threatened; in fact one could convincingly argue that Dempsey’s star value was negligible without his Whiteness. Rickard, for instance, would not let Dempsey, who said he was game to compete against anyone, fight the Black contender Harry ­Wills. “If a nigger wins the championship, then the championship ­a in’t worth a nickel,” Rickard said. “That’s what Johnson taught us.”52 Dempsey did not defend his title between 1923 and 1926. Like Willard, he cashed in on his status through acting, public appearances, and occasional exhibitions that did not risk the championship. In 1924, Universal Pictures’ president, Carl Laemmle, signed Dempsey to a million-­dollar contract to appear in a string of adventure-­themed serials titled Fight and Win. Dempsey played the gallant Tiger Jack O’Day, and the installments boasted titles that include Winning His Way, The Title Holder, and K.O. for Cupid. As part of the contract, Laemmle stipulated that Dempsey would train at a fa­cil­i­ty on the Universal lot.53 In 1925, Dempsey married the film star Estelle Taylor, whom he met while hobnobbing with the Hollywood set. Upon his new bride’s urging, the champ underwent plastic surgery to make his mangled nose resemble more closely ­those of his statuesque movie star peers. Dempsey and Taylor then costarred in the feature Manhattan Madness (1925). Dempsey plays Steve O’Dare, a transplanted western cowhand who returns east to collect money he is owed. O’Dare’s college friends prank him by staging the kidnapping of Taylor’s character, known only as “the girl.” O’Dare takes courageous mea­sures to rescue the beautiful ingénue—­and turns on his pals when they reveal the mean-­spirited hoax. In the pro­cess, he and the girl fall in love. Like Daredevil Jack, the unexceptional film drew interest primarily ­because of Dempsey’s involvement. The\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 23\n\nFIG. 2 Jack Dempsey and his wife, Estelle Taylor, star in Manhattan Madness (1925). Promotion for the film billed Taylor as “Mrs. Jack Dempsey” to enhance the production’s appeal. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nstars w ­ ere marketed as “Mr. and Mrs. Jack Dempsey” to emphasize the champion’s presence in the film. As Variety sarcastically put it, “Mrs. Jack Dempsey is more widely heralded than Estelle Taylor.”54 Dempsey fi­nally defended his title against Gene Tunney in September 1926. Rickard plugged the Philadelphia fight in ways that reflected his promotion of Dempsey-­Carpentier.55 He marketed Gene “The Fighting Marine” Tunney as a brave combat veteran and billed Dempsey as an antiheroic draft dodger. Pathé hired Tunney to star in The Fighting Marine (1926), a serial it released just prior to the fight to exploit the interest surrounding it. Like Dempsey, Tunney understood that he needed media attention, and he invested 5 ­percent of his income into publicity. But—­and despite his distinguished military service—­Tunney lacked Dempsey’s populist charisma. The educated pugilist was widely viewed as pretentious and wooden. He also fought with a cautious and defensive style that bored fans and contrasted Dempsey’s more dramatic tendency to take big hits and swing freely in pursuit of explosive knockouts.56 Anticipation for the fight, according to Evensen, was so g­ reat that the Associated Press established a twelve-­person sports department to cover it. Grantland Rice, in a rare moment of cynicism, called Dempsey-­Tunney “the golden\n\n24 • The Boxing Film\n\nfleece”—­a match overshadowed by the hype surrounding it.57 Philadelphia’s Sesquicentennial Stadium attracted 130,000 spectators for the fight. RCA built on its experimental 1921 Dempsey-­Carpentier broadcast by using Dempsey-­ Tunney to publicize the launch of its National Broadcast Com­pany—­the United States’ first major network. RCA reasoned that the big-­ticket fight would accelerate radio’s growth into a medium that would eventually deliver “­every event of national importance to ­every home in Amer­i­ca.”58 The NBC broadcast—­hosted by Graham McNamee and relayed via a thirty-­one-­station network—­reached thirty-­nine million listeners. It was again exhibited in movie theaters and other public places. Most of the showings ­were sponsored by newspapers that owned radio stations and used the broadcast to promote their content across platforms. An advertisement in Dayton, Ohio’s, Dayton Eve­ning Herald stressed that all fight fans—­“Men, ­Women, C ­ hildren”—­were invited to hear the match at the city’s Memorial Hall, which held three thousand and would feature “4 RCA Loudspeakers Placed So That All May Hear ­Every Word.”59 The fight, which the calculating and methodical Tunney won by a unan­i­mous decision, generated nearly two million dollars—­unprecedented and radio-­driven profits that made a rematch imminent. Staged at Chicago’s Soldier Field almost exactly one year a­ fter their first encounter, Dempsey and Tunney’s rematch was an even grander spectacle than the Philadelphia tilt. A smattering of Hollywood celebrities including Chaplin, Arbuckle, Fairbanks, and Buster Keaton—­a group as interested in the publicity their presence at the match would generate as in viewing the bout—­ purchased ringside seats. Death row inmates used their last requests to hear NBC’s broadcast, which McNamee announced to fifty million listeners through a fifty-­eight-­station hookup. Tunney again won the fight by a unan­i­mous decision, but this time u­ nder suspicious circumstances. New rules instituted before the match required fighters to retire to a neutral corner ­a fter knocking opponents down. When Dempsey did not immediately comply with the new regulation ­a fter flooring Tunney in the seventh, referee Dave Barry delayed his count by several seconds. Many claimed Tunney was down longer than ten seconds and that Dempsey should have regained the title. The legendary status Dempsey and Tunney’s rematch has acquired in U.S. sport history is a testament more to the proliferation of convergent mass media during the 1920s than to the fight itself. The “long count” became the rematch’s key storyline. Ten fight fans reportedly died of heart attacks while listening to McNamee narrate Tunney’s knockdown. The controversy also increased demands for films of the fight, which would allow audiences to judge what happened for themselves. In this case, the ban could not quell interest in Goodart Pictures’ film of the bout, which ran nationwide. Rickard stoked the controversy further by manipulating films to make it seem Tunney was down longer than the original recordings showed. Streible explains that thirty-­five New York\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 25\n\nCity theaters openly screened the Tunney-­Dempsey Fight, including some f­ amily movie h ­ ouses.60 The popu­lar film rendered the fight picture ban an outmoded and largely unenforceable restriction akin to the prohibition of alcohol. Dempsey retired ­a fter the rematch and turned his full attention to acting. Expanding on Fight and Win, he starred as Tiger Jack Dillon in the 1928 Broadway play The Big Fight. Aided by Dempseymania, boxing remained a consistent topic for fictional films into the sound era—­from comedies like Laurel and Hardy’s ­Battle of the C ­ entury (1927) to melodramas like Iron Man (1931) and The Champ (1931) to the musical Young Man of Manhattan (1930). ­These productions often evoked the identifiable Dempsey archetype. For example, Buster Keaton’s Battling Butler (1926) centers on the pampered Alfred Butler, who is sent on a hunting and fishing trip to become a man. Butler encounters and falls in love with a hardscrabble mountain girl (Sally O’Neil) during the masculine rite of passage. To win her love, and gain the re­spect of her similarly hardy ­family, Butler poses as a fighter with the same surname—­Battling Butler. His comic effort to prove his manly vigor works through masquerading as the sort of frontier tough guy Dempsey represents and reinforcing the Western fighter’s position as a virile ideal. The Champ, The Life of Jimmy Dolan (1933), and Winner Take All (1932) similarly situate the American West that Dempsey signified as a haven of masculine vitality. Winner Take All references Dempsey’s enchantment by the comparatively soft culture Hollywood represents. It focuses on the fast-­living boxer Jimmy Kane (James Cagney), who leaves New York City for New Mexico’s Rosario Ranch to take a break from “booze and dames.”61 While regaining his bearings, he falls for Peggy (Marian Nixon), a ­widow whose son is recovering from an illness. At one point Kane takes a fight in Tijuana to help the struggling Peggy pay her son’s (Dickie Moore) medical bills. He eventually returns to New York and promises eventually to send for Peggy. But Kane soon falls into the same de­cadent scene that he originally fled. In par­tic­u ­lar, he becomes infatuated with the superficial socialite Joan (­Virginia Bruce), who finds Kane’s rowdy profession thrilling but is embarrassed by his coarseness. Desperate to win Joan’s love, Kane turns down a title shot in ­favor of undergoing plastic surgery to fix his battered nose and cauliflower ear. He also enrolls in etiquette courses to fit in with Joan’s haughty clique. At one point Kane’s etiquette teacher suggests he recite Shakespeare to work on his diction. “I d­ on’t want any of that Shakespeare guy,” Kane retorts. “He’s the one that ruined Tunney.” Kane’s misguided and ultimately in­effec­tive efforts to impress Joan work through evoking Dempsey’s story and commenting on the intellectualism that tarnished Tunney’s image. Less directly, Laurel and Hardy’s ­Battle of the ­Century lampooned overblown sporting events like Dempsey and Tunney’s fights. The main characters begin a slapstick scuffle that degenerates into a\n\n26 • The Boxing Film\n\ntown-­wide pie fight. A send-up of so many bouts promoted as the “Fight of the ­Century,” Laurel and Hardy’s romp comments on the frivolity under­lying the excessive spectacles that captivated millions and nourished a growing sports media industry. Th ­ ese boxing films also contributed to the racial politics Dempsey enforced during his championship reign by depicting a sport populated entirely by White heroes.\n\nBoxing Films in Transmedia Sports Culture Boxing films stressed the sport’s increasingly spectacular status by dramatizing its relationship to the media it attracted and supported. Melodramas like Iron Man, Winner Take All, and The Big Chance (1933) integrate newspaper headlines to emphasize protagonists’ celebrity and convey their transformation into stars. The Big Chance uses a montage of newspaper reports to show main character Frankie Morgan’s (John Darrow) ascendance into a promising fighter that gangsters unsuccessfully attempt to bribe. Winner Take All employs a similar montage of sports pages to convey Kane’s successes upon his initial return to New York City. Such newspaper-­themed transitional devices are not exclusive to boxing films, of course, but they demonstrate prizefighting’s intimate alliance with print during the Golden Age of Sports Media. More specifically, they highlight newspapers’ role in granting celebrity boxers their status, which often composes the centerpiece of the films’ dramatic conflict. Along ­these lines, Winner Take All includes a sequence in which a tabloid publication criticizes Kane for his plastic surgery and suggests he has become soft. The headline reads, “Fighter Becomes Social Lap Dog. How the Two-­Fisted Champion of the Prize Ring Became a ‘Powder Puff’ Boxer by Having His Nose and Ears Made over by a Plastic Surgeon to Please the Whims of a Pretty Society Girl.” The sports page includes a cartoon of a cowardly Kane fleeing his opponent in an effort to protect his expensive new features. Other boxing films more directly integrated print media into their plots. In Night Parade (1929), the sportswriter Sid Durham (Lee Shumway) helps to dissuade middleweight champion Bobby Martin (Hugh Trevor) from throwing a fight. And Young Man of Manhattan opens at Dempsey and Tunney’s first encounter in Philadelphia. The sportswriter Toby McLean (Norman Foster) meets the entertainment columnist Ann Vaughn (Claudette Colbert) at the big fight, and they form the relationship that makes up the musical’s key narrative thread. Young Man of Manhattan comments on Dempsey-­Tunney’s status as a mega event that preoccupied the entire media industry and was newsworthy enough to attract entertainment writers as well as sports journalists. The ­Great White Way (1924), a production of William Randolph Hearst’s Cosmopolitan Pictures that Warner ­Brothers ­later remade as Cain and Mabel (1936), explores the blurry lines separating news from publicity in the 1920s.\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 27\n\nThe s­ ilent comedy centers on welterweight champion Joe Cain (Oscar Shaw), who has become so dominant in the ring that fans ­will no longer pay to see him compete. On the recommendation of Tex Rickard, who plays himself, Cain hires Jack Murray (T. Roy Barnes) to be his press agent. Murray also represents the dancer Mabel Vandergrift (Anita Stewart) and devises a plan to gin up publicity by saying the famous dancer and boxer are engaged. Like so many rom-­ com duos, the celebrities initially dislike each other but eventually fall in love. Beyond The G ­ reat White Way’s promotional plotline, the Hearst film glorifies the intersecting newspaper and publicity industries and features prominently the media mogul’s properties as product placements. “Part of the film might easily be mistaken for an educational reel entitled ‘The Making of a Newspaper,’ ” commented the Washington Post given the blatant marketing the production gives to Hearst’s properties. Other film producers complained that The ­Great White Way enjoyed an unfair advantage ­because of the promotion it received in Hearst newspapers.62 Iron Man, The Big Chance, Night Parade, and They Never Come Back (1932) display nascent radio broadcasts alongside the newspaper coverage. Like the coverage in newspapers, the depictions of ringside radio broadcasts and postfight interviews stress boxing’s growth into a popu­lar and commodified media spectacle. A ­ fter the fight that composes The Big Chance’s climax, a radio reporter (George Morrell) rushes into the ring to interview the triumphant Frankie Morgan. “­There’s twenty million ­people out t­ here just waiting to hear the words of the champion,” the sportscaster says, emphasizing the im­mense audience to which the broadcast makes the fight available. The Life of Jimmy Dolan (1933), a melodrama Busby Berkeley remade as They Made Me a Criminal in 1939, depicts the combined and increasingly symbiotic importance of print and radio to prizefighting. It begins with boxer Jimmy Dolan (Douglas Fairbanks) winning a championship fight. In a postfight radio interview, the boxer pre­sents himself as a gracious and abstemious young man who loves his m ­ other above all. He even uses the interview to convey a message to his mom, who is listening at home. “I’m coming home! I got the money, and you can get that ­house in Yonkers,” he proudly announces. Dolan’s pious image, constructed through radio, has made him a popu­lar sensation—­a family-­friendly breath of fresh air among the sport’s ste­reo­t ypically rowdy and inarticulate bruisers. The radio report sums up the fight broadcast’s glowing depiction of Dolan: “ ‘No booze, no ­women,’ said the new champion. Amer­i­ca can be well proud of Jimmy to­night, who by his victory vindicates the sponsors of this program, the Health Biscuit Corporation of Amer­i­ca.” But the film transitions to shots of a disheveled h ­ otel room littered with empty b­ ottles and cigarette butts as the broadcast extols Dolan’s virtue. Dolan is drunk and lounging with the dissolute vixen Goldie West (Shirley Grey). His pristine image is a cynical ruse he concocted with the scheming man­ag­er Doc\n\n28 • The Boxing Film\n\nWoods (Lyle Talbot)—­a reference to Doc Kearns—to garner positive attention and the economic rewards that accompany it. Woods and some friends join Dolan and Goldie for a postfight cele­bration. One of the guests, unbeknownst to Dolan and Woods, is the journalist Charles Magee (George Meeker). The reporter quietly observes Dolan joking about his sham and the gullible public that falls for it. “I h ­ aven’t got a m ­ other,” Dolan divulges with an inebriated snicker. “That’s just a line for suckers.” Shortly thereafter, Magee reveals that he is a journalist and that he intends to expose Dolan’s duplicity. “Sure, I’m ­going to write it up,” he responds to Dolan’s attempt to dissuade him. “I’m a reporter and that’s my business.” Dolan then offers Magee a bribe, which the journalist rejects with a righ­teous huff. Drunk and searching for a way to stop the obstinate Magee from revealing his lie, Dolan punches and accidentally kills the reporter. He immediately passes out alongside the corpse he created and the ­bottles he spent the eve­ning emptying. The crooked Woods steals Dolan’s watch and takes off with the equally conniving Goldie—­only to die in a fiery car wreck while attempting to outrun the police. Th ­ ose inspecting the rubble find Dolan’s watch and assume he is the dead driver. Only Phlaxer (Guy Kibbee), a disgraced and aging detective, suspects that Woods’s charred corpse is not Dolan when he notices that the boxer is a southpaw and the dead body was not wearing the watch on the appropriate wrist. Dolan wakes the next morning to the stunning and hung­over realization that he killed Magee. The boxer flees west when he sees a newspaper report commenting on his apparent death. Dolan ends up at a farm for disabled ­children in Pleasant Valley, Utah, run by Mrs. Moore (Aline MacMahon) and her niece Peggy (Loretta Young), who demonstrates a selflessness on par with the fake image Dolan once fashioned to court publicity. The fugitive, who goes by the alias Jack Daugherty, begins to work at the farm and teach the kids how to box. Dolan’s narcissistic worldview gradually shifts as he spends more time with Peggy and her innocent wards. Although his colleagues consider the Dolan case closed, Phlaxer believes the boxer is alive and continues searching for him. Scouring newspapers, the detective comes across a story on “Daugherty” training the kids and travels to Pleasant Valley to investigate. Phlaxer arrives just before Dolan is set to fight in a match against King Cobra (Sammy Stein) to raise money for the cash-­strapped farm. Knowing Phlaxer is on his tail, the boxer abandons his southpaw style to conceal his identity from the wily old gumshoe. Phlaxer, however, is not fooled and apprehends the fugitive a­ fter the match. But when the detective notices Dolan’s moral transformation, he opts to let him go. “Say, maybe I got the wrong guy,” Phlaxer says knowingly as he releases Dolan to resume the newly virtuous life he established with Peggy and the kids.\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 29\n\nBeyond showing its protagonist’s conversion, The Life of Jimmy Dolan emphasizes how media combine to create boxing as a public commercial spectacle. Dolan builds his image through manipulating the press and radio. The prospect of Magee exposing Dolan’s phony but valuable persona in the press is so threatening that the boxer resorts to manslaughter—­albeit unintentional— to prevent the report from reaching newsstands. And Phlaxer relies principally on the newspaper coverage boxing attracts to conduct his detective work. Boxing films also traced how prizefighting aided radio’s transformation into a primarily domestic medium and helped to construct the gendered contours surrounding the changing medium’s consumption. Instead of attending Frankie Morgan’s final match as The Big Chance ends, Morgan’s love interest Mary—­who convinced the boxer not to throw the bout despite the financial benefits—­listens to the radio broadcast at home with her son Arthur. The fight scene cross-­cuts between Morgan struggling through the grueling match and Mary listening at home in agony. Similarly, Peggy and the c­ hildren stay at the farm and listen to the radio broadcast of Dolan’s fight against King Cobra. When the announcer reports that Dolan is losing, the kids begin to sob and Peggy, unable to listen further, turns off the set. The scenes demonstrate radio’s potential to convey unfolding events across spatial distance—­and they employ this breach to intensify the ­women spectators’ emotional longing and helplessness in the face of the boxers’ masculine strug­g le. Th ­ ese film depictions also encode the domestic sphere as feminine and indicate that radio broadcasts allow ­women and ­children to experience boxing at a remove from its corrupting brutality and seediness. Morgan and Dolan re­unite with their virtuous love interests, but outside the realm of prizefighting. Morgan even proposes to Mary via a postfight radio interview: “Let’s get married right away,” he says into the microphone to the ­woman he knows is listening at home. The films’ gendered depictions of the radio broadcasts’ consumption emphasize the domestic sphere’s purity and boxing’s comparative ruggedness while connecting ­these seemingly disparate zones. Such repre­sen­ta­tions extended into the tele­vi­sion era and became a common trope in the boxing film to stress the intersecting gender relations marking sport and media. W. S. Van Dyke’s The Prizefighter and the Lady (1933) shows how boxing propelled convergence among the multiple media that combined to build its spectacular status. The film stars heavyweight fighter Max Baer as Steve Morgan, a short-­fused barroom bouncer. Morgan impresses a washed-up and alcoholic former trainer, the Professor (Walter Huston), a­ fter dispatching a belligerent patron. The Professor convinces Morgan he has potential and begins to mold the raw talent into a contender. Morgan encounters the beautiful nightclub singer Belle (Myrna Loy) as his c­ areer takes off. The singer, who is in a relationship with the gangster and nightclub owner Willie Ryan (Otto Kruger), initially\n\n30 • The Boxing Film\n\nrebuffs Morgan’s swaggering flirtations. But Morgan eventually persuades her to leave Ryan and marry him. Like The Big Chance and Winner Take All, Prizefighter and the Lady uses a montage of newspaper clippings to trace Morgan’s rapid rise through the professional ranks. It also includes musical sequences of a vaudev­ille show starring Morgan that, like The Jack Dempsey Revue, was produced to capitalize on his swelling celebrity. The media-­driven fame Morgan so quickly acquires goes to his head just as rapidly. He begins philandering and stops listening to the Professor’s instruction. As a result, Morgan’s partnership with the sagacious trainer dissolves. Similarly, Belle leaves the untrustworthy fighter and returns to Ryan. Sensing Morgan’s mounting hubris, Ryan arranges for the prizefighter to take on the champion Primo Carnera, who plays himself. “Carnera ­will knock his fat head into the East River,” Ryan confidently wagers. The gangster books the match through Jack Dempsey Enterprises, a fictional promotional com­ pany run by Dempsey, who also appears as himself and aims to turn the fight into a happening on par with his Tunney bouts. “It can only be big,” Dempsey explains to the boxers as they sign the contract, “when you convince Old Man Public y­ ou’re giving him a real fight.” As Ryan gambled, Morgan arrives at the championship match out of shape and without the Professor’s expert guiding hand. Carnera dominates the early rounds and seems headed for a decisive victory. But Belle can no longer stand to see Morgan get punished and convinces the Professor to rejoin his corner. The trainer swallows his pride and coaches the fighter to an unlikely draw. Although Ryan initially rebukes Belle for helping Morgan, he eventually gives her his blessing to get back together with the humbled boxer. The Prizefighter and the Lady was released while Carnera was heavyweight champ and benefitted from the celebrity’s inclusion. The film again spiked in popularity a­ fter Baer beat Carnera for the title in 1934—­a victory that Baer claimed was aided by his experience sparring with Carnera during the film’s production.63 Prizefighter and the Lady demonstrates the overlapping media that fused to build Morgan’s celebrity and generate interest in his eventual championship tilt. Morgan, for instance, uses talking with sportswriters—­a professional necessity given the publicity their coverage offers—as an excuse to get out of the ­house so he can carouse. “Got a lot of sportswriters ­here and t­ hey’re figuring ways to plug me as a contender. You know, same old stuff,” he tells the suspicious Belle. The exposure drives radio broadcasts of his fights, the vaudev­ille show, and the extra editions that newsies hawk outside of the title fight at Madison Square Garden. Prior to the championship, the film pre­sents a montage of photog­ raphers snapping pictures, printing presses shooting out papers, radio microphones capturing sound, and newsreel cameras recording the scene. Like e­ arlier boxing film depictions of newspapers and radio, the montage highlights the spectacle surrounding Morgan and Carnera’s fight. But this scene blends ­these\n\nThe Boxing Film through the Golden Age • 31\n\nmedia and suggests they cannot be unwoven within the multifaceted sports media landscape in which the Morgan-­Carnera match is taking place. It also reinforces Dempsey’s role in helping to catalyze this convergent media environment by including him as the promotional engine ­behind this multiplatform spectacle. Aside from depicting the intermingling media that transform prizefights into nationally experienced spectacles, Prizefighter and the Lady began adopting their narrative practices—­a convention other Hollywood boxing movies employed to approximate how fans consumed fights. The film pre­sents Morgan and Carnera’s fight from the perspective of a radio broadcast that sets the scene by remarking on the presence of celebrities and other media at the fight. The broadcaster (Dan Tobey) mentions that Al Jolson, Anne Morgan, and Grantland Rice are at the match (though they do not have cameos), and the film cuts to journalists and photog­raphers covering the bout. The narrative technique reinforces radio’s position as the dominant way fans experienced prizefights at the time and uses the medium’s conventions to build realism that complements the film’s inclusion of venues like Madison Square Garden and boxers such as Baer, Carnera, and Dempsey. Moreover, the visual accompaniment the film provides to its pre­sen­ta­tion of a live radio broadcast offers a precursor to tele­vi­sion coverage a de­cade before the medium took hold. Prizefighter and the Lady demonstrates how the boxing film institutionalizes, makes sense of, and even anticipates the multimedia culture surrounding boxing. Prizefighter and the Lady also comments on and enacts how commercial media shape boxing’s history and cultural politics. Prior to discovering Morgan, the Professor drunkenly waxes nostalgic about boxing’s good old days. “­There are no more prizefighters,” he resignedly slurs. “The pre­sent generation of fighters are nothing more or less than an army of Adagio dancers. Where are the S­ ullivans? The Fitzsimmonses? The Ketchels?” He sees Morgan as a revival of this heroic tradition of old-­school brawlers. The Morgan-­Carnera title match supports this attitude by trotting out a collection of retired fighters prior to the fight—­a common practice at big bouts. The ceremony showcases lightweight Joe Rivers, welterweight Jackie Fields, middleweight Billy Papke, the wrestler Strangler Lewis, and the heavyweights Jess Willard, Frank Moran, and Jim Jeffries—­all of whom appear as themselves. The special guests enter the ring to rapturous applause, cameras flashing, and ringside typewriters feverishly chronicling their cameos. The ceremony accents the Morgan-­Carnera fight’s import as a continuation of the glorious heritage the retired fighters exemplify. It also reinforces the entirely White boxing history about which the Professor reminisces during the film’s opening minutes. Jack Johnson was alive—­and still occasionally boxing—­when Prizefighter and the Lady was produced. The film, however, erases the rebellious Black fighter from the sporting tradition it commemorates and continues.\n\n32 • The Boxing Film\n\nPrizefighter and the Lady demonstrates how the proliferation of commercial media ensured boxing’s salability by Whitening the sport. It attributes ­these racial politics in part to Dempsey by casting the namesake of Dempseymania—­ and the biggest star in boxing’s media-­driven explosion through the 1920s—as the force b­ ehind the championship bout’s promotion. Films like Prizefighter and the Lady chronicle the cultural attitudes accompanying boxing and media’s commercially driven synergy and informing the shape both the sport and repre­ sen­ta­tions of it took during the Golden Age of Sports Media. ­These depictions, however, began to shift along with the rise of f­uture heavyweight champion Joe Louis, who began his professional ­career one year ­a fter Prizefighter and the Lady’s release.\n\n2\n\nSt. Joe Louis, Surrounded by Films\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.’s classic civil rights treatise Why We ­Can’t Wait (1964) includes a story about a young Black convict in the 1930s American South awaiting execution in the gas chamber, at the time a newfangled technique that was erroneously considered more “humane” than hanging or the electric chair. Prison officials placed an audio recorder in the chamber to offer researchers some ghastly indication of how a person might respond when faced with such singularly terrifying circumstances. When the executioner released the toxic gas, the condemned man did not plead for mercy, issue a confession, or even sneak in a quick Hail Mary. Instead, he bellowed “Save me, Joe Louis! Save me, Joe Louis!” in desperate hope that the heavyweight champion—­the second African American title holder a­ fter Jack Johnson—­might miraculously deliver some form of salvation. “The condemned young Negro, groping for someone who might care for him, and had power enough to rescue him, found only the heavyweight boxing champion of the world,” King wrote. “Joe Louis would care ­because he was a Negro. Joe Louis could do something b­ ecause he was a fighter. In a few words the d­ ying man had written a social commentary. Not God, not government, not charitably-­minded white men, but a Negro who was the world’s most expert fighter, in this last extremity, was the last hope.”1 Although prob­ably apocryphal, the folk tale speaks to Joe Louis’s mythic significance in Black culture. Louis was heroic enough to make plausible a scenario in which a young man faced with execution might call on the boxer to swoop in and save the day. 33\n\n34 • The Boxing Film\n\nDespite his exalted status, Louis died nearly penniless a­ fter being bilked by his management, haunted by a series of poor investments, and hounded by the IRS for back taxes. The country Louis inspired and the associates he made wealthy virtually abandoned the champion once he exhausted his usefulness. Neo-­impressionist artist Jean-­Michel Basquiat commented on the fighter’s dual role as hero and victim with St. Joe Louis, Surrounded by Snakes (1982). The spare and colorful painting, produced one year ­after the ­boxer’s death, shows Louis seated on a stool in the corner of a ring with a halo floating above his head—­a gesture ­toward his righ­teousness. Louis is wreathed by a collection of monstrous con­sul­tants who at once seem to be watching out for him and conspiring ­behind his back. Basquiat’s Louis—­who stoically gazes ahead while fractured by the errant lines and drips characteristic of the artist’s style—­embodies at once the possibilities of American democracy and the perils of institutionalized injustice. Boxing, and the heavyweight division specifically, lagged ­after Jack Dempsey’s retirement. Sammons calls the early 1930s a “pugilistic depression” that matched the larger economic hard times. Louis’s ascendance rejuvenated the sport. His vitalizing impact extended into boxing films, which had similarly wilted ­after Dempsey hung up his gloves.2 Films of Louis’s victories ­were popu­lar—if often illegal—­attractions among African American audiences, and the boxer both appeared in and inspired vari­ous in­de­pen­dent race films made for exhibition in segregated Black theaters. Beyond ­these niche productions, Louis’s popularity precipitated Hollywood’s most robust period of boxing films. Although they capitalized on Louis’s renown, the mainstream productions did not feature a Black protagonist ­until The Joe Louis Story in 1953—­a film released ­after Louis retired and the heavyweight title was back in White hands. Reflecting the simultaneous exaltation and exploitation that Basquiat’s painting addresses, Louis was surrounded by boxing films that profited from the popularity he triggered but avoided depicting worlds that centered on Black fighters or exploring the distinct challenges they faced in and out of the sport. ­These dif­fer­ent productions showcase the conditions u­ nder which separate alcoves of film culture would celebrate Louis as well as the lengths to which Hollywood went to suppress the Black agency he represented from the boxing movies he helped to make ­viable.\n\nBlack Moses and Brown Bomber Louis’s trajectory exemplifies the American Dream narrative so central to boxing films—­particularly t­ hose produced during the G ­ reat Depression era when he began his professional ­career. He was born Joe Louis Barrow in 1914 to a LaFayette, Alabama, ­family of sharecroppers. In 1926 the Barrows moved to Detroit in search of the factory work that drew many southern African\n\nSt. Joe Louis, Surrounded by Films • 35\n\nAmericans to the industrializing North and Midwest. As the story goes, Joe’s ­mother Lillie was giving her teenage son money to take violin lessons. Barrow’s friends teased him about his delicate extracurricular activity—­one he had ­little aptitude for and only moderate interest in. As a result, Barrow began secretly using the money for his violin classes to rent a locker and learn the appreciably tougher trade of boxing at the Brewster Recreation Center. Lillie soon discovered his truancy and forgave her son on the condition that he give his preferred activity his best effort. Barrow had a knack for fighting that immediately outshone what­ever tunes he managed to wring out of his fiddle. He also saw the sport as a way to make money, something that had always been in short supply. The fledgling pugilist began fighting ­under the truncated name of Joe Louis with the guidance of an all-­Black group of mentors that included comanagers Julian Black and John Roxborough and trainer Jack Blackburn, who s­ haped him into a pro by the time he turned twenty. As it became apparent that Louis had the potential to compete on a national level—­and perhaps someday contend for the heavyweight title—­his management developed a plan to help their fighter navigate and mitigate the racist judgment he would inevitably encounter.
