You’re looking for a friend called ‘Pierre Martin’? Hard cheese, he’s going to be tough to find. Don’t even try to type ‘Rossi’ in an Italian search engine! You’ll start swearing before you reach page 10… Meanwhile, in Germany, ‘Müller’ is so frequent that you may end up… in a supermarket! Family names are at the heart of the history of each nation: a prime illustration of the social contract which binds people together in a society. So when we look carefully at the most common surnames in Europe, we are looking into the very heart of European identity, so close you can touch it. Did you know, for instance, that the most frequent family name in Europe as a whole is the Spanish surname ‘Garcia’? Have you noticed that Polish, Czech and Slovenes share the same most commun surname ‘Novak’ – which means simply ‘new man’. Also, ever wondered why the most common surnames in some Balkan countries actually designate the neighbour’s nationality? Wonder no more: let’s take our tour around the most frequent family names in Europe."
