Then you should take a Hollywood studio tour. At Paramount, located at 5555 Melrose Avenue in Hollywood, you get a two-hour walk-through confined mostly to the exterior of various soundstages, as well as a stop at Lucy Park, a small section of the studio lot that at one time belonged to Desilu Studios, which in turn bought out most of the old RKO Radio Studio facilities. You’ll probably also see some Foley artists plodding through reels of sound effects for forthcoming films and television shows; the famous “Blue Sky” cyclorama, which has been used as a backdrop for Leonard Nimoy’s Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) and Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments (1956); the basement apartment shared by the lead characters of television’s Laverne and Shirley (1976–1983); and some exterior locations used in the series Seinfeld (1989–1998). But the back lot itself is almost entirely gone; it’s nothing like Warner Bros. or Universal, where faux New York City streets, European villages, and dusty western cow towns still exist side by side, ready for instantaneous use. Sony Pictures, at 10202 West Washington Boulevard, the home of MGM for nearly a century, also offers a walking tour; here, too, as on the Paramount tour, ghosts predominate. The major phantom, of course, is MGM itself; while Sony may now own the studio facilities, it was MGM’s home base from the studio’s inception until 1990, and yet most of the 1\n\n2\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\ncontemporary tour focuses on Columbia’s history. Columbia, originally located at 1438 North Gower Street, was one of the most down-at-theheels studios in Hollywood until Harry Cohn’s ruthlessly astute management propelled it into the majors with Frank Capra’s It Happened One Night (1934). The film was originally designed as a “punishment picture” for Clark Gable, on loan from MGM in order to force him to accept studio dictates. Instead, the tactic backfired, Gable became a major star, and he returned to MGM in glory rather than as a chastened prodigal son. But since the former MGM is now the home of Sony/Columbia/ TriStar, you’ll get a glimpse of the Thalberg Building, named after the “boy wonder” who ran MGM in the early 1930s and married star Norma Shearer. His reign ended with his untimely death at age thirty-seven in 1936, somewhat to studio head Louis B. Mayer’s unspoken satisfaction, given that Thalberg was becoming too powerful and gradually eclipsing the patriarchal mogul. So you’ll get a bit of MGM history, but not too much. The past is the past, and MGM moved out long ago—well, twelve years ago at this writing—and with all eyes fixed firmly on the present, who has time for history? Universal Studios, on the other hand, at 100 Universal City Plaza, is a mini-empire unto itself, with its own post office and zip code. It functions not only as a working film studio but also as a “destination” amusement park. Along with Warner Bros., it is one of the two surviving studios to boast an extensive back lot, with standing sets going all the way back to the early 1930s. When I first visited Universal in 1960, the studio had long given up the idea of studio tours and wouldn’t catch on to the idea of reviving them for additional profit, much less adding an amusement park to its facilities, for several more years. Instead, the Universal back lot tour was part of a Grey Line bus tour that roamed over all of Hollywood, spending the early afternoon at Universal, where we got to see a section of a TV western being shot. The whole visit was low key, no pressure, and we were one of only two or three tour groups that day, comprising about sixty visitors in all.\n\nprologue\n\n3\n\nSo, to a degree, we were a novelty to the crew, a moment’s distraction from a hard day’s work. Dismounting from the bus, we were allowed to wander around the various exterior sets at will, snapping pictures, exchanging anecdotes, while the bus driver offered us an abbreviated history of Universal’s output. Although we were no doubt a nuisance, the crews and stars we met tolerated us with a friendly diffidence, and I got to chat with an old grip who had been working there since the 1940s. Then, in a relaxed fashion, we got back on the tour bus, waved goodbye, and set off to see the Hollywood Bowl. It was, of course, too good to last. By 1965, Universal had started running trams through the back lot in a rigidly organized forty-five-minute tour jammed with passengers, with almost no stops to explore the back lot. Today the trams also feature small video screens, as on airplanes, running a sanitized history of the studio with Ron Howard as a sort of host for a mélange of clips highlighting Universal’s past. There’s also, of course, plenty of time to purchase souvenirs in the gift shop. The tour isn’t cheap; it costs $69 per person and doesn’t include a lot of frills found on the $239 “VIP Tour,” which, as described by online travel writer Gary Wayne, gives the visitor a more “immersive” studio experience, including a behind-the-scenes guided tour with access to previously “off-limits” areas of the studio. The tours are limited to no more than 15 people at a time (aboard private trolleys and on foot), and include such extra perks as a continental breakfast at their VIP Lounge and tours of the studio’s production areas. VIP guests get to visit sound stage sets from current TV productions such as Desperate Housewives [2004–2011], where Leave It to Beaver [1957–1963] was shot a half-century ago, as well as the studio’s huge prop department, the sound department, a house built especially to accommodate cameras for interior shots, etc. The six-hour tour gives guests the chance to see how sets are built, how lighting is designed, how sound is added after filming, etc. Perhaps best of all, unlike the standard Universal tour, where guests are stuck on the giant\n\n4\n\ndeath of the moguls tram for the whole tour, the VIP tour allows guests to get off their small trolley and walk among the sets, such as War of the Worlds [2005] and Psycho [1960], and along the streets where movies such as Back to the Future [1985], Spartacus [1960], and Frankenstein [1931] were filmed. . . . Back in the theme park area, the VIP tour also gives you escorted front of the line privileges, that lets you go straight to the head of the line for all of the park’s rides (such as Jurassic Park [based on the 1993 film] and the Mummy roller coaster [based on the 1999 film]), and gives you reserved seating at all the shows such as Waterworld [based on the 1995 film] and Terminator 2: 3-D ([based on the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day] including behind-stage meet & greet with the shows’ performers). You also get unlimited food service at the park’s cafes. They even let you see an Oscar statuette up-close.\n\nThe real money spinner is Universal’s City Walk, a tacky hodgepodge of restaurants and souvenir shops to which one is afforded “free” admission (aside from valet parking), where overpriced memorabilia and greasy fast food combine to create an ersatz Coney Island atmosphere without the charm. You’ll look in vain for a bookstore or DVD shop on the City Walk; that’s just outdated technology, and all that matters here is the present and whatever cash one can wring out of it. There is, however, a comic book store, where one can buy graphic novels of soon-to-be Universal franchise releases, and a clothing store featuring a Universal logo windbreaker for $59.95 that can’t be washed by hand or machine or even dry cleaned; the only thing one can do is “sponge dry” it from time to time, and then very carefully. It’s all appearance; utility is secondary. But the Psycho house is still standing; you can always check that out for a photo op and get your picture taken where Tony Perkins once acted out a homicidal fantasy. At Warner Bros., they also have a VIP tour, which takes two hours and covers much of the studio grounds, but again, if you’d like a more detailed look at the facilities, the $249 Deluxe Tour is indicated. During six hours\n\nprologue\n\n5\n\nof “insider” reconnaissance you actually get to pose with a real Academy Award in your hand (after donning protective white gloves), eat lunch in the Warner Bros. executive dining room, and visit the sets of the various sitcoms that now occupy the vast majority of the soundstages. They still have the set for the coffee shop in the television series Friends (1994–2004) in mothballs, and you can take turns posing with your significant other on the large sofa that dominates the cramped soundstage. While the soundstages all carry plaques proudly listing the many classic films shot there, the tour guides are much more interested in telling you about Chuck Lorre’s new sitcom Mike and Molly (2010–present) and taking you for a tour of the standing set; you also get to see the rather rundown production offices of the various independent production companies headquartered on the lot (such as Clint Eastwood’s Malpaso Productions); the block of offices is often used as an exterior set for a scene requiring a rundown hotel. While references abound in the tour guide’s patter to Bogart, Davis, and other luminaries of Warners’ golden age, you’ll see almost nothing of them in terms of memorabilia, and the studio museum (the last stop on the tour) is almost exclusively devoted (two whole floors worth) to Harry Potter costumes, props, and scripts. If you look hard enough, you can find a few remnants of the past that still exist; the corner wall where James Cagney was nearly shot down (by real bullets) in William Wellman’s The Public Enemy (1931) still stands, as well as the studio’s New York street, constructed in 1930. The bulk of back lot production today is confined to television shows and commercials; on the day I visited Warner Bros. in the summer of 2011, an Old Navy ad was being shot on one of the ersatz city streets, which rent (apart from camera equipment, lights, actors, and technicians) for $10,000 a day. The overwhelming impression I came away with was a sense of willfully manufactured nostalgia; this was a facility that belonged to the past, trying to eke out a living in the digital twenty-first century, where physical props and locations have been replaced by green screen/CGI technology. Despite all the visitors tromping through, one got the distinct feeling that\n\n6\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nboth Universal and Warners were hanging on to their respective facilities by the skin of their collective teeth, although in Universal’s case the move toward a Disneyfied theme park approach seems to have been paying off handsomely. The days when either of these studios boasted a roster of actors, writers, and directors ready at a moment’s notice to undertake a production are long gone; now, “packages,” put together by agents, stars, producers, and/or directors, or their representatives, constitute the main source of theatrical films. The studios are merely production facilities for hire, in addition to offering financing, distribution, and back lot facilities to those who still wish to work within the studio system. There are other studio locations one can visit; Melody Ranch, for example, in Newhall, California, where most of Gene Autry’s singing westerns were shot, along with scenes from John Ford’s Stagecoach (1939) and Fred Zinnemann’s High Noon (1952), still exists, as it has since 1915, and is now open to the public; Monogram Studios, one of the industry’s smallest operations in the 1940s, often shot western programmers here as well. As with the other studios, some contemporary productions still use Melody Ranch for filming. But the giant Hollywood studios today are primarily a repository of merchandisable memories, where an image of the “glamorous past” can be conjured up at a moment’s notice (“Imagine Humphrey Bogart walking up and down this studio street between takes of Casablanca [1942],” our Warner Bros. tour guide encouraged us, or “Here’s where the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz [1939] used to be” at MGM, only it’s not there anymore either), to no real effect. The past is still dead. The reminiscences are for the most part forced, synthetic, and largely prepackaged; at Warners, the most revealing exhibits I found were tucked away in the studio museum’s back corner (“photography strictly prohibited”), our last stop on the tour, particularly some rather blunt memos documenting Jack Warner’s displeasure with Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde (1967) in no uncertain terms, addressed to the film’s star, Warren Beatty. “Who wants to see the rise and fall of a couple of rats?” Warner\n\nprologue\n\n7\n\nqueried in one note, apparently forgetting that The Public Enemy and Mervyn LeRoy’s Little Caesar (1931) helped to put the studio on the map with just such a formula. Also intriguing was a memo regarding editor Dede Allen’s participation in the project. Beatty insisted on using her, but at $650 a week she was seen as too expensive—certainly a reliable studio cutter could handle the project. Of course, Beatty prevailed over Warner on that decision, but with Bonnie and Clyde, as well as Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960), Mike Nichols’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), and other productions of that era, one could see the hold of the old moguls on the filmmaking process slipping. I mentioned this to our tour guide, who smiled and used the opportunity to launch into yet another oft-repeated piece of studio lore. Jack Warner, it seems, used to “settle” arguments by pointing to the huge water tower that still dominates the studio lot, emblazoned with the WB logo, and demanding, “What do you think that stands for?” But when he tried this tactic on the star of Bonnie and Clyde, all he got was the laconic response “Warren Beatty.” No love was lost between these two men; in an earlier era, Jack Warner would have simply fired him, or put him on unpaid suspension for an indefinite period. Now, that power was gone. Warner needed Beatty, and both Beatty and Warner knew it. The age of the great studio bosses was a thing of the past. That said, there is a great deal of legitimate disputation as to exactly when the studio era ended; some say the 1970s, when the conglomerates began to take hold; some say the 1950s, when television first began to transform the studio landscape. But I would argue that what prefigured the end of the classical studio era was the death of the men—and they were all men—who ran the various production companies. All but Darryl F. Zanuck were Jewish, and they rose, for the most part, from very humble origins. The uncouth Harry Cohn, better known as “White Fang” or “King Cohn” at Columbia; Louis B. Mayer, purveyor of small-town pieties at MGM; Darryl F. Zanuck, absolute ruler of 20th Century Fox; David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures, or SIP; Jack Warner,\n\n8\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nruthless overlord of the studio that bore his name; “Uncle” Carl Laemmle at Universal; Adolph Zukor at Paramount. RKO Radio, as we will see, is a special case and never really had one boss. The studio went through quite a number of regime shifts; perhaps this is one of the reasons the studio ceased production in 1957, leaving only a holding company behind. These larger-than-life figures—the movie moguls—dominated the cinematic marketplace in the 1930s through the 1950s and early 1960s, and in their story one can find the rise and fall of a series of dynasties, based on fear, artifice, marketing, and absolute ruthlessness. More than that, what united these men was a feeling of absolute immortality; none of them could conceive of a world without them in it, and none of them really cared, I think, what would happen after they were gone. Deep down, of course, they were acutely aware of their mortality; like the pharaohs, fear of death was one of the reasons the moguls were so determined to leave something tangible behind as evidence of their existence. Their respective studios were monuments to their industry and stamina; when they died, the company would die with them—or at least it wouldn’t be the same company. Warner Bros. without Jack Warner? In name only. Columbia without Harry Cohn? Just a corporate holdover. What would 20th Century Fox be without Darryl F. Zanuck? A business for lawyers and pencil pushers. Without the moguls, the real essence of their studios would die. Some, like Adolph Zukor, spoke of company loyalty, but in the last analysis, none could really imagine a world in which they didn’t play an important part. Their ends were varied: some sold out and had a few years of retirement; others died in harness; some were fired by their former protégés or squeezed out by the financial arms of their companies. But in all cases, their rule, during the classical studio era, was absolute and utterly dictatorial; these men controlled their empire with ruthlessness, cunning, and determination. It is their story that I tell in this volume. It is the story of Hollywood’s golden era, the story of a world that existed only so long as the need for its services and physical production facilities existed; and when it collapsed it left but a corporate shell behind.\n\nprologue\n\n9\n\nI start off with a brief chapter that introduces the studios and the moguls just before the collapse. Then I discuss how the studio bosses dealt with their fading empire in the era of television and the end of the conventional studio assembly line, in which producers had rosters of directors, writers, actors, and others under their command and could put together films quickly and cheaply. The demise of the assembly line led to the shift to today’s reliance on “packaged” feature films. As Ethan Mordden succinctly put it, By about 1965, the studio system . . . was history. Aside from the major economic and social factors, a crisis of leadership had developed. The generation that succeeded the Golden Age moguls lacked the experience and instincts that guided the lots in the good old days. Not only was there no new Thalberg, no Zanuck, no Selznick, there was scarcely even a new Carl Laemmle. Once, a studio was a place governed by a budget set by a mogul who believed he could market certain kinds of stars who were presented by a staff of experts who held certain social, artistic, and political aperçus in common. As Adolph Zukor, the founder of [Paramount] looked on, the studio[s] dwindled into . . . firm[s] governed by various crass jerks who [held] nothing in common but a contempt for everything but money. (370)\n\n“Crass jerks” may be putting it rather bluntly, but it’s obvious that in Hollywood today, only the bottom line rules. Of course, one could just as easily argue that it was ever so. And yet, before movies were made by committees and cost so much that a single high-profile flop could bankrupt a studio (as happened with Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate [1980], which sent United Artists into a financial tailspin), the average “A” feature film, as late as the 1970s, cost about $1–7 million to make, and about as much more for prints and advertising. Thus, one could afford to take chances, to produce an occasional loss leader, as Irving Thalberg urged during his meteoric tenure at MGM, simply to enhance the studio’s image. Then, too, without the splintering of the marketplace effected by streaming\n\n10\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nvideo, video on demand, DVDs, cell phone videos, and other distribution methods (especially Netflix, Amazon, and the ubiquitous Red Box DVD machines that dispense “top 40” hits at your local mall), each film produced had only one primary marketplace: theatrical distribution. Every film had to play in a theater to make its money back. Thus, there was a certain egalitarianism inherent in classical studio era film production; the lowest “B” could theoretically compete with the most prestigious “A” film for the public’s affections and dollars, and, provided that the smaller film was sold by the studio on a percentage basis rather than a flat rental fee, even a modest film could potentially become an unexpected hit if properly marketed. But now, only the big-budget films make it into the multiplexes; the rest open only in “selected cities” (New York, Los Angeles, and a few other large metropolitan markets), or wind up going straight to DVD or streaming video. Without a theatrical release, for all intents and purposes movies become invisible to the general public; only genre fans and film buffs will seek these smaller films out and take the time to see them. So where once smaller films occupied the numerous soundstages at the majors and minors in Hollywood, now sitcoms that cost $2–3 million an episode and hour-long dramas that cost much more predominate. The plaques on the studio walls commemorating past glories are thus ironic reminders of an era in which, despite almost tyrannical control from the top down, many of the greatest films were produced by cadres of dedicated men and women who labored in the dream factories for minimal pay, and even less glory. It was a tough system, but in the end individual decisions, bolstered by audience research and test marketing, along with a desire to make films of lasting value, drove the rulers of the studios to create films that both entertained and enlightened. As this book opens, however, that era is coming to an end. This is the story of the decline, fall, and ultimate collapse of the studio system, a systemic failure so catastrophic that in the end only fragments of the majors were left, to be shuffled from one conglomerate to another. Their vast libraries of films were cast off in one direction while\n\nprologue\n\n11\n\ntheir facilities were pressed into service for new owners. This was the case with MGM; Ted Turner bought the MGM film library for television use and then sold off the studio itself through a series of complex negotiations (see Dixon and Foster 378–79), so that all that’s left of the former MGM Studios are some repurposed buildings and a few tattered mementos. When the moguls of the old Hollywood studio system died, in the 1950s and 1960s, no one came along to take their place, because their kingdom itself had vanished.\n\nchapter 1\n\nw The Postwar Collapse\n\nIn 1946, the movies—as an industry—had their biggest year, reflecting Americans’ desire for escapism from the events just concluded. The war had been a long one, truly global and on a scale hitherto unimaginable, with more than sixty million deaths. The development of the atomic bomb and its use on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had brought the war to a brutal end the year before; now, for the first time in history, humankind could destroy an entire city with the push of a button. With the end of the war in Europe came revelations of the German concentration camps, leading to the Nuremburg tribunals. Our former ally, the Soviet Union, was in the midst of enslaving Eastern Europe; no one, it seemed, could be trusted. During the war, a nonstop succession of flag-waving war films and escapist musicals and comedies had kept the public entertained during the long, wearying hours of the day. Now, everyone wanted to forget the war and get on with their lives. Women, newly accustomed to being part of the workforce in defense plants and disinclined to return to kitchen duty, rebelled against a resumption of prewar patriarchal values. Men, confused by this new threat to their familial dominion, sought escape at the movies, in pool halls, in sports venues, and in VFW lodges as divorce rates reached record levels. The old order had been turned upside down, and things would never be the same in the little white house with the picket fence. As a 12\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n13\n\nfemale factory worker in one World War II poster had declared, “Now I can buy the things I love,” brandishing a paycheck to prove her point. The tagline underscores this new order of things, as if to bluntly state, “Here’s my passport to independence.” Indeed: Why should women give this up just because their husbands had returned? Who needed husbands, anyway, or kids, or the home with the gingham curtains and the pictureperfect backyard? “Independence” was the new slogan, and it seemed there was no going back. Returning veterans were blindsided by these changes. During the war, pin-up images of stars like Betty Grable had circulated on the battlefront as totemic objects of desire—“What we’re fighting for”—alternating with pictures of faithful wives and children waiting at home: the classic “madonna/whore” paradigm. Sex, lust, and domesticity collided in these images, designed to both reassure and excite soldiers at the front. But as one woman noted, “When my husband finally came home we discovered we were two different people, so much had happened in those years apart. . . . After a while we settled to some sort of married life, but there were times I thought that if there was a hell on earth, I was living it” (qtd. in Costello 262–63). Thus, audiences for movies had changed, the family structure had changed, and nothing was as it seemed. Film noir rose in popularity as a genre, reflecting the uncertainties of the era. The old Universal horror films no longer struck terror into the hearts of audiences; now, the fear was all around us. The atomic bomb, a surprise development at the end of the war, made life seem even more transient and quixotic; if a city could nearly be wiped off the map with a single bomb, how could anything be certain? The Andy Hardy films churned out by MGM seemed utterly out of place, almost ridiculously so; how could anyone believe in the small-town verities of the mythical city of Carvel when society itself was in such flux? Just as men didn’t foresee the shifts in social norms, so, too, the movie moguls didn’t anticipate the rise of the unions within the studio\n\n14\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nsystem, a development they did everything they could to stop. The issue went back to labor disputes at the Disney studio in 1941. Walt Disney himself was bitterly opposed to unionization of his studio, portraying himself as a sort of benevolent father figure who was perfectly capable of equitably running the Disney lot without outside interference. The Cartoonists Guild, however, spearheaded by Disney animator Art Babbitt, brought about an end to Disney’s unquestioned domain. Herb Sorrell had been attempting to organize the studio’s animators since the late 1930s, and in January 1941 he met with Roy and Walt Disney to demand the unionization of Disney’s animators, most of whom had signed a card requesting Guild representation for their services (Eliot 138). Animators were furious at the low pay and uncertain working conditions at the studio, as union representative George Bodle quickly found out: “There was just no negotiating with them. I had to deal mostly with Roy, because Walt simply refused to see me, who just told me what they [the studio] wanted, and that was it. . . . [Inkers and painters] were making $18.50 a week [and could] get fired at Walt’s discretion, without reason or explanation” (Eliot 140). During the week of May 17, 1941, the National Labor Relations Board shot down the legality of Disney’s proposed “in house union,” the Animator’s Federation, but Disney responded by simply renaming the federation the American Society of Screen Cartoonists, which was also eventually ruled illegal (Eliot 140). Disney remained opposed to any real attempt at unionizing—just as Walmart, now America’s largest single employer, does today—and fired Art Babbitt and several others who pressed for Guild recognition. Events then moved rapidly. On May 27, Richard Storey, a representative of Kidder, Peabody—underwriters of the Disney company’s public stock offering—and Joseph Rosenberg of the Bank of America, one of the studio’s main supply lines of production capital, met with Disney in an all-night, all-out effort to avoid a strike and recognize the Guild, but even these even-handed, pragmatic individuals could not sway Disney from his course.\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n15\n\nThe next day, May 28, 1941, Sorrell called the studio workers out on strike, an action that Disney predicted would soon backfire (Eliot 141–42). But it didn’t. The strikers’ resolve only strengthened in the coming days and weeks, despite a plethora of diversionary and divisive tactics from Disney. On July 2, Walt Disney took out a full-page ad in Variety offering his version of a settlement, but it was too little, too late. Public sentiment was moving, amazingly, against Disney, and by mid-July even the mainstream Technicolor Corporation sided with the strikers, refusing to process any film from the studio until the Guild was legitimized (Eliot 147). Disney remained intransigent. Seeing the writing on the wall, however, his more practical brother Roy arranged for Walt to travel to South America as an “ambassador of good will” for the United States so that Roy and studio negotiator Gunther Lessing could hammer out an agreement with the Guild. Private, public, and business sentiment was now firmly with the strikers, and even that bastion of capitalism, Nelson Rockefeller, took a stand, advising Roy Disney by phone that capitulation was inevitable; on September 9, 1941, Roy reluctantly agreed to binding arbitration, to recognize the Cartoonists Guild, to rehire all employees fired because of union work, to offer better pay, severance guarantees, paid vacations, and a “closed shop,” and to prevent freelancers from poaching studio jobs (Eliot 150). Walt Disney, predictably, was furious, and wrote an open letter that he paid to be published in numerous newspapers, stating, among other things, that “to me, the entire [strike] situation is a catastrophe. . . . I am convinced that this entire mess was Communistically inspired and led. . . . I am thoroughly disgusted and would gladly quit and establish myself in another business. . . . I have a case of the D.D.s—disillusionment and discouragement” (Eliot 151). The episode served as a wakeup call to the industry as a whole, on both sides of the fence. Studio bosses saw their power, hitherto unquestioned, now in jeopardy; studio workers saw that they would have to fight for whatever rights they felt they deserved, and that management would use all possible means—up to and including strong-arm tactics—to prevent\n\n16\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nall-out unionization from happening. All this happened before December 7, 1941, and the United States’ entry into World War II, meaning that management/worker hostilities were temporarily put aside for the duration of the war. During the war, a “no strike” pledge was in effect at the studios, ensuring an all-out effort to achieve victory, but in 1944 the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals sprang up, an ultra-right organization dedicated to stamping out leftist influence within the studio system (Davis 343). When Franklin Delano Roosevelt died in April 1945, the right and left began to battle each other hammer and tongs for control of the system. Labor organizer Herb Sorrell coordinated a strike of the members of Hollywood’s craft unions, starting with Warner Bros. on October 5, 1949, which led to violence on the picket line from both sheriff’s deputies and the strikers themselves. Actor Rosemary De Camp was working at Warner Bros. during the strike and later recalled that “you went in with an armed guard in the car in the morning, about six o’clock. It was rather grim to look out and see those guys [the LAPD strike squad] with rifles” (Davis 343). The Warner Bros. studio was an excellent target for Sorrell’s efforts, as both Harry and Jack Warner saw the coming of the unions—or any threat to their complete dominion of the lot—as absolutely intolerable. Pickets were also seen at MGM, and at RKO Radio the studio employees simply stayed inside the lot rather than coping with getting in and out of the grounds each day. As a whole, the studios decided they would have to break the unions no matter what and dug in their heels for a protracted fight (Davis 344). Labor issues were now merging with Cold War politics. On October 20, 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) opened the first public hearing into supposed communist influence or infiltration in the motion picture industry. The first “friendly witnesses” included Walt Disney, Jack Warner, actors Robert Taylor, Gary Cooper, and Adolphe Menjou, director Leo McCarey (who would go on to direct the hysterical anticommunist screed My Son John in 1952), and writer Ayn Rand\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n17\n\n(Vaughn 76). Disney, for his part, identified Sorrell as a communist and averred that the 1941 strike was a direct result of communist infiltration into the industry: I believe it is an Un-American thing. The thing that I resent the most is that they are able to get into these unions, take them over, and represent to the world that a group of people that are in my plant, that I know are good, 100-percent Americans, are trapped by this group. . . . I feel that they really ought to be smoked out and shown up for what they are, so that all of the good, free causes in this country, all the liberalisms that really are American, can go on without the taint of Communism. (Vaughn 85)\n\nSo much for organized labor. When Disney spoke, he shaped public perceptions; after all, the Disney organization was a “family studio,” and the public and press followed his early lead. The unions were now aligned in the public mind with communism, and the social landscape had changed a great deal since 1941. By 1947, the Soviet interventions in most of Eastern Europe had made clear that Stalin was a totalitarian dictator of the first order. Then, when the Soviets got the atomic and later the hydrogen bomb, East and West became locked in a genuinely deadly power struggle with no end in sight. Movies were, of course, the most pervasive social media of the era; communications were confined to radio and television broadcasts, letters, commercial or clandestine shortwave broadcasts (which the Soviets often jammed within their sphere of influence), phonograph records, wire and tape recordings, and motion pictures. Of all these media, film was the most immersive, because it could incorporate all the other methods of disseminating information and largely used images that transported the viewer into another world. In short, film was potentially dangerous. It needed to be watched closely. Even the president was under scrutiny. As Michael Mills notes, In 1946, for the first time since the Hoover administration, the Republican Party had won control of Congress. Political events in Europe and the rest of the world bewildered most Americans. Early polls indicated\n\n18\n\ndeath of the moguls official U.S. foreign policy at odds with that of the average citizen. As a result, President Truman came to be regarded by many as being soft towards Communism, especially domestic Communism. Because of the newly empowered Republican majority and to combat these increasing uncertainties, Truman put into effect the first of many of the so-called anti-Communist loyalty acts. However, rather than shoring up a perceived weakness within his administration, these executive mandates lent credence to Truman’[s] detractors, and fueled his own self-doubts.\n\nBut even as the HUAC conducted its hearings, some in Hollywood objected to the reckless manner in which anyone could be tagged as a “pinko” by insinuation alone, creating an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust in which anyone could be denounced by anyone else for whatever reason—political persuasion (right versus left), race, creed, color, religion, or simply professional jealousy. At first it seemed that the hearings might be counteracted by those willing to speak out against the proceedings, and in Hollywood the Committee for the First Amendment (CFA) was formed. Among its principal figures were Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, William Wyler, John Huston, and Gene Kelly. As HUAC went through its list of whom to subpoena and finally came down to eleven “unfriendly” witnesses, the CFA group flew to Washington on a plane ironically lent to them by Howard Hughes, who would soon become one of the most outspoken, eccentric, and malign supporters of HUAC’s efforts. The first of the eleven was the playwright Bertolt Brecht, who, through equivocation and the translation barriers between German and English, managed to dodge the brunt of HUAC’s questions; nevertheless, Brecht left the United States the day after his appearance, leaving ten “unfriendly” witnesses who became forever known as the Hollywood Ten: screenwriter and director Herbert J. Biberman, director Edward Dmytryk, screenwriters Lester Cole, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel Ornitz, Alvah Bessie, and Dalton Trumbo, and producer Adrian Scott.\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n19\n\nIt soon became apparent to Bogart, Bacall, Huston, and the others that they were overmatched by the atmosphere of distrust and fear engendered by HUAC. The CFA quickly folded their tents, returned to Hollywood, and successfully (through the efforts of their publicists and handlers) managed to avoid being blacklisted. Still, Bogart was forced to sign a ghostwritten piece for the March 1948 issue of Photoplay magazine, “I’m No Communist,” and actors Edward G. Robinson and John Garfield soon did the same (Mills). As the hearings ground on, with the implicit support of the Truman administration, more than 300 people were barred from working in the motion picture industry, including director Joseph Losey (who fled to England, where he launched a successful career), John Garfield (who died of a heart attack at the age of thirty-nine as a result of the stress of the ordeal), and Larry Parks, who had just begun his career as an actor, rising to stardom impersonating entertainer Al Jolson in two tepid biopics for Columbia. The Hollywood Ten went to jail for contempt of Congress. But Edward Dmytryk found that he couldn’t face prison life and appeared again before the HUAC committee, this time naming names. Almost immediately, Dmytryk was allowed to return to the director’s chair with one of his most vicious films, The Sniper (1952), with HUAC supporter Adolphe Menjou as its nominal star—perhaps to keep an eye on Dmytryk. The hysteria surrounding the HUAC hearings led to the Blacklist, an organized effort by the Hollywood studios to bar those suspected of communist sympathies from employment within the industry. Effectively, once you were on the Blacklist—since all the studios cooperated with each other—you couldn’t work at any studio at all. The industry was cut into two warring factions, with a large group of quivering, uncertain, apolitical workers in the middle buffeted by both sides until the Blacklist finally eroded in the early 1960s, bit by agonizing bit. The impact on personal lives and public careers was incalculable, with the climate of fear destroying any faith that employees had in the system. Thus the anticommunist, right-wing purge of the late 1940s and early 1950s, in reality an attack on organized labor and the politics\n\n20\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nof the left, dealt a blow to the studio system in a curiously circuitous fashion by making employees realize it was time to become free agents rather than deal with capricious, dictatorial, and ultimately cowardly overlords who would capitulate to political pressure. So long as the moguls themselves remained above the political fray, all was well, at least as far as they themselves were concerned. But the cracks were beginning to show. A number of important legal decisions also hastened the demise of the studio system. In 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down what became known as the de Havilland decision, ruling that the standard seven-year contract then given to most actors could not be indefinitely lengthened by suspensions caused when an actor balked at appearing in a particular project. Olivia de Havilland, best remembered for playing the sweet and gentle Melanie in Victor Fleming’s Gone with the Wind (1939), brought the suit against Warner Bros. Bette Davis had tried the same tactic in the early 1930s to no avail. Now, under the de Havilland decision, actors would know exactly when their contract was up, and key players within the industry, no longer indentured servants to their home studios, began to look around for better scripts, directors, and projects. Thus in 1947 Humphrey Bogart left Warner Bros., his cinematic home of more than twenty years, to found his own independent production company, Santana, which released its films through Columbia Pictures. Maverick independent director Ida Lupino struck out on her own after a long career as an actor at Warners and launched the Filmakers, making films about social issues no other studio would touch. James Stewart, a conservative who was untouched by the Blacklist, made Hollywood business history when he appeared in Anthony Mann’s Winchester ’73 (1953) for a percentage of the film’s profits rather than on a straight salary, under the astute guidance of his agent, Lew Wasserman of MCA. He became a millionaire overnight (McDougal 152–55). Then there were people like Stanley Kubrick, whose 1955 film Killer’s Kiss, which he wrote, directed, photographed, and edited, proved that one could work entirely outside the system on minimal budgets and still get\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n21\n\nsufficient distribution. The list goes on, but if the late 1940s and early 1950s were a time of fear, they were also an era of liberation as actors, directors, and writers found their true market value and were no longer cogs in the studio machine, assigned to projects by administrative fiat. Then came another ruling: in 1947, the Supreme Court declared that the long-approved practice of block booking, in which a studio could force an exhibitor to take an entire slate of films, many of them inferior, in order to get more desired films, violated federal antitrust laws. Again, the studios reeled. As a result, each film had to be sold solely on its individual merits. Similarly, blind bidding—in which exhibitors were forced to bid for a film without even seeing it, based on its stars or the story (usually a hit novel) alone—was also ruled illegal. The distribution strong-arm tactics that had served the studios so well for nearly half a century were suddenly outlawed, and thus the studios cut back on production, making fewer films but with higher budgets and production values, signaling the beginning of the end for “B” movies, or second features. This was followed by yet another ruling: the government filed antitrust suits against Technicolor and Eastman Kodak, alleging that the companies held an effective monopoly on the production of color motion pictures. For years, Technicolor had held Hollywood in a stranglehold with its proprietary three-strip color additive process, which required the use of Technicolor’s own cameras and cameramen. Meanwhile, Kodak quietly developed a single-strip color film that could be used in any camera. The industry had gradually begun to shift from three-strip Technicolor to Eastman’s monopack system, using a single strand of film to record the full spectrum of color—it was cheaper, simpler, and much more convenient. But Kodak refused to license the single-strip technology to others. By late 1948, however, Kodak agreed to make its color film patents available to competitors, thus ending Kodak’s lock on raw stock production and color processing. Now, anyone could easily make a film in full, rich color. The same year, RKO Radio Pictures decided to sell its theaters, anticipating that the other studios would soon be forced by the government to take\n\n22\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nthe same action. Owning production, distribution, and exhibition facilities clearly constituted an unfair business advantage that the studios had been taking for years. In May 1948, the Supreme Court ordered a district court to look into the possibility of forcing the other studios to sell their theaters, thus signaling an end (for the time being) to Adolph Zukor’s master plan of “vertical integration,” in which a studio controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of all their films. (Today’s cable systems, controlled by various media conglomerates, actually mark a return to Zukor’s principal strategy, although in a much more complex and devious fashion.) Paramount, which had fought the government the hardest on this decision, finally signed a consent decree in 1949 that required it to sell its theaters and distribution exchanges, wisely choosing to hang onto the studio end of the business and get rid of the theaters. Soon 20th Century Fox, MGM, and Warners were forced to sell their theaters as well. No longer did the majors have a guaranteed market for their films. Now, theaters could play whatever films they wanted, and the majors had to compete in an open marketplace. The studios were being backed into a corner by a combination of rising costs, shrinking markets, and new legal restrictions on their methods of doing business. To compete, the studios cut production costs to the bone, recycling scripts, sets, costumes, and musical scores to create cost-conscious films. Theater owners, with their new freedom to book whatever they wanted, began to turn to independent producers, who offered more favorable terms and reacted swiftly to fill the power vacuum left by the studios’ loss of power. Upstart production companies, in particular American International Pictures (AIP), entered the arena in April 1956, correctly identifying teenagers as the new, primary postwar audience, and creating a series of low-budget but highly exploitable films directed specifically at that demographic. Further, AIP gave distributors a much better percentage break than the majors on their films, often taking as little as 50 percent of the profits from some bookings, just so long as they controlled both the top and bottom halves of the double bill: an “A” film backed up by a rerelease or a “B” picture—a practice that was still in force but waning fast.\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n23\n\nThen as now, most big-budget films are inherently “front loading,” meaning that they make the majority of their earnings in the first weeks of their release, gradually trailing off in profitability as new films enter the marketplace. Today, of course, with the window between theatrical and home video/on-demand/streaming release relentlessly narrowing, so that many smaller films now open in theaters and in home markets on the same day, the front-loading aspect of contemporary box-office juggernauts is more pronounced than ever. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, before nontheatrical playoff markets (to say nothing of international distribution) were truly lucrative, films made most of their money when first released and by the fourth week or so were playing to significantly diminished returns. Thus, studios would demand onerous “splits” on box office returns for the first week of a film’s theatrical engagement, usually as high as a 90/10 cut in favor of the studio. After all, the studio would argue, we took all the financial risk—you’re the beneficiary of our largesse. This worked until AIP came along; AIP was also, amazingly, the first studio to recognize the potential profitability of the summertime market. In the early 1950s, studios assumed that families would be on vacation in the great outdoors and uninterested in the movies. AIP, with its relentlessly teen-oriented films, such as Gene Fowler Jr.’s I Was Teenage Werewolf and Herbert L. Strock’s I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (both 1957), and later its “sand-and-surf” Beach Party series (1963–1966), proved this axiom wrong. Thus the studios found themselves competing with maverick producers and distribution networks for theater space they had once literally owned; Paramount theaters (once the largest theatrical chain in the United States) had played only Paramount pictures, and the other majors had followed suit. Universal, however, didn’t own any theaters, and so it had learned long ago to compete in an unregulated marketplace; significantly, Universal was also the studio that adapted most efficiently to television by becoming a virtual factory of small-screen fare, something it remains to this day.\n\n24\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nIt was the advent of television, in the midst of this atmosphere of distrust and paranoia, that now loomed as the newest threat to the industry. Back in 1939, television was a novelty in the United States, featured as a scientific wonder at the World’s Fair in New York, but hardly a household item. When the National Broadcasting Corporation began regular daily television broadcasts the same year, there were fewer than a million television sets in use nationwide. Thus it seemed that the new medium posed no serious threat to Hollywood dominance. In only ten years, however, the number of sets rose fivefold, and the studios were scrambling to lure back to the theater those viewers who were staying home to watch Milton Berle for free. This meant a reversal of Hollywood’s early strategy of simply ignoring television, in which networks were forbidden to employ studios’ contract stars or to broadcast their older films. A new industry sprang up, however, providing viewers with such classic television series as I Love Lucy (1951–1957), The Honeymooners (1953–1956), and Dragnet (initial run, 1951–1959; the series was rebooted in 1967 and lasted until 1970), as well as an array of variety shows and sports programming that were cheap to produce. With the rise of television and the decline of the proprietary lure of the theatrical experience, Hollywood fought back with a host of technological advances, such as CinemaScope, Panavision, Cinerama, and 3D, all designed to deliver spectacle that could not be enjoyed at home. Television, of course, had the advantage of being free. I remember vividly when this magic box suddenly appeared in my room, capable of pulling in no fewer than seven stations, operating on a nearly twenty-four-hour basis with programming that consisted almost entirely of filmed entertainment. In the early 1950s, of course, most of this was non-Hollywood programming, as the studios tried to fight back against the television juggernaut by forbidding broadcast of their classic films, but gradually the ban was done away with and home viewers gained access to a nearly inexhaustible library of films, with the minor annoyance of an occasional commercial. At that time, you bought a television, put an aerial on the roof, and\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n25\n\nthat was it; no monthly cable bills, premium channels, or on-demand services—just free, albeit sponsored programming. How could Hollywood compete with that? As we will see, both Warner Bros. and Universal quickly redesigned their studios into purveyors of made-for-television programming, while other studios, such as Columbia, made a fortune releasing their old short films, especially The Three Stooges’ twenty-minute comedies, to television. Walt Disney embraced the medium early on, with a Sunday night hour-long show that served as a promotional device for forthcoming Disney product while allowing the studio to carefully showcase and repackage older material. Alone among the studios, Disney managed—as it still does to this day—to rerelease again and again their older theatrical films to new generations of viewers, controlling the flow of product so that the market never becomes saturated. Disney also created an hour-long, five-day-a-week “strip” series, The Mickey Mouse Club (1955–1958), which was an excellent way to introduce children of the 1950s to cartoon characters from the 1930s and 1940s as if they were contemporary creations, and also to market the Disney brand. There was another factor to consider beyond the emergence of television: the collapse of the star system and identifiable studio signatures as part of the moviegoing experience. “If it’s a Paramount picture, it’s the best show in town,” went one studio slogan, and at the peak of the studio system, audiences were lured by stars, studios, and carefully targeted marketing to venture out of their homes at least once a week to see the latest major studio release. Just as the studios had battalions of directors, cinematographers, editors, grips, set designers, and other technicians to help them churn out films in an unceasing torrent of images, so too did they cultivate a studio farm system of actors, who became dependable commodities in film after film. As Serge Rocco notes, Studios were self-sufficient dream factories with their own back lot (for the exteriors), soundstages, their own crews of decorators, set designers,\n\n26\n\ndeath of the moguls lighting technicians, cinematographers, editors and most of all, stars . . . who kept the dream alive. . . . Films were the product of a very organized process, where everything was achieved within the studios’ gates by studios’ employees. Actors were bound to only appear in movies produced by their contracting studio (under the threat of suspension). On one hand, those stars were limited and could only be ‘loaned’ to other companies (when offered the occasional good script). On the other hand, though, they had everything at the tip of their fingers: horseback riding, fencing, bodybuilding, speech lessons, etc.\n\nBut that entire system is gone. The studios have instead become the repositories of dreams of the distant past, a past they relentlessly fetishize and merchandise, even as they rent out their facilities to anyone who has the money, in order to make ends meet. What the studios lost in the 1948 Paramount decision was a guaranteed outlet for all their wares, and now they found themselves competing not only with each other but with anyone else who had the money, and the chutzpah, to break into the business. Gone were the days when the so-called “Big Five”—20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., RKO Radio, and Loew’s Incorporated (owner of MGM)—controlled the nationwide box office. Universal and Columbia were production facilities only, never owning more than a few theaters, and United Artists, the last of the major production companies, was basically a forerunner of the current system, functioning as a funding source and distribution outlet for independent (albeit studio-connected) producers. The Big Five, as noted, were fully integrated operations, controlling the creation of films from initial concept through distribution and exhibition, a hegemonic monopoly that allowed the classical studio system to function so effectively. Yes, the studios had rosters of skilled technicians, actors, and producers adept at creating entertainment news the public demanded and keeping abreast of current audience trends, but most important they had—through block booking, blind bidding, and in many\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n27\n\ncases their own chain of theaters—a guaranteed outlet for their films, which meant that a torrent of films had to be created on an annual basis; some “A” films, some “B” films, and some even more modestly budgeted. The pipeline was always there—exhibitors could depend on MGM, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, RKO, and Warners each churning out at least one film a week, and then something new would always be playing. Without television as competition, and radio functioning primarily as advance publicity for their efforts, the studios engaged in an almost limitless control over the public’s moviegoing habits. Howard Hughes, who had in the late 1940s acquired a controlling interest in RKO, shrewdly realized that since RKO owned the fewest theaters of the Big Five, agreeing with the government’s demand that the studios divest themselves of theaters might work to RKO’s advantage. On November 8, 1948, Hughes agreed to split RKO Radio Pictures into two separate companies, RKO Pictures Corporation and RKO Theaters Corporation. Hughes then consented to sell either the studio or his theaters—deciding, of course, to keep the studio facilities—and soon the rest of the Big Five were forced to follow suit. Paramount was next, forced to agree to divestiture on December 31, 1949, and with that the rest of the studios fell in line. Vertical integration was finished. The exhibition business was now an open market, and independent producers rushed in to serve the newly liberated theater chains, momentarily forcing the studios to renegotiate distribution terms for the product. Soon, however, it became apparent that the independents lacked both the capitalization and the organizational skills to keep theaters reliably supplied with exploitable product, and so rapidly, through the use of star power, spectacle, and new exhibition processes, the studios regained the upper hand.\n\nMGM, the studio with “more stars than there are in heaven,” was also the most conservative of the Hollywood majors, both politically and in its\n\n28\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nfilmmaking philosophy. Although MGM created many smaller films, most notably the Andy Hardy series starring Mickey Rooney and Lewis Stone, as well as a raft of short films, such as the Pete Smith novelty one-reelers or John Nesbitt’s Passing Parade series, the studio never acknowledged that these more modest productions could in any way be considered “B” films. MGM, or simply Metro as studio boss Louis B. Mayer often referred to the company, was considered a class act, seemingly above the rest of the industry through a combination of nearly overwhelming star power and sheer volume of production, as well as market penetration. MGM’s directors, with the exception of the cheerfully slapdash W. S. “One Take Woody” Van Dyke, were methodical and reliable studio craftsmen, such as Vincente Minnelli, George Cukor, Victor Fleming, King Vidor, and others, but the MGM look was first and foremost the major selling point of an MGM production—their films were glossy, safe, resolutely mainstream, and cloth-coat Republican in every respect. The studio’s sets seemed as if they were museum pieces rather than actual locations, and its stars—both male and female—were groomed to shimmering perfection, with makeup and lighting to fully enhance their phantom desirability. Alone among the majors, MGM was profitable in each year of the 1930s, the most perilous financial landscape this country has ever known. In 1939, MGM pulled in roughly $9.5 million in profits, or about what all the other studios combined realized in that year. Top MGM stars included Clark Gable (“The King”), Spencer Tracy, Robert Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr, Judy Garland, William Powell, Myrna Loy, Mickey Rooney, and many others; all were under long-term contracts that could be extended at will through suspension, until the de Havilland decision put an end to perpetual indentured servitude. The studio facility, a 187-acre plant that encompassed numerous sound stages and standing sets, was one of the most impressive and stable in Hollywood. MGM also made considerable revenue by loaning out their stars to rival companies for individual projects, as when independent producer David O. Selznick absolutely had to have Gable for the role of\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n29\n\nRhett Butler in Gone with the Wind (1939). MGM brokered a deal that not only gave the studio a handsome profit on the actor’s services but also included distribution rights to the film itself. Created in 1935 with the merger of Fox Film and 20th Century Pictures under the leadership of Darryl F. Zanuck, 20th Century Fox was much more thinly capitalized in terms of star power than MGM, but it hit pay dirt with a long line of Shirley Temple films from 1934 to 1940, which effectively kept the studio out of bankruptcy. Other 20th Century Fox stars included Don Ameche, Tyrone Power (perhaps the studio’s biggest box-office draw), Dana Andrews, Henry Fonda, Gene Tierney, and the “exotic” Carmen Miranda. Since the studio’s whole library was minuscule compared to that of the other majors, Zanuck continually fell back on public domain songs, even building entire films such as Henry King’s Alexander’s Ragtime Band (1938) around free-use musical material. The studio also aggressively pioneered the use of Technicolor in its films, while at the same time retaining a robust “B” unit that cranked out westerns, comedies, crime films, and mysteries on a regular basis. The most prestigious director at 20th Century Fox was undoubtedly John Ford, whose films such as The Grapes of Wrath (1940) were both critical and commercial hits. The studio could also call on the reliable Henry Hathaway and even German émigré Fritz Lang, who adapted with surprising ease to the Hollywood system, churning out westerns and suspense films on time and on budget, after a brief and stormy stop at MGM (with 1936’s Fury, a lynch mob drama starring Spencer Tracy, and a deeply atypical film for MGM). Ruthlessly efficient, Zanuck aimed frankly at the most commercial prospects and delivered neat, brightly colored cinematic confections to his viewers, all the while keeping an extremely tight rein on budgets and studio facilities. At Universal, things were more chaotic. Founded by Carl Laemmle in 1915 as the Independent Moving Pictures Company, an enterprise designed to break the Edison trust that had effectively monopolized motion picture production through a series of restrictive patents until a\n\n30\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nSupreme Court decision dissolved the Edison conglomerate), by the 1930s the company was the foremost purveyor of horror films in the industry. Universal also enjoyed great success with the arrival of slapstick comedians Abbott and Costello in the early 1940s, which eventually (if not inevitably) led to a genre/series mashup beginning with Charles T. Barton’s Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). The studio also churned out a stack of program westerns, musicals and cut-rate detective films, most notably the Sherlock Holmes series, which the studio inherited from 20th Century Fox and transported from the Victorian era to the present day, mainly for reasons of economy. Laemmle lost control of the studio in 1935, selling out for a paltry $5 million after his policy of hiring numerous relatives and passing control of day-to-day production to his son, Carl Jr., proved disastrous to the studio’s bottom line. Reorganized as “the new Universal,” with the studio logo of a crystalline globe of the earth surrounded by the words “A Universal Picture”—suggesting that the studio’s appeal reached to all corners of the planet—the studio soon became the model of utterly efficient, bottom-line production that it remains today. Warner Bros. managed to keep the wolf from its door during the Depression through its embrace of Vitaphone, an early sound-on-disc process that brought dialogue to the movies. The company was skating on perilously thin financial ice when Jack Warner and his brothers decided to bet nearly everything the studio had on the production of Alan Crosland’s The Jazz Singer (1927), which contained only a few minutes of actual speech but brought the electrifying presence of Al Jolson to the screen; it became an enormous box-office hit. The other studios, with a sizable investment in silent films, had resisted the switch to sound, considering it just a fad, but Warner’s decision to continue making talkies—driven primarily by financial considerations—forced the entire industry to adapt. Silent films were suddenly and utterly obsolete. With this success, Warner Bros. became arguably the most hardboiled of the Hollywood majors, creating a series of brutal gangster films,\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n31\n\nsuch as William Wellman’s The Public Enemy (1931) and Mervyn LeRoy’s Little Caesar (1931), in addition to exposés like LeRoy’s I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), and racy, complex films such as LeRoy’s Three on a Match (1932), which dealt with adultery, drug use, and kidnapping. Countering these films were the ultra-escapist musicals of Busby Berkeley, such as Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), which abstracted the human body into a series of kaleidoscopic compositions that surprised and delighted Depression-era audiences. While Harry Warner ran the New York “business” and financial end of Warner Bros., Jack L. Warner was the undisputed king of the lot, pushing his contract players, such as Humphrey Bogart, Paul Muni, Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan, James Cagney, and others through one picture after another in rapid-fire succession. In addition, the Warner Bros. animation unit, initially located in a rundown building aptly nicknamed Termite Terrace for its infestation of insects and rodents, became known for fostering a newly anarchic style of cartoons, very different from the Disney “realist” model. Directors such as Isidore “Friz” Freling, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, and Tex Avery created the enduring characters of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, and others, and the WB Cartoon unit, under the direction of producer Leon Schlesinger, was soon the only other major player in the animated short subject field, though Warners never attempted a theatrical feature cartoon, as Walt Disney did with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. In the 1940s, Warners was home to a host of topical war films, most famously Michael Curtiz’s Casablanca (1942), a romantic melodrama that has attained cult status over the years, and film noir crime films, with such productions as Howard Hawks’s The Big Sleep (1946). Warners would regularly suspend actors who refused to knuckle under to their dictates, and routinely cast even top-line talent, such as Bogart and Davis, in “B” films, just to keep the production line moving. When stars objected to such cavalier treatment, they were put on unpaid suspension and forbidden to work in any medium. Eventually most capitulated to studio\n\n32\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\ndemands, but the true mavericks, including Davis, Bogart, Muni, and others, as well as the unlikely figure of Olivia de Havilland, who had never been seen as a studio troublemaker, eventually forced an end to the practice through the courts. Paramount, founded by the business visionary Adolph Zukor, was in many ways the most forward-looking of all the studios. Zukor built the business up from the penny arcade level, as had Warner Bros. and other companies, but it was Zukor who first had the dream of vertical integration that became the industry model, controlling a film from first to last in the marketplace. By 1925, through a complex series of negotiations, Paramount had merged with Famous Players and Jesse L. Lasky to create Paramount Publix, a studio that by 1930 owned more than 1,200 theaters nationwide, making it the largest theater chain in America (Gomery, Studio System 28). Moving smoothly to sound after Warners led the way, Paramount pushed the nascent Production Code envelope by top-lining Maurice Chevalier, the Marx Brothers (in their most effective films), and Mae West in a series of comedies and musicals that burlesqued the conventional mores of the era. The Production Code was originally created voluntarily in 1922 to avoid government censorship of films, under the guidance of the former postmaster of the Harding administration, Will H. Hays. The Hays Office had no real teeth, but when Joseph Breen took control in 1934 things rapidly changed, and the industry was brought to heel. The revised 1934 Code explicitly forbade such topics as “sex perversion,” “miscegenation,” “profanity,” and even the use of liquor in films, resulting in a completely cleaned-up vision of the world that bore no relationship to reality. Paramount, like the other studios, bowed to Breen’s dictates, because, after all, what really mattered to the moguls was the bottom line—box office receipts, ancillary products, radio programs that plugged upcoming releases, any way they could make a buck (see Dixon and Foster 130–32). If they had to soft-pedal the spicier stuff for the moment, the studios had no objections, just so long as the public kept coming to see their films.\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n33\n\nThrough the years, under the leadership of Zukor and production chief Barney Balaban, Paramount’s earnings continued to accelerate, so that by 1946 the company had a net profit of $39.2 million from its films and assets of more than $170 million (Gomery, Studio System 34). But Balaban was shortsighted when it came to the value of Paramount’s back catalogue. To raise capital in the early 1950s, he disposed of much of the studio’s film library, believing that it had no future value. Thus, much of the studio’s output during its formative years now belongs in other libraries, through a complex matrix of legal wrangling that is absolutely byzantine in nature. By 1949, Paramount was forced to sell off its huge theater chain to meet the demands of the consent decree, although by then Balaban had identified television as the next distribution portal to conquer and aggressively began buying up television stations until the Supreme Court ruled against the studio (Gomery, Studio System 37). The studio depended on Cecil B. DeMille’s historical spectacles, together with a series of comedies starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, to attract audiences, which they did with great success. With the loss of its theaters, however, Paramount went into steep financial decline, and by 1967 it was sold for a pittance to the Gulf & Western Corporation, continuing to make films but on modest budgets. RKO met its downfall under the aegis of Howard Hughes, but in its earlier years, under studio head George Schaefer, RKO served as the theatrical distributer for Walt Disney’s animated features and also specialized in one- or two-picture deals with star-caliber actors and directors, as opposed to building up a stable of talent like MGM. In this fashion, Schaefer reasoned, he could capitalize on stars and directors at their peak, rather than having to nurture them through their entire career. Schaefer also used “package deals” arranged by the Music Corporation of America (MCA) to fuel production needs, as well as signing Orson Welles to direct Citizen Kane (1941). In addition, the musicals of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, beginning with Thornton Freeland’s Flying Down to Rio (1933),\n\n34\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nproved lucrative box-office draws, but Rogers left the studio in 1941 and Schaefer was fired in June 1942. In the wake of his departure, as might have been predicted, a much more cost-conscious regime came in, and in the postwar years RKO became known as the “House of Noir,” with downbeat, pessimistic films such as Robert Wise’s Born to Kill (1947). In addition, producer Val Lewton’s horror unit, as exemplified by Jacques Tourneur’s The Cat People (1942) and I Walked with a Zombie (1943), made the studio the only real threat to Universal’s dominance in the horror genre, and a string of low-budget mysteries featuring the Saint, and later the Falcon, rounded out RKO’s late 1940s slate, along with Lupe Velez’s remarkably racist Mexican Spitfire series, which nevertheless made a great deal of money. By the time Hughes had taken control of the studio in May 1948, however, RKO’s fortunes were on a downward spiral. Hughes’s deeply eccentric mismanagement of the studio—constant reshoots, scrapping whole films after production, wild overspending—only made matters worse. In 1955, Hughes sold his collapsing empire to General Tire and Rubber, which tried to make a go of it in film production, but only two years later it sold off the studio facilities to Desi Arnaz’s fledgling television production company, Desilu. General Tire had already sold off the RKO back film library to television, effectively setting up yet another precedent that the majors had hoped to avoid—the availability of theatrical motion pictures from a major studio, now screened for free on home television. There were still some RKO films in the pipeline as late as 1957—the last film produced on the lot was Arthur Lubin’s The First Traveling Saleslady, and the company served as the U.S. distributor for Ishiro- Honda’s Japanese science-fiction epic The Mysterians, also in 1957. But that was the end. RKO was history, and out of its wreckage had come the two things conventional moguls feared most: a working TV studio, producing I Love Lucy and other highly successful television series, as well as a choice library of major studio films for TV. There were, of course, other, smaller studios: Republic, which specialized in westerns and serials; Monogram, which created low-budget\n\nthe postwar collapse\n\n35\n\nhorror films and westerns; and the lowest of the low, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), which made films for as little as $10,000–$20,000, sold them to theaters for a flat rental rather than on a percentage basis, and was referred to throughout the industry as “Poverty Row Crap.” But in the midst of the low-budget activity centering on Gower Street in Los Angeles—known as Gower Gulch for its proliferation of westerns and low-budget programmers—one company was determined to make it out of the minor leagues and into the majors.\n\nColumbia Pictures, founded by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn with partner Joseph Brandt, was a struggling minor studio with great aspirations. Harry Cohn, in particular, who had started as a song plugger during the sheet music era, wanted to see Columbia compete with the Big Five on an equal basis. Columbia would never own theaters, but by cutting costs to the bone and possessing an intuitive knowledge of public taste at its most plebeian level, Harry Cohn kept theaters—especially nonaffiliated ones—supplied with reliable programming on a weekly basis, averaging fifty-two films a year: some good, some awful, and a few quite special indeed. One such opportunity for a prestige picture came his way in 1933, when Cohn obtained the services of Clark Gable from MGM at a fire-sale price—Gable had been demanding more say over scripts and directors, always a bad sign for an actor, and MGM sought to punish Gable by loaning him to Cohn. Cohn pulled top-line star Claudette Colbert from Paramount to play opposite Gable in Frank Capra’s It Happened One Night (1934), which unexpectedly swept the Academy Awards, although it was produced for a paltry $300,000 (Gomery, Studio System 165). Columbia’s status as a major studio was now within reach. And Harry Cohn—known as “White Fang” (so dubbed by prolific screenwriter Ben Hecht for his crude demeanor)—was ready to take advantage of his moment in the spotlight.\n\nchapter 2\n\nw White Fang at Columbia\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Harry Cohn was sailing on his yacht, the Jobella, with the distinguished film director Rouben Mamoulian, whose many credits included Queen Christina (1933), Ninotchka (1939), and The Mark of Zorro (1940), as his guest. Gradually, as the two men relaxed, the talk turned from business matters to uncharacteristic introspection— uncharacteristic, at least, for Cohn, who seldom let anyone see any weakness in his character. As the two men sipped drinks, Cohn suddenly demanded of Mamoulian, “You’re an intelligent man; will you answer me a question?” Startled by Cohn’s directness, Mamoulian agreed. “What happens to us after we die?” queried Cohn, much to the director’s amazement. Though nominally Jewish, Harry Cohn had never been much of a religious man, in either his business or personal life. Composing himself, Mamoulian responded: “Well, there are various beliefs. Some people believe that death is the end of everything; some believe life goes on.” “What do you think?” Cohn demanded. “My personal feeling is that there is another life,” Mamoulian said quietly. Harry Cohn wasn’t satisfied. “What proof can you give me?” Mamoulian shrugged. “I can only say that between the two hypotheses, I prefer to believe that there is a link between this life and the next. It makes more sense than the theory that we are in something that is just temporary. People who suffer in this life can expect a better life next time.” Cohn remained unconvinced. 36\n\nwhite fang at columbia\n\n37\n\n“Rouben, I want you to prove it to me!” he pleaded. But Mamoulian could offer no proof, and Cohn remained essentially an agnostic, believing in no one but himself (Thomas, King 360). By 1957, Cohn was a dying man. He had suffered his first brush with mortality in March 1954, when he was successfully operated on for throat cancer (Dick, Merchant 184). Now, his health was again an issue. Plagued by a heart ailment that his physicians—the top specialists in the medical profession, naturally—told him could be cured with surgery, Cohn used his connections to obtain copious footage of open heart surgery from medical schools, hospitals, and universities, and he ran the films in his private projection room for hours on end, fascinated by the procedure, but unable to face surgery himself (Thomas, King 360). In the end, although he was by this time practically living on nitroglycerine tablets, he decided against an operation that could have potentially saved his life. His will, signed on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 1958, left his worldly goods to his wife and children, and specified that no funeral services should be held after his death (Thomas, King 359; Dick, Merchant 186). Roughly two weeks later, Cohn died from a heart attack on February 27, 1958, while vacationing in Phoenix, Arizona. His last words, as he was rushed to the hospital, were: “It’s no use. It’s too tough. It’s just too tough” (Thomas, King 363). When the ambulance reached Saint Joseph’s Hospital, Cohn’s wife, the former Joan Perry, a devout Catholic, had a priest baptize Cohn’s body, claiming that in his last moments “he had invoked the name of Jesus Christ” (Thomas, King 363). Despite his admonition that no service of any kind should mark his passing, Joan Cohn saw to it that two Columbia soundstages were converted into a memorial chapel—just like a film set—and on March 2, Harry Cohn received as ornate a memorial service as anyone could imagine. The soundstages were overflowing with freshly cut floral tributes. Danny Kaye read a eulogy written by screenwriter Clifford Odets. Danny Thomas then took the microphone, reading an abridged version of the Catholic rite of burial, as well as the Twenty-third Psalm in its entirety.\n\n38\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nMore than two thousand mourners attended. Despite the many bitter, personal disputes Cohn had conducted over the years with his numerous employees, those who had worked with him turned out in force: William Holden, Kim Novak, John Ford, Dick Powell, Tony Curtis, Glenn Ford, Jack Lemmon, Spencer Tracy, and Frank Capra were among the luminaries present for the ceremony (Thomas, King xiii; Dick, Merchant 189). The man who wanted no funeral was going out in Hollywood style, mourned by those with whom he had spent his career working in a rough-and-tumble industry, in perhaps the most notoriously fractious studio in town. Yet Harry Cohn was a man who hated sentimentality, and perhaps he would have found it grimly amusing when Red Skelton joked about the funeral on his television show the following week. Marveling at the huge turnout for a man almost universally considered the most abrasive and belligerent studio head in the business, Skelton quipped, “Well, it only proves what they always say—give the public something they want to see, and they’ll come out for it” (Thomas, King xvii–xviii). The studio audience laughed uncomfortably, and the joke was roundly criticized in the various gossip columns and editorial pages of the daily press, but Harry Cohn would have recognized the essential truth of Skelton’s jibe. For “Harry the Horror,” “White Fang,” or “King Cohn,” as he was variously known, was without a doubt the most hated studio head in Hollywood history. Not that there was a consistency of opinion about him. In an interview I conducted with the director Budd Boetticher just before his death, he stated simply that “Harry Cohn was a very dear friend of mine.” When I responded with a startled “You don’t hear many people say that!” Boetticher laughed and agreed, “No, you sure don’t, but what can I tell you? He was a great guy, and we got along great,” before detailing how Cohn first met the young Boetticher, then an assistant director on George Stevens’s The More the Merrier (1943), and the two men engaged in a lively verbal joust, during the course of which Boetticher threatened to “knock Cohn on his ass” for bothering Stevens while he was rehearsing a scene with stars Joel McCrea and Jean Arthur.\n\nwhite fang at columbia\n\n39\n\nCohn responded by calling Boetticher “a son of a bitch,” at which point Boetticher responded in kind; this stopped Cohn cold. Looking at Boetticher thoughtfully, Cohn suddenly told the young man to be in Cohn’s office at 6 P.M., and quietly walked off the set. Certain that he was going to be fired (a sentiment shared by Stevens, McCrea, and Arthur), Boetticher nevertheless showed up in Cohn’s office at the appointed hour and was more than a little surprised when Cohn summarily asked him to take over the last two days of direction on Lew Landers’s Submarine Raider (1942), which effectively launched Boetticher’s long career as a director. “I get the impression that if you let Harry Cohn walk all over you, he would, but if you stood up to him, you were in,” I ventured. “That’s it exactly!” Boetticher responded. This was the essence of Cohn’s character in a nutshell. A tough customer, you could only reach him by being just as tough, if you could reach him at all (Dixon, “Boetticher” 41–42). Similarly, Fritz Lang, no shrinking violet himself, noted parenthetically during an interview with Peter Bogdanovich on the making of the Columbia crime noir The Big Heat (1953), “By the way, I am one of the people who liked Harry Cohn—he was always very nice to me. Mostly he is hated, very unreasonably” (219). But then Lang knew how to take care of himself in the clinches, and despite presenting an amiable face to the general public he was well known to be a single-minded martinet on the set. Other opinions of Cohn: “He wanted to pull everyone down to his level” (Edward Dmytryk); “He had great taste—it was blind, instinctive— but it was taste” (Rosalind Russell); “An impossible man, but he had complete belief in himself” (Darryl F. Zanuck); “He was a square shooter” (Ida Lupino); “He gambled on people, never on himself” (Frank Capra); “He could be cruel, kind, giving, taking, despicable, benevolent, compassionate and malevolent, all at the same time” (Glenn Ford); “He was an okay guy” (John Huston); “He was a son of a bitch” (John Wayne) (Thomas, King xix). This gives you some idea of the range of emotions Cohn inspired in his colleagues; crude, complex, brutal, and yet sensitive, Harry Cohn was Columbia Pictures, from its inception until his death,\n\n40\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nand he ran his domain like a medieval kingdom in which no one would dare question his authority. Cohn was born on July 23, 1891, in New York City, and left school early on—he was too busy working to let anything like a normal education get in his way. His early jobs included being a chorus boy, a shipping clerk, a fur salesman, part of a vaudeville act, a streetcar conductor, and a song plugger, or salesman, who would try to sell songs by various composers to popular singers of the day. In 1918, he landed a job as Carl Laemmle’s personal secretary at the fledgling Universal Studios and learned the business firsthand, though Laemmle’s management style was considerably more benevolent than Cohn’s (Katz 274). “Uncle” Carl was notorious for hiring his relatives for studio jobs they were essentially unqualified for, including his son, Carl Jr., leading to the oft-quoted piece of doggerel, “Uncle Carl Laemmle / Has a very large Faemmle.” Harry’s brother Jack had already been working at Universal for ten years, but, unlike Jack, Harry was a young man in a hurry. Less than two years later, in 1920, Jack, Harry, and their colleague Joe Brandt set up their own shop, the C.B.C. (Cohn/Brandt/Cohn) Film Sales Company. While Jack and Joe remained in New York to raise money and sell product, Harry arrived in Hollywood and set up offices on Gower Street, “Poverty Row,” and rapidly demonstrated a knack for producing lowbudget westerns, comedies, and other program pictures on fractional budgets. Harry Cohn used every tactic he could think of to keep costs down and the company afloat; he would draw money on a bank in New York and spend it in California to make a film, then cover that check with another check, and so on and so on, until a film was sold and the money actually realized and duly deposited. But C.B.C. was getting a bad reputation in Hollywood as a strictly low-budget enterprise; its nickname was now “Corned Beef and Cabbage” (Thomas, King 36). That had to change, and in 1924, C.B.C. was reincorporated as Columbia Pictures. From then on, Harry Cohn was unstoppable.\n\nwhite fang at columbia\n\n41\n\nBy the 1930s, Joe Brandt was eased out for $500,000, and Jack Cohn, who tried to go behind Harry’s back to A. P. Giannini, president of the Bank of America (then the Bank of Italy, and Columbia’s chief source of finance), to topple Harry and assume direct control of the studio, was demoted to the position of vice-president and treasurer. All this left Harry in complete control of production at the studio, which is what he had always wanted, but it set up a longstanding battle of wills between the two brothers. Jack, still on the East Coast, with a huge farm in Connecticut, a wife and children, more and more the family man, took charge of all financial matters, while Harry was the hard-nosed West Coast production head. They would remain locked in combat for years, each hoping to catch the other in some business error. Frank Capra was witness to one particularly violent argument between Harry and Jack during one of Jack’s visits to the Gower Street studios, during which he was sure that Jack and Harry would soon resort to physical violence. Suddenly, Harry heard the unmistakable sound of a Good Humor ice cream truck chiming in the street below his office. Calling a halt to the argument, he nonchalantly strode to the window and ordered two ice cream bars, one for him and one for Jack, and the vendor tossed them up for Harry to catch. Harry dropped down two dimes, handed one ice cream bar to Jack, took a bite of his own chocolate crunch bar, and only then resumed the battle with his brother, screaming, “Now listen, you son of a bitch,” as Capra looked on, amazed (Thomas, King 80). The story illustrates what distinguished Harry Cohn’s business style more than anything else: his ability to switch gears almost instantaneously. If he found that his current strategy wasn’t working—at least, when he was trying to woo a prospective employee—he would try something else. Brute force not effective? Try flattery. Flattery not cutting it? Use threats. Still not getting results? Then Harry would do anything— bribe, cheat, lie, steal—anything to get what he wanted. Once Cohn had them under contract, it was a different story; Cohn’s true, dictatorial personality would emerge, leaving little doubt as to who was in charge.\n\n42\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nOver and over again, Cohn would intone a phrase that almost became his personal mantra, “I kiss the feet of talent,” but that was only during the honeymoon stage. Cohn was a shrewd negotiator, a superb judge of talent, and a ruthless businessman. He knew how to run a studio, and he knew what the public wanted. In short, he knew how to make movies. With the success of It Happened One Night in 1934, Harry Cohn was ready to move into the big leagues. Always on the lookout for new talent, with Frank Capra (for the moment) firmly in his hip pocket, Cohn went after director Dorothy Arzner, whose previous films included the feminist aviation drama Christopher Strong (1933) for RKO. When Arzner became a free agent, Cohn lured her to Columbia as a producer/director— unheard of for a woman during this era—and oversaw the production of Craig’s Wife (1936), starring Rosalind Russell on a loan-out from MGM. Shot in four weeks for $280,000, Craig’s Wife was a smash hit, and Arzner continued with Columbia for the rest of her career, the only woman directing in Hollywood. Cohn already had a history of hiring people at their peak and then firing them the moment their box office value began to drop even slightly. Arzner was no exception: her last film for Columbia was the deeply feminist World War II resistance drama First Comes Courage (1943), by which time her star was perceptibly waning. When Arzner fell ill during shooting, she was summarily replaced with a Columbia contract director, and though the film was released to good reviews, Arzner never again directed a theatrical motion picture. As an early admirer of Benito Mussolini—Columbia released a patched-together “documentary” feature, Mussolini Speaks, in 1933, when fascination with the fascist dictator was still in vogue, realizing profits of more than $1,000,000 on a $10,000 investment—Cohn realized that power had to be exercised in order for it to be retained. Others were always waiting in the wings, ready to take your place. When Mussolini Speaks proved a huge hit, Cohn traveled to Italy, where Il Duce received Cohn with full state honors and even awarded the producer an honorary\n\nwhite fang at columbia\n\n43\n\ndecoration. What most impressed Cohn about Mussolini, oddly, was his office, a long hallway with a raised desk at the end where Mussolini held court. It was a long trip up the carpet to see the dictator, and as Cohn later admitted, recounting his visit to Mussolini’s palatial office, “By the time I arrived at his desk, I was whipped” (Thomas, King 102). And so Harry Cohn designed his office at Columbia in the Mussolini manner and affected the same trappings of power over his own subjects. Harry Cohn was tough on everyone. When Eddie Buzzell, a former Broadway star, drifted into Cohn’s orbit, he pleaded with his boss to let him direct a film. Cohn allowed Buzzell to direct a series of musical/ comedy shorts but refused to see them. Buzzell was convinced that if Cohn saw one of his two-reel comedies, he would be so impressed that he’d give Buzzell a feature to direct. Finally, Buzzell dragged Cohn to a preview of one of his new shorts, which Cohn seemed to enjoy. But as the crowd exited the theater, Cohn, Buzzell, and the two actresses who were their dates for the evening noticed a bedraggled man cross the street in front of them, climb up a lamppost, and then jump off headfirst onto the sidewalk below. The man was killed instantly. Buzzell and the two actresses were shocked, but Cohn simply shrugged and headed for the studio car, not missing a beat. On the way back to the studio, Buzzell, still shaken, muttered, “My God, Harry, why would a man do such a thing?” Cohn had a ready answer: “He must have seen your picture” (Thomas, King 242–43). Buzzell was stunned by Cohn’s callousness, but the retort was simply a measure of the man. It was Cohn’s way all the time, and other people simply didn’t exist unless they were useful to him. When that ended, Cohn discarded them without a backward glance. His profanity and browbeating became so ingrained that one of Columbia’s top directors, Charles Vidor, actually took Cohn to court over his continual harassment, after Cohn referred to him as a “Hungarian motherfucker who would do anything for money” (Thomas, King 249), among numerous other gratuitous slurs, including no fewer than twenty-nine variations of “son\n\n44\n\ndeath of the moguls\n\nof a bitch” (Thomas, King 253). The judge in the case was unmoved and amazingly found against Vidor, ruling that Cohn’s habitual use of profanity was so well known that anyone who agreed to work for him would simply have to put up with it (Thomas, King 255). When Vidor returned to the studio, Cohn assigned him to a string of “B” pictures, but the director retaliated by going wildly over budget on each production, forcing Cohn to remove him and replace him with another, more compliant director. Cohn continued to badger the director with inferior assignments until Jack Cohn convinced Harry that the feud was just bad business—Vidor, the director of Rita Hayworth’s breakthrough film Gilda (1946), was simply too valuable to be used this way. Furthermore, Jack Cohn and the New York office ruled that an apology was due Vidor, and Harry was predictably livid. But because Columbia’s need always came first, Cohn arranged for a trip for Vidor and himself on Cohn’s private yacht and brought along a Columbia studio screenwriter, Michael Blankfort, as a witness (Thomas, King 257). The three gathered on the dock before boarding the yacht. Finally, after a fashion, Cohn apologized, thus: “They say I’m supposed to apologize. If you think I’m going to say I’m sorry, you’re out of your fucking mind.” For some reason, Vidor realized this was the best Cohn could do and accepted, saying, “That’s all right, Harry.” Cohn immediately turned to Blankfort, barking, “You’re the witness; you heard me apologize,” before boarding the yacht—alone—and leaving Vidor and Blankfort to return to Los Angeles. Such a fragile relationship, however, was bound to shatter, and in 1948 Vidor again threatened to take Cohn to court for his unbridled behavior (Thomas, King 257). This time, however, Cohn won an even greater victory. Vidor, eager to get away from his tyrannical boss no matter what the cost, finally agreed to pay Cohn $75,000 to terminate his Columbia contract. Yet ten years later, in the mid-1950s, Cohn decided that he wanted Vidor back at Columbia and began negotiations to retain his services as a director. Nothing came of it, as Cohn’s career was coming to an end, but curiously, Vidor, Cohn,\n\nwhite fang at columbia\n\n45\n\nand their wives suddenly began seeing each other socially and were on friendly terms when Cohn died in 1958 (Thomas, King 257). Cohn ran his studio like a factory—he had to. Like all the other studios, Cohn used block booking to force exhibitors to run his program pictures if they wanted Columbia’s best films, but in Columbia’s case, the secondtier material really was second rate—the Crime Doctor series, the Blondie films, the Boston Blackie detective thrillers, and an endless series of formulaic westerns. Yet mixed in with the dross were films of genuine quality, and by the late 1930s “prestige” Columbia pictures became more prevalent as the double-bill system started to collapse and feature films were sent out on their own. Harry Cohn pulled as many strings as he could, called in as many favors as he could, and arranged as many low-cost loan-outs of top-flight actors, writers, and directors as he could, and Columbia began to turn out first-rate films on a regular basis. But life under Cohn’s regime at its peak in the 1940s was difficult indeed. As Ephraim Katz notes, “Cohn was notorious for his ruthlessness and vulgarity. He ruled his studio like a despot, spying on employees through informers and a hidden microphone system, hiring and firing at will, courting the strong and humiliating the weak” (274). Or, as Bob Thomas put it, “The relationship of Cohn to his creative talent invariably followed a three-part pattern: the wooing and the honeymoon; the drive for control; the divorce” (King 208). Even Frank Capra, who had put the studio on the map as Columbia’s first truly important director, was not immune. Capra had been with Columbia almost from the company’s inception, and such early Capra films as The Power of the Press, So This Is Love, That Certain Thing, Submarin"
