From Fear and Desire, Killer’s Kiss, The Killing, through Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket, his films have startled us, mystified us, and continually offered sounds, images, and, most of all, visualized ideas that keep us returning to them over and over again. We cannot forget them. Our book attempts to understand the power of Kubrick’s work, and the man behind it, to get closer to his creative process through one film in particular, his last, Eyes Wide Shut. Though met with some scorn when it was released in 1999, just after Kubrick’s death, it, like so many of his films, has gained in stature over the years. There is something so typically Kubrickian and, as always with his films, uncanny about its mixture of technical virtuosity with the quotidian, even the banal, and its mysterious aura at the borderline between wake and sleep and dream, sexual longing and frustration, an action hero celebrity playing a humbled man. Though so much quieter, even reserved, than previous Kubrick films, Eyes Wide Shut is all but hypnotic with its assured rhythms and troubling, dreamlike atmosphere. It is a film deliberately made so that you can’t quite get it out of your head. Our work is an attempt to create an archeology of the film, uncovering its buried layers, to understand its evolution: its prehistory, development and production, reception and afterlife. It is based mostly on research into the records of the film’s production held in the Stanley Kubrick Archive at the University of the Arts in London, supplemented by other materials and interviews. We also offer a new reading of the film, a critical analysis of its key scenes and what it is about, though, given its complexity, this is always tentative and impossible to be exhaustive. But then so is archival research. While the Archive holds detailed material about all the phases of the making of the film, they are, given Kubrick’s working methods, not total. The Archive is, at the time of this writing, largely missing faxes, which, along with the telephone, were Kubrick’s favorite means of communication. But the material that is there supplies enough to allow us to extrapolate from the archival record a larger vii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nimage of the work of a director whose control over his films was more complete than almost any other filmmaker one can think of—​“complete total annihilating artistic control,” as Kubrick demanded early in his career. Our research and analyses have, we hope, enabled us to see Eyes Wide Shut whole and in its parts, to understand and account for its long, long gestation, the struggle with Frederic Raphael over the screenplay, and the amazing detail of its painstaking, exhausting production, all the way through its reception and the conspiracy theories that surround it. Stanley Kubrick thought it his best film. We have tried to show why. Robert P.

Interviews, both in person and in print, were invaluable help in writing this book. Many people involved in the making of Eyes Wide Shut were gracious in giving us their time and thoughts. These include Jan Harlan, Kubrick’s executive producer (and brother-​in-​law) whose help made this work possible, and Kubrick’s wife, Christiane, whose blessing allowed us to go forth. Kubrick’s assistant Tony Frewin; his former producing partner, James B. Harris; artist Chris Baker; University of Maryland Professor of German Literature Peter U. Beicken; Steadicam operator Peter Cavaciuti; casting director Denise Chamian; assistant producer Brian W. Cook; actresses Victoria Eisermann, Vanessa Fenton, Abigail Good, and Ateeka Poole; Tim Everett, former Director of European Technical Operations for Warner Bros.; actor/​director Todd Field; pianist Dominic Harlan; art director Lisa Leone; production designer Kira-​Anne Pelican; composer Jocelyn Pook; props man Michael Wolf; Warner Bros. executive Julian Senior; choreographer Yolande Snaith; and cinematographer Larry Smith were generous with their time. There has also been correspondence with actor Tony DeSergio and Katharina Kubrick. There are names missing here, of course. We did reach out to Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise through their representatives, but to no avail. Others wished to honor Kubrick’s desire for secrecy. A variety of other individuals also provided assistance along the way, including Geoffrey Cocks, Siobhan Donovan, Ian Hunter, Neil Jackson, Peter Krämer, Christopher Loki, Vinnie LoBrutto, Matt Melia, Lawrence Ratna, Filippo Ulivieri, Laurent Vachaud, Leon Vitali, David Wyatt, and the anonymous readers of our proposal and draft manuscript. Finally, we would like to thank Norm Hirschy for bringing this proj­ ect to fruition after a long gestation period. The team at Oxford University Press,\n\nix\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nincluding Wendy Walker, Leslie Johnson, and Aishwarya Krishnamoorthy have been invaluable in the production of this book.

Once he decided to make it, once Kubrick was ready to make it, there were years in screenwriting, preproduction, shooting, and postproduction. The actual shoot took almost 18 months, the longest in filmmaking history. The making of the film was such a strain on the then 70-​year-​old filmmaker that he was thoroughly exhausted by the time shooting was finished, let alone editing. He died of heart failure less than one week after he showed the film to its stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and Warner Bros. executives. Despite the strain, Kubrick was quite upbeat about the film. He told his executive producer and brother-​in-​law Jan Harlan that it was his best work. It certainly is a film very different from those that preceded it, though it is very much a Kubrick film, and like the previous films, it takes many viewings to understand its depths and grasp its enigmas. Different but the same: Eyes Wide Shut is Kubrick’s summa, a summing up of all the ideas developed across a creative lifetime and in many ways a summing up of the history of film. It is detailed, purposeful, measured, weighty, full of details large and small that, like any Kubrick film, keep delivering new insights on each viewing. Its emotional charge pushes somewhat reluctantly through its elegant, complex form. Like all his work, emotion is gained by active engagement and recollected in tranquility. The lack of overt, easily accessed emotion is one thing that initially disappointed the critics. But with an intensity of engagement, Eyes Wide Shut is a gratifying, fulfilling, masterful job of filmmaking. It repays attention and multiple viewings; it stays in the imagination and the emotions; it circulates and inoculates us against ordinary cinema. Because it is not ordinary. It is enigmatic, as was its creator. Kubrick famously worked in relative isolation: private, eschewing celebrity, a New York Jewish intellectual living with his German wife and three daughters north of London since the 1960s, making each of his 13 films with a growing obsession for detailed research and meticulous preparation. His biography remains sketchy, despite the growing amount of research in\n\n1\n\n2\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nhis archive housed in the University of the Arts in London and despite the huge biography by Vincent LoBrutto, written before that archive became available, and the less generous one by John Baxter. Despite the charming memoir of one of his closest assistants, Emilio D’Alessandro, a man who attended his every need for years, but was still kept at arm’s length. Despite the other diaries, memoirs, and recollections of scores of collaborators—​including the excellent short book by Michael Herr—​it remains difficult to fully understand Kubrick’s personality and his complex trains of thought. What was Kubrick thinking during the increasingly long periods of time between films? Why did it, in fact, take an increasingly lengthy period of time between them? And the films themselves: What do they mean? How do they mean? How do they fit together in ways that make his last film stand out as a summation of his previous work? Intensity is the key. We need to read Kubrick—​the artist and his films—​with the same intensity that went into the creation of those films. This means looking at the minute particulars of his obsessions, research, preparation, shooting style, editing, and postproduction publicity and exhibition. We need as well to attend to the reception of his work. How did the critics respond, and how did that response change as writing about his films moved from reviewers to scholars? How do the conspiracy theorists respond with their fevered readings of strange events in this film full of secrets? We need to look at some of the particulars of his life. While we are not writing a biography of the filmmaker, we are writing a biography of the film he made; but in doing this, we need to know something about him, a man famous for keeping his personal life personal. What we do know is that Eyes Wide Shut was close to half a lifetime in preparation, a route we will trace in the first chapter. We know as well the amount of preparation that went into the production once Kubrick decided it was time to move ahead with it. The growing lag between films reflected, at least in part, a growing difficulty in finding the right story or novel. This, combined with the obsession to research material down to the smallest detail (thousands of photographs of doorways for the prostitute’s apartment in Eyes Wide Shut, for example, resulting finally in creating a doorway on set). Since Kubrick was financially secure, he did not need to turn out just any film. He did need to feel comfortable that the intense labor involved in making a film—​recreating Vietnam in a disused London gasworks for Full Metal Jacket (1987), for example—​would demonstrate an intelligence and commitment, intense visual detail, a striking narrative, and a complex, resonant subtext. This intensity is evident from the very beginning, when Kubrick began to practice his talent. That beginning was his job as staff photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s, work that exposed him to celebrities and, more importantly, gave him the opportunity to learn the techniques of lighting and framing images that would later serve his filmmaking. It was also a job that enabled him to skip college and become, essentially, an autodidact. He sat in on courses taught by Lionel Trilling, Mark Van Doren, and Moses Hadas at Columbia University, but the movie\n\nI n t rodu ct ion\n\n3\n\ntheaters and the New York streets were an even more influential school. He read and viewed voraciously. He took thousands of images for Look and saw hundreds of films. The urge to make those images move was finally irresistible. He started with documentaries: Day of the Fight (1951), The Flying Padre (1951), and The Seafarers (1953). Day of the Fight was an extension of a feature on the twin Cartier brothers (one a boxer, the other his manager) that he had photographed for Look magazine. RKO, still an important studio in the early 1950s, picked up the film for distribution and advanced Kubrick the money to make Flying Padre, a short film about a priest in the Southwest who travels to his congregants in a small plane. The Seafarers was a promotional documentary made (in color) for the seafarers’ union, but on which Kubrick was able to stamp his emerging signature in both theme and style. Kubrick also did some second unit photography for a five-​part television series about the life of Abraham Lincoln, and he directed a short documentary film for the US State Department about the World Assembly of Youth. Kubrick’s first theatrical feature was a war film, the first of many films in which warfare figured directly or incidentally. Fear and Desire (1953) was made with his relatives’ money, was independently distributed by Joseph Burstyn, who was an important figure in the early art house movement, and was received well. The first half of the 1950s was very productive. Fear and Desire was followed quickly by Killer’s Kiss (1955) and The Killing (1956), both drawing on the noir genre that was at the end of its dominance by the time Kubrick made them. The director who would go on to make complex films with high production values introduced himself to filmmaking with “B” pictures, in the case of The Killing, based on pulp fiction. In fact, Kubrick called on Jim Thompson, a writer of often brutal pulp fiction, to supply the dialogue based on a novel by crime writer Lionel White. The Killing marks several important events in Kubrick’s career. He partnered with James B. Harris, who would be his producer through Lolita (1962) and who, Harris says, “set up” Dr. Strangelove (1964) before his amicable separation from Kubrick to pursue his own directorial career. During their time together, Harris took some of the management burden off the director, allowing him to concentrate on the filmmaking process. That process began to show the complexity that Kubrick would apply to the various genres he played with throughout his career. The Killing should be, at heart, a straightforward heist narrative with touches of noir, in the tradition of John Huston’s 1950 film The Asphalt Jungle. It involves a group of thieves planning a racetrack robbery only to be undone by a series of unforeseen events, including its weakest member, his rapacious wife, and a rival mobster. But Kubrick scrambles the narrative, breaks up its time scheme, and turns its main character into an existential loser. The Killing was very much a film of the 1950s, filled with the angst of the decade, represented by the hopelessly complex schemes of outlaw striving. In addition to The Asphalt Jungle, it has its antecedents in André de Toth’s Crime Wave, a 1953 film with many of the actors who would then appear in The Killing. Johnny Clay (played by Sterling Hayden, who was also in Huston’s and de Toth’s\n\n4\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nfilm and later in Dr. Strangelove) is Kubrick’s first fully formed troubled male character, full of plans and desires that can only meet with failure. (Davey, the boxer with a glass jaw in the previous film, Killer’s Kiss, manages to foil the thugs and get the girl. Interestingly, the sexual undercurrents and New York setting of Killer’s Kiss make it a dim and distant relative of Eyes Wide Shut.) The Killing was distributed by United Artists and though it was not a commercial success, it did put Kubrick in the sights of Hollywood. It also furthered his ambition and desire to move out of the “B” picture dead end. It also marks a moment when he began pursuing his love of fin-​de-​siècle Austrian literature. We will discuss this attraction in some detail, especially as it involves Arthur Schnitzler and Traumnovelle, the source novella for Eyes Wide Shut. It is important to note here that at this moment in the middle to late 1950s, while he was making gangster films and would soon make his second war movie, Paths of Glory, Kubrick wanted to film another Austrian writer’s work, Stefan Zweig’s 1913 Burning Secret. Zweig’s novella is about a child who unwittingly acts as a go-​between for his married mother and her would-​be seducer. It is a disturbing story with sexuality and child abuse churning beneath its surface. It had already been made into a German film by Robert Siodmak in 1933 and would be made again by Kubrick’s assistant, Andrew Birkin, in 1988. Together with novelist Calder Willingham, Kubrick wrote a script for Burning Secret, which was presumed lost but was re-​discovered by Nathan Abrams in July 2018 as being in the possession of Gerald Fried who, presumably, had been asked to score the film. Unfortunately, the studio (MGM) cancelled the project and Kubrick never made the film. His Vienna reveries would have to wait another four decades. Kubrick continued working with Willingham and Thompson, this time adapting Humphrey Cobb’s 1935 novel, Paths of Glory (1957). The search for funding led to an unusual, and as it turned out fateful, source. Kirk Douglas, then at the peak of his popularity, had started his own production company, Bryna. He, Harris, and Kubrick came to an agreement that would allow Douglas to star in and Kubrick to direct a World War I film to be made in Germany. Paths of Glory is a brutal, uncompromising film about class as well as battlefield warfare. Questions of class would haunt Kubrick’s films and break out into the open again in Barry Lyndon (1975) and Eyes Wide Shut. Despite his desire to soften the film somewhat, Kubrick allowed the narrative propulsion of Paths of Glory to reach what was for its time the grimmest possible end. Three conscripts are chosen by their martinet general—​a man who ordered fire on his own men—​to be tried and executed for failing to attack an impossible target. The film marks a leap in Kubrick’s formal and thematic style. The relentless tracking shots through the trenches, the stark, deep focus spaces of the courtroom, the complete impotence of Douglas’s Col. Dax in the face of an implacable high command, coalesce into a way of cinematic thinking that would be finely developed in the films to come.\n\nI n t rodu ct ion\n\n5\n\nPaths of Glory created an unforeseen but career-​and life-​changing event. He met Christiane Harlan. Billed as Susanne Christian, she played the young captured German girl who, at film’s end, is forced to sing for the troops before they head out to the front. She soon became Kubrick’s third wife in a marriage that lasted a lifetime. On the professional level, Paths of Glory further cemented Kubrick’s reputation in Hollywood, and he went into negotiations with Marlon Brando about directing Brando in the film that would become One-​Eyed Jacks (1961). The struggle of two enormous egos could never lead to an agreement, and Brando fired Kubrick, directing the film himself. Meanwhile, Kirk Douglas was in production with his sword-​and-​sandal epic Spartacus (1960). Anthony Mann was directing and quickly fell out of Douglas’s favor. Mann wanted to emphasize the visual elements of the story; Douglas pushed for more dialogue. After three weeks, Douglas fired Mann. Given that Douglas wanted less emphasis on the visual, it seems an odd choice to have replaced Mann with Kubrick. Douglas no doubt believed he could exercise more control over the young director than he could over an old hand like Mann. He was wrong. The production was a series of struggles among Douglas, Kubrick, and the screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo, as well as the big-​name actors Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, and Peter Ustinov. This would be the second film Trumbo would have his name on since his blacklisting during the years of McCarthy and the House Committee on Un-​American Activities (the first, Otto Preminger’s Exodus (1960), would be released after Spartacus, allowing Douglas to claim that he had broken the blacklist). Douglas, Trumbo, Howard Fast (author of the novel that was the film’s source), and the film’s big stars fought throughout the production over the script and over Kubrick’s direction. It was not a pleasant shoot, but it gave Kubrick the experience he needed in handling a large, complex production, and of working with theatrically trained British actors. Spartacus also taught Kubrick what he did not want to do again. He was, during the production of this film, an oppressed worker, chafing under a studio producer’s control. This was not what the independently minded Kubrick wanted, and he realized that to obtain the control he needed, he would have to leave Hollywood. He would not make another film in the United States. After the premier of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), he never returned there. Lolita followed Spartacus. It further brought the director’s name into public recognition. Filmed outside London, partly to escape the intolerable conditions of the American producer system, partly to escape the dead hand of the Production Code, and partly to take advantage of British tax incentives, production facilities, personnel, and expertise. A sign of Kubrick and Harris’s growing reputation was that Vladimir Nabokov agreed to adapt a screenplay from his near-​pornographic novel. Kubrick and Harris showed extreme deference to the world-​famous novelist. But Nabokov’s effort was a 400-​page script that they regarded as unfilmable, allowing\n\n6\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nHarris and Kubrick a basis from which to fashion their own screenplay, carefully skirting what the censors would obviously forbid, cultivating the head of the British Board of Film Censors, making a film that was at once a melodrama of the fall of a child abuser and a grim comedy about the taking down of a hapless pedophile. Lolita has a double life. One involves its production, the end run around the censors that allowed it to be made; the other is a film that adumbrates many of the concerns and obsessions that will haunt the later work. Humbert is an engaging personality. The pity James Mason elicits for his character is countered by the twitchy, creepy performance of Humbert’s double, Peter Sellers’s Clare Quilty. To be sure, Humbert is one in a long Kubrickian line of males igniting their inevitable failure, and he foreshadows Barry Lyndon, Jack Torrance, and even Bill Harford in Eyes Wide Shut. The trials of masculinity as it exists within the domestic sphere are central to Kubrick’s work. How men strive and fail, creating the means of their own destruction, falling under the burden of sexual angst or complex schemes that overwhelm them, is crucial to understanding every one of his films. Whether the catastrophes are external to the characters or internal, part of their psyches, as in Eyes Wide Shut, the results are always the same: some sort of collapse, defeat, occasionally a recognition, sometimes a profound change, though never an epiphany. But there is an irony in Humbert’s character that, more than Kubrick’s other men, emerges from him rather than happening to him. Kubrick is the supreme ironist and manipulator of the characters he creates, which is why Humbert and Quilty seem a bit out of place. Their internal engines—​what they do to themselves—​are more powerful than the appalling things they visit on the other characters in the film. Humbert’s acts are dreadful enough and Quilty is more than his match in child abuse. But the gavotte in which they find themselves is a danse macabre of their own making. Humbert would be an ardent lover, no matter that his object is an underage girl who eventually betrays him by marrying and carrying the child of a very ordinary man. Quilty is the more malevolent pervert, the simpering trickster side of Humbert, shot to death by the unlucky lover before he himself dies in prison. The circular narrative of the film—​a form Kubrick would use again in A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Eyes Wide Shut—​has Humbert killing Quilty at the beginning of the film and repeating the scene at the end. Lolita is also a film about domesticity and its discontents. Throughout his films, Kubrick demonstrates a growing concern with the dysfunctions of the domestic scene, particularly the ongoing threat to the patriarchal imperative. “Just a little problem with the old sperm bank upstairs,” says Jack about his wife to the phantom barman in The Shining (1980). Jack may well be crazy, and he certainly suffers a derangement of all the senses and all his powers. He is filled with barely repressed rage at the constricting confinements of his family responsibilities. He went to the Overlook Hotel to escape, but his isolation only magnifies his resentment and sense of masculine entitlement. He wants to maintain his authority, indeed ownership,\n\nI n t rodu ct ion\n\n7\n\nof the family that he ultimately plans to destroy. They should be under his eye and thumb, but Wendy and Danny keep interfering, foiling the ghostly spasms of violence Jack wants to commit. Barry Lyndon climbs the social ladder until he loses control over his sociability. He traffics with whores and considers his wife, as our narrator tells us, “not very much more important than the elegant carpets and pictures which would form the pleasant background of his existence.” Barry loses his son in the most sentimental scene Kubrick filmed. But his wife and her child survive, and, as in The Shining, with considerable damage to the patriarch. Jack is outwitted by his son and frozen to death in the hedge maze, as well as being frozen in time in a photograph. Barry is frozen in a freeze frame. Critically, both are crippled, and symbolically castrated, before dying: Wendy injures Jack’s leg and Barry loses a leg in a duel. Punishment is as cruel for Humbert in Lolita. The domestic scene is corrupted by Humbert’s infatuation with Lolita Haze and further ruined by Humbert’s double, the shape-​ shifting pornographer, the proto-​Ziegler Quilty. The breakdown is part of a dynamic shift in the normal relationship of husband, wife, and child, since Humbert married Charlotte merely to satisfy his desire for her child. When Charlotte conveniently dies in a traffic accident (Humbert receives the news where else but in the bathroom, one of Kubrick’s favorite domestic places), he is free to snatch his nymphet from Camp Climax and take her on the road, pursued by Quilty. The road trip is a larger-​scale foreshadowing of Bill Harford’s solo walk through the streets of Greenwich Village. Humbert seeks fulfillment of an impossible desire, thwarted by a man more venal than he is and by his Lolita, who turns into an ordinary married and pregnant hausfrau, crushing poor Humbert, who wishes it had been him. Dr. Bill wants to extinguish the memory of desire implanted by his wife’s admission that she was sexually attracted to another man and prepared to leave her husband and daughter to run away with him. There is a dreamlike quality to Kubrick’s Lolita. It opens and closes with Humbert’s drive to Quilty’s fog-​shrouded château that recalls the fog of Fear and Desire, as well as the mists of countless fairy tales. In the novel, Quilty’s house is located on Grimm Road; in the film its interior is a surreal mess of broken bottles and furniture draped in sheets. Lolita’s cyclical narrative enshrouds the body of the film, which is otherwise as close to the realist style as Kubrick ever gets. But even this close is not as close as average filmmaking. The mix of comedy and melodrama, the strangeness of Sellers’s Quilty, the deep unease of finding sympathy for a child molester make Lolita simultaneously entertaining and uncomfortable. Discomfort is a response deeply prized by Kubrick. The dream world will be the habitat of so many of his characters. Lolita creates a perverse domestic scene, The Shining a psychopathic one. Jack Torrance might be considered Bill Harford’s Id. Jack, the would-​be writer, his wife, and young son are holed up in a hotel haunted by Jack’s own twisted unconscious. Like the “monsters from the Id” in the 1956 science fiction film Forbidden Planet\n\n8\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\n(a film that Kubrick admired and that was an influence on 2001), Jack’s unconscious manifests itself as ghostly apparitions and violent acts. As in Lolita, it is the child who is victorious and indeed tortures and victimizes the father. Humbert is reduced by his dowdy and pregnant teenage lover to tears and a heart attack. Jack becomes a howling thing frozen in the snow of the hedge maze where his son has trapped him. Throughout his films, the family is a nightmare of bad choices and violent ends, of unbearable mistakes and deplorable decisions. The formal structure of the films echoes, indeed sets, the tone for the misery that ensues. Lolita’s modulated black-​ and-​white cinematography and measured pace, enshrouded within the mists of Quilty’s (haunted) castle, express both the banality of Humbert’s desires and the monstrousness of them, especially as refracted through Quilty’s bottomless corruption. The Shining, in comparison, is a bold, loud film, its images large and startling, its editing jarring. Even Barry Lyndon, a mostly quiet and reserved film, is painted on a broad canvas; it is, after all, a costume drama whose compositions are based on 18th-​and 19th-​century paintings. There are fights, battles, and duels, and Barry loses a leg in what amounts to a virtual castration of a destroyed man who had grand ambitions. But even those take place at a stately, ordered pace, befitting a society based on decorum and a masked façade. It is against this statuesque backdrop that Barry’s frenzied attack on Bullingdon jars—​an outburst of Id at a concert recital that is the embodiment of the genteel and gentile Superego—​emphasized by Kubrick’s handheld camerawork. A typical Kubrickian situation. “Boldness” is an apt description for the films leading up to Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick was a quiet, self-​possessed man, living primarily within his own intellect, always processing his voluminous reading and viewing. He made bold, often violent films that churned with extraordinary ideas, and then, in the end, he quieted down. But not before destroying the world and probing infinity. Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is about circumstances driving characters, who scurry about in spaces prepared for their destruction along with the rest of the world. Preparations for the production of Dr. Strangelove began in collaboration with Peter George, author of the novel Red Alert, and later with input from Terry Southern. The screenplay started out as a carefully researched melodrama about nuclear war. As such, it might have been similar to Sidney Lumet’s Fail-​Safe, which appeared a few months after Dr. Strangelove and which Kubrick successfully delayed. But the more he thought about it, the more contact he had with the likes of doomsday scenarist Herman Kahn, who theorized the survivability of nuclear war, the more evident became the craziness of the Cold War, the arms race, and the anti-​Communist complex of the late 1950s and early 1960s. The resulting film is a cry of anger, cloaked in a comic-​satiric wrapper of unredeemable madness. As always, Kubrick’s males fail, but the mad generals, incompetent president, and revived Nazi of Dr. Strangelove don’t simply fail, they engineer the apocalypse and are helpless to prevent it.\n\nI n t rodu ct ion\n\n9\n\nThis was the period in which Kubrick was thinking hard about loss and the end of things. In his working life, Dr. Strangelove marked the end of his association with James Harris. But his profound eschatology is clear in many of the films of the time: the end of the world due to human folly in Dr. Strangelove; the end of the human itself and the ascent of artificial intelligence in 2001; the force of pure, state-​sanctioned malevolence in A Clockwork Orange; the loss of patriarchy and paternity in Barry Lyndon; patriarchy’s destruction in The Shining; the infantilization of killers in Full Metal Jacket. It is interesting to note that the opening music of both A Clockwork Orange and The Shining is the Dies Irae, the day of wrath, from the Catholic Requiem Mass. This seemingly misanthropic, apocalyptic vision is expressed through an irony severe enough to lead the viewer off in different, sometimes contradictory directions. The encapsulated fetus that circles the Earth at the end of 2001 may represent an alien-​manipulated evolution of a new man, but that fetus could otherwise signal the triumph of computer intelligence—​HAL’s dream of a post-​human entity, a cyborg. The end of the world in Dr. Strangelove is a bang; 2001 ends with the possibility of rebirth; the other films end, if not with a whimper, then with what can be seen as the grinding, exalting return of cycles of despair, occasionally tinged with optimism. Eyes Wide Shut ends with resignation, but also hope. The passion of Barry Lyndon speaks to the pain of class conflict and the doomed attempt to move out of the place where one is born—​to move anywhere but within a closed circle of a small victory and major loss. Barry is a poor-​born rogue whose slow movement into the aristocracy is marked by violence, loss, mutilation, and exile. His family is trapped in an endless cycle of bills demanding payment. Alex de Large in A Clockwork Orange is moved in a circle from murderous rapist, to cringing coward, to reformed convict, and possibly back to murderer again, though now under the control of the state. Cycles of diminishment, the ironic turn from power to an impotence that is either destructive or destroyed, constitute the theme and form of Kubrick’s films through Full Metal Jacket. Seemingly, there is no redemption and certainly no escape from the dismal traps that his male characters find themselves in and, more often than not, build for themselves. Alex may have back his old masturbatory fantasies, but he is now in league with the government he rebelled against. Danny and Wendy escape Jack’s murderous rage, but Jack himself is caught in the maze of those very murderous impulses, frozen in a beastly attitude ready to cycle back into the curse of the Overlook Hotel. Dave Bowman ends as an enwombed fetus circling the Earth. Perhaps a new beginning; perhaps the end of the human. And then, 12 years after Full Metal Jacket, a change. Full Metal Jacket is a film of grindingly violent humiliation and dehumanization, of masculinity turned on itself, producing killers who wind up at the violent mercies of a woman, who end singing the Mickey Mouse Club song as they march through fields of fire. Eyes Wide Shut, by comparison, is a calm, introspective film, with few pyrotechnics, and small, incremental moves to some insight on the part of its male protagonist. It is as well the\n\n10\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nsumma of Kubrick’s concern with domesticity and its discontents, but in a different key. It is a quest narrative, the aim of which is to learn what secrets lie between a married couple that, when revealed, cause a wrenching tear in the marriage. It queries whether that tear can be healed. But Kubrick’s ideas of domesticity had both mellowed and become more complex. The frenzy and violence of his preceding films is replaced by a more measured pace, a reticence to overplay his hand, a retreat into a dreamlike logic that itself dictates a disconnected languor. Domesticity in Eyes Wide Shut becomes a starting place for dreams and all the tricks dreams play with the sleeper; all the discontents of women and, especially, of men as they navigate intimacy. There are many traps set for the character of Bill; he constantly makes the wrong moves. He circles around relentlessly in search of answers to his perceived sexual inadequacy. He is obsessed with the phantom loss of masculine prerogative. But unlike so many of Kubrick’s earlier male characters, he is not destroyed; he is only somewhat diminished—​chastened, more accurately—​and comes at the end to a certain delicate balance, an unsteady state of hope. What caused the change of perspective? How is Eyes Wide Shut like and unlike the previous films, what makes it work in ways the others do not? We have looked at the records of the production and talked to people responsible for the making of Eyes Wide Shut. We have found a few answers, though not the single key to unlock a difficult film, if such a key even exists. Our discoveries cannot change the reality of the film: its pace is slow; there is little physical violence; it keeps its emotions under tight control. It is also filled with detail: its production design is meticulous and sophisticated, its spaces are filled with significant objects, and the surroundings of its oneiric New York City are inscribed with meaningful words and cautionary legends. The intense, measured, almost Brechtian acting of the film’s characters is placed within a mise-​en-​scène that vies for our attention. Eyes Wide Shut is a film that the viewer must work on, perhaps not with the intensity that Kubrick worked on it, but with a willingness to give it the kind of attention that most films do not demand. We try here to pay attention to that demand and, along with our history of the film’s gestation and making, offer some readings of the film, some ways of understanding and becoming comfortable with it. Or perhaps just making you comfortable with your discomfort. So much of the form and content of Eyes Wide Shut—​its expressive inexpressiveness; its visual restraint; its slow, deliberate pace; its focus on domesticity—​can be explained by referring to the literary critic Edward Said’s notion of “late style,” in which the artist is no longer under pressure to do other than what he or she wants or needs to do, to create out of “the artist’s mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris and pomposity, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained as a result of age and exile.” Kubrick was in his late 60s when he started production work on Eyes Wide Shut (though, as we will see, he was working on it throughout his creative life) and in his fourth decade of exile. Not having made a\n\nI n t rodu ct ion\n\n11\n\nfilm in 12 years, still hopeful about A.I.: Artificial Intelligence and Eric Brighteyes—​an adaptation of H. Rider Haggard’s 1890 novel about the adventures of its eponymous character in tenth century Iceland—​he may have realized that Eyes Wide Shut would be his last. It is, in the context of the films that precede it, a modest film, unashamed of its simplicity, its pace, its effect on its audience. Kubrick paid no attention to time when making the film. He shot when everything—​sets, lights, camera placement, actors—​was exactly where he realized it had to be. If a set or location didn’t suit him, he changed it, even if it meant a month’s delay in shooting or, as in the case of Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh, losing actors. Unashamed of his fallibility, Kubrick, in a sense, acted himself in his last film. Kubrick has too often been criticized as a “cold” or distant figure, whose detachment from the world shows in his films. But in Eyes Wide Shut the coldness is gone (it was never really there in any of the films where distance was confused with detachment) and in its place is a variety of personal touches that bring the film closer to its director, and the director’s life close to the film itself. In what follows, we explore the film’s making and its afterlife as a repository of conspiracy theories and serious critical commentary. Part of our job is to attempt to understand what it is about Kubrick and his films that generates so many differing responses, and why Eyes Wide Shut in particular has drawn what seems to be an endless stream of commentary by turns absurd or serious. We note how its very title has become part of the cultural discourse. All this is part of a larger investigation about the ways Kubrick’s films resonate long after their appearance; why, unlike many other films, they gain their power to move us in a kind of upward graph from first viewing through many subsequent ones. We live with them and they with us like a dream remembered.\n\n1 “It’s Probably Going to Be the Hardest Film to Make” Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Schnitzler, and the Long Gestation of Eyes Wide Shut\n\nEyes Wide Shut was close to 50 years in the making. Like all of Kubrick’s films, it started by reading a book. Kubrick read voraciously throughout his life. “All the films I have made have started by my reading a book. Those books that have been made into films have almost always had some aspect about them which on first reading left me with the sense that, ‘This is a fantastic story: is it possible to make it into a film?’ ” Arthur Schnitzler’s novella, Traumnovelle—​about a married couple, Fridolin and Albertine, who inhabit a dreamlike world of sexual jealousy and restlessness—​which would form the basis of Eyes Wide Shut, presented itself as a “fantastic story” very early on. Traumnovelle had been serialized in Die Dame magazine in Vienna before being published as a book in 1926. It was translated into English by Otto P. Schinnerer as Rhapsody: A Dream Novel in 1927 and reissued in 1955. This was the edition—​along with a translation made by his executive producer and brother-​in-​law, Jan Harlan—​that Kubrick eventually used to develop his film. Alexander Walker suggests that “Kubrick’s hankering to make a film of Schnitzler’s novel probably goes right back to his cinema beginnings.” While Schnitzler and his work may not have become an obsessive concern with Kubrick—​indeed, our point is that it took a lifetime for him to finally realize it—​Schnitzler and his time were never that far from Kubrick’s mind. The author and his story hit a deeply personal chord that kept sounding, no matter how quietly and intermittently, throughout his filmmaking career. Schnitzler’s work had a persistent effect on Kubrick’s thinking, even his state of mind. There are some uncanny parallels. Schnitzler claimed to have worked on Traumnovelle for about 20 years, from 1907 to 1925; Kubrick claimed to have\n\n13\n\n14\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nworked on adapting the novella for 30 years. Schnitzler was age 66 when he finally completed the novella and he died at 70; Kubrick completed his screen adaptation of the story in 1999, and he too died at 70. Kubrick’s middle-​class Jewish urban upbringing in the Bronx, combined with his Austro-​Hungarian Jewish lineage, was certainly different in time and place from Schnitzler’s fin-​de-​siècle Jewish upbringing in Vienna. But Kubrick and Schnitzler were both sons of educated doctors who encouraged their sons’ creative and artistic talents. Schnitzler was a writer and pianist and Kubrick loved books and music (especially the drums) as well as chess, sports, and photography.\n\nUncovering Schnitzler How did the young Kubrick discover Schnitzler? James B. Harris, Kubrick’s producing partner in the 1950s and early 1960s, confirms that Kubrick had read Traumnovelle before they met in 1955. According to Michael Herr, who coscripted Full Metal Jacket and became a confidante and friend, Kubrick had read the novella in the 1950s, because in 1980 Kubrick sent him a copy, telling him “he’d read it more than twenty years before.” His first contact may have come in the well-​stocked library of his physician father, Jacques—​or Jack, as he preferred to be known—​who encouraged his son to delve into his books deeply and freely. Kubrick had discovered other books through his father’s library, notably Humphrey Cobb’s Paths of Glory (1935), which he eventually adapted in 1957. There is good reason to believe that he discovered Schnitzler there as well. Schnitzler may also have come his way through the courses he took at New York’s City College and Columbia University after he finished high school. It may also have come by means of his second wife, Ruth Sobotka, born in Vienna in 1925, the year before Schnitzler published Traumnovelle. By 1947, Sobotka was living and working as a ballet dancer in New York. Kubrick had met her that year when he photographed her for the January issue of Look, and if you look closely he can be seen sitting in the audience in the film of Hans Richter’s avant-​garde Dreams That Money Can Buy (1947) in which Sobotka was featured. Kubrick began dating her around 1952. Sobotka was active in New York’s thriving avant-​garde world and introduced Kubrick to many of its key figures. Kent Lambert is certain that she introduced him to Austrian literature, including Schnitzler’s work and Traumnovelle. He says, “Her influence on Stanley Kubrick and his films was significant.” Kubrick’s third wife, whom he married almost immediately after leaving Sobotka, Christiane Kubrick, said that her husband “saw extraordinary parallels between his relationship with Ruth and the Traumnovelle hero’s dealings with women.” Sobotka died in June 1967, a year before he first decided to adapt the novella into a film.\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n15\n\nSchnitzler, Kubrick, and Sexuality Schnitzler cut an interesting figure both in his life and in his writings. He was a member of the Young Vienna group of writers and intellectuals that included such luminaries as Hermann Bahr, Richard Beer-​Hoffmann, and Peter Altenberg, who helped to shape 20th-​century Viennese modernism. He was a friend of Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, and a contemporary of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gustav Mahler, Hermann Broch, and Stefan Zweig. In Zweig’s words, Schnitzler gave “Viennese literature a new status in Europe, a rank that it had never before reached.” Schnitzler was prodigious sexually, with many mistresses and affairs, and literarily an introspective author who used his work as a process of self-​analysis. He was a dueling, philandering, cosmopolitan polymath who kept a diary of his promiscuous sex life, including, it is said, every orgasm he had. He has been described as “perhaps the most famous portrayer of adultery in literature written in German.” Schnitzler was obsessed with sex, in his life as well as his writing. Kubrick compared Schnitzler to Napoleon when explaining his interest in making a film about the emperor. He told Joseph Gelmis, “His [Napoleon’s] sex life was worthy of Arthur Schnitzler.” Schnitzler’s treatment of sex and sexuality appealed to Kubrick. His written works are mostly about sexual affairs, liaisons, adultery, betrayals, seduction. In his 1902 short story “Death of a Bachelor,” for example, the letter of a dead man reveals to his friends that he had seduced each one of their wives. At one point, Kubrick wanted to film it. The blasting of domestic tranquility seems to have been as much on Schnitzler’s mind as the sexual act itself, which, in Schnitzler, was always suggested, even though, given the time in which he wrote, never described. But Kubrick was free to show and tell—​to a point, at least—​and to probe more deeply than Schnitzler into the sexual roots of domesticity and its discontents. Clearly, the erotic thrust of Traumnovelle appealed to him, and the sexuality inherent in Schnitzler is a key reason Traumnovelle haunted Kubrick for so long. But there are also its themes of dreams, the fluid boundaries between dream and reality, the doubling of characters and events, the crisis of the male libido, identity, odysseys, fantasies, marriage, dysfunctional family dynamics, and sexuality that show up frequently in Kubrick’s work, from his earliest photographs and documentaries through his final film. This intertwining of interests helped seal the bond between the two artists, with sexuality being a most important link. Sex was often on Kubrick’s mind. Tony Frewin, Kubrick’s longtime assistant, recalls that Kubrick was fascinated by pornography and the erotic, and sexual imagery permeates Kubrick’s work from his earliest photography for Look magazine through his last film. A full-​page photograph taken by Kubrick of artist Peter Arno in his studio features a fully nude model in semi-​rear view. The picture was considered so risqué that Campbell’s Soup withdrew its advertising contract with the magazine. The caption to the photograph, stating that the much older Arno only likes to\n\n16\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\ndate “fresh, unspoiled girls” much younger than himself, has vague premonitions of Humbert Humbert in Lolita. Even more explicit are the contact sheets for a series called “Woman Posing” in which a woman dances suggestively on stage, removing her clothes until she is wearing a very skimpy bikini with a see-​through bra. Kubrick managed to slip female nudity into his documentary of the Seafarers International Union (SIU), The Seafarers, which showcases “the first example of nudity in a Stanley Kubrick film and shows the director’s adolescent sense of sexuality.” At one point, the screen is filled with a shot of a pinup calendar on the wall of the Seafarers’ barbershop. On it is a naked woman, wearing only a string of pearls draped above her breasts. Kubrick’s biographer Vincent LoBrutto suggests the “shot is there to entertain the hard-​living sea-​bound men who will be the main viewers of the in-​house film and to arouse the perverse and devilish sense of humor tickling Kubrick.” Meanwhile the voiceover narration says, “A pleasant sight after any voy­ age is . . . the SIU barbershop.” And when the film depicts the SIU building’s art gallery, Kubrick includes two female nudes, echoing the earlier pinup calendar in the barbershop. In Kubrick’s first feature-​length film, Fear and Desire, there is a long sequence in which the crazy soldier Sidney tries to calm a local captured fisherwoman who has been tied to a tree. His attention turns into a sexual assault. The promotional materials for the film emphasized this sexualized sequence. Kubrick’s next film, Killer’s Kiss, features a boxer who falls in love with a “taxi dancer” (a euphemism for prostitute), variations of which we meet in Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut, as well as the latter’s source in Schnitzler. There are similarities between the nocturnal wanderings and dreams of Davey Gordon in Killer’s Kiss and Bill Harford, who wanders the dream city of Kubrick’s last film. Davey goes up against a lower-​ class proto-​Ziegler (Victor Ziegler, the malicious presence in Eyes Wide Shut) called Rapallo, whose very name suggests “rape” or “rapacious,” and who is aroused by watching Davey getting beaten up on TV and forcibly has sex with Gloria, who despises him. In an echo of Schnitzler, Davey even duels Rapallo to the death—​but with an ax, pike, and plaster mannequins rather than swords. The Killing continues the sexual theme with its sly references to the repressed and unrequited homosexual desire of the fatherly Marvin Unger toward his younger protégé Johnny Clay. Sherry Peatty, the vampish, sluttish wife of her weak, love-​smitten husband, George, wheedles the information about the racetrack robbery scheme and tells it to her lover. Sherry uses her noir femme fatale wiles to ruin Johnny Clay’s robbery scheme and get everyone but Johnny killed. Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is permeated with sexual imagery. From its opening coupling of the refueling of the B-​52 bomber to its final, orgasmic, nuclear annihilation, the thrust of the film is the perverse conversion of power and potency. Many of the names are sexually charged: Buck Turgidson, Jack D. Ripper, Lionel Mandrake, King Kong, Merkin Muffley, DeSadesky, Kissov, and the like. General Jack D. Ripper fears the loss of his semen,\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n17\n\nor “precious bodily fluids” as he calls it, and turns his fear of sexual impotence into nuclear destruction. General Turgidson complains that we don’t want the Russians to catch us with “our pants down.” As the apocalypse begins, the inhabitants of the War Room fantasize about the sexual attractiveness of the surviving women, whose ratio will be 10 to each male and who will accompany them into the mine shafts where they hope to reproduce the human race. Sexuality in Full Metal Jacket is part of its very discourse. Sexualized language, sexualized actions are a constant, whether in the near-​constant reference to fucking or the twisted jargon of US Marine Corps drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the grunt-​speak of the GIs as they penetrate deeper into Vietnam, or the “me so horny” mantra of the Vietnamese prostitute. Full Metal Jacket can be read as a long reverie on sexual repression. The film climaxes with the killing of a female sniper, whose dying plea of “shoot me,” coupled with Rafterman’s observation of “hardcore,” plays on the double meaning of firing a gun and making a pornographic movie. In those films in which shades of Schnitzler begin to be visible—​Killer’s Kiss, The Killing, Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining—​themes of sexuality and domesticity are prominent. But in none of these films, including the adaptation of Schnitzler’s Traumnovelle, is there the naïve subtlety found in Schnitzler’s own work. Obviously, Kubrick, filming in the 1950s through the 1990s, could show and tell more that Schnitzler could at the turn of the 20th century. Indeed, both Lolita and Eyes Wide Shut pushed the boundaries of film censorship in Britain and the United States. By the time it came to make the film, Kubrick could represent sex and sexuality explicitly. Alice Harford tells her husband of her attraction to a handsome sailor when they were on vacation. Her admission sets Bill off on his nocturnal wandering, during which he imagines the sailor, at first in full uniform, making love, with increasing vigorousness and nudity, to his naked wife. There are naked bodies vigorously fornicating during the orgy—​bodies digitally covered for its initial US release (see Fig 5.1). Eyes Wide Shut does not so much stress sexuality as it inquires into the stresses of intimacy in marriage and the imaginings of a husband who feels his very masculinity is called into question by revelations that his wife has her own sexual longings. The film summarizes Kubrick’s sexual obsessions quietly but devastatingly as Bill’s damaged sense of masculinity propels him on one sexual misadventure after another.\n\nFreud and the Fin de Siècle But more than the attraction of sexuality drew Kubrick to Schnitzler. Ilan Stavans characterizes Schnitzler’s oeuvre as describing “an atmosphere of hypocrisy and masquerade, recreating a world of capricious gamblers, duplicitous women, and obsessed men moving through the glittering, doomed society of the late nineteenth\n\n18\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\ncentury.” While such a description perfectly fits Barry Lyndon (set in the late 18th century), it also is apt for much of Kubrick’s other films that are set in the present, Eyes Wide Shut in particular. Stavans points to Kubrick’s almost clinical approach to his characters, much like Schnitzler’s as cold and “without affection.” But he stresses as well that, despite the distance, even the misanthropy, the two artists investigate their characters’ interior, nocturnal lives. Both Kubrick and Schnitzler, he writes, are a bit cynical, even misanthropic. Kubrick goes further than Schnitzler in exposing his characters’ vulnerabilities, and both “investigate their nocturnal life, [pitting] the unconscious against the public façade.” For Schnitzler, “hysteria, hypnosis, and the tension between morality and pleasure were [his] main subjects, which explains Sigmund Freud’s deep interest in him.” For Kubrick, hysteria is more restrained, and in place of hypnosis, dreamwork is his concern, especially in Eyes Wide Shut. Both artists were interested in “bourgeois degradation, hypocrisy, and illicit liaisons” themes which animate Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, and Eyes Wide Shut. Like Schnitzler, the tension between interiority and the external world percolated up from a Freudian base where sexuality and its discontents drive their characters’ misadventures. Always Sigmund Freud. Kubrick was drawn to Schnitzler and even more fervently to Freud. Kubrick mentioned how “Schnitzler’s plays are absolute gems of buried psychological motivation.” Freud was drawn to Schnitzler and once wrote to him: “I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition—​ though actually as a result of sensitive introspection—​everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons.” Diane Johnson, who cowrote the screenplay for The Shining with Kubrick, felt that “Freud always interested him, which is why he was attracted to Schnitzler.” In unpublished parts of a long interview with William Kloman of the New York Times in 1968, Kubrick recounted how “I saw a letter in Psychological Quarterly that Freud wrote to Schnitzler where he said that Freud has always avoided meeting Schnitzler socially . . . because he said he had always regarded Schnitzler as his doppelganger, and there’s supposed to be some superstition that if you ever meet your doppelganger, you’ll die.” Freud’s letter is worth quoting in full: I think I avoided you out of a kind of fear of encountering my double. Not that I easily identify with another or that I wanted to ignore the difference in talent that separates us, but in immersing myself in your splendid creations, I have always believed I would find, behind their poetic surface, the assumptions, interests, and results that I knew to be my own. Your determination, like your skepticisms—​which people often call pessimism—​ your sensibility to the truths of the unconscious, mankind’s drives, your dissection of our conventional cultural attitudes, your intellectual concentration on the poles of love and death, all of that awakens in me a strange sentiment of familiarity.\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n19\n\nIt could be said that Kubrick’s romance with Schnitzler’s Traumnovelle was itself a process of sensitive introspection, of determination and skepticism, over a very long gestation, just like Schnitzler. Perhaps Freud’s words also speak for Kubrick who, as Michel Ciment suggests, “waited decades before meeting Schnitzler ‘as through a glass, darkly’.” Ciment even sees Kubrick as Schnitzler’s double. This may go too far. There may be some uncanny parallels between Schnitzler and Kubrick, but the director’s life and art are nothing like Schnitzler’s. Perhaps there is something aspirational going on: Kubrick was not Schnitzler, but Schnitzler wrote the kind of literature Kubrick felt was waiting to be filmed. Freud, particularly his theories of the uncanny and the return of the repressed, infiltrates almost all of Kubrick’s films. Between the two, the theorist of the unconscious and the writer of unconscious, libidinous drives, Kubrick found inspiration. Kubrick responded to a modernist impulse in fin-​de-​siècle Vienna. This included the work not only of Schnitzler (who was in fact not pleased with the direction of some new modernist artists) and of Freud, but also of the painters Oscar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele, and especially Gustav Klimt, whose gold-​flooded canvases influenced much of the set design of Eyes Wide Shut and whose eroticism would be taken to heart. There is also the notion of the fin de siècle itself, the mark of a turn in culture and politics with the ending of one millennium and the beginning of another. Eyes Wide Shut is a fin-​de-​siècle work, made and released at the end of the 20th century and set in New York—​not the New York of the neorealist location shooting that makes up Kubrick’s second feature, Killer’s Kiss, but an imaginative melding of the city of his memory and of old Vienna that had become fat with wealth. The Zieglers of New York and the inhabitants of the orgy (“If I told you their names . . . I don’t think you’d sleep so well,” Ziegler tells the stunned Bill Harford) were quickly making up the 1 percent. The Harfords of New York were getting reasonably wealthy servicing them. Tim Kreider points out that both fin-​de-​siècle Vienna and New York were “corrupt and decadent high culture[s]‌dancing at the brink of an abyss. In the champagne haze of Victor’s party the 1990s and 1890s become one, just as the ’70s and the ’20s met in one evening at the Overlook Hotel.” Kubrick had always been interested in questions of class and wealth—​not to mention the abyss into which the world is ready to fall—​and these interests infuse his last film. He had always been interested in Freud and sexuality, in the uncanny, in the possibilities of painterly compositions in his films, in the turmoil of the male unconscious. He found it in Schnitzler, his cohorts, and their milieu, awaiting a final spark that was quite long in coming.\n\nMax Ophüls and Schnitzler Max Ophüls was a direct, cinematic influence, paralleling Schnitzler. Ophüls, one of the few directors whom Kubrick continually mentioned as an impact on his own work, had made films from two of Schnitzler’s plays, Liebelei (1933) and Reigen (La\n\n20\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nRonde, 1950). Were he in New York at the time, Kubrick would likely have seen La Ronde in 1954, when the Supreme Court lifted New York state’s ban on the film, which had been condemned for “immorality.” It had already opened in Los Angeles in 1951, and Kubrick may have seen it there since at the time he was traveling back and forth between the two cities. Ophüls was the maker of lavish period films marked by dynamic, perpetual camera movements that traced the sexual peccadillos of La Belle Époque and the details of his characters’ every mood and gesture. La Ronde, based on Schnitzler’s play, is a playful, self-​reflexive work in which a master of ceremonies cum ringmaster leads the viewer through the affairs of a variety of lovers. Its lightheartedness masks a somewhat mordant view of intimacy or its absence that might well have appealed to Kubrick even this early in his career. “I did very much like Max Ophüls’s work,” Kubrick wrote to Alexander Walker. “I loved his extravagant camera moves which seemed to go on and on forever in labyrinthine sets.” It is at first glance a curious attraction, until we remind ourselves again of Kubrick’s early affinity for the fin de siècle, the period beloved by Ophüls as well. Kubrick saw in Ophüls that same yearning for the churn and charm of the belle époque at the dawn of modernism that Kubrick himself seemingly felt for many years. In Ophüls as in Schnitzler are the tales of sexual misadventure, of infidelities and affairs, of human sexual foibles that Kubrick, perhaps indulging a precocious young adult desire, found attractive and challenging as cinematic material. What’s most interesting is that he fought that desire until near the end of his career. In the early 1960s he was considering a “rethink version” of Ophüls’s 1949 melodrama The Reckless Moment (which was filmed in Hollywood and starred James Mason) and, though nods to Ophüls show up here and there, particularly in Paths of Glory and Barry Lyndon, it is not until Eyes Wide Shut that Kubrick gives him his full attention. What Kubrick never suppressed was the dynamic movement of Ophüls’s camera, which is barely still for a moment, movement that goes, as Kubrick said, on and on. From Davey’s nightmare in Killer’s Kiss, where the camera flees through a city street printed in negative, through the opening shot of Eyes Wide Shut, as the camera gracefully follows Bill and Alice as they leave for the Ziegler’s party, Kubrick’s moving camera shots remain in the memory: the long sweep across the bus station when Johnny Clay brings his suitcase to a locker in The Killing; Col. Dax’s walk through the trenches in Paths of Glory; Poole’s jog around the circular interior of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey; Alex’s march through the record boutique in A Clockwork Orange; the suicidal march of the troops in Barry Lyndon; Danny’s bicycle ride through the hallways of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining; Hartmann’s stroll through the barracks, abusing his troops, in Full Metal Jacket. These are some of the bravura moving camera shots in Kubrick’s films. There are more subtle tracks, such as the mysterious lateral movement of the camera that precedes Jack emerging from the shadows of the Overlook as Wendy\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n21\n\nreads his engrossing manuscript—​“all work and no play”—​or the circles around the inner sanctum of the orgy in Eyes Wide Shut. And there are innumerable yet even more subtle camera movements, all of which, large or small, demonstrate Kubrick’s control over cinematic space and his creation of a dynamic imaginary world. Ophüls’s camera movements may be passionately decorative filigrees; Kubrick’s are stronger statements of spatial mastery. For Ophüls, camera movement was mostly ornament. The febrile perfidy of the characters who populate his films, the intricate series of romantic and sexual combinations that shift throughout them, energize his camera’s rhetorical intricacies, which in turn give his characters a sense of grace—​not only graceful, which such movements certainly are, but bestowing the grace of a passionate cinema. For Ophüls, cinema was camera movement, the opposite of the stable, eye-​ level view that conventional cinema is made of; the opposite of filmmakers who depend not on the moving camera but solely on editing to construct their narratives. The lavishness of Ophüls served as a foil for the astringency of the Kubrick style, creating tension between his big, symmetrical compositions and sweeping tracking shots. Ophüls provided an aspirational style for Kubrick, and he would create a direct homage to the director’s The Earrings of Madame de . . . (1953) in the dance sequence with Alice and the Hungarian early in Eyes Wide Shut (see Fig. 7.3).\n\nAdapting Schnitzler Kubrick needed that “spark” to push him into adaptation. Keep in mind that the only major works of fiction that Kubrick adapted were Lolita and A Clockwork Orange. The rest were relatively minor works, pulp fiction, wartime memoirs, a horror novel, or short stories in the case of 2001. Kubrick’s imagination needed a shove, something that resonated if not on the page, then with his own ways of thinking about the world cinematically, ways of thinking he might not have been aware of until sparked by something he read. Schnitzler resided in Kubrick’s imagination for years until he understood how he could adapt Traumnovelle and could absorb everything that surrounded it and its origins clearly enough to finally spark it into a film that encompassed the two worlds. Interestingly, Schnitzler himself became interested in film during his late 40s. His diary records regular visits to the cinema from 1908 onward. He was courted by many film companies and wrote many drafts of screenplays of his works that were never adapted. Siobhȧn Donovan believes that Traumnovelle is marked by Schnitzler’s love of cinema. In fact, at the time of its original publication, the novella was considered for cinematic adaptation, including a brief interest by MGM. In 1930, Schnitzler wrote a fragmentary screenplay based on Traumnovelle as part of an unrealized plan to have G. W. Pabst adapt it to a film. The screenplay ends with Fridolin’s visit to the costume shop. Schnitzler’s screenplay bore a great resemblance\n\n22\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nto his novella, just as Nabokov’s adaptation of Lolita that he made for Kubrick to film in the early 1960s strongly resembled his book. There is no available evidence that Kubrick read Schnitzler’s screenplay. Nor is it clear whether Frederic Raphael, who eventually wrote the initial scripts for Eyes Wide Shut, did either. In any case, Schnitzler’s screenplay was little known, in German, untranslated, and only a fragment of the full novella. Jan Harlan, who translated the original novella for Kubrick when they could not source the rights to the translation after optioning the rights to the novella from Fischer Verlag, says Kubrick did not see this partial screenplay. Andreas Conrad, however, suggests that Kubrick had access to it via Schnitzler’s grandson, Peter: “there is some evidence that Kubrick, in preparing his film, drew on the scenic treatment that Schnitzler himself had already made for Pabst.” As to what that “evidence” is we do not know, but Kubrick’s finished film and Schnitzler’s screenplay do share some similarities, both having an opulent ball at their respective openings. The novella was later adapted by Austrian television in a 1969 film directed by Wolfgang Glück. Again, we do not know if Kubrick saw it (although Conrad suggests he did ask to view it). Traumnovelle was later adapted for Italian television as Ad un passo dall’aurora [One Step from the Dawn] in 1989. Yet again there is no evidence that Kubrick had seen it. Letting Schnitzler linger, Kubrick’s interest turned to other Viennese writers. When The Killing wrapped in 1956, he and James B. Harris worked on adapting Zweig’s 1913 novella Burning Secret, his “sardonic Freudian account of sexual infidelity.” Originally published as Brennendes Geheimnis in 1911, it is told from the perspective of a 12-​year-​old Jewish boy whose married, upper-​middle-​class Jewish mother is the object of seduction by a suave gentile baron who befriends him in an Austrian holiday spa resort as a means of gaining access to her. Zweig describes the baron as a “Frauenjäger,” which is literally translated as “a hunter of women.” The seducer in Burning Secret might well may have stayed in Kubrick’s mind to provide the template for Victor Ziegler and Sandor Szavost in Eyes Wide Shut, characters who do not appear in Traumnovelle. Kubrick commissioned Greenwich Village novelist Calder Willingham (who would work on the screenplay for Paths of Glory) to write a script for the film. Kubrick worked on the adaptation with Willingham and, according to Harris, “it took quite some time to develop the Burning Secret script.” Together, Kubrick and Willingham set about transforming the Burning Secret novella. They had to update it from its 1911 Austrian spa setting and to transform the Germanic dialogue into something recognisably American. They also had to turn it into a filmable script. It had already been done in 1933 by Robert Siodmak, a director who Kubrick admired and whose influence can be detected in his first three films. But the Kubrick-​ Willingham screenplay bore little resemblance to that film (which Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels decried). Harris found Zweig’s story “very weak [ . . . ] it’s a one-​line joke, so to speak, and I wasn’t in favor even developing it, but Kubrick\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n23\n\nwas insistent on it. I think he had a great appreciation for Stefan Zweig.” Perhaps he was again inspired by Ophüls, who, during his time in Hollywood, had adapted Zweig’s Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948). While a script of Burning Secret was completed, it never came to fruition when MGM, the studio Kubrick was working with at the time, canceled the project. The recently rediscovered screenplay, however, provides some clues to how Kubrick would later adapt Schnitzler. It was not to be a straightforward adaptation of Burning Secret as Andrew Birkin would do in 1988. Kubrick and Willingham updated the setting, characters, and dialogue by relocating the story from a fin-​de-​ siècle spa to a place they renamed as the Bedford Forrest Hotel in the Appalachians in the American South in the mid-​1950s. The bored baron becomes a more mundane insurance salesman, Richard Hunt (his name echoes Zweig’s description of the Baron as a “hunter of women”) from Philadelphia, supported by the largesse of his elderly aunt. Edgar becomes Edward “Eddie” Harrison. His “Mama” becomes Virginia. As befitting the 1950s in Hollywood, and Kubrick’s signature practice, any trace of Jewishness is removed. Like Traumnovelle, Burning Secret and its themes of forbidden sexuality was never forgotten. Around this time, Kubrick wanted to adapt Schnitzler’s “Death of a Bachelor.” Harris discussed the story many times with Kubrick, because “that was our favorite of all the Zweig and Schnitzler and everything.” However, they never purchased the rights, possibly because its brevity made it too difficult to adapt. Kubrick subsequently commissioned Willingham to write an original story about an unfaithful wife, possibly as an alternative to Burning Secret and “Death of a Bachelor.” Nothing came of that as well. Shortly after its publication in English in 1957, Kubrick and Harris had read Lolita, a novel that bore some commonalities with Schnitzler. They were excited to adapt it. Nabokov’s novel about an older man’s obsession with a 12-​year-​old nymphet contains two episodes that have parallels in Traumnovelle. The first is Schnitzler’s description of Fridolin’s lust for “a young girl, possibly fifteen years old, with loose, blonde hair hanging over her shoulders and on one side over her delicate breast. [ . . . ] All at once, however, she smiled, smiled marvelously. Her eyes welcomed me, beckoned to me, and at the same time slightly mocked me, as she glanced at the strip of water between us. Then she stretched her young and slender body, glad of her beauty, and proudly and sweetly stirred by obvious admiration.” The second is the episode in the costume shop where Gibisier’s (Milich in the film) daughter accosts Fridolin: “a young and charming girl, still almost a child, wearing a Pierrette’s costume, wriggled out from under the table and ran along the passage to Fridolin who caught her in his arms. [ . . . ] The child pressed against Fridolin, as though sure of protection. Her little oval face was covered with powder and several beauty spots, and a fragrance of roses and powder arose from her delicate breasts. There was a smile of impish desire in her eyes.” In a late version of the Eyes Wide Shut screenplay, Milich’s daughter is described as about 14, close to the object of\n\n24\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nHumbert Humbert’s lust. In the film, as played by Leelee Sobieski, she could be the Lolita who, in the novel, was too young to pass the censors back in the early 1960s. Other events intervened. In 1957, Kubrick left Ruth Sobotka, and Los Angeles, to make Paths of Glory with Kirk Douglas in Germany. This World War I movie could not be more different from Traumnovelle, but Kubrick’s second combat film, with its dramatic tracking shots through the trenches and graceful indoor camerawork, does owe something to the influence of Ophüls. Paths of Gory is a largely homosocial film, focusing as it does on the misery of troops during World War I. But even in this milieu, repressed sexuality rears up as Col. Paris (Ralph Meeker), one of the men sentenced to face a firing squad, suddenly blurts out: “It just occurred to me . . . funny thing . . . I haven’t had one sexual thought since the court martial . . .pretty extraordinary.” The soldiers’ anger and repression are released at film’s end when a captured German singer at whom they have been wolf whistling and jeering reduces them to childlike weeping. While shooting the film, Kubrick met the woman who was to become his third and last wife. Kubrick had seen Susanne Christiane on German television and hired her over the phone for the part of the singer in Paths of Glory. The circumstances of their face-​to-​face meeting uncannily echo Fridolin’s in Traumnovelle. They met in person, Christiane recalls, at “an enormous masked ball where I was performing. He was the only one without a costume. He was quite baffled.” Kubrick’s marriage to Christiane might have very briefly diverted his thoughts from stories of marital infidelity. In 1958, through an introduction by his childhood friend Alex Singer, Kubrick approached Village Voice cartoonist Jules Feiffer as a possible collaborator on an adaptation of Traumnovelle. Kubrick had already registered the title Sick, Sick, Sick, borrowed from Feiffer’s newly published collection of comic strips, which explored characters stuck between frustrated love and desire in Greenwich Village, while also commenting on contemporary politics. Kubrick wrote to Feiffer expressing “unqualified admiration for the scenic structure of your ‘strips’ and the eminently speakable and funny dialog.” He wished to further “our contacts with an eye toward doing a film along the moods and themes you have so brilliantly accomplished.” Kubrick told Feiffer that he wanted to collaborate on a screenplay based on Traumnovelle or another Schnitzler story. “I have always been interested in doing a modern love story with backgrounds of the Ivy League, Park Avenue, and Greenwich Village,” Kubrick wrote to Feiffer, “much in the same mood and feeling as some of Arthur Schnitzlers [sic] works. Gaiety, charm, humor and excitement on the surface, concealing a fundamentally cynical and ironic sense of tragedy beneath the surface. Having spent my youth in the Village and having been on the fringe of the other two genres during my days on Look, I feel they represent the ideal chance to do something along the lines presented. The people are free (for the most part) of the drudgery of the problems of existence and can concern themselves with ‘getting kicks’ out of life. The atmospheres have charm and gaiety, as well as falseness.” “Charm and gaiety”\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n25\n\nare qualities not usually associated with Kubrick’s films, and few of his characters “get kicks” out of life—​though they might be kicked by it. Clearly at this point in his young career, the Viennese offered something brighter than the work that was occupying him at the time. Kubrick would have to dig into Schnitzler’s darkness before he could see something approaching optimism. As to Feiffer, he was invited to Los Angeles, and Harris remembers “entertaining him when I was living at the beach in Santa Monica.” Again, nothing came of those meetings. Reenter Kirk Douglas. The star of Paths of Glory, as well as producer and star of Spartacus, invited Kubrick to direct the sword-​and-​sandal epic after firing its first director, Anthony Mann. The result was wholesome, depicting the delicate, all-​but-​ chaste love between Spartacus and Varinia under the leering eyes of Batiatus and Marcellus. But even then, Kubrick managed to slip in material that focused on the debauched, libertine, all-​consuming tastes and appetites of the Romans, whether for men, women, boys, food, or wine, and included in its precensored version the homoerotic desires of Crassus toward his body slave Antoninus. Spartacus was political as well—​it could hardly help but being so given its writers. But its politics were muted beneath the spectacle of Hollywood’s ancient Rome. What is more, if Douglas is to be believed, it was he who indirectly introduced Kubrick to Traumnovelle around 1959: When we were having problems on Spartacus, I once took him with me to one of my regular appointments with Dr. Herbert Kupper, my psychiatrist. In those days, it wasn’t uncommon to use your therapy visits to help work out specific problems—​and Stanley and I had more than a few issues that could use a professional referee. I can’t tell you that it helped our working relationship—​but Dr. Kupper did make one suggestion to Stanley that had a tangible impact in his life. He recommended a book—​a 1926 German novella, Traumnovelle by Arthur Schnitzler—​that he thought would make a good movie. The relationship between Douglas and Kubrick on the set of Spartacus was indeed fraught, and in his autobiography, Douglas later referred to Kubrick as “a talented shit.” The meeting with Douglas’s psychiatrist may have been an act of desperation, the offer of Traumnovelle prescient and redundant. But then again it may have been entirely apocryphal. Yet, around May 1959, Kubrick invited Schnitzler’s grandson, Peter, to spend a day on the set of Spartacus. Kubrick and Schnitzler chatted about his grandfather’s work and Kubrick mentioned his interest in adapting some of that work into a film and acquiring “motion picture rights, etc.” Schnitzler later wrote, “I am excited at your interest in, and ideas about, my grandfather’s work and I hope that something comes of it.” He then mentions notebooks belonging to Arthur Schnitzler that he will send to Kubrick. We don’t know if these were ever sent or received.\n\n26\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nIn June 1959, Harris and Kubrick’s thoughts turned to another Schnitzler-​ and Lolita-​like novel, continuing what Ciment considered Kubrick’s “vision of love”: “deviance, non-​reciprocity, aggression, or an absence of feeling and physical rapport.” They registered with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) Nabokov’s Laughter in the Dark, a novel published in Russian as Kamera Obskura (1933), translated into English in 1935 by Winifred Roy, and then again by Nabokov himself and republished in 1961. Laughter in the Dark dealt with a similar theme as the later Lolita: an older man’s fatal obsession for a much younger girl who ends up deserting and betraying him. It revolves around an artist, Albinus, who is sexually infatuated with a teenager but ignorant of her true nature—​she is only using him for fame and his fortune. His infatuation leads to his eventual blindness (eyes wide shut?) and death. One episode, in particular, seems to have left a lasting image in Kubrick’s imagination: She had very little money left. In her distress she went to a dance hall as abandoned damsels do in films. Two Japanese gentlemen accosted her and, as she had taken more cocktails than were good for her, she agreed to spend the night with them. Next morning she demanded two hundred marks. The Japanese gentlemen gave her three fifty in small change and bustled her out . . . Those “Japanese gentlemen” would turn up having a threesome with Milich’s young daughter in Eyes Wide Shut. Although Harris remembers they bought Laughter in the Dark only as a protection for Lolita, documents in the Kubrick Archive reveal a fair amount of work on the property: there is a scene-​by-​scene treatment written by Carlo Fiore and a later treatment and script by Kubrick himself. Significantly, Kubrick’s script provided the template for Eyes Wide Shut, as Kubrick translated Nabokov’s novel from Berlin to contemporary Manhattan, as the opening of the script suggests: “Titles over shots of New York establishing end of the working day. 6 P.M. Street lights going on, people going home, etc.” Laughter in the Dark never went into production. But Schnitzler continued on Kubrick’s mind. An interview in 1960 suggests Kubrick’s ongoing interest in updating Schnitzler. He told The Observer newspaper, “I know I would like to make a film that gave a feeling of the times—​a contemporary story that really gave a feeling of the times, psychologically, sexually, politically, personally. I would like to make that much more than anything else. And it’s probably going to be the hardest film to make.” That same year, in an interview with Robert Emmett Ginna for Horizon magazine, he continued expressing his affinity for the Viennese author. Kubrick described him as “one of the most underrated authors of the twentieth century.” “This surface of gaiety and vitality, superficiality and gloss, through which you penetrate for yourself to start getting your bearings as to the true nature of people and situations.” He continued: “His plays are, to me, masterpieces\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n27\n\nof dramatic writing” and “I think he’s one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century; probably because he didn’t deal with things that are obviously full of social significance, he has been ignored. I know that, for my part, it’s difficult to find any writer who understood the human soul more truthfully, and who had a more profound insight into the way people think, act, and really are, and who also had a somewhat all-​seeing point of view—​sympathetic, if somewhat cynical.” When Ginna asked Kubrick what he would do beyond Lolita, he replied, “In recent years, unfortunately, with the exception of Arthur Schnitzler and a few other writers—​I haven’t read too much fiction” before saying, “there are a couple of stories, which I can’t mention because I haven’t bought them yet, of Arthur Schnitzler.” Kubrick briefly considered a number of other projects in a similar vein: Roger Vailland’s La Fête (1960), an autobiographical story of a libertine hunting for pleasure; Edward Adler’s Notes on a Dark Street (1961), a collection of nightmarish but life-​affirming sketches of life among the extremely poor on New York’s East Side; and Three of a Kind, an “unusually daring” and suggestive television series recounting the sexual adventures of three men and “as many [women] as leaves on the trees.” Instead, Harris and Kubrick decided to push on with their adaptation of Lolita. Production Code restrictions meant Kubrick’s treatment of sex was heavily censored through the 1950s and 1960s. Nonetheless, this did not dampen his fascination with sexuality and its discontents. In a cat-​and-​mouse game with the American and British censors who paid close attention to the script, Harris cleverly gained their cooperation. Some of Nabokov’s more salacious elements—​wife swapping, anal sex, orgies, and pornographic films—​did not quite make it into the movie, and Lolita’s age was bumped up to slightly more than nymphet status. Kubrick decided to merge the erotic into the comic and both into an uncanny ironic mode in which Humbert Humbert becomes the victim of his desires and is undone first by his vicious double, Clare Quilty, and then ultimately by Lolita’s desires for marital domesticity. Indeed, the skewed domesticity of Lolita forms some of the roots for Eyes Wide Shut. In a circularity reminiscent of Schnitzler’s Reigen (La Ronde), Charlotte Haze loves Humbert who does not love her. Humbert loves Lolita who does not love him. Lolita loves Quilty who does not love her. And Richard loves Lolita but she does not love him. Humbert, like Bill Harford, is doomed to wander fruitlessly, driven by his imagination, lusts, and frustrations, moving in circles of lust and revenge. Traumnovelle, or at least its sexual components, remained on his mind after he completed Lolita. Tom Cruise told Roger Ebert, “When he first wanted to do it [Eyes Wide Shut], it was after Lolita and Christianne [sic] told me she said, ‘Don’t . . . oh, please don’t . . . not now. We’re so young. Let’s not go through this right now.’ They were young in their marriage, and so he put it off and put it off.” Nicole Kidman adds, “Stanley was frightened of making the movie when he first read the novel years ago. Back then, his wife said, ‘Please don’t make this now at this stage of our\n\n28\n\nEyes W ide Shut\n\nmarriage’.” Exploring the darkness of marital relations was perhaps too soon to be appropriate for their young relationship. Instead, Kubrick pushed on with his proj­ ect about a nuclear holocaust. Following the completion of Dr. Strangelove, in the mid-​1960s, Kubrick was still interested in properties of a sexual nature. Around this time, he considered adapting Rosalind Erskine’s Passion Flower Hotel, a 1962 novel about some enterprising boarding school girls who sell sexual services to the neighboring boys’ school. “We talked very strongly about doing that film,” Harris remembers, “so we decided . . . maybe one more together!” But they failed to make a deal with the owner of the rights and the project never came to fruition. While working on Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick and Terry Southern, who had collaborated on the movie, discussed the possibility of a major Hollywood director making a big-​budget hardcore pornographic film with high production values. Although this never materialized, the ideas ended up in Southern’s 1970 novel Blue Movie, which Kubrick pushed him to write, and which was dedicated to “the great Stanley K.” Southern sent drafts of it to Kubrick at the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970. When Christiane read the galley proofs, she told him, “Stanley, if you do this I’ll never speak to you again.” Frederic Raphael suspects that Blue Movie was “partly behind” Eyes Wide Shut, where the dreams of a film about sexuality and its discontents would be realized. Then, from 1964 to 1968, Kubrick made 2001. In this aseptic world, where even the desexualized humans are seemingly bodies devoid of sexual organs, Kubrick inserted an astral image of sexuality as the spermatozoon-​shaped Discovery inseminates the universe. Some have even seen HAL as a jealous homosexual lover, who wishes to interfere with the camaraderie of Poole and Bowman, and whose unrequited love ends up in his dismantling. HAL can also be seen as the jealous parent who is sensitive to the superior knowledge he holds over everyone and everything in the journey to Jupiter and beyond the infinite. He is what Freud might call “polymorphous perverse.”\n\nStarts and Stops Being fascinated by Schnitzler was one thing, but actually getting the rights to the work and turning it into a script was another. There is uncertainty as to when Kubrick procured the rights to Traumnovelle. That he did own a copy in the mid-​ 1960s is certain because it is listed in an inventory of his apartment. Kubrick’s biographer LoBrutto claims Kubrick only read the novel for the first time in 1968, and only then expressed an interest in adapting it. But this must certainly have been a re-​read, because, as we’ve seen, all the evidence indicates that he was acquainted with it much earlier. But when exactly did he have the rights? One account is that, while finishing editing 2001, Kubrick asked the young Time magazine film critic\n\nKubr ick, S chnitz l e r, an d t h e L on g G e s t at ion\n\n29\n\nand screenwriter Jay Cocks to acquire the novel, as a front, in the belief that Cocks would get the rights much more cheaply than could a world-​renowned filmmaker. Cocks secured the rights, which he then sold to Kubrick, in perpetuity, for one dollar. “Stanley was using me as a beard to buy the book, so they wouldn’t stick him up,” he stated. A handwritten file card in the archives, dated May 22, 1968, appears to back up some of this claim: “Rhapsody . . . Jay Cocks’ agent says $40,000 but obviously high.” But there is an alternative version. Christiane Kubrick told Nick James of Sight and Sound that, after 2001, Kubrick was developing Traumnovelle for filming. He asked her to read it in 1968 (which would be later than the time she read it suggested by Tom Cruise) when he was looking for a new project. She recounted to Richard Schickel how she “remembers not caring greatly for it at the time, probably because she had become ‘allergic to psychiatric conversations’.” But Kubrick “took the passion for their arguments about the ‘dream story’ as evidence that material so stirring must be worth doing.” According to Kubrick’s eldest daughter, Katharina: “He obviously thought that it was a subject matter close to anyone who’s ever been in a relationship of whatever persuasion. I don’t know what his intentions were, I know that he wanted to do it for over 30 years, and that when he first found the story he decided along with my mother that they weren’t old enough or wise enough to deal with such a powerful subject matter.” Harlan says that, around Christmas 1969, Kubrick “fell in love” with the novel (was he not “in love” with it years ago?) and in 1970 he began to “concentrate” on it. In April, this version goes, he asked Harlan to acquire the rights. “In April 1970,” Harlan says, “I entered into an option-​purchase agreement with S. Fischer Verlag in Frankfurt to acquire the film rights to this novella. I entered into this contract in my name since Stanley did not want any publicity about his interest in this sexually charged story. The news might have been leaked and the press would have come up with all kinds of distracting speculations at a time when he wanted merely to think about whether this story could be turned into a screenplay.” Harlan made a rough translation of Schnitzler’s German text, and, according to Michael Herr and Tony Frewin, Kubrick subsequently bought up every copy of the 1971 reprint a couple of booksellers could find. Whoever is correct here is unknown, and, in the end, the fact of his longstanding interest in the story is what is important. It is certainly important to note that by the early 1970s, all the thinking about Traumnovelle was now being translated into the procedures necessary to turn it into a film. At the exact same time, Kubrick was also actively pursuing his Napoleon project. Recall that, in 1970, he had told Gelmis that one of the things that attracted him to Napoleon was that his sex life was worthy of Schnitzler. So, even while concentrating on 18th-​and "
