        "text": "Hungarian Jewish surnames are those used by Jews from Hungary, and the neighboring regions under Hungarian influence, like Transylvania and Vojvodina, as well as diasporic communities in the USA, the UK, Argentina, and Israel. The earliest reports of Jewish presence in Hungarian lands predate the Hungarian conquest of the Pannonian Basin in 895 CE by over 600 years.\n\nIn addition to the organized Jewish communities in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, it is believed that a number of the heterogeneous Hungarian tribes practiced Judaism. From the 1800s until World War II, Hungarian Jews became increasingly assimilated, becoming the Jewish community with the largest number of people ascending to nobility. The first lower nobility titles were granted in 1849, and the first Baron title was given in 1886 to Zsigmond Schossberger, who was made Baron Schossberger von Tornyai.[1][2]\n\nMost Hungarian Jews did not have family names before 1783. However, a few surnames were recorded for Jewish families as time passed by, such as:\n\nDue to the more restrictive anti-Jewish policies in other parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, as well as the economic development of Hungary, many Jews from other parts of the empire migrated into Hungarian lands in the early 1800s, bringing a significant amount of non-Hungarian-speaking migrants wishing to succeed in the Kingdom. Partially as a response to this influx of foreigners, as well as following the establishment of ethnic minority rights based on individuals, between 1840 and 1849, the first wave of Magyarization of surnames for non-Hungarians took place.\n\nAfter the Hungarian Revolution in 1848, this process was stopped until the establishment of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, when many more Jews changed their family names from German to Hungarian, a process that occurred both voluntarily and as a result of social pressure since Hungarian was the only language allowed to be used in civil administration, legal proceedings, and higher education. As most Jews were urban in Hungary, a majority of the middle-class Jews changed their surnames to more Hungarian-sounding ones and started to use only Hungarian as a medium of communication in search of social mobility.[3]\n\nSome Jews with German-sounding and Yiddish-sounding names translated them directly into Hungarian. For example, Gross became Nagy, Lieberman became Lelkes, and Wolf became Farkas. Others simply made new versions of their original surnames into Hungarian forms, like Vázsonyi (Weiszfeld), Krón (Krön), Vámbéry (Bamberger), Rudas (Roth, Reichenthal), and Kovács (Kohn). A minority, usually the most religious ones, retained their original surnames, adapting them to the Hungarian language spelling rules, like Szmelzer, Herczel, Megyer, Szamuely, and Weisz.[4][5] It is estimated that between 1894 and 1918 only, nearly 60% of the surname changes we requested by Jews.[6]\n\nOne interesting fact is that the two most devoted promoters of Magyarization, Simon Telkes and Zoltán Lengyel, who established non-governmental organizations and wrote extensively about the benefits of Magyarization, were themselves, Jews.[7]\n\nIn the Hungarian language, names are given similarly to those given in East Asia: the surname follows the given name. As with the rest of the Hungarians, under the reign of Joseph II, it became mandatory to have a surname, with women keeping their surnames and children inheriting their father's surname only. Later, after the establishment of Austria-Hungary, women became known by their husbands' full names, by adding the -né suffix. During the Communist rule of Hungary, women could either choose to keep their maiden name or take their husband's surname. Nowadays, this is also possible for men, as well as creating a new surname by hyphenating both surnames or the traditional option in which the wife takes her husband's full name.[8]"
