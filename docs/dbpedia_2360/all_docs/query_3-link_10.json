        "text": "Toth History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nThe Toth surname is thought to be independently derived from the Middle High German words \"toto,\" meaning \"death,\" or \"tote,\" meaning \"godfather.\" In either instance, the name was probably a nickname, which later became a hereditary surname.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Toth family\n\nThe surname Toth was first found in Germany, where the name Toth came from humble beginnings but gained a significant reputation for its contribution to the emerging mediaeval society. It later became more prominent as numerous branches of the same house acquired distant estates, some of which were located in other countries, most notably in Sweden.
