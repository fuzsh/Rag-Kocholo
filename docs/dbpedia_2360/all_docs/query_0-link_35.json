Mentor Walks can make those connections happen where they bring together career-driven women like you with accomplished female mentors eager to share their knowledge and experiences. Whether you're joining for the first time or returning for more, each walk offers a chance to gain new insights and expand your network. Register for 5th September (Thursday) walk here: https://lnkd.in/gU-udAN6 What's in it for you? ✅ Insights from CEOs, directors, and industry trailblazers ✅ Practical tips for tackling career challenges ✅ Fresh perspectives to spark your professional growth ---------------------------- Criteria for Mentors: Mentor Walks mentors are very senior women from diverse professional and personal backgrounds who want to help women succeed. They are CEOs, VPs, directors, entrepreneurs and leaders in their fields, and generally have 20+ years senior experience in these key roles, managing people and leading teams. The program is high impact, low commitment. Walks start at 7:00am and finish at 8:30am and happen six times a year. The minimum commitment is to mentor at least once a year, if you can make more dates then even better, we make it as easy as possible for mentors to volunteer their time. If you are interested please email : dubai@mentorwalks.org How does it work? Mentees apply to come to a walk with an issue or topic they wish to discuss and we match them with the mentor best suited to help them at that walk. As a mentor, you will have up to three mentees in your group and you collectively discuss the issues as you walk. Importantly, there is no prep before each walk needed, no obligation for mentors to have ongoing contact with mentees after the walk and it's not time intensive; allowing you to turn up on the morning, be welcomed and matched by the Dubai local team, then exercise while mentoring the next generation of female leaders in the UAE! Sign up to be a mentor, or mentee! I hope to see you September 5th! #down2bizlucychow #changingthegame_lucychow #changingthegame_future #mentors #mentees #careeradvice #careerdevelopment #uae #dubai\n\nA unique career opportunity!
