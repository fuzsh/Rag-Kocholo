Comics studies is one such field, a fast-­growing area of scholarship at the intersection of many academic disciplines (and confined to no single one). The growth of comics studies in the twenty-­first century has been explosive, so much so that scholars and students of the form can hardly keep up. That, we believe, bodes well for the field, but is also the impetus for this book. A number of ambitious books have sought to cover comics studies in a single bound, yet it remains difficult to map this vast and spreading field. From our perspective, it has seemed that students in comics studies still lack a dependable text that succinctly identifies the field’s core issues and debates, a compact volume that can serve as a first stop, critical sourcebook, and study guide. This book aims to be just that: an overview of comics studies that sketches the contours of the field and spotlights core critical issues. Of course, it is impossible to do justice to comics studies in one volume, but this book, composed of seventeen original essays commissioned from leading scholars, offers to show the lay of the land—­or rather, one set of strategies for mapping it. We hope you find this book an engaging, provocative, and useful guide. Consider this volume, then, a timely dispatch from a dynamic, unruly project shared (and its very terms contested) by a great many scholars. Comics studies is not the most conventional and respectable of fields in academia, and the terms of its acceptance remain in dispute.1 Certainly, the liveliness of comics has not been corralled into a settled, predictable discipline. Comics may\n\n1\n\n2 • Bart Beaty and Charles Hatfield\n\nremain, as Scott Bukatman has it, a happy “monster” that works the margins and interstices of culture: impure, hybrid, and hard to place, “a threat to established order and orderliness.”2 The very idea of a singular academic guidebook to comics studies may seem crazy. Yet clearly comics studies does need maps and guides—­it is that busy. The vitality of comics studies reflects the fact that comics itself, as a communicative medium and art form, has gained new ground and, indeed, undergone a drastic change in status within our culture. This book is an attempt to catch up. While in America the disposable comic strip and comic book are no longer inescapable parts of everyday life—­that is, comics no longer reach into the daily routines of millions—­the cultural impact of comics has never registered more strongly among scholars than it does today. Indeed, the art form has attained greater critical if not economic clout than ever before. Even as comic books inspire world-­spanning Hollywood blockbusters, introspective graphic books (novels, memoirs, histories) are making the best-­seller charts and critical “best of ” lists. Graphic novels have become a staple, even a pillar, of children’s publishing, overcoming decades of mistrust and disregard. Translated Japanese manga, familiar to so many readers raised on visually saturated media, constitute a robust literary form. Webcomics, with us now for well over twenty years, are likewise a thriving culture. Hence comics remain embedded in the cultural vernacular. At the same time, a new generation of curators has rushed to exhibit comics art in museums and galleries, and new forms of comics criticism have emerged. In fact, comics have never been studied more intensively than now. This young century has seen comics win major literary prizes, shape the image-­making practices of filmmakers and game designers, and inspire a burst of scholarly publications, both journals and books. Comics scholarship is booming, as confirmed by the launch in 2014 of the Comics Studies Society, the United States’ first professional association for comics researchers and teachers. Comics teaching in higher education has surged: courses on comics have sprouted everywhere from community colleges to public universities to Ivy League institutions. The academic landscape in North America is dotted with comics classes, and more and more schools are responding to the high demand for them. Comics studies degree programs and concentrations have begun to appear, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, there are many comics-­ based studio programs within art schools, some new and some older, that are training new generations of creators. As part of the first generation of academics to stake our careers on comics scholarship, we have witnessed this explosion gratefully and with awe.3 Our Guidebook attempts to make sense of it all in terms that will help up-­and-­ coming scholars in the field. For practical reasons, we have centered this book on (broadly speaking) Anglophone comic strips, comic books, and graphic novels, yet we seek to situate those genres within the greater context of world comics.\n\nIntroduction • 3\n\nThat is, while our Guidebook highlights trends in comics that have had a very noticeable impact in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, it also takes an international view, tapping scholarly resources in other languages, acknowledging influences from Japanese and European traditions, and reflecting on the global circulation of comics culture. The result, we believe, will help students of comics gain much-­needed perspective on the development of the form—­indeed, a satellite view of comics studies as a vibrant and emerging field. We use the satellite metaphor advisedly, to signal our interest in the entire comics world yet also to remind ourselves of the hazards of cultural imperialism. To speak or write of “world comics” invites charges of imperial overreach; after all, the Western label “comics” should not be the measure of sequential art and graphic narrative traditions worldwide. Anglophone comics traditions do not map neatly onto, for instance, Japanese manga traditions, as Frenchy Lunning shows in chapter 5 of this volume, or even other Western traditions such as that of Francophone bande dessinée. Nor do the many other histories of comics from around the world align easily with each other—­and again, even to call them histories of comics, when other terms and concepts may take precedence in their cultures of origin, perhaps seems like a form of colonization. To be sure, the lianhuanhua of China, the manhwa of Korea, and the historietas of Mexico or Argentina (to name but a few examples) are not interchangeable with, or simply adjuncts of, Anglophone comics from the United States, Canada, or the United Kingdom. To posit them all as aspects of a single object of study may flatten out important differences. While certain comics cultures—­take for instance Japanese manga, Franco-­ Belgian BD, and U.S. comics—­have been exported widely and influenced the comics of other cultures, this does not mean that they are the only templates necessary for understanding how comics are made worldwide. Even what we have called “Anglophone comics” is a cluster of traditions rather than a single one, a complex field in which multiple national histories overlap and sometimes compete. Consider, for instance, the differences between U.S.-­style comic books and the British tradition of comic weeklies. Australian artist-­scholar Pat Grant, who was raised in a remote coastal town in New South Wales, describes his sense of distance from “the Anglophone comics tradition” in an essay included in his graphic novel Blue (2012): “Someone like me ought to take the dominant history of comics well salted.” Grant reflects, “I grew up with other things,” and notes that his own “local comics tradition” does not “intersect with the grand narratives” of comics history in any obvious way.4 Yes, he knows those grand narratives—­his essay, dotted with famous American names, shows as much—­but they don’t speak to either his own history or his sense of the current possibilities of comics. We take Grant’s point: there is always a risk that rehashing the grand narratives will hide other riches, that too great an emphasis on the famous and oft-­exported will blind us to local scenes and to a larger, fuller world, one of diverse narrative art traditions.\n\n4 • Bart Beaty and Charles Hatfield\n\nWe should admit up front that this Guidebook repeats certain grand narratives that seem important to grounding our sense of Anglophone comics. Yet our contributors have also brought new conceptual frameworks that can help boost understanding and appreciation of works from around the world. We do believe that there is such a thing as world comics, or international comics, insofar as lines of influence among comics creators and industries increasingly overstep national boundaries. Many comics artists are aware of and draw inspiration from major figures in world comics, and translations play an important part in the reading lives of many comics readers. Whatever terms we use to denote the form—­comics, BD, manga, or others—­we know that many dedicated readers affirm the continuity of graphic storytelling across cultures and seek out graphic narratives in diverse traditions and styles. Comics, then, is a recognizable art form across borders.5 Further, the idea that any one culture “invented” comics is a canard that we can do without. Influence moves in every direction: for example, to understand American comic books, graphic novels, and webcomics in the twenty-­first century, it helps to know about the influence of Japanese manga and anime; conversely, to understand the development of twentieth-­century manga, it helps to know about the influence of early American comic strips and animated cartoons. Calling all these phenomena “comics” is, for us, a convenient way of tagging a multifaceted global art form, one that is never cordoned off from other influences but draws inspiration from myriad centers of culture (just as other cultural forms draw from comics). We see the idea of world comics as a pathway to cross-­cultural understanding, not an inducement to search all over the world for the same few, familiar things. May this Guidebook, in part through its very limitations, spur further efforts at mapping, countermapping, and (re)framing. To assist readers in mapping out the comics studies world, this Guidebook is divided into four sections focusing on, respectively, “Histories,” “Cultures,” “Forms,” and “Genres.” The first of these is the most extensive and yet still would benefit from an even greater number of essays, for the history of comics around the globe is fascinating and multivaried. Ian Gordon, whose 1998 book, Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890–­1945, remains an essential academic volume on the history of the early American strip, here offers an overview of the development of the comic strip publishing format from the nineteenth through the twenty-­first centuries. Rooting his discussion in the way that comic strips circulate not only in newspapers but, more importantly, in the culture of a nation, Gordon persuasively demonstrates the important ways that comic strips helped shaped twentieth-­century mass media. Gordon’s chapter is followed by that of Charles Hatfield, who maps the development of that particularly American publishing format, the “comic book,” from the 1930s through to the present day. Hatfield discusses the commercial and artistic influences that shaped the development of the comic book as a sentimental object whose contributions to the public imagination have been both celebrated and challenged. In\n\nIntroduction • 5\n\nhis contribution here, Roger Sabin—­whose 1993 volume, Adult Comics: An Introduction, was one of the earliest peer-­refereed books in the field—­looks at the important comic book subgenres of underground and alternative comix. Defining themselves as starkly distinct from the mass-­market material of their day, these works brought countercultural values and new aesthetic norms to the field. Sabin cannily locates this ferment in its historical period and considers the movement in all of its transnational complexity. Following Sabin, Bart Beaty has assumed the frankly impossible task of writing about the entire comics culture of Europe, a subject that merits (at least) another volume of this size. Beaty finds connections across this heterogeneous field marked by linguistic and cultural differences, suggesting that it can be best understood through a series of oppositions that that are common throughout many national comics traditions—­children/adult, mass market / niche market. Similarly, Frenchy Lunning, the longtime editor of Mechademia (the pioneering English-­language journal dedicated to the study of Japanese comics, animation, and popular culture), provides insights into the historical trajectory of comics in Japan. Tracing the development of manga over the course of centuries, Lunning complicates our understanding of comics as a particularly modern form of communication while also problematizing the historian’s quest for definitive “origins.” Finally, we conclude our foray into history with Isaac Cates’s consideration of the development of the “graphic novel,” which in the twenty-­first century has come to be regarded as an important publishing category and, for many readers—­and indeed scholars—­a cultural object distinct from “comics” (a somewhat contentious claim). Cates elegantly sorts through the origins of the graphic novel as an idea—­and an ideal—­showing how this publishing format, or rather movement, has worked to construct a shared set of assumptions about the possibilities inherent in the comics form among successive generations of comics creators. Part 2, “Cultures,” opens the floor to the consideration of four of the most consistently engaging debates in current comics studies; these are the big questions to which our field returns again and again. Matthew P. McAllister and Brian MacAuley lead off with a consideration of comics as a form of cultural industry. For much of the twentieth century, comics were an art form that earned relatively little respect from institutional tastemakers like museums and universities. Their historic association with mass culture and their inexpensive and sometimes shoddy nature militated against the idea that comics might be “art”; they were clearly “business.” McAllister and MacAuley do not challenge that conclusion but rather tease out the ramifications of comics as a specific cultural industry, or industries, with its own unusual arrangements in terms of production, distribution, and licensing. If comics is a business, then it must also have its customers, and this is the subject of Benjamin Woo’s chapter on audiences and fans. Woo, the author of Getting a Life: The Social Worlds of Geek Culture (2018), draws on the rapidly growing literature on the sociology of fandom to demonstrate how comics readers have interacted with the field\n\n6 • Bart Beaty and Charles Hatfield\n\nas hobbyists, collectors, commentators, and creators. Woo complicates the commonplace mental image of the comic book fan as a nerdy introvert, extends the notion of audience beyond fandom and highlights the complex ways that readers shape the comics industry rather than merely allowing themselves to be shaped by it. In the succeeding chapter, Philip Nel, whose publications include Was the Cat in the Hat Black? (2017) and collections of Crockett Johnson’s beloved strip Barnaby (1942–­1952), considers one of the most important of comics’ audiences: children. Specifically, Nel explains how comics developed a sense of children as their key audience, and how they have communicated to children over time. For Nel, the space between comics and children’s literature is a narrow one, and he guides readers to understand the way these two fields, often considered to be distinct, mutually reinforce the way that we understand young people and their use of media. Finally, Theresa Tensuan takes on one of the most pressing questions in contemporary comics scholarship, the representation and structuring of difference. Beginning with the work of cartoonist Lynda Barry and concluding with a close reading of Carla Speed McNeil’s Finder: Voice (2011), Tensuan considers the way that comics, an art form historically rooted in visual stereotypes, has worked to inspire reflection upon ethnoracial, gender-­based, and other types of difference. While this too is a topic much too vast to be contained by a single chapter, Tensuan provocatively opens an entryway to urgent areas of scholarship and debate. Our third section, “Forms,” offers three essays on distinctive formal and aesthetic qualities of comics. Every art form has its unique formal affordances or features and each its own history and rules. In literature, we might think of the formal constraints that define a sonnet; in cinema, the rules of continuity editing. Comics, too, have formal qualities not commonly appreciated by scholars working in adjacent fields, and these essays invite reflection on how these qualities may shape meaning-­making. First, Andrei Molotiu explores the art of cartooning: the practice of narrative drawing that has been central to most comics. An art historian and comics artist, Molotiu considers cartooning from various perspectives, moving from theories of cartooning as they have been developed over time to considerations of “cartoonism” as an aesthetic preference (or even bias) and then to cartooning as a form of acting. In comics art, the hand of the artist is usually presumed to be visible to readers through the material traces of pen and brush on paper—­and that stylized handiwork, cartooning, is at the heart of aesthetic debates about the comics form. Next, Martha Kuhlman examines the place of design in comics, shifting from drawing to the totality of the page and thence to the entirety of books. Kuhlman highlights the important ways that sequence structures our reading of comics and revisits many of the core debates in the formal evaluation of comics as they have developed since (at least) the 1960s, providing a point of entry to the overlooked complexities of the comics form. Finally, Jan Baetens asks us to consider the complications that arise in\n\nIntroduction • 7\n\nan art form that relies heavily on both image and text. Baetens reminds us that since the Enlightenment, logocentrism and iconoclasm have tended to privilege the written word over the drawn image, a fact that has tended to diminish the status of comics. Demonstrating that this need not be so, Baetens considers the conflicts and correspondences that arise in comics’ mixing of word and image: complexities that challenge us to set aside preconceptions about what comics can and cannot do. Our final section, “Genres,” considers four of the most important types or subfields of comics as they have developed over time. Central among these in U.S. comic books is the genre of the superhero, a type of character that arose in the nascent comic book industry of the 1930s and has since come to dominate mass culture via film, television, and video games. Marc Singer is our guide here, tracing the history of the superhero from its initial frenzy of interest just before and during the Second World War, through a fallow postwar period, and then to periods of not only renewed interest but increasing narrative and psychological sophistication. Through the course of his chapter, Singer demonstrates the way that the superhero has proven to be a flexible vehicle for creators working in the genre. Gillian Whitlock provides a strong contrast in the next chapter, focused on autographics, or comics and graphic texts with autobiographical foundations. Autographics has, in important ways, become a hallmark of contemporary comics studies, opening pathways in the larger academy by connecting the field to other ongoing debates. Whitlock’s chapter addresses some of the most influential works in the genre, including Art Spiegelman’s Maus (1986 and 1991) and Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home (2006), both prestigious award winners and frequent classroom texts. The critical acclaim afforded these and other works of graphic memoir helped expand the scope of comics study and promote the idea that comics might be taken seriously by literary scholars. Whitlock, however, poses more expansive questions about these texts, interrogating the way that they depict individual subjectivity and memory while challenging notions of representation. Mel Gibson takes up a related subject in her consideration of comics for girls and women, specifically developments in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Rejecting the idea that comics is, or has been, a predominantly masculinist field, Gibson turns a critical eye toward girls’ comics, romance comics, and explicitly feminist comix to discuss the ways that their creators and readers carved out unique spaces in the field. In the following chapter, Darren Wershler, Kalervo Sinervo, and Shannon Tien address one of the most vital developments in comics studies, the rise of digital comics. The authors here are not interested in just webcomics, though webcomics are central to their argument; they also focus on the way that traditional comic books and strips have gradually migrated to digital forms of creation and distribution. Today online delivery systems—­whether through web platforms or apps for mobile devices (such as smart phones and tablets)—­are\n\n8 • Bart Beaty and Charles Hatfield\n\ntaking on an ever more important role in the way that comics are consumed. This chapter traces the history of comics’ shift toward the digital world through all its remarkable fits and starts. We close the Guidebook with a time line of selected events from the early eighteenth to the twenty-­first century: a chronology that is by no means complete but serves to contextualize many events, titles, and creators discussed in this book while providing other landmarks and a more comprehensive view of comics’ development. Partial and selective as it is, this time line offers a braided set of paths through a complex global phenomenon. The present volume does not claim to be a comprehensive overview of comics studies as it exists today; as noted, the field is a vast, unruly enterprise that refuses to be charted so easily, and every day we receive reminders of just how fast it has been moving and changing. Yet we hope this constellation of essays will serve as a concise and helpful introduction to the major concerns that animate discussions in the field. Though comics studies is relatively young, the essays collected here highlight the steps generations of scholars have already taken toward addressing some of the field’s most pressing concerns. If not brand-­new, comics scholarship remains a lively, promising, fast-­growing area of interdisciplinary study. This Guidebook offers multiple points of entry: a kind of map, with contours broadly sketched, but also an invitation.\n\nNotes 1 See, for example, Bart Beaty and Benjamin Woo, The Greatest Comic Book of All Time: Symbolic Capital and the Field of American Comic Books (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016); and Christopher Pizzino, Arresting Development: Comics at the Boundaries of Literature (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2016). An overview of the contrasting positions offered by these volumes is provided in a review essay by Matthew Levay, The Journal of Modern Periodical Studies 10, nos. 1–­2 (2019). 2 Scott Bukatman, Hellboy’s World: Comics and Monsters on the Margins (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2016), 208. 3 Regarding the roots of comics scholarship as an academic field, see, for example, Matthew J. Smith and Randy Duncan, eds., The Secret Origins of Comics Studies (New York: Routledge, 2017); and “Pioneers of Comic Art Scholarship,” an occasional series of autobiographical essays edited by John A. Lent for the International Journal of Comic Art. See, in particular, IJOCA 5, no. 1 (Spring 2003) and no. 2 (Fall 2003); and IJOCA 7, no. 2 (Fall 2005). 4 Pat Grant, Blue (Marietta, Ga.: Top Shelf Productions, 2012), n.p. 5 The coinage world comics obviously echoes the prevailing but contested concept of world literature, one often criticized for its normalization of global relations of power and its assumptions about translatability and universal appeal. See, for example, Wail Hassan, “World Literature in the Age of Globalization: Reflections on an Anthology,” College English 63, no. 1 (2000); Kate McInturff, “The Uses and Abuses of World Literature,” Journal of American Culture 26, no. 2 ( June 2003); and Emily Apter, Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability (London: Verso, 2013). That said, the concept of world comics is gaining ground. See, for example,\n\nIntroduction • 9\n\nBill Kartalopoulos, ed., “International Comics,” special section, World Literature Today 90, no. 2 (March–­April 2016): 37–­75. Kartalopoulos spotlights “artists from all over the world who are pushing the boundaries of what comics can be [and] finding one another and publishing their work together in international anthologies,” thus constituting or strengthening “an international comics avant-­garde” distinct from the mainstream traditions of their respective countries (39). In a comparable vein, Frederick Luis Aldama’s promised book World Comics: The Basics (forthcoming), while acknowledging differences among comics traditions, envisions a “world republic of comics” in which influence propagates across borders. Aldama also curates a website titled the Planetary Republic of Comics (https://​professorlatinx​.com/​ planetary​-republic​-of​-comics), which asserts that the history of comics “is a global one. Comic book creators from around the world are grown within their respective national soils but always with an insatiable appetite to learn from others beyond their proximate experience.” See, in addition, Shane Denson, Christina Meyer, and Daniel Stein, eds., Transnational Perspectives on Graphic Narratives (New York: Bloomsbury, 2013), which examines how comics “have been shaped by aesthetic, social, political, economic, and cultural interactions that reach across national boundaries in an interconnected and globalizing world” (1). A related Summer School in Transnational Graphic Narratives was held at the University of Siegen in the summer of 2017. Since 1999, the International Journal of Comic Art (edited and published by John A. Lent) has argued by its very existence for the importance of thinking about comics and cartooning globally. Pragmatically speaking, of course, this remains a challenge, especially in terms of pedagogy (as is reflected in the limitations of this very book). At the 2019 Comics Studies Society conference in Toronto, Nina Mickwitz provocatively questioned “The Politics of Espousing a Global Comics Studies”—­a talk that called for the decolonialization of the field and sparked much discussion, both during the conference and after.\n\nPart I\n\nHistories\n\n1\n\nComic Strips IAN GORDON Comic strips belong to the larger continuum of comics art: from single-­panel cartoons to broadsheets and comics magazines and papers to albums and graphic novels to webcomics and more. There is no distinct aesthetic that isolates the comic strip from these other forms. Strips may be best described as a particular form of comics that appears regularly, usually daily or weekly, and tends to tell stories or gags in a short series of sequential panels. Typically strips convey speech via balloons and feature a continuing cast of characters; however, what constitutes a comic is a fluid mix of visual, textual, and panel arrangements, and it is possible to omit one or two of the common elements and yet still have a comic strip. Placing strips on the broader continuum of comics art may finesse this problem by allowing a certain looseness of definition (while still, of course, eliding the issue of just what constitutes comics art). Given the difficulty of defining just what makes something a comic strip, it is better to move away from definitions based purely on formal properties and think instead in terms of political economy. Indeed, defining comic strips as appearing regularly and with continuing characters is already one step in that direction. Approaching strips through their political economy makes sense because this sort of comics art owes its development to a specific set of historical circumstances. Akin to Michael Newman’s comments on the indie film, comic strips cohere as a category not only through “a set of industrial criteria or formal or stylistic conventions” but more importantly as “a cluster of interpretative\n\n13\n\n14 • Ian Gordon\n\nstrategies and expectations.”1 In the case of comic strips, these expectations and habits were formed under rapidly changing conditions; in Britain and the United States, strips developed out of earlier forms of comics at a time of great social change. For instance, both London and New York experienced rapid population growth between 1850 and 1900: London more than doubled in size, while New York increased sixfold. The accompanying development of newer and cheaper printing technologies ushered in new types of magazines and newspapers that reached much larger audiences than had prior publications. Comics played an important role in attracting and retaining this new audience. The creation of railway transportation networks also contributed to the development of comics, and the different types of spatial relations in which this happened arguably led to distinct sorts of strips. In Britain, for instance, the relatively smaller distances were quickly spanned, and so the press took on more of a national character than in America, where greater geographic distances meant that cities, though now linked in an emerging national market, still retained a more localized press.2 In the United Kingdom, the development of Board Schools between 1870 and 1902 increased literacy rates. Meanwhile, the United States, which began moving toward a public school system as early as 1830, had a very high literacy rate by the 1890s, with over seventy-­five percent of the population in the densely inhabited northeastern states able to read.3 In Britain, Alfred Harmsworth, better known by his later title as Lord Northcliffe, understood these changes in literacy and developed a line of publications that included Comic Cuts—­and, later, the array of newspapers that earned him his title—­to appeal to this newly empowered readership.4 Comic strips then were present at the birth of a community of new readers imagining new senses of themselves and the body politic to which they belonged. As the historian Eugene Weber has noted, in France, this process of spreading a national culture through print transported by railways was somewhat delayed, for it was only after the First World War that newspapers like Petit Journal, with its illustrated supplement, began to circulate more broadly through the country.5\n\nFrom Töpffer to Ally Sloper The association between the bustling unfolding of economic modernity and the sort of regulation it required—­trains, for instance, need organization, such as in timetables; indeed, it was the railroads that established the time zones in the United States—­is what shaped the career of the pioneering comics artist Rodolphe Töpffer, according to comics historian Thierry Smolderen. Töpffer is widely regarded as the father of comics art because of his series of comic albums that developed many of the techniques familiar to modern readers of comic strips and comic books. Smolderen argues that Töpffer deliberately used sequential panels and diagrammatic representations in order to tie the form of his satire to the very object of his ridicule: the sort of “generalized formatting”\n\nComic Strips • 15\n\ncontained “in works on theatrical gestures, manuals on manners, and technical encyclopedias.”6 This sort of reduction of difference to standardization was part and parcel of the coming age, as handmade artisanal craft gave way to industrial production.7 Ironically, in the format of his satire Töpffer invented something perfectly suited to the broad object of that satire. Smolderen considers the satirical impulse of comics artists the saving grace of the form, while pointing out that once strips were introduced to newspapers, comics “turned decisively against their creator[s] . . . [and] contributed to the rhythms and the routines of the urban and industrial world.”8 If Töpffer shaped the emerging form of comics, the work he produced was nonetheless not comic strips (in the familiar sense) but rather self-­contained comic albums. Smolderen identifies the appearance of this sort of material in newspapers as the moment that the form took on a particular characteristic somewhat contrary to the vision of Töpffer. To be sure, newspapers were important, but before comic strips arrived on the newspaper page, one comic showed the way that this art fit the emerging urban and industrial world. The character Ally Sloper, as Roger Sabin has shown, appeared in various British publications beginning with Judy in 1867, and his adventures were almost certainly the first significant comic strip. By 1884, Sloper appeared in the eponymous Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday—­his own comic weekly, which, as Sabin shows, depended on aggressive cross-­marketing promotion. The art was comic strip–­like, the character continuing and promoted through an array of products.9 The fact that Sloper appeared in a weekly rather than a daily newspaper reflects the different lines of development of newspapers in Britain and in the States. Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday was certainly circulated on a mass basis, selling up to 340,000 copies a week by one account.10 Moreover, the character appeared across media. While a comic strip can be a strip without spawning a character that moves beyond print, the key early strip characters, those that shaped the form, almost all had more than a print incarnation. Sloper, through a variety of merchandise, reached beyond print into the daily lives of his audience. As Sabin points out, the character demonstrates Martin Barker’s notion of a contract between reader and text, a contract that, in Barker’s words, entails “an agreement that a text will talk to us in ways we recognise. It will enter into a dialogue with us. And that dialogue, with its dependable elements and form, will relate to some aspect of our lives in our society.”11 With Sloper, this sort of contract with the reader expanded beyond the confines of the printed text to include reprints of the Judy strip, a relish sauce, cigars, liver pills, bicycles, ties, and musical instruments. We know Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday was meant for rail commuters because—­and this is somewhat grim humor—­promotional advertisements offered a reward to victims of rail accidents if a copy of the latest issue of the comic was found on the deceased—­the contract with readers almost extended to an insurance policy, the premium being regular purchase of the comic!\n\n16 • Ian Gordon\n\nSabin describes this as Sloper “transcending his role as a vehicle for humour and becoming associated with, in particular, the rise of leisure consumerism.” Sloper appealed to an emerging lower middle class who came into being because of the very changes that produced comics; the growing industrialization of society that inspired Töpffer’s satire also enabled the production and distribution of comics on a large scale. As Sabin explains, “Sloper was developing as a ‘brand,’ and as ever the cultural role of brands was to respond to the zeitgeist.”12 I would suggest, however, that Sloper did not so much “transcend” his role as intimately tie different roles together in ways that not only were mutually reinforcing but indeed laid down a template for an emerging culture of consumption. Sabin’s ambivalent use of “brand” indicates uncertainty regarding whether we should view comic strips as defined by their political economy rather than, or as much as, their formal properties. Ally Sloper was a comic strip, but either it was so much more—­a brand—­or the nature of the comic strip at this time was such that the comic was more than what appeared on the printed page. A comparison with the American comic Hogan’s Alley—­home of the “Yellow Kid” and often erroneously called the first comic strip ever—­supports the latter contention.\n\nThe Yellow Kid Touted as the first comic strip by many comics fans and scholars (Americans in particular), Richard F. Outcault’s Hogan’s Alley was no such thing. Before Ally Sloper, and even before Töpffer created his works, the short-­lived Glasgow Looking Glass, first published on June 11, 1825, had carried a series of sequential narrative illustrations spread over several issues that would meet a formalistic definition of a comic strip.13 But this comic floundered for lack of a sufficient audience. Likewise, distinctive comic figures such as Thomas Rowlandson and William Combe’s Dr. Syntax had been widely popular and given rise to numerous associated products. What made the “Yellow Kid” comics the first strip in so many people’s view was the distinctive character and its regular appearance in a newspaper—­qualities more to do with the political economy of the feature than its formal properties. The Yellow Kid first appeared in protean form in a panel cartoon within the illustrated humor journal Truth on April 15, 1893, and then again more clearly, though not yet fully formed, on June 2, 1894, under the heading “Feudal Pride in Hogan’s Alley.” By the time of his third appearance, again in Truth, on February 9, 1895, the Kid was clearly recognizable as the character that would go on to appear in the New York World and then the New York Journal. But even in the Kid’s first colored appearance in the New York World (May 5, 1895), under the title “At the Circus in Hogan’s Alley,” his distinctive nightshirt that was later to give him his name was not yet yellow. Indeed, Outcault did not ever refer to the Kid as the Yellow Kid during the feature’s run at the World. Moreover, for the duration of its run at the World\n\nComic Strips • 17\n\nthe comic was a single panel—­or page rather, typically filled to bursting with typeset text as well as a giant comic illustration. Nor did word balloons, another supposed hallmark of comic strips, appear very much. How the Yellow Kid became a comic strip, then, is no simple tale of author’s intention and the invention of a form. On January 5, 1896, the Kid appeared in the World with his nightshirt colored yellow. Thereafter he became known as the Yellow Kid. Outcault himself did not use the term until much later that year. Again here, much as Sabin argues for Ally Sloper, a contract existed with the reading audience, and in the Kid’s case, it was they who named the character. Even with a name, though, the Yellow Kid was still not a comic strip, at least in the conventional sense of appearing regularly in panels. Unlike Ally Sloper, who made scheduled appearances, the Yellow Kid appeared on a haphazard basis—­at best every other week in the Sunday supplement of the World—­up until June 1896. After that, Outcault produced a comic every week (until he left the World for Hearst’s New York Journal in October 1896), and only because something forced his hand: a May 31, 1896, Hogan’s Alley comic in the World drawn by George Luks that was almost identical in style to Outcault’s.14 Once more, the regular production of a comic, a typical feature of comic strips, came about for other than a strictly artistic reason: Outcault needed to assert his ownership of the feature and the character against the newspaper and Luks. Outcault’s subsequent actions in trying to copyright the Yellow Kid, and, failing that, then moving the Yellow Kid under that name to Hearst’s paper—­all defined comic strips as much as did questions of form.15 Moreover, the Yellow Kid, like Sloper, was the subject of reproduction in goods like cigars, dolls, and chewing gum. Here again, the comic strip was something more than what appeared on the page.\n\nThe Question of Word Balloons Word balloons have traditionally been seen as an essential feature of comic strips, and they are indeed important to many comics, though not all.16 Outcault hardly used balloons in the Yellow Kid comics, and it was not until another artist’s innovation late in 1900 that balloons truly became a regular feature of the Sunday funny pages. Frederick Burr Opper deserves credit for reshaping American comics through the regular use of balloons, and in this case, unlike many innovations in comics history, there appears to have been a moment, a singular instance, where that transformation occurred. Opper’s strip from December 30, 1900, “Cupid’s Everlasting ‘Jolly,’” combined both rhyming text and word balloons, and this comic, though it has not received the attention it deserves, led to the widespread adoption of the latter. Before it, artists had used balloons over many years, but only haphazardly; in fact, balloons themselves were not original to comics art but an extension of the medieval art mannerism of using phylactery or banderole—­basically scrolls\n\n18 • Ian Gordon\n\nemanating from the mouths of subjects—­as a means of conveying speech. But Opper’s comic, with its twelve panels using balloons, presaged the rapid adoption of the device by nearly all comics artists. Reading Hearst’s Sunday funny pages from 1896 through to 1901, the change is particularly noticeable. Up to the end of 1900, word balloons were used sparingly; by March 1901, Opper used them in almost all his work, and by mid-­1901, Hearst’s entire group of comics artists used them regularly. Why this happened in those six months is not clear, but it accompanied a shift to a more structured newspaper comic section with a number of regularly appearing features, such as Opper’s Happy Hooligan and Rudolph Dirks’s The Katzenjammer Kids. In all likelihood, efforts at shaping a supplement that was more constant in its features, and therefore better able to enter into a contract with readers by giving them what they wanted without too many surprises, fed a need for more distinctive characters who could, if not literally, then figuratively speak to the audience. Smolderen has proposed that after the invention of the phonograph, the use of word balloons shifted the understanding of text within comics: it was no longer read as internal dialogue but rather as a theatrical projection of sound.17 This suggests that in a growing mechanized society, the notion that speech could be captured and reproduced in one medium lent credence to its reproduction in another. In turn, then, the contract with readers could be extended and made more personal. Such an idea is not so easily provable, of course. In any case, although the Yellow Kid enjoyed some nationwide exposure, the spread of comics beyond newspapers in cities like New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco (where Pulitzer and Hearst owned papers) occurred only after the introduction of more regular strips with word balloons in 1901, long after Outcault had retired the Yellow Kid from the funny pages.\n\nThe Business of the Comic Strip The spread of comic strips to newspapers across the United States occurred very rapidly in the early years of the twentieth century. Within two years of 1901, when Opper inspired widespread adoption of word balloons, strips had spread to at least forty-­eight newspapers across the country and were available to at least 15.5 percent of the population. By 1913, these figures had increased to 114 newspapers and 21 percent of the population.18 At the turn of the century both British and American comics appeared weekly: in Britain, there were weekly magazines such as Comic Cuts and, in America, weekly Sunday supplements to newspapers. The looks of the magazine and supplements were not wildly dissimilar, though they were different in content and the American comics appeared in color. But by 1903, the weekly American supplement had taken on a more distinct character. The supplements tended to have a single comic strip on the front page using between six and nine panels (later, twelve panels also\n\nComic Strips • 19\n\nbecame standard). The rest of the supplement consisted of full-­page or half-­page comics using similar panel layouts. The comic strips, which had been fairly regular or semiregular features of the funny pages, became continuing weekly titles, a shift that helped define the supplement as primarily a vehicle for comics. This format became the template for American strips for the best part of the next fifty years. Regularization of the supplements’ contents was part and parcel of the growing mechanization of society. The comic strip supplements were mostly assembled in New York. At first, Hearst and Pulitzer had the area to themselves, but then newspapers like the New York Herald and syndicates like McClure’s added comic strips to their arrays of products, and other companies entered the field. Distribution across the country required regular production schedules because companies needed to prepare printing matrices for dispatch to newspapers across the country in order to print the comics on the same day. As a result, comic strips were shaped by production schedules and railroad timetables. At the same time, though, the broader sense of what made a comic strip—­as an entire array of products beyond the printed page, along the lines of Ally Sloper and the Yellow Kid—­was starting to change. Although the Yellow Kid replicated the success of Ally Sloper by colonizing a variety of products, one crucial difference made the American comic strip distinct from the British. Published in a newspaper, the Yellow Kid was not just self-­reinforcing but intimately linked first to the World and then to the Journal. A debate exists about just how Pulitzer’s and Hearst’s newspapers became known as the “yellow” press, but the common perception that this was because of the Yellow Kid shows how closely the comic was coupled with the papers.19 The Yellow Kid, of course, had nothing like the longevity of Ally Sloper but still represented an important step: though the Kid demonstrated that comic strips were more than appeared on the printed page and had to be understood more broadly, the strip also cemented comics’ relationship to a particular form of print, the newspaper. But because the Yellow Kid was so short-­lived, the best way to understand this development is to examine Outcault’s greatest success: Buster Brown. After abandoning the Yellow Kid (for reasons that remain unclear), Outcault experimented with different characters. Eventually, on May 4, 1902, the New York Herald debuted his new strip Buster Brown. It proved immediately popular, and by 1903, Buster Brown ran in at least three other papers: the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Herald, and the St. Louis Republic. Outcault licensed the character of Buster Brown to a vast array of goods, including a piano and a harmonica and foodstuffs like apples, bread, flour, and milk. Among the many licensees, two lines of goods became especially important because they attained national distribution: Buster Brown Shoes, from the Brown Shoe Company of St. Louis, and a range of children’s textile goods under the brand Buster Brown Apparel, produced by a textile mill in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\n20 • Ian Gordon\n\nThe popularity of Buster Brown proved lucrative to Outcault, who made $44,000 (roughly $1.2 million in 2020 dollars) between 1903 and 1907 from a stage-­show version. Also, because the comic strip business had changed, Outcault had a better chance of maximizing his return from the strip itself, which could now be syndicated more widely. In 1906, Outcault took the strip to Hearst’s newspapers, and so for a time, there were two competing versions. A legal case established that though Outcault owned the right to license Buster Brown, the Herald owned the copyright for a comic strip of that name; therefore the Herald ran a Buster Brown by other artists even as Outcault continued his version for Hearst, sans title. The character enjoyed enormous popularity for many years and bridged the divide between a centralized business economy and smaller-­scale local economies.20 Both the shoe and textile company promoted their goods by sending teams of drummers around the country with dwarfs dressed as Buster Brown. Such activities continued into the 1950s, long after the comic strip itself had stopped running. Whereas the strip ceased in the 1920s, the shoe brand survived into the twenty-­first century. The long-­term success of the brand supports the argument that comic strips are more than what appears in a newspaper. This argument helps explain not only the longevity of the brand but also, perhaps ironically, the disappearance of the printed Buster Brown. If we think of readers as engaged in a contract with a character and to varying degrees engaging with that character across different figurations, we can better understand the success of Ally Sloper, the Yellow Kid, and Buster Brown. Yet when newspapers started to carry daily comic strips, that implicit contract most likely shifted to include the expectation that the character would appear in print every day. Buster Brown was only ever a Sunday strip, and in that sense, Outcault failed to adapt to further changes in the business end of comics. While the Yellow Kid and Buster Brown mark the zenith of the nonprint exploitation of comic strips in the early twentieth century, even Winsor McCay’s vaunted Little Nemo in Slumberland (1905–1927), the most sophisticated and stunning comic of the day, existed off the page as well: as a stage play, a vaudeville act by McCay, and an advertisement for gardening tools. However, McCay’s career with Little Nemo was episodic (the strip’s high point occurred in its early run in the New York Herald), and this most accomplished comic strip never enjoyed as great a commercial success as Buster Brown, a strip with nowhere near the strength of McCay’s art. The point here is that the art was not the deciding factor in a strip’s success.\n\nDaily Comic Strips In the days of Ally Sloper, the Yellow Kid, and Buster Brown, the popular model of the comic strip was a once-­a-­week printed experience perhaps accompanied by some engagement with licensed (or unlicensed) spin-­off products: the\n\nComic Strips • 21\n\ncharacter smoking a cigar, say, or eating bread and drinking milk. Of course, not all comic strips had such broad commercial ambitions, but Sloper, the Kid, and Buster were touchstones, representing the medium’s potential for cross-­platform exploitation. After Buster Brown, it was some years before a comic again thrived to such a great extent beyond the printed page. Daily comics, however, kicked the business up a notch, broadening the idea of what a comic strip could be. This started in 1907 with the publication in the San Francisco Chronicle of A. Mutt by Bud Fisher, better known by its later title Mutt and Jeff (1907–­1983). Fisher’s strip originally ran on the sports page and depicted bets on real-­life horse races; in this regard, it resembled the short-­lived 1903 daily A. Piker Clerk by Clare Briggs. But unlike that earlier strip, Mutt and Jeff found a broad audience, particularly after 1908, when it was picked up and syndicated by Hearst. In that year, at least eleven newspapers across the United States began carrying daily strips. By 1913, that number had increased to almost one hundred papers, of which almost a quarter carried Mutt and Jeff. It is significant that the daily strip owes its origins to an adult activity, betting on races. The Sunday comic strips, though not aimed at children exclusively, achieved a broader, more polysemic appeal, across ages. By contrast, Britain did not launch a daily strip until April 1915, when the Daily Mail commenced Charles Folkard’s Teddy Tail, which was meant for children.21 Simply put, the advent of dailies changed the nature of comic strips. The difference between a weekly reading experience and a daily one alone would have been substantial. Gag strips had been accustomed to spreading a joke out over up to twelve panels, with one gag a week; they now had to produce seven gags and fit six of these into the three or four panels of a daily. Some artists coped with this increased demand by creating formulas in which the same sort of gag recurred every day, but the humor lay in clever variations. George Herriman’s Krazy Kat (1913–­1944) is a case in point, with the humor deriving from Ignatz Mouse’s delivery of a brick to Krazy’s head and Krazy’s delusion that these assaults were acts of love. Herriman took this gag and expanded it into the realms of the sublime, particularly in his Sunday pages. Other strip artists took a different tack, adapting melodrama with exaggerated plots and drawn-­ out story lines, complete with cliff-­hanging episodes to capture and hold readers’ attention. Among the most famous of these was the saga of Mary Gold, an arc in Sidney Smith’s The Gumps (1917–­1959), a very popular strip syndicated by the Chicago Tribune. The Mary Gold story line ran from May 1, 1928, through May 3, 1929, generating tremendous suspense and reader involvement, and ended with Mary’s death (to an avalanche of complaints). Melodramatic strips of this sort opened the way to various adventure strips like Milton Caniff ’s Terry and the Pirates (1934–­1973). That these latter two titles were syndicated by the Chicago Tribune indicates some of the other changes to comic strips wrought by the daily format. The Tribune, with its stablemate the New York Daily News, syndicated one\n\n22 • Ian Gordon\n\nof the strongest arrays of strips, including several that, in both daily and Sunday form, are beloved as classics of the medium: Dick Tracy (1931–­), Gasoline Alley (1918–­), The Gumps, Little Orphan Annie (1924–­2010), Moon Mullins (1923–­1991), Terry and the Pirates, and Winnie Winkle (1920–­1996). These strips have inspired many reprint efforts; several have formed the backbone of IDW Publishing’s ongoing book series the Library of American Comics. The need for both a daily and a Sunday strip as part of a business strategy became clear to this syndicate in the early 1920s. Gasoline Alley, which began as a Sunday-­only in November 1918, added a daily in August 1919. Winnie Winkle commenced in September 1920 and added a Sunday page in June 1922. Some Sunday-­only comics survived, but more and more, a strip required a daily version as well. For all their appeal, none of the characters in these comics seems to have captured the public’s attention to the same extent as Ally Sloper, the Yellow Kid, or Buster Brown. Though they had many appearances beyond the comic page (which included animated shorts, radio and film serials, toys, and the like), they were not as all-­pervasive as the earlier three comics. One reason none of these individual comics ever had the reach of, say, Buster Brown may be that individual strips no longer had to have broad polysemic appeal, since syndicates sold a mixture of strips to create a daily comics page that collectively had that appeal. This is not to say that a comic strip could never again gain such appeal: clearly Charles Schulz’s Peanuts did so, though it grew into that popularity gradually. The advent of dailies represented a shift by which the printed versions of comics assumed an even greater importance in their relationships with readers, though one still marked by an existence beyond the page. Even Garry Trudeau’s politically informed, often controversial Doonesbury (1970–­), perhaps the most unlikely strip ever to be associated with a range of merchandise, made the leap with a 1991 mail-­order catalog of products in aid of charity. Indeed, the only major comic strip artist to reject the standard model—­the comic strip as both daily and Sunday, accompanied by a range of products—­was Bill Watterson, who refused to merchandise his strip Calvin and Hobbes (1985–­1995). But the worldwide availability of unlicensed Calvin and Hobbes T-shirts and the like confirms that a strip’s contract with its readers may be beyond even the creator’s control. If Watterson would not give the audience what they wanted, they created it themselves or were happy to buy it from someone who had done so. Again, we see that expectations for a comic strip derive from the conditions of its production and reception more than any particular aesthetic innovation or singular artistic statement. Understanding what makes a comic strip requires more than understanding the formal language of comics and how it conveys meaning. A strip is a historical and commercial entity as well as a formal one. As newspapers have declined, and newer media like television and the internet have replaced their function, new ways of making, distributing, and reading comics have developed. For example, reducing the size of comics and jamming more onto a page—­a general trend in\n\nComic Strips • 23\n\nthe late twentieth century—­was a response to television. Likewise, the recent decimation of the print newspaper in the face of the internet has seen a dramatic rise in webcomics, many of which exist in a variety of materialities (e.g., Penny Arcade, Girl Genius, and PhD Comics; see chapter 17). The medium is so fluid that it can exist without print, yet at the same time, it continues to generate material merchandise in huge numbers. Such developments underscore the importance of the political economy of the comic strip as a cultural institution tied to concrete historical circumstances, not a form in the abstract.\n\nNotes 1 Michael Newman, Indie: An American Film Culture (New York: Columbia University Press, 2011), 11. 2 George Perry and Alan Aldridge, The Penguin Book of Comics: A Slight History (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971), 201. 3 Ian Gordon, Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890–­1945 (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998), 13. 4 Kevin Williams, Read All about It!

The answer is not as obvious as might be supposed.\n\nDefining the Format The annual Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide (fig. 2.1) is the most widely used guide (in fact, practically a bible) among collectors of American-­style periodical “comic books”—­that is, comic magazines.1 This Guide is an enormous paper database, crowdsourced and continually updated: a handy reference point for hobbyists and historians alike. It focuses on the standard U.S. comic magazine format that arrived in the 1930s, now roughly 7 by 10.5 inches in dimension, though formerly about 8 by 10.5 (closer to half-­tabloid size). That particular format is what American collectors typically have in mind when they use the term comic book: a half-­tabloid magazine full of comics, usually sixty-­four pages or less. The Overstreet Guide, launched by Robert Overstreet in 1970, tracks the resale prices of such magazines in the aftermarket. This Guide has become so integral to comic collecting that, among hobbyists, shorthand phrases like “below Guide” need no explanation, serving as a received jargon. Yet the Guide has a quirky, seemingly inconsistent way of defining comic books. Since the 1997 edition, Overstreet has included data about certain nonmagazines, such as hardbound collections of newspaper strips, that predate the hobby’s mythic “Golden Age” of the 1930s and onward.

Notably, the bulk of underground comic books, or comix, most of which sought to mimic the format of their mainstream comic book kin, has been pointedly kept out. This means that a ten-­by-­ten-­ inch cardboard-­covered book collection of George McManus’s newspaper strip Bringing Up Father, published by Cupples & Leon in 1919, appears in the Guide, but R. Crumb’s explosive Zap Comix #1, published by Apex Novelties in 1968 in precisely the standard comic book format, does not. This inconsistency cannot be explained away in terms of print run, accessibility, or fame, for Zap #1 is a famous, widely read comic book. Such discrepancies are accepted as a routine feature of American comic book collecting. It appears, then, that the “comic book” beloved of hobbyists is a field delimited by ideological as well as formal borders. This comic book is not only a material historical artifact but also an imaginative construct of its fandom, and certain objects appear easier to absorb into that construct than others. Platinum Age antecedents of the standardized comic book format now get admitted into the field readily, per Overstreet, while scandalous countercultural comix,\n\nComic Books • 27\n\ndespite adhering to that very format, meet resistance. This ideological border complicates efforts to recount the medium’s history accurately. On the one hand, the label “comic book,” as used by collectors that favor Overstreet, tends to be strict, as it does not equate simply to “any book consisting of comics” but rather tends to mean a specific pamphlet format. On the other, the label has arbitrary limits, provisionally admitting other formats, such as Platinum Age forerunners, even as the Guide marginalizes a key development in the history of pamphlet comics, the underground explosion of the 1960s and ’70s. The term comic book, then, despite Overstreet’s embrace of various kinds of publications, is not endlessly flexible. Among U.S. collectors, it does not extend to all other comics periodicals, even those that occupy, or formerly occupied, cultural niches arguably similar to that of the American comic book (such as the British comics weekly, Japanese zasshi, or Franco-­Belgian journal). In short, comic book, in the collectors’ sense, refers to a social object with a certain identity and history; it is not an expansive umbrella term. The standard American comic book (as defined per that specific definition) once produced a flood of different genres and styles that sold millions of units each month, saturating the United States and making long-­form comics storytelling an almost inescapable part of mass culture. It was a disposable triumph. Now, however, that same format is the focus of an intense object fetishism within a collecting culture that privileges some examples of the object but neglects others. With that in mind, this chapter does not take the term comic book as simply the sum of “comic” and “book” but rather focuses on just that one standard definition—­in today’s perhaps derisive parlance, the “floppy,” as formularized by the U.S. comic magazine industry since the 1930s. (Contrary to Overstreet, however, we will include underground comix as well.) In Overstreet’s culture, hobbyists expect a comic book to follow a prototypical format inherited from the pioneering experiments of a Connecticut-­based printing company, Eastern Color, a format first used as an advertising premium or giveaway. Eastern published promotional comic papers for various client companies starting in 1933, and the Gulf Comic Weekly, a tabloid made for Gulf Oil and given away at Gulf service stations, became a trendsetter.2 Eastern’s sales manager Harry Wildenberg pushed these projects, which were meant simply as sales incentives. Later in 1933, Wildenberg and Maxwell Gaines, an Eastern salesman, created the one-­shot Funnies on Parade, a premium for Procter & Gamble, in a new, smaller format, roughly 7.5 by 10.5 inches—­the start of the modern comic book, in Overstreet’s sense. Eastern tested the waters for such comic books as independent commodities with further one-­shots in 1933 and 1934, which led to the ongoing series Famous Funnies (1934–1955), widely distributed to newsstands and often described as the first successful modern comic book. Other publishers soon offered competing series in the same format, such as King Comics, Popular Comics, and Tip Top Comics (all 1936). All these, like Famous Funnies, consisted mostly of material reprinted from newspaper strips. In this\n\n28 • Charles Hatfield\n\nway, comic books began as a clever Depression-­era tactic for making a little extra money without creating anything fundamentally new. However, new, original material began appearing in these magazines as early as 1935, championed by the tabloid New Fun and a follow-­up (in the smaller format), New Comics, both published by National Allied. By early 1937, new material had become standard for comic books, but it was not until 1938 that the medium began to become a commercial powerhouse—­thanks to the success of Action Comics, published by National Allied’s successor, Detective Comics Inc. (DC). Action’s first issue introduced Superman, giving birth to the popular, much-­imitated superhero formula that galvanized the business (see chapter 14). Thus the now-­standard comic book format became the basis of a distinct industry. Since then, all precursors or alternate formats, such as albums or tabloids, have been judged by their resemblance to or divergence from this prototype (a standard not changed by the rise of Platinum Age comic book collecting).3 In sum, the American “comic book,” in the narrow sense argued here, begins with Famous Funnies as a template and the cottage industry that it spawned. After 1938 and the advent of the superhero, that industry mushroomed—­yet there was more to these magazines during their salad days than just the superhero. In the not-­quite twenty years after Famous Funnies appeared, comic books offered a slew of genres and moods: adventure fiction in a globe-­trotting imperialist mode, as well as Westerns and war stories (all carrying on traditions from dime novels, pulp magazines, and newspaper adventure strips); funny animals and other children’s humor comics; teenage-­themed humor in the Archie vein; movie and media tie-­ins; science fiction; morally improving, adult-­sanctioned comics (including adaptations of literary classics, hagiographic life stories, and other “true” tales); and outrageous, less-­approved genres such as crime, horror, scurrilous satire à la Mad, and the hugely popular genre of romance. All of these and more were in the mix: from the presumed wholesomeness of Walt Disney’s Comics and Stories (1940) to the hard-­nosed gallows literature of Crime Does Not Pay (1942), and from the earnest, emphatic Young Romance (1947) and all that it inspired to the ghoulishly amused, ultraviolent horror of Crypt of Terror (1950) and its offspring. Almost all this work was produced in a febrile rush, under tight deadlines, in eye-­grabbing, attention-­begging styles shaped by many forces: pulp and comic strip formulas, the demands of the market and of editors, the youthful ardor of on-­the-­job training, the cynical resignation of hardened if not exhausted freelancers, and a sense that anything could be thrown at the wall to see what might stick.\n\n“Comic Book” Tradition and Nostalgia The comic book as artifact and cultural signpost (think “comic book style,” “comic book movie,” and so on) still carries connotations from this early, crazily\n\nComic Books • 29\n\nprolific period, the mid-­1930s to the mid-­1950s. When American hobbyists say “comic book,” this is the tradition they have in mind. Its connotations are those of formula entertainment offered on the cheap, yet occasionally, improbably, catching fire and inspiring uninhibited work that unites commercial imperatives and personal style. Comic book carries with it the whiff of childhood pleasures yet also a faintly remembered scandalousness, a far cry from the bid for seriousness implicit in more recent terms like graphic novel (see chapter 6). Pop art seized upon this louche reputation in the 1960s, recasting the history of the medium in a wash of retrospective irony. Suffice to say that the comic book is not just a format but a cultural touchstone. Attempts to sidestep the “comic book” label testify to anxiety about the form’s cultural status. At the same time, that label appeals strongly to the dedicated fandom that has made the comic book its own. To embrace the term is to claim the tradition embodied by Overstreet and conserved by that fandom: a nostalgic populism upheld by the monkish study of minute data. For fandom, the label conjures up a long, mazy history defined by putative “Ages” (Golden, Silver, etc.) as well as a pantheon of publishers and creators. Most present-­day fans focus on two surviving industry giants: DC, launched as National Allied circa 1935, and Marvel, founded as Timely in 1939 (and called by many other names in fine print over the 1940s and ’50s). Both DC and Marvel have had complex ownership histories and are now subsidiaries of multinational conglomerates: WarnerMedia and Disney, respectively. They concentrate on superheroes and serve as licensing farms for other media, including films, television, and video games (see chapter 7). Collectors deeply invested in the medium’s history, however, will remember competing major publishers such as the still-­going Archie Comics (founded as MLJ in 1939) and the now-­defunct Dell, Quality, Fiction House, Lev Gleason, Fawcett, Hillman, Prize, Gilberton, Harvey, Charlton, American Comics Group, Standard, Fox, EC, St. John, Gold Key, and Canada’s Anglo-­American and Bell Features. Littered along the historical wayside are many others that appeared early and are now poignantly obscure. Bygone publishers of more recent vintage include pioneering independent comics outfits of the 1970s and ’80s such as Star*Reach, Pacific, Eclipse, First, Comico, and Canada’s Vortex. These were precursors or early rivals of still-­going independents like Fantagraphics, Dark Horse, and Image and their newer competitors such as IDW and Boom! Studios. (The full lineage of the independents should also include underground comix publishers largely excluded from Overstreet, like The Print Mint, Apex Novelties, Rip Off Press, San Francisco Comic Book Company, Kitchen Sink, and Last Gasp.) More than a history of publishers, comic books offer a chronicle of objects. As a class of object, the comic book was perhaps always fated to become the focus of an organized nostalgia. A piece of fragile, throwaway ephemera (only later reconceived as a ready-­made collectible), the comic book began as a\n\n30 • Charles Hatfield\n\nten-­cent wonder that a child might scrounge up enough spare change to buy and then share with other kids: something to be bartered, traded around, and read to bits. As an artifact redolent of childhood, defined by its disposability (by the likelihood that it would disintegrate soon enough), the early comic book underscored—­but, as it turned out, could also potentially defy—­the inevitability of time and change. Every survival of an old comic book into future decades scored an improbable, therefore sweet, victory over time. Also, the precisely dated nature of comic books as periodicals (street date, cover date, and so on) enabled collectors to map private remembrances onto more public forms of memory: to join individual and social perceptions of historical time. That is, comic book collecting provides a way for private and public time to intersect and for subjective memories to be, in a sense, mapped, charted, and organized along a shared time line. In addition, enduring genres like the superhero draw on recognition codes shared between text and readers, such that readers’ appreciation may be deepened by awareness of what has gone before: a surplus pleasure that invites nostalgic investment. Moreover, as Thierry Groensteen suggests, the visual and haptic appeal of the medium, and its spatial organization, may encourage a particularly intense relationship between reader and text. As narrative objects constituted by the sequencing and rhythmic interplay of small images, comic books offer a specific form of pleasure: an “art of details” that is not merely the sum of story-­and art-­related pleasures, and that, argues Groensteen, urges an up close, “fetishistic” relationship between reader and object, one that entails minutely poring over and rereading the texts.4 In short, the very design of comic books, as objects thick with significant detail, contributes to their appeal as memorabilia. For all these reasons, comic books seem fated to have become evocative talismans of past experience: precious because they were flimsy; timeless because they were dated; loved because they were childish or brought childhood back to mind; fondly recalled because they were a source of self-­chosen, even illicit fugitive reading that many readers encountered at a formative age; and involving because they were often detailed, tightly organized, densely nested objects. The whiff of old newsprint—­and all the apparatus designed to preserve old newsprint, from acid-­free boxes to Mylar sleeves—­carries comic book collectors away, backward, into a richly reconstructed (or imagined) past. Yet there is a danger in describing comic book fandom simply as nostalgic investment. Comic books are not stamps or coins; they are first, and most obviously, readable. These are narrative objects: they tell stories, and stories can change the world. The comic book hobby has not just been an inward-­turning nostalgia machine, and its readers have not simply been in retreat from present to past. Rather, the hobby has supported, if at times inadvertently, the further artistic growth and even continued social relevance of the comic book, helping to make possible subsequent challenging developments such as alternative\n\nComic Books • 31\n\ncomics (see chapter 3) and graphic novels (again, chapter 6). Improbably enough, the comic book did not go the way of other bygone popular press formats such as the dime novel or pulp magazine but instead grew and changed—­even as so many of its nostalgic collectors resisted change. Comic books have not simply survived but transformed.\n\nThe History in Outline Broadly speaking, the American comic book has gone from a mass to a niche medium. Its history divides roughly as follows: an embryonic period of experimentation (through 1938); a heyday defined by big sales and cultural notoriety (from 1939 to the mid-­1950s); a near-­collapse, followed by retrenchment and suffocating self-­censorship (after 1954); and finally, an era of nostalgic reclamation and active intervention by fans (notable after 1960). Curiously, that last period coincided with a radicalization—­that is, the redefining of the medium as a vehicle for personal expression (the underground period, post-­1967). After all this, in the 1970s, came the entrenchment of a specialized comic book market catering to fans, one that has simultaneously kept alive yet boxed in the medium. This specialty market, called the direct market, consists of dedicated comic book stores and is what enabled comic books to survive after 1980. The direct market led at once inward—­to increasingly specialized, hermetic comics—­but also outward, to new artistic heights and opportunities to engage the larger culture. For example, it became the seedbed of the graphic novel movement of the ’80s and after, which went mainstream and flourished post-­2000. Collectors remember a Golden Age that lasted, most will say, from the late 1930s to the early ’50s. Superman’s launch in 1938 is the mythological flashpoint for that era, while the scandals and setbacks of the mid-­1950s define its end. Famous Funnies and its ilk are often thought of as preceding the Golden Age in a nascent period of research and development, circa 1934 to 1938, marked by the practice of building comic books out of reprinted newspaper strips. That reprinting strategy, as noted, was how the medium got started, and in the very early years, the layout and design choices of comic books reflected their roots as pasted-­up newspaper strip compilations, with regular, lockstep grids of panels and little variation. Comic books in those days were a small, frankly parasitic industry built up by recycling existing material. The format was created not for the sake of inventive storytelling or self-­expression but as a sales tool, and its aesthetic horizons were defined early on by the industry’s cheapness. The idea was to continue putting out comic books (whether consisting of new or reprinted material) that could be published just as cheaply as those early reprints had been. The limited amount of newspaper strips ripe for reprinting, along with the prospect of growing profits, soon incited the bulk of publishers to follow National Allied’s example and invest in new material—­but then they\n\n32 • Charles Hatfield\n\ntypically invested as little as possible. The industry earned a reputation for delivering entertainment cheaply to young and undiscriminating readers and for paying its talent as little as it could get away with. Superman and his imitators—­of which there were quite a few by late 1939 and a horde soon after—­enabled the comic book industry to shift into overdrive (see chapter 14). Comic books enjoyed a meteoric rise between 1939 and 1940 and continued growth until circa 1944–­1945. Wartime privation, including paper rationing, did not much slow the industry’s growth, and in fact GIs became a major audience, reading comic books in the millions. Sales rose again postwar, hitting a peak in 1952, when, as Jean-­Paul Gabilliet estimates, about a billion copies of comic magazines, representing over 3,100 new releases, hit the market.5 By then, the comic book had become a staple of American popular culture—­part of the landscape—­and especially a main ingredient in the reading lives of young people. Throughout this period of tremendous popular growth, however, comic books inspired dislike and even fear among many parents and cultural gatekeepers—­ educators, psychologists, critics—­ who regarded the new, mushrooming medium as an invitation to illiteracy, social degeneracy, and crime. Published commentary against comic books began as early as 1940. It surged again postwar, by which time the industry had shifted away from superheroes to a broader range of genres, including sensationalistic ones like crime comics (distinct as early as 1942 but more common after 1947), romance comics (launched in 1947, booming by 1949), and horror comics (famously popularized by publisher EC in 1950). These bred controversy. Sales of comic books grew even as a wave of moral panic, and attendant political and legal challenges, assailed the medium from 1947 to about 1950, prompting half-­hearted industry attempts at self-­moderation. This wave of distrust and fear, even revulsion, toward comic books recurred and spiked from 1952 to 1954, inspiring outcry from many sectors and in many forms: academic and professional articles and symposia; newspaper editorials; the drafting of statutes and resultant debates about constitutionality and freedom of speech; public burnings of comics. Most notorious for leading the professional outcry against comic books was psychiatrist and progressive social critic Fredric Wertham—­known for articles on comics from the late 1940s on and, especially, for the incendiary book Seduction of the Innocent—­published in 1954 to great public and political interest (again, see chapter 14). In the spring of 1954, the U.S. Senate held hearings into the alleged links between juvenile delinquency—­a topic of intense social concern in postwar America—­and comic book reading, and these drew much media coverage, inspiring op-­eds and further uproar. Wertham appeared as expert witness. The comic book industry, pummeled by this criticism, unable to marshal effective legal defenses, and myopically profit-­driven in general, resorted to self-­censorship along the lines of Hollywood’s Motion Picture Production Code, or Hays Code.\n\nComic Books • 33\n\nComic books’ equivalent of the Hays Office came late in 1954, when a majority of comic book publishers based in New York established the Comics Magazine Association of America, and through it, the Comics Code Authority, a censorship body that functioned semi-­independently from the publishers—­and perhaps more forcefully than they had expected. The CCA applied the Comics Code, which enforced rigid, authoritarian standards on comic book content. It became the gateway through which most American comic books had to pass from late 1954 onward (after the 1980s, the direct market rendered the CCA moot, though the Code hung on in vestigial form until 2011). The Code not only forbade explicit depictions of violence and sex and strong hints of danger and sensuality—­thus putting a damper on crime, romance, and horror comics—­but also espoused unambiguous moralism and obedience to official authority. In effect, it imposed on the medium a narrow, protectionist notion of childhood reading (see chapter 9). This was a restrictive recipe, squashing much of what had been thrilling and strange about pre-­Code comic books. In the mythology of comic book fandom, the Code nearly killed comic books, throttling all by itself what had been a Golden Age. That is an oversimplification. True, comic books right after the Code appear constricted and bland, and after their near-­collapse in the midfifties, comic magazines never again enjoyed the same sales numbers or cultural reach. The field has never regained the prolificacy and vitality it enjoyed prior to about 1953, when the most popular comic books could sell over a million per issue and the total circulation of comics approached that fabled billion. However, other factors besides the Code also sapped the comic book industry, including shakeups in magazine distribution6 and declining profit margins brought about by the fixed ten-­cent price of comic books, a policy seemingly based on the assumption that comic books were bought with children’s pocket money. (Between the mid-­1930s and 1962, a dime was the price standard; by contrast, magazines like the Saturday Evening Post and Life typically increased in price fourfold during those years.) Perhaps most importantly, the meteoric rise of commercial television posed stiff competition for comics as a source of serial storytelling. The Code’s onset, however, functions as fandom’s myth of the Fall. For many fans, hating the Code appears to serve a crucial identity function. In truth, a haze surrounds this era despite the fact that the anti–­comic book crusade and resulting Code are the most-­studied topics in comic book historiography.7 It is fair to say that the period is obsessed over yet poorly understood. That said, the Code truly did signal a turn in the comic book’s fortunes: post-­Code, the medium transformed from a flourishing, endlessly adaptable part of mass culture to a cosseted and specialized niche devoted to a fixed idea of childhood. Comic books after 1954 struggled to adapt to changing times, for their editorial horizons were firmly fixed by the CCA regime, which prescribed a narrow, patronizing view of the readership.\n\n34 • Charles Hatfield\n\nPost-­Code Superheroes and Fandom If certain genres (such as Archie-­style teen comedy, funny animal stories, and TV tie-­ins) did well under the Code, one pre-­Code genre in particular dramatically resurged and thrived in the new climate: ironically, the superhero. As Marc Singer recounts (see chapter 14), superheroes made a definitive comeback in the post-­Code era and thus came to dominate, if not comic book sales, then organized fandom (Archie continued to outsell superheroes for much of the sixties, but you would never know that from most comics scholarship). Many comic book histories have taken the superhero as the unquestioned core of the industry, at the cost of mystifying the medium’s actual development. For fans, the superhero, which had already played a starring role in the myth of the industry’s rise, became the reason for the industry’s (partial) resurgence, its “Silver Age.” In fact, comic book fandom and the newly revived, Silver Age superhero grew up together; the incremental revival of superheroes after 1956 coincided with the gradual rise of a newly self-­conscious, more focused and structured fan culture. The years 1960–­1961 proved a watershed, the moment when fanzines (amateur fan magazines) began to draw together formerly isolated fans or purely local enclaves into a larger national community. Comic book fandom had always been a participatory culture, and there had been earlier attempts to organize fans (such as fanzines devoted to the publisher EC in the early 1950s), but 1960–­1961 saw a new and deliberate wave of activity among fans, including the launch of seminal zines: Xero, Comic Art, and the superhero-­oriented Alter Ego. These signaled that comic book fandom was not merely an adjunct of science fiction fandom but its own growing phenomenon. In particular, Alter Ego became the template for superhero fandom, spawning much fanzine and amateur press activity; its nostalgia for old superheroes, and active support for the superhero revival, modeled the direction much of comics fandom would take.8 Fanzines and amateur press associations took the barter economy and underground culture of fandom to new heights (for detailed discussion of fandom, see chapter 8). By knitting together correspondents and friends beyond the local level, these grassroots publications helped establish the familiar features of fan culture, including dealers, mail order, used bookstores that catered to comic book collectors, conventions, and masquerades (or cosplay, in today’s parlance). They not only were backward-­looking (though nostalgia was of course a motivator) but also endorsed, critically examined, and encouraged conversation around the renascent comic book field and, in effect, took ownership of the resurgent superhero genre. Even as comic books shrank from mass to niche medium, the new discourse of fandom inspired newspaper articles about collecting, popular historical books about comics, and a continued outpouring of specialized zines, bulletins, and papers. The two leading publishers of superheroes in the sixties, Marvel and DC, encouraged this growth by running letter\n\nComic Books • 35\n\ncolumns in their comics that gave out not only fans’ critical opinions but also, in some cases, full addresses for the fan correspondents—­a move that enabled fans to contact each other outside the pages of the comics and establish their own networks of friendship, barter, and publication. This shot in the arm for the industry, however, did not restore comic books to pre-­Code numbers. Although DC thrived on the “Batmania” marketing craze sparked by the Batman TV series (1966–­1968) and Marvel capitalized on its air of Pop art and college campus hipness, in truth, the comic book revival was only partial. The comic book never regained its status as a truly mass medium; instead, it became a hobby. The “campy” or Pop art superhero became simply a sixties fad. Nonsuperhero franchises such as those of Archie Comics and Harvey Comics remained commercially vital, but histories of the era tend to neglect them in favor of Marvel and DC, the two companies whose courtship of superhero fandom enabled them to weather what turned out to be an industry-­wide decline in the late sixties and after. By the late seventies, comic book sales had crumbled, and the industry’s future seemed in doubt, despite rearguard efforts to adapt to the times. A revision of the Comics Code in 1971 had relaxed the old strictures a bit, allowing more socially relevant content and the revival of once-­forbidden genres like horror. This, combined with a post-­ Vietnam malaise, brought new levels of questioning and at times tortured self-­ awareness into the comics mainstream—­what Bradford Wright has called “the culture of self-­interrogation.”9 At the same time, however, comic books plunged headfirst into nostalgic revivalism, recognizing fandom as their core audience. Pulp magazine heroes such as Conan, The Shadow, and Doc Savage, forebears of the comic book superhero, became important names among comics fans, yet beyond hardcore fandom, the medium was languishing. Many creators assumed that they would be out of work in a few years. What changed all this—­what rallied the industry, albeit gradually—­was a new means of comic book selling dreamed up by organized collectordom: the direct market. Though rooted in the underground business model of late-­’60s comix, the direct market effectively arrived in 1973 when fan entrepreneur Phil Seuling and his partner Jonni Levas persuaded mainstream comics publishers to funnel comic books to their distribution company (later called Sea Gate), which then sold the comics to shops around the country on a nonreturnable basis.\n\nThe Direct Market This direct market transformed a grassroots aftermarket in old comic books into a distribution network for new ones. In the sixties and early seventies, a number of specialized shops had sprung up to serve the nostalgic demand for vintage comic books; these were the brick-­and-­mortar adjuncts of mail order and convention dealers. The direct market coalesced when shops like these found a\n\n36 • Charles Hatfield\n\nreliable and affordable way to stock new comics. This novel distribution system did not compete with the newsstand market but simply bypassed it, empowering collectors’ shops to sell a mix of collectible old comic books and brand-­new ones. In the early days of this so-­called direct distribution, most shops sold more old comic books than new, since new ones were relatively few. By the late seventies, however, a new sector of independent publishing arose to take advantage of direct distribution; at the same time, new distributors rose up to challenge Sea Gate (whose near-­monopoly on direct distribution was undone by a 1978 lawsuit). Further, by decade’s end, the reigning old guard of comic book publishers, Marvel and DC, began to focus their attention away from the faltering newsstand market and toward comic shops. After 1981, this trend was overwhelming, as Marvel and DC staked their futures on fandom. Their new emphasis on direct sales encouraged an explosion of comic shops, regional distributors, and small publishers: a competitive frenzy that yielded a generation of non-­Code, direct-­only comics that included not just independents but also special titles from Marvel and DC. This upsurge made the so-­called local comic shop (LCS) a reality. Direct distribution professionalized, or perhaps colonized, fandom’s shadow economy, enabling publishers to sidestep the more traditional yet increasingly unprofitable newsstand market for periodicals.10 Its inspirations were partly underground, in the alternative grassroots economy constituted by the comix-­carrying head shops of the counterculture; indeed, some early comic shops sought to champion underground comix alongside more mainstream fare. Overall, though, this was not a radical new market but a nostalgia-­oriented collectors’ market. Direct sales catered to a captive, or at least loyal, audience that could be relied on to spend much of its money and time buying, reading, and thinking about comic books. Direct sales fed a hobby, even an all-­consuming lifestyle. That market, still in place today, favors publishers and asks retailers to assume risks. It works on the basis of nonreturnability: retailers must keep all the comics they order, with no hope of a refund for unsold product. The retailers may enjoy deep discounts and a loyal customer base but also bear the costs of whatever does not sell—­which means that publishers do not have to bear the cost of returns. This practice sets comic book shops apart from newsstands and regular bookstores, which work on a returnable or consignment basis. Essentially, the market serves as a de facto subscription system, for orders are solicited months before the comics are printed, in effect underwriting the publication of the comics and, again, minimizing publishers’ risk. This combination of preordering and nonreturnability gives publishers a distinct advantage, which historically has meant an incentive to try out more experimental or narrowly fan-­oriented publications. The result for independent or self-­publishers was access to the same market enjoyed by DC and Marvel at a relatively low risk.\n\nComic Books • 37\n\nThe result for DC and Marvel, meanwhile, was both a plethora of spinoff publications (for example, Marvel’s industry-­leading X-Men franchise spawned many derivative titles) and the exploration of new publication formats and methods, including the “limited” series, improved paper stocks, new coloring processes, square-­bound or “prestige” comic books, large-­format albums, and ultimately “graphic novels.” In other words, the direct market became a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity, new publishing gimmicks, and in some cases, substantially new and formula-­defying content. Much of this activity centered on the superhero, and indeed direct sales enabled the so-­called revisionist superhero titles that defined the late 1980s (again, see chapter 14). These comics were undeniably offspring of the direct market and epitomized the market’s tendency to resell familiar genre formulas in upscale packages. For example, Frank Miller’s seminal Batman graphic novel, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, appeared first as four successive forty-­eight-­ page comic books titled Batman: The Dark Knight (February–­August 1986) in standard comic book size but “prestige” format—­that is, with heavy cardstock covers and perfect (i.e., square-­bound and glued) bindings. Dark Knight represented a departure not only in content but also in look and feel: at $2.95 per issue, these ad-­free, deluxe comics contrasted sharply with the standard thirty-­two-­page, $0.75 Batman comics of the time (which generally included about twenty-­two pages of story and many pages "
