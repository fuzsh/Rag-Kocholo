        "text": "A further update from Gábor, a few days after he sent the first message, above: (thank you again, Gábor!)\n\nI thought, that I should search some pages about kurucs (kurucok - in hungarian plural) because my english and memory is not to good...\n\n:)\n\nSo I found some very good page about Imre Thököly (the kuruc king) and his wife Ilona Zrínyi and of course about Ferenc Rákóczi II.\n\nOh, and you have to read about Vak Bottyán (Bottyán the Blind) the great kuruc general, and László (Leslie) Ocskay the kuruc colonel who become a traitor and labanc at end of the independence war of Rákóczi through a beautiful labanc spy woman. We have a very good book about this story by Mór Jókai: \"Szeretve mind a vérpadig\" (I'm trying it translate: To be loved forever until scaffold). Colonel László Ocskay were executed by sword in castle of Érsekújvár on Christmas Eve at 1710. His lover, the labanc spy woman went crazy, because she had a letter from the emperor, and an offer in this letter: kuruc officer hostige for Ocskay. But she was late, and she saw just the head of her lover on the top of the highest tower of Érsekújvár.It was the kuruc's vengeance!\n\nWhen kuruc leaders heard, that Ocskay became traitor, a small kuruc team went into Vienna in labanc clothes, into the lair of the lion, and kidnapped him for judgement.\n\nIt's a good story, isn't? We hungarians have very long and intresting history! :)\n\n(The following information refers to a dead link, but I have kept mhere as it may be useful:)\n\n\"You can see on the top of the page a stamp with a kuruc vs. labanc battle. The text on the stamp: HUNGARIAN POST- Unknown painter: Kuruc - labanc battle (part). I remember that this picture there was in my history book in the elementary school. The kuruc soldiers used an ancient hungarian weapon: fokos. It is a small axe like the indian tomahawk but it's pole is longer because they were horseman\".\n\nAgain Rákóczi's and Thököly's history, and the famous picture from the young Ferenc Rákóczi II. by Ádám Mákonyi in 1711.\n\nhttp://hungaria.org/hal/hungary/index.php?halid=14&menuid=237\n\nIn the hungarian language we have 44 sound, but when we arrived to Carpatian Basin had to use the latin alphabet. In latin alphabet are little number of character for hungarian sounds.\n\nHungarian alphabet:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_alphabet\n\nThe first hungarian king (Saint Stephen r. 997-1038) destroyed every ancient hungarian writing, and made some law, and must use the latin alphabet. It wasn't problem for some centuries, because we used the latin language in official place. But 500 years ago - like other nations - we started to use our native language in letters.\n\nFor many hungarian sounds they couldn't find good alternative in latin alphabet. So tried to use some characters for the good hungarian sounds.\n\nThe hungarian \"c\" isn't same the english \"c\", but similar the \"ts\" in the word: tsunami. The ancient hungarian knew this problem, so make some version of the solution: kurucz, kurutz.\n\nDuring the centuries clear out every sound writing rules, but not in the XVII. century. Present day we write kuruc, and say kuruc. 300 years ago we wrote kurucz or kurutz and say kuruc.\n\nOther example: Your father name was Ferenc Kurucz. One hundred years ago Ferenc was Ferencz...\n\nHere you can read about the language:"
