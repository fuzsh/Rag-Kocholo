“blacksmith, metalworker” (1). It may also be spelled Schmidt or Schmitz. Other occupational surnames, such as Müller or Miller, are also highly common (2).\n\nGarcia, likely meaning “bear” from the Basque “hartz,” ranks number one in Spain (3). However, Garcia is also popular in many European Spanish and Portuguese-speaking nations.\n\nWhat Is the Oldest Surname in Europe?\n\nThe oldest surname in Europe is the Irish Ó Briain, Anglicized as O’Brien and O’Brian. It means “descendant of Brian” from the Celtic root “brixs” (hill/high) or “brigā” (might/power).\n\nThis Irish last name was recorded in use from 916 A.D. Michael O’Hair’s “Soldier of the Revolution” states, “…in the year 916 A.D., When the “O” was first affixed to a name, it was to designate ‘grandson of Brien.’”\n\nIn modern times, all forms of O’Brien are pretty common (4). Despite claims that the Irish O’Cleary/O’Clery is the oldest, there are no documented sources (5).\n\nWhat Is the Oldest British Surname?\n\nThe oldest recorded British surname is Hatt. It is of Anglo-Saxon origin but may even predate the Saxon invasion, having Celtic-language Brythonic roots (6).\n\nHatt was a surname denoting a “hatter,” someone who made and sold hats. Although not the most popular among European family names, there are about 8,426 bearers worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Most British Family Name?\n\nSmith is the most common British family name, popular in Scotland and the UK.\n\nIt also ranks first in other English-speaking territories like Canada, Australia, and the U.S. (7).\n\nOriginating in medieval times, Smith means “metalworker, blacksmith,” from the Old English “smiþ” (smid). It stems from the word “smitan,” meaning “to smite, to hit.”\n\nWhat Is the Origin of Surnames in Europe?\n\nSurnames in Europe came from one’s occupation, notable features (often nicknames), an ancestor or father’s name, or a location (8). This resulted in many Smiths/Schmidts, Millers/Müllers, Bakers/Beckers, as well as Martinez and Ivanovs.\n\nThe landmass of Europe is broken into many languages and cultures, resulting from a long history of migration, wars, and assimilations. Hence, European last names often have Celtic, Germanic, Scandinavian, or Norman roots. Others derive from Latin, Greek, and even Persian and Arabic.\n\nFeedback: Was This Article Helpful?\n\nThank You For Your Feedback!\n\nThank You For Your Feedback!\n\nWhat Did You Like?\n\nWhat Went Wrong?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLeigha Mayers\n\nLeigha-Ceres Mayers is a freelance editor and copywriter from Trinidad and Tobago.
