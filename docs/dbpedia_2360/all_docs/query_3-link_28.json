        "text": "Family crests and coats of arms emerged during the Middle Ages, mostly in wider Europe. They were used as a way to identify knights and nobles on the battlefield and in tournaments. The designs were unique to each family and were passed down from generation to generation.\n\nThe earliest crests were simple designs, such as a single animal or symbol, but they became more elaborate over time. Coats of arms were also developed, which included a shield with the family crest, as well as other symbols and colors that represented the family's history and achievements.\n\nThe use of family crests and coats of arms spread throughout Europe and became a symbol of social status and identity. They were often displayed on clothing, armor, and flags, and were used to mark the family's property and possessions.\n\nToday, family crests and coats of arms are still used as a way to honor and celebrate family heritage.\n\nThe family name Toth has various variations across different regions and cultures. In Hungary, it is commonly spelled as T贸th, with an accent on the \"o.\" This variation is also prevalent in Slovakia, where it is pronounced as \"T贸t.\" In Romania, the name is often written as Tothu or Tothi, reflecting the influence of the Romanian language. In some cases, the name may be anglicized to T贸th or T贸thi when individuals from these regions migrate to English-speaking countries. Additionally, there are variations of the name in other languages, such as the German \"Tott\" or the Polish \"Tota.\" These variations highlight the diverse history and migration patterns of individuals with the Toth surname. Despite the different spellings and pronunciations, individuals with these variations of the name share a common heritage and are part of a larger family network."
