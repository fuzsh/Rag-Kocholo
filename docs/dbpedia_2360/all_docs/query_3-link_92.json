        "text": "Placement Partner is always such a pleasure to use. The user-friendly aspect of it and the organizational qualities make it an essential tool for our agency to use on a daily basis.\n\nGG Recruitment has been subscribing to Placement Partner for the last 2 years and can confidently recommend them to any small to large recruitment agency. The system is extremely user friendly and fully integrated with most search portals. The valuable time Placement Partner saves you in administration is priceless.\n\nAs a “newbie” to the industry 3 years ago, Placement Partner has been my most valuable partner in ensuring that my business processes are streamlined and efficient. The continual follow up, and professional support service has been great and I love that I have the flexibility to customise functionalities to suit my specific needs, ensuring that we stay dynamic and relevant.\n\nPlacement Partner is a fantastic management information tool that enables us to offer a professional, efficient service to both our clients and candidates.\n\nWe are really enjoying using Placement Partner in our business! Besides being very user friendly with excellent training and support just a phone call away, it has all the functionality we need to run our recruitment operations from. The reporting functionality is also great and information is just a push of a button away. Sara and her team rock and are always there when we need them.\n\nI have been a client of Placement Partner since 2013 and have used the system in both an outsourced recruitment role and now as an internal recruitment workflow system. The portal is easy to use and highly customizable. The integration with SMS, email, job portals and various calendars enables myself and my team to work collaboratively on various positions whilst keeping each other and the candidates and line managers up to date.\n\nWhen we approached Placement Partners 3 years ago on recommendation from another satisfied client, our database was in a total mess. PP. with great patience, held our hands through the changeover.\n\nAs a new player in the IT Recruitment market, we soon found it evident that we’d need a CRM that would suit our needs. Placement Partner has now become one of the most essential systems within our company. Thank you to Sara Volker for her continually friendly and accommodating assistance, as well as Ntsali Mota and the entire support team who are only a “smiling” email away. Placement Partner is not simply a CRM system, but seen as a valued SoftMine Consulting “team member” and we’d be lost without it.\n\nPlacement Partner has changed the way we do recruitment. We have a far wider reach as our advert uploads to multiple online job portals. In addition, we don’t have to deal with hundreds of email applicants because the advert response goes straight to our database. We definitely plan to stay with Placement Partner and recommend you try them.\n\nFrom the moment the Placement Partner offering was introduced to us via Sara, our experience has only ever been efficient and incredibly professional service. Sara is always available and willing to assist and this general work ethic certainly filters through to the entire team as our dealings with Ntsali and the rest of the Support team have only ever been positive. We would have no hesitation in putting our name next to theirs and look forward to many more years of working together.\n\nPlacement Partner has streamlined our entire Recruitment Process. We researched various programs in the past and we finally chose Placement Partner and see the benefits on a daily basis. The recruitment process has become faster, more efficient and it much easier to keep control of our clients, candidates and various reports that can be generated by means of the system.\n\nI have been very impressed with the service from Placement Partner. The entire process has been professional from my first meeting where Sara explained the system to my team, to our training we received, and now the efficient after service. I am satisfied with the professional service and I can see the value of how the system is streamlining our recruitment process.\n\nThe software is easy to use and the functionality can be adapted to suit our needs and requirements without fuss.\n\nI am a true advocate for how great the system is and how it has improved and streamlined the way we work.\n\nI have never experienced or come across a better, easy to use and brilliant service like the one from Placement Partner."
