        "text": "When Nobel Laureate, Enrico Fermi, nuclear physicist, was asked if he believed in extraterrestrials, he replied – „They are already here…they are called Hungarians!” Fermi’s Martians called Hungarians enriched the world with over a hundred thousand inventions, not to mention their countless scientific discoveries.\n\nSo here i collected and posted the list of hungarians who contributed some good ideas to our civilisations. Sadly most of them succseed abroad, but have been aducatedin Hungary. My idea is: Hungarians are very inventive because of our language. Mind represent the structure of language, and vica versa.. so here we are:\n\nHungarian Inventors,\n\nASBÓTH OSZKÁR, (1891 – 1960) Invention: HELICOPTER\n\nOszkár Asbóth was born in Pankota and died in Budapest. He finished his studies at Arad and became an engineer. He was a student of Tódor von Kármán, the Father of Supersonic Flight.\n\nIn 1917, during World War I, Oszkár Asbóth, Tódor von Kármán, István Petróczy and Vilmos Zurovetz worked together on designing the helicopter. After many years of experimentation following the war, he built the Asbóth-helicopter. On September 9, 1928, witnessed by many foreign experts, his model “AH 1” helicopter ascended from a standing position vertically to a great height for the FIRST TIME IN THE WORLD.\n\nLiptrot from the British Air Ministry, who travelled on the helicopter, wrote in a Journal of the Aeronautical Society in 1931: the Asboth-helicopter ascends vertically with a remarkable speed… to any height where it can hover stationary for some time. It can be perfectly navigated. But the most remarkable is that, unlike other tested helicopters, this one remains absolutely stable around all axes…\n\nBÁNKI DÓNÁT (1859 – 1922) Invention: BÁNKI-CSONKA PETROL ENGINE, CARBURETOR, FRONTWHEEL RUNNING CAR, WATER TURBINE With JÁNOS CSONKA, creator of Hungarian automobile manufacturing\n\nDónát Bánki was born in Bánk and died in Budapest. He studied mechanical engineering in Budapest. From 1899 to his death he taught at the Technical University in Budapest.\n\nIn 1892, before Diesel, Dónát Bánki created the first great compression, low consumption gasoline engine, the Bánki-motor.\n\nIn 1892, Dónát Bánki and János Csonka invented the carburetor for their gasoline engine. Even though their invention went through some changes as time passed, every modification was based on this invention.\n\nIn 1917, Bánki invented the water turbine, which was useful for utilizing the energy of small and medium sized waterfalls.\n\nBAY ZOLTÁN\n\n(1900 – 1992)\n\nInvention:\n\nLUNAR – RADAR, GLOWING FLUORESCENT LIGHTS, DEVELOPER OF RADAR ASTRONOMY\n\nZoltán Bay was born in Gyulavár and died in Washington D.C. He studied in Debrecen, at the Pázmány Péter University of Sciences in Budapest, where he received his Ph.D. degree, and in Berlin. In 1930 he became professor of physics at the University of Szeged.\n\nZoltán Bay, the world renown physicist, was the first to perform the following experiment, as a research engineer of the Standard Factory in Budapest, in 1943: he sent ultra-short radio waves to the moon, which, reflected from there worked as a radar, and could be used to measure distance, as well as to study the moon.\n\nHe was engaged in the development of television as early as 1936.\n\nIn 1948, he left Hungary, and became professor of the Physics Department at the George Washington University in Washington. After he retired, he continued his research activity till the end of his life. It is unbelievable, that this great scientist didn’t receive a Nobel prize.\n\nTwo years before he died, he wrote his autobiography, titled Az élet erösebb (Life Is Stronger). His remains were buried in Gyulavár, the place of his birth.\n\nBÍRÓ LÁSZLÓ JÓZSEF\n\n(1899 – 1985)\n\nInvention:\n\nBALLPOINT PEN, AUTOMATIC SHIFT, STEAM POWERED WASHING MACHINE\n\nmore than 30 internationally recognized inventions\n\nJózsef László Bíró was born in Budapest and died in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He first studied medicine, but Biró was a many sided person. Between 1921 and 1938, he was a journalist, sculptor, painter, art critic, stock broker, hypnotizer, race-car driver, car salesman and of course an inventor.\n\nJózsef László Biró’s most famous invention was the ballpoint pen. By 1938, he had patented it in over 100 countries. Finally in 1948 the Parker Company bought his patent. In the USA it became known as the BIRÓ PEN.\n\nHis other important invention was the automatic gear shift. In 1932, he traveled with his engineer friend Rigó fromBudapest toBerlin (more than 1000 km = 625 mi) on a motorcycle with a sealed gear shift. General Motors bought his patent, just so the competition wouldn’t be able to buy it.\n\nBLÁTHY OTTÓ TITUSZ\n\n(1860 – 1938)\n\nInvention:\n\nTRANSFORMER, WATT METER\n\nOttó Titusz Bláthy, mechanical engineer, was born in Tata, and died in Budapest. He graduated from the Technical University in Vienna.\n\nHe invented the transformer with Miksa Déri and Károly Zipernowsky. At Blathy’s suggestion they constructed it with a closed iron core. At that time the transformer was the most important invention in electronics.\n\nBláthy had more than 100 inventions. He was the first to join the thermal power plant with the hydraulic power plant.\n\nAnother important invention of his was the Watt Meter, which was named after him. Many similar mechanisms existed, but only Bláthy’s worked. All Watt meters used today are based on his invention.\n\nCSONKA JÁNOS\n\n(1852 – 1939)\n\nInvention:\n\nCARBURETOR, AUTOMATIC TUBE IGNITION (for petrol engines), GAS ENGINE, MOTORTRICYCLE (for mailmen),GASOLINE MOTOR CAR\n\nCreator of the Hungarian automobile industry\n\nJános Csonka, inventor, was born in Szeged and died in Budapest. From 1875 he was head of the training shop at the Technical University in Budapest.\n\nIn 1879 he constructed a four-cycle gas engine according to his own ideas, which was the first Hungarian combustion engine.\n\nDuring 1892 and 1893 János Csonka and Dónát Bánki invented the carburetor for the Bánki-Csonka engine. Csonka and Bánki made new headways with the engines they constructed. They made Hungary independent from the solutions of foreign factories, which still struggled with ways inherited from steam engines.\n\nCsonka’s main expertise was engine manufacturing. Among many things, he invented the regulating mechanism for the inner combustion engines, a mechanism for forced automatic settings of the ignition for combustion engines. He also patented a portable chain saw equipment which could be disassembled for easy transportation.\n\nDÉRI MIKSA\n\n(1854 – 1938)\n\nInvention:\n\nTRANSFORMER, REPULSION MOTOR\n\nMiksa Déri was born in Bács and died in Merano. He acquired his diploma in mechanical engineering in Vienna.\n\nMiksa Déri, together with Ottó Bláthy and Károly Zipernowszky became world famous with the invention of the alternating electric transformer system. This system made it possible to send electric energy to great distances and divide it over large areas. Today, there is hardly any large energy producer, which isn’t based on this system. The experimentation was mainly done by Déri.\n\nHe had many other inventions also. The Déri-repulsion motor is one of them. With it, elevators could be safely used. This had not been achieved by any other type of motor until then.\n\nbáró EÖTVÖS LORÁND\n\n(1848 – 1919)\n\nInvention:\n\nGRAVITATIONAL TORSION BALANCE, EÖTVÖS UNIT OF GRAVITATION, LAW OF CAPILLARITY\n\nThe University of Science in Budapest was named after Baron Lóránd Eötvös.\n\nDr. Baron Loránd Eötvös, physicist, professor, minister of education, was born in Buda and died in Budapest. He completed his education in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nThe Torsion or Eötvös balance, designed by Baron Eötvös, is a sensitive instrument for measuring the density of underlying rock strata. The device measures not only the direction of force of gravity, but the change in the force of gravity’s extent in horizontal plane. It determines the distribution of masses in the earth’s crust. The Eötvös torsion balance, an important instrument of geodesy and geophysics throughout the whole world, studies the Earth’s physical properties. It is used for mine exploration, and also in the search for minerals, such as oil, coal and ores.\n\nEötvös’ law of capillarity served as a basis for Einstein’s theory of relativity.\n\n(Capillarity: the property or exertion of capillary attraction of repulsion, a force that is the resultant of adhesion, cohesion, and surface tension in liquids which are in contact with solids, causing the liquid surface to rise – or be depressed…)\n\nFONÓ ALBERT\n\n(1881 – 1972)\n\nInvention:\n\nJET, TORPEDOES\n\nDr. Albert Fonó was born and died in Budapest. He studied mechanical engineering at the József Technical University in Budapest and continued his studies abroad with a scholarship.\n\nHis theoretical work was many-sided, his main field was energetics.\n\nHis first invention – in 1915 – was an aerial torpedo which worked with jet propulsion and would have increased the effectiveness of artillery. Its significance was not recognized and understood by his time.\n\nIn 1923 he patented a new prototype of the gas boiler (furnace) and in 1928 an air compressor for mines.\n\nHis most important invention was a jet propulsion engine for supersonic aircrafts. After four years of preliminary examination, it was patented in Germany in 1932. With his invention he proved himself ahead of his time.\n\nHe became a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1954; from 1965 he was a corresponding member of the International Academy of Astronautics.\n\nGALAMB JÓZSEF\n\n(1881 – 1955)\n\nInvention:\n\nDESIGNER OF THE FORD MODEL-T CAR, PLANETARY GEARBOX, IGNITION PLUG, FORDSON TRACTOR\n\nJózsef Galamb was born in Makó Hungary and died in Detroit. He graduated in Budapest in mechanical engineering.\n\nJózsef Galamb, as the employee of the Ford Company, designed the famous Model-T car. He invented the planetary gearbox and the electrical ignition system (spark plug). At the same time, he designed the mass production of cars. The small Ford Company became a huge factory. In 19 years, they made 15 ½ million Model-T cars.\n\nJózsef Galamb also designed the elegant Model-A car.\n\nDuring World War I, he designed the Fordson tractor. The English government ordered 7000 pieces of this model. The farmers were very fond of this tractor because it was lighter than the other available tractors and handling it was also much easier. In 1925, more than half of the tractors made in theUSA were manufactured by the Ford Company.\n\nIRINYI JÁNOS\n\n(1817 – 1895)\n\nInvention:\n\nMATCHES\n\nJános Irinyi, a chemist, was born in Nagyléta and died in Vértes. He completed his education in Vienna and in Hohenheim, Germany.\n\nMany experimented with the lighting of fire, but they only came up with complicated and dangerous solutions. In 1836, Irinyi invented a match, which was neither dangerous, nor unhealthy.\n\nHe dissolved phosphorus in water and shook it in a glass foil, until it became granulated. He mixed the phosphorus with lead and gumiarabicum, poured the paste-like mass into a jar, and dipped the pine sticks into the mixture and let them dry. When he tried them that evening, all of them lighted evenly.\n\nHe had invented the MATCH!\n\nIstván Rómer, a rich Hungarian pharmacist living inVienna, bought the invention and production rights from Irinyi, the poor student, for 60 Forint. The production of matches began, and everybody was happy throughout the world. István Rómer became rich off Irinyi’s invention, but Irinyi himself died poor and abandoned in Vértes.\n\nJEDLIK ÁNYOS\n\n(1800 – 1895)\n\nInvention:\n\nELECTROMOTOR, DYNAMO\n\nDr. Ányos Jedlik, a Benedictine monk, scientist and inventor, was born in Szimö and died in Györ. He completed his education in Györ and Pest.\n\nIn 1828, 18 years before Siemens, Ányos Jedlik constructed the first electromotor in Györ. He invented the dynamo in 1861. He did not patent his inventions, nor did he sell them. He was satisfied with knowing that his machines worked. He taught his theories and inventions at the university in Hungary. However, the world didn’t know about them. Several years later, Siemens invented both of these machines, and both were named after him.\n\nThe first electromotor, built in 1828, and Jedlik’s operating instructions are kept at theMuseum ofApplied Arts inBudapest. The motor still works perfectly today.\n\nKANDÓ KÁLMÁN\n\n(1869 – 1931)\n\nInvention:\n\nPHASE-CHANGING ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE, ELECTRIFICATION OF RAILWAYS\n\nKálmán Kandó was born in Buda and died in Budapest. He studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Budapest. He was the pioneer of railway-electrification.\n\nKandó’s main invention is, that three-phase alternating current can be used for the hauling of large trains.\n\nHis most marvelous invention is the phase-changing electric locomotive, which was named Kandó-locomotive after him. The Kandó-locomotives are used in many countries of the world. This revolutionary invention transforms standard public utility (single-phase) current into three-phase alternating current in the locomotive and therefore makes it capable of hauling.\n\nThe electric railways in Northern Italy and the section of the Hungarian State Railways betweenBudapest-Hegyeshalom- Vienna (1929) were built based on Kandó’s invention.\n\nKÁRMÁN TÓDOR\n\n(1881 – 1963)\n\nInvention:\n\nFATHER OF SUPERSONIC FLIGHT, ARCHITECT OF THE SPACE AGE\n\nTódor von Kármán, a leading theoretician in aerodynamics, was born in Budapest and died in Aachen, Germany. After graduating in mechanical engineering at the Technical University in Budapest, he went to study in Göttingen on a scholarship. He received there his Ph.D. degree and became a professor till 1912.\n\nDuring World War I. he was chief of research in the aviation corps of the Austro-Hungarian army. There, with his colleagues he developed the world’s first military vehicle with rotating blades, the PKZ-type helicopter. After the war he was one of the founders of the German Luftwaffe and adviser to the Junkers airplane company.\n\nIn 1929, he was invited to the United States, and in 1930, became director of the Guggenheim Aeronautics Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. After World War II. he was one of the founders of the JET Propulsion Laboratory for space research. He was a scientific advisor worldwide in the fields of aerodynamics, aeroplane design, aeronautics, astronautic and space flight. Kármán had a leading role in the development of the B-36, B-47 and B-52 aircrafts, the Atlas, Titan and Minuteman rockets.\n\nAs recognition for his work craters on the Moon and Mars were named after him.\n\nKEMPELEN FARKAS\n\n(1734 – 1804)\n\nInvention:\n\nSPEAKING MACHINE recorded and imitated human speech; TYPEWRITER for the blind; STEAM TURBINE; ELEVATOR FOR PEOPLE for the palace of Schönbrunn; SELF-REGULATING PUMP for the fountains of Schönbrunn; CHESS AUTOMATON\n\nThis was his most peculiar invention, with which he astonished everyone. This machine defeated all the chess players of the world. Nobody could solve its secret. The chess playing machine was destroyed by fire in Philadelphia, and the way it worked remained a mystery forever.\n\nFarkas Kempelen, counsellor of the royal chancellery, mechanic, scientist, inventor, was born in Pozsony and died inVienna. He studied law and philosophy in Györ andVienna. His talents were extraordinarily versatile.\n\nPETZVAL JÓZSEF\n\n(1807 – 1891)\n\nInvention:\n\nACHROMATIC PORTRAIT LENS, DARK ROOM, PROJECTOR\n\nJózsef Miksa Petzval was born in Szepesbéla and died in Vienna. He became an engineer at the Institutum Geometricum in Pest and later received a Ph.D. degree in mathematics. He taught mathematics and mechanics at the Universities of Pest and Vienna.\n\nIn Petzval’s time, two French scientists invented photography. The luminosity of the optical lens was so weak that taking pictures of persons was impossible because it took at least 30 minutes. In 1840 Petzval designed a double lens, that reduced the time of taking a picture to seconds. The first lens was cut by Voigtländer, a German optician, according to the calculations and directions of Petzval. This lens made portrait photography possible and became the basis of the photographic industry.\n\nA large camera factory under the name of Voigtländer is still operating in Germany. Nobody mentions the name of Petzval. The same thing happened to him as to Ányos Jedlik.\n\nPetzval built the first dark room.\n\nPUSKÁS TIVADAR\n\n(1844 – 1893)\n\nInvention: TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, TELEPHONOGRAPH (Speaking Newspaper)\n\nTivadar Puskás was born in Pest and died in Budapest. He studied in Vienna. According to Edison “Tivadar Puskás was the first man in the world, who thought about a telephone exchange”.\n\nIn 1878, he built the first telephone exchange in Boston, then he built one in Paris and Budapest. On Bell’s telephone one person could talk to one other person only. Tivadar Puskás invented the multiple switch box, which made any number of phone users’ connection or disconnection possible.\n\nThe telephonograph (speaking newspaper) transmitted news and music programs, using the telephone network. From 1893, 20 years before the invention of the radio, people could listen to news and music inBudapest daily. They could enjoy direct broadcastings from the Opera house.\n\nSEMMELWEIS IGNÁC\n\n(1818 – 1865)\n\nHe discovered the CAUSE OF PUERPERAL (CHILD BED) FEVER: INFECTION! DISINFECTION WITH CHLORINATED WATER STOPS DEATH\n\nTHE SAVIOR OF MOTHERS!\n\nDoctor Ignác Semmelweis was born in Buda and died in Vienna. He studied in Pest and Vienna.\n\nInVienna, he worked in the maternity ward and saw in dismay how many mothers and children die during birth. He soon realized that the cause was infection, which the doctors spread from one mother to the next. He discovered that this could be stopped if doctors wash their hands with chlorinated water before they touch the mothers. The doctors working around him ridiculed him. In 1850 he went back toBudapest, where he became head physician of the maternity ward of theRokusHospital. By using his methods – hygiene – puerperal fever was almost completely eliminated in his clinic inPest.\n\n“After an autopsy, we must wash our hands, otherwise we spread poisonous death.” Dr. Ignác Semmelweis\n\nSZENT-GYÖRGYI ALBERT\n\n(1893 – 1986)\n\nInvention: ASCORBIC ACID or VITAMIN C\n\nAlbert Szent-Györgyi was born in Budapest and died in Woods Hole, MA, USA. He completed his studies in Hungary, Germany, Holland and England. He received his doctorate in medicine at the University of Science in Budapest and his second Ph.D. in chemistry in Cambridge. From 1930 to 1945 he was professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Szeged.\n\nAlbert Szent-Györgyi won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1937 for his discoveries in connection with the biological combustion process, especially in reference to vitamin C and the catalyst of fumaric acid. Szent-Györgyi discovered that vitamin C is abundant not only in citrus fruits but in Hungarian paprika as well.\n\nVitamin C has an important role in maintaining good health, such as strengthening the immune system, in the prevention of heart disease, certain forms of cancer, allergic symptoms, colds and influenza, etc.\n\nFrom 1947 until his death Szent-Györgyi lived and worked in theUnited States. He researched the biochemistry of muscular action and the causes of cell division. He also took active part in cancer research.\n\nZIPERNOWSKY KÁROLY\n\n(1853 – 1942)\n\nInvention:MULTI PHASE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, BAYONET-LOCKED LAMP SOCKET, COHERER\n\nKároly Zipernowsky was born in Vienna and died in Budapest. He started as a pharmacist. Later he graduated as a mechanical engineer in Budapest.\n\nHe invented the transformer together with Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri. They also developed the alternating current distribution system based on the transformer connected in parallel.\n\nThe coherer (radio conductor) was a vital component of the old radio. Coherer means: waves having a constant phase relationship.\n\nHe was fascinated with electrotechnology. As a student, he gave many lectures in this field. At age 25 he was invited by the CEO of the Ganz factory to organize the electrical department. Under his leadership, Ganz Villamossági Müvek became Europe’s first large-scale electrical factory, and soon after, it was recognized worldwide.\n\nZipernowsky was a many-sided inventor. He wrote a book: Saját és másokkal szabadalmaztatott találmányaim (My own and jointly patented inventions). In this book he describes 40 of his inventions.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhen Nobel Laureate, Enrico Fermi, nuclear physicist, was asked if he believed in extraterrestrials, he replied – „They are already here…they are called Hungarians!” Fermi’s Martians called Hungarians enriched the world with over a hundred thousand inventions, not to mention their countless scientific discoveries. Last year the Szent István Hungarian School published a booklet about a few Hungarian inventors and the list of Nobel Laureates of Hungarian descent as a class project. The booklet was so well received by the public that we decided to publish another one. The researched inventors and scientists included in this booklet do not even represent the tip of the iceberg, but we hope it will be informative and you will enjoy reading about them.\n\nIt was a difficult task for our 15 year old students to translate the complicated Hungarian texts into English. To do this, they had to master the Hungarian language, and this booklet proves that they passed the test remarkably well. And 15 year old Hungarians amaze us constantly. Gábor Bernáth, winner of the Philadelphia Science Olympics, invented the ScanGuru at age 15. This 3D scanner is able to copy stereoscopic forms into a computer and can be used in areas ranging from plastic surgery to shoe design. Two 15 year old Hungarian girls (mentioned in this booklet) are among the nine winners out of the 10,000 from 44 countries who participated in the Planetary Society’s competition… and the list goes on.\n\nWe are thankful to Andrea Veronika Benkö who did all the portrait drawings as a gift to the Hungarian School.\n\nWe are happy to serve our Hungarian Nation with this humble work in making people aware of a few of the many contributions the Hungarian genius gave to the world.\n\nPassaic, May 15, 2001 Emese Kerkay\n\nBARÉNYI BÉLA\n\n(1907 – 1997)\n\n.\n\nInventions:\n\nVOLKSWAGEN BEETLE\n\nPASSIVE SAFETY OF CARS\n\nSAFE STEERING WHEEL\n\nBéla Barényi, designing engineer, was born in Hirtenberg, Austria, and died in Sindelfingen, Germany. He studied in Hungary and Vienna. From 1939 he worked at Daimler Benz AG. He was the company’s head engineer from 1965 until his retirement in 1972.\n\nIn 1925, he designed the famous Volkswagen Beetle. Because Porsche was later credited with the invention (1938), Barényi took legal action. The German Courts and the State Patent Office in Mannheim acknowledged that Barényi had invented the concept and the main components of the Volkswagen. Barényi only asked for 1DM (one German Mark) as compensation.\n\nThe passive safety of cars was designed by Barényi as well. Out of his 2500 inventions for the automobile industry, dividing cars into three collision zones was the most significant one (1951). The rigid passenger cell is enclosed by deformable front and rear ends which absorb the impact of collision. In order to mass-produce his design he had to replace the rigid undercarriage with a floor plate, patented in 1943. Since 1959, Daimler Benz (and today every automobile company in the world) manufactures cars – acknowledged for their safety worldwide – based on Barényi’s design. Crash tests are also associated with his name.\n\nBarényi’s inventions completely changed the world’s automobile production. In recognition of his achievements he was admitted to the Automotive Hall of Fame in Detroit, USA. With his ideas he has saved the lives of millions on the roads.\n\nBARNÓTHY FORRÓ MAGDA\n\n(1904 – 1993)\n\nScientific discoveries:\n\nCOSMIC RADIATION\n\nBIOMAGNETISM\n\nMadeleine Forró Barnóthy, astrophysicist and university professor, was born in Zsámbok, Hungary, and died in Chicago, Illinois, USA. She studied in Budapest and Göttingen, Germany. In 1928 she was the first woman to earn a doctorate in physics in Hungary. From 1928 to 1948 she was a physics professor at the Budapest University. In 1948 she settled in the USA with Jenö Barnóthy, her husband and fellow scientist. First she taught physics at the Barat College in Lake Forest, Illinois. In 1955 both Barnóthy’s were asked to lead a company which manufactured radiological research instruments. At the same time (1953-1959) Madeleine Forró Barnóthy was also teaching physics at the University of Illinois.\n\nShe specialized in cosmic radiation, astro- and nuclear physics and biomagnetism. She was the author of over 150 scientific papers and editor of the two-volume book Biological Effects of Magnetic Fields (1964). Already in 1964 Dr. Madeleine F. Barnóthy determined that the magnetic field will in due time develop into a powerful new analytic and therapeutic tool of medicine. Her last scientific article concerning astronomy (What is Time?), co-written with husband Jenö Barnóthy, was published in 1991, two years before her death. She was a member of numerous American and international scientific associations.\n\nForró Barnóthy was a pioneer in the research of the phenomena of cosmic radiation, a prerequisite for conquering the universe.\n\nBÉRES JÓZSEF\n\n(1920 – )\n\nTalálmánya:\n\nBÉRES CSEPP\n\nInvention:\n\nBÉRES DROPS\n\nDr. József Béres, agro- and biochemist and cancer researcher was born in Záhony, Hungary. He completed his studies in Gödöllö, Keszthely and Budapest. In 1989 he founded the Béres RT (Corporation) and in 2000 the Béres Pharmaceutical Company. In 1992, he established the Béres Foundation for a Full Life, an organization helping the poor. Annually it distributes over 70 million Forints worth of products (1000 bottles of Béres Drops and other Béres products) to the needy.\n\nJózsef Béres invented the Béres Drops in the early 1970’s. This product is made of minerals, trace elements and organic nutrients, which strengthen the immune system and are essential to good health. His invention saved the lives of thousands of critically ill cancer patients. It eased the pain of those suffering from advanced forms of cancer and even cured malignant tumors. Since he wasn’t a licensed physician he didn’t accept any money for his Drops and soon became bankrupt. The communist government also harassed him, ransacking his laboratory and confiscating his research materials. But, because thousands of sick stood in line to obtain his medicine in Hungary, the government was forced to authorize the continuation of Béres’ research. Today millions take Beres Drops as a preventive medicine. According to Dr. Béres: “The progress and improvement of a sound world is unimaginable without the health of body and soul. We serve this purpose.”\n\nAs of January 27, 2000, the Béres Drops is registered as a medicine. Besides the Béres Drops he has many other patented inventions.\n\nBOLYAI FARKAS\n\n(1775 – 1856)\n\nScientific discoveries and invention:\n\nDEFINITION OF\n\nBOLYAI ALGORYTHM\n\nHEATING AND COOKING FURNACE\n\nFarkas Bolyai, mathematician, was born in Bolya and died in Marosvásárhely (Transylvania), Hungary. He studied in Nagyenyed, Kolozsvár (Hungary), Jena and Göttingen (Germany). From 1804, he was a teacher at the Marosvásárhely College. He could fluently read, write and speak eight languages. At the age of ten, he was able to find the cube root of 14-digit numbers mentally. Besides being a mathematician, he was interested in painting, music, drama, poetry, literature, astronomy, forestry…\n\nBecause of his isolated life, the scientific world did not take notice of his numerous mathematical discoveries. In his most well-known book TENTAMEN (1832) written in Latin, he published these independent discoveries. Yet his discoveries were attributed to others, who published these new theories years later.\n\nBolyai’s best known theorem defines two areas of the plane equal, if they can be partioned into a finite number of paired congruent sections. The so-called Bolyai-algorithm calculates the asymptotic solution of the equation xm=a+x with a series of roots.\n\nOne of Bolyai’s important inventions was the heating and cooking (baking) furnace, famous in Transylvania. It was extremely efficient in the heating and ventillation of rooms and even utilized the heat of waste gases.\n\nBOLYAI JÁNOS\n\n(1802 – 1860)\n\n.\n\nScientific discoveries:\n\nABSOLUTE GEOMETRY\n\nTHEORY OF RELATIVITY\n\nJános Bolyai, military engineer, philosopher and the most ingeneous mathematician of all time, was born in Kolozsvár, and died in Marosvásárhely, Transylvania. He began his education under the tutorage of his father Farkas Bolyai, and studied in Marosvásárhely, Kolozsvár and at the Military Academy of Engineering in Vienna. He spoke nine languages, Chinese and Tibetan included. Bolyai was the Austro-Hungarian royal and imperial army’s primary mathematician, violin virtuoso, fencer and dancer.\n\nIn 1823 Bolyai already informed his father in a letter about his Theory of Absolute Space: Out of nothing I have created a whole new world. He rejected Euclid’s parallel postulate. Bolyai’s discoveries introduced a new age in the history of geometry. He had solved a 2000 year old problem! His world-famous discovery was published as “Appendix” in his father’s book, Tentamen… Albert Einstein must have studied Bolyai’s discoveries before developing his theory of relativity in 1905. Bolyai writes regarding the relationship between the gravitational force field and geometrical space: The theory of gravitational space is also in close connection and continuation with the size, being and quality of space. Tibor Toro, physics professor wrote a 1000 word thesis on this statement proving that Bolyai had determined, before Einstein, the basis of the theory of relativity.\n\nThe recent study of the over 20,000 pages of his unpublished manuscripts kept in the Teleki Téka in Marosvásárhely (Transylvania) discloses Bolyai’s true genius.\n\nFEJES JENÖ\n\n(1877 – 1952)\n\nTalálmányai:\n\nInventions:\n\nPLATED ENGINES AND AUTOMOBILES\n\nJenö Fejes, automobile and motor designer, was born and died in Budapest. He completed his studies at the Technical School. He was the designing engineer of Westinghouse, France, from 1902-1909. From 1909 he lived and worked in Hungary. Fejes was instrumental in the development of the Hungarian automobile and airplane industry. He was the director of the Fejes Platemotor and Machine Factory.\n\nHis well-known invention is the Fejes plate-engine and automobile. The main characteristic of this invention was that all the heavy iron, steel and aluminum castings were replaced with cold-formed, pressed and torch- or spot-welded iron and steel plates. This technique was also used on the engine-house, steering gear, rear axel and the motor block. The dead weight of vehicles designed by Fejes was 30% to 35% lighter, and they were 20% less expensive. The operational safety of the motors was also increased, because in case of impact it was only dented rather than broken.\n\nIn 1927, Fejes founded The Fejes Patents Syndicate Ltd and the Ascot Motor and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. in England. However massproduction was prevented by the Austin factory, which controlled England’s car manufacturing industry. It viewed Fejes’ factory as a threat and was afraid that the success of the low-cost cars would harm Austin.\n\nFejes’ inventions were ahead of their time. They were put into practice, mainly in the USA, only from the 1970’s.\n\nGERGELY PÉTER\n\n(1936 – 1995)\n\nScientific discoveries:\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND USE OF\n\nREINFORCED CONCRETE\n\nCONSTRUCTION SAFETY IN\n\nEARTHQUAKE ZONES\n\nPéter Gergely, architect and structural engineer, was born in Budapest and died in Ithaca, New York. He completed his studies in Hungary, Canada and the United States and received his Ph.D. degree in 1963. For 32 years he was a professor at Cornell University. From 1983-88 he was chair of the Department of Structural Engineering and from 1985-88 director of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He fought as a University National Guard in the Hungarian Freedom Fight of 1956 and escaped to the US from the Soviet invasion.\n\nGergely’s research and discoveries, published in over 100 scientific papers, led to significant advancements in understanding the mechanics of reinforced and pre-stressed concrete and its application to building codes. He also made pioneering contributions in structural dynamics and earthquake engineering. His discoveries provided answers to many previous problems that occured in areas of moderate seismicity. His improved building codes for structures, especially nuclear plants in earthquake zones are used on a national level. Much of his discoveries were realized through the National Center for Earthquake Engineering which he helped found. He volunteered in many scientific associations and received six international awards.\n\nIn 1992, Gergely, a dedicated Hungarian, received an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Budapest for his international activities in the advancement of the construction industry and improvement of reinforced concrete.\n\nJENDRASSIK GYÖRGY\n\n(1898 – 1954)\n\nTalálmányai:\n\nInventions:\n\nGANZ-JENDRASSIK ENGINE\n\nGAS TURBINE\n\nGyörgy Jendrassik, mechanical engineer and inventor, was born in Budapest, Hungary and died in London, England. He completed his studies in Hungary and Germany and worked in the research department of the Ganz-Danubius Machine Factory.\n\nJendrassik patented the Ganz-Jendrassik engine in 1927. This was a high-speed, four-cycle Diesel-engine, without compression and with a mixing chamber. In his designs, Jendrassik took into full account the requirements of railway haulage: the engine should work with an appropriate torque at every speed. In railway operation the engine has to start immediately, even in cold weather. With his invention, Hungary began to use Diesel power in the railway system and the Danube-ocean shipping. His engine received a world patent and was manufactured in several countries.\n\nJendrassik built the world’s first usable, efficient, 100 horse powered gas turbine with its own furnace chamber. New about his invention was the method in which the various important elements, such as the compressor, the turbine and the heat exchanger were designed. The correct operation of these elements ensured higher efficiency. The periodical, Engineering (London), claimed that the Jendrassik turbine was the first of its kind to run consistently and satisfactorily.\n\nJendrassik’s merit was that he recognized the future of gas turbines in aviation, without which military or long-distance aviation is unimaginable. Jendrassik had nearly 100 accepted patents in Hungary and Great Britain.\n\nKABAY JÁNOS\n\n(1896 – 1936)\n\nInvention:\n\nEXTRACTION OF MORPHINE\n\nDIRECTLY FROM POPPY PLANTS\n\nJános Kabay, pharmaceutical chemist and inventor, was born in Büdszentmihály, Hungary and died in Budapest. He obtained his diploma at the University of Budapest in 1923.\n\nKabay researched the extraction of poppy alkaloids directly from the plant. Until then morphine was produced from opium. Kabay was the first in the world to succeed in producing morphine directly from the immature poppy plant. In 1925, he applied for a patent under the title Procedure for the production of opium alkaloids from immature poppy plants. Based on this patent, he founded the Alkaloida Chemical Plant in Büdszentmihály (today Tiszavasvári, Hungary) in 1927. He struggled with financial problems to maintain his plant for years. Despite these difficulties he continued his research and in 1932 he was able to extract morphine from dry trashed poppy straw using a new procedure. By this time the government acknowledged the significance of Kabay’s discoveries and provided financial support for his research of morphine production. Soon his plant satisfied the needs of the country and even manufactured morphine for export.\n\nIn 1934 he was invited by the Drug Control Committee of the League of Nations to Geneva to introduce his methods. Today, these methods are used throughout the world.\n\nKELP ILONA\n\n(1897 – 1970)\n\nMAGYAR MORFINGYÁRTÁS\n\nHUNGARIAN MORPHINE PRODUCTION\n\nIlona Kelp, chemist, was born in Hungary and died in Australia. She received her Ph.D. at the University of Budapest in 1923. SHer knowledge of chemistry was so outstanding that she was allowed to go to Géza Zemplén’s department at the Technical University of Budapest, where female students were accepted only in extraordinary cases.\n\nAfter completing her studies, she married János Kabay. Together they founded the Alkaloida Chemical Plant in Büdszentmihály (now Tiszavasvári). Ilona Kelp was Kabay’s equal in solving scientific and practical problems. After János Kabay’s death in 1936, she became the plant’s professional director. Consequently the League of Nations asked her to prepare the scientific description titled Classification of Morphine in Poppy-Straw Using János Kabay’s Method.\n\nIn 1997, for the 100th anniversary of her birth, Ilona Kelp’s portrait was placed in the Portrait Gallery of Famous Chemists. This is a permanent exhibition of Hungary’s Museum of Chemistry which displays the portraits of the most prominent chemists. Ilona Kelp is the first female chemist to be awarded a place in the Portrait Gallery.\n\nAlong with Kabay it is her merit that Hungarian morphine production came to be and that the Alkaloida Vegyészeti Gyár Rt (Chemistry Plant) was established.\n\nMIHÁLY DÉNES\n\n(1894 – 1953)\n\nInventions:\n\nSOUND MOTION PICTURE\n\nTELEBROADCASTING\n\nDénes Mihály was born in Gödöllö and died in Berlin (Germany). He earned his diploma in mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Budapest. At age 16 he wrote a book about automobiles (and motorcycles) which went through 8 editions.\n\nDuring his studies at the university he experimented with the concept of sound motion picture and telebroadcasting. In 1916 he completed successful experiments in this field, and is therefore regarded the inventor of sound motion picture. One of his most significant inventions in connection with the sound motion picture was the Projectophon, patented in 1918.\n\nAnother one of Mihály’s inventions, the Telehor (picture-telegraph), was able to transmit still pictures over distances of many kilometers. Since he wasn’t able to perfect his inventions in Hungary, he accepted the invitation of the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft in Berlin, where he could research under favorable conditions.\n\nIn 1928, at the Berlin Radio Show he presented the Nipkow-dial he had modified and applied semi-incandescent lamps as a light relay. On March 8, 1929, the Berlin-Witzleben radiostation broadcasted the first moving television program in history, based on Mihály’s patent. Mihály founded a company called TELEHOR AG to manufacture television sets. In 1935, he developed with physicist E.H. Traub the Mihály – Traub receiver with a revolving mirror.\n\nUnder Hitler’s rule he was sent to a concentration camp for hiding the persecuted. In 1953, he died from tuberculosis he acquired there.\n\nNÉMETHY GYÖRGY\n\n(1934 – 1994)\n\nScientific discoveries:\n\nEFFECT OF WATER ON PROTEIN STRUCTURE\n\nCONCEPT OF ALLOSTERIC EFFECTS\n\nON ENZYMES\n\nGyörgy Némethy, bio- and physical chemist, was born in Budapest and died in New York. He completed his studies in Hungary, Germany and the United States, earning a Ph.D. at Cornell University in 1962. He served both science and the youthmovement throughout his life.\n\nHis main field of research was the interaction of water and proteins. For his achievements in the study of Molecular interactions in Hydrogen-Bonding Solvents, in 1972 he received the Pius XI Gold Medal of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in recognition of his great merits as a scientist. Némethy helped develope the ECEPP computer program, which is used for determining the configuration of protein molecules. He acquired remarkable results in the field of calculating the atomic structure of collagens – the characteristic proteins of connective an supportive tissues. He introduced the concept of the allosteric effect.\n\nNémethy wrote close to 300 scientific articles, and is one of the most quoted authors in the field of biochemistry. He wrote, taught, lectured and researched in five languages in numerous universities in Europe and the US. From 1988 he was professor of Biomathematical Sciences at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Since 1994 the department has hosted the annual Némethy Memorial Symposium titled „Advances in Protein Folding”. It also offers a Némethy scholarship to candidates who work in his field.\n\nNémethy also devoted his life to the youth movement, passing on his love for nature, Hungarian language, culture and art. For 20 years he was president of the Hungarian Scout Association.\n\nOKOLICSÁNYI FERENC\n\n(1897 – 1954)\n\nTalálmányai:\n\nInventions:\n\nCONVEX MIRROR SCANNING SYSTEM\n\nCOLOR CATHODE RAY TUBE\n\nELECTRONIC SEED-SORTING DEVICE\n\nFerenc Okolicsányi, physicist and inventor, was born in Budapest, Hungary and died in London, England. He studied at the Technical University of Budapest and earned his Ph.D. in physics in Erlangen, Germany.\n\nBecause of the dire conditions in Hungary after World War I, Okolicsányi could not realize many of his significant inventions in practice. In 1926, he conducted research in Berlin, and worked in the field of television with Dénes Mihály. From 1936, he worked in London. He developed the convex mirror scanning system, and was able to produce high quality pictures on television using an ultrasonically generated liquid grid system. This system was used to project large pictures at the British Radio Show in 1938.\n\nAfter World War II, he worked on color television. His colored cathode ray tube, patented in the USA, was mass-produced. It preceded the Lorentz-tube.\n\nUntil his death, he was the chief engineer of a company in London which produced and sold his successful electronic seed-sorting device throughout the world.\n\nOkolicsányi was a significant pioneer of television.\n\nSELYE JÁNOS\n\n(1907 – 1982)\n\nTudományos felfedezései:\n\nSTRESSZ FOGALMA\n\nSTRESSZHATÁS\n\nSelye János, orvos, biokémikus és fiziológus, Bécsben, Ausztria, született és Montrealban, Kanada, halt meg. Tanulmányait Komáromban, Prágában, Párizsban és Rómában végezte. Prágában doktorált. 1931-ben ösztöndíjasként Amerikába került. 1941-töl a montreali McGill francia egyetem tanszékvezetö professzora. 1945-töl saját intézetének, az Institut de Medicine et de Chirurgie Expérimentale igazgató-tanára. 10 nyelven tartotta elöadásait. Élete folyamán 9 ország egyeteme avatta díszdoktor-rá, és 110 Akadémia hívta meg tagjai közé.\n\nKutatásai alapján felismerte és 1936-ban megfogalmazta, hogy mi a stressz. A sokféle nyomasztó tényezöt stressz-sornak nevezte el, felismerve ezek kóros, megbetegítö hatását. Ezáltal számos betegség teljesen újszerü módszerekkel vált gyógyíthatóvá. Ezek közé tartozik a szívinfarktus, agyvérzés, erek megkeményedése, bizonyos fajta vérnyomások, vesebaj, izületi gyulladás, gyomorfekély és bizonyos fokig a rák. Sokéves stresszkutatásainak eredményeit és nézeteit Életünk és a stress címü dolgozatában foglalta össze. Kifejti, hogy az élölények minden káros behatásra fiziológiai reakciók azonos sorozatával válaszolnak, s ez az általános alkalmazkodási tünetegyüttes.\n\nSelyének, a stressz elmélet atyjának, több tucat könyve és több száz tudományos dolgozata jelent meg 10 nyelven. Selye résztvett a számítógépes orvosi-adatbank rendszerének kifejlesztésében is.\n\nScientific discoveries:\n\nCONCEPT OF STRESS\n\nEFFECTS OF STRESS\n\nHans (János) Selye, physician, biochemist and physiologist, was born in Vienna, Austria and died in Montreal, Canada. He studied in Komárom (Hungary), Paris, Rome and Prague, where he received his Ph.D. He came to America on a scholarship in 1931. From 1941 to 1945, he held a professorship at McGill French University in Montreal, Canada. From 1945 he was director-professor of his own school, the Institut de Medicine et de Chirurgie Expérimentale. He lectured in ten languages, and received honorary doctorates from universities of nine countries. 110 academies invited him to be a member.\n\nBased on his research, Selye recognized and in 1936 defined the concept of stress. He named the many depressing factors stress-series, realizing their harmful effects and their potential to cause disease. This revolutionary concept opened up entirely new methods to cure illnesses such as coronary trombosis, brain hemorrage, hardening of arteries, certain types of blood pressure, kidney failure, arthritis, peptic ulcers and, to a certain degree, even cancer. He summarized the result of his many years’ research in a dissertation titled The Physiology and Pathology of Exposure to Stress. From his observations, he derived his concept of a common reaction mechanism in response to the most varied type of injury and called this the general adaptation syndrome.\n\nSelye, the father of stress theory, published dozens of books and hundreds of scientific papers in 10 languages. He helped develop the computer system based medical data banks.\n\nTELKES MÁRIA\n\n(1900 – 1995)\n\nTalálmányai:\n\nNAPENERGIA HASZNOSÍTÁSA\n\nNAPENERGIÁVAL FÜTÖTT HÁZ\n\nVÍZ SÓTALANÍTÁSA NAPENERGIÁVAL\n\nTelkes Mária, tudós, tanár, feltaláló, Budapesten született és halt meg.

She completed her studies in Hungary and obtained her Ph.D. in physical chemistry at the University of Budapest. In 1924, she traveled with her uncle, the Hungarian Consul, to Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nIn Professor Dr. George W. Cryle’s biophysical laboratory in Cleveland, she demonstrated that the prepared surface of the brain gives off infrared rays. To measure this, she developed an extremely sensitive detector and an infrared camera. From 1939, as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she researched the utilization of solar power. Based on her design, the first house heated with solar energy was built in 1948. By building several more sun houses, Telkes called attention to the study of solar energy. From 1950 she was the Institute’s director of research. Her important, patented method for the desalinization of salt water utilizing solar power was used in the tropics. The heat storage equipment designed by Telkes is able to store heat energy for an extended amount of time. Telkes discovered how to store cold as well, using the principles of heat storage. A patent, received at age 90, dealt with new possibilities for the storage of cold.\n\nTelkes obtained over 20 patents, and had written over 100 scientific articles. She received 12 international awards.\n\nTIHANYI KÁLMÁN\n\n(1897 – 1947)\n\nTalálmányai:\n\nIKONOSZKÓP\n\nROBOTREPÜLÖGÉP (TORPEDÓ)\n\nTihanyi Kálmán, fizikus, feltaláló, Üzbégen született és Budapesten halt meg. Tanulmányait Pozsonyban és Budapesten végezte.\n\nTihanyi elöször 1926-ban, majd 1928-ban szabadalmaztatta a távolbalátásnál (televízió) használt ikonoszkopot. Ez a korszerü képcsö elöfutára. Az ikonoszkóp egy nagyteljesítményü töltéstároló képfelvevö csö (elektróda). 1929-ben, francia és angol szabadalmában a képfelvevö csönél a toldalékcsövet alkalmazta. Ez tette lehetövé a képoldalon való letapogatást, ami a korszerü ikonoszkóp alapkövetelménye.\n\nHosszú ideig nem ismerték el Tihanyi találmányának elsöbbségét, annak ellenére, hogy az Amerikai Szabadalmi Hivatal elutasította Zworykin 1930-ban és 1931-ben bejelentett találmányát Tihanyi elsöbbségére hivatkozva. Tihanyi két amerikai szabadalmat kapott 1928-ban. Ma már kezdik elismerni, hogy ez a nagyjelentöségü találmány a magyar feltalálótól származik.\n\n1929-töl televízió irányítású légvédelmen dolgozott. Elkészítette a pilóta nélküli – robotrepülögép – prototípusát az angol Légügyi Minisztérium és az olasz haditengerészet részére.\n\n1940-ben elkészítette az elözö években kidolgozott 5-8 km hatótávolságúra tervezett ultrahang sugárzó készülék prototípusát, káros rovarok kiirtására . Számos más találmánya is volt.\n\nInventions:\n\nICONOSCOPE\n\nTORPEDO\n\nKálmán Tihanyi, physicist and inventor, was born in Üzbég, Hungary and died in Budapest. He studied in Pozsony and Budapest.\n\nTihanyi patented the iconoscope used for television first in 1926, then in 1928. The predecessor of the modern picture tube, the iconoscope is a high efficiency charge storing electrode. In his 1929 English and French patents, he applied the lengthening tube with the electrode. This made possible the scanning on the picture side, which is the basic requirement for the modern iconoscope.\n\nFor a long time, his invention’s precedence was not acknowledged, even though the American Patent Office refused Zworykin both in 1930 and 1931, aluding to the precedence of Tihanyi’s invention; Tihanyi had received two American patents in 1928. People are now starting to acknowledge that this significant discovery was invented by a Hungarian.\n\nFrom 1929, Tihanyi worked on a television guided arial defense system. He developed the prototype of the torpedo for the British Royal Airforce and the Italian navy.\n\nIn 1940 he completed his prototype of the ultrasound radiating device, developed a few years earlier. This device had a range of 5-8 km and was used for the extermination of harmful insects.\n\nHe also had numerous other inventions.\n\nZEMPLÉN GÉZA\n\n(1883 – 1956)\n\nTudományos felfedezései:\n\nZEMPLÉN-FÉLE ELSZAPPANOSÍTÁS\n\nZEMPLÉN-FÉLE CUKORLEBONTÁS\n\nZemplén Géza, kémikus, Trencsénben született és Budapesten halt meg. Tanulmányait Magyarországon végezte. 1904-ben doktorált a budapesti tudományegyetemen. Két évig állami ösztöndíjjal Berlinben az enzimek kémiáját kutatta. 1913-ban megbízták az ország elsö szerves kémiai tanszékének vezetésével és megszervezésével a budapesti Müegyetemen. Jelentös szerepe volt Magyarország szerves vegyiparának kialakításában.\n\nKutatásainak fö eredményei a cukoracetátok nátriumetilátos szappanosítása, az új Zemplén-féle cukorlebontó módszer kidolgozása, a higanyacetátós módszerrel több glükozid szerkezetének felderítése és szintetizálása. Az I. világháború alatt a Chinoin gyár kémiai tanácsadója lett és ipari problémákkal kezdett foglalkozni.\n\nTöbb mint 200 tudományos írása föként a cukrok kémiájával foglalkozik. Fejlett biokémiai szemléletére utal 1915-ben megjelent könyve: Az enzimek és gyakorlati alkalmazásuk. Halála elött megírta Szerves kémia címü könyvét.\n\nO. Th. Schmidt a következöképpen jellemzi Zemplén Gézát: Ha egész kutatómunkásságát áttekintjük, a kísérletek mesterének, az élesen megfigyelö és energikusan összefoglaló kémikusnak és fáradhatatlan akaraterejü embernek képe bontakozik ki elöttünk. …a fö súlyt egyértelmüen a tiszta cukorkémiára helyezte. Ebben van Zemplén kutatói jelentösége, itt fejlesztette ki a nevéhez füzödö maradandó módszereit.\n\nScientific discoveries:\n\nZEMPLÉN SAPONIFICATION\n\nZEMPLÉN SUGAR DECOMPOSITION\n\nGéza Zemplén, chemist, was born in Trencsén and died in Budapest. He completed his studies in Hungary, earning a Ph.D. at the Budapest University of Sciences in 1904. For two years he researched the chemistry of enzymes in Berlin on a scholarship. In 1913 he was asked to organize and chair Hungary’s first Organic Chemistry Department at the Technical University. He played a vital role in the establishment of the organic chemical industry of Hungary.\n\nHis major accomplishments include the developement of a method for the saponification of acetylized carbohydrates whith sodium metylate, the new method for the Zemplén sugar decomposition, and the determination of the structure and synthesis of several glycosides using the mercury acetate technique. He began dealing with industrial problems During World War I, when he became advisor in chemistry for Chinoin, the major chemical plant of Hungary.\n\nHis more than 200 scientific articles deal mainly with the chemistry of carbohydrates. His book, Enzymes and their Practical Application, published in 1915, shows his advanced biochemical insight. Shortly before his death he wrote another book, Organic Chemistry.\n\nO.Th. Schmidt’s portrait of Zemplén was: If we consider the entire field of his research efforts, the picture of a mastermind of experimentation, a sharp-eyed, energic and comprehensive chemist, and a man of indefatigable will power emerges …Zemplén always emphasized pure sugar chemistry. It is this that represents his importance in research, this is where he developed these methods, which made him famous.\n\nZSOLNAY VILMOS\n\n(1828 – 1900)\n\nTalálmányai:\n\nPORCELÁNFAJANSZ\n\nFAGYÁLLÓ PIROGRÁNIT\n\nEOZIN\n\nZsolnay Vilmos kerámikusmüvész, nagyiparos, Pécsett született és halt meg. Festészetet tanult Bécsben, majd 1853-tól édesapja Zs. Miklós által alapított gyár vezetését vette át. Magánúton kémiát, technológiát tanult. Újításaival a modern kerámia úttöröje lett.\n\nSokoldalú kerámiagyárrá fejlesztette ki a családi üzemet. Rendszeresen vizsgálta és kisérletezett a környék agyagjaival. Az edénydíszítést müvészi színvonalra emelte. Az 1878-as párizsi világkiállításon bemutatta újonnan kifejlesztett porcelánfajansz-nak nevezett díszedényeit, melyek teljesen különböztek az addig ismert agyagáruktól. Az elefántcsont színü cserépen ólommentes mázat használt. A díszítésnél a színezett máz a harmadik égetésnél kissé beolvadt az alapmázba. Ezzel a technikával Zsolnay, a müvész, a legfinomabb díszítesre volt képes, sok alkotása olyan mint egy olajfestmény.\n\nZsolnay feltalált egy új épületkerámiát, a faragható, fagyálló pirogránit-ot, mely Magyarország számos híres épületét díszíti (Mátyás templom, kassai dóm, vajdahunyadi vár, országház, iparmüvészeti múzeum, stb.).\n\nA pécsi kerámiagyár híressége még a több színben játszó – piros, zöld, kék és egyéb – fémfényü eozin máz, melyet Wartha Vince müegyetemi tanárral együtt dolgozott ki Zsolnay.\n\nZsolnay halálakor, 1900-ban, ez a családi gyár sikeres volt a kerámia gyártás minden területén.\n\nInventions:\n\nPORCELAIN FAIENCE\n\nPYROGRANITE\n\nEOSIN\n\nVilmos Zsolnay, ceramic artist, industrialist, was born and died in Pécs, Hungary. He studied painting in Vienna and in 1853 he took over the company his father Miklós Zs. had founded. He studied chemistry and technology on his own. With his innovations he became the pioneer of modern ceramics.\n\nZsolnay developed the family industry into a many-faceted ceramic factory. He regularly examined and experimented with the clays of the region. He brought the decorating of ceramics to an artistic level. At the Paris World Exhibition of 1878, he introduced his newly developed decorative porcelain faience, which was completely different from other known clay products. He used a lead-free glaze on ivory colored pottery. In the process of decorating, the colored glaze melted slightly into the base glaze at the third firing. With this technique, Zsolnay, the artist, was able ot make the finest decoration; many of his creations were like oilpaintings.\n\nZsolnay invented a new building-ceramic, the carvable, frostproof pyrogranite, which decorates many of Hungary’s famous buildings (Mátyás Church, Parliament, Museum of Applied Arts, St. Erzsébet Dom of Kassa, Castle of Vajdahunyad).\n\nThe Ceramic Factory in Pécs is also famous for its iridescent metallic Eosin maze, which Zsolnay codeveloped with Vince Wartha, a professor at theTechnicalUniversity. At the time of Zsolnay’s death in 1900, his family factory was successful in all fields of manufacture.\n\nHUNGARIAN NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS\n\nRóbert Bárány (1876-1936) – 1914\n\n(Medicine)\n\nFor his work on the physiology and pathology of the vestibular apparatus\n\nGeorge von Békésy (1899-1972) – 1961\n\n(Medicine)\n\nFor his discoveries concerning the physical mechanisms of stimulation within the cochlea.\n\nDennis Gábor (1900-1979) – 1971\n\n(Physics)\n\nFor his investigation and development of holography.\n\nJános Harsányi (1920- ) – 1994\n\n(Economics)\n\nFor his pioneering analysis of equilibrium in the theory of non-cooperative games.\n\nGeorge de Hevesy (1885-1966) – 1943\n\n(Chemistry)\n\nFor his pioneering work with radioactive isotopes as tracers.\n\nFülöp von Lenárd (1862-1947) – 1905\n\n(Physics)\n\nFor studies in x-rays and the cathode ray tube.\n\nGyörgy Oláh (1927- ) – 1994\n\n(Chemistry)\n\nFor the study of hydrocarbons, the ingredients of oil and natural gas, and his discovery of new ways to use them.\n\nJános Polányi (1927- ) – 1986\n\n(Chemistry)\n\nFor his work on chemical reaction dynamics.\n\nIsidor Rabi (1898-1988) – 1944\n\n(Physics)\n\nFor his resonance method for recording the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei.\n\nLeopold Ruziczka (1887-1976) – 1939\n\n(Chemistry)\n\nFor his work on polymethylenes and higher terpenes.\n\nAlbert Szent-Györgyi von Nagyrápolt (1893-1986) – 1937\n\n(Medicine)\n\nFor his discoveries in connection with the biological combustion process with special reference to vitamin C and the catalysis of fumaric acid.\n\nElie Wiesel (1928- ) – 1986\n\n(Peace)\n\nFor his dedication to peace, atonement, and human dignity.\n\nEugene Wigner (1902-1995) – 1963\n\n(Physics)\n\nFor research on the structure of the atom and its nucleus.\n\nRichard Zsigmondy (1865-1929) – 1925\n\n(Chemistry)\n\nFor his work on methods in the study of colloid chemistry.\n\nAt the age of 13, Lugosi ran away from home to become an actor, but instead found himself working in the mines at Resicabanya (nowResita,Romania), located about 200 miles south of Lugos.\n\nAt about the age of 17, he moved to Szabadka (now Subotica, Vojvodina, after Serbian annexation). He lived with his sister and widowed mother and went to work in the railway yard.\n\nIt was in Szabadka that Lugosi got his first opportunity on the stage – as a chorus boy in an operetta, which was produced in the Nepszinhaz, or People’s Theatre.\n\nBy 1903, Lugosi was appearing at the Ferenc Jozsef Szinhaz (FranzJosephTheatre) in Temesvar, the capital of Lugosi’s home province of theBanat.\n\nIn 1914, he enlisted in the Hungarian army. He was discharged in 1916 after convincing officials that he was “mentally unstable.” Not soon after, he was married to Ilona Szmik on June 25, 1917. It was also during this time that he began appearing in movies. His first picture was A Leopárd, in which he played the lead role.\n\nHe emigrated to the United States of Americain December of 1920 with the Treaty of Trianon in which virtually all of the towns he lived and worked in, including his birthplace, were awarded to other countries.\n\nHis first American film was 1923’s The Silent Command, a suspenseful spy movie in which Bela played the bad guy. He officially became a US citizen on June 26, 1931. He took on the role of Count Dracula in Horace Liveright’s play in place of actor Raymond Huntley in 1929. It played for 33 weeks on Broadway, and also toured the entire West Coast. Soon after, the rights to play were picked up by Universal Studios. Universal wanted Lon Chaney, Sr. to play the lead role, but Chaney died of throat cancer in 1930. It wasn’t until after Chaney’s death that Bela was even considered for the part of Count Dracula.

Oct. 22, 1811 – Doborján, Hungary (AKA, Raiding after Austrian annexation); d. July 31, 1886 – Bayreuth, Germany)\n\nClassical Composer, “Greatest Pianist of All Time“A truly monumental composer. From the Franz Liszt Page: “Franz Liszt has emerged as one of the most awe-inspiring figures in all of music history. Regarded as the greatest pianist of all time, who outplayed such greats as Chopin and Thalberg, his genius extended far beyond the piano to expand musical composition and performance well beyond its 19th Century limitations. His unique compositions bewildered, inspired and inflamed the imaginations of his own era, yet quite miraculously he also laid the seeds for a series of schools that would flourish in the near and distant future. Namely, the Late Romantic, Impressionist and Atonal schools. For this Liszt is unique, and his immense-influence… monumental. He invented the symphonic poem, a new and elastic single-movement form, which many subsequent composers, like Richard Strauss & Saint-Saëns, embraced and is at the core of much contemporary and even popular music forms today.”- For a short biography and zipped MIDI files, see The Classical Music Page or Visit The Franz Liszt Page.\n\n– You can hear MIDI recordings of many Liszt favorites at the Classical Music Archive.\n\n– The American Liszt Society maintains an excellent site with numerous links as well as a list of “Liszt Medal of Excellence” recipients.\n\n– For those of you interested in studying music, visit the Ferenc Liszt Academy of MusicinBudapest.

Tony Curtis\n\nOscar-Nominated Actor, Artist, and Hollywood Legend!The COOLESTcat ever to graceHollywood! The son of a Hungarian immigrant (who had been an amateur actor inBudapest), Curtis was involved with street gangs as a child, but eventually joined the Navy during World War II. Upon his release, he used the GI educational program to study drama atNew York’s Dramatic Workshop. While playing the lead in a production of “Golden Boy,” a Universal talent scout spotted him and Bernie Schwartz was signed to a seven-year contract (starting at $100 a week). His name was changed to “Anthony Curtis.” He started his career at the movies in 1949. Tony has been called by critics, “The World’s Favorite Movie Actor.” Star of 106 films, including “The Defiant Ones,” in 1958 (Oscar Nomination!), “Some Like it Hot” with Marilyn Monroe in 1959, “Trapeze,” “Spartacus,” “the Great Race,” “Sweet Smell of Success” and “The Boston Strangler,” in 1968. He also played the title role in a film about his fellow countryman, Houdini with his first wife, Janet Leigh, with whom he fathered the beautiful Jamie Lee Curtis. My favorite Tony quote:\n\n“What’s the secret to a long and happy life? Young women’s saliva!”\n\nAs an artist, he has won international acclaim. From his site: “His bright acrylic canvases, which have been compared to Matisse, assemblages, collages and boxes are in the private collections of Billy Wilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Frank and Kathy Lee Gifford, Lew Wasserman, Frank Sinatra, Arsenio Hall, Walter Mathau, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. Tony’s originals are also on display at the Butler Institute of American Art, the Naval Base at Pearl Harbor, The Toronto Museum,NationalHungarianMuseum, Harrods Department Store, Spago Restaurant, The Navy Memorial, The Mirage inLas Vegas, and the Caitlyn Gallery inSt. Louis.”\n\nTony writes about his painting on the right:\n\n“My father and mother were Hungarian. When I was a young boy, my father regaled me with stories of the Hungarian countryside and gypsies. Living and growing up inNew York City, I felt like a gypsy in that huge metropolis.

July, 1954)\n\nAcclaimed Artist and Mexican Icon: One of the most influential artists of the middle twentieth centuryShe was bornMagdalenaCarmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón. Her father, Guillermo Kahlo, was a Jewish Hungarian immigrant photographer who had been born inGermany. Her mother, Matilde Calderon, was a Catholic Mexican whose origins were Spanish and Native American. She died when Frida Kahlo was in her twenties. Frida Kahlo suffered from polio when she was six. Nevertheless she was very tomboyish which won her father’s favor. It was not common for girls to go to school at that time inMexico, but her father had advanced ideas and in 1922 he sent her to the Preparatoria (NationalPreparatory School) which was the most prestigious educational institution inMexico. The school had only just started taking girls, and Frida Kahlo was one of only 35 girls out 2000 pupils. It was at school where she met her future husband Diego Rivera who was fulfilling a mural painting commission there.In 1925 when she was 18 she was in a bus which collided with a tramcar causing serious injuries to her leg and pelvis. The accident destroyed her dream of becoming a doctor and affected the rest of her life. During her convalescence she started painting and sent some of her work to Diego Rivera. They would marry in August 1929. She shared his faith in communism and passionate interest in the indigenous cultures ofMexico. Rivera encouraged Kahlo in her work, extolling her as authentic, unspoiled and primitive, and stressing the Indian aspects of her heritage. During this period “Mexicanismo,” the fervent embrace of pre-Hispanic Mexican history and culture, gave great currency to the notion of native roots.The suffering of women is a constant theme in her sometimes shocking pictures. The Frida Kahlo Museumwas opened in her house in Coyoacán in 1958.Nicolas Muray (1892-1965) was a close friend and lover of Frida Kahlo. The Hungarian-born photographer’s celebrity portraits appeared regularly in Vanity Fair and Harper’s Bazaar. He also took numerous photographs of Kahlo and purchased many of Kahlo’s paintings, helping her financially while she was struggling during her brief eleven-month divorce from Rivera. She was having an affair with Muray when she and Rivera filed for divorce in 1939; although it is unclear whether the cause of the separation was Kahlo’s or Rivera’s infidelity. These intimate letters attest to Kahlo’s close relationship with Muray.\n\nSalma Hayek portrays her in theHollywoodfilm on Frida’s life.\n\n– Read more about her\n\nMariska Hargitay – (b. 1/23/64, Los Angeles)\n\nActressThe beautiful and talented daughter of Jayne Mansfeild and Mickey (Miklós) Hargitay, and a wonderful actor in her own right.

He left his home at an early age and grew up inEnglandin the care of an uncle, thus avoiding the Japanese occupation of the islands. Influences from his colorful background manifest themselves in music of a distinctive character. Inherent in his individual musical language are the intervals derived from pentatonic scales which he absorbed as a boy from the local gamelan music of Java and from the Hungarian heritage of his mother, a gifted pianist and accompanist. These melodic derivations, with their harmonic resonances, give rise to an exotic and often heightened emotional intensity in his music.At the age of 17, Schurmann volunteered for active wartime flying duty in the Dutch 320 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. In addition to his operational duties in Coastal Command, he was invited by the British Council to give piano recitals and make recordings for the troops. At the end of the war, Schurmann combined his by now busy concert career as a pianist with the position of acting Cultural Attaché at the Netherlands Embassy inLondon. He later became resident orchestral conductor at Dutch Radio. At the end of his contract, he returned toEnglanddetermined to devote his life mainly to composition, henceforth limiting his conducting activities to guest appearances. As a composer, Schurmann found himself able to earn a living by writing music for films.In 1980, he was invited by the U.S. State Department to tour orchestras and universities in the United States, a five months visit also partly sponsored by the British Council. In 1981, he moved to the USA, where he settled in the Hollywood Hills, California. He continued to receive many commissions for concert works and became associated with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. He scored many films and won Oscars for his orchestration of Lawrence of Arabia and Exodus. He also received two Oscar nominations (The Two-Headed Spy, and The Ceremony).Trivia:\n\nHe was invited to choreograph to music the Fountains of Bellagio, the most ambitious WET Design water feature to date.\n\n– See Gerard Schurmann.com\n\nRachel Weisz – b. 3/7/71, London\n\nActress and ModelFilm credits include: The Mummy, The Mummy II, Enemy at the Gates, Stealing Beauty, Chain Reaction, Swept from the Sea, Sunshine, Beautiful Creatures.Rachel studied English at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

He single-handedly created the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT and turned it into an internationally acclaimed program for the development of the finest in late 20th-century art. His work will endure for many centuries to come,” said Alan Brody, associate provost for the arts.Kepes studied painting at theSchoolofArtsinBudapest. The horrors of World War I convinced him that “only film could bring into a single focus my joy in the visual world and the social goals to be realized in this world,” he wrote. In 1930 he went toBerlin, collaborating on film, stage and exhibitions, and graphic design with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, one of the principals in the Bauhaus movement. Kepes came to the United States in 1937 as head of the Light and Color Department of the Institute of Design in Chicago, then known as the New Bauhaus. He joined MIT in 1946 as associate professor of visual design, becoming a full professor in 1949. He was appointed Institute Professor in 1970. Kepes founded the Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) in 1967 and served as its director until 1972.In addition to his career as an artist and an educator, Kepes was a prolific author. He published “The Language of Vision,” a summary of educational ideals and methods, in 1944; “The New Landscape in Art and Science” in 1956, and the seven-volume “Vision and Value” series in 1965 and 1966. Throughout his career, Kepes continued working as a designer, producing both small and large-scale works. The First andSecondChurchinBostoncommissioned him to make stained glass windows, and he designed a window and all sculpture for a church inJapan.

His father was an iron puddler by trade. Stefan was the second of three sons and a daughter. He began playing piano and oboe at age eight. While attending college on a music (and basketball) scholarship, he played Oboe and English Horn with the Detroit Civic Symphony and also played Tenor & Bass Saxophone in dance bands to work his way through school. He got his start when he became staff announcer at a Detroitradio station and later on the NBC radio network. He was always more interested in writing and production than in performing. While an announcer, he wrote episodes of The Lone Ranger (1940), The Green Hornet, and a psycho-thriller Hermit’s Cave. After serving 37 months as commanding officer of PT 328 during WWII, and surviving being wounded twice, he returned to CBS Radio as a Staff Director and Writer in New York and Chicago.

By means of his work as a filmmaker and producer, Ivan brought the underwater world home to millions via television and movies. He is the man who created Sea Huntin the 1960s, but even back in 1958 he was innovating underwater cinematography with features like “Underwater Warrior.” Another milestone in Tors’ career was the 1960s TV series “Flipper,” forever endearing the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin to Homo sapiens. Other Ivan Tors productions included “Namu, the Killer Whale,” “Around the World Under the Sea,” and “Hello Down There.” Other television series created by Ivan Tors during the 1970s included “The Aquarians,” “Primus,” and “Salty.” By means of his creative cinematography and innovative narrative, Ivan Tors communicated his vision of the sea to so many when so few knew what wonders lie beneath the sea. Tors also handled underwater sequences for the early Bond films such as “Thunderball.”Inducted into the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame. Though he worked extensively with captive dolphins and other animals, he spent much of his later years campaigning against dolphin captivity…- See his filmography here Peter Lorre – (born Lászlo Loewenstein, 6/26/1904 Rozsahegy [Rosenberg], Hungary, d. 3/23/1964)\n\nActor: Chaplin called him “the greatest actor alive“Superstar of Horror film classics, some with countryman Bela Lugosi, as well as acclaimed supporting roles in “Casablanca,” the “Maltese Falcon,” and “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.” Born in Rozsahegy, Hungary (now Ruzomberok, Slovakia after the Treaty of Trianon), his grandfather was a rabbi and his father, Alois Loewenstein, was a middle-class landowner. After the family fortune was decimated by the 1919 Hungarian Communist revolution, Alois relocated his family inVienna and attempted to settle his son into a respectable career as a banker. “Laczy,” however, was determined to become an actor, and spent much of the 1920s learning his trade in various small theatrical companies. In 1928, at the recommendation of his mentor Jacob Moreno, he adopted the stage name Peter Lorre. During the late 1920s and early 1930s Lorre made an impression in the art theaters ofBerlin. In 1931 Lorre had a phenomenal success with his first film appearance as a serial killer in Fritz Lang’s thriller “M,” now considered a classic of German cinema. Peter Lorre’s performance in M remains one of the greatest in the history of cinema.Almost as quickly as he achieved world-wide fame, Lorre became typecast. In spite of his diminuitive size, Lorre became synonymous with dread. Fleeing the Nazi machine, Lorre leftGermanyin 1933, landing inEngland, where Alfred Hitchcock exploited his image by casting him in is first English-speaking role as the head of a ring of kidnappers who menace young Nova Pilbeam in The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934). He then relocated to southernCalifornia, and, for better or worse, settled in as a permanent resident ofHollywood’s star colony. Two years later Hitchcock cast him in a similar role in Secret Agent. For Mad Love (1935), his first American film and a rare foray into horror for MGM, Lorre’s head was shaved, further emphasizing his bulging eyes and giving him a slick, reptilian appearance. In his secondHollywoodouting he met with more critical acclaim as yet another murderer, Raskolnikov, in Sternberg’s version of Crime and Punishment (1935). Between 1937 and 1939 Lorre stepped into a more conventional role, playing the Japanese detective Mr. Moto in eight films for 20th Century-Fox. By the end of the decade, Lorre’s face and silken voice had become so recognizable that he was caricatured in Warner Bros. cartoons and on Spike Jones records. During the 1950s, health problems forced Lorre to take fewer roles, although he did expand his repertoire with a musical, Silk Stockings (1957) and several comedies. His comedic talent was displayed in a 1960s series of comedy/horror films for American-International Pictures. His precise timing and droll delivery in The Raven (1963) suggested thatHollywoodnever fully explored Lorre’s range as an actor.Vincent Price said of him, “His voice. . . face . . . the way he moved . . . laughed. He was the most identifiable actor I have ever known.”Trivia:\n\nBrecht wrote a Broadway musical for him and invited him to play Hamlet with his Berliner Ensemble.\n\nHe was the first director in post-WWIIGermanyto make a film critical of the Nazis.\n\nHe talked Humphrey Bogart into marrying Lauren Bacall!\n\nWas the very first James Bond villain; he played Le Chiffre in a 1954 version of Casino Royale on TV.\n\nDuring the anti-Communist witch hunts of the late 1940s, Federal agents came to his house to question him about whether or not he knew any suspicious persons.

To this day he is the one magicians aspire to. He was honored as first to fly a plane inAustraliaand also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his film career.Harry was the third of five children. When he was about four years old, his father, Rabbi Dr. Mayer Samuel Weiss, who was a religious scholar and teacher, moved the family to Appleton, Wisconsinwhere he became the first rabbi of a new congregation. He told everyone for his entire life that he was born in Appleton, so they would accept him as an American. In later years, in a magazine interview, Houdini said about Appleton, “the greatest escape I ever made was when I left Appleton, Wisconsin.” He was always concerned about physical fitness and staying in shape. He won awards in trackand swimming and later used these talents as an escape artist.When I was 15, I read an autobiography by the French Magician named Jean Robert-Houdin. This changed my life forever. I wanted to be just like Robert-Houdin, so I added the letter “I” which means “like” to his name, and I became Houdini. He career was storied to the say the least. In 1926, he lay underwater over 90 minutes in a sealed casketto beat the world record. Later that year, on October 22, 1926, while in his dressing room at the Princess Theater inMontreal with several students fromMcGillUniversity, he was asked if he could actually withstand a punch to the stomach thrown by any man. This is something he would routinely do, but before he could prepare himself by tightening his stomach muscles, J. Gordon Whitehead hit him three times. He didn’t know it at the time, but his appendix had burst. He did several shows at the Garrick after that, but soon became ill. Nine days later in room 401 ofDetroit’s oldGraceHospital, he died from peritonitis, which is inflammation of the appendix.

Erwin Knopfler, an architect, was a Hungarian Jew who had fled from the Nazis in 1939, and settled inGlasgow. A daughter, Ruth had been born in 1947. Later, in 1952, Mrs. Knopfler gave birth to a second son, David. When Mark was seven or eight, the Knopflers moved fromGlasgowtoNewcastle.Dire Straits was formed inLondonby Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar) and his brother David (guitar), with John Illsley (bass), and Pick Withers (drums). In the late 70s, the band emerged with a refreshing rock sound mixed with blues, jazz and even country. The band’s sound was strengthened by the meshing of players and Knopfler’s lyrics. Mark Knopfler is and always has been the face and force of Dire Straits. Their first demo gets airtime thanks to a chance friendship with London Radio DJ Charlie Gillent. Dire Straits (named after their financial condition) then is born. A record company deal and the first album, the self-titled Dire Straits, follow the next year. Thus began the meteoric rise of the one of the finest British band of all time.The first single of their album Brothers In Arms, “Money For Nothing,” went to Number 1 on pop and rock charts. Follow-up hits included the Top 10 “Walk Of Life” and “So Far Away.” The band used the popularity of the “new” CD format to give listeners longer versions of their songs. Tracks such as “Your Latest Trick” and “Brothers In Arms” became even more of a treat to listeners with the longer format. The LP sold over 9 million copies in the U.S. and many more millions around the world. The LP went #1 in Canada, Brazil, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, France, German, Greece, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Israel. 1986 Grammy Awards: Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (“Money For Nothing”) and Best Country Instrumental Performance (“Cosmic Square Dance” awared to Mark Knopfler and Chet Atkins).Trivia:\n\nPrior to forming the band, Knopfler worked as a rock critic and taught English.\n\n“Money For Nothing” with Sting as guest vocalist, is Dire Straits’ first American Number 1 single.\n\nKnopfler scored the film Wag The Dog.\n\n– See discography and more on neck-and-neck.com\n\n– Read more on The Sultans of Rock or\n\n– the official Mark-Knopfler.com or\n\n– Rock on the Net\n\nLehár, Franz (b. 4/30/1870 Komárom (now called Komarno in Slovakia after annexation at Trianon) – d. 10/24/1948, Bad Ischl, Austria)\n\nForemost composer of 20th century operettas.Best known as a composer of operettas, he studied with his father, a military bandmaster, and at the age of 15, from 1882 to 1888 he was a pupil at the Prague Conservatory, studying violin and music theory. On the advice of Dvorak, he concentrated on composition.After graduation, he played violin in the opera orchestra at Elberfeld. Later, he joined his father’s band, the Fiftieth Infantry, inVienna, as assistant bandmaster. InVienna, he also free-lanced as a conductor, and in the Spring of 1902, became conductor at the Theater an der Wien inVienna. His opera Wiener Frauen was produced there in November, 1902. From that time, he lived inVienna, and devoted his time to composition.“The man in the street may love The Merry Widow,” observed Ernest Newman, “but the musician, in addition to loving it, admires and wonders at it, so fresh and varied is the melodic invention in it, so deft, for all their economy, the harmonization and the scoring.”Franz Lehar wrote nearly forty operettas. His greatest success was The Merry Widow, which was first produced at Theater an der Wien on December 30, 1905. which had more than five thousand performances. At one time, it ran simultaneously in five different languages in five different theaters, all inBuenos Aires. Other major successes include The Count of Luxemburg (1911) andLand ofSmiles (1923), Gypsy Love, Eva and other sonatas, symphonic poems, marches, and dances. In February 1935 Lehár decided to found his own publishing house in order to have the greatest possible control over the performance and availability of his works. He incorporated Glocken Verlag Vienna on 15 February 1935. He reacquired most of his oeuvre from other publishers to whom he had previously sold various rights and devoted much time to the publication of definitive editions.
