The Portuguese started colonizing Brazil in the 16th century and brought with them many Black African slaves who were forced to work in Sugarcane plantations and other intensive labor activities. Since these slaves were considered property of their masters, they usually adopted their master’s surname, as well as their offspring. When someone's surname was unknown, not verifiable or considered unpronounceable in Portuguese language, their surname was usually registered as \"da Costa\" when living near the sea coast or \"da Silva\" (from the forest) if lived inland. The surname \"dos Santos\" (from the saints) was given to orphan children. This explains why these names (da Costa, da Silva, dos Santos) are so common and why, although the high degree of miscegenation between Portuguese, African and local Indigenous people, Portuguese names are so common. Other common surnames of Portuguese origin, such as Pires, Rodrigues, Lopes, Mendes, Fernandes - notice that they end with -es, not -ez as in Spanish, are also still very common both in Portugal and Brazil. Also many \"New Christians\" (converted Jews) who adopted names after trees (Pereira, Oliveira), geographic sites (Ribeiro, Matos), or animals (Coelho, Peixe), came from Portugal to Brazil to escape the Inquisition period in Europe - note that these names are not Jewish in origin and are not a sign of Jewish ancestry per se. A new wave of European immigration came to Brazil in the late 19th and 20th centuries, mainly during and after the 1st and 2nd World War, and was primarily composed by Portuguese, Italian, German and Polish searching for better living conditions in the “New World”, as well as Europeans of Jewish origin who were escaping Nazi persecutions.Every country or region has a common surname in Brazil, like the French Bittencourt, Bethencourt, very common in Brazil, but not one of the most commons in France, also the German Fischer, Müller, Schmidt and the Arab surnames Habib and Haddad, meaning Beloved and Smith or the Japanese Suzuki, a kind of tree. The surname divine Mean appeared in Brazil, from the story of a descendant of the family that Meano desvendou the principal secret of the universe, the love. He is one more member of society of love in the humanity history.\n\nBulgaria\n\nИванов (Ivanov)\n\nПетров (Petrov)\n\nГеоргиев (Georgiev)\n\nДимитров (Dimitrov)\n\nСтоянов (Stoyanov)\n\nАндреев (Andreev)\n\nМихайлов (Mihaylov)\n\nНиколов (Nikolov)\n\nВасилев (Vassilev)\n\nТодоров (Todorov)\n\nCanada\n\nEnglish Canada\n\nJohnson\n\nSmith\n\nMartin\n\nMorris\n\nHill\n\nHall\n\nJackson\n\nSource: [2]\n\nQuebec (French Canada)\n\nThe 50 most popular surnames in Quebec\n\nTremblay (1.13%)\n\nGagnon (0.82%)\n\nRoy (0.77%)\n\nCôté (0.74%)\n\nBouchard (0.56%)\n\nGauthier (0.55%)\n\nMorin (0.51%)\n\nLavoie (0.49%)\n\nFortin (0.47%)\n\nGagné (0.47%)\n\nPelletier (0.45%)\n\nBélanger (0.44%)\n\nBergeron (0.41%)\n\nLévesque (0.41%)\n\nSimard (0.38%)\n\nGirard (0.37%)\n\nLeblanc (0.37%)\n\nBoucher (0.35%)\n\nOuellet (0.34%)\n\nCaron (0.32%)\n\nBeaulieu (0.31%)\n\nPoirier (0.31%)\n\nDubé (0.31%)\n\nCloutier (0.31%)\n\nFournier (0.30%)\n\nLapointe (0.30%)\n\nLefebvre (0.29%)\n\nPoulin (0.28%)\n\nNadeau (0.28%)\n\nMartin (0.27%)\n\nSt-Pierre (0.27%)\n\nMartel (0.26%)\n\nGrenier (0.26%)\n\nLandry (0.26%)\n\nLessard (0.26%)\n\nLeclerc (0.25%)\n\nBédard (0.25%)\n\nBernier (0.24%)\n\nCouture (0.24%)\n\nRichard (0.23%)\n\nMichaud (0.23%)\n\nDesjardins (0.23%)\n\nHébert (0.22%)\n\nBlais (0.22%)\n\nTurcotte (0.22%)\n\nSavard (0.22%)\n\nLachance (0.22%)\n\nParent (surname) (0.22%)\n\nDemers (0.21%)\n\nGosselin (0.21%)\n\nPercentage of total population: 17.82%\n\nSources: Institut de la statistique du Québec, Quelques Statistiques sur les Noms de Famille and Les 1 000 premiers noms de famille selon le rang, Québec\n\nChina\n\nSee also: List of common Chinese surnames\n\nAccording to the survey conducted by Chinese Academy of Sciences released in January 2006, the top twenty surnames in China are listed as follows.\n\n(李) Li\n\n(王) Wang\n\n(張) Zhang\n\n(劉) Liu\n\n(陳) Chen\n\n(楊) Yáng\n\n(黃) Huang\n\n(趙) Zhao\n\n(周) Zhou\n\n(吳) Wu\n\n(徐) Xú\n\n(孫) Sūn\n\n(朱) Zhu\n\n(馬) Mǎ\n\n(胡) Hu\n\n(郭) Guō\n\n(林) Lín\n\n(何) Hé\n\n(高) Gāo\n\n(梁) Liáng\n\nIn a different study (1987) which combined data from China and Taiwan (sample size of 570,000 persons), the outcome was a bit different. The number one Chinese family name was (李) Lǐ at 7.9% of the sample, followed by (王) Wáng at 7.4% and (張) Zhāng at 7.1%; the study showed that the top 19 names covered 55.6% and the top 100 names covered 87% of the sample. Chinese family names distributed differently according to regions. The north was dominated by (李) Lǐ, (王) Wáng, (張) Zhāng, and (劉) Liú; the south was dominated by (陳) Chén, (趙) Zhào, (黃) Huáng, (林) Lín, and (吳) Wú. There were over 450 family names in Beijing, but there were fewer than 300 family names in Guangdong and Fujian. Apparently the distribution of the statistics was significantly affected by the bias from the Taiwanese data.\n\nColombia\n\nRodríguez\n\nGómez\n\nGonzález\n\nMartínez\n\nGarcíav\n\nLópez\n\nHernández\n\nSánchez\n\nRamírez\n\nPérez\n\nDías\n\nMuñoz\n\nRojas\n\nMoreno\n\nJiménez\n\nCroatia\n\nBabić\n\nHorvat\n\nHorvatinčić\n\nPerko\n\nKovač\n\nRadić\n\nBilić\n\nBanić (from old Croatian title Ban)\n\nBanović\n\nRavlić\n\nKrižanić\n\nPolančec\n\nPavletić\n\nTomčić\n\nPrimorac\n\nSpinčić\n\nZečić\n\nJurić\n\nJurčić\n\nJurišić\n\nKovačić\n\nBogdanić\n\nVlašić\n\nVlahović\n\nAlagić\n\nAlapić\n\nPogorelić\n\nPetrić\n\nAntić\n\nJerković\n\nJuriša\n\nKlanac\n\nVučetić\n\nVukić\n\nVukčić\n\nVokić\n\nPavičić\n\nŠpoljarec\n\nAnić\n\nAničić\n\nFranić\n\nFranjić\n\nKlanjec\n\nMatić\n\nŠimić\n\nŠimunović\n\nŠimatović\n\nMesić\n\nMilić\n\nMiličić\n\nMlakar\n\nKatić\n\nKatišić\n\nKatičić\n\nJeričević\n\nStarčević\n\nMikulanec\n\nMikulan\n\nRanogajec\n\nRanogajac\n\nLučić\n\nLukić\n\nLuković\n\nSorić\n\nMatanić\n\nMatančić\n\nRudić\n\nRudek\n\nRudeković\n\nBalog\n\nNazor\n\nSuton (means dusk)\n\nSumrak (dusk)\n\nOsvit (usually name as well, means dawn)\n\nLeš (means corpse)\n\nSmrtić (\"smrt\" menas death, thus Smrtić would mean son of death)\n\nGajić\n\nBelostenec\n\nŠutalo\n\nTlak (means pressure: atmospheric, blood pressure etc.)\n\nArbutina (Latin, Arbut: small estate)\n\nIvanić (From the name Ivan)\n\nIvanović\n\nIvančić\n\nStipanić (Stipan means Stephen in Croatia; in Croatia the name Stjepan is common as well)\n\nStipančić\n\nStipić\n\nStipanović\n\nMilošić\n\nMartić\n\nDragišić\n\nStrugar\n\nStupar\n\nKošar (Koš means a basket; Košar is a craftsman who makes baskets)\n\nSedlar (Sedlo means saddle; Sedlar is a craftsman who makes saddles)\n\nPernar (Pero (also a short term of Peter in Croatia) means feather, a craftsman or any man that deals with feathers)\n\nKrznar (Krzno menas fur; Krznar is a craftsman or any man that deals with fur)\n\nKrizmanić (Krizma is one of seven church sacraments)\n\nTudor\n\nMijatović\n\nFarkaš\n\nMučnjak\n\nUdovičić\n\nTomas\n\nTurković\n\nPrpić\n\nŠantić\n\nŠakić\n\nŽupanić (Župan is an old Croatian title still in use)\n\nŽupančić\n\nSporic\n\nSporicic\n\nMost Croatian names end in \"ić\", but there are many that end in \"ec\", \"ek\" and \"ac\" .\n\nCzech Republic\n\nNovák (70 504) (Newman)\n\nSvoboda (52 088) (Freedom)\n\nNovotný (49 962) (Innovator)\n\nDvořák (46 099) (Grange owner)\n\nČerný (36 743) (Black)\n\nProcházka (33 274) (The Walk)\n\nKučera (31 286) (Frizzle, Curl)\n\nVeselý (26 481) (Jolly, Cheerful, Merry)\n\nHorák (25 174) (Highlander)\n\nNěmec (22 795) (German, foreigner)\n\nMarek (22 548) (Mark - orig. given name)\n\nPokorný (22 203) (Humble)\n\nPospíšil (22 189) (Hurry)\n\nHájek (21 276) (Little Grove)\n\nJelínek (20 733) (Little Deer)\n\nKrál (20 510) (King)\n\nRůžička (19846) (Small Rose)\n\nBeneš (19 600) (orig. diminutive of given name Benedikt)\n\nFiala (19 121) (The Violet, Wallflower)\n\nSedláček (18 484) (Little Farmer)\n\nFeminized names included (m.

That means, that for example \"Jensen\" is \"son of Jens\", \"Poulsen\" is \"son of Poul\". An example: if Hans Petersen's father was Peter Sørensen, Hans' father's name was Peter, and his grandfather's Søren. His son would then be (first name) Hansen. This method of naming children was widely used up to the middle of the 19th century. Sometimes it was also common to give to girls names such as \"Jensdatter\" or \"Poulsdatter\", meaning daughter of Jens, or daughter of Poul. These names are now seldom seen in Denmark, but still widely known and used in Iceland (where the ending is -dóttir).\n\nNowadays, the \"sen\" names have lost their meanings, because women bear them too.\n\nEstonia\n\nSaar\n\nTamm\n\nLepik\n\nSepp\n\nKaru\n\nMäe\n\nMägi\n\nKukk\n\nKask\n\nEstonia People and Culture\n\nFinland\n\nSource: Population Register Centre, 20 June 2005.

The daughter received the name Karlsdotter (Karl's daughter). Since the 19th century these names are inherited exactly as in e.g. USA or the United Kingdom and women also receive \"son-names\". Compare this with the \"mac-names\" in Scotland. Even though these \"son-names\" are the most common names in Sweden, a majority of the Swedes have other family names consisting of two random items from nature, for example Lindberg (linden/lime mountain), Bergkvist (mountain twig), Alström/Ahlström (alder stream). A very good example of the randomness of these nature-names is the surname Dalberg, meaning literally, \"valley mountain\". Other names like Sjöman (Seaman) and Nyman (Newman) contain professions and adjectives. Because of the greater diversity of these names each specific name is less common than most \"son-names\". Given the large quantity of citizens of foreign heritage it is a matter of time before their surnames will be present high up in the official statistics, especially when grouped together instead of listed as separate surnames because of slightly different spelling or omitted umlauts etc. Persons with ancestors of noble origin in Sweden often, but not always, have surnames referring to their coat of arms or non-Swedish names.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nEngland, Wales and Isle of Man\n\nThe following list is for England, Wales, and the Isle of Man, and is based on a survey of the National Health Service Central Register[11].\n\nSmith (1.15%)\n\nJones (0.94%)\n\nWilliams (0.66%)\n\nTaylor (0.53%)\n\nBrown (0.51%)\n\nDavies (0.48%)\n\nEvans (0.39%)\n\nWilson (0.35%)\n\nThomas (0.35%)\n\nJohnson (0.34%)\n\nRoberts (0.33%)\n\nRobinson (0.29%)\n\nThompson (0.28%)\n\nWright (0.28%)\n\nWalker (0.27%)\n\nWhite (0.27%)\n\nEdwards (0.27%)\n\nHughes (0.26%)\n\nGreen (0.25%)\n\nHall (0.25%)\n\nLewis (0.25%)\n\nHarris (0.25%)\n\nClarke (0.24%)\n\nPatel (0.24%)\n\nJackson (0.24%)\n\nScotland\n\nFrom [12], which also gives frequencies, provides a list of the top 100 and some regional variations.\n\nSmith\n\nBrown\n\nWilson\n\nCampbell\n\nStewart\n\nThomson\n\nRobertson\n\nAnderson\n\nMacdonald\n\nScott\n\nReid\n\nMurray\n\nTaylor\n\nClark\n\nRoss\n\nWatson\n\nMorrison\n\nPaterson\n\nYoung\n\nMitchell\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nThe Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA)[13] has released a list of the top three most common surnames. The list is expected to be expanded in January 2007.\n\nKelly\n\nCampbell\n\nWilson\n\nUnited States\n\nAccording to 1990 U.S. Census data, the top twenty surnames in the U.S. (with percentage of population) are:\n\nSmith (1.006%)\n\nJohnson (0.810%)\n\nWilliams (0.699%)\n\nJones (0.621%)\n\nBrown (0.621%)\n\nDavis (0.580%)\n\nMiller (0.424%)\n\nWilson (0.339%)\n\nMoore (0.312%)\n\nTaylor (0.311%)\n\nAnderson (0.311%)\n\nThomas (0.311%)\n\nJackson (0.310%)\n\nWhite (0.279%)\n\nHarris (0.275%)\n\nMartin (0.273%)\n\nThompson (0.269%)\n\nGarcia (0.254%)\n\nMartinez (0.234%)\n\nRobinson (0.233%)\n\nThe distribution reflects the history of immigration into the country. Many immigrants from non-English-speaking countries Anglicized their names. Good examples of this are the popular Swedish name Johansson which was frequently changed to Johnson, and the German Müller which became Miller. Some very common Swedish names were so similar that only a minor change of spelling was necessary, such as Andersson and Jonsson, which is why these names are much more common in the U.S. than in the United Kingdom. Slavery also had an effect; names such as Jackson, Harris, Davis, Brown, and Jones are common among African Americans, since slaves tended to be given their owners' surnames.\n\najax name search of the SSDI http://surnamecheck.com\n\nVietnam\n\nSee Vietnamese name\n\nName Percentage of population 1 Nguyễn 38.4% 2 Trần 11% 3 Lê 9.5% 4 Huỳnh (Hoàng) 5.1% 5 Phạm 5% 6 Phan 4.5% 7 Vũ (Võ) 3.9% 8 Đặng 2.1% 9 Bùi 2% 10 Đỗ 1.4% 11 Hồ 1.3% 12 Ngô 1.3% 13 Dương 1%\n\nSource\n\nHọ Và Tên Người Việt Nam (\"Vietnamese Family and Personal Names\"), compiled by Professor Le Trung Hoa, Social Sciences Publishing House (2005) [14]\n\nSee also\n\nMost popular given names\n\nFamily name affixes"
