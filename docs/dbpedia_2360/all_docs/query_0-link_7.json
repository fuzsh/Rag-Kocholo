His estimated year of birth was 1737. Paul arrived in Sankt Andreas in or around 1789 with his wife, Eva/Anna Eva Scheer/Scherer who was born in 1755 in Apatin, Batschka, Bacs Bodrog County, Vojvodina, Hungary (was also Yugoslavia and now Serbia). Due to the age difference, there is a possibility that Eva was not his first wife. Paul's name appears in the Apatin records with his wife, but he and Eva were not married there. I have yet to discover where they were married. They eventually moved to Sankt Andreas in the Banat area of the Holy Roman Empire with at least 4 children whose birth places are unknown to me. Paul was the notary for the village of Sankt Andreas. This was a position of some esteem. I am looking to discover more about Paul and the places he lived before he arrived in the Banat. He and Eva are my 4th Great Grandparents. I have taken a DNA test and have my results on Family Tree, Gedmatch, MyHeritage and Ancestry. Any help would be much appreciated.

Titz Frank J Zwetolitz Strem (StrÃ©m) Settled in Bronx, NY then Nazareth, PA. Titz Donna Marie Seyfried Urbersdorf (OrbÃ¡nfalu) My mother Marie Seyfried nee Bock was a the daughter of Mary/Marie Stranzl (b US but raised in Glasing) and Michel S Bock (Hoell). My maternal great grandfather Josef Louis Stranzl (1885-1967) in Ehrensdorf, son of Louis Alois? Stranzl and Josephine Monshein. He emigrated at age 17 in 1903 to Northampton PA. He had a brother Alois Stranzl who may or may not have emigrated to the US, and a sister Rosina Titz (Tietz) nee Stranzl who emigrated to the US in 1923. Later Josef Stranzl married Rosina Schmidt and they lived in Coplay PA. They returned to Ehrensdorf in 1910 to leave their 2 yr old first born/daughter Marie (Mary) Stranzl ( 1908- 1971)to be raised by her grandparents Alois Stranzl (b abt 1860?)until she was 14, and was called to return to the US to work (1922). My paternal grandfather Michael S Bock (1903-1987), son of Michel Bock (born 1875?) and Julianna Gillinger (born abbt 1880), and he had 2 sisters and a brother. Michael emigrated to Coplay in 1923, the only one of his family to do so. He married Marie Stranzl (Mary Bock) and remained in the Coplay/Hokendauqua PA area. His siblings who remained in Austria/Hungary were Angeloi ( who I believe with her family was left behind the Iron Curtain post WWII), George (remained in Hoell) and Maria Pouil or Paul nee Bock(2011) of near Mischendorf. Maria (b 1916?)was the youngest and had one daughter Margarethe Kreitner nee Paul,(1938-2018). I am searching for earlier records of births, deaths, marraiges, or other to locate the ancestors of Michael Bock still remaining in the Burgenland or nearby regions. My grandfather returned only once in 1972 and was able to visit his brother and sisters, even Angeloi with permission to enter the Iron Curtain, although I recall him saying she no longer spoke German. I have photos from his trip. I took my family in June 2018 to visit the Burgenland and meet my only know relative, Margarethe Kreitner in Mischendorf- she was 82 years old. Her husband and only son Dietmar Kreitner had died in Dec. 2016 and 2017 respectively and she had only her husband's sister Edeltraut as a living relative. With an interpreter we were able to have a lovely afternoon. Sadly her father xxx Paul had died age 29 in Russia during WWII leaving her mother a young widow, unprotected during the Russian occupation post the war. These memories were too difficult for her, so we did not talk more. She did take us to her cemetery close by where her parents (Mary and xxx Paul), her husband and son were buried but I do not recall the name. I am hoping that you may be able to guide me in my genealogy search for records on both th Stranz and Bock families who remained in the Burgenland.
