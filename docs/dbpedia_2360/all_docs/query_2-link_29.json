An American citizen whose knowledge of the war was derived exclusively from the movies would be unsympathetic if not hostile to Poland and understanding if not supportive of Soviet policies directed against Poland’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The number of Americans who fell into this category is impossible to determine, but it was doubtless large. Moreover, even for those for whom the movies were but one source of information, films had at least some effect, and for the Poles that effect was negative. This conclusion is based on a careful consideration of scores of films and on the reconstruction of the evolution of stories from literary property through various “treatments” into ever changing scripts. This reconstruction has been supplemented by evaluations of the films and their political content provided by governmental agencies. In addition to studying the films closely, I have consulted many memoirs, letters, diaries, and memoranda by screenwriters, directors, studio heads, actors, and other film employees. Discussions of Slavs in American cinema are few, and of the Poles, very few. All of them are characterized by sweeping allegations based on a small sample of films. For the average American, “going to the movies” usually meant watching cheap and artless efforts, not just attending a few major productions. It is thus only by considering a great many films, not just a handful of lasting impression, that we can sense the cumulative effects of the films on the public. Hence my examples are many and far ranging. That Poland was treated very negatively is beyond question. Why ix\n\n˘â•… Preface this was so is more difficult to determine. The principal factor was the desire by the political Left, especially the Communist Party, to gain sympathy for, and promote the foreign policy interests of, the Soviet Union. Undermining Poland’s claim on the support of the American public was a direct contribution to promoting Soviet political and territorial ambitions. That Poland had long been regarded by the political Left as an inveterate enemy of the Soviets made this effort more passionate. In Hollywood, the Left, therefore, was ideologically antiPolish. This disposition complemented the foreign policy of the Roosevelt administration, which regarded close wartime cooperation with Moscow as fundamental. Poland had very considerable grievances against the Soviets, and any consideration of them complicated relations with Moscow. Simply put, the American government could be either proRussian or pro-Polish; there was no compromise position. For reasons of realpolitik, it chose the former. This made it a functional ally of the Hollywood Left. Much has been written about the relations between New Deal liberalism and the radical Left. In Hollywood, at least over Poland, they worked in tandem.1 These are the main factors that explain Hollywood’s treatment of Poland and the Poles during World War II. But they are merely the central features of a complex landscape. Poland was presented the way it was as a result of the interaction of many factors imbedded in the ethnic mosaic of the United States, including the Poles’ relationship with other minority groups, especially the Jewish community. Polish-Jewish relations haunt the story even though they were rarely specifically addressed. That World War II brought both the Holocaust of the Jews and the ruination of Poland, themes Hollywood avoided, makes this discussion especially sensitive and significant. Finally, the American conception of World War II as “the good war,” in which villains and heroes were clearly distinguished and moral ambiguity was banished, required avoiding radical doubts about the worthiness of the Soviet Union as an ally of the United States. Norway and France, Czechoslovakia and England were all victims of Nazi rapacity. Discussing any of them merely underscored the moral clarity of the war. Poland, however, was different. It was invaded, occupied, and abused by both Germany and Russia. Poland raised the radical question about the Soviet Union’s place in the coalition of the righteous.\n\nPrefaceâ•… xi But since the Soviets were obviously paying the largest price in the struggle to defeat Nazism, entertaining doubts about their fitness raised awkward questions about the cynicism and ruthlessness of American foreign policy. Such questions could not coexist with the self-confident rectitude of a country off to war singing “Onward Christian Soldiers.” Poland had to be ignored to salve the American conscience. At base, Poland’s fate in Hollywood reflected the Americans’ need to feel good about themselves.2 In 1989 I was invited to comment after a public screening of Frank Capra’s wartime propaganda film The Nazis Strike. When I noted that the depiction of the war grossly misrepresented both Poland and Soviet Russia, a member of the audience rose in passionate protest. It was simply too painful for this veteran of American service to hear criticism of a film that he remembered as symbolizing national unity and purpose. He was virtually in tears at what he regarded as a blaspheming of his memories. Ironically, he was an American Pole known for his patriotic attachment to his ancestral homeland. The possibility that the United States had done a disservice to the Polish cause was more than he could bear; it thus could not be true. However, it was true. This is not a book about Poland but about how America viewed and represented Poland as a result of the interplay among ideology, nationality, and politics. By focusing on the Polish issue, this book throws considerable light on the question of what the Left was about in wartime Hollywood and whether it had any effect on films—a passionate topic long debated. The “red menace” may well have been more effective than many believe if we focus on its geopolitical propagandizing and not its social message. We also are able to consider from a new perspective the question of whether Hollywood really was the source of pro-Russian propaganda during the war. Everything that hurt Poland helped Russia. Omitting, or providing an inaccurate portrayal of, Poland damaged its ability to gain the sympathy and attention of the American public. I should like to thank the friends and colleagues who have offered helpful suggestions: Piotr S. Wandycz and Jadwiga M. Biskupska of Yale University, Piotr Wróbel of the University of Toronto, and Anna Cienciala of the University of Kansas, all of whom provided important advice; Robert Szymczak of Pennsylvania State University for his help regarding population figures; Irene Tomaszewski of the Canadian\n\nxiiâ•… Preface Foundation for Polish Studies for early encouragement; Jay Bergman for his good judgment and many kindnesses, and Ewa Wołyńska and Renata Vickrey for their research skills, all three at Central Connecticut State University; James S.

Biskupski, for his extraordinary assistance in unearthing sources. My greatest debt is to Anna Laura Bennett for her superb editing. The University Press of Kentucky has been a pleasure to work with, and I owe Anne Dean Watkins my sincere gratitude for her patience and consideration. My wife, Virginia R. Mitchell, was, as always, a source of wise counsel, which I usually ignored, a decision I always later regretted. My two youngest children, Misia and Staś, helped Daddy more than they know. In addition, Kate Farley, Paul Hermann, Anne Marie Incorvaia, and Melissa Macko, my former students at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, New York, brought many matters to my attention regarding American films of this era while participating in the class Hitler and Hollywood during the autumn 2001 semester. They have my thanks for their help and their support. The book is dedicated to my mother, whom I love more with the years.\n\nIntroduction Films in the era before television were a significant source of information as well as entertainment, and their influence on popular attitudes, though impossible to quantify, was considerable.1 Let us remember that in the 1939–1945 era Hollywood released five hundred films yearly and that the decade beginning in 1935 saw a phenomenal increase in American film attendance: 74 percent of the population of the country went to the movies at least once a week; many, especially in urban areas, went more often.2 Attendance at films surpassed 85 million a week, and the industry exceeded $1 billion in annual receipts.3 Films mattered; their “manipulative qualities” shaped taste and attitude. They made things important by their attention, and they rendered them marginal by their neglect.4 “An average feature film,” Melvin Small notes, “reached more people than any single book, newspaper, or magazine.”5 American films not only sought to portray the conflict but, as Arthur F. McClure notes, also “tried to define the objectives of the war.” In fine, they attempted to create policies, or at least mold popular support for them.6 For good or ill, Hollywood was, in Carl Sandburg’s words, “the foremost educational institute on earth.”7 American public opinion demonstrated a marked shift during the war in its perceptions of Poland. Whereas Poland was always a marginal concern for Americans, the general impression of the country in the immediate aftermath of the September invasions was sympathetic, though not supportive enough to disturb isolationist inclinations.8 However, after 1941 and the Soviet Union’s entry into the war against Germany, this situation changed. Support for Soviet Russia grew— including support for its political and territorial designs on Poland—and the popular image of Poland deteriorated. As Richard C. Lukas notes, ˘\n\nâ•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 “One of the most remarkable phenomena of World War II was the dramatic change in American attitudes towards the Soviets and the Poles. . . . [Whereas the Soviet Union] emerged by the end of the war as an admired and respected nation . . . Poland . . . came to be characterized as the enfant terrible of the Allies, threatening to wreck their wartime alliance.”9 This situation deteriorated still more in the spring of 1943 when the Germans discovered thousands of Polish corpses at Katyń on the eastern front. The Russians, who had perpetrated the crime, blamed the Germans. American public opinion largely shared the Russian view. The Poles, who knew the truth, were in a quandary. To many Americans, the Poles were damaging Allied unity by not accepting German guilt. When the Russians broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government soon after, the Poles were isolated. American public opinion almost certainly blamed the Poles for this state of affairs.10 Both Hollywood leftists and members of the Roosevelt administration frequently claimed that positive portrayals of Russia, however inaccurate, were justified because of the enormous prejudice the American public had felt toward Soviet Russia. Hence, though they were propaganda, pro-Russian efforts were in effect counterpropaganda to undue years of ignorance and prejudice. That this claim is without foundation was known at the time. A widely reported Gallup poll in July 1941 made it clear that the American public favored a Soviet victory over Nazi Germany by a gigantic disparity, 72 percent to 4 percent. Soviet war relief was popular in the United States; public declarations of support for the Russians from prominent figures were frequent.11 To be sure, isolationism was widespread until Pearl Harbor, but there was absolutely no need to “sell” the Russian war effort, which had overwhelming American support even before Washington and Moscow became formal allies. The extraordinary growth of popular Russophilia, including the proliferation of pro-Russian and pro-Soviet films, has been well studied.12 A 1943 public opinion survey noted that one of these films, Mission to Moscow, “raised pro-Soviet sentiment . . . among those who saw it.”13 Small concludes, “Public opinion polls tell us that Americans became increasingly friendly towards the Soviet Union during the period, and Hollywood undoubtedly had something to do with this shift in attitude.”14 However, less attention has been devoted to the concomi-\n\nIntroductionâ•…˘ tant deterioration of American support for Poland. There is a valuable study by David Januszewski of American press treatment of the Polish-Soviet imbroglio.15 But Hollywood’s portrayal of Poland has not heretofore received extended scholarly analysis. Given the significance of the movies for the formation of the modern American mind, this is a noteworthy lacuna. The American film industry produced a large number of films in the 1939–1945 era that were completely or substantially devoted to the war.16 However, virtually none of them concerned Poland. The reasons for this are difficult to understand. Kathryn Kane has suggested that, whereas the Pacific theater of the war began dramatically for the Americans with the Pearl Harbor attack, the origins and early stages of the European conflict were confusing and ambiguous. Moreover, whereas American troops were at once in action in the Pacific, involvement in the European theater was delayed until the fall of 1942, with the North African landings. Only in 1943, with the Italian campaign, did American troops fight on the continent.17 These facts would explain the initial paucity of films devoted to Europe in general, but they would have no bearing on which theaters of the European conflict were emphasized. This takes us to the first of several perplexing questions. Hollywood was at pains to serve the national interest by portraying the Germans as barbarians determined to conquer the world. Their uncivilized methods of war and unspeakable occupation policies made them an implacable enemy of all decent people. One would think, in light of this, that the best illustration of this dichotomy would be the Polish example: a military campaign distinguished by great sacrifice and gallantry; a huge, resourceful underground offering unyielding resistance; and, of course, an occupation regime of unparalleled savagery. Hollywood, however, devoted no cinematic attention to Poland whatsoever until 1942, when it released a single film set there, the controversial To Be or Not to Be. Two years passed before two additional films about Poland, In Our Time and the obscure, low-budget None Shall Escape, were released. These were Hollywood’s last “Polish” films of the war.18 By comparison, Norway, where armed resistance to the 1940 German attack had been brief and a collaborationist regime under Vidkun Quisling was installed, was a subject of endless attention by Hollywood. There were many films devoted to Norway, five appearing in a period of several months after late 1942, many featuring major stars\n\n˘â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 and representing considerable budgets.19 France was also the subject of lavish attention. As Bernard F. Dick notes, “Hollywood’s Francophilia during the war even surpassed its pre-war Anglophilia. France . . . became a symbol of freedom in chains.”20 Unlike Poland’s, France’s military defeat was far more rapid than was anticipated or justified by circumstance. Moreover, the Vichy regime under Marshal Pétain was collaborationist, and French troops even fired on Americans disembarking in North Africa in Operation Torch in November 1942.21 Finally, there were at least six cinematic depictions of Czechoslovakia during World War II, perhaps more. All are complimentary to the Czechs.22 This despite the fact that there was no military opposition to German occupation, and the relative docility of the population led Vojtech Mastny to refer to it as “the failure of national resistance.”23 Indeed, the most famous resistance fighter in the history of Hollywood’s reconstruction of the war is, mirabile dictu, a Czech, Casablanca’s Victor László. Thus the travail of continental Europe is presented to American audiences not through a depiction of Poland, which would prove a handy and, indeed, eloquent example, but through Czechoslovakia, Norway, and France, whose service in this role is awkward at best.24 Hence Hollywood chose to ignore Poland even when it was, seemingly, in its cinematic interest to do otherwise.25 Even the federal office assigned to monitor the film industry was perplexed by Hollywood’s ignoring of Poland during the war.26 As we shall see, the overall negative portrayal of Poland and the Poles by Hollywood was a combination of factors. These include, at base, the absence of a tradition of interest in Polish subjects in American culture as a whole and the insignificant presence of Poles in the United States and hence of Poland in the mental world of the American government and its people. These are large factors long in place. However, if we consider just the war years and the motives of the studios, we discern more specific factors. Chief among these is the powerful proSoviet disposition of many in Hollywood, especially the screenwriters, among whom membership in the Communist Party was quite common. Party members, by the estimate of Paul Buhle, who is certainly sympathetic to the political Left, were “creatively critical” for between one thousand and fifteen hundred films in the years before 1947.27 Films that portrayed Poles negatively, presented Soviet designs against Poland favorably, or omitted Poland from the story at critical moments were\n\nIntroductionâ•…˘ almost always the work of writers of the radical Left. This leftist campaign against Poland was not motivated by anti-Polish prejudice but by the need to protect Soviet interests, which required Poland to be either denigrated or removed from popular discourse. This project was easy to accomplish because it largely complemented the foreign and domestic policies of the Roosevelt administration, which saw in Poland a trifling ally whose contribution to the war was far less significant than its role in promoting frictions with Moscow. In simple terms, the Soviet Union pursued a policy inimical to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Poland. This was quite obvious by 1941, if not before. Although Washington bore the Poles no ill will, it did not regard the defense of Polish interests as important. Poland had not been significant in American policy before 1939 and was not a major force in the war. By contrast, close cooperation with Moscow was the basis of wartime strategy and fundamental to the creation of a postwar world. Hence, for the Roosevelt administration, Moscow would be accommodated as regarded Poland. Any public discussion of this fact would inconvenience Washington’s policy toward Moscow. American films were to present the war in a manner that facilitated the public’s acceptance of administration policies. Hence the governmental agency that monitored the film industry, the Bureau of Motion Pictures (BMP) of the Office of War Information (OWI), was very careful that Russia be presented positively and that issues that might cast the USSR in a negative light be eliminated. Because Russian actions regarding Poland were a catalog of outrages, the Polish issue was especially sensitive. Hence the Roosevelt administration and the Hollywood Left had identical goals as regarded Polish issues in American films. This returns us to the controversial question about Communist influence in Hollywood. The 1947 congressional investigations into alleged Communist infiltration of the motion picture industry produced publicity and melodrama but certainly did not prove the existence of serious and effective Communist subversion of Hollywood. The witnesses who tried to discern Communist influences in wartime films are often dismissed. “The proceedings,” as Victor S. Navasky wrote, “had comic overtones.”28 The very idea that Hollywood films could contain Communist propaganda was “laughable.”29 William Triplett concludes, “The Communist Party certainly had a Hollywood presence. Its effectiveness, however, within the film industry in the 1930s was almost nil,”\n\nâ•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 and subsequently, during the war years, “no pro-Communist passage . . . ever made it past the editing hatchet of the producer.”30 This is corroborated by the detailed accounting of screenwriter Albert Maltz, himself a party member, of the difficulty of inserting propaganda into films.31 Party chief William Z. Foster told a secret meeting in 1946, “We can’t expect to put any propaganda in the films.”32 Indeed, Triplett argues that Communists in Hollywood had their hands full just blunting the antiCommunist propaganda in films.33 The issue is closed. The Communist Party realized it was not possible to use films to advance the party program and hence did not do so.34 This argument, however, is seriously in need of reexamination. If we look for supposed “Communist subversion” in films by anticipating long passages from Karl Marx or calls for a workers’ rebellion in the United States or for the overthrow of capitalism, the argument is entirely valid. However, such insertions would have been easily cut, and they would have been bootless even if allowed. The United States was obviously not on the brink of social revolution. However, the main task of the party was to advance the foreign policy agenda of the Soviet Union, to rally support for it during the war with Germany and facilitate its geopolitical designs.35 In their important study on politics in the film community, Larry Ceplair and Steven Englund note, “Although Party rhetoric was replete with revolutionary phraseology, most adherents—including the vast majority of Hollywood screenwriters—did not perceive themselves as the vanguard of violent upheaval or, still less, of a dictatorship of the proletariat. . . . Party members uncritically supported the U.S.S.R. in the public and tended to confuse [in Paul Jarrico’s words] ‘the national interests of Russia with those of the United States’ . . . in private.”36 Here Poland plays a crucial role. The re-creation of an independent Poland, within its historical frontiers, under its legal government, would have been an insuperable obstacle to Soviet expansion in Europe. By contrast, the replacement of a sovereign Poland with a Soviet satellite would be the basis for a forward policy for the Soviets in Europe. It was Stalin himself who said in 1945 that “Poland has always been a corridor for attack on Russia. . . . It is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the Soviet State.”37 Hence undermining the Polish cause in the United States was an important goal for supporters of the Soviet Union, including, preeminently, members of the party, who\n\nIntroductionâ•… were bound to promote the vital interests of Soviet Russia. That this goal was easily within reach in the United States was because of a host of reasons explored in the present work. However, it is precisely here, in the party’s role in facilitating Soviet strategic aims by undermining the position of Poland, that we may look to discover the real focus of party efforts in Hollywood in the war era. And, unlike the 1947 investigations, this analysis discovers a considerable effort and considerable results. Evidence of the efforts by the party and its sympathizers to denigrate Poland and promote Soviet claims to Poland’s detriment must be sought in the material they produced by analyzing the scripts and the evolution of the films they worked on from initial studio interest to finished release. We shall not find party directives to say nasty things about Poles or memoranda from screenwriters explaining how they wished to portray Poland in an unsympathetic light. In large part this reflects a recent observation by Dan Georgakas that, for all of the memoir literature, much of it by repentant ex-Communists, we know virtually nothing of what went on at party meetings in Hollywood.38 Many note that these gatherings were frequent and interminable, but we have absolutely no inkling of whether they discussed how specific scripts would be handled and themes developed.39 In other words, we can discern only from the work of the party and their many ideological sympathizers what they wished to say about Poland and the Poles; they do not tell us directly. These political factors, particularly the congruence of the U.S. administration policy with the pro-Soviet agenda, explain much of Hollywood’s approach to Poland and the Poles in the war years. But there are additional elements. It was really quite easy to use the cinema to convey an unsympathetic image of Poland because a number of factors were already in place to facilitate that design. First, Hollywood was almost devoid of significant Polish voices, either émigré or American born. Whereas there had been a number of prominent Poles in the film industry earlier, by 1939 Poles were almost completely absent from Hollywood’s creative roles, studio executives, and featured players. What few Poles were in Hollywood were effectively invisible, using changed names, avoiding any contact with the Polish community, and not publicly associating themselves with Poland or Polish issues. There was, simply, no group available that would instinctively defend the Polish\n\nâ•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 cause. A powerful Irish lobby in the 1920s, exploiting its predominating position in the American Catholic Church, had been remarkably effective in forcing Hollywood to treat the Irish—and the church—with care by the 1930s. Unlike the Irish, the Poles were not a community capable of pressuring Hollywood. And the Polish government-in-exile (established after the occupation of Poland in 1939) was painfully aware of its diplomatic weakness. Forced into the role of supplicant for American favor, it could not supplement this effort. A second and paradoxical factor affecting the Polish issue in Hollywood was that Hollywood was heavily populated by Jews, most of Eastern European origin, for whom Poland was not a sympathetic topic. For them, Poland represented a past best forgotten. This is a sensitive and elusive matter usually “nervously avoided,” as Peter Novick argues— but it cannot be ignored.40 Unlike the Poles of America, who considered their ancestral homeland with affection and loyalty, Polish Jews associated the country with discrimination and barriers to personal and community advancement. That many Poles came to the United States intending eventually to return whereas most Jews planned to stay and build radically new lives is a significant differentiation. The war only magnified this disparity. In the years before the war, the Polish Republic was marred by considerable anti-Semitic prejudice, which became more marked and more pervasive in the 1930s. Whereas the extent and depth of such prejudice in prewar Poland remains controversial, there is no doubt that elements of Polish society harbored anti-Semitic views. American Jews were doubtlessly aware of these facts, which would understandably affect their attitudes toward Poland. Once the war began, American Poles wanted to see Poland’s efforts praised and its trials presented with sympathy. But for the Jews, the Second World War was inextricably intertwined with the Holocaust. For Hollywood’s Jews, discussing anti-Semitism in Europe had traditionally been a dangerous and painful topic. The war exacerbated this. Poland was the main site of the Holocaust, and hence after 1939, Jewish moguls of Hollywood were even more reluctant to discuss Polish themes. This inclination was reinforced by the Roosevelt administration, which did not want specifically Jewish issues raised in presenting the war.41 Finally, the discussion of Hollywood’s treatment of Poland is part of a larger theme concerning the Polish presence in America. In recent\n\nIntroductionâ•…˘ decades a number of scholars have noted that in many ways American culture has been uncongenial to the Poles. American literature has largely dismissed the Poles from its explorations, and when they do appear, they are usually marginal or unsympathetic. Polish writers in America are few and unheralded. They have done little to add their community’s story to the national epic, and the absence has not been regretted. The Polish community in America enjoys scant prestige, and Polonia has often felt disdained by its fellow citizens. Poland, so dear to the hearts of the Poles in America, has never been significant to Washington, which has traditionally relegated Poland to a matter of minor concern, worthy only of symbolic and often insincere gestures. If the Poles of America have long suspected that America does not regard them highly, a consideration of the American cinema is a most appropriate place to test that assumption. Siegfried Kracauer observed a generation ago a “permanent interaction between mass dispositions and film content.” Hence, though “American audiences receive what Hollywood wants them to want . . . in the long run audience desires, acute or dormant, determine the character of Hollywood films.”42 Hollywood had a great many reasons for presenting Polish themes in the manner it did during World War II. If these dispositions have retained their resonance in American culture, however, it is because the images are what the public finds pleasing or at least verisimilar. This is the largest and the most depressing theme suggested by this study, but I shall leave it unexamined. We have enough to do.\n\n1\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939 Poland, returned to the map at the end of the First World War, mattered little to the United States after 1918. This was true in both political and cultural matters. American films reflected this lack of interest. Indeed, the Polish population in the United States was also largely an unknown community to the American public, who regarded this newly created minority group with a mixture of disdain and indifference. It is not surprising that few films produced in the silent era or later in the 1930s featured Polish themes or explored the lives of Polish immigrants to America. The relative insignificance of the Polish presence was in contrast to the considerable attention devoted to other large ethnic groups. A few Poles enjoyed brief careers in Hollywood. None—with one exception—were identifiable as Poles.1 Marianna Michalska and Apolonia Chałupiec, both born in Poland, were stars of the silent screen under the pseudonyms Gilda Gray and Pola Negri, but neither enjoyed a long career.2 This was particularly unfortunate for the Poles as regarded Negri, who, for all her notorious personal behavior, was outspokenly patriotic and cultivated the Polish community in America. In 1923, for example, five years after Poland was restored to independence, she placed a wreath at the monument to Polish national hero Tadeusz Kościuszko in Chicago, to the delight of the local Poles. She announced, “I have come here not seeking personal acclaim or fortune, but to bring glory to our people. I wish to contribute however insignificantly to the 11\n\n12â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 renown of our reborn beloved Fatherland.” Later she was the benefactor of a Polish Roman Catholic parish in Texas. In the 1930s she refused to perform in a German film because she regarded it as insulting to Poland. Briefly she was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood; in a few years in the mid-1920s, she earned a reported $6 million.3 Never before or since did a Pole combine such popularity and power in Hollywood with such open devotion to her country.4 However, her career in Hollywood was over by the 1930s. Gilda Gray’s Hollywood years were also very short; she had a few major roles in the 1920s that were huge box office successes. However, she suffered a heart attack and went bankrupt in the next few years, effectively ending her career, which included only one additional film in 1936. During World War II, she dedicated herself to the Polish cause and was decorated for her efforts to raise money. As a Hollywood figure, however, she had already disappeared.5 Even briefer was the career of Warsaw-born Estelle Clarke (Stanisława Zwoliński). Though she made ten films, with increasingly large roles, between 1924 and 1928, her career ended that year, when she was twenty-nine. The life of Lyda Roberti (daughter of a Polish mother and a German father, both circus performers) was tragic. Born in Warsaw but raised in Shanghai and other exotic locales, she had a precocious career culminating as a talented and popular comedy actress in Hollywood. In at least two of her roles, she apparently played Polish characters: Dancers in the Dark (Paramount, 1932) and George White’s 1935 Scandals (Fox, 1935). She is perhaps best known for an inspired comic creation, Mata Machree, of uncertain ethnicity, in the eccentric 1932 Paramount comedy Million Dollar Legs. However, bending to tie her shoe, she died of heart failure in 1938. Barely out of her twenties, she had been, after a series of successful films, at the peak of her career.6 A career also foreshortened by tragedy was that of Miliza Korjus (Korcjusz).7 She was born in Warsaw in 1909 of Lithuanian-Polish noble stock (Gintowt) on her mother’s side; her father’s family was Estonian. She spent her childhood in Soviet Ukraine but defected as a teenager to Estonia in 1927. On the basis of a brief sojourn in Germany, she was later billed in Hollywood as the “Berlin Nightingale.” A gifted coloratura soprano, she made a fine impression in her first film, MGM’s major 1938 release The Great Waltz, and was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress. Signed for a major role in a new film with Robert\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 13 Taylor and Hedy Lamarr, she was grievously injured in an automobile accident just before the film was to be shot. She spent the war years in Mexico for obscure reasons and never resumed a career that had started spectacularly. In any event, by the outbreak of World War II, she was another very youthful Polish has-been whose Hollywood career was a single film. Her contribution to the Polish presence in Hollywood was further diminished because Korjus was usually regarded as an Estonian, despite her place of birth and her mother’s family.8 Raised by her Polish mother after being abandoned by her Norwegian father, Carole Landis appeared in several films in the late 1930s, including a very minor role in The Emperor’s Candlesticks, which was set in Poland. One of the legendary screen beauties, she managed to reach minor stardom but died by her own hand at twenty-nine after her career failed during World War II after a few notable films. She was probably the best-known actress of Polish descent during the World War II years.9 However, she was from an impoverished background, and her tumultuous personal life and series of film failures prevented her from becoming an established figure. The facts that she performed under a pseudonym and that her birth name was Norwegian also attenuated her connection to Polonia.10 Jean Parker occupies a similar niche in the history of Poles in Hollywood. Born in 1915 in rural Montana as Lois Zelinska, the child of a Polish-French marriage, Parker was raised by foster parents not of Polish origin. A multitalented young woman, she was an accomplished artist and student of Sanskrit. In a long career, she made several dozen films, often in starring roles, particularly in Poverty Row productions, in which she did much of her work. Beautiful and vivacious, Jean Parker was not associated with the Polish community, and her ethnic ancestry was disguised beneath layers of false biographies that she or the studios devised. Because of her childhood circumstances, it seems doubtful that she retained any loyalty to her Polish origins.11 Hardly tragic, though still brief, was the American screen career of the operatic tenor Jan Kiepura.12 Although he had a beautiful voice and considerable charm, he was quite wooden as an actor, and he spoke very little English. Each of his several pre-1939 films was merely a series of arias loosely held together by an insignificant script. Although several of his European films were released in the United States—where they were distributed by Gaumont British Picture Corporation of America—\n\n14â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 only the obscure 1936 release Give Us This Night was a completely American production.13 Kiepura was usually cast as an Italian to comply with the ethnic stereotype of a singer. Though Kiepura had rather little exposure to wider American audiences, he was known to Polish audiences as both a Pole and a patriot, and he long enjoyed a devoted following as a result. Beyond any doubt, the most successful film career of any American Pole was that of Tom Tyler, born in 1903 as Wincenty Markowski in a small village in upstate New York but raised in heavily Polish Hamtramck, Michigan.14 Tyler was a handsome man of titanic strength, a boxer and Olympic weightlifter who was billed in his youth as the strongest man in the United States. He spoke with a heavy Polish accent early in his career and overcame it only with some difficulty. Tyler played in over two hundred films, often as a cowboy, in which role he unfailingly was given an Irish name, probably one of the reasons his true nationality remained unknown to the public. He worked for many studios, primarily the denizens of Poverty Row, and was uniformly badly paid. His powerful physique explained his casting as Captain Marvel in the eponymous serial of 1941 and later as both the Phantom and the dreaded Mummy. Tyler’s legendary strength failed him in the late 1940s, when he was stricken with rheumatoid arthritis and rapidly became crippled. He died penniless and forgotten in Hamtramck at fifty, on the eve of the Polish national holiday, May 3. Ironically, shortly before he died, Tyler’s “fame began to soar” because his old films were appearing frequently on television, but, as his obituaries noted, he gained nothing from them, as he had “neglected to buy the rights to his old pictures.”15 Tom Tyler was briefly an American matinee idol, but few knew of his Polish origins, and he seems not to have associated himself with Polish causes in the United States or with Polonia in general. Never a serious actor, Tyler was primarily an action hero in inexpensive productions or a secondary player in more lavish releases. It is characteristic of Hollywood that in his many screen roles, he never portrayed a Pole.16 Many aspects of his biography are very sketchy, and even his nationality is occasionally misreported as Lithuanian.17 Tyler, like so many other Polish performers in Hollywood, did nothing to increase the visibility of his nationality. Even more egregious health problems severely limited the career of Robert Donat, one of the most celebrated actors in film history despite\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 15 his appearing in only a handful of films.18 Born in Manchester, England, to a Polish immigrant father, Donat was always in fragile health, which prevented him from appearing in many films despite his uniformly outstanding performances. Virtually all of Donat’s roles were in British productions. He visited Hollywood briefly and appeared in only one film produced there, Universal’s 1934 The Count of Monte Cristo. Hence one can scarcely speak of Donat as a Hollywood Pole, though he certainly was a major star. In the United States he was regarded as archetypically English, and his Polish origins were not known. It is perhaps not a coincidence that in one of his greatest roles, the romantic hero of Hitchcock’s 1935 masterpiece The 39 Steps, Donat’s character resides at Poland Place.19 We may well add to this list the name of John Gielgud, scion of a distinguished eastern Polish family. A celebrated Shakespearean actor, Gielgud is another figure whose Polish ancestry is not widely known. Unlike Donat, Gielgud did not appear in any American productions before 1945. Beyond these we have minor players only, and not many of them. Edward Kucharski was born in Warsaw in 1900 and made a number of films in the interwar years and even later. For some reason he billed himself as “Raquello” and often portrayed Latinos or Italians. (Of what nationality someone named Raquello might be is a good question, but Polish is not a candidate.) His pictures were unimportant and his roles less so, peaking with the major role of Emilio Cervantes in the embarrassing 1928 film South of Panama by the forgotten Chesterfield Motion Picture Corporation. By the 1930s, working for larger studios, the best he could do was such roles as “Rodolfo, who bets with El Rayo” in RKO’s very low budget The Girl and the Gambler. By the outbreak of the war, his career was over, though he was still quite young. By the late 1930s, Michal Mazurkiewicz from Tarnopol, in southeastern Poland, began a long career playing thugs and criminals. A huge, homely professional wrestler, Mazurkiewicz acted under the name Mike Mazurki in many films almost until his death in 1990. Though usually cast as a loutish villain, Mazurkiewicz was well educated and something of an intellectual. Before World War II he had only very small parts, and he never became a major player, though his roles grew after 1945. There is much confusion about his nationality because he was born before Poland regained its independence in 1918, and his birth-\n\n16â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 place was incorporated into the Soviet Union after World War II. As a result he was almost never referred to as a Pole. Sources inevitably garble his name and refer to him as Austrian, Hungarian, Ukrainian, or Russian. John Hodiak, born in Pittsburgh of a Ukrainian father and a Polish mother, played in only two major films during the war (1944’s Lifeboat and 1945’s A Bell for Adano). He had a number of major parts later, though his film career was interrupted by several years when he concentrated on the stage, where he displayed considerable talent. Unfortunately he died young, ending a promising career. Tall, handsome, and athletic, Hodiak was one of the very few actors of Polish origin to play romantic leads. He may be the best-known Polish actor of the war era, and he was certainly the only star whose ethnicity was obvious because of his Slavic name. Janina Walasek, born in Chicago in 1923 to Polish immigrant parents, appeared in four films during the war years. In three of these her role was uncredited, and in the fourth she was called only a “Louisiana Belle.” Thereafter she became a minor star under the name Jean Wallace. She was surrounded by coincidental Polish attachments: Her first husband, the near-star Franchot Tone, was widely misreported to be of Polish origin as well, probably because his real first name was Stanislas.20 Years later, Wallace married Cornel Wilde, who played the part of the Pole Chopin in the 1944 MGM film A Song to Remember. Wilde, of Hungarian origin, was also not a Pole. These are but curiosities, however. Turning from actors to directors, Ryszard Bolesławski (Bolesław Ryszard Śrzednicki), a former Polish cavalryman, directed a handful of major films, but he died in 1932. Bolesławski had produced an early Polish documentary chronicling the victory over Soviet Russia in 1920 (Cud nad Wisłą). He arrived in Hollywood in 1929 after a brief sojourn in Germany. Within a few years, Bolesławski not only directed a number of important films but also published a series of books. Among these are two volumes of memoirs, which discuss his extraordinary military adventures in combat against the Russians and reveal Bolesławski as an ardent Polish patriot. Among his major films were Les Miserables (1934) with Frederic March, The Garden of Allah (1935) with Charles Boyer and Marlene Dietrich—one of the first color films—Men in White (1934) with Clark Gable, and The Painted Veil\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 17 (1934) with Greta Garbo. He was a major established figure when he died in his forties.21 His countryman Ryszard Ordyński was a highly acclaimed pioneer director in Poland before World War II who was responsible for such important films as Pan Tadeusz (1928) and the superb 1928 documentary film Sztandar wolności (The Standard of Freedom). Ordyński had been in the United States during World War I, where he served as stage director for the New York Metropolitan Opera and was deeply involved in patriotic and relief work for Poland. He returned in the 1920s to his native land.22 No longer young when he again found himself in America as a refugee during World War II, he had a very minor Hollywood career indeed, consisting almost exclusively of invisibly small character parts and service as a technical adviser. Poland had no major artistic figure in Hollywood during the war years, 1939–1945, although there had been some in the earlier decades and would be again in the postwar years. There were, however, a great many Polish Jews in Hollywood, including Jack and Harry Warner (from central Poland), Samuel Goldwyn (born in Warsaw as Szmuel Gelbfisz), and Louis B. Mayer (from near Minsk in the eastern borderlands, an area now in Belarus), as well as “German” director Ernst Lubitsch (whose family was from Grodno, in eastern Poland).23 The list includes such major stars as Paul Muni (born Mehilen Weisenfreund in Lwów, Austrian Poland), Al Jolson (born in the northeastern borderlands of historic Poland as Asa Joelson), and Illinois-born Jack Benny. To these we may add a large number of minor players like Maurice Cass from Wilno, Leo White from Grudziądz, Jesse de Vorska from Kowno, Kurt Katch from Grodno, George E. Stone from Łódź, Alexander Granach from Galicia, and Baruch Lumet, Freddie Rich, Camille Astor, Anna Held, and Marek Windheim from Warsaw.24 Molly Picon, who was better known for her work in the Yiddish theater, also had a number of films to her credit. Her father was from Warsaw. These actors appeared in scores of films. None of them, however, seem to have associated themselves with the Polish community in America or stressed their attachment to Poland after 1918.25 This is a complicated theme we shall address later. Whereas films about Poland or the Polish community in America were exceedingly rare, there were many films with a rather powerful Russian theme. Hollywood was fascinated with Cossacks and revolu-\n\n18â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 tionaries.26 Early in the silent era, such veterans of the Russian stage as Alla Nazimova attracted a devoted following and were much admired for their training and technical prowess.27 Soon after, Hollywood began producing a large number of films devoted to the tsarist era or to the Russian Revolution. This trend crested in 1928 when MGM released a major film, The Cossacks, based on the Tolstoy novel, that cost almost a million dollars—then an enormous sum—and employed a great many Russians.28 This was merely the most significant of what a Russian émigré referred to a “downpour” of films about Russia being produced by Hollywood.29 Jeff Peck has even discerned a genre of “heroic Russian films” in the 1920s that emphasize the attractive qualities of the Russian people and feature a sympathetic Russian as the main character.30 Hollywood, before World War II, had created a Russian type that populated many films and was a part of the variety expected by viewers.31 Moreover, many of these Russian roles were played by Russians whose nationality was public knowledge. Indeed, a large number of Russians worked throughout the industry, and several had long careers, albeit usually as minor players. Perhaps the best known of these who were still active in the World War II era are Mischa Auer, Maria Ouspenskaya, the aging veteran Nazimova, Leonid Kinskey, Akim Tamiroff, Michael Chekhov, Mikhail Rozumny, Michael Visaroff, and Vladimir Sokoloff.32 Whereas none were performers of the first rank, they appeared in many films, and Chekhov, Tamiroff, and Auer were all nominated for Academy Awards. Olga Baclanova, from Moscow, was a minor star in the 1930s.33 So large was the Russian presence in American films that the New York Times reported, erroneously as it turned out, that there were no fewer than fifteen hundred Russian émigrés in Hollywood.34 In the 1930s American recognition of the Soviet Union prompted a sudden interest in Soviet films. Frank Capra, Cecil B. DeMille, and Lewis Milestone (himself a Russian émigré) were among the directors who wanted to experiment with Soviet themes, stories, and cinema styles. The celebrated director Sergei Eisenstein briefly worked in Hollywood (for Paramount in 1929–1930), further enhancing the prestige of Russian cinema. A number of rather large projects were under way in the 1930s, though none were ever realized. Nonetheless, at least eleven more “Russian” films were released in the 1930s.35 Hence, Brian D. Harvey writes, there was a “longer trajectory” behind the pro-Soviet\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 19 Hollywood propaganda films of World War II, based on decades of Russian themes and actors later complemented by a fascination with Soviet cinema.36 Hollywood thus had a well-developed tradition of favorable and sympathetic depictions of Russians to utilize when it embarked on its wartime celebration of the Soviet Union.37 By 1939 there was a virtual Russian network in Hollywood, including many actors and such studio chieftains as producer Gregory Ratoff and director Milestone. This was convenient. For example, the émigré actor Michael Chekhov had a job waiting for him when he arrived in Hollywood thanks to the intervention of Ratoff and composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. Chekhov, in turn, quickly established a popular acting class frequented by many major players.38 Although many of the Hollywood Russians derived from an earlier, anti-Communist emigration, after 1941 the war did a great deal to submerge old political divisions. Events held at the Soviet Consulate in Los Angeles or designed to raise money for the Red Army were attended by old émigrés in a show of Russian patriotism transcending differences. The fact that after 1941 the Soviet Union was widely and correctly regarded as playing the principal role in defeating Nazi Germany understandably endeared it to the many Jews in the industry despite their established misgivings about Communism and distaste for traditional Russian anti-Semitism.39 “American Jews,” writes Novick, “were the Red Army’s greatest cheerleaders during the war.”40 For the Poles who knew what the Red Army had done to the Poles, this was appalling. During the war, films about Russia often had huge numbers of ethnic Russians portraying characters of their own nationality. For example, Song of Russia (MGM, 1944) featured at least thirty actors born in Russia. By contrast, even the few Polish characters Hollywood presented were almost never portrayed by Poles. Long before World War II, both Hollywood and the American public were far more familiar with Russians and Russia, no matter how depicted, than with Poland and the Poles—including the Poles in America. Poland was a virtual terra incognita.41 In 1943 Warner Brothers claimed that it had difficulty in rendering a putative Warsaw street scene because the studio was unsure what Poles looked like.42 Hollywood’s fascination with the Russians may be explained by the fact that they represented a major world power, though they were a very\n\n20â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 small minority in the United States. However, of all the major European immigrant communities to arrive in turn-of-the-century America—the Irish, the Jews, the Italians, and the Poles—it is only the last group that was ignored by Hollywood. After the mid-1920s, there was a flood of films about the Irish in America; there is nothing comparable regarding any other ethnic group. The Shamrock and the Rose (1927), Underworld (1927), The Racket (1928), Smiling Irish Eyes (1929), Clancy at the Bat (1929), O’Malley Rides Alone (1930), Clancy in Wall Street (1930), The Public Enemy (1931), The Last Mile (1932), Me and My Girl (1932), Clancy of the Mounted (1933), King Kelly of the USA (1934), Irish Hearts (1934), The Irish in Us (1935), We’re Only Human (1935), Princess O’Hara (1935), Dublin in Brass (1935), The Irish Gringo (1936), O’Malley of the Mounted (1936), Boulder Dam (1936), San Francisco (1936), Irish for Luck (1936), Kelly of the Secret Service (1936), Kelly the Second (1936), Rose Bowl (1936; also released as O’Riley’s Luck), Youth on Parole (1937), Clancy in Wall Street (1937), The Great O’Malley (1937), Irish and Proud of It (1938), Sergeant Murphy (1938), In Old Chicago (1938), Irish Luck (1939), Torchy Blane . . . Playing with Dynamite (1939), Three Cheers for the Irish (1940), Knute Rockne All-American (1940), Bullets for O’Hara (1941), and Ride, Kelly, Ride (1941)—each of these films, produced by Hollywood in the years before Pearl Harbor, depicts an Irish main character or is substantially devoted to the Irish in America, often with a cast heavily composed of Irish actors. This is not an exhaustive list; it omits shorts, serial episodes, and many releases by minor studios. But, among other things, it demonstrates the large number of Irish performers available to cast. Irish films were a major genre; indeed the Irish were the most prominently featured ethnic minority in America. Unlike Italians, who are often portrayed as thugs and gangsters, the Irish characters are usually cast in a sentimental and charming light or as admirable figures, like policemen, athletes, and witty reporters. Roman Catholic clergy are almost exclusively Irish in films. There seems little doubt that the Irish were the favorite “other” ethnic for the heavily Jewish motion picture studios of the prewar era. Indeed, Stuart Samuels concludes from the large number of Irish-Jewish films that “the Jews felt” that, “to ‘make it’ in America,” they had to “change their name and to marry the Irish girl or boy next door,” and\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•…21 they made films symbolically conjuring this vision.43 Stephen J. Whitfield observes that “the Irish represented the ethnic group at whom the Jewish hunger for acceptance was most often directed.”44 Certainly the Irish were the only Catholic community frequently and almost always positively presented. This tradition of regular and prominent Irish roles continued during the war years, in which hardly any film failed to feature at least one Irish character, often in a leading and heroic role. Hollywood treated the Irish with enormous and flattering attention.45 This phenomenon is easy to explain. Most important, the Irish came earlier to the United States and arrived in larger numbers than did the Poles. They also had the considerable advantage of speaking English. The Irish played a major role in vaudeville, which later was translated into Broadway and radio. Vaudeville had been replete with both Irish performers—the Four Cohans are merely a convenient example—and Irish-Jewish combinations, of which Gallagher and Shean is the best known. By comparison the Poles, like the Italians, both members of a later immigrant wave, did not have an established role in American entertainment culture by the dawn of the motion picture age. Vaudeville’s ethnic tradition did not include Poles.46 Films were just another step for the Irish along a path virtually untrodden by Poles. With the film age came a well organized and ultimately effective Irish campaign against what they regarded as Hollywood’s derogatory presentation of Irish Catholics in America. The effort, which crested in the late 1920s, led to the decision by Hollywood to establish the Production Code, which was written by two Irish Catholics, and enforced by another, the anti-Semitic Joseph I. Breen.47 Although the issue is often presented as a compromise between Hollywood and Catholic America, this is rather misleading. The major force that convinced Hollywood to concede to this organized censorship was an almost exclusively Irish lobby.48 A particular target of Irish animosity was the Warner Brothers studio, which epitomized the “‘Jewish Trust’ hell-bent on destroying the Irish.”49 In Hollywood after 1930, propitiating the Catholics became in effect patronizing the Irish. Before the late 1920s, Hollywood had occasionally portrayed the Irish as drunks and hooligans; that changed markedly thereafter. Other Catholic communities in America, the Italians and Poles for example, only much later launched efforts to defend their communities’ image; both were insignificant. The Irish in America were able to use their dominant position in the Catholic Church to force\n\n22â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 Hollywood to a lasting and very rewarding compromise.50 Michael Freedland, the Warners’ biographer, notes that Jack’s most frequent concern about a film was “What would the Catholics say?”51 Functionally that became, What would the Irish say? This sensitivity was accompanied by a notion that the Irish were peculiarly sympathetic to Jews because they had similarly experienced racial and religious persecution, which became axiomatic in Hollywood.52 Lester D. Friedman notes that “Hollywood, from its earliest days, happily paired the Jews and the Irish” and cites a popular slogan in the industry: “The sun cannot shine in Ireland when it’s raining in Jerusalem.”53 During World War II, efforts by the Polish community to protest what it regarded as Hollywood’s insulting treatment of Poles were little more than a minor nuisance to the studios. The Italians, stigmatized by Mussolini’s alliance with Hitler, were silent. Hollywood continued its established pro-Irish tradition increasingly reinforced by inertia. If “the representation of ethnicity” in films reflected “power,” the Poles would be invisible.54 Ana M. Lopez argues that ethnic groups had a “golden moment” in Hollywood when film become “temporarily more sensitive” to them.55 The Poles are an exception. Indeed, there is a subgenre of Irish-Jewish film in which both ethnic groups are featured in comic but affectionate juxtaposition. These IrishJewish stories are symbolic reconciliation films for two major immigrant groups, with the Catholic community represented exclusively by the Irish.56 The “Jewish boy falls in love with Irish girl” story is frequently and symbolically repeated.57 There is no equivalent ItalianJewish or Polish-Jewish subgenre.58 With the Irish functioning as the representatives of all Catholics in America, non-Irish Catholics were reduced to insignificance. The best-known example of the reconciliation subgenre is The Cohens and Kellys series of seven films released in the late 1920s and early 1930s, but there were a number of others, many from the silent era. D. W. Griffith alone was responsible for several of these in the pre–World War I years. Later the trend continued, even increasing, including such films as Second Hand Rose (1922), Fool’s Highway (1924), The Rag Man (1925), Old Clothes (1925), One of the Bravest (1925), Sweet Daddies (1926), Izzy and Lizzie (1926), Clancy’s Kosher Wedding (1927), Sally in Our Alley (1927), Sweet Rosie O’Grady (1927), A Harp in Hock (1927), For the Love of Mike (1927),\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•…23 Frisco Sally Levy (1927), the often remade Abies’s Irish Rose (1928), Kosher Kitty Kelly (1926), Pleasure before Business (1927), Around the Corner (1930), Princess O’Hara (1935), and two George Jessel vehicles, Private Izzy Murphy and Sailor Izzy Murphy. Perhaps the ultimate exemplar of this theme is Irish Jimmy Cagney bursting into Yiddish in 1932’s Taxi!59 Samuels observes that the number of films of this genre is “staggering.”60 Compared to the omnipresence of the Irish in Hollywood films, Jewish characters were rarer in major roles, though very frequently portrayed. The Jazz Singer (1927) is a famous example. We should note that in this film the cantor, Rabinowitz, becomes enamored of an Irish girl (May McAvoy as Mary Dale). Nonetheless the number of films devoted to the Jews is very large, and they are almost without exception sympathetic. There were a considerable number of silent films with Jewish themes and characters, and then an explosion occurred in the 1920s, when, according to one scholar’s count, there were ninety-five Jewish portrayals.61 Jewish characters are significant cast members, or there are multiple lesser Jewish characters, in a great many films: Love ’Em and Feed ’Em (1927), Why Girls Say No (1927), Cheaters (1927), Sunshine of Paradise Alley (1927), The Shamrock and the Rose (1927), The Last Parade (1931), Symphony for Six Million (1931), Cimarron (1931), Women of All Nations (1931), The Spider (1931), Are You Listening? (1932), Blessed Event (1932), Hypnotized (1932), The World Gone Mad (1933), Pilgrimage (1933), Girls’ Dormitory (1936), Roamin’ Wild (1936), The Little Red Schoolhouse (1936), Star for a Night (1936), Make Way for Tomorrow (1937), That I May Live (1937), Our Daily Bread (1937), George White’s 1935 Scandals (1935), 23½ Hours Leave (1937), Man of the People (1937), and Gateway (1938). There are doubtless others.62 Although the characters may not be referred to as Jewish in the scripts, they are given names like Solomon Levy, Mr. Chutzpah, and Cherokee Cohen and are portrayed almost exclusively by Jewish émigré actors from Central and Eastern Europe who speak (after the silent era) with strong accents. In addition to these Jewish characters scattered about, we have specific films in which Jews or Jewish settings are fundamental to the story. These include the several Irish-Jewish films mentioned earlier as well as Jewish Prudence (1927), Don’t Tell Everything (1927), Jake the Plumber (1927), The Ghetto (1928), Jazz Mad (1928), The\n\n24â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 Younger Generation (1929), Around the Corner (1930), Uptown New York (1932), and, perhaps most prominent, the affectionate evocation of the Jewish Lower East Side in Warner Brothers’ The Heart of New York (1932), as well as the hagiographic historical epic by Twentieth Century The House of Rothschild (1934). There were two biographies of Disraeli (1921 and 1929), and even a film called George Washington Cohen in 1928.We should also note the production Dr. Ehrlich’s Magic Bullet, which was released just after the war began in 1940, among several others. In sum, identifiably Jewish characters appeared in scores of Hollywood productions before World War II, and there were a number of films about Jews and Jewish themes. None of these films portray them in a negative light. The relatively large number of Jewish films reflects the facts that the Jewish immigration to the United States preceded the Polish arrival by perhaps a generation and that the Jews—like the Irish—quickly established themselves in the entertainment industry. Later immigrants, Eastern and Southern Europeans, arrived at a time when certain ethnic types were already created by vaudeville, Broadway, and later radio. Hence they did not figure in the pre–motion picture world of popular culture. There were no Polish equivalents of the Marx brothers, Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Burns and Allen, or Jack Benny. The Yiddish theater also acted as a link to the American stage for Jews. Karen Majewski, in a pioneering study, shows that a Polish-American literature did develop to impressive dimensions among the immigrants, but it was a parochial culture that did not escape the ethnic community.63 The Irish and the Jews, by comparison, made successful transitions to a wider American presence. As Albert McClean notes, films were “not prepared to initiate the Italian or the Slav directly into the American way of life.”64 There was no Polish stereotype in entertainment that film could inherit. Among the turn-of-the-century immigrants, the Italians are a much more frequent presence than the Poles, though still insignificant compared to the Irish and Jews. Certainly, it took many decades for the Godfather genre to make the Italians a major ethnic presence in film, but already during the silent film era, Italians were featured in an “impressive number” of films. George Beban virtually made a career of Italian roles in a series of early releases.65 Carlos E. Cortés has discovered quite a number of Italian films from the silent era, a few condescending, but others, like The Italian (1914), sympathetic.66 Luis Alberni, born in\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•…25 Catalonia, played no fewer than forty-three roles as an Italian (often named Luigi).67 Thus Alberni alone accounts for more Italian characters in prewar Hollywood films than all the Polish characters in all prewar Hollywood films combined.68 But Alberni was not alone; there were several actors who repeatedly appeared as Italians: Harry Semels, for example, who also occasionally played Jewish characters, and J. Carrol Naish, who played at least seven Italian roles in the 1930s alone.69 We should not forget that one of the Marx brothers, Chico, was presented as an Italian in the comedies he and his brothers produced in the 1930s. Positive, if minor, roles for “Italians,” often employing heavy accents and much gesticulation, were thus a commonplace in prewar Hollywood.70 Though negative Italians appeared in a few post–World War I films,71 Song of the City (1937) is set among the Italian community of San Francisco, which is portrayed affectionately. Winterset (1936) also focuses on the Italians in America, though it is rather darker. The main characters are Italian in The Bride Wore Red (1938), Love, Live, and Laugh (1929), A Lady to Love (1930), Street Scene (1931), and Kid Galahad (1937). In the latter there is even an extended scene in which the characters converse in Italian. A similar theme, Italians in boxing, is the theme of Golden Boy (1939) and of East of the River (1940), which featured a great many putative Italians.72 They Knew What They Wanted (1940) is a touching portrayal of a noble Italian farmer (Charles Laughton, perhaps strangely cast) in California.73 The Florentine Dagger (1938) is set, appropriately, in Florence. Other films set in Italy include The White Sister (1923, remade in 1933) and The Wages of Virtue (1924). Beyond this, there were leading Italian characters, albeit of a negative sort, in the spate of crime films that made Italians regular Hollywood players in the 1930s.74 Even the Italian-as-gangster film, however, usually included other Italians who were more admirable or even portrayed the gangsters as “basically decent people who chose criminality out of frustration over the apparent obstacles to legitimately-attained success.”75 The Italian characters were not always the positive figures that the Irish and Jewish characters were, but they were a visible part of the American scene. Hence audiences became used to ethnic characters sprinkled about, but even in films that for obvious reasons wish to emphasize the ethnic\n\n26â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 variety of the country, Poles are conspicuously absent. Examples of this are numerous. The Warner Brothers crime comedy A Slight Case of Murder (1938) is dominated by the villainous (yet lovable) Italian mobster Marco and his henchman Giuseppe, joined by characters named Rosenbloom and Cohen and also Gallagher and Ryan. Ironically, a minor part in the film is played by the Polish Carole Landis, but her character is known only as “the blonde” and has no indicated ethnicity. I Hate Women (1934), by obscure Goldsmith Productions, features a leading character named McGuire and lesser players Casey and Flanagan, joined by a Cohen. There are, again, no Poles. High Pressure (1932), a Warner Brothers film, features an Irishman (Mike Donahay), an Italian (Colombo), a Jew (Colonel Ginsburg), and even a Greek (Poppolus), but no Poles. The cast of the 1937 MGM exploration of urban corruption, Man of the People, is almost exclusively supposed Irish and Italians with a Jewish character or two. In 1938 Paramount released another of the crime-comedy films, You and Me, featuring every imaginable urban ethnic type, including a Mr. and Mrs. Abie Levine and even a character identified as a Swede. Again, neither film contains Poles, even in the most minor roles. The Twentieth Century–Fox service film Sub Patrol (1938), directed by the Irish John Ford, features a heavily Irish crew (Quincannon, Haggerty, McPeek, McAllison, Duffy, and Kelly) but also a Goldfarb, a Luigi, and an Olaf. There are, however, no Central or Eastern Europeans at all. Crime films, so popular in the 1930s, were usually heavily ethnic. United Artists’ famous gangster film Scarface (1932), for example, is replete with Italian characters. Ironically, they were played by a Polish Jew (Paul Muni), a Czech (Anna Dvorak), and a German (George Raft), among others, and the film also has a Jewish character, Epstein. Both the gangsters and the police in Warner Brothers’ Public Enemy (1931) are mostly Irish, with one possibly Jewish character (Nails Nathan).76 Edward G. Robinson’s career-launching Little Caesar (Warner Brothers, 1931) was largely a matter of Italian thugs and Irish police, but it had a Russian (Olga Strassoff) added for variety. Republic’s slapdash gangster saga The Return of Jimmy Valentine (1936) has a large cast of characters, almost all Irish or Italian. Most of the inmates and their warders in both The Racket (1928) and The Last Mile (1932) are Irish or Italian, though a few other nationalities are depicted. However, no Poles are included in any of these films on either side of the law. In\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•…27 Hollywood, it seems, Poles literally could not even get arrested.77 This list, and this characterization, could be extended almost limitlessly. The absence of Polish images in the films of prewar Hollywood is striking. The ethnic theme in American films visibly faded in the 1930s. The resurgence of nativism and pressure to assimilate played a considerable role, especially for an industry like Hollywood, in which the foreignborn constituted a large percentage of the workforce.78 Organized antiSemitism, both in Europe and in the United States, and the trepidation of Jewish studio moguls certainly explain the sudden decline in Jewish films by the mid-1930s.79 Fascism in Italy probably contributed to the drop in Italian films, though the number here was always quite modest. Crime films, unusually urban and ethnic, also peaked in the mid1930s and faded thereafter; as a result, fewer Italians were depicted. As Kracauer observes, the early period in which Russian films were quite positive, or at least nostalgic, was followed by a brief era in which the only Russian films were a handful satirizing the Soviets, Comrade X and Ninotchka being the best known.80 As for the Poles, as we have seen, they never were a major theme for Hollywood, and this did not change. Although the World War II period produced no films focused on the Polish, Italian, or Jewish community or its major figures, it did include The Sullivans, about Irish in the navy, and two films about the Irish in World War I (The Fighting 69th and The Iron Major), as well as biographies of two Irish American prizefighters, James J. Corbett (Gentleman Jim) and John L. Sullivan (The Great John L), the vaudevillian George M. Cohan (Yankee Doodle Dandy), the thug Roger Touhy (Roger Touhy, Gangster), the saloon keeper Mary Louise Cecilia “Texas” Guinan (Incendiary Blonde), and the aviator “Wrong Way” Corrigan (The Flying Irishman), among others. This is in addition to the endless production of Irish-themed fictional films. One of the major reasons for the absence of Polish themes in wartime American films is that there was no tradition of such depictions from the preceding era. Polish observers of film were concerned about the virtual absence of Poland, Poles, and Polish themes from the world’s cinema, especially Hollywood productions. Things Polish rarely appeared, and when they did they were often presented inaccurately, unflatteringly, or incomprehensibly. Warsaw film commentator Jerzy Bossak wrote exasperatedly in 1938, “In these circumstances the Polish theme in foreign\n\n28â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 films frequently takes the form of propaganda directed against Poland and the Poles. Consciously and targeted libels do less damage than a film made without hostile intention which makes its way around the globe propagating everywhere its irresponsible ignorance.”81 Hence it is important to consider the very few exceptions in the pre-1939 era. The Polish motif in Hollywood consists of only a handful of examples. Films devoted to Poland are almost nonexistent. The Polish community in America is the focus of a few films, but even here Poles are usually treated marginally or their nationality is ambiguous.82 Whereas there are Jews, Irish, and Italians in films, the Poles, to use Ella Shohat’s expression, were “subject to homogenization.”83 Probably the only major silent film to feature Poles was the 1924 D. W. Griffith melodrama Isn’t Life Wonderful.84 Although usually described as the saga of Polish refugees trying desperately to survive in Berlin after World War I, the film is really not about Poles at all.85 To be sure, the refugees have arrived from Poland, but they are almost certainly to be understood as Germans leaving Poland. Not one has a Polish name, a picture of the kaiser is featured in the family home, and all seem to speak German. Of course, why Poles would seek refuge in Germany at a time of intense Polish-German antagonism is the most obvious question. Only a slightly ridiculous traveling entertainer who boards with the family refers to himself as having performed in Poland; that is the limit of the main characters’ Polish credentials. Hence, even in what is probably the most significant silent film devoted to Poles, there are probably no Poles at all. Perhaps the earliest sound film version of the ambiguous Polish presence is the 1934 Palooka, released by Reliance Pictures and distributed by United Artists, based on the long-running comic strip by Ham Fisher.86 Palooka is a huge and rather slow-witted farm boy who becomes heavyweight boxing champion. Though cloddish, he is kind and gentle and, on balance, a positive character. The film mentions nothing about Palooka’s ethnicity; nonetheless, his name suggests Eastern European origin, as it approximates “Pakula,” a not uncommon Polish surname, particularly for Polish Jews. Curiously, in both the original comic strip and the 1934 film, Palooka is fair and blond, unlike the usual later Hollywood Pole, who is short and swarthy. Wagner and Buhle contend that Palooka was understood to be Polish (even though they offer no proof for the assertion) and a rather demeaning reference\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•…29 at that, as Palooka was obviously intended to be a simpleton.87 This is more than plausible, as Ham Fisher invented the original character on the basis of a “big, burly, and inarticulate boxer” he met outside a poolroom in his native Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, home to a substantial community of Poles (and other immigrants). Fisher originally named the character Joe Dumbelletski, which tells us much of both what the character was to be and Fisher’s taste.88 Hence the prototype of the cinematic Palooka was probably supposed to be a Pole, perhaps the first “dumb Polack” stereotype that Hollywood later did so much to propagate. Though there were postwar screen versions of Palooka, during World War II he was exclusively a comic strip character after this 1934 release.89 Rather more serious is the 1935 Warner Brothers film Black Fury, set contemporaneously in the Pennsylvania coalfields.90 Like a number of other Warner Brothers films of the era, it explores the pathetic lives of the underclass in America, here focusing on the poor wages, wretched conditions, and dangerous lives of the miners. Though a few of them are obviously supposed to be Irish, Italian, or African American, the bulk are vaguely Eastern European, though that term is very elastic for Warner Brothers. The film was based on a combination of two literary properties. The first, a play titled Bohunk: A Melodramatic Comedy, was the work of Harry R. Irving in 1932.91 Set in a squalid house in Pottsville, it is replete with Polish characters, all of them similarly primitive and repulsive. Mrs. Mancaweitz, for example, is charmingly described by Irving as “a Pole . . . masculine in a foreign way. A perfect slatternly type that has worked hard all her life.”92 However, although this creature and a few others are Poles, the hero is Joe Radek, a “stolid Hungarian” who quite clearly regards himself as superior to his fellow immigrants on the basis of his Magyar descent.93 He is a charming ignoramus who prevails after a series of complex and windy scenes. Warner Brothers also possessed another property, “Joe Volkanik,” written by Judge M. A. Musmanno, which Warner Brothers immediately renamed “Black Hell.”94 This story, rather more serious than the Irving piece, is much less specific about the nationalities of the cast of generic Eastern Europeans. It begins with a long preamble about labor unrest and the dangers and privations endured by the miners. The protagonist, the volcanic Mr. Volkanik, “heavily built, stodgy,” is a cheer-\n\n30â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 ful primitive who inadvertently injures his fellow miners through his “doltishness.”95 Warner Brothers assigned Abem Finkel to combine these quite different sources into a script originally titled “Black Hell,” the first draft of which was available by April 1934.96 The main setting has become the home of a miner named Shemanski, probably a Pole but not specifically so identified. His boarder is Joe Radek, whose Hungarian nationality has not accompanied his name from the Irving script.97 He now has no specific nationality at all. After several drafts Radek emerges as an ignorant and stupid though genial man. The story hinges on his cloddishness, which produces a major strike with accompanying violence, which he regrets and eventually, miraculously, rights.98 He speaks an idiolect largely composed of mangled clichés. His culture is indicated by his wistful hope that “now maybe Annah and me go raise pigs and kids.”99 By the fall of 1934, screenwriter Carl Erickson had joined Finkel, and the script gained sharper focus. Key action is set in Moravia Hall. The Novak family, which has a major role (Joe is infatuated with Annah Novak), is identified as Slovak.100 No other characters have defined nationalities. However, the writers provided an ethnographic analysis of the population they sought to conjure: “In the faces of the miners we see the heterogeneous mixture of race and nationality which is characteristic of the Pennsylvania coal fields. Stolid, high-cheek-boned Poles; docile Lithuanians; and rugged, smiling Slovaks predominate. Interspersed with these are the swarthy, excitable Italian, and the meek, wide-eyed Negro. Here and there are some Nordic faces, mostly Welsh and Irish, descendants of the men who first worked these coal fields.”101 Released in 1935 as Black Fury, the film starred Paul Muni as the generic Eastern European Joe Radek. Muni had a central role in the birth of the film: he had bought the rights to the Irving play and provided them to Warner Brothers.102 Muni, a Polish Jew from Lwów, in Austrian Galicia, was a veteran of the Yiddish stage and came from a theatrical family.103 Muni obviously regarded the Radek character he portrayed as a Pole. In preparing for the role, he dyed his dark hair blond and had the studio makeup artists provide him with what was described as “a typical 15-cent Pennsylvania coal-town haircut,” achieved by fitting his head with a “cereal bowl.” The result satisfied Muni, who announced, “That I guarantee you is a Polock, born and reborn.”104 We may assume that\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 31 screenwriter Finkel shared Muni’s conception of the character. Finkel was Muni’s brother-in-law and owed his position at Warner Brothers to the actor’s intervention. Finkel was known at the studio as “Muni’s writer” because he would doctor scripts to suit the actor’s fancy. It is thus inconceivable that Finkel would not adopt Muni’s view that Radek was Polish.105 However, in the film, Radek’s Polishness is ambiguous at best. The only references to nationality issues are Moravia Hall and a Slovak dance hall; there are no Polish locales. Muni twice sings ostensibly Slavic ditties, but they are virtually incomprehensible and include only a few Western Slavic words. His accent is not Polish but rather Czech or Slovak, as indicated by his tendency to pronounce names with initial rather than penultimate accentuation, the major phonological difference between Czech and Slovak on the one hand and Polish on the other. Indeed, despite Muni’s rather crude reference about his appearance, a viewer would conclude that Radek is probably intended to be a Slovak for most of the film. This, however, is complicated by a sequence near the conclusion in which Muni beats a foul thug who has murdered his friend while repeatedly referring to him as a Cossack, an opprobrious reference that would be quite logical for a Pole but not at all for a Czech or Slovak.106 The mining police refer to the miners generically as “Hunkies” and “Hunyaks”—vague terms of, it seems, ethnic-cumoccupational derision employed in more than one Warners Brothers film.107 Hence Paul Muni’s Radek is perhaps meant to be a Polish character—certainly Muni saw him as that—but that is hardly clear to viewers.108 It is noteworthy that the Slovak community in America was certain that Radek was intended to be one of their number. The contemporary Polish-language press does not seem to have made a similar claim for this dubious attribution.109 Black Fury is replete with Eastern Europeans, but they are not differentiated. Indeed, the story seems purposely to obfuscate nationality issues. Radek is on balance an ambiguous figure. He is a loyal friend with a primitive but real sense of decency and fairness. When sober, he behaves well and is liked and respected by his fellows. However, he is also crude and ignorant. He is reckless and easily manipulated, childlike in his simplicity. People like him could never be given positions of authority or responsibility. They must be led, controlled, and\n\n32â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 watched. Strong and tough, they are ideal for manual work but racially predestined for the lower orders. Muni—who often descended to gross overacting—played his role with a perpetual look of vacuity, frightened and disoriented when faced with even simple questions. As a reviewer noted, Muni rendered Radek an “inspired interpretation of the moronic Slav” with “physical Newfoundland dog roughness,” exhibiting “the dull workings of his childlike mind.”110 Black Fury gives us a valuable insight into Hollywood’s vision of the American Slav, including the Pole, in the 1930s. We also learn perhaps how Muni saw Poles, but that is a minor matter. In the mid-1930s, there were two explorations of Poles in rural America. The 1934 Warner Brothers film As the Earth Turns was based on a novel by Maine localist Gladys Hasty Carroll.111 This, her first novel, was both a popular and critical success, and Warner Brothers rushed it into production. The story is quite simple and rather tedious. A family of Poles—the Janowskis—takes possession of a dilapidated farm in rural Maine. The local population, though initially suspicious of such exotics, gradually learns to see them as hardworking and earnest, though most peculiar. The oldest son, Stan, wins the affection of Jen Shaw, the admirable daughter of an old Yankee family. The Janowskis decide to abandon their Maine farm for Boston. Stan, however, has developed a great love of farming and has decided to stay. He is virtually adopted by the Shaws, and, as the novel concludes, all the auguries are that Stan and Jen will soon wed and rural Maine will have assimilated a Pole with many fine qualities.112 Despite the fact that the Poles were a major element of her story, Carroll admittedly knew nothing about them, and her portrait of them is preposterous.113 One of the Poles is named Manuel, a Spanish name; another is called Ondia, which Carroll concocted; and a third, a girl, is Marion, a version of which could only be a man’s name in Polish.114 The family is, apparently, traditionally in the garment business—which would have been highly unusual for Polish gentiles—but they decide to become farmers.115 This notion is obviously necessary to show the Poles, an agricultural people, to be quite unfamiliar with basic farming techniques in their new setting. Although presumably Roman Catholic, they assimilate effortlessly into a Protestant milieu—not a reasonable assertion. The Polish characters have no identifiable characteristics except an inability to control themselves when music is played, unleash-\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 33 ing primitive passions that cause them to jump about quite madly. They speak like vaudeville comedians (and never employ a single Polish word), except for Stan, who has neither accent nor residual Polish lexical elements. It is very important to the author to stress that all of them have “black eyes,” in contrast to the blue-eyed Americans. Hence the children have “fat, dark . . . faces . . . with shoe-button eyes.”116 The only other thing we learn about the “Polocks” is that they are tough and powerful; their imperviousness to pain and suffering disconcerts the more civilized Americans.117 Unfortunately, they are also quite stupid; hence Mrs. Janowski, though she is the mother of a large family, has no idea how to care for a sick child, and Jen, a mere girl, has to give her basic guidance.118 In addition to the Janowskis there is another Pole—there are vague allusions that he is Jewish—who, though loyal to his countrymen, is virtually a crook.119 Though he is called Keele, his real name is “something unpronounceable,” and the author suggests that his surname is so astounding that even he cannot remember it.120 He is also named Manuel.121 Stan is obviously the key to the Poles’ function in the story. He, inexplicably, has blue eyes, unlike his swarthy family, and the locals conclude that he does not “look much Polish.”122 He is assimilated into the community; the departure of his family is the symbolic extirpation of his Polish roots. He becomes an American by ceasing to be Polish. He is useful breeding stock for the melting pot; the others are jettisoned. Warner Brothers, wishing to capitalize on the book’s popularity, hurried production of the film version. A huge publicity effort accompanied the release in 1934, with a “special campaign” orchestrated from Chicago.123 Warner Brothers stressed that this was to be a “realistic” film, one “with as little change as possible from the original text.” As a result, “this film reflects Truth” and is a “bunkless picture” with “utter freedom from hokum.” Indeed, Warner Brothers piously claimed that it cared not at all for the “entertainment” aspects of the film. To bear witness to its efforts, the studio distributed opinion cards in theater lobbies to compass viewers’ reactions to their bunkless efforts.124 This campaign attracted wide attention in the press, and the film was positively reviewed. Its debut in Dallas—an oddly chosen site—was much ballyhooed.125\n\n34â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 Carroll was not pleased with the result. She was in Hollywood during the film’s production and offered a great many suggestions, all of which were apparently ignored. She found the “no hokum” campaign ridiculous and the film an “absurdity.” However, in the detailed critique she sent to producer Hal Wallis, all her complaints concerned minor matters of local color: diction, lexicon, agricultural terminology.126 Regarding the film’s fidelity to her novel in terms of the story and characters, she had no criticism. The Polish aspects of the story were never mentioned in her correspondence with Warner Brothers; evidently they were as she wished them to be. The film, unfortunately, retains the implausible features of the book. Stan wishes to be a farmer but is also a violinist; his family fails at farming because they are really practiced in the garment trade. The notion of Polish tailors and violinists seeking to be farmers strains credulity. The Poles are portrayed as hardworking and stalwart and rather less “fat and dark” than Carroll indicated.127 In general they are a minor element of the film, though they are pleasantly primitive and addicted to dance.128 Stan, played by the handsome minor star Donald Woods, wins the affections of more than one local Yankee girl in the film, a rarity among Hollywood’s Polish portrayals. He is probably the most positive major Polish character in prewar American films. Reviewers of the film—like those of the book—virtually never mentioned the Poles, which certainly reflected Carroll’s indifference. For her, as for the critics, this is a story about life in Maine, and the Poles are simply a handful of exotics who allow us to better appreciate Maine’s foibles. The huge collection of reviews and comments Carroll assembled about her cinematic triumph contains virtually no mention of the film’s (or the book’s) Polish elements.129 The most elaborate exploration of the Polish community in America was the 1935 United Artists melodrama The Wedding Night, which gives us another portrait of rural Poles.130 Here, however, they appear not as harmless aliens but as repulsive barbarians. Gary Cooper stars as a novelist, Tony Barret, who, after an initial success, has produced increasingly bad and repetitious books. His literary descent is accompanied if not facilitated by a life of sybaritic self-indulgence. Penniless when his latest novel is rejected by his publisher, he and his frivolous wife Dora (Helen Vinson) are forced to abandon Manhattan for his longforgotten family home in rural Connecticut. Here a local informs him\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 35 that the area has recently become crowded with Polish tobacco farmers. Tony becomes fascinated by his “Polock” neighbors, whom he considers “something out of another world,” and decides to portray them in his new novel. In particular he is enchanted by the bright, attractive Manya Novak (Anna Sten), with whom he quickly becomes infatuated. His attentions are resented by Manya’s father (Siegfried Rumann), who has already promised the girl to Frederik Sobieski (Ralph Bellamy), a loutish neighbor. Tony’s wife quickly tires of rural life and returns to New York. Unencumbered, Tony ardently pursues Manya. A blizzard traps Manya at Tony’s house, where she chastely spends the night. Her reputation is nonetheless compromised, and her father insists she marry Sobieski immediately to save what is left of family honor. In the meanwhile, Tony’s wife returns and reads his new Connecticut novel, which is a thinly disguised account of his rejuvenation as a man and a writer inspired by the fresh charm of the beautiful Manya. The story comes rapidly now to denouement. Manya is forced to marry Sobieski after a grotesque celebration. (Here too the Poles are given to savage dancing.) Tony is close enough to hear the raucous sounds of the Polish revelry. After much anguish, he becomes drunk and, uninvited, intrudes on the reception, causing a scene. Sobieski, hopelessly inebriated, realizes that his new wife loves Tony and decides to kill him. He follows Tony back to his house; a fight ensues on the staircase. Manya tries to intercede and falls over backward in the attempt. She is fatally injured. After a few hours she dies, leaving Tony bereft. Dora behaves handsomely in observing the final hours of the dying and quite innocent Manya and the agony of Tony.131 How the Poles are affected is not shown. Although the film was well crafted and Cooper, never a versatile actor, gave an unusually nuanced performance, it was not successful. Its depressing conclusion is often blamed for this; audiences found it unsatisfying despite generally positive reviews. Director King Vidor regarded the film very highly, though it was on balance “a flop.”132 Producer Samuel Goldwyn demonstrated his legendary incomprehensibility by describing the romantic interlude of the two principals thus: “If this scene isn’t the greatest love scene ever put on film, the whole goddamned picture will go right up out of the sewer.”133 The Poles emerge in this film as a completely unpleasant community. Manya’s father, Jan Novak, is a cold, domineering tyrant who is\n\n36â•… Hollywood’s War with Poland, 1939–1945 also a cunning and dishonest businessman. Manya’s intended, Sobieski, is revolting: vulgar, drunken, and stupid. The other Poles are merely a blur of oddly costumed peasants. The film is at pains to differentiate the Poles from the dissolute but nonetheless genteel Barrets. The adult Poles, for example, dine like beasts, and their children eat what leavings they can find, a Polish family tradition not known beyond the confines of the United Artists studio. A long scene is devoted to the grotesque gluttony of the Poles, observed with fascinated revulsion by Tony. The most striking characteristic of the Polish men is their abominable treatment of women. They never refer to their wives as “wives” but only and disdainfully as their “women.” The poor souls are forced to work like cattle and are treated with brutality by their husbands. Indeed, Polish men and women are portrayed rather differently: The men are uniformly vile, without any redeeming virtue. By contrast, the women are merely pathetic. The local Yankees are appalled by the Poles, whom they regard as incomprehensible primitives; the viewer is enjoined to adopt a like attitude. Raymond Durgnat and Scott Simmon make a perceptive observation concerning the film’s depiction of the Poles as central to the story: It is hard to say how far Goldwyn, or Vidor, wanted Polish “alienness” to bear the brunt of the blame [for the tragic denouement]. Our suspicion is that spectators whose immigrant family experience is fresh in memory would treat Manya’s fate as a tragic anomaly, while authors (and there will be the majority) would have veered nearer the anti-Polish response. To wit: While Polish immigrants may eventually be capable of aspiring to Americanism, as young Manya does, old Polish ways are not merely different, or out-of-place, but in themselves bad. . . . Her plight comes over as entirely her community’s fault.134 Polish film critics lamented the gross inaccuracies in the film’s portrayal of their countrymen. They wear exotic costumes, a mélange of styles. Similarly, they speak a sort of common Slavic, with elements from Russian and Ukrainian thrown about for linguistic seasoning, all of it enunciated with much gesticulation and rolling of eyes. Their names are a grab bag of strange sounds. Hence Tony’s novel—supposedly based on the local Poles, with Manya the invaluable native informant—fea-\n\nThe Polish Presence in American Cinema before 1939â•… 37 tures principals named Sonya and Henirich, neither of which is Polish. Sobieski, the name of the Polish hero king of the seventeenth century, is given to Manya’s cloddish suitor, a reference that still makes Polish viewers wince. The Wedding Night was based on a story by Edwin Knopf and written for the screen by Edith Fitzgerald. Neither knew anything about the Polish community in America. The director, King Vidor, was a Texan of radical leftist inclination.135 Among the principals, Cooper, Vinson, and Bellamy were Americans. Siegfried Rumann, who later shortened his name to Sig Ruman, by which he is better known, was an Austrian expatriate. Sten is a curious figure. Little is known of her biography except that she was born in Kiev in 1908, supposedly of SwedishUkrainian origin. Her original name was reportedly Anel Sudakevich, which appears to be a garbled version of a Polish name.136 Indeed, she correctly pronounces the few Polish words she speaks in the film.137 Supposedly she could not speak English until the early 1930s. Her first films were not successful. Though she had a handful of subsequent roles, her costarring billing with Cooper in The Wedding Night was the zenith of her career, which quickly thereafter declined. The film presents no positive Polish characters, and the Poles’ culture and behavior are repulsive. Only Manya is an exception, and she, symbolically, wishes to leave her community for the company of Tony, the “other.” Indeed, in a key scene, her father beats and denounces her for wishing to be an “American girl” when she must remain a “Polish girl”—not "
