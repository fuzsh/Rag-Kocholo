The Slovaks,\n\nSlovenians, the Chroatians (Slavonians) etc. It is an old-old Hungarian name for\n\nthese ethnic groups. Proof of how old, may be found in the fact that it\n\nbecame a frequent Hungarian surname, mostly with the old Hungarian spelling: TOTH,\n\nand may also be found among the names of localities, like To'tfalu,\n\nTo'tkomlo's, Lengyelto'ti etc.\n\nIt has been a non-derogative, friendly, non-official way to refer to those\n\nof such background living in Hungary as minorities.\n\nHope, this will help...\n\nLeslie Eloed\n\nCalifornia USA\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nIn a message dated 6/19/2006 11:28:16 P.M.

According some Jewis sources Bekescsaba was also called Tatcsaba, which might come >from the word Tot.\n\nBest regards\n\nGabor Hirsch\n\n-------- Original-Nachricht --------\n\nDatum: Mon, 19 Jun 2006 08:55:53 -0400\n\nVon: Laura Steele <lsteele6@...>\n\nAn: H-SIG <h-sig@...>\n\nBetreff: [h-sig] Surname TOTH\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nDoes anyone know the derivation of the surname of Toth?
