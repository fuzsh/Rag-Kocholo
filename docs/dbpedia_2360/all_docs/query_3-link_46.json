Probably everyone in Slovakia has come across someone with one of these surnames as they are the most common surnames in Slovakia.\n\nThe Interior Ministry has published the list. They also explained the origin of the surnames alongside Iveta Valentová, a linguist from the Ľ. Štúr Linguinstics Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.\n\nBoth Horváth and Tóth belong among ethnic surnames. Horvát means \"Croat\" in Hungarian and the surname Tóth was created from the word \"Tót,\" originally used by Hungarians for Slovaks, as well as other non-Hungarian nationalities of the Hungarian Empire."
