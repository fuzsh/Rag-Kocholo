Does anyone know the derivation of the surname of Toth? It apparantly is

not a regular word, I looked it up in my Hungarian dictionary.

Thanks,

Toth means slovakian, and the -th is pronounced as if the h wasn't there (not like the english th). some other nationalities that sometimes appear as surnames: Horvath (croatian), Legyel (polish), Nemeth (german).

The h on the end is an anachronism, often used in a surname, but not when used as an adjective using modern hungarian spelling.

TO'T is the collective name for a group of nationalities. The Slovaks,

Slovenians, the Chroatians (Slavonians) etc. It is an old-old Hungarian name for

these ethnic groups. Proof of how old, may be found in the fact that it

became a frequent Hungarian surname, mostly with the old Hungarian spelling: TOTH,

and may also be found among the names of localities, like To'tfalu,

To'tkomlo's, Lengyelto'ti etc.

It has been a non-derogative, friendly, non-official way to refer to those

of such background living in Hungary as minorities.

Hope, this will help...

Toth or tot's meaning is Slovak, if I am correct in Maria Theresias time many Slovaks were settled in the neighbourhood of Bekescsaba, there are also settlements, villages whose name includes the word tot, like Totkomlos. According some Jewis sources Bekescsaba was also called Tatcsaba, which might come >from the word Tot.

To't means slovak. To'th is used as a last name, but means the same.
