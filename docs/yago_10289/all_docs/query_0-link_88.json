        "text": "Now, the beta synchrotron...\n\nsends the electrons\n\nthrough this magnet...\n\nwhich bends the force of them\n\ndown to the reaction vessel.\n\nStay away\n\nfrom that elbow joint.\n\nAll right.\n\nBran, you want to get that?\n\nNow, this is\n\na tunable excimer laser.\n\nIt's tuned\n\nto the exact resonance...\n\nof the plutonium-239...\n\nthat's in the reaction vessel\n\ndown at that end.\n\nNow I think we're all set.\n\nHit it.\n\nNow, watch your eyes.\n\nRoper!\n\nThis is where the electrons\n\nbombard the stuff...\n\nlasers ionize it, and\n\nsend it off to the condenser.\n\nNow it's a conductive element.\n\nDown to the condenser.\n\nThis is where it gets converted\n\ninto its liquid metallic state.\n\nWould you repeat that, please?\n\nThis is where it's converted...\n\ninto its liquid metallic state!\n\nThis all happened\n\nabout fifty seconds ago.\n\nIt's the purest plutonium\n\nin the universe.\n\nPretty, isn't it?\n\n- Ninety-nine percent?\n\n- No.\n\nHave some\n\nof that French bubbly.\n\nAll right! You popped it.\n\nHere we go.\n\nBob, what do you think?\n\nA weapon this big...\n\nwith twenty times the punch\n\nof anything anybody's got?\n\n- Is he kidding?\n\n- No. He did it, all right.\n\nIt's a brilliant achievement.\n\nHe'd get the Nobel\n\nif he could publish.\n\n- Publish?\n\n- I said \"If. \"\n\nAll right, I want\n\na prototype facility...\n\nfully operational\n\nbefore Geneva, if possible.\n\nEverything goes through Energy\n\nin Washington.\n\nNeed to know, S.C.I. Clearance.\n\nSet him up,\n\nwhatever he needs...\n\nsomeplace quiet,\n\naway from prying eyes...\n\nand keep an eye on him.\n\nLet's see about a Swiss bank\n\nto put all this money in.\n\nThere we go.\n\nHi, mom.\n\nPaul, it's 4:\n\n30 in the morning.\n\nWhat's the book?\n\nI don't know... some cheap novel.\n\nCome on. I'll buy you a drink.\n\nBe careful. It's hot.\n\nWhat? What's the matter?\n\nYou're growing so fast.\n\nYeah, but that's no reason\n\nto have a nervous breakdown.\n\nCome here.\n\nWe gotta get you a valium\n\nor some heroin or something.\n\nHurry up. He's coming.\n\n- Hey, what is that?\n\n- Nitrogen triiodide.\n\nWhat's it do?\n\nUnstable with respect to shock.\n\n- What's that mean?\n\n- Once it dries...\n\nif you touch it, it explodes.\n\nPaul, you're crazy.\n\nYou say that\n\nlike it's a bad thing.\n\n- Whose drawer?\n\n- Roland's.\n\nPoor Roland.\n\nEh, he'll love it.\n\nBuilds character.\n\nHe's coming.\n\nHi ya, Roland. Listen, could I\n\nborrow your English notes?\n\nYou've got to be kidding.\n\nBut I lent you my math homework\n\nat least ten times.\n\nSorry, Stephens. It's\n\na dog-eat-dog world out there.\n\nI gotta look out\n\nfor number one.\n\nGood morning,\n\nladies and gentlemen.\n\nLast time, we learned that\n\nplutonium is perfectly suited...\n\nfor the release of\n\nenormous amounts of energy...\n\ndue to its ability to fission...\n\nunder the action\n\nof slow neutrons.\n\nNow here we have the isotope...\n\nplutonium-239...\n\nand here we have two very\n\ninteresting inventions...\n\nbased on this.\n\nNow, can anyone tell us\n\nthe principle...\n\nbehind the implosion device?\n\nPaul, could you enlighten us?\n\nYes. Your implosion design\n\nsimply uses...\n\na chemical high-explosive to\n\nsqueeze a subcritical piece...\n\nof weapons-grade plutonium-239\n\nuntil it's supercritical...\n\nthereby producing\n\nan atomic explosion.\n\n- Thank you, Roland.\n\n- Thank you, Mr. Wilkie.\n\nHe did it! Him!\n\nPaul Stephens! He's sick!\n\n- Hiya, Jen.\n\n- Hi, Paul.\n\n- Did you lose something?\n\n- It's so dumb!\n\nI locked my car keys\n\nin the glove compartment...\n\nbecause I always lose them.\n\nSo now I've lost the keys\n\nto the glove compartment.\n\nDumb, right?\n\nHave you got a nail file\n\nin there?\n\n- Yeah, why?\n\n- Let me see it.\n\n- What are you gonna do?\n\n- Don't worry about it.\n\n- It's a new car.\n\n- Trust me.\n\nThat was terrible, you know.\n\n- What?\n\n- Roland.\n\nTerrible? I thought\n\nit was very effective.\n\nNot bad. Thanks.\n\nWhere did you learn that?\n\nCIA, child recruitment program.\n\nListen, what are you doing\n\nSunday night?\n\n- Nothing. Why?\n\n- You want to study?\n\n- You mean together?\n\n- Uh-huh.\n\n- What about Mr. Perfect?\n\n- Who? Eric?\n\nDon't worry about Eric.\n\nHe's just pretty.\n\n- So what do you say?\n\n- Sure.\n\nMy house, OK? 115 North\n\nHighland near Thurston.\n\nYou gonna write it down?\n\nto baby-sit my little brother.\n\nAh, baby-sitting.\n\nDoes he bite?\n\nNo.\n\nI'm the one that bites.\n\nStephens, how about it?\n\n- Excuse me, doctor?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nHi. I'm Elizabeth Stephens.\n\n- Please have a seat.\n\n- Thanks.\n\nCould you spell this for me,\n\ndoctor?\n\nI can't seem to read\n\nyour writing.\n\nM- a-t-h-e-w-s-o-n.\n\nJohn Mathewson.\n\nAnd you're interested in a one\n\nbedroom sublet, furnished?\n\nAny special requirements?\n\nIt should be quiet and in\n\nan english-speaking country.\n\nI think we can handle that.\n\n- Children?\n\n- No. No children.\n\nPets?\n\nNo pets, no children,\n\nno flamenco dancing.\n\n- So it's just you and...\n\n- Just me and my books.\n\nAnd my memories, of course.\n\nWe have a very nice\n\ngarden condominium on sublet.\n\nNew building,\n\ngood neighborhood...\n\nincluding utilities.\n\n- The particulars are inside.\n\n- No, no, that's OK.\n\n- You don't like it?\n\n- I love it. I'll take it.\n\n- You'll take it?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Just like that?\n\n- Uh-huh.\n\nWithout looking at it?\n\nWell, you said it was nice,\n\ndidn't you?\n\nWell... OK.\n\nThat was easy.\n\nI'm very easy.\n\nWell, I guess that's that.\n\nAnd if there's anything else\n\nI can do...\n\nWell, as a matter of fact,\n\nthere is one thing.\n\nCan I ask you a question?\n\nThe thing is,\n\nI've been here for six weeks...\n\ndown at\n\nthe Carriage House Motel...\n\nand I don't know a soul\n\nin town...\n\nand you've been so nice...\n\nI thought...\n\nperhaps some night\n\nyou'd let me buy you dinner.\n\nIs that crazy?\n\n- I can't, no.\n\n- No?
