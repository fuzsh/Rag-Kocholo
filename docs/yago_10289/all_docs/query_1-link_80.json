        "text": "Producers of the Broadway-bound musical Happy Trails, which is based on the life and career of American icons Roy Rogers and his wife Dale Evans, have announced that T Bone Burnett has joined the creative team to replace the previously announced Alan Menken and Glenn Slater.\n\nBurnett will now be writing the score (music and lyrics) for the musical, which will feature a book by Academy Award-winner Marshall Brickman and direction by two-time Tony Award-winner Des McAnuff. Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyrics) have departed the production due to 'scheduling conflicts'.\n\n\"Roy Rogers was one of the most visible stars of his era, making a significant impact across all media: film, radio, TV, and recordings - even selling over 150 million comic books to multiple generations of avid fans. Between 1945 and 1975, he starred in 88 films, seen by an estimated 80 million people a year. His British fan club boasted over 90,000 members. The top rated \"Roy Rogers TV Show\" aired 100 episodes and his image was featured on over 2.5 billion boxes of Post Cereal.\"\n\nThis new musical will tell his journey from an impoverished childhood in Ohio to an unlikely reign as one of Hollywood's most popular stars.\n\nAdditional creative team members, production details, and casting for all roles will be announced in the coming months.\n\nBurnett is an Academy Award winner, a Golden Globe winner and 13-time Grammy Award winner."
