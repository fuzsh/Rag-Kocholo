        "text": "First time I've seen this in more than 20 years. Just a few thoughts.\n\n- I don't understand how Christopher Collet never really broke through. He had such a solid mid 80s. Sleepaway Camp, Firstborn, The Manhattan Project. Then his next movie is Prayer of the Rollerboys in 1990. On second thought, PotR may have been what did it.\n\n- Lithgow is so good here. Par for the course for him but I love the subtle cues he has going. The strained conscience. The casual nature of his ultra high IQ. His mild social anxiety. The slow fraying of his nerves as the film progresses. He keeps all of these qualities sub-dermal. Great character work.\n\n- Collet and Cynthia Nixon…\n\nA lot of the negative reviews of The Manhattan Project on here focus on a couple of things (1) the unlikability of Paul, the main character, and (2) the dumbness of Paul's plan to build an atomic bomb to draw attention to the secret nuclear bomb development facility in his town.\n\nI think, with respect, that those critiques kind of misread the film. I certainly understand that a blithely over-confident white man who seems unconcerned about the safety of those around him is a harder sell as a lead, watching this in 2021, than it may have been at the time, but I don't think you have to like the lead to enjoy the movie -- I think a large…\n\nGood grief. This may have been a sweet movie in the mid 80's but this really does not hold up very well over the years.\n\nA teen genius gets the great idea to steal plutonium from a government facility and build a nuclear bomb to show off as a science project to basically get back at a doctor who is dating his mother.\n\nThere are a lot of stars in this. John Lithgow, Jill Eikenberry, Cynthia Nixon, Robert Sean Leonard, John Mahoney, and Richard Jenkins cannot make this movie good.\n\nChristopher Collet may be one of the most irritating leads I have every seen in a movie. He had this stupid grin most of the movie, that I wanted someone…"
