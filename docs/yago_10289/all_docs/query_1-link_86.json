        "text": "Entr’Acte Theatrix\n\npresents\n\nThe Addams Family – A New Musical Comedy\n\nOctober 25 – November 4\n\nThey’re creepy… and they’re kooky…and they’re back!\n\nCharles Addams’ weird and wonderful family comes to life in this award-winning musical comedy.\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nContact: Carol Kassie\n\ncarol@carolkassie.com / 561-445-9244\n\nOctober 1, 2018\n\nDELRAY BEACH, FL: Entr’Acte Theatrix audiences are in for a fiendishly delightful treat beginning October 25th when Delray Beach’s Crest Theatre @ Old School Square will host Charles Addams’ wonderfully bizarre cast of characters known as The Addams Family – just in time for Halloween! The award-winning musical will run through November 4th.\n\nCharles Addams’ ghoulishly clever and devilishly satirical Addams Family cartoons first began appearing in the New Yorker magazine in 1938, and his characters captured the hearts and the humor of the American public almost immediately. A close knit, loving family, with a few odd quirks – and a definite affinity for the bizarre and macabre – the Addams Family has appeared in a number of film and television adaptations since their debut, however The Addams Family – A New Musical Comedy is based on Addams’ cartoons, rather than any of the characters as they were portrayed in film or on television.\n\nAddams Family patrons are being encouraged to come dressed in Halloween costumes, and several appropriately garbed audience members will be invited to join the cast on stage during the last scene of the show!\n\nJeremy Quinn, who directed Entr’Acte’s most recent production of The Rocky Horror show will helm the production:\n\n“The Addams Family has been around for a little over 80 years, whether in cartoon form, on television, in film or on Broadway,” he says. “This family has endured the test of time because they are, above all else, a family. Even though they have a zombie for a butler, a cousin covered in hair, and a dismembered hand in a box named “Thing”, they are actually quite relatable. If we look closely enough at our own families…we’ve got at least one “Addams” somewhere along the line!\n\n“But we love the Addams Family because they embrace their strangeness, which we should all do, within the most “normal” of circumstances,” he continues. “There’s nothing “wrong” here…just different. Let’s be real – unique authenticity is an increasingly valued trait. With 7.7 billion people on Earth, a little diversity provides an abundance of beautiful color!\n\n“I am inspired by the book writer’s quote,” he says: “The unknown may be frightening, the darkness overwhelming, but if we don’t run from it, we may see our mysterious, miraculous lives finally illuminated. If we move toward the darkness, we might find love and acceptance. For when it is dark enough, we can see the stars.” – Rick Elice, book writer for The Addams Family.”\n\nEntr’Acte’s Addams Family members include Ashley Gravlin as Morticia Addams, Carlo Sabusap as Gomez Addams, Mary Grace Tesoriero as Wednesday Addams, Greg Halmos as Pugsley Addams, John Costanzo as Fester Addams, Rosseroni Parris as Grandma Addams, Gustavo Garcia as Lurch, Robyn Eli Brenner as Lucas Beineke, Nicole Stav as Alice Beineke, and Mark Kirschenbaum as Malcolm Beineke. Also cast – as Addams Ancestors – are Irma Gloria, Emma Sue Harris, Nysia Matos, Mackenzie Anderson, Elana Vital, Jonathan Thoresen, Ben Shaevitz, Andy Morejon, and Trevohnn Garner.\n\nEntr’Acte Theatrix’ The Addams Family – A New Musical Comedy will run from October 25 – November 4 at The Crest Theatre @ Old School Square in Delray Beach. Tickets are $45 (premium seating) or $35 (regular seating). Student and group rates are also available. Tickets are on sale now and can be purchased at the Crest Theatre box office at 561-243-7922 or on line at www.entractetheatrix.com. The Crest Theatre @ Old School Square is located at 51 North Swinton Avenue in Delray Beach (33444).\n\nFor more information about Entr’Acte Theatrix contact Carol Kassie at 561-445-9244 / carol@carolkassie.com.\n\n~\n\nThe Addams Family – A New Musical Comedy\n\nBook by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice Music and Lyrics by Andrew Lippa Based on Characters Created by Charles Addams\n\nOctober 25 – November 4\n\nFor tickets: 561-243-7922 / www.entractetheatrix.com\n\nPerformances:\n\nThursday, October 25th at 8 PM\n\nFriday, October 26th at 8 PM\n\nSaturday, October 27th at 2 PM and 8 PM\n\nSunday, October 28th at 2 PM and 7 PM\n\nWednesday, October 31st at 8 PM\n\nThursday, November 1st at 8 PM\n\nFriday, November 2nd at 8 PM\n\nSaturday, November 3rd at 2 PM and 8 PM\n\nSunday, November 4th at 2 PM\n\nAll performances at\n\nThe Crest Theatre @ Old School Square\n\n51 North Swinton Avenue\n\nDelray Beach, FL 33444\n\nhttp://oldschoolsquare.org/about/crest-theatre/\n\nwww.entractetheatrix.com\n\nLike Us on Facebook!\n\n“Gomez and Pugsley are enthusiastic. Morticia is even in disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly. Grandma Frump is foolishly good-natured. Wednesday is her mother’s daughter. A closely knit family, the real head being Morticia—although each of the others is a definite character—except for Grandma, who is easily led. Many of the troubles they have as a family are due to Grandma’s fumbling, weak character. The house is a wreck, of course, but this is a house-proud family just the same and every trap door is in good repair. Money is no problem…” Charles Addams\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript."
