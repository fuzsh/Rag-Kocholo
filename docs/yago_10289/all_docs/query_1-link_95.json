        "text": "Do you know what a state Annie Hall was in when it first emerged from the editing room? Maybe you've heard that its original title was Anhedonia – referring to Alvy Singer's inability to experience pleasure – but it wasn't just a title. That was the film Allen shot: a Fellini-esque stream of consciousness, honeycombed with flashbacks to Alvy's Coney Island childhood, featuring a murder mystery, a Nazi interrogation dream, an elevator trip to hell and a basketball game between a team of philosophers and the New York Knicks.\n\n\"Terrible. Completely unsalvageable,\" Allen's co-writer, Marshall Brickman, said of the film they saw as a rough cut in late 1976. Only one thing worked: the subplot involving Alvy's romance with Annie Hall. \"I didn't sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're going to write a picture about a relationship',\" Allen later said. \"I mean, the whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nNew Statesman"
