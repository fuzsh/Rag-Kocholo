        "text": "The 80s. When anything could happen and we accepted it because, well, it was the 80s. And one interesting movie that I managed to rediscover from the 80s that I really enjoyed was The Manhattan Project, a neat little thriller revolving around — wait for it — a kid making his own nuclear bomb.\n\nNot just any kid, mind you. He’s Paul Stephens (Christopher Collet), a genius that soon discovers that his mother is dating Dr. John Mathewson (John Lithgow, in a terrific role), who actually works for a “medical company” in his town.\n\nOnly it’s not — it’s a research facility with plutonium. So, with the help of his reporter girlfriend Jenny (Cynthia Nixon), Paul plans to steal some plutonium and expose the company.\n\nBut the plutonium isn’t enough, so Paul decides to go next level to show the world the dangers of the lab and creates a device around the plutonium, hoping to wow everyone at a local science fair.\n\nIt isn’t long before the situation escalates (and shampoo somehow ends up in the place of, I dunno, nuclear stuff?), and a race begins to retrieve the bomb.\n\nOf course, this could be absolutely tense as hell, but co-writer and director Marshall Brickman pulls off a nice trick. He keeps things moving at a rapid pace while allowing some humanity to seep in, complete with humorous moments. For instance, a scene involving fooling a guard with a remote control vehicle has a lot of charm.\n\nAnd it’s great because we get to see Paul and John build a bit of a friendship — even over plutonium, of course. We see that John isn’t the bad guy that Paul originally thinks he is, and Paul is really not the threat that John’s colleagues (namely Lieutenant Colonel Conroy, played with gusto by John Mahoney) make him out to be.\n\nWhat follows is a fun little movie that offers some great moments, including a finale where the nuclear device in question actually does something no one expects, forcing everyone to get on the same page. I won’t say what happens, but it’s a lot more fun than expected.\n\nThe acting is great across the board, particularly Collet, Nixon and Jill Eikenberry as Paul’s mom. But Mahoney puts on a show as the Colonel that isn’t afraid to take out a kid for the sake of national security. And, of course, Lithgow is a class act, with one of the best lines being a favorite: “Fellow sons of bitches.”\n\nWarGames it isn’t, mainly because it does high stakes a little differently than John Badham’s classic. But The Manhattan Project reminds us that good escapism can go a long way, especially when told in such a heartwarming — but still tense — fashion. It’s not every day that a film about a handmade nuclear bomb can melt our hearts.\n\nWait, now that I think about it…\n\nTwo quick notes. First off, I’d love to have a group of friends like the “science nerds” that we see at the fair. Also, keep a close eye out for Richard Jenkins. He shows up as a “radiation controls officer.” I guess that type of job exists.\n\nHave a great week and thanks for reading, as always!"
