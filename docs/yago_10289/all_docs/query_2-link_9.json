        "text": "The Manhattan Project is a 1986 American science fiction\\thriller film directed by Marshall Brickman.\n\nThe film was released on June 13, 1986 by 20th Century Fox.\n\nPlot[]\n\nWhen gifted high school student Paul Stephens (Christopher Collet) decides to construct an atomic bomb with stolen plutonium for a national science school, he exposes a nuclear weapons lab that is posing as nuclear medicine in Ithaca, New York.\n\nCast[]\n\nChristopher Collet as Paul Stephens\n\nJohn Lithgow as John Mathewson\n\nJohn Mahoney as Lt. Col. Conroy\n\nJill Eikenberry as Elizabeth Stephens\n\nCynthia Nixon as Jenny Anderman\n\nRobert Leonard as Max\n\nProduction[]\n\nAfter making the 1983 film, \"Lovesick\", Marshall Brickman was interested in doing something other than comedy. He said: \"Jokes are easy. Humor comes to me so easily I'm suspicious of it. I secrete jokes like the pancreas secretes. . .whatever the pancreas secretes. I wanted character, I wanted to go for the emotions that the kid feels, that the scientist feels; I wanted the audience to feel the seductiveness of machinery.\"\n\nBrickman chose to make \"The Manhattan Project\"; however, he decided against doing something historical because \"it's such a monster to do, the scope is so enormous - I couldn't come up with a viable way to make it that wouldn't cost under $60 million to produce.\"\n\nBrickman decided to do something in a contemporary setting which dealt with the same themes. According to him: \"I became fascinated with the two worlds that coexist in America now. The one world of ordinary citizens, like the kid in the movie who has all the concommitant problems of adolescence - sex and girls and school . . . and then the other world, which is the world of the military–industrial complex, and within that world the sort of high-priesthood of nuclear-weapons planners and designers. . . . You read through the books and these guys are really creepy: scary and fascinating, and very brilliant and very elitist and very condescending to the rest of the world. And very divorced from any sense of consequence, from any sense of ethics or morality.\"\n\nHe also thought that \"it might be a good idea to approach the bomb as another consumer item, which in a sense it is. You know, it provides a lot of jobs, a lot of work, and ironically a lot of good side-effects.\"\n\nBrickman later said that he was inspired by an article he read in Scientific American on laser separation of trans-Uranic elements. He developed the structure with a collaborator Thomas Baum.\n\nThe film's plot was likely influenced by the case of John Aristotle Phillips, a Princeton University undergraduate, who came to prominence in 1977 as the \"A-Bomb Kid\" for designing a nuclear weapon in a term paper using publicly available books and articles. Brickman said, \"I was afraid people would say I ripped off the subject, that I trivialized it, that I took a less serious view – that I just used the subject to get some laughs.\"\n\nMarshall Brickman was inspired by meeting a former atomic scientist who made windmills and greenhouses. He asked the scientist why he did, and he said: \"Well, you're sitting in your office and if it works, then you're creating temperatures and pressures that existed only during the creation of the universe. For a millionth of a second, you get to play God. And you can't just walk away from that.\"\n\nBrickman says he \"wanted to show that the kid, just like the scientists, is seduced by the technology. It's like a form of chicken: How close can I come to the edge here? I wanted to show how you could get embroiled without any regard to consequences. Which is what happened to the guys involved in the original Manhattan Project. They became hooked; they were just too far into it.\"\n\nJohn Lithgow said that the film was \"a change of pace\" for him and that it \"appealed to me, and the subject matter was intriguing, too. It's a cut above the teenage science movies that have been filling the theaters this summer.\"\n\nThe budget (which was $13 million) was provided by Thorn-EMI Screen Entertainment. The rest of the budget consisted of consultancy fees for Gladden.\n\nShooting[]\n\nPrincipal photography for \"The Manhattan Project\" began on July 10, 1985 and ended on October 4, 1985.\n\nIt was filmed in and around New York City, including Rockland County, the village of Suffern (including Suffern High School) and the INCO, Ltd. Research and Development Center in the hamlet of Sterling Forest.\n\nThe producers held an actual science fair at the New York Penta Hotel, paying $75 each to actual students from the tri-state area who \"participated in the science fair and contributed their own individually created projects.\"\n\nThe nuclear sets and effects were designed collaboratively by the production designer Philip Rosenberg, and Bran Ferren who is credited with the special effects.\n\nFerren used literally tons of technical gear purchased surplus from Los Alamos National Laboratories, and performed most of the visual effects work, including robotics, live on set.\n\nBrickman said: \"As I start to develop as a director, I wanted to do projects that were inherently more cinematic. Where the freight was not so much in the dialogue, where it would be carried more by the camera. I have long sequences in this film that are nearly diaolgue-less . . . and it's a subject I wanted to do. It's different than anything else I've done, and I like that. A lot more moving camera, a lot more attention to a certain type of style, more active and less parochial, in a way, than films I've done in the past.\"\n\nBox Office[]\n\n\"The Manhattan Project\" was a box office bomb, grossing $1,503,545 during its opening weekend.\n\nOverall, it grossed $3,900,000 domestically and worldwide, recovering just 21% of its $18,000,000 budget. Some people attributed the film's poor performance to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster (which occurred around the same time).\n\nHowever, Marshall Brickman downplayed this, saying: \"When Chernobyl happened, other people said to me, 'God, what great timing,' as if I had some kind of foresight to do the film. But when you think about it, something's always popping up about nuclear weapons or reactors every couple of months. I don't think it matters. If the film works, it works.\"\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\n\"The Manhattan Project\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 50% based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 5.50\\10.\n\nChicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert gave it a rating of four out of four stars and called it \"a clever, funny and very skillful thriller that stays as close as possible to the everyday lives of convincing people, so that the movie's frightening aspects are convincing.\"\n\nWriting for the Chicago Tribune, Dave Kehr called \"The Manhattan Project\" a \"solid, credible action film\" which contains a \"welcome pacifistic message.\"\n\nVariety called the film a \"warm, comedy-laced doomsday story\", adding: \"Using clever one-liners and many humorous situations, [Marshall] Brickman manages successfully to sugarcoat the story’s serious message.\"\n\nWriting for The Los Angeles Times, Michael Wilmington said: \"There are some premises that absolutely aren't going to work--no matter how much intelligence, talent or craft the film makers bring to them. And Marshall Brickman may have stumbled onto such a premise in The Manhattan Project.\"\n\nVincent Canby from The New York Times said the film's \"vaguely populist leanings\" wasn't \"crazy enough\", and said that Marshall Brickman failed to \"make big issues comprehensible. He just makes them small.\""
