        "text": "THE FILM:\n\nThe Manhattan Project was an enormous undertaking that required the efforts of many of the world’s most brilliant intellectuals. Hundreds of physicists, mathematicians, and engineers were needed to design, build, and test the world’s first atomic weapon and the United States government did everything in its power to lure these individuals to the Manhattan Project. One of those assigned to the project was my uncle John Edmund Gray, a University of Rhode Island graduate with a brilliant mind. Hundreds of men were assigned by the government of the United States to lend their minds to producing the first Atomic bombs, but the majority had no idea at the time what their skills were being utilized for since the project was beyond the level of “top secret”. Narrated by Tim Gray.\n\nCLASSROOM RESOURCES:\n\nEach of our documentary films has a corresponding quiz or essay question for use in the classroom by teachers and educators.\n\nWe encourage you to choose one of the PDFs below that is the best match for your students. It’s up to each educator if you would like to offer either the exam or the one-question essay. An answer sheet corresponds with each quiz. Our goal is not to overwhelm students with dates, treaties, and strategy. Instead, we would rather focus their attention on the individual stories of the subjects of our documentaries. We find these visual stories to be inspiring, impactful, and educational.\n\nWe hope that after viewing one of our films, students will want to learn more about the personal stories of World War II generation. Maybe they do this by reading a book, watching another documentary, or perhaps a full-length film. Maybe our films will inspire your students to ask an older family member about their role, or inquire about another relative’s story, in World War II.\n\nWe recommend the below curriculum for grades 7-12 and college."
