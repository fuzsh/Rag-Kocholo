As part of the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos — both its very existence and the work that went on there — was kept from Americans during World War II.\n\nMany of the thousands of scientists on the project were not officially aware of what they were working on. Though they were not permitted to talk to anyone about their work, including each other, by 1945 some had figured out that they were in fact building an atomic bomb."
