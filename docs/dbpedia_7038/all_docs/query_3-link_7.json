        "text": "BATON ROUGE — The East Baton Rouge Parish School Board selected Metro Council member LaMont Cole as its next superintendent on Wednesday, its unanimous vote providing a surprising finale to a tumultuous six-month search for a new leader.\n\nThe decision ended a particularly harrowing stretch in which the district saw previous superintendent finalists back away — two of them after interviewing with board members and the public.\n\n\"It's been a dark place around here the last couple of weeks,\" board member Cliff Lewis said ahead of the vote.\n\n\"In order to unite the city and get back to the work of focusing on kids, it is better for me to withdraw and for us to rally around the board and staff to choose the Superintendent,\" Narcisse said in an email. \"I look forward to seeing our city and children succeeding.\"\n\nSmith also asked to not be considered in the final round.\n\nEast Baton Rouge Parish school leaders began Wednesday hoping the day would include their final sprint in the effort to name a new superintendent after a months-long marathon failed to produce any results.\n\nCole entered the race Tuesday, telling WBRZ he hadn't applied previously because Smith, his friend, was in the running. Smith fell out of favor with the board after being named a semifinalist, and Cole opted to hop in.\n\n\"I'm going to apply for this job because it's the right time at the right place,\" Cole said.\n\nThe board previously had a list of 17 candidates that it whittled to three finalists, but each of those dropped out. Smith's second temporary stint ended Tuesday, a week after four school board members issued a letter criticizing his tenure.\n\nThe initial list of candidates to qualify ahead of the noon deadline on Wednesday included:\n\n- Fabby Williams\n\n- Corwin Robinson\n\n- James Finney\n\n- Verna Ruffin\n\n- Sito Narcisse\n\n- Donald Green\n\n- James Kador\n\n- LaMont Cole\n\n- Rochelle Washington-Scott\n\n- Sean Thorpe\n\n- Robin Harris\n\nWilliams, Robinson, Finney and Ruffin were among 17 candidates who submitted a previous application for the position, though none were among the board set of five semifinalists selected June 18.\n\nFinalist Krish Mohip, a longtime Chicago educator who turned around the Youngstown, Ohio, school district, withdrew on July 6.\n\nLSU Lab School Director Kevin George withdrew next, days after School Board President Carla Powell Lewis suggested that he \"run the hell away from here\" during a tumultuous meeting.\n\nAndrea Zayas, the former chief academic officer of the Boston schools, withdrew after failing to pick up any votes from board members. As she exited, she said that the possibility of success was \"near non-existent.\""
