        "text": "Although he sounded very British, Leo McKern was an Australian. By the time he was 15 years old, he had endured an accident that left him without his left eye. A glass eye replaced it - one might conjecture for the better, as far as making McKern a one-day actor of singular focus (no pun intended; his face had that extremely focused look). He failed to complete Sydney Technical High School, though his interest in engineering prompted him to transfer into the role of engineering apprentice (1935 to 1937). He expanded his horizons in a different direction with a two-year stint (1937-1940) at a commercial art college. By then World War II was escalating toward Australia, and he volunteered for service with the Engineering Corp of the Australian Army (1940 to 1942). But yet one more career move was needed, and that while the war moved northward away from Australia when America joined the fight. He studied acting and debuted on stage in 1944. He also met an Australian stage actress (Jane Holland), and mutual attraction took its course. In 1946 she had acting opportunities in England, and McKern decided that, along with the wish to propose to her, his own future as an actor lay there also.\n\nMcKern was short and stout with a great bulbous nose upon an impish face--all the ingredients for great character. His voice was a sharp and vociferous grind upon the back teeth--also perfect for character. After some touring (which included a trip to post-war Germany), he began to appear with regularity on London's premiere stages, particularly the Old Vic (1949-52 and then again 1962-63). These roles meshed with classic English work when he moved on to the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at Stratford-upon-Avon and the Shakespeare Memorial Theater (later reconstituted as the now Royal Shakespeare Theater) from 1952 to 1954. He also spent a season at the New Nottingham Playhouse. He had weaned himself off his Australian accent long before this with his bid for film roles, the first being as one of the four murderous barons in the Thomas a' Becket story Murder in the Cathedral (1951). And he kept his medieval tights on for his next screen appearances (though the small screen of TV) in some roles for the popular Richard Greene series The Adventures of Robin Hood in 1955, while he continued stage work.\n\nFrom then on, McKern had roles in two to three movies a year--busy but not too busy--gradually mixing progressively more and more TV work in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The films were as varied as a good stage actor could justify moving into a popular medium. Though he was usually police officials, doctors, and authoritative figures, he always made these early parts stand out. Drama comes in various packages; he was not averse to the rise of sci-fi as a vehicle for it. He graced two British sci-fi classics: XX unbekannt (1956) and the better Der Tag, an dem die Erde Feuer fing (1961). And there was also TV fantasy work, one of the best known examples being multiple outings as interrogator and chain-yanker Number Two in The Prisoner series. In the late '70s, he condescended to add some weight to two of the Omen movies, as did Gregory Peck and William Holden, putting him in good company. Great drama was McKern's meat. And doing some historically significant on a great scale was an opportunity for a Shakespearean not to miss. He was cast in the screen version of the Robert Bolt hit play Ein Mann zu jeder Jahreszeit (1966). And his visage was perhaps part of the allure. Cast as ruthless political climber and fated chancellor of England Thomas Cromwell, McKern looked like the Hans Holbein court painting of the man who rather nefariously succeeded to Sir Thomas More's position. More was played by McKern's fellow RSC resident Paul Scofield. McKern gave flesh to the commoner Cromwell, making him loud and abrasive with a delightful verve. Later he and Scofield shared another film role, in the sense that the latter turned down the part of Thomas Ryan in the David Lean epic of Ireland Ryans Tochter (1970), while McKern accepted it and made the role work. (Scofield would have been a miscast, something he probably wisely foresaw.)\n\nMcKern, from his early screen roles, could do comedy. He had a fair share of outrageous characters, and he could play them with a glint in his eye and a bit of extra cheek in his performance to show that he must have had fun in the role. In this regard, he showed his stuff supporting Peter Sellers in the endearing Die Maus, die brüllte (1959) and had the lead in the outlandish Eine schreckliche Entdeckung (1964) as a college professor who decides to snuff out humanity with poison laughing gas. He was a broad country fellow with a Shakespearean twist as Squint in Die amourösen Abenteuer der Moll Flanders (1965). In one of his later comedies, he is rather overlooked because of its clever script; in fact, it is an over-the-top tour de force for McKern. As the infamous nemesis Professor Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes cleverer Bruder (1975), McKern manages to steal the show from funny man and director/writer Gene Wilder along with Marty Feldman and Roy Kinnear. McKern's Moriarty is devilish but tongue-in-cheek with a vengeance, especially with his nervous tic of suddenly, at any time and out of nowhere, yelling, \"YAAA, YAAA!\"\n\nYet McKern's chief legacy has been and probably will continue to be his long-running TV role in more mystery (he had done his fair share in film and TV already) as Horace Rumpole in \"Rumpole of the Bailey\" (1978-1992), a role originally introduced by him in the teleplay \"Rumpole of the Bailey\" in 1975. The role had been specifically created for him by writer John Mortimer, and though every actor can appreciate the security of a long-running role, McKern feared that it was subsuming his more than considerable body of work. Along with that, McKern became increasingly self-conscious of his acting, and mixed in was the idea that his physical appearance was not appealing to the public. As a result, he had to deal with a progressively increasing stage fright. He need not have worried; he was working in diverse TV and movie roles nearly to the time of his passing, and he was beloved by movie and TV fans alike. Along with receiving the award of Officer of the Order of Australia from his home country, in 1983 McKern's memoir \"Just Resting\" was published.\n\nJohn Farnham is regarded as Australia's top performing artist, with a career spanning three decades. Born in Essex, England, John immigrated to Australia in 1959 at the age of 10. Since his debut in 1967 he has had numerous successes as a solo performer. His solo album Whispering Jack (1986) continues to be Australia biggest selling album of all time by a local artist, with sales in excess of 1.4 million, and for which Farnham was awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award by the Australian Record Industry Association. In addition to local success, Whispering Jack and the single You're the Voice were chart-topping hits throughout Europe, England and Canada. The multi-award winning singer was named Australian of the Year in 1988. In 1989, Farnham was invited to launch the Greenpeace's 'Rainbow Warriors' album in Moscow. In 1992, he recorded the role of Jesus for the Australian cast of Jesus Christ Superstar - The Album then toured with the stage production. In the same year, he was awarded the coveted Australian Music Awards' Crystal Trophy for Outstanding Contribution to the Industry, On Australia Day 1996, he was honoured with the Order of Australia for Services to Music and Charity. Farnham has undertaken numerous local and international tours throughout his career, including a national Australian tour with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra amongst his achievements. His Australian tours are renowned for breaking attendance records, specifically the Chain Reaction Tour in 1990 during which there were eight sell-out performances at Melbourne Park. His 1996 Jack of Hearts\n\nLive in the Round Australian tour, a $5 million production, was\n\nbroadcast live on national television and simulcast on national radio concurrently. Since Whispering Jack, Farnham has released Age of Reason, Chain Reaction, Full House, Then Again and Romeo's Heart, all of which have an impressive list of credits with respect to awards and record sales. In late 1997, the Anthology series was released: Anthology 1 (3 times Platinum), Anthology 2 (Platinum) and Anthology 3 (Gold). In the same year, Farnham was recognised as the Most Broadcast Australian Recording Artist by the Phonographic Performance Company of Australia. In 1998, John toured Australia with Olivia Newton-John and Anthony Warlow in 'The Main Event', accompanied by The John Farnham Band and a 40 piece orchestra, a phenomenal production which sold close to 300,000 tickets in a limited season. The album, \"Highlights from The Main Event\" reached Quad Platinum status within four weeks of release. The \"I Can't Believe He's 50\" tour followed in 1999, in celebration of John's 50th birthday."
