        "text": "SEATTLE (AP) — Tarik Skubal allowed two runs over seven innings, Parker Meadows made a homer-saving catch in the eighth inning and the Detroit Tigers beat the Seattle Mariners 6-2 on Wednesday night.\n\n“It was a huge play, a game-changer,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “When the ball is hit to center, I feel settled because you feel like Parker is going to make (the catch).”\n\nSkubal (13-4) was overpowering in stretches. The 27-year-old left-hander allowed three hits, struck out nine and continued to strengthen his resume in the AL Cy Young Award conversation.\n\nBut Meadows' catch will be the lasting image of the game as Seattle fell out of first place in the AL West, slipping a half-game behind Houston.\n\nWith two outs in the bottom of the eighth and Seattle trailing 3-2, Cal Raleigh drove Jason Foley’s slider to deep center field. Meadows tracked the ball, timed his jump perfectly and was well above the top of the wall when the ball dropped into his glove.\n\n“My job was to get to the wall and get to a spot, look up and find it,” Meadows said. “In that situation, it is pretty cool. You saw the emotions; I don’t do that very often.”\n\nRaleigh homered in the fourth inning, with Randy Arozarena aboard, for the only blemish on Skubal’s otherwise terrific outing.\n\nSkubal, who pitched collegiately a couple of miles away at Seattle University, retired the first 10 batters he faced and moved into a tie with three other pitchers for the most wins in baseball.\n\n“It is always fun for me to throw here,” Skubal said. “I (have) to try and not make the game bigger than it already is. I enjoy it.”\n\nWenceel Pérez led off the game with a home run and Jake Rogers added a solo shot in the fourth inning. Matt Vierling and Gio Urshela had RBI singles in the ninth inning as the Tigers scored three times on the heels of Meadows' catch.\n\nSeattle's George Kirby labored to get through five innings, throwing 97 pitches, 65 for strikes. Kirby (8-8) struck out seven and gave up three runs.\n\n“It is one of those games where you got to keep it close,” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “We did everything right, they just made a play. It happens in the major leagues every once in a while. (Meadows) made an outstanding play.”\n\nTRAINER’S ROOM\n\nTigers: RHP Casey Mize (hamstring) will throw a couple innings in a rehab start with Triple-A Toledo on Thursday, and his pitch efficiency will be monitored, according to Hinch. … OF Riley Greene (hamstring) is still not running bases and Hinch said a rehab assignment is “not imminent.” … OF Kerry Carpenter (lumbar spine stress fracture) went 1 for 4 in his rehab start with Triple-A Toledo, and Hinch said he came out “fine” from the game.\n\nMariners: OF Julio Rodriguez was doing outfield work with the rest of the team on Wednesday. Servais declined comment on the subject until he spoke with the trainer.\n\nROSTER MOVE\n\nMariners: Seattle recalled INF Ryan Bliss from Triple-A Tacoma on Wednesday. Bliss returns to the Mariners after hitting .220 with seven RBIs in 31 games. In a corresponding move, OF Cade Marlowe was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeattle will throw RHP Bryan Woo (5-1, 2.08 ERA) in the series finale against Detroit on Thursday. The Tigers have not made a decision on Thursday’s starter.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nDetroit Tigers starting pitcher Tarik Skubal throws against the Seattle Mariners during the first inning in a baseball game, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Seattle.

(AP Photo/John Froschauer)\n\nAUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Damian McKenzie scored a try among 17 points as New Zealand rebounded from last weekend’s shock first test loss to beat Argentina 42-10 in the second Rugby Championship match on Saturday, extending its unbeaten record at Eden Park to 50 tests over 30 years.\n\nMcKenzie scored the first of the All Blacks’ six tries and had a hand or foot in several others. He kicked superbly out of the hand and off the tee, and converted all six tries often from wide angles.\n\nNew Zealand had scored five tries by halftime, when it led 35-3, and there was no coming back for the Pumas who beat the All Blacks for only the third time last weekend and have never won back-to-back.\n\nWinger Will Jordan returned to the All Blacks’ starting lineup for his first test since last year’s World Cup and scored a try in each half, his 32nd and 33rd in 33 tests.\n\n“A great performance from the boys tonight,” Jordan said. “We wanted to start fast and start strong and we did that, then held on at the end there.”\n\nBeauden Barrett scored his 44th test try to move up to equal fifth on New Zealand’s all-time try-scoring list and other tries went to Ardie Savea and winger Caleb Clarke.\n\nIf there was any disappointment, it was that New Zealand didn’t score for the last 38 minutes while conceding a try to Pumas fullback Juan Cruz Mallia in a 7-7 second half.\n\nThe All Blacks were outplayed physically and tactically in last weekend’s 38-30 defeat in Wellington. But on Saturday a passionate performance of the haka heralded a much more intense and physical effort from the All Blacks who were almost constantly in possession.\n\nArgentina was continually on the retreat which left the visitors scrambling in defense and made it impossible to implement a kicking game which was needed in wet conditions.\n\nSavea was outstanding for the All Blacks, scoring a try and having a hand in several others. Scrumhalf T.J. Perenara improved enormously over his diffident first test performance and Jordie Barrett had his best game of the season at inside center.\n\n“We’re very happy to get the win and respond the way we did,” Savea said. “We spent the whole week looking at ourselves in the mirror. But we’re All Blacks, we’ve got to bring that every week. We can’t rely on a loss to get that response.”\n\nThe Pumas just couldn’t control possession and dominate physically and in the air as they did last weekend. Their hopes of becoming the first team to beat the All Blacks in Auckland since France in 1994 faded well before halftime.\n\n“I think we weren’t good enough this week. We have to try to be consistent week in and week out,” Pumas captain Julian Montoya said.\n\nThe All Blacks spent more time in the Argentina half in the first 20 minutes on Saturday than in all of the first test.\n\nThe All Blacks’ scrum was a massive platform whereas last week 60 minutes elapsed before the first scrum of the match. Tamaiti Williamson, coming in as a loosehead replacement for Ethan de Groot, was a powerhouse, lifting up and driving back his opposite at scrum after scrum.\n\nNew Zealand always seemed to be going forward in the first half and when it kicked, it did so with precision and purpose, learning from its haphazard and ineffective kicking scheme in the first test.\n\nMcKenzie opened New Zealand’s scoring in the seventh minute, running onto a well-weighted kick by Jordie Barrett into the in-goal area.\n\nSantiago Carreras kicked a penalty for Argentina but from then on the first half belonged to New Zealand, though it played into a swirling wind and driven rain. The All Blacks’ handling was superb in the conditions and they grassed only one ball in the first half.\n\nSavea scored next, then Clark who crossed unchallenged after Savea provided the last pass. Jordan was next, also scoring untouched after Perenara had darted to the blindside and passed to the winger with the defense outflanked.\n\nBeauden Barrett squeezed between defenders off a McKenzie pass for the fifth All Blacks try four minutes from halftime.\n\nJordan had his second try in the 42nd minute. After a huge scrum he and Savea featured on the right side, then on the left side as he crashed over and managed to ground the ball amid defenders.\n\nThe All Blacks played some exceptional precision rugby and Argentina’s first concerted period in possession came around the 50th minute when they were over the New Zealand line but lost the ball forward.\n\nThen in the 71st Argentina carried the ball from its own 22 to the All Blacks’ goalline and Mallia scored.\n\nAP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby\n\nNew Zealand's Caleb Clarke, right, scores a try in front of Argentina's Julian Montoya during their rugby test match at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand, on Saturday, Aug. 17, 2024.
