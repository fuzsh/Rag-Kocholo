        "text": "Governors serve the people of their state. And the people should have some say in their selection.\n\nIn a little over a year, Australia has lost a governor-general and a governor of Tasmania. The resignations by Peter Hollingworth and Richard Butler occurred in undignified and controversial circumstances that damaged them and their offices. Although their situations differ, together they reveal problems with the positions of governor-general and governor.\n\nButler was always an unusual choice. An outspoken figure with strong republican views, he was an awkward fit as one of the Queen's vice-regal representatives. Yet it seems he has not committed any act for which he should be dismissed. Instead, he deserves credit for resigning now that it has become clear his position is untenable and his tenure not the hoped-for success.\n\nThe basic problem with the office of governor is that it has outgrown its original purpose. It is no longer occupied by people sent from the United Kingdom to keep an eye on the colonies. Instead, governors have come to play an increasingly important role in Australian community and cultural life. Despite this, the office remains governed by unwritten conventions from a different era that contain vague and uncertain powers and provide no link to the people. It is, instead, left to each governor to forge such a connection.\n\nGovernors now serve the people of their state, and the people should have some say in their selection. We are beyond the days of Government House being the domain of retired judges and military officers. While they can make excellent governors, so too can other community leaders. Being in favour of an Australia republic should also not be a disqualification. After all, polls regularly show that this is a majority view in the Australian population.\n\nThe first priority should be public discussion about the appointment process. It can be changed without a referendum. This leaves considerable scope for imagination. New approaches could include parliamentary appointment or even direct election.\n\nIn the short term, I favour more modest change. The selection of the next governor of Tasmania or of any other state should begin with people having the chance put forward nominations. Names should be sought from across the community as part of a debate about who should hold the job. These names should be vetted and reduced to a shortlist of three to five by a committee of community leaders, politicians and a former governor. The premier, in consultation with other political leaders, should then select one of these people for appointment.\n\nThis would improve the present system yet leave the final decision with the premier. It would also give people a voice in the selection of their governor for the first time, and provide the new governor with a measure of popular legitimacy and support that could bolster them in their role.\n\nThe lack of criteria for the dismissal of a governor also needs to be fixed. One option would be to adopt the position that exists for High Court judges. They can be removed by the Federal Parliament for \"proved misbehaviour or incapacity\". The present situation in which a governor can be dismissed at the whim of a premier without reasons being given to the people or any form of open process is unfair and inconsistent with the rules that govern other public offices.\n\nThe resignation of the governor of Tasmania provides an opportunity to reassess the position of the state governors. These 19th-century offices needed to be reformed for 21st-century Australia. The place to start is with how the governors are chosen. Reform might lead, in the longer term, to an Australian republic, or simply to a more effective constitutional monarchy."
