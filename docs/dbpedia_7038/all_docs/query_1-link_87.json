        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — There was a bigger prize hanging over Terence Crawford’s WBA super welterweight title fight against Israil Madrimov.\n\nCrawford was trying to retain his crown as the consensus best pound-for-pound boxer in the world, remain undefeated, and become a four-division champion, all of which he accomplished with the unanimous decision win on Saturday.\n\nAll that paled in comparison to the prospect of a super fight against Canelo Álvarez, one that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Crawford and further elevate his standing in the sport.\n\n“Canelo, we are ready to (fight in) February,” said Turki Alalshikh, the Saudi Arabian politician and financier who was behind the Crawford-Madrimov card. “Crawford ready. Accept.”\n\nThe financial muscle to make the fight happen is in place, but Crawford (41-0, 31 KOs) wasn’t reconsidering the sporting merit after a closer than expected result over Madrimov.\n\nCrawford had stopped the opponent in 11 straight bouts, but that streak ended in his first fight at 154 pounds. Madrimov was able to handle and equal Crawford’s power, leading to a canny tactical contest.\n\nHaving to move up in weight again to face the larger Álvarez, who will defend his super middleweight title against Edgar Berlanga on Sept. 14 in Las Vegas, could be a step too far.\n\nEddie Hearn, the promoter who represents Madrimov and previously worked with Álvarez, described potentially facing Álvarez at 168 pounds as a “huge jump” for Crawford.\n\nMadrimov agreed the size disparity might be too much for Crawford to overcome.\n\n“It depends on what weight they fight in, but if they’re going to be fighting in Canelo’s current weight category, I think it will be very difficult for Crawford,” Madrimov said through his manager, Vadim Kornilov.\n\nBrian McIntyre, Crawford’s trainer, said his fighter would need to highlight athleticism in a showdown with Álvarez.\n\n“Get them legs in some shape, man, ’cause got to move. … You’re gonna have to have side to side movement with Canelo,” McIntyre said.\n\nThose concerns might be what makes the matchup enticing to Crawford. The Omaha, Nebraska, native has long bristled at conventional logic in the fight game, seemingly to his detriment early on in his career.\n\nNow, at 36 years old, Crawford is in position to be the centerpiece of the sport. That could come against Álvarez, but Alalshikh is also championing Crawford and undefeated Vergil Ortiz Jr. at 154 pounds as an equally intriguing fight should Álvarez decline.\n\nMcIntyre mentioned a possible matchup against Sebastian Fundora, who holds the WBC and WBO super welterweight belts.\n\n“Y’all know Terence is almost done, so he’s making proof of his legacy,” McIntyre said when asked about Crawford’s next opponent.\n\nAnd for a pugilist who spent most of his career being overshadowed in the mainstream by the likes of Álvarez, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, the structure of the event at BMO Stadium, which included a pre-fight concert by rapper Eminem, was seemingly designed to establish Crawford at that level.\n\nHearn believes some of that stardust rubbed off on Madrimov, a 29-year-old from Uzbekistan, during his spirited performance.\n\n“We still would have preferred the win, but the stock of Israil Madrimov has risen around the world, and the future is very bright,” Hearn said.\n\nFor Crawford, his next steps are seemingly dependent on Álvarez’s upcoming bout and subsequent decision.\n\nHaving done his part, Crawford exalted in the moment.\n\n“We here now,” Crawford said. “Everything happened for a reason. The cream always rise to the top, you know, and if you look around, I’m the last man standing, and I’m the one they was talking so bad about.”\n\nAP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing\n\nTerence Crawford, top, throws a punch at Israil Madrimov during a super welterweight championship boxing match in Los Angeles, Saturday, Aug. 3, 2024.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Hurricane Ernesto made landfall on the tiny British Atlantic territory of Bermuda early Saturday as residents hunkered down.\n\nThe wide category 1 storm was directly over the the wealthy territory at 6 a.m. Saturday, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph). The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned of strong winds, a dangerous storm surge and significant coastal flooding.\n\nIt said some 6 to 9 inches (150-225 millimeters) of rain was expected to fall on Bermuda. “This rainfall will likely result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding, especially in low-lying areas on the island,” it said.\n\nDue to the large size of the storm and its slow movement, hurricane-strength winds are expected to continue until Saturday afternoon, with tropical storm-strength winds continuing well into Sunday, the Bermuda government said. Ernesto is moving toward the north-northeast at around 9 mph (15 kph).\n\nThe NHC reported life-threatening surf and rip currents on the east coast of the United States and said they would reach Canada during the course of the day. Ernesto is forecast to be near or east of Newfoundland by Monday night.\n\nBermuda power utility BELCO said that as of late Friday, power was out to 31% of its customers. It described itself as being in “an active state of crisis.”\n\n“Our crews are no longer out in the field working as it is no longer safe for them. They will now rest until it is deemed safe for them to begin restoration efforts,” BELCO added.\n\nIn preparation for the storm, officials in the wealthy British territory had suspended public transportation and closed the airport on Friday night.\n\n“Hurricane Ernesto seriously threatens our community,” National Security Minister Michael Weeks said. “This is not a storm to be taken lightly.”\n\nBermuda is an archipelago of 181 tiny islands whose total land mass is roughly the size of Manhattan.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, it’s uncommon for the eye of a hurricane to make landfall in Bermuda. It noted that, before today, since 1850 only 11 of 130 tropical storms that came within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of Bermuda had landfall.\n\nThe island is a renowned offshore financial center with sturdy construction, and given its elevation, storm surge is not as problematic as it is with low-lying islands.\n\nErnesto previously battered the northeast Caribbean, where it left hundreds of thousands of people without power or water in Puerto Rico after swiping past the U.S. territory as a tropical storm.\n\nMore than 180,000 out of nearly 1.5 million clients were still without power more than two days after the storm. Another 170,000 were without water as the National Weather Service issued yet another severe heat advisory, warning of “dangerously hot and humid conditions.”\n\n“It’s not easy,” said Andrés Cabrera, 60, who lives in the north coastal city of Carolina and had no water or power.\n\nLike many on the island, he could not afford a generator or solar panels. Cabrera said he was relying for relief only “on the wind that comes in from the street.”\n\nOfficials said they hoped to restore power to 90% of nearly 1.5 million customers in Puerto Rico by Sunday, but have not said when they expect power to be fully restored.\n\nOf 152 locations of critical infrastructure without electricity that are being prioritized, 36 now have power, said Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, a private company that operates the transmission and distribution of power on the island.\n\nIn the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands, crews also were working to restore power, with 80% of customers back online.\n\nErnesto is the fifth named storm and the third hurricane of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms, with four to seven major hurricanes.\n\n——\n\nThis story has been corrected to give the conversion of rainfall as millimeters instead of centimeters.\n\nThis GOES-16 GeoColor satellite image taken at 4:40 p.m EDT and provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows Hurricane Ernesto in the Atlantic Ocean south-southwest of Bermuda, Friday, Aug. 16, 2024.
