        "text": "Some credit card providers charge very large commissions upon transactions; some as much as 3%. We consider this to be too high and therefore do not accept some cards, including American Express and some variations of Master Card and Visa including those suffixed with ‘Corporate’, ‘Business’ or ‘World’. Normal Master Card and Visa should be fine. Transactions attempted with the higher charging credit cards will be declined by our Sagepay Account. If this should prove to be the case, we hope you understand that we cannot afford to lose 3% on a transaction charge, especially on in memorium donations where we pass on 100% of your donation to the charity and we pay the commission to the credit card companies.\n\nIf you have ticked the box titled ‘Gift Aid?’ then you confirm that you are a UK Income or Capital Gains taxpayer. That you have read this statement and want the named charity or Community Amateur Sports Club (CASC) to reclaim tax on the donation detailed on this form, given today. That you understand that You must pay an amount of Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax in the tax year at least equal to the amount of tax that all the charities and CASCs you donate to, will reclaim on your gifts for that tax year. That you understand that other taxes such as VAT and Council Tax do not qualify. That you understand the charity will reclaim 25p of tax on every £1 that you have given.\n\nPlease notify us or the charity or CASC if you:\n\nWant to cancel this declaration\n\nChange your name or home address\n\nNo longer pay sufficient tax on your income and/or capital gains.\n\nIf you pay Income Tax at the higher or additional rate and want to receive the additional tax relief due to you, you must include all your Gift Aid donations on your Self Assessment tax return or ask HM Revenue and Customs to adjust your tax code."
