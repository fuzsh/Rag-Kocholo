least eight years in prison for a series of sexual assaults on very young girls.\n\nThe case demonstrates once again that for years, the Anglican Church appeared willing to turn a blind eye to complaints about its clergy or teachers, and to protect those involved.\n\nEven more disturbingly, our story tonight raises questions about how well the church is dealing with the problem even today.\n\nSixty-four-year-old Robert Ellmore was first convicted of sexual assault on a minor when he was a 20-year-old in Queensland.\n\nIt's now clear he continued to offend with impunity for decades, becoming in the meantime an ordained Anglican priest in NSW.\n\nEven after being convicted, unlicensed, and convicted again in the 90s, he was still able to pose as a priest, to win the trust of an unsuspecting family, and molest their eight-year-old daughter only last year.\n\nTo abide by the strict laws protecting under-age victims of crime, we've had to conceal the identities of parents and grandparents in tonight's disturbing report by Nick Grimm.\n\nREBECCA, MOTHER OF ABUSED CHILD: He used his clerical collar to gain access to our child, to sexually assault her.\n\nHe has hidden behind that collar, the church has protected him.\n\nI am speaking out on behalf of not only my child, but other children.\n\nIf I had not had the experience of unprofessionalism, ineptitude, lack of compassion, from the Anglican church, I would probably not be speaking to you.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Rebecca, not her real name, is a woman barely able to contain her anger with the church to which she's belonged all her life.\n\nLast year, her eight-year-old daughter was sexually molested by a man she believed was a respectable Anglican priest.\n\nShe didn't know he was also a serial paedophile.\n\nREBECCA, MOTHER OF ABUSED CHILD: The Anglican church in Australia does not have its house in order on this issue and they have acknowledged that to me and the general public would be staggered, as I have been, if they knew how vulnerable their children are in the care of the Anglican church.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Robert Ellmore has well and truly earned his place in history.\n\nThe convicted child sex offender is Australia's first Anglican clergyman to be defrocked, stripped of his holy office, in living memory.\n\nBut rather than applauding the move, the families of his victims ask why did it take so long for the church to act despite evidence of decades of serial paedophile activity?\n\nJIM, GRANDFATHER OF ABUSED CHILD:I say there's cover-up all along the line.\n\nI can't think of any other word that I could possibly use there.\n\nNICK GRIMM: After years spent driving to see Robert Ellmore pay for his sins, Jim, also not his real name, is relieved to see the former priest behind bars.\n\nTen years ago Ellmore molested his five-year-old grand-daughter.\n\nWhat made the breach of trust difficult was that Robert Ellmore was a close relative.\n\nHere the men are pictured with their wives on Ellmore's wedding day around 30 years ago.\n\nJIM: We spent a lot of time socially with each other because there's not a great deal of difference in our ages.\n\nWe played quite a lot together and I was treating him as my younger brother up until 10 years ago.\n\nNICK GRIMM: But the warning signs had been apparent since well before Ellmore was ordained as a priest, even in the 1950s when paedophilia was a subject rarely discussed and even more rarely linked to the church.\n\nThat was when 20-year-old Robert Ellmore was first convicted and jailed for the aggravated assault of a 10-year-old girl.\n\nJIM: I had heard of a previous conviction that he had as a 20-year-old young man in Toowoomba, I more or less put this out of my head because in the in between period, I mean, he had grown up as a man.\n\nHe had got married.\n\nHe joined the ministry.\n\nAnd I thought all this is behind him.\n\nNICK GRIMM: But it wasn't behind him, was it?\n\nJIM: Evidently not.\n\nBecause since that, we've found that that he had another conviction in the 1960s -- a similar conviction.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Ten years after his first conviction, Ellmore was arrested in a Sydney park and charged with indecent exposure.\n\nBut when he later decided on a career as a clergyman, it appears Robert Ellmore simply lied about his criminal record.\n\nPHILIP GERBER, PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS UNIT, ANGLICAN CHURCH: He didn't disclose those, certainly not to the Sydney diocese when we licensed him.\n\nIt was a matter of disclosure.\n\nThere was not the processes in place for us to do police checks in Queensland.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Philip Gerber heads the Professional Standards Unit in the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church.\n\nIt's an indication of how big a problem the church currently faces with inappropriate sexual behaviour by the clergy that Mr Gerber admits the Professional Standards Unit is little more than a euphemism for the church's anti-paedophilia office.\n\nPHILIP GERBER: Professional standards in this context means child protection.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Was he always an inappropriate choice to become a priest?\n\nPHILIP GERBER: Well, in hindsight that's true, because the matter that he was convicted for in 1999, he committed that while he was a theological student in theological college up in Newcastle.\n\nNICK GRIMM: It was 1976 when Ellmore sexually assaulted two sisters aged six and eight.\n\nThe same year he also molested a seven-year-old in the vestry of Bathurst's All Saints Cathedral.\n\nLater, in 1978, he was ordained as a priest.\n\nThen, around three years later, he offended again with a girl aged around nine after confirmation classes in his parish residence.\n\nYet, another incident involved a girl visiting his home.\n\nIt would be years before these offences came to light.\n\nBut in 1992, when he molested his five-year-old cousin, Jim's grand-daughter, her family acted immediately to have Ellmore charged and convicted.\n\nThat prompted other victims to come forward.\n\nJIM: People say to me, 'Well, has she been affected by this?'\n\nAnd all I can say is, 'Who knows?'\n\nSome of these women that he has now been convicted of offences against when they were younger, well, it must have affected their lives greatly for them to come forward in their late 20s, early 30s to take further action against the man.\n\nNICK GRIMM: What angers the families of Ellmore's victims is the fact that there appears to be a number of complaints made against the priest as he moved from parish to parish within the Bathurst diocese during the 1980s.\n\nJIM: They must have known the reasons why they were moving him around so much.\n\nNICK GRIMM: The families of some of his victims feel that the church must have known something about what he was doing?\n\nWhat do you say to that allegation?\n\nPHILIP GERBER: That's probably not unfair in terms of what happened in other diocese.\n\nI don't know all the facts but that would probably not be an unreasonable supposition.\n\nNICK GRIMM: When Robert Ellmore left the Bathurst diocese, he was given a glowing reference by the then bishop Howell Wit who's now dead.\n\nIt stated: 'He is a priest in good standing in the diocese of Bathurst.\n\nI would certainly do my utmost to find an opening for him if he returned'.\n\nIt's now believed Ellmore had been ordered to seek psychiatric help after a series of complaints about him from parishioners.\n\nToday, members of the Bathurst diocese declined to be interviewed about Robert Ellmore but did provide the 7:30 Report with this statement: 'It's impossible to know what was in the bishop's mind in 1995.\n\nToday's church is ashamed that an Anglican priest working in western NSW parishes in the '70s and '80s could abuse children.\n\nToday, the diocese would immediately suspend any church member following a complaint of this nature'.\n\nFor its part, the Sydney diocese insists that back in the early '90s, it removed Robert Ellmore's licence to practice as a priest as soon as they learned he had been convicted of assaulting Jim's grand-daughter.\n\nJIM: As soon as we found out that he had been convicted his licence was taken off him, and in theory that meant he could no longer practice as a priest.\n\nNICK GRIMM: But no-one told that to Rebecca.\n\nIn 1999, Ellmore was charged again, this time for offences committed back in the '70s.\n\nHe served a year in jail but on his release he was able to persuade Rebecca that he was still a fully fledged clergyman.\n\nREBECCA: Through his developing a personal and spiritual relationship with our family, he was able to gain our trust and groom my husband and I so that he had access to the children.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Was he presenting himself as a Anglican priest when he did that?\n\nREBECCA: Yes.\n\nNICK GRIMM: One weekend last April while staying at Rebecca's home, Ellmore molested her eight-year-old daughter.\n\nRebecca believes the Anglican church should have done more to sever its links with Ellmore.\n\nThe Anglican church readily admits making mistakes in the past but claims it's now doing better.\n\nNot so claims Rebecca.\n\nREBECCA: When I went to them as a parishioner in need, not a person off the street, I was met with silence, lack of interest and uncaring, uncompassionate attitude, which has been most disturbing.\n\nSome appalling statements have been made to me.\n\nNICK GRIMM: What kind of statements?\n\nREBECCA: In conversation with a senior representative of the church, he said to me that he had met the perpetrator's wife and he couldn't understand how Ellmore had done what he'd done because he'd met her, she was a pretty good sort.\n\nShe wasn't ugly or overweight, couldn't understand how he did it.\n\nMy reply to him was, 'She's not eight'.\n\nHe said to me, 'I'll pray for you'.\n\nAnd I said, 'Thank you'.\n\nHe then said, 'I'll probably forget but I'll get my wife to do it, she's pretty good at that sort of thing'.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Those comments were made by the head of the Sydney diocese Professional Standards Unit, Philip Gerber.\n\nPHILIP GERBER: I would personally accept responsibility for being clumsy.\n\nOne often says things that you regret saying in retrospect.\n\nBut I don't think that reflects the way the churches are dealing with things.\n\nI think that reflects a personal clumsiness on my part.\n\nNICK GRIMM: Today, Robert Ellmore was sentenced to a minimum eight years in jail for offences against Rebecca's daughter and two other girls.\n\nREBECCA: Yes.\n\nIt's not simply a matter of how they weed out paedophiles within their ranks, it's also a case of how they compassionately handle victims' families when they come forward.\n\nNICK GRIMM: The judge said he only wished the law allowed him to impose a heavier punishment to adequately reflect the community's abhorrence with his crimes.\n\nHas this shaken your religious faith?\n\nREBECCA: It has definitely not shaken my faith in God.\n\nI am so disappointed in the institution of the church.\n\nAs I know God is.\n\n0 Replies\n\nWilso\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nCatholic Church in Australia embroiled in child sex scandal\n\nAssociated Press/May 31, 2002\n\nBy Emma Tinkler\n\nSydney, Australia -- The Catholic Church in Australia was embroiled in a child sex scandal Friday after its most senior clergyman denied offering bribes to cover up abuse allegations against a priest.\n\nThe bribery allegation came amid a crisis that has shaken the church in the United States, with revelations that priests across the country abused children sexually and that senior clergy tried to conceal incidents by moving known offenders to other parishes.\n\nSydney Catholic Archbishop George Pell told a news conference Thursday that a television news program to be aired this weekend alleges that he tried to cover up sex abuse claims made against a priest in 1993 by offering the victim financial assistance in return for his silence.\n\nHe denied the charge and said that he was misled by the producers of the program - the Nine Network's \"60 Minutes\" - about the reason for the interview.\n\n\"The allegations that I made such attempts or offers are not only unfounded but also implausible,\" he said.\n\nPell said that he had agreed to be interviewed \"to discuss matters arising out of the American cardinals meeting in Rome,\" referring to an extraordinary gathering at the Vatican last month between Pope John Paul II and American cardinals and bishops to discuss matters including the U.S. child abuse allegations.\n\nAccording to the archbishop, a segment of the \"60 Minutes\" program to be broadcast Sunday reports that he was told in 1993 of abuse by a priest who pleaded guilty a year later to sexually assaulting 21 children - mostly altar boys and including his nephew - in one of Australia's most notorious pedophile scandals. The program says that the case was brought to Pell's attention by the nephew.\n\nPell told reporters that he had been contacted by the priest's nephew about the abuse but said that their phone conversation took place after the priest, Gerald Ridsdale, had already been charged with child sex offenses. Ridsdale pleaded guilty in 1994 to 46 sexual assault charges and was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison.\n\nHe also denied an allegation by the program that he asked the priest's nephew, David Ridsdale, what it would take \"to keep you quiet\" and went on to offer him a car or house.\n\n\"I had no authority to respond to any allegations against Ridsdale,\" said Pell, who was a bishop in the eastern city of Melbourne at the time.\n\nThe church leader said that he was seeking advice about whether to take legal action against the program's producers.\n\nJohn Westacott, executive producer of \"60 Minutes,\" said that he had fully briefed Pell of the allegations before the interview.\n\n\"I'm not here to prosecute the Catholic Church; we've got the story of ... people that were treated, have been treated, are being treated extremely badly,\" Westacott told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Friday. \"It seems to me that the politics and legal requirements have been put well and truly above common decency.\"\n\n0 Replies\n\nWilso\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nPriest sentenced to five years' jail\n\nA retired Catholic priest has been sentenced to five years' imprisonment in Dunedin after admitting 10 representative charges arising from sexual assaults on four boys between 1962 and 1972.\n\nMagnus William Murray, 76, now lives in Auckland.\n\nThe offences were committed when Murray was acting in various roles for the Catholic Church in and around Dunedin.\n\nThe judge at the sentencing at the High Court in Dunedin heard the defence counsel and Murray's sister-in-law plead for leniency. But the judge said he had to balance any mitigating factors against the age and number of boys involved, and the gross abuse of trust.\n\nThe Catholic Church says it has no plans compensate four boys sexually assaulted by the Dunedin priest, despite knowing that abuse was taking place.\n\nSpokesperson Lyndsay Freer says although the church knew the abuse had happened, appropriate action was taken at the time and Murray was sent to Australia for counselling.\n\nFreer says to her knowledge no compensation has been sought by the victims.\n\n0 Replies\n\nWilso\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nThis is the 20 year guy my above post referred to.\n\nEx-priest jailed for child sex crimes\n\nJailed paedophile and former Catholic priest Michael Charles Glennon will spend at least 15 more years behind bars.\n\nCounty Court judge Roland Williams set the minimum sentence for a string of fresh sex offences against Glennon.\n\nJudge Williams sentenced the 59-year-old to a maximum of 18 years on 26 counts against four young victims.\n\nBut the judge said the new maximum sentence from Wednesday would in fact become 20 years, with two years added on from the sentence he is currently serving.\n\nGlennon has spent most of the past 13 years in jail.\n\nThe former priest has been convicted of sexually abusing 15 children between 1974 and 1991, mostly at youth camps held at Karaglen, a rural property near Lancefield north of Melbourne, which Glennon helped establish and operate.\n\nThe most recent trial heard that Glennon told his boy victims that the sexual offences were secret men's business and a necessary part of their initiation into Aboriginal manhood.\n\nJudge Williams said he believed that Glennon was one of a small number of offenders who were \"just wantonly evil\".\n\nHe had shown himself to be an \"evil, callous human being\", a man of cunning and planning who committed the most sordid crimes against his victims.\n\n0 Replies\n\nWilso\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nC A N A D A\n\nBishop Hubert O'Connor of Prince George, British Columbia, was sentenced on Sept. 13, 1996, to 2 1/2 years in prison for sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a boarding school in central British Colombia while he was principal there in the 1960s.\n\nArchbishop Alphonsus Penney of St. John's, Newfoundland, resigned on February 2, 1991, after a church commission criticized him for failing to prevent extensive abuse of boys living in Newfoundland orphanages.\n\nW A L E S\n\nArchbishop John Aloysius Ward of Cardiff, Wales, was forced by the pope to resign on Oct. 26, 2001, after he was accused of ignoring warnings about two priests who were later convicted of child abuse.\n\nP O L A N D\n\nArchbishop Juliusz Paetz of Poznan, a close associate of Pope John Paul II, resigned on March 28, 2002, amid accusations he had made sexual advances on young clerics.

She started getting flashbacks three years ago and became severely depressed. She was referred to a psychiatric day hospital, where the chaplain offered her what she believed was the refuge of a spiritual shoulder to cry on.\n\nBut his support quickly turned into a fresh bout of sexual exploitation, she claims. The clergyman raped her in his office, at home and in the toilet of a cemetery.\n\nAs an eight-year-old, Patricia Stevens dreamt of being ordained as a minister. Fifteen years later, as a postgraduate theology student at Cambridge, she was close to fulfilling that ambition. But when she was sent on work experience to preach at a large church in London, she alleges that she was sexually abused and raped by the senior priest supervising her.\n\nSheila Hennessy used to be a senior school teacher. As a child she was abused by a family friend. When her local priest discovered this, she claims, he zeroed in on her vulnerability and initiated a ritual of sexual abuse that lasted 10 years.\n\nAccording to Sheila, the vicar was turned on by the idea of menstruation and would ask her for her used tampons, and have her open up the school at weekends so he could collect her pupils' tampons from sanitary bins.\n\nUntil this weekend, these women had little in common apart from their beliefs. But a four-month investigation by The Observer reveals they are just three out of dozens who claim they have been sexually abused by churchmen of all denominations.\n\nMany of them, who have told their stories for the first time, remain in a state of deep psychological despair. Several have tried to commit suicide. Yet most of the accused clerics continue to preach after being quietly moved to another parish.\n\nWhile the Church of England remains in turmoil over the sexuality of its bishops, some believe the mounting catalogue of sexual abuse against women is the real untold scandal of the Church. This particular controversy now threatens to envelop the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who faces questions over his role in helping a priest who sexually assaulted a female vicar to find another job.\n\nBritain's leading investigator of sexual abuse in the Church is Margaret Kennedy, a former social worker who was a pioneer in raising the issue of child abuse in the Roman Catholic and other Christian churches. She described the scandal involving Williams as 'shocking and deplorable'.\n\nKennedy believes the sexual abuse of adults by clergymen is just as serious as child abuse. She has catalogued more than 120 cases of alleged sexual abuse of women by clergy. In a damning study, yet to be published, she has collected harrowing testimonies from more than 60 victims - 25 concern the Church of England, 25 the Catholic Church, with the rest spread across Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians.\n\n'My fear is that this is just the tip of an iceberg. We know about these cases because these women have moved on to some extent and been able to talk about it,' said Kennedy. 'I believe there are hundreds more frightened women who are too ashamed to deal with the situation they find themselves in. The church authorities must admit their ministers can use their power to sexually exploit or abuse vulnerable adult women.'\n\nThe evidence reveals a disturbing picture of how vulnerable women have turned to churchmen for pastoral help, only to be preyed upon. Some victims had been abused as children, others were recovering drug addicts and some were grieving for loved ones or had recently been divorced.\n\nMost have been left in a poor mental state, many of them suicidal, while the clergymen are rebuked privately and moved on. Too often their victims are left isolated in communities unable to face the idea that a man of God could do something so wrong.\n\nMany cases show how the clerics use religion and their position of authority to coerce women into sex, saying things like, 'God wants you to love me,' and 'concubines were biblical'. In one instance, it is claimed that a clergyman told a woman: 'God has made you beautiful so you can sexually fulfil Christian men.' In another, it's alleged that a priest said masturbating his victim - who had been abused as a child - was a 'way the holy spirit could enter her to help the healing process'.\n\nAs a student minister, Patricia Stevens firmly believed in not having sex outside marriage. She recalls how the priest told her she would never understand the love of God if she didn't have sex with a man. She alleges that the man, who was married with children, forced her to have sex with him when his wife went to work.\n\n'He told me it was God's will to have sex with me, and when I turned him down, that I wasn't being obedient to God ...He started off trying to kiss me and fondle my breasts ...He told me to stop struggling and then had sexual intercourse with me ...Sometimes I would cry when he wouldn't stop and the more I told him to leave me alone the more he would say it was the right thing to do.\n\n'He would tell me this was our secret and I shouldn't say anything to anyone. This was what God wanted - God would be pleased with me.'\n\nAlthough the alleged abuse happened a number of years ago, Patricia recently attempted suicide several times because she still cannot come to terms with what happened - or get justice from the church authorities. The priest, who denied rape, was asked to move parishes but allowed to go on preaching.\n\nPatricia claims he boasted to her that she was not the only woman in her parish he had had sex with, and that one of his other conquests had committed suicide.\n\nKennedy said: 'Nearly all the priests who abuse women are multiple offenders. One problem is that the abuse is not viewed by the church as sexual offending behaviour, and they are allowed to get away with it. The church hierarchy, which still is very patriarchal, believes them when they say, \"I'm sorry. I won't do it again\". In the US they would treat these priests as sex offenders and send them to treatment centres.'\n\nEven a woman priest can be preyed on. A devastated Dr Tanya Jenkins, the vicar of Llangefni on Anglesey in North Wales, is still off work three years after she was sexually assaulted by Canon Geoffrey Hewitt of Bangor Cathedral.\n\nHewitt 'stuck his tongue down her throat after Jenkins invited him for a coffee at her home after a funeral.\n\nShe reported Hewitt, who had been married for more than 30 years, to the Church in Wales authorities. It emerged that officials had received another complaint from a worker that he had patted her on her bottom and emailed lewd poems to her.\n\nHewitt admitted both counts of sexual harassment at a Church tribunal, but was allowed to keep his job. However his parishioners refused to have him back and he was forced to seek another parish. The Observer has established that Williams, then head of the Church in Wales, became involved.\n\nAs Bishop of Monmouth, Williams had a vacancy in his diocese for a vicar at Rhymney. When Hewitt phoned Williams, who was fully aware of the charges against him, to seek advice about the post, the bishop said he would not stand in his way.\n\nThe local press heard that a clergyman with a history of sexually harassing his colleagues was to be the new vicar. An uproar forced Hewitt to withdraw his application. However, he has since emerged as a vicar in Bristol.\n\nHelen Mary Jones, a Welsh Assembly member and former deputy director of the Equal Opportunities Commission, believes the affair reeks of double standards.\n\n'This priest acted in ways that would have led to him being sacked if he had been a social worker or a teacher, yet he is allowed to continue working as a vicar. Williams has staked his reputation around social justice, but in this case he must answer serious questions about his role.'\n\nThe dog collar should be a symbol of trust and moral rectitude, but for Sonya Brown it now has an opposite effect.\n\nWhen Sonya, who had been abused as a child by her father, began visiting a hospital chaplain for counselling she felt secure. 'The collar gave me a feeling of protection and safety,' she said.\n\nBut, according to her distressing account, at one meeting, 'I was very, very upset and very depressed. He got off his chair and knelt down before me. He offered me his handkerchief, put his arms round me, cuddled me, kissed me, then touched my breasts and put his hands between my legs. I felt confused, disorientated, upset and left the room in tears.'\n\nSonya says she continued to see the chaplain, as she desperately depended on his support. One afternoon, however, she claims he visited her at home and they had sex. Sonya, who was married with children, admits that at first she felt special. A week later, however, she realised she had made a terrible mistake. But, in a state of severe depression, she felt powerless.\n\nIn March 2000, she claims that the chaplain brutally raped her in a toilet at a cemetery where she had gone to visit her sister's grave. 'I was very upset and went to the toilet in a very distressed state. (He) followed me ... In an instant the door was closed and locked.\n\n'My trousers were pulled down and he was touching me. I said, \"No, please get out\". He smiled. He turned me round and pushed me against the door. He put his arm across my neck. He raped me. I couldn't scream or shout. I felt sick and confused. I prayed somebody would come into the toilets - somebody, anybody. Nobody did.'\n\nSonya claims she was then repeatedly raped at her home, but could tell no one.\n\n'He repeatedly told me it was a moving-on process. He told me constantly not to tell anyone, or he could lose his job. He threatened to tell my husband, and most of all that nobody would believe me.\n\n'He kept telling me it was our secret. I was terrified and kept my mouth shut - until the day I felt suicidal and reported the incident to another counsellor.'\n\nThe hospital held an internal investigation and the chaplain's ministry was told. But it was the chaplain's word against Sheila's, and the hospital took his. He still works there and is allowed on home visits to other vulnerable women.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, one of the major problems is that the perpetrator is a male member of the clergy who is seen as above reproach. 'The woman is often seen as the seductress who has tempted the priest into a sexual relationship,' she said.\n\nWhile the tabloid press feasts on tales of randy vicars and sex-starved women pouncing on priests, the truth is much more complex.\n\nSome victims said they believed they had been 'groomed' by a cleric just as a paedophile prepares his victims.\n\nSheila, now a senior magistrate, said, 'I now believe I was targeted from the word go, and he drew me in. And I now know there were at least three others. When he learnt I had been abused as a child he used this to put me in a vulnerable position. He used to come round to my house with his dog collar on and get me talking about abuse, and gave me what he called special hugs which he said would help heal me. This meant putting his hands down my pants. He then used to masturbate. It was ritualistic and he made us pray together.'\n\nSheila felt like a paedophile victim in another way. The Church of England would not take her complaint seriously unless she made it formal, which meant going public.\n\n'I wanted to deal with this informally. They didn't want to help me. That is why I feel terribly betrayed. They wouldn't help me. They seemed more interested in burying the story.'\n\nÂ· The names of the victims have been changed to protect their identities.\n\n0 Replies\n\nWilso\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nCONVICTED CLERGY, OR WHERE OFFENCES OTHERWISE CONFIRMED\n\nA-D\n\nAinsworth, Br Godfrey \"Allen\"(78) Melbourne Franciscan brother, Catholic parish priest and Mercy Hospital chaplain. - In 2000 the Catholic Church agreed to pay sex abuse victim $200,000 compensation after Church Commission into Sexual Abuse accepts as \"substantially correct\" victim's allegations against 3 priests, including Br Godfrey Ainsworth, Fr Francis ELLUL and Br Regis SMITH. Commission hears Ainsworth, of Waverley, Sydney, in 1982 indecently assaulted female victim, aged 34, in Melbourne.
