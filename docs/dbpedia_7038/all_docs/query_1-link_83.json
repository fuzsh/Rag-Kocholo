        "text": "Crawford picked up a fourth title in as many divisions on Saturday night with his win over Madrimov\n\nTerence Crawford went the distance for the first time in nearly a decade, but he got it done on Saturday night.\n\nCrawford beat WBA super welterweight champion Israil Madrimov via unanimous decision in an exciting 12-round battle at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles on Saturday. That officially handed Crawford, who moved up to 154 pounds for the first time in his career, a fourth title in as many divisions.\n\n“He had fast feet, he had good rhythm upstairs and he was strong,” Crawford said of Madrimov in the ring. “He was waiting to counter me just like I was waiting to counter him. … He fought a good fight.”\n\nCrawford, who started his professional career in 2009 at super lightweight, was a heavy favorite entering the bout on Saturday. There was an issue with his gloves earlier in the night, too, as one of them split at the seams. That came only after he initially objected to Madrimov’s Grant Gloves, though he later agreed to wear them. That delayed his warm-up slightly.\n\nThe first several rounds were slow, as both guys seemed to be feeling each other out — though Crawford appeared to hold a slight advantage early as Madrimov hung in there. He even landed a few big shots to his head in the third and sent Crawford down to the mat briefly late in the fifth round, though that was ruled a trip and Crawford seemed relatively unbothered.\n\nCrawford responded with a combo of head shots in the sixth round to take a step ahead again at the midway point. While Madrimov seemed as if he was getting closer in the eighth and ninth rounds — he landed a massive blow to Crawford’s head in the ninth round, which was probably his best of the night — Crawford responded each time successfully. Crawford then came out hot in the final round, and while he couldn’t finish Madrimov, he pulled off the victory.\n\nCrawford won the fight 115-113 on two scorecards and 116-112 on the third to claim the unanimous decision. That pushed him to 41-0, and officially handed Madrimov the first loss of his career.\n\n“He only had 11 fights, but he was strong,\" Crawford said. \"For us to come in and fight a guy of his caliber in my first fight [at 154 pounds] says a lot about my team.”\n\nHere's how the entire pay-per-view main card unfolded:\n\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER94 updates\n\n“If the money is right, we gotta fight,\" Crawford says in his post-fight interview. \"The Canelo fight is another milestone to greatness.”\n\nRESULT: Terence Crawford def. Israil Madrimov by unanimous decision (116-112, 115-113, 115-113)\n\nFight ends\n\nCrawford and Madrimov goes the distance! Tough fight to score.\n\nRound 11 ends\n\nCrawford gets the best of Madrimov and may have had him hurt near the end. Madrimov began clinching and looked a bit wobbly. Last round will be huge.\n\nRound 10 ends\n\nBud's eye is starting to swell . Madrimov still landing the bigger shots.\n\nCrawford-Madrimov main card results, highlights\n\nSuper welterweight: Terence Crawford def.
