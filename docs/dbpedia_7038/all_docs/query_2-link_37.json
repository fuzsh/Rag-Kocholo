        "text": "Prior to submission, please carefully read and follow the submission guidelines detailed below. Manuscripts that do not conform to the submission guidelines may be returned without review.\n\nSubmission\n\nTo submit to the editorial office of Aaron S. Benjamin, please submit manuscripts electronically through the Manuscript Submission Portal in Microsoft Word or Open Office format.\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual).\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nAaron S. Benjamin\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign\n\n827 Psychology Bldg.\n\n603 E. Daniel Street\n\nM/C 716\n\nChampaign, IL 61820\n\nAcceptable formats include: Microsoft Word Document (.doc or .docx) and LaTeX (.tex) with Portable Document Format (.pdf) of the manuscript file.\n\nWhen submitting a manuscript electronically, authors should type their abstract directly into the Abstract text box in the submission form or save their abstract as a text file and copy and paste it from that file. Any special formatting (from a Word document, for example) will be lost when the form is submitted.\n\nThe editorial policy of the journal encompasses integrative articles containing multiple experiments as well as articles reporting single experiments. The journal also publishes commentaries and theoretical notes. Please note that theoretical notes are limited to a maximum of 25 pages of text. Commentaries on articles should be at maximum half the length of the target article.\n\nJEP:LMC is now using a software system to screen submitted content for similarity with other published content. The system compares the initial version of each submitted manuscript against a database of 40+ million scholarly documents, as well as content appearing on the open web. This allows APA to check submissions for potential overlap with material previously published in scholarly journals (e.g., lifted or republished material).\n\nDirect replications\n\nThe journal publishes direct replications. Submissions should include “A Replication of XX Study” in the subtitle of the manuscript as well as in the abstract.\n\nRegistered Reports\n\nJournal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition (JEP:LMC) accepts Registered Reports (RR) as an article type. To learn more about RR, please consult the general guidelines and information at the Center for Open Science and at Peer Community In. We are a PCI-RR-interested journal, which means that articles that pass review at PCI can enter the review process at JEP:LMC.\n\nRegistered Reports at JEP:LMC must meet the usual stringent standards for scientific rigor and validity. In addition, as with any article at JEP:LMC, articles are expected to advance theory about basic cognitive functions.\n\nAccess the flowchart on editorial decision-making about Registered Reports at JEP:LMC. Please download it and consider whether your proposal meets requirements prior to submission.\n\nRegistered Reports submissions can propose novel research or replications of prior work that was published in JEP:LMC or elsewhere.\n\nProposals can include preliminary data. Multi-experiment proposals in which some experiments are completed are others are proposed are often an appealing approach to a complicated question.\n\nPublications may be allowed to include exploratory analyses not included in the proposal. These analyses should be clearly labeled as exploratory and their inclusion will be informed in part by the outcome of Stage 2 peer review.\n\nPower should be high and should allow fair comparison of competing hypotheses. Sample size can take into account the costs of sampling (for example, with hard-to-recruit populations).\n\nThere is no deadline for Stage 2 submission following Stage 1 acceptance, but the authors must accept some risk that scientific findings that arise in the interim may influence Stage 2 review. No Stage 2 paper will be rejected simply because the core result has been published by others in that interim period.\n\nCover letter\n\nYour cover letter must include the following information:\n\nContact information for each author, including valid email address, affiliation, mailing address, as well as phone and fax numbers\n\nA statement that your manuscript is original, not previously published, and not under concurrent consideration elsewhere\n\nIf your cover letter does not contain this information, you will receive a written request from JEP: LMC asking for a revised cover letter.\n\nWhen submitting your manuscript, please include your cover letter in its entirety by copying it to the text box provided in the Manuscript Submission Portal. Unfortunately, the portal cannot currently accept formatted cover letters. Even if you send a formatted version of your letter to the Journal, we must also have a text version of your cover letter.\n\nIf you are submitting a revision, feel free to email a formatted version of your cover letter to the editorial office, though you must still also send a text version of your cover letter through the portal as you're uploading your revision.\n\nManuscript submission acknowledgment\n\nOnce authors have submitted their manuscript through the submission portal, an email acknowledging receipt of the manuscript will be sent to the corresponding author. If this acknowledgment email does not reach the corresponding author within a few days of submitting the manuscript, please contact the editorial office.\n\nAnonymous review\n\nAnonymous review is optional. If an author wants anonymous review, a “Masked” article type must be selected upon submission, and the request should be included in the author's cover letter.\n\nThe manuscript receiving anonymous review should be formatted as follows:\n\nMake sure that the manuscript itself contains no clues to the authors' identity, including grant numbers, names of institutions providing IRB approval, self-citations, and links to online repositories for data, materials, code, or preregistrations (e.g., Create a View-only Link for a Project). All author-identifying information should be removed from the manuscript, including authors' names and affiliations on the title page, footnotes, and author notes. The properties of the file should also not reveal the authors' names.\n\nThe authors' contact information should instead be included in the cover letter, which is not seen by the reviewers.\n\nIf your manuscript was mask reviewed, please ensure that the final version for production includes a byline and full author note for typesetting.\n\nRelated Journals of Experimental Psychology\n\nFor the other JEP journals, authors should submit manuscripts according to the manuscript submission guidelines for each individual JEP journal:\n\nJournal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition\n\nJournal of Experimental Psychology: Applied\n\nJournal of Experimental Psychology: General\n\nJournal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance\n\nWhen one of the editors believes a manuscript is clearly more appropriate for an alternative APA journal, the editor may redirect the manuscript with the approval of the author.\n\nManuscript preparation\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual).\n\nReview APA's Journal Manuscript Preparation Guidelines before submitting your article.\n\nDouble-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the Manual. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the APA Style website.\n\nBelow are additional instructions regarding the preparation of display equations, computer code, and tables.\n\nDisplay equations\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor 3.0 (built into pre-2007 versions of Word) to construct your equations, rather than the equation support that is built into Word 2007 and Word 2010. Equations composed with the built-in Word 2007/Word 2010 equation support are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors.\n\nTo construct your equations with MathType or Equation Editor 3.0:\n\nGo to the Text section of the Insert tab and select Object.\n\nSelect MathType or Equation Editor 3.0 in the drop-down menu.\n\nIf you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.\n\nUse Equation Editor 3.0 or MathType only for equations or for formulas that cannot be produced as Word text using the Times or Symbol font.\n\nComputer code\n\nBecause altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.\n\nIn online supplemental material\n\nWe request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit Supplementing Your Article With Online Material.\n\nIn the text of the article\n\nIf you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.\n\nTables\n\nUse Word's insert table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.\n\nLaTex files\n\nLaTex files (.tex) should be uploaded with all other files such as BibTeX Generated Bibliography File (.bbl) or Bibliography Document (.bib) together in a compressed ZIP file folder for the manuscript submission process. In addition, a Portable Document Format (.pdf) of the manuscript file must be uploaded for the peer-review process.\n\nAcademic writing and English language editing services\n\nAuthors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several vendors that offer discounts to APA authors.\n\nPlease note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.\n\nUse of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.\n\nSubmitting supplemental materials\n\nAPA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the PsycArticles® database. Please see Supplementing Your Article With Online Material for more details.\n\nAuthor contribution statements using CRediT\n\nThe APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) stipulates that “authorship encompasses…not only persons who do the writing but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study.” In the spirit of transparency and openness, Behavioral Neuroscience has adopted the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) to describe each author's individual contributions to the work. CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and detailed description of their diverse contributions to a manuscript.\n\nSubmitting authors will be asked to identify the contributions of all authors at initial submission according to this taxonomy. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the CRediT designations will be published as an Author Contributions Statement in the author note of the final article. All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission.\n\nCRediT includes 14 contributor roles, as described below:\n\nConceptualization: Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\nData curation: Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later reuse.\n\nFormal analysis: Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.\n\nFunding acquisition: Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\nInvestigation: Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.\n\nMethodology: Development or design of methodology; creation of models.\n\nProject administration: Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.\n\nResources: Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.\n\nSoftware: Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\nSupervision: Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.\n\nValidation: Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\nVisualization: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.\n\nWriting—original draft: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).\n\nWriting—review and editing: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision—including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\nAuthors can claim credit for more than one contributor role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author.\n\nAbstract and keywords\n\nAll manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the references section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal article\n\nMcCauley, S.

The standards offer ways to improve transparency in reporting to ensure that readers have the information necessary to evaluate the quality of the research and to facilitate collaboration and replication.\n\nThe JARS:\n\nrecommend the division of hypotheses, analyses, and conclusions into primary, secondary, and exploratory groupings to allow for a full understanding of quantitative analyses presented in a manuscript and to enhance reproducibility;\n\noffer modules for authors reporting on replications, clinical trials, longitudinal studies, and observational studies, as well as the analytic methods of structural equation modeling and Bayesian analysis; and\n\ninclude guidelines on reporting of study preregistration (including making protocols public); participant characteristics (including demographic characteristics); inclusion and exclusion criteria; psychometric characteristics of outcome measures and other variables; and planned data diagnostics and analytic strategy.\n\nThe guidelines focus on transparency in methods reporting, recommending descriptions of how the researcher's own perspective affected the study, as well as the contexts in which the research and analysis took place.\n\nTransparency and openness\n\nEmpirical research, including meta-analyses, submitted to the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition must meet Level 1 (Disclosure) for all eight aspects of research planning and reporting as well as Level 2 (Requirement) for citation; data, materials, and code transparency; and study and analysis plan preregistration. Authors should include a subsection in the method section titled “Transparency and openness.” This subsection should detail the efforts the authors have made to comply with the TOP guidelines.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study, and the study follows JARS (Appelbaum, et al., 2018). All data, analysis code, and research materials are available at [stable link to repository]. Data were analyzed using R, version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020) and the package ggplot, version 3.2.1 (Wickham, 2016). This study’s design and its analysis were not pre-registered.\n\nData, materials, and code\n\nAuthors must state whether data, code, and study materials are posted to a trusted repository and, if so, how to access them, including their location and any limitations on use. If they cannot be made available, authors must state the legal or ethical reasons why they are not available. Trusted repositories adhere to policies that make data discoverable, accessible, usable, and preserved for the long term. Trusted repositories also assign unique and persistent identifiers.. Recommended repositories include APA’s repository on the Open Science Framework (OSF), or authors can access a full list of other recommended repositories.\n\nIn a subsection titled \"Transparency and Openness\" at the end of the method section, specify whether and where the data and material will be available or note the legal or ethical reasons for not doing so. For submissions with quantitative or simulation analytic methods, state whether the study analysis code (e.g., scripts for generating stimuli, conducting simulations, or performing data analyses) is posted to a trusted repository, and, if so, where to access it or the legal or ethical reason why it is not available.\n\nFor example:\n\nAll data have been made publicly available at the [trusted repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nMaterials and analysis code for this study are not available.\n\nThe code behind this analysis/simulation has been made publicly available at the [trusted repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nPreregistration of studies and analysis plans\n\nPreregistration of studies and specific hypotheses can be a useful tool for making strong theoretical claims. Likewise, preregistration of analysis plans can be useful for distinguishing confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Investigators are encouraged to preregister their studies and analysis plans prior to conducting the research via a publicly accessible registry system (e.g., OSF, ClinicalTrials.gov, or other trial registries in the WHO Registry Network).\n\nThere are many available templates; for example, APA, the British Psychological Society, and the German Psychological Society partnered with the Leibniz Institute for Psychology and Center for Open Science to create Preregistration Standards for Quantitative Research in Psychology (Bosnjak et al., 2022).\n\nArticles must state whether or not any work was preregistered and, if so, how to access the preregistration. Preregistrations must be available to reviewers; authors may submit a masked copy via stable link or supplemental material. Links in the method section should be replaced with an identifiable copy on acceptance.\n\nFor example:\n\nThis study’s design was preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study’s design and hypotheses were preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study’s analysis plan was preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study was not preregistered.\n\nOpen science badges\n\nArticles are eligible for open science badges recognizing publicly available data, materials, and/or preregistration plans and analyses. These badges are awarded on a self-disclosure basis.\n\nAt submission, authors must confirm that criteria have been fulfilled in a signed badge disclosure form (PDF, 33KB) that must be submitted as supplemental material. If all criteria are met as confirmed by the editor, the form will then be published with the article as supplemental material.\n\nAuthors should also note their eligibility for the badge(s) in the cover letter.\n\nFor all badges, items must be made available on an open-access repository with a persistent identifier in a format that is time-stamped, immutable, and permanent. For the preregistered badge, this is an institutional registration system.\n\nData and materials must be made available under an open license allowing others to copy, share, and use the data, with attribution and copyright as applicable.\n\nAvailable badges are:\n\nOpen Data:\n\nAll data necessary to reproduce the reported results that are digitally shareable are made publicly available. Information necessary for replication (e.g., codebooks or metadata) must be included.\n\nOpen Data; Protected Access:\n\nA Protected Access (PA) notation may be added to open data badges if sensitive, personal data are available only from an approved third-party repository that manages access to data to qualified researchers through a documented process. To be eligible for an open data badge with such a notation, the repository must publicly describe the steps necessary to obtain the data and detailed data documentation (e.g. variable names and allowed values) must be made available publicly. Manuscripts with data deposited in ICPSR's database are eligible for this badge.\n\nOpen Materials:\n\nAll materials necessary to reproduce the reported results that are digitally shareable, along with descriptions of non-digital materials necessary for replication, are made publicly available.\n\nPreregistered:\n\nAt least one study's design has been preregistered with descriptions of (a) the research design and study materials, including the planned sample size; (b) the motivating research question or hypothesis; (c) the outcome variable(s); and (d) the predictor variables, including controls, covariates, and independent variables. Results must be fully disclosed. As long as they are distinguished from other results in the article, results from analyses that were not preregistered may be reported in the article.\n\nPreregistered+Analysis Plan:\n\nAt least one study's design has been preregistered along with an analysis plan for the research — and results are recorded according to that plan.\n\nNote that it may not be possible to preregister a study or to share data and materials.

This information (2–4 sentences) must be provided as part of the Author Note.\n\nEthical Principles\n\nIt is a violation of APA Ethical Principles to publish \"as original data, data that have been previously published\" (Standard 8.13).\n\nIn addition, APA Ethical Principles specify that \"after research results are published, psychologists do not withhold the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals who seek to verify the substantive claims through reanalysis and who intend to use such data only for that purpose, provided that the confidentiality of the participants can be protected and unless legal rights concerning proprietary data preclude their release\" (Standard 8.14).\n\nAPA expects authors to adhere to these standards. Specifically, APA expects authors to have their data available throughout the editorial review process and for at least 5 years after the date of publication.\n\nAuthors are required to state in writing that they have complied with APA ethical standards in the treatment of their sample, human or animal, or to describe the details of treatment.\n\nDownload Certification of Compliance With APA Ethical Principles Form (PDF, 26KB)\n\nThe APA Ethics Office provides the full Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct electronically on its website in HTML, PDF, and Word format. You may also request a copy by emailing or calling the APA Ethics Office (202-336-5930). You may also read \"Ethical Principles,\" December 1992, American Psychologist, Vol. 47, pp. 1597–1611.\n\nOther information\n\nSee APA’s Publishing Policies page for more information on publication policies, including information on author contributorship and responsibilities of authors, author name changes after publication, the use of generative artificial intelligence, funder information and conflict-of-interest disclosures, duplicate publication, data publication and reuse, and preprints."
