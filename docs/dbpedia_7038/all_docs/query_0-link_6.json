        "text": "Advertisement\n\nThis was published 17 years ago\n\nNeed to be ruthless is as ruthless does to change minds on Hicks\n\nNovember 29, 2006 — 11.00am\n\n, register or subscribe to save articles for later.\n\nSave articles for later\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nWith reference to \"Hicks's window on the world\" (November 28), surely it's time that some unrelenting media pressure was applied to the Howard Government regarding this matter. David Hicks has been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay for almost five years without trial, charge or legal recourse, while being subjected to unconscionable psychological abuse - such is the Howard Government's commitment to justice, human rights and the rule of law.\n\nJohn Howard and Philip Ruddock are undoubtedly impervious to the calls for just and decent treatment for Hicks from the states' attorneys-general, but we know from past performance that they are not impervious to sustained political pressure - for example, reversing the policy on indexation of the excise on petrol, cutting back generous superannuation for MPs, etc.\n\nWhen the Iranians were holding US embassy staff hostage in Tehran in 1979-80, the US media published the ever-increasing number of days they were being held, on a daily basis. It was often the lead item on news bulletins, and undoubtedly contributed to the demise of the Carter administration.\n\nCloser to home, during the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland in 1988-89, one of the corrupt ministers named was the turncoat Don Lane who defected to the Nationals after standing as a Liberal in the 1986 state election. After being named in Fitzgerald's report, Lane stubbornly refused to resign. The Courier-Mail newspaper launched a campaign to help him reconsider. Every day for several months the newspaper carried a prominent piece on page one or three, highlighting the ever-increasing number of days the corrupt Lane was resisting the call to go, and specifying the ever-increasing amount of public money he was drawing from the public purse as he remained in his portfolio. Eventually, the public shaming became too much, even for the rhinoceros-skinned Lane (or more likely because of the political damage he was inflicting on the government).\n\nA similar daily campaign by the media, highlighting the ever-increasing number of days Hicks has been incarcerated without due process, might just bring sufficient political pressure to penetrate even the conscience-free zone which is the Howard Government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Pomerenke Manly West (Qld)\n\nIgnorance is bliss, except the punters aren't buying\n\n\"Zippity do da, zippity-ay,\" goes the chorus of coalition MPs rejoicing with the Cole findings. \"Everything is satisfactual,\" they chirrup, as plenty of sunshine heads their way. One says, predictably, \"let's move on\" and another claims \"everyone does it\".\n\nSome frown, some growl but every last one of them is grinning. Whether the \"single desk\" stays or goes doesn't matter so much as that these selfish representatives of the people should react in this obscene way, while the rest of us, those hoping for a little more illumination, have to contend with lengthening shadows.\n\nKevin J.R. Murphy Bankstown\n\nSo Kim Beazley and Kevin Rudd should \"hang their heads in shame\" after the Cole findings.\n\nSorry, Mark Vaile, have I missed something? Was Labor in power at the time? This appalling scenario happened on your watch, and you and your colleagues are responsible - the most innocent reading of this debacle is that you are profoundly incompetent. At least for once have the guts to take responsibility.\n\nDeborah Clark Chifley (ACT)\n\nAs far as Alexander Downer is concerned, I fully accept his defence that he doesn't know anything. In fact at times it seems that he doesn't even suspect anything.\n\nDavid Grant Ballina\n\nOnce again John \"Houdini\" Howard sneaks across the accountability radar wrapped in his \"I did not know\" shield. While Terence Cole was hamstrung by terms of reference, it defies belief that he could excuse the responsibility of the bureaucracy (and vicariously the Government) by saying that \"the department's officers had nowhere to go\".\n\nWhat about going to the department head? What about the minister? Indeed, what about the Prime Minister, what about the Federal Police? Nowhere to go? Bunkum, it was a choice not to travel a difficult road.\n\nThis is another Howard Government whitewash. The sad thing is that the majority of people just do not care.\n\nGreg Loder Springwood\n\nHow clever our politicians are. Only they can see the difference between the phrases \"guilty of no wrongdoing\" and \"doing the wrong thing\".\n\nIn their eyes, John Howard et al can't be guilty of wrongdoing because they didn't do anything. The scary thing is, they believe that doing nothing was in fact doing the right thing. Amazing.\n\nDorothy Swanton Bowral\n\nGiven its terms of reference, it's hardly surprising John Howard says his Government has been cleared. I suspect the only thing a comprehensive inquiry would clear Howard, Downer and co of is their integrity.\n\nPaul Karlik Springwood\n\nSo the AWB inquiry has done its job and the Prime Minister has decided.\n\nHe is not in charge of a corrupt government that turned a blind eye. He is in charge of a bumbling, incompetent government that hasn't a clue what was going on in such a critical part of the world as Iraq. And he wants my vote?\n\nBernie Howitt Avoca Beach\n\nJudging by the shrill denials of Alexander Downer about what he might have known, one wonders if the Government will ever lay charges against any AWB officials. After all, they know where the bodies are buried and courts don't have any terms of reference.\n\nWalter Bass Turramurra\n\nI have a lazy $10 that says no AWB executive will be charged before the next federal election.\n\nGarry Wong Wanniassa (ACT)\n\nFancy the Howard Government being misled by the AWB. Is this the same Government that wants to supervise a nuclear industry? Heaven help us.\n\nWill Mrongovius Paddington\n\nGood design suffers when the formula says 'no'\n\nB. Bryceson (Letters, November 28) asks why BASIX only allows two north-facing windows in new dwellings.\n\nI will answer this when someone can shed light on why, as an architect, I am constantly held back by the inefficiencies of an ill-conceived but well-meaning panoply of BASIX inconsistencies which reward an array of air-conditioners in combination with these small windows while penalising and excluding good but complex and environmentally sustainable design that is beyond its mathematics-driven formulae. This is to the community's detriment.\n\nMark Gerstl Dover Heights\n\nB. Bryceson, BASIX is probably one of the most misconceived pieces of regulation. Any regulation that requires you to come up with a magic answer is seriously flawed, particularly when you can select items to use that cannot actually be bought, just to get the right answer.\n\nWhat you might find even more absurd is the requirement to fit awnings to south-facing (and I mean perfectly south-facing) windows - to prevent direct sunlight coming in through the windows. Maybe that gives you a clue to the design of BASIX.\n\nIan A. White Blacktown\n\nBound to fail\n\nJoshua Muravchik's piece \"The neocons will ride again\" (November 28) is the most misguided and frightening I have read in a long time.\n\nIf Osama bin Laden talked about wanting to transform the US into an Islamic state, anybody with half a brain would laugh. But when a pointy head from a Washington think tank says that \"the neocon strategy of trying to transform the Middle East, however blemished, remains without alternative\", we in the rest of the world are supposed to take him seriously. The guy should be kicked in the arse until he wakes up.\n\nBen Guthleben Castlecrag\n\nThank heavens \"few neocons have served in the Bush Administration\". If Joshua Muravchik is a good example, the Administration would have been crazier than it is.\n\nConsider this: the solution to terrorism is to change the political culture of the Middle East. (A pretty good idea, even if it does nothing about Pakistan and Indonesia.) Eliminate the Middle Eastern \"habit of conducting politics by means of violence\". (Fair enough - don't leave Israel out of the class, though.)\n\nAnd how do you break the Arabs of this habit of political violence? By invading and violently overthrowing a government.\n\nBill Tarrant Tempe\n\nHow to save lives\n\nLetters and media coverage about deaths of inexperienced drivers still do not mention a very important factor.\n\nDoubtless accidents may be caused by a number of factors, however deaths are often caused by the vehicle running into a tree or pole. Make these frangible or remove them from intersections and curves and many people will walk away after their accidents instead of ending up in the morgue.\n\nDawn Linklater Balmain\n\nIt's not just attitude and a false sense of immortality that leads to young drivers' accidents. It's just as much the poor example set around them on the roads by older, experienced, impatient, selfish and aggressive drivers.\n\nDaniel Flesch Bellingen\n\nThe many young people learning to fly an aeroplane undergo rigorous training, have to pass tough written and practical exams with the emphasis on safety, then when they get their P plates cannot carry passengers until they earn the right to become unrestricted pilots.\n\nThere's a certain pride in achieving that status. Isn't there something here worth applying to car driving?\n\nBruce Webster Kincumber\n\nEveryone breathe in\n\nBillboards have appeared at CityRail stations saying a single eight-carriage train keeps up to 2000 cars off the road.\n\nThis means 250 would-be drivers in each carriage. I counted the seats in my carriage this morning and got 112: 44 upstairs, 44 down and 12 at each end.\n\nIs there really room for 138 standing passengers in each carriage? Why does CityRail think this obvious overcrowding is something to boast about?\n\nJohn Laidler St Peters\n\nPeople come first\n\nDavid Nielson claims \"government housing needs to be used to ensure the weak are protected until they are strong enough to cope with the pressures of life again\" (Letters, November 28).\n\nBut what happens, Mr Nielson, if some of the weak can never become strong enough to cope? Do we chuck them out onto the street? Unfortunately, human beings do not fall into con-venient categories for storage and maintenance purposes.\n\nValerie Brown Jannali\n\nDavid Neilson, you're wrong about public housing being only short term. I've been in public housing for more than 20 years, first as a disability pensioner, now as an age pensioner.\n\nShort of a Lotto win there's nothing short term about my tenancy, especially when private rentals can amount to more than a government pension. Or are you willing to make up the difference? In that case I'll happily vacate my home.\n\nSandy Parkinson Hilton (WA)\n\nNot a bad bloke\n\nPeter Gray for Australian of the Year. Took on the big end of town and won (\"Climate ruling alarms industry\", November 28). A victory for the little people who care.\n\nGraeme Fisher Killara\n\nStranded at the station\n\nThe Federal Government asks that we seniors, \"grey nomads\", spend time helping rural communities. The State Government without warning took away our twice-yearly free rail travel.\n\nColin Bolton Pyrmont\n\nNeighbourhood watch\n\nIt should be no surprise, perhaps, that those in inner-east/city suburbs say they will leave money to charities but do not deliver (\"Charity doesn't begin in poshest suburbs\", November 27).\n\nFallen idols make the latest headlines\n\nRobyn Park (Letters, November 28), who won Australian Idol was old news by the time your letter was published. At the time of writing this, the top two articles in the online version of the Herald concern Naomi Robson's departure from Today Tonight and the demise of Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock's marriage. See? Real issues.\n\nDavid Breeze Dulwich Hill\n\nA forgotten G-G\n\nGerard Henderson's cringeworthy justification of all things Liberal is usually laughable. However his reporting that \"the only governor-general who really made news was Sir John Kerr …\" is breathtaking in its omission of that very newsworthy pedophile apologist, Peter Hollingworth (\"It's a fine job when no one notices the Queen's man\", November 28).\n\nKim Smith Rozelle\n\nCorby profits\n\nWill the publisher and the bookshop owners who sell Schapelle Corby's book (\"Corby may see no cash from book\", November 28) have their profits seized, too, or is it OK for some people to benefit from the proceeds of crime?\n\nNorm Neill Leichhardt\n\nBathurst's first tomatoes\n\nFor those few remaining global warming sceptics, my dad tells me he'll be picking tomatoes in Bathurst before the end of November.\n\nDavid Collett Eglinton\n\nDevelopment rolls on\n\nI owe Ku-ring-gai council an apology. Recently I suggested that the over-development of the Pacific Highway was irresponsible, given the water restrictions and lack of infrastructure. I said \"where once there were a few families now there will be over 100\" (Letters, October 28). I was wrong. The council has approved more than 200, and it hasn't finished yet.\n\nPaul Dolan Sydney\n\nFriendly energy\n\nHas anyone ever heard of a Russian spy being murdered with a wind turbine?\n\nSarah Weate Balgowlah\n\nA gold record\n\nThe other day I caught the 7.56am Newcastle to Sydney train at Morisset, and although passenger numbers in my carriage were small, no one made or received a mobile phone call for the entire journey.\n\nIs this some kind of record? The silence was golden.\n\nJudy Hooworth Morisset\n\nTop of the morning\n\nUnless the health of 702 breakfast announcer Adam Spencer is inclined to vary by the second, let's presume if he tells us once that he is very well, that this is likely to remain so until the end of his shift. This goes for all talkback announcers.\n\nMary Julian Woollahra\n\nGlobalisation glut\n\nI accepted Moire Berman's challenge (Letters, November 28) to find something not made in China. A supermarket tour yielded food canned in Malaysia, Indonesia, Canada, the US, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, England, France and Spain. And so on. And Australia, but not much.\n\nTony Turner Tuross\n\nMost Viewed in National\n\nLoading"
