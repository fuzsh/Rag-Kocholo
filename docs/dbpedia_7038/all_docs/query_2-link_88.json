        "text": "JOURNALIST:\n\nYou seem to be suggesting in your speech that the church has a bit of an image problem (inaudible)\n\nTREASURER:\n\nI think that trust is a really important value particularly when you are dealing with charities and I think that public trust has been shaken a bit by some of the recent events in relation to charities, well known charities. I think it is important that the church address that issue, address it head on, and that it convince the public of its credentials and its ability to change lives. And if the church is able to show that it is still in the business of changing peoples' lives then the public trust and the public confidence will follow. And I think that is the important challenge that lies behind, for all of the charities really, at the current time.\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nHow should they regain that public trust?\n\nTREASURER:\n\nI think it is important that they are careful of the claims that they make. I think it is important that they be efficient with resources. But I think it is also important that they can show those lives that have been changed and helped as a consequence of their work. Charities perform an incredibly valuable role in our society. The Government can't do it all. And when the Government does try to do it all it is cumbersome and it is slow and it is inefficient. And that is where you need the voluntary sector to step up and to fill in the gaps and to respond quickly, and to bring people with strong moral and religious commitment to help those that are in need.\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nGiven the...\n\nTREASURER:\n\nIf we lose that role we are going to lose something very important in society.\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nGiven the controversies that have been surrounding the churches for a while now do you think it was a wise appointment to appoint Dr Hollingworth to the Governor-General position and are you happy now that it is not a man of the cloth in that position?\n\nTREASURER:\n\nWell, look, the appointment was made. Dr Hollingworth has now stood down from the office. I don't think there is much point in going over the events except to say this, that we learnt something important, I think, through the episode, and that is, that you can't turn a blind eye to sexual abuse in the church or anywhere else. And if that lesson has been learnt then that is one of the positives which has come out of this.\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nShould gays be welcome in the Anglican Church?\n\nTREASURER:\n\nWell look, this is a matter for Anglican theology and I don't advise...\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nYour view?\n\nTREASURER:\n\n...well I don't advise the Anglican Church on theological issues. I take advice on political issues but I wouldn't presume to advise them on theological issues.\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nTreasurer, lower interest rates will help families, are you hoping the Reserve Bank will deliver that next week?\n\nTREASURER:\n\nLook, we set interest rates in Australia according to Australian conditions. We have an inflation target, underlying inflation of 2-3 per cent, and we are within that. In fact pressure is probably coming off in relation to inflation. But the world is weak, Australia continues to outperform the other developed world economies and until such time as we see a US recovery, that is going to make things difficult here in Australia, so I welcome the fact that the US Fed has cut interest rates in the last twenty-four hours and I hope that will lead to stronger conditions in the United States.\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nThe Opposition is suggesting if we do have a cut it shows our economy is in real trouble, how do you respond to that?\n\nTREASURER:\n\nWell, the Opposition is usually so confused in relation to economic policy it is hard to follow their twists and turns.\n\nJOURNALIST:\n\nSo you expect Peter Costello to be buying more into social issues in the future?\n\nTREASURER:\n\nLove to, love to have the opportunity to do so. And I will be taking those opportunities. Thanks very much. Thank you."
