        "text": "LUBBOCK, Texas – Led by last year's Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes II, former Texas Tech football players are getting set to make an impact on another NFL season. Thursday night will mark the first of three NFL preseason weeks for players to either tune-up for the regular season or turn heads in hopes of earning a spot on a 53-man roster when the regular season kicks off, Sept. 5-9.\n\nEntering week one of the preseason, 16 former Red Raiders are listed on one of 32 NFL rosters across the league. Fans did get a taste of NFL football last week with the annual Hall of Fame game that pit the Chicago Bears against the Houston Texans, a contest that featured former Red Raider Douglas Coleman III, who was signed by the Bears this past offseason after appearing in 22 games for the Ottawa Redblacks over the previous two seasons. Coleman saw the field for 18 plays, 12 of which were on defense, but did not record a stat in the contest that was canceled in the third quarter due to bad weather in the Canton, Ohio area.\n\nWhile the better half of the world is familiar with arguably the greatest quarterback in the game right now, Texas Tech has 15 others listed on rosters. Six of those include players from the 2023 Red Raider football team starting with NFL Draft selections Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (fourth-round, Arizona Cardinals) and Myles Cole (seventh-round, Jacksonville Jaguars). In addition, Baylor Cupp (Kansas City), Tyler Owens (Washington), Cole Spencer (Tennessee) and Rayshad Williams (Las Vegas) were each signed as undrafted free agents and aiming to impress over the next three weeks.\n\nEntering 2024, of those currently listed on rosters, Mahomes and Le'Raven Clark are the eldest statesmen, who are both entering their eighth NFL season. In 2023, that benchmark was led by Cody Davis, but he retired this past April after enjoying an 11-year NFL career.\n\nRED RAIDERS ON NFL ROSTERS (as of Aug. 7, 2024):\n\nPatrick Mahomes II, QB (2014-16), Kansas City Chiefs | Exp. 8\n\nSam Eguavoen, LB (2011-14), New York Jets | Exp. 6\n\nJordyn Brooks, LB (2016-19), Miami Dolphins | Exp. 5\n\nTerence Steele, OL (2016-19), Dallas Cowboys | Exp. 5\n\nBroderick Washington Jr., DL (2016-19), Baltimore Ravens | Exp. 5\n\nZech McPhearson, DB (2019-20), Philadelphia Eagles | Exp. 4\n\nErik Ezukanma, WR (2019-21), Miami Dolphins | Exp. 3\n\nTyree Wilson, DE (2020-22), Las Vegas Raiders | Exp. 2\n\nDouglas Coleman III, DB (2016-19), Chicago Bears | Exp. 1\n\nDadrion Taylor-Demerson, S (2019-23), Arizona Cardinals | Exp.
