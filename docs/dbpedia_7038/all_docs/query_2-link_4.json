        "text": "John Buchanan, Lindfield, May 6.\n\n\"The people's will: G-G must resign,\" said your headline. Have raw figures replaced moral principles in this country? Besides, at what stage does the wish of a number of the population become \"the people's will\", and by whose authority does that amoral process gain momentum? By the authority of a kind of national kangaroo court generated and sustained by a few media outlets, perhaps?\n\nIf a number of Federal Government members are coming out of the woodwork, we must remember that the body to which they belong was a silent witness to the ultimate child abuse that took place in Iraq for more than a decade: the death of half a million kids (UN figures) because of lack of food and medicines during a mainly US-orchestrated Gulf blockade - with token help from the RAN.\n\nHenk Verhoeven, Beacon Hill, May 6.\n\nYour poll reveals that 76 per cent of Australians want Peter Hollingworth out. I am surprised you did not report that 98 per cent of Australians want Sir William Deane back.\n\nDr Matthew Ogilvie, Drummoyne, May 6.\n\nJohn Howard will face a problem replacing the G-G when Peter Hollingworth finally falls on his mitre. The salary is not enough to attract an American CEO, Peter Reith has just taken a cushy job in Europe and Archbishop Jensen would want to bring his whole family. Shane Warne could do it for a year or so, but the front runner would be John Elliott, who's at a loose end right now.\n\nLee Pearce, Coolgardie, May 6.\n\nThe G-G's biggest mistake is not becoming a terrorist and changing his name to Saddam Hussein. If he had done that, then calls for his dismissal or resignation would immediately end, attacks on him would be dismissed as CIA plots and the air would ring with the clamours of academics, lawyers and human rights activists that he hadn't been convicted of any crime.\n\nChristopher Holland, Queanbeyan, May 6.\n\nWould Peter Hollingworth have been appointed Governor-General had his conduct been known at the time his appointment was being considered? Is he, in the light of the knowledge of his conduct, a fit and proper person to hold the office? I think the \"nos\" have it.\n\nBrian Dennis, Warners Bay, May 6.\n\nA piece of advice to our Governor-General. Buying AMP shares at $45 is an error in judgement. Leaving a self-confessed sexual predator as a priest is not.\n\nRod Baker, Mosman, May 6.\n\nWhen John Howard appointed Peter Hollingworth as Governor-General, he remarked that he could think of no woman with \"sufficient gravitas\" for the position. What price gravitas now?\n\nM.E. Browne, Greenwich, May 6.\n\nThe PM said he knew of no woman with \"sufficient gravitas\" to take on the role of Governor-General. Perhaps he made a grave error of judgement?\n\nChristina Wilcox, Cremorne, May 6.\n\nDr Hollingworth previously commented that a 15-year-old girl must have encouraged the older priest to abuse her. Does this mean that I, at five or six years of age, must also have encouraged my maternal grandfather to sexually abuse me?\n\nDr Hollingworth should go. I don't wish to participate in paying for his social life while in his position as G-G. He is completely insensitive to all those people who have a history of abuse, and had he spoken out sooner he probably could have helped prevent others being similarly abused.\n\nName withheld, Waterloo, May 6.\n\nAustralia's \"man of steel\", John Howard, must act swiftly lest the Governor-General becomes, as it were, his kryptonite.\n\nGeorge Fishman, Vaucluse, May 6.\n\nI'm still waiting for the first letter to accuse the Governor-General's critics of being politically correct.\n\nBarry Yau, Canberra, May 5.\n\nTo AFL fans, Peter Hollingworth committed the ultimate sin early in his period as archbishop of Brisbane. He switched from being a life-long supporter of the Melbourne Demons to be the No.1 ticket holder for the Brisbane Lions.\n\nTony Nicod, Maroubra, May 6.\n\nThe G-G has two options: resign with the remnants of dignity, or remain as an unwanted stubborn old man.\n\nJ.W. Strauch, Camden, May 6.\n\nNo long-term good for Australians in demutualisation\n\nAMP is just the latest example of the many mutual organisations that had been strong, vigorous and healthy members of the Australian business community that have disintegrated after the ministrations of the financial community.\n\nWe were told that these organisations were dinosaurs from a past age and that they needed to be privatised to grow further and to flourish in the future.\n\nThose who peddled this mendacity and snake oil have now departed into the sunset, with large wads of the very safe cash these organisations previously held on behalf of their members.\n\nI wonder if we will ever learn that these smooth talkers also generally have their hands in our wallets as they sell us their lines of spiel?\n\nLes MacDonald, Balmain, May 6.\n\nDoes anyone remember those AMP ads where the rich guy from the future comes back to advise his younger poor self to trust AMP?\n\nPeter Fyfe, Lavender Bay, May 6.\n\nThe April edition of the AMP's Shareholder News warns shareholders to carefully check the share price before accepting David Tweed's offer to purchase their holdings at $5 a share. Not a whisper that AMP management intended to force the share price down to that level. Mr Tweed is starting to look like the good guy in all this.\n\nJulian Bowditch, Bexley, May 6.\n\nDoes the market collapse of AMP, with its dire impact on many self-funded retirees, taken together with the shambles at the once-proud NRMA, have any implications for the merits of the demutualisation of former efficient protectors of the community's savings and interests? Clearly, the lads in red braces and striped shirts did well out of the demutualisation push. So did some investors in the short term. But long term- good for Australians?\n\nMarie Coleman, Mitchell (ACT), May 6.\n\nI voted \"no\" in the AMP demutualisation poll and sold my share allocation within half an hour of them being listed. It seems I might have been right for once.\n\nDavid Morrison,Springwood, May 6.\n\nDon't blame the women, blame the wheels\n\nRoss Vere (Letters, May 6) is concerned about women \"drivers\" of shopping trolleys. Why blame women when the problem is the \"four wheel swivel\"?\n\nExcept for Australia, shopping carts throughout the world are designed like cars in that the rear wheels are fixed in line. Imagine trying to control a car if the rear wheels swivelled freely. Just fix the rear wheels and the problem is gone forever.\n\nRon and Mavis Haigh, Mosman, May 6.\n\nRoss Vere, now you know what it's like being a woman driver trying to negotiate Sydney traffic while being harassed and abused by male road ragers. Such male drivers would probably not dare to target other men, but seem to think it is their right to belittle women.\n\nSo, if men tend to defend their \"rights\" to the road, maybe women in the supermarket are just claiming their territory.\n\nVanessa Boardman, Riverwood, May 6.\n\nRoss Vere says: \"I close my eyes and forge forward, hoping I surface at the other end with all my limbs intact\". Perhaps if he tried opening his eyes while steering his trolley he may have fewer accidents, rather than relying on his ESP (extra-supercilious perception).\n\nGrea Korting, Stanmore, May 6.\n\nYippee! A free Herald\n\nOh, gosh - when I opened my Therapeutic Goods Administration recall list this morning I found a free Herald. Yippee!\n\nCatherine Craddock, Hornsby, May 6.\n\nRaising the board\n\nIf it was meant that men were to do the ironing, ironing boards would have been made higher.\n\nPaul Fitzjames, Bateau Bay, May 6.\n\nNo comparison\n\nMarc Whittaker (Letters, May 6) compares a melee in an AFL match at the weekend and an NRL incident involving Gorden Tallis striking another player. The difference is the AFL will punish those involved. Tallis went unpunished. The AFL has been pro-active in stamping violence out of the game. The same cannot be said for league. I have never seen an AFL coach strike one of his players.\n\nDarren O'Bryen, Davidson, May 6.\n\nNot happy, Harry\n\nIt was with great disillusionment that I learnt that the new Harry Potter book, keenly anticipated by our family, will be released only in hard cover at the exorbitant price - for a children's book - of $45.\n\nThe other four Harry Potter books my daughter owns were released as paperbacks. And when will a paperback be released? In 12 months, I'm told. A very opportunistic money grab, indeed.\n\nStefan Jarnason, Bondi, May 6.\n\nTell us all how much 'free' trade will cost\n\nI know there don't seem to be many left in this country, but can we hear from someone trustworthy - someone without vested interests in a free trade deal with the US - to tell us what the real benefits of such a deal will be to the majority of Australians and not just the wealthy. Perhaps Allan Fels of the ACCC could give us his thoughts before the Government replaces him with a yes man for big business?\n\nIan Newman, Cammeray, May 6.\n\nThinking about the looming free trade deal with the US, I was reminded of a useful truism: \"And the lion shall lie down with the lamb. But the lamb won't get much sleep.\"\n\nGeorge Dodd, Glebe, May 6.\n\nClosing the gap\n\nThanks to Jenny Goldie (Letters, May 6) for enlightening me that all those migrants are to blame for the widening gap between rich and poor in Australia. And here I was thinking it was caused by the cult of consumerism and the economic policies that go with it.\n\nNow that our natural birthrate is below the replacement rate for the population, let's pull up the drawbridge altogether, and in 100 years or so there'll be no rich, no poor, and no gap.\n\nM. Mercurius, Summer Hill, May 6.\n\nA little bird told me\n\nIn his dispatch about the Prime Minister, John Howard, being honoured at Yankee Stadium, Mark Riley writes: \"No one at the ground could remember the last time they played another country's anthem at the start of a Yankees game.\" (\"Yankees pitch Howard a home run\", Herald, May 6). Hmm ... how about April 17 when the Toronto Blue Jays last played there?\n\nWilliam Willitts, Earlwood, May 6.\n\nSo I hear John Howard received a standing ovation from the crowd at a baseball game in New York. Now if he can repeat the feat in Australia at a footy match I'll really be impressed.\n\nJoe Valence, Cherrybrook, May 6.\n\nDrugs a global problem\n\nPrescription drug abuse is not just a celebrity phenomenon in California (\"Doctor, Interrupted and the showgirl\", Herald, May 5). It is common here, too, but grossly under-reported because of the status of the patients involved. Doctors could check on whether their patients were abusing prescription drugs until this year when a national hotline was suspended by the federal government.\n\nControls on narcotic medication in particular can be circumvented and there is a flourishing black market in Sydney for the same drugs taken by the glitterati in LA.\n\nDr Raymond Seidler, Kings Cross, May 6.\n\nFighting crime is tough\n\nWhat a great piece by Mark Latham (\"Out with enclaves and in with villages: keeping crooks at bay\", Herald, May 5).\n\nA few years ago the South Australian Government caused a significant reduction in car theft by running buses to Adelaide's outer suburbs late on Friday and Saturday nights. Suddenly young people didn't need to steal a car to get home.\n\nSadly all we hear these days is \"We're gunna get tough on crime by locking the bastards up longer\". But the first politician to say \"I'm gunna get tough on crime by having better social policy, better urban planning, better public transport and better education\" - and mean it - gets my vote.\n\nMax Perry, Kingsgrove, May 6.\n\nDesigns on the body\n\nI applaud the article by Rachael Oakes-Ash recommending that we women cease to follow the dictates of our own sex - that thin and thinner are the only way to live (\"Take a day off from self-loathing, girls. And don't go back\", Herald, May 6).\n\nHowever, as one who fights the flab fight, there is one, overwhelming practical reason for most of us struggling to get down to size 12 or better. Try buying some halfway decent clothes to fit!\n\nRecently I found all pretty, well-cut bras stopped at size 16C (if you're into DD, well, it's a sort of ghastly hammock affair), and all smart, fashion clothes sold by major retailers stop at either dress size 14 or 16. If you're an 18 or greater - well, it's tent city. Perhaps if some dress designer had the guts to try designing attractive, sexy clothes for the larger figure we might be happy being the size we are.\n\nPam Reid, Mt Barker (SA), May 6.\n\nWeed out troublemakers\n\nCongratulations to the Blue Mountains City Council for taking steps to protect native vegetation near our national parks (\"Gardeners dig in against native aggression for a war of the roses\", Herald, May 3-4). The damage caused by weed infestation is massive. Protecting our bushland is a simple way we can prevent more damage. Perhaps this is something those of us in Sydney councils close to national parks should also try to achieve."
