        "text": "Just One Thing: Framing Tim Walz\n\nKamala Harris chose as her running mate a guy who wasn’t even in the conversation 10 days earlier, Tim Walz, the uber-progressive governor of Minnesota. You can frame him as a teacher, football coach, veteran, former Congressman, hunter, and a guy you’d like to have a beer with. You can frame him as a loony leftist who supports higher taxes, forcing everybody to drive electric cars, abortion up until birth, subsidized health care for illegal aliens, and open borders so there are more illegals to subsidize. It will be up to the Democrats to make you think he’s the former and up to the Republicans to make you think he's the latter. I guess you could say all of those descriptors are true, but because he’s running for VP and not for toastmaster, I strongly oppose Tim Walz.\n\nAll the Wrong People Are Celebrating Tim Walz | The Free Press (thefp.com)\n\nHe set up a snitch line during COVID: Coronavirus In Minnesota: Where To Call If You See People Who Aren't Social Distancing - CBS Minnesota (cbsnews.com)\n\nToday's Guests\n\nJessica Melugin is the Director of CEI’s Center for Technology & Innovation.

Tlaib will need to find a new playmate.)\n\nAnother congressional anti-Semite bites the (political) dust: Progressive Rep. Cori Bush loses high-stakes Democratic primary: AP projection - ABC News (go.com)\n\nThis was the second-most expensive primary this cycle, the only one beating it being the Jamaal Bowman primary in NY where another black anti-Semite, Jamaal Bowman, was defeated. I sure wish there weren't so much anti-Semitism among African-Americans. Bush was also facing a bad reputation for too much time spent on national politics and trolling for clicks and fame, arguably the same issue that was facing Lauren Boebert. But Boebert had 5 others challenge her, most of whom had some level of credibility, splitting the anti-Boebert vote. While there were four people in the primary in St Louis, two of them had no real credibility and combined for just over 3% of the vote. Thus, it was effectively a head-to-head matchup that Cori Bush lost. The next member of Congress from St Louis will be a very liberal African-American prosecutor named Wesley Bell. I trust that Bush will remain a race-hustler/grifter as it appears to be what she's best at.\n\nHere's Terrence K Williams, a bigly Trump-supporting black comedian:\n\nA perfect summary of Kamala Harris: Kamala Harris and the Art of Failing Up (freebeacon.com)\n\nCan Bangladesh succeed?
