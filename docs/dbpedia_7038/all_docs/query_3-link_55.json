        "text": "TO ALL LIUNA REGIONAL OFFICES, DISTRICT COUNCILS, LOCAL UNIONS AND AFFILIATES\n\nRE: Changes to the LIUNA General Executive Board (pdf)\n\nMarch 28, 2023 LiUNA Press Release (pdf)\n\nYesterday, LIUNA General President Terry O'Sullivan announced to the LIUNA General Executive Board (GEB) that he will retire from the office of General President, effective Sunday, April 30, 2023. General President O'Sullivan states he is pleased to report that the GEB voted unanimously to appoint LIUNA Vice President Brent Booker to become LIUNA’s eleventh General President at that time. Brent is a third-generation Laborer’s Laborer, the son of retired LIUNA General Secretary-Treasurer Carl E. Booker, and the grandson of Local Union 795 Business Manager Carl W. Booker. Brent served as LIUNA Director of Construction until 2012, when he assumed the post of General Secretary-Treasurer of the North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU). He returned to LIUNA last fall, and became Vice President upon the retirement of LIUNA Vice President Ralph Cole.\n\nAt this same meeting, LIUNA General Secretary-Treasurer Armand E. Sabitoni announced his retirement, also effective Sunday, April 30, 2023. The GEB voted unanimously to appoint LIUNA Vice President and Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council Business Manager Michael F. Sabitoni to become our next General-Secretary Treasurer at that time. A third-generation Laborer from a legendary LIUNA family, Michael was elected Vice President by the GEB last year, to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of LIUNA Vice President and Assistant New England Regional Manager Vincent Masino. I know that Michael, like Armand, will ensure that LIUNA continues to have the financial resources we need to succeed and grow.\n\nLIUNA Vice President, Pacific Southwest Regional Manager, and Special Assistant to the General President Rocco Davis also announced his retirement, effective April 30, 2023. The GEB elected Assistant Pacific Southwest Regional Manager Ernie Ordonez to serve as LIUNA Vice President, and I appointed him Pacific Southwest Regional Manager.\n\nThe GEB also made several other unanimous leadership changes at yesterday’s meeting, all effective May 1, 2023.\n\nLocal Union 271 Secretary-Treasurer Dan Bianco was elected Vice President to fill Michael Sabitoni’s Vice President seat on the GEB, and I appointed Dan New England Regional Manager.\n\nLIUNA Executive Director and Assistant Ohio Valley and Southern States Regional Manager Steve Farner was elected Vice President to fill Brent Booker’s Vice President seat on the GEB.\n\nLIUNA Vice President and Great Lakes Regional Manager Terrence M. Healy was named Special Assistant to the General President.\n\nLIUNA Vice President and Central and Eastern Canada Regional Manager Joseph S. Mancinelli was named Canadian Director.\n\nThese changes follow two important leadership changes last year. Mason Tenders’ District Council Business Manager Michael E. Hellstrom was unanimously elected LIUNA Vice President upon the retirement of Vice President and Eastern Regional Manager Ray Pocino, and General President O'Sullivan appointed Michael as Eastern Regional Manager. Indiana District Council Business Manager and Secretary-Treasurer David A. Frye was unanimously elected LIUNA Vice President upon the retirement of Vice President and Midwest Regional Manager John Penn. General President O'Sullivan also appointed David as Midwest Regional Manager.\n\nGeneral President O'Sullivan states he is confident that this new leadership team will continue to move our great International Union forward, and to build upon the foundation left by all those who came before us."
