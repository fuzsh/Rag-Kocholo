Thomas Steitz born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 for his work on the structure and function of ribosome. He shared the prize with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Ada Yonath. Steitz is a Sterling Professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University. In 2007, he won the Gairdner International Award for his work on ribosome structure and function.

As an undergraduate Steitz studied chemistry at Lawrence University. He received a PhD in molecular biology and biochemistry from Harvard University. Steitz made contributions to determine the molecular structure of the large 50 S ribosomal unit, carboxypeptidase A and aspartate carbamoyltransferase.

During the period of 1967-1970, Steitz did his postdoctoral research at MRC laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University as Jane Coffin Childs Postdoctoral Fellow. He was a Macy Fellow during 1976-77 doing research at University of Gottingen. Thomas Steitz was a Fairchild Scholar at the California Institute of Technology during 1984-85.
