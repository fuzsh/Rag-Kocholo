        "text": "CARUSO: Thank you very much for taking the time to meet with me. We're here at Dr. Stryer's office at Stanford University. And what I'd like to do is really start from beginning. I know you were born in 1938 in--I hope I pronounce this correctly--Tientsin, China.\n\nSTRYER: That's right. It's now called [--] Tianjin; Tientsin was the [old name used by] Europeans.\n\nCARUSO: Okay. And were you raised there? Or were you just born there and your family left?\n\nSTRYER: The story here is that my dad, who was born in Germany, started doing business in China in the 1920s and spent a good deal of time in the Far East generally. My mother was born in Russia and left Russia around 1915. Her family wanted to pursue better economic opportunities, to get away from the pogroms, and her family settled in Harbin. My parents met in 1937, in [Harbin] and got married within a few weeks.\n\nIt turned out that China was a very good haven from [Adolph] Hitler and [Joseph] Stalin during World War II, and we were fortunate not to be bothered by the Japanese. There was the Japanese occupation, but we slipped between the cracks, and we managed to get along reasonably well during World War II, during the Japanese occupation, and came to the United States in 1948. I recall during World War II, as the U.S. B29s were bombing Shanghai, my dad would point to them and point to a U.S. flag and say, \"That's going to be your country.\" It was his expectation that the war would end and that everything would work out well. And it did.\n\nCARUSO: What business was your father in?\n\nSTRYER: Hog hair; bristles for brushes.\n\nCARUSO: Brushes, okay.\n\nSTRYER: In the days before nylon.\n\nCARUSO: And did your mother have an occupation, or was she more of a stay-at-home?\n\nSTRYER: She was more of a stay-at-home [mother]. It was very unusual in those days, especially in the Orient, for women to work, to have careers.\n\nCARUSO: [--] What sort of family life did you have growing up? Were you near other children? I don't know the state of the city that you were in--I don't know if it's large or small, rural--\n\nSTRYER: Well, let's start with Shanghai. After Pearl Harbor Day [7 December 1941] the Japanese occupied the city, and sometime after [that--] U.S. citizens--including my aunt and uncle--and Canadians and the British were taken to detention camps and kept there during the war. A large part of the [foreign] community vanished from Shanghai. It was a very solitary existence during the war.\n\nI went to a school run by two Danish ladies in their apartment. It was a one-room, one-apartment schoolhouse with about fifteen kids in it, most of whom had slipped between the cracks as my family did [--]. We taught each other. Once I learned subtraction, I would teach addition--which I had learned before--to the younger student, and I would learn multiplication from the older student. There was very much a spirit of learning by teaching, and I think that's where I developed my love for teaching and my capacity to use teaching as a way of continuing my learning and exploring new areas. It was a wonderful school.\n\nAfter World War II, after V-J Day [15 August 1945], starting in the fall of 1945, the Shanghai American School opened again [--]. I had a lot of friends there. It was a very good time [in Shanghai, from 1945 to] 1948. We had planned to come to the United States. We received an immigration visa, came here, and it was fortunate--the timing was fortunate because it was just then that Mao [Zedong] was coming down from north China and, in not too long, Shanghai--like much of China--fell into Communist hands. And so, it was a very good time to leave the country.\n\n[I] moved to Forest Hills, New York and there met a wonderful group of youngsters. Many of them were immigrants. They were all eager to learn. [I went to] a fabulous school there, and that's where I got interested in science. And so, I would say that my childhood had different periods: a period of relative solitude and staying out of the way and not being very visible during World War II, and then very lively years in Forest Hills before I went to college.\n\nCARUSO: Just to focus a little more on your time in China, the one-apartment school that you were attending with just a few number of students, were they just teaching you basic language skills, basic reading skills, or did you have a relatively diverse curriculum that they were trying to give you at the time?\n\nSTRYER: I don't really remember. [--] I left that school when I was seven years old, and so I was there probably at ages five, six, seven. What I do remember was the basic skills of reading and arithmetic. I also remember that it was a very interesting place; [--] I really wanted to go there every day.\n\nCARUSO: And when you transitioned into the more formal school setting, were you introduced to regular subjects at that point?\n\nSTRYER: Yes. Yes. And actually, there's a funny story on that. So, I was seven years old. My dad registered me at the Shanghai American School, which got rolling very soon after V-J Day. [--] 14 August was when the war ended, and the school opened soon after, and the reason was that the principal and all the teachers had been interned by the Japanese, and they were ready to go. They had a lot of time while in detention to plan the next school year, whenever that would come. When my dad registered me, they said, \"Well, seven years old. We'll put him in the second grade.\" My dad took me to school the first day and led me to a classroom. The teacher started by saying, \"Welcome, third graders.\" I said, \"Oh my god. I'm in the wrong class,\" but I just kept quiet. And she said, \"I want to make sure that all of you will be happy here, so I'm going to give you a little test to see what your skills are and make sure that this is the right classroom for you.\" And so she did that. I took this little test, and after about an hour or so, she said, \"Lubert, would you please come up here and talk to me?\" And I said, \"Ah, she found me out. I'll be sent to second grade.\" And she said, \"You know, I just looked at your test, and I don't think you'd be happy in this classroom. I think you need more [of a] challenge, and we're going to put you in the fourth grade.\" So, within two hours, I skipped two grades. [I] came home, and I just could not break the news to my parents that way. I said I was promoted to third grade, and the next day I came home and I told my parents I was promoted to fourth grade. And years later, when I told them this story, they just would not believe me. So, that accounted for my getting a very early start in science.\n\nCARUSO: So, just basic science classes, the introduction to everything?\n\nSTRYER: Right. The Shanghai American School was very much run the way an elementary school here in the United States in a suburb would be run. It was a very colonial environment. There was no teaching of the Chinese language, to my great regret. I forgot Chinese while I was in China, and that's something that really saddens me to this day [--]. It was a good school, a lot of fun.\n\nAnd then in New York, I went to a junior high school in Forest Hills, and it was a hard transition for me going from the school [in Shanghai] that had large playing fields, kind of like what Stanford has in some of its athletic areas--very open, very cloistered, protected from the world. [I was dismayed to] go to a junior high school that was right on the street .I wouldn't quite call it an urban jungle, but it did not have a campus feel.\n\nBut then Forest Hills High School had more of that feeling that I had first experienced in China, of a real campus and a very aesthetic environment. And there, the classes were really terrific, [especially] in science. I remember each of my teachers, and I remember many of the things that they taught. For example, Mr. McSheehy, who was my physics teacher, gave me a ruler and asked me to measure something, and I measured it from the tip of the ruler, where the zero point is, to 4.3 inches or whatever, and he said, \"No, that's not the best way to do it, because,\" he said, \"the end of the ruler might be eroded. You want to start it at the one, where it's in good shape.\" [These lessons] I remember to this day. I also had incredibly good teachers in history and English: I was introduced to The New Yorker magazine, which I continue to enjoy. I had a first-class high school education.\n\nCARUSO: What actually prompted the move to the United States? Why did your family want to come to the U.S.?\n\nSTRYER: It was very much a feeling that this was going to be the future for me. My dad had visited the United States in the 1930s and thought that this was just a great country. My mother--most of my mother's family was from Russia, the ones who had gone to the Far East, many of them came to New York. The older generation was in the fur trade. The next generation, many of them went into academic life. It was a family that valued learning and culture [--]. My dad loved the commerce of the Far East, but he recognized very early that this was the country for me, and so it was very much in the plans [--]. I admired [his attitude]: \"This war will be over. The Japanese will be out of here, and we'll be heading to the United States.\"\n\nCARUSO: Do you remember what the travel was like? How did you actually get from where you were to the United States? How long did it take?\n\nSTRYER: Very pleasantly. It was on a Pan Am[erican World Airways] plane. It had sleeper seats, [--which were] very comfortable. It would be the equivalent of first class today. And the path was interesting [--]. We left on 6 December 1948, and the first stop was Tokyo, which was under [General] Douglas MacArthur in the U.S. occupation. In retrospect, fortunately, there was a mechanical problem with the plane, and so we had to spend another day in Tokyo. We got a very good tour of the city. Saw Mount Fuji resplendent--a very clear day. I haven't seen Mount Fuji that clear from Tokyo since.\n\nCARUSO: Had Tokyo recovered, pretty much, from the fire bombings?\n\nSTRYER: No. No. It was still recovering. The hotels weren't really functioning or there were very few of them. We were put up in railway Pullman cars.\n\nThe next stop was Wake Island. We had a military base there, and it was really something coming from cold Tokyo to tropical Wake Island. I remember the beach [of] Wake Island, you could see shrapnel. The war had ended only about three years earlier.\n\nThe next stop was Midway Island, and it was very interesting seeing the Gooney birds [albatrosses]. It was the middle of the day.\n\nAnd then we landed in Honolulu Territory, Hawaii, our formal entrance into the United States. It took only a few minutes to go through immigration. I marvel at that when I look at the long lines today. And I vividly remember my dad pulling out one hundred and fifty dollars. Fifty dollars per person was the immigration fee--a lot of money, well spent--and we were on U.S. soil. We then flew to San Francisco [California], where my aunt and uncle greeted us. We spent a couple weeks here and then went to New York by train, and a few weeks later got settled in Forest Hills.\n\nCARUSO: And was New York because of it being a commerce center? Was it because your mother's family had been moving in that direction?\n\nSTRYER: It was both. For my dad, it was the center of commerce. [--But] within a very short period, business was tough because Mao took over China. Trade with China stopped. So, first he loses a business to Hitler, then he loses a business to Mao, and it took him quite a few years to really get going again. So, economically, they were tough years after a rather comfortable time in China.\n\nCARUSO: And did he stay in the same business, or did he--\n\nSTRYER: Bristles were gone, for two reasons. One was the supply of bristles [was gone]--trade with China stopped--and, [second], nylon came in. Probably even without Mao, my guess is that my dad would have had to change his [business] area, an example of [technological displacement].\n\nCARUSO: What did he move into then?\n\nSTRYER: Went into scissors with Italy. He was a born trader.\n\nCARUSO: You mentioned that ultimately, once you got settled into Forest Hills, especially when you got to high school, it was a nice community to be in, but how was the transition for you? You came over starting in December. You took a little while to get settled in. You probably didn't go to school until the following fall?\n\nSTRYER: No. [I] went to school in Forest Hills within a day of getting our apartment there--mid-January.\n\nCARUSO: Okay. And how was it starting up--I mean, this was--\n\nSTRYER: It was very uncomfortable because it felt like--this is a slight exaggeration--it felt like an inner-city school. Here I had these gorgeous playing fields--The Shanghai American School, kind of, had colonial architecture. It looked like [The College of] William and Mary or something like that. And I went back years later--a few years ago I was in Shanghai and I went back there and saw the outside, and [the front of the school] still looks lovely today.\n\nAnd so suddenly from a class size of maybe eighteen to a class size of maybe more than thirty. It was a shock, coupled with the fact that it was a difficult time for my dad. For my mother, not having servants was hard. She was very used to that over the course of her life. It was tough until I got to Forest Hills High School, where I really found an incredible community of kids, and that changed everything.\n\nCARUSO: When you went into the school system, since you were, I guess in some ways, two years ahead when you were in China, did you keep that same pattern when you enrolled in school in the United States? Were you younger than all your classmates?\n\nSTRYER: Yes, I kept the same pattern, but it [--got] exacerbated. When I was at the University of Chicago, my adviser there said to me in my sophomore year, \"You know, Lubert, you've got enough placing out advanced credit that you really could graduate here in three years.\" And so, I had a three-year undergraduate education. I got three years ahead of the game.\n\nCARUSO: Okay. Oh, wow. So, you graduated in '57, so you were 19. That's three years ahead of the game. When you came to the United States and you were starting up schooling here, did you find that the classes--I'm assuming you started in junior high school?\n\nSTRYER: Correct.\n\nCARUSO: [--] Like the tail end of seventh grade?\n\nSTRYER: [Yes, exactly].\n\nCARUSO: So, the tail end of seventh grade. You at least had some time with--\n\nSTRYER: Yes. And then--and junior high included eighth and ninth, and I went into Forest Hills High School in the tenth grade.\n\nCARUSO: Tenth grade, okay. And how did the students respond to you? I don't know if you came in--you probably had a different background from many of the students.\n\nSTRYER: Yes, and it was awkward. Now, at one level, it was easy getting adjusted. In China, I was a [New York] Yankee fan; on the Armed Forces Radio, I would hear about Joe DiMaggio. [--] Baseball was no surprise to me. I played baseball in China. But there was something that felt just very different, and it was hard. It was a different culture. But then, as I said, once I hit high school, there was a group of students who loved learning and were very sharp. They were fun, they were funny, and we had a great time.\n\nCARUSO: How did your family treat your education? Clearly, you were advanced. Clearly, you were a smart child. Were they ever really involved in your education: when you came home, they made sure you sat down and did your homework, or they reviewed things once you've --?\n\nSTRYER: Never. They never asked me when my homework was due. They never asked me what my homework was. That was my world. That was my responsibility, and they never gave advice on which subjects to take or not take. And they, very early, very much respected my decisions, for which I am very grateful.\n\nCARUSO: Did you have any responsibilities, outside of being a student, in the home? Did you have chores to do? On the weekends you were expected to mow the lawn or anything along those lines? Or was it pretty much that your job was being a student?\n\nSTRYER: I think, like many immigrant kids, I was, kind of, an interface to the broader society. I can't give you an example but I would occasionally run interference because I was treated as someone who was on the in with this new [society]. My parents spoke English. It was the common language of my parents. My dad's native language was German. My mother's was Russian. English was their second language, and they spoke English all their life together. Russian and German were forbidden languages. These were the languages of oppression, and they didn't want me to learn [them]. They wanted me to speak only English. And so, while they had a good command of English, there were still certain things that were [difficult for them to express]--I was getting information for them or handling something at a rather early age.\n\nCARUSO: In some ways, acting more like, maybe, a cultural broker since you were involved in the high school.\n\nSTRYER: Yes. Yes, that's a good way to put it.\n\nCARUSO: Did you have hobbies as a child? Did you like to take nature walks? Did you read tons? Did you like playing sports? I know you mentioned you listened to baseball and--\n\nSTRYER: I love baseball. Apart from baseball, I was not good at athletics. First, I'm short, and then being two years ahead really makes you the smallest kid on the block. I enjoyed writing. After World War II, I would put out, from time to time, a little newspaper called The Daily Bugle, where I reported on events and banged it out on a typewriter with carbon paper. And my aunt and uncle fortunately kept some copies of it, and it's kind of amusing. So, streaks of the future writer were already evident. I very much enjoyed photography, and I remember when I was in the eighth or ninth grade that I saved up enough money--I remember the exact amount, it was fifty dollars--and I got a Voigtlander Vito camera and joined the camera club at the high school in later years. I did a lot of processing of film and printing, and I got an enlarger. One of my other friends liked photography, so I was really into photography. I enjoyed doing chemical experiments, to the consternation of my parents. So, I was into--yeah, very much into chemistry...and sandlot baseball.\n\nCARUSO: Okay. Was there any specific type of photography that you enjoyed more, were you--snapshots of the world around you? Was it scenic shots? Was it just going out with a camera?\n\nSTRYER: It was very eclectic. It was going out with the camera, and sometimes it would be people. Sometimes it would be a flower. Sometimes it would be a zoo scene, a street scene.\n\nCARUSO: Let's talk a little bit about your high school, since it sounds like that's where a lot of your interests wound up developing even more, and you mentioned that you had a number of good teachers and good friends. What classes were you--you had high school for three years. What classes were you taking in high school? Was it standard English, math, bio, chem?\n\nSTRYER: The classes were English, French, social studies, and a science course and they were all very positive experiences. I started out high school, and for a year or a year-and-a-half, I was very much interested in Law. I had a very good grasp of American history, of the U.S. Constitution. I won a contest that was run by [United States Military Academy at] West Point on American history. I won it in my high school. In my high school, the graduating class was about 900 students; it was a good size school.\n\nI was just fascinated by history, [--] history looking towards law. And my guidance counselor one day pulled me aside and said, \"Lubert, that's fine, but you should really be thinking about engineering. You're not going to make any money in law, and you have a good mind, and you should be really thinking about engineering.\" [--] It did not particularly inspire me but it was heartfelt advice.\n\nThen one day the chairman of the science department, Paul [F.] Brandwein, asked to see me, and he said, \"I see you've been doing well in science courses. I would like you to do some research. I think you might enjoy it.\" So I said, \"Well, that's a good idea.\" He didn't try to dissuade me from social studies at all. The first project involved bioluminescent bacteria. And I was, right away, hooked [--]. The idea that you can explore new terrain was very exciting. But there were some nasty looking colonies on the plate, and so Dr. Brandwein said, \"This is a good project, but we really don't have the facilities here for you to carry it out safely. Here are a bunch of papers. You read them, and maybe you'll get an idea about some other project. And so, I read them, and there was a project on aging. Albert [I.] Lansing, who was a scientist in Michigan, was studying aging in rotifers, and rotifers seemed pretty harmless. And so, that was, in fact, my high school project, the effect of maternal age on the lifespan of the offspring rotifers. Paul Brandwein made sure that everyone in the research course, which was an elective, would compete for the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, which today is the Intel [Science Talent Search] or whatever it's become.\n\nCARUSO: Yeah, it's a new name.\n\nSTRYER: But it's the same type--\n\nCARUSO: Same program.\n\nSTRYER: --Our high school had quite a record. Along with Bronx High [School] of Science, it was one of the leading producers of winners of that talent search. And so, as part of that, you read Science magazine for a year or two, and you really studied, intensively, quite a few things in science. We had a group of people really preparing for it, and it was wonderful because you acquired a lot of scientific vocabulary. Then you [wrote] a research report, sort of, a mini thesis on what you've done. I ended up with an honorable mention, but it was a fabulous introduction to science. Social sciences and law just receded, and I knew that I wanted to become a scientist.\n\nCARUSO: So, how did this course actually run? Were you given your own lab space? How many students were doing this research component?\n\nSTRYER: There were about fifteen students, and if we had a free hour during the school day, we would come there, and then we'd come after school, and there was always a science teacher there to help, but it was pretty much [that] you had to ask for help. You weren't told what to do. You had to ask for help, and then you would get some help. At one point--maybe that's when I was still working on bacteria--I wrote Selman [A.] Waksman, who had just won the [1952] Nobel Prize [in Physiology or Medicine] and was at Rutgers [The State University of New Jersey]. I was just amazed, he answered the next day, and that was just wonderful, being in contact with a fabulous scientist.\n\n[I recall that] the school library and even the Queens Borough Public Library did not have [the scientific articles] I needed. I remember going to the Columbia University library, where somehow access had been arranged, and I was looking at scientific journals. That was very, very inspiring.\n\nCARUSO: You mentioned that you had some great teachers while you were in high school. Teachers beyond Mr. McSheehy and Brandwein?\n\nSTRYER: Yes, indeed. As I said, an English teacher introduced me to The New Yorker. I remember reading [Alfred, Lord] Tennyson and the line \"The war of Time against the soul of man,\" and that still sticks with me from high school days. I remember my social studies teacher and going over American History, transition periods between isolationism of the United States and internationalism. And we had a social sciences club and we would invite speakers from different consulates [--]. [Forest Hills High] was a very lively place.\n\nCARUSO: So, very broad-based education--\n\nSTRYER: Very broad-based education.\n\nCARUSO: --that allowed you to also go into more depth. It sounds like you had these outside clubs that--\n\nSTRYER: Yes, I had the outside clubs. We would have a mini mock-U.N. session, like at Hunter College [of the City University of New York]. There were a lot of things going on. And best of all was that we had a cohort of students--so, out of the nine hundred students, there was probably a group of about fifty or sixty who were very intellectual, very motivated. They all succeeded superbly. In fact, one year I went to a Gordon Research Conference, and in the evening we sat around, had beer, and at a table--of the ten people at the table, eight had gone to my high school.\n\nCARUSO: Really?\n\nSTRYER: Yes. Amazing.\n\nCARUSO: Just randomly assigned.\n\nSTRYER: Randomly. And here's a meeting that had maybe one hundred and twenty people at the meeting, and my gosh. And so you hear about these kids from Forest Hills High. The chairman of our psychology dependent [at Stanford], Brian [A.] Wandell, is a Forest Hills graduate, and so they keep coming up all over the place.\n\nCARUSO: Outside of this research class, what were your science classes like in high school? Was it just pure lecture/memorization? Did you have a chance to do experimentation in those classes?\n\nSTRYER: We always did experiments. Lab was a very important part, and as I recall, it was pretty decently equipped, and very much in the spirit of inquiry, and the teachers had a very good command of science. [--Our] teachers grew up and started looking for jobs in the Depression Era, and so the New York City School System was fortunate to have attracted these people. Had they grown up in the 1990s, [--] they'd be in start-up companies, or they'd be in major corporate labs, but the New York City School System managed to get these people because they could offer them a secure job and a good environment--a very talented group of people.\n\nCARUSO: Clearly you were interested in science. Was it just always assumed that you'd be going to college? Did you just know that's what you were going to do? Did your family just--?\n\nSTRYER: Oh, yeah, that was--\n\nCARUSO: That was just given.\n\nSTRYER: That was a given, right. It was also clear to me that, because of my parents' financial situation, I would need to get a scholarship. It was very clear that that was absolutely essential.\n\nCARUSO: So, your father's financial situation didn't pick up after--\n\nSTRYER: It took quite a while, after I was in college.\n\nCARUSO: So, that had to be a factor for you, the financial--was it pretty much that you were going to be on your own?\n\nSTRYER: Clearly.\n\nCARUSO: Clearly, okay. When you started to think about college, you have this financial thing in the back of your mind; what were you thinking, in terms of where you wanted to go? And you mentioned science, was there one specific area of science that you wanted to be in? Or was it just, \"I'll go to college and figure out...\"\n\nSTRYER: I was thinking of medicine, basically of medical research. And so, in terms of where you apply, well, it was pretty obvious. You apply to Harvard [University], to Yale [University], to Columbia. I also applied to Cornell [University] because, as a New York resident, that was a place where tuition was--\n\nCARUSO: Right, in-state.\n\nSTRYER: And also, they had some scholarships. And then my guidance counselor said, \"Those are wonderful places, but you should also apply to the University of Chicago. You'd get an outstanding education there, and you might be able to get a very good scholarship there.\" So, I applied there and to Columbia. I applied to five places--For Columbia, I was too young. They chucked out my application because I was just too young. I could apply a year later, but--\n\nCARUSO: You were sixteen?\n\nSTRYER: I was [first] admitted to Cornell, [--and then] to Harvard and Yale, but with financial aid packages that were not ideal, whereas the University of Chicago gave me a full scholarship, essentially covering nearly [everything]--tuition, housing, essentially everything except for incidental expenses and travel. [--That was a] very appealing offer. I would not have to go into debt, and so I went to the University of Chicago.\n\nCARUSO: How did your family feel about you moving to the Midwest? Were they encouraging of it? Was it not--?\n\nSTRYER: Well, they were certainly encouraging because of the financial aspect--they thought it was just wonderful that I had this full support. And then, as they started talking to people who knew something about universities, they found out that the University of Chicago was a very good place.\n\nCARUSO: How was it as a sixteen year old moving from New York out to Chicago [Illinois]?\n\nSTRYER: Well, it was glorious, actually. I remember getting there, and the idea that you did not have to be in a room from 8:30 in the morning to 3:30 in the afternoon--that you actually had time for yourself, you had time to do things, you had time to think--it was just a great liberation. And the idea that you were working on your own--so, I loved it from the very first moment. And the dorm was kind of fun. The first year I lived in a dorm, and then I joined a fraternity. And I had a really terrific time. And once again, I had superb teachers, and I was able to pursue research in the summers.\n\nAnd so, let's see, one summer I worked at the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, and it wasn't original research, but I was in a cytology laboratory that was essentially doing papanicolaou smears diagnostically, but the person who was doing that really had a very good grasp of cell biology and would teach me a lot of cell biology. He would have me looking at [tissues and cells] under the microscope and [gave me an appreciation of] what cancer was all about. And so, that was a terrific experience.\n\nAnd then the subsequent summers, I had research projects. A wonderful one was the year that I was at Argonne National Lab, in the summer, with Douglas [E.] Smith, who was very interested in the area of photodynamic action--that is dyes that sensitize chemical reactions that have destructive consequences. That really got me into the area of what I call light and life, which my research has been centered on. [It] got me interested in excited states of molecules, got me interested in spectroscopy, and launched me on a truly lifelong interest.\n\nCARUSO: When you came into college, did you have--was there a pre-med major at Chicago? Or was there--.?\n\nSTRYER: No, you majored in a discipline. I mean, you would take the courses that were necessary for medical school, but that was just a normal part of taking a very strong science program. I took chemistry, and my chemistry professor was Harold [C.] Urey. But it wasn't just Harold Urey lecturing [--in the chemistry course]. I remember inviting Harold Urey to the dorm [during my freshman year] to speak about the origin of life because he had a student, Stanley [L.] Miller, who had just done [pioneering] electric arc experiments where, from simple molecules they generated [--] amino acids. I thought this was fascinating. [After Urey gave] this wonderful talk, I walked him back to what is now the [James Franck Institute and the Fermi Institute], and he started talking about what interested him beyond the origin of life. He was interested in the abundance of the different atoms. And we're out there on this bitter and cold night, [--] right next to Stagg Field [Stadium] west stands, [the site of the first nuclear] chain reaction, when suddenly he said to me, \"Why don't you come in my office? We shouldn't be standing out here.\" And for the next two hours he continued with his seminar on the origin and abundance of elements. So, I give that as an example of the kind of things that I was exposed to, and there were many others. I had a first-class scientific and--well, much more than a scientific education. The courses in the humanities that I took and social sciences were also really terrific.\n\nCARUSO: And so, when did you start focusing in on one specific discipline to be your overall major at the university? Was that in your freshman year?\n\nSTRYER: Yes, in my freshman year I knew that I would major in the biological sciences. I got my bachelor's degree in physiology [and focused on what was] then called general physiology. We call that molecular physiology today [--]--the interplay of molecules to give rise to physiologic processes, in contrast to a study of the molecules alone. So, it was always in the context of some biological process. That's where I really developed what has been a very long-term interest.\n\nCARUSO: For the science classes that you were taking, again, did they have lab components associated with them?\n\nSTRYER: Yes, very much so. For some of them, they were demonstration labs, but demonstrating really important things. For example, in our introductory biology course, we had a lab on the Hill reaction in photosynthesis, where we showed using redox-sensitive dyes--that when you illuminate the chloroplast, a reduction occurs, and that a primary event in photosynthesis is the generation of reducing power. A very fundamental experiment, a very beautiful experiment, and very exciting to carry out. Rather like the [exhilaration years] earlier, of generating hydrogen and oxygen and hearing the pop when [--] I lit the mixture. There were many of these. Oh, I remember in physics doing the Millikan Oil-Drop Experiment and carrying it out on the same floor that Millikan did it--that's very moving--and to actually measure the charge on an electron. That's pretty good stuff. And so, there were a lot of these very fundamental experiments that were really interesting to carry out.\n\nCARUSO: Was there anything similar to what you had encountered in high school, in terms of not just doing the experiments that had been done, but to take on your own research program? I know you had the summertime programs, but during the--\n\nSTRYER: Yes, very much so. I spent [one of the summers] with Daniel [L.] Harris, who was in the physiology department at the University of Chicago. I was studying glycolysis in intact cells. I had the opportunity of really doing research and being near people who would be working essentially day and night, and what I enjoyed was this community of people. We would go out for a late bite, like, at 11:00 at night, and the camaraderie was very, very good.\n\nCARUSO: [--] What were you doing outside of your classes during college? Did you still do your--were you publishing any of your own papers again?\n\nSTRYER: [laughter] No, the Daily Bugle stopped. They were very intense years intellectually. I belonged to a fraternity, Psi U[psilon], which had the jocks on campus. I think they wanted to raise their grade point average, so they picked up two people. They chose Don [Donald S.] Burnett, who became professor of geology at Caltech [California Institute of Technology], and they acquired me, and we always suspected that it was because of our grade point averages, but we had a good time there and expected to participate [actively in athletics]. I remember going out for intramural track, but it was very dispiriting when I was lapped by one of the leading runners [--] it was not my thing. I would say that the years at the University of Chicago were very intense intellectually, with relatively little in the way of non-science, non-academic activities.\n\nCARUSO: Okay. How did the lab positions--the summer lab positions--come about? Was this something that was suggested to you by advisors? Did you go out and search for these labs?\n\nSTRYER: Both. And I--so, when I took the physiology class, the instructor, Daniel Harris, said, \"Well, Lubert, why don't you think about spending the summer here?\" And so that was very straightforward. The Argonne job, I applied for. I was probably told about it by one of the instructors. And so, the answer is both.\n\nCARUSO: You mentioned that there was a camaraderie, especially with the Harris lab. What was the general lab life like for you during that summer? Was it 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. you were in the lab? Were there many other people in the lab with you? What was the culture of the lab like?\n\nSTRYER: Well, it was a later start, and it was like 10:00 in the morning to midnight, and you'd take time off for coffee or tea. And there'd be a lot of discussion. So, this was about the year that [James D.] Watson and [Francis H.C.] Crick published their paper. I remember having discussions about that, and it was immediately recognized what that was all about and how crucial it was. That was very, very exciting. And oscilloscopes were coming in, replacing smoke drums, and I remember using an oscilloscope and measuring the neuron's potential.\n\nThe lab was not an isolating experience. We were part of a community, and everyone was--there were frustrations, but everyone basically enjoyed what they were doing. They were there because they really loved it. And some were trying to finish their thesis; others were further along. It gave me a sense of what it means to be a scientist, and it was very positive.\n\nCARUSO: There were graduate students? Were there post-docs?\n\nSTRYER: Yes, there were people all along the academic progression.\n\nCARUSO: And did you work much directly with Dr. Harris? Or were you, pretty much, more on your own or under the guidance of a post-doc?\n\nSTRYER: Actually, both. More of the hands on with the equipment was with a post-doc, Henry Tedeschi. Daniel Harris would look the data over, and then we would talk about its broader implications. He was educating me about science in general. I remember getting together in groups of three and four to talk about something [--].\n\nCARUSO: [--] Were you working on multiple projects in that lab, or just one?\n\nSTRYER: Pretty much one, one project.\n\nCARUSO: One. And was that of your own designing, or was that handed down to you?\n\nSTRYER: It was very much suggested by him. That was the year before Argonne. I was beginning to get a sense of how you formulate a proposal, what it takes to pick a good one. I was very much in the learning stage of how you go about designing experiments and picking something that's interesting.\n\nCARUSO: And were you exposed at all to what it meant to be an academic scientist, the politics that might go into running a lab, or having to become a manager of so many different people? Was that something that you were thinking about or that you were actively told about while you were in this position?\n\nSTRYER: That's an interesting question. Let's see. First, in those days being a professor was tantamount to taking a vow of poverty. And it was very clear that the choice, if one were to go into research, one was choosing a distinctly lower economic lifestyle than if one went into medicine. And I remember thinking about this a lot. \"How can I do research,\" which I really enjoy doing, \"but how can I get an M.D.'s salary?\" That was in my mind. It was not yet in my mind what it takes to run a lab, because the lab I was in was relatively small, very personal, and it did not seem very complex as an operation, and one grant funded it. A few years later, I began to see what bigger science was like. That was at Harvard Medical School. And then I began to really see that side. But yes, I was becoming aware of politics and so on. But it struck me it was, sort of, part of the human condition, and that you would have it in any field. What also struck me was that science was a pretty open structure, and that it was something where an immigrant kid could succeed.\n\nCARUSO: So, I'm guessing then, this played an important factor into why you decided to go to med school instead of pursuing a Ph.D.\n\nSTRYER: Yes, and it was that there was almost the assurance of financial security along that path. But also, I was really very interested in helping people, and it was clear to me that if I did medical research in a medical context, that I'd be able to help people and also carry out science. So, I would not say that it was purely an economic decision. It was also that, for someone like me, the medical route was just a culturally more acceptable or conventional route. Being a Jewish kid, medicine is exalted, whereas a Ph.D., what does that mean? And so, the M.D. was, for a number of reasons, the way to go.\n\nCARUSO: And did you at all want to be seeing patients? Or did you just want to be helping people in the sense of doing science that would ultimately--?\n\nSTRYER: Well, initially I thought it'd be interesting to see patients.\n\nCARUSO: So, a researcher who was also--\n\nSTRYER: Yes, some combination. And I actually, because the physiology department was right in the medical school, and it was right at [Albert M.] Billings Hospital, I would see physicians, and I'd see some of them were physician scientists, and so there were some models. For example, [Leon O.] Jacobson was doing his work on erythropoietin. He was a very good hematologist, but he was also opening new vistas in terms of stimulating red cell production. And so, I had some examples of people who were physician scientists.\n\nCARUSO: Was there anyone counseling you against going into an M.D. program?\n\nSTRYER: Yes, the Ph.D.s. [laughter] Yes. They predicted that I would be hopelessly bored in medical school. Daniel Harris predicted that. And their goal was to rescue me from that, but when I decided to go to medical school, they were good sports about it.\n\nCARUSO: They just thought that it was not going to be intellectually interesting to go through an M.D. program?\n\nSTRYER: That's right.\n\nCARUSO: Was there any concern that [--] if you go through an M.D. program, you won't necessarily know how to do science? Doing science is something that's very distinct from doing medicine.\n\nSTRYER: Correct.\n\nCARUSO: Was there any of that at the time?\n\nSTRYER: That feeling? Very definitely. Now, one should say that in Europe many M.D.s--for example, George E. Palade --got their scientific training concurrent with the end of their M.D. period or shortly thereafter. [--Many European scientists] who made major contributions in biochemistry and physiology [had only an M.D. degree]. One could see that tension here in the United States. I already experienced it as an undergraduate. But at that point, there were no M.D./Ph.D. programs. That came later.\n\nCARUSO: Right, okay. And so, there was no temptation for you to do an M.D. and then do a Ph.D. or something along--?\n\nSTRYER: Wasn't thinking that far ahead. That came up a little later.\n\nCARUSO: Okay, so we'll get to that.\n\nSTRYER: Right.\n\nCARUSO: All right. So, you're going through your college career. One advisor lets you know that you can probably graduate a year early. You, I assume, jump on the chance to do so.\n\nSTRYER: I jumped on it because [it shortened the path]. Having been through World War II, having seen my parents dislocated, there's a tremendous feeling that one has to get on with life and make one's place and be successful. I look at the students here at Stanford, and most of them seem pretty relaxed to me and [do not have the kind of drive I had at the same stage]--They're doing wonderful work, and they're going to make major contributions, but that sense of urgency, that \"War of time against the soul of man,\" that was something that was certainly pressing me on. And you hit it right on the mark when you said I just snatched that possibility of just going on to medical school after three years.\n\nCARUSO: So, did you--what medical schools did you decide to apply to, and were there specific reasons?\n\nSTRYER: Well, it's very funny in retrospect because I applied to two medical schools--just two. Today, people apply to thirty, forty, who knows how many? I applied to Harvard, and I applied to the University of Chicago. And the University of Chicago was very keen on having me, but it was Harvard--so I applied, it must have been--\n\nCARUSO: 1956?\n\nSTRYER: So, let me see. I graduated in 1957, so I applied, right, sometime--\n\nCARUSO: Fall of--\n\nSTRYER: In 1956, in the summer. Okay. And the first week of September, a few weeks after I sent in my application, I get a telegram from Harvard admitting me with a scholarship. And Chicago had not yet acted, and they were chagrined. [--] I had wanted to go to Harvard as an undergrad, and so here was a great opportunity and I seized it and, of course, went off to Harvard Medical School.\n\nCARUSO: So, what materials did you submit to them as part of your application to--\n\nSTRYER: I think it was a very simple--things were much simpler in those days. It was a very simple application. I think there was an essay on why I wanted to become a doctor, and a statement of what I've done, and the transcript, a few letters of recommendation, and that was it.\n\nCARUSO: Just the fact that they telegrammed you, admitting you, giving you a scholarship, I was wondering if--maybe it's the letters of recommendation. Do you remember who?\n\nSTRYER: Yes, I had--one came from a physicist, another came from a biologist, and I think a third from a chemist. And that was it.\n\nCARUSO: And so, you didn't want to wait around to hear what the University of Chicago might say?\n\nSTRYER: No, no.\n\nCARUSO: Was it a full scholarship to Harvard or partial?\n\nSTRYER: It was a very [good scholarship] plus a loan. It was a [very] good package. I could have probably gotten a better package at the University of Chicago, but I felt, at this point, that I really wanted to go to Harvard. It was, at that time, a more eminent medical school, and I thought it would also be good to go to a different place for the next stage of my academic life.\n\nCARUSO: You mentioned that you did laboratory work for the three summers. So, I'm guessing at the end of that last summer is when you moved out--\n\nSTRYER: I actually spent--I spent another summer at Argonne National Lab, which was very good.\n\nCARUSO: And so, right after that is when you went to--\n\nSTRYER: September of 1957. Right.\n\nCARUSO: That's when you went out to Boston [Massachusetts]. Nineteen years old, starting medical school--\n\nSTRYER: Right, nineteen years old. Exactly.\n\nCARUSO: --when most people are in their sophomore year of college. Was age an issue when you started medical school? Did you let people know that you were nineteen, or did everyone just assume you were at the same age level? Was it a concern?\n\nSTRYER: Oh, it was clear that I was a young one, and I think patients would react to my youth, some quizzically, some enthusiastically. But it was something I certainly was aware of. And also, I have a funny story in a moment, but it was also an issue at the University of Chicago with my fraternity buddies. There were two bars. One was well lit, and I couldn't go to that one because they would see that I was underage. The other one was very dimly lit, and they didn't check IDs in those days, and there I passed through. So, I was definitely aware of it.\n\nCARUSO: Can you tell me a little bit about what your medical school education was like? Was Harvard co-ed at this point?\n\nSTRYER: Yes. There were five women in the class, and they were a group unto themselves in a sense. I mean, they interacted with us, but they were regarded as strange critters by some of the faculty. It was a very sexist environment. They were a wonderful group. One of them was Tenley [E.] Albright, who was a figure skating champion in the [1956] Olympics, and they were all just terrific people. The class--we had a lot of fun with them. They were funny, and we enjoyed them, and we accepted them, but a lot of the faculty did not, and it was tough going for some of them.\n\nCARUSO: They were clearly treated differently, or was it just--?\n\nSTRYER: Clearly treated differently.\n\nCARUSO: In what ways?\n\nSTRYER: Well, it was said that \"they wouldn't have the stomach to be in the operating room,\" which was absurd because Tenley's dad was a surgeon and she had been exposed to a lot of medicine at home, and it was that \"maybe their place was in the humanities or in the ballet or something like that.\" But it was tough for them. It was a subtle kind of thing sometimes.\n\nCARUSO: Were there any of your classmates that expressed those values? Or was that just a minority?\n\nSTRYER: No, I don't remember any of the classmates expressing that. We were very enthusiastic about [the women in our class], and they were very much a part of the team.\n\nCARUSO: So, what was your medical education like? Was it two years of classes and two years of--\n\nSTRYER: Well, it started off, I would say, dismally. First I left my fiancée, Andrea, in Chicago.\n\nCARUSO: So, you did have some outside activities while you were at the university.\n\nSTRYER: Yes, I--[laughter]. Oh, yes. Yes. Right, right. Yes, I--\n\nCARUSO: Was she an undergraduate there?\n\nSTRYER: She was an undergraduate there. That's right.\n\nCARUSO: Same year or same time frame as you?\n\nSTRYER: Andrea was there at the same time. We met in a group called Orientation Board that helped incoming students learn about the university. So, we were part of the welcoming group [--].\n\nCARUSO: What was she majoring in?\n\nSTRYER: She was majoring in history and then education, and she came from a medical family. Her dad was an internist and lived in Chicago.\n\nCARUSO: All right. So, it started bad?\n\nSTRYER: So, it started off I'm separated from her, I'm generating these huge phone bills, and just as the Ph.D. people predicted, medical school is really boring. And here I am, again, locked up in class from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, very different than college and much more rote learning and very little inquiry, [--] surrounded by very bright people but a really dull [curriculum].\n\nBefore I left the University of Chicago, I had visited several times the home of [Nathan] Goldblatt. His son Stan[ford J. Goldblatt] was a classmate of mine, and we would go to his house, sometimes for fun, sometimes we would study together and prepare for exams. We had an interesting group. One of them was Leon [R.] Kass, who later went into bioethics. And so, Stan's dad [Nathan] owned a department store in Chicago and was a philanthropist and was very interested in medical research. [He] had set up a number of laboratories at the University of Chicago. When he heard that I was going to Harvard, he said, \"If you need any help, you should look up my friend Sidney Farber.\"\n\nSidney Farber was a pioneer in cancer chemotherapy. I remembered that, and so after about six or eight weeks of medical school, I couldn't stand it anymore not doing research [--]. I figured, \"Well, I should talk to Sidney Farber, head of the Children's Cancer Research Foundation.\" I called his secretary and told her that [Nathan] Goldblatt suggested that I call him, and I had an appointment with him that evening. I told him what was troubling me and he said, \"Well, there are two people I want you to talk to.\" One of them was Elkan [R.] Blout, and I saw him, and we hit it off right away. Now, Elkan, at the time, was vice president of Polaroid [Corporation]. He was in charge of their program to develop color film and color instant photography. He had been at Polaroid almost from the start of the company, and had a very close relationship with Edwin [H.] Land, and he was the one who really guided their [chemical] research and some of their development.\n\nBut Elkan had broader interests--he had a laboratory at Harvard Medical School, at Children's Cancer Research Foundation, which in those days was also called The Jimmy Fund [--]. The Jimmy Fund was a fundraising [entity] associated with the [Boston] Red Sox that provided funds for cancer research. [Elkan] had a large lab at Children's Hospital [Boston] that was devoted to synthetic polypeptides. Now, the immediate goal--and what provided a lot of support for the lab--was to use synthetic polypeptides as plasma expanders. The Army was interested in having a material that could be the equivalent of plasma in terms of its osmotic properties. But Elkan's interest was really to learn the secrets of protein structure, to understand the relationship between amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure, conformation. He was interested in making an artificial enzyme. He had this program with maybe fifteen people in it, and he would run that at night, and his day job was Polaroid. This was amazing.\n\n[When Elkan came to the lab in the evening], I had a lot of time with him. It was perfect for my schedule. My day job was as a medical student, and so I would do my research in the evening, and Elkan would come there in the evening, and we had just an incredible group of people there. In addition to Elkan's lab, there was an independent lab that Carolyn Cohen, who's now a professor of biophysics at Brandeis [University], ran on muscle. There was a lot of terrific science in that building. Also in that building were people like John [F.] Enders, who won the [1954] Nobel Prize [in Physiology or Medicine] for his contributions to tissue culture, to getting vaccines and so forth. And so, once I started there, I was very, very happy again. And then, the rest of the medical school day was fine. I would learn lots of useful things.\n\nThat was my start of research as a medical student. I worked on the conformation of polypeptides, and the technique we used was optical rotatory dispersion. We measured optical activity [as a function of wavelength]. For example, when poly-L-glutamate is mostly unionized [at low pH], it's in an alpha helical form. When it's ionized [at higher pH], it goes into a random coil [because of electrostatic repulsion]. We could follow the helix to coil transition as a function of pH and monitor the optical rotatory dispersion and see a large change. That is an example of the kind of [research that was being carried out]. Elkan was very good at synthetic organic chemistry, he developed ways of making copolymers and long polymers.\n\nAnd what I got interested in, as a result of my work with Douglas Smith at Argonne National Laboratory, was dye-binding to proteins and polypeptides. I was interested in dyes because they were the photosensitizers in the photodynamic action that was causing cellular destruction [--]. So, I was very interested in following what the dyes were doing on synthetic polypeptides. Dyes were also of interest because their spectroscopic properties changed on binding to proteins and synthetic polypeptides, and so here was a way of probing molecular interactions. The dyes were in a sense surrogates for substrates or inhibitors.\n\nI started looking at the optical rotatory dispersion of dyes and, very early in my medical school research, discovered that symmetric dyes, acridines for example, become optically active when they are bound to helical polyglutamic acid but not when they're bound to the random coil form. That was very exciting. I spent my medical school research years on conformation of synthetic polypeptides, on induced optical activity, and I learned a lot of spectroscopy. I would go across the river, and while I couldn't take a real course, I would go to some lectures by William E. Moffitt on quantum chemistry. I would go across the river to George Wald's laboratory and talk to him about vision. I really got hooked on spectroscopy.\n\nCARUSO: So, you were doing this, within two to three months of starting your medical education, throughout the entire four years.\n\nSTRYER: Yes, throughout the [four years]. In the second year of medical school, we started seeing patients, and I actually enjoyed that. I really enjoyed the diagnostic puzzle. The third year was very much a clinical year. I had less time in my third year for research, but in the fourth year, the dean's office recognized that my heart was really in research, and so they fashioned [my schedule] so that I could spend about six months of my fourth year full time on research--not quite full time. There was a requirement, for example, that you had to deliver twelve babies and spend a month on obstetrics: but they arranged it so that when a baby was ready for delivery, they would give me a call, and I'd come and deliver the baby. So, they were very, very accommodating. This was before, as I said, before M.D./Ph.D. programs, but they went out of their way to make it possible for me to do as much research as possible.\n\nThe dean of students, Joe [Joseph W.] Gardella, very much wanted me to intern, but I told him that [I wasn't going to]. At some point during medical school, maybe in the third year, I realized that being a good clinician was very demanding and being a really good research scientist was very demanding, and to try to do both would be perhaps impossible. And so I decided that I would forego clinical medicine and devote myself to research entirely. Then I decided it made no sense to take an internship, and Elkan Blout, who was a Ph.D.--a Ph.D. in chemistry--very much reinforced that. The dean's office warned me that I'd be walking the streets if I didn't get an internship, but eventually they agreed to my plan. So, at the start of my fourth year of medical school, I knew that I was going to go into a pure research career.\n\nCARUSO: Looking back on the classes that you were taking in medical school, was there any attempt to incorporate some of the current trends or the new advances in science that were going on? In many ways, you're going to medical school during maybe the tail end of the real revolutionary period in terms of pharmaceutical developments and things like that, but was there an attempt to broaden the medical education to make it more of a scientific investigator type of curriculum, which I've heard some people mention that they had more of during medical school--\n\nSTRYER: Right. Yes, and it depended very much on the instructor, and it depended on the department so that, for example, microbiology and immunology, which was led by Bernard [D.] Davis, had a very modern outlook. When we were learning about the control of bacterial metabolism, we [were exposed] to a lot of modern genetics. In physiology, modern instrumentation was coming in. I still was doing [experiments] on smoke drums, but right around the corner, there were [scientists using new] electrophysiology [equipment]. So, it was coming in, but it had not really made its full impact. I'd say I experienced something between a traditional medical education and the kind of medical education that we offer now [--].\n\nCARUSO: And how did your classmates respond to your interest in research? Were you just the odd man out in that sense? Were there others?\n\nSTRYER: [--] We had a very gifted class. So, in our class, we had John [E.] Dowling, who is a distinguished vision scientist. He's a professor at Harvard. Howard [C.] Berg too is now a professor at Harvard. Howard and John left medical school after two years and went into Ph.D. programs. Howard went into a Ph.D. program in physics and worked on masers, the microwave equivalent of lasers. And John Dowling went to George Wald's lab [--]. I would visit John and get to meet George Wald. And so, they left the class but while I was there, in the first two years, we had a group that was very dedicated to research. [Another gifted classmate was J. Michael] Mike Bishop, who went on to win a [1989] Nobel Prize [in Physiology or Medicine].\n\nThere were [quite a number of] students in our class who, at the time, were doing first-rate research, or who would be doing it and were very receptive to it [--]. It wasn't that I was an oddity [--]. Everyone was very supportive.\n\nCARUSO: Did you have much time for anything else during this?\n\nSTRYER: Well, I got married in the summer after my first year. Here's an amusing story. We got married in Illinois and I was twenty years old--and Andrea was also twenty--and because I was twenty and a male, I needed parental consent. She was twenty and a female and did not need parental consent.\n\nCARUSO: Interesting.\n\nSTRYER: Clearly. We got married early; we celebrated our 50th anniversary a few months ago. Andrea came [to Boston], which made life so much better. But it was very, very intensive. We didn't have much money. We didn't have a car. We would occasionally go to a movie. We would take walks. It was not easy living at all.\n\nCARUSO: You mentioned that she was doing history and education.\n\nSTRYER: She was teaching.\n\nCARUSO: So, she did--\n\nSTRYER: She taught and then she became a librarian.\n\nCARUSO: So, she was--\n\nSTRYER: She was supporting me. She was putting me through medical school. Not quite [in the style to which I would like to become accustomed]--yes, she did a great job of supplementing the scholarship and the loan that I took from Harvard.\n\nCARUSO: Was this the Helen Hay Whitney Research Fellowship?\n\nSTRYER: Ah, the Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship came in my first post-doc full year. So, what happened was that one day Elkan Blout, in my fourth year of medical school, tells me that he's made arrangements for my next two years, and he had spoken to Ed [Edward M.] Purcell, distinguished physicist at Harvard, co-discoverer of nuclear magnetic resonance, [1952] Nobel prize winner [in Physics]. Elkan thought that I needed to strengthen my knowledge of physics and math if I was to do anything worthwhile in research, and that I should go across the river and be tutored by Ed Purcell. Wonderful idea. It actually happened. And then, I'm to go to Cambridge, England, and he's spoken to John [C.] Kendrew, and he's made arrangements for me there. And so, this was a time when, if that's what your mentor tells you--\n\nCARUSO: That's what you did.\n\nSTRYER: Well, that's what you do. It turned out that Elkan chose wonderful mentors and wonderful people, opened up great new worlds for me.\n\nAnd then I got a Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship, which paid, if I remember, about six thousand dollars. So, here I was going from poverty to this sudden splendor. And then, when our first child was born, Michael, we got a five-hundred-dollar bonus, and so that was high living. We lived in Cambridge. We had a nice apartment there. And now, it was, kind of, the feeling that I had back in college. It was totally unstructured. I had all this time, and it was a matter of putting it to good use to learn some physics and to learn some chemistry. I did research. I continued at Children's Hospital and learned some x-ray diffraction in preparation for my year in Cambridge, England, and worked on the fiber diffraction pattern of fibrinogen and fibrin. I continued my interest in spectroscopy with a chemist at Harvard. We were studying the [--] fluorescence properties of porphyrins .\n\nAnd so, in addition to auditing courses on math, I took E. Bright Wilson's course on quantum mechanics and went to a lot of seminars. And then I would have discussions with Ed Purcell, and the shortest discussion was an hour--never less than an hour--and the longest discussion that I remember was about six hours. And there were little projects, little things like he would say to me--he said, \"Well, you're interested in the binding of dyes to polypeptides. Why don't you model it? What are the interactions between the dyes?\" And then he said, \"You really ought to learn some computing.\" The computer center at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] had an early IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] machine, and I got an account there, and so I got into computing. Purcell very much encouraged me to do simulations and just to really get into computing, which was a wonderful thing.\n\nI just had a great time talking to him. I maintained my contacts with Elkan Blout. And it was [--] much more fun living in Cambridge near the Harvard College Observatory than it was living in Boston across from Sears. So, we had a great year in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nCARUSO: What I'd like to do is just find out a little bit more about what lab life was like in Dr. Blout's lab, because one of the things I'm interested in is how different mentors mentor their students and how lab life exists over periods of time. You mentioned you went to med school during the day, you went to lab at night. By your second year, you had your wife with you. When was your son born? That was--\n\nSTRYER: After medical school.\n\nCARUSO: That was after medical school but while you were still in the U.S.?\n\nSTRYER: I was a first-year postdoctoral fellow.\n\nCARUSO: Okay, okay. So, what was your schedule like in the lab, and how did other people respond to you while you were in the lab? I'm assuming there were a lot of other Ph.D. students or post-docs.\n\nSTRYER: There were a lot of post-docs. At the time in Elkan's lab, there were no graduate students. I was his very first student. He ran with staff; his model was very much a corporate model. That is, the kind of thing that he was doing at Polaroid. He replicated that model at Children's but he deviated from it in taking me, for he wasn't looking for students. [--] My guess was that Sidney Farber said, \"Oh, here's a young man that I'd like you to talk to,\" and when that came from Sidney Farber, implicit in it was probably, \"If he seems reasonable, take him.\" But Elkan was delighted that I was interested in dyes--I was telling him about what I was doing with dyes. Now, here at Polaroid, his life was dyes. Also, I knew some spectroscopy, so he right away [reacted positively] to me.\n\nI was different from the others, who were post-docs or research associates with a certain degree of permanence in the lab. And it was run very differently from the lab in the physiology department at the University of Chicago, from Dan Harrison's lab. It wasn't five people; it was fifteen, twenty people. Very focused objectives: \"You're going to make a copolymer of glutamic and serine,\" and, \"You're studying the viscosity,\" and, \"You're doing this or that.\" I had the most freedom, but my research was very, very disciplined. Once I hit some pay dirt, it was very clear what to do. And so, it was much more formal, less exploratory, less free-form, but very, very effective. It was an engine that was really producing things. And Elkan had a series of papers in the JACS [Journal of the American Chemical Society], and it was polypeptides one, two, three, four, a whole succession of papers, and it was a body of work with great coherence and a lot of impact. Elkan was well known. He had a lot of interactions with first-rate chemists. He would play poker with Bob [Robert Burns] Woodward every Tuesday night.\n\nAnd so, [Elkan's lab was] very different from [those I previously encountered]. I would almost say it was the difference between a corporate lab in the case of Elkan, to, kind of, a Bohemian lab in the case of Dan Harris. A different kind of science, but very effective. And occasionally, I would visit Elkan over in Cambridge at Polaroid, and I would see the Polaroid environment, and occasionally I would meet Edwin Land, who was a very imposing figure and quite something to meet [--].\n\nCARUSO: And how much was Dr. Blout involved in your day-to-day research? Was he guiding you through things? Was he just--?\n\nSTRYER: Not day-to-day. I had lots of freedom, and I also had access to him any evening I wanted, and if I had something exciting or something puzzling or something wasn't working, I would go see him, but otherwise, I would not.\n\nAnd there were interesting visitors. We had people, like Ephraim Katchalski from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, who came for a mini-sabbatical. There were a lot of people to talk to and get advice from. It was a very different kind of lab experience and showed me a different aspect. It showed me big science in operation.\n\nCARUSO: Part of the reason I was asking about the relationship is one thing that's very noticeable about your list of publications is that early on you were sole author on papers, which is not something you see, really, today. Being in someone's lab, that person's name is almost always on the paper. But there are some papers that you have that seem to be co-authored with him. So, I was wondering what your role was in those experiments, what his role was in the experiments that you were doing.\n\nSTRYER: The experiments were done with my hands. The conceptual framework of synthetic polypeptides and the study of their conformation, of course [was] Elkan's. The discovery of induced optical activity was mine, but an understanding of what it meant, Elkan played a key role. When I showed him a Cotton effect, where the optical rotatory dispersion, instead of varying monotonically, suddenly goes up, swings down and swings back up--I mean, I had never seen anything like that. The books that I had had no mention of it, and so it was just wonderful sharing that with him and having him help me interpret that. And so, it was very much where my research had tremendous guidance and intellectual input from Elkan.\n\nCARUSO: So, what were the papers that were coauthored? Was he doing some of the hands-on work?\n\nSTRYER: Never. Elkan probably stopped doing hands-on work maybe fifteen years earlier. Now, I remember one evening, though, we actually did an experiment together, but that was very rare. In fact, that was like at 2:00 in the morning. That was something we were very excited about, and his wife was out of town, and so we were working very, very late. But he had a big program. At Polaroid, he was running several hundred people, so he was beyond the point of actually doing things with his own hands, but he was very conversant with what went into each experiment.\n\nCARUSO: Okay. So, how did the paper writing go for those early publications? Was it something you just did, you submitted and got published? Or, did he have any guidance for you or input for you in these papers?\n\nSTRYER: Elkan cared very much about the writing of papers. He made it very clear to his lab that how you write a paper, the clarity was crucial and the same for talks. And what he would emphasize is, \"What are the three main points you want to make?\" And you don't even have to make three; \"What is the point of it all?\" And that everything is subsidiary to the main point or main points. That was very good intellectual training. Now, that was complementary to what I got earlier in the day. One of the things that I really liked about clinical work was the diagnostic puzzle. After you examined the patient, you had two minutes to present to the physician in charge, the attending, the history, the [physical exam] findings, the lab findings, what the differential diagnosis is, and how the patient should be treated until further information is acquired. You had two minutes to do it. And that, I think, is fabulous intellectual training. It forces you to focus and to be concise and to get the essence. And so, that plus Elkan's point about, \"What is the major new thing here?\"--\n\nAgain, he gave tremendous freedom. I would write the first version of the paper, and then I would hand it to Elkan, and he would criticize certain things. He would not rewrite the sentences. He would say, \"This sentence is unclear. I don't see the relationship of this first sentence to the second one. Isn't there a paragraph that's missing here? Isn't there a gap in the logic?\" And he would work very hard also on the right figures. And so, figures had to be very clear, and you also had to tell how you did the experiment. That was a wonderful part of being in Elkan's lab--the papers that came out of his lab were extremely clear.\n\nCARUSO: Before moving on to your time as a post-doc, just one simple question. I think it's a simple question. Were there any women in these scientific labs?\n\nSTRYER: Definitely. First, at Children's Hospital, there was a lab run by Carolyn Cohen. In her lab, there was Susan Lowey. In Elkan's lab, there were several women: Alice [J.] Adler, there was Liz [Elisabeth R.] Simons. So, that was very natural and very comfortable.\n\nCARUSO: Were they researchers in the sense of being post-docs? Were they technicians?\n\nSTRYER: No, Carolyn Cohen was a principal investigator, had her own grant. She was operating very much as a faculty member. Harvard , in those days, kept people in academic slavery [--]. Fritz [Albert] Lipmann, when he won the [1953] Nobel Prize [in Physiology and Medicine], was an instructor in medicine or something like that. So, Carolyn may not have had an exalted title, but de facto, she was running a lab in the full sense of the word.\n\nCARUSO: I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what--you mentioned that the faculty at the medical school had some negative connotations towards the female medical students, and I was wondering if the same, sort of, mentality persisted when it came to more pure sciences, not necessarily medical.\n\nSTRYER: No. That's a very interesting distinction. Certainly not at Children's Cancer Research Foundation. There, women were in positions of responsibility and treated very much as equals.\n\nNow, when I was in the physics department at Harvard, they had a lot of students. They had almost no post-docs. And so, I was in a strange category, and for some reason, I was invited to the faculty luncheons that they had once a week, and there were no women in the physics department at that time, and right now there are a few. So then, George Wald's associate was Ruth Hubbard--he eventually married her--but Ruth was doing outstanding work, some of the groundbreaking work on the photoisomerization of retinal--so, I would say there were many of examples of women doing terrific science.\n\nCARUSO: Prominent positions. And there wasn't a--\n\nSTRYER: Prominent. There was a real distinction between what we saw in the medical school class and what we saw in research.\n\nCARUSO: Okay. You mentioned that your post-doc was--well, your post-doc positions were, sort of, assigned to you--\n\nSTRYER: Assigned.\n\nCARUSO: --by your advisor during medical school. And this was supposed to be a time of learning for you.\n\nSTRYER: Tremendous.\n\nCARUSO: Especially those first two years. You were still doing research in Blout's lab at that time? Or had you moved into--\n\nSTRYER: No, I had [moved out of Elkan's lab]. In my first postdoctoral year, when I was with Ed Purcell, I was doing research in Carolyn Cohen's lab on x-ray diffraction. Elkan felt that I needed to broaden my education. It would have been very convenient for me to continue with him, and it would have been good for his lab, but he put my development first and foremost, and he felt that for my development, I needed to learn x-ray diffraction, x-ray crystallography to broaden my understanding of conformation. And so he made sure that I was working with Carolyn.\n\nCARUSO: So, could you compare the two labs in terms of how things were being organized? You mentioned that Dr. Blout's lab was more of a corporate style. So, what was it like moving into Dr. Cohen's lab and doing--\n\nSTRYER: Dr. Cohen' lab was a fascinating lab because literature was very important as was cutting edge science. [--] It had wonderful people like Andrew [G.] Szent-Györgyi, the nephew of Albert [I.] Szent-Györgyi. Andrew was at Brandeis. He would come over, as would Hugh [E.] Huxley. The very best people on muscle in the world would come there. It was a watering hole for investigators interested in muscle contraction. It was also a very literary lab. There was a lot of discussion of Jane Austen. There was a lot of discussion of [Sidonie-Gabrielle] Colette. So, along with intense science, it had very much a humanistic and artistic component. D'arcy [Wentworth] Thompson's On Growth and Form. They had books lying around, and it wasn't [Linus and Peter] Pauling's Chemistry. The books dealt with science, but [they might be] on symmetry and art, or something like that. And it was a very intellectual place, much more free form, and more similar to Daniel Harris's lab, but with this strong literary component. And again, it was a lot of fun.\n\nAnd a tremendous amount of time was spent [together in intense discussion]--coffee and tea were real rituals. [--] We would typically spend an hour having tea and coffee, and discussion was wide-ranging. It would cover non-scientific topics as well as scientific.\n\nCARUSO: What were your days actually like when in--or what were your post-doc days like in terms of, were you doing 10:00 a.m. to midnight days during that period of time? Were you working more standard hours?\n\nSTRYER: Well, the year in the physics department was totally free-form. So, there were some days that I'd hang around the house and read math. Then there were days that I would go in to the physics department. I had an office there and I would go to either a math course or a quantum mechanics course--I would sit in on at least one lecture a day. But which experiments I was doing, what I was reading, just varied from week to week, and there was a lot of time for discussions. I remember the genetic code was being cracked then, and there was a scientist, a physicist John [R.] Platt, who had been at the University of Chicago. He was a very good polyene spectroscopist. And John was very interested in the genetic code, and we'd talk about the latest experiments and what it all meant [--].\n\nThere was time for lunch at the faculty club, and it was really a dream year. I haven't had that kind of a year until just recently, when going emeritus. I again [--] have that free-form style. [Another change from medical school was] suddenly having six thousand dollars. That was a lot of money in those days. One could live very well. And it was, having a child and all, it was very good and intellectually very intense and very unstructured.\n\nCARUSO: Did you pursue things outside of science? You mentioned that the lab itself had more of an intellectual feel to it and that people were talking about things beyond just scientific experiments. Were you doing things outside of lab? Were you getting into any hobbies? I know you had a child, so that's going to be--\n\nSTRYER: We had a child, right, and we had a play reading group that we'd get together and take some good play and maybe eight or ten of us would read it. That was a lot of fun. It was just fun walking around Cambridge--Cambridge, Mass. and then later Cambridge, England. We had enough money, we were able to go to the theater and to the movies. I did not really have time to really dedicate myself to a hobby. The return to the hobbies came later, but there was time for the arts. There was time to enjoy things and to have a broader life than science.\n\nCARUSO: And did having your child impact or transform your time in the lab in any way? Or was that--I assume your wife stopped working?\n\nSTRYER: She stopped working.\n\nCARUSO: Okay, she became a full-time--\n\nSTRYER: And that made a tremendous difference. Andrea was very supportive of my research. She would sometimes try to get me to calm down a little bit and spend some more time at home. But I was always home for dinner. Sometimes home for lunch, maybe half the time. So, there was time for the family, and there was a lot of time to do good things. That's something I remember from my post-doc years.\n\nShall we take a break?\n\nCARUSO: If you'd like, sure.\n\nSTRYER: Yes, that'd be great.\n\n[END OF AUDIO, FILE 1.1]\n\nCARUSO: So, I'd like to pick up with talking a little bit about your time moving to Dr. Kendrew's lab as, I guess, that's the next sequence. But before actually getting there, one thing that I was curious about. You did have a Nature publication come out of your time in Cohen's lab.\n\nSTRYER: That's right.\n\nCARUSO: Talking to contemporary scientists, they tell me, of course, that Nature, Science, those were the big publications. Was Nature as big, or considered as big at the time.\n\nSTRYER: Nature was very big then. I should say, in those days, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences too was regarded as a choice place to publish.\n\nCARUSO: And that was your second publication.\n\nSTRYER: Right, and it was a great honor to publish [in PNAS]. After all, Pauling published his great papers, many of them, there. [--] Robert Woodward communicated [my paper with Elkan] to PNAS, and that's something that I, of course, cherish.\n\nYes, Nature was [very big the]n. It's very interesting how that paper got into Nature. I wrote the manuscript and sent it to--I was in Cambridge, England at the time--sent it to Carolyn Cohen and Bob [Robert] Langridge, and just before I went on winter holiday, I gave it to John Kendrew to look at for his criticism. John said, \"This looks pretty good. I'll send it to Nature for you.\" [laughter] I get back from a ski holiday in Austria, and the proofs of the paper were on my desk.\n\nCARUSO: Wow.\n\nSTRYER: Okay? Carolyn says, \"No, no. We've got to make some changes.\" And it was different in those days. So, it's an example of where, if you had the right people backing you, things were much simpler; the filter there was John Kendrew.\n\nCARUSO: So, how was it transitioning into his lab, but also how was it transitioning into life in England and life at the MRC [Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology]?\n\nSTRYER: It was a fantastic time at the MRC. The quality of the scientist there was just absolutely amazing, and it was a wonderful time in science. Max [F.] Perutz was the head of the laboratory, and Max was doing his wonderful work on hemoglobin. John was doing the groundbreaking work on myoglobin. The year we were there, John and Max won the [1962] Nobel Prize in Chemistry. [Francis H.C.] Crick was there, and that year [James D.] Watson and Crick won the [1962] Nobel Prize [in Physiology or Medicine]. Fred [Frederick] Sanger was running a laboratory. Aaron Klug, who went on to win a [1982] Nobel Prize [in Chemistry], was running a laboratory.\n\nThere were maybe only thirty-five, forty scientists in the lab, many of whom went on to win Nobel Prizes, all of whom, just about all, distinguished themselves in their careers. And it was just a great time in science, a time of great ferment, discovery. Major discoveries were being made about gene expression. New tools were developed in the structural arena in terms of ways of handling complex protein structures, solving the phase problem. And then we had Sanger developing new sequencing technologies, turning his thoughts from the sequencing of proteins to the sequencing of nucleic acids. It was one of the best times in my scientific career, and it was just a great privilege to be there.\n\nAnd Cambridge, England is a delightful place. We enjoyed the town. We enjoyed the people at the lab. It was a very international group, a very lively group and just a lot of fun people. We went into London [England] frequently, saw some great plays, a wonderful performance of [King] Lear with [David] Paul Scofield, and it was just one of the best years of our lives.\n\nIt was very thrilling, and I had a wonderful time in research. [--] The structure of metmyoglobin was solved by Kendrew by the time I got there. And so now the interest was in solving the structures of the deoxy and oxy forms. I tried very hard to get crystals of oxymyoglobin, but they went over from the ferrous to the ferric form rather quickly. I decided I'd have to work on something in the stable ferric form. The ferric state forms complexes with a variety of ions, such as the azide ion, that gave stable isomorphous crystals. And so, I wanted to see how the azide ion goes in, and I carried out the first difference Fourier synthesis that revealed the binding of a small molecule to a protein. And that project was suggested--the idea of using the phases of the original protein and, as long as the crystal lattice dimensions were the same, using the phases of the native structure to solve the structure of the derivative, that was given to me by John Kendrew. Interestingly, Max Perutz did not think it would work. He thought that there'd be too much noise. So, it was a real thrill [to see the difference Fourier method work]. We had the first indication that it would work around Christmas time with a two-dimensional difference Fourier, and then I solved the three-dimensional structure a few months later. It was just a great year, a wonderful time.\n\nCARUSO: Did the culture of that lab differ at all? Or, in what ways, from the labs that you'd been in the United States--was there a different way of doing science at all?\n\nSTRYER: Yes. Now, let's see. How to categorize it? Well, first it's very English, and that means that what you accomplish in a year is not what counts. What counts is what you do over a longer period. So, this is a laboratory that grew out of the Cavendish Laboratory, with its incredible scientific tradition--the Medical Research Council Laboratory was the continuation of the Medical Research Council unit at the Cavendish Lab, and originally that was run by [William Lawrence] Bragg. And right behind you [here in my office] are the portraits of Perutz and Kendrew drawn by Bragg, and he was a good artist in addition to being a great scientist.\n\nNow, Bragg was still very alive and well, and he ran the Royal Institution [of Great Britain] in London, but he would visit the [MRC Lab in Cambridge]. It's very special to have someone come up and be interested in what you're doing, and where the goal is to transform science to make the major discoveries, to address the most important problems and not to worry about time and to keep working on a problem. And that's what Perutz and Kendrew did with tremendous courage and with great support from Bragg. And this kind of great support will come up again in regard to the Pew, and let me remember to talk about it when I talk about Torsten [N.] Wiesel and Rod [Roderick] MacKinnon. I want to come back to that.\n\nAnd so, there was very much the feeling of choosing an important major problem and just keeping after it, so that was absolutely critical. There was a tremendous amount of discussion at coffee and tea. What was expected was that you would go to coffee and tea twice a day, and then, if you wanted to, you could have lunch at the canteen. But these were times of great scientific discussion, and one would sit not only with the people in the structural group. That was not considered appropriate. You sat where there's the first opening at a table, and Crick or [Sydney] Brenner might be at your right, and Sanger might be at your left. And it was expected that the conversation would not be frivolous, that it would not be about the weather. You were expected to discuss serious science, and a lot of wonderful science was discussed. A lot of experiments were discussed. You learned things way outside your area of expertise, and it was an amazing year.\n\nCARUSO: So, in some ways, breaking down those disciplinary boundaries that might get set up in individual laboratories to provide cross-fertilization for scientific ideas.\n\nSTRYER: Absolutely. Very much so. Very much so. And so, the importance of material science and engineering--I mean, a lot of the reason that the x-ray group succeeded is that they had a rotating anode generator. There were new technologies coming in. They were at the forefront of using computers to process the data. We would process the data at IBM London. We would go in to IBM, which was located in SoHo, and we would bring our pack of cards--punch cards--and we would deliver the job and hopefully did not mis-punch. Once we saw the job was running, we would go off to lunch, talk some science, have a nice ethnic meal in SoHo, come back, pick up our results, and then ponder them on the train back to Cambridge. It was a very enjoyable life.\n\nCARUSO: You mentioned that you were there for about one year.\n\nSTRYER: A little over a year.\n\nCARUSO: During this period of time, based on what you've described to me, you were involved in--not necessarily extremely different, but somewhat different scientific projects from your medical school days to your time at the MRC. Were you developing any sense of an area of science that you wanted to pursue as your career?\n\nSTRYER: [--] I would say that spectroscopy, using light to probe biological macromolecules was very much in my mind, a great interest before I went to Cambridge. Cambridge, it was a very deliberate choice to learn a new technique, a new approach. The commonality is that it was on proteins, and I did not do much thinking about nucleic acids. [I was very involved] in protein structure.\n\nAnd so, what I learned in Elkan's lab about relations between amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure very much carried over to Cambridge. So, with Elkan there were certain rules that glutamic and alanine are helix formers, whereas serine and aspartic are beta sheet-formers, so that I was very interested in the protein folding problem. And so, having the structure of myoglobin and hemoglobin right there in front of you every day, you would think about that. There was a common thread, but there was something very new, as you pointed out.\n\nCARUSO: During this little-over-a-year period, clearly--I'm assuming that Dr. Blout was not telling you where you were going to start your professorship.\n\nSTRYER: No. [laughter]\n\nCARUSO: So, that was a decision you were going to be, sort of, making on your own?\n\nSTRYER: Well, then John Kendrew said, \"Hmm.\" He said, \"I got a letter from Arthur Kornberg, and Arthur wants to know who are the good young people here. Should I put your name in?\" And I said, \"Sure,\" although I had intended to stay longer at the MRC. My fellowship--Helen Hay Whitney fellowship--had two more years going. But he responded to Arthur, and before very long I got an invitation from Arthur to come to Stanford and, essentially, give a job talk. So, once again, it was the mentor, and again, it was the mentor looking out for my interest rather than having someone keep doing research in his laboratory.\n\nCARUSO: Right. It would have benefitted your mentor more to just keep you there and put you to work.\n\nSTRYER: Exactly. Why not? By then I knew some crystallography, so exactly.\n\nCARUSO: Had you heard of Kornberg before this incident? Had you heard--\n\nSTRYER: Yes.\n\nCARUSO: Was Stanford on the map for you for a place you may want to go and do work?\n\nSTRYER: No. It was not, but I had, of course, heard of Kornberg, and the reputation of Stanford at the MRC was very high. Crick and Sidney Brenner thought it was a very good place. Sidney was very funny. He said, \"Well, Arthur's house is high up on the hill, and he can watch you at every moment.\" But Sidney, with whom I still have contact, thought that it'd be worth going there.\n\nCARUSO: So, you flew out just by yourself, or with your family?\n\nSTRYER: I flew out just by myself and visited [--] Arthur and talked to Paul [N.] Berg and talked to others in the department, like Buzz [Robert L.] Baldwin, and was very much taken by the spirit of the department.\n\nAnd when word got out that I was going to visit Stanford, two other institutions invited me to come give talks. Melvin [E.] Calvin invited me to [University of California], Berkeley, and I was invited to the University of Oregon. And within a few weeks, I was offered jobs at all three places, and I decided on Stanford because I really liked--so, Berkeley had a lot of excellent people, but it was kind of vast, and what I liked was the intimacy of Stanford and the fact that Arthur had brought together a group of people who really were working very well together. I recognized that I would be different, in that I'd be almost the first with no expertise or particular interest in nucleic acids, but it was precisely because of that--my interest in structure and proteins--that Arthur brought me into the department. And so, I very soon after that accepted the position.\n\nOnce again it was an example of where you were handed from one mentor to another. I didn't spend a lot of time applying for positions. There was no application. I gave a talk, met with the members of the department, spent a couple days with them, and it was done.\n\nCARUSO: So, you started your position at Stanford in 1963?\n\nSTRYER: That's right, 1963. September of 1963.\n\nCARUSO: Did you have time off in between? Because I thought your fellowship--oh, no, it ended in 1963 at the MRC, so it was pretty much straight from the MRC into Stanford.\n\nSTRYER: Via Italy, which was nice. And it was via Rome [Italy], where there was an international crystallography meeting, and there were maybe fifteen or twenty protein crystallographers there. Essentially, everyone in the world--or nearly so--who was working on protein crystallography was there, and I remember having a farewell dinner in the Piazza Navona, and what we all sensed was that everything was going to be transformed. This was the last time that you'd have a group of people who knew each other, who had grown up together in the field, and now it was so successful that it would just break open, and there would be a multitude, and this, kind of, thing would no longer be possible. So, it was both a moment of triumph led by Kendrew and Perutz, and before that by Bragg, and what has followed--the tremendous harvest that has followed. And I remember being very conscious of that, and then coming to Stanford.\n\nCARUSO: What were your requirements as a new professor at Stanford? Did you just--was it a pure research position? Was it a combined research/teaching position?\n\nSTRYER: No, teaching was very important. Arthur cared very much about teaching. We had a biochemistry course for the medical students. That was a first-class course. We were encouraged to innovate. We were encouraged to pick certain topics that we thought were particularly interesting. And so, I developed a series of lectures on proteins, giving the latest of what was known on protein structure and protein function. Arthur came to every lecture, and he would say what was good, what was not good. And we also would give a graduate level course, so I would have a course on protein structure where we would have some mock data and students learned how to use a computer and to process the data. We recently had a reunion of the biochemistry department, and a number of the people who had taken my course still remembered the examples and the problem sets, and we talked about it a few months ago.\n\nResearch was very important. We had journal clubs that we would rotate and talk about papers that were not our own, and then, of course, we had a lot of time for research, and it was a wonderful environment. But now I was on my own, and this was where I returned to my [interests in light and] life. I did not do protein crystallography in the department. I had ideas about fluorescence energy transfer and the use of fluorescent spectroscopy generally to study protein structure and dynamics that I pursued.\n\nCARUSO: And how was it actually, physically setting up a lab? Were you given just an open-ended budget to equip yourself, equip your lab? How many people, in those early years, did you have in your lab?\n\nSTRYER: So, the way the department worked was that you did not have what was formally your own space. Postdoctoral fellows and students from different labs, different faculty members, might be in the same room. And so, yes, you were given [what was needed]--I had a small office. I had a lab. I had a place to put some more instrumentation. But everything in the department was available for my use. And likewise, my instruments as I developed them became available for use by other members of the department.\n\nThere was no fancy negotiation or discussion about the resources needed to set up a lab. There was no start-up budget. It was just the idea that Arthur would take care of you. Very simple [--]. And he did. And then you'd apply for grants, but you didn't have to wait for grant awards. I was able to hire a technician right away. You could recruit a post-doc right away and graduate students came in through the department, and they selected the labs they wanted to be in. And so, it was right away getting right down to the research on a small and very personal scale. That is, it was where I was really doing things with my own hands for quite a few years and also working closely with post-docs, medical students, and graduate students who did things with their hands [--].\n\n[I recall vividly my first day as a faculty member in late September 1963. That was] a moment of truth. I remember the excitement of walking into the building and also the trepidation. Suddenly the golden post-doc years were over, and now the clock is running, and you have a finite number of years to succeed. And you're now truly on your own, and I remember the sudden feeling, both of exhilaration and of worry, and of pressure, in coming in and walking into the department.\n\nCARUSO: Succeed in terms of--are you talking here about getting tenure? Are you talking about becoming a researcher in your own right? What was it that was--?\n\nSTRYER: Standards in the biochemistry department were very simple. You had to make a major contribution in your field of choice, and the standards were those set by Arthur and Paul Berg and Buzz Baldwin and the others. They're all superb scientists. And again, it was not a feeling that you had to publish a lot of papers. So, after getting to Stanford, within about a year or so, I published a paper on a fluorescent probe that could look at non-polar sites, again using a dye. And the paper was published in a good journal. I wrote the paper and was ready to send it in, and the department administrator, who also [typed manuscripts], said, \"Lubert, you can't send it in until Arthur looks at it, and she was really worried [laughter] that I would do something terrible. And she showed it to Arthur, and Arthur thought it was terrific. He had one or two suggestions. But again, Arthur was looking out for the faculty, and he wanted to make sure that everything that left the department was of very high scientific quality.\n\nThen I collaborated with an investigator who had visited the department, and when I published a paper on that, Arthur said, \"Why did you publish the paper?\" He said, \"There's nothing wrong with that work, but it's not the most important thing.\" [--] What I had published turned out to be correct, but he was right that it did not truly advance science. It's fine for other people to publish stuff like that, but what Arthur wanted was for the people in his department to be publishing papers that really made a difference. It was not publish or perish. It was, rather, to be very careful about what you publish, and that was a wonderful thing. That's great support.\n\nCARUSO: [--] So, you come into your time as a professor. For the first three years, you're doing much of the work, or you're in your lab doing work. You start to take on graduate students and post-docs. How do you envision your role relative to those students? Are you more of a Blout, where you have ideas but the students sit in the lab and do the work themselves? Do you contribute somewhat to that, but you're not necessarily going to be as much at the bench anymore? Or do you want to be at the bench alongside your students and your post-docs? How do you want to participate in your lab?\n\nSTRYER: The answer is very closely, and I was doing experimental work. At that time, I got a joint appointment in chemistry, and I had space over in chemistry. One of my first students was Richard [P.] Haugland--Dick Haugland--and Dick would carry out many of the syntheses over in chemistry where we had a lab, and he would carry out some of the experiments over in biochemistry. And so, when he was doing the synthetic organic chemistry of making new fluorescent probes, I wasn't there, and he was using an expertise that he had that I did not have. He was also drawing upon the wonderful synthetic organic chemists that we had then, and have today, in chemistry at Stanford. I had started the synthesis of oligomers of poly-L-proline, [and then] he was carrying them out. I was right next to him and helping with some of the steps. So, it was very much hands on, very much sha"
