Steitz won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, sharing the honor with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Ada E. Yonath. Steitz has extensively studied the molecular, chemical, and biological mechanisms of proteins and nucleic acids. At his laboratory at Yale, Steitz has mapped the position of hundreds of thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome, paying special attention to understanding how the ribosome is targeted for antibiotics. He has also refined the principles of ribonucleic acid (RNA) folding, stability, and RNA-protein interaction, provided the first detailed structural analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase, and studied the protein structure and mechanism of yeast hexokinase. His wife, Joan Steitz, is a biochemist at Yale, and their son, Jon Steitz, was a minor-league baseball pitcher in the Milwaukee Brewers' farm system.\n\nFather: Arthur Steitz (attorney)\n\nMother: Catherine Brown (homemaker)\n\nBrother: William Steitz (policeman, b. 1941)\n\nWife: Joan Argetsinger (biophysicist, m. 1966, until his death, one son)\n\nSon: Jonathan Glenn Steitz (baseball player, b. 5-Sep-1980)\n\nHigh School: Wauwatosa East High School, Wauwatosa, WI (1958)\n\nUniversity: BA Chemistry, Lawrence University, Appleton, WI (1962)\n\nUniversity: PhD Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Harvard University (1966)\n\nScholar: Biochemistry, Harvard University (1966-67)\n\nScholar: MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK (1967-70)\n\nProfessor: Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University (1970-)\n\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science\n\nAmerican Academy of Microbiology\n\nPfizer Award (American Chemical Society) 1980\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences 1990\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute Investigator (1986-)\n\nNational Academy of Sciences 1996\n\nLewis S.
