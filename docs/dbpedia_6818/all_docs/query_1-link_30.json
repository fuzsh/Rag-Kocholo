        "text": "Dr. Putcha Venkateswarlu\n\nDr. Putcha Venkateswarlu was born in the small village of Dantaloor, India. He did his undergraduate and postgraduate work in physics in India, and his Ph.D. in physics at Banaras Hindu University under Prof. Asundi, a leading spectroscopist of his time. He went on to perform postdoctoral work at various reputable institutions around the world. He joined Alabama A&M Univeristy in 1982 as a professor of physics. During the last 15 years of his life he brought more than $4 million in research grants to AAMU. In his career he supervised over 50 Ph.D. and over 100 M.S. degree students in physics. At AAMU, 10 students obtained Ph.D. and 11 students M.S. degrees under his supervision. He supervised the very first Ph.D. student in physics at AAMU. Alabama A&M physics knew him as the \"Father of Optics Research at AAMU.\" He published over 200 research papers. He worked with three Nobel Prize winners: Prof. Neils Bohr in Copenhagen, Prof. G. Herzberg at NRC in Canada, and Prof. R. S. Mulliken at the University of Chicago.\n\nDr. Putcha Venkateswarlu passed away on August 8, 1997 after a sudden illness. True to his constant dedication, he worked till the last breath of his life.\n\n2023: DR. Stanley Whittingham, 2019 NOBEL LAUREATE IN CHEMISTRY\n\nThe Twentythird Putcha Venkateswarlu Memorial Lecture will be given by Dr. M. Stanley Whittingham from Binghamton University, State University of New York, New York, NY, USA, on Friday, September 15, 2023 at 3:00 PM in the Dawson Hall Auditorium. The title of the talk will be \"50 Years Old: What are the ultimate limits of lithium batteries and how they can lead to a cleaner Fossil-Fuel Free Society\". Presently, he is serving as the Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Materials Science and Engineering at SUNY Binghamton. He won the Nobel prize in Chemistry 2019 for the \"for the development of lithium-ion batteries\".\n\n2011: Wolfgang Ketterle, 2001 Nobel Laureate in Physics\n\nThe Fourteenth Putcha Venkateswarlu Memorial Lecture was given by Dr. Wolfgang Ketterle, John D. MacArthur Professor of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA on Friday November 18th, 2011. The title of the talk was \"When freezing cold is not cold enough - new forms of matter close to absolute zero temperature\". Dr. Ketterle shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics with Eric A. Cornell and Carl E. Wieman for \"the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the condensates\".\n\n2006: Frank Wilczek, 2004 Nobel Laureate in Physics\n\nThe Nineth Putcha Venkateswarlu Annual Memorial Lecture, was be given by Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek, Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), MA, USA, Friday, October 20, 2006. The title of the talk was \"The Universe is a Strange Place.\" Professor Wilczek was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004 for \"for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction.\" He shared the Nobel Prize with David J. Gross from Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California Santa Barbara, CA, USA and H. David Politzer from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, CA, USA."
