        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded on December 10 to Prof. Ada Yonath of the Weizmann Institute of Science. Prof. Yonath is the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the past 45 years, and only the fourth in the prize’s 108-year history. The prize, which was received jointly by Yonath and Profs. Thomas Steitz of Yale University and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan of Cambridge, was awarded “for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome.” This achievement, obtained with advanced research methods developed by Prof. Yonath, will aid, among other things, in the design of new and better antibiotic drugs.\n\nProf. Ada Yonath was born in Jerusalem in 1939. She completed her undergraduate and M.Sc. studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and her doctoral work was carried out at the Weizmann Institute. After completing postdoctoral research in the US, Yonath returned to the Weizmann Institute in the 1970s to join the Faculty of Chemistry. There, she established the first (and for almost a decade the only) biological crystallography laboratory in Israel for solving protein structures. Yonath has received many honors and awards for her work, including the Israel Prize in 2002 and the Wolf Prize in 2007.\n\nProtein factories\n\nIt Takes a Research Team\n\nOn January 26, Prof. Yonath had a chance to celebrate with her research team. The group went to the Druze town of Daliyat al Carmel, near Haifa, for the day. There they received a tour and an explanation of the Druze faith, as well as lunch in one of the town’s fine restaurants\n\nMeeting with Iranians\n\nIn November, just three weeks before the Nobel Prize award ceremony, Prof. Yonath had no time to even think about the upcoming event. She had flown from Boston to the European Synchrotron research facility in Grenoble, France, and then to Ben-Gurion Airport. From there, she flew to Amman, Jordan, where she immediately caught a taxi to the ancient city of Petra or, rather, to the modern hotel next door, for a conference. Though Yonath has had to turn down hundreds of requests for her time since the announcement, this was one she couldn’t say no to: a meeting of researchers working on the SESAME Middle Eastern synchrotron project, based in Jordan. The project, which will only be fully operational in 2013, brings structural biologists from the region, from Egypt to Iran, together to discuss their latest work. After Yonath’s lecture, she was surprised to find the Iranian delegation waiting for her, especially a headscarfed young researcher who only wanted a minute to hug Yonath and tell how much her life story meant to her, an Iranian woman."
