        "meta_description": "Venki Ramakrishnan was born in India to a family of scientists. He had already earned a Ph.D. in physics when his attention turned to molecular biology. As a postdoctoral fellow at Yale, he began his research on the structure and function of the ribosome, a major structure in all cells that interprets genetic instructions to produce proteins.  At first, few appreciated the value of his research. He applied to roughly 50 universities in the United States before he secured his first academic appointment. A move to Cambridge University in 1999 led to major breakthroughs in his research. By 2007, his laboratory had determined the atomic structure of the entire ribosome, discoveries that not only yield insight into protein synthesis but expand our understanding of the antibiotic function.  His research, which has appeared in the journals Nature, Science, and Cell,  brought him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. A group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, he is now serving as President of the Royal Society, the world’s oldest scientific association.",

        "text": "You grew up among scientists, not only your parents, but other scientists visiting your home. How did that influence you?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Well, I have to be honest. I was something of a rebel as a school kid. There were about three or four grades when I just refused to study, even for exams, and was in the bottom third of my class. And my parents were really worried because I had gone from being at the top of my class to the bottom third.\n\nI thought their life was sort of interesting because they would always travel to interesting places, and all these people from America and England and other parts of Europe would come and visit. So I thought, “This is sort of an interesting life,” but I didn’t think that I would actually be a scientist. To some extent, I thought if I went in that direction, I would rather be an engineer. I thought I’d want to be an electronic engineer or something like that.\n\nBut that changed in the last couple of years of high school. Even then, I wanted to be an engineer, but then I didn’t get into the — there are these IITs — a lot of Silicon Valley companies are founded by graduates of the Indian Institutes of Technology. They’re these very elite schools, which take like .5 percent or .1 percent of the applicants. And I didn’t prepare for those exams. So I didn’t really do well and I didn’t make it. But then I got the Indian equivalent of what used to be the Westinghouse and what’s now — I think it’s called Intel — but now it’s something else. Anyway, it’s a national science talent scholarship. But if you took that scholarship, you could only do basic science. You couldn’t do engineering. So that’s when I decided, “Actually, I think I’ll be a scientist.“ To some extent, my mother was behind my taking that exam. She said, “You really should try and do this.”\n\nSo she saw some potential in you?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: I think so. She wasn’t a very demonstrative person. So she would never have told me, “I think you’re going to do great,” or something. But you could tell that she had some confidence, that she expected me to make something of myself. I think that, in itself, is probably enough.\n\nYour father allowed your mom to get a Ph.D. of her own, didn’t he?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Well, it wasn’t that he gave her permission. He’s the one who encouraged her. He said, “You really should go and get a Ph.D.” And then she went off to McGill, where she worked with a very famous group headed by Donald Hebb, who was a very famous psychologist. His theories are still the basis of a lot of modern psychology. Luckily for my dad, his sister came and helped out with taking care of me because he had to go to work and so on. So it worked out.\n\nSo she went to McGill University in Canada while you were still living in India?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Yes, with my dad and my aunt. My aunt came over to help my dad take care of me. I think I was about four years old.\n\nYou also were without parents at an even younger age.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Oh, yeah. I was in South India in a town called Chidambaram. My dad was in Madison, Wisconsin. I still joke that if he had — he was very worried about money, and he thought, “Oh, I can’t afford to take my wife with me,” and so on, “and especially if she’s pregnant and we have a kid. Who’s going to pay for it all?” et cetera. He was very worried about money, so he left my mom with her family in South India and went off to do a postdoc. I felt that if he had taken my mom with him, then I’d have been born in Wisconsin, and I could have become president, but there we are.\n\nYou did okay. What were their fields?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: My dad was a biochemist, and my mom, as you know, went to McGill to get a Ph.D. in psychology, but when she came back, there wasn’t really an opportunity for her. So they decided to team up, and they started looking at the effect of malnutrition on mental retardation and the relationship between malnutrition and mental retardation. So she could use her psychology background to analyze the mental retardation part. And they could also analyze in animal models what was happening in the brain when you starved animals and so on. So it kind of worked out for them, I think.\n\nSo they worked as a team?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: They did work as a team. They published a lot of papers together. I wouldn’t recommend it, actually. I think it can work, but I’m not so sure about it as a model. I think spouses should probably work in different labs. But it’s happened so often. Pierre and Marie Curie, there’s a classic example of a husband and wife team. Even their daughter Irène Joliot‑Curie worked with her husband, and they won the Nobel Prize as well. So it does work in many cases, but I don’t know. I like the idea that my wife is an artist and a children’s book writer, and I come home and I don’t have to talk science all the time.\n\nAnd you can hear about her work.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Yes, I can hear about her work, and we have lots of other interests — music and hiking and movies and things like that. So it gives a certain balance to my life, I think.\n\nYou did make a rather dramatic shift from physics to biology. I gather that you felt physics was a bit slow.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: I thought physics was — I felt I didn’t have the aptitude. Part of it was — this goes back to my telling you about how you have to care about the problem. Part of it is, my thesis problem was something I was not that interested in. I felt like maybe I didn’t have an aptitude. I couldn’t figure out where it was going. So I also feel physics is a very mature field. And it’s really hard to make big breakthroughs in physics — I mean fundamental breakthroughs — whereas, in biology, we’re still making breakthroughs — very, very fundamental questions.\n\nSo that attracted you?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: It did attract me. The other thing was, I knew lots of physicists — Francis Crick or Max Delbrück — had gone into biology from physics and done very well. So I knew it was possible, and that’s why I did it. But the important thing to remember is there are a lot of physicists who go into biology and they never stop being physicists. Everything looks like a physics problem to them, and they end up not doing very interesting work.\n\nThey just talk to each other, and they don’t influence the larger biological community. I think what you should do if you make the transition is to take that critical, analytical, quantitative way of thinking that you get as a physicist, but then become a biologist, learn what it is to be a biologist and what the questions are. Then your physics background might help you in some indirect way, but you can’t just dabble in biology. I think that just doesn’t work.\n\nDoes physics teach you to be patient?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: I think biology does, too. If you have to do a biological experiment, that’s long hours and lots of things. I think all science requires patience.\n\nThere are two scientists who have been very close to our organization named Watson and Crick. Can you explain the impact of what they did?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: I know Jim Watson personally. I met him many times, and we’ve chatted, because both of them did their big breakthrough in my institute, the Medical Research Council Lab. It was actually the ancestor of my institute. I never knew Crick personally, but I saw him at the next table in a faculty club when I was having lunch in UCSD. I had done work that directly related to his ideas about the genetic code and how the ribosome helps to read the genetic code, but I was too shy to go and introduce myself to him. I sort of regret it, but on the other hand, I felt you don’t want to be a pest. These people have — are constantly having people come and interrupt them, and in some ways, I’m glad I didn’t.\n\nI think their work was hugely important because when they began their work, people had just figured out that DNA somehow carries genetic information. Nobody knew how a molecule could have genetic information. What the double helix structure of DNA — and of course, its discovery is very controversial because of data they used from Rosalind Franklin and so on, but despite that, they were brilliant in putting together lots of information.\n\nPart of it came from Rosalind Franklin, part of it came from knowing what the right chemistry was of these bases and then figuring out that these bases can only interact in certain ways, that an A interacts only with T, a C interacts only with G. The point of that was that when they got their structure, they could see in principle how each strand of DNA had the information to make the other strand. That means if you separated the two strands, then each one would make the other one, and then you’d have two copies. And that was the big mystery. How could you get two cells from one cell? Everything had to divide, right? And the information had to divide. And so it was a huge moment.\n\nIt was like centuries —since we were humans, we’ve been wondering how is it that we divide. How is it we give birth to offspring? Why do chickens only give rise to chickens and how does a single cell like an egg grow into a whole organism? These are centuries-old mysteries. Suddenly we started to understand in molecular terms how this all would work. So I would say it was one of the great discoveries. I mean if, at 500 years, most of — sorry to say, but most of the people in this Academy will probably be sort of forgotten — okay, hopefully not, because, with digital media and so on — but something like the discovery of the structure of DNA, that’s one of those things like Darwin’s evolutionary theory, or Mendel’s discovering that there are genes, or the earlier idea that all life is organized as cells coming together. These are very, very fundamental cornerstones that will just be there forever.\n\nTell us about your initial research in the structure of the ribosome.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: When I started, I knew that the ribosome was this very large molecule, and it actually consisted itself of 50 proteins and three long pieces of RNA. No one knew anything about what it looked like, and no one knew anything about even where the proteins were. What were these 50 proteins, and where were they even located?\n\nSo we were using an initial technique called neutron scattering in Peter Moore’s lab. It was a collaboration with Don Engelman at Yale. The idea was to try and find out where these proteins were on the ribosome by trying to measure distances between pairs of proteins, much like a surveyor does in a triangulation that figures out a topological map by measuring lots of distances.\n\nThis was a similar sort of idea. Now, in the end, that didn’t give you the kind of information you needed. What happened, also — since the time I joined the ribosome team, soon afterward, people very quickly realized that the real action in ribosomes was in the RNA part, not so much in the protein part. The proteins were doing something to help the RNA fold and work, et cetera.\n\nThe key functions were done by the RNA. That seemed a much harder problem to tackle. So, many years later, I decided — almost 25 years later — I decided to join a sort of effort about — there was initially only one group working on it, out of Ada Yonath, in Germany and Israel. But then the project was sort of stalled for a while, and I felt that I had a different angle to how to get this structure of the whole molecule, using a technique called x-ray crystallography, where you have to crystallize ribosomes.\n\nThat is, you have to coax all these enormous ribosome molecules to come together into a very regular three-dimensional array, which is what a crystal is.\n\nIt’s essentially a three-dimensional array of molecules. If you’re growing a salt crystal, everybody — every kid — can do it. It’s an elementary school project — or a sugar crystal. But if you’re trying to slice something very large, it’s quite complicated and uncertain. Then, when you have the crystal, to use that crystal to get information about how to get a structure, an atomic structure, of the ribosome. It was non-trivial at the time.\n\nIs there a more favorable environment for this kind of research at Cambridge?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: There is. It has to do with the way science is funded at universities — and that’s true whether it’s England or the U.S. Professors are funded on research grants, and the grants last typically three to five years. So if, at the end of — let’s say, even if you have a five-year grant — more typically you get a four-year grant — but if you have a four- or five-year grant, that means by year three you have to have results because you have to write your renewal applications so the grant continues. If you don’t have results by three years, then you’re in a very precarious position because your grant won’t be renewed, and you’ll run out of money. Your university might tide you over for just a short bit, but then they want you to do something else and so on.\n\nThe lab I went to, which is the same lab where I had done a sabbatical much earlier, is the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and it’s very famous. It won its 16th Nobel Prize just a week ago. The reason it’s so successful is because it specializes in supporting long-term, challenging problems. So you’re never allowed to build a big empire there. They say, “We want you to focus on what’s really important, and for that, you don’t need 30 people. You need to figure out, ‘This is what I want to do,’ and work with a small team and do it.”\n\nSo you don’t get a lot of money. Of course, as I told you, salary compared to the U.S. is not great, but you do have a lot of freedom and a lot of stability. And in my case, I had an additional advantage: it’s the birthplace of crystallography. There were people there who are real experts in crystallography, and this is a bit like — if you’ve ever been on a long expedition in a vehicle — you’d want to take along people who really know about auto mechanics, in case your car breaks down in the middle of the Sahara Desert or something like that, right? So if we’re pushing the limits of what crystallography could do, you want people around who really understand the technique and can help you if there are technical problems. As it turned out, I didn’t really end up needing them, but it’s nice to know they were there if I did need them.\n\nHow did you learn you had won the Nobel Prize?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Well that was interesting. The Nobel Committee will often have meetings where they invite people that they want to take a look at, but they sprinkle them among what I call a lot of decoys. So they’ll have a sort of conference on a general theme, and they’re probably considering three or four people — a few people in that field — but they invite a lot of people in that field. So it becomes a kind of an audition. Between 2000 and 2004, I think I went to Sweden almost every year I was invited. In 2004, there was this big “dog and pony show,” I call it, with all these famous scientists and all kinds of auditioning. And at the banquet at that meeting, this well-known ribosome biochemist from Sweden came and started arguing with me.\n\nHe felt that I hadn’t given him enough credit for work he had done in the ‘70s and ‘80s — late ‘70s and early ‘80s. The reality was we didn’t quite agree with the sort of ideas that they had in the ‘80s. They were good ideas, and some parts were right, but the field, I think, had moved on. Of course, he still doesn’t agree. So we got into this big argument.\n\nThen I found out, a few months later, that he was appointed to the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. So I figured, there’s no way I’m going to get the Nobel Prize. I mean this guy doesn’t agree with me at all about a really important aspect of what we had done, which is why the code is read so accurately by the ribosome. It’s a detail — a real technical detail — but it’s an important detail. So then I just didn’t go to Sweden. I was invited to several meetings, and I think I only went to one, just a small thing where a friend had invited me to give a talk at his institution. But I didn’t go to any conferences in Sweden. I figured, why should I bother?\n\nAnd then, in 2009, when this phone call came along, I was already in a bad mood because on my way to work I had a flat tire, and I had to walk the rest of the way to work, and I was late. So this phone rings and this woman says, “I’m calling from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and it’s a very important call. Could you please hold the line?” And I thought, “Oh, this is just some prank,” because I have a couple of friends who love to play pranks. We often used to joke, “Wouldn’t it be great to have some Swedish person — a postdoc — call some famous scientist and say, ‘Hey, you’ve won the Nobel Prize,’ just as a joke —because it would be kind of a cruel joke, just something you fantasize about.\n\nAnyway, so I thought it was absolutely sure because I was so sure that I would be cut out of it. But what it shows is, this guy had real integrity, that he had his differences about one area, and in a committee, he doesn’t even have to say I’m bad. He could just say, “Oh well, I think Venki’s okay, but I’m not sure,” and that would be enough to sink my chances because at that level unless everybody feels you’re absolutely first‑rate, you don’t get past the filter. So I think it shows real integrity on his part.\n\nThere are a lot of things to complain about with prizes, in general. I’m not a fan of prizes because science is not a sporting competition where you can measure who came first, second, and third. It’s a multidimensional thing. Different people contribute different things. And also, even those who make the breakthroughs depend on lots and lots of other things to make their breakthroughs. It’s an entire community that creates the breakthrough.\n\nSo it’s very much like a team sport. If you have to use a sports analogy, it’s much more like soccer or football than it is like a track — where a team carries a ball and then the final person scores the goal. But who brought the ball all over the field to get it to that point? So I think it’s a bit like that. So I wasn’t a huge fan, but maybe because they have integrity, the Nobel is respected.\n\nSo you’re saying the honor goes to just a small handful of scientists when there are many, many scientists in back of that discovery.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Oh, many. Take me, for example. I could never have done this work myself. Even some of the ideas — because when you’re doing a big project, people say, “Why don’t we try this? Why don’t we try —” you know. Those ideas come from my students and postdocs and so on. Of course, they wouldn’t have done it without my saying, “This is a project. We’ve got to do this; we’ve got to do this,” and saying, “Yes, that’s a good idea; let’s go there.” So I am exercising leadership, but it would never happen by myself.\n\nSo that’s one aspect, but then there are lots and lots of scientists who’ve made important contributions, like the person who figured out — or the two people who figured out — that you should use this compound to get a great signal. They tried it on a different system. And they were Jamie Cate and Jennifer Doudna, and Jennifer Doudna is here today being honored, and she went on to be one of the discoverers of CRISPR-Cas, which is for genome editing. Anyway, they came up with this compound that all of us used. So there’s an example. And Jamie Cate, he’s a brilliant guy, but he didn’t get as much recognition as he might have.\n\nSo I think this is the kind of thing that prizes, in some way, misrepresent science. I would say, what we have to do is think of ourselves as kind of token representatives of science. We’re the lucky ones who got recognized for a large body of knowledge. We are lucky to happen to have made the breakthrough. I also don’t think that it’s very rare that if — so, for example, if I hadn’t made the breakthrough, it would have happened anyway, not even that much later. And I think that’s true of almost every aspect of science.\n\nThink about calculus. For hundreds of years, nobody had calculus. Suddenly, in the same lifetime, Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus. Why do you think that is? I think it’s because the state of knowledge had reached the stage where the next step was calculus, so two people discovered it simultaneously. I think that’s what happens. You get to a point where the next step becomes obvious to a few people, but if those people hadn’t existed, it might have happened a little later and somebody else would have realized it.\n\nBut winning the Nobel Prize must feel pretty good.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Oh, it’s always great to be recognized. And I don’t want to be crass about it, but if you’re an academic in Britain, it’s nice to have a big cash award. I was able to pay off my mortgage. I was able to help my son with his. He’s a cellist, and I bought him a nice cello. So I put the money to good use. The fact that it gives you a kind of credibility, and it shows that your peers thought you’re really a good scientist. I think that all feels good.\n\nWe’ve interviewed a number of Nobel Prize winners for this project. They’re mostly older than you, and their prizes came long after their discovery. You received the Nobel Prize very soon after the discovery, didn’t you?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: I think there are two kinds of prizes in the Nobel. In the first case, if you start a new field, it takes a very long time for people to figure out that, actually, this field is really important. It has its early beginnings. People don’t realize. They think, “Oh, that’s sort of interesting,” but they don’t really realize how important it is, and that might take a very long time. And then you get it 20, 30 years later. The most extreme is Peyton Rous, who showed that viruses can cause cancer. He had to wait, I think, 56 years for his Nobel Prize.\n\nOr the guy who discovered the electron microscope, Ernst Ruska — he invented it just before World War II. I think, after the war, people simply forgot about him and kept on using electron microscopes and forgot that this guy had actually invented it, and he was in his 80s. Fifty-three years later he got the Nobel Prize. So that’s one kind of prize. The other kind is where people know that the goal is very important and it’s a question of having done it, and that’s the case, say, with the structure of DNA or the structure of the ribosome.\n\nSo many of these structural prizes only wait a few years before the Nobel is awarded. In physics, often it will go very quickly — for example, the gravity waves. Of course, it was predicted by Einstein a long time ago, in 1918 or something — 1915. But the fact is that it was only discovered a couple of years ago. But because it was such a fundamental discovery, there was no real doubt about it being prize-worthy.\n\nYou mentioned that this isn’t a sporting competition, but it seems like there was kind of a race, and it does seem to be one motivation in science, to beat the other team.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Oh, there is no question. Humans are a mixture of being competitive and cooperative. We will cooperate in some circumstances and compete in others. If we don’t recognize that, we’re not acknowledging what it means to be human. So science is the same way. Scientists will collaborate — like the gravity wave thing was a huge large-scale collaboration. Everybody — or the Higgs boson — thousands of scientists each had to do their little part to make the whole thing happen. So that’s a great example of cooperation.\n\nBut often, what will happen is, there’s a goal, and people know that if you get there first, you will get the lion’s share of the recognition, and that is a big driving force because of the desire to be recognized and the desire to be acknowledged as first-rate, and so on. It’s human nature. It does lead to kind of strange behavior, too. People in competition will elbow each other metaphorically and try to spin it so that they’ve done the best or the most important part and so on. So it brings out what I think of as a somewhat dark side of human nature as well.\n\nIs there any sense of subterfuge, of trying to hide how close one is?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Oh, definitely. When you’re in a race, you try not to divulge where you are because you don’t want other groups to speed up, and that is part of the unfortunate thing. What I say is, competition is great for science because it makes everybody really work hard and work smart because they have to think hard about what they’re doing because they can’t afford to waste time on bad experiments. So they’re really focused, working around the clock very intelligently. So it’s great for science because it makes science go forward very quickly. But it’s not great for the scientist because it’s so stressful, and it’s stressful for the young people in the lab because they’re worried. If they’re scooped, what happens? And so on. But often, a lot of science is like that, and a lot of science isn’t. Some science, you’re doing something that’s so far out that no one else cares, but you are interested in it. I think that’s the best kind of science to do, where you’re doing something no one else cares about but you really feel is interesting.\n\nCan you talk about the role of creativity in scientific research?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: I think it was Thomas Edison who said, “Science is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.” That’s probably true, but you couldn’t make the breakthrough without that one percent. I think creativity — I see it as simply keeping an open mind and not closing yourself off to ideas and possibilities. If you see a weird result, just think about it. Don’t just sort of dismiss it as, “Oh, that’s a mistake,” because it actually might be telling you something interesting. Or if somebody is working on some other problem or some unrelated thing, take an interest. Because sometimes what he or she is doing might actually be something that might give you that little magic bullet that you were looking for. So I think creativity simply means being really open to new ideas and new possibilities, and then somehow your brain puts it together. And it doesn’t do it necessarily in a conscious way.\n\nI also think it’s very important for people not to be complete workaholics. I think that can kill creativity, and I think in America people work far too hard, especially if they work for the private sector. They’re under the gun all the time, and they’re expected to be on — with these smartphones, you’re on call 24 hours a day, and if you don’t answer your email in five minutes, people think something’s wrong with you. I think that can kill creativity.\n\nYou need long periods of time when you’re doing nothing, just going for a walk or a hike or a bike ride, or going to a concert. I think those are things that we need to have in our lives to foster creativity. I think that’s true for school kids. We shouldn’t be just dumping all this busy work on them so they don’t have time to just play. Play is creativity. That’s where you learn to be creative, in play.\n\nSometimes those discoveries come in surprising ways. The great mathematician Poincaré had a breakthrough from a dream.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Oh, it happens a lot. There was a famous Indian mathematician named Ramanujan about whom they made a movie with Jeremy Irons called The Man Who Knew Infinity. He used to dream up equations. He used to think of all these equations in his dreams, and he’d wake up and write them down. So I think creativity is a very funny business — imagination.\n\nYou’ve spoken out about the need for India to bolster its science education to become competitive again, and about the need to avoid disputes over religion. Could you tell us about that?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: India is going through a critical period. After independence, there was a lot of optimism in India. But then things sort of slowed down, and then the economy was opened up, and it started booming economically, but it also created great inequalities, as often happens when you have free market economies booming. You also generate huge inequalities. India is at a stage now where it isn’t doing as well. It’s not as far along as China in terms of technology, industrialization, manufacturing, science — basic science — whereas 50 years ago, I would say Indian science and India, in general, was better off than China.\n\nIn the meantime, what has also happened is that religious fundamentalist groups have gained much more of a voice and much more power in India. I’m not against people being pious and religious. I have nothing against people of whatever religion they have. But if you have a country like India, which is very heterogeneous — it’s got lots of different religions. There are more Muslims in India than any other country except Pakistan and Indonesia — over 100 million Muslims. So you cannot alienate huge sections of your population. You have to somehow all get along. And if you’re a minority, you also have to make accommodations to living in the broader culture. You also can’t segregate yourself and say, “We’re not going to deal with everybody.”\n\nI think what India needs is for all these groups to say, “Look, you’re you, I’m me. That’s fine, we’ll get along, and let’s go and do what needs to be done.” And what needs to be done is, first of all, you need education. Education is very patchy in India. If you’re poor, your chances of getting educated are really bad. And if you’re well off, you can go to a private school and get educated. And then you need more universities, you need dedicated teachers, you need the kind of education that will prepare them for the manufacturing of tomorrow. So there are lots and lots of things to be done. I think that’s what India needs to focus on and not worry about what I call unproductive squabbles.\n\nThe poor do not get all the educational benefits that the wealthy do in the United States, either. You spent a lot of time in the U.S. Did you see that?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Yes. As you know, I’m an American citizen. I’ve spent more of my life in the U.S. than any other country, and I went there fairly young. So I do regard the U.S. as one of my countries. I would say, when I went to the U.S., what struck me — this was in 1971 — what struck me was what a well‑integrated homogenous country it was. There was a strong middle class. Rich and poor kids would go to the same local school, things like that. I felt that’s what made America great, that you might live in a smaller house in a slightly poorer part of town, but you’d still go to the same high school and you’d have the same teachers. You’d hang out with everybody, you’d do okay, and then, if you were smart, you would rise up.\n\nThat kind of social mobility and social mixing is happening less in America now. People are segregating themselves into rich and poor neighborhoods, different schools, different life experiences. And it’s going to get worse because people like Trump think it’s because of trade, but trade is only a part of it. A lot of it is because manufacturing and the economy are changing. Manufacturing no longer will employ those kinds of numbers of people that it did in the ‘20s and ‘30s and so on, or in the 19th century. And it’s going to be highly automated. Machines are going to do more and more of what humans have been doing. Machines are now doing — they can read radiographs. If you have an x‑ray, they can read your x-ray as well as many radiologists and better than most radiologists.\n\nSo we have a situation where machines are going to do more and more of what humans traditionally have been doing. And this is leading to a hollowing out of the middle class. And so you have the one percent on one side who are benefitting from all this because it’s making everything cheaper for them. And since they’re very innovative and highly skilled, they’re okay. And then you have the middle class. There are no middle-class jobs. They’re disappearing, so they’re going to do the low-end jobs. And this is not a good recipe for society. And we have the same problem in Britain.\n\nWe need to think about, how do we educate our population to prepare them for this new kind of world where they can still be productive? It’s not an easy problem. It’s an unsolved problem. But if we don’t start thinking now, we could have a big social revolution on our hands. I think the recent elections — the election in the U.S. and even the Brexit referendum here — are symptomatic of a much deeper problem.\n\nWhat is your next objective in science?\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan: Well, I’m sort of lucky in that the ribosome is so complex. For example, human ribosomes are far more complex than bacterial ribosomes. We also have mitochondria, which have their own kind of ribosome, which are totally different from bacteria or humans. And human ribosomes are also highly regulated. So, for example, what turns them on and off is very different than in bacteria.\n\nThere’s lots of things, like quality control and turning on ribosomes just when you need them, like in nerve cells and so on. So there’s lots and lots of work to do. And how viruses hijack ribosomes so that the ribosomes only translate viral genes to make viral proteins and shut down, in the host, our own translation.\n\nSo these are all interesting questions. Often, what happens in science is you got a problem and you solve it, and then there’s not much else to do and you have to move on. But the ribosome turned out to be a rather rich gold mine. Perhaps I’m a little intellectually lazy and feel like, “Why should I bother thinking about something else?”\n\nMaybe at some point, I should have thought, “I should do something different.” But now, I’m in my 60s, and I think it takes five years to learn a new field and another five years to be really good at it. I sense that, if I have ten years, I could spend ten years doing some interesting work on the ribosome where my lab is very well set up to do it, or I could go off and maybe just start doing things, and then I’d have to quit!"
