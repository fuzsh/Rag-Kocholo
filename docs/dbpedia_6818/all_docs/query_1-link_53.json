        "text": "Note: Quotations attributed to Sidney Altman himself (in italics) are drawn from his articles, emails, and unpublished memoir.\n\nThe human stories that undergird major scientific advances are dissimilar tapestries, each showcasing a different interweaving of individual values, research mentors, environments, and serendipity. The life of Sidney (Sid) Altman is no exception. From modest beginnings, he embarked on a challenging and exciting odyssey that now is an important chapter in the history of modern biology. His discovery of a catalytic role for RNA, a finding also made independently by Tom Cech, upended the longstanding view that the ability to accelerate chemical reactions is the sole realm of proteins. Through their landmark findings, Altman and Cech inspired the identification of unexpected and novel roles for RNAs (beyond their role as information carriers) and the pursuit of RNAs as tools, drug targets, and drugs/vaccines.\n\nEarly life: Sid was born in Montreal, Canada, in May 1939, to Jewish émigré parents. Almost 20 years before Sid's birth, both his parents had migrated to Canada: his mother Ray Arlin from Białystok, Poland, and his father Victor Altman from Chornyi Ostriv, Ukraine. Ray, one of eleven children born to a Talmudic scholar and a homemaker, worked initially in a textile mill in Montreal. Victor, a penniless immigrant, spent long days as a laborer on a collective farm in Ontario, a requirement imposed by the Jewish agency that sponsored his immigration to Canada. In 1930, Victor soon had his own grocery store in Montreal's west end district of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and had married Ray. Sid's father worked very hard to support his family and to save for his children's education. His parents’ efforts left Sid with an enduring conviction in the importance of hard work, a belief that he unfailingly emphasized to those who sought his counsel. “It was from [my parents] that I learned that hard work in stable surroundings could yield rewards, even if only in infinitesimally small increments.”\n\nEven though neither of them had completed high school, Victor and Ray placed a high value on the education of their two sons (Sid was predeceased by an older brother, Marvin). At home, they drew from three cultures and languages (Yiddish, Russian, and English) as sources of parental advice. For his formal K-12 education, they sent Sid to Montreal public schools. To ensure his fluency and pronunciation in French, his parents arranged for a special tutor (Madame Gendron, for whom Sid retained a lifelong affection) to supplement the French classes at school. Sid greatly enjoyed these private lessons since the discussions of France and French culture were quite unlike those in his school textbooks. He also attended Hebrew school on Sundays, winning book prizes that he retained for his entire life. Sid could sight-read music and play the piano, having been trained by a sequence of tutors, many of whom were post-World War II refugees that his parents wanted to support. He maintained a lifelong interest in classical music, with Mozart's clarinet concerto (K.622) being a strong favorite.\n\nHigher education and research career: In May 1960, Sid received a BS from MIT, with a major in physics. He had worked with Lee Grodzins, a new faculty member, to obtain experimental support for the nonconservation of parity. Sid's undergraduate research thesis, which was dedicated to his parents, showed that electrons decaying from 90Sr are polarized and that there is asymmetry in the number of electrons emitted, relative to the direction of the spin (more electrons were observed opposite the direction of the spin). Sid attributed this rewarding bench experience to Grodzins’ approach: He would propose a problem and wait for Sid's solution before stepping in with advice. Sid cherished this training philosophy and always acknowledged his debt to Grodzins, who guided his first foray into research.\n\nSid joined the doctoral program in physics at Columbia but left when he was unable to find an advisor. By his own account, he quit before he would have been expelled! He then enrolled as a summer student at the University of Colorado in Boulder, where a chance encounter with George Gamow, a famous physicist and Russian émigré, led Sid to consider the graduate program in Biophysics at the University of Colorado Medical School in Denver.\n\nSid was soon engaged in his doctoral research in Denver with Leonard Lerman (who was, incidentally, born in the United States to Jewish immigrants from Ukraine). Lerman had recently returned from the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB) in Cambridge, England, having completed a sabbatical with Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick. Lerman had generated mutations in DNA using acridine dyes, whose planar structures enable their intercalation with DNA. For his doctoral dissertation, Sid examined the effects of 9-aminoacridine on replication of the bacteriophage T4 and identified distinct effects on both the replication and the packaging of DNA. During his years in the Lerman laboratory, Sid taught himself molecular biology and sharpened his independent research skills. A tribute to Lerman by Sid and Tom Maniatis (another of Lerman's doctoral students), includes the following paragraph: “[Lerman] demanded rigorous and independent thinking, and a thorough grasp of scientific principles. In some ways, his method of teaching was Socratic, as the questions we asked were usually answered by another question, which probed our depth of understanding and thinking. A discussion of how we might attack the problem at hand would follow, usually leading to his comment that ‘You decide!’ While this approach could sometimes lead to despair, on many occasions it resulted in the conception of an independent study, a new direction …”\n\nLerman moved to Vanderbilt and Sid accompanied him to complete his research project. Then, at a conference in Tennessee, Sid met Matt Meselson and landed his first postdoctoral position in Meselson's laboratory at Harvard. Meselson told Sid that he would need to find his own funding and, with a strong recommendation from Lerman, Sid was awarded a Damon Runyon Fellowship. At Harvard, Sid demonstrated that expression of a previously unidentified endonuclease was induced in T4-infected Escherichia coli, with resultant single-strand breaks in the bacteriophage DNA. Sid's heart was, however, somewhere else entirely—not in Cambridge, Massachusetts but in Cambridge, England. Since the early 1960s, when he had first read Sydney Brenner's pioneering work on RNA, Sid had aspired to work with him, a sentiment amplified severalfold after listening to a spectacular lecture by Brenner. Toward the end of his postdoctoral appointment at Harvard, Sid met Brenner in Boston and was excited to be offered an opportunity, at the LMB in Cambridge, to use NMR to study the structure of tRNA. Sid was delighted because, previously, Brenner had told him that there was no available bench space at the LMB. Sid would later remark that his sojourn at the LMB was a fabulous time when he got to observe at close quarters the penetrating intelligence of an amazing group of scientists (including Fred Sanger).\n\nBy the time Sid arrived at the LMB as an Anna Fuller Fund fellow, in October 1969, advances in tRNA crystallization had rendered moot any NMR-based approach to the determination of the structure of tRNA. So, when Brenner and Francis Crick asked Sid to come up with a different research plan, he proposed the isolation of acridine-induced mutants of tRNATyr. Sid's treatment of E. coli with a potent acridine half-mustard compound led to the identification of a mutant tRNA that was much longer than any mature tRNA. He purified the radiolabeled tRNATyr precursor and determined its nucleotide sequence.\n\nWhile we now appreciate that many mature RNAs are first produced as longer precursors, Sid's early findings spawned numerous studies of bacterial RNA processing. Because the mutant tRNA contained more nucleotide residues than the mature tRNA, Sid reasoned that it was probably a precursor that could not be processed by the ribonucleases normally involved in 5′ and 3′ trimming. With the help of Hugh Robertson, who was also a postdoctoral fellow at the LMB and who, along with William (Bill) McClain, would become a close friend, the enzymatic activity responsible for releasing the 5′ leader was isolated from E. coli. The enzyme was named RNase P (with P referring to precursor). In their 1971 JBC paper, Sid and Hugh noted that there was a large amount of UV-absorbing material in the peak fractions. A forerunner of what was to come!\n\nSid's work at the LMB led to his appointment as an Assistant Professor at Yale University, where his biochemical characterization of bacterial RNase P began in earnest. To the intense frustration of those involved in these efforts, a pesky, copurifying RNA appeared in all the fractions with RNase P activity. Sid tasked Ben Stark, a meticulous graduate student, to get rid of the RNA and focus on the protein responsible for the processing of the pre-tRNA. Ben's painstaking experiments convinced his skeptical advisor of the inescapable requirement for RNA in the cleavage activity of RNase P (a ribonucleoprotein). When Sid was granted tenure in 1977, he wrote to Sydney Brenner thanking him for his support and acknowledging his memorable stay at the LMB. He ended the letter with “You may be interested to know that RNase P has an RNA moiety, i.e., at least one or possibly two discrete RNA species are essential for the function of the enzyme.”\n\nThe 1978 PNAS paper, in which Sid and his coworkers posited that the RNA in RNase P might be playing a supporting role in the catalytic activity of RNase P, was very different from the 1983 Cell paper, in which the RNA moiety was demonstrated to be the catalytic subunit of RNase P! Within five short years, there was a sea change. The first signs in this difficult journey came from the painstaking biochemical studies performed by Ryszard Kole, a Polish postdoctoral fellow in Sid's laboratory. By separating the RNA from the protein component of E. coli RNase P, Ryszard showed that the protein (contrary to dogma) lacked pre-tRNA cleavage activity, but the combination of the RNA and the protein resulted in activity. This finding led Kole and Altman to state in their 1981 Biochemistry paper, “The possibility that the [RNase P] RNA molecule participates in the formation of an active site of an enzyme appears novel.” Subsequently, in the fall of 1983, during reconstitution of the respective RNA and protein subunits of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis RNase P (in collaboration with Norman Pace's laboratory), Cecilia Guerrier-Takada, an exceptional postdoctoral scientist in Sid's laboratory, found that each RNA subunit by itself had catalytic activity in the presence of 60 mM Mg2+, a condition that had not previously been tested! Soon afterwards (Guerrier-Takada and Altman 1984), Cecilia showed that the E. coli RNase P RNA, synthesized by in vitro transcription, could catalyze the cleavage reaction, firmly ruling out any possibility that contaminating protein(s) might have been responsible for cleavage activity. These experiments were only possible because the gene for the RNA had been cloned and sequenced, a notable accomplishment in the early 1980s by Robin Reed, a graduate student in the Altman laboratory.\n\nSid was willing to challenge accepted dogma, albeit very cautiously. However, he had tremendous difficulty in convincing others of his discovery. Tom Cech's independent discovery of the self-splicing group I intron of Tetrahymena helped decisively to turn the tide in their collective favor. Sid always felt that the scientific community had shown its best and worst sides during this trying period. He gained much from the support of his family, colleagues, and mentors. Sid recounted a conversation with Matt Meselson in which he shared his uphill battles with the doubters. Meselson's response was, “If you have done your experiments correctly and you believe in your results, then you have no choice but to trust what nature is telling you. Sooner or later, the truth will be apparent.” These remarks boosted Sid during some of his darkest hours. While time tends to soften the rough edges of all human engagements, Sid felt, even during his later years, that he had not been treated fairly in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nDuring his career, Sid made more than a few serendipitous choices that endowed him with expertise that paid handsome dividends later. For example, the chance meeting with Gamow that led to Lerman and the abiding interest in acridines, which indirectly paved the way to his work on RNase P. However, there was nothing fortuitous about the discovery of RNA as the catalytic component of RNase P. Sid and his coworkers were tenacious and single-minded experimentalists who drilled deep to uncover one of Mother Nature's fascinating secrets. The independent advances made by Tom Cech and his team were equally impressive. Sid and Tom Cech, joined soon by many other investigators, began to unravel the biochemistry of RNA catalysis. RNA enzymes were found to be not so different from proteinaceous enzymes insofar as they are modular, they exploit acid-base chemistry and metal ions, and both exploit a number of weak interactions to promote formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. This was the dawn of a new era in biocatalysis!\n\nAdvising: “I am forever grateful to my mentors during my career. Perhaps, I was able to repay that enduring gift with my postdocs and students.” It is true that the apple does not fall far from the tree and this adage applies to scientific progeny as much as to parents and children. I have many scientific siblings from Sid's laboratory at Yale University (51 were postdoctoral fellows, 15 were doctoral students, and 22 were undergraduate trainees). Some of my “siblings” have contributed their rich and varied perspectives to this volume. Adding to their contributions, here are some of Sid's attributes that, I believe, were universally appreciated: a strong work ethic, integrity, intellectual curiosity, and inclusiveness. He was a positive role model and his norms were embraced by his trainees and colleagues.\n\nSid believed that scholarship was fruitful when accompanied by perseverance and hard work. “It could be a letter carrier, it could be a sales manager in a store or a university professor, all the people who do well work very hard. Nobody who has a record of achievement has been lazy about it.” Moreover, he felt that difficult problems were solved only by obsessive effort. “It is the intense mental preoccupation with a problem that is a major factor: seeing it from every conceivable point of view; examining options for solutions and choosing among them. This scrutiny must encompass every detail, winnowing out those that can lead to complex, fruitless pursuits.” These traits, when complemented by sincerity of purpose, ensured rigor and quality in all his pursuits.\n\nFor Sid, integrity meant incorruptibility of the scientific enterprise. He chose to be a scientist because he believed that research endeavors were completely objective (see article by Julius Lucks and Venkat Gopalan in this tribute). Sid was cautious by nature but also open-minded. One might argue that Sid was initially resistant to his students’ ideas (e.g., a catalytic role for RNA, see article by Ben Stark), but he always looked for a chain of reasonable inferences that was based on strong experimental evidence. He was averse to any overstatement. While his conservative approach did, at times, dilute the importance of some claims, Sid despised showboating above all. In fact, as I know only too well, he swiftly consigned to the garbage can any expansive and speculative sentences in the Discussion sections of a manuscript draft.\n\nSid was a true scholar who read broadly and was an excellent writer. His interests spanned art, music, and history. He would surprise me with emails that included specific inquiries (e.g., a question about the Brahmo Samaj movement in India in the early 1800s) or descriptions of the inadequacy of a museum exhibit on British India that failed to convey the mores and lives of the locals. He had a keen eye for detail and could converse on varied topics in many fields. It was stimulating to be in his company. As Dean of Yale College in the mid-1980s, Sid provided stewardship during the revision of the undergraduate curriculum, ensuring that science majors would gain an appreciation of the arts and humanities and, reciprocally, that non-scientists would recognize the value of science.\n\nEvery research team grows naturally, but hidden beacons often guide the leader in the development of her/his group. Sid showed, by example, how to implement an inclusive culture that thrived on intellectual ferment. In this regard, two factors might have influenced him. First and foremost, Sid's time at the LMB with Sydney Brenner showed him that dedication to research was a paramount requirement. Gender, age, nationality, and any other classification were unimportant. Reflecting his experiences at the LMB, he valued the opinions and initiatives of all those who worked with him. Over a 40-year period, his laboratory had many female scientists and technicians and Sid had the highest respect for all of them and their contributions (in particular, Dr. Cecilia Guerrier-Takada; see photo, left). Second, he never forgot that his parents had been poor immigrants to Canada, a country that offered them opportunities for growth and enrichment in a stable and safe environment. Thus, he had a particularly soft spot for immigrants (see photo, right). Foreigners typically outnumbered US citizens in his group. On the occasion of his 70th birthday, some international alumni (myself included) dedicated some review articles on RNase P to Sid. He responded: “I am personally grateful to you for the friendship… You represent six different countries. For me, there is no greater satisfaction from my professional life than to have done a little bit in helping you progress from your homes around the globe to the respected positions that you have now. From one immigrant to the others, thank you.”\n\nIndividuality: The superficial appraisal of any public (or private) figure is invariably misleading because the paradoxes in all our personalities are either ignored or glossed over. Sid was viewed by some as overbearing and impatient. Such characterizations are incorrect.\n\nUnwelcome labels prompted by Sid's bluntness and independence overlook the primacy that he placed on honesty and adherence to principles. Nuances were few and far between. However, he never indulged in self-importance and did not like others to fuss over him. He acknowledged his own failings with great humility (see Sid's letter in Ben Stark's article in this tribute). In fact, Sid's unmistakable wit was most apparent when he was self-deprecatory. For example, motivated by his desire to be an author in his late teens, he boldly approached the Arts and Book review editor of the Montreal Star expressing his interest in writing for the newspaper. When Sid returned with a sample book review that the editor had requested, the editor advised, “If you have a talent for science, stick to it while you are young.” Sid concluded that the editor “was very perceptive, or very wise, or very diplomatic, or all three”! Another example of Sid's self-deprecatory wit is obvious from his description of how Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick responded to his idea of studying acridine-induced mutants of tRNAs. Upon sensing their ennui after hearing his idea, Sid wrote that he “distinctly felt that if they spoke to me again, it would be an accident.”\n\nSid was impatient with anyone who he felt impeded the research that he held dear, but his vast reserves of patience were amply evident when he waited (even for years!) for the completion of difficult research objectives. Recognizing that “work on RNase P was usually a three- to four-year period of boredom and fright,” he was quite tolerant of research excursions from which nothing of any apparent significance emerged.\n\nSid was a private person, and he was often brusque. It was easy to conclude, from his façade, that Sid was distant. However, such a conclusion is at odds with his devoted friendship to those who knew him well. Whether it was sending a beautiful bouquet on my wedding day, a thoughtful greeting on my first Father's Day, or a poignant condolence note on my loss of a close family member, he consistently showed uncommon grace and caring. Such warmth and goodwill endure.\n\nSid was never aloof. To the contrary, he acted swiftly when he identified a good reason for doing so. His strong convictions shaped his public stance on many issues. For example, Sid was one of the signatories supporting the Precision Agriculture (GMO) Campaign, largely because he believed that biotechnology could enhance food security and help eliminate poverty. Also, he was a cosignatory, with many other leading scientists, in condemning the international boycott of Israeli academics. He was a vocal proponent of academic and scientific freedom.\n\nEnvoi: Numerous trainees and a legion of close friends and colleagues had the privilege of working with Sid. While some of their voices in this tribute are merely a whisper from this shared past, they provide a compelling and collective narrative for those who did not know Sid, and they reveal a portrait of the man as an exemplary scientist, conscientious teacher, and loyal friend. Varied facets of Sid's personality emerge under these different lenses, each tempered by deep reflection over time. An inescapable conclusion from these wide-ranging personal remembrances is that Sid had a profound influence on all the lives he touched. By evoking memories that celebrate the richness of Sid's life, the following essays—including some by those who knew him personally or professionally for nearly half a century—show why his legacy will live forever.\n\nNot marble nor the gilded monuments\n\nOf princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,\n\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\n\nThan unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.\n\nWhen wasteful war shall statues overturn,\n\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\n\nNor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn\n\nThe living record of your memory.\n\n‘Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity\n\nShall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room\n\nEven in the eyes of all posterity\n\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom.\n\n(Shakespeare, Sonnet 55)\n\nThe story starts in 1973. In the fall of 1972 (my second year as a graduate student in the Biology Department at Yale), I had joined Sid Altman's laboratory and in my first semester I had worked on a small project with tRNA precursors that was modestly successful. In 1973, I began my main thesis project to purify to homogeneity RNase P from Escherichia coli (the organism in which Sid and his early collaborators had first found it) and characterize it. At that time, this undertaking was a fairly typical and reasonable project in molecular biology, although in this instance made challenging by the cumbersome nature of the RNase P assay. This assay required a polyacrylamide gel and a particular tRNA precursor that I had to make about each month from an in vivo labeling with large amounts of P-32. Nevertheless, this part of the project moved along pretty well. More demanding was the purification itself. In retrospect, of course, it is easy to see why it was so difficult. I was using standard procedures to purify a protein enzyme, when in fact I was purifying an enzyme that is, by mass, ∼90% RNA and ∼10% protein.\n\nBy scaling up the purification procedure, I was able to prepare large quantities of partially purified enzyme. However, additional ion-exchange chromatographic steps did not purify the enzyme further, because RNase P and the contaminants had roughly the same (negative) charge. So, I explored alternative purification steps and decided on preparative electrophoresis using “native” gels, despite the poor yield from this extremely tedious approach. Consequently, when the RNase P-containing fractions from the native gel elution were assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (remember, I was still looking for a protein), I often noticed very faint bands or nothing at all.\n\nAt this time Paolo Arcari, a postdoctoral fellow in Sid's laboratory (see photo of Sid's group in 1974), was using methylene blue to stain RNA in PAGE gels. Reasoning that negatively charged proteins in my peak fractions may not be binding Coomassie blue, I began in January 1975 to take SDS-polyacrylamide gels that had been stained with Coomassie and “overstain” them with methylene blue. When these overstained gels were destained, there were several new bands including two prominent bands in the gels which contained the peak activity fractions from the native gel purification step. Two of these were called M1 and M2 (I termed them as such in May-June 1975). Likewise, the Coomassie-stained bands in the same fraction were denoted C1–C6. In the cleanest RNase P preparations, there were only C5 and M1 and M2 in the peak fraction (see Fig. 1B,C of the 1978 paper in PNAS [Stark et al. 1978]). As it turned out, these components are the components of native RNase P. C5 is the protein component and M1 and M2 are the RNA components; M1 has been extensively studied and since shown to be the catalytic part of the enzyme while the function of M2 is still unknown.\n\nInitially, I thought M1 and M2 really were proteins. It fit well with the ideas I had at that time because M1 and M2 (if they had been proteins) were measured on my gels with molecular weights of about 60,000 and 70,000 Da, respectively (their actual sizes are larger because RNA and protein molecules do not run the same in this gel system). A tetramer of two copies of M1 and two copies of M2 would have had a molecular weight of 260,000 Da, almost exactly what I had measured for native RNase P by gel filtration in other experiments. It would also parallel the “alpha 2-beta 2 structure” known to exist for many tRNA synthetases, enzymes which akin to RNase P interact with tRNAs.\n\nOf course, it was a formal possibility that M1 and M2 were RNAs, but for a long time the simplicity of the idea that they were proteins and the model described above overruled my common sense. It would have been very easy to determine whether M1 and M2 were RNAs or proteins, but I waited a long time to test this (see below). In fact, I was so sure of the idea that methylene blue could stain certain (acidic) proteins that I even tested this with T1 ribonuclease (a very acidic protein). Methylene blue staining of T1 ribonuclease on SDS gels, however, was poor. I should have seen the weakness in my argument right away, but I did not.\n\nA few months later (fall 1975), I was talking with Skip Binder (another graduate student in our department) about whether M1 and M2 might be RNAs. He suggested that I just go ahead and test my idea directly. It was actually a very easy experiment. It entailed treating native gel-purified RNase P fractions with ribonuclease before running the samples on SDS gels to determine if M1 and M2 disappeared. The first such experiment, according to my notebook, was in November 1975. The experiment did not give clear results, but I continued to refine it. The first experiments that showed clearly that M1 and M2 are RNAs and not proteins were done in late March 1976. Eventually, as I repeated the experiment more and refined it more, it was clear that this result was fully reproducible. When I examined a large pile of photos of SDS gels from RNase P purifications, M1 and M2 were always there. Furthermore, they were most intense in the peak RNase P activity fractions, purified along with the RNase P activity, and their intensity in various fractions nearly paralleled that of RNase P activity in these fractions. I became convinced that M1 and M2 were part of RNase P.\n\nObviously in 1975–1976, the idea that an enzyme was not protein was absolute heresy. I had never heard of anything like this myself, and, of course, the dogma maintained that this notion was crazy. Unknown to me (I found these papers sometime later), there had been at least three previous reports of ribonucleoprotein enzymes in the literature. When I proposed this idea to Sid, he was against it. At the time, I think he saw me as a very green, though hard-working, graduate student who was not very successful in his PhD research. I did not know what to do. I was convinced I was on to something, but Sid did not want me to pursue it thinking it was a crazy idea by someone who was a bit too naïve. I am afraid I got to whining about this situation quite a bit, largely to Sheldon Feinstein, my lab partner, fellow graduate student, and close friend (see his contribution in this tribute). In October 1976, Sheldon had had enough of my complaining and he told me that, if I felt that strongly about the RNA nature of RNase P, I should have a meeting of my committee and try to convince them that I should devise a way to test this idea. Actually, I did have an idea of how to go about this (see below), but it was not a very good one.\n\nIt must have been around October 6, 1976 that my meeting was held. My committee consisted of Sid, Don Crothers (a distinguished member of the Chemistry Department), and Peter Rae (a member of the Biology Department, who was very popular with graduate students). I pitched my idea of the RNA nature of RNase P to the committee. My recollection is that Sid and Don Crothers were negative about this proposal and asked me how I would go about proving my idea. I suggested pretreating my RNase P preparations with a ribonuclease and assessing whether the RNase P activity disappeared. The problem, of course, was that in order to assay my ribonuclease-treated RNase P fraction I would have to use an RNA substrate, and any ribonuclease I had used to degrade the RNase P would also degrade the substrate and render the assay impossible. I proposed to use ribonuclease T1; because of its small size, it might be possible to separate it from RNase P by gel filtration (remember I knew RNase P had a molecular weight of ∼260,000). The technical problems with this approach, however, were daunting, as even modest carryover and contamination with highly active ribonuclease T1 (post-gel filtration) would ruin the assay.\n\nIt is here that Peter Rae stepped in. He noted that micrococcal nuclease, an enzyme used, I think, routinely in his lab, would degrade RNA in a calcium-dependent manner. Since RNase P did not require calcium, I could perform the RNase P treatment in the presence of micrococcal nuclease and calcium, then dialyze out the calcium from the digestion mix (relatively easily), add back magnesium to support RNase P activity, and then assay for RNase P activity. The micrococcal nuclease would still contaminate the RNase P but it would not matter, because, in the absence of calcium, the micrococcal nuclease would be inactive and would not interfere with the RNase P assay by degrading the RNA substrate.\n\nAccording to my notebook, I got some micrococcal nuclease from Tom Barnett, a grad student in Peter Rae's laboratory, on October 7, 1976. Over the next few days, I worked out the conditions for my experiments and these results are shown in Figures 3A and 3B of the 1978 PNAS paper. Sid was still skeptical. But within a few days, controls and repeats showed that the phenomenon was real: RNase P really does have a required RNA component, that is, enzymes do not have to be proteins only. Six months later I defended my thesis. In an initial thesis draft, I had suggested that perhaps the RNA in RNase P was catalytic, but Sid made me exclude that part in favor of the more conservative idea that the RNA moiety of the enzyme may position the tRNA precursor in the active site by complementary base pairing with portions of the substrate.\n\nAfter my defense, I stayed on in Sid's laboratory for a month or two and continued my work. It was then that I did the first experiments on reconstitution of RNase P from protein and RNA components (which were not convincingly successful). The rest is postscript. Sid took up my cause and made it his cause as well. It seemed as difficult for him to convince the scientific establishment as it had been for me to convince him (see photo of letter). Nature summarily rejected our first manuscript on the topic, later calling it a “quirk” in a News and Views report following the publication of the PNAS paper. And there were other cases dismissing the importance of the discovery as well.\n\nThe tide slowly began to turn though. In 1979 came the original work on snRNAs from Joan Steitz's laboratory, and in 1980 a paper from Norm Pace's laboratory showed a required RNA component in RNase P from Bacillus subtilis. Other RNA-containing enzymes were discovered soon after. By 1981–1983 came the discovery of self-splicing of Tetrahymena rRNA precursors by the Cech laboratory and the key discovery that M1 RNA is the catalytic subunit of RNase P by Sid's laboratory; these findings formed the basis for their 1989 Nobel Prize.\n\nWhen I had my own laboratory, I worked trying to find RNase P in higher plants for a short while. However, circumstances led me in other research directions, which were interesting and fruitful for me. But my RNase P experience in graduate school certainly remains a singular part of my life.\n\nI first met Sid in late summer 1984 when he, together with his family, visited the Department of Molecular Biology at Uppsala University, where I was doing my PhD. He gave an inspiring presentation during which he discussed his recent and exciting findings on how the RNA subunit of RNase P cleaves precursor tRNA even without the protein cofactor. Visitors typically met with faculty researchers and PhD students in the department. During my discussion about my PhD project with Sid, he mentioned that he had heard that I was looking for a post doctoral position and the discussion naturally evolved into the possibility of my joining his laboratory. Following this exchange and an invitation from Sid, I visited his laboratory at Yale University in April 1985 after I had attended the ribosome meeting in Corpus Christi, Texas. We continued our discussions and he suggested that I explore funding possibilities immediately. After receiving financial support from the Swedish Research Council and defending my thesis in December 1985, I joined Sid's laboratory in the end of January 1986.\n\nGiven my PhD research with translation and suppressor tRNAs in Escherichia coli, I started to work on the efficiencies of nonsense tRNA suppressors, including the classical tRNATyrSu3 nonsense suppressor. My objective was to examine the suppression efficiencies of these tRNAs in different RNase P mutant backgrounds to get insight into the action of this processing enzyme in vivo. Before the RNase P mutants were introduced into strains carrying different nonsense suppressors, we (I worked together with Maddy Baer) cloned and sequenced the mutants to map the changes in the RNase P RNA and protein (C5) genes. Sid was very supportive and encouraged me to examine various tRNATyrSu3 mutants in the laboratory freezer, in particular tRNATyrSu3A15, which he, as a post doc at the LMB in Cambridge (England), used to demonstrate that the E. coli tRNATyr gene is transcribed as a precursor. I presented to Sid the first draft of the manuscript, which included plenty of data. After reading the draft, he said that I had provided a good summary of the data. Howcver, Sid counseled that each section of a manuscript should include one question, how it was addressed experimentally, the results, and then finally the conclusions. I have tried to follow this advice and pass it on to my trainees as well. The manuscript was revised and published with the title “Differential effects of mutations in the protein and RNA moieties of RNase P on the efficiency of suppression by various tRNA suppressors.” In a follow-up study, we reported how some of these precursor tRNATyrSu3 mutants were cleaved in vitro with and without the C5 protein cofactor, thus giving me experience of also studying RNase P in vitro. In fact, this foray into in vitro work fortuitously shaped my independent career where I focused on dissecting the substrate-recognition properties of bacterial RNase P.\n\nI stayed in Sid's laboratory for almost three years and left in December 1988 to start my own research group at Uppsala University. Again, Sid was supportive as I sought to set up my laboratory. In October 1989, it was announced that Sidney Altman and Tom Cech were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discoveries of catalytic RNAs. I tried to call and congratulate Sid but it was impossible to reach him by his phone in his office or his laboratory. Then, I called the neighboring lab (fortunately, I still had the Yale telephone book!) and asked if I could talk to Sid. This approach turned out to be successful and I got to congratulate him. Later in December 1989, I met Sid, his family and friends during the prize ceremonies and dinner, as well as when he and Tom Cech delivered their Nobel lectures in Uppsala.\n\nOver the years, we stayed in contact and I frequently visited Sid and his laboratory. I updated him about our work on RNase P—in fact, we exchanged emails even until after Christmas last year. In 1995, I invited Sid to act as the faculty opponent during the thesis defense of Staffan Svärd, my first PhD student. Sid kindly accepted, examined Staffan's thesis, questioned him, and led the discussions constructively with insight and keen interest, thus making the public defense instructive for all attendees. Sid and I also met at different conferences. I invited him to a meeting that focused on noncoding RNAs and was held on an island in the Stockholm archipelago at the rim of the Baltic sea. Sid was one of the keynote speakers and he presented his recent work on RNase P and cleavage of new targets. His presence was much appreciated given the fruitful discussions that he engendered. When we were together at the FEBS meeting in Athens, Greece (June 2008), given our mutual interest in art and culture, we walked around Athens, visited a museum (see photo), and greatly enjoyed ourselves.\n\nSid was fond of Asian food. During my visits to New Haven, we had several pleasant dinners at Asian restaurants. On one occasion, he invited me to join him and Ann to have dinner at a Thai restaurant. Given my customs at home, I asked Sid if I had to wear a tie. I was serious but Sid took it that I was joking given that he always chose rather unpretentious restaurants with good food! Though I do not remember if I wore a tie, the food was tasty and we had a good time.\n\nMy fond recollections of Sid revolve around events that happened shortly after I had arrived and started my work in Sid's laboratory. Olof Palme, the Swedish prime minister, was shot and killed in Stockholm (February 1986). The day after the assassination, Sid and I discussed this sad event. I was surprised to learn from Sid that he was familiar with the work of Palme and his achievements. In April 1986, the devastating Chernobyl accident resulted in a radioactive fallout in Sweden. Of course, we discussed this event too. During these exchanges, Sid showed genuine concern and empathy. I was allowed to use the phone in the laboratory (no cell phones available at the time, of course!) to connect with friends and family in Sweden to ensure they were doing well. I appreciated this gesture as well as his meaningful support during these two tragic events. It meant a lot to me, as I had just left home and my thoughts were about Sweden.\n\nSid has left us and my thoughts go to his family and children who have lost a father and grandfather. Although Sid is gone, I will cherish many wonderful memories. In my world, he will be remembered as a mentor, friend, and a scientist with great integrity who trusted and pursued his ideas. Importantly, he was a scientist who “made sense and use of the unexpected.”\n\nMy time in Sid Altman's laboratory from January 1988 to December 1990 was inspiring, eventful, frustrating, and life-changing, replete with important lessons from the great man himself. In my personal account of this period and Sid's earlier breakthroughs, I minimize repetition of what has been written so eloquently before, particularly by Sid, Ben Stark and Bill McClain.\n\nI began my postdoc full of optimism as a 25-yr-old Aussie who had already discovered the hammerhead ribozyme structure and had moved to the lab of his choice in the United States with support from Anna Fuller Fund and (later) Jane Coffin Childs fellowships. But the start of my work at Yale proved challenging. There was the fortuitous distraction of meeting my future wife on the first day, and the theft of my handwritten draft of the double-hammerhead manuscript from a locked car (which I instantly learned was not atypical for New Haven!). And my first project, cleverly laid out by Sid, proved too difficult technically for me. The plan was to synthesize small hairpin substrates for RNase P that contained a unique phosphorothioate at the cleavage site, courtesy of a unique nucleobase in the template strand, using phosphorothioate NTPs kindly supplied by Fritz Eckstein. Ideally, these substrates would then act as competitive inhibitors and enable determination of the cleavage stereochemistry and the specificity of cation catalytic cofactors. I thought the easiest way would be for the Altman laboratory to adopt Olke Uhlenbeck's technique of directly transcribing synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides with T7 RNA polymerase, but my transcriptions were poor in comparison with ones that I had performed as a graduate student at Adelaide University. So, I asked my PhD advisor, Bob Symons, to kindly mail me some oligos. Based on direct experimental comparisons, I determined that the oligo synthesis core facility at Yale Chemistry was not synthesizing their oligos properly. Inspired by the whirlwind progress with standard (plasmid) transcription templates by Cecilia Guerrier-Takada, the most accomplished member in the Altman group, I next decided to learn DNA cloning to make substrates by cloning oligos. However, that also did not go well. To make matters worse, RNAs that incorporated thioNTPs led to puzzling results, consistent with a later publication revealing that special precautions were required to prevent oxidation during gel purification, handling, and storage (Milligan and Uhlenbeck 1989). Furthermore, RNase P cleavage was shifted to a site adjacent to the intended one (similar to Kahle et al. 1993).\n\nDuring this frustrating period, my advisor also seemed less happy than expected, especially for someone that I had bet a case of beer on as a future Nobel laureate. A contributing factor may have been the jostling for credit. For example, early prizes for ribozymes were awarded exclusively to Tom Cech, who had published self-splicing two years and then one year prior to Sid publishing Cecilia's discovery of enzymatic RNA (Guerrier-Takada et al. 1983); also see Altman, RNA Society Newsletter of January 2009. Or Sid's service as Dean of Yale College (1985–1989) might have been taking a toll. More concerning was that the Altman laboratory had just found that their 1986 publication reconstituting RNase P activity from partially purified HeLa RNA and Escherichia coli C5 protein was artifactual due to the ability of nonspecific RNA to activate small amounts of M1 RNA contaminating excess purified C5 protein. This finding spurred me to manually deduce potential secondary structures of eukaryotic RNase P RNAs that bore partial similarities with Norman Pace's prokaryotic structures to further strengthen the case that the Altman laboratory had indeed cloned the bona fide HeLa RNase P RNA (Bartkiewicz et al. 1989). But my new structures, which only shared sequence and secondary structural homology at the ends of the RNase P RNAs, raised doubts about another Altman laboratory 1986 publication on the ability of M1 RNA to tolerate large terminal deletions, albeit with much lower activities. These doubts ultimately proved correct (see discussion of Guerrier-Takada and Altman 1992). I later added more homology between the structures, even extending it to RNase MRP RNA. Sid generously shared our submitted manuscript with the RNase MRP discoverer, David Clayton, but he quickly wrote a letter to the editor of Cell rebutting our submission. Fortunately, the editor published our manuscript (Forster and Altman 1990a) and not the rebuttal.\n\nGiven the difficulties of my first experimental project, I proposed a new one in mid-1988: to target any RNA for cleavage by RNase P by hybridizing the target with a complementary “external guide sequence” (EGS) RNA terminating with the CCA sequence conserved in tRNAs. Sid really liked this idea and made it the main subject of a patent application that he was previously writing with Cecilia on the ability of RNase P to cleave viruses (ultimately awarded as US patent 5,168,053). Then he had Cecilia, me and himself sign over our rights to Yale, cofounded Innovir Laboratories with an exclusive license to the IP with old friend Hugh Robertson and became a paid consultant. My own payoff was limited to doing the work for a publication (Forster and Altman 1990b), but this did give me tremendous satisfaction as it ultimately became Sid's second-most-highly cited research publication and he featured it prominently in his 1989 Nobel lecture. This work took some time, as I wanted to show that RNase P could cleave at a deoxyribonucleotide linkage (which it did) and make sure that the enzymes were saturated with both target and EGS RNAs to obtain reliable kinetic parameters (the affinities were weak for M1 RNA alone: KM = 4.6 µM; kcat = 4.3 min−1 for HinfI pAT1 with 29-mer; pAT1 hairpin gave 4.6 μM (230x published) and 8.6 min−1; ironically, these values were never published as one reviewer insisted we take out all the kinetic data!).\n\nThe most notable event in my middle year was Sid sharing the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Tom Cech “for their discovery of catalytic properties of RNA.” Given how thoroughly the Nobel Committee investigates discoveries (e.g., by soliciting written testimonies), this award clarified credit for the research community. The motivation text for the prize included: “All enzymes were considered to be proteins… 1978… was the first time that an RNA molecule had been shown to be necessary for a catalytic reaction.” The Altman laboratory had been more modest at the time, citing the well-known ribosome precedent (which admittedly was thought of, not as an enzyme, but rather as a huge multienzyme complex requiring many RNA and protein factors) and four early obscure papers of enzymes copurifying with an RNA (cited in Kole and Altman 1979). But two of these four papers reported resistance to inactivation by ribonuclease; one was only published in Russian and none had panned out, so it seems that the Nobel Committee got it right. The serendipitous, heretical discovery of an RNA subunit, for which Sid gave full credit to his PhD student, Ben Stark, was rejected by Nature before publication elsewhere (Stark et al. 1978; ironically highlighted in Nature by Travers 1978). That breakthrough was a real slog in the face of huge experimental challenges and scientific skepticism (see Ben Stark's article in this tribute) not to mention fierce competition (Guthrie 1980 and other competitors cited in the introduction of Kole and Altman 1981). Sid suffered ridicule at conferences but held his ground with determination and soon bolstered it with reconstitution of the enzyme (Kole and Altman 1979). Knowledge that a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) enzyme estimated at the time to contain some 80% of its weight as RNA (Stark et al. 1978; later refined to 90%) changed the prevailing view that the RNA portions of all RNPs, including the ribosome, were mainly scaffolds.\n\nThree years after the publication of Stark et al. (1978), Tom Cech presented self-splicing RNA at conferences and endured less resistance than had Sid (Cech 1989, Nobel lecture), presumably because of Sid's earlier RNP work. And, coming full circle two years after that, Cecilia's serendipitous discovery of the first true catalytic RNA in a negative-control experiment was instantly accepted thanks to Tom Cech's work. Remarkably, all experiments and writing for the manuscript (Guerrier-Takada et al. 1983) were completed and submitted in just under one month and published within three months! They concluded, “If proteins were relative latecomers in the evolution of macromolecules, then primeval manipulations of nucleic acids may have been carried out entirely or predominantly by catalytic nucleic acids themselves.” That statement and publication were the real nailing of the prior existence of an RNA world in the origin of life. Self-splicing might not have come extremely early in evolution as it is largely confined to only one of the three kingdoms of life, and life depends on trans-acting enzymes that remain active at the end of the reaction. RNase P appeared to be a universal RNP, was a true enzyme and provided a second example of a ribozyme. With respect to catalytic RNAs acting in trans, the Nobel Committee noted an important application: “Catalytic RNA will probably provide a new tool for gene technology, with potential to create a new defense against viral infections… ribozymes will probably be used as gene shears” (trans versions of the hammerhead). Unfortunately, we're still not there yet.\n\nA general take-home message for me from these unexpected breakthroughs was that scientific assumptions should not be cherished too dearly, especially when confronted by strong data with proper controls. As a further example from the field and an ironic twist, the assumption mentioned above that all RNase P enzymes would contain RNA components was overturned by Peter Gegenheimer's lab (Wang et al. 1988; see Peter Gegenheimer's article in this tribute); that finding also faced considerable skepticism. Invalidating assumptions may seem to be a rather minor feature of everyday science. However, looking back through my own papers, a fifth of them went against an assumption at the time, and those papers were my more impactful ones!\n\nMy final year in Sid's lab (1990) ended with my best insight in the RNase P/RNase MRP field, with the benefit of hindsight, which ironically I never published. Based on several lines of evidence (e.g., with a deletion of G291G292 in M1 RNA; see Kirsebom and Altman 1989), I strongly favored pairing of the conserved penultimate tRNA sequence RCC with M1 RNA's 5′-G292G293U294 loop acting as an “internal guide sequence.” Testing this model was my top priority if I stayed in the RNase P field, but, disappointingly, my assistant professor job search didn't turn out as desired. So, with my work visa having expired and having taken the MCAT exam as a backup, early next year (1991) I was admitted into the M.D. training program of Harvard. Leif Kirsebom (who overlapped with me in Sid's laboratory in 1988 and who ultimately recruited me to Uppsala University) independently proposed this same pairing between M1 RNA and substrates and, more importantly, proved it (Kirsebom and Svärd 1994).\n\nThrough this retrospective, I hope to have illustrated the highly stimulating scientific environment of the Altman laboratory and also several of Sid's most endearing traits: integrity, a strong work ethic, ability to identify important problems, determination in the face of setbacks and criticism, ability to discard scientific bias when challenged by strong experimental data, high productivity promoted by fast and efficient action, and a well-grounded ego (even after winning a Nobel!). Sid and I became closer as the years progressed (see photo taken at Sid's residence in Hamden, Connecticut) and he will be greatly missed.\n\nI thank Altman lab alumni Venkat Gopalan, Sergei Kazakov, Leif Kirsebom and Ben Stark for many helpful comments on the manuscript.\n\nThe world lost one of the best biochemists and molecular biologists and I lost my mentor who was the most influential and helpful in my scientific career. Sid was not only an exceptionally talented scientist, but also a great educator and trained several generations of scientists who are currently continuing his scientific legacy all over the world. It can never be overstated how much I have gained and benefited from being trained under his guidance as a postdoctoral fellow in the 1990s. Among all the legacies that Sid left for us, what I appreciate the most are two of his profound characteristics––challenging authority and being an erudite scholar.\n\nChallenging authority: Sid trained his students and postdocs to have creative thinking and an independent intellectual spirit, which, he told us, are the most important components in science. He always advocated healthy disbelief in the words of authority figures and keeping an open mind. To this end, he started by instilling in us the equality of mentors and students academically and encouraging us to challenge his thoughts. My postdoctoral work with Sid was on how human RNase P recognizes its substrates. Tony Forster, a postdoctoral fellow two years ahead of me in the Altman lab, had proposed an external guide sequence (EGS) concept that any RNA can be cleaved by E. coli RNase P if an EGS RNA base-paired with it in cells. My study on substrate recognition by human RNase P made it possible to extend the EGS-induced cleavage of RNA into human cells, therefore establishing a specific gene silencing method. I found that a custom-designed EGS that base-pairs with an mRNA to form the secondary structure equivalent to the acceptor stem, D stem–loop and variable loop of tRNA can induce a cleavage on the mRNA by human RNase P. The variable loop that forms a bulge in the mRNA-EGS double helix is critical for the cleavage efficiency. To reveal the role of the variable loop in RNase P recognition and obtain the knowledge important for us to design EGSs with the maximal efficiency in RNase P-mediated mRNA cleavage, I investigated the contribution of the variable loop in RNase P recognition. I hypothesized that the variability of the loop may render a substrate with a different acceptor stem and D stem–loop the best fit for a tertiary structure that RNase P recognizes. Then the question was how we determine the size and sequence of the variable loop in a particular EGS to achieve maximal efficiency. After several failures with “rational design,” I realized that we are not smart enough and we should seek help from higher powers. I came up with a bold and novel idea—according to the principle of “survival of the fittest” in Darwin's evolution theory: Can this principle be applied to molecular biology to create a selective pressure to screen out the most effective biomolecules in a test tube using molecular evolution? I consulted with Sid for advice. His first reaction was that he didn't think the idea would come to fruition. He was worried that I was wasting a lot of time for nothing. I went back and thought about it for another two weeks and made further modifications to the experimental design. I went back and talked to Sid again about the plan. He noticed that my design was improved and more mature than the first version, but he still thought it was not feasible. But this time, he didn't stop me from trying the idea. He said to me—“My feeling is that this experiment will not work, but I would like to see you prove that you are right and I am wrong.” After a few weeks, the experiment achieved better outcomes than expected. It was my turn to present at the lab meeting the next day. At the lab meeting, I started with the original idea and explained the experimental process. Before showing my results, I was constantly being criticized and questioned by others, including Sid. In the last few minutes, I showed my results: After evolution in the test tube, the biological activity of the selected molecule was increased a hundredfold. Sid was excited about this work. He then helped me publish the work in Science. Since I became an independent investigator, I have been copying Sid's style—open myself to the ideas of any student and coworker and encourage them to challenge my thoughts.\n\nBe an erudite scholar: Sid was trained as a physicist but developed an interest in biology and chemistry. His interdisciplinary training laid the foundation for his enormous scientific achievements. Sid repeatedly made his point to his students that he never believed in genius; there are only two factors for success in science: willingness to learn and hard work. My parents came from China to New Haven for my wedding where they met Sid. When Sid left the wedding, he pulled me over and said, “Please make sure to bring your parents to my office and I would like to chat with them.” In Sid's office, my father, a professor of Chinese Literature at Shandong University, China, asked Sid a question—“Should a university offer an interdisciplinary curriculum and train students to be erudite?” He mentioned that in Chinese universities, all students are assigned a narrow specialty from day one in college and all colleges were run like technical skill schools. Sid replied: “Creativity is based on knowledge.” Then he said—“When I was the Dean of Yale College, I proposed and made a change in Yale college curriculum to have students conversant in all disciplinary areas: non-science major students are required to take some science courses, and science major students must take humanity courses.” Such requirement was initiated at Yale and later adapted by many colleges including Harvard, MIT, Columbia University, and UPenn. Sid was the most knowledgeable and erudite scientist I have ever met. Sid often ate lunch with lab members in the cafeteria on the top floor of the Kline Biology Tower, where all kinds of topics could be brought up to the table—history of science, cultures, politics, religions, and sports. For whatever topic, Sid was always able to provide deep insights, reflecting on his wide knowledge and profound thoughts. Everyone who knew Sid was impressed by this attribute. A few years ago, I brought my whole family to visit Sid in New Haven. When my son, a high schooler at the time, told Sid his dream of becoming a US Navy officer, Sid told him the story of Hyman Rickover, about his Navy experience, his struggle with racial discrimination in the Navy being Jewish, and his achievement to become the father of the nuclear Navy and a four-star admiral. Inspired by Sid's account on Admiral Rickover's life, my son pursued this goal and is now an active-duty surface warfare officer on a guided-missile destroyer.\n\nBefore leaving Yale, I sat down with Sid and asked him for advice on my future research directions. He said earnestly—“Your scientific training is mainly in biochemistry. I think that most people in the field of biochemistry do not understand the real questions in biology. I hope you find real questions in biology to work with.” After joining the University of Pennsylvania, Sid's words “real question in biology” have guided me to expand my scientific specialties from RNA biochemistry to herpes virology, and to cancer biology. The last time when I saw Sid in 2019, I showed Sid my recent discovery—some pediatric osteosarcomas may be caused by a tumor virus.\n\nDuring the summer of 2017, we visited Sidney Altman in New Haven and recorded long conversations with him over two days. One of us (J.B.L.) was only six years into an independent science career then and was grappling with the question of what makes illustrious scientists “great.” One of us (V.G.) had previously been a postdoctoral fellow with Sid and enjoyed many interactions with him in different contexts. Both of us were passionate about scientific history in general and inspired in our own research by the discovery of catalytic RNAs by Sid and Tom Cech, one of the most important breakthroughs in molecular biology. Therefore, we were eager to hear Sid's views on his discovery and his philosophy about science in general.\n\nSid—a private person who was never interested in making himself well known—was patient, thoughtful, and expansive even as we covered an array of topics spanning his life, his work, attributes of great scientists, the nature of scientific discovery and the research enterprise, research advising and teaching, and the role of social and cultural contexts on the scientist. From this extensive interview, which was conducted at his home and at his office at Yale, we highlight here select questions and responses to showcase elements that shaped Sid's life and importantly to share some of his perspectives that are likely to be valuable to all researchers. (In some instances, we have collated from different parts of the interview that related to the same question, expanded abbreviations, or provided comments to supplement his responses.)\n\nQ: What appealed to you about science?\n\nA: As a child, I was interested in natural phenomena like thunder and lightning. I suppose I was interested in science. When I was 12 or 13, one of my relatives gave me a book called Explaining the Atom, by Selig Hecht. I was impressed by Mendeleev and his formulation of the periodic table, and importantly his ability to predict the presence and properties of some elements that had not been found. For a 12-year-old, it was amazing that someone could think about something deeply and make suggestions about what might be discovered. So, that fixed me on the path to science, and equally important was my reading about the history of physics in the first part of the 20th century. (Note: Elsewhere, Sid has talked about how the atomic bomb was in the news when he first started school and it was clear to him that science was important. He also mentioned that even before the age of 10 he had read about Einstein, who was presented as a model for anyone interested in studies.)\n\nI always wanted to be a physicist. Due to certain circumstances, I went to MIT instead of McGill. At MIT, I pursued physics and found that fellow students were stimulating and crazy. I heard about interesting things all the time. My teachers were pretty good too. My Senior Honors thesis was completed under the mentorship of Lee Grodzins and it was serious research. These experiences provided a firm interest in science but I should also mention here that there was also nothing to dissuade me from science. My parents had no force in their voices. They never mentioned medical school or the legal profession, which was highly unusual for immigrant families in Montreal since these professions guaranteed good living. I have to praise them for it.\n\nQ: Did you have early scientific heroes? What makes them great scientists?\n\nA: My scientific heroes were Einstein, Bohr, and Rutherford. They were great scientists in every way because they recognized a new era in their fields and took to it quickly. Moreover, they were successful and not influenced by anyone else. Einstein is superb in this regard and was very unusual—everything that he did was imaginative. His prediction of gravitational waves was validated 100 years later by work conducted at the LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory)!\n\nQ: Why did you become a scientist? Did you enjoy being a scientist?\n\nA: When I was a teenager, I thought that the life of a scientist is perfect, especially if you are at a university even though I did not know much about the job. I believed that it would be good to be in science because the amount of material that you use in judging another person's productivity is not susceptible to any kind of fiddling. Also, the person who is producing the material cannot cheat. Twenty years later, when I was in my 30's, I found that those concepts were probably true but they were not really true. I realized that people are the same everywhere. There were good scientists who worked hard and did good experiments, but there [are] also nasty people who got credit because of other people's work.\n\nYes, I enjoyed being a scientist, partly because my work was successful. If my work had not been successful, I may not have enjoyed it so much.\n\nQ: What makes a laboratory a good environment for trainees?\n\nA: Intelligence of the group leader is important, especially how she/he approaches a research problem. The leader must understand that different students have different ways of showing their intelligence. A good leader must recognize that getting a PhD is tough regardless of one's previous record. The advisor should work with the trainee to solve a problem. Rigid mentor-mentee structures should not exist.\n\nQ: Why do you think the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), Cambridge, has been such a successful research enterprise?\n\nA: The LMB is a special place where everyone worked at the bench. When I was a postdoc, I enjoyed coming to the LMB every day because it was a conglomeration of people who were dedicated to pushing science forward. Virtually, no one worked in a team. When you gathered for coffee or tea in the morning or afternoon, however, you could discuss anything with anyone, including senior scientists. The general attitude was that you get the right people and give them the freedom to do what they want. Max Perutz promoted this approach (like Bell Labs), and he got the necessary funding. However, I do not know how he [or they] always identified great people.\n\nOne important aspect of the LMB was that knowledge/technical advances were shared immediately. For example, when I was at the LMB, typically polyacrylamide gels were run with wide lanes to obtain radiolabeled tRNAs and 5S rRNA. I went to the machine shop and had them make for me a 15-well comb for my gels. I was so excited because this is something new. Soon, everyone at the LMB was using this multiwell comb. I only learnt later that Bill Studier had done this six months before me.\n\nIt has been hard to replicate the LMB anywhere else. In the US, each individual is her/his champion. The time spent obtaining funds (unlike the LMB) distracts from doing the science.\n\nQ: What is your opinion about teaching in STEM areas and in the laboratory? Can creativity be nurtured? Do you believe that cultural contexts color the nature and scope of research?\n\nA: I do not have a specific teaching philosophy. Classroom material should be presented in the simplest form and lecture content must connect with the students. For example, when I gave my lecture on human genetics at Yale, I would talk about number of chromosomes and diseases like sickle cell anemia. Many African American students came to see me afterwards to remark that this is the first time they had learned about this disease. These students were interested because I spoke about something that affected their personal lives. Lectures need not be made easy but must cover material that students might be interested in.\n\nFor graduate training, the key is for students to be sufficiently competent to become independent. Innovation cannot be nurtured but the ability to observe something new and look at things in a different way is key to becoming independent scientists.\n\nIn some cultures, there is an emphasis on listening to older people and doing exactly as instructed. It is important to encourage young people everywhere to come up with their own ideas.\n\nBe not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them. (Shakespeare)\n\nWithin their own spheres, every person seeks to shape her/his trail to success. Our quest to better understand Sid, a great scientist, left us surprised by the simplicity of his responses. The themes highlighted by Sid—imagination, inventiveness, thinking outside the box, and the appreciation of the uniqueness of individuals—were familiar because these traits are exemplified in the best teachers and researchers. These individuals may not be recognized with prizes and awards, but they embody the same elements of “greatness” as Sid. After reflecting on our interview with Sid, the important takeaway message, rather a reminder, is that marshaling the elements of great scientists latent within all of us may offer a path to a more fulfilling career in science.\n\nWe are extremely grateful for the meticulous collation and administrative support provided by Ann Marie Micenmacher. This Tribute paper would not have been possible without her help."
