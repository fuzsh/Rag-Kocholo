        "text": "KEYWORDS: Ada E. Yonath, Nobel Prize laureates, Israeli scientists, Biochemistry, Crystallography\n\nSHE THOUGHT IT\n\nAda E. Yonath was the first Israeli woman to win the Nobel Prize. She shared it with Thomas Steitz and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan for having identified “the structure and function of the ribosome”1 by means of crystallography. This discovery explained the functioning of numerous existing antibiotics and is helping create new ones1.\n\nSince the end of the 1970s, Yonath’s scientific career has been centred around ribosomes, specifically around how they function by determining their structure using x-ray crystallography. A ribosome is “the cellular organelle [which catalyzes] the translation of genetic code into proteins”2. They are found in every cell.\n\nAfter more than 25 thousand attempts, Yonath and her team created the first ribosome crystal in the 1980s. They perfected the process in the following two decades until they produced an electron density map of the ribosome’s small subunit3 and, in 2000, succeeded in recreating “the first complete 3-D structures of both subunits of the bacterial ribosome”3.\n\nTheir research has explained the decoding of genetic information4 and the way antibiotics work3. Thanks to their work, improved and more effective antibiotics are now being made3.\n\nSHORT BIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn in Jerusalem in 1939, Yonath grew up in unfavorable conditions, losing her father at the age of eleven and having to work to contribute to the family income3. She attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she obtained a BSc in 1962 and an MSc in chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics in 1964. Her doctoral research was carried out at the Weizmann Institute in Israel.\n\nShe did her postdoctoral fellowship between 1968 and 1969 at the Mellon Institute in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both in the USA. Upon her return to the Weizmann Institute, Yonath established a biological crystallography laboratory, the first of its kind in the country. She focused on determining the 3-D structure of the ribosome in order to better understand its functioning3 —a task that took over twenty years to be accomplished.\n\nHer research was carried out in collaboration with Heinz-Günter Wittmann from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin. She was the head of the Max Planck Research Unit in Hamburg between 1986 and 2004 and visiting professor or scientist at various universities from Chile to Alabama. In 1989, Yonath became the director of the Helen and Milton A. Kimmelman Center for the Study of Biomolecular Structure and Assembly at the Weizmann Institute (founded in 1988), a position that she still holds today.\n\nSHE SAID IT\n\nEducation will change this inequality. Stop telling teenagers that a demanding profession prevents one from being a good mother. I have a granddaughter who thinks I’m the best grandmother in the world! (my translation)\n\ncited by Nicot, Marie (30 Jan. 2011), “Ada Yonath, Prix Nobel de la curiosité”, Le Journal de dimanche, <http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Sciences/Actualite/Ada-Yonath-Prix-Nobel-de-la-curiosite-260897> (last accessed 12 Jul. 2016).\n\nI don’t think doing science is difficult because you are a woman. What it is difficult to be a woman about [sic], is the same for a scientist, for a business woman, for a reporter. […] Society is, or was, against intellect in women and the idea that women could compete in an intellectual or scientific way. It’s not that it is difficult for a woman to do science. Science is very demanding from both men and women. I didn’t feel any gender problem and I think that everyone I know from my girl friends, no one complains directly about a gender problem. Science just is demanding – you cannot enjoy science unless you are curious and usually you do well because you educate yourself and you work hard, because you like it, not because you are a woman or a man.\n\ncited in “An Interview with Ada Yonath” (2010), interviewed by Lorena Guzman and Lou Woodley, Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, <http://www.lindau-nobel.org/an-interview-with-ada-yonath/> (last accessed 14 Jul. 2016).\n\nPRIZES, ACHIEVEMENTS, HONOURS\n\nYonath holds more than 25 honorary doctorates from universities all over the world and over 30 awards.
