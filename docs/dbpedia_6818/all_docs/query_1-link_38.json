        "text": "Sidney Altman, a molecular biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for sharing in the discovery that ribonucleic acid, or RNA, was not just a carrier of genetic information but could also be a catalyst for chemical reactions in cells — a breakthrough that paved the way for new gene therapies and treatments for viral infections — died on April 5 in Rockleigh, N.J. He was 82.\n\nYale University, where Dr. Altman spent most of his career, announced the death but did not specify the cause.\n\nThe discovery that RNA could function as an enzyme upended one of the central tenets of biology: that proteins are necessary to perform chemical reactions in cells.\n\n“The discovery of catalytic RNA has altered the central dogma of the biosciences,” the Nobel Institute said in announcing that Dr. Altman would share the 1989 chemistry prize.\n\nThe discovery also suggested an answer to an age-old chicken-and-egg question about how DNA, the double-helix building blocks of life, and proteins could have arisen without carriers like RNA to transmit their codes. Dr. Altman’s work posited that simple RNA molecules had come first.\n\nAs seems to happen so often in science, Dr. Altman stumbled upon his discovery. “I wasn’t looking for what I found,” he said in a 2010 interview with Harry Kreisler at the Institute for International Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
