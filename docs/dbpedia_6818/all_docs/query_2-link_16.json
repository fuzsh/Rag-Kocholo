        "text": "Thomas A. Steitz, a towering figure of late-20th-century science who shared a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for figuring out the structure of a huge molecule central to translating the genetic code into the proteins that make up living matter, died on Tuesday at his home in Branford, Conn. He was 78.\n\nThe cause was pancreatic cancer, his daughter-in-law Dr. Katherine Van Loon said.\n\nDr. Steitz was guided by the vision of a grand project to find the structures not just of that molecule but also of all the large molecules involved in translating genetic information into proteins, the so-called central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nHis Nobel, awarded in 2009, was for his discovery of the exact size, shape and position of every atom in the ribosome, the large molecule that is the site of such crucial protein synthesis.\n\nOne immediate application of the discovery was in understanding how a major set of antibiotics — those that poison bacterial ribosomes — work, thus offering clues to finding antibiotics that can evade drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nHe also found the structures of the other molecules that are part of the central dogma.\n\n“He could have been given three Nobels,” Donald M. Engelman, a fellow biophysicist at Yale and a good friend, said in a telephone interview. “Even if he had never done the ribosome, if there was something called the career Nobel Prize he would have been a winner.”\n\n(Dr. Steitz shared the 2009 Nobel with the Indian-born American molecular biologist Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Ada E. Yonath of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. All were honored for their ribosome research, which they conducted independently of one another.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
