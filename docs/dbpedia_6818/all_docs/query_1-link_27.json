        "text": "Jorge E. Galán, Ph.D., D.V.M., chair and Lucille P. Markey Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis and professor of cell biology, and Thomas A. Steitz, Ph.D., Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, were elected in April as fellows by the American Academy of Microbiology. Galán was honored for his innovative use of microbial molecular genetics and molecular cell biology to further the understanding of how microbial pathogens communicate and interact with their animal hosts, and for his molecular genetic characterization of the Salmonella pathogen. Steitz’s specialty is the study of the structures of proteins and nucleic acids to determine their biological function. His lab recently determined the atomic structure of a subunit of the ribosome."
