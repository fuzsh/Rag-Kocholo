        "text": "Dr. Grabel was elected to the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering (2007), to its governing council in 2012, and most recently as vice president, president, and past president, each for two-year terms (2014 to present). Additional Academy activities included her service as a member of the Academy’s peer review committee for the Biomedical Research Grants Project for the Connecticut Department of Public Health (2009 – 2013), as a keynote speaker on stem cell research at the Academy’s 38th Annual Meeting and Dinner (2013), and as a contributor to the Academy’s Science Matters! Series in partnership with the Hartford Courant News in Education Series. Professor Grabel is recognized for all her service on behalf of the Academy, but particularly for providing exceptional leadership as president of the Academy during a period of unique challenges.\n\nAs a leading expert in stem cell research, Professor Grabel has advised state and national governments, as well as public and private funding agencies, on the efficacy and promise of stem cell research. Her area of research includes the neurogenesis of embryonic stem cells, transplantation of embryonic stem cells derived neural stem cells and neurons in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, and cell migration in early mammalian development. She joined Wesleyan University in the biology department in 1984 after a postdoctoral fellowship for the National Institutes of Health at the University of California, San Francisco. At Wesleyan, Grabel served in various positions including as the Fisk Professor of Natural Science, director of graduate studies, chair of the biology department, and dean of natural sciences and mathematics prior to being named the Lauren B. Dachs Professor of Science and Society. She is the author or co-author of numerous, highly cited academic articles and a book on ethical stem cell research. Grants were awarded for her research from the NIH, American Cancer Society, the Donaghue Foundation, the National Science Foundation, Mellon, and Sonnenblick Cardiac Research Foundation. She served as Co-Director of the state-funded Human Embryonic Stem Cell Core Facility located in Farmington at the UCONN Health Center.\n\nIn 2019, Grabel was recognized as a Women of Innovation by the Connecticut Technology Council for her science, technology, engineering, and mathematics initiatives that support women in science. Examples cited include a course she taught on the biology of women at York Correctional Institution and collaborating with professional choreographers to convey complex scientific concepts through movement and dance in and outside of the classroom. Additional honors include NIH New Investigator and Career Development Awards. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement Science (AAAS), served as AAAS’s Biology Section Chair (2002-2005), and on the program committee (2002-2005). Professor Grabel has participated in numerous study sections and outside review panels, advisory panels, and has served as a journal reviewer and as an invited speaker nationally and internationally.\n\nGrabel graduated from Brandeis University in 1972 with a bachelor’s in biology and earned a PhD in biology.\n\nMatt Fleury was elected an honorary member of the Academy in recognition of his efforts in support of the Academy’s vision and mission. Specifically, he is honored for his activities that foster science and engineering education of the highest quality and promote interest in science and engineering on the part of the public, especially young people.\n\nMatt has served as president and chief executive officer of the Connecticut Science Center since 2009, after serving as the center’s executive vice president and chief operating officer during the Center’s development. He helped to launch the science center in his prior capacity with the Capital Region Development Authority (then CCEDA). Previously, Matt served in management positions in communications and government affairs in the telecommunications industry after a career in broadcast journalism.\n\nAdditionally, Matt serves on the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education. The board is the governing body for the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities. First appointed in 2011, he has supported its mission through various roles including chairman of the Finance & Infrastructure Committee, member of the Executive Committee, various presidential search committees, and now as the board’s chair. He was appointed chair by Governor Dannel P. Malloy in 2016 and reappointed by Gov. Ned Lamont for the second term in 2019.\n\nMr. Fleury also recently served as a member of the board and executive committee of the Association of Science & Technology Centers and he serves as a member of the board of directors of the MetroHartford Alliance. He was named in 2019 Nonprofit Executive of the Year by the Hartford Business Journal.\n\nMatt earned an MBA from the UCONN School of Business. He is also a graduate of Berkshire Community College and Charter Oak State College. He has studied organizational leadership at the Yale School of Management, and nonprofit performance and governance at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He and his wife call Connecticut home and are the proud parents of twin boys.\n\nCuriosity is at the heart of all scientists, believes Professor Thomas A. Steitz. He recalls always wondering about what gives substances color and later, while a student at Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin, he learned about the structure of molecules that produce color. Over the years, Professor Steitz’s curiosity led him to “want to understand how the structures of biological macromolecules can explain how they work,” opening the door to our current understanding of the mechanisms by which the proteins and nucleic acids involved in the central dogma of molecular biology carry out gene expression, from replication and recombination of the DNA genome, to its transcription into mRNA, followed by the translation of mRNA into protein. Most recently, Professor Steitz’s work on the ribosome has led to the development of new classes of antibiotics to treat multiple-­‐drug resistant bacterial infections. Steitz, Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale, is widely published and has earned numerous awards and recognitions including the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry which he shared with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Ada Yonath. In 2001 Professor Steitz and his colleagues founded Rib-­‐X Pharmaceuticals, a company developing antibiotics to treat tuberculosis, methicillin-­‐resistant Staphylococcus, and Escherichia coli. In 2013, Thomas A. Steitz is honored with the Connecticut Medal of Science.\n\nThomas Steitz was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1940. His father was the head of personnel at the Milwaukee County Hospital while his mother stayed home to raise Thomas and his two younger brothers and two younger sisters. In junior high school, he became a serious saxophone player and even considered majoring in music; however, at Lawrence College, the influence of Professor Rober Rosenberg changed the course of events, helping Tom “understand the world around him because he introduced to us the concepts of atomic orbitals and bonding and how studying chemistry at the physical chemical atomic level allowed us to understand the properties of chemicals.” Tom continued his education at Harvard University where, in 1966, he earned his PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology. After Harvard, he traveled to Cambridge, England, and worked in the Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), annually attending a week-­long meeting known as “Crick week” because “Francis [Crick] would sit in the front row and frequently ask many questions.” In 1970, Frederic Richards from Yale visited the LMB, and Tom asked if there might be a spot for him at Yale. There was. At Yale, Professor Steitz teamed with other faculty to form the Yale Center for Structural Biology, where his efforts focused on the study of the ribosome, “the major target of antibiotics.” Professor Steitz explains that the ribosomes are the binding site for 50% of the antibiotics used world-wide; however, because ribosomes mutate, a mutant ribosome can become resistant to antibiotics, requiring researchers to continuously develop new antibiotics. Professor Steitz is quick to point out that all the “intelligent design” that researchers produce cannot compete with the “evolution of bacteria.” Fortunately, ribosome research “allows us to have more information to enable the design of antibiotics.” Professor Steitz is gravely concerned about the misuse of antibiotics and the potential worldwide catastrophe of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nProfessor Steitz reflects that each of us wants to be remembered for doing good things and for being a good person. “I’ve had a lot of people in my lab who have gone on to do good things, and I hope they are happy for having been in my lab.” In particular, he would like to be remembered for the same qualities as Frederic Richards, the 1995 Connecticut Medal of Science Award, whom he sees as his hero. Fred Richards was “just an exemplary scientist, person and leader and we loved to follow him. I would like to be a Fred Richards who had the insight and wisdom to hire and cultivate other scientists.”\n\nSteven L. Suib came from a family where “everything and everyone was believed to be important.” His parents emphasized respect—regardless of culture, religion or background—and, at times, brought hitchhikers home for a warm meal. His grandfather, an artist, travelled the world painting portraits of notable leaders, providing a role model for an independent, adventurous life. Growing up in rural northwestern New York State, Steve was introduced to the natural world by his father, an entomologist, as they canoed remote areas and collected butterflies or waited into the darkness of night to photograph moths. Steven’s earliest introduction to chemistry took place in the family’s garage, where he mixed formulas for his father’s pest control business. These unique and varied influences coalesced to form Professor Suib’s “interest in understanding the relationships between many different things and solving fundamental problems to create a better world.” Dr. Steven Suib is a Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor at the University of Connecticut and the 2011 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Science Award.\n\nDuring high school, Suib was mentored by two outstanding chemistry teachers: Nora Keyser and Nancy Rodriguez. They allowed him to work in the lab “making solutions, grading papers, setting up experiments, and generally learning about the field of chemistry.” Later, he attended the State University of New York at Fredonia, where, for a very brief time, he majored in music. During his freshman year, a geology elective convinced him to combine his passion for the outdoors with his interest in chemistry. A later turning point occurred when he performed research involving crystal growth of semiconductors and ways to study these materials. Steven graduated magna cum laude in 1975 with a double major in geology and chemistry. His initial plan was to teach high school, but encouraged by his advisor, Paul Weller, Suib pursued doctoral studies at the University of Illinois at Champaign Urbana, where he earned a PhD in chemistry and completed coursework equivalent to a master’s degree in geology.\n\nFor the past ten years, Professor Suib has headed the chemistry department at the University of Connecticut. His work focuses on developing new approaches to solve fundamental problems, specifically in the field of catalysis and materials science and involves the synthesis of novel porous semiconductors used to make new chemicals for use in lithium batteries, oil spills, and other applications. The central question Professor Suib asks is, “Can we make materials that no one else has made using relatively simple materials?” In his quest to “make new things,” Suib and his team are investigating the creation of synthetic fuels using carbon dioxide—a greenhouse gas—and water, research that could contribute to both reduced greenhouse gases and the development of alternative energy sources. Professor Suib states, “It’s not easy to find ways around Mother Nature” and that is where inorganic catalysts that mimic nature become crucial to producing key results. His research team is working closely with VeruTEK Technologies, Inc, a Connecticut company dedicated to “innovative green technologies,” to clean up contaminated industrial and commercial properties and landfills using microemulsion catalysis that converts hazardous and toxic compounds into harmless materials. Other current research involves synthesizing high temperature ceramic fiber composites used for aircraft engine parts.\n\nOver the years Professor Suib has collaborated with industrial researchers in Connecticut such as United Technologies Research Center, Pratt and Whitney, Hamilton Standard, Olin, Yardney Technical Products, Pfizer, ATM, APSI, VeruTEK, Rogers Corporation, Uniroyal, Crompton and others. He is also the Head of the Pratt Center of Excellence in Ceramic Chemistry. These efforts have contributed immeasurably to Connecticut’s technological and economic development.\n\nHis advice to future generations is the same as his father gave to him – “recognize that everything is interrelated and important.” Professor Suib believes “if we can work hard, develop skills, and encourage creativity, then our most difficult problems can be solved.”\n\nPratt & Whitney has been selected as the 2018 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Technology in recognition of its accomplishments in creating the groundbreaking geared turbofan (GTF) technology with unprecedented reductions in fuel consumption and noise, representing an incredible technological achievement in mechanical engineering and aircraft propulsion. Numerous airline customers have chosen Pratt & Whitney’s PurePower® turbofan engines because of the superior architecture and performance, as well as economic and environmental benefits.\n\n“At Pratt & Whitney, we are in a very competitive industry and our continued success depends on our people driving innovation into every part, process and service,” said David B. Carter, Senior Vice President of Engineering. “From the smallest detail of our engine design to the last stage of our manufacturing line, they are continuously improving how our engines are designed, manufactured and serviced. In the GTF alone, we matured or invented at least 48 technologies to drive performance benefits and we have over 3600 patents and patent applications filed globally to protect our investment in innovative GTF architecture. These technologies go beyond the gear and include advancements to the fan blade, engine core, materials, monitoring systems and a host of others. Our customers have depended on Pratt & Whitney innovators literally for generations, and with the GTF, they can continue to count on us for the next generation.”\n\nPratt & Whitney has had a long-term commitment to and association with the State of Connecticut. “The State of Connecticut is proud to award the Connecticut Medal of Technology to Pratt & Whitney,” said Governor Dannel P. Malloy. “Connecticut is the proud home of some of the nation’s most talented aerospace and defense manufacturers and suppliers, and Pratt & Whitney is certainly among them. This company continues to conduct cutting-edge aerospace research, providing exciting new opportunities for top engineering and science graduates from our state’s colleges and universities. We applaud Pratt & Whitney for their ongoing innovations and continued commitment to the State of Connecticut.”\n\nPratt employs thousands of engineers and workers with headquarters, research and development organizations and production facilities in Connecticut. United Technologies Corporation, parent company of Pratt & Whitney, spent more than $10 billion on research before launching the GTF engine. With more than 8,000 engines sold to date, the GTF represents several hundred billion dollars of economic activity in Connecticut over the next few years.\n\nIn 1967, a Yale student wrote a wistful melody celebrating love’s tender memories. This song, Time After Time, became the second most frequently performed song by the renowned à cappella group, the Yale Whiffenpoofs. The student composer and Whiffenpoof musical director, Robert &quot;Pitchpipe&quot; Birge (Yale ’68), continued to compose — and went on to complete a few other noteworthy accomplishments as well, including creating a protein-based disk drive in1982, pioneering the use of spectroscopic and theoretical methods to study biological molecules, and most recently, working to develop an artificial retina that will bring functional sight to those who would otherwise be blind. Robert R. Birge is the Harold S. Schwenk Sr. Distinguished Chair of Chemistry, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Connecticut and the 2009 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Science.\n\nBob grew up on Long Island. His mother was a musician and his father a teacher who, while encouraging his interest in music and science, “didn’t push him in any way.” When he was 12, he wrote his own music, enjoying improvising and creating rather than traditional practice routines. He enrolled at Yale as a chemistry and music major. During a sophomore year music competition, his concerto was well received but did not earn top placement. He recalls that his professor did him “an enormous favor by pushing him towards the sciences.” After graduating with a B.S. in chemistry, Bob began graduate work at Wesleyan University. Studying chemical physics, he worked under the mentorship of Peter Leermakers on “high resolution molecular spectroscopy of retinals” to better understand how “light drives the isomerization of the retinal chromophore,” and creates a change in the geometry of protein molecules responsible for vision. Dr. Birge says he was always interested in understanding how systems operate at the molecular level and then moving to investigate the larger system functions, whereas many other scientists work in the opposite direction — analyzing the function of a system in order to understand the underlying mechanisms.\n\nHis research on protein molecules and their response to light led him to work with a 3.5 billion-year-old archaeal protein called bacteriorhodopsin, found worldwide in salt marshes. This simple protein is among the earliest life forms converting sunlight into energy and is similar to the visual protein rhodopsin. Researching bacteriorhodopsin provides insight into understanding how rhodopsin activates the nerve impulses essential for vision, paving the way for the development of an artificial retina.\n\nDr. Birge believes that his greatest contribution is the development of the artificial retina, now five to ten years from completion. His next most valuable contribution, he says, was as musical director of the Whiffenpoofs — and Time After Time. He suggests that young people “follow their dreams and find something to do that genuinely interests them” because if “you love something you will find your niche” and that passion will pull you through difficult times. Dr. Birge advises young people to “stay open to new opportunities and not always listen to your parents,” but do find ways to make meaningful contributions. Dr. Birge certainly has learned from his own experience; his vast contributions include over 225 refereed articles. He served on the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering Committee on Energy Alternatives and Conservation in 2007, established a new center for Nanobionics at the University of Connecticut, was elected to the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering and the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005, earned the 3M Award of Canada in Physical Chemistry and the Connecticut Innovations 2001 Annual Technology Award. Dr. Birge gives of himself tirelessly in his role as teacher and colleague, providing the University of Connecticut with an outstanding program that attracts top students and faculty to the state.\n\n“Doing science is like doing puzzles,” notes Dr. Michael Snyder, former Director of the Yale Center for Genomics and Proteomics and the recipient of the 2007 Connecticut Medal of Science Award. Dr. Snyder should know, since he studies one of science’s greatest puzzles—the mystery of the human genome. Dr. Snyder’s research provides explanations for how and why we are each different from one another, as well as helps scientists to “understand the basis of mutations and genetic disease.”\n\nMichael is the fifth child in a family of six children. He grew up in rural Pennsylvania, where his father worked as an accountant and his mother was a schoolteacher who instilled a “great curiosity about everything.” Michael spent much of his childhood playing outside, and helping care for the family’s pets and farm animals. It was in an advanced high school chemistry class that his formal interest in science was sparked by a teacher who gave Michael and his fellow students freedom to conduct their own experiments. Michael’s early achievements were recognized with the Bausch &amp; Lomb Honorary Science Award, paving the way for his entrance to the University of Rochester, followed by his graduate studies at the California Institute of Technology. At Cal Tech, Michael trained with Dr. Norman Davidson, a pioneer in researching recombinant DNA, and one of the most influential people in Michael’s career. While working with Drosophila (fruit flies), Michael discovered that a particular gene was inactivated by a piece of DNA that jumped around in the genome. This early discovery and his subsequent postdoctoral work with Dr. Ronald Davis at Stanford University, who stressed the value of creating one’s own tools, led Michael “to research fundamental biological questions with novel technological approaches.” At Yale, he pioneered approaches for studying thousands of genes and proteins at the same time.\n\nDr. Snyder uses a car analogy to explain his work. If we want to understand how a car operates, it is not enough to observe only one component: we need to observe how many parts are integrated and work together. It is the same with genes and their system of operation. In the past, scientists were able to study only one gene at a time, but by working with yeast and then later with human cells, Dr. Snyder developed techniques for identifying and characterizing the functions of thousands of genes and the proteins they encode simultaneously. One method developed in Dr. Snyder’s lab was the ChIP chip procedure for studying the hundreds of gene targets controlled by protein regulators. Dr. Snyder’s laboratory found that a major difference between species derives from how genes are regulated; this work is valuable for understanding how humans and chimpanzees are different. His laboratory also developed protein microarrays which allow researchers to discover the functions of proteins, and how they are regulated; they are also valuable for drug discovery because they help determine which drugs bind to which proteins to exert their effects.\n\nAmong his many awards and honors, Dr. Snyder received the 1987 Pew Scholar Award and the 2000 Burroughs Wellcome Scholar Award. He has been elected to the board of directors of the Genetics Society of America and is president of the US Human Proteome Organization. He has published extensively and founded Protometrix, a company that manufactures protein chips that can be used by other labs for drug discovery. Dr. Snyder encourages young people to “be curious and do your own thing.” He thoroughly enjoys his work and believes that discovering what you really like to do, asking questions and solving puzzles goes a long way in science. Snyder moved to California in July 2009 after being named chair of the Department of Genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\nImagine fluids flowing up the side of a container, rather than down. Now imagine levitated vehicles transporting us as if we were suspended in space. And finally, can you imagine super powerful computers that rely on qubits (quantum mechanical bits) to process information, enabling these computers to decode complex encryptions that otherwise are considered indecipherable? These are only a few of the many possibilities created by work being done in the field of quantum mechanical matter, a field of study that is of particular interest to Dr. William Stwalley, Chair of the Physics Department at the University of Connecticut and recipient of the 2005 Connecticut Medal of Science Award as well as the William F. Meggers Award of the Optical Society of America for outstanding work in spectroscopy, and the Chancellor’s Research Excellence Award at the University of Connecticut (UConn). He has been a member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering since 1994.\n\nDr. Stwalley was born in Glendale, California, but because of his father’s work as a quality control expert with Douglas Aircraft, his family moved many times in the southern California area. He fondly recalls those early years in Santa Monica, when he lived only eleven blocks from the beach and in the summertime, on his way home from the beach, he frequented a comic shop where he bought used comics for only a penny. He still has his comic book collection, including Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge, and at least one rare comic, valued today at somewhat more than a penny.\n\nWhile a student at Fullerton High School, the young Bill Stwalley found encouragement for his interest in mathematics from an “outstanding teacher, Mr. Redfern.” Mr. Redfern took Bill and his fellow students to regional and statewide math competitions where Bill not only won a slide rule and a scientific encyclopedia that he still has today, but he “got to see lots of other students and see how well we performed relative to others in California.” Later, he completed his undergraduate education at Cal Tech, where he majored in physical chemistry and began the study of diatomic molecules that he believes are “simple to understand and understand well.” After receiving his PhD from Harvard University, Dr. Stwalley continued research on these molecules and studied the very unique ways in which atoms and molecules react under extremely cold conditions, below 1°K (Kelvin). Unlike ordinary molecules, ultracold diatomic molecules do not collide like “billiard balls” and in some cases “go through each other.” Although this area currently involves basic research, there exist many possible applications of quantum mechanical matter. Dr. Stwalley expects many significant examples to evolve in the next few decades.\n\nDr. Stwalley finds UConn to be a very exciting environment because of the work being done on ultracold science and the contribution he is able to make by educating graduate students and “teaching them how to think well and develop their own ideas.” He believes that “young people need to know how to ask questions and know what they don’t know.” Dr. Stwalley has enjoyed observing his three granddaughters and their love for science, although he is concerned with the challenge of “stimulating scientific interest in young children and then maintaining that interest as children mature, particularly in light of competition from many forms of entertainment.” Dr. Stwalley would most like to be remembered as a good person, a good scientist and a good teacher who has contributed many exciting ideas over the years.\n\nFrederick J. Leonberger was honored with the 2014 Connecticut Medal of Technology for his outstanding accomplishments in the field of photonics and fiber-­optics, primarily in the area of electro-­optic devices. Dr. Leonberger is Principal of EOvation Advisors, LLC, and retired Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of JDS Uniphase Corporation.\n\nFor almost 40 years, Leonberger has been a leading contributor to his field not only in the development of a variety of important optical devices, but in product and business strategy, commercialization and overall company leadership. The integrated optical modulators he pioneered have been used pervasively for over 15 years to encode data at billions of bits per second in long-­haul fiber optic networks. Similar modulator devices are widely used to transmit CATV signals. These devices are manufactured in Bloomfield and that business has had a substantial economic impact on Connecticut (valued at more than $500 million).\n\nIn his early career with the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Leonberger developed a breakthrough analog-­to-­digital converter device, which incorporated micron-­scale guided-­wave modulator integration on a single chip. He joined United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in 1984 as manager of Photonics and Applied Physics. The major technologies developed in UTRC groups Leonberger led have all spawned commercial Connecticut businesses: United Technologies Photonics (UTP) in Bloomfield; CiDRA, in Wallingford; and DEOS, now part of Coherent, in Bloomfield. Aggregate revenue of these businesses over the past 15 years is estimated to exceed $1 billion.\n\nIn 1992, Leonberger co-­founded and became General Manager of UTP. In 1995, UTP was acquired by Uniphase Corporation and Leonberger went on to become Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of that company and continued in that role after the Uniphase/JDS Fitel merger. He retired in 2003 and founded EOvation Technologies (now EOvation Advisors), a technology and business advisory firm serving photonics and laser companies. In addition to advising senior management teams, he presently serves on the Board of Directors of four private venture-­funded photonics companies.\n\nA graduate of the University of Michigan, Leonberger holds a PhD in electrical engineering from MIT. He was elected to CASE in 1985 and to the National Academy of Engineering in 2000.\n\nWhile a typical kindergartener struggles with adding together two apples and three apples, Ronald Coifman, a most precocious preschooler, was “interrogating his elders” in order to understand multiplication facts, assiduously paving the way for his ascent to Computational Harmonic Analysis, a process that makes it possible to “extract information from complex patterns.” Dr. Coifman, best known for his work on wavelet packets—a mathematical shorthand for compressing and restoring images and sound—is a professor at Yale University. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the DARPA Sustained Excellence Award in 1996, as well as the Connecticut Medal of Science. He received the 1999 Pioneer Award from the International Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the 1999 National Medal of Science.\n\nDr. Coifman grew up in Tel Aviv. His parents were multi-lingual: his father spoke ten languages, and his mother was fluent in six. Because of the diverse population of newly developing Israel, Ronald was exposed to several different languages being spoken among his parents and neighbors all in a day. Since Dr. Coifman perceives math as a linguistic entity, complete with patterns and structures, his early exposure and facility to think in many different languages became a fundamental building block for his work, helping him extract information and transcribe that information into a mathematical language that he would later use to represent digital files.\n\nHis father was a chemical engineer and a “prolific inventor” who served as his mentor, engaging young Ronald in “extensive discussions on science and technology.” His father however, was not the only one to inspire him. Dr. Coifman recalls that the best teacher he ever had was his high school math teacher, Dr. Marshak, whom he credits with teaching him how to read. How to read? Of course, Ronald knew how to read in high school, but according to Dr. Coifman, what is too often assumed to be reading is merely skimming pages for content. What Dr. Marshak taught him was not how to simply read the words printed on a page, but how to systematically analyze mathematical constructs and question his understanding before progressing to the next level of complexity.\n\nDr. Coifman continued his education in Switzerland at the University of Geneva, majoring in mathematics and physics. He earned his PhD from the University of Geneva in 1965. Dr. Coifman states, “My work enables efficient representations of digital files, such as images, music, or scientific data. Various compression algorithms now in use such as JPEG or MPEG for image and video files are based on these methods. In our age, the ability to make sense out of massive digital data sets, whether medical data for diagnostics, or economic data for planning, or web documents is essential. Computational Harmonic Analysis is a basic component to enable this progress.” Currently, Dr. Coifman is working on projects to understand the mechanisms of learning, both machine and biological. He notes that some rudimentary but powerful mathematical foundations for such processes exist and can be used to organize and extract knowledge from vast digital data from medical to musical.\n\nDr. Coifman would like to impress upon young people that “mathematics permeates every activity in the information age. Just as it is essential to understand basic aspects of the law to survive and navigate the shoals of commerce, it is just as important to be proficient in the basics of mathematical thinking and organization. It is not difficult, but like a sport activity, it requires serious effort and training.”"
