        "text": "Profession: Biochemist\n\nBiography: Thomas A. Steitz was an American biochemist. He is best known for his work on the ribosome, which is a part of cells that makes proteins. Steitz, along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Ada Yonath, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 for this research.\n\nSteitz studied chemistry at Lawrence University and got his Ph.D. from Harvard University. At Harvard, he worked with William Lipscomb, who also won a Nobel Prize. Steitz then did research at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.\n\nSteitz and his wife, Joan A. Steitz, both worked at Yale University as professors. At Yale, Steitz worked with Peter Moore to figure out the structure of an important part of the ribosome. They published this discovery in the journal \"Science\" in 2000.\n\nSteitz later helped start a company called Rib-X Pharmaceuticals, which is now called Melinta Therapeutics. The company works on making new antibiotics based on the ribosome.\n\nBorn: August 23, 1940\n\nBirthplace: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Dragon\n\nStar Sign: Virgo"
