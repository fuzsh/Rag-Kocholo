Biophysicist and chemist Thomas A. Steitz won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, sharing the honor with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Ada E. Yonath. Steitz has extensively studied the molecular, chemical, and biological mechanisms of proteins and nucleic acids. At his laboratory at Yale, Steitz has mapped the position of hundreds of thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome, paying special attention to understanding how the ribosome is targeted for antibiotics. He has also refined the principles of ribonucleic acid (RNA) folding, stability, and RNA-protein interaction, provided the first detailed structural analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase, and studied the protein structure and mechanism of yeast hexokinase. His wife, Joan Steitz, is a biochemist at Yale, and their son, Jon Steitz, was a minor-league baseball pitcher in the Milwaukee Brewers' farm system.
