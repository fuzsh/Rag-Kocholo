The Hungarian champions finally found the „key“ for German THW Kiel 31:27 (13:13) and waiting for FC Barcelona in the historic final on Sunday – 18 hrs.\n\nAntonio Carlos Ortega had a lot of reasons for happiness this night as he finally broke the „bad luck“ against Alfred Gislason thanks to great defense with outstanding Mirko Alilovic who had leading role after he replaced poor Roland Mikler in 20th minute.\n\nVeszprem made first turnover in the last part of the first half, when Hungarians took lead 12:10 three minutes before the buzzer.\n\nThey were even more impressive at the start of the second half, when Ilic and Nagy put their team four goals ahead – 18:14 (37.).\n\n„Zebras“ didn’t want to give up lead by the only guy who passed the test tonight, Aron Palmarsson. Icelander netted eight goals in total, as much as the rest of dissapointing back-line with Duvnjak, Vujin and Jicha.\n\nTop of the Hungarian domination has been seen in 48 minute, when Veszprem was on +6 – 27:21, but the Lanxess Arena wanted more from the Zebras.\n\nThey gave them that pleasure, in 54th minute as only two for Hungarians – 27:25, but again, bomb of Momir Ilic, his seventh and „crazy“ save of fast-break by Mirko Alilovic (against Jicha) didn’t let rivals to make furious come-back.\n\nAt the end, two goals of Mate Lekai finished the job. Veszprem will play final after 13 years…"
