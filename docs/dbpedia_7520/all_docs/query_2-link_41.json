        "text": "One of the most important thing in my live is sport. I play handball. I was 10 years old, when I first learned how to play handball. Now I play in a handball team, in MÃ³r. (MÃ³r is near SzÃ©kesfehÃ©rvÃ¡r) Iâ€™m a play â€“ maker like a point guard in basketball. There are 14 girls in our team and we have a trainer. We have training twice a week and at the weekend we usually have a match. We play in a lower championship. This championship is unprofessional.\n\nMy favourite handball teams are MKB VeszprÃ©m and GyÅ‘ri Audi ETO KC. MKB VeszprÃ©m is a Hungarian handball club from VeszprÃ©m. VeszprÃ©m have won the Hungarian Championship a record 19 times and took the Hungarian Cup title an unprecedented 20 occasions. They are one of the three Hungarian clubs that have ever won a major European trophy, most recently in 2008, when they overcame Rhein â€“ Neckar â€“ LÃ¶wen and were crowned as the EHF â€“ Cup â€“ Winnerâ€™s Cup champions. GyÅ‘ri ETO KC is a Hungarian womenâ€™s handball club from GyÅ‘r. GyÅ‘r reached the final of the EHF Cup Winnerâ€™s Cup in 2006 and the final of the Champions League in 2009.\n\nLanguage: We speak in the team Hungarian, but sometimes we use English.\n\nIdentity: I study International Studies at Pazmany Peter Catholic University. Iâ€™m in the third year of international studies course at the university. If I graduate, I want to work and travel in the world.\n\nLanguage: At the university my lectures are Hungarian, but we study English and German.\n\nIdentity: The most important thing in my life is my family. I live with my family in SzÃ©kesfehÃ©rvÃ¡r near Budapest. I have two younger brothers, they are twins, but they arenâ€™t similar to each other, because they are fraternal twins. My brothers play football, but they donâ€™t play in the same team. Matyi is a goalkeeper and plays in Videoton, Csabi is a defender and plays in Puskas Ferenc Football Academy. I always visit their matches with my parents. I have a boyfriend, who is a soccer coach, so I always go to his matches too with my family. ðŸ™‚ We are a real sport family. I have a very close relationship with my parents and my brothers too. We spend a lot of time together, we are a cohesive family. ðŸ™‚\n\nLanguage: We speak at home Hungarian and sometimes I speak with my brothers German. My parents learned Russian and English."
