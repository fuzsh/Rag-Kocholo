Home ground is a massive and unfair advantage for german teams.

I don't like that the Final 4 is played in Germany. Home ground is a massive and unfair advantage for german teams.

More exciting and more fair IMO. Money talks though. I don't follow handball that close but I can imagine that the Final 4 is good business for the various federations and sponsors.\n\n33-28! Yeah.\n\nBalanced game because the referee joked with Karabatic . Several wrong decisions against the French. In the second part he just attacked up to 10m final . This factor more Saric made ​​a difference of course . What monster is Karabatic . Best in the world without a doubt . Attack and defend like nobody else. Saric must have been the starter. Vargas is good but does not have the quality of Saric who remains top 3 worldwide .\n\nPlaying Veszprem in the final. Not a surprise IMO, the hungarians have an amazing team. I can see it going either way tbh, but I'm hoping our star players will show up in this game.\n\nPlaying Veszprem in the final. Not a surprise IMO, the hungarians have an amazing team.

He´s a massive player but has not been at his level this season."
