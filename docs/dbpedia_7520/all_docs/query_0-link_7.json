Away at the home of Csurgói KK, Veszprém had to take seriously the 13th round against the team who dwells in the fifth position. The Hungarian Champion did take seriously the game and they beat Csurgói KK quite convincingly with 42:22.\n\nEven though they played without Chema Rodriguez and Christian Ugalde the team was rather really successful. The Iváncsik brothers scored 16 goals and Renato Sulic made also a 100 % performance with his 6/6.\n\nCsurgói KK – MKB Veszprém 22:42\n\nOther goal scorers: J. Stranigg 2, G. Iváncsik 10, T.
