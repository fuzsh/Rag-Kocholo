Today another match waited for MKB Veszprém KC, now in the Cup. The team had an easy win in the Hungarian Cup against SZESE, Győr’s male handball team who is playing in the second division in the National Championship. The “small” team started the match without a winning chance, but they really liked to play against one of the best European handball team and they also coped with them. The spectators of city of Győr were also curious because of Veszprém and they filled up the 1500 seats arena. The organizers couldn’t sell ticket on the spot, because they have been sold in advance booking. It was a rare moment in SZESE’s life, but it was holding just for a bit more than one hour. Veszprém won the match 42:28. Iman Jamali was the best in MKB, he scored 11 goals.
