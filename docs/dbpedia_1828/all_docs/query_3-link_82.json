        "text": "Pages\n\ndescription Page 1\n\nTHE CONTINUATION OF AN Historical and Political Discourse OF THE Laws & Government OF ENGLAND. (Book 2)\n\nTHE former times, since the Norman entry like a rugged Sea, by cross Winds of Arbi∣trary Vapours, in and about the Crown; and by Forrein Engagements from the holy Chair, made the true face of affairs cloudy and troublesome, both for the Writer and the Reader.\n\nHenceforward, for the space of Three hundred years next ensuing, Kings by expe∣rience and observation finding themselves unequal to the double chace of absolute Su∣premacy over the sturdy Laity and encroaching Clergie, you will ob∣serve to lay aside their pretensions against the Peoples Liberties, and more intentively to trench upon the Spiritualty, now grown to defie all Go∣vernment, but that of Covetousness.\n\nNor would these times allow further advantage to Kings in this work, they being either fainted by the ticklish Title of the Crown, hovering between the two Houses of York and Lancaster, or drawn off to forrein employments; as matters of greater concernment for the present well∣being of the Kingdom, or for the spreading of the fame of such as de∣sired to be renowned for valiant men.\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nIt will be superfluous to recount the particular atchievements former∣ly attained by these Ecclesiastical men; the former Treatise hath already said what was thought needful concerning that. For the future, I shall e∣ven premise this, that the ensuing times being thus blessed with a Truce, or stricter League between the Kings and Commons; the errours in Go∣vernment more readily do appear; the corruptions in natures of men more frequently discover themselves; and thereby the body of the Statute-Laws begins to swell so big, that I must be enforced to contract my ac∣count of them into a narrower compass, and render the same unto the Rea∣der, so far forth only as they shall concern the general stream of Govern∣ment; leaving those of privater regard unto every mans particular conside∣ration, as occasion shall lead him. For whatever other men please to insist upon, this I take for a Maxime, That though the Government of a King is declared by his Actions; yet the Government of a Kingdom is onely manife∣sted by ancient Customs, and publick Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnd because I have undertaken a general Survey of the Reigns of thir∣teen several Kings and Queens of this Nation, (for I shall not exceed the issue of Henry the Eighth) and to handle each of them apart, will leave the Reader in a Wilderness of particulars, hard to comprehend in the general sum; I shall therefore reduce them all into three heads, viz. In∣terest of Title, Interest of Prerogative, and Interest of Religion; the last of which swayed much the three Children of Henry the Eighth; the second as much in their two Ancestors, viz. Henry the Eighth, and Hen∣ry the Seventh; and the first in the three Henries of Lancaster, and three succeeding Kings of the House of York. And because Edward the Third, and his Grand-child Richard the Second, do come under none of these In∣terests, I shall consider them joyntly, as in way of Exordium to the rest, although the course of the latter was as different from the former, as Lust falls short of a generous Spirit.\n\nCHAP. I. A sum of the several Reigns of Edward the Third, and Richard the Second.\n\nSEveral I may well call them, because they are the most different in their ways and ends of any two of that race that ever swayed their Scepter; and yet the entrance of the first, gave countenance to the con∣clusion of the last. For the Scepter being cast away or lost by Edward the Second, it was the lot of his Son Edward the Third, a youth of Fif∣teen years of age, to take it up: he knowing whose it was, and feeling it too heavy for him, was willing enough it should return; but being over∣swayed by Counsels drawn from reason of State, and pressed thereto by those that resolved not to trust his Father any more, he wisely chose to manage it himself, rather than to adventure it in another hand. But that is not all: for as it is never seen that the Crown doth thrive after divorce from the Scepter, but like a blasted Blossom, falls off at the next gale of adversity; such was the issue to Edward the Second, his power once gone, his Honour followeth soon after: he had ceased to be King, and within a small time did cease to be Edward.\n\nHis Son, thus made compleat by his Fathers spoil, had the honour to\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nbe the Repairer of the ruines that his Father had made; and was a Prince which you might think by his story to be seldom at home, and by his Laws seldom abroad. Nor can it be reconciled without wonder, that Providence should at once bestow upon England, a courageous People, brave Captains, wise Council, and a King that had the endowments of them all. Otherwise it had out-reached conceit it self, that this small Island, wasted by the Barons Wars, the people beaten out of heart by all Enemies in the time of the Father, should nevertheless, in the time of the Son, with honour wade through so many difficulties of mighty Wars on every side abroad, and devouring Pestilence at home; and yet lay a plat∣form of an opulent, wise, and peaceable Government for future Genera∣tions.\n\nYet he had his failings and misfortunes; a great part whereof may be attributed to infirmity of age, which in the first part of his Reign was too little, and in the latter part too much. True it is, that Governours of the persons of Kings may in some measure supply defects of Non-age; but seldom where the Governours are many, and never if they be am∣bitious. And it was this King's fate to miscarry in both; for he had in his Youth Twelve Governours by constitution, and they, two supream by usurpation, viz. the Queen and Mortimer, till they were both consu∣med in the flame which themselves had kindled. And this disparity wrought somewhat unsuccessfully in the King's first War: For the gene∣rosity of his spirit (himself being young and active) minded his Coun∣cil to advise him employment in a forrein War, rather than they would adventure its motion at home, lest it might prove circular; which is most dangerous for Government, if the Prince be not under command of himself.\n\nThis first War was with Scotland, whose power was inferiour to that of France; the King young, and the danger nearer; and therefore though the last affront was from France, that more fresh in memory, and more poinant, yet the King was advised to give place, and speak fair, till he had tried masteries with Scotland, and thereby secured his Rear. This he wisely hearkned unto, and met with such a successful turn of Providence, that like an O Yes, before a Proclamation, gives warning to Scotland that the Wheel is turned upon them; and that there is somewhat more than humane motion in the matter, that exasperates the English upon an en∣terprize so often crossed by Providence hitherto; and the King also (be∣ing but a Souldier in hope as yet) to dare against those that had so shame∣fully foiled his Father, and also put himself already once to the Re∣treat.\n\nAnd yet there did concur a kind of necessity of second Causes; for the King found the Crown engaged, and the minds of the Scots so e∣late, as the English-man's case was not to live to fight, but to fight to live; and so imbittered against one another by the fierce Wars under the Barons, that nothing could quench the fire, but the withdrawing of the Brands into Forreign action; like some angry spirits, that spoil their own bodies, unless they chide or fight it out with others.\n\nIn the first brunt with Scotland, the King gained nothing, but under∣standing of the humours of some of his great Lords; which once purged out, he renews the War, prevails, and after ten years stir (wherein he be∣came a trained Souldier against the Scots) he wan the Cross, and then goes to play his Prize in France, to compleat his Crown with the Flower-de-luce: Which was the great work of the rest of his Reign, in which four parts\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nof five were victorious; the fifth and last was declining, like some Game∣sters, that win at the first, and for want of observation of the turning of the Dice, come off losers at the end.\n\nFor the King being rather satiated than satisfied with Victory and Ho∣nour, returned home to enjoy what he had, leaving his Son, the Black Prince, to pursue the War, and to act the Souldiers alone, who now began to honour his Valour above his Father's. But the Tide is spent, the Prince of Chivalry dies, the brave Commanders wasted; and the French, too sickle to continue subject to the English longer than needs must, tack a∣bout for another adventure, and make it plain, That France is too big to be Garrison'd by England, and that it will cost England more to hold it than to have it.\n\nHis Religion was more to the purpose, than of any of his Predecessors since the Norman times: He re••lected upon God in common events, more ordinarily than the general stream of the Clergie did in those days. He loved, if not adored, devout men and their prayers, and yet intentively disclaimed opinion of merits in the Creature. He saw the Pope through and through, loved him but little, feared him less, and yet lost neither ho∣nour nor power thereby.\n\nHis chief policy at home, was, to be much at home, great with his Peo∣ple, and they great with him: what the Parliament did, he accounted well done; he never questioned their power, though he was over-reached in questioning their Wisdom. For he that shall prefer his own wisdom above that of the Parliament, must needs think himself extreamly wise; and so much the more to know himself to be such. But the worst of his fate was, to live to his Winter-age, and after fifty years Reign, or more, to die in his minority under the rule of a woman of none of the best fame, after he had enjoyed the honour of greatest note in the Christian world in his days.\n\nSuch was not Richard the Second, though the onely Son of that fa∣mous Chieftain, the Black Prince of Wales, a renowned Son of a renow∣ned Father; but (as a Plant transplanted into a Savage soyl) in degree and disposition wholly degenerate, retaining a tincture of the light inconstancy of his Mother, and the luxuriousness of his great Grandfather Edward the Second; and running his course, he came to his end.\n\nHis entrance, however by colour of Inheritance, yet was a greater ad∣venture than his Predecessors, that came in by Election; upon the desig∣nation of his Father by his last Will, say some. For this man came in upon many disadvantages, both of time and person: The times were very troublesome, the Kingdom new wrapped up in a double War abroad, and (which is worse) flouded with distraction at home, contracted part∣ly by his Predecessor's weaknesses in his decrepit estate, partly by a new interest of Religion sprung up against the Papal Tyranny, from the Do∣ctrine of Wickliff; all which required a very wise Man, and a brave Com∣mander; in both which the King failed.\n\nReligion now began to dawn through the foggs of Romish Usurpations and Superstitions, aided thereto by a Schism in the Triple Crown, that continued forty years, with much virulancy abroad, and with as bad in∣fluence upon our Myters at home. Some of whom were called Clemen∣tines, others Vrbanists; and yet none of them all worthy of either of the names, in their proper signification. The Laity, though lookers on, yet were not quiet: For though Liberty be a hopeful thing, yet it is dan∣gerous to them that are not a Law to themselves, especially in matter\n\ndescription Page 5\n\nof Opinion; for that arraigns the Rule, and lays the way open to licen∣tiousness. And now that the Liberty from the Keys began to be taught as a duty of Religion, the inferiour sort meet with Doctrines of licentious∣ness, upon mistake of the notion; and will acknowledge no rule, now they must be all at liberty: And thus sprang up the insurrection of the Servants and Bond-men against their Lords and Masters under Cade and Straw; that might have brought the Commonwealth into a hideous Chaos, had not the Lords and Great men betimes bestirred themselves; and the King shewed an extraordinary spirit, or rather a kind of rage, that put it self forth beyond the ordinary temper of his mind. Much of this mis∣chief was imputed to Wickliff's Doctrine; for it is an ordinary thing to proclaim all evils concurring with the very joynt of Reformation, to be the proper fruits thereof: But I look upon it as a fruit of corruption, that endeavours to stop the breath of Reformation in the birth. And there is somewhat of a hidden influence from above in the thing; for it was not onely the Cup of England to be thus troubled, but France and other places had their portion suitable.\n\nThe King's minority rendred him unequal unto these contrary mo∣tions; he was in his Eleventh year, when he entred the Throne; and (which was worse) his years came on faster than his parts, but his work posted before them all. The common help of Protectors left him yet more unhappy; for they were prepossessed with strong engagements of particular Interests; and so were either not wise enough, or not good e∣nough for all. This brought forth a third inconvenience, the change of Protectorship; and that change of Affairs and Interests, an uncertain good that brings forth a certain evil; for variety of Instruments and Interests move several ways, and though the end be one, the difference concerning the way many times doth as much hinder the Journey, as so many blocks in the way.\n\nThe Protectorship was thrice changed; the King's Uncles had the first essay; any one of them was big enough for one Kingdom, but all of them together were too great to make one Protector. The Duke of Lan∣caster would have done well alone, if he had been alone, and minded that work alone; but he being somewhat engaged with the Wickliffists, and so entangled with the Clergy, and other restless spirits, and drawn off by his private aim at the Crown of Castile, saw this work too much; and so he warily withdrew himself, leaving the Directory to a Committee of Lords: a soveraign Plaister, questionless, where the times are whole; but not for these distractions, wherein even the Committee it self suffer∣ed its share. Thus the breach is made the wider; and for a cure of all, the Government is committed into one hand, wherein the Earl of War∣wick acquitted himself well, for he was wise enough to observe such as the people most honoured. And thus passed over the two first years of the King's Reign.\n\nThe remainder of the King's minority, was rather in common repute than in true account. For the King, however young, took little more from the Protector than he saw meet, to colour his own commands with opinion of Regularity; and so his Will came to full strength before his Wisdom budded. Thus lifted up, he sets himself above all interests of Parliaments, Protectors, Counsellors, Uncles, Wise men, and Law; lea∣ving them all to be rules for those below. And so long as the King's desire is thus served, he is content to be reputed a Minor, and be as it were under protection of others, though not under their direction; and\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nis content to continue thus until his Two and twentieth year. Some might think him very moderate, had he been moderate; but he forbears suing out his Livery, so long as he may live without care, and spend with∣out controul. For by this time the humour of his great Grandfather budded in him; he pawned his Heart to young men of vast desires, and some say so inordinately, as he prostituted his Chastity unto them. And it is no wonder if the Revenues of the Crown are insufficient for such Masters. This the people soon felt, and feared their own Free-holds: for they are bound, saith he, not to see the Crown deflowred for want of maintenance; it is very true, nor to see the Crown deflowred of its main∣tenance. A Parliament therefore is called; in which divers Lords asso∣ciate, and prepare Physick for the King's lavish humour; which being ad∣ministred, wrought for Ten years after, till it had purged him of his Life, and the Kingdom of their King.\n\nIt was an Act of Parliament that gave power to Fourteen Lords and others to regulate the profits and Revenues of the Crown, and to do Justice to the people; this was to continue for one whole year. The Parasites no sooner found the effect hereof to their cost, but the King grows sick of it, and finds an Antidote to over-rule Acts of Parliament, by Acts of Privy-Council; declares this ill-favoured Commission void, and the Contrivers, Advisers, and Enforcers, Traytors. To make it more Majestical, he causeth the Judges to subscribe this Order, and so it be∣comes Law in repute. This foundation thus laid, he buildeth in haste an Impeachment of these Commissioners of High Treason; and suppo∣sing that they would not readily stoop, himself stoops lower; for he would put his Right to trial by Battle, which was already his own by the judgement of the Masters of the Law: For so they may be well called, seeing they had thus mastered it. In this the King had the worst, for he lost his Honour and himself: God hath a care of common Right, even amongst Idolaters. Then comes the Parliament of wonders, wherein the Kings Party are declared Traytors, and the chief Judges with their Law jud∣ged by another Law. The King not meddled with, thinks it high time to come out of his Minority, and assumes the Government of the Kingdom, and himself, to himself, being now Three and twenty years of Age; old enough to have done well, if he had cared for it. But resolving to fol∣low the way of his own will, at length it led him to his own ruine. One∣ly for the present two things delayed it, viz. the Authority, Wisdom, and Moderation of his Unkles, especially of the Duke of Lancaster, now come out of Spain; and the great affection which the King pretended to the Queen, who had also gained a good opinion amongst the people. The benevolent aspect of the people, not for their own advantage, but for the publick quiet, procured many Parlies and Interviews between the King and people, and many Laws for the upholding of the Court and Government; although both War, Laws, Justice, and Councils, all are faint, as all is faint in that man that hath once dismann'd himself. This he perceives well enough, and therefore Peace he must have by a∣ny means. The Queen dies; himself being nigh Eight and twenty years old; takes a Creature like a Wife, but in truth a Childe of Eight years old, and this is to get peace with France. It is no wonder if now he hunts after unlawful game, and that being ill taken, brings all things out of order; For abused Marrige never wants wo. Civil men are now looked upon as severe Cato's; and his Unkles, especially the Duke of Glou∣cester, with a jealous eye; which accomplished his death in the conclusion.\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nThe Dukes of Lancaster and York forsake the Court, Favourites step into their rooms. The old way of the eleventh year is re-assumed; Belknap and others are pardoned, and made of the Cabinet. The pardon of the Earl of Arundel is adnulled, contrary to the advice of the major part; and the Archbishop, the Earl's Brother, is banished. The Lords forsake the wilful King; still the King's Jealousie swells. The Duke of Hertford is banished, or rather by a hidden Providence sent out of the way for a fur∣ther work. The Duke of Lancaster dies, and with him all hope of mode∣ration is gone; for he was a wise Prince, and the onely Cement that held the Joynts of the Kingdom in correspondency: And he was ill requited, for all his Estate is seized upon. The Duke of Hertford and his party are looked upon by the people as Martyrs in the Common Cause, and others as Royalists. Extremities hasten on; and Prerogative, now upon the wing, is towering above reach. In full Parliament, down goes all the work of the tenth and eleventh years Parliament: which had never been, if that Parliament had continued by adjournment. The King raiseth a power, which he calleth his Guard, of Cheshire-men; under the terrour of this displaying Rod, the Parliament and Kingdom are brought to Confession. Cheshire for this service is made a Principality; and thus goes Counties up, and Kingdoms down. The King's Conscience whi∣spers a sad message of dethroning; and well it might be, for he knew he had deserved it. Against this danger he entrenches himself in an Act of Parliament, that made it Treason To purpose and endeavour to depose the King, or levy War against him, or to withdraw his Homage, hereof being attainted in Parliament. And now he thought he was well guarded by engagement from the Parliament; but he missed the right conclusion, for want of Logick: For if the Parliament it self shall depose him, it can∣not be made a Traytor, or attaint it self, and then hath the King gained no more than a false birth.\n\nBut the King was not thus quiet, the sting of guilt still sticks within, and for remedy he will unlaw the Law; and gets it enacted, That all procurers of the Statute of 10 Richard the Second, and the Commission and procurers of the King's assent thereto, and hinderers of the King's proceedings, are adjudged Traytors. All these reach onely the Branches, the Root remains yet, and may spring again; and therefore in the last place have at the Parliament it self. For by the same it is further declared, That the King is the sole Master of the Propositions for matters to be treated in Parliament, and all gainsayers are Traitors.\n\nSecondly, That the King may dissolve the Parliament at his pleasure, and all gainsayers are Traitors.\n\nThirdly, That the Parliament may not proceed against the King's Justices, for offences by them committed in Parliament, without the King's consent; and all gainsayers are Traitors. These and the like Aphorisms once voted by the Cheshire-men, assented unto by the Parliament, with the Kings Fiat, must pass for currant to the Judges; and if by them confirmed or allowed, will in the King's opinion make it a Law for ever, That the King in all Parliaments is Dominus fac primum, and Dominus fac to∣tum. But the Judges remembred the Tenth year, and Belknap's enter∣tainment, and so dealt warily; their opinion is thus set down: It belong∣eth to the Parliament to declare Treason; yet if I were a Peer, and were com∣manded, I should agree. So did Thorning under-write; and thereunto also consented Rickill, and Sir Walter Clopton▪ the last being Chief-Justice of the King's Bench, the first Chief-Justice of the Common-pleas, and the\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nsecond another Judge of the same Bench. The sum in plainer sence is, that if they were Peers, they would agree; but as Judges, they would be silent. And thus the Parliament of England by the first of these four last-mentioned conclusions attainted themselves; by the second yielded up their Liberties; by the third their Lives; and by the last, would have done more, or been less: And to fill up the measure of all, they assigned over a right of Legislative power unto six Lords, and three Commons; and yet the King, not content, superadded, that it should be Treason for any man to endeavour to repeal any of their determinations.\n\nThe Commonwealth thus underneath, the King tramples upon all at once; for having espied the shadow of a Crown fleeting from him in Ire∣land, he pursues it, leaves the noble Crown of England in the base condi∣tion of a Farm, subject to strip and waste by mean men, and crosses the Irish Seas with an Army. This was one of England's Climacterical years, under a Disease so desperate, that no hope was left but by a desperate Cure, by sudden bleeding in the Head, and cutting off that Member that is a principle of motion in the Body. For it was not many Moneths e're the wind of affairs changed; the King now in Ireland, another steps into the Throne. The noise hereof makes him return, afar off enraged; but the nigher he comes, the cooler he grows; his Conscience revives, his Courage decays; and leaving his Army, his Lordship, Kingdom, and Li∣berty behind, as a naked man, submits himself to release all Homage and Fealty; to resign his Crown and Dignity, his Titles and Authority; to acknowledge himself unworthy and insufficient to reign; to swear never to repent of his resignation: And thus, if he will have any quiet, this wilful man must be content for the future, neither to will nor desire. And poor England must for a time be contented with a doleful condition, in which the King cannot rule, and the Parliament will not, and the whole body like a Chaos capable of any form that the next daring spirit shall brood upon it.\n\nCHAP. II. Of the State of the King and Parliament, in relation of it to him, and him to it.\n\nA King in Parliament is like the first-born of Jacob, The excellency of Dignity, and the excellency of Power; but alone, unstable as water. Examples of both these we have in these two Kings, Whereof the first was Crowned by the Parliament, and Crowned it; the latter also Crowned it, but with Thorns; and yet the Parliament in all held on that wise way, that it neither exceeded its own bounds, nor lost its own right.\n\nI shall enter into the consideration of particulars under these heads: First, In relation more immediately to the interest of the King: Secondly, To the interest of the Kingdom in general. The King, though higher than all the people by the head, and so hath the Prerogative of Ho∣nour as the most worthy, yet his strength and abilities originally do rise from beneath; otherwise, he is but like a General without an Ar∣my, the Title big, but airy; and many times his person subject to so much danger, that instead of drawing the Eyes of all the people to look upon him with admiration, they are drawn to look to him with ob∣servation;\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nand in this respect he may be said to be less his own man, and more the Kingdoms, than any of the inferiour sort. This befel in both these Kings in a special manner; each entring upon the grand Govern∣ment of a Kingdom, before they were able to understand the work, or govern themselves: and therefore were under power of Protectors for the guard of their Persons and their Education, and of the Parliament for Counsel and Direction in Cases relating to the Kingdom. The child of a mean man, when its Parents are dead, is Filius Amici; but a King is Filius Populi, to be by them trained up in such manner, that he may be Pater Populi when he is come to age. In the mean time, though he be a King, yet his Person like a precious Jem must not out of the Ring, but must be directed by Council, though under some kind of restraint, and the Counsellors all the while no Offenders in such cases against the Prerogative Royal. And therefore, though it be true that Kings grow faster than other men, and sooner come to full age than they; yet Edward the Third, now in his sixteenth year, might not pass over Sea into France, though it were for restoring of Peace, but by direction of the Parliament: nor is it meet in such cases, that Kings should stand upon the Prerogative of a Negative. Secondly, it may likewise be said, That his Family is less his own, as he is a man, than other mens: For private Families are no fur∣ther under the publick Law, than in relation to the publick Peace, to pu∣nish after breach made; but the Families of Kings are looked upon by all in relation to the honour and profit of the Publick; not onely because the King's servants have, by their nigh attendance upon his person, a more powerful influence into his actions, which may reflect a malevolent Aspect upon the whole course of affairs, if they be not better ordered that are so nigh him; but more especially in regard that the government and or∣der of the Royal Family trencheth deep upon the Honour of the King∣dom, and Purses of the People, who are concerned to see the same accom∣modated suitable to the State and Port which the Nation would bear forth to the World. And therefore for the Parliament to intermeddle in the King's Family, is not foreign nor new. Alice Piers was a Familiar, if not of the Family of Edward the Third; yet both her self, and others of that Fa∣mily, were complained of as a grievance. Richard the Second was once a young man, and ever a young King; and what Edward the Third wanted onely in his Youth, and in his infirm old Age, this man ever wanted: for he that knew not how to govern himself, how much less could he govern his Family? And if in this condition the Parliament become his Stew∣ards, to set a yearly Survey and Check upon his Servants and Family, in order to the good order of the same and Kingdom, other wise men must conclude, it did that which was just; though Richard the Second, and those of his mind, think not so. But this is not all; Kings have not onely such as serve the outward man, but some that serve their Consciences, of old time called Confessors; in these days without name, for fear of Super∣stition; yet the thing remaineth still in some well-favoured Chaplain, and their work is to lead the King's Conscience in dark ways, or rather into them. Commonly he hath a devout outside, and that is the King's Idol: but if while his eye be towards Jerusalem, his mind be towards the dead Sea, the King is his; and then the blind leads the blind: Like some Ignis fatuus, to such as know it not. No man is so well known by his company, as Kings are by these men, and these men by their actions. Although some have been so witty as to cheat the whole Generation of Mankind, by entertaining holy men to be their Chaplains; themselves the mean\n\ndescription Page 10\n\ntime without any spark of that holy Fire: Yet this King was not so cun∣ning; he had a Confessor of his own choice, and according to his own heart, who was complained of as a grievance, and the Parliament removed him. So nigh they ventured, even to invade the King's own Conscience, if it may be called Conscience, that will acknowledge no Law but that of its own mind.\n\nThirdly, the King's Revenue was under the check and controul of the Parliament; for it befals some Princes, as other men, to be sometimes poor in abundance, by riotous flooding treasure out in the lesser currents, and leaving the greater channels dry. This is an insupportable evil, be∣cause it is destructive to the very being of affairs, whether for War or Peace. For the King's Treasure is of a mixt nature, much of it being inten∣ded for publick service, as himself is a publick person. And for this cause he hath Officers of several natures attending upon his Treasury: Some for Land, some for Sea, some for the general Treasure of the Kingdom, some for that of the Houshold, and some for the Privy Purse. The common end of all being to maintain State in time of Peace, and Strength against time of War. Because it is no easie matter to maintain the just proportions for each of the said ends, it is the less wonder that such a brave Prince as Ed∣ward the Third should labour under want for maintenance of the Wars; and so lavish a Spendthrift as Richard the Second, should labour under more want to maintain his port and countenance in peace. And there∣fore, though it be true that the publick Treasure is committed to the King as the chief Steward of the Realm; yet it is as true, that he is but a Steward, and that the Supreme survey of the Treasure resteth in the Parlia∣ment, who are to see that the Treasure be not irregularly wasted, to reduce the same into order; and for that end to call the Treasurers and Receivers to account, to see to the punishing of such as are unfaithful, and encoura∣ging of others that are faithful. For when by extravagant courses the Treasure is wasted, by extraordinary courses it must be supplied; which ever is out of the Subjects Purses. And in such cases it is great reason that they should observe which way the course lies of such Expences. If then in such cases sometimes the Parliament hath stayed the issuing out of the King's Revenue for some time, or otherwise viewed and examined the same, charged it with conditions, 22. E. 3. n. 29. 14 R. 2. n. 15. limited it to certain uses, and in case of misuser, refused to levy or make payments; the case will be without dispute, that the Parliament ordered the publick Treasure as they saw most need. But much more, if we consider how the greatest part of this Treasure was raised. viz. not from the old Revenues of the Crown, but by new Impositions, Levies, and Assessments laid upon the People, even what they pleased, and in what manner they thought meet, and not otherwise. Aids are lawful, if they be legally given by common consent of Parliament. Taxes, if legally given by Parliament, are no less lawful; yet they must be collected in such manner, and by such means as the Parliaments Order doth direct. Loans of moneys to the King may be made by them that will; but the King must not demand them, because the Subject hath no means to recover the debt. This trick had been lately tryed by Edward the Second, much money he got, and it was repayed by the Order of the Parliament. But of all the rest, nothing shewed more abso∣lute Authority in the publick Revenue, than the care that was had of the Demesnes of the Crown: for whereas the Expxences of Kings grew so vast, that neither the yearly Revenue could suffice, nor Aids, Assessments; and Taxes could satisfie, however ordinary they in these times were become;\n\ndescription Page 11\n\nrather than Kings would contain themselves, they would invade their own Demesnes, by pawning, selling, and giving them away, either for love or money: and thus was poverty treasured up against the future, both for King and Crown. The Parliament espying this leak that was like to undo all, applyed a speedy remedy, undoing what was done, and undoing some by an Act of Resumption; and thereby taught Kings to look to their Honour better for the future, and People also to take heed of medling with such ticklish matters, and to know that he that hath such in his possession, hath them by a crack'd Title, that cannot be amended but by Act of Parlia∣ment.\n\nFourthly, an English King is no Out-law; nor can he do any wrong, though the man may. He hath a double relation, one as a King, the o∣ther as a Man; and the uniting of both in one person, hath cheated ma∣ny a man of his judgment in the case of Prerogative. He hath a double Will, and these many times contrary, equally as in other Relations; and in this contrariety, sometimes the King overcomes the Man, and sometimes the Man the King: so as if any man, the King hath much more cause to cry out, O miserable man! These divers Wills are ge∣nerally led by divers Rules: One of a man, which many times reacheth no higher than the Affections; and if the man be weak, they deserve little better name than Lusts. The rule of a King is Law, or Councils, of these in place; and unto these in all prudentials, he must submit his Judgment and Will, as he is a King. Nor can he do otherwise, unless he will presume to be wiser than his Council. Suitable hereunto doth that clause in one of the Statutes of these times conclude, viz. That the King is bound by his Oath, to pass all Laws that are for the good of the King∣dom. For were the power of Election, or determination of the point, onely in the King, then were the Oath in vain; nor is the Parliament at all (in case of the King's dissent) to judge of the convenience or incon∣venience of Proposals made for the good of the whole body, according to that power which is exercised in these times. Nor is it rational to in∣fer here from that, if Law and Council be the Rule of a King, then the Obedience of the People unto this King must be in order to Law and Council, otherwise the Disobedience cannot be determined to be against the King, but against the Man; and though against the private Will of the Commander, yet not against the Law; nor therefore can it be said illegal or unjust. The Parliament in these times held forth this Doctrine plainly to the World, That it is their proper work, in Cases needful, to do right to such as are wronged by the King: his Command is no Warrant in such Cases. If a man be wrongfully imprisoned by him, he shall be re∣leased and set at liberty by them. Let his Act be never so authentical under the Broad Seal, it can take no man's Right away. Richard the Second did his utmost to satisfie and quiet the tumultuous Rabble under Cade and Straw, and granted store of Manumissions to the Bond-men by Declaration, and by his Letters-Patents; but not one of them good enough to deprive any one of the meanest of the Free-men of their Rights in those Bond-men. The priviledge of shewing mercy, and granting pardon, hath been anciently betrusted to the King, as an Overseer of the execution of Law; yet he hath not that Prerogative, To have mercy on whom he will have mercy. Ever since this Nation had learned to read the Bible, Murther hath been excepted from mercy; nor did the Law ever allow any King that Prerogative to pardon that. Edward the Third did not challenge any such, not onely bound thereto by his Coronation-Oath,\n\ndescription Page 12\n\nbut by publick Acts of State declaring the same: yet because the Parlia∣ment was not always sitting, and Kings were ever subject to this Tem∣ptation, to favour Servants by granting mercy to Malefactors; a gene∣ral Rule of Inhibition is made against all pardon to be granted by the King in case of Felony, but onely in cases allowed by advice of the Council. It is true, that in the first times of Richard the Second, he liked not to be thus girt in his power, which he pretended was more at liberty in his Predecessors; possibly he meaned King John, and Edward the Second, who many times did what they listed: yet under his fa∣vour, no Law was so shameless, as to hold forth such a power, till Ri∣chard the Second's Law countenanced it. But why do I call it a Law, which is onely a Declaration by consent of the Lords, such as then were? the Commons would never own such an Opinion: And therefore it soon proved abortive; for within three or four years, by publick Act of Par∣liament, it is peremptorily declared, That the King's Pardon shall not extend to Murther. So as upon the whole matter it is plain, That it is not the King's Will, though supported by the Council of Lords, and backed by the Opinion of the Judges, that must be a Rule for the Government of this Kingdom; nor doth any Allegiance bind Obedience thereunto, in case where Ju∣stice or the Liberty of the People is concerned.\n\nThree things yet remain which Kings have claimed to be their own, viz. Conferring Titles of Honour, and Places of Trust, and the Legislative Power. The first is but a Feather, and not worthy of regard; yet it is plain that these times produce many precedents of Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls, made in Parliament; and possibly it may be apparent, that the first motion of any such Title of Honour, did first fetch its original thence, if not in the Field: but it is not worthy of the labour. The second is more considerable; viz. The power of conferring Places of Pub∣lick Trust: This Kings have pretended unto, although in course of con∣gruity it will be thought more meet, that it belongeth rather to that chief and grand Trust of the whole Kingdom committed to the Parlia∣ment: And the practice of these times is not much discrepant, whether we regard such as are for advice or execution. Of the first of these, are those whom we commonly call, the Privy Council, whose advice in course toucheth first upon the King's Person, but by reflection worketh strong impressions upon the People, so far as the influence of the King's power extends. And therefore it is not beyond the Sphear of the Par∣liament to interpose and qualifie that influence, so as it may be for the general good of the whole Kingdom. For many times Kings are either above or beneath themselves; and in such cases, if the Council be of the King's suit, he is of the deeper dye, and proves more Malignant to the People. Edward the Third, growing into great opinion in the World, his proportion exceeds his own portion, and the Peoples good wills to boot; they think the fault is in the Privy-Council, and an In∣quisition is set upon it. So also they do in his fiftieth year, when he grows downward. And the like in the beginning of Richard the Second's Reign, he being now a Youth, and therefore unstable in his Resoluti∣ons, and unable to make Election. So as upon the whole matter, if the King fall short in point of Judgment or Resolution, or inordinate in his Affections; but more especially where they observe the major, or more considerable part of the Council to draw towards a designe; in such cases as these, the Parliament, as its own duty, undertook to settle a good Council about the King's person, that might advise him\n\ndescription Page 13\n\nduring their recess. For the Privy-Council is never more it self, than when it is an Epitome of the Common-Council of the Kingdom. In like man∣ner such Officers as concern execution of Law and Counsel, are as nar∣rowly to be enquired into: for if their motion be irregular, it is less ma∣terial what the rule be. The Parliament therefore held it their duty to interpose in the Election of grand Officers of the Kingdom, such as are the Chancellors, Judges, and Justices; or to confirm or displace them, or bind them by Oath. The Rolls of the eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and thir∣ty-sixth years of Edward the Third; and the sixth, tenth, and eleventh years of Richard the Second, do manifest this sufficiently.\n\nI have done with the Subject-matter, or work of the Parliament, in the mutual relation of the King and it; the manner of proceeding was ei∣ther joyntly with the King, or without him; and either joyntly with the two Houses, or severally; and either immediately by themselves, or their Committees. As touching the first, it is evident, that in all matters where∣in gain ariseth to the Crown from the people, by Subsidy, or otherwise, the strength of the Grant by Act of Parliament resteth in the two Hou∣ses; and that the King's Assent is but pro forma, as touching that matter; and therefore such Grants have been made as tended in some measure to derogate either from the King's Wisdom, care, or fidelity; yet even these have passed with the Royal Assent, though the full Assent or good will of the person of the King was not correspondent thereto: as in these Cases formerly noted, where Subsidies were given with Limitations and Condi∣tions, and upon rendring account to the people. And it is as evident, that where the King's person is disabled to understand, (as in case of In∣fancy) there the Royal Assent can bear little weight with it; but most of all in the King's absence, where either the Assent is put thereto by Commissioners, that know not the King's particular mind, or the Act is done onely by the Houses, in nature of Ordinances; and yet these of force to bind all parties but the King. But nothing more debased the Roy∣al Assent in these times, than a trick that Edward the Third plaid in the midst of the fullest strength of his Government. It was in time of War, which never is time of good Husbandry and laying up, nor of sober ad∣vice in laying out, nor of equity in levying and collecting moneys for the Nerves of War. This forward Warrier, in the heat of his Atchieve∣ments, finds his strength benummed for want of money; he leaves off, comes home, rages against his Archbishop, to whom he had committed the care of provision for his War; and the Archbishop as hotly falls upon some of the Treasury in the Army on the one side, and upon others in the Country; whose oppressions, saith he, instead of bringing in money, made the people to give a stop thereto. A contest hereupon thus had, it was concluded by the power of the Parliament, that such men should be questioned, and that the Parliament from time to time should call all Of∣ficers of State to account: and thereupon ensues a calm. After the Par∣liament ended, the King repeats the matter; it makes his heart sick; he disgorgeth himself by a Proclamation, made by advice of Nobles, and Wise men, as he saith; and tells all the World he dissembled with his Parlia∣ment; and what he did was done by duress of mind, to please for the time, and to gain his ends; which being now had, he by his Proclama∣tion revokes what he had done in Parliament, or endeavoured it. And thus is England put to School to learn to dissolve three hard knots: First, Whether a King can dissemble with his Parliament? Secondly, Whether Ed∣ward\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nthe Third his dissembling assent makes a Law? Lastly, Whether by a Proclamation, by advice of Nobles and Wise men, he can declare that he dis∣sembled with his Parliament, and therein not dissemble the Royal Assent, so as to bring all the Laws made in any Kings time into question, at least during his Life? However the result may be, it is evident, the Royal Assent gets no honour hereby, and the Statute as little, that hath suffered this Proclama∣tion all this time to pass among the number of the Statutes in Print as a Law, whenas many Statutes that are Laws of not, are left out as use∣less.\n\nAlthough in the general, the two Houses joyned in every Act Ad ex∣tra, yet Ad intra, and in relation one to another, they had their several operations; the House of Commons intermedled more in the matter of Fact, the House of Lords in matter of Right; although in either of these there is a mutual aspect from both. In matters of Judicature, much re∣sted with the Lords, and therefore it is ordained, that, The House of Lords shall remedy all offences contrary to the Law of Magna Charta. And in cases where no remedy is left, nor Judgement by the Law, the matter shall be determined in Parliament, and the King shall command execution to be done according to the Judgement of the Peers. Which Laws seem to be but declarative of the former Law, and in the nature of revi∣ving that power into Act which was formerly laid asleep; and doth strongly imply that the ultimate act in Judicature rested with the Lords, in relation not onely to the House of Commons, but also in relation to the King, whose work in such cases is, not to judge above or with the Peers, but to execute their sentence. And that carries with it a List, whereby the power of a King may appear not to be so Supreme in ma∣king of the Law, as some would have it: for if his Judgement and Conscience be bound by the Votes of the Peers in giving a Law, in case of a particular person where the Law was not formerly known, let others judge of the value of this Negative Vote, in giving Law to the whole Kingdom. It is true, that this Parliament was quarrelled by the King, and he kept it at a bay by a Proclamation that pretended Re∣vocation, as far as a Proclamation could revoke an Act of Parliament; but it effected nothing, nor did the contest last long. Now though this Jurisdiction thus rested in the House of Lords, in such cases, as well as in others; yet is it not so originally in them, as to be wholly theirs, and onely as they shall order it. For the Commons of England have a right in the course and order of Jurisdiction, which (as the known Law) is part of their Liberty; and in the speedy execution of Justice, as well as they have right to have Justice done. And therefore, where∣as in Cases of Errour, and delays, the Appeal was from the inferiour Court to the Parliament; which immediately determined the matter, and now the trouble grew too great by the increase of pleas: For reme∣dy hereof, a kind of Committee is made, of one Bishop, two Earls, two Barons, who by the advice of the Chancellor, Treasurer, and the Judges, shall make good judgement in all Cases of Complaint of delay in Judgement: which Committee is not made by Order of the Lords alone, which they might have done, in case Jurisdiction had been whol∣ly and onely shut up in their custody; but by Act of Parliament, and joynt concurrence of the Commons with the Lords. For as the Com∣mons challenge speedy Execution of Justice, as one of their Liberties: so also to be under the Jurisdiction of such Judges, and Courts, as the Laws (in the making whereof, themselves challenge a vote) do establish and appoint.\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nI will conclude this Chapter with the Constitution of the Parliament in these times. For, the difficulties that befel between the Kings and their people, or Houses of Parliament, wrought two sad effects, viz. A propensity to decline calling of Parliaments so often as was used and ex∣pected; and when it assembled, as great a propensity in the Members to de∣cline their attendance: by means whereof, as the Historian tells us, the Parliament was sometimes enforced to adjourn it self for want of num∣ber sufficient. The first of these arose from want of good will in the Kings; the other, from want of Courage and Zeal in the people. The first of these was fatal and destructive to good Government: for though in distempered Parliaments it is good to withdraw, yet in distempered times it is necessary to meet, and gain a right understanding of all par∣ties; and therefore these times were so happy as to bind themselves by publick Acts of State to re-continue the assembling of Parliaments. For the face of the Times represented unto all, that agitations were like to be quick, violent, and to continue for some succession of time. It is therefore safe, if not necessary, that every eye should be open, and Councils ready for every occasion. A Law at length is agreed upon, that A Parliament shall be holden once every year, or more, if need be But in Thirty years the power of this Law is wasted out of mind, and the evil reviving, revives also the Statute; and yet they had Thirteen or Fourteen Parliaments in Thirty years space, and not above Three, or but once Four years distance of time between any Two of them in Succession. This was the sence of the Members of the Houses in their meeting; but at home, they had homely conceits; and it is found no less difficult to bring them to the meeting, than to continue the mee∣ting according to the Law; being either loath to adventure their thoughts into the troublesome affairs of the Publick, or their persons to expence and hazard. But the publick must be served; and therefore an Act of Parliament is made, That all such Members as decline their ap∣pearance at the Parliament, after Summons made, shall be amerced, and the Sheriffs likewise that shall neglect return of Summons. And the Statute implyeth that it was no introduction of a new Law, but a reviving of for∣mer Law now or lately disused, or a Custom now out of custom. And to take away all objection in point of charges and expences, another Law was made to establish the Assessments, and levying of their wages, upon the Lands that anciently were chargeable therewith, in whose hands so∣ever the same shall come.\n\nI shall conclude with this, That the Parliament, though, like a Gar∣ment, it sometimes covers the goodly feature and proportion of a well∣composed body, yet it keeps the same warm, and as a Shield is first in all dangers, and meets with many a knock which the body feels not; this is their work and reward. It is true, that in the wearing it is felt heavy; but it is the easier born, if it be duly considered, that it is better to be so cloathed, than to be naked.\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Privy-Council, and Condition of the Lords.\n\nTHe latter must make way for the former; for according to their personal esteem in their own Countries, such is their Authority at the Board in joynt Councils. And it was one point of happiness in a sad time of War, that all men looked one way. The Lords were much ad∣dicted to the Field, and could do much with Edward the Third, who was a brave Leader; and more with the people, who had been so long time used to the rough Trade of Souldiery, that they loved not to be at home about matters of Husbandry, wherein they had so little experience. And having so fair a Garland in their eye as France, it is no wonder if dome∣stick designs seemed meaner, or more dangerous. Thus did God do En∣gland a good turn, although it was made for the present thereby, neither so rich or populous as it might have been in a time of Peace. This French heat wasted many a tumultuous Spirit, and ennobled the Fame of the King and Lords; not onely abroad, but won them much Honour and Repute of those that remained at home; and so by congregating Homogeneals, and severing Heterogeneals, rendred the body of the peo∣ple more Univocal; which tended much to the setling of the Joynts of this distracted Nation. A timely birth hereof, doubtless, was the peace∣able entry of Richard the Second upon the Throne, and quiet sitting there; whilst as yet he was but a Child, the Princes of the bloud many; and they of generous, active, and daring Spirits: yet do we not meet with a whisper in story of any turbulent or aspiring humour in them or the people, during those tenderer times of that King's Reign. But after that he came to know more in himself than was to be found; and to outreach his abilities, having some of the Lords ready at his Elbow to help him, these changed the King's course, although the general part of that noble Band kept still their Array; and retaining the body of the people in due composure, thereby declared themselves to be the King's Friends, though the others were Richard's Favourites; so as he was fain to stoop to oc∣casion, and submit to be a King, that would have otherwise been more or less. And thus the Lords were become Supporters to the Crown, Studds to the Throne, and a Reserve to the People, against the violent motions of an unbridled mind in their King; who seeing them so united, and endeavouring to break them into parties to obtain his desire, lost both it and himself. It is a degree of cleanly modesty, to impute the miscarriages of unruly Kings, to their Council. For however during their minority, Counsellors are more rightly Officers of State; yet when Kings will be their own men, their Counsellors are no other than the breath of the King's own breast; and by which a King may be more truly discerned, than any man by his Bosom-friends. Edward the Third was a man of a publick Spirit, and had a Council suitable to his aim. Richard the Second, a man that desired what him pleased, would have what he desired; and a Coun∣cil he had that served him in all. For God answers the desires of mens hearts in Judgement as well as in Mercy; and a sore Judgement it is both to King and People, when the corrupt desires of the King are bac∣ked by a flattering Council.\n\nIt must be granted, that the Privy Council of Kings hath been an old\n\ndescription Page 17\n\nGinn of State, that at a sudden lift could do much to the furthering of the present estate of publick Affairs. Nevertheless, through the Riot of Kings, their designes generally tended to make more work for the Parlia∣ment, than to dispatch; to do much, rather than well; like works for sale, rather than for Master-piece; and sometimes to undermine, yea, to out-face the Parliament it self, like some unruly Servants that will put away their own Masters. Nor can it otherwise be expected, unless the King's elected ones be turned into the Parliaments Committee; or that constant annual Inquisition by Parliament be made into their actions: for occasional inquiries breed ill blood, though no attainder be; nor are they easily undertaken, whereas constancy in such cases makes the worst to be resolved but into a matter of common course.\n\nThe natural and original power of the Privy-Council is very obscure, because there are several degrees of them that occasionally have been used, all of whom may deserve the name of Privy-Council, in regard of the Parliament, which is the most publick Council of all the rest, and always hath a general interest in all Causes in the Kingdom.\n\nThe first of these, is that which was called The Grand Council of the King, which, as I think, was not the House of Lords, who are called by Sum∣mons, and were onely to attend during the Parliament; but a body made up of them, and other wise men of his own Retinue: And of this, it seems, there was a constant body framed, that were sworn to that service; for some in these times were sworn both of the Grand Council and the Pri∣vy-Council, and so entred upon Record.\n\nThe second of these Councils was also a great Council, and probably greater than the other; but this was called onely upon occasion, and con∣sisted of all sorts, like a Parliament, yet was none. An example where∣of we have in the Ordinances concerning the Staple, which at the first were made by the King, Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Lords, and Great men of the Kingdom, one out of every County, City, and Burrough, called together, for that end; their results were but as in point of trial for six Moneths space, and then were turned into Statute-law by the Parlia∣ment. These two are Magna Concilia, yet without power, further than as for advice; because they had no ancient foundation, nor constant con∣tinuance. Another Council remaineth more private than the other, of more continual use, though not so legally founded; and this is called the King's Privy-Council, not taking up a whole House, but onely a Cham∣ber, or a Table; signifying rather communication of Advice, than power of Judicature, which more properly is in Banco. And yet the power of this grew as virile and Royal, as it would acknowledge no Peer but the Parliament, and usurped the representative of it, as that had been of the whole Kingdom. The ambition thereof hath ever been great, and in this most notoriously evident, that as it had swallowed up the Grand Council of Lords, it seldom can endure the mention of a Parliament, but when Kings or Affairs are too rugged for their own touch. The Platform of their power you may behold in this their Oath.\n\n1. That well and lawfully they shall counsel the King accor∣ding to their best care and power, and keep well and lawfully his Counsels.\n\n2. That none of them shall accuse each other of any thing which he had spoken in Council.\n\n...\n\ndescription Page 18\n\n3. And that their lawful Power, Aid, and Counsel, they shall with their utmost diligence apply to the King's Rights.\n\n4. And the Crown to guard, and maintain, save, and to keep off from it, where they can without doing wrong.\n\n5. And where they shall know of the things belonging to the Crown, or the Rights of the King, to be concealed, intruded up∣on, or substracted, they shall reveal the same to the King.\n\n6. And they shall enlarge the Crown, so far as lawfully they may, and shall not accounsel the King in decreasing the Rights of the Crown, so far as they lawfully may.\n\n7. And they shall let for no Man (neither for love nor hate, nor for peace nor strife) to do their utmost (as far as they can, or do understand) unto every man, in every Estate, Right, and Reason and in Judgement; and doing right shall spare none, neither for Riches nor Poverty.\n\n8. And shall take of no Man without the King's leave, unless Meat or Drink in their Journey.\n\n9. And if they be bound by Oath formerly taken, so as they cannot perform this without breaking that, they shall inform the King, and hereafter shall take no such Oaths without the King's consent first had.\n\nAll which in a shorter sum, sounds in effect, that they must be faith∣ful Counsellors to the King's Person, and also to his Crown; not to de∣crease the true Rights, but to enlarge them; yet all must be done lawful∣ly. And Secondly, that they shall do right in Judgement, to take no Fees, nor any other Oath in prejudice of this.\n\nThe first of these concern the publick onely at a distance: and yet the point of encreasing and diminishing of the Crown in the sixth Section is captious, and may sound as if there is a legal enlarging of the Crown, whereof he that takes the Oath is to judge. A matter which onely and properly concerns the Parliament to order and determine, or else farewel all liberty of the people of England.\n\nThe second concerneth immediately the King in his politick capacity, but trencheth upon all Laws of the Kingdom, in the executive power; and all the motions in the whole Kingdom, either of Peace or War, fol∣lowing in the Rear, either immediately, or mediately, are under this notion interested into the transaction of the Privy-Council, to debate and determine the King's Judgement therein, unless it will determine alone. And how easie a thing it is for such as have power of deter∣mining the Action by the Law, to slip into the determining of a Law upon the Action, and so to rule by Proclamation, experience taught suc∣ceeding times sufficiently. Nevertheless, in these times Parliaments were every moment upon the wing, and kept this Noble Band in awe, by ta∣king them into their Cognizance, placing and displacing some or all of them, directing and binding them by Oath, as they saw occasion; of which the Records are full and plentiful. I say, these times thus consti∣tuted,\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nadded yet further encouragement to them, by giving them powers by Statute-Law, over and beyond what by ancient Custom they had ob∣tained.\n\nThe King, and Council of Lords, had anciently a power of Jurisdi∣ction, that hath been in the first Part of this Discourse already observed; yet it is very probable, that it was not any select company of Lords, but the whole Association. For it is granted by all, that they had originally a principal hand in the Jurisdiction; and it is hard to conceive how any private number should catch such a power, if not by usurpation. But the manner of acquiring is less materal; the principal consideration re∣steth upon the quality of this Jurisdiction. For it is evident that much difference hath been, both concerning the place and manner of exercising this Authority. In general, it must be granted, that all Pleas Coram Re∣ge, were grounded upon Writs first purchased, and returnable either in Banco, or in Camera, or in Cancellaria. And no difference at all will be concerning the Jurisdiction in Banco; for that was by the course of the Common-Law, and the people held it one of their Liberties to have one known course of Law, for determining matters of right and wrong. As touching these Pleas, which were holden by Writs returnable in Camera, they were properly said to be Coram Rege & Concilio, whose meeting was in the Council-chamber, in those days called the Star-chamber. For o∣ther returns of Writs in the Star-chamber do not we find, but such as were in Camera; nor Prohibitions from thence, but under the notion of the King's Council; and this Camera, as I said, was the place of the joynt meeting of the Council, as well of those of the Chancery and Benches, as of those that attended upon matters of State. Now the influence of Society in point of Judicature, principally aspected upon some Pleas be∣longing to the Crown: although even these also properly were deter∣minable in the King Bench. Nor can I observe any rule to bound the powers of these two Judicatories, but this, that the Council-Table would pick and chuse, and prohibit the Kings Bench as they pleased; and to that end would order Originals out of the Chancery, as they thought most meet. For it is observed by Fleta, that the Kings-Bench hath no juris∣diction of it self, but by special Warrant; that is to say, by Original Writs returned thither. Nevertheless, it may seem that such Crimes as are con∣trary to common honesty, or the publick profit or peace, in a more ex∣emplary way than ordinary, and therefore may be called Crimina laesi Regni, or against the State; these, I say, might more properly belong to the sublime Judicature of the Council-Table; as knowing better how far the publick State was interested, or endamaged in such Cases, than the other Judges that were experienced onely in ordinary matters of a more private concernment.\n\nTo recite the particular Cases upon record, concerning racing of Re∣cords, Forgeries, and other crimes of Falshood, Conspiracies, Combinations, to abate and level the prices of Commodities, Riots, and such-like, will be supersluous. In all which, and others of that Cognizance, the Sen∣tence exceeded not Fine and Imprisonment, or Ransom. Neither yet were the Common pleas so rural, but the Council Table could relish them also, and digest them well enough; and therefore did not stick to prohi∣bit the Courts of Common-Law, under colour of a strange maxime; That it is neither just nor honest for a man to be sued at the Common-Law, for a matter depending before the King and his Council: No, though the Court of Common-law had the precedency. And therefore, although the right\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nof Tythes being depending at the Common-Law, the Archbishop in op∣position to the Jurisdiction, sueth before the Kings Council; and the pro∣ceedings at the Law are thereby stayed. And no wonder; for the Coun∣cil-Table challenged to hold the ballance of all Courts of Law within their own Order: and so if any doubt concerning the Jurisdiction depen∣ded, the Council-Table gave the word, and all stooped thereto. But e∣nough of the Subject-matter; the manner follows: a new form of Pro∣cess is taken up, that the Common-Law and ancient Custom never knew; and which grew so noisom to the people, that complaints are made there∣of as of common grievance, and remedies are thereto applied by the Laws of these times. For whereas by the Grand Charter nothing could be done in Judgement, but according to the Laws of the Land; and in affirmance thereof, a Law was made in these times, that no Accusation, nor Attachment, nor forejudging of Life or Member, nor seisure of Lands, Tenements, Goods or Chattels, should be against the form of the Grand Charter, and Law of the Land: This course of affairs grew so stale, that amongst other innovations, a trick of a new kind of Trial is brought forth, by suggestions upon Articles exhibited against any man before the Council-Table; and thereupon issued forth Attachments against the party complained of; by means whereof, and other courses, (for they could also sequester) much vexation arose unto the people. Here∣unto, upon complaints multiplied, a remedial Law is made; whereby it is Enacted, That all such suggestions made, shall be carried to the Chan∣cellor, Treasurer, and the King's Grand Council; and the Informer shall find Surety to prosecute with effect; and to incur the like penalty inten∣ded for the Defendant, if the Plaintiff's proofs be not compleat: and then the Process of Law shall issue forth, and the Defendant shall not be ta∣ken against the form of the Great Charter; that is, he shall not be taken until first the fault appear upon Record, by Presentment, or by due Process, or by original Writ, according to the ancient Law of the Kingdom. Ei∣ther therefore the Privy-Council had no power to hold any Pleas at all, or else no power of Trial. The first of these was concluded in open Parliament; and the second as good as so: for if the first, then the second will come on undeniably. But suppose all this be given up, yet was this Liberty to hold Pleas so qualified, that the person could not be touched, till the thing did appear by Inquisition, and then in a legal way. Such proceeding was had upon suggestion made against the City of London, in Henry the Third's time: for one of the Judges was first sent into the City to find the suggestion by a Jury; and then the Lord Mayor appea∣red before the Lords, and traversed the matter, and in a manner appea∣led, or rather demanded to be tried according to the custom of the City. And the like course do we find observed in our Law-Reports of these times, in a Case concerning the price of Wool, by a false Report. The foot of the whole account will be this; That the work of Judicature of the Privy-Council in these times in cases of Crimes, was to receive Arti∣cles, and award Inquisitions; and after return in nature of a Grand In∣quest, to Recover, Traverse, and to order Trial at the Common-Law; and upon Verdict returned, to Fine and Ransom. In other Cases either of Right or Equity in matters of private property, they were determi∣ned either by Judges of the Bench, or Chancery, although possibly the suit was Coram Concilio, for that all the said Judges were of the King's Council. And yet, as I dare not affirm, so I cannot deny, but it might also be possible that some matters, especially these of a greater conse∣quence,\n\ndescription Page 21\n\neither in their own nature, or in regard of the persons whom they concerned, were determined by the major Vote of the whole Coun∣cil, in a prudential, or rather arbitrary way. But this was, Invita Mi∣nerva, and used so rarely, as the path is grown out of view; saving some few footsteps here and there remaining, which shew that the Grand Coun∣cil of Lords had been there.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of the Chancery.\n\nIT is the birth of the King's power in Judicature, and may deserve the name of the first-born. For though it had no better Title in these later times than Officium, because amongst other of the King's Escripts, it formed Writs remedial, for such as had received wrong; yet even by that work, it was in repute for so much skill in the Law of the Land, that by the consent of all, it was as well able to advise a remedy, as to advise the Complainants where to have it. And yet it had one advan∣tage further, that it was an Office of remembrance to the King, (who is a person of great trust in the Law, and gave such credit to all acts done before him) as being entred into the remembrance, became of the highest nature of Record, against which no Plea did lie. Amongst these, matters of debt and contract coming into the account, this Office taking notice of the Record, took cognizance of the thing, and for the executing thereof: and thus in these, and such-like Cases, granted Judicial Writs, and so found out a way of Judicature, to as many Causes as the State would trust it with. And because it pretended cognizance onely of matters of Record before them, they found out a way of examining of Witnesses by Commission, and returning their Depositions in writing; which being become a Record before them, they gave their Sentence upon the whole matter, without the ancient ordinary Trial per pares. It becomes a kind of peculiar, exempting it self from the ordinary course in manner of Trial, and from the ordinary rules of Law, in giving of Sentence; and as a Back-door for the King's Arbitry, in case of Judicature in matters of Common-pleas; as the Council-Table was in Crown-pleas. They both are looked upon with a very pleasing eye of Majesty, which loves not to be strait-laced; yet all is embattelled under the Colours of Equity, Ho∣nour, Conveniency, and Conscience; like a Monopoly, that is bred under the wings of the publick, but feeds it self upon it.\n\nThat this had attained the Title of a Court so anciently as in King Ste∣ven's time (as the Honourable Reporter noteth) I much question, by the Title that Fleta gives it in later times; nor, under his favour, will that Testimony cited out of the History of Ely warrant it, but upon a mista∣ken ground of misplacing the note of distinction. For I take the words to be thus translated: King Etheldred determined and granted, that the Church of Fly should for ever in the King's Court hold the dignity of the Chancery, and not hold the dignity of the King's Court of Chancery. Never∣theless, it is clear that these times brought it to that condition, that it might well carry that name, if formerly it had not: For it grew very fast both in honour and power; and this not by Usurpation, (though it did exceed) but by express donation from the Parliament.\n\ndescription Page 22\n\nYet is this power much darkned in the limits and extent thereof, chiefly in regard that the Chancellor is betrusted with many things, whereof there is no evidence for the Chancery to claim any cognizance. For he was in these times a person of many interests and relations, being one of the Quo∣rum in the Star-Chamber, of the King's Council, chief in the Chancery, most commonly a Clergy-man, and therewith Legate à Latere; and in these several Relations might act directly, and yet in several Courts. And therefore, though he had power with others, to punish neglects of Execu∣tion of the Statutes of Wines, by Act of Parliament; and also of the Statute concernign Victual, and to determine matters of controversie be∣tween parties in Cases depending before the Parliament, and in some mat∣ters that concern the King's Revenue; yet cannot these be said to be the proper work belonging to the cognizance of the Chancery, but to the Chancellor by special Commission in another Relation. Albeit, I cannot deny but the Court it self had cognizance in matters of as strange a na∣ture, Viz. To punish disturbances of Merchants in their Trade, to see to the executing of the Statutes of Purveyors, and to remedy grievances contrary to other Statutes: Which general words let in a wild liberty to that Court to intermeddle in Laws which were never intended for their touch; to punish Nusances according to discretion, to give remedy to Merchants upon the Statute of Staple; so that it is clear enough the Parliament intended it should be a Court, and gave their Seal to their power of Judicature. Nor, as it seemeth, was this any regret to the Courts of Common-Law, but as a thing taken for granted. For the Reports tell us, That if the King grants Tythes, arising from without the bounds of any Parish, the Patentee shall sue in the Chancery by Scire Facias, and shall there proceed to Issue or Demurrer; and then to the Common-Law; where upon Tri∣al, if the Defendant make default, the Plaintiff shall have Judgement and Execution. And if the Heir be in Ward to the King, the Mother shall sue and recover her Dower in the Chancery. And they tell us, that it had power to prohibit Spiritual Courts, and Courts of Common-Law, yea, to over-rule or reverse Judgements: and yet the Common-Law held it's ground when it was concerned: for neither were all suits there by Bill, as in cases of Equity, nor determined according to such rules; nor did the power of Judicature rest in the breast of one Chancellor, but in him joyntly with other Council of the King, which were also learned Judges of the Law. For the Report informeth that Edward the Second had granted a Rent in Tail to the Earl of Kent, who dying, his Son un∣der age, and Ward to the King, Edward the Third seised, amongst other Lands, the Rent, and granted it to Sir John Molins: Upon Petition, the King refers the matter to the Arch-bishop, and others of the Council, cal∣ling to them the Chancellor. A Scire Facias goes forth to Sir John Mo∣lins; he upon appearance pleaded to the jurisdiction, as a case belonging to the Common-law; but it would not be allowed, because it was to re∣peal the King's Charter.\n\nAnd whereas it was objected, that the reference was to the Archbishop and others, and therefore the cause ought not to be determined in the Chancery; it was resolved that it did properly belong to the Chancery, by the Law: And in the argument of the case, it appears clearly that the King's Council there, were learned in the Law. And the same is yet more evident by the Title of Bills in those days exhibited in the Chancery, which was directed to the Chancellor, and the King's Coun∣cil, and the Rule given Per tout les Justices. Which I rather note, for the\n\ndescription Page 23\n\nshortness of the form of Bills in those days, far different from these times, wherein the substance of the complaint, however small in it self, is oftentimes blown out into so great a bubble, that it breaks to no∣thing: And the Statutes formerly mentioned do assert the same thing, as touching the King's Council. For though they speak of the Council or Chancery in the English Tongue, yet in the original the words are, Conceil en Chancery.\n\nHaving thus touched upon the matters under the Judicatory of the Chancery, and Judges in the same: In the next place, the manner of proceedings comes to consideration. For it seems they had been for∣merly very irregular; and that contrary to the Grand Charter, upon a bare suggestion in the Chancery, the party complained of was impriso∣ned, and no proceedings made thereupon. For remedy whereof, it was ordained, That upon suggestions so made, the Complainant was to find Sureties to pursue the Suggestions; and that the Process of Law should issue forth against the party without imprisoning him; and that if the Suggestions were not proved true, the Complainant should incur the like penalty that the Defendant should have done, in case he had been found Guilty. But afterwards this later Clause was altered by another Statute, because it was full of uncertainty; and it was ordained, that in such case the Complainant shall be imprisoned, until he shall satis∣fie the Defendant of his Damages: and furthermore, shall make Fine and Ransom to the King. But because that the Defendant many times held his advantage, even to extremity, this course lasted not long; but a new Law was made, which put the power of awarding Dama∣ges in such cases into the Chancellour, to do according to his discre∣tion. And thus the Chancery obtained power to award Damages, which they never had formely; and the Chancellour a Precedency both in the Chancery, and of the Council in the Court of Star-chamber, and in many cases in the Exchequer. By the first he had a power in matters of Meum and Tuum; by the last, in matters Mei and Regis; and by the other, in matters Mei and Regni. A considerable man certainly he was in the motions of Government; but how much more, if he be made Arch-bishop of Canterbury, Cardinal, and Legate à Latere; or Arch-bishop, Lord Treasurer, and Legate à Latere; as these days had di∣vers times seen? Extraordinary advancements bestowed upon the No∣bility, brings Honour to the Throne; but if they be not men of no∣ted Worth and Uprightness, they make the Scepter stoop, by stirring up envy in the Nobility, and indignation from the people. For sel∣dom is it seen, that Advancements are fed from the Crown, though they be bred from thence; but either maintained by new supplies from the peoples Purses, or the ruine or decay of some Officers more ancient than themselves, or both. And such was the condition of the Chancellour; he sucked fat from beneath, and Bloud and Spirits from the Grand Chief Justiciar of England, and so reduced that Honourable Potentate unto the de∣gree of Chief Justice of the King's Bench, leaving scarcely unto him the Name or Title of Lord. One thing more remaineth, touching the election or nomination of this Great man. At the first, he was no better than a Register, or the King's Remembrancer, or Secretary, having also the Honour to advise the King in such matters as came within the circuit of the Writings in his custody; and questionless, Eo usque, it is suitable to all the reason in the World, that he should be of the King's sole No∣mination and Election. But when it befals, that instead of advising the\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nKing, his word is taken to be the Rule, and a Judicatory power put upon that; and unto this is superadded that honourable trust of keeping and governing the Great Seal of the Kingdom, with the continual growing power occasionally conferred upon him by the Parliament: He is now become no more the King's Remembrancer, but the Lord Chancellor of England, and Supream Officer of State. And it seems but reasonable that he should hold his place by publick Election, as well as the Grand Justi∣ciar (whose Plumes he borrowed) and other Grand Officers of State did before him. For he that will have his Servant to work for another, must give the other that Honour of Electing him thereto; nor was this laid aside nor forgotten by these times, but a claim was put in for the Election or allowance of this principal Officer amongst others; the Parliament obtaining a Judgement in the case by the King's Confession; and so the thing is left to the judgement of future ages, Viz. Whether a King that can do no man wrong, can dissemble the Royal Assent in Parliament; or de∣clare himself legally in that manner by Proclamation?\n\nCHAP. V. Of Admirals Courts.\n\nTHis is a third Court that maintained the King's Judicatory power, in a different way from that which is commonly called the Com∣mon-Law; and by many is therefore supposed to advance the King's Prerogative, but upon mistaken grounds. It is very true, that the way is different from the common Road, both in it's original, and in the course of proceedings; nor could it otherwise be, considering the condition of the Nations, and the people of the same, interested in common Traffique. The people thus interested, as much differed from the other sort of Dry men (if they may be so called) as Sea from Land, and are in nature but as March-men of several Nations, that must concentre in some third way for the maintenance of Commerce for peace-sake, and to the end that no Nation may be under any other Law than its own. The condition of the Nations in the times when civilized Government began to settle amongst them, was to be under the Roman Emperours, who having setled one Law in the general grounds throughout all Nations, made the Sea likewise to serve under one rule, which should float up and down with it, that men might know upon what terms they held their own, wheresoever they went; and up∣on what terms to part with it for their best advantage. In its original there∣fore, this Law may be called Imperial, and likewise in the Process, because it was directed in one way of Trial, and by one Law, which had its first birth from the Imperial power; and probably it had not been for the com∣mon benefit of Europe to have been otherwise, at other time, or by other directories formed. Nevertheless, this became no Gem of Prerogative to the English Crown; for if England did comply with forrein Natives for its own benefit (it being an Island full of the Sea, and in the com∣mon Road from the most parts of Europe that border upon the Sea, and of delight in Merchandise) it is but suitable to its self: and it did so com∣ply, as it saved the main Stake, by voluntary entertaining those Laws with∣out being imposed upon by Imperial power. For the Saxons came into this\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nKingdom a free people, and so (for ought yet appeareth to me) conti∣nueth to this day: I say, that in those first times, they did take into the consideration of Parliament the regulating of the fluctuating moti∣ons of Sea-laws: nor were they then, or after, properly imposed by the King's Edict. For though it were granted, that Richard the First re∣duced the Sea-Laws in the Isle of Oleron, yet that the same should be done without advice of Parliament in his return from the Holy land, is to me a Riddle, considering what Histories do hold forth concerning his return through Germany; nor can that be good evidence to entitle Kings of England to a power to make and alter Laws according to their private pleasure and interest. Nor doth that Record mentioned in the Institutes, warrant any such matter, but rather on the contrary groundeth the com∣plaint upon Laws, Statutes, Franchises, and Customs, established; and that this Establishment was by the King and the Council.\n\nThis Law was of a double nature, according to the Law of the Land; one part concerning the pleas of the Crown, and the other between party and party; for properly the King's Authority in the Admiralty is but an Authority of Judicature, according to Laws established, which both for process and sentence are different from the Common-Law, as much as the two Elements do differ, yet not different in the power that made them. I shall leave the particulars to be enquired into, by them that shall mind it elsewhere, and only touch so much as shall reflect upon the main Government. This power was executed by Deputies diversly, according as the times and opportunities were, for War or Peace, and either transitu or portu. What was done in time of War, or whilst the Ship is out of the English Seas, comes not to our purpose; and there∣fore I shall not meddle with that, further than this, that in the first times Kings were wont to divide the work of Judicature and of War into several hands. The power of War and Peace they committed un∣to men of approved Courage and Skill in that service; and therefore ge∣nerally, not to the men of highest rank, who had neither Mind nor Skill for a work of such labour, dyet and danger. This power passed under divers names; sometimes by grant of the custody of the Sea-coasts, sometimes of the parts and Sea coasts, sometimes by being made Captain of the Sea-men and Mariners, and sometimes Admiral of the Ships. It was a great power, and had been much greater, but that it suffered a double diminution; the one in the time, for three or four years commonly made an end of the command of one man, and at the best it was, quam diu Regi placuerit: the other diminution was in circuit of the power, for all the Maritine Coasts were not ordinarily under the power of one man, but of many; each having his proper precinct upon the South or North, East or Western shores; and under the Title of Admiral in the times of Edward the First, and forwards, who brought that Title from the Holy Land. Nevertheless, about the end of the times whereof we now Treat, the custody of the whole Sea began to settle in one hand, under the Title of Admiral of the English Seas; and the place was conferred upon men of the greatest rank, and so continued ever afterward. The power of Jurisdiction or Judicature all this while remained distinct, and it seems was setled in part in the power of the Sheriff and Justices. For by the Law the Sheriff and Justices had cognizance of matters between the high water and the low water mark; and what was done Super altum mare, was within the directory of the Admiral; these were but few things, and of small consideration: the principal of them being con∣cerning\n\ndescription Page 26\n\nWar or Peace, and those only within the English Seas. But af∣ter Edward the Third had beaten both the French and Spaniards at Sea, the people grew much more towards the Sea, and became so famous, that the greatest Lords thought the Regiment of Sea-affairs worthy of the best of their Rank, and were pleased with the Title of Admiral, whilst they left the work to others; and so the Admiral became a person of more honour and less work than he had been formerly. The greatness of the honour of this place thus growing, soon also began to contract greatness of power beyond what it had formerly; and this was principally in mat∣ter of Jurisdiction. For not contented with the power of a chief Justice of War and Peace within the Seas, which was his proper dominion, the Lord Admiral gained the same within the low water mark, and in the main streams below the next Bridge to the Sea, and in all places where Ridels were set; and yet these places were within the body of the County. Nor did he endeavour less to gain in matters of distributive Justice: for al∣though he had a legal Jurisdiction in things done upon the Sea, so far as to defend, order, determine, and cause restitution to be made, in cases of damage done unjustly; yet was it no less difficult to keep this power with∣in its own bounds, than the watry Element upon which it sloated; but it made continual waves upon the Franchise of the Land; and for this cause, no sooner had these great men savoured of the Honour and Au∣thority of that Dignity, but comes a Statute to restrain their Autho∣rity in the Cognizance of Cases, only unto such matters as are done upon the main Sea, as formerly was wont to be. And within two years after, that Act of Parliament is backed by another Act to the same pur∣pose, in more full expressions, saving that for Man-slaughter, the Ad∣mirals power extended even to the high water-mark, and into the main streams. And this leadeth on the next consideration, viz. What is the subject matter of this Jurisdiction and Authority. I shall not enter into the depth of particulars, but shall reduce all to the two heads of Peace and Justice.\n\nThe Lord Admiral is, as I formerly said, a Justice of Peace at Sea, maintaining the Peace by power, and restoring the Peace by setting an Order unto matters of Difference, as well between Foraigners, as be∣tween the English and Foraigners; as may appear by that Plea in the fourth Institutes formerly mentioned.\n\nSecondly, That point of Justice principally concerneth matters of Contract, and Complaints for breach of Contract; of these the Admiral is the Judge, to determine according to Law and Custom. Now as sub∣servient unto both these, he hath Authority of command over Sea-men, and Ships that belong to the State, and over all Sea-men and Ships in or∣der to the service of the State, to arrest and order them for the great voy∣ages of the King and Realm, and during the said voyage; but this he can∣not do without express Order, because the determining of a voyage Royal, is not wholly in his power.\n\nLastly, the Lord Admiral hath power, not only over the Sea-men serving in the Ships of State, but over all other Sea-men, to arrest them for the service of the State; and if any of them run away without leave from the Admiral, or power deputed from him, he hath power by enquiry to make a Record thereof, and certifie the same to the Sheriffs, Mayors, Bailiffs, &c. who shall cause them to be apprehended and imprisoned. By all which, and divers other Laws, not only the power of the\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nAdmiral is declared, but the original from whence it is derived, namely from the Legislative power of the Parliament, and not from the single per∣son of the King, or any other Council whatsoever. But enough hath been already said of these Courts of State, in their particular precincts. One general interest befalls them all: That as they are led by a Law much dif∣ferent from the Courts of Common-Law, so are they thereby the more endeared to Kings, as being subservient to their Prerogative, no less than the Common-Law is to the peoples liberty. In which condition being looked upon as Corrivals, this principal Maxime of Government will thence arise, That the bounds of these several Laws are so to be regar∣ded, that not the least gap of intrenchment be laid open each to other; lest the Fence once broken, Prerogative or Liberty should become bound∣less, and bring in Confusion instead of Law.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Church-mens Interest.\n\nBUt the Church-mens interest was yet more Tart, standing in need of no less allay, than that of the King's Authority, for that the King is no less concerned therein, than the people; and the rather, because it was now grown to that pitch, that it is become the Darling of Kings; and continually henceforth courted by them; either to gain them from the Papal Jurisdiction, to be more engaged to the Crown; or by their means to gain the Papal Jurisdiction to be more favourable and comply∣ing with the Prerogative Royal. The former times were tumultuous, and the Pope is gained to joyn with the Crown to keep the people under; though by that means, what the Crown saved to it self from the people, it lost to Rome. Henceforth the course of Affairs grew more civil, or (if you will) graced with a blush of Religion: and it was the policy of these times whereof we now treat, to carry a benign Aspect to the Pope, so far only as to slave him off from being an enemy, whilst Kings drove on a new design to ingratiate and engage the Church men of their own Na∣tion unto it's own Crown. This they did by distinguishing the Office or Dignity of Episcopacy, into the Ministerial and Honourable Parts; the later they called Prelacy, and was superadded for encouragement of the former, and to make their work more acceptaple to men for their Hospitalities sake; for the maintenance whereof, they had large Endow∣ments and Advancements. And then they reduced them to a right un∣derstanding of their Original, which, they say, is neither Jus Divinum, nor Romanum, but that their Lordships, power, and great possessions, were given them by the Kings, and others of this Realm. And that by vertue thereof, the Patronage and custody of the Possessions in the vacancy ought to belong to the Kings, and other the Founders; and that unto them the right of Election into such advancements doth belong, & not unto the Pope; nor could he gain other Title unto such power, but by usurpation, and encroachment upon the right of others. But these great men were not to be won by Syllogisms; Ordinarily they are begotten between Ambition and Covetousness, nourished by Riches and Honour; and like the Needle in the Compass, turn ever after that way. Edward the Third\n\ndescription Page 28\n\ntherefore labours to win these men, heaped Honour and Priviledges up∣on them, that they might see the gleanings of the Crown of England, to be better than the vintage of the Tripple Crown. Doubtless, he was a Prince that knew how to set a full value upon Church men, especially such as were devout; and it may be, did somewhat outreach in that course: For though he saw God in outward events, more than any of his Prede∣cessors; and disclaiming all humane merits, reflected much upon God's mercy, even in smaller blessings: yet we find his Letters reflect very much upon the Prayers of his Clergy; he loved to have their Persons nigh un∣to him, put them into places of greatest Trust, for Honour and Power, in Judicature; and not altogether without cause; he had thereby purchased unto his Kingdom the name and repute of being a Kingdom of Priests. But all this is but Personal, and may give some liking to the present In∣cumbents, but not to the expectants: and therefore the Royal Favour ex∣tended so far in these times, as to bring on the Parliament to give coun∣tenance to the Courts and Judiciary power of the Ordinaries, by the po∣sitive Law of the Kingdom, although formerly the Canons had already long since made way thereto by practice. I shall hereof note these few particulars ensuing.\n\nOrdinaries shall not be questioned in the King's Court for Com∣mutation, Testamentary Matters, or Matrimonial Causes, nor other things touching Jurisdiction of Holy-Church.\n\nThings formerly bred by the Canon, nourished by continual practice, allowed by Ordinance of Parliament, or Grant from Kings in Parliament, are now confirmed by solemn concurrence of the whole Representative Body of the Kingdom, to have and to hold with Warranty. And yet the sence is not so general as the words, nor doth it seem much other, than a Confection made for the Arch-Bishops appetite, to cure a distemper be∣tween him and the King: for the Civil Judge lost nothing hereby, nor would the Crown, as may appear by a Law of equal Authority with the former; for though an Executor or Administrator may cheat, yet it tells us, that Ordinaries only can oppress, and extort from dead men; and therefore in such cases doth provide remedy by enquiry, and Indictment before the King's Justices.\n\nThey shall have Cognizance of Vsury during the Delinquent's Life, and the King after the Delinquent's death.\n\nThe difference ariseth from the different end; the first being to reform the Person by Church-censures, and to urge him to restitution; the lat∣ter is for the King's Fine or Forfeiture. For as touching the Usurer's estate, the offence was in the nature of Felony, forfeiting both Lands and Goods to the King, after the Delinquent's death: And it seemeth the manner was to Indict the Delinquent during his life; and that stuck to him as a deadly Arrow in his side, till he died. Nor did it lie in the power of the Ordinary, by Ecclesiastical censure, so to reform the Of••ender, as to clear him to the King, unless the party offending made his peace with the King by Composition. And thus the Law continued, for ought appear∣eth to me, till the time of Henry the Eighth.\n\ndescription Page 29\n\nThey shall have Cognizance of avoidance of Benefices of Right: They shall certifie Bigamy; and Bastardy had beyond the Sea; and whether a Prior be perpetual, or Dative.\n\nThe first of these concerning avoidance of Churches, it seemeth was somewhat doubtful in point of practice, for that the Civil Judge used to determine all manner of avoidances, as well in Fact, as of Right; but by this Statute they are restrained only unto avoidances in Fact, so as after this Statute it is holden, that avoidances by death shall be tryed by the Countrey; but if the avoidance be by Deprivation, Resignati∣on, Creation, or otherwise, it shall be tryed by the Ordinary: be∣cause by common intendment he is more conusant of the thing, than Countrey-people. But as touching the point of Bigamy, the matter is more doubtful, in regard that commonly the Marriage of a second Wife, or Widow, is a matter in Fact, done in the face of the people; and of which they take notice, especially where the life of man is con∣cerned, which rather requireth the Judgment of his Peers, than where the outward maintenance only is engaged. Nevertheless, because the main point is, whether the party be a Clerk or not, and the same ancient∣ly rested upon the Certificate of the Ordinary: It is by this Law again allowed to him to try and certifie this point of Bigamy also, although the Statute of Bigamists might seem to Entitle the Civil Magistrate thereto, as the Law was holden to be before this Statute was made. In the next place, although it cannot be denyed but the Trial of Bastardy beyond the Sea might as well lie in the cognizance of the Lay-Magistrate, as in that of the Ecclesiastical; yet seeing the Clergy had already attained the cognizance of the thing, the place proved but a matter of circumstance; especially they having the advantage of the Civil Magistrate in this, in regard that the Ecclesiastical persons beyond the Sea, had also obtained the cognizance of that matter amongst themselves, their Testimony or Certificate would come with more credit to the Clergy in this Kingdom, than to the Magistrate, whose cognizance in such cases they did disal∣low.\n\nLastly, concerning Priories, whereas some were presentative, and filled by Induction from the Ordinary; and others were Donative, having their Priors meerly at the will of the Abbot, to be placed and displaced as he thought most expedient: If then the point in issue depends upon this knot, this Law referreth the Trial unto the Ordinary, who by common presumption best knows whether any Institution and Induction had passed his Registry and Seal, or not. And thus, though a kind of Judicial power seemeth to be carried along herewith, yet is all in a ministerial and sub∣servient way unto the Civil Magistrate; and nevertheless, with such cre∣dit and authority, that the main hinge of the Judicatory, in such cases, depends upon the dash of their pen.\n\nNo Bishop, nor Arch-Bishop, shall be Impeached before the Ci∣vil Magistrate, without the Kings express Warrant.\n\nThe former particulars concerned matter of Authority; this and others ensuing, concern matter of immunity, which, or most of which were formerly for a long time within the fancy of the Canon, but never\n\ndescription Page 30\n\ncame to the height of Parliamentary approbation or Authority till now, that it comes in as a peace-offering to pacifie the quarrel between the Arch-Bishop Stratford and the King. For he being engaged in the French Wars, so resolved to continue; and therefore to maintain distempers at home, he held neither Honourable nor safe.\n\nTheir Temporalties shall not be wasted, during the vacancy: Nor shall they be seized, but by Judgment of the Court.\n\nThe first of these was an ancient Law, grounded upon great rea∣son; although dulled by time, and by covetousness of the needy Pa∣trons, next to laid aside, if not quite put out of countenance. So as a new Law must be made to revive it, and to abolish that corrupt custom or practice of depredating those possessions given to a holy use i"
