        "text": "Steve and Me: My Friendship with Stephen Lawrence and the Search for Justice\n\nby Duwayne Brooks\n\n320pp, Abacus, Â£7.99\n\nDuwayne Brooks has waited a long time to tell his side of the story. As a boy of 18 he saw his best friend Stephen Lawrence murdered in a racist attack that was \"like a lynching from the days of slavery\". As the main witness to the murder, he was traumatised by what he saw, terrified of being targeted by the same killers and conscious of the importance of his evidence in bringing them to justice.\n\nCentral though he felt his role was in Stephen's life, in the events surrounding his death and in the long fight for justice afterwards, he has felt isolated and blamed, both for the death itself and for the failure of the private prosecution against the men suspected of Stephen's murder. His book is driven by rage and a determination to explain what happened from his point of view.\n\nThe only way he could cope with his friend's death was to vow that he would fight to bring his killers to justice. Yet, for a variety of reasons, this comfort has been denied him. From the outset, he was viewed with suspicion by the police, even as Stephen lay dying. The Lawrence family's lawyers also seem to have neglected him, mishandling his witness statement to the detriment of their own case against the suspected killers. The Lawrences themselves saw him as a \"bad influence\" on their son, refusing him a role at the funeral, and thereby denying the boys' friendship.\n\nThe rift between friend and family is evident from the first page. After Stephen died, Brooks felt blamed by the Lawrences for the fact that he and Stephen had been in the wrong place at the wrong time; he in turn blamed his friend's parents for the same thing. He returns time and again to the reason they took that particular bus route home on the night of the murder, telling himself that if only they had taken the long route, rather than rushing to beat a curfew imposed by Stephen's parents, they wouldn't have been in the notoriously racist area of Eltham High Street.\n\nWith Guardian writer Simon Hattenstone, he has shaped his experiences into a gripping book. As Brooks describes the minutes leading up to the attack, the writing becomes tense, terse and fast. He vividly portrays the terror of the attack, and his desperation as police failed to administer first aid to his dying friend. There are awful details of how long it took the ambulance to come, how no one seemed to want to touch Stephen, even when blood was gushing out of him. Instead, the police adopted a line of questioning that implied Brooks must have been partly to blame, \"as if it was beyond their comprehension that a gang of white boys could have attacked without a reason\".\n\nThe powerlessness and alienation that Brooks felt then was compounded in the weeks and years that followed. \"I felt like an outcast that day and have felt like one since,\" he says. His confusion and a fear of breaking down prevented him from properly describing what he'd seen, and this contributed to an isolation from the Lawrences which might have been avoided, or at least eased, had he been better supported.\n\nInstead, a teenager who had been living in hostels since leaving home after a row with his mother was left without adequate legal help or counselling as he made his statements and attended identity parades. As it turned out, his glimpses of the perpetrators had been too fleeting to form a major part of the case against those accused of Stephen's murder, a factor acknowledged in the Macpherson report, which absolved him of any responsibility for the failure of the case.\n\nFor years, though, Brooks has felt like a scapegoat for that failure, and his own personal war against the police has taken a heavy toll. He feels a justifiable paranoia, citing many instances of racial abuse, intimidation and harassment. By his own admission, Brooks is a fiery, impatient character, the opposite of his gentle, sweet, even-tempered friend.\n\nNow he says he needs to get on with his life. Writing this book may help him to do so, as at least he knows his story has been heard. In the process, he has provided a valuable insight into what it feels like to fear and mistrust the police because experience has taught you they will assume you are guilty simply because you are black."
