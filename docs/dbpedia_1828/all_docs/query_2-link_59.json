        "meta_description": "As one of Elizabeth’s closest advisors and leading ministers, Hatton was involved in every major political debate from the mid-1570s until his death in 1591. This chapter begins by looking at his role as a minister – his approach to balancing his roles as a courtier and a councillor, his relationships with other ministers, and his followers in government. It goes on to examine his attitude to the major issues facing Elizabeth I’s government in both domestic and foreign policy. On the domestic side, these included the Queen’s marriage, the problem of Mary, Queen of Scots and the response to the threat of Catholic attack on Elizabeth which preoccupied Elizabethan politics in the mid-1580s. In foreign policy, the chapter looks primarily at the central question of England’s involvement in European wars, most importantly in the Netherlands, which led up to the outbreak of war with Spain in 1585 and later to the Spanish Armada. In both of these cases, religious considerations had to be balanced with pragmatic ones, and despite religious differences, Hatton often agreed with his more solidly Protestant colleagues and worked harmoniously with them, although it also identifies a number of episodes in which they worked at cross purposes. However, it suggests that Hatton’s motivations were very often different to his fellow ministers; while councillors such as Leicester and Walsingham based their politics on religious considerations (notably international solidarity between Protestants), Hatton’s tended to revolve more around his personal political interests and his perceptions of the national interest.",
