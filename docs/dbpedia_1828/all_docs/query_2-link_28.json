        "text": "The church on this site was built on the Isle of Thorns--\n\nThorney Island\n\n--an almost insulated peninsula of dry sand and gravel, girt on side by the Thames, and on the other by the marshes formed by the little stream Eye,[n.228.1] which gave its name to Tyburn, before it fell into the river. Here Sebert, King of the East Saxons, who died in , having been baptized by Mellitus, is said to have founded a church, which he dedicated to St. Peter, either from an association with the great church in Rome, from which Augustine had lately come, or to balance his rival foundation in honour of St. Paul upon a neighbouring hill. Sulcard, the historian of the Abbey, relates that on a Sunday night, being the eve of the day on which the church was to be consecrated by Bishop Mellitus, Edric the fisherman was watching his nets by the bank of the island. On the opposite shore he saw a gleaming light, and, when he approached it in his boat, he found a venerable man, who desired to be ferried across the stream. Upon their arrival at the island, the\n\n229\n\nmysterious stranger landed, and proceeded to the church, calling up on his way springs of water, which still exist, by blows of his staff. Then a host of angels miraculously appeared, and held candles which lighted him as he went through all the usual forms of a church consecration, while throughout the service other angels were seen ascending and descending over the church, as in Jacob's vision. When the old man returned to the boat, he bade Edric tell Mellitus that the church was already consecrated by St. Peter, who held the keys of heaven, and promised that a plentiful supply of fish would never fail him as a fisherman if he ceased to work on a Sunday, and did not forget to bear a tithe of that which he caught to the Abbey of .\n\nOn the following day, when Mellitus came to consecrate the church, Edric presented himself and told his story, showing, in proof of it, the marks of consecration in the traces of the chrism, the crosses on the doors, and the droppings of the angelic candles. The bishop acknowledged that his work had been already done by saintly hands, and changed the name of the place from Thorney to , and in recollection of the story of Edric a tithe of fish was paid by the Thames fishermen to the Abbey till ,[n.229.1] the bearer having a right to sit that day at the prior's table, and to ask for bread and ale from the cellarman.\n\nBeside the church of Sebert arose the palace of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, to which it served as a chapel, as\n\n230\n\ndoes to Windsor. It is connected with many of the legends of that picturesque age. Here, while he was attending mass with Leofric of Mercia and his wife, the famous Godiva, Edward the Confessor announced that he saw the Saviour appear as a luminous child. By the wayside between the palace and the chapel sate Michael, the crippled Irishman, who assured Hugolin, the chamberlain, that St. Peter had promised his cure if the king would himself bear him on his shoulders to the church, upon which Edward bore him to the altar, where he was received by Godric, the sacristan, and walked away whole.\n\nWhilst he was an exile Edward had vowed that if he returned to England in safety he would make a pilgrimage to Rome. This promise, after his coronation, he was most anxious to perform, but his nobles refused to let him go, and the pope (Leo IX.) released him from his vow, on condition of his founding or restoring a church in honour of St. Peter. Then, to an ancient hermit near Worcester, St. Peter appeared,\n\nbright and beautiful, like to a clerk,\n\nand bade him tell the king that the church to which he must devote himself, and where he must establish a Benedictine monastery, was no other than the ancient minster of Thorney, which he knew so well.\n\nEdward, henceforth devoting a of his whole substance to the work, destroyed the old church, and rebuilt it from the foundation, as the\n\nCollegiate Church of St. Peter at\n\nWestminster\n\n.\n\nIt was the cruciform church erected in England,[n.230.1] and was of immense size for the age, covering the whole of the ground occupied by the present building. The foundation was laid in , and the\n\n231\n\nchurch was consecrated , days before the death of the king. Of this church and monastery of the Confessor nothing remains now but the Chapel of the Pyx, the lower part of the Refectory underlying the schoolroom, part of the Dormitory, and the whole of the lower walls of the South Cloister; but the Bayeux tapestry still shows us in outline the church of the Confessor as it existed in its glory.\n\nThe founder of the Abbey was Henry III., who pulled down most of the Confessor's work, and from to devoted himself to rebuilding. The material he employed was the green sandstone, which has given the name of God-stone to the place in Surrey whence it came, and afterwards Caen stone. The portions which remain to us from his time are the Confessor's Chapel, the side aisles and their chapels, and the choir and transepts. The work of Henry was continued by his son Edward I., who built the eastern portion of the nave, and it was carried on by different abbots till the great west window was erected by Abbot Estney in . Meantime, Abbot Littlington, in , had added the College Hall, the Abbot's House, Jerusalem Chamber, and part of the cloisters. In Henry VII. pulled down the Lady Chapel, and built his beautiful Perpendicular chapel instead. The western towers were only completed from designs of Sir Christopher Wren (), under whom much of the exterior was refaced with Oxfordshire stone, and its original details mercilessly defaced and pared down.\n\nAt the dissolution Abbot Benson was rewarded for his facile resignation by being made dean of the college which was established in place of the monastery. In a bishopric of was formed, with Middlesex as a diocese, but it was of short existence, for Mary refounded the monastery, and Elizabeth turned her attention entirely to the college, which she re-established under a dean and secular canons.\n\nNo can understand , and few can realise its beauties, in a single visit. Too many tombs will produce the same satiety as too many pictures. There can be no advantage, and there will be less pleasure, in filling the brain with a hopeless jumble in which kings and statesmen, warriors, ecclesiastics, and poets, are tossing about together. Even those who give the shortest time to their London sight-seeing should not pay less than visits to the Abbey. On the , unwearied by detail, let them have the luxury of enjoying the architectural beauties of the place, with a general view of the interior, the chapter-house, cloisters, and their monastic surroundings. On the let them study the glorious chapels which surround the choir, and which contain nearly all the tombs of antiquarian or artistic interest. On the let them labour as far as they can through the mass of monuments which crowd the transepts and nave, which are often mere cenotaphs, and which almost always derive their only interest\n\n233\n\nfrom those they commemorate. These visits may enable visitors to , but it will require many more to it-visits at all hours of the day to drink in the glories of the light and shadow in the great church of England which retains its beautiful ancient colouring undestroyed by so-called\n\nrestoration\n\n--visits employed in learning the way by which the minster has grown, arch upon arch, and monument upon monument; and other visits given to studying the epitaphs on the tombs, and considering the reminiscences they awaken.\n\nOft let me range the gloomy aisles alone- Sad luxury! to vulgar minds unknown, Along the walls where speaking marbles show What worthies form the hallow'd mould below; Proud names, who once the reins of empires held; In arms who triumph'd, or in arts excell'd; Chiefs, graced with scars, and prodigal of blood; Stern patriots, who for sacred freedom stood; Just men, by whom impartial laws were given; And saints, who taught and led the way to heaven. Tickell.\n\nIn approaching the Abbey from , the portion seen is the richly decorated buttresses of Henry VII.'s Chapel. Then we emerge into the open square which still bears the name of , and have the whole building rising before us.\n\nThat antique pile behold, Where royal heads receive the sacred gold: It gives them crowns, and does their ashes keep; There made like gods, like mortals there they sleep, Making the circle of their reign complete, These suns of empire, where they rise they set. Waller.\n\nThe outline of the Abbey is beautifully varied and broken by , which is not only\n\n234\n\ndeeply interesting in itself, but is invaluable as presenting the greater edifice behind it in its true proportions. Facing us is the north transept, the front of which, with its statueless niches, beautiful rose-window, and its great triple entrance-imitated from French cathedrals- sometimes called\n\nSolomon's Porch,\n\nis the richest part of the building externally, and a splendid example of the Pointed style. Beyond Wren's poor towers is the low line of grey wall which indicates the Jerusalem Chamber.\n\nFacing the Abbey, on the left, are Hall and the Houses of Parliament, which occupy the site of the ancient palace of our sovereigns. Leaving these and for a later chapter, let us proceed at once to enter the Abbey.\n\nBehind the rich lace-work of Henry VII.'s Chapel, and under of the grand flying buttresses of the Chapter- House, through a passage hard by which Chaucer lived, we reach the door of the Poets' Corner, where Queen Caroline vainly knocked for admission to share in the coronation of her husband George IV. This is the door by which visitors generally enter the Abbey.\n\nThe name , as applied to the southern end of the south transept, is mentioned by Goldsmith. The attraction to the spot as the burial-place of the poets arose from its containing the grave of Chaucer,\n\nthe father of English poets,\n\nwhose tomb, though it was not erected till more than a years after his death ( ), is the only ancient monument in the transept. Here, as Addison says,\n\nthere are many poets who have no monuments, and many monuments which have no poets.?\n\nThough many of the later monuments are only cenotaphs, they are still for the most part interesting as portraying those they commemorate. That which strikes every is the wonderful beauty of the colouring in the interior. Architects will pause to admire the Purbeck marble columns with their moulded, not sculptured, capitals; the beauty of the triforium arcades, their richness so greatly enhanced by the wall-surface above being covered with a square diaper; the noble rose-windows; and, above all, the perfect proportions of the whole. But no knowledge of architecture is needed for the enjoyment of the colouring--of the radiant hues of the stained-glass, which enhances the depth of the shadows amid the time-stained arches, and floods the roof and its beautiful tracery with light.\n\n237\n\nFew, however, among the hundreds who visit it daily are led to the Abbey by its intrinsic beauty, but rather because it is\n\nthe silent meeting-place of the great dead of\n\neight\n\ncenturies\n\n--the burial-place of those of her sons whom, at different times of her taste and judgment, England has delighted to honour with sepulture in\n\nthe great temple of silence and reconciliation, where the enmities of\n\ntwenty\n\ngenerations lie buried.\n\n[n.237.1]\n\n238\n\nThose who look upon the tombs of the poets can scarcely fail to observe, with surprise, how very few are commemorated here whose works are read now, how many whose very existence is generally forgotten.[n.238.1]\n\nBeginning to the right from the entrance, we find the monuments of-\n\n, author of the who\n\nexchanged his laurell for a crowne of glory\n\nin . His bust was erected here by Anne Clifford,\n\nDorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery.\n\nJohn Philips\n\n,\n\n1708\n\n, buried at Hereford, an author, whose once celebrated poem,\n\nThe Splendid Shilling,\n\nis now almost forgotten. Milton was his model, and\n\nwhatever there is in Milton which the reader wishes away, all that is obsolete, peculiar, or licentious, is accumulated with great care by Philips.\n\nJohnson's Lives of the Poets.\n\nThe monument was erected by the poet's friend, Sir Simon Harcourt. The epitaph is attributed to Dr. Smalridge. The line,\n\nUni Miltono secundus, primoque pane par,\n\nwas effaced under Dean Sprat, not because of its almost profane arrogance, but because the royalist dean would not allow even the name of the regicide Milton to appear within the Abbey --it was\n\ntoo detestable to be read on the wall of a building dedicated to devotion.\n\nThe line was restored under Dean Atterbury.\n\nIbid.\n\nPhilips's poem of\n\nCyder\n\nis commemorated in the bower of apple entwined with laurel which encircles his bust, and the inscription,\n\nHonos erat huic quoque Pomo.\n\nReturning to the south entrance, and turning left, we find monuments to-\n\nBen Jonson, 1637, who was educated at Westminster School, but afterwards became a bricklayer, then a soldier, and then an actor. His comedies found such favour with James I. that he received a pension of a hundred marks, with the title of poet-laureate, in 1616. His pension was increased by Charles I., but he died in great poverty in the neighbourhood of the Abbey, where he was buried in the north aisle of the nave. Every Man in His Humour and The Alchymist are perhaps the best of his comedies; but there is hardly one of his pieces which, as it stands, would please on the stage in the present day, even as most of them failed to please in his own time.Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Art and Lit. His allegorical monument, by Rysbrack, was erected in 1737.\n\nSamuel Butler, 1680, buried at St. Paul's, Covent Garden; the author of Hudibras, a work which, when it came out,\n\nwas incomparably more popular than no poem in our language rose at once to greater reputation.\n\nHallam, Introduct. to Lit. Hist.\n\nBy the first paragraph the reader is amused, by the next he is delighted, and by a few more constrained to astonishment. But astonishment is a tiresome pleasure; he is soon weary of wondering, and longs to be diverted.-Johnson.\n\nThe bust was erected by John Barber, Lord Mayor, that he who was destitute of all things when alive, might not want a monument when dead.\n\nEdmond Spenser, 1598, with the epitaph,\n\nHere lyes expecting the comminge of our Saviour Christ Jesus, the body of Edmond Spencer, the Prince of Poets in his tyme, whose divine spirrit needs noe othir witnesse then the workes which he left behinde him.\n\nHe died in\n\nKing Street\n\n,\n\nWestminster\n\n, and was buried here at the expense of Devereux, Earl of Essex, the spot being selected for his grave on account of its vicinity to Chaucer.\n\nHis hearse was attended by poets, and mournful elegies and poems, with the pens that wrote them, were thrown into his tomb. What a funeral was that at which Beaumont, Fletcher, Jonson, and, in all probability, Shakspeare, attended!-what a grave in which the pen of Shakspeare may be mouldering away! -Stanley, Memorials of Westminster.\n\nIt is by his that Spenser is chiefly known now, but his was so much admired by Dryden that he considered it\n\nnot to be matched in any modern language.\n\nOur sage and serious Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas.-Milton.\n\nThe grave and diligent Spenser.-Ben Jonson.\n\nHere's that creates a poet.-Quarles.\n\n, , buried at Stoke Pogis, chiefly known as the uthor of the which Byron\n\n243\n\njustly calls\n\nthe corner-stone of his glory.\n\nThe monument is by .

His dramatic poems of and are the least forgotten of his works. His monument, by the elder Bacon, bears a profile medallion, with an inscription by Bishop Hurd--\n\nPoetae, si quis alius culto, casto, pio.\n\n, , who died of opium, and is buried at . He was poet-laureate in the time of William III. He\n\nendeavoured to make the stage as grossly immoral as his talents admitted,\n\nbut\n\nwas not destitute of humour.\n\n[n.243.3] Rochester said of him that if he had burnt all he wrote, and printed all he spoke, he would have had more wit and humour than any other poet. His rivalry with Dryden excited the ill-natured lines-\n\nMature in dulness from his tender years,\n\nShadwell alone, of all my sons, is he\n\nWho stands confirm'd in full stupidity:\n\nThe rest to some faint meaning make pretence,\n\nBut Shadwell never deviates into sense.Mac Flecknoe.\n\nThe monument, erected by the poet's son, Sir John , bears his pert-looking bust crowned with laurel, by .\n\n, , educated at School, whence he was removed to serve as tapster in the public.house of an uncle at\n\n244\n\n. His knowledge of the Odes of Horace here attracted the attention of Lord Dorset, who sent him to College at Cambridge, and under the same patronage he rose to be Gentleman of the Bedchamber to William III. and Under Secretary of State, &c. and were considered his best works by his contemporaries; now no reads them. He died at Wimpole in Cambridgeshire, and was buried by his own desire at the feet of Spenser. His bust, by , was given by Louis XIV. His epitaph, by Dr. Freind, tells how,\n\n, while he was writing the History of his own Times, Death interfered, and broke the thread of his discourse.\n\n, , buried at Fulham.

A Roman statue with allegorical figures, by Canova considered the figure of Eloquence (deeply attentive to the Duke's oratory)\n\none\n\nof the noblest statues he had seen in England,\n\nThe epitaph is by Paul Whitehead.\n\nIt is said that, through the influence of Sir Edward Walpole, the monument in memory of John, Duke of Argyle and Greenwich, was confided to the hands of Roubiliac. The design is a splendid conceit --the noble warrior and orator is stretched out and expiring at the foot of a pyramid, on which History is writing his actions, while Minerva looks mournfully on, and Eloquence deplores his fall. The common allegorical materials of other monuments are here. Even History is inscribing a conceit-she has written John, Duke of Argyle and Gr--there she pauses and weeps. There is a visible want of unity in the action, and in this work at least Roubiliac merits the reproach of Flaxman, that he did not know how to combine figures together so as to form an intelligible story. Yet no one, before or since, has shown finer skill in rendering his figures individually excellent. Argyle indeed seems reluctant to die, and History is a little too theatrical in her posture; but all defects are forgotten in looking at the figure of Eloquence, with her supplicating hand and earnest brow.-Allan Cunningham.\n\n, . The tomb is the last work of , who cast the face after death. The skill of Roubiliac is conspicuous in the ease which he has given to the unwieldy figure of the great musician.\n\n, buried at Kensal Green, the honoured author of and A bust.\n\n, , whose contributions to the and . have caused him to be regarded as the greatest of English essayists, and whose character stood equally high as an author, a man, and a Christian. His statue, by , stands on a pedestal\n\n247\n\nsurrounded by the Muses. As we look at it we may remember how he was accustomed to walk by himself in , and meditate on the condition of those who lay in it.\n\nIt represents him, as we can conceive him, clad in his dressing. gown, and freed from his wig. stepping from his parlour at Chelsea into his trim little garden, with the account of the Everlasting Club, or the Loves of Hilpa and Shalum, just finished for the next day's Spectator, in his hand. Such a mark of national respect was due to the unsullied statesman, to the accomplished scholar, to the master of pure English eloquence, to the consummate painter of life and manners. It was due, above all, to the great satirist, who alone knew how to use ridicule without abusing it, who, without inflicting a wound, effected a great social reform, and who reconciled wit and virtue, after a long and disastrous separation, during which wit had been led astray by profligacy, and virtue by fanaticism.-Macaulay.\n\n, the poet and historian, . A bust. On his gravestone is inscribed,\n\nHis body is buried in peace, but his name liveth evermore.\n\n, , the wit, mathematician, and divine. He was the college tutor of Sir Isaac Newton, whose optical lectures were published at his expense. He died (being Master of Trinity, Cambridge) at of the canonical houses in the cloisters.

The nose of the effigy was broken by some Cavaliers, who broke into the abbey to destroy the hearse of the Earl of Essex, but it was restored by the University of Oxford.\n\nIt is most worthy to be observed with what diligence he (Camden) inquired after ancient places, making hue and cry after many a city which was run away, and by certain marks and tokens pursuing to find it; as by the situation on the Roman highways, by just distance from other ancient cities, by some affinity of name, by tradition of the inhabitants, by Roman coins digged up, and by some appearance of ruins. A broken urn is a whole evidence; or an old gate still surviving, out of which the city is run out. Besides, commonly some new spruce town not far off is grown out of the ashes thereof, which yet hath as much natural affection as dutifully to own these reverend ruins for her mother.-Fuller.\n\nDavid Garrick, 1779, the actor. His figure, throwing aside a curtain and disclosing a medallion of Shakspeare, is intended to be allegorical of the way in which his theatrical performance unveiled the beauties of Shakspeare's works. To paint fair nature, by divine command, Her magic pencil in his glowing hand, A Shakspeare rose,--then to expand his fame, Wide o'er this breathing world, a Garrick came.

He was suffered to die in great poverty, yet his funeral was conducted with a magnificence which called forth the verses of Moore- Oh! it sickens the heart to see bosoms so hollow, And spirits so mean in the great and high-born, To think what a long line of titles may follow The relics of him who died-friendless and lorn!

He was buried in the grave of Thomas May, the poet (disinterred at the Restoration), with the inscription,\n\nO Rare Sir William Davenant.\n\nSir Richard Moray, 1673, one of the founders of the Royal Society, called by Bishop Burnet\n\nthe wisest and worthiest man of his age.\n\nJames Macpherson, 1796, author of Ossian, brought hither from Inverness.\n\nRobert Adam, 1792, architect of the Adelphi Terrace and Osterley Paik, &c.\n\nSir William Chambers, 1796, architect of Somerset House.\n\nWilliam Gifford, 1826, the eminent critic, best known as the editor of the Quarterly Review from its commencement in 1819 to 1824.\n\nJohn Ireland, Dean of Westminster, 1842, founder of the Ireland scholarships at Oxford.\n\n(By the grave of Grote) Connop Thirlwall, Bishop of St. David's, the rival historian of Greece, 1875.\n\nBetween the pillars opposite Dryden's tomb is a slab from which the brass has been torn away, covering the grave of Hawle, the knight murdered in the choir, , during the Abbey service, by a breach of the rights of sanctuary.\n\nAgainst the screen of the choir, on the right of its entrance, are the tombs of-\n\nDr. Richard Busby, 1695, for fifty-five years head-master of Westminster School. His noble statue (by F. Bird) does not seem suggestive of the man who declared that the rod was his sieve, and that whoever could not pass through that, was no boy for him. He is celebrated for having persistently kept his hat on when Charles II. came to visit his school, saying that it would never do for the boys to think any one superior to himself.\n\nAs we stood before Dr. Busby's tomb, the knight (Sir Roger de Coverley) uttered himself again: Dr. Busby! a great man! he whipped my grandfather; a very great man! I should have gone to him myself, if I had not been a blockhead; a very great man! - Addison, in the Spectator.\n\nDr. William Vincent, 1815, head-master and dean. A tablet.\n\nDr. Robert South, 1716, Archdeacon of Westminster. As a Westminster boy, when leading the devotions of the school, he boldly prayed for Charles I. by name on the morning of his execution. He was afterwards chaplain to James, Duke of York; Canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and of Westminster, of which he refused the Deanery when it was offered to him on the death of Dean Sprat. He was equally famous for his learning and wit, and for his theological and political intolerance. Bishop Burnet speaks of him as this learned but ill-natured divine.\n\nSouth had great qualifications for that popularity which attends the pulpit, and his manner was at that time original. Not diffuse, not learned, not formal in argument like Barrow, with a more natural structure of sentences, a more pointed, though by no means a more fair and satisfactory, turn of reasoning, with a style clear and English, free from all pedantry, but abounding with those colloquial novelties of idiom which, though now become vulgar and offensive, the age of Charles II. affected; sparing no personal or temporary sarcasm; but if he seems for a moment to tread on the verge of buffoonery, recovering himself by some stroke of vigorous sense and language; such was the witty Dr. South, whom the courtiers delighted to hear.-Hallam. Lit. Hist. of Europe.\n\nSouth's sentences are gems, hard and shining: Voltaire's look like them, but are only French paste.-Guesses at Truth.\n\nWe may now enter\n\nthe solemn by-ways of the Abbey\n\n--the aisles surrounding the choir, outside which are a number of hexagonal chapels, which were probably built by Henry III. in imitation of those which he had himself seen in the course of construction in several of the northern cathedrals of France. These chapels contain all that is most precious in the Abbey. The gates of the choir-aisles are guarded by vergers.\n\n[The chapels are freely opened to the public on Mondays; on other days a fee of sixpence is deposited on entering, and visitors are shown round by a verger.\n\nVisitors may, however, on application, obtain permission to linger in the chapels and to examine them by themselves, which will be imperative with all who are interested in the historic or art treasures they contain.\n\nPermission to draw in the chapels may be obtained by personal or\n\n252\n\nwritten application to the Dean; and no church in the world--not even St. Mark's at Venice, at Vienna, or the Mosque at Cordova-affords such picturesque subjects.\n\nRoyal tombs, when given here in small type, with other tombs most important in the history of art, are marked with an asterisk.] On entering the aisles of the choir, we pass at once from the false taste of the last centuries, to find the surroundings in harmony with the architecture. The ancient altars are gone, very little of the old stained glass remains, several of the canopies and many of the brasses and statuettes have been torn from the tombs; but, with these exceptions, the hand of the worst of destroyers--the\n\nrestorers\n\n- has been allowed to rest here more than any other of our great English churches, and, except in the introduction of the atrocious statue of Watt and the destruction of some ancient screens for the monuments of Lord Bath and General Wolfe, there is little which jars upon the exquisite colouring and harmonious beauty of the surroundings.\n\nOn the left is the Gothic\n\ntomb of touchstone\n\nerected by Henry III. to , , and his , when he moved their bodies from the chapter-house, where they were buried. Over this tomb, under glass, is a curious altar-decoration of the century.\n\nIn the centre is a figure which appears to be intended for Christ, holding the globe and in the act of blessing; an angel with a palm branch is on each side. The single figure at the left hand of the whole decoration is St. Peter; the figure that should correspond on the right, and all the Scripture subject; on that side, are gone. In the compartments to the left, between the figure of St. Peter and the centre figures, portions of three subjects remain: one represents the Adoration of the Kings; another, apparently, the Raising of Lazarus; the subject of the third is doubtful, though some figures remain; the fourth is destroyed. These single figures and subjects are worthy of a good Italian artist of the fourteenth century. The remaining decorations were splendid and costly: the small compartments in the architectural enrichments are filled with variously coloured pieces of glass inlaid on tin-foil, and have still a brilliant effect. This interesting work of art is supposed to have originally formed part of the decorations of the high altar.-Eastlake. Hist. of Oil Painting, i. 176.\n\nBeyond this, the eye, wearied with the pagan sculptures of the transept, rests in ecstasy upon the lovely details of the tombs of iRichard II. and Edward III.\n\nIn St. Peter's at Rome one is convinced that it was built by great princes. In Westminster Abbey one thinks not of the builder; the region of th: place makes the first impression, and, though stripped Of its shrines; and altars, it is nearer converting one to Popery than all the regular pageantry of Roman domes. One must have taste to be sensible of the beauties of Grecian architecture; one only wants passion to feel Gothic. Gothic churches infuse superstition, Grecian temples admiration. The Papal see amassed its wealth by Gothic cathedrals, and displays it in Grecian temples.-Walpole, i. 108.\n\nWe must now turn to the chapels.\n\nI wandered among what once were chapels, but which are now occupied by the tombs and monuments of the great. At every turn I met with rare illustrious names, or the cognizance of some powerful house renowned in history. As the eye darts into these dusky chambers of death, it catches glimpses of quaint effigies; some kneeling in niches, as if in devotion; others stretched upon the tombs, with hands piously pressed together; warriors in armour, as if reposing after battle; prelates with croziers and mitres; and nobles in robes and coronets, lying as it were in state. In glancing over this scene, so strangely populous, yet where every form is so still and silent, it seems almost as if we were treading a mansion of that fabled city, where every being has been suddenly transmuted into stone.Washington Irving.\n\nOn the right is the , or , only separated by a screen of monuments from the south transept. fine tomb in the centre is that of Lionel\n\n254\n\nCranfield, Earl of Middlesex, , Lord High Treasurer in the time of James I., and Anne, his wife; it is of the latest instances of a monument in which the figures have animals at their feet.[n.254.1] His grave, with those of other members of his family, is beneath the pavement of the aisle. Other tombs are-\n\n(South Wall) (), son of the Dean of .\n\nGabriel Goodman, Dean of Westminster (1601), of whom Fuller says, Goodman was his name, and goodness was his nature. It was under this dean that the Protestant services of the Abbey were reestablished.\n\n(At the east end, on the site of the altar) Frances Howard, Countess of Hertford (1598), sister of Howard of Effingham, the Lord High Admiral who repulsed the Armada, daughter-in-law of the Protector Somerset, and cousin of Edward VI. She lived till the fortieth year of Elizabeth, greately favoured by her gratious sovereigne, and dearly beloved of her lord.\n\nAbbot Curtlyngton (1334), the first person buried in the chapel. His brass is torn away.\n\n* (East Wall) Abbot Simon Langham (1376). A noble alabaster statue in great preservation on an altar-tomb: it once had a canopy, and a statue of Mary Magdalen, on the eve of whose feast the abbot died, stood at his feet. He was in turn Bishop of Ely, Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Bishop of Pieneste, Lord High Treasurer, and Lord Chancellor. He was brought back to be buried here from Avignon, where he died. His immense benefactions to the Abbey are recorded by Godwin, yet his unpopularity appears in the verses which commemorate his translation from Ely to Canterbury- The Isle of Ely laught when Simon from her went, But hundred thousand wept at his coming into Kent.Weaver's Funeral Monuments.\n\nWilliam Bill (1561), the first Elizabethan Dean of Westminster, Grand Almoner to the Queen, a good and learned man, and a friend to those that were so.\n\nJohn Spottiswoode, Archbishop of Glasgow, is believed to be buried here. He wrote the History of the Scottish Church at the command of James I., who, being told that some passages in it might possibly bear too hard upon the memory of his Majesty's mother, bid him write the truth and spare not. Bishop Nicholson, Scot. Hist.\n\nBetween the Chapels of St. Benedict and, St. Edmund is a tomb of four of the Children of Henry III. (Richard, John, Henry, and Katharine), once adorned with mosaics. The State Records contain the king's order of its erection, and for allowing Simon de Wells five marks and a half for bringing a brass image from the City, and William de Gloucester seventy marks for a silver image-both being for the tomb of the king's little dumb daughter Katharine, of five years old, for whom mass was daily said in the hermitage of Charing. Katharine, third daughter of King Henry III. and Queen Eleanor, was born at London, A.D. 1252, Nov. 25th, being St. Katharine's day, whose name was therefore given unto her at the Font, by Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, her uncle and godfather. She dyed in her very infancy, on whom we will presume to bestow this epitaph- Wak't from the wombe, she on this world did peep, Dislik't it, clos'd her eyes, fell fast asleep. Fuller's Worthies.\n\nIn the pavement of the aisle are the tombs of Robert Tounsen, Dean of Westminster and Bishop of Salisbury, 1621; of Cicely Ratclife, 1396; of Thomas Bilson, Bishop of Winchester, the deep and profound scholar; Fuller's Worthies. and of Sir John de Bewzerley and his wife, Anne Buxall, which once bore brasses. Beneath the tomb of Richard II. is believed to lie Queen Anne of Warwick, the unhappy Anne Nevile, who married first the Prince of Wales, Edward, son of Henry VI. After his murder at Tewkesbury she fled from the addresses of his cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard III., but was discovered disguised as a kitchenmaid, and married to him against her will. She died in less than two years after her coronation, of grief for the loss of her only child, Edward, Prince of Wales.\n\nSt. Edmund's Chapel (the first of the hexagonal chapels), dedicated to the martyred Archbishop of Canterbury, is separated from the aisle by an ancient wooden screen. It is crowded with interesting monuments. In the centre are three tombs.\n\n* That in the midst bears a glorious brass in memory of Eleanor de Bohun, Duchess of Gloucester, daughter of the Earl of Hertford, and wife of Thomas of Woodstock, youngest son of Edward III., buried in the Confessor's Chapel. After her husband's arrest and assassination,she became a nun of Barking Abbey, where she died in 1399. Her figure, in a widow's dress, lies under a triple canopy.\n\nBeyond Eleanor, on the south, are the tomb and cross of Robert de Waldeby, Archbishop of York (1391), the friend of the Black Prince and tutor of Richard II. On the north is Mary Villiers, Countess of Stafford (1693), wife of William Howard, the Earl beheaded under Charles II. At her feet rests Henry Ferne, Bishop of Chester (1661), who attended Charles I. during his imprisonment, and whose only fault it was that he could not be angry. See Stanley, Memorials, 243.\n\nMaking the circuit of the chapel from the right, we find the tombs of-\n\n* William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke (1296). He was halfbrother to Henry III., being the son of Queen Isabella, widow of John, by her second marriage with Hugh le Brune, Earl of March and Poictiers. William, surnamed from his birthplace, was sent to England with his brothers in 1247, and the distinction with which they were treated was one of the grievances which led to the war with the barons. He fought in the battle of Lewes, and flying the kingdom afterwards, was killed at Bayonne. An indulgence of a hundred days was granted to all who prayed by this tomb, which is very curious. It was erected by William's son, Aylmer, and is a stone altar-tomb, supporting a wooden sarcophagus, upon which lies the effigy, which is of wood covered with gilt copper. The belt and cushion, and, above all, the shield, are most beautiful examples of the use of enamelled metal as applied to monumental decoration. Many of the small shields upon the cushion and surcoat bear the arms of Valence, others those of England.\n\nEdward Talbot, eighth Earl of Shrewsbury, and his wife, Jane Cuthbert (1617). A fine Elizabethan tomb, once richly gilt, with effigies in the costume of James I. A little daughter kneels at her mother's feet.\n\n(In the pavement) Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1678), grandson of the famous Lord Herbert. A blue stone.\n\nSir Richard Pecksall (1571), Master of the Buckhounds to Elizabeth, kneeling with his two wives, under three Corinthian arches. Four daughters kneel beneath their father.\n\nA great Gothic recess containing the effigy of Sir Bernard Brocas (1399-1400), Chamberlain to the Queen of Richard II., beheaded on Tower Hill for joining in a conspiracy to reinstate him. He won the head of a crowned Moor, on which his helmet rests, and it was before this tomb that Sir Roger de Coverley listened particularly to the account of the lord who had cut off the King of Morocco's head. An inscription recording this feat formerly hung above the tomb. See Gough's Sepulchral Monuments. The statue is in complete armour.\n\n(In front) Humphrey Bourchier, son of Lord Berners, who died 1470, fighting for Edward IV. in the battle of Barnet. The brass figure is gone, but some shields and other ornaments remain.\n\nJohn, Lord Russell (1548), second son of the second earl. He lies with his face towards the spectator. At his feet is his infant son Francis, who died in the same year. His widow, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, and sister of Lady Burleigh, who from Deathe would take his memorie, commemorates his virtues in Latin, Greek, and English. She was first married to Sir Thomas Hobby of Bisham Abbey, where she is supposed to have beaten her little boy to death for blotting his copy-book, and which is still haunted by her ghost.\n\nElizabeth Russell, daughter of the above John, seated asleep in her osier chair, with her foot upon a scroll, and the epitaph, Dormit, non mortua est. The pedestal is very richly decorated. This figure was formerly shown as that of a lady who died of the prick of a needle.\n\n(Sir Roger de Coverley) was conducted to the figure which represents that martyr to good housewifery who died by the prick of a needle. Upon our interpreter's telling us that she was a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth, the knight was very inquisitive into her name and family; and, after having regarded her finger for some time, I wonder, says he, that Sir Richard Baker has said nothing of her in his Chronicle. -Spectator, No. 329.\n\n(In the pavement, most inappropriately placed here) Edward Bulwer Lytton, Lord Lytton (1866), the novelist, chiefly known as the author of Rienzi, The Last Days of Pompeii, and The Caxtons.\n\nLady Jane Seymour, daughter of Edward, Duke of Somerset, and cousin of Edward VI. (1561). A tablet.\n\nKatherine, Lady Knollys (1568), daughter of William Carey and his wife Mary Boleyn, and sister to Lord Hunsdon. She attended her aunt, Queen Anne Boleyn, upon the scaffold, and was afterwards Chief Lady of the Bedchamber to her cousin Elizabeth. A tablet.\n\nOn a pedestal, the seated figure of Francis Holles, third son of John Earl of Clare, 1622, who died at eighteen on his return from the Flemish war. He is represented (by Nicholas Stone) in Roman armour, with the epitaph- Man's life is measured by the worke, not dayes, No aged sloth, but active youth, hath prayse.\n\n*Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk (1559), niece of Henry VIII., daughter of Charles Brandon, Duke of Southfolke, and Marie the French queen, first wife to Henrie, Duke of Southfolke, after to Adrian Stocke, Esq. By her second husband, married during the great poverty and distress into which she fell in the reign of Mary (after the death of her daughter, Lady Jane Grey), this tomb was erected, bearing a beautiful coroneted effigy. Her funeral service was the first English Protestant service after the accession of Elizabeth, by whom she was restored to favour.\n\nNicholas Monk, Bishop of Hereford (1661), brother of the famous Duke of Albemarle.\n\n(In the corner) Tablet to John Paul Howard, Earl Stafford (1762), surrounded by the quarterings of the Stafford family, who descend by ten different marriages from the royal blood of France and England. The epitaph tells how his heart was entirely great and noble as his high descent; faithful to his God; a lover of his country; a relation to relations; a detestor of detraction; a friend to mankind.\n\n* William of Windsor and Blanche of the Tower (1340); infant children of Edward III. A tiny altar-tomb bears their effigies-the boy in a short doublet, with flowing hair encircled by a band; the girl in studded bodice, petticoat, and mantle, with a horned head-dress.\n\nIt is interesting to remember that all the illustrious brothers and sisters of the little Princess Blanche stood around this her grave at her funeral-Edward the Black Prince, Lionel of Clarence, John of Gaunt, Edmund of Langley, Isabella de Coucy, and Joanna, afterwards Queen of Castile. Tomb of the Children of Edward III.\n\n* John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1334), second son of Edward III. (named from his birthplace), who died in his nineteenth year, and was expressly ordered to be buried entre les royals. The effigy is of great antiquarian interest from the details of its plate armour. The effigy wears a surcoat, gorget, and a helmet, open in front to show the features, and surrounded by a coronet of large and small trefoil leaves alternated, being the earliest known representation of the ducal form of coronet.There were no Dukes in England until two years after his death. Two angels sit by the pillow, and around the tomb are mutilated figures of the royal relations of the dead. The statuettes of the French relations are towards the chapel, and have been cruelly mutilated, but the English relations facing St. Edward's Chapel have been protected by the strong oak screen, and are of the most intense interest. Edward II. is represented here, who is buried at Gloucester Cathedral. Here, on the left hand of the husband whose cruel murder she caused, is the only known portrait of the wicked Isabella the Fair, daughter of Philip le Bel, who died at Castle Rising, in 1358; she wears a crown at the top of her widow's hood, and holds a sceptre in her right hand. Here also alone can we become acquainted with the characteristics of her aunt, the stainless Marguerite of France, the granddaughter of St. Louis, who at the age of twenty became the second wife of Edward I., and dying at Marlborough Castle in 1317, was buried in the Grey Friars' Church in London; she wears a crown of fleur-de-lis over her widow's veil. This tomb of Prince John was once shaded by a canopy of exquisite beauty, supported on eight stone pillars--a forest of Gothic spires intermingled with statues; it was destroyed in a rush of spectators at the funeral of the Duchess of Northumberland in 1776. Fuller mentions John of Eltham as the last son of a King of England who died a plain earl; the title of Duke afterwards came into fashion.\n\nPassing, on the right wall of the ambulatory, the monument of , brother of the Earl of Thanet (), who gave his name to , ; and treading on the grave of , the antiquary (), whose pennon formerly hung above his grave,[n.260.1] we enter the (Bishop of Myra), separated from the aisle by a perpendicular stone screen adorned with a frieze of shields and roses. It is filled with Elizabethan tombs, and is still the especial burial-place of the Percys. In the centre is a noble altar-tomb by [n.260.2] to Sir George Villiers, , the Leicestershire squire, who was the father of the famous Duke of Buckingham, and his wife, Mary Beaumont. This Sir George Villiers was the subject of the famous ghost story given by Clarendon,[n.260.3] the\n\nman of venerable aspect\n\nwho thrice drew the curtains of\n\n261\n\nthe bed of a humble friend at Windsor, and bade him go to his son the Duke of Buckingham, and warn him that, if he did not seek to ingratiate himself with the people, he would have but a short time to live. This Mary Beaumont it was who, as Countess of Buckingham, also so vividly foresaw her son's death, that though she had been\n\noverwhelmed in tears and in the highest agony imaginable,\n\nafter taking leave of him upon his last visit to her, yet, when she received the news of his murder,\n\nseemed not in the least degree surprised.\n\nClose beside this tomb now rests the body of , daughter of Charles VI. of France and Isabeau of Bavaria. After the close of her brief married life, in which, as the queen of Henry V., she was\n\nreceived in England as if she had beer an angel of God,\n\n[n.261.1] being widowed at , she sank at once into obscurity. Her son Henry VI. was taken from her guardianship and brought up by the Earl of Warwick, and falling in love with Owen Tudor, a handsome Welsh squire of her Windsor guard, and marrying him secretly, she became the mother of sons and a daughter; but the indignation excited by her caused her children to be taken from her, her husband to be imprisoned in Newgate, and herself confined in Abbey, where she died in . She was buried in the Lady Chapel at the east end of the Abbey. When that chapel was destroyed by Henry VII., her coffin was placed by her husband's tomb, where her mummified body was exposed to view, and was kissed by Pepys on his birthday. It was buried here in . Making the circuit of the chapel from the right, we see the tombs of-\n\n262\n\n* Phllippa, Duchess of York, daughter of John, Lord Mohun, and wife of Lord Fitzwalter, Sir John Golofre, and lastly of Edmund Plantagenet (Edmund of Langley ), fifth son of Edward III., killed at the Battle of Agincourt. After his death she obtained the Lordship of the Isle of Wight, and resided in Carisbrook Castle, where she died, and whence she was brought with royal honours to Westminster. Her effigy (much injured) wears a long cloak and mantle, with a wimple and plaited veil. Her tomb is the earliest in this chapel, in the centre of which it formerly stood. It once had a canopy decorated with stars and a painting of the Passion.\n\nElizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland (1776), in her own right Baroness Percy, Lucy, Poynings, Fitz Payne, Brian, and Latimer; sole heiress of Algernon, Duke of Somerset, and of the ancient Earls of Northumberland.\n\nWinifred Brydges, Marchioness of Winchester (1581). Above this the effigy of Lady Ross, wife of the Earl of Exeter, grandson of Lord Burleigh.\n\nElizabeth Cecil, Countess of Exeter, 1591.\n\nThe Gothic canopied altar-tomb of William Dudley, first Dean of Windsor, and Bishop of Durham (1483), uncle of Henry VII.'s financier. His figure is gone. Lying upon the tomb is the effigy of Catherine, Lady St. John (1614), moved from the Chapel of St. Michael to make way for the Nightingale monument.\n\nAn obelisk of white marble on a black pedestal supports a vase containing the heart of Anne Sophia, the infant daughter of Count Bellamonte, ambassador from France to James I. She died in 1605.\n\nTomb of Mildred Cecil, Lady Burleigh, one of the four learned daughters of Sir Anthony Coole, 1589, and Anne Vere, Countess of Oxford, 1588, the wife and daughter of the great Lord Burleigh. An enormous Corinthian tomb, twenty-four feet high. The figure of Lady Burleigh lies on a sarcophagus; at her head and feet are her only son Robert Cecil, and her three grand-daughters, Elizabeth, Bridget, and Susannah. In a recess is the recumbent figure of the Countess of Oxford. In the upper story Lord Burleigh is seen, kneeling in his robes--the effigy in which Sir Roger de Coverley was well pleased to see the statesman Cecil on his knees. The epitaphs are from his pen, and tell how his eyes were dim with tears for those who were dear to him beyond the whole race of womankind. Lord Burleigh himself lay in state here, but was buried at Stamford.\n\nSir G. Fane (1618), and his wife Elizabeth le Despencer. A mural monument, with kneeling statues.\n\nNicholas, Lord Carew (1470), the friend of Edward IV., and his wife. A plain altar-tomb.\n\nNicholas Bagnall, an infant of two months old, by his nvrs unfortvnately overlayed (1687-8). A pedestal with a black pyramid and urn.\n\n*Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset (1587), widow of the great Protector, sister-in-law of Queen Jane, and aunt of Edward VI. She died aged ninety, far on in the reign of Elizabeth. The tomb was erected by her son, Lord Hertford, in this doleful dutie carefull and diligent.\n\nLay Jane Clifford, 1679. An odd square sarcophagus.\n\n*Sir Humphry Stanley (1505), who fought for Henry VII. at the Battle of Bosworth, where he was knighted on the field of battle. A Brass of a figure in plate armour.\n\nElizabeth Brooke (1591), wife of Sir Robert Cecil, son of the great Lord Burleigh. An altar-tomb.\n\nReturning to the aisle, on the left is the monument of , the poet, Secretary to James I., , with a noble bust. On the right is that of , Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, . Beneath the pavement lie , Lord High Treasurer, , and , , husband of Philippa, Duchess of York.\n\nWe now reach the glorious portico which overarches the aisle under the . Beneath it, in an awful gloom which is rendered more solemn by the play of golden light within, a grand flight of steps leads to the ., erected under the care of Bolton, the Architect-Prior of St. Bartholomew's, in the place of the Lady Chapel of Henry III.,[n.263.1] the burial-place of almost all the sovereigns from Henry VII. to George II., the finest\n\n264\n\nPerpendicular building in England, called by Leland\n\nthe miracle of the world,\n\n-far finer than its rival, at Cambridge.\n\nThe Chapel of Henry VII. is indeed well called by his name, for it breathes of himself through every part. It is the most signal example of the contrast between his closeness in life, and his magnificence in the structures he hath left to posterity --King's College Chapel, the Savoy, Westminster. Its very style was a reminiscence of his exile, being learned in France by himself and his companion Fox. His pride in its grandeur was commemorated by the ship, vast for those times, which he built, of equal cost with his chapel, which afterwards, in the reign of Mary, sank in the sea, and vanished in a moment. It was to be his chantry as well as his tomb, for he was determined not to be behind the Lancastrian princes in devotion; and this unusual anxiety for the sake of a soul not too heavenward in its affections expended itself in the immense apparatus of services which he provided. Almost a second abbey was needed to contain the new establishment of monks, who were to sing in their stalls as long as the world shall endure. Almost a second shrine, surrounded by its blazing tapers, and shining like gold with its glittering bronze, was to contain his remains. To the Virgin Mary, to whom the Chapel was dedicated, he had a special devotion. Her in all his necessities he had made his continual refuge; and her figure, accordingly, looks down upon his grave from the east end, between the apostolic patrons of the Abbey, Peter and Paul, with the holy company of heaven--that is to say, angels, archangels, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, evangelists; martyrs, confessors, and virgins, to whose singular mediation and prayers he also trusted, including the royal saints of Britain, .St. Edward, St. Edmund, St. Oswald, St. Margaret of Scotland, who stand, as he directed, sculptured, tier above tier, on every side of the Chapel, some retained from the ancient Lady Chapel, the greater part the work of his own age. Round his tomb stand his nine accustomed avours or guardian saints, to whom he calls and cries -- St. Michael, St. John the Baptist, St. John the Evangelist, St. George, St. Anthony, St. Edward, St. Vincent, St. Anne, St. Mary Magdalene, and St. Barbara, each with their peculiar emblems,-- so to aid, succour, and defend him, that the ancient and ghostly enemy, nor none other evil or damnable spirit, have no power to invade him, nor with their wickedness to annoy him, but with holy prayers to be intercessors for him to his Maker and Redeemer. These were the adjurations of the last mediaeval king, as the Chapel was the climax of the latest medieval architecture. In the very urgency of the King's anxiety for the perpetuity of. those funeral ceremonies, we seem to discern an unconscious presentiment of terror lest their days were numbered.--Dean Stanley.\n\nIt is said that on looking back from the portico of Henry VII.'s Chapel, every phase of Gothic architecture, from Henry III. to Henry VII., may be seen. The glorious brass gates are adorned with all the badges of the founder--the fleur-de-lis, the portcullis and crown, the falcon and fetterlock, the thistle and crown, the united roses of York and Lancaster entwined with the crown, the initials R. H., the royal crown, and the lions of England.. The devices of Henry VII. are also borne by the angels sculptured on the frieze at the west end of the chapel. The windows have traces of the white roses of Lancaster and of the fleur-de-lis and H's with which they were once filled; from the end window the figure of Henry VII. looks down upon the whole. statues, whose\n\nnatural simplicity and grandeur of character and drapery\n\nare greatly commended by Flaxman, surround the walls.\n\nThe very walls are wrought into universal ornament, encrusted with tracery, and scooped into niches, crowded with statues of saints and martyrs. Stone seems, by the cunning labour of the chisel, to have been robbed of its weight and density, suspended aloft, as if by magic, and the fretted roof achieved with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb.-Washington Irving.\n\nThe stalls of the Knights of the Bath surround the chapel, with the seats for the esquires in front. The end stall on the right is decorated with a figure of Henry VII. The sculptures on the misereres are exceedingly quaint, chiefly monkish satires on the evil lives of their brethren. Amongst them are combats between monks and nuns, a monk seized\n\n266\n\nand a monk carried off by the devil, boy whipping another, apes gathering nuts, and a fox in armour riding a goose. The best is the Judgment of Solomon; the cause of the contention--the substitution of the dead for the living child--is represented with ludicrous simplicity, repeated on either side of the bracket.\n\nThe centre of the chapel towards the east is occupied by the glorious tomb of . () and (),\n\none\n\nof the stateliest and daintiest monuments of Europe,\n\n[n.266.1] executed for by the famous ; the screen, which is no less beautiful, being the work of English artisans. The tomb is chiefly of black marble, but the figures and surrounding alto-relievos and pilasters are of gilt copper. The figures, wrapped in long mantles which descend to the feet, are most simple and\n\n267\n\nbeautiful. They once wore crowns, which have been stolen. Within the screen, Henry enjoined by his will that there. should be a small altar, enriched with relics- of the legs of St. George and a great piece of the Holy Cross.\n\nElizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV., by whose marriage the long feud between the houses of York and Lancaster was terminated, died in childbirth at the Tower, on her birthday, -. Her sister, Lady Katharine Courtenay, was chief mourner at her magnificent funeral in the Abbey. Henry survived his wife for years, and died at Richmond in . Bishop Fisher preached his funeral sermon, which was printed by Wynkyn de Worde, at the desire of the\n\nking's\n\nmoder\n\n.\n\nIn this chappel the founder thereof, with his queen, lieth interr'd, under a monument of solid brass, most richly gilded, and artificially carved. Some slight it for the cheapness, because it cost but a thousand pounds in the making thereof. Such do not consider it as the work of so thrifty a prince, who would make a little money go far; besides that it was just at the turning of the tide (as one may term it) of money, which flowed after the finding out of the West Indies, though ebbing before.-Fuller's Worthies.\n\nHenry VII. was of a high mind, and loved his own will and his own way; as one that revered himself, and would reign indeed. Had he been a private man he would have been termed proud. But in a wise prince, it was but keeping of distance, which indeed he did towards all .... To his confederates he was constant and just, but not open .... He was a prince, sad, virtuous, and full of thoughts and secret observations, and full of notes and memorials of his own hand, especially touching persons ...... No doubt, in him, as in all men, and most of all in him, his fortune wrought upon his nature, and his nature upon his fortune. He attained to the crown, not only from a private fortune, which might endow him with moderation; but also from the fortune of an exiled man, which had quickened in him all seeds of observation and industry. And his times being rather prosperous than calm, had raised his confidence by success, but almost marred his nature by troubles.-Bacon's Life of Henry VI.\n\n268\n\nIn the same vault with Henry and Elizabeth rests the huge coffin of . (). His funeral sermon was preached by Dean Williams, who compared him to Solomon in particulars I In front of the tomb of his grandparents is the restored altar which marks the burial-place of (), who died at Greenwich in his year-the good and strangely learned prince of whom Hooker says that\n\nthough he died young, he lived long, for life is in\n\naction.\n\nThe ancient altar--a splendid work of Torrigiano-was destroyed in the Civil Wars, but part of the frieze was found in in the young king's grave, and has been let into the modern altar. It is admirable carving of the Renaissance, and shows the Tudor roses and the lilies of France interwoven with a scroll-work pattern. On the coffin-plate of the young king is inscribed-after his royal titles-\n\nOn earth under Christ of the Church of England and Ireland supreme head\n\n-having been evidently engraved during the days' reign of Lady Jane Grey. The revived altar was used in , on the strange occasion when Dean Stanley administered the Sacrament to the revisers of the New Testament-\n\nrepresentatives of almost every form of Christian belief in England\n\n-before they commenced their labours.\n\nInserted in this altar of toleration, by a quaint power of seeing threads of connection where they are not generally apparent, are--a fragment of an Abyssinian altar brought from Magdala in ; a fragment of a Greek Church in Damascus destroyed in the Christian massacre of ; a fragment of the high altar of Canterbury, destroyed when the cathedral was burnt in .\n\n269\n\nMaking the circuit of the chapel from the right, we see in the pavement the inscribed graves of-\n\nHenry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland (1790), fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, the hero of Culloden.\n\nCaroline (1757), third daughter, and Amelia (1786), second daughter, of George U.\n\nLouisa (1768), third daughter of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Edward, Duke of York ( 1769), his second son, who died at Monaco.\n\nQueen Caroline of Anspach (1737), buried here with Handel's newly composed anthem, When the ear heard her, then it blessed her, &c.\n\nKing George II. (1760), the last sovereign buried at Westminster, who desired that his dust might mingle with that of his beloved wife, in accordance with which one side of each of the coffins was withdrawn, and they rest together.\n\nWe now reach a chantry, separated from the chapel by a screen, of which only the basement remains, containing the gigantic monument of-\n\nLudovic Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox (1623-4), cousin of James I., Lord Chamberlain, and Lord High Admiral of Scotland. Huge figures of Faith, Hope, Prudence, and Charity support the canopy. The monument was erected by the Duke's widow, who is buried here with all his family. Here also rest the natural son of Charles II. and the Duchess of Portsmouth, who was created Duke of Richmond on the extinction of the former family, and his widow, La belle Stuart of lax morality, whose effigy, by her own request, was placed by her tomb after death as well done in wax as could be, under crown glass and none other, wearing the robes which she bore at the coronation of Queen Anne, and accompanied by the parrot which lived with her grace forty years and survived her only a few days. The black marble pyramid at the foot of the tomb commemorates the infant Esme, Duke of Richmond.\n\nOne curious feature in the tomb deserves notice. In the inscription the date of the year of the Duke's death is apparently omitted, though the month and day are mentioned. The year, however, is given in what is called a chronogram. The Latin translation of the verse in the Bible, Know ye not that a prince and a great man has this day fallen? (the words uttered by David in his lament over Abner,) contains fourteen Roman numeral letters, and these being elongated into capitals are MDCVVVIIIIIIII, which give the date 1623. It is remarkable that words so appropriate to this nobleman should contain the date for this identical year, and it shows much ingenuity on the part of the writer of the inscription that he should have discovered it.-The Builder, June 19, 1875.\n\nWe now come to the of the eastern chapels. On the left is the tomb, by , of Antoine, Duc de Montpensier, brother of Louis Philippe, who died in exile at Salthill, . The inscription is by General Dumouriez. This is the only monument placed in the Abbey for centuries which is in accordance with the taste in which it was built. In the same vault with the Duke lay for some time Louise of Savoy, queen of Louis XVIII., who died in exile at Hartwell in Buckinghamshire. Her remains were removed to Sardinia in .\n\nIn the centre of the chapel is the grave of Lady Augusta Stanley (1876), for thirty years the devoted servant of Queen Victoria, and of the queen's mother and children.\n\nThe was the burial-place of the magnates of the Commonwealth, who, with few exceptions, were exhumed after the Restoration. The bodies of Cromwell, his son-in-law Ireton, and Bradshaw, the regicide judge, were hanged at Tyburn; the mother of Cromwell, with most of her kindred and friends, was buried in a pit near ; Elizabeth Claypole, the favourite daughter of the Protector, was left in peace. Here were once buried-\n\nOliver Cromwell, Lord Protector, 1658.\n\nGeneral Henry Ireton, 1651.\n\nElizabeth Cromwell, mother of the Protector, 1654.\n\nJane Desborough, sister of the Protector, 1656.\n\nAnne Fleetwood, daughter of the Protector.\n\nRobert Deane, 1653.\n\nHumphrey Mackworth, 1654.\n\nSir William Constable, 1655.\n\nAdmiral Robert Blake, 1657.\n\nDennis Bond, 1658.\n\nJohn Bradshaw, 1659.\n\nMary Bradshaw, 1659.\n\nThe vault vacated when the rebels were exhumed w-as afterwards used as the burial-place of (), and all his family.

The monument is by Scheemakers, who has represented the duchess in English dress, while the duke is in Roman armour. In the reign of Charles II. he was general of the Dutch troop of horse, Governor of Kingston Castle upon Hull, and First Gentleman of the Bedchamber; in that of James II., Lord Chamberlain; in that of Queen Anne, Lord Privy Seal, and President of the Council. The concluding lines of his self-composed epitaph are striking-Dubius sed non improbus vixi; incertus morior, non perturbatus. Humanum est nescire et errare. Deo confido omnipotenti, benevolentissimo. Ens entium. miserere mei. Before the words Deo confido, Christum adveneror was originally inserted, but was effaced by Dean Atterbury, on the ground that adveneror was not a sufficient expression as applied to Christ.\n\nOpposite is preserved the wooden Pulpit from which Cranmer preached at the coronation and funeral of his royal godson, Edward VI.\n\nBeneath it, alone, in a spacious vault, lies the body of Queen Anne of Denmark (1619-20), wife of James I., who died at Somerset House. She never had any monument, but her hearse stood over her grave till the Commonwealth.\n\nHard by is the grave of John Campbell, Duke of Argyle and Greenwich (1743), whose monument we have seen in the south transept. With him lies his daughter, Lady Mary Coke (1811), the lively little lady who, in the Heart of Midlothian, banters her father after the interview with Jeanie Deans. Stanley.\n\nThe next , with a low screen, has its western decorations ruined by the tomb of-\n\nGeorge Villiers, Duke of Buckingham (1628), the passionately loved favourite of James I., murdered by Felton, and his duchess. His children kneel at his head. Several of his sons, including Francis and George, whose handsome features are well known from Vandyke's noble picture, rest in their father's grave, together with the last duke, the George Villiers who was the Zimri of Dryden, and whose death-bed is described in the lines of Pope.\n\nHad the Duke of Buckingham been blessed with a faithful friend, qualified with wisdom and integrity, the duke would have committed as few faults and done as transcendent worthy actions as any man in that age in Europe.-Clarendon.\n\nAfter Buckingham's death, Charles the First cherished his memory warmly as his life, advanced his friends, and designed to raise a magnificent monument to his memory; and if any one accused the duke, the king always imputed the fault to himself. He very often said the world was much mistaken in the duke's character; for it was commonly thought the duke ruled his majesty; but it was much the contrary, having been his most faithful and obedient servant in all things, as the king said he would make sensibly appear to the world.Disraeli. Curiosities of Literature.\n\nNear the next pillar is the grave of , daughter of Oliver Cromwell, the only member of\n\n273\n\nthe Protector's family allowed to remain in the Abbey, as being both a royalist and a member of the Church of England. In descending the chapel on this side we pass the graves of-\n\nFrederick, Prince of Wales, father of George III., 1751.\n\nAugusta of Saxe-Gotha, Princess of Wales, 1772.\n\nElizabeth Caroline (1759), and Frederick William (1765), children of the Prince of Wales.\n\nWilliam Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, third son of George II., 1765.\n\nEntering the , we find, beneath the exquisite fan roof, noble tombs.\n\n* Margaret Stuart, Countess of Lennox (1577), first cousin of Queen Elizabeth, being daughter of the Scottish queen, Margaret Tudor, by her second marriage with the Earl of Angus. Lord Thomas Howard was imprisoned for life, for venturing to fall in love with her at the Court of Anne Boleyn, and she was married, in her thirtieth year, to the Earl of Lennox. The epitaph tells how she had to her great. grandfather King Edward IV.; to her grandfather, King Henry VII.; to her uncle, King Henry VIII.; to her cousin-german, King Edward VI.; to her brother, King James V. of Scotland; to her son (Darnley), King Henry I. of Scotland; to her grandchild, King James VI. (of Scotland, and I. of England). The tomb is of alabaster. It bears the effigy of Margaret in robes of state, with a small ruff and a dose coif with a coronet over it. Below are the effigies of her four sons and four daughters (including that of Henry Darnley, King of Scotland, which once had a crown above its head, and that of Charles Lennox, father of the Ladie Arbele (Arabella Stuart). She died in poverty, but was buried here in great state by Elizabeth. An iron railing, decorated with all the armorial bearings of the family, once surrounded this monument.\n\n* Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, 1587. After her execution at Fotheringay she was buried at Peterborough, but was brought thence in 1606 by her son James I., who desired that like honour might be done to the body of his dearest mother, and a like monument be extant of her, that had been done to his dear sister, the late Queen Elizabeth. In her second funeral she had a translucent passage in the night through the city of London, by multitudes of torches, with all the ceremonies and voices quires and copes could express, attended by many prelates and nobles.Wilson's Hist. of the Reign of James I. The tomb is a noble work of the period, with an effigy by Cornelius Cure. The queen is represented as in her pictures, with small and delicate features. She wears a close coif, a laced ruff, a mantle fastened at the breast by a jewelled brooch, and high-heeled shoes; at her feet the crowned lion of Scotland sits keeping guard.\n\n* Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, the great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt, allied, by blood or affinity, to thirty kings and queens. By her first husband, Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond (son of Queen Catherine de Valois, whom rather than the Duke of Suffolk, she espoused by the advice--in a vision-of St. Nicholas, patron of wavering maidens), she was the mother of Henry VII. She married secondly Sir Humphrey Stafford; and thirdly Thomas, Lord Stanley, who placed the crown of Richard III. on the head of her son after the Battle of Bosworth Field, and was created Earl of Derby by him. She died in 1578, at the time of the coronation of her grandson, Henry VIII. She was the foundress of St. John's and Christ's Colleges at Cambridge. Bishop Fisher (her chaplain), who preached her funeral sermon, told truly how Every one that knew her, loved her; and everything that she said or did became her. She was so imbued with the spirit of mediaeval times, that Camden records she would often say that-on the condition that the princes of Christendom would combine and march against the common enemy, the Turk, she would willingly attend them, and be their laundress in the camp. Her effigy, the first work executed by the great Pietro Torrgiano in England, is nobly simple, but executed in a grand and expressive naturalistic manner. Lübke. Her hands are uplifted in prayer, and the aged features are evidently modelled from nature. Her epitaph, by John Skelton, the poet-laureate, ends with a quaint curse upon all who shall spoil or take it away- Qui laceret, violatve, rapit, prasens epitoma. Hunc laceretque voret, Cerberus, absque mora.\n\n(On the left) Catherine Shorter, Lady Walpole ( 1737), the first wife of Sir Robert, afterwards Earl of Oxford. The figure is by talori, after a Roman statue of Modesty, and is beautiful, though injured by the too voluminous folds of its drapery. It was erected by her son, Horace Walpole. She had beauty and wit without vice or vanity, and cultivated the arts without affectation. She was devout, though without bigotry of any sect, and was without prejudice to any party; tho' the wife of a minister, whose power she esteemed but when she could employ it to benefit the miserable or reward the meritorious. She loved a private life, though born to shine in public, and was an ornament to courts, untainted by them.Epitaph, by Horace Walpole.\n\n(Left) General George Monk, Duke of Albemarle, the hero of the Restoration, whose funeral was personally attended by Charles II. The monument, by Scheemakers and Kent, was erected, as the epitaph states, in compliance with the wish of Christopher, Duke of Albemarle, in 1720. The figure of General Monk is represented in armour, without a helmet: a mourning female figure leans upon the medallion of Duke Christopher.\n\nIn front of the step of the ancient altar are buried without monuments-\n\nKing Charles II.

The choir sung a funeral hymn. Bishop Atterbury, one of those Tories who had loved and honoured the most accomplished of the Whigs, met the corpse, and led the procession by torchlight, round the shrine of St. Edward and the graves of the Plantagenets, to the Chapel of Henry the Seventh. On the north side of that chapel, in the vault of the house of Albemarle, the coffin of Addison lies next to the coffin of Montague. Yet a few months, and the same mourners passed again along the same aisle. The same sad anthem was again chanted. The same vault was again opened; and the coffin of Craggs was placed close to the coffin of Addison.-Macaulay.\n\n, the Secretary of State, who has a monument at the west end of the Abbey, was present at Addison's funeral, and was immediately after buried in the same grave.\n\nO! must I then (now fresh my bosom bleeds,\n\nAnd Craggs in death to Addison succeeds)\n\nThe verse, begun to one lost friend, prolong,\n\nAnd weep a second in th' unfinish'd song?\n\nBlest pair, whose union future bards shall tell\n\nIn future tongues, each other's boast, farewell,\n\nFarewell! whom, join'd in fame, in friendship try'd,\n\nNo chance could sever, nor the grave divide. Tickell.\n\n(Right) (), the statesman.\n\nHe was a man of a very great and ready wit; full of life, and very pleasant; much turned to satire .... He confessed he could not swallow down everything that divines imposed on the world: he was a Christian in submission: he believed as much as he could, and he hoped that God would not lay it to his charge, if he could not digest iron, as an ostrich did, or tale into his belief things that must burst him .... But with relation to the public, he went backwards and forwards, and changed sides so often, that in conclusion no one trusted him ... W.. then he talked to me as a philosopher, of his contempt of the world, I asked him, what he meant by getting so many new titles, which I called the hanging himself about with bells and tinsel. He had no other excuse for it but this, that since the world were such fools as to value those matters, a man must be a fool for company.-Burnet. Hist. of His Own Time.\n\n279\n\nIn the centre of the aisle is the noble tomb of--\n\n* Queen Elizabeth (1602), who died at Richmond in the forty-fifth year of her reign, and the seventieth of her age. The monument is by Maximilian Poultraine and John de Critz. Beneath a lofty canopy supported by ten Corinthian pillars, the figure of the queen who was one day greater than man, the next less than woman, is lying upon the low basement on a slab supported by lions. The effigy represents her as an aged woman, wearing a close coif, from which the hair descends in curls: the crown has been stolen. The tomb was once surrounded by a richly wrought railing covered with fleurs-de-lis and roses, with the initials E R interspersed. This, with all the small standards and armorial bearings at the angles, forming as much a part of the monument itself as the stonework, was most unjustifiably removed by Dean Ireland.The almost adoration with which Elizabeth was regarded after her death caused her so-called monument, with a metrical epitaph, curiously varied, to be set up in all the principal London churches; notably so in St. Saviour's, Southwark; St. Mary Woolnoth; St. Lawrence Jewry; St. Mildred, Poultry; and St. Andrew Undershaft. Several of these monuments still exist. Thys queene's speech did winne all affections, and hir subjects did trye to shew all love to hir commandes; for she would say, hir state did require hir to commande, what she knew hir people woude willingly do from their owne love to hir.

We did all love hir, for she said she loved us, and muche wysdome she shewed in thys matter. She did well temper herself towards all at home, and put at variance all abroad; by which means she had more quiet than hir neighbours. ... When she smiled, it was a pure sunshine, that everyone did chuse to baske in, if they could; but anon came a storm from a sudden gathering of clouds, and the thunder fell in wondrous manner on all alike. I never did fynde greater shew of understandinge and learninge, than she was blest wythe, and whoever liveth longer than I can, will look backe and become laudator temporis acti.-Sir John Harington's Letter to Robert Markham in 1606, three years after the death of Elizabeth.\n\nIn the same tomb is buried Mary . (1558). Her obsequies, conducted by Bishop Gardiner, were the last funeral service celebrated in the Abbey according to the Roman Catholic ritual, except the requiem ordered by Elizabeth for Charles V. The stones of the altars in Henry VII.'s Chapel destroyed at the Reformation were used in her vault. At her funeral all the people plucked down the hangings and the armorial bearings round about the abbey, and every one tore him a piece as large as he could catch it. James I. wrote the striking inscription upon the monument--Regno consortes et urnis, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis. In those words, says Dean Stanley, the long war of the English Reformation is closed.\n\n*The eastern end of this aisle has been called the Innocents' Corner. In its centre is the tomb erected in 1674 by Charles II. over the bones found at the foot of the staircase in the Tower, supposed to be those of the murdered boys, Edward V. and Richard, Duke of York.\n\n* On the left is Princess Mary, third daughter of James I. (1607), who died at two years old, about whom her Protestant father was wont to say that he would not pray to the Virgin Mary, but for the Virgin Mary. Fuller's Worthies, i. 49.--Her epitaph tells how she, received into heaven in early infancy, found joy for herself, but left longings to her parents. Such was the manner of her death, as bred a kind of admiration in us all that were present to behold it. For whereas the new-tuned organs of speech, by reason of her great and wearisome sickness, had been so greatly weakened, that for the space of twelve or fourteen hours at least, there was no sound of any word breaking from her lips; yet when it sensibly appeared that she would soon make a peaceable end of a troublesome life, she sighed out these words, I go, I go, and when, not long after, there was something to be ministered unto her by those that attended her in the time of her sickness, fastening her eye upon them with a constant look, she repeated, Away, I go! And yet a third time, almost immediately before she offered herself, a sweet virgin sacrifice, unto Him that made her, faintly cried, I go, I go. . . . And whereas she had used many other words in the time of her extremity, yet now, at the last, she did aptly utter these, and none but these.Funeral Sermon for the Princess Mary, by J. Leech, preached in Henry VI.'s Chapel, Sept. 23, 1607.\n\n* On the right is Princess Sophia (1606), fourth daughter of James I., who died at Greenwich three days after her birth. It is a charming little monument of an infant in her cradle-a royal rose-bud, plucked by premature fate, and snatched away from her parents, that she might flourish again in the rosary of Christ.\n\nThis royal babe is represented sleeping in her cradle, wherewith vulgar eyes, especially of the weaker sex, are more affected (as level to their cognizance, more capable of what is pretty than what is pompous) than with all the magnificent monuments in Westminster.-Fuller's Worthies.\n\nAt the foot of the steps leading to Henry VII.'s Chapel is the grave of (), grandfather of Queen Mary II. and Queen Anne, who died in exile at Rouen, having been impeached for high-treason. We must look back from the northern ambulatory upon the richly sculptured arch of Henry V.'s chantry. It is this arch\n\n282\n\nwhich was so greatly admired by Flaxman. The Coronation of Henry V. is here represented as it was performed in this church by Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry Beaufort, the uncle of the king. Over the canopies which surmount the figures are the alternate badges of the Antelope and Swan (from the king's mother, co-heiress of the Bohuns, and the same animals appear on the cornices chained to a tree, on which is a flaming cresset, a badge which was borne by Henry V. alone, and which was intended as typical of the light by which he hoped to\n\nguide his people to follow him in all honour and virtue.\n\n[n.282.1]\n\nOn the left are the beautiful tombs of Queen Eleanor and of Henry III., and beyond these the simple altar-tomb of Edward I. On the right are the tombs of-\n\nWilliam Pulteney, Earl of Bath (1767), by Wilton.\n\nAdmiral Holmes, 1761.\n\nEntering the , we see before us the noble altar-tomb of-\n\n* Sir Giles Daubeny (1507) and his wife Elizabeth. He was Lord Lieutenant of Calais and Chamberlain to Henry VII. His effigy, which is executed with the minutest care, is in plate armour, with the insignia of the Order of the Garter. Observe the kneeling and weeping monks in relief on the soles of his shoes.\n\nNear this is the stupid colossus, whose introduction here is the most crying evidence of the want of taste in our generation: a monument wholly unsuited in its character to the place, and in its association with its surroundings-which, on its introduction, burst through the pavement by its immense weight, laid bare the honoured coffins beneath,\n\n283\n\nand fell into the vaults below, but unfortunately was not broken to pieces.\n\nJames Watt\n\n(\n\n1819\n\n),\n\nwho directing the force of an original genius early exercised in philosophic research to the improvement of the steam-engine, enlarged the resources of his country and increased the power of man, and rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of science and the real benefactors of the world.\n\nThe inscription is by Lord Brougham, the statue by\n\nChantrey.\n\nMaking the circuit of the chapel from the right, we see the monuments of-\n\n* Lodowick Robsart (1431), and his wife Elizabeth, heiress of Bartholomew Bourchier, after his marriage with whom he was created Lord Bourchier. He was distinguished in the French wars under Henry V., and made the king's standard-bearer for the courage which he displayed upon the field of Agincourt. On the marriage of Henry V. to Katharine de Valois he was immediately presented to the queen, and appointed the especial guardian of her person. His tomb, which forms part of the screen of the chapel, is, architecturally, one of the most interesting in the Abbey. It has an oaken roof in the form called en dos d'âne, and the whole was once richly gilt and coloured, the rest of the screen being powdered with gold Catherine-wheels.\n\nAnne, Lady Cottington (1633), a bust greatly admired by Strype for its simplicity and beauty. Beneath is the reclining effigy of Francis, Lord Cottington (1652), ambassador for Charles I. in Spain, who for his faithfull adherence to ye crowne (ye usyrpers prevayling) was forc't to fly his country, and, during his exile, dyed at Valladolid. Clarendon vi. 465, 467. describes him- A very wise man, by the long and great experience he had in business of all kinds; and by his natural temper, which was not liable to any transport of anger, or any other passion, but could bear contradiction, and even reproach, without being moved, or put out of his way for he was very steady in pursuing what he proposed to himself, and had a courage not to be frighted with any opposition. . . . He was of an excellent humour, and very easy to live with; and, under a grave countenance, covered the most of mirth, and caused more than any man of the most pleasant disposition. He never used anybody ill, but used many very well for whom he had no regard; his greatest fault was, that he could dissemble, and make men believe that he loved them very well, when he cared not for them. He had not very tender affections, nor bowels apt to yearn at all objects which deserved compassion: he was heartily weary of the world, and no man was more willing to die; which is an argument that he had peace of conscience. He left behind him a greater esteem of his parts than love to his person.\n\nFrances Sidney, Countess of Sussex (aunt of Sir Philip), 1589. She was the foundress of Sidney-Sussex College at Cambridge. Her recumbent statue affords a fine specimen of the rich costume of the period: at her feet is her crest, a porcupine, in wood.\n\nDudley Carleton, Viscount Dorchester (1631), Secretary of State under Charles I.There are fine portraits of Dudley Carleton and his wife, by Cornelius Jansen. in the National Portrait Gallery. This tomb was executed by Nicholas Stone for 4,200. Sir Thomas Bromley (1587), who succeeded Sir Nicholas Bacon as Lord-Chancellor in the reign of Elizabeth, and presided at the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. The alabaster statue represents the chancellor in his robes: the official purse appears at the back: his children, by Lady Elizabeth Fortescue, kneel at an altar beneath.\n\nSir James Fullerton (1630-3 ), and Mary his wife. He was first Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Charles I. He dyed fuller of faith than of feare, fuller of resolv'ion than of paiennes; fuller of honvr than of dayes.\n\n[Near the foot of this monument Archbishop Usher was buried in state, March, 1655-56, at the cost of Oliver Cromwell. He died at Reigate. His chaplain, Nicholas Barnard, preached his funeral sermon in the Abbey on the text, And Samuel died, and all the Israelites were gathered together. ]\n\nSir John Puckering (1596), who prosecuted Mary, Queen of Scots, and became Keeper of the Great Seal under Elizabeth. The monument was erected by his widow, who added her own statue; their eight children kneel below.\n\nSir Henry Belasyse of Brancepeth (1717), linealy descended from Belasius, one of the Norman Generals who came into England with William the Conqueror and was knighted by him. The monument is by Scheemakers.\n\n285\n\nThe entrance to the next chapel, or, more properly, the , is of the most picturesque\n\nbits\n\nin the Abbey, dating from the time of Richard II. It is a low arch supported by clustered pillars. The shield on the right bears the arms of old France and England quarterly, viz. semee of fleurs-de-lis and lions passant gardant, and that on the left the arms of Edward the Confessor. Above is\n\nSanctus Erasmus\n\nin black (once golden) letters, and over this an exquisitely sculptured niche with a moulding of vine-leaves. The iron stanchion which held a lamp still remains by the entrance, and within are a holy-water\n\n286\n\nbasin and a bracket for the statue of St. Erasmus (a Bishop of Campania martyred under Diocletian), with the rays which once surrounded the head of the figure still remaining on the wall. Near the entrance is the little monument of (), with a curious relief representing her death.\n\nThrough this shrine we enter the , of which the screen is formed by tombs of bishops and abbots. In the centre is the tomb of-\n\nThomas Cecil, Earl of Exeter (1622), eldest son of Lord Burleigh, and his first wife Dorothy Nevile. The vacant space on the earl's left side was intended for his second wife, Frances Brydges, but she indignantly refused to allow her effigy to lie on the left side, though she is buried with her husband.\n\nMaking the circuit of the chapel from the right, we see the monuments of-\n\nMrs. Mary Kendall (1709-10), who desired that her ashes migh"
