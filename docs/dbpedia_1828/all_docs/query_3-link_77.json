        "text": "Jilly, Mandy, John, Janie & Me, in The Punch Room\n\nLong in the planning, unfortunately Annalisa got her weeks mixed up, but the rest of us found our way to the appointed places at the appointed time.\n\nJohn is keen on cocktail bars these days and was keen to try the Punch Room in the Edition Hotel, which is suitably close to our chosen restaurant, Pahli Hill Bandra Bhai. Ogblog fanatics might recall that John, Mandy, Janie and I went to Pahli Hill relatively recently…\n\n…and so taken with it were we, that we all agreed it would be a suitable venue for this slightly larger gathering. Which it was.\n\nBut first the Punch Room, which had a really good early evening ambiance – good music but not too loud – other trendy people, but not too many and not too loud. Interesting cocktails list. Nice waiting staff.\n\nStrangely, I realised a week or so ago that this weekend is the fortieth anniversary of Jilly’s visit to Keele in February 1984:\n\nThe waiter took a lot of pictures of us (see headline example). We realised that the gathering included two whites, a black and (in maiden name terms) a browning. I thought we should go for a sepia version of the group photo in recognition of this colour palette.\n\nThen a five or six minute stroll through Fitzrovia to the restaurant, Pahli Hill . When you book, they say that you cannot dictate where you would like to sit, but I requested downstairs, where we had previously enjoyed the ambiance before and they e-mailed back to say that they would be able to comply with that request as ours was an early evening booking. John has been back there himself upstairs since our previous visit and concurs that upstairs has less atmosphere to his taste, so I’m especially glad I did that.\n\nNo pictures of Janie in the restaurant, sadly, as she took the following photos, while the rest of us focussed on eating and drinking.\n\nAs with our previous visit to Pahli Hill, by the time we’d finished with small plates and grills, we had no space for big plates, although we did find space for desserts.\n\nIt was a really lovely evening. Great food and drink, but most importantly very enjoyable company.\n\nJohn-Boy Forking Madeleine In Jikoni\n\nAnnalisa Redux, Lunch At Antalya In Bloomsbury, 17 October 2023\n\nAs part of my Ogblog project, I am writing up events of 25, 40 & 50 years ago from old diaries and records. A few weeks ago I wrote up Annalisa’s wedding from 25 years ago…\n\n…and thought I should make a concerted effort to reconnect with Annalisa. I was able to track down Charlotte, Annalisa’s sister, with relative ease. Charlotte put me back in touch with Annalisa, and the result of all that was a very pleasant, long lunch at Antalya Restaurant.\n\nWe had a fair bit of catching up to do, so many years having passed, yet in many ways it felt a bit like catching up after two or three months, not two or three decades, except that the news had a longer span, as it were.\n\nWe’ve resolved to try not to leave it 25 years again. Given the entreaties from my other two mid-October gatherings (see below) that they would love to see Annalisa again, I suspect that we’ll find a way to make it a considerably shorter interval next time.\n\nJilly Black & The Peculiar Matter Of “Rachmaninov Pulling Nudes”, 20 October 2023\n\nI have for some while been helping Jilly to digitise her family photographs from an assortment of different types of negative, transparency, printed pictures and the like. This occasional project hit the temporal buffers over the summer (not least because Jilly’s chosen days tended to end up as train strike days), so was in need of revival.\n\nI more or less expect to receive a note from Jilly explaining why she will be arriving later than the appointed hour (never really a problem for me, given that we are working on this project at the flat), but on this occasion the WhatsApp message gave me pause for thought:\n\nI had to clean an extremely dirty oven and have a coffee…[something about almond milk]…and some Rachmaninov pulling nudes at the same time\n\nI read the message twice, concluded that Jilly must have taken leave of her senses and hunkered down with whatever it was that I was doing for another hour or so before her revised expected arrival time.\n\nJust before Jilly arrived, another message:\n\nOH NO! It was supposed to be “Rachmaninov Preludes”, NOT “pulling nudes”\n\nAs I kindly and considerately put it in my reply:\n\nHa ha. That’s going straight onto the blog at the next available opportunity.\n\nJilly blames the technology for that verbal mishap, which I must say seems, in truth, entirely reasonable. Annalisa will no doubt have a quiet chuckle to herself about that, as I had been banging on about how much more reliable these technologies have become in recent years…which they have…but when they get it wrong, oh boy can they get it wrong!\n\nAnyway, as always, a very pleasant lunch and afternoon with Jilly, during which we not only digitised quite a lot of her non-standard family negatives but Jilly kindly helped me to identify the locations of my family pictures from Sicily nearly 50 years ago, as Jilly did some tour-guiding there “back in the day”.\n\nJohn-Boy Forking Madeleine At The End Of A Fine Meal At Jikoni, 24 October 2023\n\nDinner with John is always long overdue, because if we were both in town more often and had more time on our hands our get togethers would be far more frequent.\n\nActually our previous gathering had been all four of us (including Janie and Mandy), which was supposed to have been five of us, but Pady Jalali had to cancel her visit.\n\nIt was John’s turn to choose and he chose really well with Jikoni. A really charming place with friendly staff and excellent grub.\n\nWe ate:\n\nBurrata, Bitter Leaves & Figs (with Roasted Muscat Grapes, Pomegranate Dressing)\n\nWild Mushrooms on Toast (with Curry Hollandaise, Autumn Truffle)\n\nRoasted Hake & Clams or Butternut Squash Moilee (with Coconut Chutney)\n\nKuku Paka, Sukuma Wiki (with Saffron Rice)\n\nPaan Madeleines (see headline picture)\n\nI hadn’t realised, but Bella (John & Mandy’s younger daughter) is really into cooking now, both as a hobby and latterly at work. John spotted the Jikoni cook books and decided to treat Bella to one of them.\n\nRavinder Bhogal (the chef/proprietor/author) took the trouble to chat with us and make a personalised dedication to Bella in the book, which I thought was a charming touch.\n\nLenny Henry was in the restaurant that night. John reminded me that we had seen him in person before, when he performed at one of our Keele Balls during our sabbatical year. I was able to claim a far more recent sighting – in May when Janie and I went to see Lenny Henry’s excellent one-man play, August In England.\n\nAs always with John, the evening flew by and on this occasion we found ourselves the last people in the restaurant. We realised once we spotted that the staff were oh-so-discreetly clearing up around us!\n\nShane Warne from Wikimedia – Tourism Victoria from Australia, CC BY 2.0\n\nTo lose one cricket great in a day may be regarded as misfortune…\n\n…but this piece is not the place for that kind of joke.\n\nRod Marsh and Shane Warne were both great Australian cricketers – larger-than-life personalities. I was lucky enough to see both play live – in Shane Warne’s case many times.\n\nRod Marsh (1947-2022)\n\nRod Marsh was one of my “love-to-hate” heroes from my school days. Heroes from school days leave their mark in a different, perhaps more indelible way.\n\nPeter Mason’s Guardian obituary is well writ with a super picture.\n\nI only saw Rod Marsh play live once, although, on TV, as a kid, I saw lots of him. Latterly, as I got to see lots of cricket live, Rod Marsh’s was a face I’d quite often see around the grounds (in my case Lord’s and Edgbaston), especially during the Ashes.\n\nHere is my report of the one time I saw Rod Marsh play live. Marsh was one of the Aussie players who walked around the ground to entertain and chat with the crowd on that relentlessly gloomy weather day.\n\nI learnt that Rod Marsh had died early morning, before going to the gym and progressing with the rest of my day.\n\nA Day Going Through Old Photos With Jilly, Oblivious To The Extent Of Cricketing Greats Loss\n\nI spent a very pleasant day with Jilly Black, going through her photo archives, doing a bit of scanning and working out how we might scan a plethora of differently sized films etc.\n\nNaturally a hearty lunch and general catch up chat formed the centrepiece of such a day, but below is one of the few dozen pictures we did actually scan.\n\nRoberta & Jilly while at the notorious Kibbutz Afek, 1980\n\nI had spent several days at the start of my summer job in 1980, stressed out of my tiny brain trying to sort out the sh*t-shower I inherited that was the (almost aptronymic) Afek Group.\n\nJilly and I had such a laugh when we spotted that Jilly had written “Afek 1981” on the photo packet. After stating with certainty that the omnishambles had been in 1980, I suggested two possibilities for the 1981 mention:\n\nthat Jilly had labelled the pictures many years later and had misremembered the Afek year by one year;\n\ndespite everything that had gone wrong and all the pains I (and others) had gone through to try to relieve the suffering of the youngsters, that crazy bunch of teenagers had returned to Afek the following year for a further dose of draconian discipline and disease.\n\nI concluded that the most likely answer was the second of the two, not least because Jilly is so good with numbers.\n\nAfter Jilly left, I looked at the news headlines on my smart phone and learnt that Shane Warne had also died that day.\n\nShane Warne (1969-2022)\n\nMatthew Engel’s obituary in The Guardian is especially good and thorough.\n\nI saw Shane Warne play live many times between the late 1990s and the end of his playing career.\n\nAlthough I saw him representing Australia far more often than I saw him play county cricket, my favourite memory of watching him play is from a county match.\n\nI wrote it up at the time on the Middlesex Till We Die website. I’m sure the current editorial team will forgive me for extracting the most relevant three paragraphs here, but if you want to read the whole piece you can find it on the MTWD site here.\n\nWatching Warne ----------------------- Thursday night I had time to come and see the end of play and sat behind Shane Warne's arm for over an hour. Friday morning, knowing the folks weren't due to arrive for another 30-40 minutes, I sat in the Pav and watched him from in front of his arm. It really is a wonderful thing to be able to sit in exactly the spot of your choice watching a player of that quality bowling live. I should add, by the way, that I think Ed Smith and Ed Joyce played Warne extremely well on Thursday and Friday. The man is a legend and was bowling really well. Forget the joke runs that Ed Smith made at the end of the innings - he deserved them really; his first 100 was worth 150 when you consider the quality of bowling he neeeded to see off to get there. A Couple of Wickets and Joke Bowling ----------------------------------------------------- As soon as I got paged by my mother and went towards the gate to meet the folks, a couple of wickets fell. Joyce and Styris. It was to be that sort of day. I took the parents into the Long Room and sat them down for the famous \"Long Room view\" of the cricket. The match was moving along pretty slowly. 3 or 4 minutes later, I see Warney coming our way. I explain hurriedly to my folks that this man is a living legend, but neither of them have heard of him! The grumpy gent sitting in the high chair behind us makes an audible disapproving snort noise. Mum asks if it would be appropriate to congratulate Warny, on his return, for the achievements I have just described to her. I suggest that he has probably had enough adulation and will be able to get by without hers. I then explain to them why I thought he'd come off (agreement) and what was going to happen next (joke bowling), which seemed ridiculously complicated and silly to the parents (understandably). Soon Nic Pothas is bowling. I explain that he is the wicket keeper and doesn't normally bowl. I also explain that he is an eccentric who wears different coloured underpants depending on whether he is batting, keeping or training. I wonder whether he even has a bowling colour of underpants and whether he had the opportunity to change into them. Even Mr Snortnoise seems to approve of this joke.\n\nI wrote up that 2006 day at Lord’s for Ogblog more recently – links to the MTWD piece are included in this link:\n\nIt was truly a bittersweet. nostalgia-laden day. A really agreeable catch up with Jilly, sadly tinged and sandwiched by the sad news from the cricketing world. Such is life.\n\nIt was a strange period; the height of summer in regular times but the autumn of the pandemic, as it were.\n\nThe government had signalled a possible “relaxing of pandemic restrictions” for towards the end of June, but the highly infectious delta variant of Covid 19 led to the deferral of that “freedom day” until 19 July.\n\nThere was much re-jigging of diaries and arrangements in the weeks leading up to and following the revised date.\n\nFor the most part, Janie and I carried on doing what we had been doing during partial lockdown: working, volunteering and playing tennis.\n\nMiddlesex v Leicestershire, Merchant Taylors’ School, 12 & 13 July 2021\n\nThe plan was for me and Janie to go with Fran & Simon on Monday 12 July, but plans have a habit of going awry. The weather forecast for the Monday was awful and indeed it was heaving down with rain in Ealing.\n\nJanie and I abandoned all hope of going to the game by mid afternoon, despite the fact that the rain was mysteriously dodging Northwood and play was taking place beneath leaden skies.\n\nI’m rather glad we did decide to bale out of going, as I learnt the next day that it took people from Ealing/Acton way a couple of hours to get home due to the flash floods.\n\nSimon ended up watching some rather good cricket solo on the Monday, while I ended up doing similar on the Tuesday.\n\nI had arranged to play real tennis at Middlesex University early on the Tuesday morning and went on from there to MTS for my first sight of live county cricket since September 2019.\n\nSocial distancing was still the order of the day, so I sat in a reserved area and was suitably reserved.\n\nWe were allowed to stroll a bit, which enabled me to encounter some of “the usual suspects”, such as Barmy Kev and Jeff Coleman, who for some obscure reason were bemoaning Middlesex’s poor play and poor luck this season.\n\nI tried to cheer myself up by reading The Economist, which for some obscure reason was bemoaning the economic devastation caused by the global pandemic.\n\nMiddlesex were in a bit of a hole second dig, so I do understand why people were pessimistic, especially as Middlesex had been snatching defeat from the very jaws of victory all season. Still, I was strangely optimistic about Middlesex’s position given my previous experiences of seeing teams bat last at MTS.\n\nFor once, I called it right – click here for the match scorecard .\n\nEaling Samaritans Gunnersbury Park Party, Tuesday 20 July 2021\n\nJanie had hardly met any of her new Samaritans colleagues before, other than in an “on shift” context, as she had done all of her training by Zoom and they had not been able to meet socially during lockdown.\n\nSo the “party in the park” idea seemed to be the ideal opportunity to meet some more people…\n\n…which indeed it was. It was just a shame that, apart from Janie and Ilkay, whom Janie had already befriended and met, no-one from their traning group attended that night.\n\nStill, Alison Shindler (coincidentally an old friend of mine from BBYO, as reported here) was there with her husband Joe, which was fun. We met some other very nice Samaritans volunteer folk including some of the Ealing grandees.\n\nJanie was so late back from work, however, that we missed the entertainment for the evening, Marie Naffah, who was doing 50 gigs in 50 days, apparently. We arrived just in time to say goodbye to her, so for now the video below will have to do.\n\nThe Hundred: London Spirit v Oval Invincibles Double Header, Lord’s, Sunday 25 July 2021\n\nIn the end we only got to see half a double-header, as the weather closed in after the women’s match. What was predicted to be the possibility of some light showers turned out to be torrential rain and flash floods which caused havoc around London.\n\nMercifully, my weather app tipped me off before the weather got too bad.\n\nI have reported the event for King Cricket, click here or below:\n\nJust in case anything ever happens to King Cricket, a scrape of that article can be found here.\n\nDespite shortened event due to the weather, we rather enjoyed ourselves. I had arranged to return for the midweek games myself and Janie was scheduled to join me on Finals Day, so we anticipated that we’d still get our fill of The Hundred.\n\nMiddlesex v Durham at Radlett, Tuesday 27 July 2021\n\nJanie and I had an early game of tennis, then met Simon at lunchtime/early afternoon at Radlett. I chatted briefly with Mike O’Farrell and others, holding up the process of finding some decent seats and settling in for some old-fashioned List A 50-overs-a-side cricket.\n\nThe weather sort-of smiled on us until mid to late afternoon, when a shower threatened to end proceedings but in any case was enough to scare us away from an exposed ground such as Radlett.\n\nAfter the rain, a tense Duckworth-Lewis finish, which Janie and I watched on the stream at home. As has been the way this season, Middlesex were “close but no cigar”.\n\nLondon Spirit v Trent Rockets, Double-Header, Lord’s 29 July 2021\n\nIn my desire to really check out The Hundred tournament, I had reserved a member’s place for myself at both of the midweek events at Lord’s. This was the first of them.\n\nI enjoyed the women’s game from the pavilion terrace, where I was sitting right in front of the assembled rockets (as it were) while they waited to do their thing.\n\nI was delighted to be invited to help choose the walk-on music for some of the players, although I didn’t recognise many of the bangin’ hits on offer.\n\nI had planned to take in the men’s game from the sanctuary of the Upper Tavern Stand, but just before the end of the women’s game I was joined by Alvin, who then popped out to make a call before I had the chance to tell him my plans. So I watched the first innings of the men’s game from the pavilion, with Alvin, then relocated to the Tavern Stand for the final innings.\n\nLondon Spirit did not do very well in these matches…\n\n…women…\n\n…and men.\n\nOh well.\n\nCaroline, Alan & Jilly Visit Noddyland, 1 August 2021\n\nLong in the planning, it was super to see Caroline, Alan and Jilly after such a long time.\n\nIn fact, last time we saw Caroline & Alan for a meal, Janie and I were still full of Japan, as it were.\n\nIt’s summer, so Janie went for wild Alaskan salmon as the main, after some nibbles in the garden.\n\nThe afternoon and evening flew by, surprising us all when we realised that it was getting dark. That’s what tends to happen these days.\n\nLondon Spirit v Northern Superchargers, Double-Header, Lord’s, 3 August 2021\n\nAn opportunity to watch some more cricket and get some reading done, I took in the second of the midweek The Hundred double-headers.\n\nI decided to watch the women’s match from the Upper Allen stand and the men’s match from the Upper Tavern.\n\nThe women’s match was probably the best game (i.e. the most exciting game of cricket) I saw all tournament – see the scorecard here.\n\nThe men’s game probably the least exciting.\n\nOh well.\n\nPete Reynolds Memorial At Mosimann’s, 6 August 2021\n\nOur first venture in a cab and our first indoor event since lockdown. Shirley was very keen that we join the event, as we (along with so many of their friends) had been unable to attend the funeral during lockdown.\n\nGrace had organised the event wonderfully well. Mosimann’s is a stunning venue and was well suited to the occasion.\n\nThe speeches were heartfelt and moving, but it was mostly a party, which was, apparently, what Pete wanted. Pete usually got what he wanted in life, I believe, so he was certainly going to have what he wanted in this regard.\n\nWith thanks to Rachelle Gryn Brettler for snapping us in Rossmore Road, preparing to do our FoodCycle run on a wet winter’s day\n\nWe don’t get out much in Lockdown 3.0, other than to buy food and do our charity work.\n\nThat is giving me a chance to crack on with my retro-blogging; I’m working through 1995 & 1996 to cover the Ged & Daisy (Ian & Janie) “25 years ago” story. I’m needing to give more thought, though, to the formerly less well-documented, “40 years on” story of my early days at Keele University.\n\nStrangely, 1981 and 2021 seem to have collided, forty years on.\n\nI wrote last summer about my joy at being asked to make our FoodCycle collections from St Paul’s in Rossmore Road…\n\n…mentioning the superb tapes Graham Greenglass used to make for me, including quirky numbers such as Rossmore Road by Barry Andrews. I still hum it or sing it more often than not when Daisy and I do FoodCycle from there:\n\nDreamy use of sax and double bass on that track.\n\nLast week, I wrote up the very weekend during which several visitors descended on Keele and Graham presented me with a few cassettes, including that very track. The piece below is a thumping good read, even if you weren’t there, including an excellent undergraduate recipe for spaghetti bollock-knees:\n\nOn Wednesday, before Daisy and I did our FoodCycle run, I did an NHS Responder gig to collect a prescription. Strangely the prescription was to be collected at the Tesco Hoover Factory in Greenford. Strange, because also on that little collection of quirky recordings given to me in February 1981 was the song Hoover Factory by Elvis Costello:\n\nSo, by some strange quirk of fate, forty years after being given recordings of those two rather obscure (but wonderful) recordings about lesser-known places in West London, I found myself doing charity gigs from those two very places.\n\nI have already written up the ear worm I got from Hoover Factory a few months after first hearing the song:\n\nBut the early 1980s connection this week does not stop there.\n\nWhile I have been cracking on with the NHS Responder/GoodSAM app as well as FoodCycle, Daisy has been training to become a Samaritan and this week moved on from being a course trainee to becoming a mentee (i.e. doing real sessions with real calls under the supervision of a mentor).\n\nTowards the end of her course, Daisy had been waiting with a little trepidation to find out who her mentor might be. Mentors work closely with their mentees for a few weeks. She knew that it might be one of her course trainers or possibly someone she hadn’t encountered before.\n\nA couple of weeks ago Janie announced that her mentoring instructions had come through and her mentor was a new name to her: Alison Shindler.\n\nGED: Oh, yes, I know Alison Shindler.\n\nDAISY: What do you mean?\n\nGED: She was a leading light in BBYO towards the end of my time there.\n\nDAISY: Might not be the same person…\n\nGED: …Ealing BBYO – bet it is!\n\nOf course it is.\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise.\n\nLess of a surprise though, after their first session together, is that Alison & Daisy seem to be getting along really well. I’m confident that the mentoring partnership should be a very good one.\n\nMeanwhile Alison has furnished me with a photo from so far back in the day, the biggest surprise is that we were in colour back then:\n\nWith thanks to Alison Shindler for this photo\n\nThat’s a c17-year-old me turning around, next to me Simon Jacobs who was central to my “going to Keele” story and part of the “cooking weekend”. In the red scarf I thought was Jilly Black (who has remained friends with me, Daisy and Alison throughout those decades – in fact it is a little surprising we haven’t overlapped before now )…but it turns out to be Emma Cohen disguised as Jilly. Opposite Simon is Lauren Sterling plus, slightly upstaged by Simon’s head, Caroline Curtis (then Freeman) who visited me and Simon at Keele the February 1981 weekend following the “cooking” one.\n\nIt’s all too weird, in a good way.\n\nBut now, after all that excitement, Daisy and I are in temporary exile at the flat. The replacement of the Noddyland boiler has over-run by a day, making Daisy right and me wrong, as usual.\n\nI’ve been grasping for a quirky early 1980s musical connection for a boiler replacement. So my earworm for the tail end of this tale is by that early 1980s mainstay, The Human League – Being Boiled:\n\nIt was no real coincidence that I worked up several pieces about parties of my youth by way of introducing Rohan Candappa’s guest piece last week. I was due to see the Alleyn’s crowd on the Thursday and several old youth club friends on the Saturday.\n\nThursday 6 April 2017\n\nThe Thursday evening was a semi-regular-style gathering of the old Alleyn’s clan in the City. John Eltham tends to organise it and who would have bet against Johnny being the “get together monitor” back in the school days? He wrote:\n\nhere is the plan:\n\n7.00pm Walrus & Carpenter public house- 45 Monument Street\n\n8.30pm wander a whole 10 yards to Rajasthan curry shop ( our usual)\n\nI pre-announced that I didn’t expect to get to the pub until 7:30/8:00 – as I had long-since arranged a game of real tennis early evening.\n\nFun, it was, playing doubles with my allocated doubles partner for this season’s doubles tournament – which will be my first go at the trophy – indeed at any physical sports trophy, since my glorious quarter-final fives victory against Johnny Eltham himself in 1975.\n\nSo I arrived at about 7:50 to be told by Mr David Wellbrook (who else) that I was late and needed to assume drinks monitor duties.\n\nFortunately (and quite naturally) it was John Eltham who was holding the float, to which I added my share and then three of us (Ollie Goodwin the kind third) shared the burden of getting the round in. A small float of “poppadom money” survived the round.\n\nEarly April but such glorious weather – we were gathered outside the Walrus and Carpenter enjoying the setting sun and getting a bit cooler, yet not cold.\n\nIndeed it was quite close to 8:30 when Johnny remarked that it was starting to get a bit parky…nippy even…but in any case it was time to regroup in The Rajasthan.\n\nThat restaurant runs like a well-oiled machine. Long-used to getting unco-ordinated groups of city folk to gather themselves and place their orders – it all just sort-of happens in that restaurant and it is always a decent (if not exceptional) meal.\n\nMy eye was caught by Hariali chicken, which is minimally-described as “Cooked to Chef’s special recipe”. I asked the waiter, who mumbled, “curry-leaf, lemongrass, lots of herbs and spices, very very nice” and I was convinced. Most if not all the others at our table paid far less attention to the detail of their chosen dishes than that.\n\nMost drank beer, but Ollie Goodwin, Lisa Pavlovsky, one other (was it Jerry Moore?) and I formed a small gang of four for white wine, specifically Nika Tiki Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Not the best I’ve ever had but a decent example; I’m sure Sir Nigel Godfrey would approve.\n\nAt my end of the table I was within chatting distance of Gavin Hamilton, Martin Brassell, Paul Driscoll, Ollie Goodwin, Jerry Moore, John Eltham and Mike Jones. Sadly I missed out on proper chat this time with Rohan Candappa, David Wellbrook, Lisa Pavlovsky, Steve “Peanut” Butterworth and the late Chris Grant. By “late”, I mean “arrived half way through the meal”. Not “deceased”, nor “arrived at 7:50, roughly the time I said I would arrive, Mr Wellbrook”.\n\nAs always it was a very pleasant evening indeed. What a treat to be able to take pre dinner drinks outside The Walrus and Carpenter.\n\nSaturday 8 April 2017\n\nLet’s gloss over the Friday, which I had intended to be a “do my own thing/get some blogging done” day but which turned in to a mostly work day. Bitty, stressy work at that, with a shocking game of real tennis thrown in mid-morning.\n\nSaturday, the weather was truly glorious, although Janie and I weren’t really able to take full advantage of the weekend’s exceptional weather until the Sunday.\n\nStill, it enabled us to start our evening with friends at the house in the garden terrace, which is a bonus in April and was a very pleasant way to start the evening. Our record for this feat is a mild 7 January evening with David and Steph – click here, but this April evening in the garden had the added benefit of enjoying light in the earlier stages of the evening and thus enjoying the sunset.\n\nThe guests were Jilly Black, Andrea Dean, Simon Jacobs and Wendy Robbins; all originally friends of mine from BBYO, i.e. going back to when we were teenagers. It is a testament to Janie that she gets on so well with all of them and likewise they have all taken Janie to their hearts.\n\nIt wasn’t long-planned as precisely this group of six, but we had wanted to invite Jilly for ages and she had particularly mentioned that she regretted not being able to see Andrea and Wendy at the party, which Jilly missed, last May.\n\nThen, when I saw Simon in January, around the time we were setting this evening up, realising that he knows and likes all of these people, it seemed only sensible to ask him too.\n\nIt might seem a bit drawn out to some readers, inviting people in early January and setting a date for April, but by our (admittedly rather low) temporal standards, I think we got the gathering planned and implemented pretty quickly.\n\nAnd everyone turned up.\n\nJanie went to town with exotic nibbles; thai-style fish cakes, some flaky-pastry-meaty-parcels and a wonderful chicken liver pate on toasted french stick.\n\nBetween the nibbles and the main course I tried to pacify the guests with a few numbers on Benjy the Baritone Ukulele.\n\nAndrea and Wendy, who are dear, dear friends of mine, appreciative of, but not experts on, music, declared that I have truly mastered the instrument. Jilly and Simon, who are also both dear, dear friends of mine, fine musicians to boot, were both clearly so moved by my performance that neither of them was able to add to Andrea and Wendy’s judgement. I think that says it all.\n\nIt did get a little chilly by the time we went inside. Some might even say “nippy” or “parky”. Anyway, inside we went.\n\nThe centrepiece of the meal was Janie’s signature beef with wasabi sauce dish, which works so well for gatherings of this size and which we knew would be novel to our guests. We’d have to eat it very often indeed to tire of it.\n\nAfter the main course, chocolates, tropical fruits etc.\n\nWhat did we talk about? All sorts.\n\nOld times? – not all that much.\n\nWhat people are up to now? – much more.\n\nThe difficulties involved in grown-up dating and some very funny anecdotes from some around the table reminded me and Janie of the film Through the Wall, which we saw in December – click here.\n\nLess Trump/Brexit talk than usual these days – which was a blessed relief really.\n\nWendy told us the story of her recent visit to Downing Street, which really needs to be an episode of a sit-com, rather than an after dinner anecdote.\n\nIt was really nice to see everyone and (cliche alert) the evening flew by.\n\nWe could do nibbles on the patio again this evening, Sunday – the weather remains glorious. As I write, the sun is still streaming in through the window of my little man cave here in Noddyland.\n\nPostscript\n\nWhile I was posting this piece, Simon Jacobs uploaded a couple of tracks from his forthcoming album. It was possibly one of those Brian Wilson/Lennon-McCartney creative tension moments after hearing my exquisite baritone ukulele playing last night. As Simon himself says on Facebook:\n\nAfter 3 decades of procrastination, I’ve finally recorded some of my own songs – and now the first two of them are on YouTube (one of them even has a video!)\n\nSo please take a listen, subscribe, share with your friends and post your comments… Then, sometime in the summer I’ll release a whole album through the usual channels, tour the world and then of course there’ll be the drugs and the groupies, the breakdown and rehab, the bizarre plastic surgery, the invitation to be an X Factor judge – all the usual humiliations.\n\nOgblog readers might well enjoy one or both of these tracks:\n\nJilly inferred informality but some semblance of dress sense in her invitation, which was a non-electronic thing that came through the post in October but is now gone – hence my inability to state exactly where the party took place…\n\n…update!! Jilly has subsequently sent me a copy of the invitation and some photos, so here is the invitation with the venue details, while I have subtly redacted Jilly’s personal contact details with a picture of Jilly:\n\nI responded in October by e-mail:\n\nJilly\n\nI think your invitation infers that we’d need to be out of our minds to say yes, but we are quite crazy so we are coming to your party anyway.\n\nMany thanks for inviting us and looking forward to seeing you on the day.\n\nLots of love\n\nIan (& pp Janie)\n\nPS I’ll need to invest in a pair of gardening jeans in order genuinely to abstain from coming to the party in same.\n\nHere is Jilly’s response to my response. I should make clear that I am not Jilly’s uncle, but Jilly has called me uncle pretty much since I met her, when I was about 16 and she was about 14:\n\nDear Uncle,\n\nI was fairly confident you were mad enough to come when inviting you, so really glad I didn’t get that completely wrong, and that you are indeed coming. Excellent news.\n\nYou could also just wear any pear of jeans but sit in a muddy field in them beforehand (there are a few close to the hall) if you wanted that kind of look, but could you just let the mud dry before you arrive?\n\nMarvellous.\n\nLook forward to seeing you.\n\nMe xxx\n\nJanie and I ended up sitting at table with several BBYO alumni, not least Sue Jacobs (Simon Jacob’s sister), who sat next to us and was excellent company. We talked cricket a lot, not least because one of Sue’s daughters is very keen. We also sat with some other people we hadn’t met before, who were also very good company. One or two of those people I think we had sort-of met before at one of Jilly’s house parties, but we got to know them better this time.\n\nIt was also good to see Jilly’s sister Caroline (known to me as Frog) again. Also Jilly’s mum, who sadly has dementia now but is able to disguise it for a while.\n\nIt was less than a fortnight since my mum died and only a few days after the funeral, but actually it wouldn’t have occurred to me to miss this party. Indeed, from my point of view it proved to be a real tonic and Jilly seemed to be having a wonderful time with so many of her good friends around her in one go. It was a really jolly event, held in a rather quaint village hall, with a very informal atmosphere and lots of nice people.\n\nUpdate: Jilly has now kindly added details, such as exactly where the party was held, otherwise that type of detail might easily have got lost in the mists of Ogbloggy-foggy-time.\n\nJilly is also questioning some of my above details, such as exactly how old we must have been when we first met, but that is subject matter for further discussion and future Ogblog postings!"
