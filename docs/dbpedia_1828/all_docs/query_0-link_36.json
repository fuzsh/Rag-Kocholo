        "text": "page 13 note a Sir Thomas Percy, second son of Henry Percy, by Mary daughter of Henry Earl of Lancaster, and younger brother to Henry first Earl of Northumberland; a statesman and soldier of distinguished ability and reputation, who had spent a very active life in the service of his country. He was at this time upwards of fifty years of age.\n\nHe had been with the Black Prince in Aquitaine; was his high steward in 1369, and served under him with Chandos, Knolles, Trivet, and others of that school of chivalry.\n\nHe was at the skirmish in which Chandos was slain, on the morning of Dec. 31, 1370; assisted at various military operations in that country, and was at the barbarous sacking of Limoges, the last transaction in which the prince was engaged. When Sir Baldwin Freville, seneschal of Poitou, went into England, he succeeded him; and a contemporary thus speaks of him in this situation:\n\nMonsr. Thomas Percy li vaillant\n\nYfuist ove honour moult grant.\n\nBut, during his absence on an expedition, he had the misfortune to lose the town of Poitiers, where he officially resided, to Bertrand du Guesclin; and he was himself soon after taken prisoner by Evan of Wales, in an affair near the castle of Soubise. His captivity, however, was not of long duration, the castle of Limosin being given up for his ransom in the next year, 47 Ed. III. The prince of Wales and his father, in consideration of his services, granted him, 50 Ed. III. an annuity of an hundred marks out of the exchequer at Caernarvon, and the same sum out of the king's exchequer during his life.\n\nHe officiated at the Coronation of Richard the Second; and next appears, R. II. as admiral of the northern seas, where he made several prizes. As he was passing over into France to the aid of the duke of Britanny, he narrowly escaped suffering shipwreck in the dreadful tempest in which Sir John Arundel and upwards of a thousand others were drowned. Scarcely had the storm ceased, when a Spanish vessel assailed him: he captured it by boarding, after an obstinate resistance, and returned with it into port; then proceeding upon his voyage, carried over his men and horses safely to Brest. He was joint governor of that place with Sir Hugh Calverley. About this time he was named one of the commissioners to settle the infractions of a treaty made with the Scots in the former reign. In 3R. II. he attended the Earl of Buckingham in his expedition into France; and in the next year was employed with the same nobleman and the Earl of Warwick in suppressing the insurrection: he was in the retinue of the king when he met the rebels at Mile-end. Returning to France, he was at the siege of Nantes, and, 5 R. II. was made captain of the castle of Brest, and afterwards of the town, 6 R. II.\n\nHe is spoken of, 7 R. II. as being of the king's council; commissioned to act in treaties with Flanders and France, and to guard the East Marches. In 8 and 10 R. II. he was again made admiral; in which capacity he escorted the Duke of Lancaster into Castile, was at the storming of Ribadavia, and other conflicts in Spain: particularly at the barriers of Noya in Galicia he signalized himself by fighting hand to hand with Barrois des Barres, one of the ablest captains of France. Having been afflicted with the distemper that proved fatal to so many of the soldiers, he came home with the army. He was,\n\n13 R. II. appointed vice-chamberlain of the royal household, and justice of South Wales; and successively obtained grants of two castles in the Principality.\n\nWe find him in 16 R. II. at the head of the embassy which brought about the peace with France, where he was much caressed and honoured by the French king: he was then steward of the household. He was retained to serve in the first campaign in Ireland, 18 R. II. The disputes between Richard and the Duke of Gloucester so disgusted him, that he prudently solicited permission to retire to his own estate, and obtained it with some reluctance on the part of the king.\n\nAt length, in 21 R. II. he was rewarded with the dignity of Earl of Worcester; though it is singular that the author of the narrative never mentions him by this title. He was also made captain of the town and castle and marches of Calais. His appointment to be admiral of Ireland is dated Jan. 16, 22 R. II. It was preparatory to this second Irish expedition, in which he was to take with him thirty-five men at arms, knights and esquires, and one hundred archers; to every twenty archers one carpenter and one mason.\n\nThe text sufficiently describes the part that he took at the close of the reign of Richard, and the beginning of that of his successor. His disaffection to his old master might arise from the banishment of the Earl of Northumberland and his son, at which he was much exasperated. When Henry ascended the throne, it was one of his first objects to conciliate and attach so valuable a servant. Accordingly he bestowed many high appointments upon him; made him ambassador to France, governor of Aquitaine, admiral of the fleet, lieutenant in North and South Wales; and retained him as governor to his eldest son. Polidore Vergil is quite at a loss to account for his defection from Bolingbroke, which, he says, no author of any credit has explained; and he ridiculously attributes it to envy. Carte affirms, that he detested Henry as the author of the murder of Richard, and as an usurper of the crown, to the prejudice of the right heir, Edmund Mortimer Earl of March. Whatever might be the real cause of the dispute between Henry IV. and the Percies, each party laid the blame upon the other. When the affair came to an open rupture, Sir Thomas joined his nephew Hotspur, was taken at the battle of Shrewsbury, and beheaded there, July, 1403. He died without issue. He was knight of the Garter, and his barony was that of Haverfordwest the possessed the castle of Emelin in South Wales, and the castle and commot of Huckirk in the county of Caernarvon; and had purchased the manor of Wresil in Yorkshire, where he built a castle. Had he survived the Earl and Countess of Northumberland, and Henry Percy, dying without heirs, he would have inherited a large proportion of the great estates of the Countess, his sister-in-law, the heiress of the Lucy family.\n\nMost contemporary writers have borne testimony to the talents and accomplishments of this nobleman; even our author touches his abandonment of Richard with a degree of tenderness. Walsingham alone, a strong partisan of Henry, lays to his charge the bloodshed of the fatal day of Shrewsbury. He informs us that the king was willing to have treated with his adversaries before the engagement; and that in a conference with Sir Thomas had even humbled himself to submit to unfavourable terms; but that the latter wilfully misrepresented his expressions when he returned to Hotspur, and hastened the fight. It does not however actually appear that when he drew the sword he at once threw away the scabbard; for that he was not averse to treat is plain from his accepting the dangerous office of a personal parley. But Henry survived to make a statement in favour of his own conduct, and Percy perished. His head and one of his quarters were set up on London Bridge; and the order addressed to the Mayor and Sheriffs is worded, perhaps in the usual official style, but certainly with apparent severity. The head is “ibidem quamdiu poterit moraturam,”\n\nThat he excelled in the qualities of the chivalrous character cannot be doubted his gravity and dignity as a statesman may be inferred from his being chosen procurator for the clergy upon a very solemn occasion during the parliament of 1397.28 Froissart, who became personally acquainted with him in 1395, commends his gracious and agreeable manners.\n\npage 16 note b The condition of Ireland at this juncture was truly deplorable. That island was the resort of outlaws, and exiles and adventurers of different nations; it was peopled by savage tribes and by settlers equally ferocious; and the affairs of it's government seemed to be in desperate and inextricable confusion. In original documents repeating the state of the country the inhabitants are described and arranged under three classes, “Wild Irish, rebellious Irish, and obedient English.” The “Wild Irish” or Irishry, were the unsubdued natives who had retired to the interior fastnesses, the mountains, bogs, and forests: they were governed by their own rude chiefs and laws, and looked upon by all the rest as their natural enemies. These were out of the protection of the English law, and it was often adjudged no felony to kill a mere Irishman in time of peace. “Our law,” says Sir John Davies, “did neither protect his life nor avenge his death.” The “rebellious Irish” were those who were also called English by blood; and were in part descended from the original conquerors, who had intermarried with the natives, and adopted their dress and manners, their language and their customs; possessing a tract of country between the natives and the sea, and subject to little controul. Their territory was called the English pale. The “obedient English” were a confused medley of soldiers, merchants, men of needy or desperate fortunes, and those whom the English government had invested with authority: they occupied the principal towns and cities and small tracts around them, chiefly in Leinster, and on the eastern and southern coasts. These were distinguished by the title of English by birth.\n\nSuch a population, in such an age, rendered Ireland, as the remonstrants at Kilkenny had forcibly expressed it, “a land full of wars.” Sometimes the septs were destroying each other; at other times they were making inroads upon the English pale, or joining with the great settlers in their mutual ravages. Richard II. in the beginning of his reign had addressed a rebuke to his liege subjects respecting their dissensions, which he followed up by sending Edmund Mortimer as his lieutenant into the country. His government, however, lasted only three years; and after his death things gradually fell into such disorder that the king found it necessary, in 1394, to interfere by his presence. His enemies submitted; but at his departure they scorned the weak forces that he had left behind him, and relapsed into their former anarchy. In 1397, Ormond and Obrien had wasted each other's lands; and the Earl of March, son of the above-mentioned Edmund, the king's lieutenant, who was co-operating with Ormond, was slain by the Obriens in the year ensuing. Thomas Holand, Duke of Surrey, was appointed to succeed him; he arrived in the island in 1398; but neither he nor his predecessor were of sufficient age and experience for so arduous a station. Of the native reguli, or canfinnies, who had affected to submit to Richard II. during his former visit, a great part were now in arms. Mac Morogh, the savage and powerful chieftain so often mentioned in this history, who was foremost in the rising, was united with the Earl of Desmond to waste the south: Obrien, whose territory lay nearer to Dublin, and Oneil in Ulster, were also in motion. They were to begin by attacking an adherent of the government. “Mac Morogh,” in the words of a despatch written about this time, “is now gone to Desmond to aid the Earl of Desmond to destroy the Earl of Ormond, if possible; and afterwards is to return with all the power he can get from the parts of Munster to destroy the country. Oneil has assembled a very great host of people to war and destroy the whole country. “The government was too weak to interpose in quelling these disturbers of the public peace, or even to protect it's own friends from the evils that were likely to ensue. Mal-administration and oppression prevailed. Sir Stephen Scroope, the deputy-lieutenant, had rendered himself odious to the English by blood and by birth, through his injustice and extortion. The disaffected Irishry pleaded unredressed wrongs, and pledges unfulfilled. Attempts had been made to bribe them into tranquillity; and they were again provoked to outrage by failure of payment. The finances were in a disordered state. Walsingham tells us, that the annual revenue in the reign of Edward the Third amounted to thirty thousand pounds; which is confirmed by Carew's extracts from the archives of the castle of Dublin; but this was wholly spent upon the public service, and proved at times far too little to meet the demands and allowances. At all events there was no residue for the king. An entry constantly occurs in the Pipe Rolls from the time of Henry the Third downwards, “in thesanro nihil,” “And the assertion of Fines Morysonia that “the country always supported its own government” is so far from being true, that Richard the Second had been obliged to contribute to it's assistance the yearly sum of thirty thousand marks. This was, however, before his first campaign. We have authentic evidence to prove that, about the time of which the text treats, the exchequer, exhausted by grants and annuities to the English and Irish, had been farther drained by the king himself of the money that should have been appropriated to the protection of the land; that there were no funds to pay the soldiers; that the army had consequently disbanded; and that the settlers in the Marches were neither able nor willing to afford any military aid.\n\nThese were the existing grievances and distractions of Ireland which called for remedy : the lieutenant and his council had made the most urgent representations upon this emergency; and the king, indignant at the death of Mortimer, had determined to correct the evils by his personal authority, as he had done five years before.\n\nSome curious inedited details upon this subject will be found in the APPENDIX, NO. I. See also Lingard, Hist. of England, vol. III. c. 20, and Campbell's Sketch in Gough's Camden, IV. p. 247.\n\npage 19 note d A name celebrated in the annals of Ireland, and variously spelt Mac Morgh and Mac Morogh. One of this race, a brutal and sanguinary character, Dermot Mac Morogh, son of Murchard, was the principal cause of the conquest in the reign of Henry the Second. The Mac Moroghs were the most considerable sept in Leinster, the chief of which styled himself king of that province. The individual here introduced was Arthur Mac Morogh, “chief captain of his nation, at whose might and power all Leinster trembled.” Henry Cristall, who furnished Froissart with an account of Richard's first expedition into Ireland, apparently represents him as having been concerned in an insurrection during the government of Lionel Duke of Clarence, which must have been forty years before; but as this will not accord with the accounts of his activity given hereafter, it may be considered that the historian has confounded him with his predecessor of that name. This is certain, that the Arthur Mac Morogh in question was in the war of 1394, and was one of the four kings who made submission to Richard in Dublin, and were knighted by him on the feast of our Lady in the same year, in the cathedral of that city. Cristall, who had been long resident as a prisoner among the Irishry, and was well acquainted with their manners and language, was selected to drill them into something like respectable appearance and behaviour at the court and at the ceremony. He accomplished the task with some difficulty, and his account of their habits and conduct is altogether curious. They entered into indentures, not only to continue loyal subjects, but that they and all their adherents should, by a day appointed, surrender to the king and his successors, all the lands and possessions which they held in Leinster; and, taking with them only their moveable goods, should serve him in his wars against his other rebels. In consideration of this, the king was to give them pay and pensions during their lives, and the inheritance of all such lands as they might recover from the rebels in any other part of the realm. Mac Morogh, in particular, was to have an annuity of eighty marks. Davies saw the enrolment of these indentures, and of the annuity, in the office of the king's remembrancer and the white book of the exchequer in Ireland. But Arthur and his wild companions seem to have submitted with an ill grace, and not long after the departure of Richard he again began to levy war. In this state of insubordination he continued under the lieutenancy of Roger Mortimer, and of his successor the Duke of Surrey; till at length he was brought to a parley of treaty. His barony of Norragh had been granted to the Duke of Surrey: he demanded restitution of it. His promised annuity had never been paid; and he insisted upon the whole arrears, adding that unless these terms were complied with, he would not keep the peace. The warden and council, alarmed at his threats, consented to pay him a certain sum of money for the barony and pension, until the king's pleasure could be ascertained; but he refused to enter into any composition, or to be pacified without speedy restitution of the barony. His language, according to their report, was, that “if his conditions are not complied with by Michaelmas, he is at open war.” In the mean time he began his incursions, as related in a former note. Richard appeared in Ireland; led in person his troops against him; set a price upon his head, and left him unsubdued. During the twenty ensuing years, he continued at intervals a thorn in the side of the government. Sir Stephen Scroope, deputy-lieutenant to Thomas Duke of Lancaster, son of Henry the Fourth, marched into his territory in 1417, and defeated the Irish after an obstinate encounter. But his final reduction took place on the 4th of May, 1419. On that day he was made prisoner, and is spoken of no more. Henry Marleburgh attributes this feat to John Talbot Earl of Furnivale; but Campion, out of James Young, asserts, that it occurred in the next year, under the great tamer of the septs, James Butler Earl of Ormond.\n\npage 23 note l Edward Plantagenet, eldest son of Edmund Duke of York, by Isabella of Castile, youngest daughter of Peter the cruel. He was cousin both to Richard II. and Henry IV. and was at this period about twenty-five years old.\n\nBy the female side he was descended of an unworthy line; and his conduct in early life did not tend to redeem the reputation of that branch of his family. Though he had been one of the chief favourites of Richard, he ill requited his attachment; for by evil counsels he paved the way to his downfall; and, if credit may be given to the scene in the Tower, hereafter to be quoted, he had the meanness to insult him in his captivity. In short his treachery rendered him at last odious to either party, and in the unfortunate monarch's own words, he was “unworthy of the appellation of duke, earl, or knight.” Even foreigners held him in contempt. The Count de Saint Pol, when he challenged Henry IV. exhibited his effigy one night before the gates of Calais, significantly represented, “ayant la teste en bas.” The Prince of Wales, afterwards Henry V. formed an attachment to him, and contrived to restore him to a certain degree of usefulness and respectability.\n\nHis titular honours had kept pace with those of Henry of Lancaster; and on the same days in which the latter had been created Earl of Derby and Duke of Hereford, Edward Plantagenet was made Earl of Rutland and Duke of Albemarle. He is the first Earl of Rutland upon record. To this title, which he was to retain only during his father's life, was annexed a grant of the castle, town, and lordship of Okeham and the sherivalty of the county. Other appointments rapidly followed. From the 17th to the 21st of Richard II. inclusive, he was made Admiral of the fleet to the northward, Commissioner of peace in France, Justice of the forests south of Trent, Constable of the Tower of London, Commissioner to treat of the marriage with Isabel, Governor of Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Wight with Carisbrook castle, Warden of the New-Forest, and all the forests south of Tent, Constable of Dover castle, and Warden of the Cinque-ports. To these succeeded the Dukedom of Albemarle above-mentioned, with a large portion of the estates of the Earls of Arundel and Warwick and the Duke of Gloucester, who had been attainted of treason. He had been one of the appellants of Gloucester, and was deeply implicated in the murder of that prince, his uncle, whose son, being by inheritance constable of England, was by the king deprived of this office in his favour; the title of Albemarle seems to have been part of his reward for the share he took in that iniquitous transaction: within five days ensuing his elevation to that dignity he was again made Constable of the Tower.\n\nAs in the instance of Sir Thomas Percy, his recent appellation does not appear to have been generally adopted; for it will be seen that our author rarely speaks of him but as Earl of Rutland, though he notices his advancement to the title of Albemarle. He must have been deprived of the latter by the time the metrical History was composed.\n\nRichard, according to his habitual weakness, was immoderately partial to him, and greatly influenced by his opinion; and Rutland seems to have been devoted to him in his turn, till the quarrel arose between the Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk, in which his own personal safety was called in question. Hereford affirmed that Norfolk had said, “that the king, notwithstanding his fair countenance and great oaths, did yet intend to oppress the duke of Lancaster, and the two Dukes of Albemarle and Exeter” A suspicion that this assertion was founded in truth might have alienated his mind from the king: his conduct from that time exhibited a coolness towards him. Having officiated as high constable in the lists at Coventry, he withdrew from court, though he was one of the council, and retired with his father to Langley. Bolingbroke had probably then begun to tamper with him.\n\nThe expedition into Ireland brought him from his retreat. The king had constituted him in this year, 22 Ric. II. General Warden of the West Marches toward Scotland, and joined him with others, in commission to treat of peace with the Scots. He was now retained by indenture to serve in Ireland, for one whole year, with one hundred and forty men at arms, Knights and esquires, and two hundred archers on horse-back; every twenty of the archers having one carpenter and one mason.\n\nSo high was the estimation in which Richard continued to hold him, that in the will which he made before his departure from England he nominated him one of his executors, distinguishing him by the expression “dilectum consanguineum nostrum.” He had been in the former Irish campaign; and Froissart? tells us, that he was in the present case “induced to join the king for two reasons; one in return for the great affection King Richard had shown him; the other because he was constable of England. It was therefore necessary he should attend his king.” What real sense he had of his obligations, and how far he discharged his office will be seen in the text. He might well be ashamed, as he was at the castle of Flint, to come into the presence of one whom he had so basely injured. Having been thus actively instrumental in the ruin of his benefactor, his known disposition renders it most probable that he designedly betrayed his friends, the Earls of Salisbury, Exeter, and Surrey. This was the opinion of Camden; “and it is confirmed by the narrative, in opposition to other accounts which make his discovery of their conspiracy against Henry IV. to have arisen from an accidental cause. But he not only betrayed them, but joined in the pursuit after them. “Who,” says Gaillard, from the MS. Ambassades, “but must have felt indignation at seeing this traitor carrying on the end of a lance the head of his brother-in-law and accomplice, Lord Spencer, and shamefully presenting it to Henry, whom he would have treated in the same manner, if the tournament at Oxford (it should be Windsor) had taken place?”\n\nPrevious to the insurrection, in the stormy debates that had arisen in the first parliament of Henry IV. he was accused of the murder of the Duke of Gloucester, and appealed of treason. Lord Fitzwalter, and twenty other nobles threw down their gages of quarrel upon the floor against him. But the proceedings were stayed, and the dispute passed over by the policy and forbearance of the new king. Yet Henry had not spared him for any favour that he bore towards him; he knew him too well to repose much confidence in him: he deprived him of his post of constable, and his title of duke, and reduced him to the rank of Earl of Rutland, H. IV. though he pardoned him for the share he had taken in the conspiracy against his life, and restored his estate. On the death of his father in 1402, he became Duke of York; in the same year he was made lieutenant of Aquitaine, as Dugdale thinks, owing to his obsequiousness; but, it was perhaps, with a view of removing him from England. His restless spirit prompted him in 1405 to attempt the rescue of the Earl of March from confinement in Windsor; the plot however failed, and he was arrested, and shut up in Pevensey castle till the next parliament. It was generally reported that he had died in prison; but the power of Henry IV. was too firmly established to render his existence matter of alarm, and in the next year he was released, and re-appointed Constable of the Tower. Besides, he found a firm friend in the Prince of Wales; the duke served in his company in the war against Owen Glendower, and was much indebted to his protection, under a charge of cowardice from which the prince strenuously vindicated him in the parliament or 1407. In 13 H. IV. he attended Thomas Duke of Clarence, when he went to the aid of the Duke of Burgundy; and in the year ensuing was in the war in France.\n\nHenry the Fifth extended his patronage towards him, and in the second year of his reign reversed the attainder that had been passed upon him, constituted him Justice of South-Wales, and Warden of the East marches towards Scotland; he also restored him to the post of high constable; in which capacity he was with the host that besieged and captured Harfleur. The only merit of his character, as Luders justly observes, was in military service; nor can we in any other sense, agree to his friend's eulogium of him, pronounced while he was pleading his cause, “that in all his actions he is a true and valiant knight.”\n\nAs he advanced in age a review of the past might excite in him some feeling of contrition, and this probably induced him, in 1412, to found the college of Fotheringay in Northamptonshire. A tendency towards it may be traced in his will which he made at the same time, wherein he directs, that in all masses and prayers directed to be offered up for him, mention should be made of Richard the Second, for whom he was in conscience obliged to pray?\n\nIf too many of his deeds exclude him from being classed with the honourable, the concluding act of his life, at least, ranks him indisputably among the brave. He died on the field at Azincourt, Oct. 25, 1415, and was buried in the church of the college he had founded. By his wife Philippa, daughter of John Lord Mohun, he left no issue.\n\nOn the day of that great battle he earnestly solicited the command of the vanguard; and, as he had grown very corpulent, is said to have been over-borne in the throng and pressure of the combatants, and to have been suffocated and trampled to death rather than slain with the sword. His suggestion of planting sharp stakes in front of the lines greatly contributed to the victory. The sight of his body, united to other circumstances, occasioned Henry V. to issue the disastrous order for the slaughter of the prisoners. Henry caused his funeral obsequies to be celebrated with great pomp after his triumphal entry into London.\n\npage 37 note h Thomas Despencer, son of Edward Lord Despenser, by Elizabeth daughter of Bartholomew de Burghersh, and great grandson of Hugh Despencer, executed in the reign of Edward II.\n\nHis father dying in 49 Edw. III. when he was two years old, his wardship was granted to Edmund Earl of Cambridge, uncle of Richard II. to the end that he should marry his daughter, a circumstance which afterwards took place. At the time of this expedition he could not be more than twenty-six years old; but he had served in Ireland in the first campaign against Macmorogh and the other chieftains; and had been one of the negociators of Richard's second marriage. Dugdale has erred, when he informs us, from Waisingham, that this nobleman, in 20 Ric. II. was arrested with others, at Nottingham, upon a charge of high treason. The passage of the historian, which he has mistaken, refers to the appoint appointment cf Despencer, with associates, to be appellants of the Duke of Gloucester and the Earls of Arundel and Warwick. After the death of the two former, and the banishment of the latter, Thomas Despencer was made Earl of Gloucester, and had a portion of the estates of the Earl of Warwick assigned to him. Being always in favour with the king, and connected with him by marriage with his cousin, he petitioned, in the parliament of 1398, for the revocation of the judgment that had been pronounced against his great grandfather, and obtained it.\n\nWhen Richard's army was broken up at Milford, no mention is made of his having gone over to the Duke of Lancaster; but he sat in the first parliament of Henry IV. excused himself as to the share he had taken in the death of Gloucester, upon the plea of compulsion, and became one of the commissioners for the deposition of the king. Yet he experienced no favour at the hand of Henry; for he was reduced to the rank of Lord Despencer, stripped of his newly acquired castles, lordships, and lands, and sentenced to hold all his hereditary possessions at the king's mercy: he was to give no liveries or cognisances, nor to have any retainers except domestics; and, if ever he should attempt to assist the deposed king, he was to be prosecuted as a traitor. This attempt, however, he made in conjunction with the conspirators in 1 Hen. IV. During the confusion of the affair at Cirencester he escaped from the inn, in which he was lodged, over the roofs of some houses, and fled for refuge to his strong castle at Cardiff. But even this afforded him no security. He had, indeed, eluded a party despatched by the king to apprehend him; and had embarked on board a vessel in the hope of escaping with his servants and treasure. But a severer fate awaited him; and the circumstances of his arrest were peculiarly tantalising. Having gained the Bristol Channel in fancied security, the captain inquired to what port he wished to proceed: and when he told him he intended to go beyond sea, refused to carry him any where but to Bristol. Despencer threatened the mariner with death; and in the course of their altercation, twenty armed men, concealed in the hold, rushed upon deck and over-powered him and his attendants. He was then taken into Bristol, and delivered into the custody of the Mayor of that city. Henry wished to have had an interview with him before he was put to death; but, on the second day after his arrival, a multitude assembled, and called aloud for the traitor to the king and realm, that he might be brought out to execution. The Mayor in vain endeavoured to oppose them; they dragged their victim forth, and beheaded him in the market place. His head was set upon London Bridge; his body was buried in the midst of the choir at Tewksbury, under a lamp that burned before the host.\n\nIn Rymer's Additional MSS. is an order to give to William Flaxman the cloak of motley velvet and furred damask, which Thomas Lord le Despencer wore when he was brought to Bristol.\n\nFroissart calls him one of the most powerful barons in England. He was Lord of Glamorgan and Morganok; and his influence in South Wales must have rendered him dangerous. In the proclamation against the insurgents he is simply styled Thomas Despencer, Chivaler; a term which shews the feeling of indignation or contempt entertained by the government towards him, reducing his rank as low as possible. Knighthood itself was indelible, except by a formal act of degradation.\n\nHe left one son and two daughters by his wife Constance, daughter of Edmund Duke of York. She survived her husband nine years.\n\npage 41 note m Roger Mortimer, fourth Earl of March, and second Earl of Ulster, in Ireland, was the eldest son of Edmund Earl of March, by Philippa, daughter of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III. An historian attached to the family has furnished us with some minute particulars concerning him. He was born at Usk, April 11, 1374, and baptised on the following Sunday by William Courtney, Bishop of Hereford; his sponsors being Roger Cradock, Bishop of Llandaff, Thomas Horton, Abbot of Gloucester, and the Prioress of Usk. His father dying at Cork, during his government of Ireland, in 1382, left him a minor under the legal guardianship of Richard II. The minions of the court immediately applied to be admitted into the profits of his estates during his minority; and the king too readily consented to their request, and angrily dismissed his honest chancellor, Sir Richard Scroope, who had opposed them. The trust was afterwards for a pecuniary consideration vested in more responsible persons; and those into whose hands it fell do not appear to have abused it. When Roger Mortimer came of age he found that his rights had been duly respected according to the provisions of the great charter of the land: his castles and mansions were in good repair: his manors and farms were well stocked with cattle, and all the requisites of husbandry; and he had twenty thousand marks in his treasury. Such was his hereditary rank and consequence, that in case Richard should die without issue, he was nearest to the throne; and in provision for an occurrence of that nature the parliament of 1385 nominated him heir presumptive to the crown. Six months after his father's decease, 5 Ric. II. he was appointed lieutenant of Ireland. He had been originally betrothed to the daughter of the Earl of Arundel; but the king, at the interposition of his own mother, the princess Joan, set aside the match in favour of her grand-daughter Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Holand, Earl of Kent. The character of Roger Mortimer, as given by the aforesaid historian, forms an ample comment upon the epithet 'courtois” applied to him by the poet. “He was distinguished for the qualities held in estimation at that time, a stout tourneyer, a famous speaker, a costly feaster, a bounteous giver, in conversation affable and jocose, in beauty and form surpassing his fellows.” His splendid mode of living, had been probably modelled from his own example. In 17 Ric. II. Mortimer, then in his twentieth year, accompanied the first expedition into Ireland, having in his retinue an hundred men at arms, of which two were bannerets, and eight knights, two hundred archers on horseback, and four hundred archers on foot. Richard hastily returning to England, left the inexperienced youth to govern that turbulent island. He had, however, competent advisers under him, if he would have listened to their counsels. In 19 Ric. II. he had an especial commission and lieutenancy for the provinces of Ulster, Connaught, and Meath; and in 20 Ric. II. he was instituted once more lieutenant of that whole realm. He was summoned to attend the parliament at Shrewsbury, at which he appeared at the head of a crowd of retainers, clad chiefly at his own expence in white and crimson, with great pomp and pageantry. He had a cause at that time pending with the Earl of Salisbury, respecting the right to the town and castle of Denbigh; and when he had succeeded in his suit, he returned to his government. It was a post of as much trouble as dignity, and demanded a steadier hand. For, adds the same chronicler, “Roger, warlike and renowned as he was, and fortunate in his undertakings and fair, was yet most dissolute, and remiss in matters of religion.” Like his master, he neglected the prudential representations of older persons; and his rash and resolute spirit brought him to an untimely end. In a conflict at Kinles with the sept of Obrien, his ungovernable impetuosity hurried him foremost upon the enemy; and as he had advanced beyond the succour of his own soldiers, and was disguised in the habit and accoutrements of an Irish horseman, he was slain and torn in pieces by the savage natives. This happened upon the festival of Saint Margaret the virgin in the year 1398. By his wife Eleanor he left four children, and his posterity on the female side involved England in civil discord. His bones repose beneath the site of the Abbey of Wigmore in Herefordshire, the foundation and favourite burial-place of his fathers.\n\nBy his wife Eleanor he left four children, and his posterity on the female side involved England in civil discord.

At the period of King Richard's deposition he was only forty-six years old, He obtained the archdeaconry of Taunton when he was very young; and it provokes a smile from the gravity of Godwin, that in 1374 he was made Bishop of Ely, while yet a sub-deacon, and at the age of twenty-two. His father died in 1375, and left him a portion of 2000 marks. He continued at Ely till 1388, when he was advanced to the see of York. During the king's dispute with the Londoners in 1393, when he was chancellor, he removed the courts for six months from London to York, to the great advantage of that city, and the proportionate distress of the capital. From York, in 1396, he was elevated to the see of Canterbury; and it is especially noted, that this was the first instance of such a translation. In the same year the pope made him his legate and executor of the faculty for dispensing with the king's marriage. Richard had long looked upon him with a suspicious eye, from Ills attachment to the party of the Duke of Gloucester. Soon after he appears as a principal actor in the plot then said to have been framed against the king. On July 8, 1397, he is said to have attended at a meeting held by the conspirators in the castle of Arundel, his brother's residence; where he performed mass, and administered the sacrament to the Duke of Gloucester, the Earl of Arundel, and others. It was agreed by common consent to seize the king, and keep him in perpetual imprisonment; the Dukes of Lancaster and York were to be treated in like manner, and death was denounced against the rest of the king's council. If this may be depended upon, we cannot be surprised that he should have been impeached of high treason; or that, while some of his associates suffered death, he should have been sent into banishment. But the chief article in the public charge brought against him places his offence much earlier; “That being Bishop of Ely, and chancellor, he was traiterously aiding, procuring, and advising, in making a commission directed to Thomas Earl of Gloucester, Richard Earl of Arundel, and others, in the tenth year of the king's reign, and procuring himself, as one of the chief ministers of state, to be put into the said commission, which commission was apparently prejudicial to the king's prerogative and dignity; and that the said Thomas put the said commission in execution.” The whole of this affair is involved in much obscurity, through which, however, the king appears to great disadvantage. On the first day of his impeachment, September 20,139”, Arundel was present in parliament, and offered to make his defence; but the king, under promise of his friendship, and an assurance that nothing should be done to his prejudice, commanded him not to make his appearance on the next day, and in his absence sentence was pronounced against him. He was allowed six weeks to prepare for quitting the kingdom under pain of death. One of the articles of accusation against Richard, which, on the other hand, must be received with some degree of caution, as savouring strongly of Arundel's own manufacture, exhibits the king as behaving towards him with shameless duplicity. Before his departure, the archbishop told the Duke of Norfolk, that he would share the same fate, and surprised the king by a warning, to which he in part reluctantly assented, that the consequences would fall upon his own head at last.\n\nThus driven into exile, Arundel went first to Frame, and afterwards to Rome, where he was well received by Boniface IX, who interested himself much in his favour, and wrote to the king to obtain his restitution to the archbishopric. Not succeeding in this, he intended to have made him Archbishop of St. Andrews, and to have given him several preferments in England by way of provision. Richard, aware of his designs, despatched a letter to the pope, couched in haughty and offensive terms. He expressed great surprise that he should countenance his treason, take him under his protection, and lead him to expect he would be restored. The language of part of his remonstrance runs thus: “We are resolved never to endure such usage, though the whole world were of a different opinion. We desire your holiness would not shock our interest and inclination by such favours. If you have a mind to provide for him otherwise, we have nothing to object; only we cannot allow him to dip in our dish. We heartily desire you would take this matter into serious consideration, as you tender our royal regards, and expect a compliance with any future request your holiness may make us.”\n\nThe time had been, when expressions like these might have raised the greater part of Europe in arms against the offender: but the papal authority was itself divided by contending parties. Two popes aspired to the chair of Saint Peter; and Boniface IX. who had established himself at Rome, and whose cause had been espoused by England, was desirous of gaining a point in the repeal of the statutes of provisors and præmunire, which limited his power in this country. Richard was well aware of this, and it is what he alludes to in his letter. The pope therefore withdrew his protection from Arundel, and at the king's request made Roger Walden, who was Dean of York and Treasurer of England, Archbishop of Canterbury: but neither this concession, nor the granting of a bull confirming all the proceedings of the late parliament of Shrewsbury, nor the legate which he sent over in the year 1398, could obtain a repeal of the offensive statutes.\n\nIn the mean time Arundel availed himself of the first opportunity to return. This, among a variety of circumstances, proves that Henry had an eye to extremities, when he took for his companion and counsellor one who was so odious to the king. The interview that passed between the ex-prelate and the duke at Paris, preparatory to their setting out, is given minutely by Froissart; but it is, perhaps, rather what might be considered likely to have occurred between the parties on such an occasion, than the conversation which actually took place. That writer was but ill-informed in many parts of this whole affair. He makes Arundel quit England with great secrecy, at the instigation of the citizens of London, to confer with the Duke; but there is no good reason to conclude that he had ever previously returned from banishment. The text fills up the interval between the landing and coronation of Henry IV. in which, having been restored to his see, he took an active part. He was afterwards very useful to Henry during the rest of his reign, and lived to see his successor upon the throne. He died at the rectory of Hakyngton, on Monday, February 19, 1413-14.\n\nDuring the reigns of Richard II. and Henry IV. he was four times chancellor of the realm. In 1401 he visited and reformed the University of Cambridge; and in 1411 made an attempt of the same kind at Oxford, which was more than suspected of Lollardism; but in this he failed.\n\nHis character has been variously estimated according to the political and religious sentiments of subsequent writers: his catholic contemporaries are loud in his praise. Of his concern in the deposition of Richard II. every reader will judge for himself. The epithet fier, in the original, is not misapplied to him. He was a man of strong personal courage, fitted for bold and dangerous enterprise; but appears to have wanted those milder qualities that appertain to a Christian bishop. He was a great favourite with the pope and the ecclesiastics of his time; for he resolutely combated the innovations that were then on foot against the established religion. Richard‘s, and even Henry's encroachments upon the rights of the church, and Wycliff's endeavours at reform, were objects of his strenuous resistance. He anathematised, and dealt harshly with the followers of the latter. The Lollards might be injudicious in some of their measures, and, according to his notions, might give great provocation; but he let loose the spirit of persecution upon them. Sawtry and Badby, the first protestant martyrs of which we have any distinct account, suffered at the stake in his time. One of his actions may not be omitted. He had the good sense and generosity to intercede with Henry IV. in behalf of Walden, who had supplanted him at Canterbury, and obtained his promotion to the bishoprick of London. His devotion, learning, ability, and official diligence, are extolled by a monkish historian. He insisted upon payment of oblations to the clergy, long neglected in his diocese and province, especially in London; reformed his proctors; obliged the incumbents to residence; and enforced the repairs of churches and parsonage houses. Many writers bear testimony to his liberality and munificence. He was a benefactor to every see with which he was concerned. While he was at Ely, he almost rebuilt the episcopal palace in Holborn; and presented to the church, among other gifts, a curious tablet of great value, full of the reliques of the saints set in large pearls, rubies, and sapphires. Arundel had purchased it of Edward the black prince; it had once belonged to the King of Spain. He improved the manors of the see of York, and gave to the cathedral various articles of ornament and massy plate. To Canterbury he bequeathed many sumptuous habiliments and jewels, with several valuable books; and gave the peal of bells, known by the appellation of “the Arundel Ring.”\n\nAfter his return, he obtained a grant of Leeds Castle in Kent; where he frequently resided, and held his court.\n\nDrake ventures a groundless conjecture, from some circumstances in his arms, that he was a bastard of the family of Arundel; and the historian of Ely gives a very confused account of him. In one place he informs us that he was the second son of Richard Earl of Arundel; and in another, that his mother was Alice, daughter of William, and sister and heir of John Earl of Warren: whereas this Alice was the grandmother of Archbishop Arundel.\n\npage 56 note c John de Montacute eldest son of Sir John de Montacute and Margaret de Monthermer his wife. He was nephew and heir also of William Earl of Salisbury; and had recently inherited his title and estates. He had borne arms in France in the time of the Black Prince, and in 13C9was knighted by the Earl of Cambridge in the field, at the attack of Bourdeilles, where he behaved with great bravery. He was also at Belleperche, in Bourbonnois, with the Earls of Pembroke and Cambridge, when they carried off the mother of the Duke of Bourbon; and, in the same campaign, he had a narrow escape in the company of the former at the village of Puirenon in Poictou. In 15 Ric. II. he travelled into Prussia with a retinue of ten servants, and with ten horses; and in 18 Ric. II. was in the first expedition into Ireland. He had been one of the appellants of the Duke of Gloucester and the other nobles, who were attainted of treason; and part of the confiscated estates of the Earl of Warwick fell to his share. ‘This affair rendered him odious to the people.’ In 1398 he was constituted marshal of England in in the absence of the Duke of Surrey in Ireland; in the same year he was made one of the commissioners to treat of peace with the Scots; and he had also licence previously to go into France. Richard sent him to Paris about Christmas, to interfere in obstructing the rumoured marriage of the Duke of Hereford with Mary of Berry. It is to his credit, that he accepted the office with reluctance; but his execution of it drew upon him the duke's indignation.\n\nHowever, after the deposition of the king, he remained unmolested, and even protected by the ruling power. To the charges brought against him in parliament, for his conduct in the late reign, he was admitted with others to urge the plea of compulsion; and when Lord Morley challenged him as a traitor, for the part he had taken in the affair of the Duke of Gloucester, he replied, by giving him the lie, and throwing down his gloves: but here, as in the case of Albemarle, the matter ended. Camden brands him with the appellation of “time-server,” perhaps, because he assisted in the ceremonies which placed Henry upon the throne, and did homage to him: he was not more inconsistent in this respect than others who attended upon that occasion, and they had then no choice of resistance. But neither the names of the Earls of Salisbury nor Huntingdon are found among those who consented to the imprisonment of Richard the Second; and that his heart was with Henry can never be imagined: he waited, with the rest of the disaffected, for an opportunity of restoring his former master. They created one with hasty zeal, as will be seen in the course of the narrative. He conspired with them to seize Henry at Windsor, and put him to death, was taken prisoner at Cirencester, and beheaded by the townsmen, January 5, 1400. His body was buried in the abbey at Cirencester, and remained there till 8 Hen. V. when, at the petition of his widow, it was removed to the Priory of Bustlesham, in Berkshire, which his ancestors had founded.\n\nHe was summoned to parliament among the barons of the realm, from 16 to 20 Ric. II. when he became Earl of Salisbury. His character and accomplishments will be noted in another place.\n\nBy his wife, Maude, daughter of Sir Adam Francis, knight, who, before their marriage, had been twice a widow, he left five children. The family were reduced to poverty by his attainder; but were relieved from it by the generosity of Henry the Fourth. His eldest son, Thomas, was that renowned Earl of Salisbury, who was slain in the wars of France at the siege of Orleans.\n\nThere is an error in Dugdale respecting the age of this nobleman. At the death of his father, in 13 Ric. II. he is said to have been thirty-nine years old, and at the decease of the earl, his uncle, in 20 Ric. II. only forty. And again, in one place he is cousin, and in another nephew, of William Earl of Salisbury.\n\npage 61 note h The seizure of castles was of course a great object with him, as he soon had no enemy to encounter in the field.\n\nThe Duke of Lancaster's first measures upon his landing are not very accurately recorded by historians; nor do the accounts impress us with an opinion that they had arisen out of any digested plan of operation. But a comparison of the desultory information which is furnished relative to them, with what may fairly be supposed to have been most advisable on his part, will, perhaps, shew that they were really the result of good calculation, well applied to existing circumstances and incidental occurrences. It may also help to confirm the sentiment expressed in the text as to the treacherous conduct of the Duke of Albemarle during the king's engagements in Ireland, respecting which some authors have hesitated.\n\nThe following is accordingly offered as the outline of the scheme, so far as may be inferred from the known situation of all the parties.\n\nRichard, odious to his own subjects, had quitted England, and left it in confusion. Henry, aware of his own popularity, found, by secret intelligence, that all things were ripe for his project. To secure a chance of success, it was in the first instance necessary not only that the most powerful nobles remaining at home should join him; but that means should be devised to hinder the king from returning till time had been gained. In the influence and authority of the Percys, who had refused to accompany Richard in his expedition, and in the artful management of Albemarle, who was to have joined the king some time before he even quitted England, he found a strong advantage. Henry's emissaries had been through the country. London is said to have invited him.\n\nIt would, however, be expedient that he should try the disposition of the people upon the eastern coast before he should land, and most important to him that he should select a spot for his descent, from which he could put himself into immediate communication with his friends. Yorkshire afforded the greatest facility. There he had large possessions and castles, and the injustice of the king in depriving him of these must be fresh in the minds of men.\n\nThese might so far be his calculations; and he thus connectedly and without any confusion pursued his objects. The wind that took Albemarle over into Ireland must have been favourable to him; the tempestuous weather that succeeded was equally in his favour. He hovered for some days about the coast till he had ascertained that his presence would be generally welcome. He landed at Ravenspur, and marched to Doncaster, where the Percys and others came down to him. Knaresborough and Pontefract, strong fortifications, his rightful inheritance, must have fallen to him; and it will be farther seen that he made a point as much as possible of marching upon all places of this description as he moved along.\n\nWe may continue to compare his operations with reference to expediency. Having gained a footing, and tried the affection of the people, it would be necessary that he should immediately press towards the south. Whether he should first go to the capital, of the attachment of which he was assured, must depend upon the nature of events: the government was weak: it would be his object instantly to disperse and secure the members of which it was composed, wherever he could find them.\n\nHe marched southward, accordingly, without delay. His rapidity astonished the country; his proclamations excited universal approbation; and his opponents withdrew before him. The council, consisting of the regent, Scroop, Bussy, Green, and Bagot, those who attempted to gather a force, and among them the military bishop of Norwich, could interpose no obstacle to his proceedings. The Duke of York, who appears to have been gained over, made a faint shew of official interference; but fear drove most of the others into Bristol. They probably thought to have gone to Milford, and thence to Ireland, or at least to have secured that important position, anticipating the king's return. They could not have taken a more favourable direction for Henry; it led him towards his territories and holds. Thus he advanced upon Leicester, where the castle was his own: Kenilworth, his own also by inheritance, was upon the road to Evesham: from this place he quickly got upon the line of the Severn, and followed it to Gloucester and Berkeley. There he came into amicable contact with the duke of York; secured many of Richard's adherents; passed on to Bristol; took the castle, slew three out of four of the unfortunate ministers, and gained possession of a place entirely disaffected to the king.\n\nThus occupying the keys of the Severn, Gloucester, and Bristol, and commanding the passages into South Wales, it would not be necessary for him to entangle his army in the principality, where Richard was still beloved. It would only be useful for him to secure his best castles in that quarter, and to raise his tenants, which he could easily accomplish by skirting the southern part of Herefordshire. His course thence would lie directly northward up the borders, through the chief towns upon the marches. All this time, it would be Albemarle's business, if possible, to detain Richard till Henry had gained upon that line, and made an impression upon the whole of the neighbouring country. In any case he should endeavour to draw him down to Milford. The king must be hindered from passing over into North Wales; or shewing himself in Cheshire, where he had more adherents than in any other quarter. But if Richard should land while Henry was in the south, provided his army had been properly practised upon, it would afford them a temptation and an opportunity to desert while the duke was moving up the border, who should use his utmost diligence to get first to Chester. Thither the king, if he had tried to outmarch him, could not advance with the same rapidity, were he to move upon a parallel line, on account of the difficulties of the country; and, if he should attempt to pursue him, must have so much more ground to traverse. Arrived at Chester, Henry would occupy the key of North Wales, the point from which it had ever been most assailable since the days of Edward I. and from which, if any thing adverse had happened to him, he might have retired upon his supporters in Lancashire and Northumberland, as the exigency might have required.\n\nIt seems, from the issue, that all this, at least, must have occurred to him: for that the greater part of his proceedings were directed merely by fortuitous coincidences is still more difficult to be imagined. His conduct justifies the hypothesis that he did not set about his enterprise without the best consideration; and, admitting this to have been the case, it may be allowed that hardly any thing could have been more judicious than his arrangements. From Bristol he directed his march back to Gloucester, thence bearing westward to Ross and Hereford, as it were with a view of securing those castles appertaining to the duchy of Lancaster, which were upon that southern border. He might have taken a nearer direction to Chester, but his purpose in bending to the left is evident. From Hereford he had derived one of his titles, and there his family were respected. He then continued to pass upward through Leominster and Ludlow, encreasing his train by the maintainers of Herefordshire and Shropshire, as he moved onward to Shrewsbury and Chester. No greater proof need be given of his anxiety to secure Chester than his despising Holt, a strong fortress, garrisoned for the king, which was hardly out of his road. After the surrender of Chester, he turned back to invest it, and it became an easy prey.\n\nIn the mean time the plans of his colleague, Albemarle, were equally successful. By his artifice the king was prevented going from Dublin to Chester, where he might have anticipated Henry, and infused a spirit into his loyal subjects which might have caused some difficulty to the latter: he also thwarted every thing that might have turned to his advantage; brought him southward to Milford, while the duke was going northward; and so corrupted and dispersed his army, that upon their landing they hurried over Wales to join his enemy. By about the time that Richard came on shore, Henry must have been at Chester, surrounded by his friends, at the head of an immense force, master, at least, of London, Bristol, and Chester, and of all the fortresses that had been his own, or had belonged to Richard, on two sides of a triangle, the apex of which is to be found at Bristol, the base extending from the mouth of the Humber to that of the Dee. Some have asserted that all the castles from Berwick to Bristol were in the hands of himself or his party; and, considering the power of the earls of Northumberland and Westmorland in the north, it may readily be believed.\n\nUp to this point the measures of Albemarle and the movements of the Duke of Lancaster seem perfectly to correspond with each other. The course pursued by the latter reflects a light upon the intrigues of the former. Nothing appears to have been neglected that could be turned to account; and there is a decision and connexion about the whole campaign which gives it the air of deep contrivance.\n\npage 67 note l The duke had been active in exciting the people by circular letters throughout the country. The MS. Ambassades has preserved the substance of that which was addressed to the city of London: one hundred and fifty of the same kind were sent to different places.\n\n“Those which came to the commons of the city of London, said that King Richard had done every thing secretly; that he had drawn over and bound to agreement with him many great lords, as well of France, Germany, and Brittany, as of divers other kingdoms; and that by the aid of his allies he would lord it and domineer more greatly and mightily over the kingdom of England than any of his predecessors, the kings of England, had ever done; and that he would keep the villains of England in greater subjection, and greater servitude, than any Christian king had ever exercised towards his subjects. Their other contents were, that he would first cause to be apprehended all the chief magistrates feschevins) of the good cities who, ever since his coronation, had maintained the opinions of the commons in opposition to him and his council, and put them to death by divers torments; and he had purposed, that, as soon as he should be come from Ireland, he would secretly bid his allies to a certain festival which he was to make, which was to last a month; and would bring thither all the great burgesses, chief magistrates, and merchants of all the good cities of England; and afterwards, when they were all come, would cause them to be apprehended by his people and allies, and would then lay on such subsidies, tallages, and imposts as he should please. “And then the duke said in his letters,” Wherefore, my friends and good people, when the aforesaid matters came to my knowledge, I came over, as soon as I could, to inform, succour, and comfort you, to the utmost of my power; for I am one of the nearest to the crown of England, and am beholden to love and support the realm of England as much or more than any man alive; for thus have my predecessors done. My friends, may God preserve you: be well advised, and think well of that which I write to you, Your good and loyal friend, Henry of Lancaster.”\n\n“These letters were read to the people by the chief magistrates of the towns, and produced a great outcry against Richard: none durst speak in his favour; his servants and officers were Killed, whever they could be found; and the people exclaimed, “Let Richard be deposed and Henry declared our lord and governor.”\n\n“Soon after, the duke sent letters to the nobility, accusing Richard of a design to deliver over to the French king all the possessions of the English in France, for a sura of money to be paid by instalment in ten years; which was the more readily believed, because he had already given back Brest and Cherbourgh. The effect of these letters was such, that every gentleman of England went and offered his services to the duke; and in less than six days, he had so large an army both of nobles and non-nobles, that he was obliged to dismiss the greater part for want of means to subsist them; and for certain it was in consequence of the effects produced by these letters that he was so well received in England, and emboldened to advance to London.”\n\nCarte has placed the dissemination of these imputations after the capture of the king; but, according to the above relation, this is an unwarranted transposition. The desertion of Richard at Milford-haven by the principal lords who had returned with him from Ireland, is elsewhere attributed to the letters which they had received, informing them of the causes for which the duke of Lancaster was come into England. Before the army dispersed, the Earl of Rutland had received letters from Lancaster, and had been seen reading them by one of his squires.\n\npage 72 note q Ballad-making was much in fashion. The squire of Chaucer, in the passage already cited, page 7, possessed this qualification. The French took the lead in composition of this kind. About the year 1380, according to Warton, a new species of poetry succeeded to the Provencal in France. It consisted of Chants royaux, Balades, Rondeaux, and Pastorales. But the passion for writing songs among the princes and gentlemen of that country may be traced much higher.' Winceslaus of Bohemia, Duke of Luxembourg and Brabant, uncle of Richard's first queen, was a great composer of songs, ballads, roundelays, and virelays. Froissart made a collection of these at the request of the duke, in the volume entitled Meliador, which he presented to Richard II. and that historian has left us several specimens of similar efforts of his own muse. Among the contemporary writers of our own nation, the French ballads of Gower are remarkable for their ease and elegance.\n\nOf the poems of the Earl of Salisbury, probably composed in the French language, a favourable opinion may be formed from the commendations bestowed upon him by Christina of Pisa, who calls him, “Gracieux chevalier, aimant dictiez, et ltd meme gracieux dieteur.” She herself, whose various works both in prose and verse form so conspicuous a portion of the literature of this period, was little inferior to any of the poets of the age; and her judgment might be depended upon, even though it should be suspected to be biassed by the debt of gratitude which she owed to her admirer and friend. She was a foreigner by birth, but the widow of a Frenchman, patronised at the court of France for her literary talent; and a part of her story is closely connected with the Earl of Salisbury and Henry IV. When Salisbury went over to France either upon the marriage of Richard, or to thwart the match of the duke of Lancaster, he became acquainted with Christina, whose works had attracted his attention; and he conceived such a friendship for her, that seeing she had a son whom she wished to place out, he offered to take him and educate him with his own. Christina consented; and her son, then thirteen years of age, accompanied him into England in 1398.\n\nAt the death of this nobleman, Henry, who had read the compositions of Christina, which were, in Salisbury's possession, and must have seen or heard of her at Paris, was very desirous to entice her to his court: he took her son under his protection; and sent two kings at arms, Lancaster and Falcon, to invite her over with promise of an ample maintenance. But, as she had been disgusted at his conduct towards Richard, she declined his offers with many thanks, excuses, and delays, till she could obtain her son again. She confesses that she made this sacrifice of a liberal establishment for, herself and her child to her principles and feelings; (perhaps also it was made to her apprehensions;) that he returned upon an understanding that she was to go back with him, which, however, she did not; and that his restitution cost her some of her books. (“Be mes livres me couta.”) She afterwards placed him in the service of the Duke of Orleans, and thus expresses herself in a ballad addressed to that prince, recommending the youth to his protection.\n\nJa. iij. ans que, pour sa grat promesse,\n\nL'en enmena le conte tres louable\n\nDe Salsbery, qui mouru a destresse,\n\nOu mal pays d'Angleterre; ou muable\n\nY sont la gent.

But I am not aware that he is mentioned in any other passage of that part of her works, except in the above quotation. It will be observed how lightly she there touches upon the death of the earl, the behaviour of the English, and the claims of the reigning monarch. And it is a remarkable circumstance, that there are several blanks left among the ballads by the transcriber. This might at first sight seem to favour the conjecture, that these spaces might in other copies be filled up with compositions containing allusions objectionable to Henry, and that this might be one of the very books which she sent to procure the restoration of her son. It appears, however, from internal evidence of some of the pieces, that the volume was not written till after 1404; before which time, according to her own account, he must have returned. It's costly decorations indicate it to have been prepared for some person of rank; and, if part of the suspicion be founded in fact, it might be originally destined for an Englishman.—It belonged in 1676 to Henry Duke of Newcastle.\n\nThere is reason to believe that Salisbury possessed an active and cultivated mind, with a taste for literature and the arts. The reader will hereafter see that it is to his suggestion that he owes this interesting story of Richard's fall. He seems to have been the earl of that title alluded to in the romance History of Partenay, composed about this time; in which the writer, speaking of the sources from which his materials are derived, says\n\nForment celle historie avery\n\nLe conte de Salsebery,\n\nDun livre quavoit.\n\nEither by inheritance or purchase he had tapestry in his possession, which, upon his forfeiture, was thought a present worthy of a king's son.\n\nIt is indeed probable, that the earl, his uncle, had been a collector of books; but all his stores did not descend to his heir. Among the royal MSS. in the British Museum is Comestor's Scholastic History, in French, which, as it is recorded in a blank page at the beginning, was taken from the king of France at the battle of Poitiers, and, being purchased by William Montagu, Earl of Salisbury, for 100 marcs, was ordered to be sold by the last will of his countess Elizabeth for 40 livres.\n\nBishop Percy and Strutt perused the passage, to which this note is appended, so inattentively as to ascribe the above poetical accomplishment to the king.\n\npage 78 note x John de Holand, third son of Thomas, Earl of Kent, by Joan, daughter of Edmund of Woodstock. His mother, one of the most beautiful women of the age, was afterwards the wife of the Black Prince; and hence John de Holand was uterine brother to Richard the second. He was also brother-in-law to Henry, Duke of Lancaster, having married his sister Elizabeth.\n\nHe had been long exercised in arms; and had served in Scotland, 99 Edw. III. 7 and 8 Ric. II.; in Spain, 9 and 11 Ric. II.; and in France, 9, 11 and 13 Ric. II. His lady accompanied him in the Castilian campaign, where he was constable to the duke of Lancaster, his father-in-law, and high in his confidence. He executed the task of bringing off the remnant of the army enfeebled by pestilence.\n\nHe had espoused by proxy the king's first wife, Anne of Bohemia, and attended her into England; he assisted also at his second marriage. He had held the office of Justice of Chester, 4 Ric. II.; had been negociator of peace with France and Flanders, 7 and 15 Ric. II; admiral of the fleet from the mouth of the Thames westward, 13 Ric. II.; twice lord chamberlain of England, 13 and 17 Ric. II.; governor of the castle and town of Carlisle, 19 Ric. II.; and warden of the west march towards Scotland, 21 Ric. II. His advancement to the title of Earl of Huntingdon bears date, 2 June, 11 Ric. II. and to that of Duke of Exeter, 29 September, 21 Ric. II.\n\nThe enterprise and valour of John de Holand have been much celebrated. He himself confessed to the Duke of Lancaster, “I love nothing better than fighting.” He excelled in jousting, and was insatiably fond of it. Upon a formal challenge he tilted with. sir Reginald de Roye, before the court of Portugal at Entença; won the stranger's prize at Oporto; ran six lances at the grand match on the plain of Saint Inglevere, near Calais, and would have entered the lists again, but was not allowed; he also carried off the tenants prize at the famous tournament in Smithfield in 1390. The king granted special licence for himself and his retinue, knights and squires, to exercise points of arms, if they should be required, during his stay at Berwick upon Tweed and in the marches, in 1392.\n\nBut his intrepidity more than bordered upon ferocity. In bravery he might be a good knight; but he had certainly been a bad man. Twice within two years he had committed murder. During the parliament held at Shrewsbury in 1384, an Irish Carmelite presented to the king a schedule containing allegations of treason against the Duke of Lancaster, which he pledged himself to substantiate upon a day appointed. The duke denied the charges, and offered to prove his innocence; but demanded that the Friar should in the mean time be placed under the custody of Sir John Holand. At midnight preceding the day of enquiry, Holand and a knight, named Sir Henry Green, with their own hands put the accuser to death in the most barbarous manner; and to remove suspicion, caused his body to be dragged in the morning through the streets on a hurdle, like that of a traitor. Richard's youthful incapacity and the licentiousness of his nobles were never more conspicuous than upon this occasion; and it is not the least extraordinary particular in the affair, that no notice was taken of so gross an outrage. Walsingham drily remarks upon it. “Mirandum quod non armigeri, non valecti, non garciones, nee inferioris status viri quicquam mali voluerunt inferre fratri; sed milites hæe fecerunt. Ipsi judices, ipsi ministri, ipsi tortores extiterunt. Et hie fructus Parliamenti prgesentis.”\n\nIn the other case, his iniquitous conduct occasioned ultimately the death of his mother. When the king, on his march towards Scotland in 1885, halted his army at Beverley, in Yorkshire, a quarrel arose between a squire attached to Sir John Holand, and an archer belonging to Ralph, eldest son of the Earl of Stafford, respecting a German knight who was on a visit to the queen. High words ensued; and the archer shot the squire through the heart. When Sir John heard of it, Froissart tells us, “he was like a madman; and said he would neither eat nor drink till he had revenged it.” Accordingly he sallied forth in quest of the knight who had been the innocent cause of the affray; and accidentally meeting young Stafford in a narrow lane, without any personal provocation, slew him with a single stroke of his sword. His answer, when he was informed that Ralph was dead, was equally wanton and ferocious. “Be it so: I had rather have put him to death than one of less rank; for by that I have the better revenged the loss of my squire.” But he soon found the danger of his situation, and fled for sanctuary to Saint John's at Beverley. It is affirmed, that from this hour the Duke of Gloucester conceived an antipathy against him; and that he never forgave him for the transaction. The king, who was greatly incensed at it, caused him to be indicted and outlawed, and seized upon his offices. The Princess Joan, then at Wallingford, hearing that Richard had vowed Holand should suffer according to the law, attempted to mediate between her sons, and to obtain his pardon. But Richard rejected her earnest entreaties; and at the return of her messenger she was so affected with grief that she took to her bed, and in a few days expired. The king, shortly after, yielded to the solicitation of the Duke of Lancaster that for which his mother had sued in vain. Holand was received into favour, and was reconciled to the Earl of Stafford.\n\nEither the express terms of this reconciliation, or some actual contrition on the part of Holand, caused him to appoint three priests, at the king's assignment, to celebrate divine service for the soul of Ralph, two on the spot where the murder was committed, and one at Langley, every day to the world's end.\n\nIt was, probably, the hope of expiation that induced him some years after, 17 Ric. II. to repair to the Holy Land in pilgrimage. He visited Jerusalem and Saint Catherine's of Mount Sinai, and purposed to have returned by way of Hungary. As he passed through Paris, where from his birth and connexions he was generously received at the court of the French king, he heard that the king of Hungary was to fight with Bajazet, and publicly avowed his resolution of joining the Christian army. An engagement took place, but, fortunately for him, he was not among the combatants: out of a great number of the French, who mingled in that fight, very few revisited their native country. His absence in Palestine prevented him from attending the king on the first expedition into Ireland. Of late he had been chiefly at court and about the person of his brother. Great jealousy had subsisted between him and the Duke of Gloucester; Froissart says, Huntingdon was much afraid of him. He was one of his appellants. Carte has endeavoured to disprove the story of his brutal conduct at the execution of Arundel, as related by Walsingham; and at any rate the wishes of humanity are on his side. After the death of that nobleman, he took possession of his residence in London called Cold Harbour, in the parish of All Saints in Dowgate Ward, then counted, “a right fair and stately house; and it is upon record, that in 1397 the king dined with him there. He gave him the whole of the furniture in the castle of Arundel. In the present campaign he was retained to serve with one hundred and forty men at arms, and five hundred archers: and about this time obtained a grant of various castles and lordships in Wales, which had belonged to the late duke of Lancaster. His acceptance of these would naturally have excited the displeasure of Henry, in whose presence he was shortly to appear.\n\nAfter the deposal of Richard he was adjudged in parliament to lose the greater part of his honours and lands, but allowed to retain the title and estate of the Earl of Huntingdon. Having joined in the conspiracy against Henry IV. he remained in London till after the battle at Cirencester. He then made two several attempts to escape by sea, but being driven back by contrary winds, was taken and beheaded. Historians differ as to the place where he was arrested, but they in general concur that he lost his head at Pleshy, the spot from which he had been instrumental in enticing the Duke of Gloucester to his untimely end. The MS. Ambassades describes his decollation there, accompanied with circumstances of peculiar cruelty; yet Carte very reasonably doubts whether he was put to death at that place. After his apprehension he was certainly committed to the Tower of London; though Walsingham makes him remain a prisoner in the gate-house at Pleshy from his capture to his execution. Few of the accounts agree; but Froissart is wider of the mark than any of them, when he says, not only that he was slain fighting at Cirencester; but that he was absent at Calais as governor, during the time when the king was taken.\n\nBy his wife, daughter to John of Gant, he left issue, two sons and one daughter.\n\npage 81 note y Thomas Holand, Earl of Kent and afterwards Duke of Surrey, nephew of the above mentioned John Holand; son of Thomas Holand, Earl of Kent, by Alice, daughter of Richard, Earl of Arundel. His father had been dead about three years.\n\nThis young nobleman had been one of the appellants of the duke of Gloucester, and was rewarded, 21 Ric. II. with the castle and manor of Warwick, together with many other manors forfeited by the Earl of Warwick to the Crown. The title and dignity of Duke of Surrey was conferred upon him in the parliament of Shrewsbury, 21 Ric. II. and shortly after he was constituted Marshal of England, and acted in that capacity at the duel at Coventry; Thomas Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham, the first Earl Marshal, being one of the combatants. He was made Lieutenant of Ireland upon the death of the Earl of March, and arrived there on the feast of Saint Mark, April 25, 22 Ric. II. He behaved with great bravery; but was unable either to repress or appease the insurgents. In fact the grant of Mac Morogh's forfeited barony of Norragh, which had been made to him, was one of the pleas of that rebellious chieftain for rising in arms. About the same time he was appointed governor of the castle of Liverpool, and obtained the castle and lordship of Carlow.\n\nHe had offended Henry by his prosecution of the Duke of Gloucester, and was imprisoned by him as soon as he got him into his power at Chester. In the first parliament of the ensuing reign he urged his tender age and small reputation in defence of his having engaged in the appeal; but he was degraded from his title of duke. He associated with the conspirators, and was taken and beheaded at Cirencester on Wednesday after the feast of the Epiphany. Froissart says, that “he was young and handsome, and had very unwillingly taken part in this conspiracy; but his uncle and the Earl of Salisbury had forced him into it.” He was about twenty-five years of age at the time of his death.\n\nAn anecdote related of him a few days before this event savours strongly of youth. When the party failed in their attempt to seize Henry at Windsor, they marched rapidly to Sunning, near Reading, where Isabel, Richard's queen, then resided. There the Duke of Surrey, with the Earl of Salisbury, entered the palace, dissembling their mortification before the household, who came out to meet them. Surrey then crossed himself, and began to harangue them in the following strain: “Bless me what is the matter, that Lord Henry of Lancaster, who boasted so much of his prowess and knighthood, thus runs away from me? and presently he added, “My lords and friends, I would have you to know, that Henry of Lancaster has been chased by me into the Tower of London, with his sons and adherents. And I mean to go to Richard, who was and is and shall be our king; for he has escaped from prison, and now lies at Pomfret, with a hundred thousand men to defend him.” In confirmation of all this, he contemptuously took off the collars, the badges of Henry, from the necks of some, whom he observed wearing them; and told them they must bear such ensigns no longer. He also pulled off the crescents from the arms of the attendants, and threw them away. Having thus cheered the queen's spirits, though to no purpose, he took his course to Wallingford.”\n\nHe founded the priory of Mountgrace, near North Allerton, in Yorkshire, where his body was buried.' It had been first interred in the Abbey of Cirencester, but was removed on the petition of his widow; his arms are still to be seen in the first compartment of the eastern window in the chapel of the Holy Trinity in that town. His head was exposed on a pole upon London bridge, from the beginning of January till the middle of March, 1400.\n\nHe was married to Joan daughter of Hugh, Earl of Stafford, by whom he left no issue. Many writers have confounded him with his deceased father. Even Dugdale calls him “brother of the Earl of Huntingdon,” contradicting what he had taken pains to prove before.\n\npage 83 note a He means to insinuate that they soon deserted him, though he gives no particular account of it. Merks was the only bishop present on his side when he was taken at Flint. The king had committed a capital error in provoking the clergy against him; they were greatly instrumental in promoting his downfal. Though he might affect the society of bishops, and was often more ready to ask the advice and attend to the suggestions of his chaplains, than of his nobler lay-counsellors, yet towards the clergy as a body, and especially the regulars, he had upon the whole, shewn himself inconsiderate, if not hostile. He seems to have looked upon their revenues as inexhaustible sources upon which he might draw whenever his necessities required; he forced heavy loans from them; and oppressed and aggrieved them in several ways. Great complaints had been made of his want of feeling in particular towards religious houses. Their hospitality is well known: but it had been frequently abused; for it was an old grievance that great men came to lodge in them when they were not invited by the governors; and whether it were at the charges of the inhabitants, or at their own charges, if it were against the will of religious persons, the intrusion was the same. Richard, in the early part of his reign, held more than one parliament in houses of this kind. In the fourth year he assembled one at Northampton, in a chamber of the priory of Saint Andrews, a place and town most unfit for such a purpose, in winter when lodging and fuel were scarce; and where a crowd of attendants pent up together must have broken in upon the quiet of monastic arrangements, and occasioned serious expences to the establishment. And that such intrusions bore heavily upon the parties may be seen in the account of a former parliament held at the Abbey of Gloucester, in the time of Robert Boysfield, the nineteenth abbot. Froucester, at that time one of the monks, was an eye-witness of the inconvenience and disorder, and has thus described it. “A. D. 1378, in the second year of King Richard II. and in the first year of that abbot (Boysfield) on the eleventh of the kalends of November began the parliament of Gloucester, and lasted till the sixteenth of the kalends of December. King Richard lodged by turns, sometimes in the abbey of Gloucester, sometimes in that of Tewksbury, at his pleasure. But while he was at Gloucester, not only himself, but his whole retinue lodged in the Abbey. It was so entirely filled with them and with the parliament, that all the convent were obliged for some days to take their meals in the dormitory, both on flesh and fish days, when their dinner was prepared in the store-room; and afterwards for greater convenience, while the parliament lasted, in the school-house.” He then points out how the different parts of the building were occupied by the different courts, and proceeds; “All open spaces in the monasterv were so crouded by persons coming to the parliament, that it appeared more like a fair than a house of religion. The grass-plot of the cloister was so trampled down with wrestling and ball-playing, that not a vestige of green was to be seen upon it.” The distress of the monk under the temporary hardship of being dispossessed of his refectory and kitchen may excite a smile; but a little reflection upon the nature and constitution of their establishments may convince us, that the misrule occasioned by such occupation must have been in every respect most unwelcome. This want of consideration for them might in the first instance be rather attached to the ministers than to the young king: but he gave farther proofs of it in his circular visits to the Abbies. His stay at that of Bury in 1383, for ten days, cost them eight hundred marks, at a time when they could very ill afford it, Walsingham peevishly shuts up the account of these visits. “Tsedet recordationis tot nugarum, et idcirco placet melius silere quam loqui.” When he set out for Ireland he gave them a strong proof that he had no hesitation in violating their privileges, if it suited his convenience; for although they were allowed to be exempt from furnishing armour, horses and carriages in time of war, these articles had been unsparingly extorted from them.\n\nOne of Richard's advocates has extolled his “great veneration for the clergy, whose privileges he maintained more than any of his predecessors;—neither in any other time,” he assures us, “were they less wronged.” It cannot be denied that their liberties were often formally asserted and acceded to in parliament; and that upon one occasion he sided with them against the laity, and declared, that he was resolved to leave the church in as good a state, or better, than he found it. As to the public acts of this reign, the enforcement of the statute of promisors was in favour of the English clergy; and the profane statute, as Knighton is pleased to call it, and that of appropriations passed in the parliament of 1390, were so far really to the advantage of the church, as they went to the correction of abuses in a community, in which there was room enough for reform. But the personal conduct of the king was not conciliatory towards them: the contempt with which he treated the pope, his harshness towards several prelates, and towards Arundel in particular, would increase the dislike of a great majority; and at length he had excluded most of them from any share in the administration of affairs. Widely different from this had been the conduct of his predecessor, who, while he judiciously restrained any encroachments of the clergy, understood the art of turning their services to account in the management of his temporal concerns; and in the zenith of his prosperity had more of them in office about him than any prince in Europe.\n\nThis, at least, shewed Edward the Third's good opinion of them; but he seems not to have calculated upon the injurious effect that might arise to the individuals, and through their example to society, by engaging them in affairs so discordant to their profession. Neither had such been the notion of the times. Jealousy, or a better estimate of the matter, occasioned the laity some years after to remonstrate, 45 Edward III. and the order of things was changed.”\n\nThe Duke of Lancaster might discern the general impolicy of Richard's proceedings towards the church; and in the outset of his enterprise, when promises were cheap, when he was backed by the pope, and every thing went smoothly before him, he made solemn oath that he would respect their rights. Whether he adhered to his professions, after he came to the throne, it is not our purpose to enquire: his enemies in their insurrections openly affirmed that he had broken his word.\n\npage 86 note c Thomas Merks, Merk, or Newmarket, (de novo mercatu) whose fidelity to the king has been applauded by so many succeeding writers. Their commendations of him are chiefly founded upon a resolute speech which he is reported to have made in the first parliament of Henry IV. against the deposition of Richard II. But the authenticity of that speech, which will be adverted to in it's proper place, was shewn to be questionable, in a controversy respecting hereditary right and passive obedience, three centuries after the death of this prelate, when his character and conduct became the subject of strict enquiry. On one side he was set forth as a glorious example of loyalty and fortitude, a man of conscience and integrity, a champion for the right heir; on the other side, as a tool of the mal-administration of Richard's arbitrary reign, led by his own interests to espouse the king's cause, a bold adventurer, but a very impotent actor in treason and rebellion. Both parties, arguing for victory, may have overstrained their representations; but Bishop Rennet's exposure of Merks, to which no impartial reader can refuse the praise of industry and ability, holds him up in a very different light from that in which he has been viewed by most historians. He has brought forward facts, which were previously suppressed or unknown, and has shewn that his attachment to the cause of Richard was not so permanent as had generally been believed.\n\nIt appears that about 18 Ric. II. Merks was a doctor of divinity, and a person of some consequence at the university of Oxford; he was also a Benedictine Monk of Westminster; where being of the abbot's party, his quickness of talent recommended him to the ministry and to the king; by whom, on the translation of Bishop Read to the see of Chichester in 1397, he was promoted to the bishoprick of Carlisle, in opposition to the objections of the monks, who claimed the right of election. Under his episcopal character he was distinguished rather as a minister of state than a spiritual guide; and was employed in a variety of secular concerns at home and abroad. He joined in the proceedings against the Duke of Gloucester, and the Arundels; and continued to the last in great estimation with King Richard, who left him by his will a cup of the value of twenty pounds. He followed his master's fortunes, so long as that monarch continued at liberty; and used his endeavours to obtain his restoration to the crown. It seems undeniable that about the meeting of the first parliament of Henry IV. Merks had for some reason incurred that king's displeasure, who placed him in custody at Saint Alban's; and that he was brought before the parliament by warrant, dated October 28, 1399. After this he was suspected to have had communication with the insurgents, whose attempts were crushed at Cirencester; and, though he did not openly act with them, was arraigned before a special commission for having held meetings with other conspirators in London, at Saint Paul's church, in the ward of Baynard's-castle, in the parish of All Saints the Little, in the ward of Dowgate, and in other places; and was found guilty and sent to the Tower; but he was pardoned and released at the end of the year 1400. According to Carte, he was committed to the Marshalsey in the year following; but at last set at liberty. In the meantime, the see of Carlisle had been reported vacant, and Henry procured the pope to translate him to the bishop rick of Saraos, inpartibus infidelium. The same author represents him reduced by poverty to return to the protection of the Abbey of Westminster; that the convent presented him in 1404 to the living of Todenham in Gloucestershire; and that he enjoyed it till his death in 1409.\n\nBut Kennet draws a very different picture of his occupation in the interim between his liberation and his decease; he states that Merks was committed to the custody of the Abbot of Westminster; that he retired to Oxford; obtained the prebend of Massam, in the church of York; acquired the favour of Henry IV. and received from him the vicarage of Sturminster Marshal, in the diocese of Sarum, and county of Dorset; that he conciliated the esteem of Archbishop Arundel; acted as his commissary; and was returned a member of the lower house of convocation for the province of Canterbury, which convocation he opened with a Latin sermon, on May 10, 1406. The publication of these facts, for which he cites sufficient authorities, has robbed Merks of a portion of the interest which he had excited, when viewed as a man, who in degradation and seclusion ever maintained an inviolable attachment to the deposed king. Though he forsook him not while hope remained; others might be found who pushed still farther their devotion to his cause and person. And when we see that he courted his adversaries, whatever may be the opinion that may be formed of him, we are no longer to imagine that he patiently and perseveringly cherished the feelings, which have been attributed to him, in monastic retirement or pastoral labours to his latest hour.\n\npage 89 note e Sir Stephen Scroope, eldest son of Henry, Lord Scroope of Masham, in the county of York. He was about forty-eight years of age, and had been a soldier from his youth, having served in France and Flanders during the last and present reign. When the Earl of Warwick was banished to the Isle of Man, 20 Rich. II. Sir Stephen was joined with the Earl of Wiltshire, his brother, in the precept for his safe conveyance and custody. In the same year he was constituted Justice of Munster, Leinster and Uriell in Ireland, where by iniquitous behaviour and abuse of power he excited the disgust of the English as well as Irish. This was the last post that he held under Richard the second. It will be found that he was made captive with him at Flint; where he courageously sustained the only remaining poor relic of the fallen monarch's state. When Richard came down from the tower to put himself into the hands of his adversary, Sir Stephen bore the sword before him. After these affairs he retired to his manor of Bynbury in Kent, where, in Hen. IV. he was accused by John Kighlee, esquire, of being privy to the insurrection so often alluded to in these notes. His trial was held, August 4, 1400, in the court of chivalry, in the Moothalle at Newcastle upon Tyne; when he was acquitted, and his accuser condemned to the same punishment that Scroope was to have endured, had he been found guilty. Henry IV. soon took him into his service. In the course of that year he was made joint governor with Sir Richard de Grey of the castle of Roxburgh, in Scotland; and in 2 Henry IV. went again into Ireland, as the deputy of Thomas, the king's son, lieutenant of Ireland.\n\nAnd now the firmness of a female corrected the errors of his former administration, and rendered his conduct towards the Irish as beneficial as it had before been injurious. His wife, Margery, who had been widow of John de Huntingfield, and to whom he had been married twenty-four years, having heard the complaints that had been made against him, refused to accompany or continue with him there; except, as the account is given in the antiquated but expressive language of Holinshed, “he would receive a solemn othe on the Bible, that willingly he should wrong no Christian creature in that lande, that truly and duly he should see payment made for all expenses; and hereof, shee sayd, shee had made a vowe to Christ so determinately, that unless it were on his part firmly promised, she could not without peril of soul go with him. Hir husband assented; and accomplished hir request effectually; recovered a good opinion for his upright dealing, reformed his caters and purveyers; enriched the country; maintained a plentiful house; remission of great offences, remedies for persons endaungered to the prince, pardons of landes and lives he graunted so charitably, and so discreetly, that his name was never recited among them without many blessings and prayers; and so cheerfully they were redy to serve him against the Irish upon all necessarie occasions.”\n\nIn the absence of the king's son he continued to act as deputy lieutenant in Ireland, with some intermission, till his death. Occasionally he revisited England; as in 1403, and the two following years, when his charge of Roxburgh castle, and commission to treat respecting the prisoners taken at the battle of Hamildon, demanded his personal attention. James Butler Earl of Ormond, was usually appointed Lord Justice in his stead. How valuable his services were deemed by the young lieutenant, Thomas of Lancaster, from his ability, experience, and local knowledge, may be understood by an interesting letter given in APPENDIX NO. III. It is addressed by the prince to his father in 3 Hen. IV. and conveys a pleasing proof of his duty and affection and of discernment beyond his years.\n\nIn 1407, with the aid of the Earls of Desmond and Ormond, and the Prior of Kilmainham, Scroope invaded the lands of Mac Morogh, and vigorously chastised that chieftain and others of the rebels. He died at Tristel Dermot on the festival of Saint Marcellus, the Martyr, February 10, 1408.\n\nHe was summoned to parliament among the Barons of the realm from 16 Rich. II. to 7 Hen. IV. inclusive.
