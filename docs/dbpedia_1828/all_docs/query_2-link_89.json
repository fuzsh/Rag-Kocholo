        "text": "MEMORIES OF MAGGIE\n\nEDITED BY\n\nIAIN\n\nDALE\n\nintroduction\n\nThe idea for this book came on a holiday to the United States when I came across a marvellous book called ‘Recollections of Reagan: A Portrait of Ronald Reagan’ (edited by Peter Hannaford and published by Morrow in 1997). Using the premise that if it was good enough for Ronald Reagan it was good enough for Margaret Thatcher I stored the idea at the back of my mind and eventually decided that the book should appear to coincide with the tenth anniversary of her resignation (or perhaps more accurately, overthrow) as Prime Minister. Just as people remember where they were when Kennedy was shot, most people in Britain remember exactly where they were when they heard Margaret Thatcher had resigned.\n\nThis book has been a pleasure to compile, edit and indeed publish. I am indebted to the contributors whose anecdotes are entertaining, informative and, on occasion, quite moving. They all provided their contributions on the understanding that royalties from the book would be donated to one of Lady Thatcher’s favourite charities, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and we are delighted to have received their co-operation.\n\nParts of this book are available to read on the new Margaret Thatcher Internet Website http://www.margaret-thatcher.com. There is also an opportunity on the site to add your own particular memories. Or you may do this be emailing your contribution (of between 400 and 1500 words) to memories@margaret-thatcher.com.\n\nThere is a danger with a book like this – particularly when it has a title like ‘Memories of Maggie’ – is that it is viewed almost as a tribute to someone who is with us no longer. Margaret Thatcher is most definitely still a part of the political tapestry of this country and long may she remain so. Her views are perhaps even more relevant today than ever. The tragedy is that whenever she expresses opinions they are inevitably interpreted as attacks on her successors and she therefore rarely makes pronouncements on domestic politics. In this country we are never quite sure what to do with ex Prime Ministers, so our media spends its time on the search for splits and controversy. If only we could find a proper role for ex Prime Ministers the political lives of their successors might be a little more comfortable.\n\nThis book contains anecdotes from world leaders, former Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament, journalists, civil servants and many other people who have experienced memorable encounters with the IronLady. We have also received co-operation from several leading publishers which has allowed us to reprint relevant passages from the memoirs of the Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev and the late AlanClark among others.\n\nIn the introduction to my previous book on Margaret Thatcher, As I Said to Denis:The Margaret Thatcher Book of Quotations (Robson Books, 1997) I said that an aim of the book was to give the reader insight into the character of MargaretVThatcher and her political views. It is even more the case with this book and I hope it goes some way to destroying the myth of a hard, uncaring and ill-meaning politician. I hope that you, the reader, will enjoy the anecdotes in this book and will forgive me for getting the ball rolling with my own!\n\nef\n\nMy first encounter with Margaret Thatcher came in 1983 when she invited the chairmen of the various University Conservative Associations to a reception at Number Ten. For a country boy like me, it was unbelievable to have been invited and it was something I had been looking forward to for months. Just to climb those stairs, with the portraits of all past Prime Ministers on the walls was worth the trip on its own. And there at the top of the stairs was the Prime Minister. She had obviously perfected the art of welcoming people to receptions and as she shook you by the hand and wished you a good evening, she moved you on into the room without you even knowing she was doing it. Most of the Cabinet were there – I remember discussing with Cecil Parkinson the number of free running shoes he had been sent after a recent profile had announced to the world that he was a keen runner. He offered me a pair but it turned out his feet were much smaller than mine! We were constantly plied with wine and I made a mental note to stop at two glasses. But after the second glass was emptied I felt rather self-conscious without a glass in my hand so grabbed another. Just as the Prime Minister walked by I took a sip. All I remember is my stomach heaving and me thinking that I was about to throw up at the Prime Minister’s feet, thus ending a glorious political career which had hardly got off the ground. Luckily I managed to control my stomach and all was well. It turned out that it was whisky in the glass, rather than white wine.\n\nLater in the evening, as I was talking to my local MP, Alan Haselhurst, the division bell sounded. Although there were at least 40 MPs there, none made a move to leave to go and vote over the road in the House of Commons. Mrs Thatcher started to look rather irritated and was obviously none too impressed. In the end she walked to the middle of the room, took off one of her shoes and banged it on the floor. There was instance silence. The Prime Minister then spoke. ‘Would all Conservative MPs kindly leave the building immediately,’ she instructed. ‘And the rest of us will stay and enjoy ourselves!’ Naturally we all laughed uproariously, enjoying the sight of the MPs trooping out of the room in a somewhat sheepish manner.\n\nAfter I graduated I went to work at the House of Commons as a researcher for a Norfolk Member of Parliament. He was not a particularly well known MP and never courted publicity. He had a marginal seat and devoted himself to his constituency rather than join the rent-a-quote mob. It served him well as he held his seat for the next two elections. If ever there was an MP less likely to be involved in sleaze it was him. But one day, a careless error by me left him open to charges of dirty dealing. We ran a businessmen’s club in the constituency, called The Westminster Circle. It served two purposes – one to keep the MP in touch with local businesses, and secondly to raise a little money for the very poor constituency association. For £100 a year business people joined and were given a dinner in the House of Commons, usually addressed by a Cabinet Minister, and another dinner in the constituency, addressed by a more junior Minister. These clubs were common in all parties up and down the country. But in a publicity leaflet designed to attract new members I had used the phrase ‘with direct access to government ministers’. By this I had meant that they would be able to meet and speak to a government minister at the dinner. In those pre ‘cash for questions’ days we were all rather innocent. But it proved to be my undoing – and very nearly my employer’s.\n\nEarly one Tuesday afternoon he found out that at that day’s Prime Minister’s Question Time, the Liberal leader, David Steel, would raise this subject with the Prime Minister. He immediately went to see her in her office behind the Speaker’s Chair. He must have been quaking in his boots but he later told me she had been brilliant. She sat him down, offered him a coffee and heard him out. She did not disguise her dislike for Steel and thought it typical of him to operate in this manner. She told him she would let Steel have both barrels, and of course she did! He returned to the Office after PM’s Question Time and related the events of the day to me. I had been completely oblivious, which was just as well as I would no doubt have been having a premonition of what a P45 looks like.\n\nA few months later I was having lunch with a couple of Tory MPs in the Members’ Cafeteria. We had just finished our lunch when in walked Mrs T and her entourage. She grabbed a tray and chose a light lunch of Welsh Rarebit. Unfortunately, as we had finished, I did not have cause to hang around too much longer so left the room, cursing that we had decided to have an early lunch. A few minutes later I realised I had left some papers and magazines on the table in the cafeteria and returned to retrieve them. As luck would have it, the Thatcher group had sat themselves at the table we had been sitting at and Mrs T had her elbow plonked on my papers. I decided to summon up the courage and interrupt them to ask for my papers. Just as I had started I looked down at the pile of papers and to my horror saw that my copy of the new issue of Private Eye was on the top of them and the front cover had a particularly nasty photo of Denis Thatcher. Mrs Thatcher cottoned on to what I wanted, removed her elbow and gazed down at the offending magazine. My heart stopped. ‘Oh, Private Eye, Denis loves it,’ she gushed. To my eternal shame, I just picked it up, along with the rest of the papers, made my excuses and left. What a wimp.\n\nIn 1995 I took an American friend, Daniel Forrester, to the T E Utley Young Journalist of the Year awards at the Reform Club. Lady Thatcher had been invited to present the awards. She treated us to a half hour impromptu speech on political issues of the moment, which seemed to go by in about five minutes – quite an achievement as her entire audience had to remain standing throughout. After she had finished Daniel whispered to me: ‘I have to meet her, what should I do?’ Knowing of her penchant for strapping 6 feet tall dark haired American men I encouraged him to go and introduce himself. He suddenly got cold feet so eventually I dragged him over to where she was talking to several of the award winners. In typically American style he launched into a sycophantic introduction which immediately attracted her attention. ‘Mrs Thatcher,’ he began. I kicked him. ‘Er, Lady Thatcher,’ he hurriedly corrected himself, ‘May I say how much our country misses your leadership....’ and he continued in that vain for a few seconds. While he was speaking, the diminutive figure of the Iron Lady (for she is much smaller in height than most people imagine) stared up at him, her eyes never leaving his. When he had finally finished having his say, Lady Thatcher hardly paused for breath. ‘Your President, President Clinton.’ She paused, heightening the drama for our American friend. ‘He is a great communicator.’ Up came the forefinger, almost prodding Daniel’s chest. Then in a particularly contemptuous tone, came the pièce de résistance. ‘The trouble is, he has absolutely nothing to communicate.’ With that she was away. It was almost a flounce. Daniel eventually came down from whichever cloud he had been on – probably nine – and said, ‘I’ll remember that for the rest of my life’ – and as a well-known critic of Bill Clinton, has been dining out on it ever since.\n\nMy latest encounter came at a retirement party for ITN’s much missed political editor Michael Brunson. My friend Alan Duncan, the Tory MP for Rutland, started a conversation with her and she suddenly asked where Denis had disappeared off to as they had to leave for a dinner. Being of diminutive stature, and me being over six feet tall he asked me to scan the room. Both of them looked at me expectantly. To my horror I spied Denis on the other side of the room talking to Michael Heseltine. I summoned up all the courage at my disposal and explained where he was. Lady Thatcher’s eyes became even bluer than normal and she exclaimed:‘Denis and I are having dinner with Cap Weinberger tonight. I think he’s rather more important than THATman, don’t you! If Denis isn’t over here within one minute I shall go over and stare at them.’ Luckily for Michael Heseltine, she didn’t have to.\n\nWhat memories! What a woman! What a Prime Minister!\n\nIain Dale\n\nAugust 2000\n\nlord biffen\n\ncabinet minister 1979–87\n\nJohn Biffen, now Lord Biffen, served as a Cabinet Minister under Margaret Thatcher from 1979 until 1987, initially as Chief Secretary to the Treasury then later as Secretary of State for Trade, Lord President and Leader of the House of Commons and finally as Lord Privy Seal.\n\nef\n\nUnbending Leadership\n\nThe career and character of Margaret Thatcher will fascinate historians for decades to come. Her achievements and limitations will bear constant re-interpretation. This short piece would not seek such an academic task, but only offer a personal recollection.\n\nHer actions never betrayed the trivial or banal. She was puritanical and committed to the work ethic. She despised the worldly and cynical politics of many Tories. I suspect she looked upon the Macmillan period with some unease and felt that his sunset years, from Profumo onwards, showed the consequence of a lack of political purpose. Her decision to stand against Edward Heath for the Conservative leadership in 1975 was an example of cool courage. No member of Heath’s Cabinet, and more particularly William Whitelaw, was prepared to stand against him. She, alone, broke rank, although Keith Joseph might have done so had he possessed the suitable temperament. Margaret Thatcher was not foolhardy in her venture. She had self-confidence and a deep sense that the Conservative politics of the Heath Government needed reversing. Thirty years later it is difficult to recapture how demoralised the Tories had become by U-turns and ineffective trade union legislation.\n\nDoubtless this inspired Margaret Thatcher to convert a defeated party into a government in exile. Rarely have policy groups worked so assiduously to propose measures ‘proof against U-turn’. The trade union plans were recast to avoid the ignominy of the unenforceable Industrial Relations Act of Geoffrey Howe and Robert Carr. A host of City executives and academics, and notably Arthur Cockfield, toiled to produce a fiscal and monetary policy that would restore liberal economics and escape the thraldom of price, income and exchange control. The technical financial skills accumulated in Opposition fully matched the resources of the Treasury under Denis Healey.\n\nMargaret Thatcher was not a commanding Commons speaker, certainly not equal to James Callaghan, but she was a formidable party leader. For her politics was not a game for amateurs: everything was played in earnest. This austere drive inspired the Parliamentary party, and even more raised the morale of the Conservative activists in the country. Her rhetoric became sharper and more effective as she was able to tone down her natural shrillness. The Soviets dismissed her as ‘the Iron Maiden’. She grasped the epithet and turned it into a compliment. The irony was that in many ways her commitment to firm government was reminiscent of her predecessor whom she had toppled. ‘Ted Heath in drag’ observed Denis Healey; but she was determined to succeed in economic and trade union policies where he had been ill served by fortune.\n\nThe redoubtable character of Margaret Thatcher became increasingly apparent in the early years of her premiership. Britain had a Premier in a hurry. She was calculating and determined, placing her known supporters in the key Treasury and economic posts. The relative isolation of the pragmatists – later derided as ‘wets’ – was a high-risk strategy; but it paid off. There were no resignations on account of policy, and the Cabinet was gradually reshaped with younger and more sympathetic members. Her Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, loyally carried out the essential tenets of the new liberal economics. Exchange controls were abolished along with regulated prices and incomes. Public spending was stabilised and taxation was changed to enable income tax reductions to be financed by increases in Value Added Tax. It is no disparagement of Howe to say that he could not have achieved such major changes without the full-hearted support and prodding of his Prime Minister. No Cabinet cabal of spenders could prize apart the Downing Street partners. Alas it was not always to be the case.\n\nMargaret Thatcher’ s single mindedness was best demonstrated in the latter half of 1981. Unemployment had risen sharply; there were the usual government ‘mid term blues’; the academic world was almost unanimous in calling for ‘moderation’ and a return to some kind of Keynesian economic policy. She persisted with her plans despite her growing adverse reputation for stubbornness. The sobriquet coined by Ronnie Millar, surely the decade’s most elegant spinner, was ‘the lady’s not for turning’.\n\nThis view of her determined courage was emphasised by the Falklands dispute with Argentina. That conflict has been well documented. The task of recapturing the islands was a logistic nightmare. Success has subsequently created the false impression of comparative ease. Margaret Thatcher knew only too well the hazards of distance to the South Atlantic and the ambivalence of some of our NATO allies. Politically the campaign was conducted by a small inner Cabinet. There was general domestic political support for the venture but it would have been dissipated if there had been defeat or misfortune. Margaret Thatcher knew this and kept her nerve. There was no shortage of those who vainly sought a compromise settlement. If victory goes to the brave she certainly deserved her triumph. In the Commons, Enoch Powell – no stranger to courage and purpose – commented ‘Is the Right Hon Lady aware that the report has now been received from the public analyst . . . It shows that the substance under test consisted of ferrous matter of the highest quality, that it is of exceptional tensile strength, is highly resistant to wear and tear and to stress, and may be used with advantage for all national purposes?’\n\nThere can be a nemesis which may mock the quality of determination and courage. Self-confidence becomes self-righteousness, and commitment becomes stubbornness and a vision becomes an obsession. Furthermore, as Churchill discovered, the British electorate is often short on gratitude. It was an experience that Margaret Thatcher suffered unhappily in her premiership between 1987–90. One particular measure focussed growing hostility – the community charge, popularly described as the ‘Poll Tax’. The radical agitators took to the streets and incensed members of the middle classes bombarded Tory MPs with hostile correspondence. Undeterred Margaret Thatcher pronounced the tax as the ‘flagship’ of government policy and planned that it should raise more revenue than the rating system it was scheduled to replace. Such a reaction had panache but little electoral guile, ostensibly it was firm government but lacked political touch.\n\nWe live too near the events to judge properly the various factors that impelled Margaret Thatcher to lose control of the Conservative Parliamentary party. My instinctive judgement is that the Poll Tax was the major issue, not least because it had a lightning conductor attraction for other items of lesser discontent. Of course there were also major matters including the poor relations with the Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, and their divergent economic views. Her unhappy years with Geoffrey Howe over Europe have been well chronicled, and, though important, were not decisive in balancing Tory opinion in the Commons. At any rate a Prime Minister, however iron her resolution and fearless her politics, is unwise to quarrel simultaneously with her Chancellor and Foreign Secretary. The outstanding qualities of course that Margaret Thatcher bestowed upon the Conservative Party in the mid1970s-80s simply had to be adjusted to meet Britain’s changing economic and social circumstances. ‘Not for turning’ was no longer a compelling Thatcher slogan. Of course this reluctance to bend meant a somewhat poignant epitaph to her premiership, but it can never deny the overall quality of courage and perseverance that distinguish her politics.\n\nadam boulton\n\npolitical journalist\n\nAdam Boulton is the Political Editor of Sky News and was formerly the political editor of TV-am. He has been a Lobby Correspondent since 1983.\n\nef\n\nMaggie & Me\n\nI doubt even Bill Clinton has had a British Prime Minister on hands and knees before him but it’s happened to me, and it was the mighty Iron Lady as well. We were in her constituency office in Finchley preparing for an interview. When the crew moved a desk they exposed the generations of fluff and paper-clips gathered in a pit in the carpet pile. It was too much for the grocer’s daughter; the Housewife Prime Minister was kneeling in a split second to tidy things up. Whatever you think of her that’s vintage Margaret Thatcher: she lived in her own world and honoured her own values with never a thought for the concerns, or pomposities of others. At times her personal cocoon may have made her insensitive, but if you got to deal with her face-to-face it also meant she was unprejudiced without airs and graces.\n\nFor the most part though, I had only a passing acquaintance with ‘Prime Minister Thatcher’, passing me on a thousand doorsteps, in planes, in corridors, always on the way to something more important.\n\nOr was it really something more important? Certainly Margaret Thatcher always gave full value on the doorstep. The impression at least was that she would stop, think and voice a spontaneous reaction to the questions unceremoniously shouted at her by the hack-pack. It’s a marked contrast to Tony Blair. ‘The Prime Minister doesn’t do doorsteps!’ is one of Alastair Campbell’s proudest boasts – by which he means that even if you asked Mr Blair what he thought about the Second Coming now underway, he’d still walk past your cries, consult with his advisors and, maybe, come back out with a carefully crafted soundbite on his lips.\n\nMaggie wasn’t like that. Indeed the best bit of advice I ever got about her, was the first I ever received, from Andy Webb, then my boss and Political Editor of TV-am. ‘She takes everything at face value,’ he said, ‘so think before you speak. If you say ‘good morning’, she’s quite likely to reply ‘is it?’ and go into a full appraisal of current meteorological conditions.’ This, of course, made her fantastic television for reporters like me. She could always take you aback, for example likening the ‘ANC to IRA killers’ even as the one-day South African President Thabo Mbeki was being feted under the same roof at the 1987 Vancouver Commonwealth Conference.\n\nAt work and study in the USA from 1980–82, I missed out on the rise of Thatcherism at home. I sat out the Falklands in Washington: my most vivid memory of her then is of an over-stimulated Secretary of State Alexander Haig speculating luridly with the White House Corps about the precise intimate nature of the relationship between Thatcher and Reagan given their frequent one-on-one meetings. So I suppose I didn’t know any better and was fair game to be sent into the Iron Lady’s den as a Lobby correspondent shortly after joining TV-am in 1983.\n\nThatcher’s other-worldliness, or at least her determination to live in her own world, worked in my favour. She didn’t read the newspapers and her ability to discriminate between TV networks depended entirely on who she recognised with her basilisk eyes.\n\nIndeed, when she remembered it, she tended to get my name right. Perhaps because ‘Mr Boulton’ gave her the chance to exercise her elocution on the long ‘o’. My more illustrious rivals John Cole and Michael Brunson usually had to settle for the not-quite-right ‘Mr Brunston’ and ‘Mr Coles’.\n\nMind you, you were never quite sure she knew who you were. Sometimes she didn’t seem to distinguish between journalists and her hard-pressed hand-bag carriers. Working on a David Frost interview during the 1987 election, I was a little bemused to find the Prime Minister’s finger poking into my chest in the Green Room, telling me ‘the message you’ve got to get out.’\n\nI have no doubt that she was an instinctive ‘gut’ politician, what in politer circles is called ‘a conviction politician’. But I still don’t know what to make of one incident. In the 1987 General Election Campaign Labour had made much of the case of Mark Burgess, a 10 year old boy awaiting an NHS operation for a hole-in-the-heart. Several years later, long after Margaret Thatcher’s third election victory, Mark, very sadly, died.\n\nThis coincided with the end of a European Council in Denmark, when Mrs. Thatcher was due to give a series of television interviews. You would not be allowed to eavesdrop today, but in those days , with the latest deadline, I was allowed to wait my turn in the interview room itself. And so I heard four separate uneasy interviewers ask the same final question: ‘I know it’s got nothing to do with the summit, but my newsdesk insist . . . your reaction to Mark’s death’. And I saw the same emotional reaction repeated four times: the hand to the heart, the catch in the throat . . . the ‘as a mother I know how terrible this must be.’\n\nTrue or bluff? I still don’t know.\n\nI do know how sensitive she is about her family. Even after her enforced retirement, the affairs of her son Mark remained the only subject absolutely off-limits in interviews tied to her memoirs. By contrast, her husband Denis is no buffoon, brief encounters left no doubt how sharp he is, and how fiercely right-wing.\n\nChris Moncrieff of the Press Association is rightly the reporter most associated with the Thatcher years. One day I hope he delivers on his promise to publish his memoirs. His working title is ‘Maggie Thatcher’s Flying Circus’. It’s a good one because we used to get closest to her on her numerous foreign trips. There were drawbacks because where her successors have favoured commercial charters, Mrs Thatcher insisted on using the ageing VC 10s in the Queen’s Flight. The acoustics were so poor that only the person bold enough to sit in the seat next to her ever heard the briefings which she gave in the soft voice reserved for social occasions.\n\nBernard Ingham would always ensure that the print journalists had plenty of time for sight seeing, shopping and golf, with a briefing conveniently timed for deadlines. But for those of us who had to record the visit on tape, the pace was more hectic. The day usually started with a dawn call for a wreath laying. I’ve visited practically every British War Cemetery in the world with Maggie; including in Turkey the graves from the Crimean War (the more recent Gallipoli battlefield was held back for a visit of its own the next year). Turkey was also a first for the one-and-only recorded cultural stop on a Thatcher tour. I had expected the visit to the British-made Istanbul sewage works, and the gas plant where the gasometers were painted with giant portraits of PMs Ozal and Thatcher. Even the courtesy call on the General widely whispered to be the government’s ‘head of torture’ was not a surprise. But I never thought I’d accompany Mrs Thatcher on a canter through St. Sofia and the Okapi Palace. A British Embassy Official explained: ‘she struck it out of the programme but we told her there would be an international diplomatic incident if she didn’t come’.\n\nThere was a real crusading spirit about those foreign trips. Downing Street did not boast a White House style advance team, and no one seemed quite certain what was going to happen. Suspense was at its highest in her ground breaking forays behind the Iron Curtain. Here again she not only bolstered politicians like Lech Walesa and Mikhail Gorbachev, she also sought out dissidents in their freezing flats. Margaret Thatcher, clad in her new Aquascutum wardrobe, careering round the outer-Moscow tenement blocks is still the most impressive exercise in political canvassing I’ve seen. Thatcher certainly worked hard on her foreign policy. The most shaken I ever saw her was in Brussels – ashen and near tears when the new President Bush made clear Helmut Kohl was his preferred special relation in Europe. A couple of years later of course, she’d won Bush back, as he took up her strong line against Saddam Hussein.\n\nWith hindsight, we in the Westminster Press corps were as well placed as anyone to see the end coming. Cabinet Ministers complained she stopped listening. With us she stopped engaging. The gleam faded in her eyes and the fresh response to questions was replaced by a rambling monologue. ‘On and on and on’ was too long as she began to believe her own publicity. In the way that generals tend to fight the last war, I’m sure Tony Blair has learnt this lesson. Unless it all goes to his head before then, I expect him to resign in a second term.\n\nIt was a splendid exit: ‘We fight on, we fight to win’ on the doorstep of Downing Street; the tears in the car. Transitions of power are difficult for impartial reporters to cover: it’s about people you know, you can feel the elation of the victors and the desolation of the vanquished.\n\nFinally I’d like to confess that I’ve returned the compliment and been on my hands and knees before Margaret Thatcher – crawling quite literally under a live camera before an interview. Ever frank she cried ‘You look like a giant mouse.’\n\nLast year a Guardian reporter rang to ask me to nominate an icon of the Twentieth Century. There was an intake of breath on the line when I said ‘I assume you’ve already got the obvious ones like Thatcher’. I chose her anyway.\n\nsir archie hamilton\n\nmargaret thatcher’s pps 1987–88\n\nSir Archie Hamilton has been the Member of Parliament for Epsom and Ewell since 1978. After serving as a Government Whip and as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defence Procurement he became Margaret Thatcher’s Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) in 1987, remaining with her until 1988 when she made him a Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence.\n\nef\n\nLife with the Leader\n\nI first met Margaret Thatcher when she came as Leader of the Opposition to support me in my by-election in 1978 when I was first elected as MP for Epsom and Ewell.\n\nAt the end of a full day of walkabouts and opportunities to meet my prospective constituents, we had a press conference. The questions from our local newspapers were not exactly challenging and the last one was particularly sycophantic.\n\n‘Mrs Thatcher, it looks very much as if you might win the forthcoming General Election. If you do, will you find a place for Archie Hamilton in your government?’\n\nI was expecting a reply that, while being non-committal, would sing the praises of the candidate hoping to enter Parliament. Not a bit of it.\n\n‘Oh no! It’s much too early to consider that.’\n\nKnowing her as I now do, I suspect that she was much more concerned about appearing to take the outcome of the forthcoming election for granted, than being committed to having Archie Hamilton in her Government.\n\nef\n\nI was PPS to Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minster for the 15 months following the 1987 Election.\n\nWe were sitting one evening in her rooms in the House of Commons and she raised the question of women priests in the Church of England. Although brought up a Methodist, she had become an Anglican and was troubled that ordaining women would split the Church.\n\nI took issue with her and argued that as a woman Prime Minister she really could not be seen to be against women entering the priesthood.\n\n‘Anyway’, I said, ‘ I don’t know why you are so worried. I think women are capable of greater spirituality than men and also they are less inclined to succumb to sexual temptation.’\n\n‘Oh, I don’t know about that’, said the Prime Minister.\n\nAs with so many arguments, she would never cede any ground and, on occasions, one was left wondering whether one had gone too far and upset her.\n\nIt was a week later that I read a short excerpt in the paper, headed ‘Thatcher backs women priests’.\n\nef\n\nWeekdays in Number 10 started with a meeting to discuss forthcoming events and what was in the newspapers.\n\nStaff in Bernard Ingham’s press office must have got up very early to produce an extraordinarily succinct summary of all the stories in the newspapers on a couple of sides of foolscap. Closely argued articles from the broadsheets would be reduced to three lines.\n\nI asked Margaret Thatcher one day whether she ever read the daily papers.\n\n‘Oh no!’ she replied, ‘they make such hurtful and damaging remarks about me and my family, that if I read the papers every day, I could never get on with the job I am here to do.’\n\nSome years later, when John Major was Prime Minister and having serious problems with the press, I repeated Margaret Thatcher’s remark to him.\n\nHe did not respond but just gave me one of those pitying looks that people reserve for the feeble-minded.\n\nef\n\nMargaret Thatcher did not read the daily papers but she invariably studied the Sundays during her weekends at Chequers.\n\nShe always took great heart from Woodrow Wyatt’s articles in the News of the World.\n\nMonday morning meetings with Cabinet colleagues often started with the Prime Minister saying ‘Did you see Woodrow’s marvellous article in the News of the World?’ Many Cabinet ministers found that it became almost compulsory to add the News of the World to their Sunday morning reading.\n\nef\n\nAs her Parliamentary Private Secretary, I used to sit behind Margaret Thatcher at Cabinet meetings, on a chair against the wall.\n\nOn the whole, Cabinet meetings were rather formal and dull affairs, and policy formulation was reserved for smaller ad hoc meetings with Cabinet Ministers and Cabinet sub-committees.\n\nAt these meetings the Prime Minister dispensed with preamble and launched into the contentious elements of the policy paper, often with the help of a briefing from the Policy Unit, in which she had highlighted the most significant passages.\n\nOn one occasion, a heated argument ensued between her and a favoured Cabinet Minister. This prolonged and acrimonious discussion left everyone exhausted and some rather bruised.\n\nFinally, she announced:\n\n‘Of course, I agree with everything you are trying to do here. I just wanted to play devil’s advocate to ensure that you were prepared for all the counter-arguments.’\n\nef\n\nMargaret Thatcher was always known to be an avid listener of the Today programme, which she had on the radio whilst she got up.\n\nI remember her telling me that the coverage of Today regularly infuriated her husband Denis, and she used to hear him shouting ‘Bastards!’ as he lay in bed, listening to the programme.\n\nef\n\nMargaret Thatcher had a rather odd belief that it was impossible to write a speech for the Party Conference until the conference itself was underway and the ‘atmosphere’ of the gathering had been accurately assessed.\n\nThe result was that most of her conference speech had to be written at the end of a series of hard days among the party faithful and would stretch on until the early hours of the morning. Contributions came in from all and sundry but invariably only small bits were selected with the rest being torn up by the Prime Minister amid cries of ‘Nothing fresh here!’\n\nef\n\nThere was an occasion when one of Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet Ministers had asked himself to Sunday lunch at Chequers. The Prime Minister did not want to be subjected to unremitting pressure from this man for most of her Sunday, so she asked me, as her PPS, to join the two of them, plus Denis, for lunch.\n\nI gladly accepted the invitation, although slightly worried that I was neglecting my family at home.\n\nA few days later, the Prime Minister realised that her invitation might have disrupted a family weekend.\n\n‘Why don’t you bring your wife Anne too?’ she asked.\n\n‘The problem is, Prime Minister’, I replied, ‘that she has our three teenage daughters at home that weekend.’\n\n‘Bring them all’, she said.\n\nLater on, life was made even more complicated when it became apparent that my youngest fourteen year-old had also invited a friend home from school.\n\n‘I am afraid Prime Minister that my youngest daughter has invited her friend Abigail for the weekend as well.’\n\n‘Bring her too!’\n\nI admired the Secretary of State who arrived for what he imagined was to be a tête-a-tête with the Prime Minister only to be confronted with the Hamilton family and a row of teenage girls. It must have resembled a scene out of St Trinians. Not a flicker of emotion crossed his face; he was charm itself.\n\nConversation at the ensuing meal was somewhat strained. The Minister struggled in vain for a hearing, as one daughter, in that uncompromising teenage mode which is determined not to be overawed, rolled up her sleeves, and putting her elbows on the table, embarked on what seemed an interminable anecdote. The PM drummed her fingers on the table, while another daughter, benefiting from the adult distraction, dipped her finger in the jug of cream. Her friend Abigail sat immobilised as if she were a rabbit caught in the headlights.\n\nIt crossed my mind that Mrs Thatcher might have regretted her generous invitation.\n\nef\n\nTo understand the exceptional qualities of Margaret Thatcher as a politician, one should think of her as an evangelical.\n\nShe was born a woman with immense powers of concentration, a prodigious memory and an exceptionally analytical mind.\n\nWhat made her one of the greatest Prime Ministers of the last century was the conviction with which she drove her policies and the way she was prepared to risk serious short-term unpopularity for doing things which she knew were right in the long-term.\n\nAlthough prepared ultimately to compromise, she always dragged the argument further than most into her own territory.\n\nI often wondered whether her determination to press her own point of view could be attributed to the fact that she was a woman. All I do know is that all the men I have met and worked with in politics have shown themselves more ready to compromise than she.\n\nhugo young\n\npolitical journalist\n\nHugo Young was Political Editor of the Sunday Times from 1973 until 1984, and is now a columnist for the Guardian. He has written for numerous foreign magazines. His biography of Margaret Thatcher One of Us is regarded as the one of the definitive accounts of her life.\n\nef\n\nOnly One of Us\n\nMargaret Thatcher knew from the start that I wasn’t likely to be One of Us. I worked for the Sunday Times, then an independent and liberal paper not under the suzerainty of an owner who was one of her cheer-leaders. I had all the wrong instincts, being neither a Conservative nor someone who believed any political journalist should have other than sceptical connections with politicians. But despite these bad basics, we got on quite well, which was more to her credit than to mine.\n\nIt was partly, no doubt, a matter of prudence. The Sunday Times was a very big paper with a lot of politically uncommitted readers, and any interview in its pages reached an important audience. I did several of them when she was Prime Minister. The first, I well recall, was preceded by her personal search for Nescafé to get some cups of coffee together. If that happened at Number 10 today, you could be sure there had been a meeting of the spin-doctors beforehand, to assess precisely what impression should be made on this or that journalist who was coming in. Nothing happens by accident now. But the early Thatcher was a cosmetic artefact only when she appeared on television. Her personal coffee-making wasn’t, I thought, done for effect. Like her obsession with turning off the Downing Street lights, it was the extension of Grantham housekeeping into the prime ministerial world.\n\nThe reason I survived for ten years as an acceptable interviewer, and occasional off-the-record conversationalist, was, I think, twofold.\n\nFirst, Mrs Thatcher always liked an argument. Although argument was not what this interviewer particularly sought, it was a mode of discourse she found irresistible. Somewhere along the line, the very fact that I was so plainly not in her camp became a virtue. I was bestowed with ‘convictions’, and even principles. When Matthew Parris left her service as an MP, he once wrote that he was especially counselled to read my stuff as a way of keeping in touch with the world he was deserting, perhaps to know who the enemy was.\n\nOnce allotted this label, I never seemed to lose it. One of the things Mrs Thatcher said, intimidatingly, to an early civil servant was that she usually made up her mind about a man in ten seconds – ‘and I rarely change it’. So, perhaps, it was with me. One of her attractive virtues was that she never, in those days, showed any side. The grandeur of the post-imperial years was nowhere to be seen. Argument could flow on almost equal terms. She was utterly convinced that, in the course of such discussion, any reasonable person was certain to be persuaded to the way she thought: which is the trait she most specifically shares with Tony Blair.\n\nHer encompassing of me within her invincible power of persuasion was due, however, to the second feature of our relationship. I’m sure she never read a word I wrote. I retained my place in the tent of the acceptable because she never knew what I really thought, since she was a stranger to my columns. These became, as the years went by, critical to the point of savagery. I questioned her honesty as much as her wisdom (over Westland, for example). I impugned her motives, ridiculed her judgement and even cast doubt on her sanity. I remained, unread, within the pale: an ambiguous fate, but one which gave me scarcity value at my new employers, The Guardian, which otherwise seemed to have no contact of any kind with the Thatcher people.\n\nOne thing Mrs Thatcher certainly did not read was my biography of her, ‘One of Us’. This was an unofficial work in every sense. It drew on my talks with her over the years, but I never asked for a biographical interview. Members of her entourage told me, in due course, that they thought the book rather good. Perhaps because my columns were spiky, they expected a more polemical work between hard covers, and were relieved when that wasn’t quite the book I wrote. But from herself – nothing. And after all, why should she? Who would want to read what purported to be a detailed account of their life and thought, when knowing that every nuance, however honestly chronicled, was bound to be not quite how it really was. Besides, by that time, I was permanently excluded from the bunker that had become her residence, the closed world that eventually produced her downfall.\n\nThe last time I met her was in what could, nonetheless, be called a biographical context. The occasion was the annual Christmas party given by the American ambassador. A long queue was lining up to shake his hand, and suddenly my wife and I found that Lady Thatcher and her husband had materialised beside us. This wasn’t long after she had ceased to be prime minister, and she could still not quite credit that she had to queue at all. A frisson of doubt on her face plainly revealed an inner impulse to march up to the front and be greeted without delay. But Denis decided against such a display of amnesia as to who they now were, and the two of them therefore faced ten minutes imprisoned in our company.\n\nThe talk, led by her, immediately turned to writing. This was a subject which used to attract little but her scorn. She once asked me in very public company when I was going to get down to some proper work – building wealth, creating jobs etc. – instead of wasting my time with journalism. It was one of the little regrets of my life that I had lacked the presence of mind to say, given such an opportunity: ‘After you, Prime Minister’.\n\nBut now, she told me, she had just completed the first volume of her memoirs. Naturally, this became the sole subject of our ten-minute shuffle in the queue. She was now a writer. The book had been a great labour, she recalled. But I wouldn’t know anything about that, would I? Because I was a professional journalist. I was incredibly lucky, she said with patent reproach. A note of envy was even detectable. It was all so easy for me. She, on the other hand, had had to labour at getting it all down. She had written every line of the first draft herself, she said, although that nice John O’Sullivan had helped her rearrange some of the words into a better order. But it was essentially all her own work. And there would be another volume to come, on which her researchers were already hard at work. Meanwhile, what mattered was who owned the copyright to the over-matter in her television interviews. Here Denis stepped in with a commercial reckoning as to the value of what lay, untransmitted, in David Frost’s archives. This was serious author talk.\n\nIn recent years, she has taken up her life as a politician, albeit surrounded by a court rather than colleagues, and certainly not by journalists invited to give her an argument. Long ago, I resumed my original distance, and she, in more exaggerated form than ever, the delusions of unchallengeable, world-correcting rightness that marked her last months in office. But I bask in the moment when, with ego pumping in a new direction, she was briefly one of us, absolving us writers, just for a year or two, from being One of Them.\n\ngillian shephard\n\ncabinet minister 1990–7\n\nGillian Shephard has been MP for South West Norfolk since 1987. She served under Margaret Thatcher as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Department of Social Security from 1989–90 and was subsequently a member of John Major’s Cabinet from 1992–7.\n\nef\n\nMaggie’s Minister\n\nMrs Thatcher appointed me to my first Ministerial post in July 1989. It was on the day of a Number 10 Reception. Conservative PMs used to hold these after Buckingham Palace Garden Parties, when spouses were likely to be in London.\n\nWhen we arrived, Tom and I became conscious of a number of meaningful glances and smiles from the Chief Whip, David Waddington. Although the air was thick with reshuffle gossip, I had no clue that his demeanour and my future were linked. Eventually, however, he came over and said, ‘The Prime Minister would like a word with you’ and showed me into a small sitting room. In swept Mrs Thatcher, resplendent in party gear.\n\n‘Dear,’ she said (her usual form of address when she was not quite sure of your name – she still calls me ‘dear’), ‘I want to bring you into the Government and you will be going into the job I began with, Under Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security. There is a lot of detail to master, it is important to do that. You will be working for Tony Newton, as John Moore is leaving the Government. Now you had better get back to your husband’.\n\nAmazed, I crept back into the reception, where I found Tom deep in conversation with Mark Thatcher. ‘I just called in, only to find Ma shuffling’, he said, irreverently, I thought, in the circumstances. Within seconds the Chief Whip bounded up and within a few seconds more the whole room knew. It was a memorable way to get one’s first Government job – I did not realise at the time that doing it in this way merely saved the Prime Minister some time on the following day – and such was her professionalism, she gave no hint either.\n\nHowever, the next day, I arrived at the office, wondering what to do next, only to find (it was 8.30am) that Number 10 had already been on to my constituency secretary, my office and my Norfolk house. Cowed, and thinking that it had been a very short Ministerial career, I rang Number 10. ‘Dear,’ said Mrs Thatcher, ‘Just to be quite clear and confirm what I said last night’ and went on to re-state her offer. She added, ‘If I were you, I would get straight on round to the Department – there’s sure to be plenty to do’.\n\nI did, giving officials the shock of their lives and forcing the very genial Permanent Secretary to spend the next hour with me while my predecessor Peter Lloyd packed his bags for the Home Office. You cannot, after all, have two Ministers in one job at the same time.\n\nef\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ministers and, in particular, the Prime Minister, were followed by demonstrators wherever they went. When Mrs Thatcher visited Norfolk County Hall, she swept in in a motorcade. The statutory demonstrators let loose all their tomatoes and eggs at the first two or three cars, only to be dumbfounded, not to say enraged, by the sight of Mrs Thatcher, unscathed and waving from the fifth car.\n\nIt seemed to me to be such a good tactic that I recommended it to Martine Aubry when she, as my opposite number, the French Employment Minister, was similarly dogged by demonstrators. She thought it a great wheeze and said she would adopt it too. History does not relate the French outcome.\n\nlord whitelaw\n\ndeputy prime minister 1979–88\n\nWillie Whitelaw served as Leader of the House and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under Edward Heath and as Chairman of the Conservative Party. In Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet he was Home Secretary, Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords. He served as Deputy Prime Minister under Mrs Thatcher until his retirement in 1988. Lord Whitelaw died in 1999. This passage is taken from his book, ‘The Whitelaw Memoirs’ (Aurum, 1989).\n\nef\n\nLoyalty to the Leader\n\nI have often wondered how two such different people managed to get on so well together. Of course, as Prime Minister and Party Leader, it was in her hands to decide how she treated me and used me. I must therefore say at the start that it was her personal kindness and constant understanding which gave me the opportunity to help her. For my part, I hope I always remembered that she was the Leader, who had to face all the ultimate pressures and take the final decisions. Life at the top is very lonely and extremely demanding. Anyone in an immediately subordinate position should never forget the exceptional pressures which a Leader faces, and the personal reactions which they provoke. I believe we both started from these particular positions, and understood them.\n\nSecond, we both had a passionate belief in our party and so in its Government. We probably had somewhat different perceptions of how we would like to see it react in particular circumstances. On such occasions I would certainly have the chance to argue my case, but of course I had to accept that in the final event Margaret Thatcher was the Leader and had the ultimate right to decide. I do not think I ever left her in any doubt that I understood that relationship.\n\nThird, we both knew that we were very different people with varying backgrounds, interests and thus reactions. As a result we had never been close personal friends before we were brought together in this particular political relationship.\n\nI am often asked what it is like serving a woman Leader. In general I would say it is no different from serving a man, except that it would be futile not to appreciate that women are always ready to use their feminine charms, and indeed their feminine qualities, to get their way. Margaret Thatcher is no exception, nor could any one fail to recognise her great personal charm. Perhaps it was easy for me to work with a woman as I had been brought up by my mother and spent much time alone with her. No one who knew her could deny that my mother was a powerful character.\n\nI was reminded the other day by the hostess who brought my mother and Margaret Thatcher together of their only meeting not long before my mother died. No one knew how it would turn out, since my mother was immensely protective of me and, naturally perhaps, proud of my performance. She was therefore very suspicious of this woman Margaret Thatcher, who had been preferred to her son as Leader of the Conservative Party. In the event, I am told, for I certainly was not present, that they got on famously together. My mother subsequently became an immense fan of Margaret Thatcher, even to the extent of upbraiding me for failing to support her more effectively. Alas, she died before she could see Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister and her son as Home Secretary. I know she would have been far more critical of the latter than the former.\n\nOn another topic, I am asked if Margaret Thatcher ever listens to points of view other than her own. This question, with its perception of her, angers me, for it is grossly unfair. I think she probably enjoys an argument more than most people, and the more vigorous it is, the better, as far as she is concerned. She is by nature a conviction politician and so has very strong views, yet she can certainly be swayed and influenced by good arguments in the final event. I wish the critics would realise that no one could have presided over such a successful team as Leader unless they had been prepared to take account of internal discussions. Of course it is not easy to convert her, but that should surely be the case with a powerful Leader. She is certainly the type of chairman who leads from the front and from the start of a discussion makes no secret of her own feelings and views. But all chairmen have their different methods, even if most successful ones like to get their way in the end. I know that I am totally different from Margaret Thatcher in the way that I handle meetings, and that some people regard me as too conciliatory. But I have to acknowledge the truth of the remark which Norman Tebbit alleges that I made to him: ‘My image is emollient – and so I am, but only when I am getting my own way.’ I suspect too that Margaret Thatcher did not always find me easy to deal with. She had to experience – which I must say she did stoically on occasions – my sudden and unexpected outbursts of rage when crossed in argument. She often accepted, although I imagine she sometimes found it irritating, my cautious approach to parliamentary difficulties and tendency towards compromise. She seldom interfered with my conduct of sensitive Home Office issues, although she must have disliked some of my decisions on the treatment of offenders, and perhaps particularly on broadcasting matters where we have never quite seen eye to eye.\n\nIn particular we tended to have different views on the bias of BBC programmes. Naturally, Prime Ministers feel particularly sensitive to criticism which they consider unfair, since they are constantly in the firing line. My feelings about the BBC, on the other hand, were conditioned by my experience in dealing with broadcasting matters as Opposition Chief Whip during the 1960s. When I argued our party’s case at that time I felt that I was treated most fairly by the BBC, sometimes to the intense irritation of Harold Wilson and the then Labour Government.\n\nMy experience and so perhaps inevitably my views were very different from those of the Prime Minister and the overwhelming majority of my colleagues. And so when there were controversies over different television or radio programmes, I tended to come out as a defender of the BBC. In addition to my natural instincts, I also felt that as Home Secretary it was my duty to stand up for their point of view. This led to spirited discussions on occasions. As is well known, Margaret is a regular listener to the BBCToday programme and, waking early as she does, is extremely well-informed of every detail in the news each morning. So she naturally came to some meetings with that day’s programme in the forefront of her mind. I have to say that on occasions I wished I had stronger grounds on which to stand up for a BBC programme. I recognise that I had some bad mornings when I abandoned defence of the indefensible. But generally I stood my ground for I felt it was good for me and for my other colleagues, including the Prime Minister, to test our views against each other. Anyway, we probably all rather enjoyed the arguments and perhaps sometimes they did affect subsequent Government reactions.\n\nI suppose the Prime Minister listened to me most, on parliamentary and party matters, where I obviously had a great experience, and least on economic and foreign policy, where I did not claim any special knowledge and where other senior Ministers bore the responsibility.\n\nShe was always very generous with her time in giving me opportunities privately to express my feelings on any subject. She also consulted me frequently and kept me fully informed on major issues. I therefore seldom had any reason to argue with her in wider ministerial meetings and usually intervened only if I felt I could be of general assistance.\n\nI can only conclude with a general observation. Margaret Thatcher is a remarkable and powerful Leader in every way. Of course, like everyone in her position, she has her critics and detractors. No doubt she has made mistakes, but no one can deny her incredible achievements, nor should anyone neglect the great contribution that Denis Thatcher has made to them, as the country as a whole has increasingly recognised.\n\nsir alfred sherman\n\nadviser to margaret thatcher\n\nSir Alfred Sherman co-founded the Centre for Policy Studies with Sir Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher in 1974 where he acted as a formative influence on Thatcherite political and economic thinking. He served as a speech writer and aide to Margaret Thatcher from 1974 until 1983.\n\nef\n\nAll that is real is rational\n\nThose who reached the top of the greasy pole this century can be counted on your fingers; identifying qualities which brought them to the top where many others failed remains infinitely challenging. I had personally identified Margaret Thatcher as a potential successor to Heath under certain circumstances back in Autumn 1973, when asked by two friends, Basil (now Lord) Feldman, a leading party figure, and Barry Rose, publisher and one-time Conservative council-leader. Basil called this far-fetched. How right he was. That it came to pass does not make it any less so. That an almost unknown middle-aged lady from a lower middle-class background whose political career had been unspectacular could within sixteen months reach the top in the Tory interest seemed inconceivable. Nor were her chances of leading her party to electoral victory, once precariously established as Leader, rated highly until the Callaghan government’s last few months beset by difficulties of its own making. Yet in a short time she became one of the few twentieth-century leaders of whom it could be said that she ‘bestrode our narrow world like a colossus.’ But per Hegel: ‘all that is real is rational’; there must have been valid reasons for her achievement.\n\nWhen I forecast that Margaret might receive the mandate of Heaven, I had never met her, and only once even seen her. What struck me then was the fervour of her beliefs. The Spanish political philosopher, José Ortega Y Gasset, distinguished between ideas and beliefs, complaining that historians and political writers over-emphasised the importance of the former at the expense of the latter. Current sensitivity among Conservatives about what they pejoratively dub ‘ideology’, by which they mean ideas or conceptual frameworks, reflects the fact that for generations Conservatives managed on the basis of implicit beliefs incorporating practices which had evolved over time and ideas derived from classical philosophy and Protestant Christianity. As Nigel Lawson was later to argue in a CPS pamphlet, Conservatives had managed quite well without a structure of explicit ideas until Liberals and Labour elaborated theirs, following which the Conservatives had no alternative but to match them. MT filled the gap by her Conservative beliefs: the puritan ethic; personal responsibility; patriotism. Conversion of these beliefs into ideas as a basis for policies was left till later, too late.\n\nI did not meet her till the Spring of 1974, under Keith Joseph’s auspices, after he had accepted my outline for the ‘we were wrong’ Upminster Speech in June, which was to become the first in his series on ‘Reversing the Trend’, rejecting Butskellism and advocating radical Tory counter-revolution. The speech was designed to launch his new think-tank (soon to be named the Centre for Policy Studies) which Heath had suggested after Keith had declined the shadow cabinet portfolio offered, in the hope that it would keep him busy and out of mischief expounding Butskellism and Europhilia, but which I had persuaded him – I am still not sure how – to devote to expounding radical Conservatism, which eventually became known as Thatcherism.\n\nHe decided to offer Margaret Thatcher the deputy-chairmanship. She was then fifty, with grown-up children, but there was then something girlish about her: her enthusiasms; the simplicity of her beliefs; her trusting nature. She reminded me of nineteenth century explorers, aware that their ambiance was strange and dangerous but unquestioningly confident in themselves. At the time, she believed strongly that Keith should become Party leader, and that only Lady Joseph’s reluctance to give him full support was preventing this. Since Keith had always been the antithesis of a leader, this convinced me that she was a bad judge of character.\n\nShe was unapologetically aware that her grasp of ideas, politics and economics was insufficient for the role in which she was subconsciously casting herself, and had no hesitation in casting me as a second John the Baptist after Keith.\n\nWhen we first met, her chosen persona was as an upper middle class Tory lady in twin-set and pearls. But her first reactions to Keith’s epoch-making ‘we were wrong’ Upminster speech, praising it for its ‘economy with words’, suggested to me an alternative persona, the puritan grocer’s daughter, bringing faith and common sense to the convoluted world of public affairs and economic controversy: ‘economics is Greek for running a household.’ Peel’s dictum that a Prime Minister must be ‘an uncommon common man’ was relevant. Her outward demeanour as a housewife shopping at Marks and Spencers reassured many who are basically suspicious both of politicians and of political ideas, believing that politics and government ought to be much simpler.\n\nIn opposition, and to some extent in government, we worked closely for hours on end, often à deux, sometimes with her PPS’s. During the day, we worked in the Leader of the Opposition’s office, overlooking Boudicca’s statue, evenings and weekends we worked at her home in Flood Street, Chelsea, in the dining room, with a typewriter on the table. When we had progressed, she would go into the kitchen to prepare food, giving instructions though the linking door, exemplifying her dual roles. In her flat at Number 10 – living over the shop – she was in and out of the kitchen, as no other Premier ever was.\n\nIt is not easy for labourers in the vineyard to get into the minds of the great, who achieve greatness precisely because their mind and spirit work distinctively. I found that she possessed a razor-sharp mind and great application, but because they had been honed in natural science and the law her thinking was linear rather than lateral. But it was her will which marked her out. Though power wrought its effects on her in time, she remained free to the end from the side and self-importance which it inflicts on so many politicians. I remember an occasion when I had arranged to bring an American to see her, who ran a media-monitoring unit, which I believed we should emulate. As we waited in the ground-floor reception at Number 10, she suddenly appeared in the doorway in stockinged feet and took us up to her study. Conversely, she never fully acquired the art of suffering fools gladly, so essential in democratic politics. It was her body language rather than her politics which so enraged Geoffrey Howe that he steeled himself to resign his benefice and stab her in the back.\n\nIn the course of time her enthusiasm for ideas seemed to lapse, while the ironclad self confidence, which had been so essential when she was an outsider storming the citadel became an impediment. The leadership election, which she had lost by four votes, epitomised the personal dimension in her trajectory. Had she stayed and fought it, personally meeting waverers and lukewarm supporters, and impressing on enthusiastic supporters not to disqualify their vote by writing slogans on their ballot paper, and hence spoiling it, she would have come home comfortably. Instead, misled by naïve canvass reports which took voting promises at face value (since many MPs, characteristically, backed themselves both ways) and hankerings after the glory of the prestigious Paris end of the cold war summit which coincided with the leadership contest, she went to Paris and left re-election to look after itself. Her fall, like her rise, was the stuff of which cautionary fables are made.\n\nAs I argued earlier,Margaret Thatcher’s rise to power had come about by the interplay of chance and ‘necessity’ (Hegel’s rendering of the Greek ananke) between the accidental, incidental and inherent, per Aristotle. I had been catalyst to this process. When, after her 1983 election victory (which looked much larger than it actually was) Margaret Thatcher was persuaded to dispense with people and ideas which had brought her to power in the first place, it was not apparent to her that she might be eroding the ideal cement of her own power base, that her native hue of resolution might depend on the ideas which had fed into Thatcherism. In the event, de-Shermanisation of the CPS and its milieu, which had been the seed-bed of Thatcherism, set in motion de-Thatcherisation, leaving her bereft of a lodestar and vulnerable to her colleagues-cum-enemies.Legend and literature contain many such instances.\n\nbaroness miller of hendon\n\nchairman of the women into public life campaign 1986–92\n\nDoreen Miller was raised to the peerage in 1993 after serving as the Chairman of the Women into Public Life Campaign and the Chairman of Barnet Family Health Services Authority. She is currently the Opposition Spokesman for Employment and an OppositionSpokesman on Trade &Industry.\n\nef\n\nWhipping Margaret\n\nIt is sometimes said that Margaret Thatcher did not do enough to promote the interests of women in political and public life – especially in regard to appointments to her Government.\n\nHowever, her attitude to women in both spheres was entirely consistent with her general political philosophy: people as well as businesses make progress according to ability; no special favours, no quotas. Market forces, if you wish.\n\nMy own personal experiences of her was quite different.\n\nIn 1979, just prior to the election, I was given the opportunity of playing a major part in the production of a pamphlet for her constituency, in the form of a newspaper called ‘The Finchley Leader’, one edition of which had the prescient front page headline ‘We shall be the next Government’.\n\nTime moved on, and while Prime Minister she took time to encourage the work of the 300 Group, an all-party organisation dedicated to getting more women into the House of Commons of which I was Chairman – not, you will notice, Chair or Chairwoman or Chairperson! In 1991, at the invitation of David Astor and the 300 Group she unveiled a plaque at the house where Nancy Astor lived while she was an MP.\n\nIn 1990, it was at her special request in her capacity, not as Prime Minister, but as a local MP, and with the concurrence of the other three local MPs, that I became the Chairman of the Barnet Family Health Services Authority because, as she explained, since its area included her own constituency of Finchley, she regarded it as a politically sensitive appointment which was likely to be targetted by pressure groups and required someone with experience in politics as well as the organisational ability to perform the task.\n\nThis was the first of three public appointments which I have no doubt contributed to my CV coming to the notice of ‘the powers that be’, contributing to my elevation to the House of Lords, so I shall always be grateful for that particular nomination.\n\nAs a Whip in the House of Lords, she was not amongst the group of peers for whom I was responsible. Ex Prime Ministers get someone far more senior than the absolutely lowest office holder in the government hierarchy (because that is where government whips in the Lords stand on the organisation chart – and for a long time I was the most junior of them).\n\nNevertheless, as someone who had the unique opportunity of being both in touch with the government on the one side and the grass roots on the other I sometimes wanted to remind her of the contents of the current hymn sheet when as sometimes happened she departed from it. But how?\n\nThere is a riddle which asks, ‘how does a porcupine make love?’ The answer is ‘very gingerly’.\n\nI have to say that when I tactfully and as casually as I could ‘had a word’, explaining what the activists in the field were thinking, she listened carefully, nodded – and continued to go about on her own way. The point is that there was never any suggestion of ‘who do you think you are talking to?’\n\nPerhaps that says something about her character and what made her the great Prime Minister that she was. There was time to hear a different opinion, but in the end it would be she who made up her own mind and her own decision.\n\nFortunately for this country her instincts were many more times often right than wrong.\n\nI have no doubt that many other contributors to this collection of anecdotes, with a far closer connection with Margaret Thatcher will be able to give a detailed picture of her in her high office.\n\nAll I can do is to speak of her as a colleague in local politics, in her little publicised capacity as a supporter of women’s interests and as a member of the greatest legislative chamber in the world that anyone can have the privilege of belonging to.\n\nI believe that when she is judged by history – history that which will be written far removed from the hurly-burly of current politics and political disputes – her many achievements for the benefit of our country will outlive the ‘little local difficulties’ in which she is still occasionally involved.\n\nthe earl of caithness\n\nminister 1985–94\n\nMalcolmCaithness served as a junior minister under Margaret Thatcher from 1985 and then later under John Major until 1994. His Government career spanned numerous departments including the Department of Transport, the Home Office, the Department of the Environment, the Treasury and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He currently serves as an elected hereditary peer in the House of Lords.\n\nef\n\nA very ‘big’ person\n\nIt is hard to think back and picture accurately Britain twenty-one years ago. The West had lost its sense of purpose and the State dictated vast areas of our lives. We seemed to be in a quagmire from which no Government could extract us. Margaret Thatcher was the first leader in Europe to stand up and say there was a better way. Her governments were pioneers in changing the role of the State and enhancing the freedom of the individual to what we, and most of the rest of the world, now take for granted. The reforms were bitterly contested, mostly by those who are now advocating the same policies. At times she was portrayed as uncaring and seeming not to listen. However I found a different side to her.\n\nJust after I had been appointed a whip in the early summer of 1984 she held a reception at 10 Downing Street to which I was asked. I had never been there, nor had I met my Prime Minister. She was receiving her guests at the top of the stairs and, in due turn, I was introduced to her. She stopped receiving her guests and took time to show me, the most junior member of her team and youngest in the room, some of the pictures in the house and explain its history to me. She then went back to her other guests. That action is the mark of a very ‘big’ person and considerate hostess.\n\nMy first important working meeting with my Prime Minister was after about six months as Minister for Prisons in the Home Office. I thought I had a reasonable understanding of my brief by then. In our discussions it was soon apparent that she knew more of the detail and ‘nitty gritty’ of the policy than I did. It amazed me that someone with so many other issues to contend with had such detailed knowledge and cared so much about one aspect of a junior Minister’s portfolio. I realised then that if, in future, I did not know more than her at every meeting concerned with areas of my responsibility I would not last long in her government.\n\nSome years later in 1989, as a Minister in the Department of the Environment, I was due to attend a very difficult negotiation in Brussels over emissions of ‘greenhouse’ gases. Nick Ridley, the Secretary of State, had backed my proposals for a tightening of standards leading to a reduction in emissions, but this would be costly to our industries as expensive new equipment would be needed. We produced a paper on it and all the other departments briefed against it so a meeting was called to decide what to do. Nick was tied up in the Chamber of the House of Commons on the Housing Bill, so I had to argue the case with a serried rank of Cabinet Ministers opposed to me. Against the wishes of some of her most senior Ministers she backed Nick and my proposals and that became the new Government position. Rightly she then espoused the policy in typically forthright terms. Since then the standards have been tightened yet again, but at the time she was making a bold new move by backing a minority view.\n\nlord powell of bayswater\n\nprime minister’s adviser on foreign affairs and defence 1984–91\n\nCharles Powell served as a diplomat in Washington, Bonn and EC Brussels before becoming the Prime Minister’s private secretary and adviser on foreign affairs and defence, a position that he held from 1984 until 1991.\n\nef\n\n‘My God, that man is so German’\n\nAfter a previous Foreign Office career spanning twenty years during most of which Britain’s standing and influence in the world steadily declined, I found working for Margaret Thatcher on foreign affairs an exhilarating if sometimes tempestuous experience. Her extraordinary will-power and leadership broke the seemingly endless and inevitable cycle of national decline, restored the nation’s confidence and gave us the feeling that Britain once again counted in the world.\n\nIt was not exactly a tranquil experience. She was non-stop and so was the turbulence created by her legendary hand-bag. Foreign visits were invariably conducted at the double: I think our record was seven countries – Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Saudi Arabia – in eight days. Yet only once in twelve years did a slip of the tongue give away that she forgot which country she was in. That had been more of a problem for one of her predecessors, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, whose wife used to follow him down the aircraft steps on foreign visits chanting: ‘China, Alec, China’ or whatever the country was.\n\nOf course it helped being a woman: that made her more easily identifiable amongst world leaders. But it was the personality and the policies which counted. The strong and unyielding stand against Communism, in partnership with Ronald Reagan, which led to the West’s triumph in the Cold War: victory in the Falklands: getting ‘our money’ back from Europe: extricating Rhodesia from illegality to independence: standing by our American allies over Libya when others turned their backs: ensuring a resolute response to Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait. All these turned her into a heroic figure, the Iron Lady of legend. She did not win all her battles, with German reunification the prime example. And she fought some unnecessary ones, mainly with her own colleagues in Government. But she indisputably raised Britain’s international profile; and whatever the pained expressions and snooty comments of old-style diplomats, she advanced Britain’s interests. In the simplest terms, we were taken a lot more seriously in 1990 than in 1980.\n\nMargaret Thatcher was never a diplomat and proud not to be one. She had no time for courtly phrases and carefully drafted compromises. She was ready to go toe to toe with any world leader from Gorbachev to Deng Xiaoping. She had the huge advantage of being unembarrassable, a quality not always shared by her Private Secretary. I recall a meeting with President Mitterrand in Paris during which the President took her for a stroll in the Elysée garden. I sat down in the sun for a blissful moment of peace with my French opposite number, only to be shaken from my reverie by the sight of Mitterrand hurrying back, clutching a blood-stained handkerchief to himself. For a moment of panic I thought: ‘she’s gone too far this time, she’s bitten him!’ It turned out to have been an over-enthusiastic puppy which did the damage, but it was a nasty moment.\n\nShe was deeply suspicious of the Foreign Office as an institution, believing that its tribal culture led it to give too much weight to the foreigners and too little to Britain’s interests, as well as having its own agenda on European integration. She would gleefully recount the old chestnut of the man asking a policeman in Whitehall during the Second World War black-out, which side the Foreign Office was on and being told: ‘the other’. There were some memorable rages, as when she demanded to inspect the gift which the Foreign Office had thoughtfully procured for her to take to Gorbachev and discovered a handsome pair of silver-backed hair-brushes.\n\n‘But he’s completely bald’, she stormed, and a messenger had to be sent out from London with a replacement gift.\n\nFortunately the prejudice against the institution was matched by a high regard for many of its most distinguished servants, who were granted a sort of amnesty for the misdeeds – real or imagined – of their alma mater.\n\nMargaret Thatcher’s diplomacy was less concerned with making friends than with winning battles. That had a downside in her relationship with Chancellor Kohl, who went to great pains to win her friendship. This extended to inviting her to spend a weekend in his home-town in the Rhineland, including a visit to his favourite tavern to sample his favourite dish of pig’s stomach. Margaret Thatcher’s appetite seemed mysteriously to fade as Chancellor Kohl went back for seconds and thirds. We moved on to the great crypt of the Romanesque Cathedral of Speyer where Margaret Thatcher was invited to inspect the tombs of Holy Roman Emperors, precursors of earlier attempts at European Union. While she undertook this task without visible enthusiasm, Chancellor Kohl took me behind a pillar: ‘now she’s seen me here in my own home-town, right at the heart of Europe and on the border with France’, he said, ‘surely she will understand that I am not just German, I am European. You must convince her’. I accepted the assignment with trepidation. As soon as we boarded our aircraft for the return to Britain, Margaret Thatcher threw herself into her seat, kicked off her shoes and announced with the finality which was her trade-mark: ‘My God that man is so German.’ Gutless, I aborted my mission to persuade her otherwise.\n\nMargaret Thatcher captured the imagination of people outside Britain even more than at home. One only had to witness the rapturous welcome which she received from huge crowds in Poland, Russia, Georgia and Armenia in the late 1980s to realise that she symbolised their hope for relief from Communist tyranny. Or to experience her ability to rouse an American audience with her forthright rhetoric on democracy, the rule of law and the need for strong defence. Or to be swept away by the ecstatic welcome of crowds in Africa, despite fatalistic Foreign Office warnings that she would be shunned.\n\nA sometimes embattled but always defiant figure, she invariably stood up for Britain. And just as she galvanised Britain itself, so she galvanised other countries’ view of Britain as once again a strong, dependable, worthwhile ally and a country which gives a lead in world affairs. We still benefit from that.\n\ndavid prior\n\nmp for north norfolk\n\nDavid Prior was elected to Parliament as MP for North Norfolk in 1997 and currently serves as the Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party.\n\nef\n\nA Natural Curiosity\n\nI can count the number of times I have met Margaret Thatcher on the fingers of one hand, and I doubt she would remember me. The first time I met her was in 1982 when I was working for Sir Ian MacGregor, when he was Chairman of British Steel. I was asked to go to Number 10 Downing Street to brief Mrs Thatcher, as she then was, about the overlap between the nationalised British Steel and the private special steel companies in Sheffield. She was giving a speech later that week in Sheffield.\n\nAll I remember is that she had a keen interest in metallurgy, and the whole process of special steel making, which greatly surprised me. She seemed to have more genuine interest in the effects of molybdenum and vanadium on the properties of the final product than she did the squabbles between British Steel and the private steel sector. She had the natural curiosity of the scientist and inventor, as well as her strong beliefs in freedom and responsibility, which made her such a great Prime Minister.\n\nsir george gardiner\n\nmp for reigate 1974–97\n\nSir George Gardiner was the Conservative MP for Reigate from 1974 until March 1997 when he joined the Referendum Party. He is the Author of Margaret Thatcher: From Childhood to Leadership (1975) and A Bastard’s Tale (Aurum, 1999).\n\nef\n\nA cell of revolutionaries\n\nThe 1975 Thatcher Campaign Team used to meet in a subterranean Committee Room below the Commons under the shrewd chairmanship of Airey Neave. Our task was to conduct a discreet canvass of how most of the 276 Conservative MPs intended to vote in the leadership ballot, all duly recorded by William Shelton. We were an odd bunch: backbench worthies like Julian Ridsdale, John Stokes, and Angus Maude; hard-hitters like Norman Tebbit and Nicholas Ridley; the lovable rogue Billy Rees-Davies, severely war-wounded and minus an arm; and a few like myself, products of the previous year’s elections. Airey then reported to Margaret’s sponsor, Sir Keith Joseph. We were as unlikely a cell of revolutionaries as ever you could find – yet did we realise quite what a hurricane force we were about to release on the British people, a woman who would break the miserable mould of post-war politics together with its complacent and stifling corporatism? Did we hell!\n\nFew of us then could envisage a time when the mighty union leaders could no longer aspire to dictate Cabinet policy or indeed bring down Governments. In a speech nine days after her election as Leader she dealt with the issue very cautiously: often when you find a solid rock blocking your path, she said, it was best not to charge it head on, but to move round or undermine it. What on earth, we asked, did she mean?\n\nNot until we were into the following Parliament did we begin to get an inkling of what we had done. The first Thatcher manifesto, after all, was a pretty cautious document – new laws to curb picketing, slight tightening of the law on the closed shop, fresh curbs on immigration, more incentives through taxation – but not much more.\n\nAt the time the leadership election was called I was on christian name terms with Margaret, but nothing more. Then a publisher asked me to write her biography, and she agreed to co-operate. So it was that in spring that year I went regularly on Saturdays to her flat in Chelsea’s Flood Street with my tape-recorder. During these sessions I came to realise just how much her roots in Grantham meant to her. She was eloquent in describing her father, Alderman Alfred Roberts, the grocers’ shop run by her family over which they lived, the local Methodist Church and its culture, and how the privations and hopes of World War II made her what she was. Only years later did she amplify this in her own memoirs.\n\nFrom then until her downfall in 1990 I was one of her foremost backbench supporters, and for the final six years of her Premiership saw her regularly as Chairman of the ‘92’, a group of around 100 right-of-centre Tory MPs.\n\nIf you stood by Margaret in tough times she was supportive and loyal in return. But I am always amazed by the Press caricature of her as an impetuous bully, happily handbagging everyone in sight. In fact, she was immensely cautious. So anxious was she to pacify the old Wets and supporters of her predecessor, Edward Heath, that after victory in 1979 she gave them preponderance in her Cabinet for eighteen months until she reshaped it more in the image of the Party as a whole. Peter Walker, who ran Heath’s leadership campaign, was brought into her Cabinet, and even while he was delivering coded speeches attacking her policies she kept him there. Privatisation of the public utilities was barely heard of until just before the 1983 election. When miners’ leader Arthur Scargill first challenged her on pit closures she backed off; not until she was equipped to beat him did she come back fighting.\n\nContrary to Press myth, she was tolerant of other points of view, provided they were well argued. I flouted three-line whips many times, but never did she see this as an attack upon herself, nor did it affect our trusting relationship The totalitarianism that crept into the Party after her downfall had no roots in her. In Opposition, when I was among those advising her twice a week in preparation for Prime Minister’s Questions, I helped to organise a rebellion on the renewal of economic sanctions against what was then Rhodesia. We inflicted humiliation on the Tory Whips, yet when I turned up somewhat abashed to help advise her next day (along with Geoffrey Pattie, who had rebelled too) she was in teasing mood: ‘What’s the matter with you two? Have you lost your tongues?’ She knew our rebellion was based on principle.\n\nNever did she allow her high office to diminish her concern for her friends. Once, during her first Parliament as Prime Minister, I called one evening at Downing Street to compare notes with Ian Gow, then her PPS. I met him in her flat, where we watched the TV news. Our intention was to go on to his club for dinner – until Margaret arrived unexpectedly early. ‘You two boys must be hungry.’ Despite our protests she disappeared into the little kitchen, took chicken kievs, peas and carrots from the fridge – then insisted we sat at the kitchen table to join her for supper. Before we were finished Denis arrived, and he made coffee. Was there any other significant nation in the world, I asked myself, whose Prime Minister (or President, as the case may be) would insist on cooking supper for unexpected visitors?\n\nWhen I was in hospital in 1992 awaiting bypass surgery she sent encouraging messages every few days. The weekend before my operation I wrote a leader-page article for the Sunday Express; no sooner was I out of my anaesthetic than there was a note from Margaret saying how spot-on my piece had been. When I was a lunch guest at Chequers one Sunday I watched her crouching beside Margaret Tebbit’s wheelchair lifting food on a fork to her mouth. She felt it deeply that the IRA’s Brighton bomb, which left Margaret Tebbit paralysed, was in fact intended for her.\n\nIt often seemed that the media were determined never to present this human side to her character. There was the time I persuaded her to perform the official opening of the new East Surrey Hospital in my constituency. It was the first hospital she had ever opened; Geoffrey Howe, Kenneth Baker and I joined her, since the hospital served our constituencies; Health Secretary Norman Fowler and Reigate’s Mayor were also there. The afternoon’s itinerary was way behind as Margaret spent far more time than was scheduled at bedsides, listening to individual cases and sympathising. Likewise she spent far longer with staff than had been planned, asking and answering probing questions. Cameras followed her all the way. Yet what did the BBC report? Only that some trade unionist at a tiny demonstration outside had thrown an egg at her car! Big deal.\n\nHer final downfall could not have been more brutal. Over the preceding year I and officers of the ‘92’ often warned her of the dangers lurking, but she always believed she could face her critics down. Then Geoffrey Howe plunged the first dagger over European policy, opening the way for Michael Heseltine’s challenge; Heseltine said he had a better alternative to the poll tax, which was deeply unpopular, and as the election drew near many Tory MPs were anxious.\n\nShe had a so-called Campaign Team, but there was no evidence of a proper campaign; utterly complacent, they gave her totally wrong advice. Worse still, she was in Paris for the election. Not until evening the day after the first ballot (which she led, though just short of an outright win) were I and others in the ‘92’ able to get through to her. But by then it was too late; her resolution had been broken by Cabinet colleagues pledging support while telling her she could never win – ‘treachery with a smile on its face,’ as she put it later. I will never forget her then, on the verge of tears as we pleaded with her to stay in the race, which I am convinced to this day she would have won with a last-minute campaign worthy of the name.\n\nI doubt whether we shall see the like of her as Prime Minister again. Yet the woman who sent packing the likes of Scargill, General Galtieri and the hooded assassins of the IRA, who restored pride to her country after years of creeping socialism, and who with President Reagan hastened the end of the evil Soviet Empire, was brought down by a clutch of her own MPs in a blue funk over a looming election, and by Ministers who owed her everything.\n\nlord mackay of clashfern\n\nlord chancellor 1987–97\n\nAfter a distinguished legal career in Scotland, James Mackay was raised to the peerage in 1979. He served as Lord Advocate from 1979 until 1984 and then as Lord Chancellor from 1987 until1997.\n\nef\n\nAn offer I couldn’t refuse\n\nI had the privilege of being appointed to serve as Lord Advocate in Margaret Thatcher’s first administration in May 1979. We had never met and my appointment was offered and accepted over the telephone. I was privileged to continue as Lord Advocate into her second administration when I became a Judge of the Supreme Courts of Scotland. On her recommendation I was appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, one of the two Scottish full time judges in the House of Lords in October 1985.\n\nIn October 1987 I was listening to a debate in the House on the Criminal Justice Bill after the judicial sitting had terminated when I received a message from the Secretary of the then Leader of the House, Viscount Whitelaw, to ring urgently the Prime Minister’s private secretary. That I did and was invited immediately to come over to meet the Prime Minister.\n\nI duly went over to Number 10 thinking the Prime Minister had an inquiry of some kind that she wished me to undertake. Whenever I arrived at Number 10 I was ushered into the Prime Minister’s study. She arose to welcome me, immediately asked me to sit down and sat in the chair opposite. She informed me that Lord Havers, the Lord Chancellor, had come to see her a little earlier that day and had tendered his resignation as Lord Chancellor on the grounds of ill health. She asked me to become Lord Chancellor in succession to him. As you can imagine, this was an extraordinary surprise and I answered that she knew my commitment to Sunday as a special day, to which she replied that she was also of the view that it should be a special day and that there would be no difficulty on that score. I then said that I would need to consult my wife but the Prime Minister knew better than any that when one is in an important public office there are profound effects for wife and family. She said ‘certainly, please go and ring her up’ so I was duly presented with the telephone at the other end of the table from that at which we were sitting and I telephoned home, only to find that my wife was out. The Prime Minister said ‘we are very anxious to put the news out tonight of the new appointment along with Lord Havers’ resignation and therefore I am very keen to have your answer as soon as possible’. I left promising to let her know as soon as I could.\n\nAs you can imagine, I kept ringing home to Edinburgh at frequent intervals and eventually my wife came in and when I told her my message she said ‘oh well, you can hardly refuse that offer’. I duly telephoned to the Prime Minister’s private secretary but he declined to take the message and put me through to the Prime Minister herself. I told her my wife’s reply and in view of that reply I was happy and honoured to accept her invitation. She kindly said that she was delighted and that arrangements would be made for the intimation as soon as possible. The intimation was in fact made on the seven o’clock news that evening.\n\nShortly thereafter my wife was in London and we met the Prime Minister in Speakers’ House. When we met I said to the Prime Minister. ‘This was the lady for whose reply we were waiting the other day’. And with that charm and grace which was so characteristic of the Prime Minister she gave a very nice bow and said to my wife: ‘We were very delighted with your reply.’\n\nIn the order of precedence which is established for State occasions the Lord Chancellor takes precedence immediately after the Archbishop of Canterbury, before the Archbishop of York and before the Prime Minister. I hope it is easy to imagine that I felt very embarrassed, and so did my wife, at the idea of preceding the Prime Minister. Again, her charm and grace always showed and on such occasions she would always encourage us to take our proper place in front of her making it a lot easier for us to do so than if we had not been shown that charm. I remained as Lord Chancellor during the remainder of the tenure of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister and she was always most respectful and very clear about the importance of the Executive, not interfering in the work and affairs of the judiciary.\n\nmatthew parris\n\nbroadcaster and columnist\n\nAfter working for the Conservative Research Department and in Mrs Thatcher’s Private Office, Matthew Parris became the MP for West Derbyshire in 1979, a position he held until 1986. Since then he has worked as a television presenter and most famously as a parliamentary sketch writer for The Times.\n\nef\n\nI have never dared ask . . .\n\nWhen I was a Branch Chairman of South Battersea Conservative Association we welcomed Margaret Thatcher, as Leader of the Opposition, on an official visit to our neighbourhood. I and others were deputed to guide her on a walkabout down the Northcote Road (a little market) for the local Press. This was about 1978.\n\nShe spotted a council workman driving a motorised street cleaner. After speaking to him she began to climb into the driver’s seat crying: ‘Show me how this thing works and I will clean the street. Only a woman knows how to get into corners men cannot reach’.\n\nef\n\nIn 1978 the RSPCA asked Mrs Thatcher to present me (at the time I was her Correspondence Secretary) with their award for bravery in rescuing a dog from the River Thames.\n\nThe ceremony took place on Westminster Bridge in the presence of a number of officials, the dog (Jason) and some photographers. Privately, Mrs Thatcher thought I had been mad to rescue the dog. But she was a kindly employer and no doubt spotted a good photo opportunity too.\n\nDuring the ceremony the dog began (as little male dogs too often do) to mate with her elegantly-stockinged leg. She took absolutely no notice and carried on smiling for the cameras. To this day I have never been quite sure whether she realised what was going on down below, and have never dared ask her.\n\nlord owen\n\nleader of the sdp 1983–92\n\nDr David Owen served as Foreign Secretary under James Callaghan from 1977 until 1979. In 1981 he resigned from the Labour Party to form the Social Democratic Party with Roy Jenkins, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams. He became leader of the SDP after the 1983 election, resigning in 1987 over the merger with the Liberal Party. He was re-elected Leader of the SDP in 1988 and remained in that position until 1992 when he became Chairman of the International Conference on former Yugoslavia. Lord Owen now sits as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.\n\nef\n\nExpensive scent and alcohol\n\nMy first personal memory of Margaret Thatcher was as Secretary of State for Education in the early 1970s. A medical friend had come to dinner with her in the House of Commons to discuss a young patient and when she bumped into me in the division lobby she asked if I would go and have a drink with them. It was a revealing occasion, for as the conversation developed Margaret Thatcher’s best and worst qualities were on display: consideration for a young constituent and the wish to get to the bottom of a problem coupled with a total inability to comprehend how any seventeen year old could be depressed.\n\nAs Foreign Secretary we met at many official functions. In April 1979 I was interviewed in the Daily Mirror and said, ‘I saw her the other evening the House of Commons and for the first time she looked really rather attractive. She’d had a couple of whiskies and was quite glowing, in the nicest possible way. She came over, smiling that special smile of hers, and wafted a combination of expensive scent and alcohol over me’.\n\nThis was described by an angry Conservative Party as the first dirty trick of the forthcoming election campaign. It was mild compared to President Mitterrand’s remark later that ‘she has the lips of Marilyn Monroe and the smile of Caligula’. But John Junor, the editor of the Sunday Express, who had lunch with her next day, found her relaxed, even flattered. It was at about this time that I had realised that we faced in her a far more formidable opponent than it was fashionable for most Labour politicians to admit.\n\nIn addressing Margaret Thatcher’s leadership I believe the 1984 miners’ dispute showed her at her best. She had cut her losses and settled when challenged by Joe Gormley in 1981 and had then planned ahead for the inevitable confrontation with Arthur Scargill. When the pit deputies union, NACODS, threatened sympathetic strike action at the end of October 1984 I was extremely worried that any concession to them could be used by Scargill as a face-saver. I took the opportunity of being in the same room as Margaret Thatcher to have a private talk with her. She seemed genuinely pleased to find that my worries about letting Arthur Scargill off the hook were exactly the same as hers. She made no attempt to conceal the fact that some of her colleagues wanted to settle but that she was adamantly against it. She was clear-sighted about the danger of Scargill being able to claim a spurious victory. When the end came in March 1985, fifty-one weeks after the strike had started, it was the miners who disowned their leaders by streaming back to work with their funds running low and good men with their self-respect in tatters. But for the country as a whole it was essential for our self-confidence that intimidation and violence could be resisted without tear gas or mobilising the armed services. The police, with a few exceptions, did extremely well.\n\nMeeting with the Prime Minister at Number 10 in 1983 I raised the question of SDP representation at the Cenotaph. I was barely halfway through my case than she intervened to reject it, declaring that she was adamantly opposed to widening representation. Suddenly the atmosphere was heated. I told her bluntly that I could see absolutely no reason why a party that had attracted three and a half million voters should not be entitled to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. Eventually I rose to go and said that I hoped that, since the decision was formally the Home Secretary’s, she would give the matter renewed thought, otherwise I would have to take my case before the bar of public opinion. She became incandescent, alternating between a prim ‘How could you?’ to"
