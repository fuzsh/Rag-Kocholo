Favourite oddities include Roman currency found in Iceland and – a particular surprise, this one – a coin dating to the reign of the Emperor Hadrian that was excavated from under several feet of soil about a hundred miles up the river Congo in central Africa in about 1890. There is also an ongoing investigation into the mystery of how a small group of coins minted in the coastal African state of Kilwa (in modern Tanzania) in about 1200 found their way to the Wessel Islands, 5,000 miles to the east, off the north coast of Australia, where they were uncovered during the Second World War.\n\nThere is a tendency, when dealing with stories of this sort, for the imagination to conjure up a one-step, and generally romantic, solution to such mysteries – coming up with adventurous scenarios that might have taken a Roman legionary of the second century way south of the Sahara, or envisioning a Kilwan trading ship disabled by the monsoon winds and drifting thousands of miles off course to strand her crew amidst the unintelligibly alien culture of the indigenous Yolngu peoples of Australia. The reality, insofar as we can work it out, tends to be both more complex and also a lot more prosaic. The Congo coin had a high silver content, enough to make it a valuable item of exchange hundreds of years after it was struck in Rome and the empire that had made it had declined and fallen. Rather than being dropped by a solitary, way-out-of-place Roman soldier, it’s far more likely that it made its way south via a lengthy series of transactions. Possibly these started on the north shores of the Mediterranean, but continued in the Roman provinces of North Africa, from where the coin eventually made its way into the hands of desert nomads – who crossed the Sahara and then traded it to someone in the Sahel, from whence it eventually continued its journey south. Or, perhaps more likely, the coin stayed in the Mediterranean for centuries, eventually to find its way on board a Portuguese ship headed for the Kingdom of Kongo sometime after contact was established between the two states in the 1480s. Either way, it’s probable that no one person took the coin from its point of origin to its point of discovery, and the same most likely applies to the Wessel Islands coins too – which were found mixed with Dutch currency dating to the 17th century, and so, we can deduce, probably didn’t actually come direct from the Swahili Coast in the 13th century.\n\nWithout having seen the article you read (which I’d love to have a reference to…), it’s hard to know what to make of the find that you are interested in, but a few thoughts do occur. First, the coins were found inside a kettle. That strongly suggests they were not trade objects but rather a hoard, deliberately buried by someone who wanted them to stay together in one place, and hoped to come back eventually to recover them. The fact that the coins were all minted around the same date points in the same direction. But the value of the coins was very low, even in 1811, and Alexander I kopeks were minted from soft copper. That meant they contained no precious metals that would have made them intrinsically valuable to anyone outside Russia in the early 19th century, whether as trade objects or as a source of useful materials in areas where there are no naturally occurring lodes of workable metal (I commented in an earlier response on the ways in which iron carried across the Pacific on disabled Japanese merchant ships may have eventually found its way into use by indigenous communities in the Pacific north-west). So, actually, it’s unlikely the coins you are interested in made their way to eastern Canada via the sort of lengthy series of unremarkable financial transactions I was describing above – any such trades would have tended to break up the collection of currency found in the hoard, and the out-of-place discoveries I have mentioned involved single coins, or at most a small handful of them, not more than a hundred apparently struck in the same time or place. But this realisation, by itself, doesn’t take us a whole lot closer a solution to your mystery.\n\nI can make a couple of observations that might move us a bit further forward, nonetheless. Firstly, as is well known, Russians certainly were present in what’s now Canada in about the period we are interested in – Alaska was an imperial colony until its purchase by the US in 1867. That fact, however, is almost certainly less significant than it might at first appear – New Brunswick is an entire continent, and some 3,000 miles, away from any Russian settlement of the period, and getting from one side of the Americas to the other as early as the first decades of the 19th century would have been an incredibly difficult, lengthy and arduous affair, one that would have almost certainly required careful planning and involved a distinct objective. It’s very difficult to imagine what the latter might have been, nor why anyone would think it a good idea to take a big bag of kopeks with them on what would have been an unimaginably arduous trek. Overall, I think it extraordinarily unlikely that any individual or group of Russians would have made their way from Alaska to the Canadian Maritimes overland in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nMore probably, the coins arrived in Canada from the opposite direction – coming from the east. The existence of a hoard of identical coins suggests to me that they were once the property of a single person who placed some value on them and had some potential future use for them, which in turn suggests the person who buried the hoard was probably a Russian. By far the most obvious reason for such outsiders to come to New Brunswick in the 19th century would have been involvement in the fisheries there. Ships and merchants from what is now New Brunswick were heavily involved in the highly lucrative cod industry, for instance (there was also a prominent local logging industry which might also have proved attractive to immigrants). We do know that at least one Russian reached the eastern Canadian coast as a result of his involvement in the fishing trade – William Hyman, who was born into a Russian Jewish community in Lódz, in what is now Poland, in 1807, fetched up in Gaspé, Quebec, in about 1843, and built up a successful stake in the dried cod business there. By the time of his death in 1882, Hyman was one of the most successful businessmen in town, accounting for about 10% of the port’s exports, and he was able to bequeath to his heirs\n\na dock, storehouses and a warehouse at Gaspé, a hotel and several properties and mortgages in the Forillon peninsula region, and six fishing establishments… He had also accumulated many securities in banks at Quebec City and Montreal, and owned a Montreal residence where he had spent the winters since 1874.\n\nOf course, a man like Hyman would have been far too wealthy, and no doubt far too integrated into Canadian society, to have wanted to bury a hoard of old low-value imperial coins on a remote beach. But his very existence does at least establish that some Russians did make their way to there Maritimes in the relevant period. How plausible, then, is it to suggest that the coins you are interested in were once the property of some Russian fisherman? I have had a look for evidence of Russian fleets taking part in the great cod trade, and not turned up anything to suggest that this happened – sailing from the eastern Baltic, through the North Sea and then all the way to the Grand Banks would have been a costly and challenging voyage that would have taken a lot longer than the journey from a western European port like Bristol, and it would most likely have been easier for any Russians in the market for Canadian cod to have bought lightly salted and dried end product on the open market in Europe than to have fished for them themselves in the distant North Atlantic. Moreover, while the religiously observant Russians did eat large quantities of fish (Sarhrage & Lundbeck point out that the proscriptions of the Orthodox church prohibit the consumption of meat on 132 days of the year), these were plentifully available from nearer waters – the main sources were the Caspian, the White Sea, and from European freshwaters. In addition, the main Russian fish import in the 19th century was not cod, but the very differently-flavoured, and much more popular, salted herring, which made up almost 80% of imports when reliable figures become available from the start of the 20th century. Those fish, moreover, were sourced from Hanseatic ports in the Baltic, and in general local conditions would mitigate against any attempt to build a commercially-viable long-distance fishing trade based out of Russian Baltic ports – Tallin, for example, is typically iced-up for anything up to 175 days each year.\n\nNow, none of this absolutely rules out individual Russian sailors working their way west and taking part in the Canadian fisheries as part of the crew of a foreign ship, and it’s certainly possible that this did occur from time to time. But why would such a man want to burden himself with a large quantity of low-value coins that would have been useless in Canada as items of exchange? A 2-kopek coin of the period you’re interested in weighed 13g, or about half an ounce – a hoard of more than a hundred of the things would have weighed in at about 1.4 kilos, or more than 3lbs, which seems an awful lot to carry on board ship and then take off that ship in Canada for no readily apparent reason. Finally, if – as their burial and their placement together in a kettle certainly suggests – the Bathurst find was a hoard, why would any visiting sailor planning eventually to return to the only country where those kopeks could actually be spent choose to abandon them at the spot where they were found?\n\n[49]\n\n[48]\n\nQ: “In 1927 Chiang Kai-Shek boiled hundreds of Communists alive,” claimed George Orwell. Is this actually true? If not, where could he have heard such a report from?\n\nA: The Shanghai massacre, which took place in April 1927, was a fairly significant event in the history of the civil war between Nationalist and Communist forces in China; by killing what were probably fairly large numbers of urban communists in one of the most notably left-wing cities in China, Chiang and his supporters arguably helped tilt the balance of power within communist ranks towards the peasant rebel forces led by Mao Zedong.\n\nNonetheless, exactly what happened in Shanghai that month, how many died, and how they did so, remains very difficult to establish. The massacre was chaotic, and it was carried out not only by Chinese nationalist forces but also by criminal elements in Shanghai who worked alongside them. No records were kept, no bodycounts were made – historians’ estimates of deaths vary from a couple of hundred all the way up to 10,000 – and the handful of western reporters in the city at the time seem to have had little access to firm details, and to have written nothing at all about any “boilings” at the time. I have searched digitised editions of newspapers published in 1927 in both the US and UK fairly extensively without finding contemporary reports that suggest any such executions took place, and Orwell’s account, rather notably, dates only to 1945.\n\nIt certainly does seem to be true, however, that stories of such killings did circulate at a later date. Here it’s helpful to turn to Roy Rowan’s memoir Chasing the Dragon, a book written by a long-lived American foreign correspondent who reported the Chinese revolution for Time-Life. Rowan (1920-2016) was far too young to have reported the Shanghai Massacre when it took place, but he was in the country a couple of decades later, and that put him on the spot in time to pick up rumours of what had actually taken place back then.\n\nOne of the characters that Rowan wrote about was Du Yuesheng, better known as “Big Ears” Du, a gangster who ran much of the sex trade in Shanghai during the 1920s and was leader of an organised crime group known familiarly as the Green Gang. This group acted, at times, as the enforcement arm of local Nationalist leaders, and, according to Rowan, it was “Du’s thugs” who carried out most of the killings in 1927:\n\nHeads rolled in the gutter like ripe plums,” according to an eyewitness [and] a number of Communist railway workers were also cooked alive in the boilers of their steam engines… Du’s reward for masterminding the massacre was the tight hold he still enjoyed on the city’s variety of vices, from the opium section of Nantao, to the waterfront bars of Hongkew, lined with smiling Chinese singsong girl and White Russian ‘hostesses’.\n\nSo Rowan, who arrived in Shanghai in July 1946, picked up a story that could plausibly match Orwell’s perhaps-exaggerated “hundreds” of deaths by boiling, written the previous year. Where, though, might such accounts have actually originated from?\n\nI should make clear that there is certainly nothing to absolutely invalidate the idea that this unpleasant method of execution actually was employed in 1927. But with no contemporary accounts suggesting that such killings did take place, it’s worth looking a bit further afield. The first thing to say in this respect is that wild stories about people being boiled alive in China certainly did circulate throughout this period, and were very arguably one fragment of a much broader western Orientalist discourse derived from popular notions of exotic, barbarous Chinese cruelty that dated back at least a century. The infamous French novel The Torture Garden (1899), Bear’s underground Actual Photographs of Chinese Executions (c.1915), and the circulation of images supposed to show the 1904 execution of a criminal named Wang Weiqin by the “death of a thousand cuts”, all drew on (and contributed to) this trope, and one consequence was the circulation of demonstrably unreliable tall stories alleging deaths by boiling in the first quarter of the 20th century. For example, the Russian diplomat Roman Romanovich (Baron Rosen) recorded that stories circulated at the time of the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901) that one of his colleagues, Michael de Giers, had been boiled alive by the rebels; in fact, De Giers survive the uprising to die in 1932. Similarly, the British journalist Arnold Wright, writing in 1908, noted that other accounts (in circulation at the time of the siege of the foreign legations in Beijing, during the rising) confidently reported “the boiling alive in oil of every foreign man, woman, and child in the capital.” Again, no such killings actually took place. Rather, their circulation was attributed at the time to a shadowy figure nick-named “The Shanghai Liar”.\n\nSo all this background perhaps helps us understand how stories of atrocities in which people were boiled alive might plausibly have begun to circulate as a result of the Shanghai Massacre. But how did George Orwell, who had never visited China, get hold of the tale earlier than did Roy Rowan, who actually was in Shanghai in 1946? As it happens, there is a very plausible, and very fictional, explanation which seems to locate the origins of this specific story in the mind of the renowned French novelist Andre Malraux, whose best-selling La Condition Humaine (translated into English as Man’s Fate) – a book set in Shanghai in 1927 – contains a passage in which a wounded Chinese man\n\nbegan to mumble. It was too dark now for Katov to make out his features, but he heard his voice, he felt he was becoming coherent. Yes – “… don’t shoot, they throw them alive into the boiler of the locomotive,” he was saying… the sentry was approaching again. Silence, except for the pain.\n\nExactly where Malraux got this detail from, or how he dreamed it up, is not known. He was in Cambodia – then part of the French colony of Indochina – in 1926, and later claimed to have crossed over into China and experienced the horrors of the civil war period at first hand. But this, according to Anne Lijing Xu, was a fabrication; Malraux was in fact at home in France at the time, and did not first visit China until 1931. Given this, it seems well worth noting that, in the opinion of his biographer Oliver Todd, the China that he portrayed was\n\nneither true in its detail nor false overall, but it is nonetheless imaginary. Malraux cannot quite break clear of a conventional idea of China with coolies, bamboo shoots, opium smokers, destitutes, and prostitutes.”\n\nAnd exotic methods of execution? One cannot help but wonder.\n\nWhat matters, nonetheless, is that La Condition Humaine was a colossal success, winning the Prix Goncourt in 1933, and going on to sell in excess of 5 million copies. Given its very wide circulation, it seems more than plausible that Orwell read it, and that some memory of doing so might have formed the basis of his passing reference to the boiling deaths of Shanghai. Certainly no account that I have read takes this story back any further than Malraux, who published in 1933.\n\nSources\n\nBaron Rosen, Forty Years of Diplomacy (1922); Timothy Brook et al, Death By a Thousand Cuts (2008); André Malraux, La Condition Humaine (1933); Roy Rowan, Chasing the Dragon: A Veteran Journalist’s Firsthand Account of the Chinese Revolution(2004); Harold Schiffrin, Sun Yat-Sen and the Origins of the Chinese Revolution (1968); Oliver Todd, Malraux: A Life (2005); Arnold Wright, Twentieth Century Impressions of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Other Treaty Ports of China(1908); Anne Lijing Xu, The Sublime Writer and the Lure of Action: Malraux, Brecht, and Lu Xun on China and Beyond (2007).\n\n[47]\n\nQ: Did Anne of Cleves really hang the famous Holbein portrait in her castle to troll King Henry?\n\nIn honor of Broadway reopening in September (and my ticket purchase for October!!) I spent all week listening to Six: the Musical. The chorus for Anne’s song goes:\n\nYou, you said that I tricked ya\n\nCause I, I didn’t look like my profile picture\n\nToo, too bad I don’t agree\n\nSo I’m gonna hang it up for everyone to see\n\nAnd you can’t stop me\n\nCause I’m the Queen of the castle\n\nI tried some googling and couldn’t find out what happened to the portrait during that time. Is this just a fun line for the show or was the portrait actually hung in Richmond Palace?\n\nA: What a remarkably interesting question – because, oddly enough, it turns out to be extremely difficult to answer. In fact, so far as I can tell, no historian, nor art historian, has ever paid any attention to the problem of what became of Anne’s famous portrait after it was presented to Henry VIII, and before it turned up again among the possessions of a famous collector during the 1650s.\n\nBecause of this, I can’t answer your query definitively, but I can, I think, push things forward a little bit for you, and suggest at least a couple of plausible alternative ideas about what may have become of painting in this missing period. But before we move on to the answer you are looking for, we ought, I think, to begin by re-examining the idea that Hans Holbein’s famous image of Anne of Cleves played an important part in the history of the period because – as the lyrics you cite suggest – it “tricked” Henry into thinking she was far more beautiful than she was.\n\nThis certainly is a very familiar story, one that a lot of people who have no real knowledge of the Tudor period have likely heard – and if they have heard it, they’re probably also familiar with Henry’s dismayed dismissal of the woman who journeyed to England to marry him as a “fat Flanders mare”, and possibly even with the notion that Henry was so displeased with Holbein that the German master fell out of royal favour, and was never commissioned by Henry again. But none of this is actually true. Recent historiography strongly disputes the celebrated narrative, and downplays the part that Holbein’s painting played in the disaster that was Henry’s marriage to Anne. Rentha Warnicke, for example, notes that the English diplomat Nicholas Wotton, who accompanied Holbein on his journey to Cleves, and was responsible for much of the detailed negotiation of the marriage terms, considered the painting to be an accurate portrait. Moreover,\n\nwhen Henry was later divorced from Anne, he complained bitterly about his ministers’ activities, but not about the artist’s honesty or the ambassador’s efforts\n\n…. and Holbein continued to be employed as Henry’s court painter until his death in 1543.\n\nWe actually have no contemporary record of Henry’s reaction to the portrait, though we do know that he responded positively to others – when he was shown an image of Christina of Denmark, it delighted him so much he had his court musicians play all day, so he could “feast on the food of love.” And in fact, the idea that the image was inaccurate, and deliberately portrayed Anne as attractive when she was not, was not first reported until the 17th century, which is also the earliest that we hear of Anne described as a “Flanders mare” – the phrase, not even actually attributed to Henry, first appears in Gilbert Burnet’s History of the Reformation in 1679. For all these reasons, there’s no obvious reason why Anne would have responded as she does in the song lyrics, and sought out the painting to display it in her own home. In its day, it was apparently considered unremarkable, a perfectly accurate portrait of its moderately attractive subject.\n\nWith all this said, we can turn to the problematic issue of what happened to the painting after it was presented to Henry in the early autumn of 1539. It was, at this point, already technically a royal possession – the king paid Holbein an annual salary to act as his court painter, taking his yearly output of panels and vellums in exchange – though the idea that there was such a thing as a royal “collection” of paintings was not actually formalised until the first half of the 17th century. However, Chamberlain, the author of the first major critical biography of Holbein, noted as early as 1913 that, while the original was by then on display at the Louvre, in Paris,\n\nnothing is known of the painting, or how it came to find a home in France, except that it was at one time in the Earl of Arundel’s possession, and afterwards in the collection of Louis XIV.\n\nWe can trace this reference to the Earl of Arundel a little further than that, since we do also know that Holbein’s painting of Anne was among a group of portraits acquired by a French art collector named Everard Jabach during the 1650s, at a time when Arundel had been forced into exile after the execution of Charles I and found himself forced to dispose of some of his possessions to meet his debts. The most reasonable explanation of the painting’s movements from that point is that Jabach sold it on to the Sun King or his representatives, and that it thus entered the French royal collection, only to be effectively nationalised during the French Revolution. This would explain how it comes to hang in Louvre today.\n\nBut who was the 14th Earl of Arundel (1585-1646), how did he come to possess the painting, and why did he choose to dispose of it when he did? The answers to these questions turn out to take us quite a lot closer to resolving your central query, because Arundel (whose actual name was Thomas Howard) was, in fact, more than simply the 14th in a long line of Tudor and Stuart aristocrats. He was also, to quote Lionel Cox and Mary Cust, “the pioneer of art-collectors” – one of the earliest connoisseurs and, indeed, arguably the first to seek out and purchase works of art (and also sculpture and manuscripts) for their merit, and then attempt to assemble them into a coherent collection. On top of that, rather intriguingly, we also need to note that Arundel was a scion of one of the most distinguished families in England, the Howard dukes of Norfolk. He was, in fact, the great-great grandson of Thomas Howard, Third Duke, whose sister Elizabeth was the mother of another of Henry’s queens, Anne of Cleves’s predecessor Anne Boleyn.\n\nWe don’t know for certain how Arundel came by the Holbein painting that you’re interested in, but we can make some educated guesses. To begin with, he definitely looked out for works by Holbein. We know this because an inventory of his collection, drawn up shortly after his death and published in Hervey’s Life, Correspondence and Collections, lists more than 40 works by the two Holbeins, father and son. But it’s not clear whether Arundel found and purchased the portrait of Anne of Cleves, or acquired it via inheritance. Some of his collection did come from other members of his family; for example, we know that his grandfather, the 12th Earl, filled both his London home and his country estate at Nonsuch Palace, near Cheam, with pictures, other works of art, and a library which contemporaries considers to be “right worthy of remembrance”. What is almost certainly a partial inventory of this collection survives in the form of a list of works owned by the 12th Earl’s daughter, Jane, Lady Lumley, and kept by her at Lumley Castle. It makes no mention of the Cleves portrait, but this does not necessarily mean it may not have been in the family’s collection at this time, but kept at some other property – the family also owned Arundel House in London, Arundel Castle, and Welbeck Abbey, among a number of very prominent properties. And certainly the 12th Earl would have been in an excellent position to have acquired the Holbein portrait, had King Henry decided that he had no further use for it – he had served both Henry VIII and his son Edward VI as Lord Chamberlain, making him the man responsible for managing the royal household.\n\nThere is one other possible chain of transmission that might also account for the presence of the Holbein portrait in Arundel’s collection, and that is that it remained a part of the royal collection well into the 17th century, and thus came into the possession of Charles I. Charles was also a noted connoisseur of art, and he and Arundel were well known to each other; in fact, Cust tells us, they frequently “used to exchange pictures.” This seems to be another distinct lead, since the inventory of works in Arundel’s possession mentioned above, and dated to 1655, mentions not only the Cleves portrait, but another of Jane Seymour and a third, noted in the document as “Duchessa de Lorena grande del naturale,” which is actually the famous Holbein portrait of Christina of Denmark that Henry liked so much – she became, by marriage both Duchess of Lorraine and Duchess of Milan. (The Christina of Denmark painting is now in the National Gallery in London, and if you want to get a better idea of Henry VIII’s taste in women, you could do worse than take a look at it.) At least one other of Arundel’s paintings, then (the Christina), and probably at least two (that and the Seymour), had also once been in the royal collection.\n\nI would have thought that the presence of so many pictures that had once been part of the royal collection among the paintings that Arundel took into exile with him could well be explained by an exchange or series of exchanges of the sort mentioned by Cust; it’s certainly more likely that the Cleves portrait was acquired in this way than that Arundel got hold of it from some other collector. Such people did exist; the Dutch painter and early art historian Karel Van Mander (1548-1606) mentions in passing another collector of Holbeins, a turn-of-the-seventeenth century “gentleman residing near Temple Bar, in London,” who possessed a number of the painter’s works, and Cust conjectures that Arundel may have purchased this man’s collection. But even if he did, it’s far from clear how a gentleman collector, hailing from several rungs further down the social scale than an Arundel earl, might have come to have access he would have needed to the royal collection to have laid hands on the Anne of Cleves portrait.\n\nSo there you have it. Arundel owned the painting, and he may have acquired it in the form of an inheritance from his grandfather, who would have purchased it or been gifted it as a result of his service to Henry VIII. Or – more probably, in my opinion – he was given it by Charles I, who in the 1620s and 1630s exchanged numerous paintings in the royal collection with the earl because both men were noted connoisseurs of art.\n\nNeither of these possible chains of ownership runs through Anne of Cleves, and my investigation suggests that there is no reason to suppose she ever had possession of the painting made of her.\n\nSources\n\nArthur B.

In 1931 he rose to the rank of abbot, establishing his own monastery in Shanghai. All initiates were required to hand over their possessions to Abbot Chao Kung as he now called himself. He also spent time seducing nuns…. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he also made contact with the Nazis, offering to broadcast for them and to raise up all the Buddhists of the East against any remaining British influence in the area. The chief of the Gestapo in the Far East, SS Colonel Josef Meisinger, urged that this scheme receive serious attention. It was even seriously suggested that Trebitsch be allowed to accompany German agents to Tibet to implement the scheme. He proclaimed himself the new Dalai Lama after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, a move that was supported by the Japanese but rejected by the Tibetans.”\n\nA: For those who aren’t familiar with the name, Trebitsch Lincoln was quite a bit more than just a “con man”; indeed, one of the remarkable things about him, certainly at this late stage in his career, seems to have been his ability to persuade himself that the things he was doing and the things that he wanted were real. His biographer, Bernard Wasserstein – an otherwise pretty sober professor of history at Oxford – prefers the term “political adventurer,” and calls him “one of the most astounding and bizarre figures in modern history.”\n\nIn the course of a long career that began at the turn of the 20th century, Lincoln (1879-1943) – who was born into a Jewish family in Hungary – was successively a trainee actor, Presbyterian missionary in Canada, Anglican curate, British Liberal MP, bankrupt, oilman, tramp and German spy. During the First World War he served a three-year prison term in Britain for fraud; after his release, he left for Germany, where be became head of press for the very short-lived post-war government installed during the Kapp Putsch of 1920, and later a prominent member of the inter-war White International. Indicted for high treason in Vienna, Lincoln fled to China, where he became political advisor to a succession of prominent warlords. He spent the remainder of his life in Asia as an arms dealer, Buddhist abbot, and Bodhisattva, living in Shanghai under the name Chao Kung. All this, as Wasserstein observes, makes Lincoln\n\nthe only person ever to have been formally adopted by a major British political party as a parliamentary candidate while still a Hungarian citizen …[and also] the only former British MP ever to serve as a member of a German government.”\n\nAttempting to install oneself as Dalai Lama might have seemed ambitious even for a man of all these many talents, but it was certainly something that might conceivably have been in line with Lincoln’s personality and interests – Wasserstein comments that he had developed “an obsession with the idea of travelling to Tibet” as early as the 1920s. However, the source that Wiki cites for the information you are interested in is not an especially reliable one. It’s a feature published in an Australian newspaper by a former Buddhist monk turned journalist, and it appeared in April 1945, two years after Lincoln’s death and still several months before Japan’s surrender, at a a time when none of those with knowledge of what had happened was actually available for interview. As such, the Australian report seems to have relied more on rumour than anything else to label Lincoln as someone suffering from a life-long “religious mania” and suggest that\n\nWhen the Dalai Lama died, Trebitsch-Lincoln notified the Buddhist Lamas of Tibet that the old Lama had been reincarnated in him – Ignatius Timothy Trebitsch-Lincoln! The Japanese government and Buddhist hierarchy gave him an eager backing and vehemently confirmed his claim to the Dalai Lamahood. Japan began to press his claim.\n\nBut the Tibetans thought otherwise, and found their new Dalai Lama [who was, in fact, the present one, who we’re all pretty familiar with] in the person of a Chinese baby. So Trebitsch-Lincoln committed hara-kiri to save Japanese face, or, more likely, he was “happily despatched by the Japanese themselves.\n\nThere is much that is demonstrably wrong with this report. For example, the 14th Dalai Lama was not a “Chinese” baby. And Lincoln certainly did not commit suicide – though his death was in fact rather mysterious, and Wasserstein concedes it is possible he was killed by the Japanese. But it seems to be the only published report that mentions the story you are interested in at all.\n\nWasserstein’s biography of Lincoln is the the best-sourced and most carefully considered account of his life that we have, so we need to turn to him to try to discern the actual course of events. He begins by pointing out that Lincoln was living in Asia during a period of incredible disruption. There had been tension between China and Japan since the beginning of the 1930s, and full-scale war had broken out in 1937. Furthermore, the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933 was followed fairly closely by that of the second most important Tibetan leader, the Panchen Lama, in 1937, threatening the fragile internal stability of Tibet.\n\nIt was, Wasserstein relates, against this background that the British consul-general in Chungking composed a dispatch in September 1938 reporting that\n\nTrebitsch Lincoln is proceeding towards Tibet and that he claims to be, by some extraordinary metempsychosis, a reincarnation of both the Dalai and the Tashi [Panchen] Lamas.\n\nThis dispatch, then, appears to be the origin of the story that Lincoln schemed to become the Dalai Lama, but Wasserstein is quick to point out that the original informant, a “Mr Cunningham of Tatsienlu,” about whom nothing else at all is known, had apparently confused Lincoln (then definitely in Shanghai) with an American by the name of Engler who had been passing through his city. We are as certain as we can be that Lincoln himself made no attempt to reach Tibet and, in any case, the boy who would become the 14th Dalai Lama had by that point already been identified as the tulku (reincarnate custodian) of the spirit of the previous 13 holders of that office; he would be formally recognised as such in 1939.\n\nWhat, though, of the involvement of the Japanese and the Germans in the selection of the new Dalai Lama? It is certainly the case that foreign interference in the process was so commonplace by this time as to be unremarkable; China had laid claim to a major role in the selection of a successor since the 18th century. And Lincoln certainly was known to Police-Colonel Josph Meisinger, the senior Gestapo officer mentioned by Wiki. But Meisinger came onto the scene only four years after the events set out above occurred. In 1937-38 he was still in Germany, where he had charge of the Gestapo office responsible for the investigation of homosexuality and abortions; in 1939 he was in Warsaw, where he ordered the execution of 16,000 Jewish people, a crime for which Poland would execute him after the war. He was not appointed to the Far East until 1941, when he was made “police attache” at the German embassy in Tokyo, and he did not visit Shanghai until May of that year.\n\nLincoln was well known to be a charismatic and persuasive individual, and he certainly seems to have had an impact on Meisinger. He sent a telegram to Berlin urging that the German government take seriously the “plans” Lincoln had for “China, Tibet and India,” which Meisinger considered “worthy of consideration.” What these plans were, we do not know, but certainly Meisinger’s enthusiasm for Lincoln was not shared by other German officials in the Far East. The Consul-General in Japan, Martin Fischer, appended his own commentary to the telegram, pointing out that Lincoln was a “political adventurer” with no known influence in “lama circles”, and, when the message did reach Germany, there were plenty of people there with memories long enough to remember the Lincoln of the 1920s; one of these, a Foreign Office official named Martin Luther – who readers of historical fiction may recognise as an important character in Robert Harris’s famous counter-factual thriller Fatherland – wrote a strongly-worded memo pointing out that Lincoln was not only wildly unreliable, but also “by birth a Hungarian Jew”. Meisinger’s interest in Lincoln promptly cooled, and Wasserstein does not mention any connection between Lincoln and the Japanese at all.\n\nDid Lincoln proclaim himself the new Dalai Lama? We have no evidence he did so, though it would not, apparently, have been wholly out of character for him to have harboured such a dream. Did the Japanese support that candidacy, or indeed make any effort to meddle in the selection and installation of the 14th Dalai Lama? I can find nothing to suggest as much, and Japan seems to have taken very little interest in Tibet at all during this period; a single Japanese agent, Hisao Kimura, who posed as a Mongolian, is known to have spent 18 months in the country in 1940-1, but, other than that, there seems to be very little to suggest that Japan took any interest in Tibetan affairs.\n\nI note that Wiki does not include Wasserstein’s important and conspicuously well-researched book among the sources for its article on Trebitsch Lincoln; this explains why it carries such an inaccurate account. Regrettably and unfortunately, this seems to be yet another example of the need to treat the material it publishes with caution.\n\nSources\n\nDaisuke Murakami, “Japanese imaginings of Tibet: past and present,” Inner Asia 12 (2010); Ivan Orlov-Abstrebski, “Buddha threatens the Japanese,” Sydney Morning Herald, 7 April 1945; Bernard Wasserstein, The Secret Lives of Trebitsch Lincoln (New Haven, 1988); Bernard Wasserstein, “Lincoln, Ignatius Timotheus Trebitsch,” Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n\n[45]\n\nQ: According to Sir James Frazer, in his famous book The Golden Bough, Iron Age kings were regularly sacrificed after completing a fixed term as monarchs. What do we know about the kings who were supposedly sacrificed, and the people who killed them?\n\nI heard a story about sacrificial Celtic kings or “corn kings” These kings were supposedly sacrificed in times of famine or to placate their gods for food harvests. Apparently they were fed year round and treated like kings only to be sacrificed to appease the gods. Is this true? What real sources cite these kings?\n\nA: The rex nemorensis, as everyone agrees, is a very primitive figure, a remnant from the distant past, when the first settlements of Latin peoples were forming in the Alban hills and probably no more than the odd shepherd had as yet taken up residence on the Palatine [Hill, where Rome now stands]. He was a priest of Diana and a king, whatever that might have meant. He was linked to a tree that was sacred…\n\nWhen a challenger appeared, identified by his success in obtaining a bough from the sacred tree, the rex was required to fight him to the death. The victor, whether challenger or incumbent, from that moment became, or continued as, Diana’s priest and the King of the Wood. The rex was important (though we do not know precisely how) to the power of Aricia and to Aricia’s pre-eminence within that earliest alliance of Latin communities in the sixth century BCE. We know hardly anything else about his cult; and yet already what we do know far exceeds our evidence for any Italic cult outside Rome, and indeed for most cults in Rome itself.\n\nC.M.C. Green\n\nAs Carin Green reminds us, the story that you’ve heard is an old one. Very possibly, it is one of the oldest stories of all, and certainly it’s representative of a set of ideas that have been studied and discussed for more than a century. The question is: was it ever anything more than a story? Did these things happen, and, if they did, how can we be sure about both the events themselves and – much more contentiously – what they meant?\n\nThis is far from an easy problem to address. The idea that ancient kings (or proxies for them) were regularly sacrificed as part of a pre-Christian religion that sought power over the natural world and control of its fertility was once very widely believed. The idea was highly influential between around 1915 and 1970, influential enough for the concept of the blood sacrifice of monarchs to crop up in almost every popular retelling of the history of the Celtic period, and to seep out into fiction and film as well. The classic British horror film The Wicker Man (1973) is possibly the best-known example of the latter genre, but the same idea also underpinned the more recent, well-regarded Swedish film Midsommar (2019).\n\nThe problem with all this is a twofold one. The first part concerns our sources, which are scanty and late; this makes it even harder than it usually is to guess which bits of them might refer to real practices and real events. The second part is rather more unique; this particular topic, more than any other I can think of, has been promoted by writers of such eminence that their ideas became a sort of article of faith for many people, academic and lay alike. The sacrifice of kings was first written about in detail by the pioneer anthropologist James Frazer. From there, his ideas were taken up and dramatically elaborated by the very long-lived (1863-1963) Margaret Murray, who – despite starting out as an Egyptologist, and having essentially no qualifications in the field – took up Frazer’s mantle as the English-speaking world’s most famous anthropologist between his death and hers. Murray energetically promoted the concept of sacrificial kings in a series of three books written for the general public which were published between 1921 and 1954.\n\nIt was Margaret Murray who was responsible for suggesting these sacrifices were organised and carried out by the members of a multi-generational witch cult that was responsible for preserving an “old religion” that antedated Christianity, and which flourished, underground, long into the Christian period. This is an idea that I dissected here some time ago in a response that looked at the best-known of the supposed royal sacrifices written about by Murray, the death of the English king William II (William Rufus) in 1100, and it’s one that serious scholars of pagan religion, such as Ronald Hutton, have roundly dismissed. But Murray’s claims were catnip to the new generation of self-styled witches, led by Gerald Gardner, which emerged in Britain in the 1930s and 1940s and collectively founded the religion we now know as Wicca. Gardner recognised that Murray’s claims offered his brand-new faith the chance to claim continuity with an historical religion of tremendous antiquity and, apparently, considerable power – something that made the claims of Wicca and the Wiccans vastly more impressive and imposing. The result of all this was that the ideas first pioneered by Frazer have not only long outlived him; they have become a core part of the belief systems of large numbers of modern Wiccans and New Agers, who continue to spread them as widely as they can. In the age of the internet, that is pretty widely – certainly widely enough for them to have reached you.\n\nI could write at considerable length about Murray and Gardner, but really everything they said was based on the ideas that Frazer had pioneered – and their elaborations of those ideas are pretty much entirely ahistorical. So it probably makes more sense to return to The Golden Boughand discuss what Frazer’s lifetime of scary work habits turned up in terms of evidence for the reality of sacrificial kings (he was famous for reading and taking notes in several languages for anything up to 15 hours a day, seven days a week – but notorious among later generations of anthropologists for writing about the world he had never actually seen for himself; he practically never left his study).\n\nFrazer devoted most of his long life to tracing, exploring and setting them down in what became, over time, The Golden Bough (1890-1915). This 12-volume study of comparative religion has certainly been more revered than actually read, but it was a foundational influence on several generations of anthropologists; no lesser figure than Bronisław Malinowski, indeed, could write that Frazer’s masterpiece was “in many respects the greatest achievement of anthropology.” Beginning his study with a famous, and highly romanticised, retelling of the legend of the rex nemorensis – the priest-king of Nemi, a runaway slave who reigned as “king of the wood”, but only for so long as he could defeat all those who sought to challenge him in a single combat fought to the death – Frazer expanded his focus to study every aspect of what he termed “the dying god”. This involved the belief that the youth and health of a divine monarch had a direct bearing on the quantity and quality of the annual harvest, and that ritual death of such a king might be (and was) used to redress crises caused by drought and bad harvests, and so restore prosperity to a people.\n\nFrazer’s book includes discussion of the practices of Iron Age celts. According to him, their history offers numerous examples of kings who reigned for fixed periods (which might, in his original, vary from one to nine years, though seven years has become the default figure generally cited today). And, because most of the societies that took part in these practices were agrarian ones, a number of these monarchs were described in terms that made them “vegetative kings” – such as the “corn kings” you’ve encountered.\n\nFrazer made a number of influential claims in The Golden Bough, and before I go on to discuss the historicity (or otherwise) of the kings you are interested in, it’s worth touching on some of these. First, he stressed how common the theme of a god’s, or a ruler’s, sacrifice is in myth and folklore. For example, the Norse god Odin sacrifices an eye in exchange for access to the well of wisdom; and (for Frazer), Dionysius, a Greek god; Osiris, an Egyptian one; and Tammuz, a Syrian deity, can all be seen as examples or “corn kings” who, in specific myths told of them, die as part of a harvest ritual, to ensure the bountifulness of the crops. Elsewhere, Frazer suggests that the Phrygian god Attis was addressed as the “reaped green (or yellow) ear of corn”; and, most interestingly from your perspective, he devotes significant attention to the figure of Lugh, a king and magician in European mythology who is associated with the sun. The Golden Boughargues that the same figure also appears as “Lughnasad” in pre-Christian England, Ireland and Wales; ultimately, he lends his name to the pagan festival we know as Lammas. In a second important theme in the same work, Frazer argues that the divine king possessed his powers only for so long as he remained perfect and un-mutilated. He discusses some of the precautions taken to prevent this; for instance, in the medieval Welsh story-cycle we know as the Mabinogion, the divine King Math seeks to protect the perfection of his body by always sleeping with his feet in the lap of a virgin.\n\nFrazer is far from the only writer to point these things out. Joseph Campbell also thought there were associations between the concepts of birth and growth, and death and decay; human sacrifice, he argues, was intended to enhance life or stave off decay. Rosemary Sutcliff, the well-known author of historical novels, wrote one titled Mask of the Horse-Lord (1965) in which the hero is a Roman-Celtic king, Phaedrus, who ultimately decides to sacrifice himself for his people after listening (as Barbara Talcroft summarises things) to “a voice from a deeper past than that of Rome, and his solution belongs to the oldest of all traditions.” And the well-known writer and amateur scholar Robert Graves, taking Frazer as his departure-point, discussed Hercules as an exemplar of the “oak king”; according to Graves, some Iron Age monarchs, each cast in the role of Hercules, enjoyed reigns of a very brief duration, six months, after which successive kings were tied to an oak tree at midsummer and then ritually castrated, dismembered and slain, their blood being sprinkled over the people of their tribe, their body roasted and eaten at a ceremonial feast, and their head and genitals floated downriver on a boat to a sacred island; after that, supposedly, the head was sometimes cured and used for prophecy. Graves’s use of sources has been the subject of some significant criticism, and his work made little impression on the scholarly community, but it was much more impactful on a broader audience. In consequence, says Hutton, even today, Graves’s ideas about pagan Celtic monarchy “remain a major source of confusion about the ancient Celts and influences many un-scholarly views of Celtic paganism.”\n\nA final key source for this inquiry into ideas about the Celtic monarchy of this period is G.F. Dalton – like Graves an amateur rather than a professional academic scholar – who during the 1970s published several papers arguing that the Irish high kings of Tara “were killed on a particular day of the year, in a ritual manner, for religious reasons, and at the end of a fixed term of years or of some multiple of this term.” According to Dalton’s reading of Irish history, the central goddess of pre-Christian Ireland was Éire (Éiru), who was an earth-goddess identified with the land itself. She was ritually “married” to a noble mortal, the High King at Tara, and in Dalton’s view each successive Irish king’s inauguration was portrayed in poetry as essentially a marriage feast. “The object of the marriage, we may reasonably assume,” he says, “was to make the land fertile.”\n\nWith all this said, then, let’s look at the historical evidence Frazer and his followers used in an attempt to prove their case that divine kings were ritually sacrificed to bring fertility to the Iron Age Celtic kingdoms they ruled before the advent of Christianity. The examples I am going to discuss here for you come not only from the Golden Bough but from the more extensive lists offered by his followers R.A.S Macalister, in his Temair Breg (1919), and G.F. Dalton, in his papers “The ritual killing of the Irish kings” and “The tradition of blood sacrifice to the goddess Éire”. Dalton compiles these suggestions into a master-list of 14 supposedly historical Irish monarchs whose deaths might be interpreted as resulting from ritual sacrifice, all of whom supposedly died on a particularly significant day – the pagan festival of Samhain, held at the onset of winter, which we know better today as the Christians’ Hallowe’en. That total is, by the way, arguably a remarkably small one, given that the Irish annals purport to trace their Iron Age monarchy back to around 3000 BCE, and so cover in excess of 3,400 years before the advent of Christianity. It represents well under 10 percent of the Irish high kings named in those annals.\n\nExamples taken from this list include:\n\nConary Mōr (Conaire Mór), who after he become high king of Erin (supposedly some time in the first century BCE), enjoyed a reign characterised by bounteous trade, rivers abounding in fish, and plentiful acorns for the swine – what Rolleston summarises as “the fair seasons and bounteous harvests always associated in Irish minds with the reign of a good king.”\n\nTighearnmas (Tigernmas), who supposedly lived in the second millennium BCE and who, the Irish Annals of the Four Masters assures us, died “with three-fourths of the men of Ireland about him, at the meeting of Magh-Slecht, in Breifne, at the worshipping of Crom Cruach, which was the chief idol in Ireland. This happened on the night of Samhain precisely.”\n\nEochaid (Eochu Airem), who was, according to different sources, struck by lightning, or burned to death at a banquet – either by a rival tribal group, or by the fairy-folk.\n\nFergus Blacktooth (Fergus Dubdétach), who reigned for one year in the second or third centuries AD, and then was killed in a battle that took place on Samhain. According to Dalton, this ‘battle’ was a very strange affair. Fergus and his brothers were all killed on the same stone, by the same man, Lugaid Laiga, who is said to have killed seven kings. After killing these three, Lugaid was so crazy with fighting that he tried to kill his own king, Cormac, himself. But Cormac had foreseen this, and dressed his fool, Deilionn, in the royal robes, so that Lugaid killed Deilionn in mistake for Cormac. For Dalton, it is obvious that Deilionn was a mock king, who was invested with the royal robes purely in order that he might be sacrificed instead of the real king Cormac.\n\nFinally, Dalton suggests that an Irish legend, ‘The Adventures of Art son of Conn’, may be put beside these. This story concerns a wicked enchantress named Becuma, who marries a king of Ireland named Conn Cetcathach (Conn Cétchathach, Conn of the Hundred Battles – reigned later than most of the others on this list, in the 1st century AD; he was the supposed ancestor of most subsequent high kings). As a result of her depravity the crops fail, and there is a famine. The druids proposed to remedy this via a human sacrifice, the victim being a young man named Segda, who is, Dalton presumes, a substitute for the king himself. According to one version of the story: “When the druids saw the young man with Conn, this is the counsel they gave: to slay him and mingle his blood with the blighted earth and the withered trees, so that its due mast and fruit, its fish, and its produce might be in them.” The most interesting point, Dalton contends, is the detailed description given of the proposed sacrifice. The victim’s blood is to be allowed to sink into the ground. Dalton interprets this as an example of sympathetic magic – moistening the soil brings rain and revives the crops\n\nNow, looking at all this from the perspective of the historian, rather than the ethnographer or the folklorist, there seem to me to be two all-too-obvious things to point out. The first is that none of these supposed rulers is a clearly historical figure. All of them date from the period of roughly 2000 BCE up to the appearance of St Patrick in Ireland, which is typically dated to roughly the first half of the fifth century CE. This means that every one of them significantly antedates any surviving written record we have for Ireland – the Annals of the Four Masters, referred to above, for instance, was not compiled till the 1630s, though the men who wrote it drew on annals which, Irish historians believe, may have been written as early as the 550s. So even these ancient records, assuming that they actually existed, could have recorded only traditions and legends about earlier Irish kings. Really, all the people on Dalton’s list have an historicity approximately equivalent to that of King Lear, a figure who supposedly ruled “Britain” in the eighth century BCE – but whose legend was not actually written down until the twelfth century CE.\n\nThe second point to be made about the list is that none of the people on it are unambiguously described as having been ritually sacrificed to protect their people or to save them from dearth. How, we might ask, did Macalister and Dalton conclude that they were, in fact, sacrificial victims? Only because they had read Frazer and were actively looking for examples of the practices outlined in the Golden Bough. Indeed, a reading of Dalton’s papers reveals they are replete with phrases such as the “it is obvious from this that…”, the “it may have been” and the “we may reasonably assume” that I quoted above – “the answer must be largely guesswork…”; “we can conjecture…” and so on. From the historian’s point of view, these sorts of phrases sound loud warning bells, because the people who write them are not evaluating their sources as historians are supposed to – they are example-seeking, and actively going in search of “evidence” to prove a case they are already convinced of. And they ignore the existence of a number of story tropes – the sacred importance of the number seven, the portrayal of fools as sorts of mirrors of the king – that might equally explain the form of some of the old legends.\n\nTo take only the example of Eochaid Airem, who is supposed to have reigned in about 100 BCE, Dalton not only ignores the fact that he is a figure from saga, not history – one who lived in a world in which fairies were very powerful and very real, and whose main purpose was to carry out acts that advance an epic story. He also cites three different possible causes of death, not one of which is obviously recognisable as a product of the sort of ritual sacrifice described by Frazer. Moreover, Eochaid’s reign is said to have lasted for 15 years. Dalton expends some energy trying to demonstrate that this figure should actually be read to show a “real” reign of 14 years, which would be a multiple of the mystic seven years he is looking for (2 x 7). There are many, many echoes of this sort of special pleading in the literature I’ve been discussing. Thus Margaret Murray’s attempt to argue that William Rufus’s death was the product of ritual sacrifice wriggles frantically around in an attempt to account for the fact that the death took place not on the pagan festival of Lammas, but on the morning afterwards. She also insists that the king was 42 years old at the time of his death (6 x 7), when, in fact, we simply don’t know when Rufus was born, and ignores the inconvenient fact that he died not after ruling for 14 years, but after a reign of 12 years and 10 months. None of this encourages much faith in the arguments of the Golden Bough brigade.\n\nThus far, our discussion has revolved around negatives; hopefully I’ve shown there is good reason to suppose that the historical record contains little in the way of evidence to back up the idea that Iron Age Celtic kings were ritually sacrificed in extremely similar ways in the name of a religion that survived the Christianisation of Ireland and the British Isles. In concluding, though, it’s only fair to point out that some modern evidence does possibly point to the sacrifice of significant figures from these communities. This evidence is provided by some of the bog bodies recovered in Ireland over the past couple of decades, at least two of which – the remains known as Old Croghan Man and Cashel Man – potentially fit this particular bill.\n\nThese bodies are much older than most of the people we’ve discussed in this response thus far – they date to the period 2,000–1,000 BCE. But, certainly, they belong to people who, if not definitely kings, probably were prominent figures in their communities. Old Croghan Man, in particular, would have been a striking figure; he stood about six feet five inches tall, gigantic for that time, had been reared on an expensive diet that was largely meat-based, had apparently done no manual work (his fingernails were neatly manicured), and died in his prime, aged about 25. Moreover, he had apparently been ritually killed. I covered the mystery of Old Croghan man in an earlier essay, which you can read here; the relevant passage runs:\n\n“Forensic examination shows that he died hard, stabbed through a lung and then decapitated with an axe. After killing him, his executioners chopped his body in half at the diaphragm, and at some point, perhaps while he was still alive, they also inflicted two pairs of unusual wounds on him. Deep cuts almost severed both his nipples, and his arms were vigorously pierced so that twisted lengths of hazel withy could be threaded through from side to side, presumably to pinion him. “\n\nThese sorts of details can be, and have been, read as archaeological confirmation of Frazer’s anthropological speculation. The main proponent of these views, Eamon Kelly of the National Museum of Ireland, has written several papers based on these finds that argue in favour of the reality of Irish sacrificial kingship. And it’s hard to be certain that he’s not right about this.\n\nWhat can be said, though, in conclusion, is that it’s just as hard to prove that Kelly is correct. We have no written records that date back this far; and while it seems quite reasonable to suppose that Old Croghan Man was killed in some sort of ritual, we can’t definitely link that to the ideal of sacrifice to ensure good harvests, nor even be certain he was not the victim of some other set of circumstances that we simply have no record of, and hence no reference points for. Similarly, while Kelly very interestingly speculates on the reasons why only portions of many bog bodies are recovered – he argues that, after being dismembered, various parts were buried at different spots around the boundaries of their kingdoms as a form of magical protection – it is, once again, impossible to prove what remains a theory; and some of his evidence is based on exactly the sort of wriggly special pleading that Margaret Murray used to deploy, as well. Thus, we simply don’t know what boundaries Iron Age Irish kingdoms had; to make his argument, Kelly assumes they can be traced in the bounds of medieval-era Christian Irish polities that existed two to three thousand years later, which seems a considerable stretch, especially as his arguments in favour of the careful placement of the remains assume that the inhabitants of Iron Age Ireland could plot their position on the landscape with the sort of precision expected of a 21st-century orienteer.\n\nFor all this, though, the evidence of bog bodies does remain intriguing. If we’re ever to salvage Frazer and his Golden Bough ideas from their chilly academic exile, it’s likely the proofs will have to come from archaeology, not history.\n\nSources\n\nJoseph Campbell, The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology (London 1964)\n\nG.

Is this true? Read it on a Twitter thread.\n\nA: I think it’s highly likely that the claim you read was written by someone who’d heard something about Gwyn Campbell’s paper “An Industrial Experiment in Pre-colonial Africa: The Case of Imperial Madagascar, 1825-1861”, which appeared in Journal of Southern African Studies 17 (1991). If so, the writer either hadn’t read the paper very carefully, or had some reason to exaggerate the claim, because Campbell certainly doesn’t suggest anything along the lines of “Madagascar”, as a whole, being “pretty close to industrialisation” in the C19th.\n\nWhat he does do is to examine what began as an interesting experiment in cotton manufacturing carried out by the Merina empire, a polity with its main power bases the central highlands of the island. Merina was by far the most powerful of a number of states that existed on the island prior to its seizure by the French in 1894; its monarchs – Ranavalona I was the reigning queen in the period we’re interested in – were often referred to by Europeans as the kings and queens of Madagascar as a whole.\n\nAccording to Campbell, the rulers of Merina attempted an “industrial experiment” in Imerina, a central province of their kingdom, between 1825 and1861 – that is, at a time when word of the concept of industrial revolution and its possibilities had had plenty of time to reach the island. This project, Campbell says, was of considerable note, as it\n\noccurred in the precolonial era, was contemporaneous with industrial experiments in Western Europe and North America, it was a result of indigenous enterprise, and it involved large scale factory machine-based production.\n\nMadagascar did possess a number of the pre-conditions required for industrialisation. It had natural resources, including a centre for iron ore production at Miarinarivo, about 35 miles south-east of the capital at Antananarivo, and smelting at Amoronkay; in addition, two major famines in the early and mid 1700s had led to the emergence of a class of full-time rural artisans\n\nThe experiment began with the textile industry but was expanded to incorporate processing of sugar and tobacco, and eventually even arms production. It was an ambitious effort, but one that ultimately failed, so while Campbell notes that “by the mid-nineteenth century, many of the preconditions for successful industrialisation had been met,” it wasn’t the case that Madagascar came close to fully industrialising before the arrival of the French, only to be thwarted by an invading colonial power – which is, I’d suspect, the form the Twitter claim you mention, took.\n\nNonetheless, the experiment was quite a large-scale one. The major local industrial site, at Mantasoa, eventually “comprised five factories with blast furnaces, plus numerous workshops, employing 5,000 workers and producing a wide range of manufactured goods including cannon, muskets, glass, tiles, clothes and leather.” The furnaces themselves were also pretty advanced: “four feet deep and two in diameter, in which the charcoal fire was fanned by two manually operated bellows,” each capable of producing almost 50 pounds of iron in under five hours. The metal they output was used to make iron tools – spades, needles, hammers, scissors, pots and, of course, weapons.\n\nUltimately, Campbell concludes,\n\nif one accepts as one standard definition of ‘factory’ industry a single production unit employing a minimum of fourteen workers, the workshops on the iron ore fields of eastern Imerina qualified as a factory industry as early as 1817 … comprising furnaces, each of which would employ seven labourers, and two workshops containing 18 and 32 forges respectively.\n\nThere were other outputs, too, that allow us to consider all this “industrialisation” in a real sense. For example, the development of a “market system”, first organised on a permanent basis by king Andrianamboatsimarofy (1773-95), resulted, in turn, in the emergence of a “symbiotic relationship between rural industry and agriculture leading to regional specialisation”. While Imerina was the main area in which this work was going on in, moreover, it also sat at the centre of an island wide long distance trade network, in which inter-regional specialisation began to flourish. And the project also involved some impressive attempts to improve education in the region, and so develop an efficient industrial workforce – which resulted in a literacy rate of around 7% among the adult population, a significant proportion for the place and time.\n\nCampbell explores several key problems which combined to stall the Merinan project. These included lack of capital (which was largely offset by the availability of cheap manpower – Campbell notes that, in fact, about a third of the workforce were agrarian labourers transferred to the industrial sites and made to work there without pay; this resulted in high rates of desertion and some acts of industrial sabotage) and “exorbitant transport costs” caused by the almost total lack of infrastructure; there was no road network capable of shipping products to the main towns or the coast.\n\nIn the end, he writes, the major issue was the way in which the state used compulsion to develop the economy; in particular, he writes of\n\nthe long term damage this inflicted upon the Merina economy as, in the attempt to avoid the intolerably harsh régime, artisans abandoned their trade and petty farmers abandoned the land, thus undermining the rural economy, the very strength of which, at the start of the nineteenth century, had made feasible the attempt to industrialise.\n\nAll in all then, the tweets you’ve been reading do have some basis in fact. There was a conscious effort to industrialise in Madagascar. It was pursued over a relatively long term by a series of rulers. And it produced results – albeit with the help of the local slave trade and only by significant exploitation of the workforce. However, it certainly is not the case that Merina itself, much less Madagascar as a whole, was “pretty close to industrialisation” when the island was colonised. Campbell’s analysis suggests the experiment had already failed 50 years earlier, the result of a combination of inadequate infrastructure and the failure to build an export trade, increasing availability of imported industrial goods, and a significant industrial accident:\n\nIt would appear that production was never on a sufficient enough scale to meet state demand for armaments, as the court was obliged to import gunpowder from the American commercial agent Marks at Mahajanga on the west coast, and powder and muskets from Delastelle on the east coast throughout the later 1830s and 1840s.\n\nFinally, in November 1853 the Isoraka powder mills exploded, instantly killing nine workers, including Rainimanana [a British-trained factory-owner], and wounding a further 47, some of them fatally. This was followed four years later by the expulsion of Laborde [a French entrepreneur with interests in sugar processing and cigar-manufacture on the island] from the island, after which production at Mantasoa came to an abrupt end. Of the ‘foreign’ industrial techniques introduced onto the plateau only soap manufacture succeeded, spreading steadily from the mid 1830s but on a handicraft rather than factory basis.\n\nThe expulsion of foreigners like Laborde, which was not uncommon in the period 1835-57, underlines a key feature of Madagascan proto-industrialisation we have not commented on to date: it was driven from the top down, by authority in search of power, not by a diverse group of profit-seeking technocrats and merchants who enjoyed independent access to capital. This did have short-term advantages (no competition), but it also meant support for the whole project could be turned off like a switch. Royal capriciousness also had the further consequence of making Madagascar seem an unwelcoming environment for inward investment of both cash and industrial expertise. Indeed, after c.1850 the whole attitude of the local elites towards industrialisation changed, so that indigenous skilled artisans, including foreign-trained Merina, were eventually banned from working for themselves for fear the greater efficiency of their manufacturing would dent the profits of crown-owned artisanal industries.\n\nThe failure of industrialisation in Madagascar, then, owed more to local issues and to local problems and attitudes, than anything else, and it’s hard to lay it at the doors of either international competition or invading imperialists. It was a truly fascinating experiment, nonetheless, and I’m not surprised it still attracts the attention of people on Twitter.\n\n[43]\n\nQ: Is the story of the Man in the Iron Mask real? If he was, how did he get so well known, even in his contemporary time? And why was his identity concealed?\n\nA: Yes, a masked prisoner certainly was kept incarcerated in a series of French prisons between 1661 and his death in 1703. The mask most commonly associated with him was not made of iron, though – consensus suggests it was probably made of whalebone faced with velvet, and that it may only have been worn when he was likely to be seen in public, for example during a transfer between prisons. And while the man’s existence was known at the time – a contemporary gazette mentions his transfer from one prison to another in 1687 – the case owes much of its current fame to the work of Alexandre Dumas, who wrote an influential novel about the case in 1847-50 as part of the wildly popular series of books he authored about the Three Musketeers.\n\nThe real puzzle, of course, concerns the masked man’s identity. A large amount of research has been done in an attempt to solve the problem, and it has turned up a small quantity of contemporary prison records that do little but heap up more mystery. For example, the memoirs of an officer of the Bastille prison notes that a prisoner arrived in Paris who was “always masked and whose name is never pronounced.” Records of his burial suggest he was in his 50s when he died – which if true would mean that he was aged in his late teens when incarcerated, and thus hint at a motive that had more to do with who he was than what he might have done. They add that all his belongings were burned after his death. There are plenty of other details, some more plausible than others but all of them essentially folklore, to suggest that someone very senior indeed in the French state, or perhaps some state organisation, wanted to make sure that the man’s identity remained a secret. For instance, there are several accounts alleging that the walls of his cell were scraped and whitewashed after he died to ensure no messages were left on them. (Some of this work was in vain; a couple of years ago, French archivists exhumed two inventories of the prisoner’s possessions from the endless word-mine of the National Archives.) And we know that he was moved from prison to prison in order to ensure he remained under the care of Bénigne de Saint-Mars, one of the most senior of French prison governors – though not why Saint-Mars, of all those in the service, was selected for the job.\n\nMost of the speculation that has surrounded the Man in the Iron Mask suggests he was incarcerated on the order of Louis XIV. This is not implausible; French monarchs could make use of a device called a lettre de cachet to issue orders that had to be carried out without any recourse to legal process or appeal. But there’s no firm evidence that the man was specifically Louis’s prisoner. A large part of the reason that we think he was has a direct bearing on your question, because most of the earliest accounts of the Iron Mask case were the product of anti-French propaganda. For example, the Dutch used the case to try to undermine Louis’s legitimacy during the Nine Years War (1688-97), alleging that the prisoner was the former lover of the Queen Mother, and in fact the Sun King’s real father. Other pamphlets were published to suggest the prisoner was the king’s bastard half brother, or a lover of Louis’s wife. Voltaire – who picked up rumours of the prisoner’s existence when he was locked up in the Bastille briefly in 1717 – was a proponent of the theory that the prisoner was the king’s brother, and it is also to Voltaire that we owe the idea that his mask was made of iron. Dumas’ novel elaborates on this suggestion, making the prisoner Louis’s twin, and hence a direct threat to his position as king.\n\nModern historians reject these ideas and several have sought to identify a candidate who meets the most obvious criteria for the Mask – someone whose existence was an embarrassment to the state and who was likely to be recognised if seen. It’s fair to say that no-one of the necessary eminence who fits the known dates of the case has yet been identified. If we set aside the idea that the man was as young as in his late 50s when he died in 1703, and hence might have been imprisoned for what he did rather than for who he was, then a reasonable guess would be that the prisoner was involved in some potentially highly embarrassing court scandal, along the lines of the infamous Affair of the Poisons, which had the potential to gravely compromise the Crown. The longest-serving female prisoner in French history was Magdelaine (or Madelaine) Chapelain, a Parisienne fortune-teller caught up in the Poisons case, who was incarcerated for 44 years.\n\nTo probe further is really is to enter the realm of speculation. But the question that has to be asked, I think, is this: why would whatever French authorities were responsible for incarcerating this prisoner care so much about keeping this man away from other people? Who were they concerned might recognise him, and what did they think the consequences might be if he was identified, or able to speak to someone? We don’t know of any other significant examples in which prisoners’ identities were concealed in this way over quite such long periods, in quite such exceptional circumstance – though the device certainly was used on occasion when a prisoner was moved. For example, the 21 March 1695 issue of the Gazette d’Amsterdam published a story noting that “a masked prisoner, brought from Provence in a litter and closely guarded throughout the journey” had been immured in the Bastille. This, the paper noted, “leads one to believe that he is someone of importance, especially as his name is kept secret and those who brought him say it is a secret from them.” Another example is that a governor of the Bastille, François de Besmaux, kept his own wife masked and guarded in public, supposedly for fear “that someone might try to steal his money and his wife.”\n\nSo this is quite an interesting problem. In this period, which was pre-photograph and, largely, pre-newspaper, only a small handful of people, starting with the king, would have been widely recognisable to anyone. This is the main reason that the various theories that the Mask was the twin brother of Louis XIV, or some other member of the royal family, have gained so much traction. Yet serious students of the subject are agreed that there are really no more than two plausible suspects, whose identities have been deduced by close study of the French prison records of the period. The first was a Mantuan diplomat named Count Matteoli, who had accepted a vast French bribe to let the frontier fortress of Casale fall into French hands and then reneged on the agreement. In 1679, a vengeful Louis XIV had him kidnapped in Italy and smuggled back over the border to France, an act in breach of the international law of the period that might certainly help to explain why it was considered so important to conceal his identity thereafter. With that said, however, there is quite a bit of doubt as to whether Matteoli was actually incarcerated at all the same times, and in the same places, as we know that the Man in the Iron Mask was – and there is also a fair weight of evidence suggesting that the prisoner was not in fact a man of much social distinction; a letter of 1669 refers to him as “only a valet”, and indeed he was assigned to serve in that capacity to the disgraced former finance minister, Fouquet, when he was imprisoned alongside him. It is these scraps of evidence that have led a second group of writers on this subject to identify the Mask as an obscure manservant named Eustache Danger or Dauger, who actually was a valet up to his arrest in 1669. Both the most interesting recent writers on the subject, John Noone and Paul Sonnino, have no doubt that the man was Danger.\n\nThe supposition, if this latter theory is correct, is that Danger must have served someone important, and picked up some knowledge that was very compromising. No one has ever conclusively identified what this information may have been. Noone simply admits he has no definite solution, though he does point one very interesting thing – that in 1670, only shortly after the arrest of Danger, a gentleman by the name of Valcroissant, who was a friend of Fouquet’s, attempted to contact Danger in prison; we also know that Valcroissant himself was subsequently sentenced to five years in the galleys for taking a letter from Fouquet to Fouquet’s wife. On that basis, we might assume that Danger had special knowledge of some especially embarrassing detail to do with Fouquet’s fall – which involved his conviction for massive theft of state funds and created a highly embarrassing and long-remembered scandal for Louis XIV. Sonnino, for his part, tries to show that Danger was known to Cardinal Mazarin and makes the suggestion that he may have picked up some information about the misappropriation of some royal diamonds.\n\nWhat’s perhaps most interesting about all this, however, is the case Noone builds with regard not to the prisoner himself, but to his gaoler, Saint-Mars – a social climber on an epic scale who was obsessed with rank, status and (especially) the money that came with them. There are three key planks to this argument:\n\nNoone plausibly argues that, while he is remembered today chiefly as the gaoler for several decades of the Man in the Iron Mask, a large part of Saint-Mars’s contemporary prestige, and actual income, came from looking after the most high-ranking prisoners in France during his 20 years at Pignerol, and from siphoning off a significant proportion of the large sums – around 7,000 livres per prisoner per year – that he received to pay for food for them. Chief among these was Fouquet. It was having charge of Fouquet and another important prisoner, the Duc de Lauzun (who was an inconvenient suitor to France’s then-greatest heiress) that gave Saint-Mars real status, as well as real opportunities to enrich himself.\n\nHowever, Saint-Mars was in effect put out to grass in 1681, being moved from the governorship of Pignerol to that of a much more minor (and isolated) prison: Exilles, in an Alpine path on the road to Turin. He took the Mask with him as he went – certainly a sign that the prisoner was an important one and that the authorities in Paris wanted to limited the number of people to whom the man had access – but he had charge of no socially eminent prisoners at Exilles. Saint-Mars responded by lobbying the government furiously for a better appointment, and when he received one (to Sainte-Marguerite, an island off the Mediterranean coast, in 1687), he was told to move the Mask with him again. It was this move that really drew public attention to the prisoner for the first time, since it was carried out in a remarkably high-profile way. Yet, as Noone shows, no specific order was issued by Saint-Mars’s superiors to make sure that the man wore a mask as he moved to his new prison – rather, there was simply an order to stop him from speaking to anybody who might encounter the party as it made its way from prison to prison. The authorities, then, cared only about what the man knew, not who he was or who might conceivably recognise him.\n\nOn this basis, the person responsible for the insistence that the prisoner was exotically masked (he made the 11-day journey in a sedan chair, wearing a specially-constructed steel mask so heavy and so restrictive that it left him quite ill) must have been Saint-Mars himself. Noone persuasively suggests that this “precaution” was probably taken to give the impression that Saint-Mars himself must be a man of great consequence to be was entrusted with looking after such a remarkable prisoner – that is, it was a piece of theatre designed to impress the people of the local area, the garrison at Sainte-Marguerite, and, most of all, to remind his bosses in Paris that he was the sort of man who could and should be entrusted with looking after any other prisoners of Fouquet’s eminence that the state might wish to incarcerate.\n\nNoone offers quite a bit of circumstantial evidence to support his theory. Certainly Saint-Mars put some effort into constructing two “high-security suites” at Sainte Marguerite. One was assigned to the masked prisoner, but the other, large enough and secure enough to contain even the most eminent of prisoners, was never actually used in its intended role – so there seems to be good evidence the governor was doing what he could to put himself in line to be placed in charge of any future prisoners of eminence. And, certainly, the route that Saint-Mars chose to take between Exiles and Sainte-Marguerite was very public and high-profile – hardly the best way to make a discreet transfer of a prisoner the government didn’t want anybody thinking about. Saint-Mars, Noone says, might equally have chosen to proceed by more discreet back roads; this was a deliberate decision. So we can only suppose, he adds, that Saint-Mars positively wanted people to know something remarkable was going on, and to wonder who this incredible prisoner must be:\n\n“If hiding his face had indeed been necessary, then a sack pulled over his head would have done the job just as well… The idea of masking the prisoner was a ploy thought up by Saint-Mars to advertise the supposed secret of his prisoner’s identity, and he chose to do it in such a theatrical way because he knew a steel mask would have a greater impact on those who saw it than would a normal mask… Saint-Mars conducted his campaign with all the flash and flair of a modern promoter.”\n\nReally, I think that all of this suggests that the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask has some interesting similarities to the 130-year old controversy over the identity of Jack the Ripper. Everything we know about sex crimes and serial murder suggests that the Ripper was very probably some deeply unpleasant and inadequate nobody, but his killings were so hideous and extraordinary that many of the writers on the case have presumed that he himself must also have been extraordinary. Combine this with the commercial pressure to sell books, and you get the long line of “Ripper” books suggesting that the murderer was a member of the royal family, or Queen Victoria’s surgeon, and so on and on. It is the same with the Mask: more people are going to want to buy and read a book arguing that he was a disinherited twin brother of Louis XIV than will be interested in reading about a manservant who had stumbled across some salient detail of what is, for most people, a very long-forgotten financial scandal.\n\nSources\n\nRupert Gould, The Stargazer Talks (1946); John Noone, The Man Behind the Iron Mask (1988); Paul Sonnino, The Search for the Man in the Iron Mask (2016)\n\n[42]\n\nQ: I live in London in 1670, I have up to date fire insurance and a fire mark for my insurer, a fire has just broken out. How do I tell my insurer I need their fire brigade? What happens if there are multiple fires and all the services are being used?\n\nThis is certainly an interesting question, and it’s actually one that’s not especially straightforward to answer. To begin with, while it’s true that the early modern English fire insurance system has been well-studied, not least by Trebilcock and Pearson, its chroniclers have always been economic historians who were a lot more interested in the economic aspects of the insurance business than in the practicalities of what one would do if, having taken out insurance, either you or your neighbours suffered an actual fire.\n\nThis problem has been further exacerbated by the many popular sources available online, most of which seem very taken by the comic opportunities apparently presented by the system that prevailed in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the creation of the first proper metropolitan fire service in London in 1833. This 150+-year period saw much London firefighting effectively privatised and left in the hands of rival fire insurance companies, each of which maintained its own small fire-fighting service. You don’t have to look too far online to find sources (including the one maintained by the current London fire brigade) that suggest that these competing groups of fire-fighters would simply refuse to tackle blazes in properties that didn’t happen to be insured by them, and that, on occasion, several different crews of professional firemen would simply stand back and watch while fire ran out of control, intervening only if it reached a property that was actually insured by them. Similarly, it’s pretty regularly asserted that, if you happened to own an insured home and a blaze broke out in a property owned by an uninsured neighbour, it was no use summoning your private fire brigade to tackle that blaze and so protect your own property. They would only go into action when your home actually caught fire.\n\nThe reality was rather different. The Great Fire left a very deep imprint on the collective memories of Londoners. It had been hideously destructive, obliterating around 13,000 homes, 87 churches (including St Paul’s cathedral), 52 guild halls and Newgate Prison as it raged, and it left about a fifth of the city’s population homeless. The result, as London historian Jerry White points out, was that an “understandable paranoia” about fire prevailed among the people of succeeding generations, and that fire remained “one of the great anxieties of the age”. It was simply inconceivable, in such circumstances, that Londoners of any sort would simply allow a fire to rage unchecked, no matter what the financial situation that prevailed, and in fact the evidence rather strongly suggests that the image of private fire-fighters standing idly by while a blaze got seriously out of hand simply never actually happened.\n\nLet’s begin this response at the beginning, though. Your presumption that you would be able to insure your London property adequately against fire so early as 1670 is incorrect.
