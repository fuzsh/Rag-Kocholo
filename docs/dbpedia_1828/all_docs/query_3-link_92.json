        "text": "Early Tudor England (1485–1535) was a polity and society built around the taking of oaths. Every adult from the monarch downwards swore oaths. Henry VIII took a keen interest in his coronation oath: he had it, he said, ‘in remembraunce’ when invoking his duty to administer justice in 1516.Footnote 1 Treaties with other princes were made binding through religious rituals of reciprocal oath-taking with foreign ambassadors, which were afterwards authenticated as transumpts at the archbishop's command by public notaries.Footnote 2 The king's subjects took oaths of allegiance, to which could be added a requirement not to become the sworn retainers of anyone else.Footnote 3 Upon assumption of office, royal servants took oaths of duty. Cardinal Wolsey swore the chancellor's oath on Christmas Eve 1515 after vespers in the chapel at Eltham Palace.Footnote 4 Such oaths were tailored to the position held: the one taken by the sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire added an undertaking to defend the privileges of Cambridge University.Footnote 5 It was not only the crown which exacted oaths: the practice was universal. Oaths promised the obedience of a citizen to the mayor, a tradesman to the masters of his company, a stipendiary priest to the parson and a monk to his abbot. A livery company could have sixteen different oaths.Footnote 6 Furnishing such texts stimulated record-keeping, and oaths abound in the surviving books that belonged to government departments, urban corporations and private individuals.\n\nOaths were categorized either as affirmations (of a fact, as in testimony to a court) or as promises (of future performance, such as payment of a debt).Footnote 7 They were an inescapable aspect of the mundane activities of buying and selling, family life, domestic and local government and law enforcement. They were a fundamental facet of the economy, essential in a commercial system that depended on trust. Alleging that someone ‘woll pay no man his deutye’ was thus interpreted as an accusation of habitual oath-breaking.Footnote 8 Oaths were integral to the different legal systems that operated within the kingdom too. Social and public life depended on oath-taking. A fishmonger who had ‘made a vowe to make no maner Othe Duryng his lyff’ (perhaps deliberately) rendered himself incapable of holding office and thereby transgressed his obligations to his community.Footnote 9 Because they were sworn at major moments in an individual's life – entering service, becoming free of one's hometown, joining a guild – oaths must have constituted rites of passage. Recourse was had to oaths in informal and spontaneous contexts as well. When threatened with the stocks, a servant who had ‘meddyld’ with a female counterpart said that he would marry her if their master would take an oath that ‘she is a good mayde save for me’, which the master instantly did, swearing ‘so helpe me god and halydome and by this boke’.Footnote 10\n\nEarly Tudor England functioned the way it did because of oaths. Yet the very extensiveness of swearing routinized the practice, potentially transforming it into an act undertaken casually or even falsely. Pervasive oath-taking entailed frequent oath-breaking. Circumstance, perception and pressure must have dictated whether oaths were treated as urgent and burdensome or as formulaic and vacuous. In 1516, the government's attempted reform of sheriffs’ conduct focused on getting them to implement the contents of their oaths.Footnote 11 Kings were notorious for breaking oaths made to other princes. In Utopia, Thomas More observed sarcastically how ‘[i]n Europe, of course, and especially in these regions where the Christian faith and religion prevail, the dignity of treaties is everywhere kept sacred and inviolable.’Footnote 12 Subjects sometimes behaved no better than their rulers. At the beginning of Henry VII's reign, the judges were debating how to alleviate disorder. The idea of peers taking an oath to uphold the law seemed pointless to Chief Justice Hussey, who recalled how on a previous occasion he had seen lords take a similar oath which they had then broken within the hour.Footnote 13\n\nBut forswearing was not taken lightly. Offenders could be disgraced, punished or ostracized. In 1511, among the villagers of Littlebury in Essex, John Parkyn was ‘defamed, held and reputed’ to be a perjurer because he had given false evidence under oath against the parson; as a result, some parishioners there shunned Parkyn's company.Footnote 14 To be called ‘perjured’ was seriously insulting; it could be a defamation worth suing over.Footnote 15 People of good conversation, credit and substance were thought unlikely to lie under oath; conversely, that a couple got so drunk that they could hardly stagger home indicated a predisposition to perjury in the mind of a neighbour.Footnote 16 In short, this was an age which saw oaths as assuring diligence, fidelity and truthfulness, yet also recognized that they were regularly broken. Perjury was thus an important concept in early Tudor England, where social practice, religious doctrine and legal structure intersected.\n\nEarly Tudor England also changed perjury. Conventionally, scholarship on early modern oath-taking and oath-breaking starts where this article stops: at the break with Rome. The succession and supremacy oaths of 1534 onwards usually constitute the point of departure and so subsequent developments are related to the Reformation.Footnote 17 The state's increasing imposition of oaths thereafter is sometimes thought to have been counterproductive, to have stimulated dissimulation and equivocation, maybe even to have assisted in a societal shift from credulity to cynicism.Footnote 18 The early modern period is also held to have exalted the autonomy of the lone conscience: ‘the Reformation transformed an understanding of conscience as objective in nature, subject to the dictates of the Church, to subjective, as individuals had to rely on their own understanding of how to behave morally … cast adrift from an obvious institutional framework’.Footnote 19 Yet the early Tudor half-century had already altered the structure within which oaths were enforced. In 1485, church courts had exercised an extensive cognizance of perjury; by 1535, they no longer did. Obviously, the Reformation cannot explain this decline; nor, given the chronology of developments, can the break with Rome."
