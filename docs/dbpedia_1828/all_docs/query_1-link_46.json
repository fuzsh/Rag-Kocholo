        "text": "Descendants of King John \"Lackland\" of England (1167-1216)\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. KingJohn \"Lackland\" of England,1 2 son of Henry II \"Curtmantel\" King of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, was born 24 Dec 1166 or 1167 in Beaumont Palace, Oxford, England, died on 19 Oct 1216 in Newark Castle, Lincolnshire, England at age 49, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral, Worcester, Worcestershire, England. Other names for John were John King of England, and John \"Lackland\" King of England.\n\nResearch Notes: Source: Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America before 1700 by Frederick Lewis Weis and Walter Lee Sheppard, Jr, ed. by William R. Beall & Kaleen E. Beall, Baltimore, 2008, Line 29A-26 has b. Oxford, 24 Dec. 1167, d. Newark, 19 Oct. 1216. Line 1-25 has b. Oxford, 24 Dec. 1166/7\n\nFrom Wikipedia - John of England :\n\nJohn (24 December 1166 - 19 October 1216 [1]) reigned as King of England from 6 April 1199 , until his death. He succeeded to the throne as the younger brother of King Richard I (known in later times as \"Richard the Lionheart\"). John acquired the nicknames of \"Lackland\" (French : Sans Terre) for his lack of an inheritance as the youngest son and for his loss of territory to France , and of \"Soft-sword\" for his alleged military ineptitude.[2] He was a Plantagenet or Angevin king.\n\nApart from entering popular legend as the enemy of the fictional Robin Hood , he is also known for acquiescing to the nobility and signing Magna Carta , a document that limited his power and that is popularly regarded as an early first step in the evolution of modern democracy .\n\nBorn at Beaumont Palace , Oxford , John was the fifth son and last of eight children born to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine . He was almost certainly born in 1166 instead of 1167, as is sometimes claimed.[3]\n\nHe was a younger maternal half-brother of Marie de Champagne and Alix of France , his mother's children by her first marriage to Louis VII of France , which was later annulled. He was a younger brother of William, Count of Poitiers ; Henry the Young King ; Matilda, Duchess of Saxony ; Richard I of England ; Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany ; Leonora, Queen of Castile ; and Joan, Queen of Sicily\n\nEarly life\n\nWhile John was his father's favourite son, as the youngest he could expect no inheritance . His family life was tumultuous, as his older brothers all became involved in repeated rebellions against Henry . Eleanor was imprisoned by Henry in 1173, when John was a small boy.\n\nAs a child, John was betrothed to Alys (pronounced 'Alice'), daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy . It was hoped that by this marriage the Angevin dynasty would extend its influence beyond the Alps , because John was promised the inheritance of Savoy , the Piemonte , Maurienne , and the other possessions of Count Humbert. King Henry promised his young son castles in Normandy which had been previously promised to his brother Geoffrey, which was for some time a bone of contention between King Henry and his son Geoffrey. Alys made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry's court, but she died before being married.\n\nGerald of Wales relates that King Henry had a curious painting in a chamber of Winchester Castle , depicting an eagle being attacked by three of its chicks, while a fourth chick crouched, waiting for its chance to strike. When asked the meaning of this picture, King Henry said:\n\nThe four young ones of the eagle are my four sons, who will not cease persecuting me even unto death. And the youngest, whom I now embrace with such tender affection, will someday afflict me more grievously and perilously than all the others.\n\nBefore his accession, John had already acquired a reputation for treachery, having conspired sometimes with and sometimes against his elder brothers, Henry, Richard and Geoffrey. In 1184, John and Richard both claimed that they were the rightful heir to Aquitaine, one of many unfriendly encounters between the two. In 1185, John became the ruler of Ireland , whose people grew to despise him, causing John to leave after only eight months...\n\nDeath\n\nRetreating from the French invasion, John took a safe route around the marshy area of the Wash to avoid the rebel held area of East Anglia . His slow baggage train (including the Crown Jewels ), however, took a direct route across it and was lost to the unexpected incoming tide. This dealt John a terrible blow, which affected his health and state of mind. Succumbing to dysentery and moving from place to place, he stayed one night at Sleaford Castle before dying on 18 October (or possibly 19 October ) 1216 , at Newark Castle (then in Lincolnshire , now on Nottinghamshire 's border with that county). Numerous, possibly fictitious, accounts circulated soon after his death that he had been killed by poisoned ale, poisoned plums or a \"surfeit of peaches\".\n\nHe was buried in Worcester Cathedral in the city of Worcester .\n\nHis nine-year-old son succeeded him and became King Henry III of England (1216-72), and although Louis continued to claim the English throne, the barons switched their allegiance to the new king, forcing Louis to give up his claim and sign the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217.\n\nLegacy\n\nKing John's reign has been traditionally characterised as one of the most disastrous in English history: it began with defeats-he lost Normandy to Philip Augustus of France in his first five years on the throne-and ended with England torn by civil war and himself on the verge of being forced out of power. In 1213, he made England a papal fief to resolve a conflict with the Roman Catholic Church , and his rebellious barons forced him to sign Magna Carta in 1215, the act for which he is best remembered...\n\nMarriage and issue\n\nIn 1189, John was married to Isabel of Gloucester , daughter and heiress of William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester (she is given several alternative names by history, including Avisa, Hawise, Joan, and Eleanor). They had no children, and John had their marriage annulled on the grounds of consanguinity , some time before or shortly after his accession to the throne, which took place on 6 April 1199 , and she was never acknowledged as queen. (She then married Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex as her second husband and Hubert de Burgh as her third).\n\nJohn remarried, on 24 August 1200 , Isabella of Angoulême , who was twenty years his junior. She was the daughter of Aymer Taillefer , Count of Angouleme. John had kidnapped her from her fiancé, Hugh X of Lusignan .\n\nIsabella bore five children:\n\nHenry III (1207-1272), King of England.\n\nRichard (1209-1272), 1st Earl of Cornwall.\n\nJoan (1210-1238), Queen Consort of Alexander II of Scotland .\n\nIsabella (1214-1241), Consort of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor .\n\nEleanor (1215-1275), who married William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke , and later married Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester .\n\nJohn is given a great taste for lechery by the chroniclers of his age, and even allowing some embellishment, he did have many illegitimate children. Matthew Paris accuses him of being envious of many of his barons and kinsfolk, and seducing their more attractive daughters and sisters. Roger of Wendover describes an incident that occurred when John became enamoured of Margaret, the wife of Eustace de Vesci and an illegitimate daughter of King William I of Scotland . Eustace substituted a prostitute in her place when the king came to Margaret's bed in the dark of night; the next morning, when John boasted to Vesci of how good his wife was in bed, Vesci confessed and fled.\n\nJohn had the following illegitimate children:\n\nJoan, Lady of Wales , the wife of Prince Llywelyn Fawr of Wales , (by a woman named Clemence)\n\nRichard Fitz Roy , (by his cousin, Adela, daughter of his uncle Hamelin de Warenne )\n\nOliver FitzRoy, (by a mistress named Hawise) who accompanied the papal legate Pelayo to Damietta in 1218, and never returned.\n\nBy an unknown mistress (or mistresses) John fathered:\n\nGeoffrey FitzRoy, who went on expedition to Poitou in 1205 and died there.\n\nJohn FitzRoy, a clerk in 1201.\n\nHenry FitzRoy, who died in 1245.\n\nOsbert Gifford, who was given lands in Oxfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk , and Sussex , and is last seen alive in 1216.\n\nEudes FitzRoy, who accompanied his half-brother Richard on Crusade and died in the Holy Land in 1241.\n\nBartholomew FitzRoy, a member of the order of Friars Preachers .\n\nMaud FitzRoy, Abbess of Barking , who died in 1252.\n\nIsabel FitzRoy, wife of Richard Fitz Ives .\n\nPhilip FitzRoy, found living in 1263.\n\n(The surname of FitzRoy is Norman-French for son of the king.)\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n Crowned: King of England, 1199.

Mediaeval English monarchs did not use numbers after their names, and his contemporaries knew him as Henry of Winchester. He was the first child king in England since the reign of Ethelred the Unready . Despite his long reign, his personal accomplishments were slim and he was a political and military failure. England, however, prospered during his century and his greatest monument is Westminster , which he made the seat of his government and where he expanded the abbey as a shrine to Edward the Confessor .\n\nHe assumed the crown under the regency of the popular William Marshal , but the England he inherited had undergone several drastic changes in the reign of his father. He spent much of his reign fighting the barons over the Magna Carta [citation needed ] and the royal rights, and was eventually forced to call the first \"parliament \" in 1264. He was also unsuccessful on the Continent, where he endeavoured to re-establish English control over Normandy , Anjou , and Aquitaine .\n\nCoronation\n\nHenry III was born in 1207 at Winchester Castle . He was the son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême . After his father's death in 1216, Henry, who was nine at the time, was hastily crowned in Gloucester Cathedral ; he was the first child monarch since the Norman invasion of England in 1066. The coronation was a simple affair, attended by only a handful of noblemen and three bishops. None of his father's executors was present, and in the absence of a crown a simple golden band was placed on the young boy's head, not by the Archbishop of Canterbury (who was at this time supporting Prince Louis of France , the newly-proclaimed king of England) but rather by the Bishop of Gloucester . In 1220, a second coronation was ordered by Pope Honorius III who did not consider that the first had been carried out in accordance with church rites. This occurred on 17 May 1220 in Westminster Abbey .[1]\n\nUnder John's rule, the barons had supported an invasion by Prince Louis because they disliked the way that John had ruled the country. However, they quickly saw that the young prince was a safer option. Henry's regents immediately declared their intention to rule by Magna Carta , which they proceeded to do during Henry's minority. Magna Carta was reissued in 1217 as a sign of goodwill to the barons and the country was ruled by regents until 1227...\n\nDeath\n\nHenry's reign ended when he died in 1272, after which he was succeeded by his son, Edward I . His body was laid, temporarily, in the tomb of Edward the Confessor while his own sarcophagus was constructed in Westminster Abbey ...\n\nMarriage and children\n\nMarried on 14 January 1236 , Canterbury Cathedral , Canterbury , Kent , to Eleanor of Provence , with at least five children born:\n\nEdward I (b. 17 January 1239 - d. 8 July 1307 )\n\nMargaret (b. 29 September 1240 - d. 26 February 1275 ), married King Alexander III of Scotland\n\nBeatrice (b. 25 June 1242 - d. 24 March 1275 ), married to John II, Duke of Brittany\n\nEdmund (16 January 1245 - d. 5 June 1296 )\n\nKatharine (b. 25 November 1253 - d. 3 May 1257 ), deafness was discovered at age 2.

Llywelyn had a strong claim to be the legitimate ruler and began a campaign to win power at an early age. He was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200, and made a treaty with King John of England the same year. Llywelyn's relations with John remained good for the next ten years. He married John's illegitimate daughter Joan , also known as Joanna, in 1205, and when John arrested Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys in 1208 Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys. In 1210 relations deteriorated and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all his lands east of the River Conwy, but was able to recover these lands the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign Magna Carta in 1215. By 1216 he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at Aberdyfi that year to apportion lands to the other princes...\n\nChildren\n\nThe identity of the mother of some of Llywelyn's children is uncertain. He was survived by nine children, two legitimate, one probably legitimate and six illegitimate. Elen ferch Llywelyn (c.1207-1253), his only certainly legitimate daughter, first married John de Scotia, Earl of Chester. This marriage was childless, and after John's death Elen married Sir Robert de Quincy , the brother of Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester . Llywelyn's only legitimate son, Dafydd ap Llywelyn (c.1208-1246), married Isabella de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, 10th Baron Abergavenny , Lord of Abergavenny. William was the son of Reginald de Braose , who married another of Llywelyn's daughters. Dafydd and Isabella may have had one child together, Helen of Wales (1246-1295), but the marriage failed to produce a male heir.\n\nAnother daughter, Gwladus Ddu (c.1206-1251), was probably legitimate. Adam of Usk states that she was a legitimate daughter by Joan, although some sources claim that her mother was Llywelyn's mistress, Tangwystl Goch.[64] She first married Reginald de Braose of Brecon and Abergavenny, but had no children by him. After Reginald's death she married Ralph de Mortimer of Wigmore and had several sons.\n\nThe mother of most of Llywelyn's illegitimate children is known or assumed to have been Llywelyn's mistress, Tangwystl Goch (c.1168-1198). Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c.1196-1244) was Llywelyn's eldest son and is known to be the son of Tangwystl. He married Senena, daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey . Their four sons included Llywelyn ap Gruffydd , who for a period occupied a position in Wales comparable to that of his grandfather, and Dafydd ap Gruffydd who ruled Gwynedd briefly after his brother's death. Llywelyn had another son, Tegwared ap Llywelyn, by a woman known only as Crysten.\n\nMarared ferch Llywelyn (c.1198-after 1263) married John de Braose of Gower, a nephew of Reginald de Braose, and after his death married Walter Clifford of Bronllys and Clifford. Other illegitimate daughters were Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn, who married William de Lacey, and Angharad ferch Llywelyn, who married Maelgwn Fychan. Susanna ferch Llywelyn was sent to England as a hostage in 1228, but no further details are known.\"\n\nJoan married Llywelyn the Great Prince of Gwynedd in 1205, son of Iorwerth Drwyndwn ap Owain Gwynedd Prince of North Wales and Marared ferch Madog ap Maredudd. Llywelyn was born about 1173 in <Dolwyddelan>, Wales, died on 11 Apr 1240 in Cistercian Abbey of Aberconwy, Wales about age 67, and was buried in Llanrwst Parish Church, Wales.

Other names for Edward were Edward I \"Hammer of the Scots, and\" Edward I \"Longshanks\" King of England.\n\nResearch Notes: From Wikipedia - Edward I of England :\n\nEdward I (17 June 1239 - 7 July 1307 ), popularly known as Longshanks[1], also as \"Edward the Lawgiver\" or \"the English Justinian\" because of his legal reforms, and as \"Hammer of the Scots\",[2] achieved fame as the monarch who conquered Wales and tried (but failed) to do the same to Scotland . He reigned from 1272 to 1307, ascending the throne of England on 20 November 1272 after the death of his father, King Henry III . His mother was queen consort Eleanor of Provence .\n\nAs regnal post-nominal numbers were a Norman (as opposed to English) custom, Edward Longshanks is known as Edward I, even though he is the fourth King Edward, following Edward the Elder , Edward the Martyr , and Edward the Confessor ....\n\nChildhood and marriage to Eleanor\n\nEdward was born at the Palace of Westminster on the evening of 17 June 1239 .[3] He was an older brother of Beatrice of England , Margaret of England and Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster . He was named after Edward the Confessor . [4] From 1239 to 1246 Edward was in the care of Hugh Giffard (the son of Godfrey Giffard ) and his wife, Sybil, who had been one of the midwives at Edward's birth. On Giffard's death in 1246, Bartholomew Pecche took over. Early grants of land to Edward included Gascony , but Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester had been appointed by Henry to seven years as royal lieutenant in Gascony in 1248, a year before the grant to Edward, so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from the province.\n\nEdward's first marriage (age 15) was arranged in 1254 by his father and Alfonso X of Castile . Alfonso had insisted that Edward receive grants of land worth 15,000 marks a year and also asked to knight him; Henry had already planned a knighthood ceremony for Edward but conceded. Edward crossed the Channel in June, and was knighted by Alfonso and married to Eleanor of Castile (age 13) on 1 November 1254 in the monastery of Las Huelgas .\n\nEleanor and Edward would go on to have sixteen children, and her death in 1290 affected Edward deeply. He displayed his grief by erecting the Eleanor crosses , one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night. His second marriage, (age 60) at Canterbury on September 10 , 1299 , to Marguerite of France , (age 17) (known as the \"Pearl of France\" by her English subjects), the daughter of King Philip III of France (Phillip the Bold) and Maria of Brabant , produced three children...\n\nWelsh Wars\n\nEdward I depicted in Cassell's History of England (1902 )\n\nOne of King Edward's early moves was the conquest of Wales . Under the 1267 Treaty of Montgomery , Llywelyn ap Gruffydd had extended Welsh territories southwards into what had been the lands of the English Marcher Lords , and gained the title of Prince of Wales although he still owed homage to the English monarch as overlord. King Edward refused to recognize this Treaty - which had been concluded by his father - and in 1275, pirates in King Edward's pay intercepted a ship carrying Eleanor de Montfort , Simon de Montfort's only daughter, from France to Wales , where she expected to marry Llywelyn. Edward then imprisoned her at Windsor . After Llywelyn repeatedly refused to pay homage to Edward in 1274-1275, Edward raised an army and launched his first campaign against the Welsh prince in 1276-1277. After this campaign, Llywelyn was forced to pay homage to Edward and was stripped of all but a rump of territory in Gwynedd . But Edward allowed Llywelyn to retain the title of Prince of Wales , and the marriage with Eleanor de Montfort went ahead.\n\nLlywelyn's younger brother, Dafydd (who had briefly been an ally of the English) started another rebellion in 1282. But Edward quickly destroyed the remnants of resistance, capturing, brutally torturing, and executing Dafydd in the following year. To consolidate his conquest, he commenced the construction of a string of massive stone castles encircling the principality, of which Caernarfon Castle provides a notable surviving example.\n\nWales became incorporated into England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, and in 1301, Edward dubbed his eldest son Edward first Prince of Wales , since which time the eldest son of most English monarchs have borne the same title, the only exception being Edward III .\n\nScottish Wars\n\nHommage of Edward I (kneeling), to the Philippe le Bel (seated). As Duke of Aquitaine , Edward was a vassal to the French king.\n\nEdward then turned his attentions to Scotland. He had planned to marry off his son and heir Edward , to the heiress Margaret, the Maid of Norway , but when Margaret died with no clear successor, the Scottish Guardians invited Edward's arbitration, to prevent the country from descending into dynastic war. Before the process got underway Edward insisted that he be recognized as Lord Paramount of Scotland, the feudal superior of the realm and, after some initial resistance, this precondition was finally accepted.\n\nEdward presided over a feudal court held at the castle of Berwick-upon-Tweed in November 1292, where judgment was given in favour of John Balliol over other candidates . Balliol was chosen as the candidate with the strongest claim in feudal law, but Edward subsequently used the concessions he had gained to undermine the authority of the new king even summoning Balliol to do homage to him in Westminster in 1293. Edward also made it clear he expected John's military and financial support against France. This was too much for Balliol, who concluded a pact with France and prepared an army to invade England.\n\nIn response Edward gathered his largest army yet (25,000) and razed Berwick , massacring almost the whole population of 11,000 inhabitants. During the Scottish campaign, he made extensive use of a large trebuchet called the Warwolf .\n\nAfter Berwick, he proceeded to Dunbar and Edinburgh , also removing the Stone of Destiny from Perth to Westminster Abbey. Balliol renounced the crown and was imprisoned in the Tower of London for three years before withdrawing to his estates in France. All freeholders in Scotland were required to swear an oath of homage to Edward, and he ruled Scotland like a province through English viceroys .\n\nOpposition sprang up (see Wars of Scottish Independence ), and Edward executed the focus of discontent, William Wallace , on 23 August 1305 , having earlier defeated him at the Battle of Falkirk (1298) .\n\nEdward was known to be fond of falconry and horse riding . The names of his horses have survived: Lyard, his war horse; Ferrault his hunting horse; and his favourite, Bayard. At the Siege of Berwick, Edward is said to have led the assault personally, using Bayard to leap over the earthen defences of the city.\n\nLater career and death\n\nEdward's later life was fraught with difficulty, as he lost his beloved first wife Eleanor and his heir failed to develop the expected kingly character.\n\nEdward's plan to conquer Scotland never came to fruition during his lifetime, however, as he died in 1307 at Burgh-by-Sands , Cumberland on the Scottish border, while on his way to wage another campaign against the Scots under the leadership of Robert the Bruce . According to chroniclers, Edward desired to have his bones carried on Scottish military campaigns, and that his heart be taken to the Holy Land. Against his wishes, Edward was buried in Westminster Abbey in a plain black marble tomb, which in later years was painted with the words Scottorum malleus, Latin for Hammer of the Scots.[7] He was buried in a lead casket wishing to be moved to the usual regal gold casket only when Scotland was fully conquered and part of the Kingdom of England.\n\nOn 2 January 1774 , the Society of Antiquaries opened the coffin and discovered that his body had been perfectly preserved for 467 years. His body was measured to be 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm).[8]\n\nTo this day he still lies in the lead casket - although the thrones of Scotland and England were united in 1603 following the death of Elizabeth I and the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne, and the Kingdom of Great Britain was created in 1707 by the Acts of Union 1707 , uniting Scotland and England in an incorporating union, the conquest Edward envisaged was never completed. His son, King Edward II of England , succeeded him...\n\nIssue\n\nChildren of Edward and Eleanor:\n\nEleanor , born ca. 17 June 1264 (or possibly as late as 1269, although the issue rolls of 1302 describe her as Edward's eldest daughter) and died 12 October 1298 .

Nevertheless, by 1275, when a proxy marriage took place, there was no political advantage to the union, for the opposition movement which her father had led was moribund. The king of England took the view that the marriage was a plot to rekindle dissension within his kingdom, and such a notion may also have been present in Llywelyn's mind.

Llywelyn had a strong claim to be the legitimate ruler and began a campaign to win power at an early age. He was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200, and made a treaty with King John of England the same year. Llywelyn's relations with John remained good for the next ten years. He married John's illegitimate daughter Joan , also known as Joanna, in 1205, and when John arrested Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys in 1208 Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys. In 1210 relations deteriorated and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all his lands east of the River Conwy, but was able to recover these lands the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign Magna Carta in 1215. By 1216 he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at Aberdyfi that year to apportion lands to the other princes...\n\nChildren\n\nThe identity of the mother of some of Llywelyn's children is uncertain. He was survived by nine children, two legitimate, one probably legitimate and six illegitimate. Elen ferch Llywelyn (c.1207-1253), his only certainly legitimate daughter, first married John de Scotia, Earl of Chester. This marriage was childless, and after John's death Elen married Sir Robert de Quincy , the brother of Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester . Llywelyn's only legitimate son, Dafydd ap Llywelyn (c.1208-1246), married Isabella de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, 10th Baron Abergavenny , Lord of Abergavenny. William was the son of Reginald de Braose , who married another of Llywelyn's daughters. Dafydd and Isabella may have had one child together, Helen of Wales (1246-1295), but the marriage failed to produce a male heir.\n\nAnother daughter, Gwladus Ddu (c.1206-1251), was probably legitimate. Adam of Usk states that she was a legitimate daughter by Joan, although some sources claim that her mother was Llywelyn's mistress, Tangwystl Goch.[64] She first married Reginald de Braose of Brecon and Abergavenny, but had no children by him. After Reginald's death she married Ralph de Mortimer of Wigmore and had several sons.\n\nThe mother of most of Llywelyn's illegitimate children is known or assumed to have been Llywelyn's mistress, Tangwystl Goch (c.1168-1198). Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c.1196-1244) was Llywelyn's eldest son and is known to be the son of Tangwystl. He married Senena, daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas of Anglesey . Their four sons included Llywelyn ap Gruffydd , who for a period occupied a position in Wales comparable to that of his grandfather, and Dafydd ap Gruffydd who ruled Gwynedd briefly after his brother's death. Llywelyn had another son, Tegwared ap Llywelyn, by a woman known only as Crysten.\n\nMarared ferch Llywelyn (c.1198-after 1263) married John de Braose of Gower, a nephew of Reginald de Braose, and after his death married Walter Clifford of Bronllys and Clifford. Other illegitimate daughters were Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn, who married William de Lacey, and Angharad ferch Llywelyn, who married Maelgwn Fychan. Susanna ferch Llywelyn was sent to England as a hostage in 1228, but no further details are known.\"\n\nAngharad married Maelgwn Fychan ap Maelgwn ap Rhys Lord of Cardigan Is Ayron, son of Maelgwn ap Rhys and Unknown.

THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH PLANTAGENET, daughter of Edward I by his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, was born at Rudlan Castle, in Flintshire, 1284. She married, first, in London, John, Earl of Holland, who died without issue two years after his marriage; and secondly, Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Lord High Constable of England. By her second husband she had a son: William de Bohun.\n\nFrom Wikipedia - Elizabeth of Rhuddlan :\n\nElizabeth of Rhuddlan (Elizabeth Plantagenet) (7 August 1282 Rhuddlan Castle - 5 May 1316 Quendon )\n\nBorn the eighth daughter of Edward I of England and Eleanor of Castile . Of all her siblings, she was closest to her younger brother Edward II of England , as they were only two years apart in age.\n\nIn April 1285 there were negotiations with Floris V for Elizabeth's betrothal to his son John I, Count of Holland . The offer was accepted and John was sent to England to be educated. On 8 January 1297 Elizabeth was married to John at Ipswich . In attendance at the marriage were Elizabeth's sister Margaret , her father, Edward I of England , her brother Edward , and Humphrey de Bohun . After the wedding Elizabeth was expected to go to Holland with her husband, but did not wish to go, leaving her husband to go alone.\n\nAfter some time travelling England , it was decided Elizabeth should follow her husband. Her father accompanied her, travelling through Antwerp , Malines , Louvain and Brussels , before ending up in Ghent . There they remained for a few months, spending Christmas with her two sister's Eleanor of England, Countess of Bar and Margaret Plantagenet . On 10 November 1299 , John died of dysentery , though there were rumours of his being murdered. No children had been born from the marriage.\n\nOn her return trip to England , Elizabeth went through Brabant to see her sister Margaret. When she arrived in England , she met her step mother Margaret of France , whom Edward had married whilst she was in Holland . Reportedly, they became inseparable. On 14 November 1302 Elizabeth was married to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford , 3rd of Essex, also Constable of England , at Westminster Abbey .\n\nDuring Christmas 1315 Elizabeth, who was pregnant with her 10th child, was visited by her sister-in-law Isabella of France . This was a great honour, but the stress of it may have caused unknown health problems that later contributed to Elizabeth's death in childbirth. On 5 May 1316 she went into labour, giving birth to her daughter Isabella.

Joan of Acre 26 27 was born in 1272 in Acre, Syria and died on 23 Apr 1307 at age 35. Another name for Joan was Joanna of Acre.\n\nResearch Notes: Second wife of Sir Gilbert de Clare.\n\nFrom Wikipedia - Joan of Acre :\n\nJoan of Acre (April 1272 - April 23 , 1307 ) was the daughter of King Edward I of England and Queen Eleanor . She is most notable for her marriage to Ralph de Monthermer and the claim that miracles have allegedly taken place at her grave. She is also notable for the multiple references of her in literature.\n\nBirth and Childhood\n\nJoan, or Joanna, of Acre as she is sometimes referred to, was born in the spring of 1272 in Syria, while her parents, King Edward I and Queen Eleanor of Castille, were on the crusade .[2] She was the only English princess to be born outside of her native land, in the city of Acre, where her name derives from.[3] Her parents departed from Acre shortly after her birth, traveling to Sicily and Spain[4] before leaving Joan with her grandmother in Ponthieu, France.[5] Joan lived for several years in France where she spent her time being educated by a bishop and \"being thoroughly spoiled by an indulgent grandmother.\"[6] Joan was free to play among the \"vine clad hills and sunny vales\"[7] surrounding her grandmother's home, although she required \"judicious surveillance.\"[8]\n\nAs Joan was growing up with her grandmother, her father was back in England, already arranging marriages for his daughter. He wanted to gain both political power and more wealth with his daughter, so he conducted the arrangement in a very \"business like style\".[9] He finally found a man suitable to marry Joan (aged 5 at the time), Hartman, son of King Rudoph I, of Germany. Edward then brought her home from France for the first time to meet him.[10] As she had spent her entire life away from Edward and Eleanor, when she returned she \"stood in no awe of her parents\"[11] and had a fairly distanced relationship with them.\n\nUnfortunately for King Edward, his daughter's suitor died before he was able to meet or marry Joan. The news reported that Hartman had fallen through a patch of shallow ice while \"amusing himself in skating\" while a letter sent to the King himself stated that Hartman had set out on a boat to visit his father amidst a terrible fog and the boat had smashed into a rock, drowning him.[12]\n\nFirst Marriage\n\nEdward arranged a second marriage almost immediately after the death of Hartman.[13] Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, who was almost thirty years older than Joan and newly divorced was his first choice.[14] The earl resigned his lands to Edward upon agreeing to get them back when he married Joan, as well as agreed on a dower of two thousand silver marks.[15] By the time all of these negotiations were finished, Joan was twelve years old.[16] Gilbert de Clare became very enamored with Joan, and even though she had to marry him regardless of how she felt, he still tried to woo her.[17] He bought her expensive gifts and clothing to try to win favor with her.[18] The couple were married on April 30th, 1290 at Westminster Abbey, and had four children together.[19]They were:\n\nGilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Hertford\n\nEleanor de Clare\n\nMargaret de Clare\n\nElizabeth de Clare\n\nJoan's first husband, Gilbert de Clare died on December 7th, 1295.[20]\n\nSecret Second Marriage\n\nJoan had been a widow for only a little over a year when she caught the eye of Ralph de Monthermer , a squire in Joan's father's household.[21] Joan fell in love and convinced her father to have Monthermer knighted. It was unheard of in European royalty for one in power to even converse with a man who had not won or acquired importance in the household. However, in January during the year of 1297, the couple was secretly married.[22] Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer, and Joan of Acre blind-sided her father with this secret while he was already planning another marriage for his daughter to Amadeus V, Count of Savoy.[23] The arrangements for this marriage were quickly made through written letters. The date was to be March 16th, 1297. Joan of Acre was in dangerous predicament, as she was already a wedded wife, unbeknownst to her father. She sent her son and little daughters over to Edward I, their grandfather, in hopes that their sweetness would serve in her favor. However, her plan did not work.[24] He soon found out the intentions his daughter had, but did not realize she had already committed them.[25]\n\nUpon finding out, he took all of Joan's lands into his own hands and continued on with his planning of the arranged marriage between Joan and Amadeus of Savoy.[26]\n\nSoon after the seizure of her lands, Joan told her father of the official marriage between her and Monthermer. He was enraged and retaliated by immediately throwing Monthermer in prison at Bristol Castle .[27] The people of the land had differing opinions on the princess' matter, however, and has been argued that ones who were most upset were those who wanted Joan's hand in marriage.[28]\n\nWith regard to the matter, Joan famously said, \"It is not considered ignominious, nor disgraceful for a great earl to take a poor and mean woman to wife; neither, on the other hand, is it worthy of blame, or too difficult a thing to promote to honor a gallant youth.\"[29] It is said that not only this claim, but the possibility of the appearance of a pregnant stomach seemed to soften Edward's attitude towards the situation.[30]\n\nAt last, her father relented for the sake of his daughter and released Monthermer from prison in August 1297.[31] Monthermer paid homage August 2nd and getting the title of Earl of Gloucester and Earl of Hertford , rose to favor with the King during Joan's lifetime. [32]. Monthermer and Joan had four children:\n\nMary de Monthermer, born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to wed Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife .\n\nJoan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at Amesbury .\n\nThomas de Monthermer , 2nd Baron Monthermer, born 1301.\n\nEdward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339.\n\nRelationship With Family\n\nAcre was the seventh child of Edward I and Eleanor's fourteen children. Most of her older siblings died before the age of seven, and many of her younger siblings died before adulthood.[33] Of the survivors, included were Joan, four of her sisters, and her younger brother, Edward (later Edward II , King of England). [34]\n\nAcre, like her siblings, was raised outside her family's household. She lived with her grandmother while her parents were on the crusade.[35] Edward I did not have a close relationship with most of his children while they were growing up, yet \"he seemed fonder of his daughters than his sons.\"[36] In fact, most of the children who made it to adulthood were Edward's daughters.[37]\n\nHowever, Acre's independent nature caused numerous conflicts between her and her father. Her father disapproved of her leaving court after her marriage to the Earl of Gloucester, and in turn \"seized seven robes that had been made for her.\"[38] He also strongly disapproved of her second marriage to Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in her household, even to the point of attempting to force her to marry someone else.[39][40] While Edward ultimately developed a cordial relationship with Monthermer, even giving him the title of Earl [41], there appears to have been a notable difference in the Edward's treatment of Joan as compared to the treatment of the rest of her siblings. For instance, her father famously paid messengers substantially when they brought news of the birth of grandchildren, but did not do this upon birth of Acre's daughter.[42]\n\nIn terms of her siblings, Acre kept a fairly tight bond. She and Monthermer both maintained a close relationship with her brother, Edward II, which was maintained through letters. After Edward II became estranged from his parents and lost his royal seal, \"Joan offered to lend him her seal\" instead.[43]\n\nDeath\n\nJoan of Acre died on April 23, 1307.[44] The cause of her death remains unclear, though one popular theory is that she died during childbirth, a common cause of death at the time. However, historians have not confirmed this to be her cause of death.[45]\n\nLess than four months after her death, Joan's father, Edward I died. Ralph de Monthermer was stripped of his title of Earl soon after the deaths of his wife and father in law, and the title was given to Joan's son from her first marriage, Gilbert.[46]\n\nJoan's burial place has been the cause of some interest and debate. Allegedly, in 1357, Joan's daughter, Elizabeth De Burgh, claimed to have \"inspected her mother's body and found the corpse to be intact,\"[47]an indication of sanctity. Some sources claim that miracles have taken place at her tomb, from a cure of the toothache to the fever, which was often fatal at the time. [48]\n\nJoan married Sir Gilbert de Clare 9th Earl of Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford 51 52 53 about 30 Apr 1290 in Westminster Abbey, London, England, son of Sir Richard de Clare 8th Earl of Clare and Maud de Lacy Countess of Lincoln. Gilbert was born on 2 Sep 1243 in Christchurch, Hampshire (Dorset), England, died on 7 Dec 1295 in Monmouth Castle, Monmouthshire, England at age 52, and was buried on 22 Dec 1295 in Tewkesbury Abbey, Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England. Another name for Gilbert was Gilbert \"the Red\" de Clare 9th Earl of Clare.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n 3rd Earl of Gloucester:\n\n 7th Earl of Hertford:\n\n Knighted: 14 May 1264.\n\nThe child from this marriage was:\n\n+ 50 F i.

KingEdward II of England 28 29 was born on 25 Apr 1284 in Caernarfon Castle, Caernarfonshire, Gwynedd, Wales, died on 21 Sep 1327 in <Berkeley Castle, > near Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England at age 43, and was buried in Gloucester Cathedral, Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England. Another name for Edward was Edward of Caenarvon.\n\nResearch Notes: From Wikipedia - Edward II of England :\n\nEdward II, (April 25 , 1284 - September 21 , 1327 ) of Caernarfon , was King of England from 1307 until deposed in January 1327. His tendency to ignore his nobility in favour of low-born favourites led to constant political unrest and his eventual deposition. Edward is perhaps best remembered for his murder and his alleged homosexuality .\n\nEdward II was the first monarch to establish colleges in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge ; he founded Cambridge's King's Hall in 1317 and gave Oxford's Oriel College its royal charter in 1326. Both colleges received the favour of Edward's son, Edward III , who confirmed Oriel's charter in 1327 and refounded King's Hall in 1337.\n\nPrince of Wales\n\nThe fourth son of Edward I of England by his first wife Eleanor of Castile , Edward II was born at Caernarfon Castle . He was the first English prince to hold the title of the Prince of Wales , which was formalized by the Lincoln Parliament of February 7 , 1301 .\n\nThe story that his father presented Edward II as a newborn to the Welsh as their future native prince is unfounded (the Welsh would have asked the King to give them a prince that spoke Welsh , and he would have answered he would give them a prince that spoke no English at all); the story first appeared in the work of 16th century Welsh \"antiquary \" David Powel [citation needed ].\n\nEdward became heir at just a few months old, following the death of his elder brother Alphonso . His father, a notable military leader, trained his heir in warfare and statecraft starting in his childhood, yet the young Edward preferred boating and craftsman work - activities thought beneath kings at the time...\n\nOn January 25 , 1308 , Edward married Isabella of France , the daughter of King Philip IV of France , \"Philip the Fair,\" and sister to three French kings. The marriage was doomed to failure almost from the beginning. Isabella was frequently neglected by her husband, who spent much of his time conspiring with his favourites regarding how to limit the powers of the Peerage in order to consolidate his father's legacy for himself. Nevertheless, their marriage produced two sons, Edward (1312-1377), who would succeed his father on the throne as Edward III, and John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-1336), and two daughters, Eleanor (1318-1355) and Joanna (1321-1362), wife of David II of Scotland . Edward had also fathered at least one illegitimate son, Adam FitzRoy , who accompanied his father in the Scottish campaigns of 1322 and died on 18 September 1322 .\n\n[edit ] War with the Barons\n\nWhen Edward travelled to the northern French city of Boulogne to marry Isabella, he left his friend and counsellor Gaveston to act as regent. Gaveston also received the earldom of Cornwall and the hand of the king's niece, Margaret of Gloucester; these proved to be costly honours.\n\nVarious barons grew resentful of Gaveston, and insisted on his banishment through the Ordinances of 1311 . Edward recalled his friend, but in 1312, Gaveston was executed by the Earl of Lancaster and his allies, who claimed that Gaveston led the king to folly. (Gaveston was run through and beheaded on Blacklow Hill, outside the small village of Leek Wootton , where a monument called Gaveston's Cross still stands today).\n\nImmediately following, Edward focused on the destruction of those who had betrayed him, while the barons themselves lost impetus (with Gaveston dead, they saw little need to continue). By mid-July, Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke was advising the king to make war on the barons who, unwilling to risk their lives, entered negotiations in September 1312. In October, the Earls of Lancaster, Warwick, Arundel and Hereford begged Edward's pardon.\n\n[edit ] Conflict with Scotland\n\nDuring this period, Robert the Bruce was steadily re-conquering Scotland . Each campaign begun by Edward, from 1307 to 1314, ended in Robert's clawing back more of the land that Edward I had taken during his long reign. Robert's military successes against Edward II were due to a number of factors, not the least of which was the Scottish King's strategy. He used small forces to trap an invading English army, he took castles by stealth to preserve his troops and he used the land itself as a weapon against Edward by attacking quickly and then disappearing into the hills before facing the superior numbers of the English. Castle by castle, Robert the Bruce rebuilt Scotland and united the country against its common enemy. Indeed, Robert is quoted as saying that he feared more the dead Edward I than the living Edward II. Thus, by June 1314, only Stirling Castle and Berwick remained under English control.\n\nOn 23 June 1314 , Edward and his army of 20,000 foot soldiers and 3000 cavalry faced Robert and his army of foot soldiers and farmers wielding 14 foot long pikes. Edward knew he had to keep the critical stronghold of Stirling Castle if there was to be any chance for English military success. The castle, however, was under a constant state of siege, and the English commander, Sir Phillip de Mowbray, had advised Edward that he would surrender the castle to the Scots unless Edward arrived by June 24 , 1314 , to relieve the siege. Edward could not afford to lose his last forward castle in Scotland. He decided therefore to gamble his entire army to break the siege and force the Scots to a final battle by putting its army into the field.\n\nHowever, Edward had made a serious mistake in thinking that his vastly superior numbers alone would provide enough of a strategic advantage to defeat the Scots. Robert not only had the advantage of prior warning, as he knew the actual day that Edward would come north and fight, he also had the time to choose the field of battle most advantageous to the Scots and their style of combat. As Edward moved forward on the main road to Stirling, Robert placed his army on either side of the road north, one in the dense woods and the other placed on a bend on the river, a spot hard for the invading army to see. Robert also ordered his men to dig potholes and cover them with bracken in order to help break any cavalry charge.\n\nBy contrast, Edward did not issue his writs of service, calling upon 21,540 men, until May 27 , 1314 . Worse, his army was ill-disciplined and had seen little success in eight years of campaigns. On the eve of battle, he decided to move his entire army at night and placed it in a marshy area, with its cavalry laid out in nine squadrons in front of the foot soldiers. The following battle, the Battle of Bannockburn , is considered by contemporary scholars to be the worst defeat sustained by the English since the Battle of Hastings in 1066.\n\nTactics similar to Robert's were employed by victorious English armies against the French in later centuries, partly as a direct result of the enduring decisiveness of the Scots' victory. A young Henry V of England would use this exact tactic against French cavalry in a key battle on the fields of Agincourt in 1415, winning the day and the war against France.[citation needed ]...\n\n[edit ] End of the Despensers\n\nReprisals against Edward's allies began immediately thereafter. The Earl of Arundel, an old enemy of Roger Mortimer, was beheaded; this was followed by the trial and execution of Despenser.\n\nDespenser was brutally executed and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. They then led him into the city, presenting him in the market square to Roger, Isabella, and the Lancastrians. He was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated , and then be drawn and quartered as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed through England.\n\n[edit ] Abdication\n\nWith the King imprisoned, Mortimer and the Queen faced the problem of what to do with him. The simplest solution would be execution: his titles would then pass to Edward of Windsor, whom Isabella could control, while it would also prevent the possibility of his being restored. Execution would require the King to be tried and convicted of treason: and while most Lords agreed that Edward had failed to show due attention to his country, several Prelates argued that, appointed by God, the King could not be legally deposed or executed; if this happened, they said, God would punish the country. Thus, at first, it was decided to have Edward imprisoned for life instead.\n\nHowever, the fact remained that the legality of power still lay with the King. Isabella had been given the Great Seal, and was using it to rule in the names of the King, herself, and their son as appropriate; nonetheless, these actions were illegal, and could at any moment be challenged.\n\nIn these circumstances, Parliament chose to act as an authority above the King. Representatives of the House of Commons were summoned, and debates began. The Archbishop of York and others declared themselves fearful of the London mob, loyal to Roger Mortimer. Others wanted the King to speak in Parliament and openly abdicate , rather than be deposed by the Queen and her General. Mortimer responded by commanding the Mayor of London , Richard de Bethune, to write to Parliament, asking them to go to the Guildhall to swear an oath to protect the Queen and Prince Edward, and to depose the King. Mortimer then called the great lords to a secret meeting that night, at which they gave their unanimous support to the deposition of the King.\n\nEventually Parliament agreed to remove the King. However, for all that Parliament had agreed that the King should no longer rule, they had not deposed him. Rather, their decision made, Edward was asked to accept it.\n\nOn January 20, Edward II was informed at Kenilworth Castle of the charges brought against him. The King was guilty of incompetence; allowing others to govern him to the detriment of the people and Church; not listening to good advice and pursuing occupations unbecoming to a monarch; having lost Scotland and lands in Gascony and Ireland through failure of effective governance; damaging the Church , and imprisoning its representatives; allowing nobles to be killed, disinherited, imprisoned and exiled; failing to ensure fair justice, instead governing for profit and allowing others to do likewise; and of fleeing in the company of a notorious enemy of the realm, leaving it without government, and thereby losing the faith and trust of his people. Edward, profoundly shocked by this judgement, wept while listening. He was then offered a choice: he might abdicate in favour of his son; or he might resist, and relinquish the throne to one not of royal blood, but experienced in government - this, presumably, being Roger Mortimer. The King, lamenting that his people had so hated his rule, agreed that if the people would accept his son, he would abdicate in his favour. The lords, through the person of Sir William Trussel, then renounced their homage to him, and the reign of Edward II ended.\n\nThe abdication was announced and recorded in London on January 24, and the following day was proclaimed the first of the reign of Edward III - who, at 14, was still controlled by Isabella and Mortimer. The former King Edward remained imprisoned.\n\nDeath\n\nEdward II's tomb at Gloucester Cathedral\n\nThe government of Isabella and Mortimer was so precarious that they dared not leave the deposed king in the hands of their political enemies. On April 3, Edward II was removed from Kenilworth and entrusted to the custody of two dependents of Mortimer, then later imprisoned at Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire where, it is generally believed, he was murdered by an agent of Isabella and Mortimer...\n\nFollowing the public announcement of the king's death, the rule of Isabella and Mortimer did not last long. Mortimer and Isabella made peace with the Scots in the Treaty of Northampton , but this move was highly unpopular. Consequently, when Edward III came of age in 1330, he executed Roger Mortimer on fourteen charges of treason, most significantly the murder of Edward II (thereby removing any public doubt about his father's survival). Edward III spared his mother and gave her a generous allowance, but ensured that she retired from public life for several years. She died at Hertford on August 23 , 1358 .\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n King of England: 1307-1327.\n\nEdward married Isabella of France 56 57 on 25 Jan 1308 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, daughter of Philip IV King of France and Jeanne of Navarre.
