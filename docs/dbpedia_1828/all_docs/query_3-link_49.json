Due to this seasonal variation in salinity and the natural density differences between fresh and saline waters, signifi- cant non-tidal circulation often occurs within the Bay's small tributary em- bayments. In the spring, during the period of high freshwater inflow to the Bay, salinity in the embayments may be greater than in the Bay. Because of this J r salinity difference, surface water from \\C B I I ---muDEL SITE the Bay flows into the tributaries on the surface, while the heavier, more saline bottom water from the tributaries flows into the Bay along the bottom. As Bay salinity becomes greater through summer and early fall, Bay waters flow into the bottom of the tributaries, while tribu- tary surface waters flow into the Bay. rob L The natural variations in salinity that occur in the Bay are part of the dynamic nature of the estuary, and the resident species of the plants and animals are /1 ordinarily able to adjust to the changes. Sudden changes in salinity, however, or 'N C. B L 4L /C changes of long duration or magnitude, may upset the equilibrium between organisms and their environment.
