In 1308 he was sent to Scotland to oppose Robert Bruce.\n\nHe was one of the twenty-one ordainers appointed to reform the government and the king's household. The ordinances were accepted in October 1311, but three months later the king recalled his banished favorite, Gaveston, and immediately:the barons, including de Bohun, took arms against Gaveston, captured and beheaded him. Edward was powerless to punish the rebellious lords; negotiations for peace were opened and in October 1313 the earls and their followers were pardoned. In 1314 the war with Scotland was renewed and de Bohun was taken prisoner at the battle of Bannockburn. He was later exchanged for Elizabeth, wife of Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, who had long been held captive in England.

According to the custom upon the admission of the early knights of that order, he executed a deed of gift, dated London, 4 May following, of the advowson of Dadington to the canons of the said chapel.\n\nWilliam de Bohun, Earl of Northampton in 1337 carried a seal with the whole of the family Arms reproduced on it.\n\nWilliam assisted in the overthrow of Roger Mortimer. The manor of High-Wycombe was granted to William de Bohun in 1332. In 1336 William was made Constable of England. In a Parliament William was made Earl of Northampton on March 17 1337 by Edward III, at the occasion of conferring the Dukedom of Cornwall to Prince Edward. The elevation of William de Bohun, backed up by Â£1,000 a year helped William supply men to Edward III for his campaigns. In 1337 William was appointed one of the commissioners to treat with Philip of Valois, discussing the right to the French Crown, and also to negotiate a peace with David Bruce. In 1339 William was one of the marshals in the third battalia of Edward III's army, drawn up at Vironfosse. William took part in the naval Victory at the battle of Sluys 1340. In 1342, William was made the King's Leutenant and Captain General in Brittany, with powers to receive fealty and homage from the inhabitants on behalf of Edward III under his assumed title as King of France. In August 1342 William de Bohun, Constable of England, along with Robert of Artois, lands in Brest, advances across Brittany and captures Vannes. On 30 September 1342 William de Bohun defeated Charles de Blois at the Battle of Morlay, and took the town of Roch-Dirien by assault. In 1343, William was in the expedition of the Earl of Lancaster into Scotland and was appointed Governor of Lochmaben Castle. Later in 1343 William was back in Brittany. On 16 August 1346 William led a heavy cavalry detachment accross the recently rebuilt bridge over the Seine at Poissy to clear the militia guarding the north bank stationed by King Philippe of France. Together with the Earl of Warwick he led the crossing of the Somme at Blanche-Taque to secure the northern bank and allow the English army to cross prior to the battle of Crecy. At Crecy he led the second battle of the English army on the right wing.\n\nOn 10 May 1346 Letters Patent of Edward III, granting license (at the request of William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton) to Richard and Ann Hakoun and John and Isabel Burdoun to grant one quarter of Bricett manor to Bricett priory. The Great Seal of Edward III is attached.\n\nIn 1347, he is particularly mentioned by the King in his letter to the Archbishop of York, detailing the events before Calais. Also in 1347 William De Bohun was at the Siege of Calais, with his nephew Hugh Courtenay and in the camp around Calais, the King, upon their joint supplication, excused the Earl of Devon, on account of infirm health, from attending on any military service out of the realm. After the surrender, he probably returned in the Royal suite to England and he was at Eltham Palace, Surrey, towards the close of 1347, distinguishing himself at a tournament, and receiving from the King, as his reward, a hood of white cloth, buttoned with large pearls and embroidered with figures of men in dancing postures.\n\nThe Earl of Northampton, who succeeded in 1349 Sir Hugh Courtenay in the seventh Garter Stall on the Sovereign's side in St. George's College Chapel, Windsor, Berks, had licence, on the 26 January 1350, to assign the advowson of Dadington to the custodians and chaplains of the said college, and that, on the 4 May 1350, the Earl completed that donation, which was made in conformity to a custom observed by Knights of the Order soon after the foundation.\n\nThe Isle of Foulness lies just off of the Essex coast near Shoebury. The area was already considered an island back in roman times and the name seems to be derived from old English fulga-naess meaning \"wild birds nest\". Foulness manor in 1235 was granted to Hugh de Burg Earl of Kent , then in 1271 passed down to Guy de Rochford and then his nephew John and then Robert de Rochford in 1324. After this date it is recorded in the records as part of the estate of William de Bohun Earl of Hereford until 1373\n\nBuried at Walden Abbey, Essex, England.\n\nfrom http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bohun-35\n\n~~~~~~~~.\n\nPresent at the naval victory of Sluys and also at the battle of CrÃ©cy.\n\nLady Elizabeth de Badlesmere1 [933] (also known as Elizabeth Baldesmere), daughter of Bartholomew de Badlesmere ( - ) [934], married Edmund De Mortimer on 27 June 1316 in Earnwood, Kinlet, Shropshire, Englan.2 She was born circa 1325.1 She died on 8 June 1356 in Richmond Palace, Surry, England.2\n\nShe received dower in September 1332, and in 1334 obtained the castle of Bridgwater and various manors as her right by gift of Roger de Mortimer.\n\nShe was a great benefactress of the Church. Among numerous other gifts, she bestowed on the house of the Black Friars in Ludgate (where she was buried) \"a cross made of the wood of the very cross of our Saviour, which she usually carried with her, wherein was contained one of the thorns of His crown.\"\n\nHer will, dated 31 May 1356, directed burial in the Black Friar's, London (where her tomb is recorded by Stow).\n\nfrom http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Badlesmere-5\n\n~~~~~~~.\n\nElizabeth de Badlesmere and William de Bohun had the following children:\n\n+31\n\nHumphrey de Bohun - 7th Earl of Hereford (1342-1373) [944]\n\n+32\n\nElizabeth de Bohun (c. 1350-1385) [465]\n\n23. Edward Plantagenet - King Edward III [1121], son of Edward Plantagenet - King Edward II [1142] and Isabella - of France [1153], was born on 13 November 1312 in Windsor Castle, Berkshire, England.3 He had the title 'King Edward III'. He married Philippa of Hainault [1122] on 24 January 1328. He died on 21 July 1377 in Sheen Palace, Richmond, London, England.3 He was buried in Westminster Abbey, London, England.\n\nEdward III (13 November 1312 â 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 until his death; he is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father, Edward II. Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of fifty years also saw vital developments in legislation and governmentâin particular the evolution of the English parliamentâas well as the ravages of the Black Death.\n\nEdward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied due to the Salic law. This started what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.[1] Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at CrÃ©cy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of BrÃ©tigny. Edward's later years, however, were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.\n\nEdward III was a temperamental man but capable of unusual clemency. He was in many ways a conventional king whose main interest was warfare. Admired in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.\n\nPhilippa of Hainault [1122] was born on 24 June 1314. She died on 15 August 1369.\n\nPhilippa of Hainault, LG or Philippa of Holland (24 June[1] 1314 â 15 August 1369) was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward III.[2] Edward, Duke of Guyenne, her future husband, promised in 1326 to marry her within the following two years.[3] She was married to Edward, first by proxy, when Edward dispatched the Bishop of Coventry \"to marry her in his name\" in Valenciennes (second city in importance of the county of Hainaut) in October 1327.[4] The marriage was celebrated formally in York Minster on 24 January 1328, some months after Edward's accession to the throne of England. In August 1328, he also fixed his wife's dower.[5]\n\nPhilippa acted as regent on several occasions when her husband was away from his kingdom and she often accompanied him on his expeditions to Scotland, France, and Flanders. Philippa won much popularity with the English people for her kindness and compassion, which were demonstrated in 1347 when she successfully persuaded King Edward to spare the lives of the Burghers of Calais. It was this popularity that helped maintain peace in England throughout Edward's long reign.[6] The eldest of her fourteen children was Edward, the Black Prince, who became a renowned military leader. Philippa died at the age of fifty-five from an illness closely related to dropsy. The Queen's College, Oxford was founded in her honour.\n\nPhilippa of Hainault and Edward Plantagenet - King Edward III had the following children:\n\n+33\n\nEdward Plantagenet - The Black Prince (1330-1376) [1233]\n\n+34\n\nIsabella Plantagenet (1332- ) [1242]\n\n+35\n\nJoan Plantagenet (1333- ) [1243]\n\n+36\n\nWilliam Plantagenet (1337- ) [1244]\n\n+37\n\nLionel Plantagenet (1338- ) [1245]\n\n+38\n\nJohn Plantagenet of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (1340-1399) [1246]\n\n+39\n\nEdmund Plantagenet of Langley, 1st Duke of York (1341- ) [1247]\n\n+40\n\nBlanche Plantagenet (1342- ) [1248]\n\n+41\n\nMary Plantagenet (1344- ) [1249]\n\n+42\n\nMargaret Plantagenet (1346- ) [1250]\n\n+43\n\nThomas Plantagenet of Windsor (1347-1348) [1251]\n\n+44\n\nThomas Plantagenet - 1st Duke of Gloucester (1355-1397) [448]\n\n24.

He was called \"John of Gaunt\" because he was born in Ghent, then rendered in English as Gaunt. When he became unpopular later in life, scurrilous rumours and lampoons circulated that he was actually the son of a Ghent butcher, perhaps because Edward III was not present at the birth. This story always drove him to fury.[2]\n\nAs a younger brother of Edward, Prince of Wales (Edward, the Black Prince), John exercised great influence over the English throne during the minority of his nephew, Richard II, and during the ensuing periods of political strife, but was not thought to have been among the opponents of the king.\n\nJohn of Gaunt's legitimate male heirs, the Lancasters, included Kings Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI. His other legitimate descendants included, by his first wife, Blanche, his daughters Queen Philippa of Portugal and Elizabeth, Duchess of Exeter; and by his second wife, Constance, his daughter Queen Catherine of Castile. John fathered five children outside marriage, one early in life by a lady-in-waiting to his mother, and four surnamed \"Beaufort\" (after a former French possession of the Duke) by Katherine Swynford, Gaunt's long-term mistress and third wife. The Beaufort children, three sons and a daughter, were legitimised by royal and papal decrees after John and Katherine married in 1396; a later proviso that they were specifically barred from inheriting the throne, the phrase excepta regali dignitate (except royal status), was inserted with dubious authority by their half-brother Henry IV. Descendants of this marriage included Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester and eventually Cardinal; Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, grandmother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III; John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the grandfather of Margaret Beaufort, the mother of King Henry VII; and Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots, from whom are descended, beginning in 1437, all subsequent sovereigns of Scotland, and successively, from 1603 on, the sovereigns of England, of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the United Kingdom to the present day. The three succeeding houses of English sovereigns from 1399âthe Houses of Lancaster, York and Tudorâwere descended from John through Henry Bolingbroke, Joan Beaufort and John Beaufort, respectively.\n\nLancaster's eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, was exiled for ten years by King Richard II in 1398 as resolution to a dispute between Hereford and Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.[3] When John of Gaunt died in 1399, his estates and titles were declared forfeit to the crown as King Richard II named Hereford a traitor and changed his sentence to exile for life.[3] Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile to reclaim his inheritance and depose Richard. Bolingbroke then reigned as King Henry IV of England (1399â1413), the first of the descendants of John of Gaunt to hold the throne of England. Due to some generous land grants, John was one of the richest men in his era.\n\nsee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Gaunt.\n\nBlanche of Lancaster5 [1252] died in 1369.5 She and John Plantagenet of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster had the following children:\n\n+56\n\nPhilippa Lancaster - Queen of Portugal ( - ) [1255]\n\n+57\n\nElizabeth Lancaster - Duchess of Exeter ( - ) [1256]\n\n+58\n\nHenry Lancaster - King Henry IV (Bolingbroke) (1367-1413) [1257]\n\nInfanta Constance of Castille5 [1253] died in 1394.5 She and John Plantagenet of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster had the following children:\n\n+59\n\nCatherine Plantagenet - Queen of Castille ( - ) [1258]\n\nKatherine Swynford5 [1254] and John Plantagenet of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster had the following children:\n\n+60\n\nJohn Beaufort - 1st Earl of Somerset ( - ) [1259]\n\n+61\n\nHenry Beaufort - Cardinal ( - ) [1260]\n\n+62\n\nThomas Beaufort - Duke of Exeter ( - ) [1261]\n\n+63\n\nJoan Beaufort - Countess of Westmorland ( - ) [1262]\n\n39.

He died on 14 February 1400 in Pontefract Castle, Yorkshire, Engand. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, London, England.\n\nRichard II (6 January 1367 â c. 14 February 1400), also known as Richard of Bordeaux, was King of England from 1377 until he was deposed on 30 September 1399.\n\nRichard, a son of Edward, the Black Prince, was born during the reign of his grandfather, Edward III. Richard was the younger brother of Edward of AngoulÃªme; upon the death of this elder brother, Richardâat four years of ageâbecame second in line to the throne after his father. Upon the death of Richard's father prior to the death of Edward III, Richard, by primogeniture, became the first in line for the throne. With Edward III's death the following year, Richard succeeded to the throne at the age of ten.\n\nDuring Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.\n\nIn 1397, Richard took his revenge on the appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's \"tyranny\". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, Henry of Bolingbroke, who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Claiming initially that his goal was only to reclaim his patrimony, it soon became clear that he intended to claim the throne for himself. Meeting little resistance, Bolingbroke deposed Richard and had himself crowned as King Henry IV. Richard died in captivity in February 1400; he is thought to have been starved to death, though questions remain regarding his final fate.\n\nRichard was said to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Though probably not insane, as earlier historians used to believe, he may have suffered from what modern psychologists would call a \"personality disorder\" towards the end of his reign. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, something which led him to restrain the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at the centre.\n\nRichard's posthumous reputation has to a large extent been shaped by Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the fifteenth century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.\n\nsee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England.\n\nFifth Generation\n\n46.

He had the title '1st Baron Fitzwaryn'.10 He died in 1474. He married Thomazine Hankeford [368]. He married Catherine de Affeton [1162].\n\nWilliam Bourchier (1407-1470) jure uxoris 1st Baron FitzWarin, was an English nobleman. He was summoned to Parliament in 1448[1] as Baron FitzWarin in right of his wife Thomasine Hankford.\n\nOrigins\n\nHe was the 2nd son of William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu (c.1374-1420) by his wife Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Stafford, the daughter of the Plantagenet prince, Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (13th and youngest child of King Edward III and Philippa of Hainault) by his wife Eleanor de Bohun elder daughter and coheiress of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341-1373), Earl of Essex and Northampton.

Thomasine's mother (Sir Richard's 1st wife) was Elizabeth FitzWarin, 8th Baroness FitzWarin (c. 1404 â c. 1427), sister and heiress of Fulk FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin (1406â1420), feudal baron of Bampton, in Devon. Upon the death of Elizabeth FitzWarin in 1427 the barony of FitzWarin went into abeyance between her daughters Thomasine Hankford and Elizabeth Hankford (died 1433). On the death of Elizabeth Hankford in 1433, the barony of FitzWarin was inherited by her sister Thomasine Hankford, the wife of William Bourchier, who was summoned to Parliament as Lord FitzWarin in her right. Thomasine Hankford's father married secondly to Anne Montacute, daughter of John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury (1350-1400) (or according to the Devon historian Tristram Risdon (d.1640), to Anne Nevill, daughter of Lord Nevill). By his 2nd wife Sir Richard II Hankford left a daughter Anne Hankford (c. 1431 â 1485), who married Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond (c.1426-1515). Anne Hankford and her husband inherited Annery, whilst Thomasine Hankford and her husband William Bourchier inherited Bampton. William Bourchier had by Thomasine Hankford progeny including:\n\nFulk Bourchier, 10th Baron FitzWarin (d.1480), son and heir. He requested in his will to be buried at Bampton. He married Elizabeth Dynham, one of the four sisters and co-heiresses of John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham (1433-1501), KG, of Nutwell, Devon. Elizabeth remarried to Sir John Sapcotes and a stained glass heraldic escutcheon survives in Bampton church showing the arms of Sapcotes impaling Dinham. Fulk's son and heir was John Bourchier, 1st Earl of Bath and 11th Baron FitzWarin (1470â1539), created in 1536 Earl of Bath. The Bourchiers later moved their seat from Bampton westwards to Tawstock in North Devon.\n\nBlanche Bourchier (d.4 January 1483),[10] who married firstly Philip Beaumont (1432-1473), of Shirwell, Devon, MP in 1467 and Sheriff of Devon in 1469. The marriage was without progeny. Her stone effigy survives in Shirwell Church. Blanche survived her first husband and re-married secondly to Bartholomew St Ledger \"of Kent\", probably a relative or descendant of Sir John St Ledger (c.1404-1442) of Ulcombe, Kent, Sheriff of Kent in 1430, one of whose sons was Sir James St Ledger (c.1441-post 1509) of Annery in the parish of Monkleigh, North Devon, who married Anne Butler, daughter of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, and was therefore an uncle to Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire. Another son was Sir Thomas St Leger (c.1440-1483), the second husband of Anne of York (1439-1476), daughter of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, thus an elder sister of Kings Edward IV (1461-1483) and Richard III (1483-1485). Sir Thomas St Ledger's grand-daughter Eleanor manners was the 2nd wife of John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath and 12th Baron FitzWarin (d.1560), of Tawstock.\n\nSecondly William Bourchier married Catherine de Affeton (d.1467), daughter and heiress of John de Affeton of Affeton, Devon, and widow of Hugh Stucley of Affeton, Sheriff of Devon in 1448.\n\nDeath & burial\n\nBoth William Bourchier and his wife Thomasine Hankford were buried in Bampton Church. Dugdale quoted the will of his son Fulk Bourchier who bequeathed his body to be buried in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin at Bampton, near the grave of his mother, Lady Thomasine, and he willed that marble stones with inscriptions should be placed on his own grave and that of his father, Lord William, and his mother, Lady Thomasine.\n\n1st of the BATH line ?\n\nThomazine Hankeford [368] and William Bourchier - 1st Baron Fitzwaryn had the following children:\n\n+106\n\nBlanche Bourchier ( - ) [369]\n\n+107\n\nFulke Bourchier - 2nd Baron Fitzwaryn (1445-1497) [370]\n\nCatherine de Affeton [1162] died in 1467.\n\n84.

He held the office of Constable of Windsor Castle between 17 December 1461 and 1474. His last will was dated 21 March 1473/74.\" http://www.thepeerage.com/p1754.htm\n\nfrom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Berners:\n\nThe title was created in 1455 for Sir John Bourchier, youngest son of William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu, and younger brother of Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex and William Bourcher, Baron FitzWarine (from whom the Earls of Bath descended). He was the husband of Margery Berners, daughter of Sir Richard Berners. The barony was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. Lord Berners was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1516 and 1527.\n\nHe died without male heirs and was succeeded by his daughter Jane Knyvett, the de jure third holder. However, she never assumed the title. Jane was the wife of Edmund Knyvett. Their grandson, the de jure fourth Baron, obtained a certificate of his right to the title but died before obtaining the King's confirmation. His great-great-grandson Thomas Knyvett, the de jure seventh Baron, sat as a Member of Parliament for Dunwich and Eyre. On his death in 1693 the peerage technically fell into abeyance between his two sisters, Elizabeth, wife of Thomas Glenham, and Katherine, wife firstly of John Harris and secondly of Richard Bokenham.\n\nMargery Berners - Baroness Berners10 [326] (also known as Margaret Berners), daughter of Sir Richard Berners ( - ) [1071], had the title 'Baroness Berners'.

Cardinal Thomas Bourchier - Cardinal of Canterbury Cathedral10 [342], son of William Bourchier - 1st Count of Eu [337] and Anne Plantagenet - of Gloucester, Countess of Stafford and Eu of Gloucester [338], was born in 1413. He had the title 'Cardinal at Canterbury Cathedral'. He died on 30 March 1486 in Knole House, near Sevenoaks, Kent, England. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, Canterbury, Kent, England.\n\nThomas was a younger son of William Bourchier, Earl of Eu (d. 1420), and through his mother, Anne, a daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, was a descendant of King Edward III of England. One of his brothers was Henry, Earl of Essex (d. 1483), and his grand-nephew was John, Lord Berners, the translator of Froissart. Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham was a half-brother.\n\nEducated at the University of Oxford, he then entering the church and obtained rapid promotion. After holding some minor appointments he became Bishop of Worcester in 1434. In the same year he was chancellor of the University of Oxford, and in 1443 he was appointed Bishop of Ely; then in Apr 1454 he was made Archbishop of Canterbury, becoming Lord Chancellor of England in the following Mar.\n\nBourchier's short term of office as chancellor coincided with the start of the Wars of the Roses, and at first he was not a strong partisan, although he lost his position as chancellor when Richard, Duke of York, was deprived of power in Oct 1456. Afterwards, in 1458, he helped to reconcile the contending parties, but when the war was renewed in 1459 he appears as a decided Yorkist; he crowned Edward IV in Jun 1461, and four years later he performed a similar service for the queen, Elizabeth Woodville.\n\nIn 1457 Bourchier took the chief part in the trial of Reginald Peacock, Bishop of Chichester, for heresy; in 1467 he was created a Cardinal; and in 1475 he was one of the four arbitrators appointed to arrange the details of the treaty of Picquigny between England and France. After the death of Edward IV in 1483 Bourchier persuaded the Queen to allow her younger son, Richard, Duke of York, to share his brother's residence in the Tower of London; and although he had sworn to be faithful to Edward V before his father's death, he crowned Richard III in Jul 1483. He was, however, in no way implicated in the murder of the young princes, and he was probably a participant in the conspiracies against Richard.\n\nThe third English King crowned by Bourchier was Henry VII, whom he also married to Elizabeth of York in Jan 1486.\n\nThe Archbishop died on 30 Mar 1486 at his residence, Knole House, near Sevenoaks, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral.\n\n86.

Until 1437, his realm was governed by regents.\n\nContemporaneous accounts described him as peaceful and pious, not suited for the dynastic wars, such as the Wars of the Roses, which commenced during his reign. His periods of insanity and his inherent benevolence eventually required his wife, Margaret of Anjou, to assume control of his kingdom, which contributed to his own downfall, the collapse of the House of Lancaster, and the rise of the House of York\n\nsee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England.\n\nMargaret of Anjou [1272] was born on 23 March 1430.17 She died on 25 August 1482.\n\nMargaret of Anjou (French: Marguerite; 23 March 1430 â 25 August 1482) was the wife of King Henry VI of England. As such, she was Queen of England from 1445 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471. Born in the Duchy of Lorraine, into the House of Valois-Anjou, Margaret was the second eldest daughter of RenÃ© I of Naples and Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine.\n\nShe was one of the principal figures in the series of dynastic civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses and at times personally led the Lancastrian faction. Due to her husband's frequent bouts of insanity, Margaret ruled the kingdom in his place. It was she who called for a Great Council in May 1455 that excluded the Yorkist faction headed by Richard, Duke of York, and thus provided the spark that ignited a civil conflict that lasted for over thirty years, decimated the old nobility of England, and caused the deaths of thousands of men, including her only son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.\n\nMargaret was taken prisoner by the victorious Yorkists after the Lancastrian defeat at Tewkesbury. In 1475, she was ransomed by her cousin, King Louis XI of France. She went to live in France as a poor relation of the French king, and she died there at the age of 52.\n\nsee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Anjou.\n\nMargaret of Anjou and Henry Lancaster - King Henry VI had the following children:\n\n+113\n\nEdward Lancaster of Westminster, Prince of Wales (1453-1471) [1273]\n\n88.

He married Elizabeth Hopton [914] in 1471 in Moreton Corbet, Shropshire, England. He died as a result of execution on 16 February 1495.1\n\nNotes: Knight of the Garter. The Complete Peerage vol.IV,p.206,note c. Second son, Sir William supported the house of York in the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459. In 1461, Edward IV made Sir William Stanley the Chamberlain of Chester and Sheriff of Flintshire. He fought for the Yorkists at Hexham in 1466 and was given the Lordship and Castle of Skipton in Yorkshire which he subsequently exchanged for Chirk. He obtained additional land following the battle of Towton. After the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 he took the news to Queen Margaret of her son's death and then took her to Coventry.\n\nEdward IV's successor, Richard III, courted Sir William's support by various grants of manors and by appointing him Chief Justice for North Wales and Chief Commissioner for Shropshire. Sir William was suspicious of Richard because of the disappearance of the two princes and changed his allegiance to Henry Tudor. At the Battle of Bosworth Field, Stanley rescued Henry at a critical moment in the battle, struck down the King and is said to have found his crown in a thorn bush. He handed the crown to his elder brother Thomas who put it on the head of Henry Tudor. Henry VII appointed Sir William Stanley the Lord Chamberlain and Knight of the Garter and granted him additional lands that made him the richest commoner in England. Sir William's wealth and power inevitably attracted enemies and he was disappointed that his services had not led to a peerage. In 1489 he became Constable of Caernarvon and Beaumaris, and in 1490 Henry VII gave him the Lordships of Bromfield, Chirk and the castles of Dinas Bran, Holt and Chirk in confirmation ofearlier grants of the latter two by Richard III.\n\nSir William as Lord Chancellor was arbitrator in the dispute between Sir John Stanley of Elford and his half-brother Sir Humphrey, mentioned above. He then bought the manors of Aldford and Nether Alderley in Cheshire from Sir John. Sir William was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1494, on suspicion of being involved in the rebellion of Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be the younger of the \"princes in the tower\" and therefore heir to Edward IV. At that time it was not known that the sons of Edward IV had both been murdered. Although Sir William had helped put Henry VII on the throne he was known to have been a strong supporter of Edward IV. He was quoted as saying that if Perkin Warbeck was the son of Edward IV he would not fight against him. This, and his unwillingness to confirm or deny his guilt, was sufficient to see him executed at the Tower on 16 Feb 1495.\n\nElizabeth Hopton1 [914] and William Stanley had the following children:\n\n+115\n\nJane Stanley (c. 1463- ) [910]\n\n+116\n\nWilliam Stanley (1470-1498) [916]\n\n93.
