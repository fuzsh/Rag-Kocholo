        "text": "PART ONE\n\nTHE ACCESSION OF EDWARD II\n\nEdward I died on 7 July 1307, the feast of the Translation of St Thomas of Canterbury.1 On the following day, which counted as the first day of the new reign, urgent messages were sent to Prince Edward, the queen, and the earl of Lincoln to tell them the news.2Edward was in or near London when he received the news of his father's death on 11 July,3 and immediately set out for Carlisle which he reached on the 18th. In the meantime the old king's death was kept secret, presumably to avoid giving encouragement to the Scots, and anyone who spread news of it was imprisoned.4 On 19 July Edward went to Burgh-on-Sands ‘to weep for his father’,5 and on the following day he was proclaimed king at Carlisle castle. ‘And therefore the younger Edward succeeded the elder, but in the way in which Rehoboam succeeded Solomon, as events were to prove.’6\n\nDespite the speed with which Edward learned of his accession, the news did not reach the capital formally until Tuesday, 25 July. Until then Edward I's chancellor, Ralph Baldock, the bishop of London, continued to seal writs with the Great Seal, ‘because he had no certain knowledge of the king's death before that day’. The chancellor acted with the advice of members of the old king's council but, significantly, was also assisted by the two senior members of Prince Edward's household, William of Blyburgh his chancellor and Walter Reynolds, keeper of his wardrobe. On Saturday, 29 July, Baldock received letters from Edward recording that Anthony Bek the bishop of Durham, Henry de Lacy the earl of Lincoln, and other earls and barons who had gathered at Carlisle in readiness for the planned campaign in Scotland had done homage and fealty to him there as king, and ordering the chancellor to send him his father's seal. This was duly done on Tuesday, 2 August.7 In the meantime, on 22 July, at Carlisle Edward II had issued his first document as king under ‘the privy seal which we used before we undertook the government of the kingdom’.8\n\nOn 31 July Edward II left Carlisle for Scotland and on 4 August arrived in Dumfries where he took the homage and fealty of the remaining Scottish supporters of the English crown.9 Also at Dumfries, on 6 August, Edward issued the first charter of his reign, creating his friend and ‘brother’ Piers Gaveston earl of Cornwall. It was to be one of the most fateful decisions of his career.\n\nTHE RETURN AND PROMOTION OF GAVESTON\n\nWhen Edward I died Gaveston was still in comfortable exile in Ponthieu. The question immediately arose of what would happen to him next. The oaths which Gaveston and Edward had taken the previous February provided for the possibility of Gaveston's recall to England at the king's pleasure. But according to the anonymous author of the Brut chronicle, Edward I had on his deathbed enjoined the earls of Lincoln, Warwick and Pembroke, and Robert de Clifford, to look after the welfare of his son and, above all, not to allow Gaveston to return and lead Edward into a life of riot.10 While it is possible that Edward I's attitude towards Gaveston had hardened during his brief period of exile, this statement should not necessarily be taken at its face value any more than Walter of Guisborough's highly misleading account of the circumstances leading up to the exile. The earl of Lincoln and the others were in any case among Edward I's main councillors and it was to be expected that they would be asked to give their support to the new king. The new king's pleasure was of course all too certain. Edward II's letters recalling Gaveston were probably sent on or soon after 11 July when Edward first heard of his father's death; and Gaveston himself probably arrived back in England in early August.11 From London he travelled swiftly to Carlisle and from there to Scotland, where he rejoined Edward. Gaveston does not appear to have been at Dumfries on 6 August, the date of his creation as earl of Cornwall, but he was certainly at Sanquhar, 25 miles north-west of Dumfries, by 17 August.12\n\nDespite claims in the Annales Paulini that the earls burnt it when Gaveston went into exile for the second time in 1308, the original charter creating Gaveston earl of Cornwall still survives.13 In a brilliant piece of research Pierre Chaplais discovered that the charter was not written by a clerk of the chancery, as would be usual, but by Thomas de Neuhay, a clerk of Edward II's wardrobe. He also deduced that, although the charter was probably ordered on 6 August and may even have been written on that date, it could not have been sealed then, since the seal used was Edward I's Great Seal, which had been sent from London on 2 August at the king's orders. On arrival in Scotland the seal had been modified, probably by a local goldsmith, for use in the new reign, and was employed for Gaveston's charter. The latest possible date on which this could have been done was 17 August, after which the Great Seal was no longer with the king.14 Chaplais is surely right in his conclusion that Edward II ordered the Great Seal to be sent from London to Scotland with the sole purpose of using it to authenticate Gaveston's creation as earl. This implies that Edward had decided that the promotion of Gaveston would be his first act when he became king,15 and supports the suggestion in the previous chapter that the earldom of Cornwall rather than the county of Ponthieu was the source of the estrangement between Edward and his father earlier in 1307. Gaveston's charter was witnessed by no fewer than seven earls: Lincoln, Lancaster, Surrey, Hereford, Arundel, Richmond and Pembroke. It is hard to believe that they would have allowed their names to be attached if they had not actively approved or at least consented to Gaveston's elevation.16 However, the absence of the earl of Warwick from the witness list may have been an early indication of his future hostility to Gaveston.17 On 17 August Gaveston celebrated his new status with a feast at Sanquhar which was attended by the king, the earls of Lincoln and Hereford, and the earl of Lancaster, one of whose minstrels also performed.18 On 1 November Gaveston's status was even further enhanced when he married Edward II's niece, Margaret, the sister of Gilbert de Clare the young earl of Gloucester. The ceremony held at Berkhamsted was attended by the king and a number of leading magnates, and was followed by another lavish feast.19\n\nTAKING UP THE THRONE\n\nFrom Sanquhar Edward II moved to nearby Cumnock on about 20 August. According to a later and unreliable tradition, Edward I had called his son to his side and made him swear that on his death ‘he would have his body boiled in a large cauldron until the flesh could be separated from the bones; that he would have the flesh buried, and the bones preserved, and that every time the Scots should rebel against him he would summon his people, and carry with him the bones of his father; for he believed most firmly, that as long as his bones should be carried against the Scots, those Scots would never be victorious’.20 As Michael Prestwich has remarked, this reflects Edward's later reputation, rather than recording a genuine deathbed scene.21 Edward II's movements were not however the prelude to the great campaign which his father had planned. By early September he was back at Carlisle, having first appointed Aymer de Valence as the English commander in Scotland and then on 13 September replacing him with the earl of Richmond.22 Edward left Carlisle and moved south via York, spending most of the second part of September at the royal manor of Clipstone in Nottinghamshire. In mid-October he spent some days at his favourite retreat, Langley in Hertfordshire, and was back at Westminster by 27 October.\n\nEdward II did not appear in Scotland again for another three years and in the meantime the English position there had begun the almost irreversible slide which ultimately led to Scottish independence. Yet it was not, as Geoffrey Barrow has argued, the result of exchanging ‘the masterful directing hand’ of Edward I for ‘the wilful insouciance of the new king’.23 Edward II was not a reluctant warrior but he had good and urgent political, financial and personal reasons for abandoning the campaign in Scotland.\n\nTHE FALL OF LANGTON\n\nPolitical and financial concerns overlapped in the person of Walter Langton, bishop of Coventry & Lichfield, who had been treasurer and one of the most influential royal advisers since 1295. During that period the royal finances and their administration had deteriorated under the pressures of war into a state of confusion. Although the overall picture could not then be known, it is now estimated that the crown had debts of about £200,000 at the time of Edward I's death and that as much as £60,000 of this was outstanding as late as the 1320s.24 What could not be in any doubt was that the king owed money to many people, ranging ‘from his officials and bankers at one end of the spectrum to infantry soldiers and workmen at the other’. While they might tolerate this situation under a king whom they respected and feared and in aid of a war in Scotland, for which there was general support,25 their toleration was unlikely to extend to a new and untried king. No individual, however powerful, could really be blamed for the mounting financial problems, but Walter Langton was an obvious target, especially since the new king had personal scores of his own to settle with him.\n\nEdward II's determination to bring down Langton therefore came second only to his determination to promote Gaveston. Langton was arrested by three knights acting on the direct orders of the king on about 7 August at Waltham in Essex.26 He ceased to act formally as treasurer on 19 August and was replaced three days later by Walter Reynolds, Edward's old ally and the keeper of his wardrobe as Prince of Wales.27 Langton was first imprisoned at Wallingford, then at Windsor, and finally in the Tower of London; his lands were seized and his personal treasure found and paid into the wardrobe;28 his debts were collected on behalf of the crown; and on 4 October a proclamation was issued in the names of Gaveston and Reynolds inviting individuals to present their grievances against Langton. The proceedings that followed lasted until 1310–11 and produced ample evidence of corruption and abuse of office.29 This completed the fall of a mighty minister, who had exercised power on a scale comparable with a Tudor official, and who had even built himself a palace modelled on Edward II's birthplace at Caernarfon.30\n\nLangton's treasure was not sufficient to meet Edward II's financial needs. Writs of summons for a parliament to meet at Northampton on 13 October had already been issued at Cumnock on 26 August even before the new king left Scotland.31 The first item of business appears to have been to secure a grant of taxation, which was duly made by the laity on 13 October. The clergy made a separate grant, possibly following an agreement by the king that Robert Winchelsey, the archbishop of Canterbury, who had gone into exile after falling out with Edward I, could return to England.32 The taxation was urgently needed to finance the continuing war with Scotland,33 to which the earl of Hereford and fifteen other magnates were sent on 18 October.34 But money was also necessary to pay for the costs first of Edward I's funeral, the date of which was probably settled at Northampton,35 and then of Edward II's marriage and coronation which were also discussed there.36\n\nTHE FUNERAL OF EDWARD I\n\nEdward I's body had first been brought from Burgh-on-Sands to Richmond in Yorkshire and afterwards to Waltham abbey in Essex where it lay for over two months.37 On about 18 October the body was taken to London and then to Westminster Abbey,38 where the funeral service was held on 27 October.39 The ceremony was presided over and the eulogy delivered by Anthony Bek, the bishop of Durham and patriarch of Jerusalem, an old companion and a recent adversary of Edward I,40 but also a good friend of Edward II who was to play an important role in the early years of the new reign.41 He was assisted by the bishops of Winchester and Lincoln who read the Gospel and the Epistle.42 Edward I was remembered elsewhere: the news of his death on 7 July reached Pope Clement V at Poitiers two weeks later and here the pope performed solemn obsequies for him, exalting ‘the strength of his rule, his sense of justice and clemency, his crusading fervour, and his many successes against all enemies’. This was a unique papal tribute in honour of a secular ruler.43 In sharp contrast to the fine effigy and elaborate tomb which were to be constructed over Edward II's body in the 1330s, Edward I was laid in a simple tomb of polished Purbeck marble without an effigy, except for a wooden figure which may have lain on the coffin during the funeral service. Wax candles were kept burning around the tomb and were maintained both by Edward II and by his successors.44 The reason for the simplicity of the tomb is unknown, but it was ‘plainly intentional’ and ‘cannot be attributed to Edward II's fecklessness’.45 There is nothing to tell us of Edward's behaviour or demeanour at his father's funeral but for him it was the second family bereavement in a few months, his sister Joan of Acre, countess of Gloucester, to whom he was very close, having died the previous April.46\n\nMARRIAGE AT LAST\n\nEdward II's marriage to Isabella of France was also a major issue. It had first been agreed in the Treaty of Montreuil in 1299; Edward and Isabella had been betrothed in 1303 following the Treaty of Paris; and twice, in 1305 and earlier in 1307, it had appeared that the marriage would soon take place. On each occasion it had been delayed because of the failure of English and French negotiators to settle outstanding problems over Aquitaine and over the details of the marriage agreement. To make matters even more urgent, Isabella would soon be twelve years old and the canonical age to marry. Edward II would have to make good his promise to marry her or repudiate the contract and provoke a crisis in Anglo-French relations which might even lead to a renewal of war in Gascony.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that Edward II was for any reason unwilling to proceed with the marriage, whether through personal antipathy, the influence of Gaveston or the opinion of any of his advisers.47 But, like his father, he first wanted to be sure that the terms offered by France would be sufficient, and a final period of intensive negotiation therefore began. A memorandum drawn up by Philip IV's advisers and sent to England early in the autumn of 1307 shows that Edward II had hoped that Isabella would bring with her a handsome marriage portion and that he hoped that Philip would compromise over such long-standing problems as appeals to the Paris parlement against the decisions of Gascon judges. Philip IV replied bluntly that he was giving with his daughter the duchy of Aquitaine and all Edward's continental lands, which had been properly forfeited to the French crown. This was her portion, and the king of England should be pleased to have it. Had it not been for the marriage and the French king's hopes to see a grandchild hold the lands, he would never have considered relinquishing them. Philip even threatened to charge Edward with the costs of administering his continental territories while they were in French hands and in the last resort to declare the duchy of Aquitaine forfeit once more, as he had done in 1294.48\n\nOn 6 November Edward appointed the bishops of Durham and Norwich, the earls of Lincoln and Pembroke, and others to go to France to agree the terms of Isabella's dower and to conclude other outstanding matters. The delegation arrived at Boulogne, which had evidently already been agreed as the location of the marriage ceremony, on 25 November, at the same time as a section of the royal household which had been sent ahead to make the necessary arrangements.49 In December Edward made his way to the Channel coast in preparation for the crossing to France. He spent Christmas with Gaveston at Wye in Kent, a manor belonging to the abbot of Battle, and on 26 December appointed Gaveston to be custos regni in his absence.50 A letter from Edward II to Philip IV dated at Canterbury on 30 December shows that discussions about the marriage were continuing until the last moment. In reply to a proposal from Philip, whom he already addressed as ‘our most dear lord and father’, Edward agreed that they should both arrive at Boulogne on Sunday, 21 January, and that the marriage should take place on Wednesday, 24 January 1308.51\n\nBy the middle of January Edward was at Dover where he made a series of important decisions preparatory to leaving for France. On 18 January Gaveston's authority as custos regni was defined as including the power ‘to issue licences to elect, grant royal assents, make restitution of temporalities, collate and present to prebends and other ecclesiastical offices, and deal with wardships and marriage during the king's absence from the kingdom’.52 On the same date the leading clergy, earls and barons were commanded to attend Edward II's coronation at Westminster on 18 February; and on 19 January further orders were issued for a parliament to meet at Westminster on 3 March.53\n\nIn the event the king crossed to France on 22 January, a day later than planned.54 The slight delay in the crossing was probably caused by something as simple as the weather or by last-minute bargaining on the dower that Edward II would present to his wife on their wedding day, and there is no reason to suppose any deliberate discourtesy on Edward's part.55 On 24 January Edward II agreed to increase the value of Isabella's dower from the sum of 18,000 livres tournois (£4,500), initially agreed as far back as 1299, to 20,000 livres tournois (£5,000). The dower was to be drawn from the revenues of the county of Ponthieu, with the addition of revenue from the Agenais in Aquitaine and in England if these were insufficient. Philip IV tried unsuccessfully to make Edward seal a document in which the undertakings concerning the dower were to be made to Philip himself and not to Isabella.56 On 31 January Edward II performed his long-delayed homage to Philip IV for the duchy of Aquitaine and also for the county of Ponthieu, and the Treaty of Paris of 1303 was confirmed.57 A commission was appointed to settle mutual problems arising from the recent war, but for his pains Edward was also presented with a lengthy list of complaints about the government of his continental lands.58\n\nIn the midst of all this hard and probably acrimonious bargaining a wedding ceremony did in fact take place on 25 January in the cathedral church of Notre Dame in Boulogne.59 The details of the occasion are not recorded but it is known that it was attended by many European figures of the highest rank: as well as Philip IV himself, there were three future kings of France, his three sons, Louis, Philip and Charles, and their wives; Philip IV's brothers, Charles of Valois and Louis of Evreux; Louis de Clermont, Hugh de Bourgogne and his brothers, Robert count of Flanders and his brothers, the lord of Nesle, the count of Namur, John duke of Brabant and his wife Margaret (Edward II's sister), the count of Hainault, Robert of Artois, Louis count of Nevers, Guy count of St Pol, the count of Dreux, and the count of Savoy; as well as many archbishops and bishops.60 Those present on the English side are not named directly but certainly included important figures such as Edward I's widow, Queen Margaret who was Philip IV's sister and Isabella's aunt; Anthony Bek, the bishop of Durham and patriarch of Jerusalem; Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke (who had close French connections of his own); the earls of Lincoln, Surrey and Hereford; and important baronial figures and royal councillors such as Hugh Despenser and Robert de Clifford. Edward II hosted a celebration of the marriage (festum generale post nupcias Regis) on Sunday, 28 January, and on Tuesday, 30 January, the brothers of the king of France and many French nobles dined with him and his new queen.61 Philip IV presented his daughter with lavish wedding gifts of jewels, plate, furs, robes and other furnishings, worth a total of over 21,000 livres,62 and gave the cathedral a gilded silver reliquary containing a fragment of the True Cross,63while Edward's wedding gift to his new wife was probably the fine illuminated manuscript now known as the Isabella Psalter.64\n\nGAVESTON AND EDWARD: ‘TWO KINGS IN ONE REALM’?\n\nEdward and Isabella left Boulogne on 2 or 3 February and crossed in separate vessels to Dover, where they landed on the 7th. On 9 February Gaveston's term of office as custos regni formally ended when the Great Seal, which Edward had taken with him to France, was restored to the chancellor.65 However Gaveston's arrogant behaviour, his relations with the king and his supposed influence over the government of the kingdom were such lively issues that the author of the Vita Edwardi Secundi remarked of Gaveston's appointment as custos regni, ‘What an astonishing thing, he who was lately an exile and outcast from England has now been made governor and keeper of the same land.’66 The St Paul's annalist wrote that there were ‘two kings reigning in one kingdom, one in name and the other in deed’, while the Vita spoke of Gaveston as ‘a second king’.67 The chroniclers were uniformly hostile and, like today's tabloids, fed on any gossip about Gaveston that was going and when in doubt exaggerated or made it up. Gaveston was accused of having pillaged the royal treasury, with the active connivance of the king, and of sending vast sums of money to his native Gascony, with the connivance of foreign merchants.68 It was also believed that the taxation granted by parliament in August 1307 had been misused and squandered by Gaveston69 and that the treasure and other valuables seized from the disgraced treasurer, Walter Langton, had been given to him by the king.70 Much was also made of the fact that Edward had sent Philip IV's wedding presents to Gaveston in England, even before his own return from France.71 Gaveston's appointment as custos regni was in itself a cause of outrage among the nobility, since this was a position that was usually reserved for a king's son or other close relative.72 Gaveston was also accused of using his authority to his own advantage, most notably by interfering in the election of a new abbot of Westminster.73 Gaveston did himself no good in the eyes of his fellow earls when on 2 December 1307 he held a tournament at his castle of Wallingford to celebrate his marriage, at which he and ‘almost all the younger and harder knights of the kingdom, whom persuasion or reward could bring together’ roundly defeated the earls of Arundel, Hereford and Surrey and their followers.74\n\nSome of the charges that were levelled against Gaveston were inaccurate and malicious. There is no evidence that he plundered royal treasure and sent money abroad, or that he profited financially from the fall of Walter Langton, although he did receive sums of money from the wardrobe at intervals in 1308.75 There are a few examples of Gaveston using his access to the king to influence the flow of patronage, but he appears to have exercised his powers as custos regni during the king's absence in France in late January and early February 1308 with caution and circumspection.76 Yet his behaviour towards his fellow earls at this time aroused great enmity against him. ‘He adopted such a proud manner of bearing towards them, that the earls coming before him to discuss business were forced to kneel in order to bring their reasons before him, because he did not value them and did not heed the advice of the sage who said: “A sudden reverse awaits those who, raised high in pride from poverty, know neither reason nor measure and have no care”’. 77 When Edward II was greeted by his leading magnates at Dover on his return from France he caused offence and added still further to the hostility against Gaveston by allegedly running to him and ‘giving him kisses and repeated embraces’.78 Even allowing for some exaggeration, there is no reason to doubt the general accuracy of the picture recorded by the chroniclers.\n\nPierre Chaplais has convincingly argued that the description in some of the chronicles of Gaveston as Edward II's camerarius79 should be understood as referring to Gaveston's formal appointment to the office of chamberlain, or administrative head of the king's chamber, rather than simply to a position of familiarity. He also suggests that this appointment took place between Gaveston's creation as earl of Cornwall in August 1307 and the holding of parliament at Northampton the following October, and that it formed a precedent for the appointment of the Younger Despenser to the same office later in the reign.80 If this were the case, it would then be legitimate for valuables, such as Philip IV's wedding gifts, to be sent to Gaveston, ‘who also happened to be at the time keeper of the realm’, for safe lodgement in the king's chamber. Chaplais also argues that in doing so Edward II did not intend to insult Philip IV.81 This may have been the case, but it is also worth remembering Philip IV's parsimony towards his daughter and son-in-law: Edward may therefore have been making a point after all.82 On the other hand Edward II's judgement was seriously at fault if he thought that he could make the man he regarded as his brother into the holder of an earldom closely associated with the crown, appoint him as chamberlain with custody of his most valuable possessions, and also give him the office of custos regni, without arousing hostility both among the English nobility and among a wider public. It was also all too easy for opponents to place whatever spin they wished on Gaveston's activities, especially when Gaveston himself went out of his way to create animosity. To make matters even worse, Edward II had succeeded in arousing the anger of his father-in-law, who was becoming determined that Gaveston should be removed from England, and probably also the hostility of his new wife Isabella.\n\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF REFORM\n\nOn 31 January 1308, the day on which Edward II performed homage for the duchy of Aquitaine, another significant event took place at Boulogne when the bishop of Durham, the earls of Lincoln, Surrey, Pembroke and Hereford, Robert de Clifford and several other magnates and royal administrators sealed an agreement in which they declared that they were bound by fealty to preserve the king's honour and the rights of his crown, undertook to do everything possible to protect and maintain the king's honour, and promised to redress and amend everything that had been done against the king's honour in the past (avant ces heurs) and all forms of oppression against the king's subjects which had occurred and were still happening from day to day.83 None of the parties to the agreement was personally hostile to the king and it is likely that they were thinking chiefly of the consequences of the continuing inconclusive war with Scotland, which had overstretched the royal administration, left the monarchy heavily in debt, and created political tensions between the king and his subjects, who objected to excessive taxation and administrative abuses. These were serious issues, which had been partially suppressed in the closing years of the reign of Edward I but which were bound to resurface in a new reign with a less experienced and less formidable monarch at the helm. It was a good moment, with the coronation due in a few weeks' time, to offer Edward the possibility of achieving financial and administrative reform with the support and encouragement of a group of experienced and loyal subjects. There is nothing to suggest that the Boulogne Declaration was directed against Edward II personally. Neither was it aimed directly against Gaveston in any obvious way, although his behaviour and influence must certainly have been in the minds of those who agreed to it. It is possible too that, in promising to preserve the king's honour and the rights of his crown, they also had in mind the pressures which were then being applied against Edward II by his new father-in-law, Philip IV.84 The Boulogne Declaration was essentially designed to help Edward rather than impose restraints upon him, but the warning signs were there and the benign reform programme foreshadowed at Boulogne and possibly, as suggested below, acceptable to Edward II was soon followed by demands for reform of a much more far-reaching and personal kind.85\n\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE CORONATION\n\nEdward II's plans for his coronation began with splendid intentions but ended in discord and scandal. The palace of Westminster had suffered damage in a fire in 1298 and from subsequent neglect arising from Edward I's lack of money and frequent absences in Scotland. When Edward II succeeded to the throne in 1307 ‘he inherited a half-ruined palace’: everywhere, apart from the Great Hall and the king's own chamber, ‘there were blackened walls, rotten timbers, broken windows and mouldering plaster’.86 Repair work began almost at once and continued even after dark by the light of candles. ‘So many men were at work that a great horn had to be blown to summon them in the morning and to dismiss them in the evening.’87 The Painted Chamber was retiled and work began, under the supervision of the king's painter Thomas of Westminster, on the restoration of its wall paintings depicting the coronation of St Edward the Confessor and scenes from the Old Testament. Master Thomas also painted two wooden leopards which stood on the gables of the Lesser Hall of the palace and which held metal banners bearing the king's arms. Around the same time a temporary chapel of St Stephen was set up in a building attached to the exchequer to provide a place of worship for the palace. Statues of St Mary and St Stephen were painted and gilded by Master Adam the Imager and placed on two standards.88 Altogether more than £3,000 was spent on repairs and embellishments to Westminster Palace during the first year of Edward II's reign.89\n\nTemporary buildings were constructed for the day of the coronation. A timber hall extending the whole length of the river wall by the palace and at least 500 feet long was built for the ceremony of the king's enthronement, and was specially strengthened to withstand the pressure of people wishing to see the king upon his throne. The throne was repaired and above it in an arch stood a statue of a king cast in copper and gilded. Fourteen smaller halls were built parallel to the ‘strong and solemn hall’ and extended almost to the gate of the palace, leaving only just enough room for men on foot and on horseback to enter. Forty ovens were built to cook the coronation banquet and ‘every vacant space in the palace and the nearby abbey was filled with forms, trestles and tables’. A fountain, ‘flowing day and night with red and white wine and a spiced drink known as pimento’, and fed by underground lead pipes, was installed.90 For the banquet in Westminster Hall there were two high tables, each with a marble top, one of which was renewed for the occasion.91 Inside Westminster Abbey itself a wooden staging was built in the middle of the choir. The chairs in which Edward II and Isabella would be crowned were set up on this platform which was so high ‘that men at arms could ride on horseback beneath it without stooping’.92 The sedilia paintings in Westminster Abbey, depicting two unidentified kings, were probably also made by Master Thomas of Westminster for Edward II's coronation.93\n\nTHE CORONATION\n\nThe ceremony was originally due to take place in Westminster Abbey on 18 February, a significant date since it was also the feast of the Translation of St Edward the Confessor and probably chosen for that reason. The coronation was however delayed at the last moment until 25 February. This was ostensibly to allow the archbishop of Canterbury more time to come back to England in order to perform the ceremony94 but, according to the Annales Paulini, the leading English magnates and the French magnates who had come to England for the coronation refused to allow the ceremony to proceed unless Gaveston was first banished from the kingdom. Edward II was not prepared to concede this but he temporized by allegedly agreeing ‘in good faith to undertake whatever they sought in the next parliament’, which was due to meet on 3 March.95 It has also been suggested that another reason for the delay was a disagreement between the king and the magnates about the form of the oath which Edward II would take at his coronation. This topic has exercised historians for many years and this is not the place to rehearse all the arguments put forward.96 Briefly, the debate centres on the purpose of the clause which was added to the oath in 1308, and in which Edward swore to uphold ‘the rightful laws and customs which the community of the realm shall have chosen’.97 The wording could mean that Edward was being asked to promise that he would accept future legislation which might be imposed upon him and limit his freedom of action. On the other hand, the clause might be intended to avoid a repetition of the actions of Edward I, who had a habit of going back on his promises and who in 1305 had obtained a papal decree releasing him from his undertakings.98\n\nThere is however an alternative view of the coronation and of the coronation oath.99 It is possible that the position of Gaveston and the need for reform were initially at least two entirely separate matters; that, as R.S. Hoyt argued, there was ‘no certain connexion between political events and the oath’;100 and that ‘Edward II, in an attempt to foster an atmosphere of political amity and cooperation at the beginning of his reign, sought means to restore the rapport between crown and magnates which had been eroded under Edward I.’101 Although H.G. Richardson's suggestion that a clause similar to the one added to the oath taken by Edward II in 1308 had already been part of his father's oath in 1274 can now be shown to be incorrect,102 his argument that the revision of the coronation order which is known to have taken place at the beginning of Edward II's reign, and consequently of the coronation oath as a part of the order, was undertaken in a leisurely and considered manner should be taken seriously.103 It is possible, for example, that the Boulogne Declaration of 31 January arose out of a discussion between the king and some of his leading councillors on the form of the forthcoming coronation and in particular of the coronation oath. It may be significant that several of those who were parties to the Boulogne agreement, the earls of Lincoln, Pembroke and Hereford, played a formal part in the coronation ceremony, while Robert de Clifford, who had been appointed marshal of England on about 3 September 1307 was responsible for the organization of Edward II's coronation.104 In effect they were offering the new king their support in reforming the royal administration and removing the sources of grievance left over from the reign of Edward I. In return Edward II would accept a new form of coronation oath. In addition to swearing to uphold the existing laws, described symbolically as the laws of St Edward the Confessor,105 he would also agree to maintain future legislation provided that it was properly approved by himself and the community of the realm. If this line of argument is correct, the coronation oath was not revised with any revolutionary intention but by agreement and without external political pressure from the English magnates. Edward II was in effect offering a coronation charter, such as earlier kings up to Henry III had issued at their accession.106 This would mean that he would not try to evade his undertakings as his father Edward I had done and that he would offer hope for an orderly redress of grievances in the future. It is therefore arguable that Edward II hoped to make his coronation an occasion of reconciliation as well as one of public display.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to demonstrate any personal contribution by Edward II to the coronation order and its revision, it is likely that he also wanted the coronation to give a particular emphasis to the sacred quality of his monarchy: not only by his choice of 18 February as the original date for the coronation, but by the reference to the laws of St Edward in his coronation oath, the fact that he would take his oath in close proximity to the shrine of St Edward, and the use of items of regalia associated with St Edward in the coronation ceremony.107 It has also been suggested that the music associated with the coronation was intended to lay further stress on the holiness of the English monarchy, especially perhaps in the presence of members of the French royal house, whose own family saint, Louis IX, had been canonized as recently as 1297.108\n\nThe coronation may have been delayed, as the Annales Paulini claims, following threats from some of the English and French magnates, but the account in the annals is inclined to exaggeration and tends to telescope fast-moving and highly emotive events.109 It is also both interesting and probably very significant that the well-informed and perceptive author of the Vita Edwardi Secundi, who is scathing in his criticism of Gaveston's behaviour before the coronation and gives a detailed account of the baronial movement against Gaveston in its immediate aftermath, provides a very different description of the event itself. He says nothing about the coronation being postponed because of dissension between the king and the magnates, and reports that the ceremony was conducted by the bishop of Winchester ‘at the command and with the assent of the archbishop of Canterbury’ who was ‘prevented from being present by illness or continued absence abroad’. All that the Vita says of the occasion is that ‘at the conclusion of the ceremony and the joyful wedding feast everyone went home’.110 The ceremony may genuinely have been postponed in the hope that the archbishop of Canterbury might still return to England in time to preside. But if Edward had intended his coronation to bring peace and harmony, he was to be disappointed. In practice it was impossible to separate the two great issues of Gaveston and reform. Edward was soon to find himself faced with demands which went beyond what he believed he had sworn to at his coronation.111\n\nThe coronation took place amidst the crush of people that was inseparable from great events and probably took away some of its intended dignity and majesty. John Bakewell, a knight and former seneschal of Ponthieu, was killed when a wall collapsed; the king himself was allegedly forced to leave the palace via a back door on his way to the abbey in order to avoid the crowds; and the ceremony was, again allegedly, conducted in haste by the bishop of Winchester, assisted by the bishops of Salisbury and Chichester.112It was attended by many distinguished foreign guests including Isabella's uncles, Charles count of Valois and Louis count of Évreux; her brother Charles, the future Charles IV of France; John duke of Brabant and his wife Margaret, Edward II's sister; the duke of Brittany; Count Henry of Luxemburg (soon to become the emperor Henry VII); and the counts of St Pol and Savoy.113 Edward's half-brothers Thomas and Edmund were there, as was his sister Mary.114 The English earls, barons and knights of the shire and their wives were also present in force by royal summons. Many of the earls played a part in the coronation itself: the king's sceptre was borne by the earl of Hereford, the sword curtana by the earl of Lancaster and two other swords by the earls of Lincoln and Warwick; the royal vestments were carried by the earl of Arundel and others including Hugh Despenser and Roger Mortimer of Wigmore; Charles of Valois put the boot and spur on Edward's right foot. Some of those who took such a public part were to play just as conspicuous a role in the politics of the reign as they unfolded in the weeks and months to come, none more so than the earls of Lincoln and Lancaster, and of course the bitterly resented earl of Cornwall, Piers Gaveston, whose involvement in the coronation was all too conspicuous. He redeemed the sword curtana after the king made an offering of a pound of gold at the high altar; he carried the crown of St Edward before the king; the earl of Pembroke placed the boot on the king's left foot but it was Gaveston who then attached the spur.115\n\nThe annoyance that was probably caused by Gaveston's prominent place in the coronation ceremony was magnified by his behaviour during the banquet which followed. Gaveston was clothed in purple trimmed with pearls; the king allegedly preferred the company of Gaveston to that of his new wife and queen;116 while above them hung specially made tapestries bearing not the arms of England and France but those of Edward II and Gaveston.117 Isabella's relatives were enraged by her treatment, and one of the English earls allegedly wished to kill Gaveston on the spot.118\n\nTHE EXILE OF GAVESTON\n\nBy the end of February 1308 a major crisis in the affairs of the English crown was fast developing, a crisis for which Edward II bore much of the responsibility. It is possible to show that many of the more extravagant charges against Gaveston were ill founded and that the relationship between him and Edward was probably based on a deeply felt sense of brotherhood. It is also fair to note that although Edward had been expecting to marry Isabella since 1299, his new wife and queen was little more than a child whom he still barely knew. Isabella could not for some time to come be a companion and partner in either the emotional or sexual sense. Edward also had outstanding problems in his relations with Isabella's father, over her dower and over Aquitaine. Nonetheless Edward's lavishing of favour upon Gaveston, Gaveston's behaviour and Edward's neglect of Isabella were bound to lead to disaffection in England and to a souring of relations with France. All of this was avoidable. Edward II had spent the early months of his reign with good intentions with regard to reconciliation and reform yet he dissipated goodwill and turned friends into potential enemies by his obsessive attachment to Gaveston.\n\nThe intense excitement, the crowds of people gathered in and around Westminster, and the tensions generated during the coronation and the festivities which followed ensured that any crisis would swiftly come to a head. Such a situation arose almost at once with the parliament that had been summoned to meet at Westminster on 3 March. The earls and barons who were to attend were already of course at Westminster for the coronation and so had plenty of opportunity to lay their plans.119\n\nThe Annales Paulini records that the parliament met on 28 February and not 3 March,120 which suggests that the heated atmosphere created by the events surrounding the coronation forced the king to allow parliament to start several days earlier than planned. The fact that it met in the monks' refectory of Westminster Abbey rather than within the king's Palace of Westminster also suggests that the magnates went ahead with a meeting at a place and time of their own choosing, and that the king had no option but to agree. It appears that the king, continuing in the spirit of goodwill with which he had approached his coronation, invited the magnates to discuss ‘the state of the Church, the state of the Crown which he had newly assumed and how it ought to be governed according to God and to justice, and how the peace of the land might be preserved for his people’. The magnates apparently refused to do this unless they were given a written commission and the king promised to accept their proposals. The parliament ended inconclusively on or shortly before 10 March, when it was ordered to reconvene on 28 April.121 It appears that the earl of Lincoln, who had earlier been a supporter of the king, was already beginning to take a leading role in opposing him, while his son-in-law the earl of Lancaster who was later to lead the opposition was still loyal.122 The real target of the magnates' actions was obviously Gaveston, and his removal from England would have to be conceded before they were prepared to consider any other issues.\n\nPolitical tension increased sharply in the weeks before the reconvened parliament on 28 April and for a time there was a very real danger of civil war. Between 12 and 18 March Edward II appointed new and loyal custodians, including Gaveston and Hugh Despenser the Elder, to a dozen important castles, and on 19 March repairs were hastily put in hand to the Tower of London. On 31 March the king arrived at Windsor castle, where he remained until his return to Westminster for the meeting of parliament on 28 April. Windsor itself was put in a state of defence, while the bridges across the Thames at Staines and Kingston were broken. From his own stronghold at nearby Wallingford, where the king had spent two days on the way to Windsor, Gaveston was also gathering his forces. He then joined Edward for Easter (14 April) at Windsor, where if necessary he and Edward could hold out against a baronial army. The king controlled many of the strongest fortresses in the kingdom but few of the leading magnates supported him, with the exception of the earl of Lancaster and the uninfluential earls of Richmond and Oxford.123 In the meantime the earls had gathered at the earl of Lincoln's castle at Pontefract in Yorkshire to debate what to do next. The result of their deliberations was a document, which was to be presented at the forthcoming parliament. Lincoln was however a moderating influence and it was largely due to him that civil war did not break out in the spring of 1308.124\n\nAccording to the Annales Paulini, the earls and barons came to parliament fully armed, but only for self-defence. The king remained in the palace of Westminster while the earls, as on the previous occasion in February, were in Westminster Abbey.125 There was an immediate demand for the exile of Gaveston and the confiscation of his lands; and in order to provide a legal justification for this, the earl of Lincoln presented the document that had been drawn up at Pontefract. The first of the three articles distinguished between the king and his office by declaring that ‘homage and the oath of allegiance (homage et serment) are more in respect of the crown than in respect of the king's person … And, therefore, if it should befall that the king is not guided by reason, then, in order that the dignity of the crown may be preserved the lieges are bound by the oath made to the crown to reinstate the king in the dignity of the crown’. Since it was not possible to reinstate the king by recourse to legal action, because the judges were the king's, ‘the evil must be removed by constraint’. The second article stated that ‘as regards the person who is talked about [i.e. Gaveston], the people ought to judge him as one not to be suffered because he disinherits the crown and, as far as he is able, impoverishes it. By his counsel he withdraws the king from the counsel of his realm and puts discord between the king and his people, and he draws to himself the allegiance of men by as stringent an oath as does the king, thereby making himself the peer of the king and so enfeebling the crown. …’ The third article concluded that\n\nSince the lord king has undertaken to maintain him against all men on every point, entirely without regard to right reason, as behoves the king, he cannot be judged or attainted by an action brought according to law, and therefore, seeing that he is a robber of the people and a traitor to his liege lord and his realm, the people rate him as a man attainted and judged, and pray the king that, since he is bound by his coronation oath to keep the laws that the people shall choose, he will accept and execute the award of his people.126\n\nThe document is highly significant since it provided a legal and constitutional means for the earl of Lincoln and the other earls to attack Gaveston for encroaching on the power of the crown and to oppose Edward II's support of Gaveston, while at the same time upholding their own oaths of allegiance to the crown which they had so recently affirmed at the coronation. The allusion to the coronation oath shows that, whatever Edward may have thought it meant, the fourth clause of the oath was already being invoked by his opponents. The first article of the declaration, concerning ‘homage and the oath of allegiance’, is doubly significant since it was to be used again in 1321 as part of the proceedings against Hugh Despenser the Younger, another favourite of Edward II.127\n\nEdward refused to accept the articles presented by the earl of Lincoln and strongly resisted the attempt to force Gaveston into exile. As suggested in the previous chapter, Edward and Gaveston's withdrawal at Easter 1308 behind the defences of Windsor castle could have been the occasion for the production of a compact of brotherhood between them, as a legal device to protect Gaveston against the expected baronial attempts to oust him. If such an agreement was made in April 1308, Edward's belief that it might provide a shelter against the increasingly determined opposition of the earls was naïve in the extreme. With the significant exception of the earl of Lancaster, whose loyalty was rewarded and, Edward hoped, ensured for the future by his being granted the office of steward of England on 9 May, virtually all the earls, led by Lincoln, were firmly opposed to the king and to Gaveston.128 Edward had also been under intense pressure from Philip IV of France since the time of the coronation over issues concerning Isabella's dower and the Templars.129 The future of Gaveston was now added to these problems. In the spring of 1308 Philip sent Pierre de Courpalay, the abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and three knights to England. According to two anonymous newsletters, written on 12and 14May, they were sent pro statu de Gaveston deteriorando, while Philip also let it be known that unless Edward expelled Piers Gaveston, whom he regarded as his mortal enemy, from the realm of England, he would also treat all Gaveston's supporters as his enemies. It was rumoured that Philip IV and his sister Margaret, the widow of Edward I, had sent £40,000 to the earls of Lincoln and Pembroke to assist them in their proceedings against Gaveston.130 Opposed by nearly all of the leading English magnates, by his father-in-law, stepmother, and also by his wife, Edward II finally gave way on 18 May and agreed that Gaveston should go into perpetual exile on 24 June, and that he should restore the lands of the earldom of Cornwall to the crown.131 Four days earlier, on 14 May, in a clear concession to Philip IV, Edward assigned to Isabella all the revenues and debts accruing from the county of Ponthieu.132 The king wished Gaveston to retain the title of earl, which continued to be used in royal letters of privy seal relating to Gaveston, but was systematically omitted in instruments under the Great Seal, which referred to him simply as Sir Peter de Gaveston, knight. On 19 May the archbishop of Canterbury passed sentence of excommunication on Gaveston should he return. The earls did not however trust Edward II to keep his word and, according to the Lanercost chronicle, gathered an army at Northampton on about 2 June and demanded Gaveston's immediate departure from England.133\n\nThe sentence of exile had not specified where Gaveston should be sent. One of Edward II's possessions in France was the most obvious destination. The county of Ponthieu on the Channel coast of France, where Gaveston had spent his brief exile in 1307, was the nearest, but was ruled out since its revenues had just been granted to Isabella and it was soon full of French and English officials surveying its value.134 An obvious alternative was to establish him somewhere in Edward II's duchy of Aquitaine in south-west France. On 24 May he was granted lands in Aquitaine worth £2,000 sterling, the grant being replaced on 7 June by another of the same value, which included the island of Oléron and the county of Gaure, close to Gabaston in the neighbouring county of Béarn, from which Gaveston took his name. These lands, together with another £2,000 of revenues from lands in England granted to Gaveston at about the same time, would have given him an income equivalent to that of a substantial earldom in England.135 It was presumably intended that he would go to Aquitaine. But the depth of Philip IV's hostility to him might have made any part of France, even a part under English rule, too dangerous a place for him.136 Edward therefore looked farther afield for somewhere where Gaveston might be relatively safe from his domestic and French enemies and where he might play a role of some dignity and importance. On 16 June Edward appointed Gaveston as his lieutenant in Ireland, with wide powers. This was clearly a last-minute appointment since the earl of Ulster, the leading member of the Irish nobility, had been appointed to the same office only the day before. On 25 June 1308 Edward saw Gaveston off to Ireland from Bristol and, for the moment at least, the political crisis in England was over and the threat of civil war removed.137\n\nRECONCILIATION AND REFORM\n\nIn the months that followed Gaveston's departure for Ireland a gradual process of reconciliation between the king and the magnates began. This was greatly aided by Gaveston's absence, and by the wish of many of the earls to restore peace to the kingdom, but was also hindered by a residual distrust of the king's motives. On 21 June Edward II issued a general military summons in which the army was ordered to muster at Carlisle on 22 August for a new campaign in Scotland,138 where during the past twelve months Robert Bruce had been taking English-held castles and defeating and expelling English supporters.139 The campaign, which would have been the first of Edward II's reign, was urgently needed, but its purpose was probably as much to restore Edward's authority over his magnates as to prevent further advances by Robert Bruce. The campaign did not however take place and, while there was no order cancelling it and there is no recorded evidence of any refusal by the magnates to take part in it, the reason may have been that the earls had unfinished business with the king. This may explain the meeting, understandably but incorrectly called a ‘parliament’ by the Annales Paulini, which was held on 4 August at Northampton. There is evidence from the witness lists of royal charters that a number of earls, including Gloucester, Hereford, Richmond, Warwick and the all-important Lincoln, and royalist barons such as Hugh Despenser the Elder, were present. According to the Annales Paulini the king and the earls were reconciled. The king allegedly took an oath that he would remove Hugh Despenser and five others from his council and that he would abide by the decisions of the earls and barons at the next parliament, which was summoned on 16 August to meet on 20 October. This suggests that the earls intended to prepare a programme of reform which they would present to parliament in October.140\n\nEven before the Northampton meeting in August there were signs that the king was trying to reconcile himself with individual earls by the careful application of royal patronage and favour, notably towards his nephew the earl of Gloucester and the earl of Hereford. The earls of Lincoln and Warwick were being courted from August, and the earl of Pembroke, who appears to have been strongly opposed to Gaveston, was receiving royal favours by the autumn of 1308.141 This pattern of reconciliation was however counterbalanced by other developments. When Edward II arranged a tournament at great expense at Kennington in the autumn, the earls apparently shunned it.142 Of much greater importance was the increasing distance between the king and his first cousin, the earl of Lancaster, who had earlier in the reign either been aligned with the king or had at least played a neutral role in the disputes over Gaveston. Lancaster was absent from the meeting at Northampton in August 1308 and disappears altogether from the witness lists to royal charters between early November 1308 and March 1310. The reasons for this estrangement are obscure but its existence seems clear. Whatever the cause, Lancaster was now embarked on the road which led him into open opposition from 1309.143\n\nIn the summer of 1308 Edward II was playing a skilful yet risky game. While he was attempting, with considerable success, to appease the earls, he was actively preparing the ground for the return of Gaveston to England. Whether the earls were aware of what was happening is unknown but they may well have had their suspicions. As early as 16 June, even before Gaveston had left for Ireland, Edward II wrote to Pope Clement V, asking him to lift the archbishop of Canterbury's sentence of excommunication on Gaveston should he return. On the same day Edward wrote to his father-in-law, Philip IV of France.144 Both the pope and the king of France responded by sending envoys to England. Arnaud d'Aux, bishop of Poitiers and a future cardinal, and Gaveston's nephew, Bertrand Caillau, came on behalf of the pope and were in England in time for the Westminster parliament in October. Bishop Guy of Soissons and Louis, count of Évreux, the half-brother of Philip IV and a close personal friend of Edward II, were sent on behalf of France and reached England in mid-September.145\n\nThere is no indication that any of the issues that were raised at the meeting at Northampton on 4 August were pursued further when parliament met in late October. This may indicate that the earls were not ready to present the detailed demands for reform which were to be a major feature of the parliaments of 1309, at Westminster in April and at Stamford in July. With the removal of Gaveston, the atmosphere in October 1308 was also largely free of the tensions which had dogged relations between the king and the magnates earlier in the year and had effectively prevented two successive parliaments from conducting any serious business. Although the leading earls were now reconciled to the crown, it is unlikely that Edward formally raised the question of their approval of Gaveston's return to England in the near future. But this issue was certainly uppermost in Edward's mind and had a bearing on some of the decisions that were taken either during or around the time of the parliament. In order to placate both the pope and Philip IV, he gave formal approval to the suppression of the order of the Knights Templar, which he had been resisting since December 1307.146 He agreed to the release from prison of the former treasurer, Walter Langton, who was duly freed on 9 November.147 Two Scottish bishops, William Lamberton of St Andrews and Robert Wishart of Glasgow, who had been imprisoned in England since 1306, were also released at papal request.148 As well as hoping for future assistance from the pope in obtaining Gaveston's return, Edward was hoping for a grant of taxation by the Church, as eventually happened early in 1309. The consecration at Canterbury on 13 October, in the presence of Edward II, of Edward's old ally and treasurer, Walter Reynolds, as bishop of Worcester,149 was a further sign that relations between the king and the Church were improving. The French envoys, who had arrived in England in September in order to assist in reconciling Edward and his barons, instead arranged a truce between England and Scotland which came into force in November 1308.150 The truce superseded a decision taken by the king's council, and presumably made during the parliament, to send the earls of Gloucester and Hereford with a large force to Scotland.151 This brought welcome relief but French mediation with the Scots was a two-edged sword, since Philip IV could always threaten to renew the former French alliance with the Scots if Edward II did not do what he wanted. It also brought French approval of Gaveston's return from exile no nearer.152\n\nEDWARD AND GAVESTON\n\nEdward continued to pursue his ambition to obtain the recall and reinstatement of Gaveston. Early in January 1309 he called an assembly of bishops and royal administrators, predominantly consisting of earls and barons, to meet at Westminster on 23 February. Altogether nine earls, Gloucester, Lincoln, Lancaster, Surrey, Hereford, Pembroke, Richmond, Warwick and Arundel, and forty-two barons were summoned, a total very similar in number to those called to each of the three parliaments in 1308. These presumably were the men whom Edward II really wished to consult,153 and the king must have used the occasion to discover whether the magnates were now prepared to consider allowing Gaveston to return to England. It is also possible that as a quid pro quo, the king promised or hinted that he would be receptive to any proposals for reform that might be put to him in the future. This would have made it all the more urgent for the earls to formulate a detailed plan of reform, for presentation at the next parliament which was summoned on 4 March to meet at Westminster on 27 April.\n\nAlso on 4 March Edward wrote to the pope and to the cardinals to announce that he was sending an embassy to Avignon, consisting of the earl of Pembroke (now fully reconciled to the king), the ever-loyal earl of Richmond, Edward's close ally Walter Reynolds the bishop of Worcester and royal treasurer, the bishop of Norwich and others.154 The business of the embassy was not specified but its purpose was certainly to obtain an annulment by the pope of the sentence of excommunication to be imposed upon Gaveston. Edward probably hoped he could then present the remainder of the earls and their supporters with a fait accompli. The embassy set out for Avignon in early March,155 visiting Philip IV of France on the way to try to win his approval for the return of Gaveston. The negotiations with France were still incomplete as late as the end of April,156 but the mission to Avignon was more successful and on about 21 May the pope issued a bull annulling the sentence of excommunication.157 The pope stated that he had done so because the archbishop of Canterbury had not followed the proper procedures in canon law before passing sentence, and because the king had assured him that he was now reconciled with the English magnates, who were prepared to accept Gaveston's return. Gaveston had however appealed against the sentence before it came into force, and the pope had yet to give a final ruling on the appeal. This left the possibility that if it failed, Gaveston could still be excommunicated.158\n\nAN AGENDA FOR REFORM\n\nIn the meantime the earls were making extensive preparations of their own for the forthcoming parliament. At some point between 20 March and 7 April a tournament took place at Dunstable, which was attended by the earls of Gloucester, Hereford, Lancaster, Warwick, Surrey and Arundel, together with large retinues. The earl of Lincoln was not present, but there is no evidence that this signified disapproval of the actions of his fellow earls.159 It has been suggested, though it cannot be proved, that the earl of Lancaster was responsible for convening the tournament and that he was therefore beginning to assume leadership of the movement for reform. Whether or not this was the case, it is likely that the occasion was used either to compose or to perfect an existing draft of the articles that were presented at the Westminster parliament on 27 April. There is also evidence that, of those who attended the Dunstable tournament, all six of the earls, at least twenty-five barons, and four or five knights later attended parliament.160\n\nEdward II's request for the return of Gaveston was rejected.161 His other request for a grant of taxation in aid of the war in Scotland was agreed on 27 April by the lay and ecclesiastical magnates and by the knights and burgesses, who granted him a twenty-fifth of the value of moveable goods. The grant was however conditional on the king's acceptance of a document containing eleven articles of reform.162 This document was of the greatest significance, since, as Dr Maddicott has remarked, ‘The eleven articles presented in parliament represent a halfway stage between the Articuli super Cartas of 1300 and the much fuller plan of reform embodied in the Ordinances of 1311.’ The petition began with a complaint that the country was not governed in accordance with Magna Carta. Articles 1 and 7 protested at the abuse of purveyance; articles 4 and 5 at the unjust extension of the jurisdiction of the steward and marshal of the household; and article 8 at the wrongful use of royal protections and writs of privy seal to delay the course of common law. These five articles were very similar to complaints which had been made to Edward I's government in 1300 and had then been answered in the second, third, and sixth clauses of the Articuli super Cartas. Two more of the 1309 articles were derived at one remove from the Articuli. Article 10 in 1309, which protested that constables of royal castles illegally held common pleas before the gates of their castles, stemmed from article 7 in 1300, which ascribed this offence to the constable of Dover castle alone; and article 11 in 1309, which stated that the king's escheators unjustly seized the lands of tenants-in-chief and then refused them the right of appeal to the king's court, may have been based on articles 18 and 19 of 1300, which protested at similar, though not identical, abuses committed by the escheators. Thus five of the 1309 articles were directly based on the Articuli super Cartas of 1300 and another two indirectly. Only the remaining four articles of 1309, which called for the abolition of the new customs of 1303 (article 2); an end to the depreciation of the coinage (article 3); the provision of receivers of petitions in parliament to deal with unheard petitions (article 6), and greater control of the issue of pardons to criminals (article 9), appear to have been substantially new.163\n\nThe enrolment of the articles on the Close Roll states that the document was presented to the king by the community of his realm (par la communalte de son roialme). The term ‘community’ should not however be understood as ‘Commons’ in the sense of the knights and the burgesses. While some of the grievances complained of in the articles were of interest to the knights and burgesses, notably article 6 concerning the hearing of petitions, which states that it came specifically from them, there is no doubt that the articles were substantially the work of the earls and barons, probably with the practical help of legally and administratively experienced advisers who were familiar with such earlier documents as the Articuli super Cartas. To a very large extent the earls and barons still were the ‘community of the realm’, speaking for themselves but also beginning to take into account the interests and grievances of a wider political community.164 The articles of 1309 also bear a close resemblance both in their form and in the kind of grievances expressed to the petitions of the community (la commune) which were received and answered by Edward III in the parliaments of 1327, 1333 and 1334.165 The big difference between 1309 and these later occasions was in the political atmosphere: on the one hand a king who was outwardly willing to consider reforms while in the last resort determined to resist anything which affected the exercise of his prerogative; on the other, a king who was conscious of his need for support, and who was receptive and prepared to accept reforms. According to several of the chroniclers, Edward II did not reject the articles but refused to give an immediate answer.166\n\nGAVESTON'S RETURN AND THE BEGINNING OF REFORM\n\nThe papal bull annulling the archbishop of Canterbury's sentence of excommunication on Piers Gaveston should he return to England did not have any effect on the political situation in England until its arrival in early June.167 On 11 June it was read, on the orders of the king, before the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of London, Winchester and Chichester. Archbishop Winchelsey was unhappy with the bull and sought the written opinions of the bishops of his province, but found little support and was left with no choice but to accept the pope's decree.168 Winchelsey's attempt to retaliate by ordering John Droxford, the keeper of the king's wardrobe, to be at Canterbury for his consecration as bishop of Bath & Wells two weeks after the planned opening of the Stamford parliament, was met with fury by the king. In the event the consecration did not take place because of Droxford's attendance at parliament. Winchelsey himself did not attend, partly because of ill health, but also because he was deeply unhappy about Gaveston's return and did not want to debate the matter in parliament.169 Without even waiting for parliament to meet, Edward II set off from Westminster and met Gaveston at Chester on 27 June, the day of his arrival from Dublin.170\n\nThe king was aware that he would have to pay a political price for Gaveston's return. On 18 June and 14 July he ordered measures to prevent the abuses of purveyance (goods requisitioned by the king), which had been bitterly complained of in the articles presented in the Westminster parliament in April, and to expedite the payment of royal debts.171 On 12 June 1309 the sheriffs of England had been ordered to proclaim the ‘Statute of Prises’, forbidding the taking of undue prises (goods taken by a lord from his dependants) from ecclesiastical and lay persons. Like the Statute of Stamford of the following month, it was in effect a rehearsal and confirmation of legislation belonging to the reign of Edward I, in this case of chapter 1 of the Statute of Westminster I of 1275.172The proclamation on prises was however counterbalanced on 14 June when the earls of Gloucester, Hereford, Lancaster, Surrey, Warwick and Arundel were ordered not to engage in tournaments. Edward II was evidently afraid of the possibility of the earls bringing armed retainers to the coming parliament,173 which had been summoned on 11 June to meet at Stamford on 27 July.174\n\nWhen the parliament assembled, Gaveston's return was already a fait accompli, although his full reinstatement as earl of Cornwall was still to be approved. Edward had the support of at least five of the earls, Pembroke, Richmond, Gloucester, Hereford and Lincoln.175 At least six of the bishops present, Durham, Chichester, London, Worcester, Winchester and Norwich, as well as the bishop-elect of Bath & Wells, were royalist or had royalist sympathies. Since the beginning of the reign Edward had been successful in getting three of his clerks elected to the episcopate, Walter Reynolds to Worcester, Walter Stapeldon to Exeter and, most recently, Droxford to Bath & Wells.176 Edward finally gave his answers to each of the articles which had been presented during the Westminster parliament in April 1309.The Statute of Stamford then gave legislative effect to those answers. Five of the complaints made to the king at Westminster in April were answered by reciting the relevant causes of the Articuli super Cartas. These concerned purveyance: the quantities which purveyors should take, punishment for excessive purveyance and purveyance without warrant, methods of payment, and the production of warrants. The statute then promised to limit the authority of the steward and marshal of the royal household and that no privy seal writ affecting the common law would be issued. Edward also promised to curb the powers of the constables of royal castles and to give up temporarily the new customs of 1303 to see what the effects were. The king instructed the chancellor and other royal officials to observe the remaining two articles in the April petition without reciting them specifically. On 20 August the county sheriffs were ordered to proclaim the statute.177\n\nEdward II had answered the articles of April 1309 at the least possible personal cost by issuing what amounted to a confirmation of the Articuli super Cartas granted by his father in 1300. He also got his wish over Gaveston, who was restored to the title of earl and to the lands of the earldom of Cornwall at Stamford on 5 August. On 26 July and 4 August respectively he had surrendered the lands in England and France which he had been granted by Edward II in compensation for the loss of his earldom at the time of his exile in 1308. The form of Gaveston's tenure was however changed. When he was first created earl of Cornwall in August 1307 he received the earldom in fee simple to himself and his heirs; the re-grant of August 1309 was made in fee-tail to Gaveston and his wife and to the heirs of their bodies. The restoration of the earldom of Cornwall to Gaveston was witnessed by many of the most powerful men in the kingdom: the bishop of Durham, the chancellor the bishop of Chichester, the treasurer the bishop of Worcester, and the bishop of London; by the earls of Gloucester, Lincoln, Surrey, Pembroke, Hereford and Warwick; Hugh Despenser the Elder, Henry de Percy and Robert Fitz Payn, the steward of the king's household.178\n\nOn 30 July Edward II turned to Scotland, the business for which the parliament had ostensibly been called, and issued a summons for the army to meet at Newcastle upon Tyne on 29 September 1309.179 On the same day he wrote to Philip IV of France politely turning down the latter's request, recently brought by a French envoy, Mathew de Varennes, for a meeting with Edward, on the grounds that he would shortly be going to Scotland. On 3 August he wrote more firmly to Philip objecting to one of the letters carried by Varennes in which Robert Bruce of Scotland had been given the title of king.180\n\nThe new-found harmony between the king and the earls and barons was marked by the decision taken during the Stamford parliament to send a letter from the barons to the pope protesting against the practice of papal provisions to benefices and other alleged abuses of papal authority in England. Edward II gave effect to this decision on 6 August when he wrote to the earls and barons asking them to append their seals to the letter when they received it. Twelve earls, Gloucester, Lancaster, Lincoln, Cornwall, Ulster, Surrey, Hereford, Richmond, Pembroke, Warwick, Arundel and Oxford, and thirty-four barons sealed the letter.181\n\nWith the restoration of Gaveston settled and the Statute of Stamford agreed, Edward II finally obtained the grant of taxation which had provisionally been given to him in April, and on 26 August commissions were issued to the assessors and collectors to begin their work.182 But there were still ominous signs. The earls of Lancaster and Arundel, and the archbishop of Canterbury had all been absent from Stamford; and it has been suggested that the partnership of Lancaster and Winchelsey as Ordainers in 1310–11 first came into being at the time of the Stamford Parliament. It had still to be proved whether Edward II was willing or even able to implement the promised controls on purveyance and on royal officials; and there was also the question of how Gaveston would behave in the future.183\n\nPART TWO\n\nCRISIS RENEWED: THE APPOINTMENT OF THE ORDAINERS\n\nWithin months of the settlement which had apparently been achieved at Stamford in July–August 1309 the political situation in England was again deteriorating rapidly. Although Gaveston's influence over the flow of royal patronage was less evident and exercised more circumspectly than it had been before his exile, his influence was nonetheless widely believed to be extensive and was deeply resented.184 The well informed author of the Vita Edwardi Secundi recorded that Gaveston had one of the earl of Lancaster's retainers replaced in office by one of his own.185 This may refer to the dispute over the succession to the lordship of Powys in Wales between Gruffudd de la Pole, who was an important member of Lancaster's retinue, and John Charlton, one of Gaveston's adherents, which began in the summer of 1309 and was to continue far beyond the end of Gaveston's life in 1312.186 His arrogant behaviour towards his fellow earls was also a cause of resentment, especially when he allegedly chose to bestow offensive nicknames upon the earls of Warwick, Gloucester, Lincoln, Lancaster and Pembroke.187 Only the earls of Gloucester, Richmond, Surrey and, initially, Lincoln appear to have remained on good personal terms with him.188 The first overt sign of renewed trouble came on 18 October 1309 when the earls of Lancaster, Lincoln, Warwick, Arundel and Oxford refused to attend a secretum parliamentum at York because Gaveston would be there.189 This meeting was the occasion of Edward II's decision to issue the summons on 26 October for a parliament to meet at York on 8 February.190 On 4 November the king wrote to the earl of Lincoln, alluding to the recent council at York and seeking his advice on the order of business for the coming parliament. The king also made the very significant remark that it would not be convenient for him to attend parliament for more than ten to twelve days at the most. When February came his hopes were to be seriously disappointed.191\n\nApart from the rapidly growing enmity between Gaveston and the other earls, the issue that caused the most serious problems in late 1309 was that of prises and purveyance – the practice by which agents of the king took ‘something for the use of the king by virtue of the royal prerogative’.192 A system which had originally come into being to provide supplies of food for the use of the royal household as it moved around the kingdom was extensively used from the 1290s by both Edward I and Edward II to provide grain and livestock and transport for royal armies and garrisons in Scotland. As well as the inconvenience that this system caused to those affected, payment was often inadequate and frequently long delayed. The burden of war was thus carried by those who were least able to bear it. By the accession of Edward II in 1307 the accumulated unpaid royal debts resulting from prises and the social stress caused by the system were already acute. Prises and purveyance, together with the rapacity of the royal officials who imposed them, had been bitterly complained of during the reign of Edward I and were one of the major issues in the Articuli super Cartas in 1300. Edward II's use of prises and the protests against them both continued. Matters were made even worse when in 1308 and 1309 the king ordered purveyance of supplies on a vast scale for campaigns in Scotland which never took place.193 Even on his own doorstep, his favourite manor of Langley in Hertfordshire, the king and his household were being abused by the local population for their failure to pay their debts.194\n\nThe Statute of Stamford of July 1309 had attempted to address the problem, but with little success. In part this was because prises were a part of the royal prerogative and, unlike taxes on moveables or customs duties, legally did not require the approval of parliament.195 It was therefore in the interests of the king to resist legal control of prises for as long as he could. Without an alternative system of supply, it would be impossible to continue to wage war in Scotland. A modern observer might think that, if the available resources were inadequate, then the war should be brought to an end and the machinery of government and English society in general given a chance to recover. However, although a truce might be agreed from time to time, there was no doubt in the minds of either the king or his magnates that the war should continue. The prestige of the monarchy and national pride demanded that it should. But even if Edward II had been entirely sincere in agreeing to curb prises and assuming that royal officials changed the habits of a lifetime, it was unlikely in practice that much would or could be done. A system which had been in widespread use for so long could not be replaced overnight. Prises were therefore an important part of all the political crises in the early years of the reign of Edward II and they were to be a central issue in the crisis which led to the appointment of the Ordainers in March 1310. The government's acute shortage of ready cash, the result of accumulated debts from the reign of Edward I and the difficulty in obtaining agreement in parliament for taxes on moveables, made prises and purveyance even more essential. Where it was imperative to have ready cash, this was increasingly being obtained through borrowing from the Florentine banking company, the Frescobaldi, who had been dealing with the English crown since the late 1290s. By 1310 Edward II owed them in the region of £22,000.196\n\nAlthough the mustering of the army at Newcastle on 29 September which had been ordered at Stamford on 30 July never took place, Edward II continued to use prises. On 9 November orders were issued for the purveyance of supplies in Ireland and in the counties of Chester and Gloucester, enough for the support of English garrisons but not for a full-scale campaign.197 On 10 December the collection of the twenty-fifth granted at the Stamford Parliament in July was suspended between 29 December and 16 February 1310 because of the failure to enforce the Statute of Stamford. The collectors were nevertheless to proceed with the assessment of the twenty-fifth and to bring any money already received to the exchequer by 29 December. Significantly, the suspension of the tax was made at the request of the earls of Gloucester, Lincoln and Cornwall, in a rare display of political unity.198 In the background there were fears of popular resistance to the burden of prises, even to the extent of a possible peasants' revolt.199 On 12 December, amid these growing signs of political and social unrest, Edward II ordered a change of venue for the forthcoming parliament from York to Westminster.200\n\nThe assembly was originally intended to consider how to deal with the ‘enemy, rebel and traitor’, Robert Bruce, and his breach of the recently made truce, but by the time it was due to begin on 8 February the continued tensions over Gaveston and over prises had produced a serious deterioration in the political situation. Edward II and Gaveston had in the meantime spent a convivial Christmas at Langley, where according to the Vita Edwardi Secundi they ‘fully made up for former absence by their long wished-for sessions of daily and intimate conversation’.201 Just how serious matters had become is shown very clearly in the account in the Vita that the earls came in answer to the king's summons, as they were legally bound to do, but only as far as London, refusing to attend parliament at Westminster while Gaveston, ‘their chief enemy, who had set the kingdom and themselves in an uproar, was skulking in the king's chamber’. They added that, ‘if it was absolutely necessary to present themselves before the king’, they would do so armed, claiming that they were acting for their own safety and not in order to threaten the king.202 Edward's immediate response was to write on 7 February to the earls of Lancaster, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, who were the most hostile to the king and to Gaveston, forbidding them to bring armed retainers to parliament. The earls of Gloucester, Lincoln, Surrey and Richmond, who were more sympathetic to the king, were charged by the king with providing for the safe conduct of those attending parliament, with arresting anyone who broke the king's commands, and with settling any quarrels that might arise during parliament.203 The king eventually sent Gaveston away to a safe place,204 and the parliament finally began on 27 February, after a delay of almost three weeks.205\n\nThe king was at once given a petition in the name of the prelates, earls and barons, which may have been presented by the earl of Lancaster himself. Like the Boulogne agreement of January 1308 and the articles against Gaveston of April 1308 there is no record of the petition in the royal archives. Instead it is known from transcripts in the Annales Londonienses, the muniments of the Guildhall, London, and elsewhere.206 All the issues that had been complained of since Edward II's accession in 1307 were contained in the petition. The king was guided by unsuitable and evil counsellors; he was so impoverished that he could neither defend the realm nor maintain his household except through the extortions of his ministers, who took from both Church and people without paying, in breach of Magna Carta. His father had left him all his lands, in England, Ireland and most of Scotland in peace, but he had lost Scotland and dismembered the possessions of the crown in England and Ireland, without baronial assent. The taxes granted to him by the community of the realm at Northampton in October 1307 in aid of the war and at Stamford in July 1309 in return for the relief of prises and other exactions were still being levied and wasted. But the war had made no progress and the people had not been relieved, and were more heavily burdened than ever. The petition concluded by humbly praying the king that these and other dangers should be redressed by the ordinance of the barons, who were bound by their allegiance to maintain the crown.207\n\nThen, according to the Vita a battle of wills began:\n\nThis at length, I heard, had been asked for by the barons: namely that, as the state of the king and the kingdom had much deteriorated since the death of the elder king Edward of happy memory, and the whole kingdom had been not a little injured by this, they asked that, with the agreement and consent of the lord king and his barons, twelve discreet and powerful men of good reputation should be elected, by whose judgment and decree the situation should be reformed and settled; and if anything should be found a burden on the kingdom, their ordinance should destroy it; and if there was to be provision for any deficiency in the kingdom, the decision should be taken at their complete discretion.208\n\nEdward at first refused to accept their demands, and did not give way until the barons accused him of breaking his coronation oath and threatened him with deposition.209\n\nOn 16 March Edward issued letters patent in which he agreed to the election of Ordainers from among the prelates, earls and barons, and others whom they might decide to summon before them during the period of their authority, which was to last from 29 September 1310 until 29 September 1311. The Ordainers were to have full powers to reform the state both of the kingdom and of the king's household, for the honour of the king and his people, and according to right reason and the king's coronation oath. One weakness in these concessions by the king was that, although he claimed to have acted ‘of his free will’, it was clear to everyone that he had done so only under the most severe duress. Another was the reference to his coronation oath, which raised the possibility that he might repudiate the reforms agreed by the Ordainers if he considered that they were contrary to his oath. These loopholes were to be used with great determination by Edward after the publication of the Ordinances in September 1311.210\n\nOn the day following Edward's concession, 17 March 1310, the prelates, earls and barons replied with letters patent of their own in which they rehearsed the king's consent to the appointment of Ordainers and undertook that this would not be made a precedent for any future action. The document was dated at London, which suggests that they were keeping at arm's length from the parliament at Westminster until everything had been settled to their satisfaction. The letter was issued in the names of the archbishop of Canterbury Robert Winchelsey and of ten bishops, London, Lincoln, Salisbury, Winchester, Norwich, Bath & Wells, Chichester, Worcester, Exeter, and St David's; eight earls, Gloucester, Lancaster, Lincoln, Hereford, Richmond, Pembroke, Warwick and Arundel; and thirteen barons: Henry of Lancaster, Henry de Percy, Hugh de Vere, Robert de Clifford, Robert Fitz Payn, William Marshal, John Lovel, Ralph Fitz William, Payn Tybetot, John Botetourt, Bartholomew de Badlesmere, John de Grey and John Cromwell.211\n\nOn 20 March the twenty-one Ordainers were elected and sworn in: the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops of London, Salisbury, Chichester, Norwich, St David's and Llandaff; the earls of Gloucester, Lancaster, Lincoln, Pembroke, Hereford, Warwick, Richmond and Arundel; and six barons, Hugh de Vere, Hugh de Courtenay, Robert Fitz Roger, John de Grey, William Marshal and William Martin. Within the group of earls there was an even balance between those who were strongly in favour of reform, the earls of Lancaster, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, and those with more royalist inclinations, Gloucester, Lincoln, Richmond and Arundel. Of all the earls, only Oxford and Surrey, and, of course, Piers Gaveston earl of Cornwall took no part in the events of March 1310. Of the bishops elected, the archbishop of Canterbury had long been an opponent of the misuse of royal authority so far as it applied to the Church. Although his name came first on the list of Ordainers, this was probably more a matter of dignity than an indication that he was their real leader. His primary role in 1310 was that of leader of the English Church and guardian of its interests. The bishops elected included only one of the four bishops closely associated with the crown – Chichester, Bath & Wells, Worcester, and Exeter – whose names had appeared in the letters patent of 17 March. The bishop of Chichester was however replaced as chancellor on 11 May by a close ally of the king, Walter Reynolds bishop of Worcester. Of the barons with connections with the king who had participated in composing that letter, Henry de Percy, Robert Fitz Payn (steward of the household), and John Cromwell (constable of the Tower of London), only Henry de Percy was elected as an Ordainer.212 Finally, on 1 April, after all the upheavals of the past weeks, Edward II obtained some additional revenue when orders were issued to the assessors and collectors to finish the assessment of the twenty-fifth conditionally granted in the parliament of April 1309 and to proceed with its collection.213\n\nEDWARD AND GAVESTON IN THE NORTH\n\nThe situation in Scotland had changed significantly since the accession of Edward II in 1307. By the end of 1309 Robert Bruce had greatly strengthened his position compared with two years earlier. He had now won control over Buchan, Ross and Argyll, and would soon add Galloway; he had resumed contact with France, raising the possibility of an active alliance; he had won over many prominent nobles; and he had held a parliament at St Andrews at which his authority as king of Scots had been more widely accepted than ever before. ‘If Scotsmen still wanted to fight against Bruce, they must now do so as individual members of the English forces.’214 Nonetheless there was a considerable English presence in Scotland. A few Scottish earls, Angus, Atholl, Dunbar and Strathearn, and other nobles, such as Alexander Abernethy and John Mowbray, were still loyal to the English crown, while there were English garrisons as far north as Perth, Dundee and Banff; at Edinburgh and Stirling in the Lowlands; in the south-west at Dumfries and Caerlaverock; and in the south-east at Jedburgh, Roxburgh and Berwick. Many of these were powerful fortresses whose garrisons could easily be supplied by sea.215\n\nIf Edward had been able to mount a concerted campaign in Scotland, he should have maintained or even improved this position. But this was the problem. Ever since his accession Edward had been preoccupied with domestic issues, complicated by the difficulties in his relations with France. The material and financial resources were not available for warfare in Scotland on the scale of the campaigns mounted by his father, and, as events would show, there was the question of whether the English magnates would be willing to fight in Scotland. Edward had already planned a Scottish campaign in both 1308 and 1309, but without success. Now, in 1310, a new campaign was more than ever necessary. Matters came to a head on or just before 16 June when Edward was told at a council meeting by Alexander Abernethy, Alexander of Argyll and other loyal Scottish magnates that unless he went north in person and quickly, ‘we should lose both the land and those who still remain faithful to us by reason of our default and our laxity’.216 A decision was therefore taken to summon the army to Berwick for 8 September.217 The proposed campaign also suited Edward personally, since it was a convenient way of putting a distance between himself and the activities of the Ordainers in London while at the same time ensuring the continued safety of Gaveston.218\n\nEdward had left Westminster for Scotland by the end of July, but he was joined on campaign only by the earls of Gloucester, Richmond, Surrey, and of course Cornwall. The earl of Lincoln was to be detained at Westminster by his duties as custos regni,219 but four others, Lancaster, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, refused to join the campaign in person.220 They did however send the minimum service they were legally obliged to provide, representing eight knights' fees in the case of Lancaster and five knight's fees for each of the other three earls.221 Their refusal was justified on the pretext that they were too busy in their work as Ordainers, but the unspoken truth was that they knew that Gaveston would also be in the king's company.\n\nOf the campaign itself the author of the Vita Edwardi Secundi remarked that ‘the king entered Scotland with his army, but not a rebel was found to lay a hand upon him or to ambush his men, except that a few from the army, out foraging or on a plundering raid, were cut off’.222 Although it was not a major campaign in terms of the size of the royal army and its objectives, it was not a negligible undertaking and showed some foresight and planning. With greater resources and a certain amount of luck much more might have been achieved.223 The army consisted of about 3,000 infantry, most of them Welsh; 100 crossbowmen paid by the City of London for the defence of Berwick; the retinues of the three English earls and those of other magnates such as the Scottish earls of Angus and Strathearn, John de Segrave, John de St John, Henry de Percy, Roger Mortimer, John Cromwell, Henry de Beaumont, Hugh Audley and Bartholomew de Badlesmere; and the men of the royal household, about 50 knights and bannerets, and 200 men-at-arms. Altogether the mounted force totalled about 1,700. There were also large contingents in the garrisons of Berwick and Roxburgh.224\n\nIn October 1309 a plan had been devised to land a force of nearly 3,000 men from Ireland, led by the earl of Ulster, to help English allies in Argyll on the west coast of Scotland. Transported in Irish ships, supplemented by forty-five vessels from ports in the west of England, this army was intended to arrive in late June 1310, but was delayed and finally cancelled because of bad weather. Instead the earl of Ulster's men were diverted to the defence of the Isle of Man.225 Despite this serious setback, which undermined the strategy of the campaign, Edward entered Scotland in mid-September, reached Roxburgh on about 16 September, Selkirk on about the 23rd, and Biggar on about the 26th. He was at Renfrew and Glasgow in mid-October, then Linlithgow, and briefly at Edinburgh at the end of the month. Having ensured, so far as he could, the security of the English-held castles south of the Forth, he returned to Berwick-upon-Tweed on about 11 November.226 Apart from a brief foray with a small force when Bruce made a raid into Lothian,227Edward was to remain at Berwick until the end of July 1311.\n\nWith the exception of the attack on an English foraging expedition, which is described by the Vita, little offensive action was carried out by either side. Bruce gave no opportunity for the English to bring him to battle.228 The nearest Edward II and his army came to Bruce was in October when spies informed Edward that Bruce's army was on a moor near Stirling, but nothing came of this.229 Ironically, when Edward did eventually make contact with Bruce and his army at Bannockburn in June 1314, it was in this very same area. During the winter of 1310–11, the English earls followed the king's example by retiring to bases just inside Scotland or near the English border, the earl of Gloucester at Norham, the earl of Surrey at Wark, and the earl of Cornwall at Roxburgh.230 But it was also during this period that some contacts were made between Edward II and Robert Bruce. According to a letter written in February 1311, Robert de Clifford and Robert Fitz Payn had met Bruce with Edward II's approval at Selkirk on 17 December 1310. A second meeting between Bruce and the earls of Gloucester and Cornwall near Melrose did not however occur because Bruce was warned of possible treachery.231 It was also reported in February, in a letter to the earl of Richmond, that Master John Walwayn, a royal clerk, had been arrested and was imprisoned in Berwick ‘because he suddenly went towards those parts [the vicinity of Perth] to speak with Robert Bruce’.232 The purpose of the contacts is unclear, but it is possible, as was to be alleged in 1311–12, that Edward was hoping that Robert Bruce would be prepared to offer Gaveston a place of refuge from his enemies in England in return for a truce or even peace.233\n\nWith the failure of negotiations with Bruce – if that is really what they were – English campaigning resumed in early 1311. In January Gaveston left Roxburgh for Perth, via Dundee, in order to defend the area from Bruce and to prevent him from using it as a recruiting ground. In February the earls of Gloucester and Surrey passed through the forest of Selkirk to receive any of its inhabitants who were prepared to make peace with the king.234 Gaveston remained at Perth until late March when he returned briefly to Berwick for a meeting with the king, apparently concerning the work of the Ordainers, after which he went back to Perth. Gaveston gave up command at Perth to Henry de Percy and the earl of Angus in early May and moved to Dundee.235 According to the chronicle of Walter of Guisborough, the king had sent Gaveston against the Scots with a strong army so that he might make a name for himself and win praise. If so, he was to be disappointed, since the Scots kept their distance.236\n\nThis was effectively the end of Edward II's campaigning in the north. Money and supplies were running short;237 Edward's attempt in May to obtain a grant of one foot soldier from every vill in England for a period of seven weeks at their own expense and without the approval of a parliament met with resistance and was soon abandoned, while his attempt to raise a force of nearly 4,000 men in Ireland and have them shipped to Ayr in Scotland in June 1311 in sixty-two English and Irish vessels was also a failure.238Edward had stayed in the north in order to fight the Scots, but also in order to evade the Ordainers and their "
