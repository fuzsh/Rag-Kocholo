In the following pages I have endeavoured to paint the picture of by-gone Kent with a larger and a fuller brush, and I have carefully avoided all details which, however valuable per se, and however interesting to a few\n\nVI\n\nreaders, do not appeal very strongly to the lover of Kent who is desirous of getting some idea of Kent's place in our national history—perhaps a more distinguished place than is occupied by any other county.\n\nTo many sins of omission I may, therefore, in the eyes of some people have to plead guilty. Such sins of commission as may be exposed will not at any rate have been caused by any want of thoroughness in my attempts to get at the truth, for I have personally visited almost every place in the county in the smallest degree associated with its history.\n\nThe illustrations are from my own sketches made upon the spots represented, with four exceptions—the views of Cobham Hall and of the roof of Eltham Palace, which are copied from engravings, and the portraits of Alfred Mynn and Fuller Pilch, which are copied from lithographs at the Gate Inn, Leeds Castle.\n\nThe Map of Kent is the result of a careful examination of the opinions of acknowledged authorities on the subject, and of a personal investigation of the countiy. The Map of the Armada Beacons is copied, with a few alterations, from a Map in the British Museum, re-produced for the information of the AVar Office at the time of the Invasion scares at the beginning of the present century.\n\nVII\n\nMy best thanks are due to Mr. Payne, Honorary Secretary of our Archæological Society, for help in the Chapter on Roman Kent; to Mr. Knocker of Dover, Mr. Hughes of Sandwich, Mr. Bagshawe of Hastings, Messrs. Stringer and Stokes of Romney, for assistance in the Cinque Ports Appendix; to Mr. Philip Martin for permission to make extracts from his book on the AVest Kent Cricket Club; and to various anonymous helpers in other matters.\n\nHENRY FRANCIS ABELI,\n\nKennington Hall, Ashford,\n\nSeptember, 1S9S.\n\nHISTORY OF KENT.\n\nI.-EARLY KENT.\n\n\\ I /HE first real knowledge we get of our county is & I (s) from the pen of Julius Cæsar. Previous to him it is quite impossible to distinguish myth from\n\nhistory, and we may at once dismiss, as unworthy of serious consideration, the man}7 fables associated with the so-called earliest mentions of Kent. Certain established facts, however, cannot be overlooked— that for several centuries before the Christian era there was a commercial relationship between Britain and the civilized nations of the South, and that for probably a considerable time before Cæsar's invasion in B.C. 55 there had been established a large trade in slaves and grain between Kent and Roman Gaul. That the island of Thanet may be identified with the great tin shipping port of Mictis or Ictis we cannot believe, if only because it prompts the question: AA\"hy should the Phenicians trouble to carry the tin they got in Cornwall along three hundred miles of coast to Thanet because of the short sea passage thence to Gaul when their ships were stout enough to traverse the seas of all the then known world ?\n\nAVithout, therefore, wasting time and space upon conjectures and guesses about matters the real truth of which can never be established, let us at once deal with\n\nB\n\ncertainties, and endeavour to picture the County of Kent as from various incontrovertible evidence it seems to have been presented to the eyes of its first invaders.\n\nThe three chief features of physical change in Kent during the nineteen centuries and a half which have elapsed since Julius Cæsar made his first pi'ospecting expedition are :\n\n1.—In the face of the county generally.\n\n2.—In the configuration of its North East Corner.\n\n3.—In the aspect of its South East Marsh Land.\n\n(I)—The General Aspect of Kent.\n\nThere is abundant evidence to show that Kent at the period of the first Roman expedition was essentially7 a wooded county, broken only by lines of open down such as that which stretches in a semi-circle from Dover to Chartham, by the valleys of the greater livers, and by the tracks of marshland. One third of the county was genuine forest—trackless, uninhabited, dense forest, the haunt of many animals and birds which have long since disappeared from our national fauna. This was a portion of the great Sylva Anderida which extended over and be}rond the neighbouring County of Sussex, and wliich was known as the AVeald. Roughly speaking the Northern Kentish limit of this forest is marked by the line of the South-Eastern Railway from AA'estenhanger to Sevenoaks, although the valley of the Medway cuts deeply tlirough it at one point, whilst on the other hand between Tonbridge and Sevenoaks the forest makes a bold Northerly trend. Place names are a pretty sure guide in our delimitation of the natural AA*ealden boundary, which, we need not remark, is a very different affair from the political or social AA'ealden boundary, and when we get away from the \"hursts\" and \"dens \" and \" charts\" and \"hatches,\" we get away from the AA'eald.\n\nBetween this Northern AA'ealden Boundary—or, for the sake of clearness, let us adopt the artificial line of the South-Eastern Railway, and another artificial line, the\n\nRoman Watling Street, the country consisted almost entirely, as it does to this day, of woodland, sufficiently scattered and thin to allow of the residence of a large population, and of the course of roads and trackways.\n\nNorth of the AAratling Street from where Sandwich now stands as far as AA'oolwich, was marshland, broken AA'est and North of Canterbury by the Forest of the Blean, and all along its western course by innumerable inlets and arms of sea and river.\n\n(II)—The Change in the North East Corner of\n\nKent.\n\nThis is highly interesting, and although to some degree conjecture must enter into a modern consideration of this change, and opinions are necessarily divided as to details, certain main facts seem to have become established.\n\nThanet was an island in the real sense, inasmuch as between it and the mainland stretched mud-flats covered at high tide by water through the midst of which wound the \" river\" AA'antsum. In 597, says Bede, the River AVantsum was about three furlongs wide, so that we may estimate the space between Thanet and the mainland to have been at the widest points about a couple of miles, although between the site of Regulbium and where Brook End marks the end of a deep inlet the distance is nearer four miles.\n\nThis Estuary was a much used line of communication between London and the Channel, and so existed until about the year 14G0, and perhaps from this trade connection with London, the ancient name of Stonar— Lundenwic may be traced.\n\nThe land on which the few houses constituting Stonar stand was in Roman times a narrow spit of beach comingstraight down to opposite Sandwich from Cliffsend on the one side and Ebbsfleet on the other. Beach stones have been found at more than one place along this stretch of land twelve feet below the surface. That the AVantsum river ran. to a considerable depth owing to the\n\ne8\n\ncontributions it received from the \" fleets \" on either side, would seem to be proved by the fact that during its entire length of eight miles there were but two fords, at Sarre and at Sandwich.\n\nAfter the year 1460 the process of obstruction, which had at a much earlier date gained for the river its name (so say some etymologists) became very marked, although fifty years later there were men living who remembered having seen laden barges pass along it, and even in 1590 one John Twine says that there were eight men living who had seen large ships go through. Leland says that in the time of Henry VIII. salt water ran in at the North mouth more than a mile towards Sarre.\n\nStourmouth, now four miles inland, marks where the Great and Little Stour rivers united to flow into the estuary7, the Stour being navigable as far as Fordwich, which was the port of Canterbury, down to the days of Elizabeth, and, as a \" limb \" of Sandwich, enjoyed Cinque Port privileges. Fordwich was until comparatively7 recently7, a corporate town, but when the north mouth of the estuary began to be blocked, and Sandwich Haven became silted up, it lost its importance.\n\nAt Sarre there had been a ford at a very early date, and so late as 1485 it could be used for an hour at very high spring tides.\n\nEbbsfleet was a port in the 12th century, but in Roman times it was probably what its name signifies, a tidal channel. Minster was a busy port in the 13th century, Minster Fleet being its haven. The imposing ruin of Richborough stands upon what was evidently an island, and the fortress commanded the Southern entrance of the AVantsum Estuary, just as Regulbium commanded the Northern. Indeed one may trace to-day almost exactly the dimensions of Richborough island despite the fact that the land stood higher—or rather that the level of the water was very much lower—than the level of the Marsh wliich now represents it.\n\nAVhether Ebbsfleet or Stonar is to be distinguished as\n\nthe landing place of the first Jutes and of Augustine, is still a much disputed point. At any rate Stonar was for centuries an important town and port. That the Romans occupied it is evident from the remains which have been from time to time discovered; possibly it was the second Rutupia, thus accounting for the plural form of the Latin name of Richborough. It was for some time a rival of Sandwich, and until the French burned it in 1385 was a chief port of this part of Kent.\n\nIt has yet to be settled at what exact point the fortress of Richborough was connected with the two roads coming from Canterbury and from Dover which should seemingly unite at Each End, although the latter stops short at AYoodnesborough. This point must have been an important place, and interesting results might reward examination.\n\nTo trace the coast of the mainland at the time of Cæsar's first invasion we may follow this route; from Sandwich by the Polders to Each End, by Brook Street to Cooper Street, thence to the farmhouse which marks where may have been the port of Fleet, then by Goldstone and AA*est Marsh to Lower Stourmouth. Thence to Upper Stourmouth, across the Little Stour to Grove, across the Great Stour at Grove Ferry to Up Street, AA'all End, and by Chislet—the \" beach eyot \" to the site of Regulbium.\n\nIt can hardly be described as an encursion brimming with rollicking excitement, for the Marsh World is very dead, the poor villages contain very few objects of interest, and the scenery is unlovely7. But it gives a far clearer idea of the ancient geographical \" lie\" of the country than any map or descriptive letter press, and the line between upland and marsh is still so clearly defined, that here perhaps more completely than in other places over which waves of change have passed we can fill in the picture of the Past.\n\n(Ill)—The Aspect of the South Eastern Marsh\n\nLand.\n\nThe changes wrought here have a different sort of interest from those just treated of, inasmuch as they have\n\nbeen to a great extent the work of man. AA*hen Cæsar first arrived in Kent the great marshes of Romney, Denge, Guldeford, and Walling formed a tidal morass, a vast mud-flat alternately covered and uncovered as the tide rose and fell, and, probably at no remotely previous period had been a regular bay of the sea.\n\nThe River Limen or Rother, coming from Sussex tlirough Newenden, flowed to Appledore where it ran into an estuary of the sea which followed the base of the cliffs pretty closely along the line of the modern Military Canal, to Lympne where, no doubt, -was a bay of the sea.\n\nIt was perhaps during the Roman occupation that accumulations of shingle at Hythe and Lympne began so much to reduce the volume of tidal water to Appledore, that the idea became feasible of partially shutting it off. AVe say partially, instead of entirely7, because it is evident that unless the operation was carried out at a very much later date than is generally supposed, there was water communication between Lympne and Appledore in the year 893, when the Danes sailed from the former port to burn the latter.\n\nThis was carried into effect by the construction of that great engineering work, the Rhee AA'all. This was a channel of from eighty to a hundred feet in width, with high banks, cut from Appledore to where New Romney now is, into which the waters of the Rother were turned at Appledore, and forming at Romney a safe and capacious harbour.\n\nBy the making of this Rhee AA'all, along the course of which the present high road from Appledore to Romney runs almost exactly, the whole of what we call Romney Marsh proper became capable of reclamation and cultivation, as with the Rhee Wall on the South AA*est and the encroaching shingle bank on the South East it was protected from the sea. It is probably just to credit the Romans witli this fine work by which 24,000 acres of land were made available for human use, as the whole area of Romney7 Marsh proper is scattered with remains of a\n\ncharacter not met with in the other Marshes. At any rate it seems to be established that Romney Marsh was utilised aud inhabited long before the other Marshes were even reclaimed. Not until late in the thirteenth century was AA'alland Marsh reclaimed, and by lhat time Nature had wrought great changes in Romney Marsh.\n\nBetween 1236 and 1287 a series of violent storms swept away the towns of Oswardestone, Dengemarsh, Old AVinchelsea and Broomhill, and Dungeness was formed, Lydd thereby being saved.\n\nThese inundations threatened Appledore, forced the river Rother from its old bed at Appledore, and opened a new course for it which made Rye its outlet, and took the water from the Rhee Wall. In vain the Romney men struggled gallantly against the fate which threatened their town. A new channel was cut, and all through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries cutting, and digging, and devising went on, but Leland, writing in the reign of Henry VIII., can only speak of Romney Haven as something which \" hath been,\" and records that the sea was two miles away.\n\nIt is a question if Old Romney ever had a separate existence, much less an importance of its own at all. At any rate that which we call New Romney was a famous place before the Conquest and so remained for more than two hundred years after. As a distinctive name New Romney is never used in documents before the fifteenth century, Romney alone being spoken of, so that perhaps the view of Mr. Furley, an acknowledged authority on the AVeald and the Marshes, that Old and New Romney merely represent two communities South and North of the Rhee AVall is plausible. Dymchurch Wall as we know it is of comparatively modern origin. It was not until the reign of Henry VIII. that by the rapid accumulation of shingle at Dungeness the safety of the lands lying behind the line of the present wall was threatened, and even down to 1825 the only means of protection was a system of brushwood piles. From that year dates the modern stone wall, and\n\nit is only by the most constant watching and at a heavy expense that even this barrier is kept effective.\n\nIn conclusion of this very interesting portion of our brief survey7 of Old Kent it may be noted that up to the present day the wide region generally known as Romney Marsh has retained a character and even a dialect of its own; and until Lydd became an important military centre, and golf gave a new lease of life to Romney, it remained a terra incognita to the majority even of Kentish people.\n\nThe phrase in old documents \" according to the laws and customs of Romney Marsh \" points to a separate political and judicial existence; as does the record that when in 796 Cenulph King of Mercia invaded Kent, he laid it waste, and cdso the province which is called Merscwari; and Kemble suggests that the Merscware or Marshmen had a kingdom or duchy of their own.\n\nAt any rate, until well within the memory of living men the true Marshman rarely intermarried with or owned any community of interests with folk \" from the shires\" or \"from beyond the hills;\" he was born and married, he lived and died amongst his own; he had his own dialect, his own customs and traditional observances, and neither knew nor cared much about what went on in the world beyond his own limits except so far as it affected the mutton and wool markets.\n\nA few general changes may be noted\n\nThe Channel at the Straits of Dover was probably very much shallower in Cæsar's time than it is now, and the encroachments of thc sea on the North East Coast and at the South AA'est corner of Romney Marsh, at the Isle of Sheppey and along the Ramsgate and Reculver Coast are still going on. Broomhill, which suffered in the great storms of the thirteenth century is said by Harris to have had fifty inns and taverns, and the ruins of its church Mere visible in the middle of the 17th century.\n\nThe River Stour down to the reign of Elizabeth was a navigable river of some size; there was traffic on it as far inland as Chilham, at which there was a \"port\".—whieh\n\nmay mean a market as well as a place of call for vessels, and when Fordwich was the port of Canterbury, the Stour must, of course, have been very much wider and deeper than it is now.\n\nKent is especially7 rich in human remains of the Paleolithic Age; and in specimens of human workmanship, but not of human beings belonging to the Neolithic and the Celtic or Bronze Age.\n\nII.—ROMAN KENT.\n\nIT should be premised that almost all the history of Roman\n\nKent is based upon conjecture—scientific conjecture it\n\nis true; the conjecture of men who have devoted and\n\nare devoting their efforts to the dispersal or brightening of the cloud which hangs over a period separated from that which we are enabled at any rate to get a glimpse of by the light of documentary and monumental evidence, by absolute night; of men who, though following a profession notorious for its proneness to jump at conclusions and to work upon flimsy hypotheses, assert nothing and guess at very little; of men, best fitted in fact by nature and attainments to succeed as far as possible; but still conjecture.\n\nA singular poverty of monumental inscriptions in Kent prevents the would be historian from arriving at such exactitude as marks the conclusions of antiquaries in the world let us say of Hadrian's AA'all. Not a dozen inscribed altars have been discovered in the whole of Kent : in Northumberland and Cumberland hardly a month passes without some such discovery being made, and through the medium of such discoveries antiquaries have been enabled to put piece and piece of evidence together, and to arrive at tolerably exact conclusions of which the result is history. Moreover Kent being the earliest county to be civilised, that is to say washed over and over again by waves of change, being for a long time the most populous part of our island, has naturally7 suffered most from the\n\nnre i\n\nKENT\n\nDURING THE ROMAN OCCUPATION\n\n' OF / HfiM£ 5\n\nobliteration both by destruction and by burial, of such monuments and records as would be of the most value in the compilation of a rational history.\n\nIn short the Kentish antiquary is handicapped to an extent with which his Northern brother is entirely unfamiliar. Hence the uncertainty with which every assertion about the history of Roman Kent must be made. One instance will suffice. There were three Roman towns of importance in Kent—in that small tract of country which Roman Kent comprised—to wit, Noviomagus, Vagniacœ, and Durolevum, the very sites of which are sturdily7 combated problems to this day. Along the entire course of Hadrian's AA'all there is not a mile castle or a supporting camp, much less a fortified town, of which the position is not merely exactly known, but of which some remains cannot be seen.\n\nIn B.C. 55 Julius Cæsar prepared for an expedition of reconnaissance to Britain, a land which promised to be a valuable addition to the Roman Empire, not only for its commerce in metals and grain, but as a recruiting ground for the Roman legions. Of the British tin trade, of course, he had long been aware; his intercourse with Gaulish merchants taught him the magnitude of the British grain trade, and without doubt during his Gaulish campaigns he had discovered the prowess of the stalwart, fearless British warriors.\n\nThe Britons, who had probabl}7 received hints of Cæsar's intended interference from their business friends over the water, and who no doubt had heard of his renown, sent an embassy. This was civilly received and was accompanied home by an officer, Comius, who had instructions to keep his eyes open, and, if possible, to induce the Britons to become allies of his master—a very convenient arrange ment for Cæsar, as he could then pursue the policy of the Jutes of a later age and carry out his scheme of colonisation under the plea of friendship without the worry and expense of fighting.\n\nAt the same time Cæsar had sent Arolusenus to examine the British Coast and report upon the best place for\n\nlanding, for from the Gaulish traders, whom he specially interviewed, he had learned nothing. Comius returned with the report that the Britons, no doubt warned that their fate would be the usual one of tribes who had been induced to \"ally\" with Cæsar,were by no means enthusiastic over the prospect of a Romano-British alliance.\n\nVolusenus returned after five days' absence, but without having been ashore, so that it may be surmised he brought no valuable information.\n\nAt any rate on August 27th Cæsar started from Portus Itius, which may be located at AA'issant, between Calais and Boulogne, or at Boulogne itself according to French archæologists, with two legions, numbering with auxiliaries about 14,000 men, and in nine hours was off the Kentish Coast.\n\nHere he found the cliffs crowded with natives assembled to oppose his landing, and, after calling a council of war, he sailed seven or eight miles to an \" apertum et planum littus.\"\n\nHere comes in the question—and for Kent people it is an intensely interesting question : In wliich direction did he sail these seven or eight miles 1\n\nAccording to modern calculations based upon the hypothesis that the Channel tides have not changed in force and direction since Cæsar's day, the seven or eight miles sail from Folkestone—for Folkestone answers to Cæsar's description of the shore off which he first anchored as well as does Dover—would have brought him opposite almost exactly where now the ruins of Portus Lemannis stretch down the hill side from Lympne church.\n\nBut with a south-westerly wind he might here as reasonably been carried to where Deal Strand now is, in the opposite direction, and, with all deference to the ably argued view which places Cæsar's landing-spot between Bulverhithe and St. Leonards in Sussex, our opinion goes with the concensus, that about Deal is to be located the arrival point of the Roman legions.\n\nAVherever it was, the Britons were ready, and lost no\n\ntime in impeding the process of landing as effectively as possible. Severe fighting ensued which confirmed Cæsar's advices that the Britons were skilful as well as fearless warriors, but the tried discipline and superior armament of the Romans prevailed, and it was only their lack of cavalry which prevented them from utterly routing the Britons.\n\nCæsar formed a camp and awaited a reinforcement of cavalry without which he could not hope to checkmate the guerrilla-like movements of his adversaries. The ships came in sight, but were driven back to Gaul by contrary winds. Nor was this all. It was harvest time, and men of the Seventh Legion were engaged at some distance from the camp in getting in the grain : they fell into an ambuscade, and but for the timely arrival of reinforcements would have been cut to pieces. Again, the Roman ignorance of the great rise and fall of the tides on the British shores led to the insecure mooring of the ships, so that when bad weather came on, the fleet was severely damaged.\n\nThe prevalence of bad weather put an end to active operations for some days, but at length Cæsar saw his opportunity, sallied forth, completely rolled up the Britons, and, being now reinforced by some cavalry, pursued them and returned.\n\nThe Britons now sued for peace, which was granted, and Cæsar, taking hostages with him, made sail for Gaul after a campaign of twenty-five days.\n\nNext year, u.c 54, Cæsar carried out a thoroughly prepared plan of invasion. On July 20th he left Gaul with 600 ships carrying five legions, and 2,000 cavalry, the latter principally Batavians famous at swimming rivers, probably a force of 35,000 men, and landed, it is supposed, at the same spot as before.\n\nHe marched inland at once and at a distance of about twelve miles—\" millia passuum circiter duodecim \"—came in sight of the enemy on the banks of a river. It is impossible to say with any degree of probability what river it was,\n\nFrom as minute a personal examination of the country7 as its difficult character will permit, we are inclined to agree very closely with Mr. Jenkins in the supposition that Chilham was the scene of Cæsar's first battle in his second expedition.\n\nNor are we by any means inclined to sneer as unworthy of acceptation the derivation of the modern name of the ancient barrow on the invaders' side of the river, Julaberry's Grave, from Laberius, the Roman tribune who fell in the battle here. True, his name was Quintus Durus, but there is a good deal in the last three syllables of the popular name which is at any rate suggestive. It does not seem to us at all improbable that, in a sequestered, thinly inhabited country such as this around Chilham was, the name of a famous foeman killed in battle should have been handed down from century to century7 until at this long distance of two thousand years it should still exist in a scarcely altered form.\n\nThe rustic in general, and the Kentish rustic in partieu'ar, has never given play to much fancy in the christening of places, and has been quite content to call anything he knows nothing about in the way of ruin, or cromlech, or mound, or earthwork, after Cæsar or the Devil, both being the same sort of toiler without rhyme or reason in his estimation. AVherever a peculiar name is given to such objects as we have enumerated, the science of historical or antiquarian research is pretty sure to get at some probable fact in support of its etymolog}7, and had we space at our command we could give many instances in support of our statement.\n\nHere we have a name the nearest approach to which may be found in the Julian's Bowers scattered about our country, and which is not to be explained away unquestioned as having anything to do with Selebert or the origin of the name Chilham itself.\n\nAt any rate, Cæsar fought a battle and stormed a stronghold which may have been according to divers opinionists Burg AA*ood by Hurst Green in Sussex, or the oppidum at\n\nKingston, or that on Patrixbourne Hill, or Grove Ferry, or Bursted near Lower Hardres, or Iffin's AA'ood near Canterbury, but which we prefer to think was Chilham.\n\nAA e know, as surely one can know about such antiquities, that Chilham was an important British stronghold; that when Sir Dudley Digges excavated in building his house here in 1610 he found many Roman relics; and, as Mr. Jenkins points out, the polygonal shape of Chilham Keep is distinctly Roman.\n\nCæsar fortified himself in the captured oppidum after he had driven its defenders out. AA'hilst thus engaged the news was brought him that a violent storm had almost completely wrecked the fleet off Deal, so he returned and with characteristic energy at once started the work of refitting.\n\n'o*\n\nThe Britons, hearing of the straits in which was their enemy, assembled under their prince Caswallon, better known as Cassivelaunus. and fortified themselves in the oppidum which we place at Shottenden, but which Mr. Vine considers to have been at Key Coll Hill near Canterbury. Here the Romans did not gain a great victory even if they did not suffer actual repulse, but evidently* they regained their lost laurels, and the Britons retreated.\n\nCæsar's next movements are topographically indistinct. AA'hat we know is that he pursued the retreating Britons, crossed a river, and attacked and took the town of Cassivelaunus. If he proceeded northwards—be it from Chilham or from near Canterbury7, he must have got into Sheppey. If, as we dare to think, he followed the Britons along their trackway, he would have crossed the Thames, and would have come to London, which certainly best answers to the description of the capital of Cassivelaunus to which Cæsar did not even condescend to give a name— protected on the North by a vast forest full of wild beasts, and on the south by marshes.\n\nAVhere he crossed is one of these questions about this period which will always remain unsolved. All we know is that the ford was eighty miles from the sea. If it was\n\nat the Coway Stakes—wliich, by7 the way, are evidently the remains of a bridge—he must either have for strategical or other reasons have gone a great deal out of a direct line, or our notions of the topography of this campaign are entirely at fault.\n\nCassivelaunus finding that his ill-disciplined, ill-armed troops were no match for the Romans at close fighting, had recourse to guerrilla tactics, but finally Cæsar got him at bay, perhaps in the Wimbledon Camp, and the failure of the attack by the four \" Kings \" of Kent on the Coast Camp, coupled with the submission of the Trinobantes to Cæsar, compelled him to surrender.\n\nCæsar gladly came to terms, for domestic sorrow and cares of state were calling him back to Rome, whilst his success in this campaign, which we thoroughly believe was conducted in Kent, was very poorly balanced by the cost, and, after imposing an annual tribute and receiving hostages, he sailed for Gaul. No part of Britain was really conquered. Both Horace and Tibullus speak of the \"unsubdued Britons,\" and- Tacitus remarks that Cæsar merely showed the way to those who came after him.\n\nFor nearly a century the state of affairs in Europe distracted the attention of the Romans from Britain, for the puerilities of Caligula are unworthy of notice. In {empty}a.d. 43 some difficulty about a British fugitive from justice at Rome brought about an expedition under Aulus Plautius.\n\nHe landed, it is thought at Porchester, with 50,000 men, and met with no opposition, either because the Britons were divided amongst themselves, or because the memory of previous contests with the Romans had taught them to avoid fights in the open.\n\nThe history of the campaign is very dim, but it would seem that the Romans pursued the Britons into their woods and marshes, and round by the Cotswolds to a part of the Thames where \" it empties itself into the ocean and becomes an estuary at high water.\" Aulus Plautius is supposed to have crossed into Essex from Kent by the\n\nCauseway at Higham, still existing, and known to be Roman, on the way defeating the two sons of Cunobelin, Caractacus and Togidumnus, and scattering the tribe of Dobuni or Boduni.\n\nThe want of knowledge about this campaign is much to be regretted, for it was evidently, from the extent of new country embraced, a very big affair, and really was the foundation of the Roman Colony of Britain. All we know is that at length the Roman general found himself in an awkward position in a country of forest and marsh, and, in obedience to instructions, after intrenching himself, perhaps in the great oppidum at Holwood, he sent to Claudius for help. Claudius came, took Camalodunum, the modern Colchester or Chesterford, the capital of the late King Cunobelin, and conducted a successful campaign which earned him a triumph.\n\nThe subsequent history of Roman rule in England in no way affects Kent, which seems to have settled down to peaceful, prosperous, industrial life, and to have become a favourite residential district for Roman officials.\n\nAA'e started with the statement that Cæsar's main object in conquering Britain had been to make money out of her.\n\nThe southern part had been long linked to the civilised world by commercial ties. It is believed that many hundred y*ears before Christ the Phenicians carried on a tin trade with her, it is known that the Greeks succeeded them, and that the Romans succeeded the Greeks. The Kentish folk were no barbarians of the kind \"pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw;\" they knew the value of money; Sir John Evans says that they minted in the second century before Christ gold coins modelled on Greek coins of the age of Pythias, and that in 30 B.C. they had gold coins stamped with letters. Besides tin, Britain exported slaves, hunting dogs, lead, coin and skins, and Mr. Boyd Dawkins thinks, possibly worked the iron ore of the Weald. In return they received brass, pottery, glass and ivory. Britain was also a valuable recruiting ground, not merely for the legions, but for the\n\nc\n\namphitheatre, and our forefathers were always remarkable for stature, strength and agility.\n\nCorn growing, pottery making, and possibly iron smelting, were the chief Kentish industries during the Roman period. The North Kentish shore from Faversham to Rochester was under the Roman dominion one vast potter's field, and at the present day the marshes of the Medway below Upchurch and extending from Otterham Creek nearly to Chitney, are full of Roman remains in the shapes of pottery banks, and traces of the life of the workers.\n\nThe peculiar bluish black Upchurch ware, although not so fine in quality nor so elaborately ornamented as that manufactured along the banks of the Nen in Northamptonshire and known as Caister ware, was evidently much esteemed, as specimens of it have been found, not only at some of the remotest stations in Britain, but on the continent. A pottery for ware of a finer kind has been discovered at Dymchurch. The immense quantity of pseudo-Samian ware unearthed in different parts of our island has suggested the existence of manufactories in Britain, but it is now considered to have been made in Gaul. A large amount has been dredged up from time to time at the Pan Sands between Margate and Reculver, a fact which points to the wreck here of a vessel laden with pottery.\n\nThe whole of this country of marshes and creeks, which by the way is believed in Roman times to have been dry7 land protected by embankments, must have been the seat of a very large industrial population, for the demand for pottery was enormous, as is proved by excavations all over the country which show that the Romans employed pots for many uses to which we are unaccustomed, notably in connection with their funeral ceremonies, and as receptacles for money and treasure. Associated with this industrial class was another of proprietors and employers, and the private dwellings of these extended along the banks of the Medway and Darenth, as well as being in the neighbourhoods of the large towns on the line of Watling\n\nStreet. Of the Roman iron industry in Kent there are but few traces, for it never could compare with that in the Sylva Anderida across the Sussex border, but remains of furnaces and ash heaps have been found near Cowden and Frittenden, and there was perhaps a furnace at Lyminge. Chalk was dug at Dartford and Cray ford and exported, and Hasted states that in Zealand have been found altars dedicated to the goddess of the Kentish chalk workers.\n\nSheppey, Thanet, the river valleys, and the cleared uplands, were the Kentish grain districts : Solinus speaks of Thanet as Frumentariis campis felix et yleba uberi* Gibbon writing of the reign of Julian, about a.d. 350, says that six hundred large barks made several voyages to the coast of Britain and returned from thence laden with corn. \"If \" says he, \" we compute the 600 cornships of Julian at only 70 tons each, they were capable of exporting 120,000 quarters of grain.\"\n\nIt is some small consolation for us who grumble at our modern climate, and who sigh for \" good old-fashioned weather,\" to hear that Pythias the Greek merchant from Marseilles, who landed in Britain during the fourth century before Christ, remarked that the British farmers were obliged to thresh their grain under cover because of the uncertainty of the weather.\n\nAA'e may now briefly examine the principal Roman remains in Kent, and for convenience may thus classify them; (1) Fortresses. (2) Earthworks. (3) Roads. (4) Various.\n\n(I)—Fortresses.\n\nThere were three Castra—Rutupice,—Richborough, Regulbium—Reculver, and Portus Lemannis—Lympne.\n\nThere were three walled towns—Dubris, Dover; Durovernum, Canterbury; and Durobrivœ, Rochester.\n\nAbout the sites of three other important stations controversy still rages. These were Vagniacœ, claimed by Maidstone, Southfleet, and with the greatest show of reason, Springhead near Northfleet; Noviomagus—ten\n\nC 2\n\nmiles from London according to the itineraries—claimed by Keston, by Crayford, by AA'oodcote in Surrey, but probably on the Watling Street; and Durolevum, claimed by Syndale, near Faversham, by Lenham and by the neighbourhood of Ospringe.\n\nOf only two of these are remains at all considerable— of Rutupiœ and of Portus Lemannis : of Regulbium only part of the South and East walls remain, whilst the remains of Durovernum and Durobrivœ consist entirely of pavements, foundations and so forth which are unearthed from beneath the streets of the modern cities, and those of Roman Dubris of the work in the Pharos and the church in the Castle. (II)—Earthworks.\n\nWhat we call Roman earthworks are almost in every case Roman adaptations of British oppicla of fortifications. There is probably not in the county a single camp of Roman origin in the sense that the camps North and South of Hadrian's Wall and others are Roman. The best known because best preserved are the camps at Holwood, Oldbury, Shottenden, Ewell, Judds Hill near Eaversham, Fossberry, Lingfield Mark, Castle Hill near Tonbridge, Postling, the Camp Hill behind Folkestone, the works on Barham Downs and on the hills round about; others such as the works in Bigberry and Iffin's Woods near Canterbury, Penny Pot Wood near Chilham, Syndale near Faversham, and Blackheath, were probably merely temporarily occupied by the Romans unless we accept Syndale to be Durolevum. It is by excavation alone that we can arrive at any probable conclusions concerning earthworks. (Ill) Roads.\n\nThere are so many undoubted Roman Roads, or British trackways adapted by the Romans in Kent, that we can only deal with the principal. These were the Watling Street from London to Dover, still with a few deviations the main road of Kent; the Stone Street from\n\nLympne to Canterbury,—a perfectly straight line still except where Monks Horton Park causes a bend; a straight road Northwards from Dover to AVoodnesborough, whence originally it ran to East End, in Roman times on the shore opposite Richborough island; a road from Richborough via Fleet to Canterbury7, and a road from Canterbury to Reculver.\n\nThere was also without doubt a great main road from the Camp in Holwood Park, via Oldbury and Maidstone into the Sylva Anderida, perhaps to Anderida itself; a road from Rochester to Maidstone, and perhaps one from Maidstone to Lympne. Possibly the great main road first mentioned in its length between Holwood and Maidstone acted as a winter relief-road to AVatling Street, as the latter for many miles runs through a country which in those times must have been almost under water during rainy seasons, the line joining AVatling Street by Key Street west of Sittingbourne.\n\nFrom the frequent discovery of Roman remains along the line of what is now known as the Pilgrims' AA'ay to Canterbury from Surrey and South AA'est England, it is conjectured that this too was used by the Romans, but it cannot be classed amongst Roman roads proper. The \"Pilgrims' AA'ay \" was the British Road right through the counts}7. As for the subordinate roads—viœ vicinedes, branch roads; agrariœ, country roads; and device, byroads, their name is legion, and it is a remarkable instance of the tenacious longevity of tradition that to this day many of them are known to the country folk as Roman roads.\n\n(IV)—Various Remains.\n\nNotwithstanding our knowledge that Kent under Roman rule was on the whole the centre of greater wealth and refinement than any other count}7, yve are faced by the fact that the evidences of this are comparatively small. No such luxurious country palaces as the villas at AVoodchester, at Bignor, and at Brading have been unearthed in Kent. AA'e have no wealth of tesselated pavements,\n\nsculpture, architectural decoration, and personal adornment, such as have been disinterred from London and a score of places in the country. Altars and inscribed stones are almost unknown. And yet we must believe that Roman Canterbury and Rochester and Maidstone and Richborough were as much the homes of wealthy, refined and leisured people as were York and Colchester, and L3icester and Silchester, and AVroxeter and Cirencester, and the cities along the AA'all.\n\nA glance through the index of the Roman Collection of the Kent Archæological Society in the Maidstone Museum will reveal the fact that at one place alone, Richborough, have a few pieces of sculpture and architectural ornament been found. Kent, however, abounded with villas. Of those the best known are those at Hartlip, at AVingham, ut and round about Maidstone, at AA'estbere, and last but by no means least, the fine house unearthed at Darenth in 1894 by Mr. Payne.\n\nAt all these villas interesting relics have been found; and, to use Mr. Payne's words, \"all things conducive to comfort, healtli, and enjoyment\" seem to have abounded, but they seem to have been the residences of successful officials and men of business, rather than of virtuosos and gentlemen of leisure. Air. Payne has recorded the sites of 50 villas in his survey, of which only some half-dozen have been touched.\n\nOf temples and religious edifices we can only call to mind the Mithraic temples at Durham, and near Mottenden, and the small fragment at the top of the AVar Bank at Keston, but in Roman funerary remains Kent is rich. Cemeteries line the roads leading from all the sites of Roman towns, are hidden away in what are now woods and coppices, abound in the brick-fields near the Sittingbourne and Faversham marshes, and are sometimes mingled with the Saxon grave-sites.\n\nA'e may presume to account for the comparative meagreness of our Kentish Roman general relics by the fact that the flood of civilisation rolled and settled over Kent at an\n\nearlier period than over other English counties. There are no isolated Roman towns \"in Kent such as Cilurnum and Borcovicus in Northumberland, or Silchester in Hampshire, or AVroxeter in Shropshire, for without doubt Noviomagus, Durolevum and Vagniacœ lie buried beneath modern hives of life, just as Roman Rochester and Canterbury lie beneath modern Rochester and Canterbury, and could we burrow under Rochester and Canterbury as men have burrowed under Torre del Greco and exposed Herculaneum, we cannot doubt but that we should light upon remains as magnificent as have been unearthed anywhere in Britain.\n\nWith permission I may conclude with some remarks by Mr. Payne upon the subject of Roman Kent. He says : \"The archæologists of the present day, who are worthy of the name, do not jump at conclusions, but deal only with facts, such facts being brought before the highest authorities ere they become matters of history.\n\n\"The statements of the older historians, so far as PreNorman remains are concerned, must be respected, but received with caution. They had not the great advantages we have; and they did not see the gigantic importance of excavating to prove or disprove their theories. AA'edothis so far as we can; brickmakers and quarrymen do the rest. Roman Kent can only be written as illustrated by the discoveries already made.\"\n\nNOTE.—THE LANDING PLACE OF CESAR.\n\nThe late Astronomer Royal argued upon scientific grounds for I*eveiisey, twelve miles from which would have brought Cæsar to Robertsbridge on the Rother, if he followed, as he probably would, especially as it was a night march, a native trackway.\n\nIf as Mr. Hussey argues, likewise upon scientific grounds, that Cæsar landed between Bulverhithe and St. Leonards, twelve miles would have taken him near no river at all.\n\nIf as Mr. Lewin argues, he landed at Lympne, a twelve mile march along the trackwaj*, afterwards made into the Roman Stone Stteet, would certainly not, as Mr. Lewin says it would, have brought Cæsar to Wye or anywhere near it.\n\nThe concensus of modern opinion seems to be that Cæsar landed in quite an opposite direction—at or about Deal, and this is based upon the very rational supposition that he might just as well have been carried eight miles by the wind in one direction as by the tide in another.\n\nFrom Deal no satisfactory site for the battle wllich followed can be found wliich corresponds with Cæsar's express statement that it was fought on the banks of a river, if we accept literally the measurement of twelve miles.\n\nTwelve miles due west from Deal would bring us to Barham Downs, and here, at Kingston, the Emperor Napoleon, who is followed by Mr. Vine, places the site of the battle, Cæsar's route having been by the British trackway through Upper Deal, Knowlton, Goodnestone and Adisham, whence he saw the Britons lining the crest of Barham Downs.\n\nBut why are we to conclude that because Cæsar sighted the Britons after a twelve mile inarch, the}* were posted at a spot twelve miles from the sea?\n\nA twelve mile march at night through a difficult and dense country would not have been finished before daylight, and Cæsar might perfectly well in this countiy of hills have first sighted the enemy at five, six or seven miles distance.\n\nAgain, we read that the enemj* retreated as far as the river, which means to a defensive position, and here the Napoleon-Vine theofy falls to pieces.\n\nThere is no evidence that the diminutive stream which runs tlirough Bourne and Charlton Parks was ever bigger than it is now, and even if we grant that it was we must remember that it was midsummer, and that it could not have been of a width and depth to be considered a strategic obstacle.\n\nBut if we assume—and we are all bound to assume in a case like this; even the scientific theorists have to assume that the Channel tides were two thousand years ago exactly the same as they are now—if we assume that the Britons were sighted by Cæsar about twenty miles from the coast, we seem to be able to imagine the campaign which followed with very tolerable reasonableness.\n\nThe river we then get is the Stonr, which we know was many hundred years after Cæsar's day navigable as far as the \" port \" of Chilham; Cæsar's position is on the hills about Penny Pot and Kettle Benden; and the Biitons are under the shadow of the oppidum upon which was to rise Chilham Castle.\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF KENT.\n\nPREFATORY.\n\nIt will be observed that we speak of Hengist and Horsa, of Vortigern, Catigern, Vortimer, and of their contemporaries as historical personages. This we do, not in a settled belief in their existence as makers of history, but for convenience. It is impossible with the scanty materials at hand to ascertain when, in the history of these dim, early days of our country, fiction ends and truth begins. At any rate no more harm is done by assuming for the sake of clearness and convenience that Hengist and his contemporaries were real beings of flesh and blood than there is in firmly believing that Cinderella's slipper was of glass and not of \" vair,\" that King Arthur, and AVhittington, and Robin Hood were real beings and not mere types, and that Wellington really said \" Up Guards and at 'em !\" at Waterloo.\n\nMoreover there is no reason for doubting the existence of these our early conquerors and patriots, other than the absolute lack of reliable records of their times. They were not giants or magicians : they did nothing improbable : their arrival and their subsequent proceedings fit in admirably with what we know must have been their surroundings : above all, tradition, general and local, gives\n\nthem places in history, and tradition, as every historical student, every antiquary, and every archæologist knows, is not merely not to be despised, but is often of great aid.\n\nAt the same time, we repeat, our treatment of Hengist and his contemporaries as historical beings is not to be interpreted as unqualified belief in them as such.\n\nA writer in the Archeeologia in support of a theory that Vortigern and not Hengist was the real subduer of the Britons quotes the Historia Miscella of Paulus Diaconus, the Lombard historian who wrote almost as early as Bede, and attributes the substitution of Hengist for Vortigern to the pride of the Jutes in a later day when they7 had attained position and power, which induced them to glorify one of their own race at the expense of truth.\n\nI have been called to task for speaking of peoples who called themselves English as Anglo-Saxons. Again the plea of convenience must be urged and accepted. If through all the early fightings and operations between the natives and their invaders strict adherence was held to the term \" Britons \" for the one, and \" English \" for the other, in what an irremediable, hopeless muddle the student's mind would be ! Besides, they may have called themselves what they liked, but the fact remains that they came from Saxony and Angle-land, nnd that Anglo-Saxon describes them very sufficiently.\n\nIII.—THE KINGDOM OF KENT.\n\nTN Appendix A will be found sufficient evidence to\n\nsustain the claim of our County above all others, with\n\nthe exception, of course, of London, to be considered\n\nas par excellence the Royal County. This name is now generally given to Berkshire simply because Windsor Castle happens to be in Berkshire, but, apart from the reasons given in the Appendix, Kent was once a Royal County in the truest sense of the phrase inasmuch as it was a Kingdom.\n\nAVith the end of the Roman rule the real history of Kent may7 be said to begin. AA*e are on comparatively firm ground, and can sometimes say with some degree of certainty that such an event happened, and that such a person did this or that thing, whereas, about the Roman period, as we have before remarked, there is a great deal that can only be guessed at, a great deal of which we can only speak as probable, and a great deal more about which we know nothing at all. Not that there would have been much to record in history about a colony under military despotism, but the land of our birth and residence has always a claim upon our affection strong enough to make us curious about the life of those whose home it was, even if they were but slaves.\n\nThe last Roman soldier was withdrawn from Britain about a.d. 413, but for more than a century later Rome regarded Britain as part of her empire, and it was even granted by Belisarius to the Goths as a sop. Practically\n\nthe land was left to itself, and in as helpless and miserable a condition as can be imagined.\n\nIf it be asked what impress did the Mistress of the Ancient AA'orld leave upon her Northernmost Colony, the answer is practically Nothing.\n\nAs Mr. Norman remarks in a paper in our Archæologia, \"It is somewhat remarkable that while Spain and Gaul were thoroughly Romanised, generally adopted the language of their conquerors; were studded with splendid cities, and produced many men distinguished in the career of literature, nothing similar seems to have happened in Britain.\"\n\nIt is impossible to say if any racial traces wrought by the intermarriage of Roman and Briton were observable when Hengist and Horsa landed in Kent, as, after so long an acquaintance as four hundred years, one might expect, although some modern ethnologists have imagined that here and there to this day, notably in one corner of Sussex and in the country about King's Lynn in Norfolk, Roman blood is discernible in the appearance of the inhabitants.\n\nAssuredly however Hengist and Horsa found Kent in a more civilised, if not more prosperous, condition than she was destined to enjoy for many years after. At the same time it appears that this civilisation was very partial. It was confined to the towns and centres where the Roman tongue alone prevailed, and the bulk of the population, although completely under Roman rule, lived their own life, and even enjoyed their own forms of social government. It must be emphasised too that the Roman system of colonisation, wliich was a purely military despotism, had knocked out of the natives all capacity for independent, sturdy action, if not their physical pluck. Britons fought in the Roman legions, but never were permitted to rise from the ranks; and we may be quite sure that there was none of the respect and enthusiasm amongst them for the eagle, which, existing so strongly as they do amongst soldiers of all creeds and colours for the British flag, is so marvellous and striking a testimony in\n\nfavour of our colonial system. So in civil life. British merchants perhaps prospered and made money, but they do not seem ever to have been permitted to share civil dignities with their Roman companions.\n\nIt was this want of cohesion, this division of the abandoned island into two communities so distinct as almost to be regarded as foreigners to each other—the Romanised Britons of the towns, and the native rural population—which laid the land open and defenceless to the Northern invader who had only been kept in check by the Roman arms. Directly the protecting hand was withdrawn the vultures came down on their prey, and the period between the departure of the Romans and the arrival of the Jutes is the darkest in our history because it is absolutely without annals. All we know is that the Picts, who had been kept within bounds by the garrisons of Hadrian's AA'all, just as the Scandinavians had been kept in check by the Count of the Saxon shore, swooped down upon the land and carried fire and sword to its very heart. With these came the Scots from Ireland, and so when Aetius, the Roman Governor of Gaul, found it impossible to answer the pathetic appeal embodied in the \" Groans of the Britons,\" help had to be looked for elsewhere.\n\nThis was in 443, Vortigern being King of Kent. In despair Vortigern turned for help to foemen, promising them lands and pay in return for services rendered, making use of one race of pests to rid himself of others, and in so doing strictly following the Roman custom of employing \"fœderati\"\n\nThree tribes of the Cimbrian people occupied the North AVest Coast of what is now Germany, from the mouths of the Rhine to the Peninsula of Denmark. These were the Jutes, the Saxons, and the Angles, known to the Romans as Saxons, and by themselves called English. The Saxons lived on the narrow neck of the Denmark Peninsula and about the mouth of the Elbe, and with them were the Frisians. Their land is now Schleswig-Holstein. North of the Saxons lived the Angles, and beyond them, in what\n\nis still Jutland, the Jutes. To this last people, no strangers to the land which called to them for aid, Vortigern appealed, and in 445 Hengist aud Horsa landed in \" three long ships\" at Stonar, so say the latest examiners of the question; at Ebbsfleet, so say nine people out of ten who will not easily give up the creed of their fathers, erroneous as it may be.\n\nFrom 445 to 452 Jutes and Britons fought side by side against Picts and Scots and with success. All the time however Hengist was quietly turning Thanet into a Jutish colony and recruiting his forces from the mother country, intimate enough with Vortigern to give him his daughter Rowena as wife, and craftily lulling him into the most unsuspecting security7, until he saw the time ripe for the development of his long-cherished plan.\n\nIn 452 Hengist threw off the mask, and made some trivial dispute about the payment of his ever increasing bands of warriors, an excuse to burst out of Thanet, seize the fortresses at Richborough and Reculver before Vortigern could make any resistance, march on to Canterbury, wllich he burned, and continue towards London.\n\nWhether his further progress was barred by the Roman walls of Rochester, or whether he was tempted aside by the riches of the Medway Valle*, but he suddenly marched southwards, along the line of the hills, past what was probably then the mound covering the stones of Kits Coty House, and so down to the river at Aylesford.\n\nHere in 455 he met the Britons under A'ortigern. A terrible fight ensued—terrible as may7 be imagined between two leaders one of whom was fighting for a kingdom and the other for self-preservation—which ended in the utter rout of the Britons. Horsa and Catigern the son of Vortigern met in single combat, so says tradition in this land full of tradition, much of which may be accepted as history, and both fell. Catigern, it is said, was laid beneath Kits Coty House, whilst the village of Horsted on the road to Chatham is said to mark the\n\nburial place of his rival. Mr. Payne says that a stone structure of the Cromlech type stood here in former times, and that when Fort Horsted was built it was destroyed. This traditionally7 marked Horsa's tomb.\n\nAfter this victory Hengist declaied himself King of Kent, but that his dominion was as easily kept as it was won must not be imagined; his was but the commencement of a subjugation which was to occupy sixty y*ears, and every hour of his reign was employed in attacking and being attacked, in burnings, slayings, and destroyings. In 457 there was another bloody battle, at Crayford, resulting as did Aylesford in the defeat of the Britons.\n\nThrough the cloud which hangs over this miserable period we can only discern that there seems to have been a great revolt of the Britons under Vortimer, son of Vortigern, acting as general under Aurelius Ambrosianus, a Romanised Briton, Count of the Saxon shore, and that after three great battles fought at Derwent in AA'est Kent, at Stonar—the Stone of the Title—and at AA'ippedsfleet, the Jutes were driven into Thanet in 456. The locality of the last battle is by no means certain. Tradition says that it was fought between Hythe and Folkestone, and that the bones now in the crypt of the former church, and those formerly in the latter church are the remains of the Britons and Jutes who fell in the fight. (See Note A at end of Chapter).\n\nUntil 405 we know nothing of what happened, and we may suppose that Hengist and his Jutes remained shut up in Thanet; but in this year Hengist won a great victory over the Britons at AA'ippedsfleet, in which \" twelve AA'elsh aldermen were slain,\" and recaptured Richborough and Reculver. In 473 another victory firmly established him on the Kentish throne with his son Esc as partner.\n\nIt is necessary here for the sake of continuity to follow briefly the history of the Saxons who, hearing of the successful issue of Hengist's enterprise in Kent, thought that a kingdom in Britain might be theirs also. Accordingly, in 477, came Cymen to Selsea Bill in Sussex, and landed\n\nat Cymen's Ora, still perhaps recognisable in the name Keynor, just as Lancing, Cissbury, and perhaps Chiehester reflect the names of his sons AVlencing and Cissa. But the Andredswald—the Black country of Britain, was \"up,\" and its sturdy miners offered such a resistance that it was not until Anderida—known to us as Pevensey, had been after a terrible struggle captured and utterly destroyed that the Saxon conquest could be called complete and not until 495 was the kingdom of the South Saxons established. Between 495 and 508 other bands of Saxons landed, it is supposed at Porchester, and these, who are known as the AA'est Saxons, were constantly engaged for ten years in conflict with the Britons who seemed to have formed an alliance with the Jutes of the Isle of Wight. In 521 the West Saxon kingdom was established under Cerdic and Cynric, and without detailing matters wliich have no immediate, although an important general, relation to the Kingdom of Kent, it maj- be said that the West Saxons pushed their way Westward and Northward until Hampshire and AViltshire were conquered, and with the fall of Calleva, the modern Silchester, the valley of the Thames lay open, the flank of the great AA'ealden forest was, so to speak, turned, and there was nothing between the invaders and London. This was accomplished by 556. Of Kent and its Jutish conquerors we hear nothing until the time of Ethelbert, the great-grandson of Hengist, who ascended the throne in 564, and we may surmise that, protected by the almost impassable character of its natural boundaries, the little kingdom gradually7 recovered from the utter desolation which accompanied the Jutish conquest, that commercial intercourse was resumed with the Continent, and that people slowly began to re-inhabit the Roman towns which had remained deserted, ruined objects of superstitous awe. How absolutely cities like Canterbury and Rochester had been destroyed is evident if we compare plans of those cities as we know them with the plans of them under Roman rule as evinced by the traces of walls and buildings, and note how even the lines\n\nof the Roman streets were obliterated by the time the first bold men forsook the habit of building outside the heaps of Roman ruins and commenced to build over and amongst the ruins themselves. But so slowly did this work of repopulation progress that it was not for another three hundred years that the entire area was covered with buildings.\n\nEthelbert, partly alarmed at the progress of Cynric and his West Saxons towards the Northern boundary of his kingdom, and partly perhaps ambitious to extend his domains, marched to meet them. He found them entrenched on Wimbledon Common, no doubt in the old British oppidum known as Cæsar's Camp, fought them and was most thoroughly thrashed. This was in 568, and the battle of AA'imbledon is notable as being the first fight on English ground between Englishmen.\n\nIn 583 or 584 Ethelbert married Bertha, daughter of Charibert, King of Paris, a Christian, and with her she brought a chaplain, Liudhard, bishop of Senlis, for whose use the ruined church of Saint Martin at Canterbury, which had been, it is now almost universally agreed, a Roman Christian temple, was repaired and set apart.\n\nThis event, the most important in the history of Kent, and one of the most important in the history of England, leads us to consider briefly what Christianity there had been in Britain.\n\nTradition attributes the first introduction of Christianity into England to a King Lucius of Kent, about a.d. 160, but as the very existence of this King Lucius is questioned, until more is discovered it is safe to relegate him to the world of myths along with the traditions about St. Paul, St. Bran the Blessed, father of Caractacus, Joseph of Arimathea at Glastonbury, and so forth. Christian Missionaries from Gaul are however known to have landed in Britain during the Second Century, and to have made some progress amongst the town-dwellers, but very little amongst the rude bulk of rustics.\n\nWe may also believe that when the Roman Christian\n\nD\n\nEmperor Constantine was crowned at York in 309, Christianity became not merely the tolerated but the recognised religion of the land, and it is from now that we may perhaps date the relics bearing Christian inscriptions and monograms which have been unearthed from time to time at widely different parts of the country, such as Dorsetshire, the Thames, Gloucestershire, Northumberland, Silchester, and also the building of or the adaptation of the churches of St. Martin and St. Pancras at Canterbury, and perhaps those at Reculver and at Brixworth in Hampshire. Under DiocletianSt. Alban is said to have been martyred near the town which bears his name, although Diocletian's Governor in Britain was the tolerant Constantius. In 314 three British bishops are said to have been present at the Council of Aries, and Athanasius speaks of three British bishops being present at his trial at the Council of Sardis in 353. AVhen the first invaders landed from the Schleswig shores they found Britain Christian, but between that date and the y7ear of Ethelbert's marriage the religion was utterly swept from the land. Gibbon says : \"After the destruction of the principal churches the bishops, who had declined the crown of martyrdom, retired with the hoh7 relics into AVales and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even the remembrance of Christianity were abolished; and the British clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers.\"\n\nDevon, Cornwall and AVest AA'ales became the refuges of British Christianity, and although the real conversion of Cornwall by missionaries from Ireland only7 dates from the fifth century, the Christian religion has prevailed there for fourteen hundred years uninterruptedly. It was this toleration by7 Ethelbert of Christianity which instigated the great Pope Gregory to send Augustine as a missionary7 to Britain.\n\nIn 597 he landed in Kent, whether at Ebbsfleet, or at Richborough, or at Stonar is immaterial. The King,\n\nS'yiUduSTirv&'j\n\n(^AivTER^sun.r\n\nafter some hesitation, was converted, thousands of his countrymen followed his example and were baptised. (See Note B at end of Chapter). The ancient Roman Christian Church of St. Pancras, \" the idol house where King Ethelbert according to the rites of his tribe was wont to pray, and with his nobles to sacrifice to his demons,\" as the fourteenth century Benedictine Thorn writes, was cleansed and purged and dedicated by Augustine to St. Pancras; and later on the King, with all a proselyte's zeal, gave Augustine a building eastward of the Roman City limits wliich he had used as his own palace, and which was the precursor of the present magnificent Cathedral. This was followed by the building of the Monastery7 of SS. Peter and Paul, designed as a burial place for Kings and Abbots, which gradually became known by the name of its founder, and later on as St. Augustine's Abbey, actually rivalled the Cathedral in magnificence, and of which the Gateway, put to sadly base uses at the beginning of this century, still exists.\n\nThe establishment of Christianity in Kent brought that Kingdom into active intercourse with the Continent, and raised it to an equality with the powers thereof, and, to quote Mr. Green, \" the civilisation, the arts, the letters which had fled before the sword of the English Conqueror, returned with the Christian faith.\"\n\nIn 604 the bishopric of Rochester was established, subordinate to Canterbury it is true, but indicating that even under Ethelbert the division between East and AVest Kent, between the Men of Kent and the Kentishmen, was a real one almost amounting to the division between two separate States (See Note C at end of Chapter); and, moreover, illustrating that so intimate was the connection between Church and State in these early days of our Christianity that the bounds of States came to be defined by the bounds of episcopal dioceses. Hence, the armoured ecclesiastic was now, and continued to be for another seven hundred years, a familiar figure on the battlefield, and the war story of our country, more\n\np3\n\nespecially that of the Northern Counties and the Border, rings with the deeds of clerical strategists and fighters.\n\nIn the meanwhile Ethelbert, quieted down after his reverse at Wimbledon to the development of his own little Kingdom, saw in the disunion and disorganisation of his great rival AA'essex the long looked for opportunity of extending the boundaries of Kent beyond the Andredswald and the Thames. Such success attended his arms that by the year of his conversion, 597, the Kingdom of Kent extended from the Humber in the North, across the Midlands to Sherwood, down to Huntingdon, by the Western Borders of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire to the Thames, thence by the East Border of Surrey and the AVest Border of Sussex to the sea. Ethelbert was lord therefore over the AVest, Middle and South Angles, the East Angles, the East, Middle and South Saxons, and Kent formed one of the three great divisions of the land, the other two being AVessex and Northumbria. The severing of this large domain commenced in East Anglia, Redwald, the titular King, who had married Ethelbert's sister Ricca, had consented to become, or probably7 was commanded to become, a Christian. His people, however, refused to follow his example, and so by way of compromise he placed the altars of Christian worship amongst the idols of popular worship. This sort of half-and-half action of course did not suit Ethelbert; a series of conflicts between over-lord and vassal ensued, which ended in the open revolt of the latter. The flame of disaffection spread with such fierceness and rapidity that by the year 616, when Ethelbert died, all that remained were Essex, Middlesex and Kent itself, and in the same year Sibert, the titular King of the East Saxons, who had married Ethelbert's daughter and become Christian, threw off both authority and religion, and Kent shrunk again to the dimensions she originally possessed. Ethelbert was succeeded by his son Edbald, who at once threw off Christianity, an example which was followed by his people. St. Lawrence, however, re-converted him, and by\n\nway of penance ordered him to re-build Christian churches which had been allowed to fall into ruin, amongst others that within Dover Castle.\n\nIt was probably during this period of repentance that he allowed Ethelburga, daughter of Ethelbert, to marry Edwin, the King of Northumbria. At first he refused, saying that a Christian maiden was not allowed to be given in marriatre to a heathen, lest the faith and sacraments of the Heavenly King should be profaned by commerce with a King who was wholly unacquainted with the worship of the true God. But upon Edwin's promise that she and her attendants should be allowed to practice their religion unmolested, she was sent, and with her went Paulinus, one of the original companions of Augustine, ordained bishop by Archbishop Justus.\n\nThis was in 625. In the following year Edwin allowed his own daughter to be baptised, together with eleven of her household. Thenceforth Paulinus worked incessantly at the conversion of Northumbria, and in 627 King Edwin himself was christened at York, his example being followed by thousands of his people.\n\nThus, as Dean Stanley says, from Canterbury the first Christian City, from Kent the first English Christian Kingdom, has by degrees arisen the whole constitution of Church and State in England which now binds together the whole British Empire.\n\nBut in 633, Penda of Mercia, and Cadwalla of North Wales, both heathens, revolted against Edwin, and defeated and slew him at the battle of Hatfield—either near Doncaster or on the Severn. This ruined Christianity in Northumbria; Paulinus and Ethelburga fled back to Kent. Here, says the Comte de Montalembert, \" She obtained from her brother the gift of an ancient Roman villa situated between Canterbury and the sea, on the side which looks towards France (at Lyniinge). There she founded a monastery, herself took the veil * * * * The ancient church of her monastery still exists where is shown the site of the tomb of her who passed here the last\n\nfourteen years of her life, and who as the daughter of the founder of Canterbury, and widow of the founder of York, constitutes the first link between the two great homes of Catholic life among the Anglo-Saxons.\" AVe may supplement Dean Stanley's remarks with an extract from the little book edited by Canon Mason for the occasion of the thirteenth centenary of the landing of St. Augustine.\n\n\"The history of the Church of England begins with Augustine and centres round his See of Canterbury. Probably much more was effected by the Church of Canterbury during the first seventy years than is evident upon the face of the records. Its influence must have been felt even where its claims were not recognised. People passed through Canterbury on their way to and from the Continent. Princes of other English Kingdoms, like Redwald, visited the Kentish Court, and carried away with them more or less of its Christianity As Ethelburga had taken Christianity into the heathen realm of Northumbria, so her daughter Eanfled took the Kentish form of it back to Northumbria when she went to be married to Aidan's disciple Oswy, attended by her Kentish presbyter Romanus. ***** Christians from Kent kept coming into the North, and Christians from the North went to learn in those schools of Canterbury which were the model schools of England.\"'\n\nThe history of Britain from this time for more than a century is made up of a series of supremacies during which hitherto independent Kingdoms were swallowed up in the dominion of a supreme power. Kent was, on the whole, less affected by these convulsions than any other part of England, but this immunity, it must be admitted, was owing far more to her inaccessible position behind forests and marshes than to the greatness of her Princes or the martial prowess of her sons.\n\nFor instance, when in 625 Edwin of Northumbria united the whole of England under his sway, Kent alone remained independent, but there was a marriage tie between the Royal houses of Kent and Northumbria which may\n\naccount for this. Again, there were the supremacies of Oswald of Northumbria, of Penda of Mercia, and of Oswin of Bernicia (the East of North Britain from the Tyne to the Firth of Forth), and during these Governments Kent seems to have been alternately in a state of independence and submission, but generally retaining her own sovereigns.\n\nThus in 688 Cadwalla of AVessex, ambitious of spreading his dominion along the entire Southern Coast, attacked Kent, but was repulsed, whilst his successor Ine in 694 overran Kent, and thus extended the AVest Saxon supremacy from Dorsetshire to Essex, including London.\n\nIt was just at this time of turmoil, in 690, that Archbishop Theodore, who in 669 had come from Rome to organise the Northumbrian, AVessex and Mercian bishoprics—the first Archbishop, says Bede, whom the whole church consented to obey—founded the famous school at Canterbury for the teaching of religion, classics, sciences and arts, whence radiated the first written English literature, and of which Aldhelm was the most distinguished alumnus.\n\nTo follow the fortunes of the Kingdom of Kent in detail during the last century of its existence would be a monotonous and profitless task.\n\nShuttlecock-wise it seems to have been tossed from AVessex to Mercia, and from Mercia back to AVessex; we hear of a fierce three years revolt of the Kent men against Offa which in 775 ended in their defeat at the battle of Otford; of another revolt in 823 which proved the end of things, for Egbert of AVessex and his son Ethelwulf finally put an end to the Kingdom of Kent by the dethronement of its King Baldred, after an existence of three hundred and sixty-eight years.\n\nSo now the three peoples which through all these long years had been flying at each others' throats—the Jutes, the Angles, and the Saxons, became, when Egbert conquered Northumberland, one nation, for, although Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia continued to elect their own rulers, all paid tribute to Egbert and acknowledged his supremacy.\n\nThe last years of Egbert's reign were marked by the appearance in Kent of a fiercer foe than had yet come from over the seas. The so-called Danes, really Scandinavians from Norway and Sweden, first landed in Sheppey and committed terrible depredations in 832.\n\nIn 837 Egbert died, and Kent with the other South {empty}.Saxon counties came under the rule of Athelstan, his son, who fought the Danes at Sandwich in 851, but without success, as they burned Canterbury and London, and wintered in Thanet—an ominous proceeding which seemed to indicate an intended residence in England.\n\nIn 854 Canterbury was again burned, and the story of invasion and slaughter continues without a break until in the j7ear 871 when Alfred, grandson of Athelstan, ascended the throne of all England, which—an important saving clause—was not subject to the Danes. He at once set himself to his life's task of combating the Danes, who were certainly masters of East Anglia, and almost as certainly had firm footings in the South and AVest, and it is pleasing to be able to record with tolerable certainty the fact that in Kent some of the deeds which have established him as one of the historic darlings of the English people were performed.\n\nIn 885 the Danes besieged Rochester, which is believed to have been relieved by7 Alfred.\n\nIn 893 the Danish chieftain Hasting sailed from Boulogne with 250 ships, came to the mouth of the Limen at New Romney, sailed up to Appledore by the Rhee AA'all (see Note D at end of Chapter), burned it, and carried fire and sword through all the country round as far as Great Chart. At the same time another fleet had landed an army at Milton near Sittingbourne, and the two held our hapless county entirely at their mere}7.\n\nAt a battle in 903 near Bury St. Edmunds between Edward the Elder, Alfred's son, and a son of Alfred's elder brother Ethelbert, Ethelward by name, who had made an alliance with the Danes, a critical moment arose in the fortunes of the King when a retreat was ordered.\n\nAll obayed but the Kent men. These stood their ground, and as both Ethelward and the Danish King were slain we may suppose that victory rested with our county men.\n\nFrom now until the end of the century the story of Kent is the same sad relation of a harried, ravaged county. Sandwich \" Omnium Anglorum portuuiu famosissimus,\" was the usual landing place; East and AVest Kent suffered alike, and opposite policies such as that which ordained the wholesale massacre of the Danes on St. Brice's Day 1002, and that of buying off the foemen, resulted in the same way—the vengeance or the faithlessness of the pirates, and the gradual extension of the Danish rule throughout England.\n\nIn 1011 Canterbury stoutly7 held out against the foe, but treachery was at work within. Elfmer, Abbot of St. Augustine's, admitted the besiegers, the cathedral and a great part of the city were burned, and the Archbishop, afterwards canonised as St. Alphege, murdered at a brutal feast held within the precincts of the royal palace, or, as other accounts have it, dragged on board the Danish ships, kept in captivity for seven months, and murdered at Greenwich.\n\nThe end was not far off. The terror of the Danish name was such that a single Danish warrior sufficed to put to flight half-a-dozen Saxons; Sweyn, King of Denmark landed, Ethelred the Unready, with his family fled to Normandy, and England passed under the Danish dominion. This was in 1013.\n\nSweyn, however, died soon after his accession to the sovereignty of England; the Danes in England appointed Canute his son to be his successor, but the Saxon AA'itan resolved to recall Ethelred from Normandy.\n\nIn 1015 Canute endeavoured to land at Sandwich, but appears to have been driven off, and took his fleet westward. Ethelred also came over from Normandy, but desertion and dissension raged amongst those to whom he looked most for support, and he died in 1016.\n\nEdmund Ironside, Ethelred's eldest son, was the\n\nsuecessor chosen by the bulk of the people, but the nobles and the clergy were in favour of Canute. Each was crowned king—Canute at Southampton, Edmund in London, and the civil strife broke out anew.\n\nCanute besieged London but was forced to withdraw; at Otford in 1016 Edmund defeated the Danes. (See Note E at end of Chapter,) but treachery withheld from him a chance of sweeping Canute and his army out of existence, and a defeat near Saffron Walden in Essex at what is variously called Assandun, Ashlingdon, and Assingdon, proved fatal to his cause, and shortly afterwards he was assassinated, and Canute became King of England. Under Canute there was a lull in the wearisome work of war and pillage, but in Kent a figure was rising who was destined to leave a deep mark on the county history. This was Godwin Earl of Kent and Sussex. It was he who assisted Edward the Confessor to the crown of England in 1042, probably having had a hand in clearing the other Atheling Alfred out of the way, and three years later married his daughter to the King.\n\nIn 1048 a fleet of Norwegian pirates appeared off Sandwich, and the town was plundered and burned, but they were repulsed in an attack on Thanet chiefly by the ecclesiastics of Minster Abbey7.\n\nIn 1051 an incident occurred at Dover wliich, although unimportant in itself, was fraught with serious consequences, and moreover exemplified the deep hatred of foreigners which had been burnt and hacked into the bosoms of the men of Kent. Eustace Count of Boulogne, who had married the sister of Edward the Confessor, the Countess Godgifa, had been paying a visit at the English court, accompanied by a large armed retinue. That his visit had been purely one of international courtesy may be very much questioned when we see how AVilliam of Normandy7 was at this time strengthening himself at home, when we note how Norman influence was slowly but surely asserting itself in England, how the three chief bishoprics and many minor posts were held by Normans,\n\nand how in particular the Archbishop of Canterbury had selected Earl Godwin, the recognised representative of at any rate the national feeling of South England, as an object of hatred.\n\nAt any rate the men of Dover, who shared with their fellows of the other Kent Ports the distinction of being able to value any foreigner at his real worth, resented practically the overbearing behaviour of Eustace's Normans with the result that the Normans were chased out of the town with the loss of many men. Eustace complained to the King; the King instructed Earl Godwin to punish the town; the Earl refused to obey, and in lieu presented a list of grievances borne by his countrymen at the hands of the insolent foreigners who were beginning to monopolise the chief offices of Church and State.\n\nThe King would pay no attention to the complaints, and at the instigation of the Archbishop of Canterbury the charge of having murdered Alfred Atheling was again brought up against Godwin, and his offer to clear himself on oath was refused. At the General National Assembly held at Gloucester Godwin appeared with his sons and men all armed, and demanded that Eustace and his men should be surrendered to him. The request was of course refused, and Godwin was ordered to quit the kingdom within five days, whilst, to accentuate his wrath, the King actually sent away his own wife, Godwin's daughter. This was in 1052. In 1053 Godwin returned from banishment with his sons, was enthusiatically received by the men of Kent and Sussex, secured the fleet of what were afterwards known as the Cinque Ports, went to London and simply terrified the poor weak King into receiving him actually with distinction, upon which his chief Norman enemies made off as best they could He was restored to his honours and possessions, his daughter the Queen, was recalled from the nunnery of AVherwell, the Archbishop of Canterbury was outlawed, and Frenchmen in high positions made room for Englishmen.\n\nIt was during Earl Godwin's banishment that AVilliam,\n\nDuke of Normandy, made his first visit to England and possibly it was whilst on this visit that he won from Edward that strange promise that he should succeed to the English throne, which he extorted from him, or cajoled out of Harold at a later date. Godwin died soon after his restoration to honour, and his son Harold succeeded to the Earldom, whilst another son Tostig became Earl of Northumberland by the death of the Siward who had fought with the Macbeth ofShakespeare.\n\nIt was probably in 1064 that Harold was the hero of that mysterious incident of the oath taken to William of Normandy, which was to mark the future course of our national history. AA'hat the oath was, and under what circumstances it was taken, authorities are not agreed, but that Harold did place himself under some tremendous obligation to AA'illiam, the non-fulfilment of which led to the Norman Conquest of England, is very certain. Edward the Confessor died in 1066, and on the next day Harold, son of Godwin, was crowned King of England, not, be it noted, by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nREAIARKS ON SAXON KENT.\n\nBefore we survey the relics of the Saxon dominion in Kent which have come down to us, we will concisely examine the form of Government.\n\nThe office of King was partly hereditary and partly elective :—Hereditary7 so far as there was always a Royal Family—a family from which the sovereigns were chosen; elective in that the AVitenagemot selected the individual.\n\nNext in rank came the Ealdormen, probably appointed by the King. AA'hen the Kingdom of Kent as an independency came to an end its sovereigns retained their positions as viceroys under the conquering monarch under the name of Ealdormen or Earls. In the\n\nindependent Kingdom of Kent the Ealdorman was merely a dignity. There were three—East Kent, AVest Kent and Romney Marsh.\n\nBelow the Ealdormen came the Geres as who may be described as the fiscal and administrative officers of the Crown. These were :—\n\n1.—The High Reeve: An official who went from place\n\nto place on special duties.\n\n2.—The Shire Reeve : Head of the Shire; formerly\n\nhead of the County Court, but as the King\n\ngained power his was diminished, and he became\n\nthe principal political officer, chief of the free men, had charge of the county defences, held\n\nthe folk-mote, and controlled the mints.\n\n3.—The King's Reeve : Who attended to the King's\n\npersonal affairs.\n\n4.—The Burgh Reeve: A royal officer in charge of\n\nthe burghs.\n\n5.—The Port Reeve: Controller of commercial affairs.\n\n\"Port\" formerly meant much the same as\n\nmarket.\n\n6.—The Wie Reeve: The village officer.\n\n7.—The Tung Reeve : An estate officer, a steward\n\n8.—The Swan Reeve : Controlled herdsmen, foresters\n\nand pastures.\n\nAfter the Reeves ranked the Thanes, of whom there were two, or perhaps three, classes; tenants in Francalmoigne, who held lands bestowed on people devoted to religious service; soldiers; soc men, described by Morgan as \"commended men of great lords,\" chiefly in Romney Marsh and the AVeald border; labourers and villeins who were personally free men, but unable to alienate lands without their lords' permission, and paying rent by services as well as in money; and, lastly, the Bordarii, free men, but poorer than villeins.\n\nThese comprised the freemen of the county.\n\nSlavery in Kent existed as generally and as strongly as in any other county7, but the lot of the slave in Kent\n\nwas probably better than elsewhere on account of the free character of Kentish tenures. Slaves were of various kinds—by conquest, by marriage, as in the case of a free man marrying a slave-born woman he descended to her estate, by parental decision, and by birth,\n\nThere was a large slave trade in Saxon England of which London was the principal mart. Under Alfred the condition of the slave was much ameliorated, one of his laws being that a Christian could only be sold for six years, after which time he or she was free.\n\nThe proportion of slaves in Kent has been calculated at about one-tenth of the population, which at the time of Domesday Book was about 13,000, but it is difficult to make an exact estimate on account of the ambiguity of the word servus.\n\nThe position of men was measured by7 the amount of weregild to be paid for them in cases of murder or injury by the offenders. Thus the weregild of an Ealdorman exceeded that of a ceorl or yeoman three times. We may7 here note that a Kentish shilling was worth more than five times as much as a shilling in AVessex or Mercia.\n\nThe General Council of the Realm was the Witenagemot, a non-elective body, summoned by royal writ and con sisting of the King, the princes of the blood, the great ecclesiastics, ealdormen, thanes, and soldiers. It met usually at Easter and Christmas; it considered all public acts before they received the Royal sanction, considered new laws, made peace, war, and alliances, elected and deposed the King, appointed, with the King, prelates, and generally controlled ecclesiastical matters, levied taxes, raised forces, and was the Supreme Court of Justice both in civil and criminal cases.\n\nKentish Witans were held at Faversham, Bapchild, Bearsted, Canterbury and Aylesford.\n\nShire or Folk Motes were held three times a year, always in the open air. Penenden Heath near Maidstone has been from time immemorial the great Kentish \"atherinc place, but all over the county place-names such as The\n\nMote, the Shire Oak, the Shire Stone commemorate the sites of these ancient assembly7 spots, just as the \"Gathering Stones\" of the North Country mark the ancient clan and tribal meeting places of that district.\n\nCourt Leets were held once in every three weeks in each Hundred in the open air for criminal matters, and at these all residents were bound to attend. Court Barons were manorial assemblies at which the free tenants were obliged to be present. As for the ancient Court of Dens, peculiar to the AA'eald of Kent, we can best refer readers to Mr. Furley7's exhaustive remarks upon it, and his confutation of Mr. Kemble's theory that it was an outcome of the old Mark system, in the volumes on the AA'eald of Kent to which we owe so much in this present work.\n\nThe County of Kent was divided as follows :—\n\n{empty}1.—Into East and AA'est Kent, and possibly into a\n\nthird part—Romney Marsh. Although this was nominally an ecclesiastical division, for somecen\n\nturies it remained practically a political division.\n\n2.—Laths : as peculiar to Kent as were Rapes or Ropes\n\nto Sussex, Ridings to Yorkshire, and Parts or Trithings to Lincolnshire. The word is said to be derived from gelathean, to gather together. There were seven Laths in Kent :—Canterbury, Eastry, Limen (afterwards Shepway), AA'ye,\n\nMilton, Sutton-at-Hone and Aylesford. (See Note F at end of Chapter).\n\n3.—The Laths were divided into Hundreds, it is con jectured, in the time of Alfred. In Domesday\n\nthere are 63 Kentish Hundreds; at present there\n\nare 73. AA'hat a Hundred consisted of is not\n\nknown, whether families, or persons, or hides of\n\nland, or villages.\n\n4.—The Hundreds were divided into Boroughs or\n\nTownships, consisting each of ten freemen or\n\nheads of families who were sureties for each\n\nother's good behaviour. The Borough head men\n\nwere known as Borsholders. (See Note G at end\n\nof Chapter).\n\nParishes, it is not generally known, were originally distinctly ecclesiastical divisions, and were not, as has been often asserted, co-extensive with manors.\n\n\"In Kent,\" says Mr. Furley, \" the sites of our AngloSaxon churches formed the nucleus of our present parochial system,\" and, say7s another writer, \" were circuits of ground committed to the charge of those who had the cure of souls therein.\"\n\nTo show how extremely conservative Kent has always remained in the matter of ancient rights and customs, it may be cited with regard to tenures that whilst on the Surrey Border the tenure of Borough English by which real property descends to the youngest son is general, AA'esterham is the only parish in Kent where it prevails. Again, in the manors of Bayham and Frant, each of which is situated half in Kent and half in Sussex) Gavelkind (inheritance equally* to all sons) prevails in the Kentish half, and primogeniture in the Sussex.\n\nAs briefly as is permissible let us review the remains of the old life in our county during the period between the departure of the Romans and the Norman Conquest, which are still visible.\n\n(I)—The Churches.\n\nIf it was only because the Anglo-Saxons built their churches generally of wood it is not surprising that so few specimens of their ecclesiastical architecture have been spared until our times. Indeed, the only specimens extant are mere fragments scattered here and there, such as the clerestory arches in the church of Minster in Sheppey, bits in walls such as those in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral, in the churches of St. Pancras and St. Martin, Canterbury, in the latter of which the font and a door are also Saxon, windows at Lyminge, and perhaps the nave of Orpington.\n\nThe chief religious foundations of this period, generally Benedictine, were Christ Church and St. Augustine's, Canterbury, between 598 and 605 a.d.; St. Martin's,\n\nDover, by Eadbald, son of Ethelbert, in 620; Folkestone Nunnery, also by Eadbald, in 630 : Lyminge in 633 by Ethelburga, the daughter of Ethelbert; Reculver in 669; Minster in Sheppey, 670; Minster in Thanet by Sexburga, Queen of Ercombert, King of Kent, in 675.\n\nThe clergy occupied a high position during this period. A high weregild was paid for them; the oath of a priest or deacon was worth more than that of a free man; they acted as lawyers in property transfers, but were bound like seculars by the services of tenures.\n\n(II)—Castles.\n\nAlthough under King AVidred Dover Castle was much strengthened, no traces of Saxon work are extant, except perhaps the outline of the defences of the ancient burgh. Of Saxon Rochester there are few (if any) traces. Allington, Canterbury and Chilham are on Saxon sites.\n\n(Ill)—Cemeteries.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon relics unearthed from the cemeteries of Kent are unequalled elsewhere in England both for quality as well as quantity. Almost every year brings us news of a fresli discovery, and, although the finest collection has left the county, enough remains to confirm the words of Mr. Wright:\n\n\"The Kentish graves, abounding in ornaments of gold and silver and other jewellery, and containing many articles indicating social refinement, show a people who were rich and powerful, far more so than the other AngloSaxon States where the precious metals are rarely found, and the gold ornaments are replaced by gilt bronze; and this explains to us the high position held by Kent towards the other States at the dawn of our Anglo-Saxon history.\"\n\nThe great superiority of the workmanship and of the designs of these Kentish relics over relics of the same character discovered elsewhere is thought to have been due to Roman influence, but we decline to assent to this. The chief Saxon and Romano-Saxon Cemeteries—for Roman\n\nE\n\nskeletons are often found alongside Saxon—are at Bifrons near Patrixbourne, Ozengall in Thanet, Bourne Park, Sarre, Sittingbourne, Gilton Town and Ash near Sandwich, Wingham, Breachdown, Eynesford, Lullingstone, King-stone, Sibertswold, Milton, Cliff, King's Mead, Faversham, along the hills on each side of the Medway Valley, and perhaps along the AVye Downs. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but is sufficient to show how widely distributed is this antiquarian wealth.\n\nThe most interesting articles are weapons, the metal parts of shields, armour, and horse furniture, knives, a few axes, fibidee or brooches of extraordinary variety—circular (characteristic of Kent) or cross-shaped, of gold, of filigree work, set with stones or enamelled, of bronze and brass and bronze gilt—rings of silver, bronze, bronze gilt and brass, ear-rings, arm-rings of gold, bead necklaces, spoons, crystal balls, vases, cups, urns, draughtsmen, keys, bead bracelets, chatelaines, hairpins, combs, scales and weights, and iron instruments of many kinds, glass drinking cups, gilt-bronze bowls, buckets, and, of course, Roman and Saxon coins. In Kent cremation does not seem to have been frequent. The bodies were buried in full dress, surrounded by the articles most associated with the lives of the dead, and these articles are so invariably placed according to rule that experienced excavators can tell exactly from the discovery of one how* the others will lie. Occasionally the discovery of bones in the mound above the grave shows that the very general custom of killing slaves or prisoners at funerals was practised by the Anglo-Saxons. As a rule Anglo-Saxon barrows are on hill tops, and in Kent at any rate are rarely solitary.\n\nOur Kentish place names are naturally strongly7 Saxon. Most of the names into which the syllable ing enters commemorate the settlement of tribes, families, or, as Mr. Kemble calls divisions of land held in common by several households or several men, of marks, and in Kent\n\nthese are very numerous. But they are hardly interesting etymologies when compared with some others around us. For instance, our sense of the ancient individuality, so to speak, or even importance of some present-day obscure village is not heightened much by the knowledge that it was the settling place of the Syllingas, or the Bilsingas, or the Semesingas; but when we connect it with mythology and the worship of deities of whom nothing else is left but the names of the days of the week, when we associate Eastry with Eostre, the Saxon Aurora, and AA'oodnesborough with AVoden, or Welling with the Scandinavian Vulcan, AA'ayland, or Thurnham with Thor, or Godmersham with Godmer, the British giant slain by Canutus, one of the companions of Brutus—as we have as much right to do as to associate them with other things just as misty and uncertain—they become invested with a special interest. At any rate, invaluable aid has been afforded to our Kentish diggers and delvers in the mine of the Past by names which at first sight suggest nothing.\n\nOf Kentish industries during the Saxon period that of corn growing was the first, despite the constant interruptions from invasion and war. Indeed it has been computed that as great an acreage was under cultivation in Kent in Saxon times as there was at the commencement of George III.'s reign.\n\nThere were extensive salt works near the coast—at Rochester, Canterbury, Lympne, Milton, and Faversham. There were vineyards at Leeds, Hailing, Chart Sutton, Teynham, and other places. AVool was already a staple commodity, and Canterbury was its chief market.\n\nNOTES ON THE KINGDOM OF KENT.\n\nA.\n\nThe mystery of the bones in Hythe crypt will probably never be satisfactorily cleared up. This is a summary of expert opinion :—\n\n(1) Only 10 out of 7*23 skulls examined show signs of injuries\n\ninflicted before death.\n\nE 2\n\n(2) The greater part of the skulls belong to Celtic and English races; two seem to be Roman; two to be Lap or Danish.\n\n(3) Skulls and bones belong chiefly to men in the prime of life; three belong to children, and one to a person who had not cut his wisdom teeth.\n\n(4) Previously to being buried, if they have been buried at all, the remains had evidently lain a long time "
