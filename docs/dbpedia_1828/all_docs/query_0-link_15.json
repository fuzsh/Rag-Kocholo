        "text": "With the Accession of HM King Charles III to the Throne of the United Kingdom, we see him take on the heraldry of a Monarch. Gone for him is the plain Label of an heir apparent and, in the absence of any directive yet as to style and design, the Coat of Arms of the Sovereign and therefore the United Kingdom remain the same as for Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. There are, of course, two different versions as Scotland has its own Blazon putting its country's Quarter first and fourth with England placed second. The Supporters, along with some subtle differences, are swapped over. The Chain of the Order of the Thistle replaces the Garter.\n\nHis Motto as Heir - Ich Dien - is dropped in favour of Dieu et Mon Droit and Nemo me impune lacessit.\n\nThe main question in most people's minds was the style of the Crown to be adopted. Queen Elizabeth II changed it from a Tudor Crown, favoured by her immediate male predecessors, to a more realistic representation of St Edward's Crown. With the announcement of His Majesty's Royal Cypher on 26th September by the College of Arms, the speculation ended, and the Tudor style Crown does appear to be confirmed to be that preferred by male monarchs. (Personally, I always viewed it to be a fallacy. But I was evidently misguided.) A representation of the Scottish Crown from the Honours of Scotland (and the Crown placed on Her late Majesty's coffin in St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh) will be used on the Cypher in Scotland, presumably confirmed by Lord Lyon King of Arms. There will be no major changes overnight, though.\n\nAs below, His Majesty takes on the plain Royal Banner (commonly known as the Royal Standard) and here, again, there are the two versions. The Scottish version was much in evidence in the first days after Her late Majesty's death as it was draped over he coffin until she crossed the border into England, having passed away at Balmoral.\n\nI did however notice something during the time immediately after the death of Queen Elizabeth II and her travels down from Scotland to London. The Irish quarter on the Standard is definitely the old-fashioned version with the bare-breasted woman on the pillar. The version on the Coat of Arms is the Celtic one which was traditionally said to be introduced in 1952 to save the blushes of the new Queen. The version on both Standards draped over Her late Majesty's coffin was the old one.\n\nThe next to change is Camilla who is now Queen Consort. The changes to her heraldry reflect more the changes to her husband's as mentioned above. As Queen Consort, she does take on the full Crown like her husband. This resolves the potential problem of what she could possible have born as Princess Consort.\n\nCoat of Arms of HM Camilla, Queen Consort of the United Kingdom. Image source: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\n​Her Majesty's Banners are correspondingly amended as below. As Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla was created Royal Lady of the Garter by Her late Majesty at the beginning of this year. She was installed and actually took the place of the late Duke of Edinburgh in St George's Chapel, Windsor. This was shown in the coverage of The Queen's funeral. Also shown was Camilla's Banner above her Stall as Duchess of Cornwall with her family Arms marshalled with those of Charles as the Prince of Wales. I presume that this will be changed.\n\nIt is not known whether Camilla actually made use of a specific Standard as Duchess of Cornwall in daily life. Whilst it would not have been impossible, it is probable that she would have used the version with the Ermine Border. Unless anyone knows any differently...\n\nThe final major change at present is with the new Prince and Princess of Wales. For one day, William and Catherine were TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge. The Charter which established the Estate of the Duchy of Cornwall on 17th March 1337 set out the rule that the Duke would be the eldest (surviving) son and heir apparent of the monarch. This was confirmed in a legal case in 1606. Both these criteria have to be met or the Duchy falls into abeyance. (King George V became Duke of Cornwall as the eldest surviving son of King Edward VII, his elder brother Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence having predeceased him. King George VI did not as, whilst being King Edward VIII's heir, he was the next brother of the Monarch.) Even with the The Succession to the Crown Act (2013), there is currently no provision for the eventuality that the direct heir presumptive is female. Unless and until Prince George's eldest child is a girl or Prince George predeceases his father and/or grandfather with no children of his own, this matter will not arise for at least two generations and therefore does not need to be legislated for yet.\n\nThe title Prince of Wales, however, is conferred at the choice of the Monarch and, whilst in practise is carried by a male heir, he does not necessarily have to be the eldest surviving son. It can be the eldest surviving grandson, as in the case of King George III, whose father Frederick Prince of Wales predeceased his father in turn, King George II.\n\nAs such, King Charles III decided to announce in his televised speech, the day after his Mother passed away, that William and Catherine were Prince and Princess of Wales. William and Catherine's Coats of Arms changed to the plain Label, dropping the red Spencer escallop. Again, it is currently believed that the style of the Arms is of a simple version without any specific announcement yet.\n\n​Both also use the Crown of the Heir with one simple Arch, although Catherine also changes the Coronet around the neck of her white Hind supporter from that of a grandchild of the Monarch to that of a child (in law) of the Monarch.\n\nImmediately at the demise of Her late Majesty, William and Catherine also became Duke and Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland. William has taken on the Arms of the Heir to the Scottish Throne. It is not yet know whether Catherine will make use or be entitled to her own version of Scottish Arms.\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH Catherine, Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. Image source: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nCoat of Arms of The Duke of Sussex as a grandchild of the Monoach. Image source: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nThe first expected change, which hasn't yet been announced, is for Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex who now becomes the son of a monarch. His Arms are expected to change accordingly. This was confirmed by the College of Arms back in 2002. (Please see this link ​College of Arms)\n\nAs all grandchildren of a monarch (apart from his elder brother William as direct heir), Harry was granted a five-pointed Label when he became 18 in September 2002. His is 'charged' with red Spencer Escallops, in memory of his Mother, on the first, third and fifth points. Now that Harry has become the son of the Monarch, his Label should be reduced to three Points and it was agreed that the two blank Points would disappear, leaving three, each of them charged with a red Escallop.\n\nThere is an instance where the Labels were not upgraded and that is the anomaly of King Edward VII's daughters, which has been highlighted previously. They were never upgraded heraldically.\n\nThe illustration above from Sodacan does, however, show an 'upgrade' in Harry's Coronet. Gone are the external Strawberry Leaves for the son of the heir and in are the full set of Crosses Pattée and Fleurs-de-Lys for the child of a monarch.\n\n​Whilst it has been highly publicised that the Duke of Sussex is no longer a working Royal and no longer uses the rank Your Royal Highness, he is legally His Royal Highness the Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. His wife legally remains HRH Meghan the Duchess of Sussex. Their children, in turn, legally become, as grandchildren of a monarch, HRH Prince Archie of Sussex and HRH Princess Lilibet of Sussex. However, no official announcement has been made, and Harry and his children remain The Duke of Sussex, Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Miss Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor in the Line of Succession on the Royal Family's website.\n\nThe other expected change which has not been announced is for HRH The Price Edward, Earl of Wessex and Forfar. At the time of his marriage to Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999, he was granted the title of Earl with the provision that he would be granted the Dukedom of Edinburgh on the demise of both his parents. This seemed appropriate considering Edward's involvement in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. (Also, a little highlighted fact is that 'Earl' is or at least was one of Edward's nicknames, coming from the initials of his first names - Edward Anthony Richard Louis.)\n\nAs it happened, HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh died first and, under the Grant of 1947, the title went to his first-born son, Charles. With the death of The Queen and Charles's elevation to King, the title 'merged with the Crown' and therefore became available to be granted anew. Like the confirmation of Camilla as Queen Consort and the naming of Prince William as Prince of Wales, it would have made sense to me if Edward had been granted the Dukedom of Edinburgh on the visit of the new King to the Scottish Parliament, in Edinburgh, on his his Accession Tour of the United Kingdom. This, however, did not happen and so we are awaiting news.\n\nThis may have an impact should Edward and Sophie chose to be granted Arms. Lady Louise would therefore legally become HRH Princes Louise of Edinburgh (with her brother becoming HRH Prince James of Edinburgh) and as she became 18 shortly before Christmas last year, she would be entitled to a Grant of Arms. Again, this has to be awaited.\n\nFinally, something which also happened automatically, but which has no bearing on titles or Arms, is the fact that HRH Princess Beatrice, Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, elder daughter of the Duke of York, becomes a Counsellors of State under the Regency Act. With the Accession of King Charles III, everyone basically moved up a place and Princess Beatrice now fills the gap as she becomes the fourth adult in line to the Throne. Counsellors of State are authorised to carry out most official duties in the absence of the Sovereign due to illness or travel abroad. Day-to-day support of the Sovereign will, in all probability, continue to be given by HRH The Princess Royal and TRH the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who have (except the Countess) previously acted as Counsellors of State but who are now further down the Line of Succession.\n\nPlease remember that these are still relatively early days and matters are subject to development, especially in the run-up to the expected Coronation.\n\nTomb of Richard the Lionheart in Fontevraud Abbey, Loire Valley , France. Photo source: https://www.historyextra.com/\n\nRichard I (8th September 1157 – 6th April 1199) was King of England from 1189 until his death in 1199. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus and Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, and seemed unlikely to become King, but all his brothers except the youngest, John, predeceased their father. Richard is known as Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.\n\nBy the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father. Richard was an important Christian commander during the Third Crusade, leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and achieving considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, although he finalized a peace treaty and ended the campaign without retaking Jerusalem.\n\nRichard was born in England, where he spent his childhood. Before becoming King, however, he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine, in the southwest of France. Following his accession, he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England. Most of his life as King was spent on Crusade, in captivity (he was captured shortly before Christmas 1192 near Vienna by Leopold of Austria and was famously ransommed off) or actively defending his lands in France. Rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler, he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies. Nevertheless, he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects. He remains one of the few kings of England remembered more commonly by his epithet than his regnal number, and is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France.\n\nAs we saw with King John, the second Great Seal of Richard I (1195) shows him bearing a shield depicting three lions passant guardant. This is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon, which later became established as the Royal Arms of England. It is likely, therefore, that Richard introduced this heraldic design. In his earlier Great Seal of 1189, he had used either one lion rampant or what many believe to depict two lions rampant combatant, Arms which he may have adopted from his father.\n\nSecond Great Seal of Richard I. Vintage Print from 1845. Photo source: https://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/\n\nRichard added the third Lion on his second Great Seal (sometime between May 21st and Michaelmas in 1195) as shown by Exchequer accounts or 'Pipe Rolls'. This was to reinforce his position on his return from captivity on the Continent during which time this brother John had tried to launch a rebellion against Richard's regents. Also, by creating a new Great Seal, Richard was able to raise funds from charging to renew old charters under the old Seal. This is believed to have caused a delay in implementing the new Seal until the Spring of 1198.\n\nThe coat of three Lions continues to represent England on several coins, forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (such as the England national football team and the team's \"Three Lions\" anthem) and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.\n\n​More interesting for Richard heraldically was his first Great Seal. ​\n\nHis Seal shows Richard on horseback, galloping to the right, as shown in the photograph here. His Shield is heavily curved and only shows one half bearing a complete Lion rampant towards the sinister (i.e. the left, according to the Shield-Bearer). Lions are usually shown rampant to the dexter unless it is face-to-face with another Lion on the other half of the Shield which, in this instance, is not shown. Equally, a boss is shown on the profile of the Shield, implying that there is another side the Shield and that the one Lion isn't just squashed into the visible half. If this Lion is not to be taken as an anomaly, Richard's Coat of Arms would only be heraldically correct as Two Lions combatant.\n\nThis idea may appear to be supported by both an eyewitness account of Richard's saddle from the Itinerary of Richard I whilst on Crusade in 1191 and by the poet William the Breton (although he wrote 30 years later). However, other contemporary examples would argue against this and simply reflect artistic license.\n\nReverse of the First Great Seal of King Richard I of England, exhibited in History Museum of Vendée - Les Lucs-sur-Boulogne, Vendée, France. Photo source: Wikipedia/Selbymay.\n\nEven Lions passant (walking) are shown fully within the visible half of the Shield. This includes Richard's three Lions and King John's two as Lord of Ireland. Both the 1171 Seal of Philip d'Alsace, Count of Flanders and Patrick, 6th Earl of Dunbar roughly a century later show a whole Lion rampant within the visible half of the Shield on the equestrian figure on the reverse side but show a whole shield and still just one rampant Lion on the obverse side. On both of Richard's Great Seals, the obverse side simply shows Richard enthroned with symbols of suns, moons, stars and what look like representations of Planta Genista, the broom plant Badge of the Plantagenet Dynasty. There are no other Shields to make a comparison.\n\nEither way, the Shield carried by a king of England in the equestrian figure on the Seal was shown facing away from the viewer up until Richard's father, King Henry II. It therefore cannot be used to confirm anything other than that heraldic devises of any significance were not carried on the front of the Shield. otherwise they would have been shown.\n\nThere is an argument that two Lions back-to-back (or addorsed) were more common at that time and, hence, would have lead to more ambiguity for heraldists then. There is more evidence that, at the time of the beginnings of what we now know as heraldry, heraldic beasts could be portrayed facing either way and this shown with the same Coat of Arms in what we would nowadays effectively consider as inconsistency. The saddle described in the Itinerary may simply have shown decoration rather than anything heraldic.\n\nThat both his uncle, William FitxEmpress, and his half-brother, William Longespée, used a single Lion rampant and that an upright single Lion would have fitted better onto Shields and the tall, upright banners of the time - one such description, from the Itinerary, clearly states a single Lion on Richard's banner (ad regium cum leone ​vexillum) which agrees with a description in the the account of the Third Crusade by Ambrose - clearly suggest that it is highly unlikely that Richard bore anything other than one Lion rampant until his second Great Seal of 1189/95.\n\nThe question, therefore, is where did Richard get the Arms of two Lions passant to add the third Lion to...?\n\nThe Coat of Arms and Flag of Normandy famously show two golden Lions passant on red. Whilst the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey have changed to three Lions, Sark retains the two - The Channel Islands used to be part of Normandy. This Coat of Arms, and even the three Lions, have been erroneously attributed to King William I of England (The Conqueror). Erroneously, because heraldry as we know it didn't exist then.\n\nLions, very much in general at that stage, appear to have been used by the descendants of King Henry I of England, a younger son of The Conqueror. Henry's son-in-law, Geoffrey of Anjou, is probably one of the first people to have adopted a inheritable Coat of Arms showing not only a Lion but a number of Lions (six to be specific). Having lost his only son William in the sinking of the White Ship, Henry was keen to keep in with Geoffrey, the husband of Henry's only other child, Maud, especially as he needed a grandson as heir. (Women, though often instrumental in the order of succession, were generally not looked upon favourably to take on sovereignty in those dark days.)\n\n​Within a few years of Henry I's death he was being described as the 'Lion of Justice' and his (illegitimate) sons 'the cubs of the lion'. He is known to have kept lions and leopards in his menagerie at Woodstock. All of these would only go to show Henry's association with Lions as a symbol.\n\nHenry's nephew and successor, Stephen, has been with attributed one or three Sagittaries (half man, half horse - with or without a bow and arrow) as he ascended the Throne under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and also with the help of archers. These are purely conjecture from later generations. A royal Banner is known to have existed, but unfortunately, although recorded as closely guarded, no contemporary detailed description exists.\n\nAnd so we come to Richard and John's father King Henry II. Grandson of Henry I through the Maud who had been sidestepped earlier, he is certainly described as carrying Arms but, again, no detailed description exists and, as mentioned, his Shield on his Seal still faces away. His father, brother, sons even, chamberlains and attendants are all known to have used Lions in one way or another, and Henry II was again associated with or variously described as a 'lion', like his grandfather. Henry II looked more to his royal and ducal inheritance through his mother and the grandfather after whom he was named, rather than his father, however capable a person Geoffrey of Anjou was.\n\nUnfortunately, the two Lions of Normandy did not become fixed until centuries after Henry II and the idea that men whom Henry II knighted used two Lions according to the practise of 'patron-in-chivalry' cannot be used to fully justify Henry's use. However, the use of the two Lions, amongst other devices, by so many men closely associated with Henry II, including, after the death of his eldest son, Henry the Young King, his favourite son John, might have meant that Richard wanted to trump them by swapping from one Lion to three!\n\n​\n\nBerengaria of Navarre\n\nBefore leaving Cyprus on crusade, Richard married Berengaria, the first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre. Richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native Navarre. The wedding was held in Limassol on 12th May 1191 at the Chapel of St George and was attended by Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour. Many feasts and entertainments, public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event. When Richard married Berengaria he was still officially betrothed to Alys, the daughter of Louis VII of France, and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the Kingdom of Navarre as a fief, as Aquitaine had been for his father. Further, Eleanor championed the match with Berengaria, as Navarre bordered Aquitaine, thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands. Richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly, though they returned separately. Berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did, and she did not see England until after his death. After his release from German captivity, Richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct, but he was not reunited with his wife. The marriage remained childless.\n\nBy the 15th century, the mythology of the Coat of Arms would trace its origin back to the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 involving Berengaria's brother, Sancho VII, where the cavalry broke the chains of the caliph's slave-warriors and captured an emerald, among other prizes.\n\nThey may equally be a development of Berengaria's or, rather, her father's Arms - a change of colours, etc - as the white Cross pommy on blue does resemble a simplified carbuncle as well.\n\nA portrait of King John hunting (England, 14th century): British Library, Cotton MS Claudius D II, f. 11r. Photo source: https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/index.html\n\nJohn (24th December 1166 – 19th October 1216) was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands. However, he also lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian Dynasty during the 13th century. He became his father's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173–74 by his brothers Henry the Young King, Richard and Geoffrey. John was appointed Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent and unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion himself against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard I, whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but was still proclaimed King after Richard died in 1199. He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise personal possession of the continental Angevin lands at the Peace Treaty of Le Goulet in 1200.\n\nWhen war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton, and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. He spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. His judicial reforms had a lasting effect on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute he finally settled in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed because of the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis VIII of France, which soon descended into stalemate. John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year.\n\nContemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the current historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\". Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", such as pettiness, spitefulness, and cruelty.\n\nWith John, before and after his accession to the Throne, we come to an interesting period in the development of the Coat of Arms of England and the distinctive three gold Lions on a red background. Some would conjecture that it was John's rebellious nature towards his elder brother which lead to the 'upgrade'.\n\nLions had already been emblems of kings and higher nobility for many years. King Richard I was, of course, nicknamed 'The Lionheart'. Advances in armour, such as the barrel helmet, were making identification in battle more important and more problematic during the 12th century and so a more organised system of what became heraldry became more important than just 'emblems'. Whilst the dragon banner had long been associated with England, the use of Lions was becoming more popular within Continental Europe and the family and allies of the Normans. Two gold Lions on red have been the Arms of Normandy for many centuries now. They were attributed to William the Conqueror, Richard and John's notable ancestor, and it is conjectured that their father, King Henry II, took these two Lions and added the single Aquetaine Lion of his wife Eleanor to make up the now distinctive Shield of England. This, however, is all conjecture.\n\nJohn had opposed the men Richard had appointed as regents in his absence on his Crusade, and had rebelled. On the Lionheart's return a number of other things happened. Firstly, Richard reconciled himself with John and appointed him his heir in place of their nephew Arthur. This may have been to ensure more control over John as Richard also confiscated his lands. Richard also went through a second Coronation on 17th April 1194, some say to to nullify the shame of his captivity whilst on Crusade when he was handed over to Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI and ransommed off. Some say it was to ensure he was the recognised ruler of the Kingdom.\n\nTwo Lions passant (i.e. walking) were associated with King Henry II, whether they were guardant (looking out) or not. They were certainly John's Arms as Prince and Lord of Ireland, and also associated with his rebel supporters, especially in the period 1194 and 1195. It was therefore not enough for Richard just to inherit his father's Arms, but a necessity to build on them to again emphasise his position. King Richard I's second Great Seal, produced sometime between May and Michaelmas 1195, shows the first evidence of the change to three Lions.\n\nIn turn, when Richard died in 1199, John had a choice. Up until then, succession to the English Throne had been no easy matter. Since the Conquest, William II and Richard I had been the only Anglo-Norman Kings who had directly succeeded their fathers. This instability may well have been reflected in the ruling house's late adaptation of a single, hereditary Shield, in comparison, for instance, with France. Thus, John's adoption of his brother's three Lions, whilst not a foregone conclusion, was a wise move in indicating he had come into his elder brother's full inheritance.\n\n​The rest, as they say, is history...\n\nJohn's tomb (the oldest royal effigy in England) in Worcester Cathedral (shown here in photographs from the author's personal collection) shows the English Arms on its stone plinth. However, this plinth was a later addition, made in the 16th century at the same time as the nearby magnificent monuments to Prince Arthur, Prince of Wales, brother of King Henry VIII..\n\nJohn was not a lucky King, as we have seen. Legend has it that he lost the Crown Jewels in The Wash - a bay and estuary in eastern England known to be surrounded by low-lying marshy land and riddled with quicksand - whilst on his last campaign when he was already fatally ill. Some say, however, that only a few pack-horses were lost, and the exact location has never been confirmed.\n\nHe remains the only English/British King of that name, not helped by the fact that John Baliol, King of Scotland a little while later, is thought of as a largely ineffectual King. Only two other members of the British Royal Family have been given the name - HRH Prince Alexander John of Wales (youngest son of the later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) and HRH The Prince John (youngest son of Alexander John's elder brother King George V and Queen Mary). Alexander John was born prematurely in 1871 and died 24 hours later. Prince John is famous as the 'Lost Prince'. He was epileptic and was kept from the public eye at Sandringham until he died after a severe seizure in 1916 at the age of only 13. His illness was disclosed to the wider public only after his death.\n\n​\n\nIsabella of Angoulême\n\nJohn's first marriage, to heiress Isabella of Gloucester, had been annulled shortly prior to his accession due to consanguinity. She was also a descendant of Henry I, although her grandfather was that King's illegitimate son. The marriage was doomed as, despite his father making Isabella sole heiress to the Gloucester lands, John lost them on the annulment.\n\nJohn soon became infatuated with another Isabella, Isabella of Angoulême (c. 1186/1188 – 4th June 1246). She became Countess of Angoulême in 1202, a couple of years after marriage at about 12 or 14 years of age and her elaborate Coronation in Westminster Abbey on 8th October 1200. However, she had been betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan, and, a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued.\n\n​John was really living up to his nickname by now!\n\nCoat of Arms of Isabella of Angoulême, Queen Consort and second wife of King John. Author: Wikipedia/Jacques63\n\nRumours abounded that John was so infatuated that he would stay in bed till noon and Isabella was described as 'more Jezebel than Isabel' by her harsher critics. Notwithstanding the criticism, John and Isabella had five children, all of whom survived into adulthood. When John died in October 1216, Isabella's first act was to arrange the speedy Coronation of her nine-year-old son, Henry, at Gloucester on 28th October. As the Crown Jewels had supposedly recently been lost in The Wash, Isabella supplied her own golden circlet to be used instead.\n\nIn the Spring of 1220, Isabella married Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children. Hugh was the son of her former fiancé and was actually promised to Isabella's daughter Joan. The mother still retained the beauty which had entranced John and so Joan was promised to the King of Scotland. Unfortunately, Isabella did not seek permission from the King's Council to re-marry and so, like her first husband, had lands and her pension as Queen Dowager taken off her.\n\nIsabella was possessed of a fiery temper, which had been the equal of her first husband, but meant she didn't take kindly to being a virtually penniless countess in France. Some of Isabella's contemporaries, as well as later writers, claim that she formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France in 1241, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile, for whom she had a deep-seated hatred. In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the King when two cooks confessed to having been in Isabella's pay. To avoid arrest, she sought refuge in Fontevraud Abbey, where she died two years later.\n\n​\n\nIsablla's family Arms - Lozengy or and gueles - are shown on the tomb of her son by her second husband, William de Valance, Earl of Pembroke in Westminster Abbey.\n\n​\n\nRichard, Earl of Cornwall\n\nRichard (5th or 6th January 1209 – 2nd April 1272) was the second son of King John and Isabella. He was created Earl of Cornwall on 30th May 1227.\n\nBetween then and 1238 he frequently opposed his brother, King Henry III, by joining the barons in several crises. However, he never proceeded to rebellion but always made Henry pay heavily for reconciliation. He took the cross in 1236 and led a small English force to the Holy Land from June 1240 to January 1242, refortifying Ascalon and negotiating an advantageous treaty. During Henry III’s disastrous Poitevin campaign in France in 1242, Richard’s prompt retreat at Saintes and his persuasive diplomacy at Taillebourg saved Henry from capture. While acting regent of England during Henry’s Gascon visit (1253–54), Richard summoned knights to represent the shires at the critical Easter Parliament of 1254. Reputedly the richest magnate in England, he refused Pope Innocent IV’s offer of the Sicilian crown (1252–53), saying, according to Matthew Paris, “You might as well say, ‘I make you a present of the moon - step up to the sky and take it down’.” Instead, his brother King Henry purchased the kingdom for his own son Edmund. Richard accepted imperial candidature in 1256. Purchasing four of the seven electoral votes, Richard was elected King of the Romans and was crowned at Aachen on 17th May 1257. By lavish bribery he gained recognition throughout the Rhineland, returning home in January 1259.\n\nRichard helped Henry to overthrow the Provisions of Oxford, but from June to October 1260 he again visited Germany, then discovering the impossibility of his hopes of the imperial crown.\n\nHe again helped Henry invaluably against the rebel barons (1263–64) but was captured at Lewes on 14th May 1264 and was imprisoned at Wallingford and then at Kenilworth until the overthrow of Simon de Montfort at Evesham on 4th August 1265. He then worked ceaselessly to obtain the relatively moderate settlement of the Dictum of Kenilworth on 31st October 1266. His fourth and last visit to Germany from August 1268 to August 1269 is notable only for his third marriage, to Beatrice of Falkenburg.\n\nRichard's claims to Gascony and Poitou were never more than nominal, and in 1241 King Louis IX of France invested his own brother Alphonse with Poitou. Richard and Henry were encouraged to recover Poitou by their stepfather, Hugh X of Lusignan, but the expedition turned into a military fiasco after Hugh betrayed them. Having said that, Richard did not take on a version of the English Arms but those of Poitou, namely:\n\nArgent, a Lion rampant gules within a Bordure sable bezanty.\n\nIt is argued that these Arms represent both Poitou and Cornwall with the red Lion going back to William FitzEmpress who had also been a Count Poitou and the Bezants on black already representing Cornwall and, quite bizarrely, their propensity for being the most enterprising and prosperous merchants and pawnbrokers in all England, the symbol of the association of pawnbrokers being fifteen gold balls!\n\nIt is also argued that they are 15 gold coins to represent a ransom paid to the Saracens to release Richard from captivity.\n\nHowever, James Planché (Somerset Herald in the 18th century) discovered a neglected manuscript later called the Planché Roll after him which showed that the Bezants (the golden balls) originated in Poitou and not the other way round. In reality, they represented golden peas (pois in French) and were so a pun on the name Poitou. The Arms of Cornwall were actually designed in the 15th century, based on Richard's Arms.\n\nWhen he was elected and crowned King of the Romans, he placed his Poitou Arms as a dynastic Inescutcheon onto the breast of the Imperial Eagle.\n\nThe Poitou/Cornwall Arms were used by Richard's surviving son, Edmund, by his second wife (Sanchia of Provence) as second Earl. Edmund, however, died with no issue and so Edmund's entire estate passed to the Crown, excepting a dower for his widow, Margaret, sister of Gilbert de Clare.\n\nHenry III (1st October 1207 – 16th November 1272) was elder son and heir of King John and was nine years old when he came to the Throne on his father's death. At that time, London and much of eastern England were in the hands of rebel barons led by Prince Louis (later King Louis VIII of France), son of the French King Philip II Augustus. Henry was therefore hastily crowned at Gloucester Abbey on 28th October 1216 and then again with full ceremonial in Westminster Abbey on 17th May 1220. A regency council presided over by the venerable William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, was formed to rule for Henry. By 1217 the rebels had been defeated and Louis forced to withdraw from England. After Pembroke’s death in 1219 Hubert de Burgh ran the government until he was dismissed by Henry in 1232. Two ambitious Frenchmen, Peter des Roches and Peter des Rivaux, then dominated Henry’s regime until the barons brought about their expulsion in 1234. That event marked the beginning of Henry’s personal rule.\n\nAlthough Henry was charitable and cultured, he lacked the ability to rule effectively. In diplomatic and military affairs he proved to be arrogant yet cowardly, ambitious yet impractical. The breach between the King and his barons (who had quarrelled with his father) began as early as 1237, when they expressed outrage at the influence exercised over the government by Henry’s Savoyard relatives. The marriage arranged by Henry in 1238 between his sister, Eleanor, and his brilliant young French favourite, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, increased foreign influence and further aroused the nobility’s hostility. In 1242 Henry’s Lusignan half brothers involved him in a costly and disastrous military venture in France. The barons then began to demand a voice in selecting Henry’s counsellors, but the King repeatedly rejected their proposal. Finally, in 1254 Henry made a serious mistake. He concluded an agreement with Pope Innocent IV, offering to finance Papal wars in Sicily if the Pope would grant his infant son, Edmund, the Sicilian crown. Four years later Pope Alexander IV threatened to excommunicate Henry for failing to meet this financial obligation. Henry appealed to the barons for funds, but they agreed to cooperate only if he would accept far-reaching reforms. These measures, the Provisions of Oxford, provided for the creation of a 15-member privy council, selected (indirectly) by the barons, to advise the King and oversee the entire administration. The barons, however, soon quarrelled among themselves and Henry seized the opportunity to renounce the Provisions in 1261. In April 1264 de Montfort, who had emerged as Henry’s major baronial opponent, raised a rebellion; the following month he defeated and captured the King and his eldest son, Edward, at the Battle of Lewes, Sussex on 14th May 1264. De Montfort ruled England in Henry’s name until he was defeated and killed by Edward at the Battle of Evesham, Worcestershire, in August 1265. Henry, weak and senile, then allowed Edward to take charge of the government until Edward ascended the Throne in his own right on Henry's death in 1272.\n\nHenry's life work was the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey in the new Gothic style of architechture. The tile showing Henry's Coat of Arms, which he inherited from his father, is taken from the floor of the Chapter House of the Abbey. Henry had a magnificent funeral and his body was temporarily buried in the old grave of Edward the Confessor, whom Henry venerated, in the Abbey. Nineteen years later he was placed in the splendid tomb put up by his son Edward I to the north of the Shrine of St Edward, although his heart was delivered to the Abbey at Fontevrault in France as Henry had wished. Although Henry's tomb shows no heraldry as such, the metal plate on which the King lies, the pillows beneath his head and his shoes are decorated with the lions of England.\n\n​\n\nEleanor of Provence\n\nEleanor of Provence (c. 1223 – 24th/25th June 1291) was the second of the four daughters of Berengar, Count of Provence, and Beatrice of Savoy. Eleanor became Queen Consort of England as the wife of King Henry III from 1236 until his death in 1272. She served as regent of England during the absence of her spouse in 1253.\n\nAlthough she was completely devoted to her husband and staunchly defended him against the rebel Simon de Montfort, she was very much hated by Londoners. She had brought many relatives with her to England in her retinue. They were known as \"the Savoyards\" and were given influential positions in government. On one occasion, Eleanor's barge was attacked by angry Londoners who pelted her. The fact that she brought no dowry with her did not help her reputation.\n\nEleanor was renowned for her learning, cleverness, and skill at writing poetry. She was also known for her beauty and as a leader of fashion, importing clothes from France.\n\nEleanor and Henry had five children together. They possibly had four other sons who died in childhood as did Katherine, but their existence is in doubt as there is no contemporary record of them.\n\nEdward I (1239–1307) - See his Blog.\n\nMargaret (1240–1275) married King Alexander III of Scotland, by whom she had issue.\n\nBeatrice (1242–1275), married John II, Duke of Brittany, by whom she had issue.\n\nEdmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster (1245–1296) - See below.\n\nKatherine (25 November 1253 – 3 May 1257)\n\nWhilst the Coat of Arms of her father may be shown dimidiating with King Henry's, this may be apocryphal as impalements of this nature were not yet in use and Eleanor's Seals as Queen only show Henry's Arms.\n\nThere is, however, a theory that England owes its Badge of the Rose to Eleanor as it is believed that the rose plant was brought to Provence by returning Crusaders and introduced to England by the Queen. Before the Wars of the Roses and the Tudor Dynasty, many of Eleanor's descendants used the Rose as a Badge, including the golden Rose of Provence used by her son King Edward I. The County of Hampshire is believed to have adopted the Rose as an emblem due to its association with Henry and Eleanor's family. Henry had been born at Winchester.\n\n​\n\nEdmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster\n\n​Edmund Crouchback (16th January 1245 – 5th June 1296), Earl of Lancaster, Leicester, and Derby, was the second surviving son of Henry and Eleanor.\n\nIn his childhood he had a claim on the Kingdom of Sicily; however, the cost of the scheme was unpopular and he never ruled there.\n\n​He was granted all the lands of Simon de Montfort, slain at the Battle of Evesham, in 1265, and from 1267 he was given the title Earl of Leicester. In that year he also began to rule Lancashire, but he did not take the title Earl of Lancaster until 1276. Between 1276 and 1284 he governed the counties of Champagne and Brie with his second wife, Blanche of Artois, in the name of her daughter Joan, and was described in the English patent rolls as Earl of Lancaster and Champagne.\n\nCoat of Arms of Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Leicester and Lancaster. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nHis nickname, \"Crouchback\", is probably a corruption of 'Crossback' referring to 'taking the Cross' and participating in the Ninth Crusade rather than any deformity.\n\nTomb of Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, north side of the chapel of St Edward the Confessor, Westminster Abbey. Photo source: https://www.westminster-abbey.org/\n\nEdmund appears to be the first English prince to have been specifically granted a Label. In this case it was of three Points azure (blue) and each Point carried three gold Fleurs-de-Lys, which is generally called a Label of France. There appears to be no specific reason why this Label was chosen as it predates his marriage to his French second wife, Blanche. The previous second son of an English King, who would himself become King John, had a different Coat of Arms before he ascended the Throne as we will see. These were the early days of Heraldry and practices changed about. The Label of France soon became associated with the Ducky of Lancaster, however, and not only followed Edmund's line down but also remains the Coat of Arms for the Duchy to this day.\n\nUnfortunately, to add to any confusion, Edmund's elaborate tomb shows various Shields with various Labels - plain or fleury, four or five-pointed.\n\nEdmund's second wife was Blanche of Artois, daughter of Robert, Count of Artois who was the Son of Louis VIII le Lion, King of France, and Blanche de Castille. Her Arms were therefore of France with a red Label, each of the Points of which showed three gold Castles for Castille. She was the widow of Henry I, King of Navarre and was herself Countess Palatine of Champagne. After Henry of Navarre's death she became regent in the name of their infant daughter, Joan I. She passed on the regency of Navarre to Philip III of France, her cousin and her daughter's prospective father-in-law, but retained the administration of Champagne which she later shared with Edmund.\n\nEdmund and Blanche's elder son, Thomas, succeeded as Earl in 1296 and carried his father's Arms. He died childless.\n\nThomas's younger brother, Henry, is heraldically more interesting. He was summoned to Parliament on 6th February 1298/99 by writ directed to Henrico de Lancastre nepoti Regis (\"Henry of Lancaster, nephew of the king\", Edward I), by which he is held to have become Baron Lancaster. He carried the Arms of England with a Baston azure for difference.\n\nAfter a period of longstanding opposition to King Edward II and his advisors, including joining two open rebellions, Henry's elder brother Thomas had been convicted of treason, executed and had his lands and titles forfeited in 1322. Henry had not participate in his brother's rebellions but he later petitioned for his brother's lands and titles. On 29th March 1324 Henry was invested as Earl of Leicester. He dropped the Baston and took up the Label of France. It was Henry's younger granddaughter, also Blanche, who married John of Gaunt from whom the Lancastrian Kings of England are descended and who took on the Label of France as well.\n\nEdward I (17th/18th June 1239 – 7th July 1307) was born over night at the Palace of Westminster to King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. He was named after King Edward the Confessor, whom his piousfather revered, having rebuilt and enlarged the Confessor's Abbey church at Westminster. Edward was also known as Edward Longshanks, because of his height, and the Hammer of the Scots, because... he hammered the Scots, having also tried it with the Welsh on the way.\n\n​Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included briefly siding with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford, in 1259. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey.\n\nEdward’s Seals before he became King, when he was simply described as “Henry’s son”, his Arms show England with a Label of five Points – presumably blue, as shown in Glover’s Roll – as his son Alfonso would show. When he became King, Edward dropped the Label and showed the three gold Lions passant on red of his father. This is supported by his Great Seal which shows, not only his Arms on his Shield but also, for the first time, on the Caparison (or ornamental covering) on his horse.\n\nEdward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. He investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, and reformed criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276–77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282–83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards the Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the Kingdom. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after King Philip IV of France had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his Duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. By the mid-1290s extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. When the King died of dysentery in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems. Edward I’s wish was for his body to be carried at the head of the army into battle with the Scots, but, although possibly prepared for, this wish was not carried out.\n\nEdward I was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man. Nevertheless, he held the respect for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith.\n\nEleanor of Castile\n\nEleanor of Castile (1241 – 28th November 1290) was born in Burgos, daughter of Ferdinand III of Castile and Joan, Countess of Ponthieu and was the first wife of Edward I, whom she married as part of a political deal to affirm English sovereignty over Gascony.\n\nThe marriage was known to be particularly close and Eleanor travelled extensively with her husband. She was with him on the Ninth Crusade, when he was wounded at Acre, but the popular story of her saving his life by sucking out the poison has long been discredited. When she died, at Harby near Lincoln, her grieving husband famously ordered a stone cross to be erected at each stopping-place on the journey to London, ending at Charing Cross - Charing being traditionally thought to be a corruption of the French \"Chère Reine\" meaning \"Dear Queen\". Her name is also, traditionally, held to be the origin of the area \"Elephant and Castle\" in London (a corruption of \"Eleanor of Castile\"). Both of these legends have recently been called in to question, though.\n\nEleanor was better educated than most medieval queens, her father and half-brother, Alfonso X, encouraging extensive education of royal children, and exerted a strong cultural influence on the nation. She was a keen patron of literature, and encouraged the use of tapestries, carpets and tableware in the Spanish style, as well as innovative garden designs. She was also a successful businesswoman, endowed with her own fortune as Countess of Ponthieu.\n\nEleanor's father's Arms of Castile and Leon represent the uniting of the two Kingdoms in his person and provide one of the earliest examples of two Coats regularly quartered onto one Shield. The practice of ladies, even queens, impaling their family Arms with those of their husbands was yet to evolve, so the Arms above can only be held as attributed. Eleanor's Seal portrays the Arms of England on one side and the Charges (Castles and Lions) from her father's Arms as individual figures in the background on the other side.\n\n​\n\nAlphonso, Earl of Chester\n\nAlphonso or Alfonso (24th November 1273 – 19th August 1284) was styled Earl of Chester. The ninth child of Edward and Eleanor, he was heir apparent to the English throne after his two elder brothers had died but never became king. Alphonso may seem a strange name for an English prince, but it was his half-uncle’s name and royalty in England, descended from the Normans, chose names for their children from Romance languages rather than Anglo Saxon names. Eleanor even persuaded her half-brother to travel to Gascony to serve as godfather at the young prince's baptism.\n\nAt the age of ten, Alphonso was engaged to Margaret, daughter of Floris V, Count of Holland but he fell ill and died a few months before the wedding was to take place. After the deaths of John, Henry and now Alphonso, Edward and Eleanor were left with the four-month-old Edward as their only son, although five daughters survived into adulthood\n\nAlphonso's and Margaret's Coats of Arms from his eponymous psalter. Author unknown. Photo source: Wikipedia/Acoma.\n\nAn opulent psalter was being prepared for Alphonso and Maragaret's marriage when he fell ill and died. The Alphonso Psalter was completed a decade later when his sister Elizabeth married Margaret's brother, John I, Count of Holland, making the pairing of arms somewhat appropriate.\n\nAlphonso's Arms are shown as England with a five-pointed Label in blue. This would usually be reserved for the grandchild of the Armigerer as we would know heraldry nowadays. However, Alphonso's grandfather had already died a year before he was born, let alone when Alphonso was 10. We can therefore only conclude that the number of Points to a Label did not have the significance then that it does now.\n\n​\n\nMargaret of France\n\n​Margaret of France (c. 1279 – 14th February 1318) was the fourth and last child of King Philip III of France, and the second child by his second wife Marie of Brabant. Her father died when she was three years old and she grew up under the supervision of her mother and her sister-in-law, Joan of Navarre, the wife of her half-brother, King Philip IV.\n\nAlthough Edward was filled with grief upon the death of Eleanor, he found it politically expedient to arrange another marriage, not only for himself but for his young son, Edward of Caernarfon, Prince of Wales. He may also have been eager for more children, especially a ‘spare’ to young Edward. Negotiations got under way including Margaret and her sister Blanche and Philip IV’s daughter Isabella. Also included, in the dowry, was Gascony which Philip had recently taken over and which Edward I was eager to regain. However, Edward found out that Blanche was to be betrothed to Rudolph of Germany and so declared war on Philip. After five years, a truce was agreed upon under the influence of Pope Boniface VIII and a series of treaties in the first half of 1299 provided terms for a double marriage: King Edward with Margaret and the Prince Edward with Isabella. Even though the King was 40 years older than Margaret, they found domestic bliss.\n\nAlthough never crowned due to financial restraints, Margaret acted fully as queen and was especially adept at calming the King’s temper and acting as a diplomat and mediator, especially between the King and his eldest surviving son, and the young Edward’s friends.\n\nMargaret had three children by Edward: Thomas (named after Thomas Beckett to whom she had prayed during pregnancy), Edmund (named after Edward’s brother) and Eleanor (named after Edward’s first wife). Unfortunately, the little Eleanor did not survive young childhood.\n\nIn 1307, Marguerite accompanied Edward on campaign to Scotland, but Edward died on July 7 at Burgh by Sands. Marguerite was overcome with grief and, while only in her late twenties, never married again, allegedly stating: “…when Edward died, all men died for me”. She retired her body was dressed in a Franciscan habit and taken for burial at Christ Church Greyfriars in London, the foundation of which she had generously endowed.\n\nSilver casket which Margaret had made as a wedding present fdor her stepson, Edward II, on his marriage to her half-niece Isabella. Photo source: https://www.britishmuseum.org/\n\nMargaret's Arms are known to have been England dimidiating France ancien, i.e. only half or just over a half of each of the two Coats of Arms is seen when they are brought together. This method of marshalling soon died out in favour of impalement which shows both Coats of Arms in full.\n\nIn the instance of the casket, the illustration actually shows the bride's Arms as Princess of Wales with a common Label across the whole of the Shield. The opposite side (not shown) shows Margaret's dimidiated Arms which at that stage were essentially the same as her step-daughter-in-law/half-niece but without the Label. When Edward II became King and Isabelle Queen, they were essentially the same! Isabella probably changed to marshalling to tell the difference from her mother-in-law and that may be where the changeover from dimidiating came from.\n\ncan go one better, though, with St Katharine's by the Tower or the Royal Hospital and Collegiate Church of St. Katharine by the Tower, a medieval church and hospital next to the Tower of London. It survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537 by virtue of royal protection, having been from its foundation to the present day under the patronage of the Queens (Regnant, Consort or Dowager) of England. The site was requisitioned in 1825 for the St Katherine's Docks, but fixtures and fittings were moved from the Thames-side site to the new Chapel near regent's Park. These include the Arms of all Queens (whether Regnant or Consort) from Matilda up until Queen Mary, the Queen Consort of King George V). Their Shields are 'supported' by an angel and are arranged in a frieze around the Chapel. HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, however, has her Arms in a stained glass window in an Ante-chapel, dated 2 years after her death, and the present Queen is not represented yet. The only exception otherwise appears to be Eleanor of Aquitaine, the first wife of Edward I. As can be seen, Margaret's Arms are again shown dimidiated, but so are Isabella's...\n\nArms of Margaret of France, second Queen Consort of King Edward I.

As was the custom at the time, Margaret prayed to Thomas Becket and thus Thomas named after the Saint.\n\nIn 1312 Thomas was created Earl of Norfolk by his half-brother Edward II and on 10th February 1316 he was created Earl Marshal. The previous Earl of Norfolk and Earl Marshal (with a couple of Earls Marshal in between) had been childless. So as to disinherit his brother, he had surrendered his title and had it re-created to him with succession limited to his own decendants. Thus the titles became vacant on his death. (It is suggested that Margaret had expected the Earldom of Cornwall but her stepson gave that title to his favourite, Piers Gaveston.\n\nArms of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nHe was known for his hot and violent temper, which he inherited from his father, and allied himself with Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer when they invaded England in 1326, and stood as one of the judges in the trials against his half-brother’s new favourites, the Despensers. Thomas became a chief advisor to his nephew King Edward III.\n\nThomas died on 4th August 1338, and was buried in the choir of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds. As he had no surviving sons, Thomas was succeeded by his daughter, Margaret, as Countess of Norfolk. She was later created Duchess of Norfolk for life in 1397.\n\nInstead of blue, Thomas chose the colour white for the Label on his Arms. This is the first known use of a white Label but at that stage the colour was of no other significance than that of distinction. The next use was by the Black Prince at a stage when heraldry was becoming more regulated and only then became the regular Label for the heir apparent.\n\n​\n\nEdmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent\n\n​Edmund (5th August 1301 – 19th March 1330) was the sixth and youngest son of King Edward I and the second by his second wife Margaret of France. Edward I had intended to make substantial grants of land to Edmund, but when the old King died in 1307, Edward II refused to respect his father's intentions, mainly due to his own favouritism towards Piers Gaveston. Edmund remained loyal to his brother, though, and in 1321 he was created Earl of Kent. He played an important part in Edward's administration and helped suppress a rebellion.\n\nDiscontent against the King grew and eventually affected Edmund. The discontent was largely caused by Edward's preference for his new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund also joined the rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby King Edward II was deposed. Edmund did not enjoy a great reputation during his life, and afterwards, due to his unreliable political dealings. He failed to get along with the new administration, however, and in 1330 he was caught planning a new rebellion and executed.\n\nArms of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nOnce the new king, Edward III, came of age and assumed personal control of the government, he annulled the charges against his uncle. The title and estates of the Earl of Kent descended on Edmund's son, also called Edmund. When this Edmund died in 1331, his brother John became Earl.\n\nThe younger Edmund was succeeded by his brother John and he, in turn, was succeeded by his elder sister Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent, who went on to marry the Black Prince. The Kents placed a white Bordure around the Arms of England for difference and this Shield was inherited down the Kent line, even used by Joan."
