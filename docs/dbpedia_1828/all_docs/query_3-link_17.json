        "text": "January 1, 1862\n\nA new year offers fresh opportunities and perspectives for the leaders and peoples of the United States and Confederate States of America. For Abraham Lincoln, this beginning is fraught with concern. George McClellan remains ill, but is improving and the president wants other chief commanders to handle matters in his absence.\n\nFor Jefferson Davis, the possibilities appear less harrowing on the surface. The new nation has survived into an early infancy that may yet hold the promise of longevity, but criticism grows concerning his leadership and the lack of follow-up to the victory at Manassas.\n\nDiarist Mary Chesnut offers a poetic tribute to her fellow Southerners:\n\n“A happy new year to the distant brave\n\nWho combat the foemen or battle the wave;\n\nFor each in his home there is a heart that still burns;\n\nGod send them say I—many happy returns.”\n\nNever one to be unduly hampered by conditions, Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson begins a campaign from Winchester, Va., that targets the important Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and other infrastructure elements.\n\nJanuary 2, 1862\n\nDiarist George Templeton Strong reflects Northern concerns in his journal:“It is a pleasant day, but in these times one cannot get rid of the presence of national peril. Even when one gives up a whole day to mere amusement, he is haunted by a phantom of possible calamity and disgrace.”\n\nConfederate war clerk and diarist, John Beauchamp Jones, confides his concerns for the new year in his journal:“The enemy are making preparations to assail us everywhere.” Following a long list of likely targets he sees as threatened along the Atlantic seaboard, the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River, as well as noting the presence of “monster armies” concentrating to invade “Tennessee and the Cotton States,” Jones observes rhetorically: “Will Virginia escape the scourge? Not she; here is the bull’s-eye of the mark they aim at.”\n\nJanuary 3, 1862\n\nBragg’s army begins to pull back from Murfreesboro, ceding the battlefield and ostensibly the victory to Rosecrans in Tennessee.\n\nIn an act of clemency, President Lincoln responds to a case that has come to his attention with the note: “Let this woman have her boy out of Old Capitol Prison.”\n\nJanuary 4, 1862\n\nJackson’s men enter Bath, Va.\n\nPresident Lincoln is still anxious to offer relief at the earliest juncture to the Unionists of East Tennessee. To Don Carlos Buell in Louisville, Ky., he inquires about the shipment of arms into the region:“Please tell me the progress and condition of the movement, in that direction. Answer.”\n\nJanuary 5, 1862\n\nStonewall Jackson remains on the prowl near the Potomac River, looking to add to the consternation of his, and his nation’s, foes.\n\nIn Centreville, Va., Thomas J. Goree offers a scathing assessment of Jefferson Davis as commander in chief. He observes: \"But we are more than all crippled by an unfortunate misunderstanding which unhappily exists between Pres. Davis and the leading generals of this army. . . . Mr. Davis’ motto seems to be: ‘Rule or Ruin.’ Mr. Davis is undoubtedly a great man, but he has his faults, his whims, and his unbounded prejudices. I have nearly lost all the admiration I ever had for him as an honest man and a patriot.”\n\nJanuary 6, 1862\n\nGeneral Buell’s hesitation to assume an operation aimed at East Tennessee, in preference to one that pushes instead for Nashville, prompts a strong response from the president that emphasizes his disappointment. In addition to his desire to inflict damage on a major transportation artery of the Confederacy—the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad—he notes:“But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even now I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South.”\n\nOne Union officer’s letter to his wife from Kentucky illustrates the precarious state of the health of his troops and the emotional toll exacted from him:“There is a great deal of sickness in this camp and especially in our regt. principally measles. One of my men . . . died with them a few days ago. It was very sad for me, I assure you, as the commander of a company is, or ought to be, something of a father to his men.”\n\nJanuary 7, 1862\n\nThe new Department of North Carolina comes into being, with command going to Union brigadier general Ambrose E. Burnside.\n\nJanuary 8, 1862\n\nUnion cavalry strike a camp at Roan’s Tan Yard, containing Missouri State Guards, that have been recruiting for the Confederacy, capturing a handful of the Southerners and disrupting their activities.\n\nJanuary 11, 1862\n\nMary Chesnut records an ominous incident in her diary regarding the institution of slavery and the encroachment of Union forces on Southern territory and interests concerning the deaths of two men:“These dead men had been bringing negroes from the coast—negroes who did not want to come. They laid down their guns and went to sleep. The negroes took their guns, shot the owners of them, and went back to the [Union] fleet.”\n\nAnother Northern flotilla carrying troops under General Burnside departs from Virginia waters heading for the North Carolina coast.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln accepts the resignation of Simon Cameron from his Cabinet.\n\nJanuary 12, 1862\n\nMary Chesnut records a sermon based on the Old Testament victory of Gideon at Manassas and draws the appropriate modern application:“Nothing will ever equal that ‘first sprightly running’ of our foes—at our Manassas.”\n\nJanuary 13, 1862\n\nAbraham Lincoln has been contemplating the manner in which he can prompt more aggressive action from his field commanders. From the Executive Mansion in Washington, he sends a communication to General Buell in Kentucky that indicates the strategy he wishes to pursue, although is careful to remind the officer that these are suggestions and not orders. Nevertheless, the ideas suggest an understanding of martial matters for which the president is not often credited at this point in the conflict:“I state my general idea of this war to be that we have the greater numbers, and the enemy has the greater facility of concentrating forces upon points of collision; that we must fail, unless we can find some way of making our advantage an over-match for his; and that this can only be done by menacing him with superior forces at different points, at the same time; so that we can safely attack, one, or both, if he makes no change; and if he weakens one to strengthen the other, forbear to attack the strengthened one, but seize, and hold the weakened one, gaining so much.”\n\nFrom the consulate in Bermuda, Charles Allen tells his wife that he has had to remove a “Secession Flag” surreptitiously placed on the flagstaff of his facility, but assures her that he had “captured it before anyone saw it.”\n\nJanuary 15, 1862\n\nConfirmation by the U.S. Senate for new Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton occurs.\n\nJanuary 17, 1862\n\nA Union officer writes hurriedly that his command has been called to action:“We were quite surprised this morning to learn that we were under orders to go to Romney, Va at once. . . . Our Regiment is in no condition to move. It has had little or no instruction. For a week I have been instructing the Regt. battalion exercises. I learned my lessons that night before each day’s exercise & then manly go out and put the men through in gallant style. The boys think I am quite a military man but I know better.”\n\nJanuary 18, 1862\n\nFormer president and erstwhile peacemaker, John Tyler, dies in Virginia. At the time of his death he is set to become a member of the Confederate House of Representatives.\n\nTrying to anticipate conditions as the war proceeds, one Confederate staff officer advises the folks at home:“It will soon be time for planting, and what I could suggest is that you reduce your cotton crop, and plant more grain than usual. . . . If this course is generally pursued throughout the South, the small quantity of cotton raised on account of the increase in price would bring almost as much money as a large crop at a reduced price. If the blockade is not raised soon, there will in all probability be on hand next fall two crops, and the more raised this year the less will be the price when it does come to market.”\n\nJanuary 19, 1862\n\nUnion troops under the Virginian George Henry Thomas clash with Confederates under the immediate command of Felix Zollicoffer at Mill Springs or Logan’s Cross Roads. The engagement begins in rain and fog and continues through the morning hours, with critical moments highlighted by a bayonet charge and by the death of the Southern commander when Zollicoffer rode mistakenly into Union lines, wearing a raincoat that covered his uniform. The Confederate loss is set at 125 killed, 309 wounded, and 99 missing, while Union casualties consist of 39 killed, 207 wounded and 15 missing. The Northern victory has severely compromised the Southern defensive line in Kentucky and demoralized Confederate hopes in this portion of the Western Theater.\n\nJanuary 20, 1862\n\nThe defeated troops huddling along the Cumberland River receive a reprieve when the steamboat Noble Ellis transfers them across the swollen waters to safety through the night. But, the vessel is not as fortunate, suffering an ignoble ending once the process is complete in order to prevent it from being used by the Federals in any pursuit. The overall Confederate commander, George B. Crittenden, suffers the brunt of criticism for the setback.\n\nJanuary 22, 1862\n\nPresident Davis spends a portion of his day vetoing bills forwarded to him by the Confederate Congress. His objections rest largely on what he deems as infringements upon Executive prerogatives.\n\nJanuary 25, 1862\n\nBurnside is having his difficulties in the coastal waters of North Carolina, but the Confederate defenders in the region are beset by problems of their own.\n\nJanuary 26, 1862\n\nBeauregard leaves the Eastern Theater for the West to serve as second-in-command to Albert Sidney Johnston.\n\nJanuary 27, 1862\n\nA frustrated President Lincoln finally decides that his gentle prodding for a forward movement has proven unsuccessful and turns to the method of providing a firm date of February 22, 1862, for a general advance against the Confederates.\n\nJanuary 29, 1862\n\nFrom his War Office desk in Richmond, John B. Jones has followed military events as they have unfolded and concludes:“What we want is a military man capable of directing operations in the field everywhere. I think [Robert E.] Lee is such man.”\n\nGeorge Templeton Strong is not overly enamored with Abraham Lincoln’s homespun-style, but sees beneath it a wisdom that is at once compelling and effective:“He told us a lot of stories. Something was said about the pressure of the extreme anti-slavery party in Congress, and in the newspapers for legislation about the status of all slaves. ‘Wa-al,” says Abe Lincoln, ‘that reminds me of a party of Methodist parsons that was traveling in Illinois when I was a boy thar, and had a branch to cross that was pretty bad—ugly to cross, ye know, because the waters was up. And they got considerin’ and discussin’ how they should git across it, and they talked about it for two hours, and one on ‘em thought they had ought to cross one way when they got there, and another another way, and they got to quarrellin’ about it, till at last an old brother put in, and he says, says he, ‘Brethern, this here talk ain’t no use. I never cross a river until I come to it”\n\nJanuary 30, 1862\n\nA strange new ironclad vessel launches its career as the U.S.S. Monitor goes forth amid fanfare from onlookers.\n\nMason and Slidell, the embattled Confederate diplomats, finally reach England, where it remains to be seen if they will be able to accomplish as much on their duty stations as they had almost done in simply attempting to reach them.\n\nSecretary of War Judah Benjamin orders Southern troops out of Romney, Va.\n\nJanuary 31, 1862\n\nStonewall Jackson reacts to the intervention of the War Department amidst the constant carping of subordinate William Wing Loring in the difficult winter campaigning in western Virginia. Jackson is prepared to resign if necessary, arguing that “with such interference in my command I cannot expect to be of much service in the field.”\n\nA critical international factor plays out when Queen Victoria asserts that her realm will remain neutral regarding the American conflict.\n\nFebruary 1, 1862\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln sends a letter of condolences on the part of the United States to Queen Victoria of Great Britain on the death of her consort, Prince Albert. He reiterates the connections between the countries and dismisses any “accidents” that might have come between the two nations: “The People of the United States are kindred of the People of Great Britain. With all our distinct national interests, objects, and aspirations, we are conscious that our moral strength is largely derived from that relationship, and we do not deceive ourselves when we suppose that, by constantly cherishing cordial friendship and sympathy with the other branches of the family to which we belong, we impart to them not less strength than we derive from the same connection.”\n\nFebruary 3, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln has a busy day corresponding with the King of Siam over an offer for elephants, while closer to home he grapples with George McClellan about the most appropriate strategy for waging war in Virginia. Lincoln is prone to be more direct, while McClellan prefers an elaborate operation that would call for the transfer of most of his troops to the coast for a monumental campaign against the Confederate capital from that direction.\n\nFebruary 4, 1862\n\nUnion forces are beginning to close on Fort Henry, Tenn. Poorly-located in a low-lying area along the Tennessee River prone to flooding, Henry has been expected to be the Confederate answer to that river’s defense. While Kentucky had remained neutral the site was not an issue, but as Union vessels and Ulysses S. Grant’s land forces bear down on it the circumstances are set to alter dramatically.\n\nFebruary 5, 1862\n\nBetter situated on higher ground than its neighbor, Fort Heiman, is not yet complete when the Confederates abandon it and Union troops under Charles F. Smith occupy the site preparatory to moving against Fort Henry itself.\n\nFebruary 6, 1862\n\nFort Henry falls to a concerted effort by a U.S. gunboat flotilla. Recognizing the futility of a long-term defense, the Confederate commander, Brigadier General Lloyd Tilghman depletes the garrison of most of its men, with the exception of enough to serve the fort’s heavy guns and those too sick to leave a hospital boat. As they approach, the Federals lay down a heavy fire that knocks out thirteen of the seventeen Southern artillery pieces. The worst Union casualties occur when a hit on the boiler of the Essex sends scalding steam into crew members, including Commodore William D. Porter, but the outcome of the battle is not in doubt. Tilghman lowers the flag and surrenders Fort Henry and its remnant of defenders. Total casualties for the day’s work amount to 47 Federals and approximately 100 Confederates, of whom most are prisoners.\n\nFebruary 7, 1862\n\nThe defense of the general location of what in colonial times had been called the “Lost Colony,” is about to be tested by a powerful Union fleet. U.S. Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough and Brigadier General Ambrose Burnside are set to apply that test. In the preliminaries, Goldsborough’s fleet spars with a Confederate “mosquito fleet” under William F. Lynch and provides cover as Burnside lands 4,000 men nearby. By the end of the day, this force swells to 10,000.\n\nFebruary 8, 1862\n\nApproximately 1,500 of the 3,000 available Confederate defenders prepare to fend off a Union advance on Roanoke Island, but only after the attacking force has traversed half of the ground it has had to cover without meeting resistance. A Union double envelopment shatters the Southern line in the fighting that follows and the Confederates scurry off only to reach the island’s edge with no transport to safety. Colonel Henry M. Shaw, the commander of the troops surrenders to the victorious Union forces, having lost 23 men killed and 62 wounded. The Federals report 37 of their own number killed, with another 214 wounded and 13 missing. Roanoke Island reveals critical defects in the Confederate war effort that range from inadequate training and supply to poor leadership and support.\n\nFebruary 9, 1862\n\nRecriminations over Roanoke Island such as those leveled by Brigadier General Henry A. Wise at his superior Major General Benjamin Huger cannot recompense for the defeat, nor assuage the personal loss Wise feels for his son, O. Jennings Wise, who dies from a wound received in the ill-starred defensive effort.\n\nFebruary 13, 1862\n\nUlysses Grant positions himself to attack Fort Donelson, which sits on the west bank of the Cumberland River. Temperatures plummet during the night, adding to the misery of the men on both sides especially those who have previously discarded heavier clothing in an unseasonably warm period.\n\nFebruary 14, 1862\n\nGunboats under Flag Officer Andrew Foote attempt to deliver St. Valentine’s greetings against the defenders of Fort Donelson in hopes of repeating the earlier success at Fort Henry. The Confederates, who have the advantage of well-placed water batteries and pre-set range markers on the river bank, rebuff the overtures firmly. In the course of the fighting, Southern shelling pummels the Union vessels, tearing the pilothouse from the St. Louis and wounding Foote. Damage to the steering mechanisms of the St. Louis and the Louisville leave those gunboats drifting with the current. Altogether, eleven men have died and forty-three suffered wounds in the short, but brisk and unsuccessful encounter by the flotilla with the fort.\n\nFebruary 15, 1862\n\nUlysses Grant leaves his headquarters to meet with Flag Officer Foote concerning the next steps to be taken against Donelson. However, the Confederates dictate matters when they attempt a breakout by striking the Union right in a surprise offensive. The Southerners roll a portion of the Union lines back, but reinforcements stabilize the situation for the North. Faced with the decision to proceed with the assault, or accepting the opportunity to move as many men out of the fort as possible, Gideon Pillow vacillates and opts to return to the fort instead. An assault by Charles Smith as he gains a foothold in the works on the Confederate right further complicating matters for the Confederate leadership. Floyd, Pillow and Simon Buckner will meet during the night to decide the fate of the garrison, passing authority to each other before determining to surrender. Subsequently, the two Confederate commanders leave Buckner to conduct the surrender proceedings. Confederate colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest receives permission to leave and extricates his command from the fort before the opportunity vanishes once overtures for terms have been made.\n\nFrom Virginia, Thomas J. Goree writes a family member:“Since the battle of Manassas an apathy seems to have rested upon our people. We . . . have considered one Southerner as a match for five Yankees. We have thought that the Yankees would always take to their heels after a few rounds.” Citing the string of defeats that have recently beset the South, Goree observes: “But while these reverses have proved to us that our foes are not such cowards as we have heretofore taken them for, it has also disclosed the very disagreeable fact that our forces are not the invincible heroes which we thought them to be.”\n\nPresident Davis spends part of his day trying to offer reassurances to leading North Carolinians in light of the adverse military developments in their state, while struggling over conflicting state and national imperatives. “The defense of North Carolina occupies my anxious attention. I am sending there all the aid I can procure.” Although this aid will not include North Carolina troops assigned elsewhere. “To be successful, the common means must be employed for the common defense, as its necessities require.”\n\nFebruary 16, 1862\n\nFort Donelson surrenders with some 15,000 Confederates and 48 field pieces, in addition to the heavy ordnance of the fort’s batteries. Buckner had hoped for better terms from the old friend to whom he had once lent money, but “Unconditional Surrender” Grant is set to enter the lexicon of the American Civil War after exacting the capitulation of the fort on the basis of those conditions.\n\nDiarist Mary Chesnut fears the worst from the early reports:“Awful newspapers today. Fort Donelson a drawn battle. You know that means [coming] in our mouths that we have lost it.”\n\nFebruary 17, 1862\n\nGeorge Templeton Strong uses the occasion of Fort Donelson’s surrender to indicate his disdain for John B. Floyd. Strong suggests that if Floyd is indeed among the captives, he ought to be turned over to P.T. Barnum and “most profitably exhibited” in his circus.\n\nFebruary 18, 1862\n\nThe First Congress of the Confederate States of America takes it seat, replacing the Provisional Congress that has been in place since the formation of the new nation.\n\nThomas Goree girds himself for continuing in the face of the news of the fall of Fort Donelson:“Affairs look very gloomy indeed in that quarter, but we must trust in Providence, Who, I cannot but believe, is on our side. We must not for one moment despond of our ultimate success, but must arouse ourselves to renewed exertions, determined to conquer or die.”\n\nFebruary 20, 1862\n\nPersonal tragedy strikes in Washington, D.C. when twelve-year old William Wallace “Willie” Lincoln succumbs to typhoid. Happier news from the war front cannot off-set the despair that pervades the White House.\n\nFrom his post at Bermuda, U.S. Consul Charles Allen reports the arrival of the “Rebel Steamer Nashville,” purported to be short of fuel. “I shall do all I can to prevent her getting coal,” he adds in his communication with his superiors in Washington.\n\nIn the Trans-Mississippi, Confederate brigadier general Henry Sibley has moved his 2,500-man Army of New Mexico to the vicinity of Union-held Fort Craig. He positions his force on the Federal supply route, hoping to bring Colonel Edward R.S. Canby out into the open. Confederate artillery provides the first shots of the Battle of Valverde.\n\nFebruary 21, 1862\n\nThe Battle of Valverde continues as Sibley and Canby thrust and react to each other. The Federals enjoy initial success and incapacitate Sibley himself. But the Confederates, now under Colonel Thomas Green, drive against the Union line, capturing six pieces of artillery and breaking it. Union forces retreat into Fort Craig, having suffered 263 total casualties to 186 by the Confederates.\n\nIn New York City, the commander of a slave ship, Captain Nathaniel P. Gordon, arrested while engaged in the illegal importation of slaves into the U.S. meets his fate on the gallows after a brief stay by President Lincoln. Diarist George Templeton Strong observes coldly, “Vere dignum et justum est, dignum et salutare. Served him right.”\n\nFebruary 22, 1862\n\nIn an inauguration as the President of the Confederate States of America in its “permanent” form that is steeped in history and evokes the memory of George Washington, Jefferson Davis offers a brief address to a rain-drenched crowd assembled on the Capitol square in Richmond:“On this birthday of the man most identified with the establishment of American independence, and beneath the monument erected to commemorate his heroic virtues, and those of his compatriots, we have assembled to usher into existence the Permanent Government of the Confederate States.”\n\nDavis notes the general conditions that prevail in the country, emphasizing the blockade of Southern ports and the military setbacks recently experienced, and draws lessons from the past to apply to the present:“The tyranny of an unbridled majority, the most odious and least responsible form of despotism, has denied us both the right and the remedy. Therefore we are in arms to renew such sacrifices as our fathers made to the holy cause of constitutional liberty.To show ourselves worthy of the inheritance bequeathed to us by the patriots of the Revolution, we must emulate that heroic devotion which made reverse to them but the crucible in which their patriotism was refined.”\n\nTo Confederate war clerk, John B. Jones, the weather portends gloom:“Such a day! The heavens weep incessantly. Capitol Square is black with umbrellas; and a shelter has been erected for the President to stand under.”\n\nFrom South Carolina, Mary Chesnut offers her expression of hopes for the new chief executive from the perspective of a sunnier climate:“What a beautiful [day] for our Confederate president to be inaugurated. God speed him. God help him. God save him.”\n\nFor Emerson Opdycke, a Union officer currently posted at Paducah, Kentucky, the month’s events have been simultaneously exciting and exasperating, as he explains to his wife, Lucy:“Trust we shall go into something active soon, for I am sick of doing nothing, while others are doing so much. Our arms are winning glorious triumphs, which are but the beginning of the End of the Rebellion.”\n\nIn Gladeville (Wise), Virginia, Kentuckian Edward Guerrant spends his first days as a soldier ruminating on the significance of the day:“Strange, mysterious tho’ts & scenes—for Washington’s birthday. His Country divided & warring; his State pressed by hostile feet & fattened with the blood of her noblest sons. Today the Government of the Confederate States—ceases to be “Provisional” & becomes Constitutional & I hope, stable & perpetual.”\n\nFebruary 24, 1862\n\nFrom his camp in Arkansas, Texan James C. Bates remarks about the news that has filtered into their ranks and his desire for redemption:“I hope the enemy will give us a fight. I want us to make amends for the defeats we have suffered in the East. If we win a victory it may cost us the lives of many men—but they cannot die in a nobler cause.”\n\nFebruary 25, 1862\n\nNashville becomes the first state capital in the Confederacy to fall to occupying Union forces.\n\nThe C.S.S. Nashville has better fortune than her namesake city. U.S. Consul Allen reports that the Confederate commerce raider has obtained 150 tons of coal to continue her voyage and left Bermudan waters.\n\nFebruary 27, 1862\n\nEmerson Opdycke informs Lucy that he has reached the Tennessee state capital:“I suppose you know all about our grand entrance into Nashville through swifter means of communication than the mail. When we came up there was not a flag out in the whole city, but soon the Stars and Stripes floated from their magnificent State House.”\n\nMarch 1, 1862\n\nThomas Goree, with General James Longstreet in Virginia, remains confident in the command with which he is associated and perturbed at the disasters that have befallen Confederate commands elsewhere and says so in letter to home:“I have almost come to the conclusion that the fate of the Country depends on our success. . . . You will never, I hope, hear of any such disgraceful conduct in this army, as has characterized our arms at Hatteras, Port Royal, Somerset, Roanoke, Henry and Donelson.”\n\nThe fall of Fort Donelson particularly bothers the Confederate staffer:“We once boasted that one Southerner could whip three Yankees in a fair fight, but the result of that fight does not prove it. If the place was untenable, why could not the whole force have made their escape as well as those that did get away with [Gideon] Pillow & [John B.] Floyd? I expect the truth of the matter is that Pillow and Floyd ran off and left [Simon] Buckner.”\n\nGoree’s final condemnation is not against Buckner, whom he deems to be “a brave man, and a splendid officer, a better man than Pillow and Floyd put together.”\n\nMarch 3, 1862\n\nConfederate major general Earl Van Dorn pulls the forces of Major General Sterling Price and Brigadier General Ben McCulloch into a new Army of the West with designs for pushing into Missouri.\n\nIn Washington City, President Lincoln forwards his list of names for appointment at various levels as general officers, including Irvin McDowell and Franz Sigel, who had experienced setback at First Manassas and Wilson’s Creek, respectively. McDowell, Sigel, Ambrose E. Burnside, Don Carlos Buell, John Pope, Samuel R. Curtis, John A. McClernand, Charles F. Smith and Lew Wallace are to be made major generals of volunteers.\n\nMarch 4, 1862\n\nConfederates enter Santa Fe in the New Mexico Territory as Henry Sibley continues his campaign in the region.\n\nFrom the South Carolina coast, W.P. DuBose reflects on his life and the war:“It seems to me a very short time since my 21st Birthday, & now my 26th is at hand. Who can tell what the next five years will bring forth? I often indulge in pictures of the future, & am sometimes surprised at myself for allowing this fearful war with all its uncertainties to interfere so little with my anticipations.”\n\nThe soldier speculates that the time has arrived for everyone to view the circumstances more soberly:“With our disparity of numbers & resources, the sooner we assume a sterner, more determined & more devoted attitude the better for our cause.”\n\nMarch 5, 1862\n\nNathaniel Banks moves out from Harpers Ferry, targeting the town of Winchester in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley.\n\nMarch 6, 1862\n\nAnxious to display credentials meant to set some minds at ease concerning his views on slavery, President Lincoln sends a proposed joint resolution regarding gradual compensated emancipation for Congressional consideration:“Resolved that the United States ought to co-operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in it’s discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences public and private, produced by such a change of system.”\n\nAs part of the message, Lincoln insists that the “measure [is meant] as one of the most efficient means of self-preservation” and that by giving some, if not all, of the slaveholding states remaining in the Union the opportunity to demonstrate a desire to engage in the “initiation of emancipation” the rebellious states would know that no other states were going to join them “in their proposed confederacy.” The President believes this course of action to be the most reasonable of choices, “because, in my judgment, gradual, and not sudden emancipation, is better for all.”\n\nTroops under Earl Van Dorn engage a rear-guard of Union forces commanded by Franz Sigel in Arkansas as a prelude to a fight at Pea Ridge.\n\nMarch 7, 1862\n\nVan Dorn maneuvers with Sterling Price on a long night march designed to strike the flank of Major General Samuel R. Curtis in the vicinity of a hotel that displays a rack of elk horns as a distinctive adornment feature. In the meantime, he hopes to hold Curtis’s attentions with a feint by subordinate generals Ben McCulloch and Albert Pike. Following the difficult trek, Price is not in position to attack until 10:30 A.M., three hours after the time Van Dorn had intended and after Curtis had detected the Confederate march and reacted to it. Several attacks against grudging opposition give the Southerners ground, but expend the energy of the offensive.\n\nIn the meantime, the other effort enjoys initial success as Pike’s Cherokees capture a Union battery, but a counterattack nullifies any advantage. McCulloch’s Texas and Arkansas troops press forward, but sustain heavy casualties, including their commander, as he tries to lead them forward. James McIntosh steps forward to assume command only to be struck down and the attacks lose their momentum as the demoralized Confederates reassess.\n\nFrom her time administering to the sick, Judith Brockenbrough McGuire recounts a conversation that related to Divine support for the Southern cause: \"'Yes,' he replied, 'but the Philistines didn't pray, and the Yankees do; and though I can't bear the Yankees, I believe some of them are Christians, and pray as hard as we do; and if we pray for one thing, and they pray for another, I don't know what to think of our prayers clashing.'\"\n\nMarch 8, 1862\n\nWith everything running in short supply and his leadership decimated, Van Dorn clings to ground around Elkhorn Tavern. Curtis turns to strike the V-shaped Confederate line. The Southern right flank gives way. Demonstrating an uncharacteristic exuberance for a normally-stoic personality, the Union commander watches as his opponents flee the field, dashing Van Dorn’s hopes of moving into Missouri and securing St. Louis. The battle has cost 1,340 Union and 800 Confederate casualties.\n\nIn Hampton Roads, the Confederate ironclad Virginia (formerly the U.S.S. Merrimack) creates havoc among elements of the Union fleet guarding the entrance to Chespeake Bay, threatening the viability of wooden warships against the new type of naval vessel. The Virginia encounters and rams the twenty-four gun sloop Cumberland and then turns on the fifty-gun frigate Congress. Confederate flag officer Franklin Buchanan becomes enraged when his vessel takes fire from the shore while the Congress, having run aground, displays a white flag. Buchanan returns the fire personally, only to become wounded himself, then orders his cannoneers to pour heated shot into the Congress in retaliation. Catesby Ap Roger Jones replaces the stricken skipper and the Virginia turns on the grounded Minnesota. The lateness of the day and the strain of battle on a vessel and crew that is also impacted by the fighting convinces Jones to finish the work tomorrow.\n\nFrom Martinsburg, Va., Union officer Alvin Coe Voris assesses the broader effects of the war thus on Virginia:“The statesmen of Va have not manifest their usual sagacity in taking part with secession. They have voluntarily brought upon the State a terrible financial, social and political scourge. A person who has not seen the effects of the war cannot appreciate the extent of the injury. At every place where a camp has been made for any length of time the hand of destruction has fallen, leaving nothing but buildings & the native soil. . . . This is true whether the occupying army is friendly or hostile. . . . It is fortunate for Ohio that the stroke of war has only fallen on her sons in the field and far outside her borders.”\n\nMarch 9, 1862\n\nBeginning at approximately 8:45 A.M., a revolution in naval warfare occurs when the Virginia and the Monitor duel in Hampton Roads. As Virginia steams back out to confront the Union fleet the crew spots an unusual craft lying low in the water adjacent to Minnesota. The more nimble Monitor, featuring two eleven-inch Dahlgren guns in a revolving turret, will give as good as she gets on this day, despite the label of being little more than a “cheesebox on a raft.” For her part, the Virginia has endured hits from the previous day and struggles with leaks and faulty machinery. Trading shots as the antagonists circle each other, the Confederate vessel becomes vulnerable when she runs aground, but despite a pummeling Jones succeeds in freeing her before critical damage can be done. Late in the morning, the Monitor’s commander, John Worden, suffers an incapacitating wound when a shell burst hits the pilothouse in which he is directing the fight and blinds him temporarily. The confrontation ends in a stand-off or draw, but history has been made on the waters of America.\n\nMary Chesnut exudes about the news of the previous day: \"The Merrimack business came like a gleam of lightning, illuminating a dark scene.”\n\nReceiving some criticism from newspaper editorials for his proposed joint resolution on gradual compensated emancipation, President Lincoln responds:“Have you noticed the facts that less than one half-day’s cost of this war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware, at four hundred dollars per head?—that eighty-seven days cost of this war would pay for all in Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Kentucky, and Missouri at the same price?” As such, Lincoln suggests that “another article” might be in order.\n\nMarch 10, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln passes along concerns he has heard related to the U.S.S. Monitor to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. One naval officer has ventured that a boarding party might render the vessel’s turret inoperable by “wedging” it so it cannot turn. Lincoln is careful not to use his own words, but suggests, “He is decidedly of [the] opinion she should not go sky-larking up to Norfolk.”\n\nMarch 11, 1862\n\nBy virtue of the President’s War Order No. 3 and his own decision to lead the Army of the Potomac personally as it positions itself for a campaign against Richmond, George B. McClellan is relieved as commander of all other Union military departments.\n\nMarch 13, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln expresses his intention that while McClellan maneuvers his army for a strike at the Confederate capital, Washington itself is not to be left exposed.\n\nIn Virginia, Alvin C. Voris notes his good fortune: “We are luxuriating on secesh chicken now. I got one for 2/c yesterday. It was a chicken indeed, an old he hen of almost a centuries growth, & after boiling it long enough to tan sole leather it made a chicken soup for five persons for supper and breakfast.”\n\nMarch 14, 1862\n\nUnion general John Pope establishes himself as an aggressive and successful commander with operations against the defenses of New Madrid, Missouri.\n\nUnion activity continues to plague Confederates on the coast of North Carolina as troops occupy New Berne. Most of the 609 Southern casualties are prisoners of war.\n\nStill working to sell his idea for gradual compensated emancipation, Abraham Lincoln offers statistics for each slaveholding state remaining in the Union and posits:“Suppose, for instance, a State devises and adopts a system by which the institution absolutely ceases therein by a named date—say January 1st, 1882. Then, let the sum to be paid to such state by the United States, be ascertained by taking from the Census of 1860, the number of slaves within the state, and multiplying that number by four hundred—the United States to pay such a sum to the state in twenty equal annual instalments [sic], in six per cent. bonds of the United States.”\n\nMarch 15, 1862\n\nAfter absorbing the news of the loss of New Berne, Mary Chesnut concludes dejectedly: “So many discomfitures. No wonder we are downhearted.”\n\nUnion troops under William T. Sherman and Stephen A. Hurlbut reach Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River, not far from the Mississippi borderline.\n\nMarch 17, 1862\n\nGeorge McClellan begins the movement of his army for its campaign against Richmond by way of the Virginia Peninsula.\n\nMarch 18, 1862\n\nFollowing a controversial tenure as secretary of war, Judah Benjamin replaces Robert M.T. Hunter, who has resigned his office in a fit of pique, as the new Confederate secretary of state. Benjamin is unfailingly loyal to President Davis and possesses a brilliant mind, but is also an easy target for critics and anti-Semites.\n\nMarch 21, 1862\n\nConfederate war clerk John Beauchamp Jones notes the degree to which black-marketing has flourished in Richmond, while offering not such a thinly-veiled criticism of the hypocritically-motivated efforts of those supposedly engaged in curtailing such activities:“Gen. [John H.] Winder’s detectives are very busy. They have been forging prescriptions to catch the poor Richmond apothecaries. When brandy is thus obtained it is confiscated, and the money withheld. They drink the brandy, and imprison the apothecaries.”\n\nMarch 22, 1862\n\nSouthern cavalry under Turner Ashby probe the area of Kernstown in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, but fail to detect the presence of the greater portion of 9,000 Federals located nearby under James Shields.\n\nMarch 23, 1862\n\nThomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson’s men approach what they believe to be only a small rear-guard of Union forces, but find themselves engaged in the First Battle of Kernstown with a powerful and well-posted foe. Despite reluctance to fight on the Sabbath, among the other factors that might have given another man pause, Jackson presses the attack. Nathan Kimball, the replacement for a wounded Shields, feeds additional Union troops into the combat. The numbers begin to tell, and this development, coupled with depletion in ammunition causes Confederate general Richard Garnett to order the Stonewall Brigade to retreat. The command as a whole then withdraws under duress. Jackson’s aggressiveness with a force inferior in size to Shields yields a loss of 80 killed, 375 wounded, and 263 missing for the Confederates and 118 killed, 450 wounded, and 22 missing for the Federals. The hard-fought engagement is the opening salvo of a campaign in the Shenandoah.\n\nFort Macon, near Beaufort, North Carolina, comes under attack by Union forces.\n\nMarch 24, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln communicates with newspaper editor Horace Greeley regarding the gradual emancipation proposal: “If I were to suggest anything it would be that as the North are already for the measure, we should urge it persuasively, and not menacingly, upon the South.”\n\nMarch 26, 1862\n\nIn the early morning hours, 418 Union troops under Major John M. Chivington clash with Confederates at Apache Canyon, New Mexico. Although he has driven the Southerners repeatedly, Chivington withdraws his men and 60-70 captives, having suffered 19 killed, 5 wounded, and 3 missing of his own. Confederate losses are less certain, but amount to at least 16 dead and 30-40 wounded.\n\nDiarist John B. Jones records that General John Winder’s sting operation against black-marketers in the Confederate capital has ended in acquittals handed down “by a court-martial.” The general’s response to subsequent orders for the release of the prisoners reflects his fiery nature: “Not approved, and you may congratulate yourselves upon escaping a merited punishment.”\n\nMarch 28, 1862\n\nAt Pigeon’s Ranch, in Glorieta Pass, the antagonists in the New Mexico Campaign spar with each other, while a small contingent of 400 men under John Chivington detach for a bold strike against the Southern supply wagons. The destruction of these critical resources compels the Confederates to withdraw. Casualties of 36 killed, 60 wounded, and 25 missing for the Southerners, as opposed to Federal losses of 31 killed, 50 wounded, and 30 missing, mark the human costs of the fighting.\n\nIn the North, George Templeton Strong is in no mood to celebrate the month’s successes:“There is an uneasy feeling about the conduct of the war. That fatal Merrimac is ready for sea again. With a little luck to help her, she may do infinite mischief. Is Congress or the Navy Department accountable for our want of preparation? Somebody ought to be hanged, because we have not six Merrimacs now in commission.”\n\nMarch 29, 1862\n\nKentucky Unionist Josie Underwood watches as Wisconsin troops pass her home, marveling at the sight:“I think I never saw such a fine looking body of men. All of our troops look splendidly—so well equipped and comfortably clothed but it seems to me the Wisconsin men are larger—more stalwart and healthy looking than any.”\n\nThe scene makes her momentarily feel compassionate toward the “Poor ‘Confeds! Though all wrong from my standpoint—there is something grand and heroic in the reckless daring that could ever induce them to put themselves against this strong government, with its inexhaustible supply of men and money—and they don’t seem for a minute to realize the self sacrifice they are making and are absolutely confident of winning out—even when they are hungry and cold.”\n\nApril 1, 1862\n\nIn Virginia, the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan commanding, continues its shift to the Peninsula for launching operations against Richmond from that direction.\n\nFederal troops are on the move in other places as well. From her home in Kentucky, Unionist Josie Underwood records:“No funny fooling today—it is raining. The streets are in horrible condition—yet on and on go more troops marching south, through slush and mud. The hospitals are full to overflowing.”\n\nApril 2, 1862\n\nUnion officer Alvin Coe Voris, writes home from Woodstock, Va., in a letter tinged with hopefulness:“You see that we are getting ‘away down in Dixie.’ Every move takes us further from home, but nearer a speedy return.”\n\nLegislation meant to provide the means for states to transition from slave-holding to free with compensation for the owners passes the U.S. Senate. President Lincoln has seen this process as the practical application of the notion of gradual compensated emancipation.\n\nApril 3, 1862\n\nAbraham Lincoln is feeling exposed in Washington as so much of the force once defending it is no longer in the vicinity of the nation’s capital. He holds Irvin McDowell’s troops in place and urges McClellan to “commence his forward movement from his new base at once.”\n\nApril 4, 1862\n\nDespite the sympathies she and her family hold with regard to the Union, Josie Underwood learns harsh lessons from the war raging around them:“We find that Union soldiers are not much more regardful for personal property than were the Rebels—only now Pa has some chance of getting his rights redressed and that too, without insult.”\n\nApril 5, 1862\n\nNew siege lines take shape in the area of Yorktown, Virginia, as McClellan’s massive army confronts an unknown number of Confederate defenders under Major General John Bankhead Magruder.\n\nPierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard is exhibiting severe second-thoughts about a surprise Confederate offensive against Union forces encamped along the Tennessee River north of Corinth. As another day passes with Southern forces beset by delay and chaotic movement a frustrated Albert Sidney Johnston proclaims:“This is perfectly puerile! This is not war!”\n\nLater in the day, when confronting the debate about what to do next raging between his subordinates, Johnston insists:“Gentlemen, we shall attack at daylight tomorrow.”...“I would fight them if they were a million.”....“I have ordered a battle for tomorrow at daylight, and I intend to ‘hammer ‘em’!”\n\nApril 6, 1862\n\nThe pastoral beauty of Spring becomes shattered in western Tennessee near Pittsburg Landing and a little log meeting house called Shiloh Church. Sidney Johnston has maneuvered his troops from Corinth to the area that contains numerous Union camps, and despite missteps has effected a surprise that has given the Southerners an early advantage in the fighting. In a joking mood, Sidney Johnston remarks, “That checkmates them,” as fighting swirls around features that will become legendary in what becomes known as the “Hornets’ Nest” for its bitter and bloody action. Before the combat near Sarah Bell’s peach orchard is finished, Johnston suffers a wound, which due to a pre-war injury and his high-topped boots he is unaware until he has nearly bled to death. “Yes, and I fear seriously,” he explains to an inquiry concerning his wounding while still mounted on his horse, Fire-eater. Carried to a ravine for closer examination, it is already too late, a fate made all the more memorable because Johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket.\n\nIn the meantime, the defense of the Hornets’ Nest winds down, but the men of Stephen Hurlbut, Benjamin Prentiss and William H.L. Wallace, have bought Grant precious time to cobble a powerful defense line together near Pittsburg Landing. A Confederate round slams into Wallace’s face and as the action passes him, he remains on the battleground, not knowing that his wife, Ann, has reached the scene and awaits anxiously aboard a steamboat on the Tennessee River. Only the day before, Wallace, believed she was still in Illinois.\n\nKentuckian John S. Jackman noted simply, \"This day will long be remembered.\"\n\nFrom the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, an Ohioan observes:“I see the deep traces of war depicted in the brow of many mothers, wives and sisters as I pass through the villages of this valley. . . . It pains me to pass through their towns. I feel as if I was looked upon as being one who was helping to spread this pall of woe upon their once happy homes. I am not fit for a soldier. Soldiers should be made of iron, with hearts as fierce as fire, and of a purpose as cool and relentless as fate.”\n\nFor all of the horrors of war in places like Shiloh, the war exacts a less glamorous, but deadly toll elsewhere. At his station in the Gulf of Mexico, a Union diarist notes without much elaboration as to the circumstances:“Six of the Maine boys were drowned while bathing.”\n\nIn the vicinity of Island No. 10 in the Mississippi River, John Pope stages for an attack that will, if successful, push the Federal tide toward Memphis.\n\nApril 7, 1862\n\nAt Shiloh the first day has gone reasonably well from the Confederate standpoint, although the loss of Albert Sidney Johnston remains to manifest itself completely. More ominous is the inability to shatter a last line of Union defense at Pittsburg Landing or to prevent the arrival of additional forces under William “Bull” Nelson and the wayward Lew Wallace, through the night. P.G.T. Beauregard has assumed the mantle of leadership for the Southern forces, but seems to believe that the fight is essentially over. Today will prove him wrong.\n\nBy the end of these two days’ fighting, more names, such as “Bloody Pond,” have become part of the Civil War lexicon. The Federals have tallied 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded and 2,885 missing or captured to the Confederates’ 1,723 dead, 8,012 wounded and 959 missing or captured.\n\nOn the Mississippi, Island No. 10 falls along with some 7,000 supporting Confederate troops.\n\nApril 8, 1862\n\nThe Confederate retreat to Corinth continues. Nathan Bedford Forrest confronts William T. Sherman at Fallen Timbers and is fortunate to escape with his life when he leads a charge into Union lines only to find that he has carried himself so far that he is alone and surrounded by blue-coated antagonists. Although suffering a gunshot wound, Forrest turns, grabs a hapless Union defender and uses him as a shield until he is out of range and discards the fellow.\n\nAlong the Mississippi, Brigadier General William W. Mackall, consummates the surrender of the Island No. 10 defenders.\n\nIn the Trans-Mississippi, Henry Sibley’s retreat encounters light opposition at Albuquerque. The New Mexico Territory is rapidly returning to Union control.\n\nNews has reached the Appalachians about Shiloh, but as usual it is a jumbled mix of rumor and unsubstantiated reports. Kentuckian Edward Guerrant grasps at the “Glorious News!”: Intelligence was received today of a fierce & bloody battle . . . which resulted in the entire overthrow of the Vandal Hordes of Lincoln—with the loss of six thousand prisoners & 80 pieces of artillery—but too dearly bought by the lamented death of the great & gallant Genl. A. Sydney Johnston. We hope this part is not true.—The information is considered reliable. It will offset Fort Donelson—Roanoak Island etc. and all our late reverses. May God grant it be so!”\n\nApril 10, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln has a busy day. He accepts a joint resolution from Congress on the matter of gradual emancipation by the states and issues a proclamation of thanksgiving to celebrate recent military successes:“It has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe signal victories to the land and naval forces engaged in suppressing an internal rebellion, and at the same time to avert from our country the dangers of foreign intervention and invasion.”\n\nThe tone of Lincoln’s pronouncement is fitting backdrop for the fading W.H.L. Wallace. In and out of delirium, he finally gives in to the wounds he had suffered defending the Hornets’ Nest. Ann is with him in the Cherry Mansion at Savannah, Tn., until the end.\n\nFrom nearby Tybee Island, heavy guns erected by troops under the command of Brigadier General Quincy Gillmore open on Fort Pulaski, which protects the approach to Savannah, Georgia.\n\nApril 11, 1862\n\nPounding by the Union guns on Tybee Island renders further defense of masonry Fort Pulaski impossible as rounds threaten to widen breaches in the wall and fall in the vicinity of the fort’s powder magazine.\n\nApril 12, 1862\n\nJames J. Andrews and a band of raiders use a brief stop for breakfast as the opportunity for absconding with the locomotive General, precipitating a chase that covers ground from Big Shanty, north of Marietta, Georgia, to the vicinity of Chattanooga. William Fuller pursues the band relentlessly and finally helps to run the raiders to ground.\n\nFrom the Gulf, Rufus Kinsley records more noncombat tragedies experienced by his comrades:“Awful thunder storm last night. 4 men of the 31st Mass. killed by lightning.”\n\nOn his own initiative, Union general David Hunter declares slaves found in the area of Fort Pulaski to be considered confiscated from their masters and emancipated.\n\nFrom the “Battle Ground of Pittsburgh Landing,” Emerson Opdycke relates the events of the recent engagement to his wife from the perspective of an officer connected with General Don Carlos Buell and who is convinced that the arrival of these reinforcements has saved Grant’s army after the disastrous opening day:“[A]s the darkness came on, the enemy withdrew a little to the rear, having driven Grant from all his positions, captured many of his batteries, and the most of his camp and garrison equipage etc. etc., in short had we not come up, Grant could not have escaped with ten thousand men. . . . . Such inexcusable inefficiency ought to cost Gen. Grant his office if not his life. No good officer need ever be surprised to the extent that he was if he regard [the] plainest rules of War.”\n\nApril 13, 1862\n\nDiarist Emma Holmes recalls the significance of the day, but tempers the memory with more recent and sobering events in Georgia:“The first anniversary of the surrender of Fort Sumter. We scarcely feel like celebrating it, when [Fort] Pulaski has just fallen.”\n\nApril 16, 1862\n\nThe Confederate States of America enters a new phase of conducting war as President Jefferson Davis signs into law a conscription act that ostensibly impacts every white male between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five.\n\nBy presidential signature on legislation passed by Congress, Abraham Lincoln brings slavery to an end in the District of Columbia.\n\nApril 18, 1862\n\nForts Jackson and St. Philip, meant to guard the approaches to New Orleans from the Gulf via the Mississippi, come under attack.\n\nFrom his camp is Augusta County, Va., Irby Scott informs his father:“Shenandoah Mountain is naturally a very strong position being very steep on all sides. We will soon have it well fortified and then we defy the yankees to come and take it. If Stonewall Jackson will maintain his ground and not fall back any farther we will hold this mountain untill the cows come home.”\n\nThe warmer weather and absence from home have combined for the homesick soldier, although he will argue that he is not as “low spirited or grieving” as he sounds:“I want to see you all worse than ever since spring has set in. Spring here is quite different from what it is in Georgia. I think of home and the loved ones there almost a hundred times a day.”\n\nApril 19, 1862\n\nSouth Mills, North Carolina, is the scene of fighting as Federal troops seek to disperse Confederate defenders and destroy locks on the Dismal Swamp Canal. The Union forces encounter resistance, but succeed in forcing them to retreat after several hours of combat.\n\nApril 20, 1862\n\nFrom Tennessee, Union lieutenant Friedrich Bertsch recalls happier Easter Sundays of the past: \"It is a Sunday but no sun, rather a rainy day, as yesterday and the day before, wet memories; the bunnies and Easter eggs are completely missing. . . . And so according to all probability, the Easter celebration here will be quite gloomy, and if we carry our thoughts to home, we run the danger of becoming homesick.”\n\nApril 21, 1862\n\nThe Confederate Congress adjourns.\n\nApril 22, 1862\n\nFrom near Yorktown, Va., Confederate officer Thomas J. Goree tells his mother:“We are now organized and ready and more than eager for the fray. We have been daily expecting McClellan to make an attack, but he has not done so. . . . I do not know what Gen. Johnston’s plans are, but I suppose that if McClellan does not attack soon, we will.”\n\nGoree reminds his mother that George Washington and Lord Cornwallis had once clashed in the vicinity:“Our Hd Qurts [is] in 100 yards of Washington’s old breastworks. I feel that the fate of Va., if not the Confederacy, depends on the result of this fight. We must win it, or all is lost. I will not say all is lost, but it will be very hard for us to recover from a defeat here.”\n\nApril 23, 1862\n\nThe actions of the last several days in the lower Mississippi have convinced Flag Officer David G. Farragut to try to run past Forts Jackson and St. Philip, guarding the approach to New Orleans.\n\nApril 24, 1862\n\nFarragut’s fleet is underway in its dangerous, but exhilarating, effort to cross the guns of the Confederate forts protecting the Crescent City. In the darkness of early morning and amidst heavy fire and smoke, the vessels move beyond the fixed fortifications and obstructions that were supposed to prevent them from doing so. A “mosquito fleet” that features the ram Manassas tries to do what the forts had not in preventing the further advance of the Union ships, but to no avail. Most of the Southern vessels are lost, with approximately 100 casualties in gray, while the Union forces sustain losses of one craft, 37 men killed and 149 wounded.\n\nApril 25, 1862\n\nDavid Farragut reaches New Orleans amid chaos and confusion, with no one apparently willing to “surrender” the city. The remnants of the uncompleted Confederate ironclad Mississippi burns.\n\nFort Macon, guarding Beaufort Harbor in North Carolina, is also under attack, with heavy artillery fire disabling many of the Confederate guns. Colonel Moses White sees no choice but to hoist a white flag over the beleaguered installation.\n\nThe outcome of Shiloh has left grief and despair that people on both sides recognize as shared elements to be endured. Kentucky Unionist Josie Underwood observes of one fallen Confederate:“A nobler, sweeter soul never entered Heaven—no matter how wrong the cause for which he died, he believed it—to him it was sacred. Oh! the crime of the men on both sides. Fanatics North and South who brought about this cruel war.”\n\nAnother prominent Union officer, Brigadier General Charles F. Smith, who had scrapped his leg badly, only to watch as infection set in and then find himself wracked with dysentery, dies in the same house that had held the fatally-stricken General Wallace and served as headquarters for General Grant.\n\nApril 26, 1862\n\nIn North Carolina, 400 more Southern defenders of a fortified post stack their arms as prisoners of war as the formal surrender of Fort Macon takes place.\n\nIn South Carolina, Mary Chesnut processes more ill-tidings from the Western Theat:“Doleful dumps—alarm bells ringing. Telegrams say the [Union] mortar fleet has passed the forts at New Orleans. . . . Down into the very depth of despair are we.”\n\nApril 27, 1862\n\nA night of rest and reflection has not softened the blow for the proud Southerner:“New Orleans gone—and with it the Confederacy. Are we not cut in two.”\n\nHer anger is particular strong toward government officials: “The Confederacy done to death by the politicians. What wonder we are lost. Those wretched creatures the Congress and the legislature could never rise to the greatness of the occasion. They seem to think they were in a neighborhood squabble about precedence.”\n\nNow that New Orleans is gone, several small fortifications give up to their opponents, while some of the most desperate members of the isolated garrison at Fort Jackson mutiny and abandon the post out of fear for their own fates.\n\nMaury’s brief tenure in East Tennessee ends with his replacement by Simon Buckner as commander of the department\n\nApril 28, 1862\n\nForts Jackson and St. Philip, rendered no longer relevant to the protection of New Orleans and with their dispirited defenders cut off from further supply, capitulate to the Federals.\n\nApril 29, 1862\n\nWith the Confederate evacuation of New Orleans by troops under Mansfield Lovell, Mary Chesnut believes she has identified a flaw in strategy:“War seems a game of chess—but we have an unequal number of pawns to begin with. We had knights, kings, queens, bishops, and castles enough. But our skillful generals—whenever they cannot arrange the board to suit them exactly, they burn up everything and march away. We want them to save the country. They seem to think their whole duty is to destroy [our own] ships and save the[ir] army.”\n\nKentuckian Edward Guerrant registers his assessment of the loss of New Orleans while buoying his spirits with faith in a mightier hand at work:“This is a great blow to the Confederacy—but ‘our cause it is just, And in God is our trust!”\n\nApril 30, 1862\n\nAn incredulous Chesnut concludes: \"The last day of this month of calamities. Lovell has left the women and children to be shelled and took the army to a safe place. I do not understand. Why not send the women and children to the safe place and let the army stay where fighting was to be? Armies are to save, not to be saved—at least, to be saved is not their raison d’etre, exactly. If this goes on the spirit of our people will be broken.”\n\nMay 1, 1862\n\nPressure from George B. McClellan’s massive Union command has convinced Joseph E. Johnston that the time for evacuating the Yorktown line toward Richmond is drawing nigh and he so informs President Jefferson Davis.\n\nMcClellan is completing the process of mounting siege guns that he hopes will pummel the Confederates into submission and secure him the commendation of a grateful nation for having saved the Union. President Abraham Lincoln remains worried, concerned that Little Mac’s request for more artillery “argues indefinite procrastination.”\n\nIn the Shenandoah, Lieutenant Colonel Alvin Coe Voris confesses to confusion about the attitudes of some of the citizens he has encountered:“If I was a Virginian as I am an Ohioan by the Eternal I would do differently than do the FFV [First Families of Virginia] in this fight. I would strike here, there & everywhere when a foe presents. I would not run unless to strike at a better point, & when I did strike I would make it till the enemies of my state fell in battle rather than by the fleetness with which I fled from the approach of the ‘cowardly Yankees’.”\n\nVoris is convinced that the end is near for the Confederacy at any rate:“The boys are beginning to look forward to a time when this accursed war will be brought to a close. Events look verry discouraging to the rebels. New Orleans, the whole Mississippi, the seaboard forts, Yorktown, and all the later battles must be exceedingly unconsoling to them.”\n\nFurther westward, Lieutenant Friedrich Bertsch complains that the newspapers had made “fake heroes” of generals like Ulysses Grant and William Sherman after Shiloh, at the expense of Don Carlos Buell, Lew Wallace, William “Bull” Nelson and others:“What is not possible in America, the birthplace of Humbug in all well-developed forms?”\n\nMay 2, 1862\n\nFrom his post in South Carolina, William P. DuBose, reflects his concerns for the safety of Charleston and other coastal cities:“It would be sad to see our beloved City in the hands of the Enemy, but so far as our course, & the policy of the war are concerned, I am fast becoming reconciled to the surrender of every place accessible to gun boats, and falling back into the country.\n\nMay 3, 1862\n\nThere will be no showdown this time at the site of Lord Cornwallis’s surrender in 1781, as the Confederates evacuate their positions around Yorktown, Va.\n\nIn Richmond, President Jefferson Davis establishes May 16 as a day for humiliation and prayer in the face of the setbacks the Confederacy has experienced:“An enemy, waging war in a manner violative of the usage of civilized nations, has invaded our country. With presumptuous reliance on superior numbers, he has declared his purpose to reduce us to submission. . . . Recent disaster has spread gloom over the land, and sorrow sits at the hearthstones of our countrymen; but a people conscious of rectitude and faithfully relying on their Father in Heaven may be cast down, but cannot be dismayed.”\n\nMay 4, 1862\n\n“The success is brilliant,” George B. McClellan proclaims as his forces move into the abandoned works at Yorktown, culminating a month-long siege and stalemate that has nevertheless left a bitter taste for the Union commander.\n\nConfederate troops are evacuating elsewhere as well, in Tucson, in the New Mexico Territory.\n\nMay 5, 1862\n\nA heavy fight in the rain in the vicinity of the colonial town of Williamsburg pits the vanguard of McClellan’s army and the rearguard of Joseph Johnston’s. The task for defending the Southern column chiefly falls to James Longstreet. By the time the combat ends, the Federals have experienced some 2,200 casualties and the Confederates approximately 1,700.\n\nMay 6, 1862\n\nAbraham Lincoln is out of Washington, arriving at Fortress Monroe, in the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nMay 7, 1862\n\nLincoln visits with the crew of the celebrated Union ironclad, Monitor, who may yet have much work to do in supporting McClellan’s push for Richmond.\n\nFurther along the James River, Brigadier General William B. Franklin sends his division on a mission that will flank the retreating Confederates and quite possibly score the decisive, and as yet elusive, victory that Little Mac has sought. Tough fighting at Eltham’s Landing (also West Point or Barhamsville), prevents the effort from succeeding. Good execution by Brigadier John Bell Hood helps to win the day for the Southerners. When Joe Johnston chides Hood for exceeding his orders and asks what would have happened if he had instructed the Texans to drive the Federals back instead of ordering a probe, the pugilistic subordinate answers:\"I suppose, General, they would have driven them into the river, and tried to swim out and capture the gunboats.\"\n\nMay 8, 1862\n\nStonewall Jackson maneuvers his small 9,000-man army in the Valley of Virginia for a blow against one of the many Union forces arrayed against him. Union brigadier general Robert H. Milroy is in the vicinity of McDowell, having been reinforced by Brigadier General Robert C. Schenck as the lead elements of Major General John C. Fremont’s command. Although outnumbered, the 6,000 Federals opt to attack and Jackson finds himself in a tough battle along the heights of Sitlington’s Hill. Holding the center of the Confederate position and subjected to a galling fire from the advancing enemy, the 12th Georgia will lose 40 killed and 140 wounded of 540 men engaged. Stubbornness, adds to the exposure of the troops, as the Georgians refuse to fall back to a more defensible position, with one of them insisting gallantly, “We did not come all this way to Virginia to run before [the] Yankees.”\n\nThe Confederates hold their ground, but at a fearful cost that set 500 total casualties against Union losses of 256. Nevertheless, Milroy will withdraw, leaving McDowell to Jackson.\n\nOn another front in Virginia, everyone is not pleased that the Southern forces are pulling back from the lower Peninsula. But North Carolinian William Dorsey Pender, with the retreating command, is not one of them. He tells his wife:“We are out of the Peninsula which was a perfect trap for us. We had some hard marching.”\n\nMay 9, 1862\n\nNorfolk and Portsmouth, Va., which boasts an important shipyard and other facilities is no longer in Confederate hands.\n\nRepositioning in Virginia has not diminished the expectation of ultimate success for Dorsey Pender:“Tomorrow or [the] next day will place us where we will make a stand for Richmond. No one amongst us fears the result.”\n\nUnion major general David Hunter disseminates General Orders, No. 11, from Hilton Head, South Carolina, based upon his previous declaration of martial law in the region:“Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible; the persons in these three states of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina—heretofore held as slaves, are therefore declared forever free.”\n\nIn Kentucky, with most troops having passed on to the front lines, Unionist Josie Underwood records in her diary:“The days are so beautiful now—but the poor little town looks distressingly dilapidated. The buildings burned when the rebels left, have never been rebuilt. The streets are in dreadful condition, ever so many hospitals, full of sick soldiers. . . . Deserted camping grounds . . . with all sorts of cast-off things, scattered around. The soldier’s ‘graveyard’ getting bigger—every day nearly, a few more new boards at the head and foot of mounds of fresh earth, maybe a name on the boards—maybe just a number.”\n\nMay 10, 1862\n\nA tangle between “fleets” occurs at Plum Run Bend as a small contingent of Southern vessels under Captain James E. Montgomery confronts Union mortar boats and ironclads. Despite the unlikely odds, the Confederates sink Cincinnati and Mound City in shallow water and put up a brave show before dropping back from the heavy Union firepower that has taken its toll on them as well.\n\nIn the lower Tidewater of Virginia, President Lincoln has come to witness personally the occupation of Norfolk and its environs.\n\nOne dismayed relative wrote her cousin in the Confederate service, relaying a caustic assessment of Joseph Johnston from the civilian perspective:\n\n\"Do you think of Beauragards movements as the boys in Virginia remarked of Gen. Johns[t]on? When asked by a citizen where they were falling back to now? Replied 'They did'nt know unless to Mexico.'\"\n\nMay 11, 1862\n\nFor all of its promise, the Confederate ironclad Virginia simply draws too much water to be safely moved beyond the reach of advancing Federal forces. As a result, she is scuttled to prevent her from falling into Union hands and the brief, but historic career of the vessel in its most recent and celebrated incarnation comes to a close.\n\nMay 12, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln “relaxes” the naval blockade at Southern ports now in the hands of Union forces in “the interests of commerce.” His actions end the restrictions to trade, except for “contraband of war” that had existed at Beaufort, Port Royal and New Orleans in South Carolina and Louisiana.\n\nWilliam T. Sherman remains dogged by press reports that have soured him on the Fourth Estate. To brother John, he asserts that in response to newspaper criticism:“For my part though silent I have at times felt that I would prefer to be governed by Davis, Beauregard & Bragg, [than] to be thus abused by a set of dirty newspaper scribblers who have the impudence of Satan. They come into camp, poke around among the lazy shirks & pick up their camp Rumors & publish them as facts. . . . They are a pest and Shall not approach me, and I will treat them as spies, which in truth they are.”\n\nMay 13, 1862\n\nDiarist Mary Chesnut, who has recently lamented: “It is this giving up that kills me. Norfolk they talk of now. Why not Charleston next?” notes on this day, Norfolk burnt—the Merrimack sunk without striking a blow.”\n\nCharleston will have its own moment of drama as an African-American pilot named Robert Smalls takes advantage of an opportunity to escape with other crewmen and family members on a small vessel called the Planter and bring it successfully out to the Union blockading fleet. His actions make him a hero in the North and merit a subsequent personal visit with President Lincoln.\n\nIt is a day of speechmaking for Abraham Lincoln. To one delegation he assures: “You well know, gentlemen, and the world knows, how reluctantly I accepted this issue of battle forced upon me, on my advent to this place, by the internal enemies of our country.”\n\nTo members of the 12th Indiana Regiment he asserts:“For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful, but, on the other hand, I assure you that the nation is more indebted to you, and such as you, than to me. It is upon the brave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country that our reliance has been placed in support of free government and free institutions.”\n\nMay 15, 1862\n\nFort Darling at Drewry’s Bluff on the James River is the scene of a significant Union effort to ascend that tributary to approach the Confederate capital. The Southern gunners and their Northern counterparts will exchange a furious fire for several hours before the river attack subsides with damage to the Union vessels, particularly the ironclad gunboat Galena. Despite the inspirational presence of the Monitor, the Federals find that this avenue to Richmond is closed.\n\nConfederate war department clerk John B. Jones, confides in his diary:The enemy’s gun-boats, Monitor, Galena, etc., are at Drewry’s Bluff, eight miles below the city, shelling our batteries, and our batteries are bravely shelling them. The President rode down to the vicinity this morning, and observed the firing. The guns are heard distinctly in the city, and yet there is no consternation manifested by the people.”\n\nAnother defense of Confederate assets occurs in western Virginia, where Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall launches a campaign against his Union counterpart Jacob D. Cox in order to protect the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad from assault.\n\nAt Liverpool, England, a seemingly nondescript vessel (it bore only the number 290) is launched from the Laird Shipyards that will soon assume a famous identity in Confederate service as the Alabama.\n\nUnion major general Benjamin F. Butler, has once more made his presence known in New Orleans by issuing Order No. 28 in response to the behavior of recalcitrant female Rebels in the city:“As the officers and soldiers of the United States have been subject to repeated insults from the women (calling themselves ladies) of New Orleans in return for the most scrupulous non-interference and courtesy on our part, it is ordered that hereafter when any female shall by word, gesture, or movement insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States she shall be regarded and held liable to be treated as a woman of the town plying her avocation.”\n\nThe opprobrium offered in response to the directive spreads rapidly across the Confederacy, reflecting the disdain many Southerners have come to feel for “Beast Butler.”\n\nMay 16, 1862\n\nButler continues his crackdown in New Orleans, shutting down the newspaper the Bee. The notorious Union general also acquires the nickname “Spoons” for his reputation of requisitioning silverware from local residences.\n\nIn Richmond, President Davis gains a renewed sense of his capital’s defensibility, but vows to his wife that the city will be destroyed before it is surrendered.\n\nNear Corinth, William T. Sherman evaluates conditions as he sees them:“You Know my opinion of newsmongers and Reporters, and that I scorn them from the bottom of my soul. . . . I hold the soldiers harmless, but I do blame those leaders whether of Military or Civil Life who have impressed the men with the belief that all they have to do was to come south and the Secesh would run. They now find themselves mistaken and are ‘tired of the war.’”\n\nMay 17, 1862\n\nHumphrey Marshall’s operations come to a successful close, with Cox withdrawing, having sustained 129 casualties to Confederate losses of 16.\n\nLincoln foreshadows his reaction to Union major general David Hunter’s emancipation proclamation in a message to a Cabinet official:“No commanding general shall do such a thing, upon my responsibility, without consulting me.”\n\nMay 18, 1862\n\nCitizens of the small Virginia town of Suffolk are on their way to church when Union cavalry appear. A mother and child take note of the arrival of the blue-coated mounted troops, with the boy raising his cap and shouting, “Hurrah for Jeff Davis!” The Union commander rides over, wags his finger gently in the lad’s direction and admonishes, “You little traitor,” as the mortified parent grabs her child and races for the security of their home. The war has hit home for this previously quiet community.\n\nDavid Farragut brings his fleet to Vicksburg and brashly demands the capitulation of the river city and its garrison. Confederate brigadier general Morgan L. Smith declines.\n\nMay 19, 1862\n\nJohn B. Jones is in the Confederate capital, mostly trying to figure out how the tobacco stored in warehouses in the city can be disposed of if Richmond falls, but also keeps a wary eye on the advance of the Union army:“We await the issue before Richmond. It is still believed by many that it is the intention of the government and the generals to evacuate the city.”\n\nIn Washington, President Lincoln has battles of another kind on his mind as he formally rejects General Hunter’s proclamation of emancipation:“[N]either General Hunter, nor any other commander, or person has been authorized by the Government of the United States to make proclamations declaring the slaves of any State free, and that the supposed proclamation . . . is altogether void.” Aside from the determination that generals in the field will not establish government policy, he retains the hope that some of the states will embrace the idea of gradual compensated emancipation.\n\nAs he enters Warrenton, Va., with his troops, Lieutenant Colonel Voris observes mixed reactions among the black and white populace:“The negroes appear pleased to see us. The whites act sullen. . . . A verry pretty young girl made a nasty face at me as I rode at the head of my column through town. . . . The girls feel chagrined at the fact that their fellows have been compelled to make tracks before the cowardly Yankees. Our advent wounds their pride as well as their affections. Their hate is as much the hate of wounded pride as of anger.”\n\nMay 20, 1862\n\nWith Southern delegations no longer blocking passage, the Homestead Law goes into effect with President Abraham Lincoln’s signature. The path-breaking legislation would be a powerful accomplishment for any administration under ordinary circumstances, but these are hardly ordinary. Even so, the advancement of the settlement of the West becomes its hallmark.\n\nMay 21, 1862\n\nBenjamin Butler’s actions in New Orleans raises Mary Chesnut’s ire in Charleston.“There is said to be an order from Butler, turning over the women of New Orleans to his soldiers! Then is the measure of his iniquities filled. We thought that generals always restrained by shot or sword, if need be, the brutal soldiery. The hideous cross-eyed beast orders his men to treat the ladies of New Orleans as women of the town. To punish them, he says, for their insolence.”\n\nDorsey Pender is in a similar mood outside Richmond. He explains to his wife, Fanny:“By the way, have you seen Gen. Butler’s order or proclamation in which he says if another lady dares treat a Yankee officer discourteously they shall be treated as women of the town—that is, women of bad repute. Did you ever hear of such brutality, trying to frighten our poor women into showing respect to his miserable drunken rabble. Can such people succeed[?] I pray not.”\n\nEmerson Opdycke has happier news for the Union cause in the Western Theater:“We have made another advance on Corinth and are now within a mile and a half of the rebel works. I was out Monday on picket with the regiment; we had an all day fight with the rebel pickets, the balls flew among us, and over us, quite briskly; one struck a sapling a few inches above my head: we could see the rebels aiming, and firing at us, but it was nothing but fun, after going through the Shiloh battle.”\n\nMay 22, 1862\n\nJones responds to events in the Shenandoah Valley with unalloyed joy and a sense of prescience:“There is lightning in the Northwest [Virginia], and the deep thundering of avenging guns is heard in Washington! Gen. Jackson, sent thither by Gen. Lee, is sweeping everything before him, defeating Shields, Banks, Fremont, and one or two other yankee major-generals with his little corps d’arme!”\n\nMay 23, 1862\n\nFront Royal, Va., becomes the site of a clash between Stonewall Jackson’s “foot cavalry,” and elements of Union troops under Nathaniel P. Banks. Colonel John R. Kenly commands a force of just over a thousand men, confronting opponents who bring three times that number into the engagement. Despite a furious struggle, in which the 1st Maryland on both sides battle each other directly, the fight ends with a surrender of some 700 men after Kenly has suffered a wound. Banks decides to retreat with his main force from Strasburg rather than risk being cut off from his line of communications and supply.\n\nMay 24, 1862\n\nJackson strikes at the flank of the Federal forces in an effort to intercept Banks as he retreats. The Confederates succeed in creating chaos and capturing troops and supply wagons, but it is clear that they are only tangling with a rear-guard. Jackson orders Major General Richard S. Ewell to proceed to Winchester, where he hopes to engage the bulk of Banks’s retiring army.\n\nIn the evening, President Lincoln responds to reports that Henry Halleck has been seeking reinforcements by informing him:“I beg you to be assured we do the best we can. I mean to cast no blame when I tell you each of our commanders along our line from Richmond to Corinth supposes himself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own.”\n\nMay 25, 1862\n\nFighting continues to flare around Winchester, Va., as troops under Stonewall Jackson clash once more with Banks. Although the Federals will lose over 2,000 men, the bulk of these are prisoners. The 62 killed and 243 wounded roughly match the Confederate casualties of 68 killed and 329 wounded. By the end of these several days of combat and withdrawal, Nathaniel Banks has assumed a derisive new nickname from his opponents based upon the resources that fallen into enemy hands: “Commissary Banks.” The Southern successes add pressure on President Lincoln to retain troops that might otherwise be employed to reinforce McClellan as he closes on Richmond. -\n\nMay 26, 1862\n\nWriting the “Dear ones at home,” Irby G. Scott describes the circumstances he has recently passed through with Stonewall Jackson:“Yesterday we were in sight of them about 4 miles our men and them running as fast as they could. We ran them through town, the Ladies cheered and thanked us as we passed. They tried to burn their stores but the fire was put out and nearly everything saved. They must have lost everything they had for I never saw the like of plunder in my life.”\n\nIn Washington, President Lincoln responds to a resolution of censure by the U.S. Congress aimed at former secretary of war Simon Cameron in which he spreads responsibility widely for actions taken at the outbreak of hostilities. Although meant to provide the background and justification for the steps followed by the administration, the language is among Lincoln’s strongest regarding the events that led to the present conflict from his perspective:“The insurrection which is yet existing in the United States, and aims at the overthrow of the federal Constitution and the Union, was clandestinely prepared during the winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open organization in the form of the treasonable provisional government at Montgomery, in Alabama, on the 18th day of February, 1861. On the 12th day of April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by the bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter, which cut off the hope of immediate conciliation.”\n\nWhile contemplating the slowly developing campaign to take Corinth, in which he is participating, Lieutenant Bertsch suggests the possibility of a [tank-like] “‘Monitor’ for land operations, as do our naval forces for sea battles. It would certainly be practicable to fabricate a—at least in its parts—mobile, bombproof revolving tower on a disk that can be rotated, and then set it up at a suitable place. Such a machine, which is turned around by hand and fires its destructive projectiles toward all sides, can send a hail of balls that could finish Corinth, the surrounding area, and all contents in a day, sweep everything clean.”\n\nBertsch is convinced that if the vaunted Yankee ingenuity cannot develop such a device, someone else, like the Swedish-born inventor of the Monitor itself would likely do so.\n\nAt Corinth, William Sherman suggests that their opponents are soldiers of better caliber than ordinarily credited and “are our equals in all respects,” but concludes:“Still our army is now composed of all of the best troops & men in the West and if we cannot conquer here we might as well give it up.”\n\nMay 29, 1862\n\nNot all ill-feeling lies between Confederates and Federals. Newly arrived in eastern Virginia, Lieutenant Colonel Alvin Voris experiences the underlying tensions between his Ohio troops and some of their compatriots, who seem to enjoy the lion’s share of soldier amenities:“It is not always so bad with us, but somehow or other the [War] Department has an idea that our Division can fight and march and endure hardships as if they were made of iron, while the Eastern troops are distributed over the country in fine camps with nice tents. . . . Our boys call these troops Band Box soldiers, and next to thrashing Jackson would like to see these bandbox fellows licked by the secesh.”\n\nMay 30, 1862\n\nThe long and methodical crawl toward the key rail junction of Corinth, Ms., comes to a less than dramatic conclusion as P.G.T. Beauregard evacuates the town. Henry Halleck has won the campaign’s chief goal, but the accomplishment has hardly been accompanied by raucous celebrations.\n\nThe frustration is felt in the ranks of the missed opportunities in Mississippi. Emerson Opdycke tells his wife:“I have just returned from Corinth, no fight, rebels left last night, we could have taken their whole army, two days ago. I am boiling over with wrath, and cannot write about it. . . . The Rebs left an effigy with ‘Halleck out witted’ fastened on it.”\n\nConfederate bureaucrat John B. Jones notes the tone of public expressions in the North as the Southern capital faces the fate Corinth has experienced: Northern papers manifest much confidence in the near approach of the downfall of Richmond, and the end of the ‘rebellion.’ The 15th of June is the utmost limit allowed us for existence.”\n\nMay 31, 1862\n\nA great engagement begins in the defense of Richmond as the first day of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines takes place. Joseph Johnston has created a complex plan of battle that ostensibly will bring larger concentrated numbers against a portion of his opponent’s army. Unfortunately, for Confederate hopes, the scheme unravels from the start, plagued by misdirection and lack of coordination. The Southerners make progress, but the attacks bog down as Union reinforcements reach the field. In the evening, Johnston is riding along when a musket ball strikes his shoulder, followed shortly by a shell fragment hitting him in his chest. Debilitated from the blows, Johnston relinquishes command to Gustavus W. Smith for the remainder of the day, although a new individual will be in place on June 1. In the meantime, both sides have drawn blood, in copious amounts, but the battle is not yet decided.\n\nJune 1, 1862\n\nThe battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines continues as the Confederates strive to deflect the advance of George McClellan’s army toward Richmond. A wounded Joseph Johnston has given way in command to Robert E. Lee, upon whose shoulders the successful defense of the Southern capital now falls.\n\nOn the streets of Richmond, War department clerk John B. Jones records an encounter with a young warrior who has been engaged in the fighting outside the capital:“I saw a boy, not more than fifteen years old (from South Carolina), with his hand in a sling. He showed me his wound. A ball had entered between the fingers of his left hand and lodged near the wrist, where the flesh was much swollen. He said, smiling, ‘I’m going to the hospital just to have the ball cut out, and will then return to the battle-field. I can fight with my right hand’.”\n\nJune 3, 1862\n\nWar Clerk Jones anticipates a positive outcome from the shift of command to Robert E. Lee:“Gen. Lee henceforth assumes command of the army in person. This may be hailed as the harbinger of a bright fortune.”\n\nJune 4, 1862\n\nThe caustic Kentuckian Edward Guerrant passes through far Southwest Virginia, making contact with a local family that is scrapping by with thirteen children to feed and concludes: “If ‘Ignorance is bliss’ this family is blessed.”\n\nJune 6, 1862\n\nWilliam T. Sherman writes his friend Ulysses Grant, who still feels the barbs of the press from Shiloh:“There is a power in our land, irresponsible, corrupt and malicious—‘the press,’ which has created the intense feelings of hostility that has arrayed the two parts of the country against each other, which must be curbed and brought within the just limits of reason and law, before we can have peace in America.We can deal with armies who have a visible and tangible existence, but it will require tact and skill and courage to clip the wings of this public enemy.”\n\nSherman is convinced that Grant’s enemies have turned the general’s “just celebrity” after Fort Donelson against him “to pull you from the pinnacle which you had richly attained.”\n\nJune 7, 1862\n\nOhioan Alvin C. Voris:“Trick, traffic, artifice and force already have cleared the whole country of food for both men and horse. All the available horses are pressed into the service on one side or another. Farms are desolate. . . . The fences are torn down to make shelter and fuel for the army. My own victuals and tent have consumed many rods of Old Virginia fence since I first set foot on [her] sacred soil. These Virginia chivalry are much tamer than our Buckeyes would be under like circumstances.”\n\nJune 8, 1862\n\nIn South Carolina, diarist Mary Chesnut notes her sentiments regarding the earlier wounding of General Joseph Johnston near Richmond:“And now a heavy blow! Joe Johnston, the staff upon [which] we [have] leaned so heavily—his shoulder blade has been broken in battle.”\n\nJune 9, 1862\n\nEmma Holmes reaches an interesting conclusion based upon her observations that she confides in her diary:“It seems a very singular fact that, when almost every one of our important positions has been attacked this year, the floods have risen to an unprecedented height, enabling the yankee gunboats to come to our very doors, and often destroying our fortifications. Fort Donelson, Island No. 10, New Orleans, Fort Jackson, & Richmond would seem to show that the hand of God was against us, but our trust is in his goodness and mercy that he will not desert us in our great need.” Holmes also recounts the rumor that “the most execrable wretch Picayune [Ben] Butler, had been assassinated in New Orleans and rejoiced exceedingly at his righteous doom, but found it to be a mistake.”\n\nMary Chesnut continues to gather information as it becomes available on the fighting at other fronts, leading her to conclude:“When we read of battles in India, in Italy, in the Crimea—what did we care? Only an interesting topic like any other to look for in the paper. Now we hear of a battle with a thrill and a shudder. It has come home to us. Half the people that we know in the world are under the enemy’s guns.”\n\nJune 10, 1862\n\nA tangle between “fleets” occurs at Plum Run Bend as a small contingent of Southern vessels under Captain James E. Montgomery confronts Union mortar boats and ironclads. Despite the unlikely odds, the Confederates sink Cincinnati and Mound City in shallow water and put up a brave show before dropping back from the heavy Union firepower that has taken its toll on them as well.\n\nThinking strategically, Cump Sherman tells his wife: “I think the Mississippi [is] the great artery of America and whatever power holds it, holds the continent.”\n\nA bed-ridden Edward Guerrant has found that more than the glories of war are fleeting as he complains of an “affliction of the bowels, & which I fear will eventually put an untimely end to my fruitless life.”\n\nJune 12, 1862\n\nThe flamboyant gray horseman, James Ewell Brown “Jeb” Stuart embarks on a ride that will take his command completely around McClellan’s Union forces outside Richmond.\n\nStill in his sick-bed in Virginia, Edward Guerrant complains: “Between Castor Oil & a Crying kitten was deprived of my rest last night. Today is somewhat better looking—as I catch glimpses of it through the [window] glass. First day I have been able to sit up in bed.” When a comrade arrives with news that “Old Andy Johnson & ‘Picayune’ Butler—of N. Orleans” have died, the Kentuckian’s sense of humor rebounds” “May their host never grow weary of his kind attentions—nor the warmth of their reception grow cooler. Their rewards are great—I hope they may all be repaid [in Hades].”\n\nJune 14, 1862\n\nIn the pages of her diary Mary Chesnut laments:“Drop a tear for Turner Ashby. The hero of the Valley. They say he is killed! All things are against us. Memphis gone—Mississippi fleet annihilated.”\n\nJune 15, 1862\n\nStuart’s tired, but exuberant horsemen return to Richmond, having circumnavigated the Union army successfully, with the loss of only one man—Captain William Latane´ of the 9th Virginia Cavalry. Stuart has also obtained vital information on the disposition of George McClellan’s forces that will earn him the title as the “Eyes of Lee’s Army.”\n\nAn indication of the general alteration in thinking is reflected in John B. Jones’s diary entry:“What a change! No one now dreams of the loss of the capital.”\n\nPresident Lincoln continues to grapple with John C. Fremont over developments in the Shenandoah Valley:“We have no indefinite power of sending re-enforcements; so that we are compelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we have than of those we could wish to have. We may be able to send you some dribs by degrees, but I do not believe we can do more.”\n\nJune 16, 1862\n\nEmma Holmes has doubts that Northern-born John C. Pemberton will be able to defend Charleston successfully and clings to word that “our idolized Beauregard has come to inspect everything. I trust it may be true, for his presence alone will inspire that confidence which Pemberton fails to give.”\n\nIn the meantime, the battle of Secessionville rages on James Island, south of Charleston. The engagement occurs after an extended period of long-range artillery fire between the opposing commands in the area. Union brigadier general Henry W. Benham secures permission for a reconnaissance in force against a Confederate fort at Secessionville that has harassed the Federal camps. Receiving word of threatening activity by the Union forces from the local commander, Colonel Thomas G. Lamar, Confederate brigadier general Nathan G. “Shanks” Evans moves up with reinforcements. These men arrive at approximately 4:15 A.M., after Lamar’s artillery has already repulsed an initial Union advance. Subsequent attacks likewise fail and Benham orders his troops to withdraw, leaving 107 killed, 487 wounded, 89 missing on the field. The stout Confederate defense has cost Lamar and Evans 52 killed, 144 wounded, 8 missing of their own.\n\nZebulon Vance authors an editorial for the Fayetteville, N.C. newspaper from his camp at Kinston, N.C. regarding the efforts underway to advance his name for the North Carolina governorship.“Believing that the only hope of the South depended upon the prosecution of the war at all hazards and to the utmost extremity so long as the foot of an invader pressed Southern soil, I took the field at an early day, with the determination to remain there until our independence was achieved. My convictions in this regard remain unchanged. In accordance therewith I have steadily and sincerely declined all promotion save that which placed me at the head of the gallant men whom I now command. A true man should, however, be willing to serve wherever the public voice may assign him. If, therefore, my fellow-citizens believe that I could serve the great cause better as Governor than I am now doing, and should see proper to confer this great responsibility upon me without solicitation on my part, I should not feel at liberty to decline it, however conscious of my own unworthiness.”\n\nJune 17, 1862\n\nThe Confederacy has a new commander in the vital Western Department. Braxton Bragg is now in charge as an ill and unhappy Gustave Beauregard gives way.\n\nFrom his post outside Richmond with James Longstreet, staffer Thomas J. Goree describes the fighting at Seven Pines, declaring it, “only second to ‘Shiloh’ in magnitude.”\n\nAfter detailing his personal experiences, he adds soberly:“I tell you, Sis Frank, war is indeed a terrible thing. You have no idea of how one feels when he sees persons cold in death on the field, or being borne away wounded, with whom but a few hours before he was talking & laughing. I recollect one instance. On Saturday, just before the battle commenced, I was riding along with Capt. Weem and was laughing heartily at him for letting his horse throw him. I saw him a few hours afterwards a corpse, shot through the head with a Minnie ball.”\n\nJune 19, 1862\n\nAbraham Lincoln signs a law prohibiting slavery in the territories of the United States.\n\nEmma Holmes insists that the Union occupation of Memphis is nothing more than a hollow victory:“The Yankees have got nothing by the possession of Memphis, for all the cotton has been burnt [and] government stores & other valuable property as well as a great deal of private removed. . . . In fact, all that they will get is the pleasure of insulting the inhabitants.”\n\nJune 20, 1862\n\nIn his remarks to a visiting delegation of Progressive Friends, President Lincoln intimates the continuing progression of his thought concerning slavery, with Lincoln opening with a humorous note that he was grateful his visitors were not additional office-seekers, “for his chief trouble was from that class of persons.”\n\n“If a decree of emancipation could abolish Slavery, John Brown would have done the work effectually. Such a decree surely could not be more binding upon the South than the Constitution, and that cannot be enforced in that part of the country now. Would a proclamation of freedom be any more effective?”\n\nJune 21, 1862\n\nRobert Smalls, the African American pilot who had absconded with the steamer Planter and brought it out to the Union blockading fleet at Charleston, uses the same vessel and a companion gunboat to land a party of raiders south of the city. A surprise of the 16th South Carolina Infantry costs the men their camp before the Federals slip back to their ships, with the nebulous nature of the expedition making an assessment of casualties difficult.\n\nJune 22, 1862\n\nColonel Voris observes:“We hear a great deal of humbug from the army, and from verry high authority too. The American people love to be humbugged, and this war has contributed more to this appetite than anything else ever presented to our nation.”\n\n“We are within 6 or 8 miles of Manassas, and at every step see the devastating hand of war, large farms entirely turned to common, buildings destroyed, the people driven from their homes & everything indicating desolation. . . . Little do our people of the North know of the manifold ways the war is cursing the South. Poor Va. No state has been destroyed as she has.”\n\nJune 25, 1862\n\nThe Seven Days action begins with a Union movement before Richmond meant to secure high ground from which George McClellan can place and fire his siege guns at the city.
