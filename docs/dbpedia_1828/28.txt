Biography

John was born about 1315.

He married Alice, they had a son John.[1]

He arrived in Cornwall, or was possibly already resident, following appointment of Edward III to be constable of Restormel Castle at John of Eltham’s recommendation, just before his death in 1336. A post he retained for life.[2]

He also served the Black Prince as receiver of the duchy of Cornwall from c1349 until 1365 when he was replaced by Kinsman Richard de Kendale of Treworgey . [3][4]

He acquired lifetime leases on properties belonging to the duchy, and in 1342 he had been granted land on the duchy manor of Penlyne, close to Restormel, the manor of Trenode in Morval and property at Bridgend, near Lostwithiel. Such was the regard that the prince of Wales had for his retainer that in 1356 he granted to his wife and son, John, then only a child, three messuages, six acres and three roods of land at ‘Bodmalgan’ in Penlyne, as well as ten acres elsewhere, all for an annual rent of 10s.6d. [3] [5]

In 1354 Trouble was brewing between him and the prince when the prince, clearly unhappy with something appointed William de Wolleye to manage the park, part of the estate, his salary being partly taken from John’s allowance. Effectively a 33% pay cut. John agreed and the prince committed not to hold whatever the issue was against him.[6]

1355 Dec 6th he was required to convert lifetime leases back to yearly rents, a reversal of the missive to Edmund de Kendale in 1347. He was ‘assigned’ help with this and was not the lead person. This change in policy may have been the root of disagreement. [7]

1356 Sept 5th He was restored to the office of receiver of Cornwall after having made restitution with the Black Prince. [8]

He died c1372. [3]

Visitations

According to HoP The pedigree given in Vivian's Visitations of Cornwall . 258-61, is not reliable. The MP has been distinguished from a namesake and close kinsman, John, son of Richard Kendale (d.c.1390) of Treworgey. That John Kendale (whose father, MP for Lostwithiel in 1365 and 1377, Launceston in 1369, and Liskeard in 1377 and 1380, served as receiver of the Cornish estates of the duchy in 1365-9, and as sheriff of Devon in 1382-3 and of Cornw. in 1384-5), inherited substantial properties not only in south Cornw. but also in Devon (Cornw. Feet of Fines (Devon and Cornw. Rec. Soc. 1914), 639-41; CPR, 1364-7, p. 406; 1377-81, p. 427; SC6/820/9). He was reported in 1399 to have been a 'mere idiot from his birth' (CIMisc, vii. 11), and although this misfortune did not prevent him from inheriting his father's estate, from marrying, or from bringing suits at the assizes over various Cornish properties (in which John Kendale the MP had a reversionary interest), it would account for his lack of involvement in public affairs. He d. bef. 1429 leaving a da. Christine, wife of John Malerbe, as his heir (JUST 1/1502 mm. 169d. 203d, 1540 m. 90). [3]

The two John’s:

There was also a John de Kendale who was a representative of Robert de Elford, Steward of Cornwall. Both John’s are mentioned in the same folio Dec 7 1354 “Order to John de Kendale [recte Robert de Eleford], steward and sheriff of Cornewaille, and John de Kendale, receiver there, ....”[9]

MPs

The record of parliamentary service begun by Richard Kendale of Treworgey in the 1360s, continued by John Kendale and his son Stephen, and carried on by Thomas and Richard Kendale in the next generation, so starting a tradition that went on until the 18th century. [10]
