We’re going to create a “Monkey or Unicorn?” bot. Pick a door, any door! Will you get a monkey or a unicorn?

Give the bot a spin yourself here!

The journey of our Monkey or Unicorn bot takes us through the web’s simplest free chatbot building workflow:

Create a dialogue

Add content with widgets

Add triggers

Test your bot

Step 1: How to Create a Chatbot Dialogue

In the Bot Builder, go to Dialogues and then add a folder. Name your folder.

Folders help you organize your bot messages. This bot is the dandy host of the Monkey or Unicorn game, so we name it as such:

From within the folder, click on + Add Dialogue, and again, give it a name that tells you what it is. In this case, the Dialogue is the first of multiple Dialogues, so we could name it “Game Intro” or something similar.

Step 2: Add Content with Widgets

Next, you’ll be prompted to add your first chat widget to the Dialogue:

Customers.ai has a large selection of engaging chatbot widgets to choose from like:

Text

Video

Images

Image galleries

Messenger opt-in

Attachments and PDFs

Zapier Connections

GIFs

Forms

Email notifications

Navigation elements

Quick Questions

You can use any combination of chat widgets to create the content of the chatbot Dialogue.

Let’s use a Quick Question to start off the game.

Click the widget you want to use, and in this case, type your question, pick from the Quick Question options: multiple choice, text field, and some other helpful contact info your bot can collect.

One cool thing about chatbot conversion elements like Quick Questions, Forms, and Attribute tools is that these widgets collect data to your Messenger contacts customer profile.

Obviously, this is awesome for saving audience data like:

Ways to get in touch

How they heard about you

Their budget

Subscription status

Signups

A quick side note, multiple-choice options in Quick Question and Form widgets are awesome because:

They show up as interactive buttons in chat.

Buttons have minimal conversion friction.

Buttons can link to chat pages and website pages.

Buttons are so user friendly on mobile!

When you enter the multiple-choice selections, you have the option of connecting that selection to another chatbot Dialogue from a drop-down.

Add a new Dialogue to your Folder. In this case, we added “Door 1.”

From the drop-down, select the Dialogue you wish for your Messenger conversation to flow to. When you select the Dialogue, you’ll see that conversation path appear in the chatbot builder.

In this game, I’m connecting each choice, or door, to a Dialogue that reveals the unicorn or monkey hiding behind the door.

With 5 doors to choose from, there are 5 multiple-choice options, each connected to a Dialogue with a monkey or a unicorn GIF from the Giphy-powered widget!

For Doors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, click the GIF widget for the Dialogue. Then, start typing the word of whatever theme you’re looking for, and click to add it to the Dialogue:

You can add the text widget and more buttons that help keep the conversation going.

The “play again” button returns a player to the Game Intro chatbot page where they’re given the option of Doors 1 to 5 again!

Another CTA (call-to-action) lets users sign up for chatbot goodness themselves.

At this point, the bot works!

You can do a Send to Messenger Facebook ads campaign, or get a link to the chatbot landing page using the HTML element lead magnet:

And you can set up the bot to trigger if a user says something…

Step 3: Add Triggers for the Page

Q&A Triggers are useful for assigning bots to your frequently asked questions.

If someone asks “directions” you can set up a bot that responds with the address and a link to a map.

If someone asks for “pricing” your bot answers back with pricing.

The FAQ answering possibilities are endless.

You can add Q&A triggers to your bot in two ways:

When you’re in the page builder

From Q&A in the bot builder

To add a trigger as you’re building the bot, select “Add Trigger” and type in the keyword:

You might add triggers like “pricing” or “directions” or “make an appointment” or any number of keywords to match your page to something a user is asking.

Another way add triggers to pages is by going to Q&A. Here you’ll see all your saved triggers and can add to and edit them:

What you can do from here is:

Create a new trigger with “New Q&A”.

Craft the bot’s reply to the trigger, either a chat page or text. Add multiple answers to give the bot free reign to choose from any of the answers.

Add triggers you type in or choose from the drop-down that populates the most frequent unanswered questions.

See the most common unanswered questions and assign them to chatbots, if you’d like.

Step 4: Test the Bot

Before you launch, test the bot. You can do that by:

Triggering the bot in Messenger using your keyword.

Click “Test this Bot” from the chatbot content editor at any time!

When viewed in Messenger, we see what this content experience looks like on mobile:

Check that all buttons work, look for broken connections or flow issues. If it’s a conversion element, check that attributes are saved to your contact.

Now share and be merry!

By the way, did you get a monkey or unicorn?
