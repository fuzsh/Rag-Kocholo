        "text": "My opinion.\n\nthe 2nd is one of the biggest propaganda manipulation victories a goverment has ever pulled off.\n\nThe government ( right side mostly ) has made the 2nd such a hot topic that people think they actually won something by \"maintaining\" their ability to defend themselves against...\n\nAgainst what? All the stuff they never defended themselves against..\n\nPatriot act?\n\n2nd folks sat at home slurping cola\n\nGrowing poor rich divide?\n\n2nd folks sat home cleaning their guns that \"protect\" them\n\nthe highest death rate due to government in the Western World?\n\n2nd folks sat home, proudly waving the flag\n\nA 2nd guy getting a bullet to the back of his head while carrying a weapon to defend himself?\n\n2nd folks sat at home watching Friends reruns\n\nNSA spying on US citizens?\n\n2nd folks sat home typing angry reddit posts\n\nEvery member of congress miraculously becoming rich?\n\nSending mean tweets to them...\n\nIraq war\n\nCalmly sitting home being happy about their guns\n\nLies about weapons of mass destruction\n\nSitting at home...\n\nAnd now the kicker? An illegitimate President [according to a majority? of 2nd folks] !stole! the presidency and usurped the republic. Where were the 2nd folks, it was their time to shine?\n\nStill, just sitting home\n\nIn my opinion, the Trump thingy was one of the biggest PR disasters for proud loyal patriotic 2nd lovers.\n\nThey believe the election was stolen but they still all stayed home. This was the one time where it mattered according to their monologues they held explaining how important their guns were. A debacle. That's what they needed the guns for, to protect themselves against the government, or so they said.\n\nIs the 2nd Amendment group the biggest sucker pansy group? Easiest to manipulate? Get a meaningless right that has no actual importance for their everyday life and give up so much in return?\n\nThey all stayed home... All of them... That's why they needed guns, to stay home. Never was a group of so many people so easily manipulated. Facing the possibility of progress? But about your guns, you will never use and never used when it mattered.\n\nTrade token victories for actual progress and think you win... And the worst? Do jack shit when the time comes.\n\nPansies\n\nOpinion end\n\nSo, years ago, there was this youtuber named maineprepper. Ex military, TBI survivor that made videos about prepping and survival stuff. Before he dissapeared and his channel was deleted (probably because of his death, but I hope not. Dude was awesome) he posted a video about the reality of this, in regards to gun confiscation, inspired by another youtuber. The jist of it was thus: Every insurgency that's survived the rediculously overfunded and sci-fi-teched US military has been made up of (as a stereotype) illiterate, starving, brokeass goat farmers with AKs and fertilizer bombs. And yet it takes years to root out a vastly outnumbered force of them. If we ever do.\n\nContrast this with a hypothetical American insurgency. Even if no one goes AWOL once the shit goes down, the Government (AKA: military + the police + every goddamn government employee getting handed a gun and pushed out the door) is the one vastly outnumbered by said insurgency.\n\nAn insurgency made up of educated, well fed, well funded, and healthy americans with well cared for weapons, stockpiles of ammo, and a solid group of the veterans of the opposing army to lead (or at least advise) them.\n\nAn insurgency that pre-surrounds every Air-Force base, Drone control facility, Tank Depot, Naval Yard, and even the goddamn capital of the country. One that probably has moles or at least sympathetic individuals on the inside of any agency or base. One that probably controls the water, power, and food sources of said bases, yards and facilities. One that probably knows which family belongs to whichever government asshole that caps the first 'insurgent' kid in a raid.\n\nEven without the 2nd amendment, even if only 10% of the population stands up to fight, the government is in a bad place should they start some shit. With the 2nd? Sic Semper Tyrannis.\n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong, buy this guy is basically saying you need to have guns to keep the police in check. Yet, my understanding is that cops use the fact that anyone can carry a gun to justify their own escalation of force anytime someone doesn't follow their exact instructions. In fact, my brief research shows that your chances of being killed by a cop in America is more than 5 times greater than the next worse developed country, which is Canada, and more than 15 times higher than France, which is the next worse developed country after Canada for police killings.\n\nJust as an outside perspective from someone who doesn't have a right to guns, I don't actually think that anyone in power in America is afraid of the fact that Americans can own guns. It seems more like a very often repeated piece of propaganda from the gun lobby to get people to buy guns and to get politicians to pass favorable gun laws.\n\nYes but when you are protesting on the corner with 500 friends and they drop a bomb on your head from a drone...it doesn't matter if the tanks can occupy the street corners.\n\nPeople will stop assembling because they don't want to get blown up into pink mist.\n\nI say this as someone who supports a nearly unlimited 2nd amendment.\n\nThe stupidity annoys me, especially when it's with people who share the same opinion as me, but for different reasons...\n\nYour RIGHT to own firearms should not be infringed, but that doesn't mean you are going to do fuckall against the US military with all the small Aram weapons you can carry.\n\nThat tweet to me says\n\n\"Standing up to the government is pointless. They can mow you down without breaking a sweat.\"\n\nWhat I feel the worst about are the men and women that will have to carry out government orders of doing things like confiscating guns. There will definitely be a few gun owners who will refuse and would rather fight.\n\nHonestly, I used to think a nation wide gun confiscation would never happen. But now we have people being coerced into taking the vaccine, through things like their job held over their head if they dont take it. Or passports. I wouldnt be shocked at all if gun confiscation came soon.\n\nThis take is fucking stupid. A police state government wouldn't need to use its outsided power obliterate the entirety its own infrastructure to subjugate the people.\n\nGovernment agencies would be only as destructive as needed it root out and discourage dissidents, AND they would have the support of tons of government sympathizers.\n\nThe government sanctioned the Tulsa Massacre. they sactioned the Philadelphia Move Bombing. They sanctioned the assassination of various political activists etc.\n\nYour right to bear arms won't protect you from a government that wants to subjugate you or kill you for getting in the way of their plans to subjugate. And your ability to outnumber the boots on the ground is a function of whether those around you are sympathetic enough to your cause to want to get into fire fights.\n\nYour actual protection lies in the fact that those in the armed forces are not a monolith, and there likely wouldn't be enough loyalty to any leader who aimed for a complete police state.\n\nUnpopular opinion, but preparing to defend your family from a police state instead of working to make the US a country with principles and eradicate violence through education, healthcare, mental illness facilities, drug addiction rehabilitation programs, etc. is completely useless.\n\nI come from a shithole country, and not from someplace like Norway, but people over there are not armed to their teeth, their police don't hurt its own people, the government actually spends its taxes on their people and thus, when a mentally ill person there inevitably has violent impulses there are far, and I mean FAR less likely to take it out on someone else with a Fucking rifle than a fist fight, because of the unavailability of fire-arms and quite possibly the complete lack of knowledge on how to use one by a citizenry that does not need them.\n\nAnyways, I agree with most viewpoints on this sub, it's why I'm subbed, I just will never understand why would you need guns. We don't have them in my shit-hole country and it has only had one school shooting in its history.\n\nI believe people should be able to defend themselves.\n\nI also think the USA has a diverse society with an ignorant racist minority and an extremely high rate of mass shootings, and generally (not always) the shooter is a different ethnicity than their victims.\n\nSo gun ownership makes sense (revolver, semi-auto handgun, shotgun, etc), but tactical assault weapons for home defense doesn't make much sense.\n\nThe argument that you need the capacity for defense against a mass assault is 'action-movie logic' -- the police generally can overpower most groups.\n\nSo the obsession with gun ownership is probably more of a small penis thing, or a desire to be able to inflict mass casualties against \"them\", or too much FPS video games / action movies."
