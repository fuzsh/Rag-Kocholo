        "text": "Pretty soon, chatbot marketing is going to be like email. Everywhere. And one of the easiest ways to get started is by learning how to build a Facebook Messenger bot.\n\nWith over 1.3 billion monthly active users — a number that’s rising sharply due to Messenger for Instagram introduced in late 2020 — building marketing chatbots on Messenger is a cakewalk with Customers.ai’s chatbot builder and chatbot training courses.\n\nFirst adopters are calling Messenger bots their secret weapon as they get unprecedented ROI from 24/7 automated conversations and lead generation tools.\n\nReady to get started?\n\nHere’s how to build a chatbot for Facebook Messenger — the mobile app used by over a billion people — in under 5 minutes.\n\nPS – Learn my favorite Facebook Messenger hacks and get started fast with Facebook Messenger templates. Customers.ai has chatbot templates out of the box for multiple industries and use cases!\n\nWe’re going to create a “Monkey or Unicorn?” bot. Pick a door, any door! Will you get a monkey or a unicorn?\n\nGive the bot a spin yourself here!\n\nThe journey of our Monkey or Unicorn bot takes us through the web’s simplest free chatbot building workflow:\n\nCreate a dialogue\n\nAdd content with widgets\n\nAdd triggers\n\nTest your bot\n\nView a quick video tutorial of the chatbot builder here:\n\nStep 1: How to Create a Chatbot Dialogue\n\nIn the Bot Builder, go to Dialogues and then add a folder. Name your folder.\n\nFolders help you organize your bot messages. This bot is the dandy host of the Monkey or Unicorn game, so we name it as such:\n\nFrom within the folder, click on + Add Dialogue, and again, give it a name that tells you what it is. In this case, the Dialogue is the first of multiple Dialogues, so we could name it “Game Intro” or something similar.\n\nStep 2: Add Content with Widgets\n\nNext, you’ll be prompted to add your first chat widget to the Dialogue:\n\nCustomers.ai has a large selection of engaging chatbot widgets to choose from like:\n\nText\n\nVideo\n\nImages\n\nImage galleries\n\nMessenger opt-in\n\nAttachments and PDFs\n\nZapier Connections\n\nGIFs\n\nForms\n\nEmail notifications\n\nNavigation elements\n\nQuick Questions\n\nYou can use any combination of chat widgets to create the content of the chatbot Dialogue.\n\nLet’s use a Quick Question to start off the game.\n\nClick the widget you want to use, and in this case, type your question, pick from the Quick Question options: multiple choice, text field, and some other helpful contact info your bot can collect.\n\nOne cool thing about chatbot conversion elements like Quick Questions, Forms, and Attribute tools is that these widgets collect data to your Messenger contacts customer profile.\n\nObviously, this is awesome for saving audience data like:\n\nWays to get in touch\n\nHow they heard about you\n\nTheir budget\n\nSubscription status\n\nSignups\n\nA quick side note, multiple-choice options in Quick Question and Form widgets are awesome because:\n\nThey show up as interactive buttons in chat.\n\nButtons have minimal conversion friction.\n\nButtons can link to chat pages and website pages.\n\nButtons are so user friendly on mobile!\n\nWhen you enter the multiple-choice selections, you have the option of connecting that selection to another chatbot Dialogue from a drop-down.\n\nAdd a new Dialogue to your Folder. In this case, we added “Door 1.”\n\nFrom the drop-down, select the Dialogue you wish for your Messenger conversation to flow to. When you select the Dialogue, you’ll see that conversation path appear in the chatbot builder.\n\nIn this game, I’m connecting each choice, or door, to a Dialogue that reveals the unicorn or monkey hiding behind the door.\n\nWith 5 doors to choose from, there are 5 multiple-choice options, each connected to a Dialogue with a monkey or a unicorn GIF from the Giphy-powered widget!\n\nFor Doors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, click the GIF widget for the Dialogue. Then, start typing the word of whatever theme you’re looking for, and click to add it to the Dialogue:\n\nYou can add the text widget and more buttons that help keep the conversation going.\n\nThe “play again” button returns a player to the Game Intro chatbot page where they’re given the option of Doors 1 to 5 again!\n\nAnother CTA (call-to-action) lets users sign up for chatbot goodness themselves.\n\nAt this point, the bot works!\n\nYou can do a Send to Messenger Facebook ads campaign, or get a link to the chatbot landing page using the HTML element lead magnet:\n\nAnd you can set up the bot to trigger if a user says something…\n\nStep 3: Add Triggers for the Page\n\nQ&A Triggers are useful for assigning bots to your frequently asked questions.\n\nIf someone asks “directions” you can set up a bot that responds with the address and a link to a map.\n\nIf someone asks for “pricing” your bot answers back with pricing.\n\nThe FAQ answering possibilities are endless.\n\nYou can add Q&A triggers to your bot in two ways:\n\nWhen you’re in the page builder\n\nFrom Q&A in the bot builder\n\nTo add a trigger as you’re building the bot, select “Add Trigger” and type in the keyword:\n\nYou might add triggers like “pricing” or “directions” or “make an appointment” or any number of keywords to match your page to something a user is asking.\n\nAnother way add triggers to pages is by going to Q&A. Here you’ll see all your saved triggers and can add to and edit them:\n\nWhat you can do from here is:\n\nCreate a new trigger with “New Q&A”.\n\nCraft the bot’s reply to the trigger, either a chat page or text. Add multiple answers to give the bot free reign to choose from any of the answers.\n\nAdd triggers you type in or choose from the drop-down that populates the most frequent unanswered questions.\n\nSee the most common unanswered questions and assign them to chatbots, if you’d like.\n\nStep 4: Test the Bot\n\nBefore you launch, test the bot. You can do that by:\n\nTriggering the bot in Messenger using your keyword.\n\nClick “Test this Bot” from the chatbot content editor at any time!\n\nWhen viewed in Messenger, we see what this content experience looks like on mobile:\n\nCheck that all buttons work, look for broken connections or flow issues. If it’s a conversion element, check that attributes are saved to your contact.\n\nNow share and be merry!\n\nBy the way, did you get a monkey or unicorn?\n\nNext Steps: Build a Facebook Messenger Bot\n\nThe best way to learn chatbot marketing is to do it! It’s your turn to build a chatbot in under 5 minutes!\n\nHere’s one you’ll need: use a Quick Question to build a bot that collects a visitor’s email address.\n\nAfter that, you’ll be ready to start generating leads to your bot with lead magnets like comment guards, Messenger ads, and more.\n\nWhat are Messenger ads? Glad you asked!\n\nCustomers.ai has 8 powerful Facebook marketing lead magnets including Facebook Messenger ads that you can use right out of the box.\n\nSign up to get Customers.ai and let me know how it goes!\n\nHow to Build a Facebook Messenger Bot: Next Steps\n\nImportant next steps:\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n1.
