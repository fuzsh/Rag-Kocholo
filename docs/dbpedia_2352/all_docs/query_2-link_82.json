This puts us in a unique position to bridge today's and tomorrow‚Äôs solutions. To constantly seek clever and pragmatic ways to realise global energy ambitions and reach the next destination. And the next one after that. With years of expertise, we are proud to be at the forefront of both the conventional energy sector and the transition towards sustainable energy sources. üîπ Who we are: ‚Ä¢ Global provider in conventional and renewable energy services ‚Ä¢ A world leading EPCI supplier for the offshore wind sector ‚Ä¢ United team of 2,000 employees ‚Ä¢ International presence with branches in Denmark, Norway, UK, Germany, Poland, Singapore and the US üîπ What we do: ‚Ä¢ Safe and cost-efficient EPCI solutions for offshore and onshore ‚Ä¢ Service and maintenance supported by experienced and reliable manpower ‚Ä¢ End-to-end project management ‚Ä¢ Upgrades and environmentally responsible decommissioning Discover more about Semco Maritime: https://lnkd.in/emHPTmra #semcomaritime #changewithus #transitionalenergies #oilandgas #renewableenergy #offshorewind\n\nThis country never ceases to impress me üá©üá∞ ‚ù§Ô∏è Not only is it home to Semco Maritime‚Äôs HQ, but it appears to bask in glorious sunshine every time I travel. The countryside is stunning, and that‚Äôs where we were based for the past two days during our ‚ÄòDedicated Leaders‚Äô session at Skarrildhus hotel. Nature decided to put on a show the evening I arrived, with thunder and lightening like nothing I‚Äôve heard/seen before. Somehow I managed to capture the spider lightening (attached for your enjoyment)! As we grow our Aberdeen and U.K. business, it is vital that our DK and U.K. operations are intertwined with high levels of communication. This Leadership programme allows me to enhance leadership qualities whilst also ensuring that relationships with my Danish counterparts are strengthened across multiple divisions/departments. Now it‚Äôs time to return and put some of the theory into practise. Big thanks to everyone who I have had the chance to work with over the past few days, and of course to our event organisers. Proud to be part of such an excellent team in UK and DK. üôè\n\nLast week we had the pleasure of hosting clients, colleagues and friends at the Sausage and Cider festival in Aberdeen. Semco Maritime, Ponticelli UK & PBS by Ponticelli came together to celebrate at this unique event where we listened to performances by musicians throughout the day. As proud sponsors of Aberdeen‚Äôs West End FC and 2018‚Äôs team, we had the privilege of welcoming guests to the Joe Paterson Pavillion for exclusive access during the event. Events like these remind us of the importance of coming together, stepping back from the rush of life, and enjoying ourselves! Thank you to everyone who helped pull this event together. #SemcoMaritime #PBS #Ponticelli #Energy #WestEnd #Energy #Community #Festival David Craig Hutchinson Kate Burnett Benoit LAMOUSSIERE\n\nWe are on a journey of growth here in the UK, and this is bolstered by offering our decommissioning services to our UK clients and beyond. It is great to now be recognised as a new member of Decom Mission - they have helped us considerably in a short space of time. üöÄ If you would like to learn more, then please reach out to myself or Tonny Popescu.
