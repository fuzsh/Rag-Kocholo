Some may call it nature, natural or low intervention wine, others may say clean, naked or even pure wine.\n\nIf it’s up to us, we prefer NOT to label individual wines as anything. We would rather let the wine tell its own story and show the many different shades of personalities, without any prejudice or bigotry. However, for ease of communication, we have chosen to stick with low intervention.\n\nWe select and handpick wines we love, from importers that we respect and admire. Our importers work with small family wineries that spend most of their time in the vineyards, working alongside and within nature. Our selection of wines express their surroundings and heritage, in other words their ‘terroir’.\n\nWe strongly believe that it is important that the ecology and biodiversity of the land is respected and that the winemakers approach is adapted to their surroundings. Most of the winemakers we regard as friends — they’re the ones doing the hard work to ensure sustainable solutions for future generations and our part is to communicate their work.\n\nTo put it simply, we love to support and drink wine that has personality and intrigue. Artisanal wine with a minimal and low intervention approach in both the cellar and the vineyard. An honest product representing terroir, the grapes and the winemaker."
