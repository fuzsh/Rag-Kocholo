        "text": "Will Tesla Discount the Cybertruck? I love the Cybertruck, but when TV2 asked Cristian Grau, I hesitated calling it the savior of Tesla. Now, the numbers confirm my skepticism. Last year, Elon Musk claimed Tesla had 1 million pre-orders for the Cybertruck. Today, Tesla has sold just 16,000 units and has now opened up for general orders, with significant inventory on the ground. This can only mean, that all pre-orders have been delivered. Which leaves the question, where did the other 98% of go? At the current production rate, Tesla is manufacturing 65,000 Cybertrucks per year, aiming to close out the year with an annual capacity of 125,000 units. Tesla has previously stated that it targets a full annual capacity of 250,000 Cybertrucks, but that's a goal for next year. The big question is: Who will buy them? In Europe, the Cybertruck's weight classifies it as a heavy truck, requiring a special license and limiting it to a maximum speed of 80 km/h — a speed it can reach in just 2 seconds. In the U.S., pre-orders seem to have disappeared, likely due to price hikes from $49,000 to $99,000 for the dual motor edition and ongoing delivery delays. Meanwhile, competition in the market has only grown. With production and competition scaling up and demand dwindling, price cuts might be the only way to get these trucks moving. #tesla #cybertruck #emobility #elonmusk #ev\n\nConfessions of an EV Advocate and ex Tesla director ⚡ In 2009, I got behind the wheel of my first #Tesla #Roadster, and I’ve been cruising in Teslas ever since. I firmly believe that #emobility is a crucial part of combating the climate crisis. I’ve taken it upon myself to drive my EV rather than fly whenever possible, and I’m committed to keeping my car for as long as I can— to reduce embedded emissions and resource consumption. But lately, my self-proclaimed, I would say “chevalier” other may say hypocritical, status has been causing me some headaches. Sure, EV technology has come a long way since my first road trip in the Baltics, where I charged my Roadster at a leisurely 6 kW at McDonnell, gaining a whopping 160 km in 10 hours. Progress, right? But has the overall experience significantly improved in a world where charging stations seem to pop up on every second street corner? Not quite. As an experienced and well-trained EV driver, I still face mounting challenges and unnecessary delays caused by systemic incompatibilities during family road trips. It’s no wonder the average internal combustion engine (ICE) owner isn’t quite ready to make the transition. We have the technology to make the user experience flawless, yet here we are still, dealing with systemic hiccups. Like most lifestyle green washers enthusiasts, I’m also a hypocritical convenience consumer. Despite my EV commitment, I’ll happily hop on a plane for the next family holiday—because at the end of the day peace on the home front is the foundation of the conquering chevalier Buckle up, in the next posts I will share my most recent road trip experiences including riding a tow truck, broken chargers and a visit at a Tesla service center - the pièce de résistance. The Tesla service center - the place where dreams go to die. 🌍 😊🔌 ⚡\n\nOur story has been the most read for five consecutive days. Here’s how we did it: (Link in notes or swipe left below) Creating a compelling story requires more than just a professional photo, a relevant topic, and a well-timed pitch. The essence lies in storytelling with conflict, characters, and context—what’s at stake, and why should the audience care? It demands a dedicated team effort. Here are some key strategies: - Know Your Niche: Understand the media landscape of your industry and invest in building meaningful relationships. - Be Accessible: Availability is crucial. If you’re not present, you risk being forgotten. - Engage Effectively: Learn how to connect with journalists on their terms. Some prefer phone pitches, while others respond better to well-crafted emails. - Master the art of the elevator pitch. - Stay Relevant: Avoid vague future predictions. Use reputable, recent data to support your claims. Ditch the Self-Serving Surveys that serve marketing purposes rather than journalism. Authenticity is key. Rely on solid data for impact. - Share Authentic Stories: Journalists want real stories featuring CEOs and genuine comments from real people. - Fresh Perspectives: Media outlets won’t recycle stories from rivals. Bring original and unique insights to the table. - Use Plain Language: Communicate clearly and directly. You’re speaking to a broad audience, not just your colleagues. Be Respectful: You are not buying an ad, you are selling a story to objective media. Once you’ve submitted your pitch, it’s out of your control. Focus proofreading on the facts, not the presentation style. #communication #kommunikation #marketing #arkitektur #danskearkitekter #pr #strategi #prstrategi\n\nUPDATED VERSION Rivian Surges 50% in Pre-Market Trading: Here's Why! VW's commitment to invest up to $5 billion in a joint venture with Rivian has caused the stock jump. 🤝 Key Investment Details: 👉 The initial investment is a $1 billion loan in the form of a 4.75% convertible note – a debt that converts into stocks. 👉 Conversion: The first half converts to Rivian stocks at $10.83 per share, close to an all-time low. Following the news, Rivian is trading at $18 in the pre-market. 👉 The other half will convert when VW chooses to convert at a 45-day average trading price. Winners and Losers: VW: 👉 Investing at a very attractive price per share and earning a 4.75% interest. The remaining part will convert at market price. 👉 Dilution Impact: For context, Rivian sold shares at $78 per share during the IPO just three years ago. This deal results in about a 5% dilution just from half of VW's convertible note from the initial investment. If the remaining $4 billion investment follows this trend VW will acquire almost half of Rivian for just $5 billion. But more importantly, they get access to software. 👉 Boiled down what this part of the deal tells us is that the VW in-house software investment has failed. Rivian: 👉 Needed cash, PR boost, and a strategic investor. Short-Term Winner: Cash-strapped Rivian. Long-Term Winner: Software-incapable VW. Why This Matters: 👉 This investment illustrates the ongoing transformation within the automotive industry. And underlines BIG Auto’s failed strategy and incapability of designing EVs from the inside and out. Rewinding to 2009, both VW and Daimler had opportunities to invest in Tesla. Daimler seized the moment, investing $50 million—an investment that would later be hailed as one of their best investments ever 🚀 VW, however, took a different path. At an event in Wolfsburg, Tesla unveiled a converted and nearly production-ready VW Golf GTI that outshone VW's own EV project. Fearing competition, VW shut the door on Tesla 🚪 At that time, VW and Big Auto viewed electric vehicles as a niche market and weren't keen on competing against themselves in their core market. How times have changed! Better late than never.🌟 👉 👉 👉 I have never seen the official Tesla VW Golf GTI conversion.

We hear a lot about the \"unfair\" competition from China. But Western automakers aren't losing market share because of Chinese state subsidies. They're losing because of their delay strategies and blindness to customer demands. Let's not forget that the Western auto industry also receives massive government support. Since 2020, the EU has funneled EUR 30 billion into \"climate-friendly mobility.\" In 2008 GM and Chrysler were saved from bankruptcy with USD 18.4 billion favorable state loans. A USD 240 million government loan backed Tesla's scaling, not to mention zev-credits. While most Western automakers, Tesla being a notable exception, have focused on resisting change, minimum compliance, displaying a lack of social responsibility, and underestimating governments' willingness to enforce emission reductions, the Chinese went all-in on electric vehicles. Motivated by economic support and lower costs, Western automakers have taught the Chinese how to produce quality cars. In the process, China has become one of their most important markets. But like Europeans, the Chinese demand modern electric vehicles. Western automakers' failed strategies in their home markets have rendered them uncompetitive in China. Chinese manufacturers can now deliver EVs at lower prices and higher quality. The apprentice has become the master. The problem is twofold: Not only have Western automakers been overtaken technologically, but Chinese customers now prefer local brands. In the long run, producing in China won't make sense for Western automakers. And as long as they hide behind trade barriers, they become less and less relevant. #ev #mobility #automotive #bilbranchen #kommunikation #dkgreen"
