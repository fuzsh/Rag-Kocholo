If you’re planning a visit and come from afar it is always a good idea to check if we’re closed due unforeseen events.\n\nGIFT VOUCHERS\n\nIn a hurry or not sure what to get? We’re now able to e-mail gift vouchers for use in the studio shop. Please use the form at the bottom of the page or call. Delivery same day when ordered within the above open hours, otherwise next day.\n\nSHIPPING\n\nI run a physical studio shop, but I am happy to arrange delivery of my work worldwide. Please go to my Instagram (most photos) or Facebook and comment on the posts of any pieces you’re interested in and I’ll revert with availability and prices, or send me an e-mail through the form at the bottom of this page. I can also show you around the studio via FaceTime. If at all possible, please visit the studio during open hours. Everything I make is sold from the studio shop, although occasionally you’ll find my work in a gallery abroad. We giftwrap and enclose a handwritten card, if desired.\n\nVASES – POTS – BOWLS – TEALIGHTS and more\n\nI work somewhat at the edge of the functional, from thin to hysterically thin, straddling the fence between crafts and fine art. Everything I make, however, is intended for gentle use. My pieces are all very much everyday objects through which I aim to inject a little poetic lightness into the quotidian. The minimalistic and light idiom has a strong Scandinavian reference with an organic twist. I slab-build/hand-build each piece individually in a strong, ivory-coloured, translucent porcelain clay with a particular focus on the sculptural and textural properties of clay. Stock changes on a daily basis.\n\nYou’ll find me in the studio most weekdays all year round.\n\nMember of Danish Crafts and Design Association and on the Acceptance Committee of same.\n\nCOMMISSIONS\n\nRunning my studio, developing and producing my work is a full-time job. I only take on a commission if it’s a good fit for what I do and how I work. I created eight different serving objects for Restaurant Alchemist. The tissue dish (shown before firing) is one of the designs from this collab:"
