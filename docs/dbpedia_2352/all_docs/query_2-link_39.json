        "text": "Shopify Plus starts at 2.300 US$ per month on a 3-year term, or 2.500 US$ for a 1-year term, billed monthly.\n\nMore complex, higher volume businesses switch to a variable platform fee based on their revenue and business model. Get in touch with sales for more details.\n\nIf you don’t use Shopify Payments as your payment processor, a minimal transaction fee will be applied to each transaction to cover the charge for Shopify to maintain integrations with external payment providers.\n\nNo, you cannot run multiple brands in expansion stores. You will need a separate Shopify Plus contract for each brand. In other words, the same logo will be used across all expansion stores.\n\nExpansion stores are specifically localized clone stores of the same brand for the purpose of selling in different languages or currencies, or to wholesale customers. Read the Shopify Plus Terms for more details on expansion stores.\n\nIf you need an expansion store, contact the Shopify Plus Support team after upgrading.\n\nYou’ll get access to a team of merchant success managers as part of our merchant success program. This team is trained to guide you through a strategic framework designed to help you grow and scale your business at a pace that works for your brand. Specifically, you’ll get access to the following:\n\nRoadmap to success: Learn best practices and get actionable guidance in key business areas to create your own plan for growth.\n\nIndustry knowledge: Get exclusive access to valuable insights gathered through years of experience and hands-on work with thousands of brands across every industry.\n\nShopify Plus Community: Tap into a network of high-growth Shopify Plus brands to share tips, tricks, and resources to make the most out of the platform.\n\nShopify Plus Academy: Engage in interactive, on-demand courses that target your commerce expertise and support your growth.\n\nShopify Plus Priority Support: Get the top-tier support you need, fast. The Shopify Plus Priority Support team specializes in high-volume businesses and can answer your questions by phone, chat, or email.\n\nAfter you sign up, we'll upgrade your store to the Shopify Plus plan within 24 business hours. We’ll email you to let you know your upgrade is complete. You’ll also receive an introduction email with a link to join Jumpstart, our merchant onboarding program, along with contact details for the Shopify Plus Priority Support team.\n\nShopify Plus’ admin and exclusive tools are easy to use out of the box, which your staff should be able to manage without developer support. You can also customize your checkout with apps, or create your own custom app, which would require working with a developer.\n\nIf you don’t have an in-house development team, there’s an entire ecosystem of Shopify Plus Partners you can lean on to develop apps for your customizations.\n\nFull legal names usually end with a word or abbreviation* that identifies how your company was incorporated or registered** in your state, province, or country.\n\nTo find your legal business name, check formal documentation related to your business, or consult your accountant or legal counsel.\n\n*Examples include Inc., LLC, Ltd., Co., Corp., LP, LLP, GmbH, S.A., S.A. de C.V., B.V., N.V., SASU, LBN, A.G, S.A.S or SAS, S.p.A, S.p.o, SARL or S.A.R.L., ApS, AB, s.r.o, sp. z o.o, d.o.o., Ltda., S.R.L., A/S or AS, and Oy.\n\n**If you’re registered as Sole Proprietor, your business name may appear as “Jon Snow, a Sole Proprietor” or “Jon Snow, a Sole Proprietor dba The Crows.”"
