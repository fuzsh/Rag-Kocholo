We may reach out to you for this purpose if you are a member of a group or organization which concerns itself with these issues, an expert in the field or, a state authority which has granted its support to our activities, or, as the case may be, a school representative.\n\nThe sources of your personal data, including your contact information, other than the ones described below, may also include state authorities which have granted their support to our activities.\n\nProcessing of personal data during our live events is governed by our General Privacy Policy.\n\nHow We Disclose Your Personal Data\n\nWe only disclose your personal data within our group, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, as required by applicable law.\n\nIf we disclose your personal data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.\n\nService Providers\n\nWe may use contractors and service providers to process your personal data for the purposes described in this Business Partner Privacy Policy.\n\nSuch service providers may include in particular professional consultants (including for defense or exercise of our rights), and marketing, survey, analytics, or software suppliers.\n\nFor partners and business customers, these are our long-term partners and their tools which we use to process relevant personal data:\n\nFive9, Inc. for building contact center services;\n\nDigital River Inc. for payments processing;\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc. for customer relationship management; and\n\nMicrosoft and Google for office applications, document storage and application security.\n\nFurthermore, if you use one of our products, you can find relevant third-party tools listed under each product in our Products Policy.\n\nSometimes service providers, such as professional consultants, will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.\n\nPublic Authorities\n\nIn certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your personal data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law.\n\nNo personal data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:\n\nA subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;\n\nA legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and we or our officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process; or\n\nWhere such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructuring\n\nLike any other company, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your personal data to a related affiliate.\n\nIf we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable.\n\nCross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors\n\nWe are a global business that provides its products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all personal data we process.\n\nAt the same time, when we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.\n\nSituations where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA include provision of our products and services, third-party analytic tools and the provision of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section).\n\nHow Long We Store Your Personal Data\n\nWe will hold your personal data on our systems only for the minimum period required to achieve the purpose for which it is processed:\n\nIf we are bound by a contract, we store your data for its lifetime and longer, if required by law or for exercise or defense of legal claims.\n\nIf you contact our customer support, we will store our communication for 6 years and 6 months.\n\nIf you are our reseller or distributor or use one of our products, we process your personal data for the purpose of business intelligence for up to 50 months depending on which third-party tools we are using and what their minimum retention periods are. If you use one of our products, you can find specific retention periods listed under each product in our Products Policy.\n\nIf you provide us with your feedback, we will process such data for the period of 2 years after its submission.\n\nIf you are our customer, represent our customer or act as reseller/distributor, we may keep your contact details to send you offers during the existence of our relationship and up to 6 months after its termination. You can opt-out from such commercial communication anytime you want.\n\nLocation of Your Personal Data\n\nThe data we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as third-party servers in the Czech Republic, in the United States, as well as anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate.\n\nIn all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\n\nYour Privacy Rights\n\nYou have the right to information about whether and how we process your personal data, the right of access to your personal data, and the right to rectification and erasure of personal data or restriction of processing.
