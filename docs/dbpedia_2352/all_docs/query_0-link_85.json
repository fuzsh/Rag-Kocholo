Matched with happy colours and an eye for trend and fashion gives hummel the ever notorious statement.\n\nhummel is already very successfully operating in Japan and South Korea, and we are looking for strong strategic license partners in key strategic markets with the right market knowledge, skills and drive to team up with hummel International.\n\nOnce they said that bumblebees should not be able to fly but the fact of the matter is, however, that bumblebees do fly as does that quirky Danish sports brand from 1923 – higher and more agile than ever before.\n\nWhat started out as a two-men business in Eppendorf, Germany has in 89 years grown to become a multinational corporation with activities in more than 35 countries across the world.\n\nFor further information – please contact:"
