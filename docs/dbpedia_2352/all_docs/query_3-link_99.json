        "text": "This report presents the findings from a study comparing technical measures and policy instruments for enhancing land-based climate mitigation in three Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The overarching aim of the project is to synthesize existing knowledge concerning how enhanced sequestration and reduced emissions of carbon in forest, agricultural areas and wetlands can contribute to climate policy. The study focuses on the Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, and provides an overview of a selection of measures and policy instruments currently used in the three countries, and assesses whether there is additional potential for increasing the use of these measures. In addition, we identify potential new policy instruments, not yet applied in the Nordic context, which can be relevant to include in future climate mitigation strategies.\n\nPolicy instruments are designed with an ultimate goal to encourage activities, such as the adoption of land-use and/or management practices that result in either net carbon sequestration or net carbon emission reduction, within the LULUCF sector. The report contains a brief introduction to policy instrument typology, and reviews factors which are important to consider when evaluating the potential of a new policy instrument. This review highlights the importance of ensuring the additionality, permanence of initiatives, and avoidance of leakage. Failure to address these factors implies that the actual, net climate effect will be less than anticipated. Similarly, the importance of paying due respect to transaction costs is emphasized, as it is important to ensure that the total cost does not end up exceeding total benefits. Risks related to the unpredictability of nature and climate, and to instrument design are also discussed. Furthermore, the importance and complexity of addressing risk is made evident. Finally, the review also highlights the potential benefits associated with designing policy instruments that take into account possible synergies between different policy goals, and the benefits that may be associated with instruments that address heterogeneity of costs and effects across space and time, and across different actors/landowners. Thus, adopting a long-term perspective, and acknowledging heterogeneity, it may be possible to increase the overall cost efficiency of a policy instrument.\n\nTo date, a range of land based measures, generating beneficial effects on carbon sequestration or emission reduction, do exist and are being implemented in the Nordic countries, albeit the degree of implementation varies across the countries. These measures include for example initiatives related to reducing emissions from organic soils (e.g. termination of crop production on organic soils), energy crop cultivation, afforestation, and management of existing forests. However, the present review reveals that it is only for a minor subset of the measures that the implementation is explicitly targeted at climate mitigation. This indicates scope for further exploiting the potential of cost-effective land based measures for climate mitigation in the Nordic region. For most measures, the potential positive effect in terms of climate impact is acknowledged as a secondary effect, but it seems that the focus on climate impact is increasing. Thus, there already seems to be a widespread recognition of the fact that the adoption of a more holistic perspective may increase the cost efficiency of environmental and climate regulation.\n\nThe review suggests that the use of all implemented measures but one, namely reduced tillage, could be increased to enhance carbon sequestration and/or reduce GHG emissions from the LULUCF sector. For the measure set-aside of agricultural land it may however be noted that the relative desirability of the measure in terms of climate mitigation to some extent is limited by the fact that the effect is only temporary. The magnitude of the climate effect varies significantly across measures, but the effect of a given measure is also in many cases seen to vary significantly depending on where and how the measure is implemented. The two measures with the largest effects are withdrawal of organic soils from agricultural production and measures for GHG reduction in cultivated peatland. The effects of the other reviewed measures are significantly lower. This could suggest that they are less relevant, but this need not be the case as the measures could be cost-efficient in some locations but not in others. All else equal, costs will be higher for measures involving withdrawal of land from production than for less invasive measures. Accordingly, less effective measures, which allow production to continue, may be the best option in areas where the land production value is high, while measures requiring withdrawal of land from production may primarily be relevant in areas where the land production value is low.\n\nOverall there does not seem to be very much variation in terms of policy instruments underlying the implementation of existing land based measures. The policy instruments are predominantly subsidies and regulation (command and control), although voluntary implementation is also seen for some of the measures. Thus, there seems to be ample scope for expanding the policy instrument portfolio, thereby potentially increasing the cost effectiveness of land-based climate mitigation.\n\nFive potentially relevant new policy instruments are identified and discussed; common for all is that they are economic instruments, which have the potential to contribute to the cost efficiency of climate mitigation. Also common for all is that there are significant challenges, especially in relation to verification and monitoring (e.g., of the magnitude of the sequestration or emission reduction effects), that need to be overcome before the instruments can be implemented in practice.\n\nOne set of potentially relevant instruments focus on carbon sequestration through forest management, which has been considered a low-cost mitigation option. Both tax/subsidy schemes and carbon rent schemes have been discussed in the literature as policy instruments to incentivize forest owners to increase carbon sequestration in their forests. Existing modelling studies indicate that forest owners’ harvest decisions, and hence the carbon sequestration effects, are identical under both types of instruments and the magnitude of the effects increase with increasing carbon prices. In implementing the instruments, it is important to define a baseline in order to pay forest owners only for additional carbon sequestration. Also, it is equally important to implement incentive mechanisms internationally in order to prevent carbon leakage resulting from increased imports when the instrument is only binding unilaterally in one or a few countries.\n\nAnother instrument relates to the creation of markets for land-based carbon sequestration. At present, LULUCF is not included under EU ETS and given the various challenges such as the risk of impermanence, the incorporation of LULUCF into EU ETS in the near future seems to be less probable. An alternative solution is to develop a system specifically designed for trading carbon sequestered from the LULUCF sector. Although the performance of such schemes has not yet been analysed empirically for the EU, one can note that the establishment of a trading scheme would create incentives for land-based carbon sequestration activities and could potentially increase the overall efficiency of climate mitigation, while challenges related to uncertainty, reversibility and high transaction costs need to be addressed. Their realization will require close collaborations not only between the Nordic countries but also with other EU countries. In the meantime, trading can still take place following the EU flexibility rules which allow Member States to buy and sell net LULUCF carbon removals. However, detailed guidance and examples of how this kind of trading takes place in practice remains lacking.\n\nMost of existing instruments are predominantly practice-based. In situations with information asymmetries regarding the likely effects of the practice, it may however be more efficient to employ result-based instruments where results in this context refer to the expected sequestration and/or emission reduction effects. There are several examples of result-based instruments being used in practice (e.g. Peatland Code in the UK, Carbon labelling/certification in France), and important advantages of the approach are that it provides flexibility and incentivizes innovation. Also, land-use contracts using reverse auctions could offer incentives that are based on results/performances. It has been used in other countries (e.g., Australia, UK), and important advantages of the approach are that it has the potential to both minimize transaction costs and capture spatial heterogeneity. The result-based instruments and the reverse auction contracts form policy instruments that potentially can be implemented by the government and are applicable to a wide range of measures including afforestation and wetland management. These types of economic instruments are expected to be cost effective although no empirical studies on their cost-effectiveness are available to date.\n\nThere are also potential economic instruments where the demand for governments’ direct contribution or intervention would be less intensive. For example, tailored private insurance schemes, provided through market mechanisms, can provide a potentially relevant new mechanism that may serve to stimulate the adoption of climate smart agricultural practices. The idea is that insurance may provide an economic incentive to engage in climate friendly practices that might otherwise be considered too risky. Government support to help establish the market for this type of insurance may be necessary for example through contribution towards insurance premiums. Another market driven instrument can be activated through a link between actors across a supply chain of land-based productions for example through retailers providing economic incentive for farmers to adopt soil conservation measures which in turn contribute to enhancement of agricultural soil carbon sinks.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of land-based measures that is intentionally driven by climate mitigation objectives and the policy instruments to incentivize such implementations in the Nordic countries appear to be limited. This suggests a considerable potential for further enhancement of carbon sequestration and emission reduction from the land-based sector in the Nordic region. In the same vein, there is a wide range of alternative economic policy instruments that can potentially be deployed by the government. While some instruments are based on insights from analytical models (e.g., carbon rent and subsidy/tax combination as two potential instruments for existing forests), others have actually been implemented outside the Nordic region (e.g., performance based schemes and land use contracts based on reverse auction mechanism). Furthermore, studies and implementations from elsewhere offer insights regarding strategies to address key challenges that affect the efficiency of land-based carbon sequestration/emission reduction. For example, risk of impermanence can be addressed by setting a long-term project duration, conducting regular monitoring and verification, and imposing a risk buffer (reserving a percentage of eligible carbon credits to buffer any deviation from the anticipated sequestration/emission reduction). Nevertheless, other aspects remain understudied, for example, synergies and trade-offs with other environmental/societal objectives (such as food production, biodiversity, etc) resulting from the actual implementation of the different economic policy instruments. An overview of land managers/owners’ likely responses to the different economic instruments, which in turn affect the uptake of schemes and hence the cost-effectiveness, is also currently lacking. This highlights opportunities for follow up research to support the goal to incentivize and augment climate mitigation in the LULUCF sector in the Nordic region.\n\n1.3. EU policy framework for land-based climate mitigation\n\nThe EU 2030 climate policy framework consists of 3 pillars; the Emissions Trading System (ETS) regulating emissions from energy intensive industries, the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) applying to most sectors not covered by the ETS, and the LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forest) Regulation (Romppanen, 2020). Intuitively, the latter is of utmost relevance to the scope of the present report. Together the three pillars are expected to contribute to the EU GHG emission reduction target, which was previously set to 40% reduction relative to 1990 level. In September last year, as part of the European Green Deal, EU leaders agreed to increase the target to a minimum of 55% by 2030. As to how each of the three pillars will play a role within the framework of the new target, will be elaborated by the EU Commission by June 2021​https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en.\n\nIn May 2018, the European Union issued Regulation (EU) 2018/841 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework. This LULUCF Regulation concerns carbon pools in: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon, and harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land. Thus, in contrast to previous EU law, where emissions from use of biomass in energy production were not accounted, the LULUCF Regulation does include biomass for energy production (https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/forests/lulucf_en).\n\nAt present, no specific reduction target is set for the LULUCF sector. Instead, the LULUCF regulation relies on a ‘no debit rule’, according to which, EU Member States, Iceland and Norway are required to ensure that accounted LULUCF emissions do not exceed LULUCF removals in the period 2021 to 2030. In relation to the ‘no debit rule’ it is noted that the assessment of emissions from the LULUCF sector is based on different accounting principles depending on land-use category and type of land-use change. While a net-net accounting approach is used for agricultural land (Cropland, Grassland and Wetlands), a gross-net approach is used for deforestation and afforestation, and for forest management, a Forest reference Level (FRL) approach is used. The specifics of the different accounting approaches imply that the ‘no debit rule’ is not equivalent to a requirement that net annual emissions from the LULUCF sector must be either zero or negative. To illustrate this, the net-net accounting principle means that if a country experiences a net loss in the base year (BY) and the same loss in the accounting year then it will not be penalized. If the same loss in the BY had been changed to a slightly lower loss, then the difference would be accounted for as a credit as the country has done something to minimize the loss. The opposite also applies; if a country has a net sink in the BY for having done something in the BY, then the country in a way is obliged to continue with the same sink in the accounting period (2021‒-2030) by doing something extra to avoid a penalty in the accounting period.\n\nLooking at the EU as a whole, the LULUCF sector has been a relatively stable net sink of GHG, but looking at specific countries there is significant variation. For Denmark, the LULUCF sector is a net source of GHG emissions, mainly due to a large area with drained organic agricultural soils, which have a large emission per area. However, there seems to be an overall trend that the deficit is gradually reduced due to less drained organic soils and an increasing sink in the Danish forests. For Sweden and Finland, on the other hand, the LULUCF sector is a net-sink, and in both countries, forests represent the dominant sink. (CRF, Table 10s1, Denmark (25 May 2020), Finland (15 April 2020), Sweden (14 April 2020); downloaded from: https://unfccc.int/ghg-inventories-annex-i-parties/2020).\n\nThere are interlinkages between different sectors/pillars (Romppanen, 2020). Thus, within certain limits it is possible to balance emissions across different land categories, just as LULUCF credits can be used to offset emissions under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) if the LULUCF sector produces accounted net removals. The degree to which emissions reductions within the LULUCF sector can be used to fulfil the reduction obligations under the Effort Sharing Regulation differs across countries. For Denmark the maximum is set to 14.6 million tonne total for the period 2021 to 2030 while for Sweden and Finland the amounts are 4.9 and 4.5 million tonnes, respectively (European Parliament, 2018). Moreover, it is also possible to transfer credits from a member state to another. Furthermore, surpluses from ESR can be used to compensate debts in LULUCF.\n\nA GIS overlay between the most recent map of Danish organic soils and agricultural fields reported by the Danish farmers to the Danish Agricultural Agency shows that approximately 171,000 hectares of organic soils (> 6 % organic carbon) are cultivated. However, the actual potential of the measure is likely to be less than the total area (Olesen et al., 2018). Some of the areas are used for producing high value crops (e.g. carrots and potatoes) and implementing the measure in such areas is likely to be prohibitively costly. Besides, in many cases rewetting of the organic soils on one spot will affect the surrounding agricultural fields and make them too wet for crop growing too. Consequently, the cost of setting aside organic soils may increase to compensate for the effect on the mineral soils.\n\nIn Sweden, organic soils are predominantly found on Wetlands (7.4 million ha), Forest land (4.1 million ha) and Cropland (0.1 million ha). The latest National Inventory Report for Sweden highlighted that drained organic soils on Forest land and Cropland were the primary emitters within the LULUCF sector (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). Forest land and Cropland respectively account for 85% and 11% of the total 1.2 million ha drained organic soils in Sweden.\n\nAccording to a review by Kløve et al. (2017), management options to reduce emissions from drained, cultivated peat soils in the Nordic region are varied, including rewetting, which may prove infeasible in some areas due to for example landscape topography. Furthermore, Kløve et al. (2017) suggest that the selection of best management options should consider both local environmental characteristics and socio-economic needs.\n\nSince 1990, the Swedish state has financed the rewetting of drained organic soil. Between 1990 and 2019, approximately 150 ha of drained organic soils on Forest land have been rewetted, which contributed to an accumulated emission reduction of approximately 9.5 kton for the 20-year period. However, the actual figure may be much largerSee: https://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/sa-mar-miljon/statistik-a-till-o/vaxthusgaser/vaxthusgaser-utslapp-fran-markanvandning/sweden_LULUCF_art10.pdfhttps://www.naturvardsverket.se/upload/sa-mar-miljon/statistik-a-till-o/vaxthusgaser/vaxthusgaser-utslapp-fran-markanvandning/sweden_LULUCF_art10.pdf.\n\nRestoring wetland on agricultural organic land will also affect the surrounding land. As a result, it is suggested that the measure can lead to the removal of an equal amount of arable land on mineral soil from production (Jordbruksverket, 2012), resulting in a total loss of arable land area up to twice the size of the reestablished wetland. It could also be noted that Sweden may target abandoned agricultural lands to reduce emissions from drained organic soils (Ministry of the Environment, 2020).\n\nIn Denmark, a scheme called “Lavbundsordningen” (Organic soils scheme) has been put in place by the government, in order to support the implementation of the measure. The scheme is part of the EU Rural Development programme and offers a subsidy to cover expenses related to feasibility studies and actual implementation, and farmers can be compensated for income reductions due to termination of agricultural production. Data pertaining to the Organic soils scheme show that in the period of 2015–2019 the measure has been implemented (or is under implementation) on a total area of 1,296 ha. The total costs amount to 177.8 mDKK corresponding to 137,149 DKK/ha, of which 15% refers to feasibility study costs, while the remaining 85% represent implementation related costs. The implementation related costs include expenses for 20 years retainment, purchase/sale of land, land distribution and actual construction costs. On the land, all existing drainage systems are removed to increase the water level and an easement is laid down that the land must not be cultivated, drained, fertilized or receive pesticide applications in the future. If possible, grazing and collecting of hay is allowed. A minimum reduction of 13 ton CO2-eq/ha must be obtained to be included in the scheme. Construction costs comprise around 20% of implementation related costs.\n\nIn addition to the “Lavbundsordningen”, in the Finance Act 2019, a political agreement has been reached, allocating a total of 2.6 bn DKK for the period 2020–2029 to the withdrawal of organic soils from agricultural production, the purpose being to create climate-friendly natureSee: https://fvm.dk/nyheder/nyhed/nyhed/600-mio-kroner-skal-over-tre-aar-forvandle-marker-til-natur-med-klimaeffekt/. Of the total budget, 600 mDKK is to be spent in the period 2020‒2022, and approximately 42 % of the funds are to be used for a new national subsidy scheme, while 55 % will be allocated to projects to be undertaken by the Danish Nature Agency. The remaining 3 % are allocated to building the knowledge base regarding the measure. In total, the agreement is expected to lead to withdrawal of 15,000 ha of organic soils, and in 2030 the effect is estimated to be 0.27 mio. tonnes CO2-eq. The scheme is a voluntary scheme, directed at private landowners, municipalities as well as foundations, and offers a one-time compensation for withdrawal of land from agricultural production. The first 3 years are considered a trial period, and the more specific details of the future scheme is to be decided before 2023, drawing on the experiences from the trial period and thereby ensuring the efficiency of the scheme. Moreover, in the Finance Act 2021, further 660 mDKK are allocated to withdrawal of organic soils from agricultural production in the period 2021–2024See: Aftale om finansloven for 2021 og aftale om stimuli og grøn genopretning (fm.dk). This new funding is expected to lead to rewetting of further 5,000 ha of agricultural land with an estimated area of organic soils of 3,000 ha, and the estimated effect is 75,000 tonnes of CO2-eq in 2030.\n\nIn Sweden, Jordbruksverket (2012) discusses agri-environmental support as a policy instrument for restoration of wetland on organic land. The measure would carry an investment cost of SEK 150,000 per hectare of wetland and a maintenance cost of SEK 4,500 per hectare per year during the (assumed) time of maintenance, 20 years. There is also a cost to the landowner because wetlands cannot be used for cultivation. This cost is related to the opportunity cost of land. Jordbruksverket (2012) calculates this cost as the contribution margin for cereal crops, discounted over a 20-year period, resulting in a present cost of SEK 2,500 per hectare. Farmers would have to obtain a compensation covering all of these costs. Together, the measure would entail a cost of SEK 5,100 per tonne of CO2-eq. Jordbruksverket (2012) suggests locating such wetlands with an aim to simultaneously increase biodiversity. Details in the design of the instrument are not discussed. A more recent report suggests that the potential to reduce emissions through rewetting differs widely across different organogenic soils, and re-wetting of drained peatland seems comparatively more cost-effective. In that case, the private economic cost is estimated at approximately SEK 4,000 per tonne of CO2-equivalent (Rabinowicz & Jörgensen, 2021).\n\nIn Finland, measures to reduce GHG emissions from peatland fields (i.e. cultivated peatlands) have been identified: reducing tillage, increasing vegetation cover, keeping organic matter below water level through controlled subsurface drainage, avoiding new clearing of peatlands, and converting low-yield fields to paludiculture, wetland, forests or leaving them abandoned (Kärkkäinen et al. 2019, Lehtonen et al. 2020). Emission factors for peatland fields under different uses are presented in Figure 3.1. As the emission factors are highest for cultivation of annual and perennial crops, emissions can be reduced through land use conversion especially to paludiculture and restoration. In the final report of ILMAVA project on measures to mitigate climate change in the land use sector (Lehtonen et al., 2021), the emission impacts are evaluated for land use changes for areas of 10, 000 and 50,000 ha. For 50,000 ha, converting land from annual crops to other uses would reduce the total emissions of 8,4 Mt CO2-eq. by 6–19 %, from perennial grasslands to other uses by 6‒13 % and from abandoned land to uses with lower emissions coefficients by 0–8 %.\n\n3.2. Energy crops\n\nEnergy crops as a measure to increase soil carbon involves the conversion from conventional crop production to production of perennial crops such as willow and poplar. The increase in soil C following conversion primarily occurs in the top 10 cm of the soil. Thus, Georgiadis et al. (2017) find that there is a significant difference in soil C content between soils under short-rotation woody crops such as willow and poplar and soils under cropland when looking at the top 25 cm (the plough layer). Looking at the 0‒100 cm layer, however, they do not find any overall differences in the C content of soils under cropland and soils under short-rotation woody crops.\n\nIn addition to affecting soil carbon sequestration, the conversion also affects GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in other respects; through changes in the level of N-fertilization, ammonia emissions, N-leaching, and fossil fuel use in agricultural machinery (Olesen et al., 2018). Extending the scope beyond the agricultural sector, production of energy crops may also entail significant reductions in GHG emissions from the energy production sector. The magnitude of this substitution effect depends on which fuel is substituted, but it is suggested to be much greater than the effect from carbon sequestrationSee e.g.: https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/eccp/second/docs/finalreport_agricsoils_en.pdf.\n\nBased on a number of generalised assumptions Olesen et al. (2018) estimates the total average GHG effect within the agricultural sector of converting from single year crops to perennial energy crops, such as willow or poplar, to be 1,376 kg CO2-eq/ha/year, of which 660 kg CO2-eq/ha/year can be attributed to increases in soil C.\n\nEnergy crops are already grown in Denmark; in 2019 the area with willow was approximately 4,900 ha, and in addition to this there was 3,300 ha with poplar. Olesen et al. (2018) suggest that there is a potential for increasing the area with energy crops by 100,000 ha by 2030. However, the realization of the suggested potential does not seem realistic considering the rather small area at present. In a recent report from the Danish Climate Council (Klimarådet, 2020) a more realistic scenario of 25,000 ha is used; this potential is assessed with reference to an overall scenario, where 100,000 of agricultural land is taken out of rotation. Of these 100,000 ha, 25 % is used for energy crops, and another 25 % is used for permanent grass, while the remaining 50 % is allocated to afforestation.\n\nEnergy crops are also grown in Sweden; in 2019 the area with poplar and willow was about 8,700 ha (SCB, 2019), but there is suggested to be a potential for increasing the area grown with energy crops. Meanwhile, in Finland, the area of green grass canary covers 3.000 ha with a decreasing trend. The national peat company VAPO established a program with farmers to produce green grass canary for energy production in the early 2000’s. Due to the technical problems and low energy density, green grass canary could not compete with peat and wood-based fuels. New contracts were not established after 2011 and the last contracts were terminated by 2016. In a more ambitious scenario (WAM2) of Climate road map for agriculture (Lehtonen et al., 2020), cultivation of green grass canary in peatlands is suggested as one option to reduce emissions. Green grass canary could be used as litter although the markets should be developed.\n\nThere are currently no policy instruments in Denmark specifically targeted at increasing the production of energy crops. However, energy crops can be used to fulfill the Environmental Focus Area requirement, and as an alternative to the requirements for mandatory catch crops and catch crop requirements related to the use of organic fertiliser, which needs to be met in order for farmers to be eligible to receive agricultural support. Thus, in a sense, production of energy crops may be seen as being subsidized, although in a quite indirect way, and not in a way that rewards farmers for producing energy crops but rather in a way that allows farmers to avoid being penalized (i.e. loosing support). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Environmental Focus Area and catch crop requirements are imposed with a view to protect and improve biodiversityhttps://lbst.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/NaturErhverv/Filer/Tilskud/Arealtilskud/Direkte_stoette_-_grundbetaling_mm/2020/Vejledning_om_groen_stoette_2020.pdf and protect the environment, but not with a view to enhancing soil C sequestration. Previously farmers could apply for a subsidy for producing energy crops, but this subsidy scheme has been discontinued, and currently farmers lack economic incentive to engage in the production of energy crops such as willow and poplar​See: Landbrugsavisen, 11. Maj 2019; https://landbrugsavisen.dk/avis/energiafgrøder-parkerer-kulstof-i-jorden.\n\nIn Sweden farmers can get a subsidy for planting and fencing when planting energy crops on farmland. Also, energy crop cultivation is eligible for farm support, thus giving equal status to energy crops and conventional agricultural crops.\n\n3.3. Afforestation and reduced deforestation\n\nAfforestation is often mentioned as an important measure to mitigate climate change. The effect of forests in terms of GHG emissions varies depending on many factors, one of the most important being the way the forest is managed.\n\nFelby et al. (2018) discuss the GHG effect of untouched forests versus production forest and find that production forests are preferable from a climate perspective. While the net annual GHG effect of untouched forests is zero in the long runThere is an upper limit to how much C can be stored in forests, and when this limit is reached, an equilibrium will occur, where the decay of the trees will be equal to their growth., the net effect of production forest can be positive both in the short and in the long run. The net effect of a given forest area, however, will vary over the life of the forest. Under optimal conditions, the maximum amount of C stored in one hectare of Danish forest is equivalent to approximately 1,510 tonnes of CO2 and of these 840 tonnes are stored in the trees while 670 tonnes are stored in dead wood, decaying plant material and in the soil (Felby et al., 2018). In this regard, it is important to note, that while the net annual GHG effect of untouched forest will be zero in the long run, this does not mean that the climate effect is zero. Thus, the large amount of carbon stored in the forest implies that the forest represents significant value due to its carbon storage capacity.\n\nJohansen et al. (2019) discuss the effect of afforestation on soil organic carbon. Based on comparisons of soil inventories in cropland and forests, and assuming a transition period of 100 years, afforestation is estimated to lead to an increase in soil organic carbon of 0.21ton C/ha/year. The estimate, however, is not deemed sufficiently representative and documented to be included in the FRL (Forest Reference Level). For forests remaining forests evidence suggests that there will be no significant change in soil organic carbon; this suggests that reforestation will not entail increases in soil C. For comparison, estimates of carbon sequestration following afforestation of agricultural land presented in Klimarådet (2020) suggests that the climate effect of afforestation is 4.1 tonnes CO2-eq/ha/year, and it is noted that the effect can potentially be increased through targeted management.\n\nAt present, approximately 14.8 % of Denmark is covered by forest, but the long-term goal is that somewhere between 20 and 25% of Denmark should be covered by forest landscapesIt should be noted that forests and forest landscapes are not synonymous terms; forest landscape is a more inclusive term, also including more open areas of the forest and the border between forests and the open land (Miljø- og Fødevareministeriet, 2018:14). by the end of the 21st century. As significant increases in the forest area are already planned, the additional potential for using afforestation as a measure to reduce GHG emissions is likely to be limited, as land is a scarce resource. However, with reference to the planned increase in forest area, future reductions in GHG reductions through afforestation can be expected. How large the forest related reductions will be is dependent on where the forest is planted, the type of forest (i.e. choice of tree species) and how it is managed. This emphasizes the relevance of adopting a broad and holistic perspective when designing policies rather than focusing narrowly on a single issue. By considering e.g. climate, biodiversity and N-leaching jointly, and explicitly considering spatial differences between different areas (e.g. in terms of N-leaching risk, biodiversity hotspots and suitability for forest production) it may be possible to optimize the sum of environmental benefits compared to a situation where the focus is on one goal, and where other effects are just considered as side-effects.\n\nIn both Sweden and Finland, the share of land covered by forest is significantly higher than in Denmark; in Sweden it is approximately 62 % while it is 65 % in Finland. Still, there may be potential for increasing the forested area through afforestation.\n\nIn Denmark, there are two subsidies directed at forests; one is a subsidy for afforestation on private land, the other is a subsidy for setting forest areas aside as “untouched forest”. None of the subsidies are motivated by climate, but as both initiatives may have an impact on the soil carbon, they are nevertheless considered relevant to mention here.\n\nThe subsidy for afforestation on private land is targeted at reducing N-leaching in order to fulfil the targets specified in the Water Framework Directive, but is likely to have an additional positive effect on carbon sequestration. The subsidy for untouched forest is to support biodiversity; the effect of this initiative on soil carbon is less certain, thus compared to production forest it may serve to reduce the long-term climate reduction potential of the forest. It may be noted that not all afforestation initiatives are subsidized; accordingly, an analysis of afforestation initiatives in the period 1990‒-2012 revealed that 70% of the afforestation had not been subsidized. The advantage of not applying for subsidy is, that it then – in most cases – is possible to avoid forest reserve restrictions; such restrictions imply that once the forest has been established the area has to remain forest forever. In this connection it may be noted that around 85 % of Danish forests are subjected forest reserve restrictions (in Danish “Fredskovspligt”) preventing deforestation and ensuring that forests are managed sustainably, as defined in the Danish Forestry Act. The forest reserve restrictions were introduced almost 200 years ago with the purpose of ensuring future timber supplySee: https://naturenidanmark.lex.dk/Danmarks_skove and https://mst.dk/erhverv/skovbrug/fredskovspligten-og-tilsyn/.\n\nIn addition to the afforestation subsidy, the Danish Government has launched a new initiative, a Climate Forest FundSee: https://kefm.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/2020/sep/danskernes-klima-skovfond-vil-nedbringe-co2-og-give-mere-natur. The primary purpose of the fund is to promote afforestation and withdrawal of organic soils from rotation but the focus is also on synergies related to e.g. the water environment and biodiversity. The bill was passed in December 2020See: https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2020/2186, and the fund is expected to be operational by the end of 2020. The fund is granted a starting capital of 100 mio. DKK, while future financing is expected to come from donations/investments from private individuals and businesses, who in turn receive a number of CO2-certificates, which can be used in e.g. businesses’ voluntary climate accounts and in reports to e.g. Carbon Disclosure Project. The certificates cannot, however, be exchanged for EU ETS quotas.\n\nIn Finland, enhancing afforestation is included as a climate measure for the LULUCF sector in government programme. The Act on Temporary Support for Afforestation is scheduled to enter into force at the beginning of 2021, and subsidy could be applied for from the Forest Center from the beginning of March 2021. Subsidy is granted for afforestation of wasteland/abandoned land, such as set-aside areas and former peat production areas. Areas under active farming are not to be afforested under the subsidy, so the aid would be conditional on no agricultural subsidies being granted to the arable sector after 2019. When granting the subsidy, biodiversity, the rural landscape, water management and planning constraints are also considered.\n\nAfforestation subsidy would be granted to private landowners. The subsidyhttps://mmm.fi/metsat/metsatalous/metsat-ja-ilmastonmuutos/joutoalueiden-metsitys would consist of a flat-rate compensation as well as a management fee, each based on an average calculated cost per hectare. It is proposed that if forest is established on agricultural land, subsidy would be 2000 € per hectare for peatland and 1500 € for mineral soil. In the case of peat production land, the subsidy would be 1500 € per hectare if afforestation is performed as planting and 1000 € in the case of seedling. The management fee is proposed to be 900 € per hectare, paid in the second and eighth year after afforestation. The subsidy is conditional on no previous funding for afforestation of the same sector. The aim is to create a permanent forest area, so afforestation support would not be granted for growing willow or Christmas trees, for example. The obligation to maintain the afforested area and the obligation to preserve it as forest land would last for ten years.\n\nThe potential area of wasteland to be afforested was estimated at about 118,000 hectares, according to the assessment using spatial data by Tapio Oy, a Finnish company that offers advisory and consulting services related to forest management. The potential areas are mainly located in northern part of Finland.\n\nThe impact of the afforestation subsidy on GHG emissions was assessed by Natural Resources Institute (Luke)​https://mmm.fi/metsat/metsatalous/metsat-ja-ilmastonmuutos/joutoalueiden-metsitys. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from afforestation compared to previous land-use emissions is based on the increase in carbon sequestration by growing stands, reduction in emissions from soil and increase in soil carbon stock. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions caused by afforestation varies notably (3.8-17.1 tonnes CO2 eq./ha/yr) depending on the previous land use, land type, tree species and time period after afforestation. The largest climate benefit would be achieved by afforesting peatland-based fields and former peat production areas due to the reduction of emissions from soil. Afforestation of former agricultural land in mineral soil increases carbon sequestration by an average of 3.8 tonnes of CO2 eq./ha/yr compared to initial land use during the first 15 years. Afforestation of former agricultural production in peatland reduces emissions by 9.8 tonnes of CO2 eq./ha/yr and afforestation of former peat production land by 7.8 tonnes of CO2 eq./ha/yr over the corresponding period.The option to apply afforestation should be compared with the alternative of rewetting the land, as one cannot apply both measures on the same land.\n\nIf the annual afforestation area of abandoned land in Finland were 3,000 hectares per year for the next 15 years, i.e. a total of 45,000 hectares, greenhouse gas emissions would decrease by an average of 0.1 million tonnes of CO2 eq/year compared to previous land use. If the reference period were 45 years, greenhouse gas emissions would decrease by an average of 0.2 million tonnes of CO2 eq/year. In ILMAVA report (2021), the emission reductions are reported for areas of 90,000 ha and for the theoretical potential of 118,000 ha, in addition to 45,000 ha. For the 118,000 ha, the average annual emission reduction would be 0.25 million tonnes of CO2 eq for the next 15 years.\n\nIn Finland, forests are still being converted into built-up area and agricultural land. The emissions from forest loss are quite high in Finland. The area involved is largest in the case of converting forests into built-up areas while GHG emissions are highest when forests in peatland are cleared for agricultural usage such as manure spreading. Efforts are made to reduce the clearing of forest into agricultural land by developing the processing and utilisation of animal manure (including the biogas programme) and planning and advisory services. With respect to built-up areas, a charge to be collected for land use changes and other possible steering instruments are being considered. According to Timonen (2020), the carbon payment related to land use change would however be an inefficient mechanism to reduce deforestation due to the administrative burden of the large number of small areas involved. Instead, strengthening the Acts on land use and buildings with a perspective of reducing deforestation is suggested to be more effective.\n\nAfforestation and deforestation were studied in the project ‘Potential of land-use measures in climate change mitigation’ (MISA; Kärkkäinen et al., 2019), according to which, climate benefits from decreasing deforestation generally exceeded those from increasing afforestation in Finland. The most beneficial would be to decrease the deforestation on peatlands. Results also showed that for the low productivity agricultural land with thick peat layer, the climate benefits from afforestation valued with the price of emission trading correspond to the average land rent of agricultural land in the northern parts of Finland.\n\nIn ILMAVA project (Lehtonen et al., 2021), the potential to mitigate climate change through reducing deforestation was evaluated further by providing three additional scenarios compared to MISA scenarios. The highest annual GHG emission reductions of 0.68 Mt CO2-eq. in 2035 and 0.86 in 2050 Mt CO2-eq were obtained in the scenario in which clearing of peatlands is reduced the most. However, the difference in emission reduction is small compared to the scenario with equal reductions in deforestation in peatland and mineral soils. This is partly explained by the fact that emissions from built-up areas and total amounts of clearing are of the same magnitude. The notable amount of emissions is caused by removed trees in clearing and that is identical in both scenarios.\n\nWejberg (2020) studied whether afforestation subsidy would be a cost-effective instrument to reduce emissions from both agriculture and the LULUCF sector in Finland. The amount of afforestation subsidy required was calculated as a difference between the net present value of the fields and afforestation. The climate benefits of afforestation in thick peatlands with annual crops were greater than the amount of afforestation support required, for the areas of all ELY centres (The centre for economic development, transport and environment). Afforestation subsidy was found to be an efficient instrument for cessation of peatland cultivation, according to the net present values calculated. If perennial crops were grown on thick peatland, the cost of afforestation subsidy was higher than the climate benefits of afforestation of peatland in some ELY centres. The price of carbon applied in the analysis was 25 €/t CO2. At the current price of EU ETS allowances, afforestation support appeared to be a cost-effective way of reducing emissions from agriculture and the LULUCF sector.\n\nAlthough production subsidies are abolished under the present Swedish Forest Act, there are some initiatives related to forestry, which may be relevant to mention here. One is a compensation scheme related to untouched/biodiversity forestSee: https://jordbruksverket.se/stod/lantbruk-skogsbruk-och-tradgard/investeringar-inom-lantbruk-tradgard-rennaring-skogsbruk/miljoatgarder-i-skogen; the compensation is based on negotiation, and the scheme is targeted at improving biodiversity. Nevertheless, it may be relevant as it may affect the level of carbon sequestration. In addition to this, there is a subsidy for afforestation/rejuvenation of broadleaved forest (Ädellövskogsbruk) and for establishing forests for nature and cultural purposes (Nokås)See: https://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/aga-skog/stod-och-bidrag/adellovsstod/ and https://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/aga-skog/stod-och-bidrag/nokas/. The purpose of these subsidies is not climate mitigation, but nevertheless they may have an effect on the future level of carbon sequestration of the forest.\n\n3.4. Reduced tillage\n\nReduced tillage comes in different versions, one being no tillage. No – or reduced – tillage is one of the three guiding principles behind conservation agriculture. The other two being permanent crop cover and varied crop rotation (never cultivating the same crop two years in a row) (SEGES, 2019). Since reduced tillage is often practiced jointly with the other principles and practices of conservation agriculture, e.g. varied crop rotation, use of catch crops and retention of straw, which all may contribute to increasing the carbon pool of the soil, it may be difficult to isolate the effect of reduced tillage on soil C (Olesen et al., 2018).\n\nReduced or no tillage is advocated as a climate smart agricultural practice due to its perceived positive effects in terms of climate mitigation (increase soil C) as well as climate adaptation (e.g. reduced soil erosion and improved water management). Numerous findings, however, show conflicting results regarding the carbon sequestration effect of reduced tillage, suggesting that reduced – or no – tillage may not represent as promising a climate mitigation measure as initially assumed. Meurer et al. (2018) compares the soil organic carbon content of soils across 3 different tillage intensities and finds that the SOC content is higher for intermediate tillage intensity and no tillage compared to high tillage intensity, but the effect is limited to the top soil, i.e. the top 30 cm of the soil. Similarly, Munkholm et al. (2020) report findings from studies suggesting that the effect of no-till practices primarily is a redistribution of the soil carbon content between different layers of the soil rather than an absolute increase. Meurer et al. (2018) conclude that their results indicate, that the C sequestration potential of no till cultivation practices is overvalued when neglecting deeper depths. This conclusion is supported by findings reported in Olesen et al. (2018), and is in line with the conclusion of Ogle et al. (2019), where it is suggested that no-till should primarily be perceived as an element of climate smart agriculture that can contribute to facilitating adaptation, rather than as a practice that can contribute to mitigation through carbon storage.\n\nWith reference to international meta studies and Danish field trials, Munkholm et al. (2020) note that the effect of direct sowing on soil carbon is negligible – or at least very minor – in cold and wet climates, thus suggesting the effect to be questionable under the climatic conditions prevailing in the Nordic countries. Results of recent Danish studies focusing on the C content of the top 50 cm of the soil support this conclusion, as the results of trials at two different locations covering the period 2002‒-2019 only come close to being significant. However, since the results are close to being significant, it is suggested that there might be an effect if the practice is continued in the long term. If there is an effect, Munkholm et al. (2020) emphasizes that the effect will be declining over time, as a new equilibrium is established (decades).\n\nTillage intensity can also affect N2O emissions, but the effects are complicated, and the sign of the net-effect can either be positive or negative, and accordingly it is not possible to estimate an effect based on existing knowledge (Olesen et al., 2018). However, to consider reduced tillage as a climate mitigation measure, it may be important to also factor in the effect on N2O emissions in order to avoid situations where the net-climate effect will be negative.\n\nIt is relevant to note that reduced tillage entails a reduction in GHG emissions due to reduced use of fuel in agricultural machinery. The reductions are estimated to be in the interval of 33–64 % depending on the more specific practices (Olesen et al., 2018).\n\nNo-till cultivation is primarily implemented in conventional agriculture, as no-till cultivation often creates good conditions for pests such as leaf fungi, slugs and grass weeds (Olesen et al., (2018). Increased presence of pests means that increased use of pesticides may be necessary if an acceptable yield needs to be maintained, and such use of pesticides is evidently not compatible with organic agricultural practices.\n\nNo-tillage cultivation practices are becoming increasingly popular among Danish farmers. From 2016 to 2018 the no-tilled area (area cultivated without ploughing and direct sowing) increased by 26 % from 253,000 to 319,000 ha, which corresponds to approximately 12 % of the total Danish agricultural areaSee e.g.: https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/bagtal/2019/2019-08-26-flere-danske-landmaend-dropper-ploven. The conversion to reduced - or no – tillage in Denmark has been driven by farmers themselves; thus, the adoption of reduced tillage is not prescribed by any regulatory initiative, nor promoted by subsidization.\n\nMunkholm et al. (2020) provides an overview of the prevalence of conservation agriculture in several countries including Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The overview is based on the area where direct sowing is practiced; the share of agricultural land in rotation where direct sowing is practiced amount to 2 % in Denmark, 0.7 % in Sweden and somewhere between 5.5 and 9.2 % in Finland. Thus, the practice is significantly more common in Finland than in the two other countries, but it is noted that interest in the practice is declining.\n\n3.8. Summing up\n\nThe review of measures in the previous sections suggests that all but one, namely reduced tillage, represent potentially relevant measures in terms of increasing carbon sequestration and/or reducing GHG emissions from the LULUCF sector. For the measure ‘set-aside’ it may however be noted that the relative desirability of the measure in terms of climate mitigation to some extent is limited by the fact that the effect ceases by the time the set-aside allocation is terminated i.e. the land is put back into production/cultivation. Thus, using set-aside as a climate measure may not be very relevant, but on the other hand it may be important to include the climate effect of the measure when designing other regulations, e.g. related to N leaching, as including climate side-effect may serve to increase the overall efficiency of N regulation.\n\nAll the reviewed measures are seen to be implemented to some extent in one or several of the Nordic countries, although it only is for a minor subset of the measures that the climate effect is the main goal of the implementation. As the climate effect of a given measure in many cases is seen to vary significantly depending on where the measure is implemented, and/or the more specific characteristics of the measure, the fact that climate often is not the prime motive for implementation may imply that the realized climate effect is less than it could have been. For most measures, however, the potential positive effect in terms of climate is acknowledged, and it seems that focus is increasingly being directed at climate as a specific secondary effect of the reviewed measures. Thus, there already seems to be a widespread recognition of the fact that the adoption of a more holistic perspective may increase the cost efficiency of environmental and climate regulation.\n\nThe reviewed measures with the largest effect are withdrawal of organic soils from agricultural production and changes in peatland farming practices. Both these measures concern soils with a high soil organic carbon content, and the estimated GHG effect of these measures are up to around 30 tonnes CO2-eq. per ha per year, although varying significantly depending on local conditions and the type of management change. It should be said that withdrawal of organic soils, including rewetting, will only limit the current CO2 emission. It will not sequester carbon, which is very important to avoid further global warming. Therefore, in the longer term, withdrawal of cultivated organic soils shall be combined with carbon sequestration measures. While numerous studies have reported how rewetting contributes to emission reduction (e.g. Martens et al., 2021; Günther et al., 2020), studies remain lacking that examine the long-term effects of rewetting for restoration of ecosystem functions and processes such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity (Kløve et al., 2017). It is also important to note the climate mitigation trade-offs of rewetting, between CO2 emission reduction on the one side and CH4 emission increase on the other (e.g. Renou- Günther et al., 2020; Wilson et al, 2019).\n\nCarbon storage in soils as biochar has not been covered in this paper. Biochar is created by pyrolysis of organic matter and the remaining carbon has a very low degradation rate in soil, which leads to an overall increase in the soil carbon stock. The technique is currently under development and it is therefore not possible to give good estimates for the costs and its possible short-term implementation in agriculture. Nonetheless, it seems to be a more promising measure for storing CO2 even in the longer term compared to afforestation.\n\nThe effects of the other reviewed measures are significantly lower, but this does not necessarily imply that they are less cost-efficient. Thus, an important distinction between the reviewed measures is whether they refer to changes in production – implying that either agricultural or forestry production can continue in the future – or to changes that require withdrawal of land from productive use. Just as the effect will vary from case to case the costs are also likely to vary - both across measures and across specific locations, and all else equal, costs will be higher for measures involving withdrawal of land from production than for less invasive measures. Accordingly, less effective measures, which allow production to continue, may be the best option in areas where the land production value is high, while measures requiring withdrawal of land from production may primarily be relevant in areas where the land production value is low.\n\nOverall, there does not seem to be very much variation in terms of policy instruments where the implementation of existing measures is either promoted though subsidization (fixed subsidies or cost coverage) or by command-and-control regulation (e.g. catch crop requirements). As mentioned in Section 3.4 there are ongoing discussions in Finland about implementing a land use change tax, suggesting that focus is starting to be directed at potential new policy instruments that provide economic incentive for landowners to make climate friendly land-use decisions without burdening public finances.\n\nDespite the reviewed measures already being implemented to varying degrees, there seems to be potential for additional future implementation of these measures. Thus, there seems to be ample scope for increasing the contribution of the LULUCF sector to climate mitigation In Finland, two comprehensive reports, the climate roadmap for agriculture (Lehtonen et al. 2020) and ILMAVA report (Lehtonen et al. 2021), highlight the important role of land use sector to contribute to Finland’s climate target towards carbon neutrality goal by 2035. The realization of the land use sector’s participation is expected to require substantial resources for providing sufficient incentives for farmers to implement land use the necessary land use measures.. Moreover, with reference to the limited variation in the policy instruments applied currently, it seems highly relevant to investigate the potential for expanding the policy instrument portfolio in order to underpin the cost effectiveness of carbon sequestration measures in the LULUCF sector in the Nordic region.\n\n4.1.1. Integration of land-use based carbon sequestration in emission trading schemes\n\nIncorporating land-use-based carbon sequestration, including agricultural soil carbon, into the European Emission Trading Scheme, has been called upon as a potential policy instrument. For example, Verschuuren (2018) argued that existing policy instruments were “inadequate to stimulate large scale adoption of soil carbon projects across Europe”. Verschuuren proposed the inclusion of agricultural land use in the EU ETS through sales of carbon credits resulting from climate smart agricultural practices. In this way, farmers/landowners generate income from participating in the trade.\n\nWhile the potential has been acknowledged, realising a carbon market for the land-based sector will necessitate 1) secure carbon price in the long run, and 2) robust and reliable mechanisms for monitoring, reporting and verifying (MRV) the carbon effects generated from the implementation of the chosen land-based measures (Verschuuren, 2018; van Kooten et al., 2009, Walcott et al., 2009). In order to facilitate individual landowners to participate in the carbon market, the MRV requires reliable methods and analysis as well as accurate data that can accommodate small units and scales and the variation in soil types and land uses. Equally important is how to ensure that the carbon sequestration takes place as a result of the implementation of certain management practices (i.e. due to human interventions) not something that would otherwise occur naturally; hence requiring an assessment of how the soil carbon contents change under different management options (Walcott et al., 2009).\n\nA number of challenges/issues have been highlighted, affecting the legitimacy of carbon offset credits from biological/terrestrial carbon sequestration, hence their incorporation into carbon trading scheme. These include high transaction costs for MRV, leakage, additionality, impermanence, uncertainty, heterogeneity of land and landowners, distributional impacts on land managers/farmers (van Kooten et al., 2009, Walcott et al., 2009; Gren and Aklilu, 2016; Grosjean et al., 2017). In addition, a selection of land-based measures for climate mitigation particularly those on agricultural land may not be attractive as carbon offset. Therefore, CAP is expected to play an important role to fill the gap but needs to be geared more explicitly towards climate mitigation and adaptation objectives and to remove or reduce barriers for participation by land managers/farmers (Grosjean et al., 2017, Verschuuren, 2018). Reallocation of CAP funds, for example for buying carbon offset from land managers/farmers, is worth considering. However, it is important to not only assess the carbon effect but also to account for the full greenhouse gas emission effect of implementing agricultural practices for carbon sequestration, for example using a life cycle analysis (Walcott et al., 2009). In the same vein, any potential trade-offs with other environmental objectives have to be evaluated (Grosjean et al., 2017).\n\nSome solutions to a selection of the aforementioned challenges/issues have been suggested, for example a review by Gren and Aklilu (2016). To address uncertainty in land-based carbon sequestration risk, discounting can be applied whereby the value of carbon sequestered from land-based measures is discounted to a fraction of that from permanent sequestration. For example, in a carbon offset system, carbon sequestered through land-based measures is set to be worth half the carbon credits derived from permanent sequestration or from technology-based emission abatements. Meanwhile, solutions to manage risks of non-permanence in land-based carbon sequestration projects have also been identified. One of the solutions is to apply buffer credits by deducting and setting aside a certain percentage of the eligible carbon credits (e.g. 10%), which can be claimed back at the end of a project if it successfully demonstrates the absence of carbon reversals. Another solution is a combination of setting a minimum timescale for carbon sequestration projects, assigning liability for carbon reversal events and applying a penalty for project withdrawal. To manage additionality of land-based carbon projects, designing optimal contract and emissions baselines has been suggested. It can also be addressed by additionality tests following approved standards on a project-by-project basis. Furthermore, to account for permanence, leakage and additionality, Murray et al. (2007) highlighted three methods to account for carbon reversal in order to adjust carbon credits from agricultural soil carbon sequestration: 1) Comprehensive method – assigning carbon credits based on either “carbon stock change” or average carbon storage, which are informed by regular measurements of carbon stock; 2) Ex ante discounting – to discount the carbon credits of a project by X% based on the amount of expected future carbon loss. As such, carbon credits are assigned based on expected (ex-ante) rather than measured carbon storage over time; 3) Temporary crediting – assigning carbon credits to be valid only for a finite period of time. In this case, one of the key tasks is to determine the appropriate credit period hence the expiry date of the temporary credits.\n\nWhile many studies have reported on the marginal costs of land-use-based carbon sequestration and on how these are comparable to the marginal cost of technology-based abatement, reports on the transaction costs remain lacking. For example, a meta regression by Kooten and Sohngen (2007) on studies of carbon offset credit from forestry activities show that none of the studies reported transaction costs. Van Kooten’s analysis (2009) indicates that most carbon sink projects in the analysis would not be economically viable due to the large transaction costs. Furthermore, van Kooten also argued that in general the opportunity cost of land is high which poses an important barrier to the development of terrestrial carbon sinks.\n\nVan Kooten (2009) highlights the need to clearly assign debits and credits as they occur at a certain point in time. A debit occurs whenever an anthropogenic activity releases CO2 into the atmosphere, regardless of the source. A credit is earned by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it in a terrestrial sink. Example from forest, credit accrues from carbon stored in products (e.g. harvested timber) and in soils but by the time the wood products decay and/or carbon released from soils then these become debit. Credits can be earned from avoided deforestation only when countries agree to have targets on deforestation. Otherwise, it would only result in avoided debits.\n\nThe prospect for creating carbon markets for land-based sequestration in the Nordic countries is likely to be determined by the future direction of EU ETS. Until now, carbon sinks from land-based measures are not covered by EU ETS. Views on the matter among relevant actors are still divided whereby those opposing the proposal of including land-based activities into EU ETS are concerned by a number of factors including the high uncertainty and reversibility/non-permanence of land-based carbon credits (Hirsbrunner et al., 2011), which consequently require paramount resources for verification, monitoring and control and lead to large transaction costs. Selecting relevant measures for inclusion in carbon markets therefore need to ensure that uncertainty in the magnitude of and reversibility of the carbon credits resulting from the measures are minimized. Still, the realization of carbon markets for land-based sequestration in the Nordic countries depend on the future development of EU ETS and necessitate joint forces between the countries included in the EU ETS.\n\nConsidering the various challenges previously discussed, which reduce the likelihood of incorporating LULUCF into EU ETS, alternatively, a separate trading scheme for land-based carbon sequestration maybe explored in the future. This highlights the need for future studies on how to design such a scheme cost effectively. In the meantime, the idea of creating a market for carbon from land-based activities (agricultural land, forested land, and wetlands) could well be linked to more recent EU directives. Within the European Union (EU), Member States are required to compensate carbon emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) by an equivalent removal of CO2-equivalents from the atmosphere until 2030 (EU, 2018a). Limited crediting of increases in carbon pools against national targets for fossil fuels but not against the EU Emission Trading Scheme is permitted (EU, 2018b), implying a risk that the cost saving potential is underutilized (Gren et al., 2012). However, flexibility rules permit Member States to buy and sell net LULUCF carbon removals between each other, encouraging countries with low removal costs to reduce the sectors’ emission below the point of carbon neutrality (EU, 2018b). Even so, policy instruments targeting carbon sequestration are lacking at the EU level, and are scarce and nontransparent at national level (Vrebos et al., 2017; Gren and Aklilu, 2016).\n\nFrench Label Bas Carbone\n\nFrench Label Bas Carbone is a low carbon labeling/certification launched in 2018 by the French Ministry of Ecological and Inclusive Transition (Ministère de la Transition écologique et solidaire)https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/label-bas-carbone. The overall aim is to encourage the development of local projects for GHG emission reductions through changes in sectoral practices (e.g. improvement of farming practices) or enhancement of carbon sequestration in natural sinks (e.g. afforestation projects). The platform is expected to contribute to the country’s goal for carbon neutrality by 2050. The labeling guarantees the quality and integrity of the projects thus providing assurance to potential funders or buyers of the certified carbon credits. The project operators (e.g. farmers) get rewarded through the sale of labeled and traceable carbon credits. Prospective projects are submitted to the Ministry but the certification is carried out by an independent body. Thirteen forestry projects have been certified/labelled. Meanwhile, 24 other forestry projects and 391 agricultural projects are currently under development.\n\nAny persons or legal entities are eligible to propose a project for certification. Several actors may wish to form a collective project. Individuals, companies, communities, and associations are welcome to finance low-carbon projects as either a single player or by several players forming a collective project.\n\nFor low carbon label in forestry, three measures are eligible, namely afforestation, reforestation and balivage (conversion of coppice into high forest on stumps). For agriculture, three methods are accepted. The first method, “Carbon Agri”, is developed for emission reductions in cattle and field crops. The second method “Hedges” is directed towards sustainable management of hedges. The third method is called “Plantation of orchards”.\n\nRisk of non-permanence is managed by demanding projects to verify controllable risks and undertake actions to mitigate such risks and by applying a discount to the estimated carbon credits for risks that are not controllable. The larger the risk involved, the higher the discount. For illustration, with respect to fire risk in the case of afforestation, 5% discount is applied to projects with low risk, 10% to medium risk and 15% to high or very high risk. For general risks (e.g. pests and diseases) 10% discount is applied.\n\nProjects are subject to verification by independent auditors, paid by the project applicants/owners. In the case of afforestation, field verification of the emission/sequestration must be done 5 years after the end of afforestation. The field verification is done by an independent auditor, paid by the project owner.\n\nThe amount of carbon credits to be awarded label/certificate is determined by calculating the difference in the emission/sequestration under the proposed project and the baseline scenario (i.e. without project) for example between afforestation (with project) and fallow land (without project). The quantification must follow a method that has been approved by the Ministry of Ecological and Inclusive Transition.\n\nA project must demonstrate through additionality checks that it exceeds current regulation and practices and that the expected emission reductions/sequestration would not have otherwise taken place without the labeling. The additionality checks are specified according to the methods used by the proposed projects. The project must account for both direct, and to the extent relevant, indirect climate effects of the project. The project must not cause negative effects on other environmental objectives nor on socioeconomic aspects. Projects that demonstrate environmental and socioeconomic co-benefits are given favorable assessment.\n\nFrance Carbon Agri Association (FCAA)https://www.france-carbon-agri.fr/ facilitates farmers with project set up, pooling of several farms, development of partnerships with potential institutions/organizations, administrative follow up with the authorities, as well as communication (on farm demonstration about the initiative). Consultancy and certification costs can be minimized by pooling several farms into joint regional and national projects. FCAA also facilitates companies or individuals wishing to support/finance projects and/or purchase the certified carbon credits from low-carbon agricultural projects.\n\nAs can be seen above, result-based instruments for land-based climate mitigation do exist in Europe. The principles of these instruments have the potential to be transferred to the Nordic countries. Relevant measures that can be potentially tailored into result-based schemes in the Nordic countries including but not limited to afforestation and wetland restoration/rewetting. It is nonetheless important to highlight that in order to operationalize this type of instrument several factors have to be put in place first. To illustrate this, reliable and approved methods are needed for quantifying, verifying and monitoring the “result” i.e. the magnitude of carbon sequestration/GHG emission reduction of proposed projects. Moreover, the existence of mechanisms to finance eligible projects is also crucial. The examples reviewed above show that one mechanism for financing projects is by setting up a platform for selling the certified carbon credits from qualified projects as voluntary offsets to businesses or private households in the countries where the instrument is implemented. Such financing mechanism could potentially be set up not only specific to individual countries but also for Nordic wide coverage. It can benefit from the long standing close cooperation between the Nordic countries. All in all, it is important to highlight the importance of securing financial/economic viability of result-based schemes by reconciling both the supply and demand sides of carbon/GHG benefits from land-based measures.\n\n4.1.3. Land-use contracts for carbon sequestration using reverse auctions\n\nTransaction costs, as has been discussed in the preceding sections, are among the key factors determining the efficiency of policy instruments to foster carbon sequestration using land-use measures. Van Kooten et al. (1995) maintained that land-use contracts offer a solution as the use of this policy instrument can minimize transaction costs in land-use-based carbon sequestration. The use of land-use contracts for land-based carbon sequestration has received growing interest in practice in a number of countries with reverse auction mechanisms used to administer the instrument. A conventional auction setting is characterised by one seller with multiple potential buyers placing their respective bids for a good/service on sale which concludes with the highest bidder as the ultimate buyer. A reverse auction, on the contrary, involves one buyer with multiple sellers who express their respective prices (bids) at which they are willing to sell a good/service to the buyer. Land-use contracts using reverse auctions can be set up for either action/input based or output based mechanisms.\n\nExamples of the application of reverse auction for carbon sequestration projects exist. In Australia, since 2014, reverse auction has served as the principle mechanism underpinning the country’s Emission Reduction Fund (ERF) whereby governments purchase the lowest cost projects for emission reductions and/or carbon sequestrationhttp://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/About/Pages/Accountability%20and%20reporting/Annual%20Reports/Annual%20Report%202017-18/Emissions-Reduction-Fund.aspx. ERF is administered by the Clean Energy Regulator which is the Australian government body dedicated to accelerating the country’s carbon abatement. Eligible projects span various sectors including transport, waste management, and land sector. ERF sets a list of approved “methods”, or technical measures, for delivering emission reductions and/or carbon sequestration. In the land sector, these include soil carbon enhancement, reduction of livestock emissions, carbon plantings, and reforestation. There are three key criteria for project eligibility, which address the issue of additionality potentially arising from a project. The first criterion ensures the “newness” of the project whereby the project must satisfactorily demonstrate that the project is not already on-going. The second criterion refers to “the regulatory additionality requirement” which means that a project is not eligible if it belongs to those projects that are actually mandatory under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law. To satisfy the third criterion, a project must demonstrate that government programs other than ERF are not available from which financial/funding mechanism can be secured for implementing the project.\n\nAuctions are open twice a year, each involving multiple rounds. ERF considers two types of contracts: fixed delivery contract and optional delivery contract. Under both contracts, eligible projects have the rights to sell their carbon credit units to the government (i.e. the Clean Energy Regulator) at secured prices as stipulated in the contracts. The difference is that projects under optional delivery contract have the flexibility of not having to sell their carbon credits to the government in case of, for example, a higher carbon price on the market such as from a business wanting to purchase carbon offset during project timeframe.\n\nEligible projects can choose one of the three types of contract lengths under ERF: a) standard contract (7 – 10 years), short term (less than 7 years), and immediate delivery (10 days). The average price per tonne of abatement (CO2-eq) was close to $14 at the first batch of auction in 2015, went down to about $10 in 2016, and has consistently increased since, reaching $16 in 2020.\n\nTo assure accurate calculation of carbon credit units to be delivered by eligible projects, ERF adopts a risk-based audit system. Audits must be arranged and paid for by project owners. All projects are typically subject to two types of audits: one initial audit (covering a minimum period of 6 months) and a number of subsequent audits (each covering a minimum period of 12 months). The frequency of the latter varies depending on the size of the project in terms of the average annual abatement capacity: two subsequent audits for a small project (≤50,000 t CO2-eq per year), three for a medium project (50,000 t CO2-eq 2-eq), and five for a large project (>150,000 t CO2-eq). However, in certain cases, the Clean Energy Regulator may demand an additional, third type of audit known as unscheduled, or triggered audits. Only a registered greenhouse and energy auditor (within the meaning of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007) who is registered as a Category 2 auditor (under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Amendment Regulation 2015) is qualified to carry out the audits.\n\nAll area-based sequestration projects are subject to permanence obligations and they can choose to apply for a permanence period of either 20 or 100 years. This means that projects are obliged to maintain carbon storage for the entirety of the chosen permanence period. All projects are subject to 5% risk of reversal buffer – deducted from the calculated carbon units to be generated by the projects. Moreover, projects with 20-year permanence are subject to a further 20% deduction of the carbon units. This deduction is reserved by the Government for covering the likely cost of replacing carbon storage after the completion of the project. Projects are obliged to self-safeguard against carbon loss risks. In the events of carbon loss, for example due natural disturbance, projects have two options: 1) to undertake management activities to restore the carbon storage to the expected level, or 2) to return carbon units to the Clean Energy Regulator. Projects must inform the Clean Energy Regulator in writing within 60 days in situations where more than 50 hectares or five per cent of total project area has been affected by fire.\n\nReverse auction mechanism in support of carbon sequestration efforts has also recently been adopted in the UK. In November 2019, the UK government, through its ministerial Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) introduced a £50m scheme called “the woodland carbon guarantee”https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-carbon-guarantee. The scheme has twofold purposes, namely providing stimulus for landowners to create new woodlands/forest and for the development of domestic market for carbon generated from woodland based sequestration. Through a reverse auction set up, landowners have the possibility to bid for prices (£/tCO2) at which they are willing to sell their Woodland Carbon Units (WCUs) to the government under the so called “option contracts” for establishing woodlands. This type of contract secures a guaranteed price at which successful bidders can sell their Woodland Carbon Units (WCU) to the government every five or ten years up until 2055/56 while having the flexibility to opt for selling the WCUs to an open market instead in the event of more attractive prices.\n\nThe contracts run between 30 and 35 years. In general, projects of any size are welcome (i.e. there is no requirement for minimum project size) except for landowners who are already participating in other woodland creation grant schemes whereby to be eligible, a project must meet a minimum contract size of three hectares.\n\nAll projects must be registered with the Woodland Carbon Code (WCC)https://woodlandcarboncode.org.uk/, which is now managed by Scottish Forestry, the Scottish Government Agency responsible for forestry policy, support and regulation, on behalf of the Forestry Commission in England, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Forest Service. WCC serves as a focal point for validation of the projects, taking place at the beginning of the projects, and also for the verification of the projects’ WCUs, taking place every five or ten years. To be eligible, landowners/managers must demonstrate that they have full control of all management activities on the lands where woodland plantings will take place. The UK government plans to run two auction windows per year up to five years.\n\nTwo studies from Canada evaluated the potential of using the reverse auction mechanism for the wetland restoration programme. Hill et al. (2011) carried out the study for the Assiniboine River Watershed (ARW) of east‐central Saskatchewan. The auctions were based on discriminatory price principle, took place in two rounds and participants had two contract length options to choose from: 12 year-terms and perpetual easement. In the first round, 20 bidders participated to restore a total area of 670 acres at a price of $837,000 giving an average restoration price of approximately $1250/acre. Following a ground verification, participants were then asked to revise their bids and to submit to the second round. In the end, 7 bidders were approved to restore a total area of 211 acres at a price of $182,000 giving an average restoration price of approximately $863/acre. The price of successful bids ranged between $20.83 and $391.22 per acre per year (average $118.52).\n\nOne important finding from the study was that none of the participants opted for perpetual contracts. In fact, many land managers express a greater preference for annual contracts which suggests their preference for a flexibility on their land management. While the participation in the scheme was considered to be low, Hill et al. (2011) found that land managers who have had previous cooperation conservation agency projects were more likely to participate in the auction. In the same vein, media campaign was found to have a positive influence on land managers participations in the auction.\n\nNovak (2017) reported the application of reverse auction for wetland restoration in the Wintering Hills area of Wheatland County, Alberta, Canada. They implemented a single round auction under a uniform pricing mechanism hence contrary to the approach of Hill et al. (2011). Moreover, the length of the contract for wetland restoration in the case of Wheatland County Reverse was 10 years, slightly shorter compared with that of Hill et al. (2011). In the end, 26 bids were approved covering a total area of 275.22 for wetland restoration, resulting in an average area of 10.56 acres per bid and average price of restoration of $3,000/acre. Comparing the findings from the two studies, in 2015 prices, Novak (2017) found that wetland restoration scheme in Wheatland County Reverse (WCR) was in absolute terms more expensive than in the Assiniboine River Watershed (ARW). The average securement costs were $3000 per acre and $970 per acre in WCR and ARW respectively. However, further analysis showed that while the average securement cost in WCR is equivalent to 2.9 times land rental rates in the area, the figure is higher in ARW (4.6 times). Another important insight from the study in WCR was that the bidders’ price motivation was not solely driven by opportunity cost of land but also by rent-seeking behaviour. Nevertheless, similar to the case of ARW, participation rate in WCR reverse auction was also low (9.19% of landowners).\n\nLand-use contracts using reverse auction mechanism can potentially offer an alternative, more cost-effective policy instrument to the existing subsidy schemes that have implications for land-based climate mitigation in the Nordic countries. Existing economic instruments related to land-based measures, albeit mostly not directly targeted for climate mitigation, are in principle based on a uniform incentive provision. Even though specific requirements/details may be attached in the existing economic incentive instruments, it does not lead to the implementation of the most effective/efficient land-based projects per se. This is partly because the instruments do not differentiate payments according to variation in costs and effects across the target landscape. On the contrary, a reverse auction-based contract provides incentives that accommodate the heterogeneity of the farmers and their lands. This type of instrument can be expected to encourage wider and more efficient implementation of various land-based measures. Under this instrument, the society is expected to get the most value of the incentives provided to the landowners as the cheapest projects can be picked up from the reverse-auction bids. As examples from other countries have shown, the reverse-auction based contract can be used to target various land-based mitigation measures including tree planting and wetland restoration. For the Nordic countries, this instrument can be directed towards a selection of measures such as afforestation, wetland creation and cessation of agricultural production on peatlands/organic soils. The scope for implementing this instrument is expected to differ between the Nordic countries depending on the remaining potential of the relevant measures to be realized in the respective countries.\n\nA number of land-based measures related to agricultural lands, forestry, and wetlands with significant impacts on carbon sequestration and/or emission reduction have been implemented in one or more of the three Nordic countries, which are the focus of the present report. However, the implementation of many, if not most, of these measures have not necessarily been primarily driven by climate change mitigation objectives but more targeted on other environmental goals e.g. water management and biodiversity. In the same vein, the choice of technical measures for enhancing carbon sequestration should take into account the full unintended consequences, both desirable and undesirable, on other objectives e.g. food provisioning, water management, biodiversity conservation.\n\nWe have reviewed a selection of relevant land-based measures, the likely effects on climate mitigation and some insights into their implementation in the three Nordic countries. These measures can be broadly divided into two: land use changes (e.g. withdrawal of organic soils from cultivation, afforestation) and land management (e.g. reduced tillage). The effects on carbon sequestration or emission reduction of the reviewed measures differ. To illustrate this, measures to withdraw organic soils from agricultural production and measures to reduce GHG emissions form cultivated peatland seem to have large effects while other measures are associated with lower effects. Nonetheless, less effective measures may prove to be the best option for land areas with high production value. Moreover, the climate mitigation effects also vary according to the site conditions. This further implies regional differences in the potential of increasing carbon sequestration across the Nordic countries. Despite the reviewed measures already being implemented, albeit in most cases not directly deployed for climate objective, there seems to be potential for additional implementation of these land-based measures in the Nordic region.\n\nTo date, policy instruments to support the implementation of land-based measures that deliver carbon sequestration or emission reduction effects do exist albeit rather scarcely especially instruments that are primarily targeted towards climate objective. Of the existing policy instruments, the majority takes the form of subsidy scheme for example in the case of catch crops, energy crops, afforestation, and wetland creation/restoration.\n\nWe have reviewed a selection of policy instruments that can potentially be considered as part of the portfolio of policy instruments to further enhance carbon sequestration and/or emission reduction in agricultural lands, forest, and wetlands in the Nordic countries. We focused on potential instruments that have grounded scientific investigations and have practical prospects for implementation. It is important to note that the goal of this report is to give an overview of possibilities in terms of policy instruments that could be introduced in the Nordic countries. However, the final choice of instrument remains a political decision which needs to be informed by further primary, empirical research for example with respect to how designs of the different instruments could/should be custom tailored to the Nordic conditions.\n\nAmong the promising instruments that have been called upon in the literature is to establish a market for carbon offset credits from land-based measures implemented, for example, in agricultural lands and forested areas. This could be institutionalized, for example, through inclusion of carbon credits from LULUCF sector in the EU Emission Trading Scheme. Despite the claimed potentials, some challenges and possible solutions have been discussed in the literature. For example, standardized additionality tests and differentiating between temporary and permanent buffer credits can be respectively used to manage additionality and permanence issues. Nevertheless, high transaction costs (e.g. for monitoring and verification including data availability) remain an important barrier. Despite the growing number of studies demonstrating the competitiveness of land-based sequestration compared to technology-based approaches from marginal cost point of view, there are still not many available studies on the associated transaction costs. While this type of instrument is relevant for the Nordic countries, the realization will largely depend on the future direction of EU ETS and demands close collaborations with other countries participating in EU ETS.\n\nResult-based schemes for land-based climate mitigation are currently being implemented in a few European countries. At the heart of this type of instrument is to establish a platform for certifying carbon/GHG benefits from land-based measures which can then be made available for purchase by companies or private households towards their voluntary offsets. Key features of the schemes can be transferred to the development of similar instruments in the Nordic countries. The existing examples have been set up to target land-based measures that are also relevant in the Nordic region for example wetland restoration and afforestation. As is the case with other potential instruments, it is prerequisite to have a standard and reliable methodology in place for quantifying, verifying and monitoring the GHG benefits from projects to be included in the schemes. It is also crucial to have viable financing mechanisms in place, for example, through sale of the certified carbon/GHG benefits as voluntary offsets to companies or households.\n\nLand-use contracts using reverse auctions has the potential for adoption in an effort to further enhance carbon sequestration through land-based measures in the Nordic countries. The model has been implemented for some time in Australia and more recently in the UK with the latter specifically targeted towards tree/forest planting. Among the attractive features of this instrument is that it can minimize transaction costs. Under this scheme, landowners have the incentive to invest in activities for land-based carbon sequestration with guaranteed price of carbon credits in accordance with the outcome of the auctions while at the same time they have the flexibility to sell their carbon credits to the open market (instead of the government) if a better price exists. Based on the examples from Australia and the UK, the reverse auction-based land-use contracts can be potentially deployed in the Nordic countries especially in relation to afforestation measures. The implementation of this policy instrument necessitates a number of infrastructures including for example appropriate/accepted methods for the assessment, verification and monitoring of the carbon sequestration. The scale of the implementation reflects how many resources the government is willing to allocate and how much landowners are willing to partake in the scheme.\n\nConditional insurance scheme to stimulate climate smart agricultural production. Under this set up, in order to be eligible for insurance coverage against the risk of adverse impact of the climate, farmers are obliged to undertake certain land/soil management measures which contribute towards carbon sequestration and/or emission reduction. The magnitude of the effect of implementing this scheme could be limited considering the fact that to date the uptake/penetration of private crop/weather insurance among farmers in the Nordic countries remain limited. However, as the risk of extreme events under a changing climate is becoming more pronounced, enacting this type of insurance will become an important strategy for climate change adaptation. In the short run it may require substantial public/governmental support during the establishment and consolidation of the insurance scheme. However, this may prove to be a better alternative in the long run as it shifts the burden on public budget from providing ad hoc supports into a more systematic private-public strategy. The strategy is important for hedging against future risk of natural catastrophes especially in view of extreme climates, which in the future are expected to increase in frequency as well as magnitude.\n\nAs policy instruments for forest owners to enhance carbon sequestration in existing forests, tax/subsidy scheme and carbon rents have been proposed in the scientific literature. The Nordic studies suggest that notable increases in carbon sequestered could be achieved even with carbon payments based on the low carbon prices. The size of the impact however differs between studies.\n\nSome studies suggest that carbon sequestration in forests could provide a low-cost option to mitigate climate change compared to reducing emissions from fossil fuels. Timber market effects are however notable with lower harvests and a higher price of timber, implying higher costs for the forest industries. In addition, the supply of forest-based biomass for energy production is reduced and this could lead to higher CO2 emissions in energy sector. These impacts are smaller if fertilization is used as a measure to increase the amount of carbon in forests. One study tested fertilization but concluded that this measure is not cost-effective.\n\nSome studies suggest that the impacts of forest carbon payments on carbon sequestration and timber markets are largest in the short run while others emphasize the long run impact. The difference in the size and timing of sequestration and timber market impacts are likely to follow from the differences in the models used in the analysis instead of differences in country conditions. All the studies presumed an exogenous carbon price and thus they could not consider whether it could be worthwhile to save carbon sequestration opportunities later when the carbon price is likely to be higher.\n\nIn all studies reviewed, the carbon sequestration policy was implemented unilaterally as they are based on single-country models. The imports of timber were increased in all studies. This means that harvest and release of carbon are increased in countries without forest carbon policy. The assumption of unilateral implementation strengthens the impact of carbon rents on the carbon sink compared to multilateral implementation of a policy (Pohjola et al 2018). In order to prevent carbon leakage, it would be important to implement the incentive system internationally.\n\nAll in all, the Nordic studies suggest that a notable increase in carbon sequestered in existing forests could be achieved even with carbon payments based on the low carbon prices. If the increase in carbon sequestration is mainly driven by lengthening rotation and delaying thinning, the impacts on timber market could be notable. It might be feasible to implement these policies gradually by starting with low carbon rent and by increasing it over time. Under such policies, it is important to define the baseline in order to pay forest owners only for additional carbon sequestration. Moreover, the policies should be made permanent.\n\n6.
