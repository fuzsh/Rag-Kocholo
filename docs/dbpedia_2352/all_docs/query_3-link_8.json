        "text": "The ‘Substance identity’ section is calculated from substance identification information from all ECHA databases. The substance identifiers displayed in the InfoCard are the best available substance name, EC number, CAS number and/or the molecular and structural formulas.\n\nSome substance identifiers may have been claimed confidential, or may not have been provided, and therefore not be displayed.\n\nEC (European Community) Number\n\nThe EC Number is the numerical identifier for substances in the EC Inventory. The EC Inventory is a combination of three independent European lists of substances from the previous EU chemicals regulatory frameworks (EINECS, ELINCS and the NLP-list). More information about the EC Inventory can be found here.\n\nIf the substance was not covered by the EC Inventory, ECHA attributes a list number in the same format, starting with the numbers 6, 7, 8 or 9.\n\nThe EC or list number is the primary substance identifier used by ECHA.\n\nCAS (Chemical Abstract Service) registry number\n\nThe CAS number is the substance numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service, a division of the American Chemical Society, to substances registered in the CAS registry database. A substance identified primarily by an EC or list number may be linked with more than one CAS number, or with CAS numbers that have been deleted. More information about CAS and the CAS registry can be found here.\n\nMolecular formula\n\nThe molecular formula identifies each type of element by its chemical symbol and identifies the number of atoms of each element found in one discrete molecule of the substance. This information is only displayed if the substance is well–defined, its identity is not claimed confidential and there is sufficient information available in ECHA’s databases for ECHA’s algorithms to generate a molecular structure.\n\nMolecular structure\n\nThe molecular structure is based on structures generated from information available in ECHA’s databases. If generated, an InChI string will also be generated and made available for searching. This information is only displayed if the substance is well-defined, its identity is not claimed confidential and there is sufficient information available in ECHA’s databases for ECHA’s algorithms to generate a molecular structure.\n\nMore help available here.\n\nThe ‘Hazard classification and labelling’ section shows the hazards of a substance based on the standardised system of statements and pictograms established under the CLP (Classification Labelling and Packaging) Regulation. The CLP Regulation makes sure that the hazards presented by chemicals are clearly communicated to workers and consumers in the European Union. The CLP Regulation uses the UN Global Harmonised System (GHS) and European Union Specific Hazard Statements (EUH).\n\nThis section is based on three sources for information (harmonised classification and labelling (CLH), REACH registrations and CLP notifications). The source of the information is mentioned in the introductory sentence of the hazard statements. When information is available in all sources, the first two are displayed as a priority.\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe purpose of the information provided under this section is to highlight the substance hazardousness in a readable format. It does not represent a new labelling, classification or hazard statement, neither reflect other factors that affect the susceptibility of the effects described, such as duration of exposure or substance concentration (e.g. in case of consumer and professional uses). Other relevant information includes the following:\n\nSubstances may have impurities and additives that lead to different classifications. If at least one company has indicated that the substance classification is affected by impurities or additives, this will be indicated by an informative sentence. However, substance notifications in the InfoCard are aggregated independently of the impurities and additives.\n\nHazard statements were adapted to improve readability and may not correspond textually to the hazard statements codes description in the European Union Specific Hazard Statements (EUH) or the UN Global Harmonised System (GHS).\n\nTo see the full list of notified classifications and to get more information on impurities and additives relevant to classification please consult the C&L Inventory.\n\nMore information about Classification and Labelling is available in the Regulations section of ECHA website.\n\nMore help available here.\n\nHarmonised classification and labelling (CLH)\n\nHarmonised classification and labelling is a legally binding classification and labelling for a substance, agreed at European Community level. Harmonisation is based on the substance’s physical, toxicological and eco-toxicological hazard assessment.\n\nThe ‘Hazard classification’ and labelling section uses the signal word, pictogram(s) and hazard statements of the substance under the harmonised classification and labelling (CLH) as its primary source of information.\n\nIf the substance is covered by more than one CLH entry (e.g. disodium tetraborate EC no. 215–540–4, is covered by three harmonisations&colon; 005–011–00–4; 005–011–01–1 and 005–011–02–9), CLH information cannot be displayed in the InfoCard as the difference between the CLH classifications requires manual interpretation or verification. If a substance is classified under multiple CLH entries, a link to the C&L Inventory is provided to allow users to view CLH information associated with the substance and no text is automatically generated for the InfoCard.\n\nIt is possible that a harmonisation is introduced through an amendment to the CLP Regulation. In that case, the ATP (Adaptation to Technical Progress) number is displayed.\n\nMore info on CLH can be found here.\n\nClassification and labelling under REACH\n\nIf available, additional information on classification and labelling (C&L) is derived from REACH registration dossiers submitted by industry. This information has not been reviewed or verified by ECHA, and may change without prior notice. REACH registration dossiers have greater data requirements (such as supporting studies) than do notifications under CLP.\n\nNotifications under the Classification Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation\n\nIf no EU harmonised classification and labelling exists and the substance was not registered under REACH, information derived from classification and labelling (C&L) notifications to ECHA under CLP Regulation is displayed under this section. These notifications can be provided by manufacturers, importers and downstream users. ECHA maintains the C&L Inventory, but does not review or verify the accuracy of the information.\n\nNote that for readability purposes, only the pictograms, signal words and hazard statements referred in more than 5% of the notifications under CLP are displayed.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the calculated volume at which the substance is manufactured or imported to the European Economic Area (EU28 + Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Additionally, if available, information on the use of the substance and how consumers and workers are likely to be exposed to it can also be displayed here.\n\nThe use information is displayed per substance life cycle stage (consumer use, in articles, by professional workers (widespread uses), in formulation or re-packing, at industrial sites or in manufacturing). The information is aggregated from the data coming from REACH substance registrations provided by industry.\n\nFor a detailed overview on identified uses and environmental releases, please consult the registered substance factsheet.\n\nUse descriptors are adapted from ECHA guidance to improve readability and may not correspond textually to descriptor codes described in Chapter R.12: Use Descriptor system of ECHA Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment.\n\nThe examples provided are generic examples and may not apply to the specific substance you are viewing. A substance may have its use restricted to certain articles or products and therefore not all the examples may apply to the specific substance. Furthermore, some substances can be found in an article, but with unlikely exposure (e.g. inside a watch) or with very low concentrations considered not to pose risks to human health or the environment.\n\nPlease note:\n\nFor readability purpose, only non-confidential use descriptors occurring in more than 5% of total occurrences are displayed.\n\nThe described Product category (i.e. the products in which the substance may be used) may refer to uses as intermediate and under controlled conditions, for which there is no consumer exposure.\n\nMore help is available here."
