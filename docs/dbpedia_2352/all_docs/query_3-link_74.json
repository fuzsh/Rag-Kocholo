        "text": "This is how the calculation was performed by Deloitte Economics\n\n5 million tonnes\n\nQuestion addressed:\n\nWhat would be the impact of increasing the circularity of consumer goods (i.e. repairing damaged goods or buying goods second-hand rather than purchasing brand new items or replacing items when they break)?\n\nBaseline situation, Norway:\n\nConsumption-based GHG emissions are 9.2 tonnes per capita (Global Carbon Project 2022, 2019 base year)\n\nYearly aggregate consumption is EUR 27,065 per capita (Eurostat, 2019 base year).\n\nConsumption-based GHG decreases by 0.6% yearly.\n\nAssumed intervention:\n\nA range of policy measures are implemented to incentivise the switch to circularity (e.g. a reduced VAT rate on repair services and second-hand goods).\n\nA share of the Nordic population is assumed to be “eco-active” and take active steps to take climate considerations into account in its consumption patterns (e.g. buying more sustainable products, actively manage waste, etc.). Eco-active consumers are assumed to switch a share of their consumption towards circularity when possible.\n\nThe share of eco-active consumers is estimated to be 21.3% in the Nordics and grows at a pace of 2.6 percentage points every year (based on European data from a 2022 GfK panel, using a median scenario).\n\nAssumed impact:\n\nUsing the composition of Eurostat’s harmonised index of consumer prices (2022) as a proxy for consumption expenditure structuring, 9.4% of aggregate consumption is assumed to be spent on goods that are eligible to circularity (e.g. small appliances, toys, clothing items).\n\n50% of end-of-life goods are assumed to be repairable or available as second-hand items rather than purchased from new again.\n\nRepaired or second-hand goods translate into avoided GHG emissions from new products.\n\nThe impact is expressed net of the trending decrease in consumption-based GHG emissions observed in the baseline.\n\nLimitations:\n\nBy using aggregate consumption data, there is an implicit assumption that the CO2 intensity is smoothed across the different items making the average consumer basket. This is a simplification due to data constraints that limits the precision of the analysis. It should however yield a more conservative impact assessment since manufactured goods on which repairs services can be performed are typically more CO2 intensive than other items in the average consumption basket (e.g. services).\n\nNordic households typically demonstrate more eco-friendly consumption patterns than in most other European countries. The fraction of eco-friendly consumers in the Nordics is therefore likely to be underestimated.\n\nWhen comparing the impact of repair services or second-hand purchases to the impact of material recovery (through recycling), it should be noted that the majority of GHG emissions for manufactured goods stem from manufacturing processes rather than from raw materials (hence the much larger impact of repair and reuse per product).\n\nThe 50% switch to circularity is an arbitrary assumption made as part of hypothesis-development and is not backed by research.\n\nThis is how the calculation was performed by Deloitte Economics\n\n3,4 million tonnes\n\nQuestion addressed:\n\nWhat would be the impact of removing enough administrative burdens (mostly permitting procedures) to speed up the deployment of the current renewable e energy pipeline by 50%.\n\nBaseline situation, Norway:\n\nAnnual onshore wind installations of 0.6 GW (Wind Europe 2022-2026 forecast, 2022)\n\nAnnual hydropower installations of 0.1 GW (IEA, 2022)\n\nCarbon intensity of the electricity grid is 17.2kg of CO2 eq. per MWh (factoring in energy imports), decarbonisation at 6.5% per year (assumed similar to Sweden: no real decarbonisation can be observed in the past 5 years)\n\nAssumed intervention:\n\nThe lift of administrative burden allows to accelerate the planned development pace of renewable energy projects by half, allowing 50% additional capacity to come online every year until 2030.\n\nCapacity factors are assumed to be 25% for onshore wind, 50% for offshore wind, 12% for solar photovoltaic and 51% for hydropower (IEA, 2022).\n\nAssumed impact:\n\nUsing the emission accounting approach from the European Energy Agency, renewable sources are assumed to provide GHG-free electricity.\n\nOnly the impact of the incremental 50% renewable electricity capacity is accounted (net from assumed continued decarbonisation efforts in each country as included in the baseline)\n\nAssumed impact, Norway:\n\nIn Norway, 100% of the renewable energy is assumed to go to the electrification of oil and gas production\n\nThe implied CO2 intensity of the electricity used for oil and gas production is assumed to be 682kg per MWh (Norwea estimates the electricity consumption to be 15 TWh and estimates from the University of Bergen indicate a total of electricity-related emissions of 10.2 million tonnes of CO2 eq.)\n\nThe impact is accounted net of the carbon intensity form the existing Norwegian electricity grid\n\nLimitations:\n\nFollowing the European Environmental Agency and the Greenhouse , the life cycle assessment emissions of renewable energy assets is not accounted for (the emissions tied to the manufacturing and installation of the assets). These emissions are highly dependent on the place where the components were manufactured.\n\nThe 50% increase in development capacity is an arbitrary assumption made as part of hypothesis-development and is not backed by research.\n\nThis is how the calculation was performed by Deloitte Economics\n\n5,1 million tonnes\n\nQuestion addressed:\n\nWhat would be the impact of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 (on a 2020 baseline).\n\nBaseline situation:\n\n770 kilotonnes of food has gone to waste in Norway in 2020 (Eurostat, 2022, 2020 data).\n\nConsumption-based GHG emissions decrease annually by 1.9% in Denmark, 1.2% in Sweden and 0.7% in Norway.\n\nFood waste is considered across the entire value chain, this includes primary production, processing and manufacturing, retail and distribution., restaurants and food services as well as households.\n\nAssumed intervention:\n\nPolicies and incentives allow a gradual decrease of food waste, to reach 50% of the 2020 baseline by 2030 (linear progression).\n\nAssumed impact:\n\nThe removed food waste is assumed to be consumed, displacing the need for food production and the GHG emissions associated to the production of that food.\n\nFood waste is distributed in three categories (animal, vegetal and mixed) using the European Waste Catalogue for Statistics (EWC-Stat), using a series of coefficients to adjust for the fraction of materials unsuitable for human consumption embedded in those waste streams (Caldeira et al., 2022).\n\nFor each of the food waste categories, an average CO2 eq content is estimated using Concito’s “Big climate database”. The following CO2 intensity factors are adopted:\n\n4.26 kg of CO2 eq. per kg of animal food waste.\n\n1.33 kg of CO2 eq. per kg of vegetal food waste.\n\n2.80 kg of CO2 eq. per kg of mixed food waste (assumed to be a mix of vegetal and animal).\n\nThe decrease in GHG emissions is accounted net of trending consumption-related decrease (observed on the 2015-2019 period as reported by the Global Carbon Project and considered part of the baseline).\n\nLimitations:\n\nFood waste is notoriously difficult to reliably estimate (see e.g. work form the World Food Programme), particularly from a value chain standpoint. The approach adopted is imperfect but builds upon the latest data and research available on the topic.\n\nIn Norway, a recent report from the Ministry of the Environment estimates food waste to be well below the estimates form Eurostat used in our analysis (453 kilotonnes). An alternative analysis using weighted waste flows as suggested in Caldeira et al (2022) yields results very close to the results provided by Eurostat.\n\nAlternative waste estimates using material flow analysis by Caldeira et al (2022) shows comparable results as the estimates yielded by the approach adopted here for Denmark (the only Nordic country covered I the research).\n\nThis is how the calculation was performed by Deloitte Economics\n\n636 000 tonnes\n\nBaseline situation, Norway:\n\n198 kilotonnes of waste electronics are generated every year (United Nations University / United Nations Institute for Training and Research, 2020)\n\nThe current collection rate of electronic waste is 44% (United Nations University / United Nations Institute for Training and Research, 2020)\n\nThe current recycling rate of electronic waste is 88% (of collected waste, Eurostat), that is 92.7 kilotonnes\n\nAssumed intervention:\n\nUncollected electronic waste is collected and recycled at the current recycling rate for each geography\n\n50% of the newly recycled waste goes through an optimised recycling process where transport routes are optimised and where high-grade material recovery methods are applied.\n\nAssumed impact:\n\nThe impact of optimised recycling is assumed to be 2.01 kg of avoided GHG emissions per kilotonne of waste electronic (Bond, 202, under a project funded by the European Regional Development Fund)\n\nElectronic waste (and related recycling) is assumed to grow by 1.4% every year, based on the historical growth rate of devices placed on market (United Nations University / United Nations Institute for Training and Research, 2020)\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe methodology for the estimate of waste is based on a “placed on market” (POM) approach. POM approach estimates waste generation based on the volume of devices sold in a given geography and typically yields higher estimates than other statistical estimates of electronic wastes.\n\nThe impact of current recycling method is fluctuating and is difficult to assess consistently. For this reason, our assessment only focuses on uncollected waste going through high-grade recycling to avoid making assumptions about the recovery rates of current recycling methods.\n\nThe CO2 savings assumptions for optimised recycling (2.01 kg per kilotonne of waste) are taken from Bond, 2022 under a project by the European Regional Development Fund. The research is a combined approach of material flow analysis and life cycle assessment. These results are likely underestimated for high-grade recycling: Results from a life cycle assessment carried out by Deloitte on critical material recovery form electronic waste suggest a 2.04 kg / kilotonne of waste impact on avoided emissions.\n\nThe 50% of waste going through optimised recycling is an arbitrary assumption made as part of hypothesis-development and is not backed by research.\n\nIn relation to the collection rate, it should be underlined that everything that is not collected does not end up in nature, and that in the case of WEEE, it can often mean that it instead accumulates in our drawers, basements or garages etc."
