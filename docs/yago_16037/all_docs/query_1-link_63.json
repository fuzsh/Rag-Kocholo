        "text": "Marcy Muzzler and Marty Muzzler, collectively known as The Muzzlers, are characters from the Disney Channel animated series Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur. They are a couple who are obsessed with technology and silence.\n\nBackground[]\n\nPersonalities[]\n\nThe Muzzlers are collectively peppy and optimistic. They are constantly smiling and, as their appearance progressed, start to come off as unsettling. They are apparently oblivious to other people's feelings and are constantly pushing their own ideas onto others with no regard for the ramifications that are to occur. When Moon Girl finally turns on them, they show their true colors as a couple that demand to have things their way are not afraid to use force if necessary.\n\nPhysical appearances[]\n\nBoth Marty and Marcy are tall, white adults. Marcy is slightly shorter and slender with reddish-brown hair tied down into a bun and pink lips while Marty is slightly taller, chubbier, and has parted short brown hair. Both of them wear black framed glasses and wear similar looking black, blue and silver outfits, that are nuclear powered, and have white lab coats over them.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nMarty and Marcy are inventors and are shown to have created numerous devices Among them include:\n\nNoise dampener: This comes in various shapes and sizes. Its capabilities are so effective that it can completely shut off sound in the world.\n\nHover packs: Essentially jetpacks, but they do not create exhaust. Instead they are clean and efficient.\n\nHolographic weaponry: These are solid holographic constructs that can take the shapes of weapons and are effective in combat.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nMoon Girl and Devil Dinosaur[]\n\nThe Muzzlers made their debut in \"Like Mother, Like Moon Girl\", where they were the main antagonists. The Muzzlers introduced themselves to Moon Girl and Casey Calderon, after they were summoned to the city council by the council president Diego Pe√±a. According to The Beyonder, they created a device in their garage that is capable of dampening sound, called the Muzzler. And with the success of the Muzzler, they started an entire line of helpful home inventions and created a home-improvement show, using their inventions to help people \"Make their best homes!\" They are also revealed to be the owners of the car that Moon Girl stopped earlier. They plan to change the L.E.S. to be better and while Moon Girl is reluctant she agrees to make changes to improve the community. Moon Girl later confronts the Muzzlers and Pe√±a about the recent cease and desist orders and demands them to be dropped. However, Pe√±a refuses as the Muzzlers are donating a lot of money and admits that Community Captain is just a title and that she has no power. The Muzzlers are revealed to want to transform the L.E.S. into a quieter town through extreme gentrification. Moon Girl, then teams up with the community to fight back against the Muzzlers after they cancel their block party. Pe√±a finally stands up for himself and joins the community as the Muzzlers don flying gear to battle Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur. Despite using their sound dampener, Moon Girl and the community defeat them and she sends them straight to S.H.I.E.L.D. in their own A.I. car.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nTheir surname has numerous meanings. Aside from the fact that it is a reference to their obsession to muzzle sound, they are also meant to be the bare definition of gentrification and its effects in \"muzzling\" people from speaking out.\n\nThe Muzzlers appear to be parodies of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman based on their clothing and outfits. They even posses a floating jacuzzi that resembles the classic bathtub design of the Fantasticar.\n\nThe Muzzlers' voice actors, Paul Scheer and June Diane Raphael, are married in real life.\n\n[]\n\nMarcy Muzzler at the Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Wiki\n\nMarty Muzzler at the Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Wiki"
