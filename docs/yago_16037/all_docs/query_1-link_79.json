Everyone needs a little luxury once a month, these people you can’t even go to Chili’s and get dinner for under $100 I don’t think […]. How much is dinner at Chili’s? Brian, you must know.\n\nBrian 05:32\n\nFor one anywhere between like 30 and 100.\n\nRonna 05:36\n\nOkay, depending on whether you have a bottomless an insatiable bottom as you drink.\n\nBrian 05:41\n\nAnd dessert […] we’re gonna shuffle brownie bar.\n\nRonna 05:45\n\nAnd apposite, baszucki and I guess it depends on whether you have an insatiable bottom and Zucchi is that right?\n\nBrian 05:52\n\nAnd if if you’re having like five or six months slides, it’s sorted.\n\nRonna 05:56\n\nI’ll tell you a little secret, I do make myself laugh.\n\nBrian 06:00\n\nRonna you’re hysterical.\n\nRonna 06:02\n\nI’m my own best company. But I do, the problem is I need an audience. And that is where you come in.

No one would ever get that reference.\n\nRonna 06:31\n\nBut in that case, in that case, it’s really Max and David because they wrote all the lines on that check.\n\nBrian 06:38\n\nIt’s Max and David.\n\nRonna 06:38\n\nDavid and Max.\n\nBrian 06:39\n\nIt’s George and Gracie.

It was very, very funny. And myself because the truth is I am the picture of vitality so it didn’t bother me at all, I’m gorgeous, I’m lash. My skin is glowing. It didn’t bother me for a second. If I was close to that skilled Skeletor I can understand why I might have taken offense, but instead I just shrugged it off and said, Watch me skip over this panel, you know, yeah.\n\nBrian 07:34\n\nWell, don’t worry since I’ve been in New York I’ve seen literally that skeleton inside immerse on the Upper East Side pretty much every day.\n\nRonna 07:40\n\nZimas.\n\nBrian 07:41\n\nZimas.\n\nRonna 07:43\n\nA as social club as social club.com There are some incredible Halloween Padme there are some incredible holiday offerings so join us there all kinds of holiday offerings check it out.\n\nBrian 07:59\n\nAs also Is it okay to say who’s coming in on this December Kiki like what?

I wrote to my current acquaintance slash old high school friend and let them know that while honored to be asked, I’m not the right person for the job. Two of your points in particular resonated with me. Number one, Ron is saying you don’t really know this person not anymore. Two Brian’s saying, I feel like you don’t know if you want to do this, so maybe don’t. Ultimately, it wasn’t the right cast of characters involved. I don’t think I’ve completely shut the door on donating sperm in the future. I just the most disgusting phrase I have to tell you. And I’m a sperm owner. You know what I mean?\n\nRonna 12:41\n\nYeah, your response, you got your sperm lamb.\n\nBrian 12:44\n\nI’m a sperm maker. But now, I know it would need to be closer to in the present. And I need to make sure I’m comfortable with being a known factor in the potential child’s life. I also appreciated the additional thoughts of the bank bank baby writer that you shared on the recent episode 142. Ultimately, it’s the potential child’s point of view to consider first and foremost when weighing the pros and cons here. Thanks all for bestowing your wisdom upon me and guiding me through my decision making. In this get ready to throw up sticky situation.\n\nRonna 13:16\n\nWow, don’t use his name even if he said you could because shame on him.\n\nBrian 13:21\n\nKiss Kiss, how about that?\n\nRonna 13:24\n\nHow about no kisses?\n\nBrian 13:26\n\nNo, kisses don’t.\n\nRonna 13:27\n\nBut the letter I think put it? I think that’s correct. I think it all put it into context. And I really loved that letter that we did receive that we read for.\n\nBrian 13:35\n\nThe reason.\n\nRonna 13:36\n\nYes, and I think that that’s right, I would say don’t close the door on it. But the circumstances have to be right.\n\nBrian 13:44\n\nThat’s right, and Andy was saying how you should like and we got actually a lot of feedback about this how and he was saying like, really check the laws in your state and blah blah blah. But then someone said you don’t have a lot of lawyers listening to the show Ronna, I’ll say that.\n\nRonna 13:54\n\nOh, don’t get me started. I got a throat 30 page letter on Patreon. Someone now talking about what was it? What was the evidence?\n\nBrian 14:05\n\nI’ll send? I’ll say, I’ll say this.\n\nRonna 14:07\n\n30 page letter talking about you know whether Harvey Weinstein its penis was admissible as evidence.\n\nBrian 14:16\n\nWhat was the conclusion? We just need to.\n\nRonna 14:18\n\nI made the offhand comment which I stand by that his attorneys couldn’t have been too good if they couldn’t keep the pictures of his phony as gangrene out of court. And then that person who’s I don’t know, half a year law student decided to tell me they’re working on evidence now and discovery and explain to me how it worked, and I’ll explain something to you. If you can afford the right lawyer. I’m looking at you Donald Trump.\n\nBrian 14:41\n\nAnything’s possible.\n\nRonna 14:42\n\nThen your rules don’t apply anymore.\n\nBrian 14:47\n\nWonderful.\n\nRonna 14:47\n\nRight? the right lawyer and the right judge and that’s called America.\n\nBrian 14:52\n\nThere it is. I give America.\n\nRonna 14:56\n\nYeah, Miss America.\n\nBrian 14:57\n\nMiss America for sure, miss America is here.\n\nRonna 15:00\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian 15:03\n\nJune Diane Raphael right around the corner everybody.\n\nRonna 15:06\n\nI can’t wait let’s should we just get into it.\n\nBrian 15:08\n\nCan, why not?\n\nRonna 15:15\n\nWait a minute.\n\nBrian 15:16\n\nOh my God.\n\nRonna 15:17\n\nI don’t know where to start with the credits on this person because I was of course you know mainly prepares the bridge.\n\nBrian 15:24\n\nShe gets all the creditRonna.\n\nRonna 15:26\n\nIt’s adorable she prepares the bridge she sends to me the bio are just funny.

And I get on I guess today’s,\n\nBrian 15:40\n\nJDR?\n\nRonna 15:41\n\nYeah, but then I start reading then I start reading the bio and I think to myself, and words could be interchangeable as the first adjective.\n\nBrian 15:51\n\nRight.\n\nRonna 15:51\n\nScreenwriter, let’s throw that up top.\n\nBrian 15:54\n\nSure, opera coach.\n\nRonna 15:56\n\nMother of all podcasts.\n\nBrian 15:59\n\nMother of all podcast.\n\nRonna 16:00\n\nSelf appointed mother Volvo of all podcasts, throw that back up front.\n\nBrian 16:05\n\nWriter.\n\nRonna 16:05\n\nActress.\n\nBrian 16:06\n\nMovie actress.\n\nRonna 16:07\n\nOh, my […] watch Netflix, only if you watch movies, oh, sorry let’s get back to movie writer. Let’s get back to that, creator.\n\nBrian 16:15\n\nCreator.\n\nRonna 16:16\n\nInspirational speaker.\n\nBrian 16:18\n\nSound advice giver.\n\nRonna 16:20\n\nSelf help guru.\n\nBrian 16:22\n\nYeah.\n\nRonna 16:23\n\nDo people still say that?\n\nBrian 16:24\n\nYeah, the inspiration for JoJo Siwa.\n\nRonna 16:28\n\nAnd now we’ve now we’ve just learned off stage applier of sunscreen every two hours. She does every cancer that’s what you can do Creek Colorado.\n\nBrian 16:40\n\nThat’s true, the legendary sunless talent that is June Diane Raphael.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 16:47\n\nWell, gosh, I’m thrilled to be here and let me just start off with I think my most important credit which is applier of sunscreen and I do wish more people you know I don’t know Ran if you know that Gwyneth Paltrow received a lot of flack recently.\n\nRonna 17:02\n\nOh, well I know me.\n\nBrian 17:04\n\nJust recently?\n\nRonna 17:05\n\nHer two well her two vices. I have to laugh out but we’ll get into her for two seconds but her two vices herself you know proclaim devices as she has one cigarette once a week. On Saturday night she has a glass of red wine and one cigarette that sounds five and the other thing is that she just loves the sun and she can’t quite give up her glow. So she doesn’t wear sunscreen even though all she does is sell people things in order to make this skin better when sunscreen is the it is the absolute like. […]\n\nJune Diane Raphael 17:46\n\nWhat I’m so glad you brought that up because it is it is an interesting scam that she’s running she’s also reclusive supporter but that’s a whole let’s put that over there first for now but she.\n\nRonna 17:56\n\nShe did post a beautiful MC for the other day somebody posted.\n\nBrian 18:00\n\nShe did a mikvah?\n\nRonna 18:02\n\nWhile she posted did an Architectural Digest of her new home in Montecito and they went down to the bathroom. Somebody was reposting it as an anti Rick Caruso thing saying sure you should take her voter guide this is the life that she’s living in. It’s her in her bathroom quote unquote she has a spa that she built in the bottom of her house. But the funny thing about it to me you know he and I and binder and I have a funny little cute little DM relationship we sort of you know […] two Jewish girls having a couple jokes together here and again and I asked her she but she was actually the one who posted it I forgot $50 she didn’t give it to you know what she said you know on the rise everybody wants 50 bucks. But I wrote back to her and I said beautiful mikvah because she was giving the tour and saying maybe she could write it off haha not because she was a wellness guru but the bathroom really looked like basement Hamam. Honestly, at the Trump SoHo that was a feeling I was getting.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 19:06\n\nAnd I was disappointed I expect more from her, she usually has beautiful tastes but.\n\nRonna 19:10\n\nThat’s what happens when you put us back on your base but no.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 19:12\n\nIt’s very true.\n\nBrian 19:13\n\nAnd it’s like having an indoor pool.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 19:15\n\nWho needs it? It’s more trouble than it’s worth but she did something in a tutorial which you know, the internet went crazy over because she yes she hooks all of the skincare products through goop and she did her own skincare routine. And when I tell you, she put two drops, one on one finger one on the other of sunblock on the put it on her face. Now every dermatologist will tell you.\n\nBrian 19:44\n\nOverdo it.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 19:46\n\nYou need at least Brian a fingers, two fingers full of sunscreen.\n\nRonna 19:51\n\nJust for wow we’re gonna have to cut whatever that was we’re gonna have to cut it because that’s not the kind of show this is whatever that was. Whatever that is, so now I know now I can see what the problem is you’re competing with her are you running workshops too? That looks like listen.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 20:07\n\nAnd when I say I put it on every two hours, I don’t know that that’s true. I put it on every time I go on the car.\n\nRonna 20:13\n\nYes, you reapply? What kind of sunscreen are you using these days?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 20:17\n\nElta, you should not buy.\n\nRonna 20:20\n\nCould have said it before you.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 20:21\n\nYou should not buy on Amazon because there’s so many knockoffs there that are not the real deal.\n\nBrian 20:26\n\nI use that for [..] sport one because it’s by far the best one if you’re going to sweat by far.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 20:33\n\nOkay, do you find that that hurts your eyes at all?\n\nBrian 20:36\n\nNo, because it’s mostly zinc based that specific one, your eyes?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 20:41\n\nMy eyes are super sensitive. Yeah, they’re just piercing blue, I don’t know if you’ve ever seen them before but I.\n\nRonna 20:48\n\nHasn’t seen those, but he’s seen the Caribbean ocean so he knows what you’re talking to.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 20:52\n\nYou do know? There’s certain sunblock hurt my eyes. But yeah, she got a lot of you know, everybody went crazy over that because of course it is. It’s really the only case we need.\n\nRonna 21:04\n\nThere’s one dermatologist and I don’t know who she is but she started this whole piece size nonsense. My question is, why would you tell people to use less I can understand. If they use less, I suppose that’s up to them but I can’t imagine why your recommendation would be oh, don’t worry, I will last long.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 21:24\n\nListen, I don’t want to set myself up in an adversarial position to you, so why would care?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 21:34\n\nBut peace you find doing it with quizzes pparently.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 21:38\n\nI feel much safer there. I feel like I can sit in that conflict in a much more vulnerable way. But P size does make sense sense for something like retinol or red shirt.\n\nRonna 21:50\n\nThat’s piece I’m talking about sunscreen.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 21:52\n\nOkay, so if we’re just talking about sunscreen more as.\n\nRonna 21:55\n\nWell June, if life is a recipe.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 21:58\n\nOkay.\n\nBrian 21:59\n\nOh, God.\n\nRonna 22:00\n\nYou know we’re not saying you know, sugar other recipe calls for a cup of sugar put seven if you want. We’re just saying everything has its own little prescription and sunscreen is the sort of thing as I often say I’d rather be looking at it and looking for it.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 22:19\n\nYes.\n\nRonna 22:19\n\nI am Harry, I mean I’m porcelain.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 22:22\n\nYou really are your skin I can tell you block especially your hands which most people forget […]\n\nRonna 22:30\n\nI do to my hand, everything I do my face I did my hands when I’m done putting whatever in here I put it on here. And that’s how I wipe it off on the chest, my hands that’s my course.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 22:39\n\nOkay, because I’m I’ve really let I’ve let go and that’s an area like Courtney Cox, that’s something I regret, yeah […]\n\nRonna 22:48\n\nBut well, you never want the sort of person that can get a sliver of a sunburn. If I leave one little thing exposed, I’ll get a sliver burn.\n\nBrian 22:58\n\nWow.\n\nRonna 22:59\n\nAnyway.\n\nBrian 22:59\n\nThis is I have to tell you, I do think people are gonna masturbate to the last 10 minutes. There was something way too soothing about it. I have it was the people, I don’t know brothers.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 23:12\n\nAnd when masturbate only podcast?\n\nBrian 23:16\n\nAbsolutely, I feel like this is going to be the one. All the fruits who listen to the show, we call them fruits to listen to the show, who are going to be like, oh my God, they’re talking about skincare and they’re just going to take their skincare and go to town with it.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 23:30\n\nWell, it’s a good time to break for sunblock.\n\nBrian 23:33\n\nThat’s right. You know how this to be honest.\n\nRonna 23:37\n\nThis show okay, case you’re not familiar case. We have some new listeners, I don’t really know but I do think it’s important to be somewhat professional about it. Before we become very unprofessional.\n\nBrian 23:49\n\nI honestly feel like I’m sitting with two Ronnas I’m not kidding. There is something June’s voice is Ronna’s without the accent.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 23:57\n\nI know.\n\nBrian 23:58\n\nIt’s basically where he, like June when you were younger when you were like by 55 you’re.\n\nRonna 24:06\n\nSupposed to be suggesting I don’t look like June now, how dare you?\n\nBrian 24:09\n\nYou actually had a ball. Do you look exactly you and.\n\nRonna 24:12\n\nI just got telling you, I didn’t mind that you went as me as a skeleton as me for Halloween because I know how vital I look, so it didn’t bother me a bit. And here you are trying to call me old again. That’s not it, it’s very ages I don’t know what are you trying to do?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 24:29\n\nYeah, that’s the picture of you. Listen, I take that as some of the highest praise I’ve ever received.\n\nBrian 24:39\n\nYou might not really.\n\nRonna 24:42\n\nSound like me but without the accent June, said you’ve been told that before maybe you maybe have I need to know by.\n\nBrian 24:49\n\nGwyneth Paltrow.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 24:51\n\nYou will have to that oh, who we all know who are fans of Ronna who love Ronna who looked around for advice and you know path, have told me before that I’ve there are certain similarities.\n\nBrian 25:06\n\nYes.\n\nRonna 25:07\n\nI have noticed. I’ve noticed you.\n\nBrian 25:11\n\nYes, and there’s a thoughtfulness about what you say you think about what you but what.\n\nRonna 25:16\n\nI noticed that June has been nagging me a little bit.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 25:18\n\nRonna.\n\nBrian 25:20\n\nAre you serious?\n\nRonna 25:21\n\nThere we go.\n\nBrian 25:22\n\nHow’s this possible?\n\nRonna 25:23\n\nShe’s calling me Rona instead of Ron.\n\nBrian 25:26\n\nI know, but that’s because she’s familiar with you, it is.\n\nRonna 25:30\n\nIt’s just a little bit.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 25:31\n\nYou do know that everybody, I know you think that but just so you know, and I do know how it’s pronounced. But you know that there’s a lot of people in that you know, that I know, who do just refer to you as Ronna.\n\nBrian 25:46\n\nIt’s the nickname for Ronna.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 25:47\n\nExactly.\n\nBrian 25:48\n\nIt’s just one lesson.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 25:51\n\nIt’s just one lesson, and we do know how you pronounce it. And you’re right, I should be respectful. And I do think it’s important that people struggle through a name, actually, so I do appreciate being called in.\n\nBrian 26:02\n\nAnd not trying to run it. You wouldn’t even believe some of the stuff I see behind your back, it’s way worse.\n\nRonna 26:07\n\nOh, because they have cameras in the characters in any event. We have with here for everyone else today.\n\nBrian 26:15\n\nYes.\n\nRonna 26:16\n\nWe’re really specifically here for the three people that have written and because life has become too much for them. They don’t know Well, I mean, you know, we’re going to find out what people’s personal thresholds are because if they felt this was worth a letter, this is this might be the sort of thing that Jun cleaves out of her inbox in two and a half seconds. And these people felt they needed to write a letter they’re in crisis we could say they’ve got nowhere to turn. You come here you write on this to this show you come on the show you ask a question, you get an answer that’s all we promise. You are free dia to speak however you like about these people respectfully of course.\n\nBrian 26:58\n\nYou want to use apps.\n\nRonna 26:59\n\nDon’t be don’t be afraid to be honest.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 27:03\n\nThat’s right.\n\nBrian 27:03\n\nOkay.\n\nRonna 27:04\n\nBrian, dear.\n\nBrian 27:05\n\nDarling.\n\nRonna 27:06\n\nWould you care to read the first question.\n\nBrian 27:08\n\nI’d be honored dear Ronna and Brian and guest I’ve been a listener since the beginning Brian you’re absolutely fabulous on attitudes Ronna you’ve inspired me to buy my very first and hopefully not last Loro Piana sweater except they spelled the Malay era.\n\nRonna 27:24\n\nYeah it’s not a Loro Piana. I don’t know who Loro.\n\nBrian 27:27\n\nThey might have bought Loro Piana, Ronna.\n\nRonna 27:30\n\nI think Loro Piana is a second grade music teacher that too I think Laura P and.\n\nBrian 27:34\n\nOr piano.\n\nRonna 27:35\n\nOh, she just as Patty’s yeah, Laura, oh, Laura Pianos.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 27:38\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian 27:39\n\nYes.\n\nRonna 27:41\n\nThat.\n\nBrian 27:42\n\nI’m hoping you can give me perspective on a situation I’ve been struggling with for a couple years. I hate my best friend’s 11 year old daughter for Kant I met my friend Jessica. I met my friend Jessica through mutual friends when we were both 20 our friendship blossom first within our mutual friend group and then independently of it. We had so much fun together in our early to mid 20s getting drunk and grinding on randos. I was her maid of honor. Oh, you are so she’s either British or Canadian. And she was in my bridal party. I’m also the godmother of her daughter Brooke, who turned out to live in Michigan. Jessica 38 now and both happily married to our second and first husband’s respectively. Slip that in here’s.\n\nRonna 28:31\n\nI don’t know what that I don’t know, to be honest, the construction of that.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 28:35\n\nI couldn’t follow us on that second husband.\n\nBrian 28:38\n\nSo that her friend is on the second, she’s on her first.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 28:42\n\nOkay.\n\nRonna 28:42\n\nI think.\n\nBrian 28:43\n\nYet Jessica and I are 38 and happily married to our second and first husbands respectively. She mentioned Jessica first.\n\nRonna 28:51\n\nYes, I know but I don’t think she’s using the construction correctly, but anyway, we’ll soon find out.\n\nBrian 28:59\n\nHere’s the rub, I hate Brooke. I know this sounds harsh but she was she was a sweet baby and toddler but something changed in her when she was eight or nine. She started to become very boastful and entitlement and seems not to have any boundaries with their parents.\n\nRonna 29:15\n\nShe’ll tell her she doesn’t have any boundaries with her parents. That’s my favorite sentence, but an 11 year old that I.\n\nBrian 29:21\n\nKnow what are they supposed to do?\n\nRonna 29:24\n\nThis must have boundaries with her that they don’t even know the exact other way around, it’s my job to figure.\n\nBrian 29:31\n\nYour walks around being like we need to make the boundaries clear.\n\nRonna 29:33\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian 29:35\n\nShe’ll tell her parents their cooking is quote shit, tasteless. Sure, she’ll throw a tantrum. When she doesn’t get what she wants as a present for her birthday. She poured months every good. She poured her father’s Scotch collection all over the main floor of their house including on the dogs. I know they would never admit it. But I think both parents are scared of Brookie, I know a couple parents were scared of their one of their kids. Jessica will bring Brooke to friends events and we’ll have Brooke attached to her at the hip. Jessica will have her daughter sit with us girlfriends on the couches. We’re talking over a glass of wine. It’s weird, can’t really speak freely in the presence of a child. Brooke will also take any opportunity to grab attention by rolling her eyes dramatically and yawning while others are talking. To Jessica, you might be really boring. Most of the other girls don’t know how to.\n\nRonna 30:30\n\nWork gets enough personality for everybody.\n\nBrian 30:32\n\nMost of the other girls don’t know how to handle Brooke and just chalk her behavior up to precociousness. Jessica will wave off any critique of lugging Brookie along with her by saying she’s mature for her age. She’s one of the girls. I just think it does give an adult oh my god, they’re cooking his shit, you know what I mean? Kids don’t normally say that, so that is adult behavior. But the real reason I really hate Brooke is because she will target me when her parents aren’t. I was babysitting her once last year. And she told me this kid is mature, listen to this work instruction, this is a quote. She told me I was going to quote die sooner than most, because my eyes were too close together. She wants to call the haircut that I got, which was a stylish Bob fugly. We Jessica’s away from books will admit how difficult it can be to be a mother but one admit that she’s dealing with a demon child child. My question for you, can I tell just gotta leave Brooke at home? When I invite Jessica over? I don’t want her to expect. I don’t want to have to expect her demonic mini me to come with her love kid hater in Kansas.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 31:38\n\nOh, wow.\n\nBrian 31:39\n\nOkay, actually, June, I guess this is a personal question that you would never answer but are there any children, your children are around that you’re like, I’m not that good again.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 31:50\n\nSo I’m gonna be totally honest. So we’re gonna set I should be totally honest, Brian and I, I actually get very, I think we assume we live in a world that like loves children and prioritizes children. And I don’t think that’s true. And I very creeped out and uncomfortable by adults saying they don’t like a certain child. Which isn’t to say that children’s behavior isn’t of course challenging. But to ever approach a child as though they are a tiny adult is steamy says so much more about the Jessica’s of the world than the Brooks.\n\nBrian 32:30\n\nAnd I want to point out Jessica said she didn’t like her, she said she hated her.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 32:34\n\nYes, and now do I think it’s entirely reasonable to say, when extending an invite to your own home? No, you know, this is an adult only gathering kindly, you know, leave the children at home? Yeah, of course so we can create that person who has trouble with boundaries here to me is Jessica.\n\nBrian 32:57\n\nYeah, I actually think that’s really good advice of just a general sort of, or I don’t even think it’s offensive to be like, hey, can you and I have like a good talk without the kids or something like that would just be nice but, or, I mean, and also, you’re just gonna live with the fact that Jessica is sometimes going to bring her daughter life is fucking hard for parents.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 33:18\n\nIt just isn’t also like, yeah, of course, I’ve had experiences where there are certain kids that are more challenging than others to be around. But I am and kids who are really challenging to be around and it’s hard. But I’m like, I think there’s an expectation from adults, that children should like them, that children should be easy that children should behave in a way that adults deem is appropriate, that I find to be very, very odd and creepy.\n\nBrian 33:52\n\nI also think you really maybe don’t, I mean, this kid actually might be going through something, you know, I mean, that’s tough behavior, and you’re not the one who has to be running all the time, and the fact that you babysit a kid that you hate is bizarre, don’t babysit […] They know.\n\nRonna 34:08\n\nWell, that for sure, but my question is June if you found yourself alone with Brooke and she said to you don’t worry, you’re gonna die younger than most your eyes are really close together. What would you say to her?\n\nBrian 34:21\n\nYou’re right.\n\nRonna 34:23\n\nI just want to know because one of the main problems here is that Brooke is very is precocious and is smart, and Brooke can smell weakness.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 34:33\n\nWell, I think you’re.\n\nRonna 34:34\n\nShe smells it all over you and she’s having a blast saying things like this to you. And, and so I want to know, as someone who is self possessed doesn’t have trouble with boundaries. What you would do if you were alone with an 11 year old who said that to you?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 34:53\n\nNow listen, I have had 11 year olds. 10 year olds make me cry, like make me cry as a teenage babysitter. Okay, so I understand, you know, in some ways the approval of children is and when children are rude to you and saying personal things. I mean, I was coaching my son’s soccer team yesterday. And I had worn a very bright red lipstick earlier in the day, and I thought I took all of it out off of my lips, but clearly there was some on and this child came up to me and said, your lips are disgusting, and it looks like they’re bleeding in the middle.\n\nBrian 35:28\n\nOh, my God.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 35:32\n\nI’m not gonna lie, like I realized, like, oh, this stain from this red lipstick that I didn’t fully it was very matte. I couldn’t entirely get it off, was still there.\n\nRonna 35:46\n\nBecause it’s not hot enough to be a woman anyway, right? But I, I eat similarly as my child says something back.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 35:54\n\nAnd I was like, June if you fucking cry, right? Like, if you cry right now, I will never forgive you, you know? And if you show on any level that this pain to you, you’re such a piece of shit. So like, I got punch but Brian, it took my it took my breath away.\n\nBrian 36:20\n\nYes.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 36:21\n\nSo you know, in some ways, like, what is that fraying that saying? Out of the mouth of babes or whatever, like.\n\nRonna 36:30\n\nOut of the mouths of babes.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 36:31\n\nOkay, it’s like, you know that they are these little truth tellers.\n\nRonna 36:36\n\nClose together,\n\nJune Diane Raphael 36:37\n\nI don’t think my eyes are too close together. But I just some people struggle with that. And it sounds like Jessica’s eyes might be too close together. And that’s hard, you know, and I work very hard.\n\nRonna 36:59\n\nBecause you can also make a child cry very easily, which is not what I suggest. In other words, she’s always on the offense. But if you did decide to say something to her, like, you know, that’s not a very nice thing to say. She might actually cry.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 37:16\n\nYou couldn’t say that to her.\n\nRonna 37:18\n\nThis is what I’m saying though, is you have to be careful. But this goes to your point of treating children as children and not as grownups.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 37:26\n\nI think what I might add is like, well, I think you might be right and better and, you know, enjoy my time while I have it. The only thing or you can say like really she might respect that.\n\nRonna 37:39\n\nWell, there’s these are the main issues yeah, one, Brooke can smell weakness and fear all of so until you can shake that your target okay, I’m just gonna tell you right now, you’re not safe. You need to make it not fun for her. I’m not saying you have to overnight become a different person who’s full of confidence but you definitely need to find a way to not take which not take in what she’s saying to you. Because it’s not fun for her unless she poke you. How’s this is to limit your exposure?\n\nBrian 38:12\n\nHow about that’s a really.\n\nRonna 38:14\n\nAnd the other thing is say you have to find a way to find Brook funny.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 38:19\n\nWhat about this, she’s Brooke, she just says that I respond with hey, I want to just check in are you doing okay, that’s a really, that could be a really painful thing for someone to.\n\nBrian 38:32\n\nYeah, that’s good.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 38:35\n\nBrooke, are you I’m worried that you might not be happy. And then something might be going on because boy, that’s that’s a that’s a really upsetting thing to say to someone.\n\nRonna 38:46\n\nWe have to be comfortable with Brooke.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 38:49\n\nNo Brian […] really hurt my feelings.\n\nBrian 38:51\n\nOkay, I feel like a conqueror.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 38:54\n\nYes. Just like, hey, I’m floating above this. And I’m looking down, and I’m Brooke, I’m worried about you, baby girl.\n\nBrian 39:04\n\nRight.\n\nRonna 39:04\n\nYou could also just say, hey, Brooke, watch it.\n\nBrian 39:10\n\nHey, Brooke, I keep one eye open tonight if I were you. I’m a visitor.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 39:17\n\nYeah.\n\nRonna 39:21\n\nYou can say, hey, Brooke, it’s bedtime.\n\nBrian 39:25\n\nHey, Brooke, one word. Okay, we’re watching.\n\nRonna 39:32\n\nOkay, you need to find a way to find Brook entertaining. And you also need to find a way I completely agree. You need to have a cut, the problem is this person is living in a place where they don’t want to be in conflict, but they have a conflict. And you need to say to your friend, hey, I love Brooke she’s my god data, she’s not invited to taco night.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 39:55\n\nAnd we have to sit in that, yeah.\n\nRonna 39:57\n\nYou know, Brooke she’s so funny, Brooks’ the best, I don’t feel like talking about you know how how to achieve multiple orgasms in front of your 11 year old if that’s okay with you. I don’t feel comfortable. I don’t I don’t know if Brook is comfortable with it, but I don’t feel comfortable with it. That’s it, it’s and you have to put on yourself. Not on but brooke is oh.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 40:19\n\nWe can’t control Brooke […]\n\nRonna 40:22\n\nAnd not on your parent that friends parenting either, makes me uncomfortable. So are you saying that my daughter in an awkward situation?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 40:31\n\nNot at all.\n\nRonna 40:32\n\nBrooks the best, I know […] I can speak freely in front of.\n\nBrian 40:37\n\nYou could do a pour some sugar on me, and by that I mean this.\n\nRonna 40:42\n\nYou get who he is, I’ve got the cream.\n\nBrian 40:44\n\nLike the next time you see your friend Jessica or Brooke. Just be like, oh, hey, I’d give this up for Brooke I thought she might like it that way, A. you might get a good, B. the mother might be like she loves a Brooke, and then when you say let’s just hang out together, we’ll be weird, maybe butter broke up a little bit make her feel special.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 41:05\n\nI worry about that.\n\nRonna 41:09\n\nFeeding the monster.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 41:10\n\nYeah, and I think Brooke is smarter than that, Brian. I think she is.\n\nBrian 41:14\n\nShe’s very smart. She uses the word tasteless I mean, that’s pretty good.\n\nRonna 41:20\n\nHere’s the other word news dice. Brooke doesn’t like you either. And I also think Brooke sees you as competition. And I don’t know what her parents do, I don’t know how busy they are, I don’t have any comments about that, in the sense. Look, life is hard people work, I don’t have any comments about that. And every child reacts differently to different situations. But Brooke has figured out that her strategy for attention is being smart and funny. And she’s only 11 so that’s going to cross boundaries on occasion. Would it be worth that? Is that ruffles? Yeah, but the parents for the most part, I think these parents are probably not around that much or not around as much as Brooke wants them around, let’s put it that way. It doesn’t mean that they’re not around enough, it just means that Brooke wants more. And so Brooke has figured out a way to lash out and be charming about it. But you when you come into the situation you’re it’s the same imagine Brooke is six. And you’re standing in the grocery store, and you and your best friend run into each other and you start chat chat chat chat chatting, and Brooke is standing there all you know, three foot four inches of her. And she is tugging on her mother’s shirt because her mother is paying more who whom she has not seen all day is paying more attention to the person right in front of her and having a great time talking to her and not giving her that attention. And she wants that attention, now add five years to that picture, it’s just the reality of how she feels, it doesn’t mean that the mother should be doing anything differently, et cetera, et cetera, but she has figured out how to provoke a reaction from her parents. You don’t really want to be a part of that dynamic, so take yourself out of it.\n\nBrian 43:07\n\nOr be her agent, get her on Tik Tok, I guarantee you’ll make a million dollars off the status.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 43:13\n\nAlso an option.\n\nRonna 43:14\n\nI will pay, to go back to that strange sentence construction.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 43:20\n\nI also think it sounds like Brooke is the child of a divorce at a tender age. So I think just just trying to get into the interior life of Brooke and what might be going on behind the scenes.\n\nRonna 43:34\n\nI can’t even believe I’m really struggling, what that is so smart, that is so smart. Brooke has figured out how to put herself first in a situation where everyone else has put themselves first.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 43:46\n\nThat’s right.\n\nRonna 43:47\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian 43:49\n\nThat’s my motto.\n\nRonna 43:52\n\nWhich also makes me think that you could try Brian strategy for a minute to see if you give Brooke more attention if that if really that is what she craves. I just don’t think she wants it from you. But you never know. Your little Brooke wants to be seen. So maybe there’s a little something that Brookes into, I don’t know, a Tamagotchi, a Cabbage Patch Kid. You know, up snow cone machine. I don’t you know, I don’t whatever, you know, whatever it is now.\n\nBrian 44:25\n\nA ribbon/\n\nRonna 44:26\n\nJewelry, Kylie Lip Kit. I have no idea whatever it is. Laura Piano lessons, Laura piano lessons. Whatever it is, what it is. Yeah, you could try to you could try to say, Brooke, I knew you were coming and I did something special for you too. But I’d probably give her an iPad or book and say, turn it way up, here’s some notes. We’ll see you in an hour.\n\nBrian 44:55\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 44:56\n\nI also think Brooke is about a year maybe year and a half away, I’m just staying home at lunch alone, so I think that Jessica’s babysitting duties are, you know, quickly coming to an end.\n\nRonna 45:08\n\nYeah, but this mother is trying to have it all. Jessica’s, Brookes mother was trying to have it all going to wine night and bringing her data but not really spending time with the data. And I bet she never once said to her, how do you feel about me getting remarried?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 45:23\n\nOh, and I also think that yeah, Brookes mom is probably yeah, dealing with a lot of maybe dealing with some guilt of putting her daughter through this. And so thinking that she’s helping by taking her around.\n\nRonna 45:43\n\nThe good news is at the end of the day, Brookes gonna be fine.\n\nBrian 45:46\n\nRight, we’ve had her rise to the to actually.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 45:49\n\nI believe in Brooke, yeah, there are other variables, actually quite worried.\n\nRonna 45:53\n\nSo Brooke, I think Jessica’s a little jealous.\n\nBrian 45:56\n\nShe wants to be broke.\n\nRonna 45:58\n\nSo it was sometimes you meet a child and you think, wow, how do you already have more competence and have it more figured out than I do.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 46:04\n\nI have three handled that way, yeah.\n\nRonna 46:07\n\nYeah, and there’s sort of pretty natural children like this.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 46:11\n\nI think just as looking and thinking like, wow, that’s what it looks like to live out loud, you know?\n\nBrian 46:20\n\nHow refreshing\n\nRonna 46:21\n\nHow refreshing.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 46:23\n\nYes, and Jessica, every time she’s around Brooke can’t help but to be reminded that.\n\nRonna 46:30\n\n[…] this child I do.\n\nBrian 46:31\n\nOh, I wish I were the shot, I was basically like.\n\nRonna 46:34\n\nYou had this child now.\n\nBrian 46:36\n\nNow, because I am, now I am like, Yeah,\n\nRonna 46:43\n\nBut we’re not as as we’re not going to eat this, get it out of here.\n\nBrian 46:48\n\nYeah, which is why I think you’d be a good parent only for the very caustic discipline I would provide.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 46:56\n\nI mean, I do actually, I mean, I feel like I roll with a pretty, you know.\n\nBrian 47:00\n\nI believe it.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 47:01\n\nHeavy fist, yeah.\n\nBrian 47:04\n\nIn a good way I just very good parent.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 47:07\n\nWell, I am doing my best but I do I really do believe in, in discipline and firm boundaries. In schools, there are rules and I think children feel safe with them, and free with in the rules and boundaries of the home, but um, I so I have a feeling Brooke is actually feeling inside very chaotic, because nobody is telling her that her behavior needs to be knocked off and quick. And I think Brooke is going to be okay, but I feel for her.\n\nBrian 47:41\n\nYou know, I hope her parents have her in some sort of therapy or something transitional that can help you with this. I do want to say one thing about Brooke though, that I think even her mother is aware of.\n\nRonna 47:52\n\nWhat’s up?\n\nBrian 47:53\n\nI think Brooke smokes.\n\nRonna 47:57\n\nCigarettes?\n\nBrian 47:59\n\nI do and I think her mother is the.\n\nRonna 48:00\n\nJewel you think she’s on a Jewel?\n\nBrian 48:02\n\nI think she smokes cigarettes.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 48:04\n\nWow.\n\nBrian 48:05\n\nAnd I think I told her to stop it, she doesn’t know how to do it.\n\nRonna 48:08\n\nWell, then you can also if that is true, you can say to her. I know you smoke, next time she says anything. Do you just say I know you smoke.\n\nBrian 48:19\n\nThat’s exactly.\n\nRonna 48:22\n\nEven if she doesn’t see what she does. You could have a little fun with Brooke you say?\n\nBrian 48:30\n\nOh, I feel badly for Brooke I do.\n\nRonna 48:31\n\nI saw you take that cake.\n\nBrian 48:33\n\nYeah, totally.\n\nRonna 48:35\n\nYeah, anything,\n\nBrian 48:37\n\nI’m going to drop you off in this hand against house.\n\nRonna 48:41\n\nI do think ultimately, we ended up where we started, which is we have to have a little bit of we have to have a little bit of understanding and compassion for Brooke. Now, that’s the person who’s struggling, you’re grown up you better figure out how not to be afraid of an 11 year old and if you can’t, then you need to talk about that in therapy. Okay, you know what this is going to be a two question day is what this is going to be because I just realized we’ve spent a whole life talking about Brooke and sunscreen. I’ve enjoyed every second of it, but I actually just looked at the clock. I’m mostly going to read this question because I think it’s going to end up being ASMR for people.\n\nBrian 49:22\n\nOkay, whoa.\n\nRonna 49:24\n\nDo you run it and Brian and any guests you might have?\n\nBrian 49:28\n\nThis is not any guests.\n\nRonna 49:29\n\nIt’s not any guests, that’s the that is the gift […] the guests the get […] I just have to say we we didn’t even list your credits, but.\n\nBrian 49:45\n\nSo many credits that.\n\nRonna 49:47\n\nWe can’t list your credits and we didn’t let’s watch them and we were like so we will. Everyone knows all anyone who’s listening to this is listening to the Deep Dive and if they’re not, they don’t know what they’re doing with.\n\nBrian 49:58\n\nNo one Mr. Show for sure.\n\nRonna 50:01\n\nNo, […] buy a two pack.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 50:04\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian 50:06\n\nFor sure, not to mention how did this get me not to mention everything else.\n\nRonna 50:10\n\nI mean come on and then pardon me grace and Frank you know when you watch this show watch that.\n\nBrian 50:16\n\nWas it six seasons June?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 50:18\n\n7 Season, yeah.\n\nBrian 50:21\n\nUnbelievable to have the I mean, this is no shot but probably the two most iconic women in entertainment title.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 50:30\n\nYeah.\n\nRonna 50:31\n\nBut then also the the cast that they had below them. Absolutely incredible, I mean, sure such an ensemble this show. Okay, so Netfli they can watch it and if they’re not again, it’s if you’re not listening to Deep Dive if you’re not watching Grayson, Frankie if you’re not going to hide this get made live show. I don’t know what you’re doing and the characters are really down, she’s on a big van in that day.\n\nBrian 50:56\n\nExcept drugs, she’s on everything except drugs.\n\nRonna 50:58\n\nThat’s yeah, well, that we yeah, that way, that’s Jessica St.Clair we had a chat the other day about how she took one pill that at a half of a painkiller in it, and she lost it Brian’s but anyway, not important. First of all, I just have to sit we can get that. First of all, I just have to say that I love you to sell much and you really got me through the darkest days of the pandemic. You too deserve all the love and fans you get an MOA. But you know that already? Okay, doesn’t hurt to hear it. The regular episode ever, the characters episode are the highlights of my week. My question is about snacks.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 51:37\n\nOh.\n\nRonna 51:38\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I hang out there always too many snacks. And I feel like I can’t control myself around them.\n\nBrian 51:46\n\nMy boyfriend is wearing a dang dang.\n\nRonna 51:49\n\nThis is gonna you bet this is gonna.\n\nBrian 51:51\n\nI’m gonna have to do strap in.\n\nRonna 51:54\n\nThis is gonna hit you in the we started talking about two packs of Skittles, so this is gonna be.\n\nBrian 51:59\n\nLast Sunday, which is 711 got a pack of Sour Skittles came back to my place ate them. Went back out to 711 got another bag and a backpack.\n\nRonna 52:11\n\nYou know, you’re the kind of person gave me a full sleeve and snack candy.\n\nBrian 52:15\n\nAnd then it’s like, I can’t, no sugar at all alright, a monster.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 52:19\n\nI understood.\n\nRonna 52:20\n\nOkay, yeah so listen up, then this question is for both of you. My boyfriend is a big guy and well over six feet tall, while I’m a petite woman. His snacking style is more like a bear and he will wander around the house and graze on tasty snacks throughout the day. He likes to have a lot of delicious snacks on hand at all times both savory and sweet. And especially loves to have a big bag of popcorn or chips or whatever when he’s watching TV or a movie. On the other hand, my snacking style is unfortunately more like a chipmunk. And I can’t stop myself from stuffing my cheeks full of whatever’s around. Especially if it’s sugary. I’m not necessarily worried about gaining weight, congratulations, but my body isn’t very happy when I do this. Last year, when it was Jelly Bean season.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 53:14\n\nWhat?\n\nBrian 53:15\n\nWhat is that?\n\nRonna 53:18\n\nI guess that’s yeah, that’s be Easter. Oh, is there anything worse than a lodge Jelly Bean?\n\nBrian 53:23\n\nIt certainly was an Easter candy.\n\nRonna 53:24\n\nNot the literal jelly batch once meaning a big fat Jelly Bean you like? I don’t like any jelly beans.\n\nBrian 53:30\n\nI like Ibrox.\n\nRonna 53:32\n\nOh, you know last year.\n\nBrian 53:35\n\nI don’t want this to you, Ron.\n\nRonna 53:37\n\nWell, I you think you know person. Last year when it was just this the crust is too thick on a bra.\n\nBrian 53:43\n\nI liked the thick crust. I know the Jelly Bean.\n\nRonna 53:47\n\nLast year when it was Jelly Bean season. I ate almost a whole family size bag of jelly beans in about an hour.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 53:57\n\nWow.\n\nRonna 53:58\n\nAnd then had an awful dermatitis breakout on my face that it took months to get rid of. Sounds like we have a gut issue we have to look into. When we hang out, I regularly end up spoiling my dinner on such a funny sentence boiling my dinner for something.\n\nBrian 54:16\n\nLike children, yeah.\n\nRonna 54:18\n\nI regularly end up spoiling it but it’s a thing of spoiling my dinner or making myself queasy with things like gourmet Swedish Fish, sourdough pretzel bites, and especially chocolate covered nuts. Because of his snacking. I want to have some too, but when I do this, I just end up feeling bloated and grumpy. The problem is that I kind of cut myself off if I’ve had too much whereas my boyfriend is good at doing that for himself. I guess, I can only control myself if I know the snacks for somebody else. Like I’m making cookies for someone. I can usually manage not to eat all the cookie dough before it goes in the oven.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 54:57\n\nWow.\n\nRonna 54:59\n\nUsually this is all okay because we live separately, and so I’m not eating half a family size bag of m&ms every day or whatever. And I mostly only keep things like carrot sticks in my own place. But we’re going to move in together soon. And I don’t know how to deal with it. I’ve asked him in the past not to offer me snacks when we’re watching a movie, but I just ended up asking him for some anyway, because I can’t resist and he doesn’t want to feel like he’s in charge of what I ate, plus.\n\nBrian 55:28\n\nWhat you’re reading this Ronna?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 55:29\n\nI’ve never been so engaged.\n\nRonna 55:33\n\nPlus, he likes bringing me things he knows I like, especially candy, because I get so excited about it. Now, what do I do? I know Brian has mentioned that he can’t have sugary stuff in his house. But what does he do when he’s sharing space with somebody who else else who likes to snack?\n\nBrian 55:52\n\nDon’t rub it\n\nRonna 55:53\n\nIs that possible? Question mark, thank you, Maxine it is okay, if you call me this?\n\nBrian 56:02\n\nShe wants to be called wow [..] I’m wanting to say to this except that you’re not doing a thing wrong. But beyond that I really I need the advice your tail, so I’m actually with her with Maxine.\n\nRonna 56:16\n\nI wonder if June has a strategy?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 56:18\n\nWell I relate to this, I am I relate to you, Brian, like I grew up in a house where we didn’t have any snacks. And like the best you could do is a sleeve of you know saltines and diet Coke. So when anything sweet came in, like I remember a box of mallomars coming in and tacking you know and, and not being able to control myself around sweet and I remember going to other homes and seeing like oh my gosh, there’s cupboards devoted to snacks and sweets and believe that we’ve gotten out of that, yeah, that we can live amongst peacefully in communion with the Earth and the Sun and the meals like we can just know they’re there and not have to attack them or even if we’re not attacking them be so mentally in relationship in relation to the.\n\nRonna 57:21\n\nWay to eat a piece of old Halloween candy after right like.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 57:25\n\nI know I what I will say is Paul Scheer, my husband is similar to this to Maxine’s boyfriend because he can he likes having like I’m talking Costco size, tubs of m&ms and.\n\nRonna 57:49\n\nWow.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 57:49\n\nGiant packages of Red Vines.\n\nBrian 57:51\n\nControl himself because he’s in great shape.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 57:53\n\nHe does control himself, he doesn’t struggle with those things, you know, in the way that I do. But I will say I think she’s nervous about what it’s going to be like, and sometimes I think we’re to the scariest point is right now, before we’ve jumped off because I am now many years into living with Paul Scheer and living with snacks. And there are times you know, I’ve gotten into a bad cycle right now where every night I go over to that tub of m&ms and there are peanut m&ms mixed in there. I’m sorry, peanut butter m&ms, which to me are the elite, the elite […]\n\nRonna 58:38\n\nMuch better?\n\nJune Diane Raphael 58:41\n\nYeah, so I’ve gotten into a very interesting habit of before I go up and retire for the night. I go by that bin and I scoop whatever my hands can hold. It’s really a tub and a flight but it’s like a feeding bin for me where I just scoop.\n\nBrian 59:01\n\nMy fantasy as a child, but.\n\nRonna 59:04\n\nAt least you do it on the way upstairs because you can’t the shame is back down like Brian did last night.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 59:10\n\nThat’s it for you want practical solution and see if it hits and of course, you know.\n\nBrian 59:17\n\nI don’t want to die like I’m not ready to take, okay.\n\nRonna 59:20\n\nSo what have you bought, what packs of skittles the first time then what would happen?\n\nBrian 59:24\n\nI mean, you have to understand my childhood fantasy was literally literally to honor my jaw and pack my mouth with m&ms, and then start crunching that was little I would fantasize about when I was like.\n\nRonna 59:41\n\nGenuinely, genuinely. You want it to be a PacMan.\n\nBrian 59:45\n\nI used to like say it out loud to my sister. Wouldn’t it be so cool if we could just like I guess I didn’t say on your hands, but if we could open our mouths and pour all the m&ms into the mix.\n\nRonna 59:54\n\nHungry hungry hippos hungry.\n\nBrian 59:56\n\nExactly.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 59:57\n\nI understand that I’m going to show I’m gonna throw it out there, girl salute.\n\nBrian 1:00:00\n\nI would love this.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:00:01\n\nOkay, Emily wood and again, you know, toxic diet culture and I really I hate.\n\nBrian 1:00:06\n\nOh, of course.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:00:07\n\nI hate all of this but sometimes I’m also like, we have to work within the framework of our society and give ourselves certain tools, and this is me dismantling from the inside as opposed to be.\n\nBrian 1:00:19\n\nOh about.\n\nRonna 1:00:21\n\nReally am excited to hear how successful the strategies.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:00:26\n\nSo and I’m somebody who I are actually more towards salty than sweet, which is where the peanut butter m&ms for me that’s a great combination.\n\nBrian 1:00:34\n\nThat’s the spot.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:00:35\n\nBut so I have, you know, whatever my hands can hold. And I try not to put it in another container. You know, they say like, don’t ever go to a second location, like, just try to get where your hand can hold, okay, then have that and brush your teeth.\n\nBrian 1:00:56\n\nThat is always key.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:00:57\n\nOkay, that could stop you. It’s a nice barrier for me where it’s like if I’ve done my full we’re talking about sunblock. Let’s also talk about dental care. If I’ve done my my dental care, and I’m.\n\nBrian 1:01:10\n\nYour nighttime routine.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:01:12\n\nAll of my stuff, I don’t want to put another m&m in there. No, have I yes, of course.\n\nRonna 1:01:19\n\nHave I snacking all day? Well, you know what I would do a bear who is who is going on a fat layer.\n\nBrian 1:01:26\n\nI have a solution to a little part of it, for real. What I think you could do is because listen, after I eat a ton of sugar, which again, doesn’t happen a lot but when it happens, it fucking happens. I feel so fucked up the next day and my stomach is my body […]\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:01:48\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian 1:01:50\n\nIt’s fully bull betrayal. I think if you actually said out loud to your partner, like what happens when I eat sugar is it tastes so good, and then the next morning? I am on the toilet no less than six times that entire day starts solid and then goes to diarrhea.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:02:08\n\nOh my god.\n\nBrian 1:02:09\n\nAnd then I don’t think your boyfriend.\n\nRonna 1:02:11\n\nAnd then he won’t want to move in with you anymore.\n\nBrian 1:02:13\n\nSo you’re banned, he won’t want to give you candy anymore.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:02:15\n\nBut it sounds like her problem is not just sugar Brian because she’s talking about sour pretzels, and there’s a lot I mean, I think that’s definitely your problem, and we’re hearing part of me.\n\nRonna 1:02:29\n\nPart of me thinks they should go to Costco and spend $1,000 on snacks.\n\nBrian 1:02:35\n\nI just like too much exposure.\n\nRonna 1:02:37\n\nEverything to these two of these two these two of these, a barrel of these, put them in the cabinets. And how do we think she won’t even look at it after she gives herself the permission to buy?\n\nBrian 1:02:50\n\nThis is like the red signs in the office, it’s like who wants to keep that after a while anyway? Yes, so this is what happened to you, it was just so much of a good thing.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:02:57\n\nNow on I’m going to tell you that there are times especially according to my menstrual cycle where it is, it’s still super dangerous for me to have to live in this environment but.\n\nRonna 1:03:10\n\nPeople don’t have solutions to this problem. This is called this is the problem of this, and maybe this is fair to say and maybe it isn’t but it’s part of it is about being grown up. And we talk about this a lot, which is that people don’t really I don’t blame them. They don’t want to be grownups. And part of being a grown up is saying to your boyfriend I’m sorry, I can’t eat this much sugar. And I want you to be happy and I want you to snack and I know I have to not snack but what if you didn’t snack around me when this happens? Oh, what if we only snack when we watch movie? Oh, what if did that? But really at the end of the day? You’re the only one that who can say I can’t eat with you it’s abama well, but five one and a half and there’s no way to put it.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:04:03\n\nThere’s nowhere to put although it sounds like it’s not a weight issue, so it’s hard for me to take this.\n\nRonna 1:04:06\n\nNow but that thing I mean look anyone just feeling […]\n\nBrian 1:04:11\n\nSkin again it’s affecting your skin.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:04:14\n\nOkay that you’re right, I’m sorry.\n\nRonna 1:04:16\n\nWe skin is really the last, no skin is the only thing.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:04:21\n\nThat’s true, we started off with it I mean, listen, I’ve also had I’ve had boundaries with myself and I don’t know if this is helpful where every had. I’m just like, you know what, I’ve tried many times to go I love going to the movies, I love sitting in a movie theater it’s one of my great joys in life. And I’ve thought to myself June go to the movies today. And don’t get popcorn and just bring your own water bottle and sit there you’re you’re grown up and you can do it. And what I have realized is that I cannot.\n\nRonna 1:04:54\n\nI was going to say did you actually do one of those movies that’s what.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:04:58\n\nI will do it I’m not up he switched that so.\n\nRonna 1:05:01\n\nOr do or go to the movies in our popcorn.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:05:03\n\nAnd that’s what I’ve committed to.\n\nRonna 1:05:05\n\nFor breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:05:07\n\nYes, but I if I go to a movie theater, I must have popcorn and I must have a side of m&ms and then I mix it together. And that’s my treat and a Diet Coke. So it’s just like, that’s other things in life.\n\nRonna 1:05:23\n\nI know right? isn’t gonna be any better. A kid like my added to that he’s gonna be.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:05:28\n\nBrushing as though it was gonna be some major solution.\n\nBrian 1:05:31\n\nI know it does and I’m not […]\n\nRonna 1:05:35\n\nUnfortunately, it starts with you. That’s all it is. You’re the only one that can stop you, I guess you could try hypnotism I’ve never done it.\n\nBrian 1:05:45\n\nYou’re the CEO of Maxine, that’s right.\n\nRonna 1:05:48\n\nYeah, it starts with you, but you can say to him, I mean, look, okay, he doesn’t gain any weight. Does he need to eat all day long like that? Probably not. I mean, you could say to him, you could say, it does make it hard for me. And he might say, oh, I’m sorry, I’ll just do this or that, because he doesn’t mind when he snacks when he does snack or he might just say, this is how I am, I don’t know what to say.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:06:14\n\nListen.\n\nRonna 1:06:15\n\nI have to do that either way.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:06:17\n\nYes, I think you know, a really strong partnership. The foundation is both of you trying to make each other’s days as good as they could be. So hopefully, he will really hear that and support.\n\nBrian 1:06:30\n\nAnd one tip that I’ve heard about that’s really healthy as if you soak cotton balls and orange juice and swallow them. Apparently, that really helps, if you guys never heard this, that’s what models do […]\n\nRonna 1:06:40\n\nI told Mr. Cleveland the other night that I wanted something sweet, and he said how about an orange? I said.\n\nBrian 1:06:48\n\nGo fuck yourself.\n\nRonna 1:06:51\n\nYou should I said you should you should leave now.\n\nBrian 1:06:56\n\nLately, all right, June here’s the deal we love to having you on to join. Please follow Jim everywhere but also, at the end of every show, June we pick one of the letter writers who we think deserves a little something nice, like so we’ll send them a candle or send them a you know, body care thing or whatever. So do we want to send something to we don’t have to find out what it is yet, but do we want to send something to Maxine who we just discussed? Or do we want to send something the snacker? Or do we want to send something to.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:07:26\n\nJessica?\n\nBrian 1:07:27\n\nYeah, who’s dealing with.\n\nRonna 1:07:31\n\nWet noodle.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:07:32\n\nI mean, my vote is for Maxine, especially because she seemed Maxine’s in crisis. She’s in crisis and also like I relate to the personality type that just wants a treat, I think she needs a treat. You know, I love getting treats.\n\nRonna 1:07:49\n\nSo you want to send her a treat even though her problem is all she’s doing is treating.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:07:54\n\nI don’t think it’s a it’s a food treat alone maybe I don’t know what you all I know what we say.\n\nBrian 1:08:01\n\nWe’ve done gold belly and stuff before.\n\nRonna 1:08:03\n\nNo we’re not sending her food was sending her a gorgeous Kinto water bottle. We’re inspired by Brian because she has.\n\nBrian 1:08:13\n\nYou’re making fun of it Rona.\n\nRonna 1:08:16\n\nWas making fun of you Brian, not the beautiful water bottle. Just you and the way that you flip it open and flip it closed. But I think if she had a gorgeous vessel that she felt excited to fill up, she might be able to sit in her wellness a little bit and look over the only thing I don’t want her to do is look over at the band become disgusted by the bear she has to keep an eye on that, that’s because that can happen when you’re taking care of yourself. You sometimes the governor people and think oh you’re just gonna keep shoving stuff. When all you want to do is be doing the same thing but you have to go full in the other direction and find a way to despise them in order to feel good about yourself but don’t do that. What I’m suggesting is you have a gorgeous water bottle and that you feel excited about filling it up with either tea or water or whatever your treat is going to be for yourself and that you just sit in that a little bit. I get that a shy of such when it doesn’t work, try the scoop, June the June Diane patented scoop, give it see how that goes. But if you get a drink that much sugar you do need to drink a ton of water, that’s just a fact.\n\nBrian 1:09:24\n\nFollow her at June Diane, also everything’s trash. We didn’t even talk about that you’re on every crash so you everyone can watch that too.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:09:31\n\nThat’s right that’s unfree forum with Phoebe Robinson it’s such a wonder.\n\nRonna 1:09:35\n\nWhat about the pickleball tournament? We didn’t talk about that.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:09:38\n\nAnd yes, I don’t know when this will come out, but there’s.\n\nRonna 1:09:41\n\nThis is coming out into on November 15. Okay, perfect celebrity pickleball. June Diane is in a celebrity pickleball tournaments going to be on Paramount plus, and Stephen Colbert is the Howard Cosell, so it’s an Amana.\n\nBrian 1:09:58\n\nNovember 17, it’s called pickled.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:10:00\n\nIt’s called pickled, it was so much fun, so yeah, I would encourage everyone even if you’ve never even heard of pickleball to watch it I’m playing I’m competing. And that was a blast thank you both so much for having.\n\nRonna 1:10:15\n\nA new battle of the network stats. We adore you keep up all the incredible fabulous work I don’t know where you find all the energy but I’m delighted that you do.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:10:25\n\nThat’s my scoop m&ms.\n\nBrian 1:10:27\n\nYeah.\n\nJune Diane Raphael 1:10:28\n\nKiss Kiss.\n\nBrian 1:10:32\n\nShe’s one.\n\nRonna 1:10:33\n\nThere’s nothing to say.\n\nBrian 1:10:34\n\nThere really isn’t?\n\nRonna 1:10:35\n\nI’m worried about Madeline but I think she’s gonna love her Kinto water bottle and I want you to know it’s not just a water bottle it’s actually a flask.\n\nBrian 1:10:43\n\nIt’s actually a lifestyle.\n\nRonna 1:10:45\n\nBecause it’s hot and it is lifestyle. And I want you to know I’ve people should know this, I bought one as a little joke I got one for me one for Naomi in one facility two priests waiting for the key k because I was being Brian and Naomi was being Brian were both being.\n\nBrian 1:11:02\n\nThey were both fruits.\n\nRonna 1:11:03\n\nAs a strawberry she was a banana fatten, and I said we have to make sure we have Kinto water bottle because Brian’s always moving around.\n\nBrian 1:11:11\n\nTo stroke.\n\nRonna 1:11:13\n\nAnd it was so gorgeous, I have to say I bought two.\n\nBrian 1:11:17\n\nAren’t they wonderful?\n\nRonna 1:11:19\n\nAnd I’m actually considering having some personalized and selling them for fans.\n\nBrian 1:11:26\n\nThis is what I’m talking about.\n\nRonna 1:11:29\n\nFinally, it’ll be the first Brian’s buy a piece of merchandise.\n\nBrian 1:11:32\n\nBrian inspired but not Brian. Brian didn’t think of it.\n\nRonna 1:11:36\n\nThinking about it cuz they’re gorgeous. The one I got it’s not the color I would do five for our fans, but I loved it, it’s sort of a creamy olive color. Because it’s so gorgeous ya know the craftsmanship. I even bought a couple of baby steps she’s not quite ready for them yet.\n\nBrian 1:11:51\n\nShe isn’t ready for something like that yet Rona.\n\nRonna 1:11:53\n\nYeah, no, she’s ready for that level of luxury. Well, problem is that the flask is too big it’s too many ounces right now but she’ll grow. I’m saving them for her so that she can continue to be the world’s chic as toddler.\n\nBrian 1:12:06\n\nShe’s pretty chic, I’ll give you that. Should we do a Rona.\n\nRonna 1:12:09\n\nI wish you would, I’m tired of waiting.\n\nBrian 1:12:11\n\nDear Mrs. Glickman, Lady Bran and thoughtfully a fabulous guest, here’s Mike.\n\nRonna 1:12:16\n\nWhich we just had, but she’s just taken off, yeah.\n\nBrian 1:12:18\n\nShe’s wonderful, is there a nicer appropriate way to tell my sisters long term boyfriend to shut up background? The boyfriend in question is loud and never stops talking. He’s a no at all, and if he doesn’t know it, he’ll look it up and read you the Wikipedia word for it. This also means he’s an energy vampire.\n\nRonna 1:12:37\n\nOh boy.\n\nBrian 1:12:39\n\nHe hijacks every, and then she puts C or he put C Colin Robert Robinson from what we do in the shadows, he hijacks every conversation and turns it into a boring lecture about the topic of his choice. He runs every joke into the ground within an hour repeating what he would surely call an inside joke until you want to stab your ears with sharp pencils. His worst offense though is that he ends up nearly silencing my sister. We live in different states and don’t see each other that often, so our time together should be precious. Unfortunately, I feel like I spend no time with her during our visits. Even though she’s there, she says very little, which was not like her previously, I will admit I oftentimes retreat in her during these visits, because I don’t want to compete for talking time. My husband and I have made a point to try to engage her directly ask her questions that don’t involve him. We ask about our work, she’ll start to respond and he’ll talk over her and take over answering the question for her, it’s very frustrating. Every inch of me wants to look him dead in the eyes and tell him to go scratch, I love my sister, and this is your chosen partner. I bet you she’s starting to realize my husband and I might not enjoy his company. I also worry our parents see us their real peacekeepers repress all conflicts, so they’d never say anything. I don’t want to hurt her by telling him to pipe down but I wonder if they spend their lives together. If they if they spend their lives together, how we will go on in our relationship. There’s also a part of me that wonders if she gets annoyed with him and is happy in this relationship. I realized this is a big jump and it could be way off and she’s thinking she’s unhappy just because I find him to be too much, and she could find his excessive chatter charming, is it worth addressing this with her? Is there a way to do so without being offensive?\n\nRonna 1:14:12\n\nWhat’s this?\n\nBrian 1:14:14\n\nIf someone spent the weekend.\n\nRonna 1:14:16\n\nTell me what’s do me a favor, send me a brief follow up and tell me.\n\nBrian 1:14:19\n\nWhat this is ?\n\nRonna 1:14:20\n\nYeah, it’s worth addressing this with her.\n\nBrian 1:14:24\n\nThat you don’t like her partner?\n\nRonna 1:14:26\n\nHim.\n\nBrian 1:14:27\n\nYou don’t like him?\n\nRonna 1:14:28\n\nYes, the whole person, yeah.\n\nBrian 1:14:31\n\nIf someone spent the weekend with myself and my husband and then asked if I was happy in a relationship, I would be mortified, sure. There are times where she seems annoyed with him or the topic of engagement has come up and she’s ignored his gentle but inappropriate teasing about a proposal. I just want what’s best for her but also don’t want to harm our relationship.\n\nRonna 1:14:49\n\nI just worked best for her, but I just want him to shut the F up.\n\nBrian 1:14:53\n\nAnd I just want what’s best for me, yeah.\n\nRonna 1:14:55\n\nAnd I just want the two days a year I spend with them to be better.\n\nBrian 1:14:59\n\nYeah, I try very hard to put on my best face and smile through his endless talk but end up feeling overwhelmed by day two and worry as time goes on my patients will dwindle even more. Oh no, I just realized this has gotten lengthy, who’s the energy vampire now? I see how these long winded letters happen. I want to give out the details to give you a complete picture of the situation and honestly that all my frustrations but I’ll end it here. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated, thank you, Tanya. Not my real nice give it I saw off the scent.\n\nRonna 1:15:26\n\nI see how these long letters happen, but yet I still don’t go back and edit my email because I typed this on a typewriter.\n\nBrian 1:15:33\n\nLet me end it by telling you how long it is.\n\nRonna 1:15:36\n\nYeah okay, in all seriousness, we will answer this on patreon.com/askronna, it is absolutely one of the hottest Patreon in the UK.\n\nBrian 1:15:49\n\nAnd it’s also [..] there was a buck.\n\nRonna 1:15:52\n\nThey told us, I can’t remember what they told us that we are within the top, I don’t know 1% Patreons, and that we have the highest I can’t remember now conversion rate. Meaning that people that come to our Patreon and really love it and they all listen to it and engage with it. And of course, that’s no surprise to us.\n\nBrian 1:16:14\n\nNo surprise at all.\n\nRonna 1:16:15\n\nPeople need to remember that if they sign up for the Patreon they get the free ways what we do the ways for them absolutely comes in their initial email.\n\nBrian 1:16:23\n\nSignup, Asana, they get the bonus videos, if they sign up for the $5 a month, you get a new episode every single week.\n\nRonna 1:16:34\n\nIt’s really too much, and believe me if Brian was negotiating his contract now it would be one a month it wouldn’t be for a week for a month for week, one a week. It just wouldn’t, and I’m not sure it would be if I was negotiating my own contract.\n\nBrian 1:16:47\n\nNo, I’m very happy with the page.\n\nRonna 1:16:49\n\nBut it doesn’t matter because I’m going to start charging, you know, entry level into the Carriage House in January is going to be about $18, that’ll be entry level. Yeah, that will just be entry level.\n\nBrian 1:17:00\n\nYeah, I mean that’s just to get in.\n\nRonna 1:17:02\n\nYeah, I mean, I’m just thinking about it, you know, just thinking, what else? Are they spending $18 a month on that they get four episodes where people are pouring their heart out? I will tell you this, someone wrote on it, and we’re going to start this in January, I think we’re going to we put the book club on pause for a while, but I think we’re gonna go back and start doing the long form articles. I’ll tell people now.\n\nBrian 1:17:27\n\nI love that idea.\n\nRonna 1:17:28\n\nWe read a piece of long form journalism, and then talk about it and maybe we have an expert on it with us, and maybe we don’t, but someone suggested a piece on the Patreon boards, and I started reading it, and it is incredible.\n\nBrian 1:17:45\n\nOh, fine.\n\nRonna 1:17:47\n\nt’s about I haven’t finished it yet, so don’t spoil it for anyone but it’s about a chef in upstate New York or Hudson County, I guess, Hudson Valley ethic, who was running a restaurant supposedly out of his house. And that everything was supposedly every inch of this restaurant was supposedly came from the farm. The food that this that the you know, […] the mushroom spores that are on and anyway, I just fell asleep at the moment where it’s about to take a turn, and I honestly, I didn’t even read the rest of it last night, because I’m so excited to read the second half of it, that I skipped a night you know, something’s good when you don’t want to read anymore.\n\nBrian 1:18:31\n\nTotally when you’re saving.\n\nRonna 1:18:32\n\nYeah, it makes any sense, so that is what the long form article club’s gonna be. We’re gonna read a piece of long form journalism, we’re going to talk about it, people can send us the questions, the comments, but this patreon.com/ronna ai Social Club, it’s really only for people who care about themselves, so.\n\nBrian 1:18:49\n\nThat’s true.\n\nRonna 1:18:51\n\nYeah, and I do, of course, understand that it can be a big commitment for people to sign up for the three months. But I want to remind everyone, you could always dip in and out and do a one off box anytime you want to. So that’s AI social club, you get invited to the Kiki for that month, etc. I adore you, I think you’re incredible, I have I think we haven’t even barely talked about Ronica. And when that’s going to be but you better believe it’s coming. If people want to send us any of their Ronica suggestions, they should do it this minute because I think we’re going to be recording ASAP. And that would that would go to ask ron@gmail.com and of course we’re just so excited for holiday and to spend the holiday season with you all and then in January we will we will take a scheduled break.\n\nBrian 1:19:39\n\nThat’s right.\n\nRonna 1:19:40\n\nBut not Patreon, we never take a break from pain.\n\nBrian 1:19:42\n\nYeah, we’re always going on the page.\n\nRonna 1:19:43\n\nWe’re always going on the Patreon so it it’d be missing the holidays. This would be your moment, and I think we’re also going to do a couple of fun feed drops maybe over the holiday week where we will give you a few episodes of other people’s things that we love so that they have something fun yeah, coming up. Our idea I adore you.\n\nBrian 1:20:04\n\nI love you Ronna.\n\nRonna 1:20:05\n\nAnd I just can’t wait to be in person with you once again 2024.\n\nBrian 1:20:09\n\nSo I’m going to set you mean 2023.\n\nRonna 1:20:13\n\nOh 2025.\n\nBrian 1:20:16\n\nWhat are you talking about Ronna? We’re not taking a year long break.\n\nRonna 1:20:20\n\nWho knows? I mean, who knows? No, we’re not, but I am starting to get excited about my Eastern Europeans journey. Remember I told you I was going to east?\n\nBrian 1:20:29\n\nWhen are you going?\n\nRonna 1:20:29\n\nI’m not wearing my fur.\n\nBrian 1:20:32\n\nJust wanted to stop talking about that.\n\nRonna 1:20:34\n\nYou know what I tell Joe that it’s like I’ve had it a long time and I just want to wear it and I don’t want anyone to look twice at me and I and I think that’s okay.\n\nBrian 1:20:45\n\nI do not.\n\nRonna 1:20:46\n\nI can’t put the coat back in the woods, you know what I mean?\n\nBrian 1:20:50\n\nI do know what you mean actually.\n\nRonna 1:20:51\n\nYeah, did you have something else you wanted to say?\n\nBrian 1:20:55\n\nNot anymore.\n\nRonna 1:20:57\n\nOkay, all right Skittles, that’s what I’m calling, okay Skittles.\n\nBrian 1:21:06\n\nBlackmail, all right yes."
