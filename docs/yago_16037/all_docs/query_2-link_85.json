        "text": "Nat Faxon has wedding fever.\n\nThe actor will go from FX’s Married to NBC’s Marry Me, booking a guest turn on the freshman comedy, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nThe comedy stars Casey Wilson and Ken Marino as a longtime couple who get engaged — only to learn that planning a wedding is harder than it looks.\n\nFaxon will guest star as Scooby, Wilson’s cousin, in a Bride Wars-themed episode inspired by the movie, which was written by Wilson, the Happy Endings alum; her writing partner, June Diane Raphael; and Greg DePaul.\n\nPHOTOS Broadcast TV’s New 2014-15 Shows\n\nThe episode centers on Annie (Wilson) and her newly engaged father (played by Scandal‘s Emmy winner Dan Bucatinsky) who learn that awesome cousin Scooby can only take off work to attend one of their weddings. The duo then engages in a “bride war” over him.\n\nA specific airdate for the episode has not yet been determined, but the earliest it could run is in December.\n\nFaxon currently stars in FX’s freshman comedy Married, opposite Judy Greer, and before that, starred in Fox’s Ben and Kate. He won an Oscar for The Descendants, which he co-wrote alongside Alexander Payne and Jim Rash.\n\nThe Married season finale airs Thursday at 10 p.m. on FX. Marry Me, from Happy Endings creator Wilson and her husband, David Caspe, debuts Oct. 14 at 9 p.m. on NBC.\n\nFaxon is repped by WME, Principato Young and Stone Meyer."
