While speaking about their long marriage, she joked that they had been together for \"too long.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJune Diane Raphael is a screenwriter, comedian, actress, and co-host with extensive projects. These projects include parts in \"Unfinished Business\" and \"Year One,\" as well as co-writing \"Ass Backwards.\"\n\nShe and her husband, Paul Scheer, a successful actor among other professions, co-host the \"How Did This Get Made?\" podcast along with Jason Mantzoukas.\n\nPaul Scheer and June Diane Raphael at the premiere of \"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse\" on May 30, 2023 in Los Angeles. | Source: Getty Images\n\nJune Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer's Marriage\n\nRaphael and Scheer married on October 10, 2009, and have two children. While discussing marriage, the actress claimed she is happier being officially wed than when she was single. The actress expressed:\n\n\"I'm happy to be married I have no desire to be single—I really don't.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe claimed to look back at her twenties as a time full of making the wrong decisions. The couple had met in 2004 at Manhattan's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaphael has also jokingly stated that she and her husband have been together \"too long,\" adding that the pandemic automatically adds five years to one's marriage. Speaking about their careers, the actress said:\n\n\"Someone's always up, and someone's down. So someone's found out amazing news and got the job they wanted, and someone's devastated, so we're never quite on the same emotional wavelength in terms of our careers, but, in many ways, that's great because you have someone who's usually always happy in the house pulling someone up.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Paul Scheer's Career and Personal Life\n\nBeyond podcasting and acting, Scheer is also a comedian, producer, and director. His career began picking up when he started making short films with Jason Woliner, Aziz Ansari, and Rob Huebel.

After the actress gave birth and following her mother's death, she began suffering from postpartum depression. In an essay on the topic, she wrote:\n\n\"One thing I know is my mother suffered from postpartum depression after she had me. She told me, so I know. I know this for sure. The way she described it, for three months she felt gray—and then one day, in our kitchen, she bent down to adjust her shoe, and when she got back up…the gray had lifted. Just like that. It was gone.\"\n\nGus was followed by the birth of their second child, Sam, in 2020, with the two joking: \"We are so excited to welcome our new baby©. He's© available for all endorsements and sponsorships.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaphael spoke about her approach to parenting, stating that she is open with her children and that they have ongoing conversations about gender fluidity. She stated:\n\n\"I always say I have two boys until they tell me otherwise. I'm not committed to their gender.\"\n\nThe mother also said that she and her sons speak about kindness, vulnerability, and the softer aspects of being human, as she noted that boys are not encouraged to tap into these gentle parts of themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJune Diane Raphael's Heartwarming Instagram Moments with Her Husband, Paul Scheer\n\nRaphael has shared multiple Instagram pictures of her and her husband.
