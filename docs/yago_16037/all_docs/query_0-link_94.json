        "text": "I could really go on and on with more adjectives, but the title made my point. If you judge people by the company they keep, then June, who is BFF‚Äôs with Casey Wilson, married to Paul Scheer, and collaborates/works with/pals around with some of the nicest, funniest, and most talented people in comedy, film, etc, then you know she is to be judged top-notch, true blue, A+. She is an actress (Year One, Going the Distance, Party Down), comedienne (Human Giant, UCB, Funny or Die), and writer (Bride Wars, the upcoming indie Ass Backwards, and the Ruben Fleischer directed The Bachelorette Party). I wanted to talk with June in a super casual manner, interview her where time wasn‚Äôt a problem and we could have a little fun. So with her in LA and me in Dallas, I thought the perfect solution would be to do what we all do with our friends everyday: IM. We might just be the first people in the world, who are we kidding, we ARE the first people in the world, to ever conduct an interview over gchat. Just typing away in that quick chat lingo, getting fresh with some emoticons, NOT using LOL, and anxiety struck about how the grammar and spelling would turn out in all this. It was fun. Most importantly though, we all now get to know June Diane Raphael a little better.\n\n____\n\n____\n\nJune Diane Raphael: Hello friend!\n\nSerial Optimist: Hello! How are you June! Thanks so much for taking the time to chat it up!\n\nJune: Of course! I may have IM‚Äôd too soon, let me run to the bathroom and I‚Äôll come right back. #111111111\n\nSO: Yeah get that bathroom break out of the way!\n\nJune: She‚Äôs back!\n\nYou wanted this to be in the third person, right?\n\nSO: Haha, yes, you always talk in the third person right? Like to everyone?\n\nJune: There‚Äôs no other way. Tried first‚Ä¶way too intimate.\n\nSO: So how is the New Year treating you so far?\n\nJune: So far so good. Titled this year ‚Äútaking it up a notch‚Äù. In all areas.\n\nMy friend Drew Droege‚Äôs title for last new year was ‚Äúbe kind to animals‚Äù.\n\nSO: I like both of those. Mine is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt overdraft‚Äù.\n\nJune: Haha! Man, that‚Äôs how they get you. Don‚Äôt get me started with Bank of America.\n\nSO: That‚Äôs who I‚Äôm with!\n\nJune: And overdrafts.\n\nGet out!!!\n\nNow!!!!!!!\n\nFor real, they are the worst.\n\nSO: No doubt. So you know what I didn‚Äôt know about you, is that you‚Äôre married to Paul Scheer right?\n\nJune: Yeah.\n\nDo I seem cooler now?\n\nSO: Well it was funny to me, because I love Paul and am real appreciative of him, and I‚Äôm also a big fan of yours, and how generous you have been. But I never put the connection together, and just noticed it last night.\n\nBut yes, you are cooler now, for sure.\n\nJune: This is actually Paul writing from June‚Äôs computer. She‚Äôs not allowed to use the computer on Wed. It‚Äôs one of my many rules.\n\nAnd you‚Äôre welcome for those e-mails.\n\nSO: Thank God. I didn‚Äôt really want to talk to her anyways.\n\nShe‚Äôs always talking in the third person. Asshole.\n\nJune: Its June‚Ä¶I just slipped Paul his nightly roofie (a few hours early) so I can talk (for seven hours).\n\nWe‚Äôve got time. Unless he wakes back up.\n\nSO: Well be really quiet! Tell me a little bit about yourself. I try not to sound to wiki-esque when I ask questions like this, but its hard not to. Where did you grow up? What were your teenage years like? And is asshole one word or two, like ass hole?\n\nJune: Asshole is definitely one word. Phew. Got the hard question out of the way.\n\nI grew up in Long Island in a town called Rockville Centre. Aside from being this height (i‚Äôm 5‚Äô9) at twelve and having an Irish head so big they had to specially make a batting helmet that fit me in softball, my teenage years were idyllic.\n\nStill have all of the same girlfriends. About five of us from middle school on, which is pretty awesome. I have two wonderful sisters and amazing parents, so I can‚Äôt complain‚Ä¶. Working through your run of the mill Catholic guilt, but other than that, I feel incredibly lucky!\n\nSorry I‚Äôm not writing in complete sentences! This is going to sound like it‚Äôs written by a five year old. üôÇ\n\nSO: That‚Äôs great. I had (and still have) a huge head as well. I‚Äôm not into hats. Don‚Äôt worry about the sentences, that‚Äôs kind of what I thought would make this fun, like this is how people talk to each other, much more fun than standard questions and answers. Or we will see. This is the first interview I‚Äôve done like this. It could ruin both of us, really.\n\nJune: Haha!\n\nBy the way I don‚Äôt write lol. I write haha!\n\nSO: Ok, seriously, so do I. I can‚Äôt ever bring myself to type lol. I‚Äôm haha all the way. Sometimes I really feel the urge to use an emoticon in texts, because I think they are really cute..love it how girls use them.\n\nJune: üôÇ\n\nWe should conduct this interview with only emoticons.\n\nSO: What emotion is this? üòÄ\n\nHungry?\n\nJune: I think that‚Äôs actually a serial killer.\n\nSO: Shit. That‚Äôs on my email signature. I‚Äôm fucked.\n\nJune: Ha.\n\nSO: Okay I have to ask real questions now!\n\nJune: Sorry!\n\nYes.\n\nLet‚Äôs do this.\n\nSO: So after high school, you went to Tisch. What were your hopes/aspirations at that point?\n\nJune: When I went to Tisch I just knew I wanted to act.\n\nAt that point I really couldn‚Äôt imagine anything other than acting in theatre because that was all I had done. I had big dreams of being on Broadway in wonderful plays. It‚Äôs weird to think about it, but at that point I never really thought about film or television and certainly not about writing or even comedy. I thought I‚Äôd be playing Olga in 3 Sisters.\n\nThat to me (being any of the three sisters in a Broadway production) was the furthest my mind could go.\n\nIt still sounds amazing, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I just didn‚Äôt really think about any other life than that.\n\nSO: At what point did that change? How did writing and comedy come into place for you?\n\nJune: Well, I always loved doing comedy, but I just didn‚Äôt do as much of it at Tisch. It wasn‚Äôt until after that I started really getting into it. Casey Wilson and I met at Tisch and we became fast friends in a clown class at our acting studio Stella Adler. A friend of ours was hosting an open mike at Riffifi, and asked us if we wanted to put up a sketch.\n\nWe wrote one and put it up and it went over really well, so we started writing some more and then realized we could put a show together to compile them.\n\nBut even then the goal was never to write. (I read Casey‚Äôs interview with you and I can‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôm repeating a ton of stuff she already said about this.) We were out of school and wanted to showcase ourselves as actors so that‚Äôs really why we started writing material for ourselves. No one was going to hire these mugs on their own!\n\nBut yeah, from there we put up the show Rode Hard and Put Away Wet at our acting studio and Owen Burke (who at the time was Artistic Director of UCB NY) saw it and brought us over there.\n\nAnd from there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶FAME AND FORTUNE!\n\nTruly UCB was the big turning point and I thank God for them and Owen. We were able to run the show and develop it, and then take it to Aspen, etc‚Ä¶\n\nSO: SUCCESS! I‚Äôm glad you read that interview with Casey, I love her, as well. She was so sweet and funny. And I‚Äôm actually in the middle of an interview with Paul Rust! You are surrounded my great people!\n\nOne of the things I really love about you and Casey, is that you really have written yourselves into Hollywood, so to speak. Was that an actual plan you both had or did it just kind of happen?\n\nI didn‚Äôt get that question out right. I fucked it up. But do you know what I mean?\n\nI‚Äôm typing horrible. Geez.\n\nWe should have done this with emoticons only, you can‚Äôt misspell a smile.\n\nJune: Casey is the bestest. Yes I know what you mean! I wish that were the plan, it would have been a good plan. But alas, no, I remember when our lit agent at UTA came up to us after our show in Aspen and asked if we had literary representation and I couldn‚Äôt understand why.\n\nHe had to literally explain as though we were retarded that we had written the show and that we were writers. I think we fought him on that point. Mainly because we improvised so much of the show and the script was pretty much on napkins. So we didn‚Äôt think we were writers.\n\nNot only that but I remember telling Casey it was really bad news that he thought of us as writers, because it meant we weren‚Äôt attractive enough to be actresses.\n\nIt was a real blow.\n\nSo long story short, NO, there was no plan!\n\nNext interview is definitely all emoticons.\n\nI‚Äôm praying you‚Äôll do a spell check before posting. I fear you won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm gonna slow down the writing a bit.\n\nSO: I will def spell check. So was Bride Wars your first real big intro into Hollywood, like full on in the industry?\n\nAs in, having representation, dealing with industry people, all that stuff. I live Dallas, not Hollywood, but you know, like that Hollywood STUFF.\n\nJune: Yes, absolutely. Bride Wars was definitely the big intro‚Ä¶.The executive on that movie Heidi Sherman Grey, who has become a close friend, actually saw our show in Aspen and asked us if we had ever thought about screenwriting. She told us about the idea for it and within months we were flying out to LA to pitch the movie to producers. It was pretty awesome, actually. I mean we didn‚Äôt know anything about screenwriting and we were googling what a ‚Äúset piece‚Äù was‚Ä¶.we thought it meant describing the furniture in the scenes‚Ä¶..so it was a crash course for sure.\n\nSO: What I was asking is you became a coke addict? Correct?\n\nJune: Haha!!!!!\n\nYes! That was when I became a huge douchebag.\n\nSO: When I saw I typed Hollywood STUFF I was like, what does that even mean? Like it kind of did read as if I was asking you if you became a douchebag. But I wasn‚Äôt!\n\nOkay lets skip ahead and talk about the present. First, the hilarious podcast you do with Paul Scheer and Jason Mantzoukas: How Did This Get Made? I‚Äôve listened to both. Really enjoyed them. Are you having a fun time doing those? Love the concept. Who came up with that?\n\nJune: So glad you like them! Definitely Paul‚Äôs brainchild, but yes we are having a really good time‚Ä¶.started after a viewing of Old Dogs. Which we saw in the theatre.\n\nSO: YOU DID NOT SEE OLD DOGS IN THEATRE!\n\nJune: Sure did.\n\nWith five other people.\n\nAnd then we had about a two-hour talkback session of sorts, trying to wrap our minds around the movie.\n\nSO: I‚Äôve never actually seen the movie Old Dogs, but I love that you and a group of friends went to see it.\n\nWhat I really like is that you love bad movies, but KNOW they are bad. I can‚Äôt stand movie snobs, like people who ONLY watch foreign shit or Oscar contenders, etc. Movies are supposed to be fun! But I have asked numerous times after watching something, literally, how did this get made? What‚Äôs the next movie you have lined up? Is there an episode schedule?\n\nJune: We don‚Äôt have a movie lined up yet‚Ä¶there are a few contenders but haven‚Äôt locked it down yet.\n\nThe Wicker Man seems like a classic.\n\nSO: Is that your favorite bad movie?\n\nJune: I actually haven‚Äôt seen it‚Ä¶I look forward to it. Old Dogs is really something. Really something special.\n\nI think Old Dogs takes it.\n\nBut you are talking to someone who has soooooo much sympathy for how hard it is to write a movie and how many people get involved and what a crazy shit show it can be, so I‚Äôm not coming at it as a hater. AT ALL. And I know how hurtful nasty comments can be so I really don‚Äôt want to put that energy out there. I feel like the podcast is more of an honest dissection in a spirit of positive inquiry. Trying to understand.\n\nSO: Exactly. Totally agree. Like there is a difference between asking how this movie got made, but more asking how it got to the point of being able to be made. Like you all were saying on the last episode, something like the pitch was: ‚ÄúIf you take this pill, you will be the smartest person in the world.‚Äù\n\nI think that is what is funnier to talk about.\n\nJune: Agreed.\n\nI‚Äôm leaving Paul and coming to Dallas to live with you.\n\nSO: Do it. We will both not use LOL at people together.\n\nWhat is your most favorite character you‚Äôve played on screen?\n\nJune: I‚Äôd have to say my character in our new movie, not out yet, ASS BACKWARDS.\n\nShe‚Äôs based on a version of myself and I love her dearly. So I guess I love myself‚Ä¶. breakthrough!!!!!\n\nShe‚Äôs just completely delusional. She sells her eggs for a living and considers herself a businesswoman. I just love someone who thinks they are super smart when they aren‚Äôt.\n\nRefers to her eggs as her ‚Äúproduct‚Äù. Just stupid!\n\nSO: I‚Äôve been really excited about ASS BACKWARDS. Tell me all about it.\n\nOh and eggs as her ‚Äúproduct‚Äù. LOVE.\n\nJune: It‚Äôs the movie that Casey and I wrote and starred in. Indie. Hopefully it will be out sometime in the near future! It‚Äôs a road trip comedy about two best friends who are a little too close‚Ä¶.they have been living in their own delusional bubble for years and are super co-dependent (share a waterbed together in a dump in the east village) and then are forced to really grow up.\n\nThey are living off their dad and my egg sales. And they realize they never got over a childhood trauma and go back to try to fix it.\n\nThat was an awful description!\n\nIt‚Äôs funny. End of story!\n\n(I just shot myself in the head)\n\nSO: Did you approach some of the more serious elements on a personal level? I mean I know all writing is personal on some level, but some of those elements seem like they could loosely be based from your reality, like your friendship with Casey.\n\nI mean with you all being super close and best friends in real life, with you probably having thought how if things didn‚Äôt turn out the way they did, maybe you could be living in a different form of a delusional bubble.\n\nThat was dark. Sorry!\n\nJune: Ha. Well their weirdo friendship is definitely based on ours. Although I never sold my eggs. (I was always just obsessed with the ads in the village voice for egg donors.) I was always running strange business schemes in NY. Renting out rooms and space in my apt and stuff like that to make money.\n\nNot dark at all‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶I mean I think we‚Äôve definitely gotten a lot closer as our careers have grown, which is probably the opposite for a lot collaborations‚Ä¶but I think too much life has happened at this point to be as delusional as the characters are in this movie.\n\nDoes that make any sort of sense?\n\nSO: It totally does, yes.\n\nWhere are you at in the process for the much buzzed about movie The Bachelorette Party?\n\nJune: Right now we are turning in our first draft to Universal. But we love it. Very excited for it, and despite the fact that it‚Äôs titled Bachelorette it doesn‚Äôt have much to do with a wedding. Just an awesome ensemble comedy for some funny ladies.\n\nSO: I have a phone interview with Ruben Fleischer coming up that I‚Äôm excited about. Is he still attached to direct?\n\nJune: Yes! He has the script right now!\n\nSO: That‚Äôs awesome. With him directing, and it being written by you and Casey, that will be great. That will big. Huge, even.\n\nJune: Me hopes.\n\nSO: So this year you are ‚Äútaking it up a notch‚Äù on all levels. How so? In what ways?\n\nShit just got real.\n\nJune: Well mainly in my cup size.\n\nSO: Obviously.\n\nJune: No, ha. Just want to work harder at everything this year and do even better stuff than last year! Writing a pilot for myself to star in, working on more feature ideas, movies, plastic surgery, all of it! ‚ÄúTaking it up a notch!‚Äù\n\nBasically it just means working harder!\n\nSO: I will do that with you, in fact, it‚Äôs done. I‚Äôm gonna ‚Äútake it up a notch‚Äù as well. You‚Äôve inspired me!\n\nJune: People say I‚Äôm inspiring.\n\nIt‚Äôs the main thing people say about me.\n\nAlso, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAre you Sarah Chalke?‚Äù\n\nSO: I think Sarah Chalke is super pretty. Really. That is a compliment! Do you have anything coming up we should know about in the near future?\n\nJune: Definitely check out United States Police Department on HBO‚Äôs Funny or Die presents show.\n\nAlso NTSF on Adult Swim I‚Äôll be in, with Paul, Brandon Johnson, and Rob Riggle, which should be amazing! That will come out with Children‚Äôs Hospital over the summer.\n\nSO: Okay last few quick questions: Do you and Paul have any pets? What blogs/websites do you check daily, if any?\n\nJune: No pets. Desperately want a dog, but Paul says no and as he always says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the man of the house and I make the decisions.‚Äù\n\nSo that‚Äôs a no.\n\nUnforch.\n\nBut blogs and websites‚Ä¶.hmph..Whitney Cummings has a hilarious blog that I follow and her tweets are of course, priceless. I‚Äôm also a bit of a news junkie so you‚Äôll find me on HuffPo and all those usual suspects‚Ä¶oh, and Friendster.\n\nSO: I‚Äôll totally hit you up on Friendster. THANK YOU JUNE!! I really appreciate it, thank you so much for taking the time to do this!\n\nJune: You are awesome and thanks so much!\n\n____"
