        "text": "This week we have a treat for our Deep Divers and giving you all a first listen of the crossover podcast of the century. June, Jessica, Paul Scheer and Jason Mantzoukas cover the 2011 film, Love On A Leash. June and Jessica ask the same questions you expect, “do you find your dog attractive” and “what are the proper packing cubes to use”? June questions the details of using a ‘hot spot’ and her Jessica and Jason break down what we can only call “dog boudoir” photos. Remember Deep Divers do NOT sleep on Kyle.\n\nMore info for Plan C pills https://www.plancpills.org/\n\nVisit the Pinterest Board pinterest.com/thedeepdive\n\nYou can follow The Deep Dive on Twitter @thedeepdivepod\n\nJune Diane Raphael @MsJuneDiane on Twitter @junediane on Instagram\n\nJessica St. Clair @Jessica_StClair on Twitter @stclairjessica on Instagram\n\nCheck out the Jane Club at www.janeclub.com\n\nSend us your The Deep Dive theme or any questions you might have to thedeepdive@earwolf.com\n\nAs a child, Paul Scheer developed a taste for cola mixed with milk from his favorite television show. Sounds like a habit one would eventually grow out of, but as Walt Disney once said, “that’s the real trouble with the world: too many people grow up.” Featuring Paul’s dad Bill, and Seth’s parents too.\n\nListen to Paul Scheer’s podcast “Unspooled” wherever podcasts are found. And check out Paul’s Twitch channel at twitch.tv/friendzone. Paul has a weekly Thursday show with Rob Huebel and curates an awesome lineup of other programming throughout the month.\n\nMichelle and Dan discuss the highs and lows of the Tony Awards, PVSD (post-vacation stress disorder), and Netflix’s SQUID GAME. Then, the always charming Paul Scheer joins Michelle to discuss the secret to aging well (always looking old?), the magic of love languages, and the one place Michelle would like to have her ashes scattered: Target."
