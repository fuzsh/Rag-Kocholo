        "text": "Welcome to 3 Things.\n\nI’ll get into what this is in just a moment, but first, let me do the awkward introduction that everyone seems to do so you know exactly who I am. I’d hate for you to be reading this substack for a year and only then realizing, “Wait, he’s not David Cross?”\n\nI’m Paul Scheer. You might know me from TV shows like Human Giant, The League, Fresh off the Boat, NTSF:SD:SUV:: and Black Monday. I also do a podcast with June Diane Raphael and Jason Mantzoukas on a show called How Did This Get Made? where we discuss the best bad movies ever made, and to balance that out, I also co-host Unspooled with NY Times Film Critic Amy Nicholson, where we talk about the best movies ever made. I also livestream with Rob Huebel every week on Twitch, IG Live, YouTube, and X. In addition, I have written comic books for Marvel and DC, and recently, I completed my 1st book, Joyful Recollections of Trauma, which you can pre-order now. (and keep your receipt if you do because, I’ve got some cool things coming up).\n\nPre Order Here\n\nIn the process of writing my book, I realized I’m tired of short burst social media. I miss writing and blogging. I recently looked back at my Tumblr, “The Secret Dreams and Private Recipes of Paul Scheer” and I used to post a lot. So I came to Substack because I’ve been looking for a place to do more of that. Plus, I also realized my book only scratched the surface of the stories that I have and that I want to tell. So, I figured this could be a great place to work out some more of those areas as well.\n\nWhich brings us to this…\n\nWhat’s “3 Things?”\n\n3 Things is a weekly newsletter that is guaranteed to include 3 things. Maybe it’s an anecdote, a link to something that made me laugh (or learn), a rant, a dumb bit, a recommendation, or maybe I’ll even include a recipe in one of these. The thing is, I’m not exactly sure what each week will bring. But I can guarantee that whatever it is will be the things currently on my mind. It’s going to be raw and a bit unpolished because I don’t want to make it “perfect” as much as I want it, just to be as fun to read as it is to write.\n\nThis is where you come in. Based on your feedback, I might lean more in one direction than another. I might even incorporate a letter to the editor section and make one of my things one of your questions. Basically, I want to hear from you. So leave comments, ask questions, and let’s chat. What’s something you want me to write about?\n\nLeave a comment\n\nHow Much?\n\nRight now it’s free. But if you are so inclined and want to support me. I’ll never say no to money; that’s a hard and fast rule of mine. So if you decide to throw me some $, I’ll give you one extra thing a month!\n\nAnything Else?\n\nWe are creating whatever this becomes together. So interact and feel free to share with your friends if you like what you are getting.\n\nOh and here’s your 1st THING…ICYMI\n\nCheck out They Cloned Tyrone (Netflix); I can’t believe more people aren’t talking about this movie. Unfortunately, I feel like this film was a victim of the no-press rule during the actor strikes. I don’t want to tell you anything about it because the less you know, the better it will be, but let me do that thing where I compare it to a lot of different movies. They Cloned Tyrone is like The Truman Show meets Us in a world of the Rowdy Roddy Piper film They Live."
