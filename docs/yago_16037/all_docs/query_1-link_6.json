        "text": "The jokes didn't stop at comedian Paul Scheer's wedding.\n\nAppearing on a recent episode of the Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast, the Veep star, 48, revealed that he chose an unlikely person to serve as best man at his 2009 wedding to wife June Diane Raphael.\n\n\"The thing that was the best about our wedding was that [Raphael] let me hire a Jack Nicholson impersonator to be my best man,\" he told hosts O'Brien, Sona Movsesian and Matt Gourley.\n\nHowever, his carefully laid plans to surprise and entertain his guests with the impersonator immediately went awry.\n\n\"This Jack Nicholson impersonator arrived to the wedding late and goes, 'Hey, sorry I'm late. I was at a party at Roman Polanski's house,' \" he jokingly recalled, imitating the real Nicholson's deep, throaty voice. \"That was his opening line.\"\n\nScheer then explained how the wedding venue was split with their parents and older adults on one side and all of the couple's friends on the other. \"Now, our friends on the other side are having the best time, going, 'Oh this is insane' [in response to the impersonator],\" he said. \"And the people on the other side started going, 'I think he might know Jack Nicholson.' \"\n\nTo make sure his \"best man\" was prepared, Scheer wrote him a script, awkwardly — but hilariously — working in the titles of Nicholson's most famous films.\n\n\"It's like, 'Paul and June are as good as it gets.' And, 'He was just a wolf, but he was going to give her some terms of endearment,' \" the League star recounted, earning loud groans from the podcast hosts.\n\nGourley interjected, \"What?! Did you get to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?\" prompting Scheer to laugh and reply, \"Oh, I did everything.\"\n\nAs it turned out, however, the Jack Nicholson impersonator wasn't quite up to the task at the moment.\n\n\"The day of the wedding, he pulls me aside and goes, 'You have a teleprompter?' I say, 'A teleprompter? No, it's a wedding, there's no teleprompter!' He goes, 'I'm not really going to remember too much of the speech.' \"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nWhen Scheer suggested that the impersonator could read out the speech, he said he wouldn't be able to see the paper because of the Nicholson-inspired sunglasses he was wearing for the occasion.\n\nInstead, the man decided to go rogue and improvise. \"So he starts devolving into things that are not even Jack Nicholson. He goes, 'June and Paul, yummy yummy,' \" Scheer recalled, earning big laughs from O'Brien, Movsesian and Gourley.\n\nWhile Scheer's best man stunt was a flop, the actor said it made him realize that Raphael — an actress best known for starring in Grace and Frankie — is the one for him.\n\n\"I did know that I married the right person that when I brought that up to June, she was like, 'You can have him.' And that was a nice moment,\" he said.\n\nScheer recently opened up to PEOPLE about his newest project, Joyful Recollections of Trauma, a collection of personal essays set to be released on Tuesday, May 21. He revealed that his wife, 44, encouraged him to share a particularly vulnerable chapter about being diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and how the disorder impacted his childhood.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\n“The one chapter I struggled with the most was the ADHD chapter that's at the end because it was something that I got diagnosed with as an older person, as a person with a child,” he said. (He and Raphael share two sons, Gus and Sam.)\n\n“She's like, ‘It's the first time I feel like I understood you, like I understood what having your issue is like,' \" Scheer said of Raphael reading the chapter. \"And it's been odd because it's the one thing that I've told really no one.\"\n\nHe told PEOPLE he's now glad he included the section in the book, as he knows readers facing similar challenges will connect to his candid personal experience.\n\n“I felt like I realize now I like that chapter being in it because I'm like, ‘Oh, if I would've read that chapter, I might have checked myself out if someone else wrote it,’ ” he explained. “And really, that's how I found out that I had ADHD, was [by] reading other people's dealing with it. So that was something that was really hard for me to be out there with, but also I'm now proud that it's there.”"
