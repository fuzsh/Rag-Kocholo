        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Jon Gabrus is set as a series regular opposite June Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer in DINKS, an improvisational style multi-cam comedy pilot, from Grace & Frankie creator Marta Kauffman and her Okay Goodnight banner, Amazon MGM Studios and Lionsgate Television. Additionally, Nicole Byer, Carl Tart, and Lennon Parham join as guest stars in the project.\n\nCreated, written and executive produced by Kauffman, DINKS (Dual Income No Kids) is about Josh (Scheer) and Charlie (Raphael), a couple who, in absence of a marriage or kids, decide to literally build a life together by renovating their nightmare of a dream house.\n\nGabrus will play Ronan, Josh’s adult nephew renting Josh and Charlie’s backhouse. He’s 35 years old, going on 16, misguided yet street-smart, hopeful, and too lazy to be ambitious.\n\nAlex Fernie is directing the pilot, which Kauffman co-wrote with Hannah K.S. Canter. Kauffman, Canter, Raphael and Scheer executive produce with Okay Goodnight’s Robbie Rowe Tollin. Jesse Schiller serves as a producer and Molly Arkin as a co-producer.\n\nGabrus can most recently be seen starring in Max comedic travelogue series 101 Places To Party Before You Die, alongside Adam Pally. His other television credits include FX’s What We Do In The Shadows, NBC’s Brooklyn Nine-Nine, ABC’s Happy Endings, Comedy Central’s Workaholics, IFC’s Comedy Bang Bang and TVLand’s Younger. On the feature side, Gabrus appeared in Jay Roach’s Bombshell with Charlize Theron and Justin Simien’s Bad Hair, among others. He’s repped by Buchwald, Artists First and attorney Lev Ginsburg."
