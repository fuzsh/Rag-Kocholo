She also shared details on writing a spinoff for her character with one of the showrunners from the series in the hopes Brianna’s journey gets to continue on for audiences.\n\nWatch the full conversation below.\n\nQ&A on the Netflix series Grance and Frankie with actor June Diane Raphael. Moderated by Mara Webster, In Creative Company.\n\nFor as long as they can recall, Grace and Frankie have been rivals. Their one-upmanship comes crashing to a halt, however, when they learn that their husbands have fallen in love with each other and want to get married. As everything around the ladies is coming apart, the only thing they can really rely on is each other. This Netflix original re-teams Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin (\"9 to 5\") as Grace and Frankie, respectively, bringing their chemistry to the small screen. It's a casting reunion on a grand scale, as Tomlin is reunited with her co-star from \"The West Wing,\" Martin Sheen, who plays Grace's husband, Robert. And Fonda is back with Sam Waterston, her co-star from \"The Newsroom,\" who plays Frankie's husband, Sol."
