        "text": "June Diane Raphael is an actress, comedian, screenwriter, and producer whose resume includes “Grace and Frankie,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” and “New Girl.” June and Tig talk about everything from pickleball to politics to a wild Vegas weekend and why they should never be closer friends. They also advise a woman deciding if she should pursue a career, a young mother who feels out of touch with the adult world, and a nurse whose husband has lots of great entrepreneurial ideas but can’t seem to make one work.\n\nOUR SPONSORS:\n\nBetterHelp - betterhelp.com/tig\n\nIndeed - indeed.com/tig\n\nZocdoc - Zocdoc.com/TIG\n\nRakuten - rakuten.com\n\nSimple Green - simplegreen.com\n\nDon't Ask Tig is supported by listeners like you.
