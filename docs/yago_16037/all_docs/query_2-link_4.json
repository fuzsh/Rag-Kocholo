        "text": "June Diane Raphael was born on Jan 4. 1980, in Rockville Centre, NY. In 1998, she enrolled in New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she met fellow aspiring actor and comedian Casey Wilson, with whom she would go on to join the Upright Citizens Brigade following graduation from college in 2002. After accruing experience touring with the improv troupe for a number of years, Raphael began landing screen roles, with early notable film credits including \"Zodiac\" (2007) and \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" (2008), as well as the short-lived but popular series \"Human Giant\" (MTV 2007-08). Raphael and Wilson made their feature screenwriting debut with the comedy \"Bride Wars\" (2009), in which they also appeared in supporting roles opposite stars Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson. Around the same time, Raphael married comedian and actor Paul Scheer, whom she'd go on to collaborate with on projects including the comedy series \"NTSF:SD:SUV::\" (Adult Swim 2011-13). Shortly afterward, Raphael co-wrote and costarred with Wilson in the road comedy film \"Ass Backwards\" (2013). Meanwhile, Raphael began collecting recurring roles on series like \"New Girl\" (Fox 2011-18), \"American Dad\" (Fox/TBS 2011-), \"Gracie and Frankie\" (Netflix 2015-), and \"Big Mouth\" (Netflix 2017-). Additionally, Raphael appeared in the dramedy films \"Girlfriend's Day\" (2017) and the Oscar-nominated \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017). The latter film, based on the cult classic \"The Room\" (2003), was partially inspired by a popular episode of the podcast \"How Did This Get Made,\" created and co-hosted by Raphael and Scheer with their friend Jason Mantzoukas; the podcast, which discussed bad films in comic detail, had covered \"The Room,\" and Raphael, Scheer and Mantzoukas all appeared in \"The Disaster Artist\" in small parts."
