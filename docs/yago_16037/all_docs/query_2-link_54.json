        "text": "Each year for the past 16 years, Miami Beach Pride has identified a variety of voices that have been advocates and allies for the LGBT+ community and 2024 is bringing exceptional star power with Lisa Rinna and June Diane Raphael. Both accomplished actresses, strong business women and staunch supporters of the LGBT+ community, they join Miami Beach Pride in celebration and support! Allyship is an important component in affecting change and Miami Beach Pride could not be more thrilled to welcome two outspoken voices from some of your favorite hit shows!\n\nLisa Rinna is a timeless actress, entrepreneur, host, public figure and fashion icon who continues to push the boundaries of expectations in all assets of her career and life.\n\nRinna is best-known for starring as \"Billie Reed\" on DAYS OF OUR LIVES and \"Taylor McBride\" on MELROSE PLACE. After 8 seasons on THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS, Rinna recently made a flashy return to acting on Ryan Murphy's anthology series, AMERICAN HORROR STORIES. She also just appeared on CBS' SO HELP ME TODD and stars and executive produced an upcoming Lifetime film, MOMMY MEANEST, premiering on May 11th. Other acting roles have included ENTOURAGE, VERONICA MARS, COMMUNITY and THE MIDDLE.\n\nRinna hosted Soapnet's SOAP TALK for 4 seasons, for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy each season for \"Outstanding Talk Show Host.\" She also competed in the second season of DANCING WITH THE STARS and the 4th season of THE CELEBRITY APPRENTICE. She also made her Broadway debut starring as \"Roxie Hart\" in CHICAGO in 2007. Rinna has also written three books: Starlit; The Big, Fun, Sexy Sex Book; and the New York Times bestseller Rinnavation.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, Rinna has launched highly-successful ventures that include a fashion line for QVC named The Lisa Rinna Collection and the cosmetics collection Rinna Beauty.\n\nRinna currently resides in Beverly Hills with her equally-iconic husband, actor Harry Hamlin and two incredible daughters Amelia and Delilah.\n\nJune Diane Raphael is an actress, comedian, screenwriter, and producer. June co-starred in the hit Netflix series Grace and Frankie as Brianna, Jane Fonda’s bold entrepreneurial daughter, which finished its seventh and final season. She was recently seen in the feel-good holiday film on HBO Max 8-Bit and is known for her role opposite Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen in Lionsgate’s comedy, Long Shot. In addition, June co-hosts the Deep Dive podcast with her best friend Jessica St. Clair where the ladies ‘deep dive’ into a wide range of topics, from motherhood and family to feminism. The Deep Dive captures the friendship of two women trying to survive adult womanhood.\n\nShe also is the co-author of Represent: The Woman’s Guide to Running for Office and Changing the World, which was released in September 2019.\n\nOther notable achievements include the 2013 Sundance Film, Ass Backwards, which she co-wrote and starred in with her creative partner, Casey Wilson. Her guest star appearances bring in some of the seasons’ highest ratings thanks to her perfect comedic timing. Her extensive television credits include Black Monday, I’m Sorry, Fresh Off the Boat, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Lady Dynamite, New Girl as Dr. Sadie (the lesbian gynecologist and friend of Jess and CeCe), The League as Pam, Flight of the Conchords, American Dad! and The Muppets as Lucy Royce, Head of ABC.\n\nShe has also appeared in films including The Disaster Artist, Blockers, Zodiac, Bachelorette, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. June found her niche and love of comedy after college when she went to work for UCB, first in New York and later in Los Angeles. It was in New York where Raphael and Wilson wrote their two-woman sketch show, Rode Hard and Put Away Wet, which went on to run for 3 years at UCB.\n\nShe reprises her role on the Netflix hit series Big Mouth. Additionally, she co-stars opposite Tracee Ellis Ross and Dakota Johnson in the Focus Features/Working Title film, The High Note directed by Nisha Ganatra.\n\nJune founded The Jane Club, a community for women and caretakers, which recently pivoted into a digital space offering an entire village of support to Janes who reside across the United States and around the world. June resides in Los Angeles along with her husband Paul Scheer and their two children.\n\n“We are so fortunate to have both Lisa and June Diane join us in Miami at a time when their voices of allyship are needed most,”said Bruce Horwich, Miami Beach Pride Chairman. “We also wanted to honor women at a time when they’re under similar duress as the LGBT+ community in the spirit of togetherness and solidarity.”\n\nThe Miami Beach Pride Parade is scheduled for Sunday, April 14 at Noon. Free to the public and always a spectacle, come watch as local and national organizations, charities and brands from all over the country assemble to be a part of the Parade as thousands march in solidarity along Ocean Drive to celebrate their Pride. Floats, cheerleaders, drag queen performers and more can be seen marching together, a showcase of how Miami Beach uniquely stands for Pride."
