        "text": "Actress, writer, and comedian June Diane Raphael is most recognizable either as Jane Fonda’s bold entrepreneurial daughter on Netflix’s Grace and Frankie or as the co-host of the wildly popular podcast How Did This Get Made? A decade into her Hollywood career, June has already carved out a pioneering path in an industry that often makes thinking outside the box a challenging prospect. In 2011—two years before Veronica Mars did it—June and writing partner Casey Wilson funded their film Ass Backwards via Kickstarter after investors dropped out. She also got in on the ground floor of online content with the web series, Burning Love, and remains one of the rare truly prominent female voices in the crowded field of podcasting. And as new media opportunities arrive, June seems ever eager to be a part of them, using her dry wit to blaze a path for other women to follow.\n\nLast weekend Netflix kicked off a second season of Grace and Frankie featuring June Diane Raphael’s Brianna in an expanded role as not only Jane Fonda’s daughter, but also the CEO behind Lily Tomlin’s organic lube enterprise. (Yeah, you read that correctly.) June’s sexy, confident Brianna clashes with Tomlin’s unpragmatic approach to business. And when the Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen’s lawyer characters get involved in the dispute, Brianna is the smirking eye of the show’s comedy hurricane. June Diane Raphael spoke with V.F. Hollywood over the phone about her career, being a working mom, and the legion of podcast fans who crave her comedic insight.\n\nVF.com: You’re very committed to writing scripts for yourself. What do you see in your own work that you don’t find elsewhere in Hollywood?\n\nJune Diane Raphael: The women that I find most interesting are flawed, and not necessarily likable in the big studio definition of that word. I grew up in a family of sisters and just such a huge female energy surrounding me that it was just so natural for me to want to write about women and especially female friendships that I find so rich and complicated in a way that I don’t know men really experience. Some of my friendships with women are more complicated than my marriage to a man. That’s what I've always been drawn to, in some ways, I have trouble writing male characters.\n\nI have read certain scripts where I’m like, “Ugh, women don’t talk this way. Women would never say that. Why don’t I get any funny lines? Why do I always have to be the long-suffering girlfriend who’s supporting the comedy of these crazy guys?” I want to have the jokes. I want to be funny and weird and distasteful. Now I have a deeper understanding of it after having written for so long and feeling like, “When I write male characters I have to dig deep and really force myself to not have them playing basketball or video games.”\n\nBrianna, your character on Grace and Frankie, is obviously an extreme example but what elements of her character do you most identify with in terms of being the kind of women that you like to play?\n\nWhat I love about her is she is so unfiltered and she’s not worried about being seen as nice or good, which I think can be a real trap for—I include myself in this group—a lot of women of feeling like we need to be nice and to be liked. She’s so comfortable not being liked and saying whatever she wants to say. That’s really fun to play because there’s just so much freedom in that. I actually think since becoming a mother I have more of that to offer the character. When you have a child it’s kind of like that mama bear intensity comes out. That’s something I’ve definitely been able to channel to a character who has no desire to have children.\n\nI did just want to ask you about that because I know you had just had your first kid when you shot Season 1 of Grace and Frankie and Season 2 was written around your co-star Brooklyn Decker’s pregnancy and now you’re pregnant again. I’ve been hearing stories from actresses from Olivia Coleman in The Night Manager to Ellie Kemper in The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt that it’s easier to be a pregnant woman in the industry now. Do you feel like TV in general is more flexible when it comes to actresses and pregnancy? That it feels like less of an either/or choice?\n\nI do think it’s better also that with the dawn of CGI a lot can be done. I shot a pilot for NBC when I was eight months pregnant and they just removed the belly—I was the lead of the pilot—from every single shot. Which they can do. It costs money but they can do it. There’s a ways to go, too. I think in general it brings up the question, is our society made for women? That extends to daycare and breast-feeding, and creating time during a workday for women to pump, which is a real issue for women in the workforce.\n\nWe have a lot of luxuries in TV that most women don’t have but especially the working moms. I think overall the workforce, not just in films and TV, we could be much kinder to mothers or caregivers in general. I think a lot of work, unfortunately, needs to be done so we’re not pumping breast milk in bathrooms.\n\nYou also have a small role in Maria Bamford’s upcoming Netflix series Lady Dynamite, which is some seriously off-the-wall comedy. Between that and Grace and Frankie, do you feel like Netflix is a particularly welcoming environment for atypical female comedies?\n\nI feel like the world needs Maria Bamford in such a real way. She’s such a demented animal and it just couldn’t be more exciting to me. I hadn’t thought about it but Lady Dynamite probably would have been a show that was on Adult Swim like three years ago. Everything is changing so quickly. It’s pretty wild. I think that Netflix has done such a great job of reaching different demographics and not just relying on one. I think Grace and Frankie has definitely introduced an older audience to Netflix. I know that my dad got Netflix to watch the show. I imagine a lot of people did because there’s not a lot of shows that are dealing with the issues that Grace and Frankie is dealing with. They’re kind of a group that advertisers are not as interested in in terms of what they’re consuming."
