        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from Don't Ask Tig on Spotify. June Diane Raphael is an actress, comedian, screenwriter, and producer whose resume includes “Grace and Frankie,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” and “New Girl.” June and Tig talk about everything from pickleball to politics to a wild Vegas weekend and why they should never be closer friends. They also advise a woman deciding if she should pursue a career, a young mother who feels out of touch with the adult world, and a nurse whose husband has lots of great entrepreneurial ideas but can’t seem to make one work.This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy), Indeed (visit indeed.com/TIG for a $75 sponsored job credit), Zocdoc (go to Zocdoc.com/TIG to download the app for free), Rakuten (go to rakuten.com to download the app for free), and Simple Green (visit simplegreen.com to view the complete product lineup).Don't Ask Tig is supported by listeners like you.
