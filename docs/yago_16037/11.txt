"Someone's always up, and someone's down. So someone's found out amazing news and got the job they wanted, and someone's devastated, so we're never quite on the same emotional wavelength in terms of our careers, but, in many ways, that's great because you have someone who's usually always happy in the house pulling someone up."

Scheer and Raphael's first child was born in 2014, and they named Gus. After the actress gave birth and following her mother's death, she began suffering from postpartum depression. In an essay on the topic, she wrote:

"One thing I know is my mother suffered from postpartum depression after she had me. She told me, so I know. I know this for sure. The way she described it, for three months she felt gray—and then one day, in our kitchen, she bent down to adjust her shoe, and when she got back up…the gray had lifted. Just like that. It was gone."

Gus was followed by the birth of their second child, Sam, in 2020, with the two joking: "We are so excited to welcome our new baby©. He's© available for all endorsements and sponsorships."
