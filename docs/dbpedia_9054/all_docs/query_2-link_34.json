        "text": "The BenYehuda family holds a fishing contest each summer during their annual Adirondack vacation. This year Karen BenYehuda, of Westvale, crushed the competition on Inlet’s Fourth Lake with a monster rock bass.\n\nBenYehuda’s rockie stretched the tape to 2 ½ inches, just half an inch shorter than the nightcrawler she used to catch it. Second place came in around the 1.5-inch mark.\n\nBarak BenYehuda, Karen BenYehuda’s son and family spokesman, described competition this year as “fierce.”\n\nYounger brother Bo “certainly put out the most lines with the least success,” observed Barak, while his younger sister, Elmore, was, he said, “more focused on tanning than fishing.” Barak also praised his older sister, Liat, for doing the most to “dress the part” despite being the least-skilled angler in the family.\n\nGrandmother Ann Clifford judged the contest.\n\nMeet 12-year-old Landon Mills, an avid angler from Liverpool who fishes every chance he can get. He was fishing the St. Lawrence River recently with his father and grandfather when he reeled in a super 4-lb smallmouth and a wonderful 5-lb walleye that both gobbled up a spinner/worm combo.\n\nBrian Davis, of Skaneateles, caught a couple of nice Skaneateles Lake walleyes one a recent summer morning while trolling Mepps spinners in 35 FOW on the east shore. One fish measured 19 inches; the other 23 inches.\n\nJack Rohlin, 13, of Marcellus, recently caught this burly bucket mouth on Big Moose Lake while casting from his grandparents’ dock in Boulder Bay. Rohlin was using his new baitcaster and a wacky-rigged worm for bait.\n\nSeth Shultis caught this 6-lb largemouth bass at a local pond in his hometown of Saugerties, using a five-inch watermelon senko. Nice fish, Seth, but your long-arm game is world class.\n\nJosh McKeown, of Baldwinsville, recently landed a whale of walleye in Alexandria Bay that weighed 7½-lbs and measured 27 ¾ inches.\n\n“It bent the rod and was so heavy the reel wouldn’t turn, but I cranked it enough to bring it in,” remarked McKeown. “Beautiful day on the river, always my happy place!”\n\nSend us your fish pics!\n\nWe want to see your catch: bass, walleye, two-headed gobies, whatever. Just make sure to provide (1) names of anyone in photo (2) their hometowns (3) fish type (4) where caught (5) length and weight if possible (6) bait used. Throw in some colorful details; we all like a good fish story. Tight lines, ya’ll.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMonster Cayuga Lake largemouth bass officially sets a NY state record: ‘We were freaking out’ - newyorkupstate.com\n\nGoodness garacious: upstate NY angler breaks state record for longnose gar - newyorkupstate.com\n\nManlius brothers land Adirondack lake lunkers using pork chop, bluegill for bait - newyorkupstate.com\n\nSuper Cayuga Lake smallmouth gives Upstate NY angler a pre-season thrill - newyorkupstate.com"
