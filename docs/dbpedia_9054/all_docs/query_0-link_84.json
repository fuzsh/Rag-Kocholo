        "text": "What is Robert Bass' Net Worth?\n\nRobert Bass is an American businessman and philanthropist who has a net worth of $5 billion. Apart from chairing Aerion Corporation, an American aerospace firm in Reno, Nevada, Robert Bass is actively involved in numerous philanthropic activities. Born Robert Muse Bass in 1947 to a wealthy family, he earned his Bachelor's degree from Yale University and Master of Business Administration from Stanford University. Bass began his career at Bass Brothers Enterprises and shortly after he continued to work independently making manifold lucrative investments through his own company, the Robert M. Bass Group, later Keystone Inc. The investment strategy (losing money in order to make money) that's been employed both by him and his family turned out to be successful and they ended up making lots of money. It was under his initiative that Aerion Corporation started developing supersonic corporate jets in 1994. Also, in the early 1990s, he set up investment company Oak Hill, which has since evolved into four separate operations with total assets under management more than $35 billion. Most recently, in 2012, he annexed a massive pad in Manhattan's 834 Fifth Avenue for a reported $42 million. As for his philanthropic work, Bass and his wife has made numerous contributions, the latest being a $50 million donation to Duke University to support Bass Connections, an initiative to incite cross disciplinary collaboration and studies."
