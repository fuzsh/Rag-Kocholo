        "text": "Meet the Bass family! I got to spend a sun-filled, winter afternoon with this beautiful family, exploring around the fields behind the North Carolina Museum of Art. There is something so lovely about winter sun. There is a slight haze and softness that gives summer sunlight a run for its money. Iâ€™m so thankful that the Bass family toughed out the cold winter winds for this session because it turned out so beautiful!\n\nYou wouldnâ€™t know it from the pictures, but the greenway was abuzz with SO MANY people â€“ maybe the busiest Iâ€™ve ever seen it! On top of that, it was freezing and the wind was really showing off. I think these 2 little ones really handled it way better than expected! Haley is a talented portrait photographer herself, so I was so honored when she reached out about doing this session! Then they showed up looking so amazing â€“ what a dream! ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m so grateful to this beautiful family for trusting me with their memories!"
