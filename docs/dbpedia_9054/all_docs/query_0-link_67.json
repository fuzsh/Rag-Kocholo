        "text": "BRUNSWICK, ME — George Henry Bass II, 87, of Thornton Oaks in Brunswick, died Sunday, February 24, 2002 in Naples, Florida.He was born in Wilton on August 30, 1914 and was the son of John Russell Bass and Mary Alice Ness Bass. George graduated from Wilton Academy in 1932, Deerfield Academy in 1933, and Bowdoin College in 1937. At Bowdoin he belonged to the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and played on the football and hockey teams. After graduation, he was a member of the Alumni Council and served as Class Agent to the Alumni Fund.On November 26, 1938, he married Catherine Forbush and together they enjoyed 63 wonderful years. They met at Kineowatha Camps in Wilton where George worked maintaining the facilities and transporting campers while Catherine served as a camp counselor.After graduating from Bowdoin, George entered the family firm of G. H. Bass & Company, shoe manufacturers. Bass shoes began as a small shoe shop in Wilton in 1876; George’s grandfather, George Henry Bass, founded the company. During the company’s early years, it was most famous for the Bass Aviation Boots worn by Charles Lindbergh during his historic transatlantic flight. Admiral Richard Byrd also went in search of the South Pole wearing Bass boots.In 1956, George became the company president following the death of his uncle, Willard S. Bass. He was named Chairman of the Bass Board of Directors in 1968 and Chairman of the Bass Executive Committee in 1972. George served in all three positions until his retirement in 1978. Under his leadership, the Bass Weejun achieved record sales when it became the footwear of choice for students in the 1960s.Hollywood legend James Dean also made the footwear famous with his rolled up jeans and white t-shirt. George remained with Bass throughout his professional career except for a two-year departure during World War II to serve with the U.S. Navy at a supply depot in Oran, Algeria.Upon George’s retirement, the family shoe business was sold to Chesebrough-Ponds, which later sold the company to Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation. George was deeply saddened by Van Heusen’s decision to close the Wilton factory and move production overseas in 1998.During his many years in business, George was a director of the Associated Industries of Maine, and a chairman and honorary lifetime trustee of the National Footwear Manufacturers Association. He also served on the board of the New England Footwear Association, and the National Association of Manufacturers. In addition, he served as a director of the Wilton Water Company and as a Wilton Selectman. George was a state chair for the Maine Division of the American Cancer Society. He also served on the boards of the American Cancer Society, Central Maine Power Company and Wilton Academy. When Governor James Longley was in office, George was appointed a member of the state’s commission for businesses.George also supported the Wilton Public Library and the Maine Maple Growers Association. He was a member of the Kents Hill School board of trustees for more than twenty years and was named an honorary lifetime trustee upon his retirement in 1985. His generous contributions to the school helped finance the construction of the George H. Bass II Art Center as well as the school’s new athletic center.In addition to his work in the shoe business, George enjoyed farming. For many years, he owned and managed Maplewood Farm, a dairy and woodland estate of more than three thousand acres in Strong. He also had a special love of workhorses. During his retirement, he continued to work with horses at Flying Changes Center for Therapeutic Riding in Topsham, a non-profit center dedicated to improving the lives of people of all ages who are physically, emotionally, or developmentally challenged. He helped instructors guide the therapy horses during lessons, assisted with the grooming and general care of the horses, and helped finance the construction of Flying Changes’ new indoor arena. George also volunteered his time at the Hilton Head Hospital in South Carolina, and delivered Meals on Wheels to residents of Kennebec and Sagadahoc Counties.George was an avid hockey and baseball fan throughout his life. He was especially fond of collegiate hockey, the Boston Red Sox and the Boston (now Atlanta) Braves. He was often the most enthusiastic fan at his family’s athletic events. George was a member of the First Congregational Church in Wilton and also attended the Wayne Community Church in Wayne and the Kellogg Congregational Church in Harpswell.He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Catherine Forbush Bass of Brunswick; two daughters, Nancy Bass Wolfram and her husband, Chuck, of Ithaca, New York, and Joanne Bass O’Connor and her husband, Richard, of Wayne; four grandchildren, Catherine Wolfram and her husband, Matt Barmack, of Berkeley, California, Peter Wolfram of Ithaca, New York, George O’Connor and his wife, Melissa, of Augusta, and Alane O’Connor and her husband, Kevin Wellenius, of Cambridge, Massachusetts; a brother, Robert “Bunny” Bass and his wife, Martha, of Cumberland Foreside; four great grandchildren, and many nieces, nephews, and cousins.George’s life will be celebrated during a memorial service on Sunday afternoon, March 17 at 1 P.M. from the First Congregational Church, Main St., Wilton, with Rev. Lynda Vackar, interim minister, and the Rev. Dr. Peter Misner co-officiating. A private family burial will be held in the spring at Lakeview Cemetery, Wilton.Donations in his memory may be made to the George H. Bass II Memorial Fund at FMH c/o Franklin Memorial Hospital, 111 Franklin Health Commons, Farmington, Me. 04938."
