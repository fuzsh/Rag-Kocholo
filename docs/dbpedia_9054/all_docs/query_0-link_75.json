        "text": "Bass History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland-Alt\n\nEngland\n\nGermany\n\nScotland\n\nThe name Bass was most likely taken on by someone who was a person of small stature having derived from the Old English word bas, meaning short. Alternatively, the name could have been derived from the French word bas which has the same meaning. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Bass family\n\nThe surname Bass was first found in Leicestershire where \"Bass is a Leicestershire name. Basse occurred in Cambridgeshire and Oxfordshire in the 13th century. Edward Bashe held the manor of Botelers in Prittlewell parish, Essex, in the reign of Elizabeth.\" 2\n\nFurther north in Scotland, ancient records there found the name in Aberbuthenoth where \"Andrew de Bas who was one of the jurors in a dispute regarding the Kirketun of Aberbuthenoth\" in 1206. Apparently, he derived his name from Bass in Aberdeenshire. 3 Bass Isle is found in the parish of North Berwick, county of Haddington. 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Bass family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Bass research.

Nevertheless, Huguenot surnames have been subject to numerous spelling alterations since the names emerged in France. French surnames have a variety of spelling variations because the French language has changed drastically over the centuries. French was developed from the vernacular Latin of the Roman Empire. It is divided into three historic and linguistic periods: Old French, which developed before the 14th century; Middle French, which was used between the 14th and 16th centuries; and Modern French, which was used after the 16th century and continues to be in use today. In all of these periods, the French language was heavily influenced by other languages. For example, Old French was infused with Germanic words and sounds when the barbarian tribes invaded and settled in France after the fall of the Roman Empire. Middle French also borrowed heaviliy from the Italian language during the Renaissance. Huguenot names have numerous variations. The name may be spelled Bass, Bassin, Bassen and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Bass family\n\nNotable in the family at this time was\n\nWilliam Basse (c.1583-1653), an English poet from Thame, Oxfordshire, a follower of Edmund Spenser and it best known for his eulogy he wrote about Shakespeare. 5\n\nJeremiah Basse (died 1725), was 5th Governor of East & West New Jersey (1698-1699.)\n\nBass Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Bass is the 456th most popular surname with an estimated 62,175 people with that name. 6\n\nLoading...\n\nBass migration to the United States +\n\nEarly records show that people bearing the name Bass arrived in North America quite early:\n\nBass Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nSamuel Bass, who landed in Braintree, Massachusetts in 1634 7\n\nJohn Bass, who landed in Virginia in 1637 7\n\nWilliam Bass, who landed in Massachusetts in 1638 7\n\nMr Bass, who arrived in Virginia in 1638 7\n\nGregory Bass, who landed in Virginia in 1642 7\n\n...
