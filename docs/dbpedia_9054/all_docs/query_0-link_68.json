        "text": "ELLISVILLE, MISS– Even though Lance Bass said “Bye Bye Bye” to Mississippi some time ago, he’s still showing love to Ellisville as his hometown.\n\nLance Bass was born in Laurel, grew up in Ellisville, then moved to Clinton where he graduated. Bass started his singing career with the Clinton High School choir before joining NSYNC, the popular boy band from the 90’s that produced hits like “Bye Bye Bye,” “Dirty Pop,” and “I Want You Back.”\n\nBass went on after the band’s breakup to make a documentary called “Mississippi, I Am,” which discusses the issues that the LGBT community faces within the state.\n\nThe meme used for the picture is part of a promotional campaign for the upcoming movie “Straight Outta Compton,” that’s being hosted by Beats by Dr. Dre.\n\nphoto from Lance Bass’s Facebook page."
