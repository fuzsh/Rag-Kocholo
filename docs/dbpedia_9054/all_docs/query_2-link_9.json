        "text": "History of the Bass Family\n\nThe history of the Bass family starts with the landing party of Captain John Smith, who set sail from England at the end of 1606, and arrived at Chesapeake Bay in April 1607. The settlement was named Jamestown and would eventually be known as the first permanent British North American colony. The Chesapeake Bay area of Virginia was home to 30 Algonquin tribes known as the Powhaten Confederacy.\n\nInitially the population of British colonists dwindled as the colonists succumbed to starvation and disease. Working with colony president John Ratcliffe, John Smith was tasked with overseeing the barter of food from the surrounding native tribes. On an expedition along the Chickahominy River, Smith was captured by a native band and taken to Algonquin Chief Wahunsonacock, whom the English referred to as Powhatan. It is said that Powhatan's 12-year-old daughter, Pocahontas, rushed to save Smith from being killed as he was held down. After this, Powhatan allegedly regarded Smith as a figurative \"son,\" granting him territory while having expectations of allegiance and mutual protection.\n\n(There are historians who question whether this event actually happened, as the relationship between Smith and Pocahontas has been largely romanticized by popular culture. It is also theorized that Smith might have been taking part in a ritualized acceptance ceremony as opposed to an actual execution. Powhatan possibly saw Smith as a resource in trade relations with the Europeans and the acquisition of arms, and hence wanted him alive.)\n\nUpon returning to Jamestown, Smith was imprisoned for losing men on the failed Chickahominy expedition and on suspicion that he would try to usurp control of the colony with his new allies. He was soon freed and relations between the Native Americans and the settlement went smoothly for a time. Pocahontas often visited the colony, arriving with her people as they brought goods.\n\nDue to a debilitating drought, Native-American food supplies were scarce, and the Powhatan community refused to supply its limited rations without the requested recompense; Smith responded by waging attacks on the nativesordering the burning of villages in some casesand stealing food. Native people were also imprisoned, beaten and forced into labor.\n\nIn 1609, Smith was badly burned from a gunpowder explosion following more conflict with fellow colonists. He returned to England both to recover and to face allegations of misconduct, thereby relinquishing leadership of the settlement. There are no records of a subsequent hearing or trial.\n\nAfter John Smiths departure, the natives cut-off all food supplies to the colonists. This became known as the starving time during the winter of 16091610 in which all but 60 of the 214 colonists died. There is evidence that the colonists resorted to cannibalism.\n\nPocahontas was kidnapped by the English during Anglo-Indian hostilities in 1613, and held hostage as a means of keeping her father from attacking their settlements. During her captivity, she converted to Christianity and took the name Rebecca. When the opportunity arose for her to return to her people, she chose to remain with the English. In April 1614, she married tobacco planter John Rolfe, and in January 1615, bore their son, Thomas Rolfe. Pocahontas died in England in 1617. Her father, Chief Wahunsonacock died in 1618, and was replaced by his brother, Opechancanough, who became the new Powhaten.\n\nA faction in the company led by the treasurer Sir Edwin Sandys had steered the company in the direction of integration of Indians into English settlements. Native families received houses in the settlements and funds were established for a college for Indian youth to Christianize and civilize them. Most assumed that Opechancanough and the Powhatan nation shared the idea of an integrated society. But, realizing that the abusive English were not here to trade, but instead were here to stay, Opechancanough, organized an offensive against the colonies on March 22, 1622. The attack became known as the Good Friday Massacre, where 347 settlers, men, women, and children were killed, and 20 women were kidnapped.\n\nThe night before the attack, an Indian boy, living with Richard Pace, was warned by his brother that an attack would occur in the morning. The Indian boy, known as Chanco, warned Pace of the imminent attack, and Pace rowed his boat 2 miles to warn the settlers of Jamestown. The colonists made preparation for the Indian raid, and consequently much of Jamestown and its settlers were saved. However, word of the impending attack did not reach outlying settlements and they were totally destroyed.\n\nThe Bass Family\n\nCapt. Nathaniel Bass was a merchant seaman, who transported indentured servants from England to the colonies. In the March 22, 1622 attack ordered by Powhaten, John, the four year old son of Nathaniel Bass, was taken hostage, and raised by the Nansemond Tribe. John married the Nansemond Chiefs daughter, Elizabeth, in 1638, and became the patriarch of the mixed-race Bass family line.\n\nJohn and Elizabeth had 8 children:\n\nWilliam, Elizabeth, John, Jordan, Keziah, Nathaniel, Richard, and Samuel.\n\nWilliam married Catherine Lanier, and had 7 children:\n\nJohn, Edward, Keziah, William, Joseph, Mary, and Thomas.\n\nJohn, the son of William and Catherine, married Love Harris in 1696.\n\nBecause Love Harris was white, they had to get married in North Carolina. Virginia had adopted apartheid laws, which were not yet enacted in North Carolina. John and Edward traveled together from Virginia to North Carolina, eventually settling in Granville County.\n\nJohn and Love had 11 children, one of whom was named Sarah.\n\nSarah married Lewis Anderson in 1732. Lewis was the mulatto son of Elizabeth Betty Anderson, a slave freed in John Fulchers will of 1712. Lewis and Sarah had a daughter named Tamor.\n\nEdward, the son of William and Catherine, married a woman identified only as Lovewell. Edward and Lovewell had a son named Edward II. Tamor married her 1st cousin Edward Bass II. Edward II and Tamor had a daughter named Prudence Bass.\n\nPrudence had son Jethro Bass, out of wedlock with Jesse Day. Jesse was an octoroon, that is, he was 7/8 white and 1/8 black. Jethro married Polly Mitchell in North Carolina. Polly was of Scottish descent, with a very impressive pedigree.\n\nOn Polly Mitchell's maternal side, we find great grandmother Anne Pace, and on her paternal side of the family we find 5x great grandparents Christoper Branch and Mary Addie. On Anne Pace's paternal side, is Richard Pace and Isabella Smythe. This is the Richard Pace we discussed earlier as the person who warned Jamestown of the impending Indian attack. Anne's maternal grandfather is Francis Poythress, who is the brother of Jane Poythress. Jane Poythress married Thomas Rolfe, who was the only child of Pocahontas.\n\nThe \"Jefferson and Madison Royal Descents\" book lists Christoper Branch and Mary Addie as 21st generation descendants of King Henry I of England. This also makes Polly Mitchell the 4th cousin of President Thomas Jefferson, and the 26th great granddaughter of King Henry I..\n\nFamous American Descendants of King Henry I, of England Pres.

Church, located on Hunt Road, in 1839, where he served as one of its pastors. That land was donated by Sam Malone. In the 1850s, the church was used as part of Indianas leg of the Underground Railroad. The church was destroyed by a fire in 1949, and was never rebuilt. A monument commemorating the churchs roll in the Underground Railroad, now stands in the SW corner of the church property. Jethro also served as a pastor at the Allen Chapel A.M.E. church in downtown Terre Haute, Indiana. That church also served as part of the Underground Railroad.\n\nLost Creek A.M.E.

When living in Honey Creek they were robbed of between four and five hundred dollars by four men, names unknown, who entered the house one evening about seven o'clock, and with cocked revolvers demanded their money, and as they were unarmed and helpless there was no alternative but to give up the money. They were greatly damaged by the loss of the money, as some of it belonged to other parties, and they were obliged to deprive themselves of many of the necessaries of life in order to repay it. Mrs. BASS also belonged to the ladies court of the Masonic order, which is now dissolved. She is one of those who by their example serve to cement the community together in which they live.\n\nHISTORY OF VIGO AND PARKE COUNTIES Together With Historic Notes on the Wabash Valley\n\nH.W.
