        "text": "Six weeks ago, I started working on this story, the final of a series on successful project positioning and marketing in the '70s and '80s. My research uncovered a good article written in Texas Monthly, April 1998, about how the famous Bass family led the charge to transform downtown Fort Worth into the safe and vibrant destination it is today. I also met with former partners Bill Lawley and Jack Huff to test their respective memories. We all remember different stories but have trouble with timelines. I will do my best to tie these together. It starts with two unrelated events.\n\nSometime in the mid-to late '70s, I received a phone call from a gentleman who introduced himself as Sid Bass. He was familiar with the successes we had in leasing major Dallas office projects and wanted to discuss something in downtown Fort Worth. I envisioned a block and a mid-sized building. The Bass name rang a bell, so I hightailed it on the next stage coach heading west to meet Mr. Bass and catch his vision. His \"block\" turned out to be what seemed to be half of downtown. His vision included office buildings, hotels, residential and retail, all in a safe environment, which no downtowns had at the time.\n\nThe other event, in May of 1979, The Swearingen Company hosted a large group of seniors and grad students from the University of Texas, some of these considering a future in real estate development or brokerage. After our presentation, a polite young man came up to me and introduced himself as Jack Huff, a senior from Lampasas, Texas. We visited briefly and he stated that he wanted to go to work in our company. The Swearingen Company was on a roll, having started seven years earlier. My advice was to go to work for IBM or Xerox, get their good sales training, and then come back and we will hire you and teach you real estate. You can imagine my surprise when I ran into young Jack Huff in the hallway outside my office in August 1979. He informed me that he had been hired in our management company. It turned out that Lawley had sold Burgundy Tower in Mid-Cities to the Basses and we needed to get it leased. Huff was hired and assigned to that outpost, where I figured I wouldn't see him again, at least not anytime soon.\n\nThe summer of 1980 broke all kinds of heat records. On one hot day, a press announcement was held at the Fort Worth Press Club describing the plans for two office towers to be designed by the world famous architect Paul Rudolph, head of the Yale architecture school. Sid Bass did the introductions. Sid would listen to our advice very well, with one exception. We advised that one tower should be sufficient considering the projected absorption in Fort Worth. What we didn't know was that the Bass interests were involved in a stock play for Texaco. Rumors spread that there was some big company looking at moving to Fort Worth, and that was the possible user for the second tower. This is where I met Richard Rainwater, who was involved in the Texaco deal. I later represented him and Crescent in the purchase of Continental Plaza (777 Main), which kicked off the Crescent REIT.\n\nWe were hired to lease the two office towers, but the fact that we were a Dallas-based company was brushed over quietly. A state-of-the-art marketing center was built and opened in Tandy Center. We came up with the name, City Center, which said it all. Now we needed a logo. A large PR firm was enlisted to work on the logo, but when they made their presentation, we were all underwhelmed. Lawley made a wild suggestion. His next door neighbor, Dan Latcha, was a very creative artist with a small shop in his garage. Lawley got Dan to take a swing at it, and the perfect logo was produced.\n\nA circular center with a \"C\" around it made out of bricks.\n\nMeanwhile, young Jack Huff was moving up the ladder, having leased Burgundy Tower for the Basses, then moving to Fort Worth and joining our leasing team on City Center. He got immediate attention by cold calling IBM and leasing them 200,000 square feet in the project. When our top leasing man lost favor with the Basses, we replaced him with Huff, who filled both towers with tenants. The office towers opened in 1983 and '85 on schedule. The beautiful Worthington Hotel opened with much fanfare. The private police force continues to this day to insure the safety of tenants and visitors to City Center and Sundance Square. Jack Huff went on to become the top office leasing broker in Fort Worth, later opening his own company. We all learned lessons from this successful project.\n\nWayne Swearingen, CRE, is a principal at Barclay Commercial Group and lives adjacent to the Katy Trail.
