        "text": "If we were going to sing somewhere, in a little church or high school, Mama was our driver. Mom was our piano player. Mom would lick her fingers and stick down a cowlick in the back, or whatever needed to be done. We had an old Rambler station wagon and pulled a trailer. We set up our own little sound system. And we’d just go in and sing our music – six or eight songs for the morning service and a few songs for the evening service. They took what they call a “love offering.” And sometimes they didn’t love as near as much as we needed them to! (Laughing) We could have used a little more love!\n\nLarry played football at Odessa High School, often against cross-town rivals Permian Basin High of Friday Night Lights fame. He graduated in 1966 and attended college at the University of Houston on a football scholarship, where he majored in English and planned to be an attorney. When not in class or on the field, Gatlin sang in the gospel group, the Imperials.\n\nAfter graduation, Gatlin met country star Dottie West. Impressed by his songwriting abilities, West recorded two of his compositions, circulated his demo tapes in Nashville, and, in 1972, even bought Gatlin a plane ticket to relocate to Music City. He soon found work as a backup singer for Kris Kristofferson and began turning out songs that would be recorded by the likes of Johnny Cash, Barbara Streisand, Tom Jones, and Elvis Presley.\n\nWith Kristofferson’s help, Gatlin landed a solo deal with Monument Records. He invited his brothers to Nashville to sing backup on his first two albums: The Pilgrim (1974) and Rain Rainbow (1975). Gatlin’s breakthrough hit, “Broken Lady,” peaked at No. 5 on the country charts in 1976 and was awarded a GRAMMY for Best Country Song. The same year, all three brothers were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry. 1977’s Love Is Just a Game featured the group’s first No. 1 hit, “I Just Wish You Were Someone I Love.” The success of the album encouraged the brothers to become an official trio and, in 1979, they signed with Columbia Records. The brothers scored numerous Top 10 hits from the late 1970s through the late 1980s and were among the first country artists to release music videos, like 1984’s “The Lady Takes the Cowboy Every Time.”\n\nLarry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers continue to tour and record. With 33 Top 40 hits, the brothers were awarded the 2010 ACM Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award, honoring their contributions to country music. Today, Larry appears on the Fox News Channel as a social commentator and hosts “The Gospel According to Gatlin,” a weekly gospel program on radio station WSM.\n\nBorn: May 2, 1948, Seminole, Texas"
