All Rights Reserved.\n\nIn its third season, Gossip Girl continues to explore the making of a mogul as Chuck Bass, heir to his late father Bart's fortune, attempts to live up to the family name. The elder Bass, who died in a car wreck last season, was a hard-dealing, self-made entrepreneur who earned his billions as the head of Bass Industries. But on the living, breathing Upper East Side, the Bass surname has an actual association: power couple Sid and Mercedes Bass. How much of the show's Bass story line finds its inspiration in the real-life Bass family?\n\nFictional Bass Family\n\nReal-Life Bass Family\n\nHistory\n\nChuck is the son of the late Bart Bass and his wife, Evelyn, who died in childbirth. In Season One, Bart married socialite Lily van der Woodsen (who has two children, Serena and Eric), but he died in Season Two, prompting his smarmy brother Jack to try to steal the family fortune from a grieving Chuck. Nonetheless, Chuck became the C.E.O. of Bass Industries after his father passed away.TKTKTKTKTKTK\n\nThe Bass dynasty's roots date back to Sid Williams Richardson, a self-made Texas oilman and rancher who was born in 1891. Richardson was a lifelong bachelor whose closest relative was his only nephew, Perry Bass. When Richardson died in 1959, Perry received stakes in Richardson's companies, and each of Perry's four sons (Sid, Edward, Richard, and Lee) inherited $2.8 million. In 1960, the sons pooled their assets, forming Bass Brothers Enterprises. The eldest, Sid, eventually took control of the family fortune. Sid and Robert parted ways soon after. Today Robert is a financier in Fort Worth, Texas, while Sid, who was drawn to New York society more than his brother, splits his time between the Upper East Side and the Lone Star State. This year, Robert is ranked No. 110 on the Forbes 400 list, with an estimated net worth of $4.5 billion. Sid and Lee (who is widely considered to be Sid's understudy) are ranked No. 334, with an estimated net worth of $2 billion, while Edward is No. 468, at $1.5 billion.TKTKTKTKTKTK\n\nPersona\n\nIn the first two seasons, Chuck was portrayed as a bad-boy Casanova. This season, he's started to drop his slick exterior, revealing a softer side.\n\nA 1988 New York Times article quotes one Bass business associate saying, \"There's not an ounce of sleaze in these guys.\"\n\nEducation\n\nChuck didn't go to college, but his girlfriend, Blair Waldorf, was obsessed with attending Yale (she didn't get in). Now Blair is a student at N.Y.U.\n\nAll of the Bass brothers went to Yale.\n\nBusiness Dealings\n\nChuck's father owned the New York Palace Hotel, and this season, Chuck purchased the Empire Hotel by cashing out his share in Bass Industries. He was spurred to buy the hotel when he couldn't close a deal to open a nightclub. (In the Gossip Girl book series, Chuck lives at the Plaza hotel.)\n\nThe Bass brothers are known for making major investments in publicly traded and private companies, with a portfolio comprising oil, tech, biotech, media, and real-estate investments. Traditionally, they've looked to take stakes in undervalued companies or assets. With the Japanese company Aoki Corporation, the Robert M. Bass Group purchased Westin Hotels and Resorts for $1.53 billion, in 1988. The deal gave the Bass Group ownership of Manhattan's storied Plaza hotel, which it sold to Donald Trump for $410 million that same year. (In 1994, Aoki sold Westin to Starwood Capital and Goldman Sachs; in 1998, Starwood assumed ownership of the company.)\n\nPublic and Private Lives\n\nChuck is constantly working to get the Empire Hotel in the gossip pages, employing such attention-getting tactics as opening a speakeasy at the hotel and hosting a party in the penthouse for Trip Vanderbilt when he was running for Congress. Meanwhile, his father's wedding to Lily van der Woodsen was the social event of the year.\n\nThe Basses don't really speak to the media, and they discourage business associates from talking to reporters, too. But a public scandal did erupt when Sid Bass, who was married to Anne Bass, wooed the then-married Mercedes Kellogg, in 1986. Sid and Mercedes both left their spouses and later married at the Plaza hotel, in 1998.\n\nThe Second Wives' Club\n\nLily, Bart's second wife, is a prominent New York City socialite and philanthropist. She's always been in love with Rufus Humphrey, a musician with whom she had an affair during her engagement to Bart. She later married Rufus after Bart died.\n\nLike her Gossip Girl counterpart, Mercedes Bass, Sid's second wife, is devoted to philanthropic causes including the Museum of Modern Art, Carnegie Hall, and the Metropolitan Opera, which received $25 million because of her largesse. One of the biggest socialites on the Upper East Side scene, Mercedes has created a home befitting the TV screen: her luxe apartment was decorated by Givenchy himself.\n\nA Curious Coincidence?\n\nThis season, the fashionable Serena van der Woodsen, Chuck's stepsister, decided not to go to Brown and took a job as a celebrity publicist, getting paid for helping her clients get into V.I.P. parties. Serena, who once lived with her mother at the Palace, helped Chuck open a speakeasy at the Empire after she sabotaged Chuck's deal with Sean MacPherson. (MacPherson happens to be a real-life New York City hotelier.)\n\nSerena reminds us of another prominent New York City Bass: Serena Bass, who hails from London and owns an A-list catering and party-planning company. She spent her early years in fashion and later lived at the Chelsea Hotel. She went on to open Serena, a swanky subterranean lounge at the Chelsea.\n\nRelated:\n\nThe Vanderbilts vs. the Buckleys"
