        "text": "In downtown Fort Worth, Perry Bass's four billionaire sons -- Sid, Edward, Robert and Lee -- own a gleaming 33-story skyscraper, where they operate out of offices on two of the building's upper floors. Three of the brothers own homes less than three miles apart, near where they grew up, on Fort Worth's west side; the fourth, Ed, lives downtown.\n\nThe Bass brothers, whose collective fortune is now estimated at more than $5 billion, became famous investing together in the early 1980's. Yet for the last several years, they have seldom worked together or been seen together in the same room.\n\nSid, who is 49 years old, and Lee, 35, still operate in concert, but Ed, 46 -- whose pet project Biosphere 2, an ecological experiment in Arizona, was launched two months ago with much fanfare -- invests his own fortune. Bob, 43, now one of the most aggressive financiers in America, not only wheels and deals on his own, but rarely speaks to his parents or to Sid or to Lee. The depth of the rift is little known to outsiders, who have long regarded the ultraprivate Basses as a monolithic clan. But the split has become a defining reality, its origins dating back to the early 1980's and reflecting clashing investment approaches, political beliefs and personalities.\n\nThe Basses, who generated headlines when they made phenomenal amounts of money, have been in the news lately for giving it away. Every few months since May 1990, one of the Basses has given a $20 million gift to Yale University, the Bass undergraduate alma mater. First it was Ed. Then Sid. Lee. Perry. Three weeks after the fourth gift, Bob announced his donation: an I-can-top-this $25 million, not to Yale but to Stanford University, where he had earned a master's degree in business and serves as a trustee.\n\nBob Bass's gift was announced on June 13 -- the same day that Perry and his wife, Nancy Lee, revealed an additional $30 million gift (to a variety of charitable organizations), for a total of $50 million, to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. According to family associates, Bob was well aware of his parents' elaborately planned announcement. But instead of attending their anniversary party, he spent the day in Palo Alto, Calif., at a meeting of the Stanford board. Aides to Bob Bass insist that he had no intention of overshadowing his father. His own gift, they say, simply coincided with the trustees' meeting.\n\nThe intrafamily strife is painful for Perry Bass, who labored for decades to build an empire that his four sons could run together. \"I thought of business as trying to develop something to pass on to those boys,\" he explained during a series of interviews this spring.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
