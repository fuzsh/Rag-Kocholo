        "text": "Doug Dimmadome didn’t make the Forbes list of decabillionaire dynasties but several other Texans did.\n\nThe publication explored some of the wealthiest families in America and how they made their money. Forbes ranked families worth $10 billion or more.\n\nForbes excluded individual billionaires, like Elon Musk, who are credited with the entire family fortune and appear on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. The number of family members is an estimate of the living descendants, according to the publication.\n\nThe list includes 45 multigenerational families, including these five families from Texas:\n\nNo. 9: The Duncan Family\n\nNet worth: $30 billion\n\nHometown: Houston\n\nThe Duncan family owns roughly one third of the stock in pipeline behemoth Enterprise Product Partners, cofounded by the late Dan Duncan in 1968, according to Forbes. He had four children, Randa Duncan Williams, Milane Frantz, Dannine Duncan Avara and Scott Duncan, who inherited a $10 billion estate in 2010.\n\nNo. 12 The Hunt Family\n\nNet worth $30 billion\n\nHometown: Houston\n\nThe Hunt family's fortune originates with oil wildcatter H.L. Hunt. The family owns the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs. Today, the heirs own fortunes ranging from energy, real estate and sports; sons Ray Lee and W. Herbert own Hunt Oil and Petro-Hunt.\n\nNo. 20 The Butt family\n\nNet worth $18.8 billion\n\nHometown: San Antonio\n\nThe Butt family owns an estimated 90% of Texas-based grocery chain H-E-B. The company has over 400 locations in Texas and Mexico and reported $43.6 billion of revenue for fiscal 2023. Florence Butt founded the company in 1905 after her husband was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was unable to work. Her son Howard Butt took over in the 1920s and expanded the company across Texas, renaming it the H.E. Butt Grocery Company in 1928.\n\nNo. 32 The Chao family\n\nNet Worth $14.2 billion\n\nHometown: Houston\n\nThe Chao family's Westlake Corporation is one of North America's largest producers of low-density polyethylene, used for food packaging. Houston-based Westlake is also a large PVC producer that operates in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nNo. 36 The Bass family\n\nNet worth: $13.3 billion\n\nHometown: Fort Worth\n\nThe four Bass brothers, Sid, Edward, Robert and Lee, each inherited $2.8 million from their oil tycoon uncle, Sid Richardson, after his death in 1959. Most of their holdings are private, ranging from hedge fund investments to stakes in aerospace firm Aerion and ice cream maker Blue Bell."
