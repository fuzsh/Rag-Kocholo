        "text": "The Hub City U.S. Postal Service office in Compton has been renamed to honor Private First Class Marine James Anderson Jr., the first Black Marine to be awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor.\n\nRep. Nanette Barragán, CA-44, and Rep. Maxine Waters, CA-43, hosted a dedication and plaque presentation on Wednesday to rename the post office at 101 S. Willowbrook Ave. in Compton. The solemn event was joined by family, community members, veterans and post office officials.\n\nAnderson, who was from Compton, enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in February 1966, after attending Centennial High School in Compton and Los Angeles Harbor College. After 10 months in the Marines, he was sent to Vietnam in December.\n\nAccording to his Medal of Honor citation, on Feb. 28, 1967, Anderson’s platoon was advancing in dense jungle northwest of Cam Lo on Vietnam’s central coast, outside of the village of Quang Tri Province, in an effort to rescue a reconnaissance patrol. When the group was ambushed, an enemy grenade landed near Anderson’s head, and he curled around it without hesitation. His body absorbed the major force of the explosion, saving the lives of several of his fellow Marines.\n\nThe attack was just after Anderson had celebrated his 20th birthday and his first anniversary in the Marines.\n\n“PFC Anderson was an American hero,” said Barragán in a statement. “His selfless actions in Vietnam saved the lives of his fellow soldiers. As the first Black Marine to win the Congressional Medal of Honor, it was important that we recognize his bravery and sacrifice here in his hometown… Thank you to Congresswoman Waters, Councilwoman Darden, Mayor Sharif, President Biden, and all of those who made this dedication possible today.”\n\nAnderson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by Paul R. Ignatius, then Secretary of the Navy, on Aug. 21, 1968, becoming first black Marine to receive the nation’s highest award for valor, officials said.\n\nThe ceremony comes after President Joe Biden signed off on Barragán’s 2020 proposal to rename the post office. Signed in Dec. 2022, H.R. 1095 officially dedicates the post office on Willowbrook Ave. as the “PFC James Anderson Jr., Post Office Building.”\n\nAnderson is buried in Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery in Compton. A park in nearby Carson, near Anderson’s home, has also been named in his honor.\n\nCity News Service and staff writer Allyson Vergara contributed to this report.\n\nEditor’s Note: This story has been updated to clarify the honor received posthumously by Private First Class Marine James Anderson Jr."
