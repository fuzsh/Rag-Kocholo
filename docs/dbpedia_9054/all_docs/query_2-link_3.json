        "text": "British-brother trio, Essex County, is known for their fusion of gritty, masculine, vocals; pristine, family harmony; and irreverent guitar playing. The exclusive mix has earned the “So Good” singers millions of streams and a spot on top of multiple Spotify playlists, including the New Boots Spotify playlist.\n\nThe Bass Brothers – Nate, Mark and Kieran – have performed together since they were children. At just 11 years old, Mark was selected by a panel of legends – Brian May (Queen’s lead guitarist), Steve Vai, and Eric Clapton – as UK’s Guitarist of the Year.\n\nIn the ’90s, the brothers formed a pop music group, Next of Kin, in which they signed their first record deal and toured Europe with some of the world’s most well-known pop stars. And to top it off, this group of talented brothers were finalists on the X Factor UK.\n\nMaking the leap to Nashville to pursue a country music career, the trio has received invitations to perform at some of country music’s most prestigious venues and festivals. In 2020,the band’s debut country hit, “So Good”, accumulated over 2 million streams and topped the CMT video charts for months. Propelled by that success, “So Good” (Extended Play) became their first and only video to debut on CMT! Later that year, their holiday song “Last Christmas,” was No.1 on Spotify’s Country Christmas playlist for the entire holiday season.\n\nIn 2022, Essex County released their follow-up, self-titled EP while they were in England to play multiple sold out theater shows and festivals.\n\nAll of this success makes Essex County poised to lead country music’s first British invasion!\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nPerformed at London Palladium alongside Brian May (Queen), Ronnie Wood (Rolling Stones) and Van Morrison 2023.\n\nPlayed and hosted CMA Fest International Stage at Wildhorse Saloon, the festival’s largest indoor stage 2023.\n\nBMI writer/artists.\n\nTopped Spotify‘s New Boots and Country Christmas playlist.\n\nTwice played at Ryman Auditorium.\n\nCurrently selling out 400 seat theaters in the UK.\n\nTwo EP’s generating more than 5 million streams.\n\nFormally known as ’90s pop stars, Next of Kin.\n\n25 years since Next of Kin’s Top 15 hit “24 Hours From You”\n\nEuropean “X Factor” finalist.\n\nGroup of the Year nominees at British Country Music Association Awards.\n\nEssex County guitarist Mark Bass, won Guitarist of the Year in the UK.\n\nPlayed the main stage at Key West Songwriters Festival multiple times.\n\nPlayed for 10,000 people at the largest ever Whiskey Jam.\n\nMultiple Top 10 videos on CMT.\n\nCMT’s only video EP.\n\nNate\n\nHi, I’m Nate! I am the lead singer and the oldest brother. I love playing the drums often as that is what I use to do in the band. I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and going on new adventures. Yes, I’m an adrenaline junkie! You can also find me in the gym in my down time.\n\nMark\n\nHi, I’m Mark! As the middle brother, I don’t share the same love of our adrenaline-rushed activities like the others. However, I do like go-karting. If I weren’t a musician, I’d love to be a Pro golfer. When I’m on the course, I find peace. I have practiced my golf swing as much as I have the guitar. I love painting, drawing, walking in the rain, going to the gym and sauna, and taking cold showers.\n\nKieran\n\nHi, I’m Kieran! You've already guessed it; I'm the youngest brother. I’m creative at heart. I loved to do anything adrenaline-based, like motorcycling and skateboarding. I enjoy painting and drawing in my spare time. Who doesn’t love to have fun? I like to use my hobbies and life-battles to express myself in my music. My life’s purpose is to LOVE and INSPIRE OTHERS!\n\nour testimonials\n\nI met the talented family band, Essex County when they came to Nashville a number of years ago. We wrote a song together and most likely due to both our schedules, never got to record together. I had the pleasure hearing them this past year at an All Star London Show and was blown away by their tight, Powerful and unique family harmony vocal style. Not only do they sing well but are seasoned and exciting live performers as well. I can honestly say that \"I'm a Fan of Essex County.\"\n\nJohn Oates\n\n\"We may never hear another sibling trio that sounds like Essex County in our life time, it is truly an experience\"\n\nRon Fair\n\nI've been working with the boys now for over 12 years. Amazingly talented and unique vocal blend, as well as great songs, wnd very exciting to watch onstage !!! The musicianship is stellar and totally self contained with Mark's great guitar playing and Nate in the drums.\n\nSteve Dorff\n\nThe first time I saw Essex County Live they had reimagined a song I'd co- written with John Bon Jovi & Richie Sambora for their band Bon Jovi called \"You Give Love A Bad Name.\" I was blown away by their musicianship and stage presence. Their blood brothers harmonies are spectacular.... It's in their DNA. If you get a chance go see or listen to Essex County they will give you goosebumps!\n\nDesmond Child\n\nPrevious\n\nNext\n\nSubscribe Us\n\nFAQ's\n\nIt can effortlessly be accomplished for a mere $125, making it a budget-friendly option for those on a tight budget.\n\nJoin our community and become a part of something bigger than yourself.\n\nYes, it is indeed possible and it only takes a total of 25 dollars!"
