        "text": "Who We Are\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\n\nThe Bass, Miami Beach’s contemporary art museum, creates connections between international contemporary art and the museum’s diverse audiences. The Bass shares the power of contemporary art through experiences that excite, challenge and educate.\n\nABOUT THE BASS\n\nThe Bass is Miami Beach’s contemporary art museum. Focusing on exhibitions of international contemporary art, The Bass presents mid-career and established artists reflecting the spirit and international character of Miami Beach. The Bass seeks to expand the interpretation of contemporary art by incorporating disciplines of contemporary culture, such as design, fashion and architecture, into the exhibition program. The exhibition program encompasses a wide range of media and artistic points of view that bring new thought to the diverse cultural context of Miami Beach.\n\nCentral to the museum’s mission, The Bass maintains a vigorous education program for lifelong learning and visitors of all ages. The Bass IDEAS education initiative uses art as a catalyst for creativity and positive growth, especially in the area of early childhood education. The active school program led by the City of Miami Beach called STEAM+, takes The Bass IDEAS off-site by engaging children in Miami-Dade County Public Schools and integrating arts education into the curriculum.\n\nDEAI (DIVERSITY, EQUITY, ACCESSIBILITY & INCLUSION) STATEMENT\n\nThe Bass is committed to Diversity, Equity, Accessibility & Inclusion. The Bass does not tolerate hate or discrimination of any kind against race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability.\n\nThe museum will address and identify areas for improvement with humility, transparency and assertiveness; and will create a path forward, comprising actions that contribute to a more just community.\n\nThe Bass defines diversity in its broadest spectrum including, but not limited to, race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical ability, religion, and political beliefs. The museum also recognizes that there is further nuanced diversity amongst all of these categories, and that the museum operates within the specific context of Miami. As The Bass strives to improve upon and better serve the changing demographics of Miami-Dade County, the museum commits to reviewing its DEAI plan on an annual basis as a key part of its strategic plan.\n\nNote: In such spirit, The Bass often hosts speakers, artists, cultural organizations and other guests as part of its programming and efforts to promote DEAI. The Bass disclaims that the opinions, values, ideas and thoughts of such speakers, artists, cultural organizations and other guests may vary from and not be representative from those of The Bass."
