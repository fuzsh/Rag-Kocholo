        "text": "They would both be ranked among the five richest men in America.\n\nUsing their two islands, San Jose and Matagorda, as a political base, they had a profound impact on the political careers of Lyndon Johnson and Dwight Eisenhower. Richardson, Perry Bass, Murchison and a coterie of other Texas millionaires would aide Johnson’s consolidation of congressional power and enable Sam Rayburn to be the longest-serving Speaker of the House in American history.\n\nBut Richardson’s nephew and partner Bass remembered the Clint and Sid who went broke in an oil play in 1920. “They moved into my mother’s house,” Bass recalled, “and were there until they could get back on their feet.”\n\nBass was like the son that the unmarried Richardson never had. The uncle was often stern and temperamental with the nephew. But through Bass’ four sons, the partnership he forged with Richardson still casts a long and interesting shadow over downtown Fort Worth, the Walt Disney Co., ABC and institutions like Yale University and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nOn Matagorda Island, the quiet, analytical Murchison spent four years building a self-sustaining compound.\n\nIn 1935, the boisterous Richardson discovered the massive Keystone Field in West Texas. He quickly became Murchison’s neighbor. He bought all 21 miles of San Jose Island, then known as St. Joseph, or just St. Jo.\n\nIn May 1937, when the presidential yacht USS Potomac anchored behind St. Jo during Roosevelt’s fishing excursion with his son Elliott, Bass was in Connecticut, about to receive a Yale degree.\n\nBut his Uncle Sid, so familiar with the arid emptiness of the West Texas oilfields, rode the train up to Connecticut to walk amongst the ivy-covered walls where he offered his nephew a job.\n\n“Bass, you are an engineer,” the oilman said, “and I want you to build me a house.”\n\nDuring the previous two decades, Richardson rode a financial roller coaster of wealth and penury. He lived in the spartan hotel guest quarters at the Fort Worth Club next to Perry’s widowed mother, Annie Bass.\n\n“My bachelor uncle had never had a home and wanted a home on the island,” Bass remembered.\n\nSo, as members of the Class of ’37 went to Wall Street, law school or medical school, Perry Bass went to the South Texas docks, where the July air was dense. As one visitor of the era described it, “The mosquitoes were the size of hummingbirds.”\n\n“My office in Rockport was the pay telephone booth in Mr. Moore’s Magnolia filling station,” Bass said.\n\nMr. Moore was J. Ed Moore, the former Rockport mayor who had unintentionally built a communications nexus when he installed a pay phone at his business at the intersection of Magnolia and Main, two short blocks from the waterfront.\n\nWhat made it essential was that it was the closest phone to St. Jo.\n\nWhen the White House or Chase Manhattan Bank searched for Richardson, the Rockport pay phone would ring.\n\nOn Matagorda, Murchison had a powerhouse to generate electricity, a runway, a network of oyster-shell roads, a harbor to load livestock, barns, staff housing, fresh water tanks and a main house that could sleep 35.\n\nHow much did it cost? When Richardson asked, a straight-faced Murchison told a whopper: “About $35,000.”\n\nThat is precisely how much Richardson gave to Bass to get the San Jose job done.\n\nAnd almost immediately, he took it back to buy an oil lease.\n\n“Any son of a bitch can build a house for $35,000,” he told Bass. “It takes a genius to build it with nothing.”\n\nUntil more money arrived, Bass’ currencies were charm, promissory notes and guile. First he built a Ford/Swank-designed barn with a soaring barrel vault. Initially, it stored thousands of blocks, which were fabricated on the island. “I had built on the job 93,000 shellcrete 8-inch by 8-inch by 16-inch building blocks,” Bass recalled. They were made “from a mixture of cement, oyster shell and beach sand that met American Cement Association specifications.”\n\nOn Jan. 2, 1938, mule teams began to dig the foundation.\n\nOnce Richardson’s cash flow was reanimated by a new oil discovery, the construction sped forward and costs upward.\n\nIn for more than $100,000, Richardson lied to Murchison, “I may have to spend about $75,000.”\n\nBy Thanksgiving 1938, the house was occupied.\n\nAdmiring the finished project, Murk asked his friend, “Sid, how much did you say this house cost you?”\n\n“I’m not going to tell you,” Richardson barked. “You got me into this, you SOB.”\n\nThe structure that Bass, Ford and Swank delivered was unprecedented and unique — a sophisticated fusion of European modernism and the traditional Texas ranch house.\n\n“It’s the only Bauhaus/ranch house/lodge there is,” says Perry’s son Ed Bass.\n\nIn the 1940s, Murchison sold Matagorda to his partner Toddie Lee Wynne. Throughout his life, he built similar stand-alone compounds at his private island off Tampico, his ranch in Tamaulipas and his farm in East Texas.\n\nBut for Richardson, San Jose was the sole home he would ever own.\n\nIt became the seat of his empire and the manifestation of his power to bend events toward his interests.\n\nThe house stands defiantly at the front gates of hurricane alley, where it has sustained only an occasional flesh wound when a hurricane hurls a seabird into a window.\n\nEven the interior was able to withstand the gales of ambition that roared their loudest during visits by LBJ.\n\nRayburn managed to choke down his aversions to cash when he was faced with the possibility of an ever-so-brief term as Speaker of the House.\n\nThe sudden death of Speaker William Bankhead elevated Rayburn to the speaker’s chair on Sept. 16, 1940.\n\nBut by October, the Democrats looked destined to lose control of the House on Nov. 5 in an anti-Roosevelt backlash.\n\nEnergized Republicans were well-funded by old-money conservatives antagonistic toward the New Deal.\n\nA frustrated Rayburn couldn’t find a warm body to captain his party’s fundraising. Recalled one Rayburn aide, “No one wanted to risk his political future by being congressional campaign manager for the House.”\n\nEnergetic and sweating ambition, 32-year-old Johnson was anxious to be a player. He pressed hard for a role as a party fundraiser. Rayburn was cautious. A more formidable roadblock was Democratic Party Chairman Ed Flynn, the Boss of the Bronx. When Johnson’s name was floated to be secretary of the Democratic Party, Flynn said that if Johnson were appointed, he’d resign.\n\nBut the situation was dire. On Oct. 13, 1940, Rayburn went to Roosevelt and asked that Johnson join the Congressional Campaign Committee to raise money.\n\n“Tell Lyndon to see me tomorrow,” Roosevelt said.\n\nThe president was not anxious to antagonize Flynn, so in a very brief Oct. 14 White House meeting with LBJ, Roosevelt made a vague accommodation. With the election three weeks away, Johnson was authorized to “assist the Congressional Campaign Committee.”\n\nJohnson called his chief benefactors, Texas’ Brown & Root Construction founders, George and Herman Brown, who wrote checks. The same day, Sid Richardson sent $5,000 in the name of Perry Bass. Clint Murchison sent another $5,000.\n\nJohnson set up an independent office and hired the young John Connally to field requests from desperate Democratic candidates across the country.\n\nOne week after meeting with the president, Johnson had $45,000 and triumphantly wrote to Rayburn aide Swagar Sherley, “We have sent them more money in the last three days than Congressmen have received from any committee in the last eight years.” And there was more on the way. On Oct. 28, Murchison and Wynne each sent $5,000 from their office at Dallas’ First National Bank Building.\n\nYears later, investigative columnist Drew Pearson wrote about the three-week check-writing binge in Texas: “The key figure in the money raising appears to have been Sid Richardson.”\n\nOn Nov. 5, 1940, Roosevelt got his unprecedented third term. The Democrats kept the House of Representatives and Rayburn kept the speaker’s gavel. Nothing had changed and everything had changed.\n\nCongressmen from districts in every corner of the country suddenly owed their seats to Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n\nIt was his first taste of national power.\n\nKittrell explained that his client Sid Richardson had booked a drawing room and invited the general to join them.\n\nIt was a historic collision of a future president and the future billionaire. As hundreds of miles of track clicked away, Texas receded and Washington approached — not the slow, mannerly Washington of the previous week, but a wartime Washington with a single-minded resolve.\n\nOn that ride, Eisenhower and Richardson began a sincere friendship that lasted the rest of their lives. Years later, Richardson told The Washington Post, “I thought he was a pretty good hand.”\n\nSunday morning, Eisenhower reported to the War Department and the office of Army Chief of Staff George Marshall.\n\nRichardson checked in at the White House gate, where security was dense.\n\nIt was one week exactly after the Pearl Harbor attack. Roosevelt was one of the few people on Earth who knew that Winston Churchill was on his way to Washington aboard the HMS Duke of York and would arrive at the White House for a month-long conference. Secretary of War Henry Stimson, Under Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal and the new Russian Ambassador Maxim Litvinov were on the president’s Sunday schedule.\n\nBut his first appointment that day was a one-hour-and-25-minute lunch where he quizzed Sid Richardson about the country’s ability to meet the inevitable demand for oil.\n\nReaching out to powerful Georgia Sen. Richard Russell, Johnson asked him to a weeklong party at St. Jo in November 1949. A loner bachelor and a voracious reader, Russell traditionally declined such invitations, but by ’49, he was considering a presidential bid in 1952. So he accepted.\n\nOn the island, Russell mixed comfortably with Richardson, Murchison, Herman Brown and Amon Carter.\n\nIn a thank-you letter, he wrote, “Dear Lyndon, Ever since I reached home I have been wondering if I would wake up and and find that I had just been dreaming that I had made a trip to Texas. Everything was so perfect that it is difficult to realize it could happen in real life.”\n\nRichardson liked Russell, but in his estimation, the real future leader was scheduled to arrive on St. Jo just days after Russell’s departure.\n\nIn December 1949, Eisenhower came to the island where he fished and relaxed before a speaking tour of Texas. When that tour reached Fort Worth, the general addressed 3,200 people at Will Rogers Coliseum.\n\nBill Kittrell, his hair starting to gray, was in the audience.\n\nAs the event ended, an unknown man approached Kittrell and handed the lobbyist a program autographed by Eisenhower. Underneath his name, Ike added a date: “Dec. 12, 1941.”\n\nThe general situation\n\nIt would be historical embellishment to suggest that Eisenhower ran for president because of pressure from Richardson and Murchison. By 1951, the Truman administration was mired in Korea and half the country was prostrate in front of Eisenhower practically begging.\n\nRichardson and Murchison didn’t beg, but they pushed. In early 1952, Eisenhower was in Paris and commander of NATO.\n\nIn February in South Texas, Ike’s good friend George Allen arrived on St. Jo for a conclave designed to get the general to commit to a White House run. The conclusion: a personal appeal was needed.\n\nAllen and Richardson traveled to NATO headquarters with two letters that asked the general to run. One was from evangelist Billy Graham. The second letter began with a statement in capital letters: “THIS ARGUMENT ACCEPTS AS A FACT THAT THE MAN WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.” Five pages later, the author signed his name: Clint W. Murchison.\n\nDays later, Allen and Richardson traveled with Eisenhower to England for the funeral of King George VI. While in London, Eisenhower confirmed to the two men that he would be a candidate for president in 1952.\n\nThe election of Eisenhower to the presidency signaled the return of Richardson to the White House. He enjoyed a level of intimate friendship with the new president that no man appeared to have shared with Roosevelt.\n\nWith Murchison, however, Eisenhower was more reserved and vice versa. At heart, Murchison was an introvert who did not have the same easy manner as his friend. He declined the invitation to the Eisenhower inaugural as well as subsequent invitations to the White House. Murchison was more interested in the victory than in the victory lap.\n\nBack to church\n\nMost photos of Richardson and Murchison show a cigarette or cigar in Sid’s hand and a cigarette in a holder between Clint’s fingers. Their shirt pockets have the telltale bulge of a cigarette pack. By the summer of 1959, both men had been slowed by health issues and spent more time at their respective retreats.\n\nWhen Richardson donated $100,000 in honor of his mother to build a Baptist church, he got what would be his final letter from “Murk.”\n\n“This is a great thing for you to do and I want you to know it should be an enduring tribute to your mother,” Murchison wrote. “May God put an aura around your head.”\n\nSix weeks later, Richardson called his friend, Phil Russell, a Fort Worth doctor recovering from surgery. The oilman said he’d recuperate better on the island. Together on Richardson’s cavernous airplane, they flew to San Jose on Tuesday, Sept. 29, 1959. While Russell got one of the downstairs guest rooms, Richardson took his normal place in the second-floor suite. To the east, he had a majestic view of his entire island and the endless horizon of the Gulf of Mexico. To the west, the big windows looked across Aransas Bay toward the mainland.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Richardson appeared to be sleeping when Russell came to his room. But when Russell returned at 9 a.m., he climbed the stairs again. He found Richardson dead of an apparent heart attack. He was 68.\n\nMurchison was on his plantation-like Gladoak Farm near their hometown of Athens. One of his workers informed him that people at the Athens City Cemetery were selecting a grave site for Richardson.\n\nMurchison grabbed the phone and dialed Perry Bass in Fort Worth.\n\n“Uncle Sid died in his sleep last night at St. Jo,” Bass said. “We wanted to make some arrangements before we called you, Clint.”\n\nReap the whirlwind\n\nThe house on Matagorda is low to the ground, built in a perpetual defensive crouch against hurricanes. But the Richardson/Bass house stands high and erect. O’Neil Ford knew that it had to be free from overhangs and projections that could tempt a violent wind.\n\nThe architect bragged that it was “tight enough to strum.”\n\nPerry Bass tested that design many times.\n\n“Nancy Lee and I developed the habit of going to San Jose Island any time there was a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico,” he said. “It is exciting to sit in the house I built and watch the storms.”\n\nStorms don’t get more exciting than the Category 5 Hurricane Carla that hit the Texas coast in mid-September 1961.\n\nAfter riding it out, Bass was still at the island house when he saw a bulletin that reported there were no buildings left on San Jose and very few livestock. According to Bass, “The truth of the matter was we had a cracked window in the kitchen and lost four aged cows that probably died of heart attacks in all the excitement.”\n\nPerry Bass died in 2006, and his wife, Nancy Lee, passed away in 2013.\n\nFrom the outside, their island house looks unchanged from the decades when it was a playground for Eisenhower and LBJ. But inside, the rooms are temporarily vacant. In a salute to their heritage, the Basses are giving the San Jose house a loving restoration. When complete, it will have many of the same O’Neil Ford/Arch Swank elements that impressed Clint Murchison and prompted his devilish inquiry: “Sid, how much did you say this house cost you?”\n\nNBC 5’s interview with Alan Peppard\n\nA note on sources: For this narrative, Alan Peppard interviewed members of the Murchison, Wynne and Bass families as well as Rick Pratt, director of the Port Aransas Museum; Sonny Perez with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service; and Felipe Prieto with the Matagorda Island Unit of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nIn addition, he used the following sources: Aransas: The Life of a Texas Coastal Colony by William Allen and Sue Hastings Taylor, foreword by Perry R. Bass, 1997; The Architecture of O’Neal Ford: Celebrating Place by David Dillon, 1999; The Path to Power by Robert A. Caro, 1981, 1982; Means of Ascent by Robert A. Caro, 1990; Master of the Senate by Robert A. Caro, 2003; The Lone Star: The Life of John Connally, James Reston Jr., 1989; Archival film of Lyndon Johnson on San Jose Island, 1951, LBJ Library; Clint: A Biography by Ernestine Orrick Van Buren, 1986; The Big Rich by Bryan Burrough, 2009; Crusade in Europe by Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1948;\n\nPart 3: Toddie Lee Wynne and the Reach for the Stars\n\nIn one toss of the coin, Clint Murchison lost ownership of Matagorda Island to his partner Toddie Lee Wynne. Forty years later, Wynne put his money behind the world’s first privately funded space launch, which blasted off from the island where he and Murchison once entertained Franklin Roosevelt. Read now"
