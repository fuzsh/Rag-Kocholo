        "text": "Sid Bass, his three billionaire brothers and their savvy dad Perry knew a year ago they had big troubles. But few on Wall Street ever made a peep.\n\nInsiders say there were flaws in the basic Bass strategy – mainly snapping up battered stocks to await their rise, as their stock picks had always done in the last decade.\n\nWith crossed fingers and faith they’d make more market killings, the family went about their social circuits and philanthropy from hometown Fort Worth to Paris, London and New York, where family scion Sid Bass sits on the board of the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nDespite Wall Street’s gathering clouds the last two years, some of the Bass boys and their billionaire dad took great sport, locals say, in testing their wits against Rusty the Bull. The stock-picking steer made uncanny picks at the Fort Worth Stockyards, a sprawling tourist attraction.\n\nRusty for years outdid a posse of professional advisers, including the Basses. In Rusty’s pen, the floor was covered with a grid of stock picks, and at the end of the day, Rusty let the chips fall where they may. In Rusty’s bull market, he’d often been right – but no more.\n\nThe Bass family’s fortune, which stood at $14.6 billion in mid-2000, was going the way of Rusty’s picks. Even before last week’s wipeout from the terror attacks, their portfolio was winding up with far more losers than winners.\n\nMore than half their wealth has evaporated, according to some estimates, with more than $2 billion alone lost when Sid and other family members were forced to sell the family’s crown jewels – a huge Walt Disney stake – at bargain-basement prices to meet a margin call.\n\nThe Disney stock, the cornerstone of the family wealth for a quarter-century, had swelled from $360 million to more than $12 billion in market value a year ago – accounting for the bulk of their stock wealth.\n\nThe Disney stock had been spread among the brothers: Sid, 57; Lee, 45; Ed, 56, and their 85-year-old father Perry Bass, as well as their families. Brother Robert, 53, split from the family business group nearly 30 years ago. He sold his Disney shares when his eldest brother, Sid, took the family reins, said sources familiar with the family holdings.\n\nThe family isn’t broke. Members also own significant holdings in U.S. Treasury and fixed-income securities along with real estate spread over Texas, sources say.\n\nAnalysts believe the Bass boys’ worst mistake was the sudden and mysterious breakup last October with their savvy money manager of 21 years – Tommy Taylor.\n\nIn order to recover cash, the Basses abruptly forced the liquidation of Taylor’s $700 million hedge fund, which they had launched with him as partners just four months earlier. More than half of the fund was Bass assets.\n\nIt was Taylor who had helped put family members into one winning gamble after another for decades. He especially helped the two richest brothers, Lee and Sid, whose personal fortunes a year ago were estimated by Forbes at $3.9 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.\n\nTaylor helped Sid put $100 million into a satellite radio start-up in October 1999, which tripled to $306 million. The firm, Sirius Satellites, won lucrative deals to put devices into Detroit’s new cars. But with the auto industry slump, Sid’s investment lost 94 percent of its value this year, leaving him with just $17.6 in paper worth on the deal.\n\nIn another winner, Tayor helped Sid engineer a brilliant management takeover of La Quinta Motor Inns in the mid-1990s. His $90 million investment soared to more than $600 million in just two years, when the lodging chain was acquired by Meditrust of Irving, Texas.\n\nThe Basses took much of that gain last year in Meditrust stock, now worth just $52 million.\n\nOne Wall Street arbitrage veteran said the Bass family had been living off the glory of the big Disney deal for years.\n\n“They thought they were geniuses because of the Disney investment,” the Wall Street executive said.\n\nThe Bass boys had split up the Disney booty into various family trusts, keeping all just below the 5 percent level that requires disclosures to regulators.\n\nBut when the margin call spread like wildfire through Wall Street, the Bass secret was finally out.\n\nThe big chunk of the Disney stock that was seized in the margin call – as much as half the total family holdings – had a $5.8 billion value last year. But the stock fetched just under $2 billion for the Basses in the fire sale.\n\nThe widest but unnoticed crack in the foundation of family fortune came well before the terror attack.\n\nOne of their most profitable investments, biotech high flyer Genome, had swelled to $1.3 billion last year for the stakes held by Sid and Lee. But it began a steady slide to wipe out $1 billion of market value, leaving them with just $392 million in paper value.\n\nAll year, the Bass gambles on the market went south.\n\nAmong Sid’s losers were its $100 million investment in Globalstar Telecommunications, which tanked two years ago, when a rocket carrying its satellites crashed. But Sid doubled up his holdings and was sitting on $290 million of market value, with stock peaking at $36. When the bottom fell out in recent months, the stock plunged to 28 cents a share, leaving the Basses holding $2.1 million of its shaky stock.\n\nDespite the widening cracks in the dam, Forbes magazine boosted family rankings of Bass brothers last year, although one Bass fell off the list – Sid’s former wife, New York socialite Ann Hendrick Bass, whose wealth had been about $560 million the prior year but fell below the $500 million threshold to be on the list.\n\nOther signs of financial stress also appeared.\n\nEd Bass, whose estimated wealth was $1.3 billion, had bankrolled a posh jazz club in downtown Fort Worth, the Caravan of Dreams, that was renowned for drawing world-class acts deep into the heart of Texas. After blowing millions during the 1990s, he finally shut it this summer and is leasing it to a restaurant.\n\nTo locals, it marked the family’s first retreat from its otherwise generous support of the arts. This spring, Perry still handed over his usual $6 million check to the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra.\n\nSid’s gamble in fiber optics also went flat. His 10 percent stake in CoreComm peaked a year ago at $197 million, but on Friday was valued at just $368,000 with the shares trading at 8 cents.\n\nEven in one of his rare hometown battles, which upset some locals, Sid Bass dropped the ball. He plowed $8.4 million into Fort Worth insurance services company Inspire Insurance last year, threw out its management in a nasty legal fight and saw the stock drop from a high of $34 to just 12 cents a share – making his original investment worth just $84,000.\n\nDespite the disruption of deals from the attack, the Bass boys are going forward with one that was postponed by the tragedy.\n\nAs one of the major shareholders of publisher John Wiley & Sons, the Basses got Wiley’s $182.6 million deal to buy the “For Dummies” manuals series back on track. They concluded the deal on Friday, earning $735,900 for the day on their shares when Wiley inched up 11 cents on the good news of the deal to close at $19.65.\n\nSince they bought the stake last year, it has lost 12 percent, dropping to $106.6 million from $134.7 million in value.\n\nAmong other Bass losers:\n\n* A $40 million stake in TradeCast is currently worth just $15.6 million\n\n* A $63.7 million stake of McMoran Exploration is now $20.3 million\n\n* A $52 million investment in Warnaco is now valued at $710,000."
