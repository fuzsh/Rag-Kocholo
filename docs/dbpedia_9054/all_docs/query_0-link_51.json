        "text": "White bass either spawn in freshwater tributaries, or on top of rocky shoals in a lake or reservoir. Spawning occurs as early as February in the southern United States through late May in some of their northern most range. White bass reproduce when water temperatures are approximately 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit. They do not build nests or form mating pairs. A female white bass will be followed by a group of male bass that will attempt to fertilize her eggs with their milt (sperm) immediately after she extrudes them from her body.\n\nOnce the eggs are fertilized, no parental care is given and, adult white bass return to open water to feed. Fertilized white bass eggs will hatch in about two days. Juvenile white bass may grow into adulthood within two years in southern climates, but it usually takes longer to reach adulthood in northern climates.\n\nWhite bass are a member of the temperate bass family and are a migratory pelagic (open-water) ?sh. They are most active during dawn and dusk. They spend most of their lives chasing schools of baitfish including various shad species, which are their favorite food.\n\nWhite bass commonly called sandbass are distinguishable from striped bass and hybrid striped bass by the singular tooth patch on the tongue.\n\nThese are a very popular recreational fish species and are managed by state recreational fishing regulations.\n\nWhite bass are a member of the temperate bass family and are a migratory pelagic (open-water) ?sh.
