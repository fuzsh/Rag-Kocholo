Bass Brothers is the professional name for the team of Mark and Jeff Bass, the Detroit producers responsible for grooming rapper Eminem in his early days and collaborating on much of his subsequent music. They are credited under F.B.T. Productions for their work with him.

Although Interscope marketed Dr. Dre as Eminem's major producer in order boost his credibility as a white rapper in the hip-hop community, the Bass Brothers have in fact produced more individual tracks for the rapper than Dre. However, all of Eminem's hit singles have been either produced by Dre ("My Name Is," "The Real Slim Shady," and "Just Lose It") or himself ("Without Me" and "Lose Yourself,") although Jeff Bass did help Eminem produce the latter two songs.

Both have won Grammy Awards for their work with Eminem. Jeff Bass won a Best Song Oscar in 2003 for cowriting "Lose Yourself" from the film 8 Mile.

The Bass Brothers also head a Detroit record label called Web Entertainment, home to both rock artists (the Romantics) and hip-hop acts (King Gordy).
