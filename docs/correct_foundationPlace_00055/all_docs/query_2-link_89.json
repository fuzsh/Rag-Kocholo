        "text": "Since its inception in 2018, the Food Systems Dialogue (FSD) in India has focused on contextualizing the global discourse on food systems transformation for the Indian stakeholders. While the degree of interdependency between the actors and processes responsible for the entire spectrum of activities within the food systems has increased over the years, governance mechanisms for these actors and processes have tended to take place in silos, resulting in its fragmentation. These systems have also failed to achieve nutrition security and livelihood security for small and marginal farmers, resulting in the urgent need for transformation of the food systems.\n\nWe recognize the need to leverage the richness of ideas generated during past FSDs and take the deliberations forward to shape the national pathways for the transformation of food systems. Organised in collaboration with Bharat Krishak Samaj, FSD 2023 will seek to identify the policy scenarios with an enabling potential as well as the urgent accelerators and entry points for initiating a sustainable food system transformation. It will lay emphasis on the precise short and long-term measures that need to be implemented for the transition. It will also look forward to delineating the scenarios and elements that may impede the transformation process.\n\nRead the FSD 2023 Background Note, follow the #FSDIndia2023 hashtag on social media, or browse the agenda and session concept notes below to find out more.\n\nAgenda\n\nThe three-day conclave will witness – high-level plenaries; focused dialogues on key topics such as financing the transition, creating effective data support for catalysing the transition, future of the markets, production systems, support systems for farmers, and health and nutrition with an informed group of stakeholders; talks by special guests on cross-cutting and emerging issues; and several side events by external partners.
