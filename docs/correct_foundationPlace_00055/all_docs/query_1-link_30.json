        "text": "When the organizations on the front lines of our communities are supported, we are all winners.\n\nThe Princeton Area Community Foundation recently announced awarding over $2 million in funds to local non-profits. These funds were allocated from the PACF’s Community Impact and COVID-19 Relief and Recovery Fund. More than 60 organizations working on a broad variety of needs in the community, including arts education, community building, education, food insecurity, health, supporting senior citizens and other vulnerable populations, and youth development received this funding, made possible by the generous support of community contributions. One such beneficiary was Greater Trenton, which will utilize these funds to create equitable opportunities for residents and catalyze economic development in the city by addressing career pathways, affordable housing, and job creation.\n\nMany of the funds organizations received were unrestricted, allowing them to address their unique challenges of economic uncertainty due to factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation. In addition, by leaving the funds available, organizations are empowered to use them where they are needed most, offering community organizations the opportunity to build financial and programmatic resiliency.\n\nPer Jeffrey M. Vega, President and CEO of the Princeton Area Community Foundation, “These nonprofits are doing impactful work in the region, helping the most vulnerable among us. We are able to award these grants thanks to generous donors who have created funds over the last 30 years to support our community grantmaking and leadership.”\n\nMuch of this funding will be utilized to support youth programming and uplifting the next generation of New Jerseyans. Another major priority was funding organizations who address food insecurity and support vulnerable populations. Among the largest grants were $150,000 to the Foundation for Educational Administration for its Healing Centered Engagement program focused on supporting schools to help staff identify and help children experiencing trauma. In addition, a $115,000 grant was given to Arm In Arm, which works with Housing Initiatives of Princeton to prevent evictions. Finally, a $100,000 grant was given to Mercer Street Friends, working with the Boys & Girls Club of Mercer County to expand its Community Schools model in Trenton.\n\nThe Princeton Area Community Foundation is a philanthropic powerhouse in the Central Jersey community. The PACF utilizes its resources to provide key non-profit organizations with continued funding to meet the challenges of the times. For years, the PACF has brought philanthropists and organizations together to help maximize giving for some of our community’s most important causes.
