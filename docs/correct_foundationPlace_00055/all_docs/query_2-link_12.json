        "text": "Are you an OpenSSF contributor and have something to say about security that would be of interest to the open source community?\n\nWrite a guest post for our blog!\n\nAbout the OpenSSF Blog\n\nThe primary goal of the OpenSSF Blog is to provide informative and educational content about open source software security to the wider open source community, demonstrate thought leadership, share important milestones, and highlight the value of getting involved in the work of OpenSSF.\n\nBlog Guidelines\n\nWe aim to keep OpenSSF blog posts short and focused on what’s newsworthy, what’s cool, and what’s important to our community. We encourage links to source material for longer descriptions and deeper dives. Content should be presented in a conversational way that provides insight from the author’s expertise and perspective.\n\nTopic Area: Stick to topics directly relevant to open source software security and the OpenSSF.\n\nTone: Friendly, yet authoritative with a preference for first person voice.\n\nWord Count: For summaries and updates – 500+ words. For technical deep-dives – 1,500+ words\n\nStyle: Focus on readability. Write for the non-expert. Spell out acronyms upon first use. Break content into easily digestible parts with headings.\n\nAttribution: Identify author(s) and affiliations. When possible, try to have authors from multiple organizations to demonstrate breadth of support and collaboration.\n\nIntent: No sales pitches or product marketing pieces please. While it is ok to highlight the work of an individual company when it ties into the overall theme of the blog, any company or product mentions must be directly related to OpenSSF work, remain balanced, and not be at the expense of others. Blogs exclusively or primarily about a for-profit-company’s products or services will not be accepted.\n\nImages: Relevant graphics like charts, graphs, and photos are encouraged.\n\nSubmission Process\n\nIf you’d like to suggest a topic area or volunteer to write a post, send an email to blog@openssf.org with your name, topic, and few lines describing the post you’d like to write. We’ll let you know if we think your topic would be a good fit for our blog. You may use the template below to get started.\n\nTopic Proposal Template:\n\nTopic:\n\nObjective:\n\nHeadline:\n\nAuthor(s) (Name, Title, Organization, short <60 word bio):\n\n1-3 Key Points:\n\nCall to Action:\n\nValue to Community:\n\nTarget Publish Date:\n\nGraphic(s):\n\nNext Steps:\n\nOnce topic is approved, draft and submit the blog post. The review process for blog posts is generally 2-3 weeks using a shared Google document to capture inputs and make suggestions. The OpenSSF Editorial Review Panel will review the blog and make publication decisions. Once the author has approved the final post, OpenSSF will schedule and publish the blog; provide author with the link; share with members and on OpenSSF social media channels. Don’t forget to share with your own networks too!"
