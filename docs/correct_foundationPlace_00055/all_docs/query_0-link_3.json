        "text": "Several times a year, the question of \"How are the monarchs doing?\" rises in my mind. An internet search typically ends up at Chip Taylor's blog on Monarch Watch. There you will find thoughtful commentary and deep analyses, a mixture of good news and bad news, as this extraordinarily resilient species faces ever greater challenges. In 2024, overwintering numbers in Mexico were the second lowest ever recorded, with 2013 having been the lowest. Chip's more recent posts tell of a rebound this summer, as this robust and prolific species has increased its numbers during its migration, following the growth of milkweed north in a tagteam of successional generations, spreading into all corners of the eastern U.S..\n\nI've had maybe five sightings of monarch butterflies this summer--a typical number. One appeared frantic, as if it had been searching the great outdoors in vain for a partner. Another was laying eggs on a patch of common milkweed at Mercer Meadows--a beautiful and hopeful sight. Another was in my front yard on busy Harrison Street in Princeton, gathering nectar on a swamp milkweed. A few days ago, one was nectaring on a patch of narrow-leaved mountain mint near Herrontown Woods. I was treated to a surprising display of butterfly aggression, as several skippers suddenly ganged up to chase the monarch away from the mountain mint.\n\nPart of that competitive fervor may have to do with the scarcity of pollinator plants. In a 4.5 acre field, there were only two small patches of mountain mint. Since forests don't supply summer nectar, meadows like this are where monarchs and other pollinators are going to find food and each other. Many meadows and roadsides are being taken over by mugwort, Chinese bushclover, and other invasive species with limited utility for pollinators. Add that threat to all the others: habitat loss, climate change, indiscriminate herbicide use along roadsides. This meadow is preserved, but that's really just the first step in realizing the meadow's potential as habitat that can help sustain species like our beloved Danaus plexippus, aka monarch butterfly.\n\nWhen I look at a plant, a garden, a meadow, a forest, I can see the future. It's a form of extrapolation, defined in the Oxford Dictionary as \"the action of estimating or concluding something by assuming that existing trends will continue.\" I only realize now, writing this, that not everyone exercises such powers. Not everyone has been a gardener of landscapes for fifty some years, accumulating memories of myriad plant species and observing their behaviors. I've seen thriving raingardens and neglected ones, healthy meadows and forests, and degraded ones. I've observed how various invasive weeds spread and come to dominate, each in its own manner and at its own pace. These are the accumulated data points used to predict the future.\n\nOne very satisfying thing about extrapolation is that I can see, in my mind, the flower a bud will become. But with that same power to see a garden blooming while still in bud, I can look at a garden in what for others is glorious bloom and see the \"seeds\" of ruin--the scattered pockets of invasive mugwort, nutsedge, stiltgrass or lesser celandine, crown vetch or Chinese bushclover that without early intervention will quickly expand and ultimately prevail.\n\nMy interventions--a broad mix of successes and failures--have taught me above all that early intervention can make the difference between hope and despair.\n\nOne special garden in town that I stop by to check up on, like an old friend, is the Betsey Stockton Garden planted atop the Firestone Library at Princeton University. This is a complex native planting, containing 35 native grassland species. The person or crew maintaining the garden needs to be able to recognize and identify all 35 intended species, plus all the weeds that could potentially cause problems, not only when they're blooming but at all stages of development.\n\nThat deep knowledge is a tall order. Knowing how little respect maintenance often gets, I worry about this meadow garden in the longterm. Will it receive the knowledgeable, strategic attention it needs to thrive? This photo of wild bergamot blooming with lots of clumping goldenrods suggests things are going well.\n\nHere, some black-eyed susans lend color, but the pink blooms of quickly spreading non-native crown vetch spell trouble.\n\nNew to me is a weed called rabbits foot clover, which may have hitchhiked in from whatever distant nursery the intended plants came from. This, too, was not caught early, and now poses a significant challenge. Thankfully, there's only one small patch of the fearsome mugwort, but that could quickly expand if not dealt with quickly. Getting as close to zero tolerance for invasives as possible makes maintenance much easier.\n\nMaintenance is not given its due in part because success is often invisible. In a house, we note dirt's presence, not its absence. A well-run government agency doesn't make it into the news. The bass player who provides the harmonic foundation for a band often goes unnoticed until he plays a wrong note. In medicine, catching problems early doesn't pay as well as dramatically rescuing someone whose problem has grown into an emergency. Extrapolation can help with this. It allows us to see large consequence in small acts, to appreciate how big a problem has been avoided by digging up a small, isolated patch of mugwort.\n\nI found a few relevant local writings. One was an opinion piece in the Daily Princetonian by an undergrad, calling for more native plantings on campus. Planting is a good start, but what goes unmentioned in the opinion piece is that maintenance determines any planting's fate.\n\nOne strategy being used in newer native plantings on campus is to plant gardens with only three or four species, with lots of mulch inbetween plants. This reduces the amount of training required for maintenance.\n\nOther local writing specifically about the Betsey Stockton Garden can be found in the Princeton Magazine. It includes the list of intended plants (below), and describes the garden as low-maintenance, but that assumes the invasive weeds will be caught early and removed before they can spread.\n\nThe Betsey Stockton Garden was planted in 2018, two years after the demise of another campus native planting, around the Neuroscience Institute. Hopefully some lessons are being learned, and the University will bring the necessary expertise and strategic timing for maintenance to bear on this lovely, botanically complex planting.\n\nNative Plants Featured in the Betsey Stockton Garden\n\n(Some are used on the High Line as well.)\n\nGrasses:\n\nCarex comosa, Appalachian Sedge\n\nCarex pensylvanica, Pennsylvania Sedge\n\nFestuca ovina, Sheep’s Fescue\n\nFestuca rubra, Creeping Red Fescue\n\nSporobolus heterolepis, Prarie Dropseed\n\nElymus virginicus, Virginia Wild Rye\n\nSchizachyrium scoparium,\n\nLittle Bluestem\n\nTridens flavus, Purple Top\n\nShade Plants:\n\nAqueligia canadensis, Wild Columbine\n\nAster laevis, Smooth Blue Aster\n\nBlephilia ciliata, Downy Wood Mint\n\nErigeron puchellus, Robin’s Plantain\n\nEurybia divaricata, White Wood Aster\n\nPolemonium reptans, Jacob’s Ladder\n\nSisyrinchium angustifolium, Narrow Leafed Blue-Eyed Grass\n\nSolidago caesia, Blue-stem Goldenrod\n\nSolidago flexicaulis, Zig-Zag Goldenrod\n\nFull-Sun Plants:\n\nAsclepias tuberosa, Butterfly Milkweed\n\nAster laevis, Smooth Blue Aster\n\nAster pilosus, Heath Aster\n\nBaptisia alba, White Wild Indigo\n\nBaptisia perfoliata, Catbells\n\nCentaurea cyanus, Cornflower\n\nChamacaesta fasciculata, Partridge Pea\n\nCoreopsis lancelota, Lanceleaf CoreopsisEchinacea pallida, Pale Purple Coneflower\n\nEchinacea purpurea, Purple Coneflower\n\nMonarda fistulosa, Wild Bergamot\n\nPenstemon digitalis, Beard Tongue\n\nRudbeckia hirta, Blackeyed Susan\n\nSolidago juncea, Early Goldenrod\n\nI wasn't expecting to run into an outbreak of gypsy moths in New Jersey earlier this week. The aim of driving up to the Stokes State Forest near Delaware Water Gap was to drop off my younger daughter Anna so she could resume her thru-hike on the Appalachian Trail.\n\nAfter a couple day visit at home, Anna was eager to continue her journey northward towards Maine. When we reached Sunrise Mountain Overpass, she asked if I wanted to hike along with her for a bit.\n\nIt was as if she had invited me into her home, which the AT has been since she began in Georgia back in late February--more than 1000 miles thus far. Everything she needs is in her backpack--designed to be lightweight but still very substantial--as she hikes up and down mountain after mountain, rain or sunshine, cold or hot, following America's verdant eastern spine through North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and now just the northwestern tip of NJ before heading into New York state. Most of the inspiring vistas she sees along the way are not tempered with a warning about venomous snakes, like this one at the parking lot. New Jersey is unusual in having venemous snakes in the north and south of the state, but not where we live in central Jersey. As for black bears, over three months she has seen only one and heard another. Though she started the hike on her own, there's now a group of companions with whom she camps each night. As we hiked the rocky trail, we had to look mostly down to avoid the stones, stealing glances at the high quality woodland, free from invasive plants except for an occasional garlic mustard. We soon became aware, however, of an odd noise that sounded like a light sprinkle, despite the clear sky. When I turned back, leaving Anna to head north on her many steps towards Maine, I started taking a closer look at the leaves of oak, sassafras, and maple above. The well-munched leaves were surely a very generous giving of tissue by the trees to the local insect population. But what was that sound of rain with no rainclouds in sight? And why was the ground littered with fragments of green leaves? Whatever was eating the trees was being messy about it.\n\nThen I felt something very light fall on my head. I brushed it onto my hand, gave it a good look, and decided to call it frass, that is, caterpillar droppings.\n\nOn the ground all around, the leaf litter had been in turn littered with this frass, raining down from far above. Though most of the caterpillars remained unseen high in the canopy, a few were close enough at hand to get a photo.\n\nBack home, searching the internet, the caterpillar's identity quickly became apparent: gypsy moth, also known as Lymantria dispar dispar, and more recently renamed \"spongy moth.\"\n\nOne source described exactly our experience along the trail:\n\n\"Gypsy moths are invasive insect pests that can be destructive to trees, especially hardwoods like oaks. In May and June, each caterpillar can grow up to two inches long and consume 11 square feet of leaves. Signs of a gypsy moth outbreak include bare tree canopies, droppings that sound like rain, and leaf confetti on the forest floor.\"\n\nIf you haven't heard of gypsy moths, or haven't heard of them in a long time, it's because this highly destructive introduced species is no longer causing widespread havoc in our forests. thanks to the development of a remarkably successful, low-toxicity treatment.\n\nImported into Massachusetts from Europe in 1869 with the intent of starting a new silk industry in America, the gypsy moth escaped into the wild and was soon causing dramatic defoliations of forests. Though oaks are a favorite, gypsy moths threaten a broad range of species, including both hardwoods and conifers. One source alphabetically describes its diet this way:\n\nPreferred: Alder, apple, aspen, basswood, birch, hawthorn, oaks, tamarack, willow, witch hazel\n\nIntermediate: Beech, dogwood, elm, hemlock, maple, pine, Prunus species, serviceberry, spruce, walnut\n\nAvoided: Ash, balsam fir, cedar, red & white, locusts, mountain maple, pine, scotch\n\nAccording to numerous articles found on the Papers of Princeton website, 13 years of intense spraying led to eradication of the gypsy moth in NJ by 1932, but it reappeared in 1953 and by 1955 had again become a serious pest. In 1965, a small area near Mt. Lucas Road in Princeton was sprayed. As defoliation increased statewide through the 1970s, the most common treatment--carbonyl, also known as Sevin--became suspect due to its effect on honeybees.\n\nLetters to the editor describe heroic citizen efforts to round up and destroy the moths' egg cases. Elizabeth Carrick, chairman of the Woodfield Reservation Committee, described a successful outing by girlscouts in 1972. In 1980, Preston and Helen Tuttle reported on a hand collection campaign in the Institute Woods that included renowned faculty at the Institute for Advanced Studies:\n\nDuring the past two weekends. 95 individuals, ranging from Girl and Boy Scouts to world-famous mathematicians, took part In all. 8.791 egg cases were collected or immobilized witn a hand held sprayer containing a mixture of creosote, turpentine and transmission fluid This was used to spray those egg masses that were above convenient scraping and collecting reach Egg masses collected the first weekend were given to the state Biological Controls Laboratory to feed gypsy moth predators being developed by the state.\n\nDestruction peaked in 1981, when 12 million acres were affected by defoliation nationwide. The biggest reason we haven't heard much about this hugely destructive pest lately is the utilization of a low-toxicity bacteria called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). First mention of it in local papers appears to have been in 1974. Bt is sprayed on foliage in the spring. When eaten by the caterpillars, it disrupts their digestive systems. By 1990, arborist Sam deTuro of Woodwind Associates, who used to have a regular column in the Town Topics, was combining the traditional chemical spray methods with a new formulation of Bt.\n\nLike the many mountains and valleys of the Appalachian Trail, moth numbers have risen and fallen dramatically through the decades. Gypsy moth numbers in NJ reached a relative low in 1988, only to rise 19 fold in 1989. Another peak came in 2008, prompting aerial sprays of Bt in Princeton.\n\nNumbers have dropped since then, leading many of us to forget about gypsy moths altogether. For that luxury, we have a state government program to thank. The New Jersey Dept. of Agriculture has been running a gypsy moth suppression program at least since 2007. In 2024, they planned to spray 3000 acres of local and state-owned land. The aim is to prevent repeated defoliation of forests. Trees that can survive defoliation one year may not be able to survive defoliation two years in a row. The state description sounds like what governments are supposed to do--work collaboratively to intervene in safe ways to protect us and our environment. LDD stands for the species name, Lymantria dispar dispar.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Agriculture promotes an integrated pest management approach, which encourages natural controls to reduce LDD feeding and subsequent tree loss. However, when LDD cycles are at a peak, natural controls have difficulty in preventing severe defoliation. In these special cases, the Department recommends aerial spray treatments on residential and recreational areas using the selective, non-chemical insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis.\n\nThe Department's LDD Suppression Program is a voluntary cooperative program involving New Jersey municipalities, county agencies, state agencies, and the USDA Forest Service.\n\n17 miles down the trail, Anna was still hearing the curious rain of frass all around, Hopefully the state program of gypsy moth suppression will continue to work--an all-too-rare example of successful containment of invasive species threatening our forests.\n\nBelow, some sights seen during my short hike on the Appalachian Trail:\n\nExpanses of sedge meadow that can give healthy forests a natural park-like appearance.\n\nThe striped maple, Acer pennsylvanicum, is a little tree that grows all along the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nIf you hike northward on the AT with the spring, much of your journey will be graced with the blooms of Mountain laurel, Kalmia latifolia, abundant on rocky slopes."
