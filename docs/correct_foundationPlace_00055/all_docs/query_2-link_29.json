        "text": "My son’s cystic fibrosis diagnosis turned our world upside down, but the real shock came when I learned I also have CF.\n\nInitially, I was reluctant to start a new medication, but once I began taking Trikafta®, everything changed. I could breathe easier, sleep soundly, and, for the first time, feel a sense of freedom from the constant focus on my health. Now, I’m navigating the new challenge of finding my identity after Trikafta.\n\nEvery year, teens like me advocate for cystic fibrosis — either sharing their own experiences with CF or speaking on behalf of a loved one. This experience can have a huge impact on us, even after we return to our daily lives.\n\nEven though our son had cystic fibrosis, we found hope in the drug Trikafta®. Side effects forced us to make the difficult decision to take him off the medication.\n\nDiscovering I had bronchiectasis led to my cystic fibrosis diagnosis at 67 years old. But the delay in diagnosing my bronchiectasis highlighted a lack of awareness about this disease.\n\nNavigating my daughter’s cystic fibrosis is not something I thought I would be doing alone. However, my focus remains on her health and happiness as I learn to adjust to life as a single mom."
