        "text": "The Princeton Athletic Club Foundation\n\n\"To create, support and enhance amateur rugby in central New Jersey.\"\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn more about our organization. The Princeton Athletic Club Rugby Foundation is a fully recognized 501(c)(3) corporation with the broad intentions of furthering the sport of rugby in New Jersey and enriching the rugby community in the Princeton area.\n\nOur sport and club is much more than just a game. Instead, it is the nucleus of something much greater. It is a reason for past generations to meet with a present, a haven for families and friends to congregate, and an avenue to create bonds with the local community. We hope that this endeavor can give birth to a small piece of the rich tradition that much of the world celebrates.\n\nOur men's club was established in 1974, and we compete in three seasons throughout the year. We are now developing youth teams and have goals to continue to expand rugby in Central New Jersey. The PAC High School Rugby team staged their inaugural season in 2009 and continues to be strong. In 2014 we helped launch the Bridgewater High School side. Since 2010, we have been holding youth clinics for boys and girls every summer, ages five to fourteen. We look forward to award a college rugby grant in our name and providing better equipment for all of our teams. Ultimately, our long term goals revolve around providing a central location that all our teams can call home."
