        "text": "New to validating computerized systems? If so, it might be difficult to get started on this type of validation. Why? Because, even if you have experience in another area of validation, you will have to deal with new, unfamiliar terms. After all, it’s a very technology-related topic. In this article, you will learn what GAMP is, what GAMP categories are for, and where to start if you are facing computerized systems validation.\n\nCurious? Be sure to read on!\n\nWhat are GAMP (5) categories for?\n\nGAMP categories are mainly used to subdivide computerized systems according to their complexity. In this way, the validation strategy can be focused on the points where the system is riskier.\n\nThe more complex a system is, the greater its risks will be. These risks primarily involve data integrity, product quality, and patient safety.\n\nWhat is considered a configuration?\n\nThe configuration of a computerized system refers to the values ​​that are assigned to a certain variable of specific software, which do not imply changes or modifications of the original functionalities, but rather indicate how the system should work to adapt to the needs of the users in the context of their processes.\n\nWhy is there no GAMP category 2?\n\nGAMP category 2 is currently in disuse because, when the categories were defined in version 4 of GAMP, firmware had its own characteristics that differed from the rest of the categories.\n\nNowadays, firmware has evolved to the point the majority is counted as category 3, 4, or 5. So, when GAMP 4 transitioned to GAMP 5, category 2 was removed but the numbering was not changed, leaving only categories 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nConclusion\n\nGAMP categories are useful for classifying systems according to their level of complexity to determine a validation strategy that can meet the requirements, but more importantly, to focus on the issues that pose a significant risk to the functionality of the systems.\n\nNew in systems validation and need help with kick-off? Our experts are happy to assist you with the best validation program according to your available resources. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions."
