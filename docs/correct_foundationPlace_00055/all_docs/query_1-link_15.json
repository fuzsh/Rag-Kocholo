        "text": "National Character Education Partnership\n\nThe National Character Education Partnership was created in collaboration with the National Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. This program focused on the development of character education programs in K-12 education and has been largely responsible for creating these programs in public and private schools in all 50 states. The Character Education Partnership is now an independent nonprofit organization that serves as the leading resource for people and organizations that are integrating character education into their schools and communities.\n\nExperiential Education Initiative (EEI)\n\nThe Experiential Education Initiative was created in 1999 to provide crucial âstart-upâ support for Princetonâs efforts to create opportunities for community-based learning for its students. Today, EEI is known as the Community Based Learning Initiative (CBLI) and is run by the Office of the Dean of the College at Princeton University.\n\nTuberculosis Initiative (TBI)\n\nThe Tuberculosis Initiative focused on the worldwide eradication of tuberculosis at a moment when multi-drug resistant TB was threatening to explode. Princeton Project 55 initially served at the convener for organizations like the World Health Organization, the US Constitutional Defense Council, USAID, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the American Lung Association. Princeton Project 55 was a founding member of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.\n\nCivil Society and Community Building Online Course\n\nIn 2003, Princeton Project 55 developed a 14-week online course focusing on Civil Society and Community Building, which was offered in collaboration with the Universityâs Alumni Council. The course included readings, taped discussions by experts, an on-line forum, and a three-day exploration of relevant sites and issues in Chicago. It was designed to provide a theoretical and practical overview and explored various strategies for effective community change, and has since served as a model for other groups interested in similar curriculum.\n\nCivic Values Initiative (CIV)\n\nThe Civic Values Initiative was adopted as a Princeton Project 55 program in 2002 as an effort to encourage Princeton University to live its motto: âPrinceton in the Nationâs Service and the Service of all Nations.â Charlie Bray, CIVâs proposer, principal promoter, and Program Leader, used to say that âwe would know we had succeeded when it is taken for granted that to be a Princetonian is to be an active and effective citizen and community participant.â CIV staff developed, coordinated, and supported key initiatives that brought civic engagement to the forefront among students, alumni, faculty, and on-campus groups including the 2003 Civic Engagement Week and the Civil Society and Community Building Online Course. Another success of CIV was the formation of the Civic Values Task Force (CVTF), a group of Princeton undergraduates supported by Princeton Project 55 studied the civic engagement opportunities at peer institutions and published a report on their findings including recommendations for initiatives at Princeton University in November 2004.\n\nPublic Health Fellowship (PHF)\n\nThe Public Health Fellowship (PHF) was adopted in 2006 in an effort to recruit and develop a new generation of public health professionals by providing them with outstanding, life-altering year-long employment experiences in the public health field. Jim Gregoire â69 and a committee of passionate Princetonians were instrumental in developing and administering the PHF. The PHF was incredibly successful in engaging new alumni, partner organizations, and students in the public interest. We continue to build on the success of the PHF through the Project 55 fellowship program."
