        "text": "Welcome Glee Club Alumni!\n\nWelcome to the website of the PUGC Foundation (‘the Glee Club Foundation’), the alumni association for the Princeton University Glee Club (‘the Glee Club’). We are excited to launch the Glee Club Foundation as we prepare for the exciting 150th Anniversary Celebration of the Glee Club on November 15-17, 2024. We are planning to celebrate the Glee Club’s 150th Anniversary with three days of events that honor all eras and repertoires (TTBB and SATB) of the Glee Club. The festivities will commence with a headline performance by the King's Singers and include many opportunities for singing, education and camaraderie. The Glee Club Foundation is planning a series of events leading up to the 150th Anniversary, so stay tuned for announcements and updates. So as not to miss any of these exciting events, please register with the Glee Club Foundation to ensure we have your up-to-date contact information (button below).\n\nWe congratulate the great Glee Club Class of 2023 and welcome them as alums. Their achievements and contributions to the Glee Club have been extraordinary. We also salute Gabriel Crouch, the Director of Choral Activities, on his inspired leadership of the Glee Club over the past 11 years. Gabriel has crafted a world class and inclusive choral program at Princeton that has mentored and welcomed everyone from first time singers to aspiring young artists. We are all deeply grateful for Gabriel's many contributions to the choral program at Princeton and beyond.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at upcoming events and concerts.
