        "text": "Very few people can retire without the stress of worrying about money. If you’re like most people, you’ll face a critical task when you reach retirement to make sure that your assets are able to support you through your lifetime.\n\nCash flow is king here. Quite simply, you must have enough income to pay for your living expenses. This is no easy task, especially as people are living longer today than ever before.\n\nTo help keep you on track and get you to a positive cash flow, there are a few key steps to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, make a plan. You want to get a clear picture of your financial situation, which includes your projected income and expenses. Start by creating a detailed net worth statement, which will give you a comprehensive overview of your assets, debt, and cash on hand.\n\nNext, assemble an accurate budget that itemizes your income and expenses. If you anticipate any major lifestyle changes after retirement, make these notations. Include your anticipated income during retirement, such as Social Security, pension, and other income streams. Include all of your expenses, prorating them on a monthly basis. When you finish creating your statement, look for any cash flow issues that might arise, and then find areas that will help you improve your income/expense balance.\n\nRevisit your planning tool regularly and readjust the figures if your actual income and expenses change. As you monitor your finances, there are several items that could impact your cash flow in profound ways, including interest rates, tax rates, healthcare costs, and life events. Continually assess and revise your plan as necessary to account for their impact.\n\nBy developing and monitoring a budget during retirement, you minimize the possibility of cash flow issues that could otherwise constrain your lifestyle expectations.\n\nFor help in planning carefully, look to your financial professional for assistance.\n\nContact First Financial’s Investment & Retirement Center by calling 732.312.1534 to speak with professionals who can help steer your finances in the right direction. You can also email mary.laferriere@lpl.com or maureen.mcgreevy@lpl.com\n\nSecurities and advisory services are offered through LPL Financial (LPL), a registered investment advisor and broker/dealer (member FINRA/SIPC).

At First Financial, we are committed to nurturing financial literacy and growth from a young age. Here are some practical tips to help your children develop strong financial habits that will benefit them throughout their lives.\n\n1. Start by Including Them in the Conversation\n\nYou may not think to discuss money and finances with your children, but opening up these conversations early can help them grasp the importance of financial literacy and health. Start by teaching them the value of currency by having them earn money through simple tasks. Set savings goals and when they’ve reached a goal, discuss whether to spend the money earned on something they want now or to save it for the future. Pose the discussion around wants and needs and let your kids think through what is more important. This simple practice can instill lasting financial insights and habits. As your children get older, bring new topics into the conversation such as large purchases like cars, bills and expenses, as well as credit card use and debt. The more you discuss with them, the more prepared they will be for the financial realities to come.\n\n2. Open a Savings Account and Encourage Financial Goals\n\nOpening a savings account provides a safe place for your child to store their money, and helps them learn about interest and savings growth from a young age. For a great start, consider our First Step Kids Savings Account designed for Monmouth and Ocean County NJ children up to 18 years old, with no minimum balance requirements or fees and an opening deposit savings match of up to $25.* Once you’ve opened a savings account, set savings goals that can be tied to something your child can look forward to – a new toy, a special outing, or future education costs. Creating a visual savings chart can make this process engaging, and it’s also a good idea to plan monthly check-ins so your kids can watch the money grow in real-time.\n\n3. Teach Budgeting Basics\n\nIntroduce the concept of budgeting by helping your child create a simple budget. This could include tracking their allowance, gift money, and any small earnings from chores or part-time jobs. Come up with some small ‘expenses’ so they can understand cash flow, and how to ensure you always have enough money to cover expenses, add to savings accounts, and have some left for miscellaneous spending and emergencies too. As kids reach their teenage years and beyond, our First Financial Student Checking Account for ages 14 to 23 – can facilitate this process with online banking features and electronic statements to make tracking easy.\n\n4. Reward Academic Achievement\n\nIncorporating financial rewards for academic success can motivate children to excel in their studies while learning the value of hard work. Our Dollars for A’s Program rewards Monmouth and Ocean County kids for getting A’s on their report cards, by depositing $1 for each “A” received into their First Step Kids Account.** These rewards keep kids focused on the importance of education and financial growth, while also ensuring their milestones are acknowledged and celebrated.\n\n5. Make Learning Fun\n\nTurn financial education into an engaging activity through contests and challenges. Every summer, our Reader Rewards Summer Reading Contest encourages kids to read books and earn rewards, making learning about finances more enjoyable. From now until the end of August, First Financial kids can earn $1 per book this summer – up to 10 books!+\n\nFirst Financial is dedicated to fostering financial literacy and independence in young people. Our children and student accounts offer the perfect blend of education, practicality, and fun to help your kids develop strong financial habits. Start their journey to a secure financial future today! For more personalized assistance and tailored solutions call 732.312.1500, visit a branch, or explore our services online.\n\n*Parent or guardian must bring both the child’s birth certificate and social security card when opening a First Step Kids Account at any branch location.
