        "text": "Our Company\n\nJM Group was founded in 1981, with the opening of the highly-acclaimed Nassau Street Seafood and Produce Company, in Princeton, NJ. Our mission was simple – consistently provide the best, freshest seafood and produce available, while offering exceptional personalized service.\n\nJM Group has expanded through the years with the addition of Blue Point Grill, Witherspoon Grill and The Princeton Farmer’s Market. Each establishment is committed to offering customers superb food that is simply, yet beautifully prepared, sourced from top farmers, fisherman and ranchers. Warm, friendly service and an inviting atmosphere create unique experiences at each location.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of excellence in quality and service, JM Group is the recipient of many accolades awarded by The New York Times, Wine Spectator, Food & Wine, Food Arts, and Zagat.\n\nJM Group is proud to be active in many community-based philanthropic endeavors including Pink Pearl Night, benefiting the YWCA Princeton’s Breast Cancer Resource Center.\n\nFamily run has a special meaning for us and we consider each member of our team one of our own. We enjoy being a part of the community and are proud to serve you."
