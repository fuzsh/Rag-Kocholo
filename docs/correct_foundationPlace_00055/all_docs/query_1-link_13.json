        "text": "The Jewish Community Youth Foundation (JCYF) is a Jewish youth philanthropy program for teens in 8th through 12th grade. Each group donates $7,200 to distribute to different Jewish non-profit organizations.\n\nThe students meet six times between October and March in the Princeton area to discuss Tzedakah, assess the kinds of programs and issues they wish to explore, invite specific agencies to apply for funding, and arrange for site visits to those agencies. By the end of the year, each group meets to debate and decide how their dollars will be donated.\n\nThis progressive curriculum begins with incoming eighth graders who focus on local Jewish agencies that provide assistance to those in need. Each year progresses to a different focus, as ninth graders explore regional and national agencies, tenth graders investigate Jewish arts and culture, eleventh graders focus on outreach and advocacy, and twelfth graders learn about philanthropy in Israel.\n\nThe Jewish Community Youth Foundation is one of 133 similar programs around the country, and ours is a model that is receiving national attention. The goal is to develop a new generation of Jewish Philanthropists; judging by the reactions of the participants and their parents, it is well on its way to success.\n\nFor more information, please contact Celeste Albert at 609-987-8100 or [email protected].\n\nThe Jewish Community Youth Foundation is a project of Jewish Family & Children's Service and is funded by the Ricky and Andrew J. Shechtel Philanthropic fund and the Jewish Federation of Princeton Mercer Bucks"
