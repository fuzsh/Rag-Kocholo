        "text": "Princeton is a community in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. It is best known as the location of Princeton University, which has been sited in the community since 1756. Although Princeton is a \"college town\", there are other important institutions in the area, including the Institute for Advanced Study, Educational Testing Service (ETS), Opinion Research Corporation, Siemens Corporate Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sarnoff Corporation, FMC Corporation, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Amrep, Church and Dwight, Berlitz International, and Dow Jones & Company.\n\nPrinceton is roughly same distance from both New York City and Philadelphia. Since the nineteenth century, it has been connected by rail to both cities by the Princeton Branch rail line to the nearby Princeton Junction Station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.[1][2] Princeton is close to many major highways that serve both cities, and receives some TV and radio broadcasts from each.\n\nThe Princeton train station was moved from under Blair Hall to its present location on University Place in 1918.[1] Commuting to New York from Princeton became commonplace after World War II.[3] New Jersey Transit provides shuttle service between the Princeton and Princeton Junction stations; the train is locally called the \"Dinky\",[2] and has also been known as the \"PJ&B\" (for \"Princeton Junction and Back\").[4] Two train cars, or sometimes just one, are used.\n\nNew Jersey's capital is the city of Trenton, but the governor's official residence has been in Princeton since 1945, when Morven in the borough became the first Governor's mansion. It was later replaced by the larger Drumthwacket, a colonial mansion in the township. Morven became a museum property of the New Jersey Historical Society.\n\nIn 1783, it was the capital of the United States for a few months.\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Princeton Companion, by Alexander Leitch: \"Harper, George MacLean\"\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 \"Princeton University: Train Travel\".
