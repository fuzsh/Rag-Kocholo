If you want to start a blog fast, though, feel free to use the numbered steps above as a quick cheat sheet. You can go directly to the step you need the most help with, or grab a cup of coffee and read it all the way through.\n\nWhat is a blog?\n\nWhile a blog can encompass an entire website or simply be its own section of a website, this is a place to share content about a topic you’re passionate about. A blog will typically include both written and visual elements published in an easy-to-read, article format so visitors can swiftly browse and find what they’re looking for. And with over 31.7 million blogs in the US alone, you can literally find blogs about every subject out there, from home renovation to baking to local business marketing strategies. Once you’ve established a community of readers, the possibilities are truly endless.\n\nThere's no definitive \"perfect\" time to start a blog. If you feel that you have the time and resources to start, manage and promote a blog and are enthusiastic about sharing your ideas with the world, it might be the right time to take the plunge and start your blogging journey. The sooner you start, the sooner you can learn and grow as a blogger.\n\nReady to start your blog now? Sign up with Wix today.\n\n01. Choose a blogging platform\n\nThe first step in starting a blog is to select a blogging platform or Content Management System (CMS) for publishing your content. A quick Google search will show you that there are several different sites available that suit bloggers from all industries. I recommend Wix because it’s a good all-around blogging platform that satisfies most needs.\n\nWix’s blogging platform is fairly straightforward to get the hang of, and it offers a variety of attractive design options and templates to work with. In addition, it comes with features to analyze your blog’s performance and monetize your content, which will come in handy as you setup your blog and build your readership.\n\nHow much does it cost to start a blog?\n\nWhen researching how to create a blog, one of the biggest questions people have is how much does it cost to start a blog. On many platforms, starting a blog is completely free.\n\nYou can decide at any point whether you’d like to upgrade to a variety of different plans, depending on your budget and needs. Learn more about how much does it cost to build a website.\n\n02. Pick a hosting platform\n\nOnce you select your preferred blogging platform, you’ll need to choose a hosting platform. A blog, like other types of websites, requires a host. This essentially stores websites on a server under a unique address so that visitors can easily reach them.\n\nfaqOn some blogging platforms, hosting is already included, so you won’t need to find a separate web host when setting up your blog. In that case, you can skip this step and move to Step 3.\n\nWith other website builders, such as WordPress, you will need to find and pay for a separate web hosting platform. Some popular options include:\n\nBlueHost\n\nHostGator\n\nGoDaddy\n\nDreamHost\n\nIf you’re not sure which web hosting platform to choose, take into account these factors:\n\nUptime:The amount of time that the server hosting your website is up and running. A strong uptime rate (99.95% or above) is a good indication that the host’s servers perform well.\n\nBandwidth: The amount of data your website can transfer to visitors over a certain period of time. This factor is based on the size of your website pages as well as the amount of traffic you expect. This quick bandwidth calculator can help you determine your site’s bandwidth.\n\nCustomer support: Customer service you can contact in the event something goes wrong. Ideally, your hosting provider should offer an online help center, offer callbacks and respond to questions and concerns on social media.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen your blogging platform and hosting provider, you can start coming up with your blog idea.\n\nDon’t worry about picking and registering your domain name just yet. We’ll walk through that process together in Step 4.\n\n03. Find the right profitable blog niche\n\nLet’s move away from the technical and dive into the more theoretical. Take a step back and think about the main element that will form the foundation of your blog, from its URL and domain name to its content and design: your blog’s niche. What, exactly, do you want your blog to be about?\n\nThere is virtually no limit when it comes to your choice of subjects. The most crucial thing is that you select a specific topic area that will be the central focus of your entire blog and its content strategy.\n\nPossible blog types range from fashion blogs to real estate blogs to book blogs or food blogs. Because there are lots of other blogs focusing on the same subjects, you’ll need a way to stand out while still writing about what you love.\n\nHere are three simple steps for choosing the perfect blog niche—one that not only is in line with your passions, but one that you can also monetize and grow:\n\nNarrow down your interests\n\nResearch your audience\n\nCheck if it’s profitable\n\nNarrow down your blogging interests\n\nWhen you start a blog, think long term. To motivate yourself to blog regularly, you’ll need to write about something you’re genuinely interested in. If you choose a topic solely on the basis of its being popular or profitable, your efforts will peter out pretty quickly, along with your entire blog content strategy.\n\nIf you aren’t sure right off the bat what you should be blogging about, that’s okay. Begin with a simple brainstorming session about subjects you like. What do you get excited talking about? What are you eager to learn more about?\n\nNow, write down the first five to 10 interests that come to mind. For the sake of this example, let’s say:\n\nTravel\n\nCooking\n\nFamily\n\nMusic\n\nHiking\n\nNext, think about your more specific interests within these subject areas and add them to your list. Your additions might look something like this:\n\nBackpacking in Southeast Asia\n\nVegan recipes\n\nRaising twins\n\nIndie rock music\n\nHiking in the Rockies\n\nDon’t worry about these niches being perfect just yet. You’ll research them more thoroughly in the next steps. (However, if you're looking for inspiration, check out how these popular art blogs are using their platforms to connect with audiences who share a similar passion.)\n\nResearch your audience\n\nThe next step of starting and creating a blog is to learn which topics people are interested in reading about. If your blog gains traction, you can eventually start making money from it and become a full-time blogger.\n\nYou can determine the demand for any given niche with a bit of market research. Begin by taking a look at Google Trends, which shows you how many people are searching for a particular topic. The more searches a topic gets, the more public demand it has.\n\nFor instance, let’s type “vegan recipes” into Google Trends. In the image below, you’ll see that there’s a relatively stable level of interest in this topic, so it’s a good candidate for a blog niche.\n\n“Paleo recipes,” on the other hand, has a much lower degree of interest. This doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea—some bloggers prefer to write for a more specific crowd if they have a unique specialty—but it does mean there are fewer people interested in that particular subject area.\n\nIf Google Trends reveals that interest in a subject area is either very low or declining, then that topic is unlikely to gain traction.\n\nCheck if it’s profitable blog niche you want to start\n\nWhether you run a personal blog or a professional one, it’s a good idea to check whether your niche is profitable. Even if you’re starting out as a hobby blogger or want to create a fan website, you’ll want to think about future monetization options in the event that your blogging efforts evolve into a career.\n\nThere are multiple ways to earn money as a blogger, but one of the most common methods is affiliate marketing. As an affiliate, you’ll work together with a specific company, providing a link to their products within your blog, and earning a commission for any sale made through your site.\n\nConsidering whether you could blog as an affiliate is a good way to figure out if your niche is profitable. Think about the kinds of “best of” or “how to” posts you might write. For instance, “Best kitchen appliances for easy cooking” or “How to make carrot cake in 10 minutes.” In both instances, you could include an affiliate link to your favorite food processor or electric mixer and make money for each purchase made through your blog.\n\nYou don’t need to plan out your money-making strategy just yet, but thinking generally about profitable opportunities can help you choose a niche. For now, focus on starting your blog—we’ll talk more about making money blogging in Step 10.\n\n04. Select a blog name and domain\n\nAs you think about how to make a blog, the question of what to name it is probably lurking somewhere in the back of your mind.\n\nThere are three main routes you can go with your blog's name. These include:\n\nYour first and last name\n\nThe name of your business (if you have one)\n\nA creative new name\n\nWhen choosing your blog’s name, you should also think about the personality you want it to reflect. Should it be formal and professional? Sweet and romantic? Edgy and offbeat? If you’re stuck on names for your blog, this blog name generator is a helpful source of inspiration.\n\nOnce you decide, you should also go ahead and choose your domain name for your blog. Also referred to as a URL, a domain is a site’s address on the web (this website’s domain name, for example, is www.wix.com). Typically, your domain name will be the same as, or at least influenced by, the name of your blog.\n\nIf you really want your blog to stand out, consider a .blog domain extension. It's a clear and unique way to help your blog and content pop.\n\n05. Set up and design your blog\n\nChoose a blog template\n\nDecide which pages to include\n\nGet indexed on search engines\n\nCreate a blog logo\n\nAt this point, you’ve chosen a blogging and hosting platform, domain name and blog niche. You’re now equipped with all the basics for setting up your blog. Here's how to optimize your blog design:\n\nChoose a blog template\n\nThe first part of setup for a blog is selecting a template. Like your blog’s name, its look and feel will be an important part of its personality.\n\nThe most efficient way to get your blog up and running is to choose a pre-designed blog template. Afterwards, you can customize it based on your preferences.\n\nBe sure to pick one that conveys your blog’s subject area. There are website templates for bloggers of any genre, whether you’re a food blogger, photography blogger or business blogger. As you browse, think about the mood you want your website to communicate, for example. whether it’s classic, modern, rugged or minimalist.\n\nYou should also take that into account as you further personalize the template with your preferred colors. Color psychology plays a huge role in forming your audience’s impression of your blog. As you choose a color palette, keep in mind the feelings and attitudes that different colors evoke. Blue, for instance, tends to evoke dependability and trust, while yellow evokes energy and joy.\n\nIf you’re unsure of which templates to choose, these blog examples serve as a helpful source of design inspiration.\n\nDecide which pages to include\n\nOnce you’ve chosen a template, think about which pages to include. Most blogs include more than just a section to display their posts. They might also include an online store, as in the image below, or a contact page.\n\nHere's an overview of the different options when designing your blog:\n\n01. Contact page: This is a place to put your email address so that fans and potential business partners can reach out to you. You can also include a contact form so that people can send a message directly through your site.\n\n02. About page: This tells visitors who you are, what you do, and why you do it, providing some context behind your blog and humanizing your content.\n\n03. Online store: You’ll also want to add a separate online store page if you’re thinking of selling items related to your blog. You can call this page “Products” or “Shop.”\n\nIf you want to beef up your blog with even more pages, a Tutorials page, Now Trending page or Author’s Pick page are all popular options.\n\nFurthermore, some blogs opt to place their posts directly on the homepage, while others keep their homepages and blog pages separate. If you do this, make sure to include a navigation menu so that visitors can easily access your blog as well as any other pages.\n\nThere’s no right or wrong way to set up a blog, so play around with different options to see what best suits your style and personality. Keep in mind that you can always add or remove pages over time as your blog evolves.\n\nGet indexed on search engines\n\nAnother part of starting a blog is making sure it’s visible on Google and other search engines. This is crucial if you want your content to pop up in search results, so you’ll want to take care of this step right away.\n\nFirst, make sure your site is indexed on Google. Essentially, this means giving Google a heads up that your blog exists. You can do this by submitting your sitemap to Google Search Console.\n\nPro tip: Google Search Console is not only important for indexing your site, but it’s also a valuable platform that you’ll be using throughout your blogging journey. It tells you important data about your blog’s site visitors and clicks, which you can use to improve your content.\n\nTo find out whether your site is already included in Google’s search index, do a quick site search (a site search uses your homepage URL and takes the form of site:yourblogname.com). If your blog pops up in the search results, then your site is already indexed.\n\nCreate a blog logo\n\nFinally, polish off your site with an attractive blog logo. This is another way to add personality to your site, and it’s an essential step if you want to create a blog that evolves into a recognizable brand.\n\nOne option is to design your own or outsource the task, but you can also use an online logo maker. These tools give you plenty of room to customize your logo with your preferred colors, fonts and icons, and tend to be quicker and more affordable than hiring a professional designer.\n\nOnce you create your logo, place it in the upper left-hand corner of your website, and link it to your homepage. This will help brand your content while improving the navigation experience for readers.\n\n06. Brainstorm blog topics\n\nOn the technical side, your blog is now setup and ready to go. It’s time to start thinking about which topics you’ll get started with.\n\nBegin by thinking about your experiences, successes, failures or discoveries related to your niche. What insights can you share? What ideas are you looking to explore in-depth?\n\nAs you think of topics, try to get into your readers’ heads. Here are some questions to guide you through the brainstorming process:\n\nWhat characteristics does my target audience possess?\n\nWhat subjects does my target audience get excited about?\n\nWhat challenges does my target audience face?\n\nYou can also come up with ideas using the topic cluster model. Essentially, this is a tightly organized system that strings together related posts using a series of internal links. While this process is usually considered part of SEO, you can also think of it as a mind map for coming up with ideas.\n\nBy this model, think about a broad topic—say, recipes—and then divide that up into smaller subtopics, like dinner recipes or brunch recipes. Then, divide those up into even more specific topics, like 20-minute dinner recipes, mimosa recipes, and cake decoration ideas. Any of these topics could be its own blog post.\n\nIf you’re still stuck, this list of blog ideas can help jumpstart the brainstorming process. They include:\n\nA 30 before 30 list (also 40 before 40, or 50 before 50)\n\nYour sources of inspiration\n\nBeginners’ guides\n\nTime-saving hacks\n\nA challenge you’ve faced\n\nUse these ideas to guide you, but feel free to add your own creative twist based on your niche.\n\n07. Write your first blog post\n\nStart with keyword research\n\nCome up with a blog post title\n\nOutline your main points\n\nWrite engaging content\n\nInsert images\n\nOptimize for SEO\n\nEdit and publish\n\nNow that you’ve come up with ideas, you’re ready to dive into the writing. Let’s go over how to write a blog post from start to finish:\n\nStart with keyword research\n\nFinding the right keywords is crucial for getting people to read your posts. By targeting certain phrases with your article, you increase the chances of your blog appearing on search results pages for those queries.\n\nLet’s say, for instance, that you want to share a carrot cake recipe in your blog. You’ll want to target keywords such as:\n\nCarrot cake\n\nCarrot cake recipe\n\nBest carrot cake recipe\n\nHow to make carrot cake\n\nDepending on your topic, some keywords may be more obvious than others. You can refine your keywords using free keyword research tools such as Google Keyword Planner or you can use more robust paid options like SEMrush or Ahrefs.\n\nNext, you’ll need to strategically target your selected keywords throughout your article. This means two things: First, you’ll need to sprinkle those phrases throughout your post (but try to do so as organically as possible—no one likes unnatural keyword stuffing). Second, you should structure your article based on the format you see in the top 10 search results for those keywords (you can also reference these results when deciding how long should a blog post be).\n\nLet’s say, for example, that you want to write an article about your favorite carrot cake recipe. Start by checking your competitors—the top 10 search results on Google for the keyword “carrot cake recipe.”\n\nWhen you type that phrase into the search engine, you’ll notice that the top results are written as numbered steps, rather than as a story. You can therefore assume that most readers prefer the list format for these types of posts. In order to provide valuable content to your readers—and to rank high on Google as a result—you’ll want your own post to assume a similar format.\n\nLikewise, you’ll want to touch on all the main points covered by your competitors. This doesn’t mean you can’t be be creative. It’s just to say that in addition to sharing your own original insights, you should cover all the bases.\n\nTo continue with our example, let’s assume that when you look up “carrot cake recipe,” the top search results include a section about how to make cream cheese frosting. This is an indicator that many readers find this content helpful. In addition, it shows that Google has a preference for articles including that detail. You’d be wise, then, to touch on this idea in your own article.\n\nOutline your main points\n\nKeyword research gives you an idea of the best format for your blog post, as well as which sections to include. This naturally segues into the outline stage of the writing process.\n\nFirst, choose which type of blog post you’d like to write. Will it be a how-to guide? A product recommendation? An op-ed? Whichever blog post template you choose, you’ll want to have a clear idea in mind before structuring the outline.\n\nThen, use headers and subheaders to break up your content into organized, bite-sized chunks. Beneath each heading, make bulleted notes of the main points you’ll include in each section. This will be the skeleton of your first blog post.\n\nFeel free to use this downloadable blog post template to help with your outline. All you need to do is fill in the blanks:\n\nCome up with a blog post title\n\nThe next part of starting a blog article is coming up with a strong title. You can come up with your blog titles at any stage of the planning process, but the best ideas often arise as you build your outline.\n\nA blog title is a small but mighty piece of content. Often, it makes the difference between whether or not people click on your article.\n\nTo make your blog titles catchy and compelling, put yourself in your readers’ shoes. Think about what might interest and excite them, and try the following strategies:\n\nBe clear and direct\n\nPromise value\n\nAppeal to your readers’ emotions\n\nPique their curiosity\n\nUse humor, alliteration or wordplay\n\nHere are a few fill-in-the-blank blog title ideas to help you:\n\nHere’s more information on how to write a headline that stands out. If you’re curious about diving more into what makes a headline a success, Buzzsumo’s shared headlines study is also an insightful resource.\n\nLooking to make the most out of your blog?Subscribe to the Wix blog newsletter and get fresh content and updates straight to your inbox.\n\nWrite engaging content\n\nNow, it’s time to start typing away. Keep in mind that you’ll need an introduction, body text broken up by headers and sub-headers, and a conclusion (optional).\n\nIn the introduction, grab your audience’s attention with a captivating anecdote, a compelling quote or statistic, or an interesting fact. Then, share a brief summary of what the article is about, making sure to grab the interest of your readers.\n\nNext, write the body text, using your outline as a guide. This is where you share your knowledge and expertise as a blogger. Be sure to avoid fluff; writing for the sake of writing is one of the biggest blogging mistakes. Instead, make sure each sentence is meaningful, and dive straight into sharing your original insights and actionable tips. You should also use a tone of voice that resonates with your audience, whether it’s funny and casual or serious and formal.\n\nFinally, wrap up the post with a concluding section. While not every blog includes this final bit, it’s a nice way to tie your ideas together and share your closing thoughts.\n\nKeep in mind that writing a blog post can take several hours, and it’s a process that shouldn’t be rushed. Set aside at least half a day to write your first draft.\n\nThere are quicker ways to research, plan and create blog content, if you choose to decide with AI content generation tools. There are several to choose from - including Open AI's Chat GPT, Google's BARD and others such as Jasper.ai. Just be sure to heavily edit any AI generated content, be on top of fact checking it's output and don't forget to bring your own voice and style to the content.\n\nWrite a blog post with AI\n\nAs AI content generators become more popular and as their output improves, considering whether to use AI to write blog posts is a valid question a lot of bloggers are asking themselves. AI content generation can speed up the blog writing process and help you create more, faster. However, in our experience, AI generated content still requires a large degree of human editing, fact checking and injecting of experience into it. So while it might help you create drafts faster, it's not going to be something you can publish fresh from an AI content generator.\n\nHowever you can use AI for other parts of the blog writing process. You can use it to:\n\nCreate blog titles\n\nWrite meta titles and descriptions\n\nStructure your blog articles\n\nHelp you proofread for grammar and spelling mistakes\n\nInsert images\n\nAs you start your blog, remember that your choice of images can strengthen readers’ overall impression of your article. Whether you add photos, screenshots or illustrations to your articles, they should be functional as well as beautiful. Make sure they convey your main points and highlight important examples in the post.\n\nIf you don’t have your own images, begin by browsing free stock photos on the web. Pexels and Unsplash are both popular sites for gathering visual material. While you might eventually want to use photos you take yourself, stock photos are a quick way to get your blog started.\n\nOptimize for SEO\n\nOnce you create your content, there are a couple things you’ll need to take care of before hitting Publish. These steps primarily revolve around strategy, from improving your blog SEO to generating conversions through your article. Here’s a quick post-writing checklist to guide you:\n\nDouble check your keywords: Quickly search your content (CTRL+F) to review your use of keywords. Did you include all the keywords you intended to? If not, check to see whether there are any other opportunities to incorporate the keywords throughout your article. (Keep in mind that keyword stuffing is considered a bad practice, and search engines can penalize you for it. Incorporate them naturally into the text, rather than forcing them in.)\n\nAdd internal links: One trick up every bloggers’ sleeve is to link between their blog posts (also known as the practice of internal linking). This helps improve your posts’ SEO, and it also encourages your readers to browse your other articles. Rather than linking randomly, you should link between primarily related blog posts; this is better for SEO, and it also makes the links more valuable to your readers. If you’re just starting a blog and don’t have much content yet, don’t forget to go back into your posts and add in the links later.\n\nIncorporate CTAs: The next trick in the book is to include calls-to-action (CTAs) throughout the article. These little snippets of content often take the form of phrases such as Buy Now, Subscribe, or Read More. By placing call-to-action buttons in your article, you can direct readers to buy your products, subscribe to your newsletter, or click for further reading.\n\nUse alt text: Because Google can’t read photos, bloggers often add a short description to each image (ideally using keywords) to help the search engine understand what is being displayed. This description, called alt text, helps your images show up in Google image searches.\n\nWrite your post’s metadata: Metadata is the term for the text used to display a web page in Google search results. This includes the meta title (also known as the title tag) and meta description. Sometimes, the meta title is the same as the title of your blog post, while other times, you’ll want to choose a slightly different title for displaying your post. There’s no right or wrong here, so long as your title is engaging and includes your most important keyword. The meta description, which is the short snippet of text beneath the meta title, should also include your main keywords and should preview the article’s main points.\n\nChoose your URL: Every webpage has a dedicated URL, and your blog posts are no different. A strong URL helps your articles rank high on search engine results pages, and typically contains a keyword. Blog post URLs often take the form of www.yourdomainname.com/blog-post-keyword or www.yourdomainname.com/blog/blog-post-keyword.\n\nEdit and publish\n\nYou now have everything you need for your first blog post. Give it a couple reads, and share it with family members or friends to review. It’s always helpful to have a second, third, or fourth pair of eyes.\n\nWhen you think your article is ready to go, upload it to your blog. Your blogging platform will also have a place for you to type in the metadata and URL. Once that’s done, hit Publish and let the celebrations begin.\n\n08. Create an editorial calendar\n\nWhew! You’ve just written your first blog post. Take a break, and when you’re ready, plan out the rest of the month’s posting schedule.\n\nCreating an editorial calendar is an important part of starting a blog. It’s an effective way to ensure you publish content consistently, letting you hold yourself accountable as a writer and ensuring you don’t deviate from your blogging goals. Your readers want new content, and you need to deliver. Plus, search engines take into account how frequently you publish when determining your site’s overall ranking.\n\nYou probably already have a handful of topics from your brainstorming session in Step 6. If not, use the same process to come up with new ideas. Once you have at least 10 or so ideas, start building a content calendar.\n\nYour calendar doesn’t need to cost a thing, and it certainly doesn’t require the use of unfamiliar tools or platforms. Open up Excel or Google Sheets, and start building a schedule from there. The columns you use are completely up to you, but you’ll probably want to create different sections for the publishing date, blog title, main keywords, article status and comments.\n\nPro tip: If you know you’re prone to procrastination (aren't we all?), open up a Google Calendar and fill in your deadlines there. You can even set aside blocks of time in your calendar for writing.\n\nHow often should you blog?\n\nWhen learning how to start a blog, a big question people ask is how often they should be publishing new content. As a rule of thumb, the more often you blog, the more traffic you get. There’s no black-or-white answer for exactly how frequently that is, but studies have pointed us to a few important statistics:\n\n11 or more posts per month yields a noticeable increase in traffic. Among small companies of 10 or fewer employees, those who published at least 11 blog posts a month had twice as much traffic as those who published two to five blogs a month.\n\nSmall companies also found that publishing at least 11 posts per month yields twice as many leads as those publishing six to 10 monthly articles. This is important if your goal is to obtain subscribers, sell products or work as an affiliate (more on that in Step 10).\n\nHow often you blog also depends on your goals. If your main goal is to generate brand awareness, start with one to two new posts per week. On the other hand, if you’re primarily aiming to increase blog traffic, you should ideally be writing three to four new posts per week.\n\nKeep all this in mind as you create your editorial calendar, but make your goals small and achievable. If you set unrealistic deadlines that you can’t meet, you’ll get thrown off course and even discouraged.\n\nYou can always ramp up your efforts once you get used to publishing and make it a habit to stick to your schedule. In addition, remember that you can always bring in guest contributors to up the quantity of published content each week.\n\n09. Promote your blog\n\nShare on social media\n\nCreate a blog newsletter\n\nWrite for other sites\n\nReach out to an existing community\n\nParticipate in question and discussion sites\n\nInvest in paid ads\n\nTry new content formats\n\nAt this stage, you have everything you need to start a blog. These last couple of steps will focus on how to spread the word about your blog and grow it into a serious monetization tool.\n\nIn order to get readers, you’ll need to find creative ways to drive traffic to your site. While improving your SEO is an important step, the following methods can also help you promote your blog. Note that most of them are completely free, while a few (like advertising) are paid.\n\nShare on social media: Social media is an excellent place to post your content and draw attention to your blog. Whether you promote your blog on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or LinkedIn, it’s a great way to reach new readers. Learn more about blogging vs instagram in our guide.\n\nCreate a blog newsletter: Send out a weekly email newsletter to engage your readers and get them coming back to your blog for more. This will help you sustain a loyal fan base. To get subscribers to your blog email list in the first place, include a prominent Subscribe button in your website’s navigation bar, footer, and within your blog posts.\n\nWrite for other sites: Strengthen your reputation as a writer and expert in your niche by publishing content outside your own website. Consider opening a Medium account and making a name for yourself there, or post articles on LinkedIn. You should also keep an eye out for guest blogging opportunities, which are offered by publications such as Forbes and Entrepreneur.\n\nReach out to an existing community: Facebook groups, forums and LinkedIn groups are gathering places for people interested in a particular topic. If you find an online community that’s relevant to your blog niche, share your website with them and network among their group members.\n\nParticipate in question and discussion sites: Sites such as Quora and Reddit give you the opportunity to highlight your blog in discussion threads. Use one of your blog posts to answer a question or follow up on a comment, but be sure to come across as helpful and informative rather than promotional.\n\nInvest in paid ads: In addition to sharing posts on social media, you can boost your posts with a paid promotion so that they reach more people. Likewise, you can pay for Google ads and reach new users through the search engine.\n\nTry new content formats: Expand your reach even further by trying new content formats. These essentially repurpose the same information provided in your posts. For instance, you can turn your blog posts into videos and start a YouTube channel. You might even create a podcast or offer a webinar. The sky's the limit.\n\nLearn more: Blogging vs Youtube\n\n10. Make money blogging\n\nAffiliate marketing\n\nAdvertise within your blog\n\nOffer paid subscriptions\n\nWrite sponsored content\n\nSell e-books and merchandise\n\nProvide consulting services\n\nIf you’re looking to start a blog with a large readership, chances are you’re also aiming to make money from your blog’s popularity. We touched on affiliate marketing earlier in the article, but let’s talk more about this and other money-making strategies that can help you generate passive income from your writing efforts.\n\nThere are more ways than one to make money blogging. Here’s a quick overview of each method:\n\nAffiliate marketing: This is one of the most common ways to make money blogging, and it’s easy to get started. Intermediate affiliates can earn between $300 to $3,000 per day, and that number only goes up with experience. There are plenty of affiliate marketing programs out there, but Amazon Associates is a popular choice for beginners.\n\nAdvertising within your blog: Another option is to display ads within your blog, which means you’re essentially selling your blog real estate as ad space. This is a fairly reliable way to make money, as you’ll be earning revenue with each click. If you’re thinking of taking this route, Google AdSense is by far one of the most lucrative and popular programs.\n\nOffering paid subscriptions: You know how the New York Times makes you pay to read their content? You can do the same thing with your blog. While some of your articles should be free, you can also create exclusive content that readers can buy access to through a subscription plan.\n\nWrite sponsored content: Reach out to companies—or, as you blog grows, make it easy for brands to contact you—regarding sponsorship opportunities. You’ll be writing articles that promote those companies’ products, and the business, in turn, will compensate you for the posts.\n\nSell e-books and merchandise: You can also sell digital or physical goods directly from your site. This might include branded merchandise, products related to your field, or e-books and other online resources. One way to do this is by adding a Pay button to your homepage that your readers can click to browse your merchandise.\n\nProvide consulting services: This approach involves making use of your professional experience and harnessing the knowledge you’ve gained as a professional blogger. Based on your insights and expertise, think about the kinds of consulting services you might be able to offer to your clients. If you’re writing a nutrition blog, one such idea could be making customized diet plans or working as a nutrition coach for clients.\n\nFor further details, take a look at this article on how to monetize a blog or check out the Wix Learn online course on monetizing your blog.\n\n5 reasons to start a blog and is it worth it\n\nPeople start blogs for a variety of reasons, many of which mean blogging is still worth it, some of these reasons include:\n\n01. Share your ideas with the world\n\nSometimes you just want to be heard and get your ideas out into the universe. This is where a blog can help—it’s a form of communication and space that’s entirely your own. You can use your creativity and passion to create a space customized exactly to your liking where you can share your ideas, expertise and experiences.\n\n02. Promote a product or service\n\nBlogging for business is a great way to engage potential customers and provide more information about a product or service. Additionally, blogging does wonders for a website's SEO.\n\n03. Build your brand\n\nA blog provides a platform to showcase your knowledge and skills, establishing yourself as an authority in your field and building credibility and trust with your audience. As Ophyr Hanan, Blog Growth and SEO Outreach Specialist at Wix, says, \"By fostering relationships and collaborating on content, it can help build the foundation for thought leadership and authority building both for you and within your industry.\"\n\n04. Earn income\n\nBlogging can be profitable with time and continued effort. The best way to see the monetary fruits of your labor is by posting quality content regularly that draws in new readers and brings more traffic to your website. This will help your blog gain advertisers and can also boost your status as an online influencer, which can open up the door for affiliate marketing.\n\n05. Build a community\n\nThanks to the internet, we no longer need to live in the same city, state or even country to feel connected to others. A blog, as part of a wider blogosphere community, creates a space to share your story, ideas and start conversations with people all over the world with mutual interests. A blog typically has a comments section where your readers can speak with you directly, allowing you to engage in conversation and build relationships.\n\nIs it too late to start a blog?\n\nBlogging is crucial to build your brand's voice and community, and allows you to expand your reach to a relevant audience who might otherwise not know you exist.\n\nJudit Ruiz Ricart, Team Lead of Blog Growth at Wix\n\nBlogs are still a popular and effective way to share your thoughts, ideas and expertise with the world. In fact, blogging is one of the most popular forms of content marketing. It can also be a great way to build a community and connect with other people who share your interests.\n\nRemember that the internet is still growing, with more and more people using it every day. This means that there's a large and growing potential audience for your blog, too. While there are many blogs out there, there's always room for new voices and perspectives. If you have something unique to share, people will be interested in reading it. And the best part is that there are many tools and platforms that make it easy to create and manage a blog.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why blogging is still relevant, including:\n\nSearch engines love blogs\n\nBlogs are a great way to improve your website's SEO and rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This is because blogs provide fresh, high-quality content that is relevant to your target audience.\n\nBlogs build authority\n\nWhen you write informative and engaging blog posts, you establish yourself as an expert in your field. This can help you attract new customers and clients, and build trust with your existing audience.\n\nBlogs build connections\n\nBlogs provide a platform for you to share your thoughts and ideas and to connect with other people who share your interests. This can help you build a community around your brand. This is especially true of service industries, fitness blogs for example are a great way to build a loyal health focused audience and the same is true for almost every industry.\n\nBlogs generate leads and sales\n\nWhen you write blog posts that are relevant to your target audience, you can include calls to action that encourage them to learn more about your products or services, or to contact you for a consultation.\n\nThe blogging landscape has changed in recent years, the space is more competitive as more blogs exist and competition for audience numbers grows. Hand in hand with this social media and video have become more popular ways to consume content, especially amongst younger audiences. However amongst all of this blogs still play an important role in the content marketing mix.\n\nBlogging resources - how to become a blogger\n\nAs you learn how to create a blog and become a blogger, browse these blogging resources to help guide you through the writing process, SEO and more:\n\nBlog post checklist: Check off these steps to ensure you’ve covered all the bases with your first blog post.\n\nBlogging for beginners: Read through these additional tips on how to start your blog from scratch.\n\nFree online writing courses (Udemy): Browse Udemy for professional writing courses that will help you develop your blogging skills.\n\nFree SEO tutorial (Moz): Learn the basics of SEO with this free six-part video course.\n\nBlogging tools\n\nFinally, online tools are a big part of launching a blog, since they make the process more streamlined and efficient.
