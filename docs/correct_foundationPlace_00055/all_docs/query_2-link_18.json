When you purchase hosting using my Bluehost affiliate link, they compensate me, which helps make this step-by-step guide to start a blog and make money blogging free of charge to you. Know that I only recommend products and services I’ve personally used and stand behind.\n\nFollow These 6 Steps to Learn How to Start a Blog and Make Money as a Blogger Today:\n\nIf you’re ready to take the leap and learn how to start a blog that can grow into a source of real online income, then let’s dive in.\n\n1. Pick Your Blog Name and Niche\n\nFirst, it’s time to pick a name and niche for your new blog.\n\nYour blog’s name is what readers will see first (like yourblog.com), so it should ideally represent either the general topics you’ll be writing about—or it could be your own name, that of your business, a clever combination of words, or otherwise.\n\nYour blog’s niche is the general topic area that you’ll be focusing your content around. Examples include blog topics like travel, food, fashion, lifestyle, technology, and otherwise. Incorporating a word or two that clearly signals what your content is about, within the name of your blog (like fashionbyjane.com or hikewithryan.com)—will be very helpful for your future blog readers.\n\n2. Get Your Blog Online (Web Hosting)\n\nThe second step in starting a blog, is actually getting your blog online. That’s what a web hosting company will do for you. In this step, you’ll be selecting the blogging platform and web hosting plan you’ll use to get your blog online.\n\nThe combination of blogging platform & web hosting I personally use (and that most other bloggers use) is a WordPress blog, hosted by Bluehost. WordPress is a free publishing platform that’s been around since 2003 and now powers more than 60% of all blogs on the Internet. Bluehost is one of the most established, reliable companies in the blog hosting industry. This combination is what we’ll be using to start your blog. Now, let’s get your hosting set up.\n\n—> Click here to head over to Bluehost and hit the green “Get Started Now” button\n\nChoose Your Web Hosting Plan\n\nFirst, you’ll select a hosting plan (inputting your blog name comes next). Personally, I recommend choosing the Choice Plus plan because it comes with Domain Privacy, which will protect your personal information (your full name, email address, phone number and home address) from being published anywhere online.\n\nChoosing your plan will look like this right here. Just click the green “Select” button on your plan of choice:\n\nAs I said above, I recommend choosing the Choice Plus plan, so that you’re getting the Domain Privacy feature that’ll protect your personal information online, but any of these plans will do as you’re starting your blog—and you can add the domain privacy in later during the checkout process for around $1/mo.\n\nPick Your Blog’s Domain Name\n\nNext, you’ll get to the page where it’s time to choose your blog’s domain name:\n\nOnce you get to this step in the checkout process, just type in the name of the domain name that you’d like your blog to have (mine is ryrob.com).\n\nIf you want to run a quick search to see if your domain name is available, you can do it quickly right here using my free domain name generator:\n\nIf your domain name of choice isn’t available, you can either try another option that comes to mind—or (what I recommend) select the option to choose your domain name later after getting the rest of your account squared away and taking a little more time to think the name through. Plus, later on down in this guide, I expand some more on how to choose the right name for your blog if you’re not decided yet.\n\nHere’s where you can click to choose your domain later, just below the options to select a domain name now or import a domain you already own:\n\nAfter either choosing your domain name or opting to select it later, you’ll be taken to the final step in the sign up process—creating your account.\n\nCreate Your Bluehost Account\n\nStart by filling in your account details like your name, email address (it’s super important to use an up-to-date email address because this is where your login details and account information will be sent) and address. If you don’t want to enter your information manually, you can connect your Bluehost account with your Google account if that option is available for your location in the world. Either works!\n\nSelect the Right Hosting Plan Package\n\nThis is where you’ll choose an account plan based on the price you want to lock in and how far in advance you’ll pay for your blog’s hosting.\n\nNote that Bluehost only offers options for you to pay 1, 2 or 3 years upfront. They don’t offer a monthly payment option (because most hosting companies that do offer monthly payments tend to charge a bit more). Even still, with whichever plan you choose, the price works out to be a great deal for starting your own blog and getting it online today.\n\nWhich Web Hosting Plan & Pricing is Best to Start a Blog with?\n\nPersonally, I recommend choosing the “36 Month Price” if you want to lock in the lowest possible price for your new hosting plan. That’s what I use. And it secures your blog hosting at their lowest rate (and gets you domain privacy) for the next 3 years. And because this low pricing for new customers only applies to the first payment you make, if you were to choose the 1-year plan, your pricing may go up after that first year.\n\nThat’s why if you choose the 36-month plan, your pricing will be locked in at this rate for 3 years. For that reason, I recommend going with the longest duration plan that your budget can spring for.\n\nSelect the Right Blog Hosting Plan Package Extras (Uncheck All)\n\nI recommend unchecking & skipping all of these package extra. Later on in this guide, I’ll show you the many free and cheap plugins & tools you can use for things like SSL certificates (free), SEO optimization (free), additional security and site back-ups, rendering most of the package extras unnecessary for the majority of new bloggers.\n\nThankfully, Bluehost now builds in domain privacy for free with their Choice Plus Plan, which keeps all of your personal contact information (your name, email, phone number and address) private. So, if you chose the Choice Plus Plan on the previous screen, then your Domain Privacy Protection will be listed as free—it’s included in that plan.\n\nIf you chose a Basic or Plus Plan, then you’ll want to check the box to add Domain Privacy Protection to your order, otherwise you’re likely to get a good amount of spam mail & confusing solicitations over the coming years.\n\nThe total you’ll now see is the amount you’re going to pay today. Remember though, you won’t have to pay again for 1, 2 or 3 years depending on the package you chose. Plus, there’s a 30-day money-back guarantee in case things don’t go as planned with your blog.\n\nEnter Your Billing Information\n\nNow you’ll input your billing information, check the box that you agree to Bluehost’s Terms of Service and then hit the blue “Submit” button.\n\nWoo! It’s time for a mini celebration 🙂\n\nYou’ve officially completed the first major step in starting a blog.\n\nWith the initial signup process complete, it’s time to move into the next stage of getting your blog fully setup and optimized.\n\nOn the next page, you’ll be guided step-by-step through the process of getting WordPress installed on your blog through Bluehost—and later on in this guide, I’ve got a ton of helpful tips for optimizing your blog, free and cheap plugins you can install to help get your blog looking great, and more.\n\n—> Click here to head over to Bluehost and register your domain if you haven’t already.\n\nNow, if you haven’t yet set up your web hosting and want to check out some other options—there are other web hosting providers worth considering.\n\nThe 2 Best Alternative Blog Hosting Platforms Worth Considering\n\nDreamhost — I’ve hosted literally dozens of websites on Dreamhost over the years (and I still do). All similar features like 1-click WordPress install, free SSL certificate and site security aside, one of the biggest pros of going with Dreamhost compared to other hosting companies, is that they offer a true plan you can pay month-to-month that allows you to pay for the cost of your blog hosting each month with no strings attached. Here are a few other web hosting companies that also offer monthly payment plans and have 30-day money-back guarantees.\n\nHostGator — The thing that sets HostGator apart from other hosting companies, is their fantastic level of customer support and the fact that they also offer a true monthly payment plan (which helps if you’re starting your blog on a budget). HostGator ranks amongst the largest hosting companies, now powering over 8 million+ websites around the world, making them a great partner to scale your blog with over time.\n\nIf you still want to evaluate more of the top blog hosting providers, then head on over to my breakdown of the best web hosting plans for bloggers to review this year. And if you’ve already gotten your hosting taken care of with Bluehost, here’s where you can login to your hosting account with them.\n\nNow we’re at the point in this guide where everything from here on out will be built upon the assumption that you’ve already registered your domain name and chosen the right hosting plan—so if you haven’t done so already, take just a few minutes to quickly get that set up.\n\nReady to Register Your Domain Name and Set up Blog Hosting?\n\nI made this in-depth video tutorial to walk you step-by-step through the entire process from choosing your web host all the way through to launching your blog and publishing your first blog post in the next 10 to 15 minutes:\n\nDisclosure: Please note that when you purchase hosting using my Bluehost affiliate link, they compensate me, which helps me make this ultimate guide to starting a blog free of charge to you. Know that I also use Bluehost hosting, and I would never recommend a product, tool or service I don’t personally use & advocate for 🙂\n\nI know first-hand that starting a blog on WordPress (and learning how to use WordPress) can be a daunting process.\n\nSo, if you need a little more detailed guidance, I put together a free master course that spreads all of this work out into a series of action-packed lessons, and goes into even more granular detail than this tutorial.\n\nWhile the first crucial step to getting your blog started today is registering your domain name and setting up hosting, my free course expands into actually growing your blog. Throughout this 7-day course, you’ll go from zero to publishing (and promoting) your first blog post. I can’t recommend it enough.\n\nWant my Free Course: How to Start a Profitable Blog in 7 Days?\n\nEnter your name and email address and you’ll get instant access to my course that’s been featured on Forbes, Business Insider and Entrepreneur.\n\n3. Design Your Blog with a Free WordPress Theme\n\nNow that we’ve gotten through the crucial setup phase of starting a blog, it’s time to have a little more fun.\n\nDesigning your WordPress blog is when you might start to feel a little friction with this process though (if you’ve never worked on a blog before), but I promise this won’t get too technical. For a much more in-depth, step-by-step process, check out my WordPress tutorial for beginners.\n\nPlus… the last thing I want is for the very minor technical side of starting a blog to derail your progress today. That’s why, in my free course How to Build a Blog in 7 Days, I break this technical setup process down into an even more actionable, step-by-step checklist for you.\n\nIf you want to start a blog and make money as a blogger, WordPress is the best blogging platform\n\nLet’s cover some basic terminology, so you understand why WordPress is the right platform (also known as a Content Management System or CMS) to run your blog on.\n\nSince I first started blogging over a decade ago, I’ve been running my blog on WordPress and I couldn’t be happier with the amount of flexibility, control and long-term growth potential that decision has afforded me. And while it’s been a fun journey, don’t be mistaken—blogging is hard work.\n\nNow, one thing you need to be careful of, is that WordPress comes in two very different platforms. There’s WordPress.com and WordPress.org. They have almost the same name, but there are very big differences between the two:\n\nWordPress.com:\n\nIs free to use (with heavy restrictions)\n\nDoesn’t let you pick a custom domain name (i.e. 👉 yoursite.wordpress.com)\n\nHas very limited monetization options (you can’t sell your own ads)\n\nDoesn’t let you upload plugins (for email capture and other things)\n\nHas limited blogging theme support so you’re stuck with very basic designs\n\nYou have to pay to remove WordPress branding and get your own domain like yoursite.com\n\nLimited SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and analytics\n\nWordPress.org:\n\nFully customizable design (using WordPress themes), unlimited plugin options, and no branding\n\nYour own custom domain name for your blog to run on (like ryrob.com)\n\nTotal control over your own monetization efforts\n\nPowerful SEO features with great plugins (so people can find your site easier)\n\nLet’s you start or add an eCommerce store or membership site\n\nSmall monthly fee (from the cheap hosting plan you use to get your blog online)\n\nA free domain name during sign up (with most blog hosting platforms)\n\nWhile the choice is yours, if you want to take full advantage of your blog, be able to have it grow with you and eventually make money as a blogger, WordPress.org is the way to go (and the exact process we’ve followed throughout this guide). It’s the CMS of choice that’ll sit in the background and power your blog.\n\nHow to Install WordPress (and Configure Your Blog Settings)\n\nHere’s a step-by-step video walkthrough of how to install WordPress on your new blog, start building your blog pages and configure the right settings:\n\nNaturally in this one video, we don’t cover everything about WordPress, but remember that these are the basics you need to accomplish first.\n\nSpend time familiarizing yourself with the admin area of your WordPress blog. You’ll develop a much deeper understanding of how WordPress works and which things you can quickly change about your site’s visual appearance and functionality over time.\n\nChoose the Best Free WordPress Theme for Your New Blog (3 Top Options)\n\nWhen you’re still new to starting a blog, I don’t usually recommend buying a paid WordPress theme right away. Once you have some traffic and can justify the investment, then it’s smart to choose a premium theme with more features and options. For right now though, a complex blog theme will be a distraction from your most important priority of bringing readers to your new blog.\n\nWordPress comes with a ton of free blogging themes to choose from, so start with one of the options you like in Appearance > Themes > Add New Theme > Popular without spending much time on this for now. You can always come back and change it later.\n\nI recommend choosing Kadence WP, Elementor for WordPress or Astra (all of which are 100% free blog themes—they’re lightning fast and also have the ability to upgrade to their premium theme versions at affordable price points later on).\n\nI like these three fast WordPress themes most because they’re crisp, clean, simple and will get you set up without needing to invest in a paid blog theme as you’re just starting your blog. Later, you can evaluate more of the other WordPress themes out there or upgrade these ones to their premium themes for more features.\n\nWhy Blog Design is so Important When Starting a Blog\n\nEven if you don’t really care about design yourself, your readers will shift their behavior dramatically based on the features of your blog layout. In fact, during a 2012 study from Google and the University of Basel, researchers found that users judge a website’s aesthetic beauty and perceived functionality in 1/20th — 1/50th of a second. Plus, thanks to a little psychological bias called the Halo Effect, people will extend that judgement to all aspects of your blog.\n\nGood blog design builds trust. It tells people that you care enough about your blog to make it look nice. This doesn’t mean you need crazy animations or tons of fonts and colors. In fact, the best designs are simple, clear and easy to read.\n\nOnce you’ve settled on the right theme for your WordPress blog, it’s time to dive into the world of WordPress plugins, to help unlock even more customizations of your blog design & functionality. This is the necessary prep work in order to give your blog a chance of developing into a real business over time.\n\n10 Essential WordPress Plugins You Should Install on Your New Blog Today\n\nWordPress plugins play a crucial role in how your blog will function, and getting the most essential plugins dialed in as quickly as possible is a major step that’s designed to serve both your audience and perform well for search engines.\n\nThe only problem with WordPress plugins, is that there are literally thousands of different plugins and blogging tools to choose from out there. To help you cut through all the noise though… these are the must-have WordPress plugins to install when you start blogging today:\n\nYoast SEO: The more people that can find your content, the better your blog will do. The Yoast SEO plugin for WordPress helps you to optimize your blog post titles, meta titles, meta descriptions, content length and other elements across your entire blog so that you can be found easier by search engines. This is by far the most established, best SEO plugin on the market, and worth installing on your blog first. Be sure to use my free meta title generator & meta description generator tools, too.\n\nWPForms: You’ll want your readers to be able to get in touch with you easily, which I highly recommend—as it’ll encourage other bloggers who want to collaborate with you an easy opportunity to reach out. WPForms is an easy-to-use plugin that allow you to drag & drop contact forms onto any page of your blog.\n\nSite Kit by Google (Analytics Dashboard for WordPress): This is a 100% free plugin made by Google that allows you to see all of your relevant Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, Google AdSense and Google PageSpeed optimization data directly inside your WordPress dashboard. Connect the plugin to your Google Analytics 4 & Search Console accounts (you can sign up for a free Google Analytics account right here and you’ll automatically set up a GA4 account) to find out who’s coming to your site, how long they’re sticking around, and what your most popular blog posts are.\n\nUpdraftPlus: Again, sometimes things will go wrong on your blog (and it won’t always be totally in your control). It’s always smart to have a backup plugin that’ll save all your hard work on a regular basis, and this free one stands high above the rest.\n\nWP Rocket: Faster websites rank higher on Google and give your readers a better experience. WP Rocket is a plugin that caches your blog pages, reduces your file sizes, and does much more to ensure that your blog loads faster for everyone.\n\nBunny CDN: Speaking of speed, Bunny.net makes a fantastic WordPress plugin-based CDN that’ll make images and other static elements of your blog load at lightning speed, earning this plugin top marks to consider as a complement to also using WP Rocket.\n\nInsert Headers and Footers: Sometimes to edit your blog theme, you’ll have to add code snippets to your header or footer (it’s not as scary as it sounds). However, doing it in the code of your theme can cause issues. This plugin lets you add small snippets of code easily to select locations around your blog.\n\nLightweight Accordion: If you like the way I create the collapsible (accordion-style) content boxes here throughout this guide and in the FAQ section near the bottom of this post, then I recommend installing the free plugin I use to make those content widgets come to life: Lightweight Accordion. In just a few clicks with this plugin, you can quickly add collapsible FAQ box functionality to your WordPress blog.\n\nMightyShare: Automatically generate social share images in WordPress for free. Rather than having whichever boring social share image your blog uses by default, this free plugin automatically generates beautiful social images using multiple templates, fonts, color choices and robust customization. It includes support for all post types, multiple templates and new templates added monthly.\n\nAntispam Bee: Antispam Bee is one the best free anti-spam WordPress plugin around, with a sophisticated toolset for effective day to day comment and trackback spam-fighting. Built with data protection and privacy in mind, you’ll be able to stop spam comments on your blog (for free) with this plugin.\n\nHow to Install a WordPress Plugin (Quickly) on Your New Blog\n\nThe fastest way to install a WordPress plugin is to find it within the plugin directory once you’re logged into your blog. To do that, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Navigate to Plugins > Add New:\n\n2. Search for the WordPress Plugin You Want to Install:\n\nIn this example, I’ve searched for the Yoast SEO WordPress plugin (which is an essential search engine optimization plugin you’ll want). If it weren’t already installed on my blog, you’d see the big “Install Now” button where it currently says “Active” here:\n\n3. Click Install Now on Your Plugin of Choice:\n\nOnce you’re ready to install the plugin you’ve searched for (or browsed the top charts to see what’s popular) on your WordPress site, click the “Install Now” button and it’ll be added to your blog. The last step will be clicking “Activate” on the plugin once it’s successfully installed.\n\nBasic WordPress Blogging Platform Settings to Become Familiar with Now\n\nThere are many different reasons to start a blog and just as many unique blogging goals you may have in mind. Regardless, it pays to have a basic understanding of the broader aspects of how WordPress functions, so that you can control the visual appearance of your blog.\n\nLet’s dig into a few of the bigger picture settings that you can find in your WordPress dashboard.\n\nAlright, we’ve covered the basic foundations of getting your blog’s WordPress settings dialed in. Now, let’s dig into creating a few of the main pages on your blog.\n\nCreate the Main Pages of Your Blog: About, Contact, Hire (on the WordPress Blogging Platform)\n\nFrom the moment you start a blog, you’ll want to showcase some basic information about yourself. Who you are. Why people should listen to you. How they can get in touch with you if they have questions or want to work with you.\n\nThese pages are all pretty standard, but they’re also a great way to have some fun and let your readers get to know you. In fact, I use my own About page to not only introduce who I am and tell my story, but also to explain my value proposition (for potential clients looking to hire me as a freelance content marketer) and show recent achievements.\n\nHere are step-by-step instructions for how to write an About Me page that does this on your blog, too:\n\nHow to Write an About Page for Your Blog\n\nYou might not think much about it, but your About page can quickly become one of the most popular pages on your blog.\n\nUse your About page to show the value you’re creating for your readers—and work hard to earn that attention.\n\nHow to Write a Contact Page for Your Blog\n\nAnother often overlooked page that you’ll want to include early on when you start a blog, is a simple way for people to contact you.\n\nWhile mine goes into more depth, your Contact page can be as simple as having your email and social media accounts listed on a page.\n\nThink about what types of content you want to share with your readers & the communication you want in return—then use your Contact page to set those expectations right away.\n\nNew to Starting a Blog with WordPress? 10 WordPress Blogging Platform Technical Tutorials\n\nIf you’re starting a blog on WordPress and want to spend a little more time tuning things up & experimenting with all of your settings, then check out these quick WordPress tutorials:\n\nHow to Change Font Size on Your Blog\n\nHow to Change Font Color on Your Blog\n\nHow to Make a Clickable Link\n\nWhat is a 301 Redirect?\n\nWhat is an RSS Feed?\n\nHow to Add Images in WordPress\n\nHow to Create a WordPress Table of Contents\n\nHow to HTML Highlight Text in WordPress\n\n12 Blog Layout Examples (and Best Practices)\n\n20+ Blog Examples (Case Studies of Successful Blogs)\n\nWant my Free Course: How to Start a Profitable Blog in 7 Days?\n\nEnter your name and email address and you’ll get instant access to my course that’s been featured on Forbes, Business Insider and Entrepreneur.\n\n4. Write Your First Blog Post\n\nYou don’t read a blog because it looks nice or because they publish frequently. (Although those both help).\n\nYou read a blog because you care about what it says. Creating high quality content is what will bring you readers and help you to eventually make money blogging.\n\nBefore you get too far down the road of creating a blog business plan, laying out your content roadmap and writing your first blog post—you need to answer one simple question… Why?\n\nWhy do you care for the topic you’re blogging about?\n\nWhy should other people listen to what you’re saying?\n\nWhy is this a blogging topic you can add real value to?\n\nTo answer these questions, I like to think of a blog like any other business and re-emphasize the importance of picking a clear niche. If you need some inspiration, check out my extensive list of niches (profitable niches) to blog about today.\n\nNow, if you’re unsure, or if no niche comes to mind right away, that’s OK. We can coax it out with a few questions, and you can check out my list of profitable blog niches to gather some inspiration for yourself.\n\nAsk these questions to determine a smart niche to start a blog in:\n\nWhat’s an interest or dream from your childhood that you find exciting?\n\nWhat’s the absolute best part of your day?\n\nDo you have any hobbies or hobbies that you want to learn?\n\nWhat is a deeply held value of yours?\n\nWhat’s one achievement that you’re incredibly proud of?\n\nRight away, you should have an idea or two for a clear niche you could start blogging about. It’s ok if your niche grows, evolves and changes over time.\n\nHow to Know if There’s a Business Opportunity for Your Blog Niche (to Eventually Make Money Blogging)\n\nIf you want to make money from your blog, you’ll also want to do a bit of research to see if there is a market demand for your niche. What this means is: Are people actively searching for what you’re writing about? And can you add value and help them in a way that makes you money?\n\nIn order to create a business from your blog, you need to solve a real problem for people. To do this, I use a simple spreadsheet I call the Niche Market Demand Checker (you can get a free copy of it in my course right here), which will help make sure you create content that your target audience will find useful.\n\nTake the blog niche that you’re thinking about and come up with 5–10 keyword phrases or blog topics within that niche that you would write about. This is also known as a keyword cluster. So, if we wanted to start a blog about playing guitar you might choose keywords like “best guitar books,” “how to play guitar,” “beginner guitar chords,” “what guitar should I buy,” and so on.\n\nKeep in mind too, that some of the new AI writing tools on the market these days can provide a lot of help in the ideation, research & writing process for your new blog. We built RightBlogger to be the all-in-one AI content creation platform for bloggers and I also have a free AI article writer & free paragraph rewriter tool you can try out here on my blog—in addition to more free AI tools coming soon.\n\nNow, let’s do a little keyword research. Enter one of those keywords from above into your Google search. If there are tens of millions (or more) results, that’s a pretty strong indicator that people care about this specific topic. But to be extra sure, I use my very own free keyword research tool to check the Monthly Search Volume (how many people are searching for this term each month).\n\nUse My Free Keyword Research Tool\n\nTry my free AI-Powered Keyword Tool to get dozens of research-backed ideas for keywords & topics to write about on your blog today.\n\nDo this for each of your keywords and look at the results. If all of your top keywords have a Monthly Search Volume of 5,000 – 10,000, you’ve definitely got a potentially profitable niche.\n\n👋 Just be sure you understand that keyword tools are only directionally reliable, and not to be taken as exact expectations of how much traffic you’ll get if you rank in the top Google search position for each term you’re investigating. Keyword tools are very useful for estimating demand, validating that a topic has a real audience, and prioritizing the order in which you pursue your content.\n\nIf you’re too much over that, into the high hundreds of thousands of Monthly Searches, you might want to get more specific with your niche rather than competing with much larger, established websites on more popular subjects. Your goal will eventually be to learn how to rank higher on Google than all these competitors.\n\nBrainstorm Smart Blog Post Ideas (Using Keyword Research & AI)\n\nEven once you’ve established the niche you’ll be blogging about, you have to do smart keyword research in order to generate the right blog post ideas that’ll actually bring you readers. That’s where free AI tools like my blog idea generator come into play.\n\nSo, what about the actual posts you’re going to write? The good news is you can honestly write whatever you want! This is your blog after all, and one of the major benefits is that it’s your platform to speak and share. But, ideas don’t always come naturally.\n\nThis is where I believe a simple editorial calendar is so important. It’s just a basic document to fill out that’ll give you a roadmap to always knowing what you’re writing next. It frees you up to spend more time on the fun of actually putting posts together—not banging your head against the wall trying to come up with blog post ideas. Check out my list of creative blog writing prompts to find more inspiration.\n\nHow to Come up with Clever Blog Post Ideas (+ My AI Blog Idea Generator)\n\nFirst, I recommend using the “Ideas” tab of my AI powered free keyword research tool, which also generates dozens of related blog post ideas:\n\nIf my free Artificial Intelligence-powered blog idea generator tool doesn’t come back with some clever ideas you like, here’s a simple process I use for coming up with the specific blog posts I write for my own blog.\n\nIf I’m still left needing more ideas, I’ll turn to a few more creative tactics…\n\nSeeing what other bloggers in my niche covered (and what did well).\n\nTaking a look at my most successful posts to see what readers like most.\n\nDoing more quote roundup posts (like my posts about business advice and online business tools) that don’t require a ton of original thought and effort from my end.\n\nChatting with bloggers in my space and brainstorming fresh ideas.\n\nTalking about specific blogging lessons I’ve recently learned (and my advice).\n\nReflecting on the blogging mistakes I’ve made and the tactics that work today.\n\nBy this point, I’ve usually got a fully stocked content calendar. Still need some more content inspiration? Here are 205+ winning blog post ideas.\n\nNow You’re Ready to Write Your First Blog Post\n\nOnce you’ve decided on the first blog post you want to write, you’ll navigate to the “Add New Post” section from your WordPress Dashboard. Now’s also the time to consider whether you want to use AI-powered content creation tools, like my free AI article writer or my full platform RightBlogger, to help make your writing process faster.\n\nGo to Posts > Add New which will look like this right here:\n\nNext, you’ll be taken to a brand new article page that’ll look like this (a totally blank canvas 🙂):\n\nIf you’re interested in AI to assist in your writing process, it’s worth considering ChatGPT too. You can snag all of my best ChatGPT prompts for bloggers that’ll get you started on the right track.\n\nWrite a Blog Post Headline that Encourages Readers to Click Through\n\nOne of the reasons you’re blogging is to attract readers, right? Well, it pays dividends to put some effort into learning how to write a headline that’ll entice readers and most importantly—deliver on the promise of what your article is actually helping readers to accomplish.\n\nLuckily for you, I built a free blog title generator tool that’ll give you an unlimited number of blog title ideas for the topics you want to cover. I also have a free headline analyzer tool you can use to score your existing headlines & get actionable suggestions on how to improve them.\n\nTry my free AI-Powered Blog Title Generator Tool to get dozens of SEO-friendly headline ideas to make your blog posts stand out today.\n\nSo let’s say you’ve determined that your hiking blog (like Hike with Ryan) should start by breaking down some underrated hikes in Yosemite, compiling a list of the best hiking boots on the market, rounding up gifts for hikers in your life and talking about when to visit Yosemite during the year. Next, click into the “Add title” bar on your new post page and type in a title like…\n\nAs a starting point to writing a strong title, learn by observing the headlines of other successful bloggers in your niche:\n\nDo they often lead with numbers?\n\nHow many of their article headlines include parentheses?\n\nDoes it seem like a best practice to capitalize the first letter of every word?\n\nCheck out a few of the most recent headlines from my blog so you can get some inspiration on how you might want to structure your headlines from the day you learn how to start a blog and begin publishing (be sure to read my ultimate guide to writing blog headlines and my quick tips to killer blog titles).\n\nIf you’re still unsure about how to title a new post, then do a Google search for the target keyword phrase you’re going after and gather inspiration for the ways other titles are written—be sure not to directly copy other bloggers, but that’ll point you in the right direction.\n\nHow to Choose an SEO-Friendly Blog Post URL\n\nIt’s extremely important that you customize the URL (blog link) of your new post, if you hope for it to rank well in organic Google search results. Continuing with our example from above, I’m trying to rank the article “15 Scenic Hikes You’ve Never Heard of in the San Francisco Bay Area” for keyword phrases like “hikes near San Francisco,” so that’s exactly what I’ve chosen as my post URL… /hikes-near-san-francisco\n\nHere are a few more URL writing pointers:\n\nRemember to separate each word in a new post URL with a dash (for easier readability)\n\nKeep it short at no more than 3 – 5 words in length (less is better)\n\nAvoid the use of numbers unless there’s a very compelling reason otherwise\n\nAlways, always, always include your target keyword phrase\n\nCraft a Compelling Introduction to Your New Blog Post\n\nYou have one or two sentences to convince readers your new post is worth their time. AI writing tools like RightBlogger can help a lot at this stage. Here’s a sample blog post introduction I just wrote in less than two minutes for our hiking example:\n\nAs you’re learning to write a blog post that keeps readers engaged, here are a few do’s and don’ts for crafting a strong introduction (and my free blog post templates you can follow along with and use in your own content creation process).\n\nThe easiest strategy for writing a compelling introduction is to answer the who, what, where, when and why as soon as possible. This may sound counterintuitive, but another trick is to start with your conclusion first. In the age of short attention spans, people have grown tired of wasting time on clickbait blog posts that go nowhere.\n\nThe quicker you can establish relevance to your reader, give them a strong reason to believe they’ll find what they’re looking for in your blog post, the more likely they’ll be to dig into your piece and share with others.\n\nOptimize the Design and Layout of Your Blog Post\n\nUltimately, what looks “good” is subjective and up to you, based on what you think your (future) readers will resonate with most. But one of the most important lessons I’ve learned through starting a blog of my own, is that design matters a lot.\n\nThese five time-tested design principles (above) will be immensely helpful in constructing an appealing blog layout that’s easy for readers to digest, from the moment to learn to how to start a blog.\n\nHit Publish on Your First Blog Post\n\nOnce you’ve written your first blog post (and ideally get it to the 1,000+ word range) you’re almost ready to publish!\n\nTake a few minutes to double check on the Yoast SEO suggestions and ensure your blog post is SEO-friendly, which will give you the best chance of ranking well in organic search.\n\nAfter your SEO settings are dialed in, choose which “Category” this new post will fall under and tick that box. Then, you’re ready to hit publish!\n\nAnd boom! It’s that easy if you allow it to be 🎉\n\nNow, if like me, you appreciate great design—before you hit publish on your first blog post, there’s one last step you could take.\n\nStudies show that blog posts with images get 94% more views than those without. And when it comes to posts getting shared on social media, tweets with photos get 150% more retweets that those without one, while Facebook posts with images get 2.3X more engagement. Adding a few visual elements can almost double your amount of views and expand the shares a blog post gets.\n\nFree Blog Photo Resources (Stock Images & Blog Graphics)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to add some visual flair to your blog posts is with beautiful images and designs. Thankfully in recent years, there are now a number of high quality content sites that offer incredible photography that’s completely free to use for your blog—my favorite is Unsplash:\n\nUnsplash (for Free Blog Images and Stock Photos)\n\nUnsplash is the best online resource for completely free, user-uploaded photos for your blog. Every photo that makes it onto Unsplash is curated by their team to make sure it’s high quality content. Under the Unsplash license, you don’t even have to attribute the photographer (however, they recommend you do), which makes Unsplash the easiest option for free blog photography.\n\nOther Great Free Blog Photo Resources Worth Mentioning\n\nWikimedia Commons: 21+ million photos and images from throughout history that are now in the public domain and free to use.\n\nLife of Pix: Awesome free-to-use (open-source) photos donated by an advertising agency in Montreal, Canada.\n\nThe path to learning how to start a blog and make money with it is truly a winding journey that includes learning a lot of related skills along the way.\n\nBonus: Creating a Blog Content Strategy\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to work for some fantastic companies and get paid to learn about the importance of having both a comprehensive blog strategy and content marketing strategy for your blog. I’ve successfully applied those same lessons to my own blog—making many tweaks and additions along the way. And if you’re having trouble with your content planning efforts, grab my free blog planner bundle and check out my other bundle of free blogging resources to turn things up a notch today.\n\nHere’s how to create a basic blog content strategy today:\n\nDefine your blog goals: What’s your purpose for starting a blog? What do you want to achieve with your blog content? Your blog goals might change as you go from learning how to start a blog into growing your blog, but it’s still important to know it early on.\n\nGet to know your blog readers (and where they hang out): Your readers will determine whether or not your blog becomes successful. To write for them, you need to really understand them—which is why it helps if you’re also writing for yourself. It’s useful to some research around the audience you’re writing for. Think about the demographics and psychographics of your target audience. Demographics are the quantitative traits of your readers (age, gender, location, job title) and psychographics are the more unmeasurable traits like values, interests, attitudes and belief systems. Once you’ve written down these qualities, you can start to come up with an audience persona—a fictionalized version of your ideal reader.\n\nDecide on your blog’s main content pillars: When it comes to deciding what you’re going to write about, it’s good to have a few guiding categories that you’ll refer back to. I like to call these content pillars, as they’re the foundation that holds up the rest of your blog. For example, if you’re starting a blog about personal finance, your pillars might be: personal finance tips, interviews with experts, industry news, paying off debt or otherwise. Each of these pillars can have hundreds of blog posts written under them. They also all work together to show that you’re a thought leader in your niche, which is a great goal of learning how to start a blog in the first place.\n\nMap out the content you’re going to create soon after starting your blog: Shortly after launching your blog, it’s worth taking a little time to plan out your content pipeline for the coming weeks (possibly months). You never know when your first blog post might go viral. In that case, you’ll want to have at least a game plan to quickly engage the new readers you get. Even just one or two blog posts under each of your major content pillars is enough to start with, ideally in the form of evergreen content that’ll stand the test of time.\n\nWe’ve now come a long way in this guide. You’ve gone from learning the technicalities, all the way through to publishing your first post.\n\nIt’s time to talk about what happens after you’ve published your first blog post… promoting your content, driving traffic and eventually making money from your blog.\n\nWant my Free Course: How to Start a Profitable Blog in 7 Days?\n\nEnter your name and email address and you’ll get instant access to my course that’s been featured on Forbes, Business Insider and Entrepreneur.\n\n5. Promote Your Blog to Get Readers and Traffic\n\nWe can look back and see that my blog brought in 4.4 million+ readers last year alone. We’re going to use my experience in going from starting a blog—to quickly driving millions of readers to my content. What do you do once you’ve hit publish on your first blog posts? It’s time to learn how to promote your blog content.\n\nThis is the reason I’m hired as a consultant by companies like LinkedIn, Zendesk, Adobe, Close, Intuit and more—to write content for their blogs, teach them how to promote their content and bring in new readers.\n\nHere are a few of the best ways to start sharing your blog posts and getting them in front of new readers. And if you want even more strategies, here’s my guide to learning how to drive traffic to your website where we dig even deeper into the tactics I’ve used to grow my blog to millions of yearly readers.\n\nUsing Social Media to Promote Your Blog\n\nThe obvious first place to turn when you want to find readers is social media. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok are some of the biggest networks today. One of my favorite free blogging tools I’ve built is my YouTube Video to Blog Post Generator, which instantly turns your videos (from YouTube) into blog post drafts you can work with—I couldn’t recommend it more highly.\n\nWhichever platform best suits your niche and audience interests, is the right one for you. And that’s an important note. There’s no point in trying to promote your blog posts on every social media platform.\n\nLook for the social channels that give you the best return\n\nThe key insight here, is that you’ll need to experiment and see which social networks will perform best for you and your type of content.\n\nGuest Blogging on Other Relevant Blogs and Sites like Medium, Quora & Linkedin\n\nOne of the best things about starting a blog is that you’re joining a community of other bloggers that love to help each other out. Guest blogging on other relevant sites is the #1 best way to connect with an already established audience. Check out my ultimate guide to guest blogging for a full walkthrough, but we’ll cover the highlights here.\n\nI’ve written literally hundreds of guest posts over the past decade, and it’s been the single best strategy for promoting my blog content.\n\nThe key point to all of this, is that you want to look for places where your audience is—and be present there, whether that’s other blogs, communities, or social platforms.\n\nForums and Message Boards for Bloggers\n\nOften, just throwing your ideas out into the social media void isn’t very effective.\n\nInstead, being a part of targeted forums and online communities can give you a way better return on your time—if you find the right ones. Browse through relevant groups on Facebook to see if there are any vibrant communities that’d be a good starting point.\n\nNow, if your search doesn’t come up with any Facebook Groups with a decent number of members (5,000+), there are other options. Look for more general groups that relate to your niche on Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit or standalone forum websites.\n\nRemember, forums and message boards aren’t just places to dump links to your blog posts. You need to provide value before you ask for anything in return. So, I recommend you start building relationships and engaging with people there first.\n\nUsing an Email Newsletter to Grow Your Blog Audience\n\nOne of the best forms of blog promotion isn’t to other audiences, but to your own (over time). Building your own email list (or email newsletter) is the most powerful way to keep existing readers engaged with the work you’re doing—and one of the things you should set up immediately.\n\nStart building your email list from day one with your blog—it can be surprisingly simple. Place a signup form within your posts and across key pages of your site. I use a tool I love, called ConvertKit, to manage the 150,000+ email subscribers I now have on my blog, but Mailchimp is the best free email marketing tool to get started with.\n\nNot sure which email marketing tool to use when starting a blog?\n\nRead through my detailed comparison of ConvertKit vs AWeber vs Mailchimp for my take on where you should start and when to upgrade to more robust email marketing tools.\n\nI send my community an update whenever I post a new blog post, have a resource I want to share, or when new podcast episodes go live—and this now ensures my content will quickly be seen by thousands of people right off the bat. Email marketing and promoting content to my own email list has by far been the biggest driver of growth and revenue for my blog, and something I can’t suggest enough amongst all the blog marketing strategies you can invest in.\n\nOther Ways to Promote Your Blog and Get More Blog Traffic\n\nOutside of promotion on social media, through guest posts, in forums and over email—here are a few other techniques I’ve personally used to grow my blog audience quickly.\n\nRemember that the only thing standing in the way of growing your blog is you. It’ll take some ingenuity and the willingness to experiment, but it’s well worth the effort. Trust me, I’ve had to reinvent many times over the years and I’m still learning with my newest side blog, VeganWiki.\n\nAlmost every guide about how to start a blog stops long before this point. Now, I’m going to equip you with the tools (and strategies) to go from starting your new blog—to building a true business around it—based on my experience growing this blog to more than 500,000 monthly readers and $50,000/mo in revenue.\n\nLet’s talk about how to (eventually) make money from your blog.\n\n6. Make Money from Your Blog\n\nLast year alone, my blog generated $449,107 in revenue (ignore the $0 in expenses here, you can see those details in my blog income reports).\n\nI share this not to brag, but so that you’ll understand I know what I’m talking about when it comes to starting a blog and making serious income with it. Moreover, I’ll be the first to tell you that these kinds of income figures aren’t typical with blogging—and that it took me 6 years to reach that point in my blog business.\n\nBe sure to check out my guides on how much bloggers can make & how long does it take to make money from a blog?\n\nThere’s a reason why making money from your blog is at the end of this guide to starting a blog. Unless you have a huge audience somewhere already, you can’t expect to make money right away—monetization should not be your #1 focus at the moment, but rather something to work towards.\n\nPlus, the way you monetize your blog will be different depending upon the type of blog you have. For example, a lifestyle blog will pursue different monetization strategies than say a personal blog, mom blog, dad blog, food blog, beauty blog, fashion blog, pet blog or travel blog—which will all have very unique monetization capabilities.\n\nEven still, it’s good to have an idea of which ways you’d like to make money blogging as you go into this new adventure, especially if you prioritize passive income. Some of these monetization strategies will be easier than others to implement while your readership is still growing.\n\n1. Freelancing (Selling Your Services)\n\nIf you want to begin earning from your blog as quickly as possible, then selling your services (by landing blogging jobs, freelance writing gigs or otherwise selling your expertise as a service) is the easiest option by far. That’s why I love this small business idea. In fact, up until very recently, I was still freelancing as a blog monetization channel for my own business:\n\nAll you really need in order to land a freelance client, is a strong enough pitch, which is where choosing to start a blog (first) will help significantly. You’ll want to build out your key pages (About, Contact, Hire Me) and showcase at least a couple examples of the type of work you’ve done that you’ll soon be pitching freelance clients on.\n\nIf you don’t have those work samples yet… don’t let that hold you back. Create those sample articles, designs or other deliverables and host them on your own blog as if they were a project you got paid to produce.\n\nIf you have a skill that you can sell as a service, then you’re already prepared to go out and start pitching potential clients. That skill could be something like…\n\nWriting (one of the top blogging skills you’ll want to command)\n\nDesign\n\nPhotography\n\nMarketing (whether content marketing, digital marketing or otherwise)\n\nDeveloping (check out these WordPress developer job sites)\n\nPublic relations\n\nSocial media management\n\nVirtual assistance\n\nCommunity-building\n\nSEO or paid advertising campaigns\n\nBusiness strategy or project management\n\nThe list goes on… because any skill can be monetized\n\nToday, I still regularly book new freelance clients (like LinkedIn, Zendesk, Adobe) for $5,000/mo or more and I’m brought on to advise and execute on creating blog marketing campaigns for their organization.\n\nIf freelancing sounds like your cup of tea, you’ll want to grab my (free) collection of all my best resources, tools and templates for freelancers. That resource bundle is the culmination of more than 8 years of refining my freelance contract template, proposal template, cold email templates that convert new clients and more.\n\nI also put together an in-depth guide to getting started with freelancing that you’ll want to read and another great foundational read about how to develop a pitching process that works for your type of business, is my freelancer’s guide to cold emailing. And if you want to try out some of the websites where freelance clients are already looking for talented help, here are my lists of both the best blogging job sites and the best freelance job sites.\n\n2. Affiliate Programs\n\nLet’s talk affiliate marketing. Every month, I earn a substantial amount of passive income from the affiliate programs that I’m a member of (sometimes in excess of $50,000+). For example, here’s a screenshot of my blog income from just one affiliate program (Bluehost) for the first 5 months of last year.\n\nSince starting a blog here 10 years ago, affiliate income has gradually grown to become the largest revenue source for my business—and I’ve structured my blog to generate affiliate income because of how passive it is once you’ve done the (hard) work to find a sustainable traffic source for your content. I highly recommend thoughtfully pursuing affiliate marketing in your blogging niche.\n\nMost of the biggest brands have affiliate programs. Think companies like Amazon, all the way down to key players in specific niches like online education where brands like CreativeLive and Udemy have lucrative programs. Here’s a snapshot of my recent earnings from just a couple of other programs:\n\nOnce you build a small readership, you can go out and broker a more advantageous affiliate deal with companies that have relevant products you want to promote to your audience. For a LOT more on the subject of monetizing your blog with affiliate income, check out these guides:\n\nWhat is Affiliate Marketing? Guide to Making Money in Affiliate Marketing\n\n57+ Best Affiliate Programs for Bloggers (to Earn Affiliate Income)\n\n10 Ways Affiliate Marketing Can Completely Transform Your Blog\n\nHow I Earn an Extra $1,000 a Month with Amazon Affiliate Marketing\n\nWhile all blog income sources will be subject to changes in the market at anytime, affiliate marketing has proven to be one of the most sustainable for nearly a decade of blog monetization here—and I’m constantly testing out new affiliate programs to keep growing my blog’s income.\n\n3. Sponsored Blog Content\n\nUnless you already have a decent sized audience on your blog (or social accounts), it’ll take some time to grow your readership to a point where sponsored blog content is a viable monetization option.\n\nThe best way to do sponsored content without alienating your readers, is to weave it into your typical publishing style (like I’ve done with this sponsored post and this one too).\n\n4. Online Courses\n\nOnce you have a skill (or experience) that others also want to learn, it’s relatively easy to package your best advice (like my blogging tips), strategies, tactics and tutorials into an online course where people can pay for access to accelerate their learning much quicker than they otherwise would going through the stumbling process of learning through trial and error.\n\nLast year alone, I generated over $60,000 from the launch of my premium blogging course, Built to Blog, which takes students far beyond just starting a blog and into advanced strategies for getting readers & generating revenue from their blogs.\n\nWhat’s great about an online course as a monetization path for your blog (or like I’ve done with selling blogging books too), is that you don’t need a huge audience in order to earn from online courses. The same goes if you choose to write an ebook and sell that digital product to your audience.\n\n5. Traditional Blog Advertisements (Ad Networks)\n\nI used to have several small blog advertisements displayed across my content (from one of these top blog advertising networks) and in my blog sidebar that would earn me around $1,500 to $2,000 per month in incremental revenue, before I turned advertisements off in favor of optimizing for page speed & other sources of income.\n\nI was a member of a small ad network called Carbon Ads for the first few years of my blogging journey, where they partner with bloggers and pair us up with ads from high-quality startups like Slack, Asana, Freshbooks, Monday, Upwork and other targeted brands that my audience is already familiar with.\n\nAll in all, traditional CPC or CPM advertising doesn’t become very profitable (at least as a viable source of substantial blog income) until you’re driving more like 1 million+ monthly readers, so it’s not a great monetization channel to focus on in the short-term if you’re just hosting a few ads in your blog sidebar. But, when you’re starting a blog, it can be one of the easiest ways to make money from your traffic without much extra effort—just be sure to set the right expectations for now.\n\n6. Podcast Sponsorships\n\nAnother great way to start monetizing your blog is by starting a podcast for your readers. You can use your traffic and early listener numbers to book sponsorships from brands that want to reach your type of readers & listeners. Here’s the growth trajectory of my podcast over it’s first year:\n\nYou can even combine podcast ad placement offers with sponsored blog posts on your site to really sweeten the deal.\n\nI understand that launching a podcast while you’re still mastering blogging sounds like a diversion, but keep in mind that a podcast can be as simple as casual conversations with other bloggers in your industry. All you really need is podcast hosting and some solid editing tools like Descript to get a show off the ground. Check out my quick guide if you’re considering a blog vs podcast.\n\nFor many more on the mechanics behind launching a podcast and monetizing it alongside your blog (including choosing the right podcast hosting), check out this episode of my show with Michael Sacca of Rocketship.fm, whose grown his podcast into a $10,000/mo source of side income while he still holds onto his day job in sales and digital marketing. It’s a true masterclass in starting a podcast that you don’t want to miss.\n\n7. Physical Products (eCommerce) and Software Tools\n\nSimilar in concept to launching an online course to your blog audience, another great way to monetize your audience is by selling a physical product or software tool to the people in your community—especially if you’ll be starting an eCommerce store (with the right eCommerce website builders) to sell products that are related to what your readers need.\n\nAt the end of the day, this one all comes back down to solving the problems your blog readers have. If you need some added incentive, consider that 75% of online shoppers say they use social media as a part of their buying process.\n\nTake for example, my AI-powered content creation platform, RightBlogger, which I launched with my friend Andy, to help solve a major problem for new bloggers—by getting them affordable access to fantastic tech-enabled tools to speed up their content creation process.\n\nOn the physical product front, it once used to be a much more labor intensive business to open an online store and get into eCommerce. However, it’s become increasingly easy with platforms like Shopify and can be a great way to monetize an audience of readers on your blog—especially with the proliferation of drop shipping and order fulfillment services.\n\nOn top of just selling to your own audience, you can leverage loyalty programs that incentivize customers to invite friends to purchase with offers like first-time customer discounts, free one-month trials, gifting programs and more. These channels create opportunities for amplifying your message and spreading your products through word-of-mouth marketing efforts that won’t cost you anywhere near that of similar advertising fees.\n\nTune in to my interview with Hiten Shah, who went from teaching himself how to start a blog, to now using his personal blog as a way to connect with his audience and release profitable software tools as a result of the validation conversations he’s had with them.\n\n8. Business Partnerships\n\nOf all the ways to monetize your blog, this is the most amorphous. Who knows who you’ll meet as a result. What about future guests on your podcast?
