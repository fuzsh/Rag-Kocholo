        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — A pair of Amazon TV projects, one with Britain’s former “Top Gear” hosts and a Woody Allen series, are drawing scrutiny from TV critics.\n\nAmazon Studios chief Roy Price, promoting upcoming fare at a critics’ meeting Monday, was asked if the baggage accompanying Allen and the car show trio make them wise choices for the streaming service.\n\nJeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond of BBC’s “Top Gear,” an international hit, left amid scandal over an off-set altercation in which a producer was punched.\n\nDo the men know what the boundaries should be and can Amazon ensure they will behave appropriately, one reporter asked.\n\nThey have “produced a great show for many years and … there’s a lot to focus on other” than the controversy, Price said. “So I think we feel very bullish that it’s going to be a fun show that their fans around the world are going to love.”\n\nThe Amazon series from Oscar-winning filmmaker Allen is his first for TV. His personal reputation was shadowed when he had an affair with and then married girlfriend Mia Farrow’s adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, and by claims that he molested adopted daughter Dylan Farrow when she was a child.\n\nAllen has denied the allegation, which was investigated and didn’t result in charges. But attention to the matter has been renewed when he brings out a new project.\n\nGiven that, a reporter asked, why did the network go after him?\n\n“Woody Allen is one of the greatest filmmakers America has ever produced … (and) people are going to be talking about Woody’s films for a long, long time,” Price said.\n\nEverything about Allen was taken into account, Price said, “but our focus is on the fact that he is a great filmmaker and storyteller, and so we look forward to the show in 2016.”\n\nHe said he met with Allen last week on the as-yet untitled half-hour series and the scripts for season one are nearly completed, with shooting expected to start by January. The series is expected to air in the second half of next year.\n\nThe car series with the ex-“Top Gear” hosts also is planned for next year, but no date or other details were announced."
