To commemorate the bizarre connection between these two former Konigsbergs, Masha Vasyukova, a native of the city makes it her mission to put up a statue in Kaliningrad in honor of Woody Allen.\n\nPlaying with\n\nRoth on Roth (Philip Roth, sanse complexe)\n\nDocumentary/France/52 minutes/2011\n\nDirected by William Karel\n\nIn this surprisingly candid documentary, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Philip Roth offers unprecedented access to his prolific career. The often elusive and reclusive author provides expansive insights into his writing methods, reflections on mortality, struggles with depression and often controversial body of work. The scandalous content of such novels as Portnoys Complaint and Goodbye, Columbus made Roth a lightning rod for criticism. Roth draws heavily on his life experiences and Jewish upbringing, while insisting, I dont write Jewish, I write American. This intimate film is a rare and moving portrait of America's greatest living writer."
