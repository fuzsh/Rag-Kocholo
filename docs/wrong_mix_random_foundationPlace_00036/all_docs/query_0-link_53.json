        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â Carl Reiner, the ingenious and versatile writer, actor and director who broke through as a âsecond bananaâ to Sid Caesar and rose to comedyâs front ranks as creator of âThe Dick Van Dyke Showâ and straight man to Mel Brooksâ â2000 Year Old Man,â has died. He was 98.\n\nReinerâs assistant Judy Nagy said he died Monday night of natural causes at his home in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nOne of show businessâ best liked men, the tall, bald Reiner was a welcome face on the small and silver screens, in Caesarâs 1950s troupe, as the snarling, toupee-wearing Alan Brady of âThe Dick Van Dyke Showâ and in such films as âThe Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Comingâ and âItâs a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.â\n\nIn recent years, he was part of the roguish gang in the âOceanâs Elevenâ movies starring George Clooney and appeared in documentaries including âBroadway: Beyond the Golden Ageâ and âIf Youâre Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast.â\n\nTributes poured in online, including from actor Josh Gadd, who called Reiner âone of the greatest comedic minds of all time,â and writer Bill Kristol, who said: âWhat a life!â Actor Alan Alda tweeted âHis talent will live on for a long time, but the loss of his kindness and decency leaves a hole in our hearts.â\n\nFilms Reiner directed included âOh, God!â starring George Burns and John Denver; âAll of Me,â with Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin; and the 1970 comedy âWhereâs Poppa?â He was especially proud of his books, including âEnter Laughing,â an autobiographical novel later adapted into a film and Broadway show; and âMy Anecdotal Life,â a memoir published in 2003. He recounted his childhood and creative journey in the 2013 book, âI Remember Me.â\n\nBut many remember Reiner for âThe Dick Van Dyke Show,â one of the most popular TV series of all time and a model of ensemble playing, physical comedy and timeless, good-natured wit. It starred Van Dyke as a television comedy writer working for a demanding, eccentric boss (Reiner) and living with his wife (Mary Tyler Moore in her first major TV role) and son.\n\nâThe Van Dyke show is probably the most thrilling of my accomplishments because that was very, very personal,â Reiner once said. âIt was about me and my wife, living in New Rochelle and working on the Sid Caesar show.\"\n\nThe pilot, written by Reiner, starred himself as Rob Petrie, and aired in July 1960. When the show was reworked (CBS executives worried Reiner would make the lead character seem too Jewish), Van Dyke was cast and the program ran from 1961 to 1966. One famous fan, Orson Welles, was known for rushing to his bedroom in the afternoon so he could be near a TV when the show was on.\n\nâAlthough it was a collaborative effort,â³ Van Dyke later wrote, âeverything about the show stemmed from his (Reinerâs) endlessly and enviably fascinating, funny, and fertile brain and trickled down to the rest of us.\"\n\nThe story line had Petrie as the head writer for âThe Alan Brady Show,â a comedy-variety series not unlike âYour Show of Shows,â in which Reiner, as Brady, was the egocentric star. Petrieâs fellow writers were character actors Morey Amsterdam as Buddy Sorrell and Rose Marie as Sally Rogers.\n\nIt was an early parody of the Caesar show, which would later be dramatized in the film âMy Favorite Yearâ and Neil Simonâs play âLaughter on the 23rd Floor.â\n\nBesides acting in and producing the âVan Dykeâ series, Reiner wrote or co-wrote dozens of episodes. Although the show was the very best of good clean fun, it wasnât clean enough for network censors. Reiner often battled network officials over the sleeping arrangements of Rob and his wife; the Petries slept in twin beds. He wanted them to sleep in a double bed.\n\nReiner had joined the classic comedy revue âYour Show of Showsâ in 1950 after performing in Broadway plays. Much of Reinerâs early work came as a âsecond bananaâ â although, as Caesar once put it, âSuch bananas donât grow on trees.â He performed in sketches â satirizing everything from foreign films to rock ânâ roll â and added his talents to a writing team that included Brooks, Simon, Woody Allen and Larry Gelbart.\n\nâAs second banana,â he told TV Guide, âI had a chance to do just about everything a performer can ever get to do. If it came off well, I got all the applause. If it didnât, the show was blamed.â\n\nIt was during the âShow of Showsâ years that Reiner and Brooks started improvising skits which became the basis for âThe 2000 Year Old Man.â Reiner was the interviewer, Brooks the old man and witness to history.\n\nReiner: âDid you know Jesus?â\n\nBrooks: âI knew Christ, Christ was a thin lad, always wore sandals. Hung around with 12 other guys. They came in the store, no one ever bought anything. Once they asked for water.â\n\nAfter the pair performed the routine at a party, Reiner said Steve Allen insisted they turn their banter into a record. The album, â2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks,â appeared in 1960 and was the start of a million-selling franchise.\n\nThe duo won a Grammy in 1998 for their âThe 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000â and Reiner won multiple Emmys for his television work. In 2000, he received the Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for Humor. When the sound system failed at the start of the ceremonies, Reiner called from the balcony, âDoes anybody have four double-A batteries?â\n\nBesides âAll of Me,â Reiner directed Martin in âDead Men Donât Wear Plaid,â âThe Man With Two Brainsâ and âThe Jerk.â\n\nReiner is the father of actor-director Rob Reiner. The younger Reiner starred as Archie Bunkerâs son-in-law on âAll in the Family,â and directed âWhen Harry Met Sally ...â and âThe Princess Bride.â Rob Reiner said in a tweet Tuesday that his \"heart is hurting. He was my guiding light.\"\n\nCarl Reiner was born in 1922, in New York Cityâs borough of the Bronx, one of two sons of Jewish immigrants. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood, where he learned to mimic voices and tell jokes. After high school, Reiner attended drama school, then joined a small theater group.\n\nDuring World War II, Reiner joined the Army and toured in GI variety shows for a year and a half. Back out of uniform, he landed several stage roles, breaking through on Broadway in âCall Me Mister.â\n\nHe married his wife, Estelle, in 1943. Besides son Rob, the couple had another son, Lucas, a film director, and a daughter, Sylvia, a psychoanalyst and author. Estelle Reiner, who died in 2008, had a small role in Rob Reinerâs âWhen Harry Met Sally...â â as the woman who overhears Meg Ryanâs in a restaurant and says, âIâll have what sheâs having.â\n\nHis greatest disappointment was âBert Rigby, Youâre a Fool,â a 1989 musical he wrote and directed that starred Robert Lindsay, a British actor Reiner believed could be a new Dick Van Dyke. The film flopped, and Reinerâs career as a director faded.\n\nReiner, inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciencesâ Hall of Fame, remained involved in other entertainment projects. In the 1990s, he reprised the Alan Brady character for an episode of âMad About You.â\n\nHis death was first reported Tuesday by celebrity website TMZ.\n\n____\n\nAP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
