        "text": "It would make life easier if Woody Allen’s movies were as easy and as right to condemn as his behavior. But that’s not my experience of his movies, and this makes it difficult both to watch and to write about them. In 2014, Allen’s daughter Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter, published in the Times, detailing her claims that Allen sexually molested her, on multiple occasions, when she was a child. Allen has denied wrongdoing. We cannot say for sure what happened. I can say what I believe: I believe Dylan Farrow. With considered queasiness, I have continued to watch Allen’s films as they’re released, including his new one, “Wonder Wheel,” which opens this weekend. It is strange and unpleasant to admit that I have found many of them to be substantial experiences—and that much of their power is inseparable from the accusations that have been made against Allen.\n\nWhen writing about Allen’s recent movies, I haven’t addressed the over-all question of whether we can (or should) separate the artist from the art. I’ve always considered that idea absurd, because the very quality that makes movies worthwhile is how they express the personality, the character, the ideas, the experiences of their makers. The problem with learning about the artist from the art is that artists sometimes reveal themselves to be troubled, troubling people, and bring to light their ugly traits, ideas, or even actions. The depth of a complex work that deals with horrific but authentic aspects of life is sometimes found in the artists’ personal implications in those parts of life.\n\nThere has always been something sexually sordid in Allen’s work. I certainly wasn’t the only viewer who found one of the central relationships in “Manhattan” (1980)—between Allen’s character, the forty-two-year-old Isaac, and the seventeen-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway)—to be creepy. The sheer disparity of experience between a successful television writer and a high-school student (even a smart and talented one) adds an element of cavalier power to the relationship, one that Isaac flaunts with his repeated insistence that it’s just a short-term fling (whereas Tracy considers it to be love). The movie he made next, “Stardust Memories,” is also one of his most unsavory, albeit in sidelong details. In one scene, a teen-age girl calls the character played by Allen “sexy”; and there is a long scene in which Allen’s character, against the backdrop of a poster saying “incest,” defends himself against the accusation of flirting with a girl of thirteen.\n\nIt wasn’t until “Crimes and Misdemeanors,” from 1989, that I grew disgusted with Allen. In the film, he plays a documentary filmmaker named Cliff whose most substantial and serious intellectual and personal relationship is with his niece, Jenny (Jenny Nichols), whom he takes to watch classic movies at the late, lamented Bleecker Street Cinema, and to whom he pontificates cheerfully, innocently—basking in her admiration while hardly giving her a chance to speak. Nothing illicit whatsoever is depicted or implied. Yet Cliff’s intense interest in Jenny struck me, when I first saw the movie, as an oblivious surrogate for a romantic relationship, and I was repelled both by the movie’s tone and by Allen’s apparent lack of awareness of the implications of what he was both depicting and enacting.\n\nThe news, in 1992, of Allen’s relationship with Soon-Yi Previn—the daughter of Mia Farrow, with whom Allen was in a relationship at the time—was, so to speak, a shock but not a surprise: he had expressed his desires in his movies. Previn was thirty-five years his junior. Allen had adopted two of Farrow’s children, Dylan and Moses, and Allen and Farrow had a child together, Ronan (who writes for The New Yorker). Farrow and Allen broke up; later that year, during their battle over custody of their children, accusations emerged that Allen had molested Dylan, who was then seven years old. I don’t remember reading about the accusations at the time—I first became aware of them in 2014, when Dylan published her piece in the Times. It’s entirely possible that I had seen a headline or heard news back then but wrongly dismissed the allegations as the sort of rumor that’s spread during a bitter custody dispute. And if that’s so, it’s all too indicative of a socially acceptable and widely confirmed indifference at the time to the word of women regarding sexual improprieties.\n\nMore recently, I’ve realized that I had overlooked important personal aspects of “Crimes and Misdemeanors.” The story has two main strands. One involves a doctor (Martin Landau) who arranges for the murder of his mistress (Anjelica Huston) after she threatens to tell his wife (Claire Bloom) about their affair. The other shows the struggling Cliff—who is attempting to make a documentary about a philosopher and Holocaust survivor (Martin Bergmann)—accepting a well-paying job from his big-shot TV-producer brother-in-law (Alan Alda), who uses his shows as his personal sexual playground. As ugly as Cliff’s breezy relationship with Jenny may be, the rest of the film plays like an anticipatory confession not so much to actual crimes as to tormenting impulses. The lines of dialogue, actions, and gestures suggest an impending moral cataclysm. It’s a to-be-or-not-to-be film that evokes an unstable, agonizing tension regarding evil desires and anticipation of evil deeds, and the intensity of this guilt and torment has marked Allen’s films ever since.\n\nIn “Celebrity,” from 1999, sex is busting out all over, especially in the workplace, where media men shamelessly and aggressively pursue the women in their work circles. The story of the film is essentially the destructive force of desire on the work and the life of a serious artist—and it ends with a literal, cosmic call for help (in the sky, via an airplane’s skywriting). In “Hollywood Ending,” Allen plays a director stricken with the Oedipal punishment of blindness—and whose cure involves reconciliation with his estranged son and ex-wife. Still, there’s an enervated, narrowed aspect to Allen’s films of the nineties and early two-thousands. Allen had strolled the streets of New York City and savored the city’s public pleasures with a simple and conspicuous ardor, and now he couldn’t go out. He didn’t find his artistic energy again until he became an exile of sorts. He went to Great Britain, filmed “Match Point,” released in 2005, in London, and, with scant regard to local mores and habits, using locations without much sociology and characters without much context, created a stark, brisk, furious melodrama that’s similar to “Crimes and Misdemeanors.” But where the earlier film conjures a wide web of harrowing prospects while distributing their expression among a wide range of characters, “Match Point” condenses its action around one chilly, explicitly Dostoyevskian megalomaniac, a young tennis pro named Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a thoroughgoing deceiver and cynic who plots to save his marriage by killing his lover, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), and can neither bear the prospect of getting away with it nor of getting caught. Like “Crimes and Misdemeanors,” it’s a grandly and deftly theatrical flourish of nihilism, a vision of the inescapable torments of conscience in a random world of moral horror.\n\nAllen’s later films don’t offer many specific observations, whether about relationships or places. They’re films of ideas and emotions, realized symbolically, with a mode of direction, of stylized performance, of fast but spare writing, that wears its artifice as conspicuously as if it were a series of musical production numbers. But their predominant emotions and ideas involve self-loathing, self-destruction, and guilt; crime, punishment, and non-punishment. Allen’s 2007 tragedy, “Cassandra’s Dream,” leads swiftly from the tightening of family bonds to howling catastrophe; his 2013 drama, “Blue Jasmine,” shows a spiral of agonies issuing from a middle-aged man’s hidden crime, from his affair with a nineteen-year-old woman—and from his wife’s quest for revenge. Allen stages fantasy allusions to his own death in the 2006 murder comedy “Scoop,” and in the 2015 murder drama “Irrational Man.” His chattily comedic six-part series for Amazon, “Crisis in Six Scenes,” from 2016, shows a character played by Allen getting away with a serious crime by the power of his celebrity.\n\nOf course, the recognition of evil feelings and impulses isn’t the sole dominion of criminals, and guilt isn’t solely the torment of gross offenders; the virtuous are all the more likely to feel guilt on the basis of ordinary personal failings, the inherent tensions and conflicts of even constructive family relationships, romances, and friendships, ordinary compromises at work, a sense of responsibility for mere day-to-day passivity, willed indifference, self-delusion. An artist who can illuminate those powerful, ubiquitous, destructive, morally complex feelings and dramatize them in a range of public and private contexts, from professional to artistic to domestic, is one whose work is worth experiencing. It’s a horrible paradox that the modern filmmaker who explores those emotions most relentlessly, most painfully, and most compellingly is one who is accused of doing things that would give him good reason to feel them.\n\nAllen’s new film, “Wonder Wheel,” is a story of artistic aspirations and stifled dreams, of absent love and long-ago regret, of betrayal and deceit and, above all, of death. The story is told from the perspective of the young aspiring playwright Mickey (Justin Timberlake), who is working as a lifeguard for the summer on Coney Island. Ginny (Kate Winslet), a waitress in a clam house, is a former actress nearing forty whose ambitions were smothered by desperate necessity. She’s married to the loud, crude, simple, yet bighearted Humpty (Jim Belushi), who runs the carousel in the amusement park, and her son from her previous marriage, Richie (Jack Gore), lives with them in a crowded and ramshackle seaside shack alongside it. Ginny and Mickey are having an affair. But Carolina (Juno Temple), Humpty’s twentysomething daughter with his first wife, suddenly turns up. Carolina had married a gangster against Humpty’s wishes, and Humpty disowned her; now, divorced, and fleeing hit men, she turns up at the shack seeking refuge, and Mickey, meeting her by chance at the beach, falls in love with her.\n\nLike all of Allen’s later films, the story’s practical connections are flimsy and the characterizations are thin. But the tightly twisted film-noir-like plot gives rise to terrifying bursts of rage and hatred, spontaneous outpourings of tenderness, the mental clamor of life-and-death desperation. Scattered throughout the film are hints of torments, as when Ginny suggests that Humpty has an “unnatural attachment” to Carolina; when Ginny, in a crisis of jealousy, berates Carolina with angry and frantic questions: “Did he try anything? Did he touch you? Did he take your hand? Did he do anything? Did he kiss you?”; or when Mickey offers Ginny a book by Eugene O’Neill, saying that O’Neill shows “how we have to lie to ourselves in order to live.” There’s also the damaged, bewildered Richie, growing up amid betrayals and deceptions and dangers and acting out as a pyromaniac. Through the splashes of bright colors, the touches of local color, and the reverse telescope of distant memory and period nostalgia, “Wonder Wheel” virtually shrieks with confessional anguish and is scarred with indelible regret.\n\nIt’s worth observing and lamenting the litany of victims in Allen’s work—the Carolinas and the Nolas, the mistresses and the wives, the girls getting undue attention and the lost, troubled boys. It’s a distressing measure of Allen’s achievement that his films are a record of their experience, as well—another measure of the inseparability of the artist and the art. In the bleak realm of amoral horror and troubled conscience that Allen depicts, he isn’t just a virtual character or participant—he’s also an observer. He has been working in the movies for half a century, and in entertainment even longer. The world that he depicts in his films is one in which the powerful abuse their power to prey upon the vulnerable and, until now, have, for the most part, gotten away with it. It’s also a world that, because of the courageous testimony of women including, crucially, Dylan Farrow, is now coming to light and, perhaps, to change."
