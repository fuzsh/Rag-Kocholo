        "text": "Mickey Rose, the comedy scribe who grew up with Woody Allen and went on to write for him, died in Beverly Hills, Calif., of cancer on April 7. He was 77.\n\nRose nabbed his first professional gig working for ventriloquist Shari Lewis, jotting jokes for her famous hand puppet, Lamb Chop. Rose’s extensive career included writing credits on TV specials and features, including solo projects such as comedies “I Wonder Who’s Killing Her Now” and “Student Bodies,” which he also helmed.\n\nBorn Michael Rose in Brooklyn, N.Y. on May 20, 1935, Rose and childhood friend Allan Stewart Konigsberg, a.k.a. Woody Allen, spent their days playing hooky and catching Ingmar Bergman pics. The bond persisted well past school days, as Allen helped launch Rose’s screenwriting career. The duo collaborated on Allen’s early scripts “What’s Up, Tiger Lily?” “Take the Money & Run” and “Bananas,” as well as some of Allen’s TV specials.\n\nRose’s other TV credits include “The Sid Caesar Show,” “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,” “The Dean Martin Comedy Hour,” “The Smothers Brothers” and “Taxi.” He also wrote for Dick Van Dyke and Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nRose was predeceased by his wife of 40 years, Judy, in 2003. He is survived by his son, Quincy, his daughter, Jennifer and two grandchildren.\n\nDonations may be made to ASPCA or the American Cancer Society."
