        "text": "An anthology of the late Norman Mailer’s writing that Random House allegedly had scheduled for his centennial in 2023, but backed off from, will be released by a publisher that has taken on such discarded works as Woody Allen’s memoir “Apropos of Nothing” and a Philip Roth biography written by Blake Bailey.\n\nDuring a tribute to her career at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), Penelope Cruz recalled the Betamax videotape store that opened in her neighborhood, in a suburb of Madrid, when she was a child and that made her discover cinema.\n\nFILE - Director Woody Allen attends a special screening of \"Wonder Wheel\" on Nov. 14, 2017, in New York.

To its benefit and to its dismay, publishing was drawn into the events of the moment. Penguin Random House, among other initiatives, asked all employees to read Ibram X. Kendi’s “How To Be an Anti-Racist.” Kendi later presided over a company town hall. Macmillan CEO Don Weisberg, who cited a wide range of diversity programs at the publishing house that began before “American Dirt,” said he “understands the skepticism.\" The CEO of Penguin Random House U.S., Madeline McIntosh, noted how well book publishing could meet the public's needs during the pandemic and other events of 2020.\n\nNEW YORK – One of publishing's most thriving genres of the past four years, books about President Donald Trump, is not going to end when he leaves office. In 2021 and beyond, look for waves of releases about the Trump administration and about the president's loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden. “But there are tens of millions of Americans who look to the Trump presidency as an important time and are fans of his administration. Center Street, a Hachette Book Group imprint, has published Donald Trump Jr., Newt Gingrich and Judge Jeanine Pirro among others. Any publisher signing with Trump or a top administration official might face the anger not just of Trump critics among the general public, but from within the industry.\n\nFILE - In this April 10, 2014, file photo, actor Nick Cordero attends the after-party for the opening night of \"Bullets Over Broadway\" in New York.

At HBG we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly,” the publisher announced. Allen has denied any wrongdoing and was never charged after two separate investigations in the 1990s. Ronan Farrow followed up a day later, calling Hachette’s decision “wildly unprofessional.” Both he and his sister complained that the publisher had not reached out to fact check their father’s book.\n\nNEW YORK, N.Y. – An upcoming memoir by Woody Allen is being blasted by two of his children, daughter Dylan Farrow and author-journalist Ronan Farrow.

Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group, announced Monday that the book is called “Apropos of Nothing” and will be released April 7. Dylan Farrow added that she was never contacted by fact-checkers for the memoir: “This provides yet another example of the profound privilege that power, money and notoriety affords. He also said he had no notice that Allen's book was forthcoming.\n\nThis cover image released by Grand Central Publishing shows \"Apropos of Nothing,\" an autobiography by Woody Allen, to be released on April 7. (Grand Central Publishing via AP)NEW YORK, N.Y. – A memoir by Woody Allen, rumored for years and once thought unpublishable in the #MeToo era, is coming out next month. An Allen memoir nearly came out more than a decade ago. In 2018-2019, several publishers, citing #MeToo concerns, reportedly rebuffed an Allen representative who was seeking a deal for his memoir. An Allen memoir once seemed the most obvious of publications.\n\nSome people rail against this \"cancel culture\" while others say it's necessary. \"[Cancel culture] doesn't really work,\" Wortham says. This, in a lot of ways, is what cancel culture has become. Some people argue that cancel culture is justified because celebrities are facing repercussions for their actions.

According to the lawsuit, Amazon backed out of its agreement with Allen and his production company in June after Dylan Farrow became more vocal about her accusation that her father had molested her. \"Amazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year-old, baseless allegation against Mr. Allen, but that allegation was already well known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr. Allen -- and, in any event it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract,\" the lawsuit said. According to the lawsuit, Amazon entered into an agreement with Allen's Gravier Productions to finance and distribute at least four Allen films. The lawsuit claims Allen completed the first, \"A Rainy Day in New York,\" when Amazon \"simply refused to make its guaranteed payment and purported to terminate\" the contract."
