With a Mars Distribution logo and French subtitles, it is here to promote the French release of the film on 11th May, the first territory where the film will open.\n\nWe learn so much. We first learnt that this story would be about a family, and it looks like that big cast was more connected than we thought. Steve Carell‘s named Phil and his sister is Jeannie Berlin plays Rose, who is married to Ken Stott. Their son is Bobby, played by Jesse Eisenberg, and Vonnie (Kristen Stewart) is Carell’s assistant. Corey Stoll is Bobby’s brother Ben. We also see Anna Camp and Blake Lively, Parker Posey and Paul Schnieder.\n\nIt also looks far more glamorous than we imagined. It looks like a Wes Anderson film. Vittorio Storaro, the cinematographer, seems to have played a big role in the film. There’s references to actors and old Hollywood, gangsters and more.\n\nMore as it develops!"
