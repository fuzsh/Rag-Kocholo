        "text": "Keith McNally has no problem defending Woody Allen.\n\nThe British restaurateur shared his support for the director on Instagram Monday as he prepared to undergo kidney stone surgery in London.\n\n“If I don’t come out of this alive I’d like to say a big F—K OFF right now to everybody on Instagram who criticized me for supporting the INNOCENT Woody Allen,” he captioned a carousel of photos of himself in the hospital.\n\nThe Balthazar restaurant owner, 72, has stood behind the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who has for years denied allegations of molesting his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was a child.\n\nDylan, 38, has long maintained that Allen — who adopted her as a baby with Mia Farrow — sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.\n\nMeanwhile, the “Blue Jasmine” writer-director, 88, has labeled the accusations as “an unconscionable and gruesomely damaging manipulation of innocent children for vindictive and self-serving motives.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nWhen Hachette Book Group canceled the publication of Allen’s memoir in the spring of 2020, McNally lashed out on Instagram, calling the decision a “dangerous victory for censorship.”\n\nBut the outspoken entrepreneur has a history of posting his controversial opinions.\n\nLast year, he came under fire for an inflammatory post following the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel.\n\n“The More Utterly Repugnant The Facts, The Greater The Responsibility Becomes To Listen To The Other Side,” he wrote.\n\nMcNally initially hit back at critics by saying that he’s “part Jewish” and “lived for long stretches of time on an Israeli kibbutz.”\n\n“I think the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas are vile, barbaric and totally repugnant,” he continued.\n\n“But I stand by what i wrote this morning: THE MORE UTTERLY REPUGNANT THE FACTS, THE GREATER THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LISTEN TO THE OTHER SIDE. This doesn’t mean forgive.”\n\nHowever, he apologized days later, explaining that he has “never once” in his life “recognized nor supported Hamas.”\n\n“It is a terrorist organization comprising of murderers and thugs. I apologize for my post,” he wrote.\n\nMcNally then removed the post from his account and turned off the comments on his apology statement.\n\nFans may recall that the British-born restauranteur also had drama in 2022 with James Corden, whom he cheekily included in his carousel post Monday.\n\nAt the time, McNally made headlines for calling the former “Late Late Show” host, 45, the “most abusive” customer he’s had at Balthazar since its opening.\n\n“James Corden is a Hugely gifted comedian, but a tiny Cretin of a man. And the most abusive customer to my Balthazar servers since the restaurant opened 25 years ago,” he wrote."
