        "text": "Mickey Rose, a writer who grew up with Woody Allen and went on to write several films with Allen, died April 7, 2013, in Beverly Hills, California. He was 77.\n\nAccording to news reports, the cause was cancer.\n\nBorn Michael Rose in Brooklyn, New York, on May 20, 1935, Rose befriended Allan Stewart Konigsberg — who later adopted the name Woody Allen — as a child. When Allen began his film career, he gave Rose the opportunity to contribute to his screenplay. The two men collaborated on Allen’s early projects What’s Up, Tiger Lily?, Take the Money and Run and Bananas, as well as some of Allen’s television specials.\n\nWhen Rose joined up with Allen, he had already written for television, including the The Sid Caesar Show in 1963. He got his start writing for Shari Lewis, who performed with the hand puppet Lamb Chop.\n\nOver the ensuing decades, his other television credits included The Funny Side, The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters, The Dean Martin Comedy Hour, The Smothers Brothers Show, All in the Family, Charlie's Angels, Love, American Style, The Odd Couple, Happy Days, Taxi, The Stockard Channing Show, Van Dyke and Company, Too Close for Comfort, 227 and others.\n\nHis other movie scripts included the comedies I Wonder Who’s Killing Her Now and Student Bodies, which he also directed.\n\nDonations may be made to ASPCA or the American Cancer Society.\n\nRead more at:"
