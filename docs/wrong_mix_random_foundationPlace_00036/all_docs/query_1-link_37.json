        "text": "Matthew Perry’s will names his half-sibling, parents, and an ex-girlfriend as beneficiaries of his estate, the vast majority of which was placed in a trust named after Woody Allen’s character in the 1977 film Annie Hall, according to legal filings first obtained by TMZ on Monday. The tabloid reported that Perry had more than $1 million in personal property upon his death at age 54 last October, a figure that constitutes the assets that hadn’t already been placed in the Alvy Singer Living Trust at that point. Perry created his last will and testament in 2009, naming his beneficiaries as father John Perry, mother Suzanne Morrison, half-sister Caitlin Morrison, and former partner Rachel Dunn. It names as co-executors of his estate Lisa Ferguson, his longtime business manager, and Robin Ruzan, Mike Myers’ ex-wife and an executive producer of Celebrity Liar, a game show on which Perry appeared in 2010. The legal documents, filed by Perry’s lawyers this month, indicate that Ruzan declined to act as an executor, according to Us Weekly. A hearing on Perry’s will is set to be held in Los Angeles next month."
