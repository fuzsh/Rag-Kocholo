He was promoted to European Sales Manager in Paris in 1968 and then named President of UA Europe two years later, a post he held for five years. UA relocated him to New York in 1975 as VP International Sales at the time when it was distributing films from the likes of Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone, Saul Zaentz, Milos Forman and Brian de Palma.\n\nDuring his 22-year tenure at UA, Goldschmidt oversaw international distribution on the James Bond franchise, the Beatles movies, The Graduate, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Rocky and Annie Hall.\n\nHe left to found Orion with a senior management grouping in 1975 and became Chairman of International, helping lead Orion to become a successful independent releasing Woody Allen films, 10, Terminator and Platoon, and winning four Best Picture Academy Awards.\n\nGoldschmidt left Orion in 1988 to form his own production and distribution company Sovereign Pictures.
