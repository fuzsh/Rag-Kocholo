        "text": "This article originally appeared in the November 2008 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\nWoody Allen, who was born in Brooklyn before you could buy organic quinoa there, has made more than 40 films of remarkable quality since 1965. Then there are his other pastimes: fiction, playwriting, acting and music. (He still plays clarinet in a jazz combo once a week, at Café Carlyle.) Fans may confuse him with the neurotic smarty-pants he has often impersonated, and Allen is New York smartness—tart, stinging, a little wounded—incarnate. But for all his inner conflict and modernity, the man has got to be Anthony Trollope in disguise.\n\nAny Victorian workhorse of the sort who polishes off a magnum opus after breakfast, then starts another before dinner, would approve of the way that Allen has arranged his domestic life: with an impeccable housekeeper; a French chef; and order and quiet. Allen, his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, and their two young daughters recently downsized, moving from an immense pile in Carnegie Hill to one of Manhattan’s loveliest side streets, a little farther south, in a neighborhood that is too luxurious to be called bohemian, yet too singular to feel bourgeois. “It’s very hard to find just the right house, which for us was old and full of original detail, on a beautiful block and with a pretty little garden,” Previn says. “Fortunately, after two years of searching, this gem turned up.”\n\nAllen had always admired this street, the same block where he shot some scenes for Annie Hall more than 30 years ago. His new place is at least a century old and grandly proportioned, but it may not feel that way, as the family cheerfully gave up about half their former square footage. Allen now works in a frugal corner of the master bedroom. Between the windows is an old turntable on which he plays his beloved LPs. A well-thumbed Webster’s Second sits open on a stand next to the fireplace, not far from a sampler stitched in 1805 by a wise maiden named Hannah Burton. The desk and chair are both monkish, and Allen types his screenplays and fiction on the 1951 Olympia portable that he’s had since he went to Midwood High School. (Considering how prolific he is, one has to wonder where he finds replacement ribbons.) Stephen Shadley, the Allens’ designer, points to the hooked rug—a piece of vintage Americana—on the wall that Allen stares at day in and out. “It’s a metaphor for Woody’s mind,” he says. The subject is a beehive.\n\nShadley was introduced to Allen by their mutual friend Diane Keaton. “I always want-ed to be an animator,” the designer says, “and in some ways, that was my role on this project.” He helped the couple to consolidate their furnishings and collections (one would never suspect that they have not been living at this address, amid these belongings, for a lifetime). He also helped them integrate the art and antiques that survived their triage with fresh but traditional wall and upholstery fabrics. “The important thing for us,” says Allen, “was that the house would be completely comfortable, and that even when it’s messy it looks great. I love the fact that the bedroom is very bright and sunny, quiet and with a fireplace, because I do all of my work in the bedroom.” Allen has a penchant for faded damask, girlish florals, dainty quilting and sprig linen. Indeed, nearly everything he has collected over the years (the odd modern canvas by Ed Ruscha or Robert Rauschenberg is an exception) has a subtext of innocence—or of a nostalgia for innocence: painted signs, rocking chairs, samplers, doorstops (one in the shape of Chaplin’s Little Tramp), folk art, found art and defiantly unfashionable braided rugs and “brown” antiques with a rustic patina.\n\n1 / 8\n\nShadley is a man whose manners are as untheatrical and discreet as the décor that he helped the couple to orchestrate. “It’s a little hard to define,” he admits, “because, like everything Woody does, it’s so idiosyncratic. There are very few directors as conscious as he is of the way that an interior becomes a narrative. When we were pushing the furniture around, he would stand at a little distance, sizing the room up, as if he were framing a shot. Getting the color right obsesses him. ‘I love the warmth of reds and yellows,’ he told me. You can see that in his cinematography, so the only cool space we did was the blue dining room. Maybe you could call the mood, with its rich patterns and dark wood, but its austere character, neo-Jacobean.” Previn’s taste, he adds, is naturally lighter and more youthful. “Though she defers to Woody most of the time, her private space in the house is a perfectly uncluttered cream study. I’ll never forget her expression as she watched us like two mad carpet dealers layering rugs in the entrance foyer—the pileup was getting out of hand.” (One of Woody Allen’s incarnations, it seems, is Woody Aladdin.)\n\nWhatever you choose to call the Shadley/Allen style, more work went into its homey nonchalance than meets the eye. “The period detail of the house was intact,” Shadley says, “but we reconfigured the basement for a professional kitchen and a gathering room with a big hearth. We upgraded the plumbing and electrical systems, adding a dumbwaiter that connects the kitchen to a new serving pantry off the dining room. A lot of energy went into hanging the art and designing the library.” If the owner of this house were anonymous, you would still recognize him as a passionate reader. A library that deserves the name is like a garden with deep roots that take decades to cultivate.\n\nAllen the artist is many things, among them an ironist and a rebel who knows how anarchic the instincts are. That is a theme of his latest film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, a tempestuous love quadrangle. And for all its old-fashioned virtue, his house is ironic, too. It leaves a net impression of terrific sophistication: the sophistication of self-knowledge, and the knowledge, above all, that none of us are what we seem.\n\nRelated: See More Celebrity Homes in AD"
