Mickey Rose was 77.\n\nHis daughter, Jennifer, tells the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1551DRw ) that he died Sunday from cancer at his home in Beverly Hills.\n\nRose and Allen met in high school in Brooklyn, N.Y., and became friends. They shared a love of playing jazz and baseball.\n\nRose met his late wife, Judy, through a blind date arranged by Allen.\n\nRose became a TV comedy writer. He wrote for Johnny Carson and Sid Caesar and for shows including “The Smothers Brothers,” ”All in the Family” and “The Odd Couple.”\n\nIn a statement, Allen says Rose was one of the funniest humans he’s known — and a “wonderful first baseman.”\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com"
