        "text": "Have you ever thought about what you will see after death? In Christianity, people believe in going to heaven or hell after death. In Buddhism, people believe in transmigration, which allows our souls go to another body without our memory. I do not believe in any religion, so I have no idea where we will go after death. However, no matter where will we go, I bet most people will regret something in their lives before they die. For example, we did not treasure the time with friends and family, try to finish some unachievable task or pursue our dream. In “Death Knocks”, Woody Allen distributes a different perspective on life and death, which makes me think deeply about life and death. The main character, Nat, is living as an old dress manufacturer in Brooklyn. One day, Death comes to find him and tell him Nat is dead. Nat does not believe that until he sees Death is almost break his neck climbing in the bedroom window. Unlike Death in a movie or religion, Allen gives us a new perspective on Death’s outlook. Death might look exactly same as us and we can talk, argue or negotiate with the Death, such as Nat requested “Nat: Give me some time. Another day” (Allen, P.1282). I have never thought about what Death looks like since I am a teenager and Death seems so far away from us. But when I am getting older, I will start to realize that Death is popping up in my life. Some strangers in my life disappear. Although I do not want to admit it, everyone will dead and that is the cycle"
