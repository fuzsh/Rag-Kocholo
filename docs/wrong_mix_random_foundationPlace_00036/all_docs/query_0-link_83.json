        "text": "There’s a scene toward the end of Café Society, the new Woody Allen movie that hits theaters today, in which a tangential character makes a quintessential Woody Allen observation. “Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living,” goes the setup. “But the examined one is no bargain.”\n\nIt’s tough to do the examining, and it’s tough to leave well enough alone: Café Society chooses to do neither. Allen litters his film with little autobiographical Easter eggs, but in the end he doesn’t reckon with what any of them actually mean. There’s a glibness to Café Society that’s very troubling given the seriousness of the allegations against Allen by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow. The movie taunts its audience with an insistent remorselessness regarding wildly age-inappropriate, boundary-defying love affairs.\n\nCafé Society unfolds like a rambling fever dream dreamed by Alvy Singer during Annie Hall’s prejudice-affirming sojourn in Los Angeles. It’s as if Alvy slipped on the pool deck at the party where he met Paul Simon, cracked his head, and hallucinated the sepia-toned plot to this movie.\n\nNaturally, Allen’s latest film opens at a pool party, this one populated by the crème de la crème of the golden age of Hollywood elite. Our host is Phil Stern (Steve Carell), “one of the town’s most high-powered agents,” who spends the movie’s first scene bragging that he’s awaiting a call from Ginger Rogers. Instead he gets a call from his sister Rose back home in the Bronx. She has a request: Look out for her son Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg), currently en route to Hollywood and eager to follow in his uncle’s footsteps to Tinseltown glory.\n\nIn disposition and looks, Bobby is like a very young Alvy (and, of course, a very young Woody Allen), though with stars in his eyes and not yet aware that he prefers Greenwich Village to Beverly Hills. First, he falls for the Nebraska-born Vonnie (Kristen Stewart), Uncle Phil’s fetching young secretary—perpetually dressed, as my colleague pointed out, in full Lolita regalia, right down to her bobby socks—and begins to woo her, unaware that she’s already embroiled in a torrid romance with her married, much older boss.\n\nSoon enough it comes to choosing, and Vonnie picks the avuncular, wealthy Phil and a life of glittery West Coast splendor. A dejected Bobby decamps to New York, a little older, much shrewder, and ready to take his hometown by storm with the help of his gangster brother Ben (Corey Stoll), who has big plans to break into the nightclub business. Soon enough, Bobby’s become the toast of New York City “café society,” the host at the club Les Tropiques, where “one could find the driest martinis and the most beautiful girls,” and wed to Veronica Hayes (Blake Lively), a breathy-voiced divorcée who favors Vanna White–style evening gowns and who, like Annie Hall, thinks Jews are kind of quaint and amusing.\n\nThen Vonnie resurfaces, and all the old feelings come rushing back. What ensues is a bouillabaisse of every cliché in the Woody Allen canon: Manhattan-style tributes to the romance of New York, Annie Hall levels of wistfulness for love that doesn’t quite work, and little sprinkles of the felonious high jinks of Manhattan Murder Mystery or Crimes and Misdemeanors. (Allen seems almost as interested in the antics and travails of the wider Dorfman clan as he is in Bobby’s bildungsroman.)\n\nIt seems to be a movie about marrying the wrong people, and to some degree about choosing the wrong city. But the plot of Café Society is sketchy and episodic enough that none of it lands with clarity. Predictable as Allen’s themes have by now become, there’s a certain meandering, nostalgic charm to this film that I could have enjoyed if I wasn’t repeatedly and rudely snapped back to reality by yet another reference to the director’s bizarre blind spot. I know we should all aspire to separate the art from the artist, but Allen, I have to say, makes it pretty freaking difficult.\n\nAs I mentioned, Vonnie is a Lolita-esque temptress whose coltish, virginal beauty is privileged over Veronica’s voluptuous, womanly charms (that they share a name also must mean something). “She’s much younger than me,” Uncle Phil confesses to Bobby at one point about his yet-unnamed mistress. “What is age, if you’re really in love?” Bobby generously declares. Later, after Phil and Vonnie are married and Vonnie and Bobby are fanning their never-quite-extinguished flame, Bobby takes a step back: “You decided to marry my uncle! Which makes you my aunt.”\n\nAt Les Tropiques, one older man regularly shows up with his underage fiancée, not uncommon, we’re told, in café society, and another couple might be ideal, but for the fact that the husband is sleeping with his wife’s sister. Hollywood behaves no better. “We adore Errol Flynn,” Vonnie crows at one point, then relates a story whose punch line concerns the actor’s fondness for very young girls.\n\nIs Allen being deliberately provocative, or does he not get that he’s being provocative? Does Café Society represent some misguided but good-faith attempt to examine his life and reputation, or is it just interested in poking fun at those who would demand he do so?"
