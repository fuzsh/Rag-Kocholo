        "text": "Anthony Hopkins and Naomi Watts as father and daughter in You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.\n\nThirty-three years after Annie Hall, Woody Allen is still riffing on the old joke he tells in the film's opening monologue, which leads him to his view on life—that it's \"full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly.\"\n\nDespite the buoyant jazz soundtrack and the unwavering comic energy, Allen's 42nd film, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, is perhaps the most somber film screening at Cannes. It's a throwback to his late 80s ensemble pieces, most akin to Hannah and Her Sisters, following two couples facing life's grimmest realities: failure for struggling novelist Roy and his baby-crazy wife Sally (Josh Brolin and Naomi Watts), mortality and loneliness for Sally's separated parents (Anthony Hopkins and Gemma Jones). Each character harbors their own evasive delusions. For Hopkins's aging Alfie, it's a gym membership and a trashy young golddigger (Lucy Punch). For the wife he abandons, Helen, it's whisky and a quack fortune teller who reads futures in regular playing cards. After failing to write anything that lives up to the promise of his first novel, Roy dreams of a new life with the woman across the street (Freida Pinto). Meanwhile, Sally, babyless in her late thirties and still cramped in a coldwater London flat her mother pays for, imagines an affair with her good-looking, charming boss (Antonio Banderas.) Hopes are built, then shattered, and the dreams that replace them are dashed in turn, and so on. To make his worldview clear, Allen bookends the movie with a certain line from Macbeth about sound and fury.\n\nToday's press conference for You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (a reference to both an illusory dream partner and the more certain encounter with the grim reaper) was, like the film, the funniest and the darkest at Cannes.\n\n\"I have a very grim, pessimistic view of [life],\" Allen said, with Punch, Brolin, Watts, and Jones at his side. \"I do think it's a grim, painful, nightmarish experience. I've felt this way since I was a little boy.\"\n\n(I again thought back to Annie Hall, specifically the scene where a young, six-year-old Alvy Singer tells his doctor of his weltschmerz: \"The universe is expanding, and if the universe is expanding, one day it'll break apart, and that'll be the end of everything.\")\n\n\"One must have one's delusions to live,\" Allen continued. \"If one looks at life too directly, it becomes unbearable to live.\" The room fell silent. Allen took a deadpan sip of coffee.\n\nWhen asked why he doesn't cast himself in his movies as frequently as he used to, Allen said he was too old, at 74, to be playing the romantic lead. \"It's no fun not playing the guy who gets the girl,\" he said. Allen described the torment of directing the likes of Scarlett Johansson and Naomi Watts and having younger actors end up with them in his movies. \"I like to be the guy who sits opposite [the girls] in the restaurant and lies to them.\"\n\nHe returned to the subject of aging a few minutes later. \"I find it a lousy deal,\" he said. \"There is no advantage in getting older. You don't get smarter, you don't get wiser, you don't get more mellow ... Your back gets sore, you eyesight gets worse ...\n\n\"I would advise you not to do it.\"\n\nA Brazilian journalist asked him if he would like to be directing when he is 100 years old, like Manoel de Oliveira.\n\n\"I don't want to reach 100 with an aluminum walker and dribbling. But if I can reach it like him,\" then yes.\n\n\"My relationship with death remains the same,\" he said. \"I'm strongly against it.\"\n\nMovies\n\nPaul Mescal vs. Pedro Pascal: A First Look at the Epic Gladiator II\n\nIn Ridley Scott’s sequel, a new generation of warriors clashes in a savage Rome: “It’s pretty gnarly.”\n\nHollywood\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine: Inside the Superhero Movie That Plays Rough\n\nRyan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and filmmaker Shawn Levy reveal how a ping-pong table sent by Blake Lively helped bring R-rated troublemaking to the MCU.\n\nMovies\n\nRosemary’s Baby Prequel Apartment 7A Aims to Raise Hell: A First Look\n\nJulia Garner and Dianne Wiest star in this follow-up to the 1968 thriller, centering a side character’s nightmarish untold story.\n\nTelevision\n\nHow Princess Diana’s Funeral Inspired House of the Dragon’s Somber Procession\n\nIt’s brother versus brother in “Rhaenyra the Cruel,” which sees Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk come to fatal blows.
