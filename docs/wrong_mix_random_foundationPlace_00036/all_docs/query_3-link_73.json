        "text": "An anthology of the late Norman Mailer’s writing that Random House allegedly had scheduled for his centennial in 2023, but backed off from, will be released by a publisher that has taken on such discarded works as Woody Allen’s memoir “Apropos of Nothing” and a Philip Roth biography written by Blake Bailey.\n\nDuring a tribute to her career at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), Penelope Cruz recalled the Betamax videotape store that opened in her neighborhood, in a suburb of Madrid, when she was a child and that made her discover cinema.\n\nFILE - Director Woody Allen attends a special screening of \"Wonder Wheel\" on Nov. 14, 2017, in New York. A docuseries about the relationship of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow and its fallout is coming to HBO. The four-part documentary series is titled \"Allen v. Farrow\" and will debut Feb. 21, 2021, on HBO. Allen and Previn didn't participate in the documentary, nor did Moses Farrow, the son of Allen and Mia Farrow. “Allen v. Farrow,” from filmmakers Kirby Dick, Amy Ziering and Amy Herdy, will debut Feb. 21 on HBO, with episodes airing weekly.\n\nThis image released by Syfy shows Alan Tudyk as Harry Vanderspeigle in a scene from the new series \"Resident Alien,\" premiering Wednesday on Syfy. — AP Film Writer Jake CoyleMUSIC— iHeartRadio’s fifth annual ALTer EGO show dedicated to contemporary rock artists starring Billie Eilish, Foo Fighters and Coldplay will air virtually on Thursday night. — British singer-songwriter Arlo Parks is having a breakthrough, and she can count former first lady Michelle Obama as a fan. — If a wacky sci-fi series sounds appealing, check out “Resident Alien.” Alan Tudyk plays Harry, masquerading as a small-town doctor — and a human — after crash-landing on Earth. Based on the comic book series of the same name, “Resident Alien” debuts 10 p.m. EST Wednesday on SyFy.\n\n(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File)NEW YORK – Book publishing in 2020 was a story of how much an industry can change and how much it can, or wants to, remain the same. To its benefit and to its dismay, publishing was drawn into the events of the moment. Penguin Random House, among other initiatives, asked all employees to read Ibram X. Kendi’s “How To Be an Anti-Racist.” Kendi later presided over a company town hall. Macmillan CEO Don Weisberg, who cited a wide range of diversity programs at the publishing house that began before “American Dirt,” said he “understands the skepticism.\" The CEO of Penguin Random House U.S., Madeline McIntosh, noted how well book publishing could meet the public's needs during the pandemic and other events of 2020.\n\nNEW YORK – One of publishing's most thriving genres of the past four years, books about President Donald Trump, is not going to end when he leaves office. In 2021 and beyond, look for waves of releases about the Trump administration and about the president's loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden. “But there are tens of millions of Americans who look to the Trump presidency as an important time and are fans of his administration. Center Street, a Hachette Book Group imprint, has published Donald Trump Jr., Newt Gingrich and Judge Jeanine Pirro among others. Any publisher signing with Trump or a top administration official might face the anger not just of Trump critics among the general public, but from within the industry.\n\nNEW YORK Michael Cohen's memoir about President Donald Trump will be released Sept. 8 by Skyhorse Publishing, which confirmed the news Thursday to The Associated Press. It is a story that you havent read in newspapers, or on social media, or watched on television. Cohen is completing the last two years of a three-year prison sentence at home after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress. He has said that Trump directed him to make the payments. Skyhorse has a history of taking on books by controversial public figures, including a memoir this spring by Woody Allen that had been dropped by Hachette Book Group.\n\nFILE - In this April 10, 2014, file photo, actor Nick Cordero attends the after-party for the opening night of \"Bullets Over Broadway\" in New York.

Arcade Publishing announced Thursday that Keillor's The Lake Wobegon Virus, which continues his popular Lake Wobegon series and ties it to the current pandemic, is coming Sept. 8. \"The people of Lake Wobegon were waiting for the chance to go wild and so the book wrote itself.\n\nNEW YORK After voicing support for Woody Allen and criticizing cancel culture, Spike Lee apologized Saturday for words he said were wrong.In an interview Friday on the New York radio station WOR 710, Lee called Allen a great, great filmmaker.This cancel thing is not just Woody.

Earlier this year, he released a memoir through Arcade Publishing after his original publisher, Hachette Book Group, dropped the book amid widespread criticism. Lee's latest film, the Vietnam War drama Da 5 Bloods, debuted Friday on Netflix.\n\n\"It is with a broken heart and with infinite sadness that we have the extreme pain of announcing the departure of Max von Sydow,” Diamond said. In 1980, von Sydow starred as the evil emperor Ming the Merciless in \"Flash Gordon.\" He was baptized Carl Adolf von Sydow, but later changed his first name to Max. “I’m very grateful to the schooling I had in Sweden because in order to learn acting you have to work, work, work,” he said. Von Sydow married Swedish actress Christina Olin in 1951 and had two sons, Clas and Henrik."
