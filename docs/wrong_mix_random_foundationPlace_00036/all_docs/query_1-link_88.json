Even his lesser movies like Anything Else are fun and watchable.\n\nI just saw Cafe Society tonight and it was great, wonderfully written and cast. I saw Another Woman a few weeks ago and that was one of my favorites--very Bergman-esque. Wonder Wheel was great--loved the setting on Coney Island, Justin Timberlake and Kate Winslet were superb.\n\nSome of his movies I haven't seen in years, so I'm going over all of them again, about one a week.\n\nI love so many of his more modern films, despite what a creep the dude is. Match Point is a major highlight. ScarJo is at peak sexiness in that one too. Vicky Cristy Barcelona was excellent and gorgeously shot on location, like most of his newer movies were. I saw pretty much every movie he's put out since then except for these last two. I liked each one. I enjoy how most of this newer stuff from him is simple light fare, and serves as a nice contrast to most other stuff that appeals to me in film.\n\nI'm that weird guy who just doesn't get his sense of humor. The off-putting nature of his movies has nothing to do with his personal life for me, but maybe like so many other things it'll just click with me at some point. I honestly haven't seen enough. I've seen Deconstructing Harry, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Love & Death, and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex. People say I need to see Annie Hall\n\nIf there's a better recommendation?"
