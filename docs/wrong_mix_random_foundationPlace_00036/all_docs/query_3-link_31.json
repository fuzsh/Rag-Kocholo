        "text": "Woody Allen's longtime collaborator and school friend, Mickey Rose, has died of colon cancer at the age of 77.\n\nRose met Allen in art class at Midwood High School when Woody was still known by his birth name, Allan Konigsberg.\n\nThey became close friends, attending baseball and even playing in a jazz band together. Allen introduced Rose to his future wife, Judy Wolf, and was his best man at their wedding.\n\nDespite the pair planning to open a drugstore together, they both entered the world of TV and film, with Rose co-writing scripts for Allen's early hits such as 'What's Up Tiger Lily?' (1966), 'Take The Money and Run' (1969) and 'Bananas' (1971).\n\nMickey went on to have a successful career as a TV comedy writer, working on the Tonight Show for Johnny Carson. Carson called him “a comedy writer’s comedy writer.”\n\n“Mickey was one of the funniest humans I know, a true original and a total eccentric and a wonderful first baseman,” said Allen this week in a statement released by his biographer."
