        "text": "It turns out that Chandler Bing was a fan of “Annie Hall.”\n\nFive months after Matthew Perry’s death in October 2023 at age 54, details have been revealed about the late “Friends” star’s will.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by Page Six on Monday, Perry named Lisa Ferguson and Robin Ruzan to be co-executors of his $1 million estate in his Alvy Singer Living Trust, which he named after Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall” character.\n\nThe 1977 movie follows Alvy (Allen), a neurotic comedian who tries to figure out why his relationship with Annie (Diane Keaton) ended, and he spends time questioning the nature of love. The movie has a bittersweet ending, as the former couple meet again after they’ve both moved on. But, despite his failures, Alvy remains invested in the idea that love is “essential.”\n\nIn the declaration, which was created in 2009, Perry listed his father, John Perry, and mother, Suzanne Morrison, as beneficiaries of his will alongside his half-sibling, Caitlin Morrison, and ex-girlfriend Rachel Dunn.\n\nThe late actor never married or had any children of his own, but he came from a large Canadian-American family. He’s survived by his siblings, parents and his famous stepfather, Canadian broadcaster Keith Morrison, 76, best known for “Dateline.”\n\nA former journalist, Perry’s mom Suzanne served as press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau before pivoting to political consulting and fund-raising.\n\nHis father, 82, is also an actor. He has appeared in “George of the Jungle,” “The Sweetest Thing,” “Independence Day,” and even appeared on “Friends” in 1998 (in the Season 4 episode, “The One With Rachel’s New Dress”).\n\nIn his 2022 memoir, “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,” Perry described himself as a “latchkey kid” who split his time between Montreal and Los Angeles, where each of his divorced parents lived.\n\n“I spent a great deal of time alone,” he wrote.\n\nHis sister Caitlin, 43, is Suzanne and Keith Morrison’s first daughter, born in 1981.\n\nIn his book, Perry wrote, “I have always loved kids. I think it’s because I was 10 years old when my sister Caitlin was born.”\n\n“Then came Emily, then Will, and then finally Madeline. I loved playing with them all, babysitting them, playing dumb games with them. There is no greater sound on the face of the planet than a child’s laughter.”\n\nHowever, although he loved his siblings, Perry also said, “There was a family growing up around me, a family I didn’t really feel part of … That’s when the bad behavior started,” he wrote, referring to his lifelong struggles with addiction and sobriety.\n\nCaitlin appeared in the star’s 2000 movie “The Whole Ten Yards,” but has not otherwise had an acting career.\n\nDunn dated Matthew from 2003 to 2005. In his book, he called her, “the ex-girlfriend of his dream.”\n\nAccording to the filing, Perry held $1,030,000 in personal property “not limited to jewelry, furniture and furnishings, works of art and automobiles.”\n\nFerguson will appear in Los Angeles Superior courtroom solo on April 10 for a hearing of the will. Ruzan, who was an executive producer on the TV series “Celebrity Liar,” which Perry made a guest appearance on in 2010, opted out of co-executing the trust on March 4.\n\nPerry was found dead at his Los Angeles home on Oct. 28, 2023.\n\nThe actor, who was propelled to global stardom after landing the role of funnyman Chandler Bing on the hit sitcom from 1994 to 2004, was found unresponsive in his hot tub.\n\nAn autopsy determined that he died from “acute effects of ketamine,” with contributing factors listed as “drowning, coronary artery disease and buprenorphine effects.”\n\nFollowing his death, friends announced they would be establishing the Matthew Perry Foundation, which will aid those battling substance abuse.\n\n“The Matthew Perry Foundation is the realization of Matthew’s enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction,” the organization’s founders said in a statement to “Entertainment Tonight.”\n\nHis “Friends” co-stars — Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Jennifer Aniston — attended the private funeral when he was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Church of the Hills in LA on Nov. 3.\n\nAll of them also paid tribute to him in social media posts.\n\nLeBlanc, 56, who co-starred as Joey Tribbiani, had the most lighthearted tribute, starting with a sincere, “The times we had together are honestly among the favorite times of my life. It was an honor to share the stage with you and to call you my friend….” but ending with a joke, “I guess you’re keeping the 20 bucks you owe me.”\n\nAniston, 55, who co-starred as Rachel Green, had the longest and most heartfelt tribute, writing, “Oh boy this one has cut deep… Having to say goodbye to our Matty has been an insane wave of emotions that I’ve never experienced before.”\n\nShe added, “We loved him deeply. He was such a part of our DNA….I know you are now completely at peace and out of any pain. I talk to you every day… sometimes I can almost hear you saying ‘could you BE any crazier?’ Rest little brother. You always made my day.”"
