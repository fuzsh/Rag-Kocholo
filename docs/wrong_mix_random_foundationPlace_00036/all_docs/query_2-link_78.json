        "text": "Tisa Farrow died due to cardiopulmonary demise, according to the Vermont Department of Health.\n\nFarrow, an actress who starred in several films in the '70s and made a cameo in Woody Allen's 1979 film \"Manhattan,\" died after her heart and lungs stopped working, according to Ben Truman, the public health communication officer for the state department. The manner of death was likely atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries, Truman said.\n\nHer sister, actress Mia Farrow, announced the news in an Instagram post last Thursday that her sister \"died unexpectedly,\" \"apparently in her sleep\" died Wednesday morning.\n\n\"If there is a Heaven, undoubtedly my beautiful sister Tisa is being welcomed there. She was the best of us - (I) have never met a more generous and loving person. She loved life & never complained. Ever,\" Farrow wrote in the caption of a younger photo of her sister.\n\nFarrow shared that her sister \"was a nurse for 27 years\" and \"a wonderful sister\" as well as a \"devoted mother.\" Her son, Army Sgt. First Class Jason F. Dene, died at age 37 while serving in Iraq in 2008. \"This is a hard time for all of us who admire and love her so deeply,\" she added.\n\nHer brother, John Charles Villiers-Farrow, told The Hollywood Reporter that Tisa Farrow died in Rutland, Vermont.\n\nTheresa Magdalena Farrow was born in 1951 to Australian film director John Farrow and actress Maureen O'Sullivan and was one of seven siblings.\n\nShe made her film debut in 1970's \"Homer,\" directed by John Trent, and starred opposite Don Scardino, according to her IMDb page. She went on to act in 1976's \"Strange Shadows in an Empty Room\" and 1979's \"Zombie\" (1979). One of her biggest roles was as Harvey Keitel's love interest, Carol, in James Toback's 1978 crime drama \"Fingers.\"\n\nShe also appeared in the 2021 four-part HBO docuseries, \"Allen v. Farrow,\" which explores Woody Allen and Mia Farrowâ€™s well-publicized relationship and its fallout, as well as Dylan Farrow's childhood sexual abuse allegations against the prolific director, who has long denied her accusations.\n\nTisa Farrow said in an interview for the miniseries that she witnessed Allen \"suggestively\" applying sunscreen on his adoptive daughter when Dylan Farrow was a child, according to The New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhat is atherosclerosis?\n\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, atherosclerosis is \"the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls.\" The buildup is a plaque that can cause arteries to narrow which blocks blood flow. The plaque can also burst and cause a blood clot.\n\nRisk factors include a family history of early heart disease, an unhealthy diet, diabetes, high blood pressure, high chloesterol, lack of exercise, sleep apnea, obesity and smoking and tobacco use."
