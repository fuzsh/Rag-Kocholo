        "text": "You are making a film a year. What drives you?\n\nIt’s not a big deal. There have been times when Sidney Lumet or Bergman have done three films in a year. It takes me a couple of months to write a film, several months to shoot and edit it.\n\nA guy who drives a cab or works in an office works more than I do. I have time to practice my clarinet, see films, go out to dinner and see people. And my work doesn’t have the sense of labor about it.\n\nBut if I worked at a different job, I couldn’t wait until I got home to write. I enjoy it. It’s like being paid to play baseball or something. It’s like I’m on a constant vacation.\n\nThis doesn’t sound like Woody Allen talking at all, actually enjoying yourself. Normally you are portrayed as a basically neurotic, workaholic, tormented — shall I go on? — recluse who is incapable of enjoying yourself. Is this something new?\n\nProbably the truth about me lies somewhere in between. Writers have tended to . . . emphasize certain characteristics because it makes good copy.\n\nI’m being paid to do what I like. And that is essentially to write and occasionally perform. I do have some trouble with my nonwork time, that is true. I’m not a person who gets too much of a kick out of traveling, country houses, boats, vacations or things most people do have a good time with.\n\nSo you’re happier when you’re working.\n\nYes, it’s an important distraction. I’ve always felt if one can arrange one’s life so that one can obsess about small things, it keeps you from obsessing about the really big things. If you obsess about the big things, you are impotent and frightened, because there’s nothing you can do about aging and death. But the little things you can spend days obsessing about, such as a good punch line for the third act. And this is a nice problem to obsess over because it’s not surgery. . . . I’m a little more morbid than the average person.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nDo you envy the guy who goes to work and goes out on his boat and drinks beer, and all this stuff never occurs to him?\n\nNo. I do occasionally envy the person who is religious naturally, without being brainwashed into it or suckered into it by all the organized hustles. Just like having an ear for music or something. It would just never occur to such a person for a second that the world isn’t about something.\n\nAnd I wouldn’t go out in a boat. I’d hate the boat. I’ve been out on a boat twice and I got seasick and sunburned and windburned and I was trapped. That would be hell for me.\n\nAre you agnostic?\n\nAgnostic — I mean, I know as little about it as anyone, you know?\n\nYou seem to be approaching your work in a more relaxed manner.\n\nI think as the years go by, and you gain more confidence, you become more secure about it. My first couple of films, I would have been more frantic and nervous.\n\nDo you ever worry that you are doing things because they are easier and that the film will suffer a bit?\n\nI’m aware that I’m doing it because it’s easy. I mean, I’m completely aware that I’m shooting in New York because it’s easy.\n\nBut maybe the finished product is worse because you take it easy. Is that a concern?\n\nYes, I do think it. And I’m happy to go along with it, even though it’s worse. I think, “This may be worse, but it’s easy.”\n\nI can’t make that — doing things the easy way — fit with your continuing to work so hard and make so many films.\n\nI do say to myself, you know, “This scene would be much better if we went to, say, Philadelphia to shoot it.” But I don’t really want to go to Philadelphia to shoot it, because it’s a two-hour car ride. So let’s find a street downtown that we can fob off as Philadelphia, and it won’t be as good. I won’t have the vista. I won’t make a great shot of the Liberty Bell or something.\n\nBut you are trying to make great films, are you not?\n\nI’m trying to make as wonderful a film as I can. But my priorities are always in order, and they’re never artistic. Artistic accomplishment is about third or fourth.\n\nI’m not sure I buy that.\n\nI swear.\n\nBut you are such a perfectionist. You pay such close attention to every detail. There is a story about an extra in Radio Days wearing a 1940s-style garter, even though it won’t show onscreen.\n\nStill, I wouldn’t put making a film above inconveniencing myself where I shot it or an important engagement or appointment.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat’s more important?\n\nOh, for instance, I’ve wrapped films early in the day so I could get home in time to see a Knicks game on television. Sure. They’ll say, “But there are two more hours of light.”\n\nIt sounds like the obstetrician who induces labor so he can make his tee time on the golf course. Is that an important Knicks game you’re talking about or just any Knicks game?\n\nImportant. There have been times when I’d be out with a beautiful woman, and I would think to myself, “Do I really want to stay up all night, till four in the morning?” Because I’ve got to go in at six o’clock in the morning and shoot the next day.\n\nAnd I think of my priorities. I think, “What’s more important?” The time spent with the beautiful woman is much more important to me than the other time — being on top of it the next day."
