        "text": "Justin Timberlake has come under fire on social media after tweeting his support for Time's Up, a newly formed coalition of more than 300 women in the entertainment industry advocating for gender parity in Hollywood and beyond. The reason? Timberlake stars in the new film Wonder Wheel, directed by alleged sexual abuser Woody Allen. (Allen has been accused of sexual abuse by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow.)\n\nTimberlake sent the tweet in question ahead of arriving at the Golden Globes with wife Jessica Biel, who was nominated for Best Actress in a Mini-Series or TV Movie for her work in The Sinner. \"Here we come!! And DAMN, my wife is hot!\" he wrote, adding the hashtags \"#TIMESUP\" and \"#whywewearblack.\" Timberlake and Biel both adhered to the event's unofficial black dress code, intended to highlight gender inequity and sexual misconduct; Timberlake also accessorized with a \"Time's Up\" pin.\n\nTwitter users quickly pointed out that Timberlake's apparent support for survivors seemed at odds with his willingness to work with Allen."
