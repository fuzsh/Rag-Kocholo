        "text": "Friends star Matthew Perry dies aged 54\n\nDetails of Matthew Perry's will have finally been revealed, showing he left more than $1 million (£780,850) in a trust he set up and named after a Woody Allen character.\n\nThe late Friends star, who died at the age of 54 from the acute effects of ketamine, created his will in 2009 and stated he wished to leave \"a majority of his belongings to a trust\".\n\nMatthew created the Alvy Singer Living Trust, which he named after Woody Allen's Annie Hall character.\n\nAccording to court documents, Matthew's personal property was valued at a \"little over $1 million\".\n\nLisa Ferguson and Robin Ruzan are listed as co-executors of the will.\n\nRead more: Oscars fans in tears at Matthew Perry tribute during In Memoriam after ex's plea\n\nMatthew listed his father John Perry and mother Suzanne Morrison as beneficiaries of his will, according to court documents obtained by Page Six.\n\nThe actor's half-sibling Caitlin Morrison and ex-girlfriend Rachel Dunn are also said to be beneficiaries.\n\nWhen Matthew created his will in 2009, he indicated any children he had would not be \"explicitly entitled\" to his fortune. The star died without ever having any children.\n\nAccording to the documents, Matthew had $1,030,000 (£804,000) in personal property \"not limited to jewellery, furniture and furnishings, works of art and automobiles.\"\n\nDon't miss...\n\nElton John's luxurious wardrobe at Oscars afterparty included £1,000 slippers [INSIGHT]\n\nJohn Cena's tiny underwear for Oscars streak exposed by behind-the-scenes pics [PHOTOS]\n\nOscar winner Emma Stone seemingly calls Kimmel expletive after Poor Things dig [COMMENT]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nOn 28th October 2023, Matthew was discovered dead in his house in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. He was found by his assistant, underwater in his hot tub.\n\nAttempts were made to get him out of the water before the ambulance services arrived, but he was sadly pronounced dead at his home.\n\nThe official report confirmed that there were no illegal drugs at the location of his death. The coroner's findings revealed: \"Contributing factors in Mr. Perry's death include drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of buprenorphine (used to treat opioid use disorder).\"\n\nIt went on to say: \"At the high levels of ketamine found in his postmortem blood specimens, the main lethal effects would be from both cardiovascular overstimulation and respiratory depression.\"\n\nThe medical examiner mentioned that Matthew probably \"lapsed into unconsciousness\" which led to his drowning. There were no physical injuries on his body and all signs suggest that no foul play was involved.\n\nIn the wake of this sad event, Friends stars Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow made a heartfelt statement: \"We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew.\n\n\"We were more than just castmates. We are a family. There is so much to say, but right now we're going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss.\"\n\nAn AI tool was used to bring an extra layer to this story."
