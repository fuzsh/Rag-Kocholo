        "text": "It doesn't matter how many times Woody Allen tells us we're dead wrong _ and he has done so for 30 years. We will always think of him as Alvy Singer of Annie Hall, Isaac of Manhattan, Sandy Bates of Stardust Memories, and every other character he pretends to be in his movies. How can we conclude otherwise, especially when he appears in front of the camera, dressed in exactly the same clothes he wears every day of his life, talking about himself in exactly the same way, quoting Kierkegaard or Groucho Marx, and quipping quotable joke after joke about neuroticism, women, sex, death _ all the well-known Allen topics?\n\nSo the inevitable question with Deconstructing Harry, which opened last week, is yet again: What is the connection between Allen's comic persona and his real-life identity?\n\n\"I think this is true for all comedians on the screen,\" says Allen. \"I mean if you see all the Chaplin films, and the Keaton films, there is a persona that emerges. You live your life, you do your films, and people deconstruct it for you. It's not something that you do consciously.\"\n\nLet's deconstruct for a minute. Harry (played by Allen) is a hard-drinking, profane writer who writes blatantly about the people in his life, barely disguising their identities. The street expression for oral sex is used often. There's a sexually explicit scene between Richard Benjamin and Julia Louis-Dreyfus at the beginning, and we're supposed to get warm and fuzzy about Harry's relationship with a hooker. And Woody Allen _ or his comic persona _ talks, well, dirtier than we've ever seen before.\n\nHas he evolved into a dirty old man? After all, his character became close friends with a prostitute in Mighty Aphrodite. And the sexual jokes in there were strikingly colorful. What would Allen say to audiences who followed him from the early days, who'll walk into Deconstructing Harry and find him swearing like a sailor?\n\n\"I would say, \"Don't go,' \" says Allen, who has said in numerous interviews that he doesn't pay much heed to public opinion. \"My last movie (Everyone Says I Love You) was a very sweet film with no profanity in it. It doesn't mean any kind of trend. \"Harry' has got this, but it doesn't mean the next picture will.\"\n\nThere is more to Harry than profanity, of course. It happens to be very funny, with some of the surrealistic touches that graced Allen's early writing for the New Yorker. But on a recent evening, as New Yorkers stand three and four deep in serpentine lines in front of nearby Saks Fifth Avenue, Allen finds himself _ once again _ addressing nagging questions about personal connections to his work. And then there's the other inevitable round of interrogation, the one that has to do with his public image _ tarnished by his heavily publicized custody battles with Mia Farrow, and his five-year relationship with Soon-Yi Previn, whom he married last month in Venice.\n\nBecause of his private nature, and a work ethic that keeps him behind closed doors, Allen's finer qualities _ which many can attest to _ remain obscured by the controversy. He appears to be completely uninterested in spin control. Do we read about his lasting friendships with former lovers and wives, such as Diane Keaton or Louise Lasser? Do we hear from his inner circle, actor Tony Roberts, Dick Cavett or Allen's manager, Jack Rollins, all of whom attest to an Allen quite different from the public's image of late? Rarely, if at all.\n\nCritics and moviegoers have begun, in recent years, to study Allen's films through an increasingly cynical prism. What is Allen really saying? Does this character represent Farrow? Is the 20-year-old student whom Allen's character falls for in Husbands and Wives supposed to be Soon-Yi? And given Allen's loss of child custody in real life, what are we to make of Deconstructing Harry, in which Harry kidnaps his son against his ex-wife's wishes, only to be arrested by police with his ex-wife screaming blue murder? Isn't Woody Allen (or Allen Stewart Konigsberg, as he was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Dec. 1, 1935) somewhat connected to Harry? Or is Harry a satirical trash can for everything we have ever said about or ascribed to him?\n\n\"It's not as romantic as that,\" says Allen, who listens intensely and indulgently to questions before answering. \"I had an idea that I thought was funny, about a social misfit ... and you get to know this person through what he writes. ... I thought that would be a funny idea for a movie, and the more profligate I made the character, the more interesting (it became), it seemed to me, and the more room for humor. But I had no other thoughts about it beyond that. If a funny murder mystery had occurred to me, I would have written that.\"\n\nIt's hard, sometimes, to remember that Allen isn't just the guy who scandalized the world by leaving Farrow for her adopted daughter Previn, then 21; that he's more than the hopeless father who beat back Farrow's charges of child molestation but lost their three children (two adopted, one biological) in a custody battle.\n\nThis is Woody Allen, for crying out loud. For a whole generation _ the one whose kids now sit dazed and confused before MTV videos _ Allen was the thinking person's comic Everyman, the famously bespectacled chronicler of things existential, ironic, absurd and surreal. An autodidact, he could pull Nietzsche out of his grab bag of references, then just as effortlessly jump to the New York Knicks.\n\nWoody Allen was the patron nerd of neurotics, grown-up bed-wetters and anyone who had ever so much as expressed misgivings about this whole life thing.\n\nAnd from his lips came more great one-liners than Bob Hope and Will Rogers combined.\n\n\"It's not that I'm afraid to die,\" he once wrote. \"I just don't want to be there when it happens.\"\n\nHe's still alive, very much so. Most celebrities look like duller, smaller versions of themselves when you meet them. Allen, who suggests a living, breathing _ if very sober _ cartoon, looks exactly like himself.\n\nHe's still wearing the trademark uniform _ sweater, white shirt and unattractive slacks. The eyebrows continue to float in the air above his glasses. And his comic diction is still there _ the clearing of the throat just before the punch line; the way the t's and k's at the ends of his words sound like racquetballs smacking against the wall.\n\nHe's a little more frail these days, and there's some hair loss. He turned 62 on one of the Monday nights that he always spends at Michael's pub playing clarinet. That's the gig he has played without fail every week since 1969, even when his film Annie Hall practically swept the Oscars in 1978.\n\nHe has a slight handshake that would barely crease a Kleenex. He seems fuzzy at the edges, mostly because of the dim light in this Upper West Side hotel's hospitality suite. But the illusion is eerily reminiscent of one of his funnier gags in Deconstructing Harry in which two characters (Allen and Robin Williams) discover they have become _ literally _ out of focus.\n\nThe Williams character comes home, his face obscured in fuzziness. His wife is appalled. His little son taunts him: \"Daddy's out of focus, Daddy's out of focus.\"\n\nAllen may have lost some fans, although his movies traditionally never make big money. But even in the worst of his films, he never loses his humor or his sharp edges. And he remains a workaholic.\n\nAs a writer, director and actor, he has made approximately 30 movies at the phenomenal rate of about one per year. Even through the custody battles, he wrote five films and one play, writing (as always) in the upstairs guest bedroom of his Fifth Avenue penthouse duplex.\n\nIt is one of the most incredible runs in the movies. His career, which began with some of the funniest written pieces in the New Yorker since the work of S.J. Perelman and Robert Benchley (two of Allen's many idols) and his irresistible stand-up comedy in the early 1960s, broke through to the screen with 1965's What's New, Pussycat? which he wrote and appeared in.\n\nAfter that came the deluge. There was the so-called \"earlier, funny\" period (a line that Allen wrote into Stardust Memories) in the 1970s, with Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Play It Again, Sam and Love and Death. There were self-consciously Bergmanesque pieces, such as Interiors and September. There were the Woody-as-Fellini films, such as Stardust Memories (Allen's 8{) and Radio Days. And there was the sublime Manhattan, which began: \" \"Chapter 1: He was as tough and romantic as the town he loved.' \"\n\nThey kept coming, Hannah and Her Sisters and his recent great run of Husbands and Wives, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Bullets Over Broadway and Everyone Says I Love You. (The less said about Mighty Aphrodite, another hooker-heavy saga, the better.) They don't stop, which may be the problem. Allen, who rarely thinks much of his work _ the exceptions are Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo and Husbands and Wives _ keeps moving on, almost feverishly, to the next project.\n\n\"For me, Harry is now ancient history. I'll probably never see it again. Tennessee Williams, years ago, said, \"It's a pity, with plays, you have to put them on. It's too bad you can't just write them and throw them in the drawer,' because when you write the thing, he was saying, you transcend it.\"\n\nHe moves on, without his children anywhere in sight, apart from the now out-of-date pictures of them on his walls. After the trials of the 1990s, Allen was denied visitation rights with Dylan and Moses, his adopted children with Farrow. Although he was granted restricted, monitored access to Satchel, his biological son, he says Farrow has stopped sending the child to him at all.\n\nHow did it come to this?\n\n\"Bad luck of the draw,\" says Allen, who says he spent $7-million on the legal proceedings. Still unable to see why he lost the public relations battle with Farrow, Allen maintains he had \"an overwhelming\" case in his favor but simply got the wrong judge. \"I lost before I began. ... I had everybody testify for me, the schoolteacher of the kids, the nanny that was there from the birth of the kids. The kids' shrinks. I had illustrious doctors come in, one after the other. Just everyone. And everything was thrown out. I could have gotten a judge that would have, a priori, been responsive to my position. And then anything Mia would have done would have fallen on deaf ears.\"\n\n\"This was the greatest irony that I could have confront me, this whole thing with Mia,\" says Rollins, Allen's manager of 31 years. \"I believe (Allen) is the most ethical person I've ever met in my life. I have never known anybody who is so _ I don't know _ I would say pathologically involved in making sure that he is in no way encroaching on another. ... The world just looks at this situation in this conventional way and I don't blame them because they have no other recourse except the apparent facts (as reported in the media) as they see them. It is quite different.\"\n\nAllen has given up the custody battles, but he hasn't given up the moral war. By the time Dylan and Satchel (whom Farrow has renamed Eliza and Seamus) are grown, he intends to produce a book or a documentary that champions his side of the story to \"tell them what was done to them in the name of domestic adjudication. And then the ball will be in their court.\"\n\nPerhaps, he adds, \"I'll have other children, and that is a possibility. You know, I've lived with Soon-Yi now for five years.\"\n\nDoes she want children?\n\n\"Yes, I think she would like that. She still has one more semester of school. But that is a possibility.\"\n\nAnd there will be more movies, so many more movies, starring characters who resemble people in his own life, but who shouldn't be confused with the real thing. Got that?"
