        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, California -- That Woody Allen series is finally coming to Amazon in September, the streaming service announced Sunday.\n\nTitled Crisis in Six Scenes, the six-part, half-hour series will debut on Sept. 30 as part of Amazon's newly announced \"Month of Comedy.\"\n\nAmazon executives announced the news at the platform's Television Critics Association presentation on Sunday morning.\n\nThe series \"takes place in the 1960s during turbulent times in the United States when a middle class suburban family is visited by a guest who turns their household completely upside down,\" according to a description provided by Amazon.\n\nThere was no panel scheduled for Allen's series at Amazon's TCA presentation. However, details for the series were revealed in a packet highlighting Amazon's slate of half-hour shows.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nThe series, written and directed by Allen, stars Allen, Miley Cyrus and Elaine May. Reoccurring guests include Rachel Brosnahan and John Magaro.\n\nErika Aronson serves as executive producer, while Helen Robin will produce.\n\nLast time Allen spoke about the series, he called it \"a catastrophic mistake for me.\"\n\n\"I’m struggling with it at home,\" he told reporters at The Cannes film festival while promoting The Irrational Man. \"I never should have gotten into it. I thought it was going to be easy. You do a movie and it’s a big long thing; to do six half-hours you’d think would be a cinch. But it’s not: it’s very, very hard.”\n\nAt that point in the process, Allen admitted he expected the show to be “a cosmic embarrassment.\""
