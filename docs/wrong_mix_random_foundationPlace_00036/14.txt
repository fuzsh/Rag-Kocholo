LOS ANGELES, Calif. – A childhood friend of Woody Allen who co-wrote his movies “Bananas” and “Take the Money and Run” has died. Mickey Rose was 77.

His daughter, Jennifer, tells the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1551DRw ) that he died Sunday from cancer at his home in Beverly Hills.

Rose and Allen met in high school in Brooklyn, N.Y., and became friends. They shared a love of playing jazz and baseball.

Rose met his late wife, Judy, through a blind date arranged by Allen.

Rose became a TV comedy writer. He wrote for Johnny Carson and Sid Caesar and for shows including “The Smothers Brothers,” ”All in the Family” and “The Odd Couple.”

In a statement, Allen says Rose was one of the funniest humans he’s known — and a “wonderful first baseman.”
