        "text": "The NFL season may be over, but the NBA season is still underway. The All-Star weekend starts Friday in Indiana.\n\nThe biggest change this year is that the All-Star Game on Sunday will go back to the original format of East vs. West, instead of two captains voting to select players to be on their team regardless of conference.\n\nThe headline of this year's weekend will be Boston Celtics' own Jaylen Brown competing in the Dunk Contest on Saturday. Brown will be the first all-star to compete in both the All-Star Game and Dunk Contest since DeAndre Jordan in 2017.
