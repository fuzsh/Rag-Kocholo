        "text": "The highly anticipated 2023 NBA draft is complete. The San Antonio Spurs have had little to think about since they won the NBA draft lottery in May.\n\nThe Spurs took France center and generational prospect Victor Wembanyama with the top overall pick.\n\nThere was no suspense or subterfuge involving the pick. Whoever won the draft lottery had Wembanyama No. 1 on the draft board.\n\nThe 7-foot, 4-inch phenom is on his way to play for Hall of Fame coach Gregg Popovich. Wembanyama should rejuvenate a franchise that won four NBA titles from 1999-2014 and that has a history of turning international players into stars and champions.\n\nTo no surprise, the French phenom is selected with the first overall pick, instantly making the San Antonio Spurs must-watch television. He dominated the court while playing in France’s top professional level, leading the league in points per game (21.6), rebounds (10.4) and blocks (3.0). At 7-foot-4, his athleticism, shot making and defensive prowess is something few have seen in the NBA, and executives believe it won’t be long before he’s one of the best players in the league.\n\nThe national freshman of the year brings length to Charlotte, and becomes another exciting young piece for the Hornets. Miller was a clear NBA talent in his lone season with the Crimson Tide, averaging 18.8 and 8.2 rebounds per game, while also showing some range from beyond the arc. Miller has the size to be disrupter on defense, but what’s going to be the key to his success is having a consistent shot. When Miller gets hot, it’s tough to stop, and he’ll complement LaMelo Bell well by playing on the wing.\n\nIf it weren’t for Wembanyama, Henderson had all the capabilities of being the first overall pick. The first player to sign with the G League Ignite for two seasons, Henderson is explosive with the ball and can shake off defenders at will. He averaged 16.1 points per game last season, and his midrange shooting is some of the best in the class. Another explosive guard may be what Damian Lillard needs to make the Trail Blazers a contender, as the backcourt becomes one of the most exciting in the league.\n\nOne half of the Thompson twins, Amen Thompson has insane size (6-foot-7) for someone so skilled with ballhandling and court vision. He has a great feel for the game and finding open guys, averaging 6.8 assists last season. But in the playoffs, Thompson turned it up a notch with 9.2 assists per game. Thompson can also drive into the paint with his explosiveness and is tough to defend on fastbreak opportunities. If Thompson can develop his midrange and 3-point shot, he could be one of the most dangerous point guards in the league. The Rockets are one of the youngest teams in the league, and Thompson could be bring Houston some long-needed success.\n\nThe other half of the Thompson twins, Ausar has fantastic size (6-foot-7) for a guard. But Thompson has freakish athleticism and can pretty much do anything asked of him on the offensive end. He can score, pass and rebound, and dominated as a two-time Overtime Elite Finals MVP. His explosiveness on the defensive end is also a plus; he can read passing lanes and his long frame allows him to disrupt any offensive flow. Like his brother, he can also develop a 3-point shot, but he’ll be a nice addition alongside the first overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft Cade Cunningham. The pick also makes the Thompsons the first set of brothers drafted in the same draft since Markieff and Marcus Morris in 2011. It is also the second time brothers have been drafted in top 5 in the common draft era, but first time in same draft. other time was Lonzo Ball in 2017 and Lamelo Ball in 2020.\n\nA big point guard, Black is a true floor general and has a great knack for finding open players in rhythm. Black is a pass-first guard but has a nice shooting touch that defenders will have to respect. He averaged 34.9 minutes a game for the Razorbacks, so his durability shouldn’t be a question, but he will need to gain some strength to handle some of the bigger defenders in the league. He’ll likely play alongside Cole Anthony, but he will become a favorite of Paolo Banchero.\n\nPlaying on the same team as Victor Wembanyama meant scouts galore and Coulibaly showed his worth. He averaged just give points in 18 minutes per game, but his improvement throughout the season skyrocketed him up draft boards. At 6-foot-7, 190 pounds, Coulibaly fits the build for a 3-and-D player many around the NBA continue to desire. He’ll take some time to develop but is a prospect who can pay off in the future.\n\n∎ NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed that the Wizards and Pacers completed a trade sending Bilal Coulibaly, the No. 7 pick, to Washington and No. 8 pick Jarace Walker to Indiana.\n\nSomeone who isn’t afraid on the defensive end, Jarace Walker has a solid frame with a long wingspan that can match up with anyone in the post and can be an instant rim protector. On the opposite end, the American Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year is a difficult matchup for any coaching staff to figure out, as he can overpower smaller defenders, run past bigger defenders, and knock down jump shots. Walker becomes the first top-10 pick out of Houston since Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon was taken with the No. 1 overall pick in 1984.\n\n∎ NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed that the Wizards and Pacers completed a trade sending Bilal Coulibaly, the No. 7 pick, to Washington and No. 8 pick Jarace Walker to Indiana.\n\nProbably the most unknown lottery prospect, Hendricks might be the most NBA-ready player other than Wembanyama as he becomes the first UCF player ever selected in the first round. He may look slim, but he was just as dominant as any big in college basketball last season, while being able to shoot wherever he wants. He led UCF in scoring (15.1 points per game) and rebounding (7.0 rebounds per game), while averaging an astounding 1.7 blocks per game. By being a dynamic scoring threat with the ability to guard any position, Hendricks has the potential to be Rookie of the Year, and his style of play will fit perfectly in today’s NBA. Paired with Walker Kessler, good luck going against the Utah bigs.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 guard is a strong defender who showed flashes of his on-ball ability with the Wildcats. He also shot the ball well from deep, netting 34% of his 3-pointers in his lone Kentucky season. Wallace still has strides to make as a playmaker but can step right into the NBA as a defensive guard who can shoot. Wallace can assist on that side of the ball as a rookie, taking the load off offensive stars. Wallace is the 62nd Kentucky draftee since the NBA went two rounds in 1989, tying Duke for most in that period.\n\n∎ NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed the Mavericks will swap picks with the Oklahoma City Thunder at No. 12, sending Wallace to Oklahoma City and No. 12 pick Dereck Lively II to Dallas.\n\nYes, he’s the son of the Michigan legend Juwan Howard and was coached by his Dad, but Jett Howard made a name for himself as the Wolverines’ second-leading scorer with 14.2 points per game as a starter his freshman year when he made the Big Ten All-Freshman team. In his first game, the 6-foot-8 guard scored 21 points, the first Michigan player to have a 20-point debut since three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year Jamal Crawford scored the same amount in 1999. The Magic (who acquired this pick from the Chicago Bulls before the draft) have loaded up on guards, after selecting Black with the No. 6 overall pick.\n\nThe 7-foot-1 center with a 7-foot-7 wingspan is an intriguing prospect. He was an athletic rim protector at Duke, averaging 2.4 blocks per game. Lively struggled offensively, scoring in double digits just three times in the final month of the season. However, after displaying his 3-point shooting at a Klutch Sports pre-draft workout, Lively’s stock has risen in recent weeks. His defense and size make him someone who can contribute immediately, even if his offense lags behind. Lively will become big key on a Mavericks team that needed help on defense. He is now the 63rd Duke draft pick since 1989, the most of any school.\n\n∎ NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed the Thunder will swap picks with the Dallas Mavericks at No. 10, sending Lively II to Dallas and 10 pick Cason Wallace to Oklahoma City.\n\nThe Raptors ranked third-to-last in 3-point percentage (33.5%) last season, but that should get a boost with this pick as Dick was arguably one of the best sharpshooters in college basketball last season. He averaged 40.3% from beyond the arc, setting the record for most 3-point shots made by a Kansas freshman. With a deep range and remarkable ability to get open, Dick will be an excellent catch-and-shoot player in the NBA. He doesn’t have the best size, but will put up a solid effort on defense and will help crash the boards.\n\nThe Pelicans offense gets a big boost by drafting Hawkins, who helped the UConn Huskies win the 2023 NCAA championship. At 6-foot-5 with an elite shot, Hawkins is someone who will contribute immediately in the league. He shot 38.8% from deep last season and can spot up or pull up off the dribble from beyond the arc. Hawkins off-ball movement and lethal 3-point shooting is a rare combination entering the league. In the modern NBA, players like Hawkins are highly sought after and finding him in the draft is a cheap alternative.\n\nBufkin enjoyed a major role in his second season with the Wolverines and made the most of it. He averaged 14 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game while shooting 35.5% from deep. He’s a versatile player on offense with the ability to finish at the basket and be a playmaker. Bufkin is also a solid on-ball defender, a combination that can make him an instant contributor. He has tons of upside, which Atlanta will want to develop as a complementary piece to Trae Young.\n\nUtah got a defensive stud with the No. 9 pick, so it made sense to go with a premier scoring threat with the No. 16 pick (which originally belonged to the Minnesota Timberwolves). George, the Big 12 Freshman of the Year, is a well-rounded offensive player who can make plays, finish through contact and get his shot off quickly. At 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, George averaged 15 points per game and is a lot to handle on offense. He can bring immediate offensive firepower on all three levels. His one weakness is defense and adding that layer to his game will make him a more complete player.\n\nWhen you got LeBron James and Anthony Davis, any perimeter scorers will be a big plus. The marksman from Indiana has a game that will transfer to the NBA immediately. He can pull up from anywhere and developed a knack for the midrange while having huge scoring games. However, he did struggle with his shot selection while with the Hoosiers, shooting 41.7% from the field. Finding some consistency will take him to the next level and make a major contribution to a Lakers team that shot 34.6% from 3-point range.\n\nA standout during the pre-draft process, Jaquez brings experience to Miami, who fell just short of an NBA title. The 2022-23 Pac-12 Player of the Year averaged 17.8 points per game in his last season at UCLA and was a major factor during the team’s improbable Final Four run in 2021. Jaquez has impressive footwork and control with the ball to fake out defenders, and a majority of his scoring came from the midrange. He will be ready to contribute at the start of the season, and his defensive game makes him reliable on both ends of the court. Expect him to also crash the boards, as he averaged a team-high 8.2 rebounds per game last year.\n\nPodziemski’s career has been defined by living in fast forward. He only played three high school seasons at St. John’s Northwestern where he scored 2,154 points and was the first player in Wisconsin history to pass the 2,000-point mark without playing a senior season. The 6-foot-5 guard joined the Broncos last offseason after spending his freshman year at Illinois, where he averaged 1.4 points and 0.9 rebounds. His output increased significantly with Santa Clara, where he carried the team with 19.9 points, 8.8 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.8 steals across 32 games – doubling the number of appearances he had as a member of the Illini. He earned co-West Coast Conference player of the year honors for his impact and could be a great shooting option to replace Jordan Poole.\n\nWhitmore was projected to be a top-10 pick but fell all the way to No. 20. Regardless, Houston gets a man who loves to play through contact. Whitmore showed how strong he is in his lone season with the Wildcats as he was named 2022-23 Big East Freshman of the Year. Whitmore without a doubt is dangerous with the ball, and with his aggressive driving skills, can produce some highlight-worthy dunks. Don’t let the 6-foot-7 frame fool you either; Whitmore will battle underneath the basket and fight for rebounds, and he can guard any position.\n\nThe Rockets pick at No. 20 originally belonged to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nWhile Brandon Miller might be the big name coming out of Alabama in the 2023 draft, fellow freshman Noah Clowney made his mark on the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. The South Carolina-bred forward started all 36 games where he averaged 9.8 points, 7.9 rebounds and 0.9 blocks and had an impressive 48.6% marksmanship from the field. His 7-foot-2 wingspan also gives him reach, adding a defensive boost to a rebuilding Brooklyn team attempting to get back to the playoffs.\n\n∎The Nets pick at No. 21 originally belonged to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nWhitehead made the most of his one-and-done year with the Blue Devils, despite suffering injuries that kept him on the bench to start the season and for a period of time midway through the year. The 6-foot-7 forward made seven starts for the hallowed program and shot 42.4% from behind the arc, the highest on the team and the fifth-best three-point percentage by a freshman in Duke history. If his college resume didn’t wow scouts, he was named the MVP of the 2022 McDonald’s All-American Game and the 2022 Naismith High School Player of the Year for his senior season when he averaged 16.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.5 steals at Montverde Academy. Brooklyn appears to trust his health going forward, and if all goes well, he’ll be a much-needed shooter for the Nets. Whitehead is recovering from foot surgeries, but has top-10 talent if healthy, so the Nets made a good risk pick.\n\nMurray’s twin brother, Keegan, was drafted by the Sacramento Kings last year and now it’s Kris' time to shine. The lefty was a late bloomer in high school and played 13 games from the bench in his freshman year with Iowa, but leaves the program as a consistent starter who led the Hawkeyes in several categories with 20.2 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game. He made basketball history against Georgia Tech when he scored 31 points with 20 rebounds, four assists, four three-point shots and two blocks. He was the first player ever — NBA, WNBA, men’s and women’s college — to post such a monster stat line. With Henderson selected earlier in the first round, Portland has some scoring threats alongside Lillard.\n\n∎The Blazers pick at No. 23 originally belonged to the New York Knicks.\n\nProsper had a major jump at Marquette in his junior year, going from 6.6 points per game in 2021-22 to 12.5 points per game in 2022-23. He has great size and energy, and he gained enough attention to climb into the first round.\n\nThe American Athletic Conference Player of the Year did it all for Houston last season. He was a premier offensive player for the Cougars, averaging 16.8 points per game while shooting 38.4% from 3-point land, all while putting the pressure on the defensive end. He doesn’t have ideal size for an NBA guard, but his toughness and tenacity will be the biggest key for him getting minutes in the league.\n\n∎ Detroit acquired this pick in a draft-day trade from Boston after the Celtics acquired the pick from Memphis in a three-way trade that involved Marcus Smart, Kristaps Porzingis and Tyus Jones.\n\nBelmont isn’t exactly a school with national attention, so Sheppard made sure he shone when he had the audience. At the NBA combine, the 6-foot-6 guard excelled in exhibition play with 10 points and three rebounds in the first game and wowed with 25 points in a second outing. He’s fast — 2.98 shuttle run and 3.17 three quarter sprint — and was 12th in the country last season with a 41.5% 3-point percentage. Sheppard is among the best shooters in the draft, and could be a league leader.\n\n∎The Pacers pick at No. 26 originally belonged to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n247Sports’ No. 1 recruit in the Class of 2022, Smith Jr. had a bumpy lone season as knee injuries limited him to just 17 games. He had five games with at least 20 points and is an explosive scorer. His offensive game is a little one-dimensional, but he has the tools to be a first-round steal. With Miller drafted earlier in the round, Smith could be a great backup option for the backcourt and possible sixth man.\n\n∎The No. 27 pick by the Hornets is originally from Nuggets via Thunder via Knicks\n\nSensabaugh, at 6-foot-6, led the Buckeyes in points and was second in rebounds, averaging 16.3 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. The Florida-bred forward is the first freshman to lead Ohio State in scoring since D’Angelo Russell did so in 2015. He scored 17 points off the bench in his college debut and his best game was against the Iowa Hawkeyes, when he scored 27 points and had five rebounds in a Big 10 matchup. His ability to jump in and contribute will enable the Jazz to utilize him quickly.\n\n∎The No. 28 pick by the Jazz is originally from 76ers via Nets\n\nAn excellent 3-point shooter for the Bulldogs (40.8%), Strawther has deadeye capabilities and will be another scoring threat for the defending champions. He continued to improve over his three seasons in Spokane, Washington, including making the go-ahead 3-pointer in a dramatic Sweet 16 win over UCLA. He will be a great catch-and-shoot player, but will need to develop his dribble.\n\n∎Denver's No. 29 pick is originally from Pacers via Celtics\n\nAn experienced player after four seasons with the Tigers, Brown developed into a prolific scorer his senior year with 15.8 points per game with a 45.5% 3-point shooting percentage. He isn’t the quickest, but Brown has incredible size for his position, and he’ll more than likely overpower any guards on him. Since he’s older than most draftees, he’ll need to be durable to be a solid bench player.\n\n∎The No. 30 pick by the Clippers is originally from Milwaukee via Houston\n\n31.

What we do know for sure is that the Thompson twins’ family has probably never had a better night, and that Wizards fans are in for a long 2023-24 season.\n\nHere are the other winners and losers from Thursday night.\n\nGet your umbrella out: it's time for the NBA draft drip check. And maybe grab a pair of shades while you're at it.\n\nThis year's affair, held on Thursday at the Barclays Center in New York, did not disappoint with a wide variety of draft day looks, from bold, colorful outfits to key accessories that were statement pieces in the noise.\n\nPlayers had their own red and navy outfits that turned heads even as all eyes were on No. 1 overall pick Victor Wembanyama, who had a clean look with a message only he can deliver.\n\nIf all the trades on draft night were completely confusing, let us help you ease your mind with a definitive countdown of the best looks of the night. Here's the 2023 NBA draft drip check.\n\nWith evaluating a prospect's long-term basketball success becoming increasingly challenging, teams picking in the lottery can't afford to get picks wrong and set their franchises back farther than they already are.\n\nThursday's draft produced little drama at the top, with Victor Wembanyama, Brandon Miller, and Scoot Henderson going with the first three picks.\n\nWhile none of the players below will reach the level of all-time head-scratcher like the Cleveland Cavaliers selecting Anthony Bennett with the first overall pick in the 2013 draft, some of the selections have more to deal with if the player can be productive on the NBA level.\n\nWhile some of the draftees' questionable fashion choices could be easily corrected with a colorblind test, here are some questionable draft choices that also opened eyes.\n\nThe 2023 NBA Draft class will have an impact on next season.\n\nBut ... how big of an impact will Victor Wembanyama have on the San Antonio Spurs? What about Brandon Miller in Charlotte? And Scoot Henderson in Portland? That’s what is going to make the 2023-24 season so entertaining and compelling.\n\nThere will be other interesting stories to follow, including rebuilding efforts in Detroit, Orlando, Houston, Utah and Indiana.\n\nThe draft is (mostly) all about the promise of a better tomorrow. Who will capitalize?\n\nBefore we move on to free agency and that wheeling and dealing that is bound to happen starting June 30, let’s look at USA TODAY Sports' post-NBA draft power rankings.\n\nFrance center Victor Wembanyama is the no-brainer top pick and a generational prospect who is predicted to transform whichever franchise he joins, a rare combination in sports.\n\nIn February, scouts said that passing on Wembanyama in the draft would be a fireable offense. LeBron James called Wembanyama \"an alien\" and \"generational talent.\" Kevin Durant said the NBA is \"really in trouble\" when the 7-foot-4 center joins the league. ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski proclaimed Wembanyama as the greatest prospect in sports.\n\nAs generational as Wembanyama might be, there have been other highly touted prospects who have entered the NBA. Some lived up to the hype, rising to the occasion for memorable careers. Others, well, not so much. Here’s how some of the most anticipated NBA prospects fared in the league. — Anthony Gharib\n\nSan Antonio won the Victor Wembanyama lottery in May, and within the next few months we might have a sense of how the Spurs' likely first-round draft pick’s skills translate to the NBA. The 19-year-old sensation, who has wowed at the highest amateur levels, powered his French professional team Metropolitans 92 to the LNB Finals. The Mets 92, though, were swept Thursday in the five-game series by favorite AS Monaco, a team with several former NBA players.\n\nWembanyama scored just eight points for the Mets 92 in the first-game blowout loss, but he bounced back in the final two games with 19 and 22 points, respectively, and seven rebounds and multiple blocks in each. Wembanyama couldn't help Mets 92 end their championship drought, but that may have little correlation to his future success in the NBA.\n\nAnd, it's a bit of apples and oranges to compare a stellar high school career like LeBron James', a one-and-done college career like Anthony Davis' or even a four-year college career like Tim Duncan's – the Spurs' last No. 1 pick. So here's a look at how his stature compares with others who have played in the NBA.\n\nHere is a look at Wembanyama’s stats.\n\nWembanyama is listed at 7-foot-4.\n\n— Jim Sergant\n\nHere is a look at some of the top prospects in the draft.\n\n∎ Victor Wembanyama, Metropolitans 92, Forward/center, 19 years old, 7-4, 230 pounds, France\n\n2022-23 stats: 21.6 points, 10.5 rebounds, 3.1 blocks, 2.5 assists, 0.7 steals\n\nWith his size and skill set, Wembanyama is one of the most lauded prospects of the past three decades. Execs believe he is the kind of player who will turn a team into a title contender.\n\n∎ Scoot Henderson, G League Ignite, Guard, 19 years old, 6-2, 196 pounds\n\n2022-23 stats: 16.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists, 1.1 steals\n\nHenderson, who at 17 became the youngest player in G League history in 2021, is the total package. He is a master at midrange, can knock down a shot from behind the arc and finish at the rim, while getting it done on the defensive end. He can immediately impact any team.\n\n∎ Brandon Miller, Alabama, Small forward, 20 years old, 6-9, 200 pounds, freshman\n\n2022-23 stats: 18.8 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.9 steals\n\nThe national freshman of the year, Miller’s long, lanky frame and athleticism will translate quickly at the next level, though he needs to become a more efficient shooter in the pros.\n\n∎ Cam Whitmore, Villanova, Forward, 18 years old, 6-7, 235 pounds, freshman\n\n2022-23 stats: 12.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, 0.7 assists, 1.4 steals\n\nA physical wing and active offensive player who likes contact, Whitmore operates from the perimeter with his jump shot or his dribble-drive to the basket but is also comfortable playing off the basketball.

The second pick remains a choice between Alabama forward Brandon Miller and G League Ignite guard Scoot Henderson.\n\nIt is a deep draft among lottery picks beyond Wembanyama, Miller and Henderson. Here is the top five in USA TODAY Sports’ latest mock draft:\n\nSpurs: Victor Wembanyama, Metropolitans 92 (France), Forward/center, 19 years old, 7-4, 230 pounds\n\nHornets: Scoot Henderson, G League Ignite, Guard, 19 years old, 6-2, 196 pounds\n\nTrail Blazers: Brandon Miller, Alabama, Small forward, 20 years old, 6-9, 200 pounds\n\nRockets: Cam Whitmore, Villanova, Forward, 18 years old, 6-7, 235 pounds\n\nPistons: Amen Thompson, Overtime Elite, Guard, 20 years old, 6-7, 215 pounds\n\nThe NBA draft usually has 60 total picks. This year, there are 58 total picks as the Chicago Bulls and Philadelpha 76ers each forfeited a second-round pick for violating rules around free agency talks.\n\nHere are the No. 1 picks this century.\n\n2022: Paolo Banchero (Orlando Magic)\n\n2021: Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)\n\n2020: Anthony Edwards (Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\n2019: Zion Williamson (New Orleans Pelicans)\n\n2018: Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)\n\n2017: Markelle Fultz (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\n2016: Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\n2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves)\n\n2014: Andrew Wiggins (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2013: Anthony Bennett (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2012: Anthony Davis (New Orleans Hornets)\n\n2011: Kyrie Irving (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2010: John Wall (Washington Wizards)\n\n2009: Blake Griffin (LA Clippers)\n\n2008: Derrick Rose (Chicago Bulls)\n\n2007: Greg Oden (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\n2006: Andrea Bargnani (Toronto Raptors)\n\n2005: Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks)\n\n2004: Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic)\n\n2003: LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\n2002: Yao Ming (Houston Rockets)\n\n2001: Kwame Brown (Washington Wizards)\n\n2000: Kenyon Martin (New Jersey Nets)\n\nFormer NBA stars Gilbert Arenas and Iman Shumpert gave their two cents on how the 19-year-old French phenom Wembanyama will do in the NBA on Fubo Sports’ “No Chill with Gilbert Arenas” podcast.\n\nArenas has high expectations for the center, especially given that regular season MVP Joel Embiid and Finals MVP Nikola Jokic are the only two dominant players at the position.\n\n“He’s gonna be a star. The reason is, there’s only two centers that he’s gotta worry about,” he said. “… I’m putting him at the 5 because he only has to worry about Embiid for two games and then Joker for six. … You gonna get killed for six games, but other than that, it’s just lunch meat out there for you.”\n\nShumpert said teams are going to throw the best they can at him despite position.\n\n“They’re gonna put whoever can move with him the best,” he said. “Certain people are just not gonna guard him.”\n\nThe “Dancing with the Stars” champion explained Wembanyama will grow into his potential naturally.\n\n“Just develop, put that weight on, get your confidence up to realize nobody can stop you,” he said. “That’s the scary part. When they give you 20 shots a game and start letting you realize, you’ll figure it out.” — Victoria Hernandez\n\nIt’s a big week for Henderson, a likely top three pick in the 2023 NBA Draft. Henderson will be busy seeing his NBA dreams come true as he walks the stage in Brooklyn. But, it’s not the only thing he’ll be celebrating -- his first player edition shoe with Puma released on Thursday.\n\nThe presumed No. 2 pick signed a deal with Puma last year at the age of 18. Puma is launching Henderson’s new All-Pro Nitro shoe colorway and decided to celebrate it in a huge way.\n\nA massive billboard with Henderson wearing his new shoes appeared on Flatbush in Brooklyn this week. His colorway is inspired by Henderson’s hometown of Marietta, Ga. plus his “Overly Determined To Dominate” mantra, according to ESPN’s Nick DePaula.\n\nThe shoes colors include red, light blue and white, matching the colors of two teams that may select Henderson on Thursday: The Charlotte Hornets and Portland Trail Blazers. — Anthony Gharib\n\nThe draft is one of many events NBA fans can wager on. Victor Wembanyama is the overwhelming favorite to be drafted first overall, and the betting odds reflect that. He is listed at –10,000 odds to be the first name called by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, according to BetMGM. But the second and third picks are where things could get interesting. BetMGM has Brandon Miller listed as the favorite to go second overall at -550, while Scoot Henderson is +250 to be the second pick and -450 to go third overall. — Richard Morin\n\nThere are plenty of odds when it comes to the NBA draft. First, teams that miss the playoffs enter into a lottery system to determine their first-round selection. For example, the team with the worst record in the regular season has a 14% chance to claim the top pick. This season, the San Antonio Spurs won the first overall pick despite only having tied for the second-worst record during the 2022-23 season. — Richard Morin\n\nThe Spurs are on the clock, but there’s no suspense surrounding the No. 1 overall pick with generational talent Victor Wembanyama destined for San Antonio.\n\nWembanyama headlines Thursday’s 2023 NBA draft. However, there is uncertainly following the consensus top choice. What will the Charlotte Hornets and Portland Trail Blazers do at the top of the draft? Will Orlando make magic happen with its two lottery selections? Could the Los Angeles Lakers trade the No. 17 pick?\n\nAll 30 clubs have some decisions to make. USA TODAY Sports explores NBA teams with much at stake ahead of the draft. — Tyler Dragon\n\nNBA Draft prospect Brandon Miller is sticking by his GOAT pick.\n\nAfter setting the internet ablaze on Wednesday by dubbing Paul George as the greatest basketball player of all-time over LeBron James and Michael Jordan, Miller doubled down on his controversial selection: “I grew up watching Paul George and I think Paul George is my GOAT.”\n\nMiller clarified that he didn’t mean any disrespect toward James or Jordan.\n\n“I’m not knocking LeBron (James) or Michael Jordan,” he told USA TODAY Sports on the 2023 NBA Draft red carpet in Brooklyn Thursday. “I know they are all great players. LeBron is the best in the league now and I know Jordan was the best in the league at the time.” — Cydney Henderson\n\nFrance’s Victor Wembanyama will go No. 1 to the San Antonio Spurs in Thursday’s NBA draft.\n\nUnless something drastic happens, the Spurs are setting up their present and future with the player many believe is a generational, franchise-transforming player.\n\nThe second pick remains a choice between Alabama forward Brandon Miller and G League Ignite guard Scoot Henderson.\n\n\"That's a difficult decision,\" ESPN’s Jay Bilas said. \"I would lean toward Miller because of the shooting. In a league that values shooting, he can really shoot it.\"\n\nIt is a deep draft among lottery picks beyond Wembanyama, Miller and Henderson.\n\n\"I have Cam Whitmore of Villanova rated fourth,\" Bilas said, adding, \"After that, there are a number of really good players available. The Thompson twins (Amen and Ausar) are both really talented and can absolutely play.\""
