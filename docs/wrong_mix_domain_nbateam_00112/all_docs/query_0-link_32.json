        "text": "Biggest NBA Draft Busts: Major Letdowns üò©\n\nWe often hear about how much potential high NBA Draft picks have and their vast ceiling to accomplish great things at the next level. But all those accolades are mere speculation as the NBA is at a different level than the college ranks.We‚Äôve been talking quite a bit about the NBA Mock Draft 2024 but what about those top picks from yesteryear when the hype far exceeded performance? Let‚Äôs review five major busts that made NBA news for all the wrong reasons!\n\n5. Pervis Ellison, Sacramento Kings (No. 1, 1989)\n\nWhile Tim Hardaway, drafted 14th by the Warriors, ultimately became the best player in the draft, Pervis Ellison entered as the college superstar. However, the draft lottery didn‚Äôt translate to success for those picked at the top. The LA Clippers took Danny Ferry at number two, but both Ellison (picked first by Sacramento) and Ferry turned out to be colossal busts.\n\nEllison‚Äôs career was plagued by injuries. Teammates even nicknamed him ‚ÄúOut of Service Pervis‚Äù or ‚ÄúNervous Pervis.‚Äù After a disappointing rookie season, Sacramento shipped him out. He averaged a meager 9.5 points per game throughout his forgettable career.\n\n4. Kwame Brown, Washington Wizards (No. 1, 2001)\n\nThe 2001 draft wasn‚Äôt a star-studded event, but it unearthed a few gems who went on to shine in the NBA. Pao Gasol was selected third overall that year by the Memphis Grizzlies, played in over 1300 NBA games and is now ensconced in the Hall of Fame.\n\nBut Kwame Brown didn‚Äôt fare nearly as well and famously told then-head coach Doug Collins, ‚ÄúIf you draft me, you‚Äôll never regret it.‚Äù\n\nWell, that was a lie and it also tarnished Michael Jordan‚Äôs legacy as an NBA executive. Brown lasted just four seasons with the Wizards and was unceremoniously traded to the Lakers where he became the consummate journeyman whose best season saw him average 10.9 points per game in his third season with Washington.\n\n3. Michael Olowokandi, Los Angeles Clippers (No. 1, 1998)\n\nThey say hindsight is 20/20 and wouldn‚Äôt the Clippers love to have this pick back considering the likes of Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki, and Paul Pierce were all available and would all go on to Hall of Fame careers? But the 7-footer was too tempting to resist and the Clippers desperately tried to coach him up and lead their team.\n\nAfter five seasons, it was clear that Olowokandi wasn‚Äôt the heir-apparent to David Robinson the Clippers thought they were getting and left for a deal with Minnesota. He also earned a bad reputation in the process and was considered ‚Äútalented but uncoachable‚Äù by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He would wrap up his career as a spare part in Boston and averaged just 8.3 points per game over his 10-year career.\n\n2. Greg Oden, Portland Trail Blazers (No. 1, 2007)\n\nThe 2007 draft swirled with debate: Greg Oden or Kevin Durant? The Trail Blazers held the golden ticket, a 50/50 shot at superstardom, but whiffed on their selection. They chose Oden first overall, leaving the Seattle Supersonics ecstatic to snatch future Hall-of-Famer Durant at number two.\n\nOden‚Äôs body, unfortunately, betrayed the talent that made him an Ohio State star. He only managed two seasons in Portland before a comeback attempt four years later with Miami. Injuries forced him to retire early.\n\n1. Sam Bowie, Portland Trail Blazers, (No. 2, 1984)\n\nSam Bowie never had a chance. He was drafted with the second overall pick in 1984 by the Trail Blazers behind only Akeem ‚ÄúThe Dream‚Äù Olajuwon but before the legendary Michael Jordan at No. 3. Sprinkle in fellow Hall-of-Famers Charles Barkley at No. 5 and John Stockton at No. 16 and now you have some idea of why Sam Bowie is at the top of this ignominious list.\n\nSam Bowie would play four years in Portland with the last two comprising only 25 games. Injuries hampered the big man and he would spend the next four years as a member of the New Jersey Nets before becoming a role player on the Lakers in his last two seasons.\n\nBowie carved out a decent niche for himself for a few seasons in New Jersey. If drafted near the end of the first round, Bowie‚Äôs 10.9 points per game wouldn‚Äôt have been very impressive. Unfortunately, Bowie landed near the top of one of the most stacked drafts in history. That‚Äôs why his draft position makes him forever remembered as a monumental disappointment.\n\nFor betting news, odds analysis, and more, visit Point Spreads Sports Magazine.\n\nCan‚Äôt get enough?
