        "text": "In the wake of Ja Morant’s latest incident featuring a handgun, 2001 No. 1 NBA draft pick Kwame Brown posted a nearly five-minute long scathing NSFW video ripping the Grizzlies star.\n\n“I’ve heard of NBA YoungBoy, but you NBA dumb boy,” Brown said in the video, which can be watched here. “You got to be the dumbest mother----er in the league.”\n\nMorant was suspended for eight games in March when he was seen flashing a gun at a Colorado night club on his own Instagram Live stream. As a result, he apologized for his actions and entered a counseling program in Florida before returning to the court. Just two months later, he was again seen flashing a handgun on Instagram Live with a friend. This time it was in a vehicle, and his friend filmed the moment on his own Instagram Live on Saturday.\n\nMorant is currently suspended from all team activities, and he’s expected to be suspended to start the 2023–24 season. During Brown’s scathing video, in which he rips Morant for his actions, Brown said, “You wanna be the new Gilbert Arenas.” Arenas, a former NBA star, had several incidents involving firearms during his career.\n\nThis incident isn’t just the second time he finds himself making headlines for the wrong reasons. He has been involved in several others over the past year. In one such incident, he is alleged to have threatened a 22-year-old shoe salesman last July. He is also alleged to have assaulted a 17-year-old boy in Tennessee last summer."
