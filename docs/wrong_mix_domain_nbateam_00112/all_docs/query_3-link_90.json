        "text": "Former No.1 Draft Pick, the immortal Kwame Brown, has been cut loose by the Sixers. From the press release (which only granted the cut a single phrase) and Delaware County Daily Times: “The Philadelphia 76ers today announced that they have signed free agent guards Elliot Williams and Lorenzo Brown. Per team policy, terms of the deals were not disclosed. […] In a related move, the Sixers have waived Kwame Brown and Darius Morris. […] Kwame Brown, who had yet to play this season while battling a right hamstring strain, is due $3 million. Morris, who averaged 6.9 points in 16.8 minutes in 12 appearances, will make $1.06 million. ‘Never a fun day to have to do that, but this is the stage we’re in,’ Sixers GM Sam Hinkie said on the roster moves. ‘We’ll continue to evaluate players and find ones that can help us move forward and find others on our radar that we can add to our group.'”"
