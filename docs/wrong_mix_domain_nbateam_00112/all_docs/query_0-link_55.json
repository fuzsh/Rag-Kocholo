        "text": "CHICAGO — In the ever-evolving NBA, size has not necessarily been devalued; rather, the number of quality players towering over their counterparts has diminished immensely.\n\nBut the desire to find a potentially franchise-altering big man remains the same — perhaps more than ever in a league dominated by point guards — and the New Orleans Hornets will have a rare opportunity with the No. 1 overall pick to draft a potentially dominant, shot-blocking forward who just happened to be a 6-foot-2 guard three years ago.\n\nAnthony Davis did not have a problem learning how to play big, partly because he already had honed his talents before undergoing an astounding eight-inch growth spurt that elevated him from unknown high-school prospect to the nation’s top recruit.\n\nAfter dominating college basketball in his only season at Kentucky — he won every major individual honor and a national championship — the freakishly athletic and high-flying Davis is a couple of days away from being the first player chosen in the NBA draft.\n\n“It’s very crazy for me. Overwhelming,” Davis, 19, said recently of his startling ascension. “I’m just trying to take it all in. I used to just look at all types of magazines and say, ‘I wish it was me on this cover.’ I had no thought of ever being here right now.”\n\nSoon, the 6-10 Davis will not only see his face on the cover of magazines, but also on billboards and signs throughout New Orleans as the Hornets promote their new franchise player — less than a year after trading the previous face of the organization, Chris Paul, to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nNine players 6-10 or taller have been drafted No. 1 overall in the past 15 years.\n\nTim Duncan, Dwight Howard, Yao Ming and Blake Griffin have had success; Andrew Bogut and Andrea Bargnani have had solid but undistinguished careers; Michael Olowokandi, Kwame Brown and Greg Oden did not pan out for various reasons.Davis believes that not being far removed from his days as a savvy dribbling and slashing guard will give him an advantage at the next level.\n\n“To be able to run the floor faster than most guys, ballhandling, shooting, soft touch around the rim, catching the ball … just to have the basketball IQ, knowing what to do in the open floor,” said Davis, who averaged 14.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.7 blocked shots at Kentucky. “Because I played guard makes it a lot easier on me. I really had no problem transitioning from a guard to a big. It was kind of easy. I don’t know where it came from.”\n\nKentucky coach John Calipari said Davis could be a power forward or small forward in the NBA given his lanky frame.\n\nDavis knows that he will have to add some mass but believes he can still help a team with his quickness, agility, ability to block shots while keeping the ball in play and an array of skills that he often had to suppress for the good of the team at Kentucky.\n\nDavis said he became used to being challenged at Kentucky, and he does not expect it to change in the NBA.\n\n“I think it prepared me,” Davis said of playing in Lexington. “That was a big stage for us, everybody who played on that team. Every game, everybody wanted to come after us. Everything we do, guys were watching. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be the same.”\n\nNBA Draft Order\n\n• When: 7 p.m. Thursday\n\n• Where: Prudential Center, Newark, N.J.\n\nFirst round\n\n1. New Orleans\n\n2. Charlotte\n\n3.
