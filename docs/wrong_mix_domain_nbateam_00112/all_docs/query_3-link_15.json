        "text": "Basketball forward Kwame Brown was slated to go to the University of Florida, as he had committed to playing there. But with his stock rising, Brown decided to enter the NBA Draft.\n\nThe Wizards had the number one pick and Brown was linked to them. And on June 28, 2001, the Wizards made it official by taking Kwame Brown with the first overall pick in the NBA Draft. It was expected that Brown would come in and grow into being a great player, but unfortunately, he did not become the player that many expected.\n\nWith Michael Jordan as a part of the front office and also joining the team, Brown did not blossom at all and eventually was traded away, never to become what some thought he could have been."
