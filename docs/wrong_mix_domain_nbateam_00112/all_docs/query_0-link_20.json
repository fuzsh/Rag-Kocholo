        "text": "For our LA neighbors, I just wanted to point out something....\n\nOct. 30, 2002, a 20 year old center went for 12 points, 18 rebounds and 5 blocks on opening day of his second NBA season. The next night, he scored 20 and blocked 6 shots.\n\nIn March of the following season, he had 30 and 17, followed by 27 and 11 in back-to-back games. That center's name is Kwame Brown, and he's currently 24.\n\nAndrew Bynum is a nice looking young center. For the first time since the Shaq trade, there's a little light at the end of the Lakers' tunnel. I can now imagine a Lakers team that can make the playoffs without a miracle coaching job from Phil - a Lakers team that could actually win a playoff series. But Bynum has to continue to develop, and it wouldn't hurt if Farmar were for real too. It turns out, center and point guard are two pretty important positions in the NBA, even in the triangle.\n\nBut the kid's 19. He followed up his 20 and 14 game against Minnesota with a 2 point, 5 rebound, 6 foul game against Portland. So let's put the Wilt/Kareem/Shaq talk on the back-burner for awhile, OK?"
