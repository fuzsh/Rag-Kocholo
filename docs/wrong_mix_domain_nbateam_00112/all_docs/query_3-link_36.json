        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to a $6 million US, two-year contract with former No. 1 overall draft pick Kwame Brown.\n\nAgent Mark Bartelstein announced the move Friday.\n\nBrown will be reunited with Sixers coach Doug Collins. Collins was Brown's first coach in Washington in 2001. Brown has averaged 6.8 points and 5.6 rebounds over an 11-year career.\n\nThe well-travelled Brown was the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in the 2001 draft by the Washington Wizards.\n\nBartelstein said one reason Brown was eager to join the Sixers was because Collins was like a \"father figure\" to the centre.\n\n\"Kwame and Doug have a relationship that I think really has grown over the years,\" Bartelstein said. \"It's a great fit.\"\n\nBrown signed a $7 million, one-year deal with Golden State before last season. But he played in only nine games and averaged 6.3 points and 6.3 rebounds in 20.8 minutes before needing season-ending surgery on his chest muscle.\n\nThe 30-year-old Brown is set to play for his seventh team. He will join a frontcourt that includes Spencer Hawes, Thaddeus Young, Lavoy Allen, Nik Vucevic and rookie Arnett Moultrie. The Sixers waived veteran forward Elton Brand this week.\n\n\"It gives Kwame a chance to play an integral role on a playoff team,\" Bartelstein said.\n\nBrown never lived up to his No. 1 billing after Michael Jordan picked him out of high school. Only once has he averaged double digits in points over a full season and, even in his limited minutes, the 6-foot-11 centre failed to block a shot last season. Brown played four seasons with the Wizards before bouncing around to the Lakers, Memphis, Detroit, Charlotte and the Warriors.\n\nThe Sixers also this week acquired forward Dorrell Wright from the Warriors and signed free-agent guard Nick Young to a one-year contract.\n\nPacers sign Augustin\n\nThe Indiana Pacers have re-signed free agents Roy Hibbert and George Hill, two key members of their rebuilding project.\n\nHibbert, a fourth-year pro, is coming off an All-Star season, averaging 12.8 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game and giving the Pacers a dominant presence at centre. He says he's happy to be back because the Pacers have \"unfinished business\" after losing to eventual champion Miami in the playoffs.\n\nHill was drafted by San Antonio with the 24th overall pick in 2008 and spent his first three seasons with the Spurs. The guard joined Indiana in June 2011, and has career averages of 9.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.\n\nThe Pacers also said they have signed free agent guard D.J. Augustin, who averaged 10.9 points and 4.4 assists during four years in Charlotte.\n\nTerms were not released Friday. Earlier this week, the Pacers traded guards Darren Collison and Dahntay Jones to Dallas Mavericks for centre Ian Mahinmi.\n\nRockets waive Scola\n\nThe Houston Rockets have waived forward Luis Scola using the amnesty clause, clearing more salary space with a major move in mind.\n\nThe one-time provision allows Scola to leave without his remaining contract counting against the team's salary cap or luxury tax. Scola is due to make about $21 million over the next three seasons.\n\nA fan favourite in Houston, the 6-foot-9 Scola averaged 14.5 points and 7.7 rebounds in five seasons with the Rockets.\n\nThe Rockets have torn apart their 2011-12 roster as they reportedly push Orlando to send them All-Star centre Dwight Howard. Cutting Scola would allow Houston to absorb multiple undesirable contracts from Orlando in a potential deal.\n\nMavericks claim Brand off waivers\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks have won the bidding to obtain Elton Brand off waivers.\n\nThe Mavericks said Friday that they had been awarded Brand.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers used the one-time amnesty provision in the new CBA to let Brand go and not have the $18.1 million he is owed in the final season of his five-year deal count against their salary cap or luxury tax. Brand will still get that full amount, with Philadelphia paying any difference.\n\nThe winning bid wasn't revealed by the Mavericks. ESPN, citing anonymous sources, reported it was $2.1 million.\n\nAny team under the salary cap was eligible to bid for Brand.\n\nTimberwolves trade Miller, waive Webster\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have traded centre Brad Miller and two second-round picks to New Orleans and waived swingman Martell Webster as they continue to make moves to make a run at Portland restricted free agent Nicolas Batum.\n\nThe Wolves made the moves on Friday, one day after using the amnesty clause on centre Darko Milicic. The Wolves received a conditional second-round pick from the Hornets for Miller, who has said he will retire.\n\nWebster was due to make about $5.7 million this season, but the Timberwolves executed a buyout that required them to pay just $600,000.\n\nThe moves were expected to help Minnesota's pursuit of Batum, who has signed a four-year offer sheet worth more than $45 million. The Blazers would have three days to match the offer or let Batum go.\n\nTrail Blazers sign Hickson, 3 others\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have formally signed free agent power forward J.J. Hickson, British forward Joel Freeland and draft picks Damian Lillard and Meyers Leonard.\n\nThe flurry of signings was announced by the Blazers on Friday.\n\nHickson, who agreed to 1-year deal with Portland, played in 19 games for the Blazers last season, averaging 15.1 points and 8.3 rebounds.\n\nFreeland, a 2006 draft pick by the Blazers, averaged 12.9 points and 7.5 rebounds last season with Spain's Unicaja Malaga.\n\nThe Blazers took Lillard out of Weber State with the sixth pick before selecting the 7-foot-1 Leonard out of Illinois with the 11th pick in the June draft."
