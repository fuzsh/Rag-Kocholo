        "text": "By MIKE WISE\n\nJune 28, 2001\n\nN.B.A. DRAFT\n\nHigh School Star Taken No. 1 in N.B.A. Draft\n\nwame Brown was mostly respectful during the time he spent working out with Michael Jordan, the Washington Wizards' president of basketball operations, two days before the N.B.A. draft.\n\nYet Brown, the pride of Brunswick, Ga., did not want to let the moment pass without displaying his competitive nature to Jordan.\n\n\"I'm going to beat you one day,\" Brown said before he left for New York.\n\n\"It's never going to happen,\" Jordan replied.\n\nWhether or not that playful exchange swayed the most accomplished player in league history to bring Brown to Washington, Jordan has another hungry, young player to measure himself by.\n\nLast night, Brown, a 6-foot-11-inch, 245-pound forward from Glynn Academy in Brunswick, became the first high school player to be selected No. 1 in the N.B.A. draft, held at the Theater at Madison Square Garden.\n\nStriding to the stage, embracing Commissioner David Stern in a camel-toned linen suit, Brown, 19, was one of three high school phenoms chosen among the first four picks.\n\n\"I guess I just made history,\" Brown said. \"It feels great. I've never been so nervous and just so overwhelmed in my life.\"\n\nHis deliberate steps toward the podium signaled the continued migration of teenagers to a league already teeming with young players.\n\nTyson Chandler, a 7-footer from Dominguez High School in Compton, Calif., was taken second by the Los Angeles Clippers, and Eddy Curry, the hulking 6-11, 285-pound center from the Chicago suburb of South Holland, was chosen fourth by the Chicago Bulls.\n\nIn a stunning trade, the Clippers sent the rights to Chandler, and the veteran forward Brian Skinner to the Bulls for Elton Brand, their franchise player the past two seasons.\n\nDeSagana Diop, a 7-foot, 315-pound center from Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Va., via Senegal, was plucked eighth by the Cleveland Cavaliers, becoming the 14th high school player taken in the first round since Kevin Garnett's selection by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1995.\n\nMichigan State's Jason Richardson, considered the most athletic player in the draft, was chosen fifth by the Golden State Warriors.\n\nShane Battier, the consensus college player of the year from Duke, was taken sixth by the Grizzlies, who will play in Memphis next season.\n\nStern's proposed age limit of 20 for entering the draft would have made Battier the No. 3 pick, though the 22-year-old senior did not regret his fortune.\n\n\"It sounds kind of archaic, but I actually enjoyed college, and I didn't want to give up my senior experience for anything,\" Battier said after he was drafted. \"I haven't regretted that decision since.\"\n\nRounding out the lottery teams, the Nets took the Seton Hall freshman Eddie Griffin, whose stock slipped in the days leading up to the draft, at No. 7. He was traded to the Rockets for the rights to Richard Jefferson, the 13th pick, Jason Collins, the 18th pick, and Brandon Armstrong, the 23rd pick.\n\nThe North Carolina-Charlotte freshman Rodney White was taken ninth by the Pistons. Arkansas's Joe Johnson and Kedrick Brown, the junior-college player of the year from Okaloosa-Walton Community College in Niceville, Fla., were taken 10th and 11th by the Boston Celtics.\n\nIn another draft-day surprise, the Grizzlies will also most likely acquire the 7-foot Spanish star Pau Gasol, who became the highest drafted foreign player in league history when the Atlanta Hawks chose him third over all.\n\nThe Hawks created the most back-room commotion when they reached an agreement in principle with the Grizzlies to trade the third pick, forward Lorenzen Wright and guard Brevin Knight for the All-Star forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim. A trade cannot be completed until July 18, when the moratorium on signing off-season contracts is lifted by the league.\n\nIn addition to that transaction, Atlanta had the choice of acquiring Gasol or opting for future considerations. It was widely assumed Atlanta made the choice for the Grizzlies.\n\nIn other trades, the Orlando Magic traded center Michael Doleac to the Cavaliers for the draft rights to North Carolina's Brendan Haywood, taken 20th. And the Magic traded the draft rights to St. John's point guard Omar Cook, the 32nd pick, to the Denver Nuggets to satisfy the conditions of a previous trade.\n\nThe Seattle SuperSonics took the 6-10 Yugoslav Vladimir Radmanovic with the 12th pick. Seton Hall's Samuel Dalembert went No. 26 to the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nBeyond the high school theme, six of the first eight players taken were 6-11 or taller. In Brown, Chandler and Diop (pronounced jop), many team executives believe the 2001 class has the potential to be one of the N.B.A.'s greatest big-man drafts.\n\nBut much of those prognostications are based on private workouts over the past two months, grainy film footage and the aura of potential surrounding many of the top picks. Indeed, never having played at a major college or without any sort of national television exposure, 8 of the first 12 players taken were strangers to the basketball landscape.\n\nStill, last night belonged to the youngsters who, as instant millionaires, were hired for their first full-time jobs amid all the pageantry and unpredictability that goes with being an N.B.A. first-rounder.\n\nHugging Stern, grinning broadly, they seemed genuinely awe-struck by their selections.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity for me to just bless my family and just touch so many lives,\" Brown said. \"Coming out of a small town, Brunswick, Ga., not many minorities make it, and I'm one of them. So hopefully, I'll just lift everyone up.\"\n\nChandler said: \"This is a lifelong dream. It's wild. I know it has to be real wild for you guys, too. It's the first time anything like this has ever happened.\"\n\nChandler's situation illustrated the crazy world he had just entered.\n\nAn hour before the Clippers shipped him to Chicago, Chandler and his mother embraced, knowing they would be close to each other in Southern California. He joked about her being able to continue washing his clothes.\n\nAsked how he felt after hearing of the trade, Chandler said: \"My mother was over there crying. But we'll be all right. We'll be all right.\"\n\nREBOUNDS\n\nTo reduce the travel of its staff after the finals each season, the N.B.A. plans to hold the draft in New York annually, a league official said. . . . Including KWAME BROWN, EDDY CURRY and EDDIE GRIFFIN, the agent ARN TELLEM represented six first-round picks. . . . With SAMUEL DALEMBERT going No. 26, the New York-based agent MARC CORNSTEIN had his third first-round pick in the past three years."
